##### *c. The Threefold Significance of the Mahâyâna Explained.*

Again the quintessence and the attributes of suchness (*bhûtatathatâ*)
know no diminution or addition, but remain the same in common people
(*prthagjana*), Çrâvakas, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas. It
was not created in the past, nor is it to be annihilated in the future;
it is eternal, permanent, absolute; and from all eternity it sufficingly
embraces in its essence all possible merits (*punya*).

That is to say, suchness has such characteristics as follows: the
effulgence of great wisdom; the universal illumination of the
dharmadhâtu \[universe\]; the true and adequate knowledge; the mind pure
and

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

clean in its self-nature; the eternal, the blessed, the self-regulating
and the pure; <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) the tranquil, the
immutable, and the free. And there is no heterogeneity in all those
Buddha-dharmas which, outnumbering the sands of the Ganges, can be
neither identical (*ekârtha*) nor not-identical (*nânârtha*) \[with the
essence of suchness\], and which therefore are out of the range of our
comprehension. Accordingly suchness is called the Tathâgata's womb
(*tathâgatagarbha*) or the Dharmakâya. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md)

It may be questioned: While it was stated before that suchness is devoid
of all characteristics (*lakshana*), how can it now be said without
contradiction that it embraces in full all such merits?

In reply it would be said that though suchness in truth abundantly
embraces all merits, yet it is free in its nature from all forms of
distinction; because all objects in the world are of one and the same
taste, are of one reality, have nothing to do with the modes of
particularisation, and are not of dualistic character. Depending on the
principle of birth-and-death, such as the activity-consciousness
(*karmavijñâna*?), etc., however, all signs of difference and
individuation appear.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

How are those qualifications to be assigned to suchness?

Though all things in their \[metaphysical\] origin come from the soul
alone and in truth free from particularisation, yet on account of
non-enlightenment there originates a subjective mind \[i.e.,
*âlaya-vijñâna*\] that becomes conscious of an external world
(*vishaya*). This we call ignorance (*avidya*). Nevertheless the essence
of the mind \[or the soul\] is perfectly pure, and there is no awakening
of ignorance in it. Thence we assign to suchness this quality, the
effulgence of great wisdom.

If the mind being awakened perceive an external world, then there will
be something that cannot be perceived by it. But the essence of the mind
has nothing to do with perception \[which presupposes the dual existence
of a perceiving subject and an object perceived\]; so there is nothing
that cannot be perceived by it, \[that is, the world of relativity is
submerged in the oneness of suchness\]. Thence we assign to suchness
this quality, the universal illumination of the universe
(*dharmadhâtu*).

When the mind is disturbed, it fails to be a true and adequate
knowledge; it fails to be a pure, clean essence; it fails to be eternal,
blissful, self-regulating, and pure; it fails to be tranquil, etc. On
the contrary, it will become transient, changeable, unfree, and
therefore the source of falsity and defilement, while its modifications
outnumber the sands of the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ganges. But when there is no disturbance in the
essence of the mind, we speak of suchness as being the true, adequate
knowledge, etc., and as possessing pure and clean merits that outnumber
the sands of the Ganges.

When the mind is disturbed it will strive to become conscious of the
existence of an external world and will thus betray the imperfection of
its inner condition. But as all infinite merits in fact constitute the
one mind which, perfect in itself, has no need of seeking after any
external things other than itself, so suchness never fails to actualise
all those Buddha-dharmas, that, outnumbering the sands of the Ganges,
can be said to be neither identical nor non-identical with the essence
of the mind, and that therefore are utterly out of the range of our
comprehension. On that account suchness is designated the Tathâgata's
womb (*tathâgatagarbha*) or the Tathâgata's Dharmakâya.

What is meant by the activity of suchness is this: all Buddhas, while at
the stage of discipline, feel a deep compassion (*mahâkarunâ*) \[for all
beings\], practise all pâramitâs, the four methods of entertainment
(*catvâri-sangrahavastûni*), and many other meritorious deeds-treat
others as their own self, wish to work out a universal salvation of
mankind in ages to come, through limitless numbers of kalpas; recognise
truthfully and adequately the principle of equality (*samatâ*)

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

among people; and do not cling to the individual existence of a sentient
being. <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md)

By virtue of such a great wisdom that works means of emancipation
(*upâyâjñâ*?), <span id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139.md) they annihilate
ignorance that knows no beginning; recognise the Dharmakâya in its
original purity; spontaneously perform incomprehensible karma <span
id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140.md) as well as various unfettered moral
activities; manifest themselves throughout the universe (*dharmadhâtu*),
identify themselves with suchness, and leave no traces of
compulsion. <span id="fr_141"></span>[4](#fn_141.md)

And how is this?

Because all Tathâgatas are the Dharmakâya itself, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[5](#fn_142.md) are the highest truth
(*paramârthasatya*) itself,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and have nothing to do with conditionality (*samvrittisatya*) and
compulsory actions; whereas the seeing, hearing, etc. \[i.e., the
particularising senses\] of the sentient being diversify \[on its own
account\] the activity of Tathâgatas.

Now this activity \[in another word, the Dharmakâya\] has a twofold
aspect. The first one depends on the
phenomena-particularising-consciousness, by means of which the activity
is conceived by the minds of common people (*prthagjana*), Çrâvakas, and
Pratyekabuddhas. This aspect is called the Body of Transformation
(*nirmânakâya*).

But as the beings of this class do not know that the Body of
Transformation is merely the shadow \[or reflection\] of their own
evolving-consciousness (*pravrtti-vijñâna*), they imagine that it comes
from some external sources, and so they give it a corporeal limitation.
But the Body of Transformation \[or what amounts to the same thing, the
Dharmakâya\] has nothing to do with limitation and measurement. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md)

The second aspect \[of the Dharmakâya\] depends on the
activity-consciousness (*karmavijñâna*) by means of which the activity
is conceived by the minds of

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Bodhisattvas while passing from their first
aspiration (*cittotpâda*) stage up to the height of Bodhisattvahood.
This is called the Body of Bliss (*sambhogakâya*).

The body has infinite forms. The form has infinite attributes. The
attribute has infinite excellencies. And the accompanying rewards <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) of Bodhisattvas, that is, the region
where they are predestined to be born \[by their previous karma\], also
has infinite merits and ornamentations. Manifesting itself everywhere,
the Body of Bliss is infinite, boundless, limitless, unintermittent \[in
its action\], directly coming forth from the mind. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md)

All these merits being actualised through the perfuming of such spotless
deeds as the pâramitâs <span id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146.md), etc., as
well as through the incomprehensible perfuming power \[of enlightenment
*a priori*\], the Sambhogakâya

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

embraces infinite attributes of bliss and merit. Therefore it is also
called the Body of Reward.

What is recognised by common people (*prthagjana*), etc., is the
coarsest form of the activity of the Dharmakâya. There is a variety of
it according to the six different states of creation. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) It has no attributes of infinite merits
and blessings.

What is recognised by Bodhisattvas at the first stage is a finer form of
the activity of the Dharmakâya. As they firmly believe in suchness, they
can have a partial insight into it, and understand that the Body of the
Tathâgata is not departing, is not coming, is free from arrest <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148.md) \[i.e., the Tathâgata's work is eternal
and constant\], that every thing is but a reflected shadow of the mind,
not independent of suchness. But these Bodhisattvas have not yet freed
themselves from the finest form of particularisation, because they have
not yet entered into the order of the Dharmakâya.

Bodhisattvas at the stage of pure-heartedness are able to recognise the
finer form of the activity \[of the Dharmakâya\]. Their insight is more
penetrating than the former. When they reach the height of
Bodhisattvahood their insight becomes perfect.

By the finer form of the activity we understand

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the Body of Bliss (*sambhogakâya*). As long as they are possessed by the
activity-consciousness, they would conceive the Body of Bliss. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md) But when they are liberated from it, all
traces of individuation would become obliterated. Because all Tathâgatas
come from \[one and the same\] Dharmakâya, have no distinction of
this-ness and that-ness, have no corporeal forms that are characterised
by reciprocal limitation.

A question arises here: If the Dharmakâya of Buddhas is devoid of
variously differentiated corporeal forms, how is it that it can manifest
itself in various corporeal forms at all?

In reply we say: The Dharmakâya can manifest itself in various corporeal
forms just because it is the real essence of them. Matter (*rûpa*) and
mind (*citta*) from the very beginning are not a duality. So we speak of
\[the universe as\] a system of rationality (*prajñakâya*), seeing that
the real nature of matter just constitutes the norm of mind. Again we
speak of \[the universe as\] a system of materiality (*dharmakâya*),
seeing that the true nature of mind just constitutes the norm of
matter. <span id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150.md)

Now depending on the Dharmakâya, all Tathâgatas manifest themselves in
bodily forms and are incessantly

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

present at all points of space. <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md)
And Bodhisattvas in the ten quarters, according to their capabilities
and wishes, are able to manifest infinite Bodies of Bliss and infinite
lands of ornamentation, each one of which, though stamped with the marks
of individuality, does not hinder the others from being fused into it,
and this \[mutual fusion\] has no interruption.

But the manifestation of the Dharmakâya in \[infinite\] bodily forms is
not comprehensible to the thought and understanding of common-people;
because it is the free and subtlest activity of suchness. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md)

Again, in order that all beings might be induced to step forward from
the gate of birth-and-death to that of suchness, we endeavor to let them
understand that those modes of existence such as matter (*rûpa*), etc.
\[i.e., the five skandhas\] <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) are
imperfect.

Why are they imperfect?

When we divide some gross \[or composite\] matter, we can reduce it to
atoms (*anu*). But as the atom will also be subject to further division,
all forms of material existence, whether gross or fine, are nothing but
the shadow of particularisation produced by a subjective mind, and we
cannot ascribe any degree of \[absolute, or independent\] reality to
them.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

Let us next go over to and examine the other skandhas \[that have
temporal existence\]. We find there too that we can gradually reduce
them to kshanas \[i.e., infinitesimal divisions of time\], whose nature,
however closely scrutinised, does not give any sign of \[indivisible\]
oneness.

It is even the same with the objects of non-aggregate
(*asamskrta-dharma*). <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) They cannot
have their own existence independent of the universe (*dharmadhâtu*). Be
it therefore understood that the same may be said in regard to all
objects without exception in the ten quarters of space. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155.md)

As a lost man who takes the east for the west,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

while the quarter is not changed on account of his confusion, so all
beings, because of their misleading ignorance, imagine that the mind is
being disturbed, while in reality it is not.

But when they understand that the disturbance of the mind \[i.e.,
birth-and-death\] is \[at the same time\] immortality \[viz.,
suchness\], they would then enter into the gate of suchness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_136"></span>[96:1](taf23.htm#fr_136.md) These four qualities
are usually considered by Mahâyânists to be those of Nirvâna as well.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[96:2](taf23.htm#fr_137.md) Observe here again
that Dharmakâya is used in a sense quite different from its ordinary
interpretation as the "Body of the Law."

<span id="fn_138"></span>[99:1](taf23.htm#fr_138.md) The older translation
reads: "For they consider all sentient beings as their own self and do
not cling to their individual forms. How is this? Because they know
truthfully that all sentient beings as well as their own self come from
one and the same suchness, and no distinction can be established among
them."

<span id="fn_139"></span>[99:2](taf23.htm#fr_139.md) Cf. the second, third,
fourth, fifth, and seventh chapter of the Saddharma-pundarîka Sûtra, in
which Buddha preaches about the means of salvation.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[99:3](taf23.htm#fr_140.md) That is, "action in
inaction and inaction in action."

<span id="fn_141"></span>[99:4](taf23.htm#fr_141.md) Açvaghosha's
conception of religious life as identical in its essence with poetry or
fine art, I think, closely resembles that of Kant who says in his
Critique of judgment that the production of fine art should appear as if
the work of nature. To quote his own words: "Als Natur aber erscheint
ein Produkt der Kunst dadurch, dass zwar alle Pünktlichkeit in der
Uebereinkunft mit Regeln, nach denen allein das Produkt das werden kann,
was es sein soll, angetroffen wird, aber ohne Peinlichkeit, d. i., ohne
eine Spur zu zeigen, dass die Regel dem Künstler vor Augen geschwebt und
seinen Gemüthskräften Fesseln angelegt habe." (*Kritik der
Urtheilskraft*, Kirchmann's edition, p. 169.)

<span id="fn_142"></span>[99:5](taf23.htm#fr_142.md) Cf. *Vajracchedikâ*,
Chap. XVII: "And why, O Subhûti, the <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>
name of Tathâgata? It expresses true suchness (*bhûtatathatâ*). . . . It
expresses that he had no origin. . . . It expresses the destruction of
all qualities (*dharma*). . . . It expresses one who had no origin
whatever. . . . Because, O Subhûti, no-origin is the highest goal,"

<span id="fn_143"></span>[100:1](taf23.htm#fr_143.md) The older translation
reads simply: "They cannot thoroughly understand it \[i.e., the true
nature of the *Nirmânakâya*.\]"

<span id="fn_144"></span>[101:1](taf23.htm#fr_144.md) Buddhists distinguish
two kinds of the retribution which we receive as the fruit of karma
previously accumulated by ourselves: the first one called "principal" is
our bodily existence; the second called "accompanying" is the region
where we are destined to be born.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[101:2](taf23.htm#fr_145.md) The older translation
has: "It is boundless, cannot be exhausted, is free from the signs of
limitation. Manifesting itself wherever it should manifest itself, it
always exists by itself and is never destroyed or lost."

<span id="fn_146"></span>[101:3](taf23.htm#fr_146.md) The six Pâramitâs are
commonly enumerated: (1) charity (*dâna*); (2) morality (*çîla*); (3)
patience (*ksânti*); (4) energy (*vîrya*); (5) meditation (*dhyâna*);
(6) wisdom (*prajñâ*). When we speak of the ten Pâramitâs, the following
four are to be added: expediency (*upâya*); prayer or vow
(*pranidhâna*); strength (*bala*); knowledge (*jñâna*). An explanation
of the six Pâramitâs is given below.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[102:1](taf23.htm#fr_147.md) The six states of
creation (*gati*) are: (1) *Deva* (gods); (2) *Manushya* (men); (3)
*Asura* (demons); (4) *Preta* (ghosts); (5) *Tiryagryoni* (animals); (6)
*Nâraka* (inhabitants of hell).

<span id="fn_148"></span>[102:2](taf23.htm#fr_148.md) Cf. the
*Vajracchedikâ Sûtra*, Chap. XXIX (*Sacred Books of the East*, Vol.
XLIX., p. 142).

<span id="fn_149"></span>[103:1](taf23.htm#fr_149.md) The last two
sentences are missing in the older translation.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[103:2](taf23.htm#fr_150.md) Cf. the following
passages from the *Prajñâ-pâramitâ-hrdaya Sûtra*: "Form (*rûpa*) is
emptiness (*çûnyatâ*), and emptiness is indeed form. Emptiness is not
different from form, form is not different from emptiness. What is form
that is emptiness, what is emptiness that is form."

<span id="fn_151"></span>[104:1](taf23.htm#fr_151.md) The older
translation: "Therefore it is preached that the Dharmakâya is
omnipresent. The corporeal forms by which it manifests itself have no
limitation."

<span id="fn_152"></span>[104:2](taf23.htm#fr_152.md) This passage is
missing in the older translation.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[104:3](taf23.htm#fr_153.md) They are matter
(*rûpa*); sensation (*vedanâ*); idea ([*samjñâ*](errata.htm#9).md); action
(*samskâra*); and consciousness ([*vijñâna*](errata.htm#10).md).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[105:1](taf23.htm#fr_154.md) All phenomena in the
world, physical as well as mental, are divided into two great classes:
(1) *Samskrtadharma*, i.e., that which consists of parts temporal or
spatial; (2) *Asamskrtadharma*, i.e., that which does not consist of
parts. The first class is subdivided into four principal departments
which are also subject to a further subdivision, seventy-two in the
Hînayâna system (according to the *Abhidharmakoça-çâstra*), and
ninety-four in the Mahâyâna (according to the
*Vijñânamâtrasiddhi-çâstra*). The four principal departments are: (1)
*Rûpa* (physical phenomena); (2) *Citta* (thought or understanding); (3)
*Caittadharma* or *Cittasamprayuktasamskâra* (mental phenomena); (4)
*Cittaviprayuktasamskâra* (that which does not belong to the former,
namely, relation that obtains among things). As for the second class,
*Asamskrtadharma*, Mahâyânists subdivide it into six while Hînayânists
subdivide it into three. For details see the two Çâstras above
mentioned.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[105:2](taf23.htm#fr_155.md) The last five
paragraphs are missing in the older translation which has simply this
instead: "The external world which consists in the six objects of sense
does not exist independently of our mind, and the mind having no forms
and attributes cannot be grasped even if we search for it throughout the
ten quarters."
