#### *1. The Revelation of the True Doctrine*.

In the one soul we may distinguish two aspects.

The one is the Soul as suchness (*bhûtatathatâ*), the other is the soul
as birth-and-death (*samsâra*). Each in itself constitutes all things,
and both are so closely interrelated that one cannot be separated from
the other.
