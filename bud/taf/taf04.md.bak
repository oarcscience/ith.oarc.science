# NOTE.

The method of transliteration for Sanskrit words adopted in the present
book is one used in Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar, but from lack of type
*sh* has been substituted for *ṣ*, *r* for the vowel *ṛ*, *n* for all
the different kinds of nasal *n*'s, and *m* for *ṁ*. Further, no
distinction has been made in the footnotes between the dentals and the
cerebrals; *c* and *ç* are also often used indiscriminately there.

As to the method of transliteration for Chinese words, almost every
Sinologue has his own; but the one used in this book is that of Sir T.
Wade, which I think has been adopted more generally than others.
