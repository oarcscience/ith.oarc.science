### IV. PRACTICE OF FAITH.

In what does the practice of faith (*çraddhâ*) consist?

This part of the Discourse is intended for those beings who have not yet
entered into the order of constant truth (*samyaktvaniyata-râçi*).

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

What is meant by faith? How should one practise faith?

There are four aspects of faith. \[As to faith in general\]: (1) To
believe in the fundamental \[truth\], that is, to think joyfully of
suchness (*bhûtatathatâ*). \[As to particular faiths:\] (2) To believe
in the Buddha as sufficingly enveloping infinite merits, that is, to
rejoice in worshipping him, in paying homage to him, in making offerings
to him, in hearing the good doctrine (*saddharma*), in disciplining
oneself according to the doctrine, and in aspiring after omniscience
(*sarvajñâna*). (3) To believe in the Dharma as having great benefits,
that is, to rejoice always in practising all pâramitâs. (4) To believe
in the Samgha as observing true morality, that is, to be ready to make
offerings to the congregation of Bodhisattvas, and to practise
truthfully all those deeds which are beneficial at once to oneself and
others.

Faith will be perfected by practising the following five deeds: (1)
charity (*dâna*); (2) morality (*çîla*),(3) patience (*kshânti*); (4)
energy (*vîrya*); (5) cessation \[or tranquilisation, *çamatha*\] and
intellectual insight (*vidarçana* or *vipaçyana*).

How should people practise charity (*dâna*)?

\(1\) If persons come and ask them for something, they should, as far as
their means allow, supply it ungrudgingly and make them rejoice in it.
(2) If they see people threatened with danger, they should try every
means of rescuing them and impart to them a

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

feeling of fearlessness (*vaiçâradya*). (3) If they have people who come
to them desiring instruction in the Doctrine, they should, so far as
they are acquainted with it, and, according to their own discretion,
deliver speeches on religious discipline.

And when they are performing those three acts of charity, let them not
cherish any desire for fame or advantages, nor covet any worldly
rewards. Only thinking of those benefits and blessings that are at once
for themselves and others, let them aspire to the most excellent, most
perfect knowledge (*anuttarasamyaksambodhi*).

How should they practise morality (*çîla*)?

Those Bodhisattvas who have families \[i.e., lay members of Buddhism\]
should abstain from killing, stealing, adultery, lying, duplicity,
slander, frivolous talk, covetousness, malice, currying favor, and false
doctrines. <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

In the case of Çramanas, they should, in order to vanquish all
prejudices (*kleça* or *âçrava*), retire from the boisterousness of
worldly life, and, abiding in solitude (*aranya*), should practise those
deeds which lead to moderation and contentment as well as those of the
Dhûtaguna. <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) Even at the violation
of minor

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

rules (*çila*) they should deeply feel fear, shame, and remorse.
Strictly observing all those precepts given by the Tathâgata, they
should not call forth the blame or disgust of the outsider, but they
should endeavor to induce all beings to abandon the evil and to practise
the good. <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md)

How should they practise patience (*kshânti*)?

If they meet with the ills of life they should not

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

shun them. If they suffer sufferings, they should not feel afflicted.
But they should always rejoice in contemplating the deepest significance
of the Dharma. <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187.md)

How should they practise energy (*vîrya*)?

Practising all good deeds, they should never indulge in indolence
(*kausîdya*). They should think of all their great mental and physical
sufferings, which they are now vainly suffering on account of their
having coveted worldly objects during their existences in innumerable
former ages (*kalpa*), and which do not give the least nourishment to
their spiritual life. They should, therefore, in order to be emancipated
from those sufferings in the future, be indefatigably energetic, and
never raise the thought of indolence, but endeavor, out of deep
compassion (*mahâkaruna*), to benefit all beings. Though disciplining
themselves in faith, all novice Bodhisattvas, on account of the
hindrances of their evil karma (*karmâvarana*) produced by the violation
of many important precepts in their previous existences, may sometimes
be annoyed by evil Mâras, sometimes entangled in worldly engagements,
sometimes threatened by various diseases. As these things will severally
disturb their religious course and make them neglect practising good
deeds, they should dauntlessly, energetically, unintermittently, all

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

six watches, day and night, pay homage to all Buddhas, make offerings
(*pûjâ*) to them, praise them, repent and confess (*kshamâ*) to them,
aspire to the most excellent knowledge (*samyaksambodhi*), make great
vows (*mahâpranidhâna*); and thereby annihilate the hindrances of evils
and increase the root of merit (*kuçalamûla*).

How should they practise cessation \[or tranquilisation, *çamatha*\] and
intellectual insight (*vidarçana* or *vipaçyana*)?

To bring all mental states that produce frivolous sophistries to a stand
is called cessation. To understand adequately the law of causality and
transformation is called intellectual insight. Each of them should be
practised separately by the beginner. But when by degrees he obtains
facility and finally attains to perfection, the two will naturally
become harmonised. <span id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_188.md)

Those who practise cessation should dwell in solitude (*âranyaka*) and,
sitting cross-legged <span id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_189.md) rectify the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

attitude and pacify the mind. <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_190.md) Do
not fix the thoughts on the breath (*ânâpânasmrti*) <span
id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_191.md); do not fix the thoughts on the forms
([*samjñâ*](errata.htm#22)) <span id="fr_192"></span>[3](#fn_192.md) and
colors; do not fix the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

thoughts on space (*âkâça*); <span id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) do
not fix the thoughts on earth, water, fire, and ether; <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) do not fix the thoughts on what you see,
hear, learn, or memorise (*vijñânakrtsnâyatana*) <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_193.md). All particularisations, imaginations
and recollections should be excluded from consciousness, even the idea
of exclusion being excluded; because \[the suchness of\] all things is
uncreate, eternal, and devoid of all attributes (*alakshana*).

\[Now in the constant flux of thoughts,\] that which precedes \[i.e., a
sensation\] has been awakened by an external object; so the next \[step
to be taken by the practiser\] is to abandon the idea of an external
world. Then that which succeeds \[in that constant flux of thoughts\] is
elaborated in his own mind; so he should in turn abandon reflexion \[or
thought\]. In short, as his attention is distracted by the external
world \[outer *vishaya*\], he is warned to turn it to inner
consciousness \[inner *citta*\]; while as his retrospection in turn
calls forth a succession of thoughts \[or ideal associations\], he is
again warned not to attach himself to the latter; because, independent
of suchness, they \[thoughts\] have no existence of their own.

At all times, while moving, standing, sitting, or

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

lying, the practiser should constantly discipline himself as above
stated. Gradually entering the samâdhi of suchness, <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) he will finally vanquish all prejudices
(*kleça* or *âçrava*), be strengthened in faith (*çraddhâ*),--and
immediately attain to the state of never-returning (*avaivartikatva*).
But those who are sceptical, sacrilegious, destitute of faith,
encumbered with the hindrances (*âvarana*) of karma, arrogant, or
indolent, are not entitled to enter therein.

And again when the practiser by virtue of his samâdhi <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) attains an immediate insight into the
nature of the universe (*dharmadhâtu*), he will recognise that the
Dharmakâya of all Tathâgatas and the body of all beings are one and the
same (*samatâ*), are consubstantial (ekalakshana). On that account it is
also called the samâdhi of oneness (*ekalakshanasamâdhi*). By
disciplining oneself in this samâdhi, one can obtain infinite

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

samâdhis, because suchness is the source of all samâdhis.

Some people scantily supplied with the root of merit (*kuçalamûla*) may
yield to the temptation of Mâras, tîrthakas, or evil spirits. \[For
instance\] those evil ones sometimes assuming horrible forms may
frighten the practiser; sometimes manifesting themselves in beautiful
figures, they may fascinate him; <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_196.md)
sometimes appearing in form of a deva, or of a Boddhisattva, or even of
a Buddha with all his excellent and magnified features, <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) they may speak about *dhârani* <span
id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_198.md) or the pâramitâ, or may give
instructions about various means of emancipation (*mukti*), declaring
that there is no hatred, no friendship, no causation, no

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

retribution, or declaring that all things in the world are absolute
nothingness (*atyantaçûnyatâ*), that they are in their essence Nirvâna
itself. Or they may reveal to the practiser his own past and future
states of existence, they may teach him to read the thoughts of
others, <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) may grant him incomparable
power of eloquence, may induce him to crave covetously for worldly fame
and advantages.

Further, through the influence of those evil ones the practiser may
sometimes be inordinately susceptible to dissatisfaction or delight; he
may sometimes be too misanthropic or too philanthropic; he may sometimes
be inclined to enjoy drowsiness; he may sometimes not sleep for a long
time; he may sometimes be affected by diseases; be may sometimes remain
discouraged and indolent; he may sometimes rise all on a sudden with
full energy, but only to sink down again into languor; he may sometimes,
being over-sceptical, not believe in anything; he may sometimes,
abandoning the excellent religious observance, enjoy himself in
frivolous occupations, indulge in worldly affairs, gratify his desires
and inclinations;

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

he may sometimes attain to the samâdhi of heretics \[i.e., tîrthaka\]
and, remaining in a state of trance a day or two, or even seven, and
being supplied imaginarily with some palatable food and drink, and
feeling very comfortable mentally and physically, he may have no
sensation of hunger or thirst; <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) he
may sometimes be induced to enjoy female fascinations; he may sometimes
be very irregular in taking meals, either too much or too little; he may
sometimes look either very handsome or very ugly in appearance.

If the practiser get enraptured by those visions and prejudices
(*kleça*), he will lose his root of merit (*kuçalamûla*) accumulated in
his previous existences. Therefore he should exercise a deep and
thorough contemplation, thinking that all those \[heretical states of
samâdhi\] are the temptations of Mâras or evil spirits that take
advantage of his deficiency in merits and his intensity of
karma-hindrances (*karmâvarana*).

After this thought he should make another thought, viz., that all these
are nothing but mental hallucinations. When he makes these thoughts, the
visions and imaginations will instantly disappear, and, becoming free
from all attributes \[of limitation\], be will enter into the true
samâdhi. He has then not only liberated himself from all modes of
subjectivity, he has also effaced the idea of suchness. Even when

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

he rises up from a deep meditation, no visionary images, no prejudices
will take possession of in his mind, since he has destroyed the root of
illusion through the power of the samâdhi. On the contrary, all the
excellent and virtuous deeds which are in conformity with suchness will
be constantly performed by him, while all hindrances without exception
will be removed by him, who now exhibiting great spiritual energy will
never become exhausted. <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_201.md)

Those who do not practise this kind of samâdhi will not be able to enter
into the essence of the Tathâgata, for all other samâdhis practised in
common with the tîrthakas have invariably some attributes \[of
imperfection\] and do not enable one to come into the presence of
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Therefore let Bodhisattvas \[who aspire to the
highest knowledge\] assiduously apply themselves to the discipline and
attain to the perfection of this samâdhi.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Those who practise this samâdhi will procure in their present life ten
beneficial results:

1\. They will always be remembered and guarded by all Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas in all quarters.

2\. They will not be molested by Mâras or evil spirits.

3\. They will not be led astray by false doctrines. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_202.md)

4\. They will be free from disparaging the deepest Doctrine
(*gambhîradharma*). Their serious misdemeanors as well as their
karma-hindrances will be attenuated.

5 . They will destroy all doubts, sinful recollections, and
contemplations.

6\. They will be strengthened in their belief in the spiritual state of
Tathâgata.

7\. They will be liberated from gloomy remorse; they will be courageous
and unflinching in the face of birth and death.

8\. Being free from arrogance and presumptuousness, they will be meek
and patient and will be revered by all the world.

9\. If not practising deep meditation, those prejudices (*âçrava*) which
are now getting weaker, will not assert themselves in them.

10\. While practising meditation, they will not be disturbed by any
external objects, such as voices, sounds, etc.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

But mind: when the practiser is trained only in cessation (*çamatha*),
his mind will sink down into stupidity, and acquiring a habit of
indolence, cannot rejoice in doing good acts, as he will estrange
himself from deep compassion (mahâkaruna). Accordingly he should
discipline himself in intellectual insight (*vidarçana*) as well.

In what does this discipline consist?

The practiser should contemplate that all things in the world are
subject to a constant transformation, that since they are transient they
are misery, that since they are misery they are not things-in-themselves
\[i.e., atman\]. <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)

He should contemplate that all things in the past are like a dream,
those in the present are like the lightning, those in the future are
like clouds that spontaneously come into existence.

He should contemplate that all that has a body is impure, being a
lodging place of obnoxious vermin and the intermixture of prejudices
(*âçrava*).

Contemplate that ignorant minds, on account of their groundless
imagination, take the unreal as they see it, for reality.

Contemplate that all objects which come into existence by a combination
of various causes (*pratyaya*)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

are like a chimera, having \[only a transitory existence and\] no
\[genuine\] realness at all.

Contemplate that the highest truth (*paramârthasatya*) is not a
production of mind \[or subjectivity\], cannot be \[fully\] illustrated
by analogy, cannot be \[exhaustively\] treated by reasoning. <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_204.md)

Contemplate that on account of the perfuming power of ignorance
(*avidya*) all beings from eternity suffer great mental and physical
sufferings in immeasurable ways; that those immeasurable and innumerable
sufferings are suffered in the present and will be suffered in the
future that while it is extremely difficult to disentangle, to
emancipate themselves from those sufferings, all beings always abiding
in the midst of them are not conscious of the fact, and this makes them
the more pitiable.

After these contemplations the practiser should awake positive knowledge
\[or unerring understanding\], feel the highest and deepest compassion
([*karunâ*](errata.htm#23).md) for all suffering beings, rouse dauntless
energy, and make great vows (*mahâpranidhâna*) as follows:

"May my mind be freed from all contradictions; may I abandon
particularisation; may I personally attend on all Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas, whom I shall pay homage to, make offerings to, revere and
praise, and to whose instructions in the good Doctrine (*saddharma*) I
shall listen; may I truthfully discipline myself according to their
teachings, and to the end of

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

the future never be negligent in self-discipline; may I with innumerable
expediencies (*upâya*) \[of salvation\] deliver all beings who are
drowned in the sea of misery, and bring them to the highest bliss of
Nirvâna."

After these vows the practiser should at all times, so far as his energy
permits, practise those deeds which are beneficial both to himself and
others. While moving, standing, sitting, or lying, he should assiduously
meditate what should be done and what should be avoided. This is called
the practising of intellectual insight (*vidarçana* or *vipaçyana*).

And again when the practiser disciplines himself only in intellectual
insight his mind may lack tranquilisation, and becoming too susceptible
to scepticism, may not be in accord with the highest truth, may not
attain to the wisdom of non-particularisation. Therefore cessation and
intellectual insight should be practised side by side. He should
consider that nothing is self-existent (*svabhâva*), and things \[in
their essence\] are uncreate, eternally tranquil, and Nirvâna itself.
But at the same time let him not forget to reflect that karma and its
retribution, both good and evil, being produced by a co-operation of
principle and conditions, will neither be lost nor destroyed. He should
thus ponder on the law of causation, both in its good and evil karma and
retribution, but at the same time lei him not forget to perceive that
all things, though in their essence uncreate, have no self-existence,
etc., they are Nirvâna.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

By practising cessation, common people (*prthagjana*) will be cured of
finding pleasures in worldliness, while Çrâvakas and Pratyekabuddhas
will be cured of feeling intimidation at the thought of birth and death.

By practising intellectual insight common people will be cured of not
cultivating their root of merit (*kuçalamûla*), while Çrâvakas and
Pratyekabuddhas will be cured of narrow-mindedness whereby they cannot
raise deep compassion \[for mankind\].

Therefore, cessation and-intellectual insight are supplementary to, not
independent of, each other. If one of the two is wanting, the practiser
will surely be unable to attain to the most [excellent](errata.htm#24.md)
knowledge (*bodhiparinishpatti*).

And again when those novice Bodhisattvas who are living in this present
life \[*sahâlokadhâtu*, i.e., the enduring world of actual existence\],
may sometimes suffer misfortunes that are caused by climate, weather,
unforeseen famine, or what not; and when they witness those people who
are immoral, fearful, infatuated with the three venomous passions
(*akuçalamûla*), cling to false and self-contradictory doctrines, desert
the good law and acquire evil habits; they \[that is, novice
Bodhisattvas\], living in the midst of them, may feel so discouraged
that they may come to doubt whether they can see Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas, whether they can actualise their pure and spotless faith
(*çraddhâ*).

Therefore, it is advisable for those novices to cherish

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

this thought: All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the ten quarters having
great, unimpeded supernatural powers (*abhijñâ*), are able to emancipate
all suffering beings by means of various expediencies that are good and
excellent (*upâyakauçalya*).

After this reflexion, they should make great vows (*mahâpranidhâna*),
and with full concentration of spiritual powers think of Buddhas and
Bodhisattvas When they have such a firm conviction, free from all
doubts, they will assuredly be able to be born in the Buddha-country
beyond (*buddha-kshetra*), when they pass away from this present life,
and seeing there Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, to complete their faith and
to eternally escape from all evil creations (*apâya*). <span
id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_205.md)

Therefore, it is said in the Sûtra <span id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_206.md)
that if devoted

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

men and women would be filled with concentration of thought, think of
Amitâbha Buddha in the world of highest happiness (*sukhâvatî*) in the
Western region, and direct (*parinâma*) all the root of their good work
toward being born there, they would assuredly be born there.

Thus always seeing Buddhas there, their faith will be strengthened, and
they will never relapse therefrom. Receiving instruction in the
doctrine, and recognising the Dharmakâya of the Buddha, they will by
gradual discipline be able to enter upon the state of truth \[i.e.,
Buddhahood\] (*samyaktva-râçi*).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_184"></span>[129:1](taf28.htm#fr_184.md) Açvaghosha evidently
refers to the ten virtues (*daçakuçalâni*), for which see [p.
114](taf27.htm#page_114.md), though this list counts more than ten.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[129:2](taf28.htm#fr_185.md) There are twelve
dhûtagunas or dhûtagangas to be observed by Bhikshus; *dhûta* means
shaking off, that is, shaking off the dust of evil passions: (1)
*Paindapâtika*, the rule to live on whatever food they can get by
begging from door to door, that they <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
may become free from egotism. (2) *Traicîvarika*, the rule allowing the
possession of three clothings: *Samghâti*, dress made of scraps;
*Uttarasamghâti*, outer robe; *Antaravâsaka*, something like skirt. (3)
*Khalupaçcâdbhahtika*, the prohibition of taking any food or beverage
when the proper time is over, lest their attention should be disturbed.
(4) *Naishadhyika*, to be in a sitting attitude while sleeping, that
they may not become over-indolent. (5) *Yathâsamstarika*, spreading a
night-couch where they happen to be. (6) *Vrkshamûlika*, sitting under a
tree. (7) *Ekâsanika*, taking one meal in a day, that their mental
energy may not be weakened by eating too often. (8) *Abhyavakâçika*,
living in an unsheltered place. (9) *Aranyaka*, leading a solitary,
retired life in the wood. (10) *Cmâçânaka*, abiding in or by a cemetery,
that they may constantly ponder on the transiency and uncleanliness of
bodily existence. (11) *Pâmskûlika*, the wearing of the dress made of
rags or remnants, that they may have no attachment to luxury. (12)
*Nâmatika*, wearing cloth made of hair. There is a Sûtra named *Twelve
Dhûtagunas* among the Chinese collection of the Tripitaka. The list in
that book is a little different from what we have here; the fifth and
twelfth are dropped and instead of them we have the rule of begging in
due order, corresponding to *Sâpadâna-cârikâ* in the Pâli list, and the
rule of prohibiting taking too much food at one time, which overtaxing
the stomach will obscure the clearness of mind.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[130:1](taf28.htm#fr_186.md) The reference is to
the threefold precept (*trividhaçîla*) which is (1) the precept of good
behavior (*sambhâraçîla*); (2) the precept of accumulating virtues
(*kuçalasamgrâhaçîla*); (3) the precept of being benevolent towards all
beings (*sattvârthakriyâçîla*).

<span id="fn_187"></span>[131:1](taf28.htm#fr_187.md) The older translation
reads: "Patiently bearing evils inflicted by others, they should not
cherish any idea of revenge. They should also bear such \[worldly
vicissitudes\] as prosperity and decline, reprehension and commendation,
renown and defamation, worry and ease, etc."

<span id="fn_188"></span>[132:1](taf28.htm#fr_188.md) Observe that
cessation should be practised by the beginner, and for a time only, for
the purpose of affording the mind an appreciation of suchness in its
purity; the conception of this state of abstraction should then be
harmonised with intellectual insight. Observe also that the methods of
Indian recluses, such as fixing the breath and going into trances by
fixing the thoughts on objects, are rejected as improper. The practice
should assist a beginner to understand that suchness, though all
particulars are dependent on it, is in its purity a reality.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[132:2](taf28.htm#fr_189.md) Those who practise
this have to place the left leg above the right with both close to the
body, so that the toes of the left foot shall rest on the right thigh,
and those of the right foot on the left thigh, while the soles are
turned upwards. This posture is considered to be the best adapted for
meditation or for obtaining mental equilibrium.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[133:1](taf28.htm#fr_190.md) Among the followers
of the Dhyâna sect both in Japan and China, it is customary, while
sitting cross-legged and meditating on religious subjects, to expand the
abdomen outwards and to breathe very slowly, by which they can, in their
opinion, most effectively concentrate their attention and gain perfect
mental equilibrium. Prof. J. M. Baldwin in his *Mental Development* says
in connexion with bashfulness and modesty, p. 205 footnote: ''The only
way that I, for one, can undo this distressing outgo of energy, and
relieve these uncomfortable inhibitions, is to expand the abdomen by a
strong muscular effort and at the same time breathe in as deeply as I
can. . . . The comparative relief found in expanding the abdominal
muscles is probably due to the fact that it allows the contents of the
body to fall, and so relieves the heart from any artificial pressure
which may be upon it from the surrounding organs. Further the increased
heart-action which is itself a part of shyness requires all the space it
can get."

<span id="fn_191"></span>[133:2](taf28.htm#fr_191.md) One of the eight
subjects of recollection (*anusmrti*), or of the five methods of mental
pacification. The eight subjects are: (1) Buddha; (2) dharma; (3)
samgha; (4) *çîla*, morality; (5) *câga* or *tyâga*, liberality; (6)
*deva*, gods; (7) ânâpâna, regulation of inspiration and respiration;
(8) *marana*, death. The five methods are: (1) *Açubhabhâvanâ*,
contemplation on the impurity of the body; (2) *maitrîkarunâ*, love and
compassion; (3) *ânâpânasmrti*, the regulation of inspiration and
respiration; (4) *nidâna*, law of transformation; (5) *buddhasmrti*,
recollection on Buddha.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[133:3](taf28.htm#fr_192.md) There are nine
Açbhasamjnâs, notions arising from the contemplation of the impurity of
a dead body, which is intended to convince one of the fact that our body
is not worth while clinging to: (1) Swelling (*vyâdhmataka*); (2)
fissuring from decay (*vipayaka*); (3) bloody (*vilohita*); (4)
festering (*vipadumaka*); (5) blackish (*vinîlaka*); (6) being devoured
by animals (*vikhâditaka*); (7) scattering (*vikshiptaka*); (8) bone
(*asthi*); (9) burned up (*vidagdhaka*). The Pâli Açubhas count one
more.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[134:1](taf28.htm#fr_195.md) These constitute the
ten *Krtsâyatanas* which are: (1) Blue (*nîla*); (2) yellow (*pîta*);
(3) red (*lohita*); (4) white (*avadâta*); (5) earth (*prtivî*); (6)
water (*ap*); (7) fire (*tejas*); (8) air (*vâyu*); (9) space (*âkâsa*);
(10) consciousness (*vijñâna*). The term *Krtsâyâtana* means an
universal object or element on which the attention of a
samâdhi-practiser is to be fixed.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[135:1](taf28.htm#fr_196.md) That is, perfect
identification of oneself with suchness.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[135:2](taf28.htm#fr_197.md) *Samâdhi* is commonly
rendered by ecstasy, trance, concentration, or meditation, all of which
are misleading. The term means mental equilibrium, and the reasons why
Buddhism recommends the practising of it are, that it helps us in
keeping our minds free from disturbance, that it prepares us for a right
comprehension of the nature of things, that it subjugates momentary
impulses, giving us time for deliberation. Ecstasy or trance, instead of
producing those benefits, will lead us to a series of hallucinations,
and this is the very opposite of mental quietude. Rhys Davids thinks
samâdhi corresponds to faith in Christianity (*S. B. E.*, XI., p. 145),
and S. Beal agrees with him in his translation of Açvaghosha's
*Buddhacarita*; but I doubt its correctness for the above-stated
reasons.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[136:1](taf28.htm#fr_198.md) The older translation
has the following passage inserted here. "If he \[the practiser\]
remembers that these are merely subjective, the phenomena will disappear
by themselves and will no more trouble him."

<span id="fn_197"></span>[136:2](taf28.htm#fr_199.md) Buddha is supposed to
have thirty-two general and eighty minor marks of bodily perfection. For
particulars see the *Dharmasamgraha*, pp. 18, 19, 51 et seq., edited by
Kasawara Kenjiu.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[136:3](taf28.htm#fr_200.md) *Dhârani*, which
comes from the root *dhr*, meaning to bold, to maintain, to retain, to
support, etc., is the name given to any concise statement describing
Buddha's virtue, or stating some essential points of Buddhist teachings,
or expressing supplication, or containing the exclamations of a vehement
feeling; and it implies many significances in a few words, it is a kind
of epigram. But later Buddhists came to use the term in quite a
different sense; they called a dhârani any tantric expression which was
considered to have some mysterious, supernatural powers to bring wealth
to destroy enemies, to keep away calamities, etc., etc. Here *dhârani*
means simply any epigrammatic proposition which will serve as a key to
the deep significance of the Doctrine.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[137:1](taf28.htm#fr_201.md) Some of these
miraculous powers here mentioned are considered to be possessed by the
Arhat. Six supernatural faculties (*abhijnâ*) are commonly enumerated:
(1) divine eyes (*divyacakshu*) by which the Arhat perceives all that is
occurring in the world; (2) the divine hearing (*divyaçrotra*), by which
he hears all sounds in the world; (3) reading the thoughts of others
(paracittajnâna); (4) memory of his former lives
(*pûrvanivâsânu-smrti*); (5) miraculous powers (*rddhi*); (6) knowledge
how to destroy evil passions (*âçravakshaya*).

<span id="fn_200"></span>[138:1](taf28.htm#fr_202.md) This apparently
alludes to the Yoga-praxis, by which man is said to be able to perform
several sorts of miracles beside those mentioned here.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[139:1](taf28.htm#fr_203.md) The two preceding
paragraphs read in the older translation as follows: "On this account,
the practiser, always exercising intellectual insight, should save his
mind from being entangled in the netting of falsity; he should, dwelling
in right contemplation, not cling or attach \[to any object\], and
thereby he will be able to liberate himself from all kinds of
karma-hindrance. It should be known that all samâdhis practised by
heretics \[i.e., tîrthaka\] are invariably the production of the
(egoistic\] conception and desire and self-assumption, that they are
hankering after worldly renown advantages, and reverence. The samâdhi of
suchness \[on the other hand\] has nothing to do with subjectivity and
attachment. If one is free from indolence even when rising from
meditation one's prejudices will by degrees get attenuated."

<span id="fn_202"></span>[140:1](taf28.htm#fr_204.md) The older translation
reads: "the ninety-five heretical doctrines."

<span id="fn_203"></span>[141:1](taf28.htm#fr_205.md) The idea is: that
which is transient is dependent, conditional and not self-regulating;
and that which is without freedom is necessarily miserable, that is to
say, it has no self-regulating Atman within itself.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[142:1](taf28.htm#fr_206.md) The last three
clauses are missing in the older translation.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[145:1](taf28.htm#fr_207.md) The same idea of
salvation is expressed in the *Bhagavadgîtâ*, Chap. VIII., p. 78: "And
he who leaves this body and departs (from this world) remembering me in
(his) last moment, comes into my essence. There is no doubt of that. . .
. Therefore at all times remember me. . . . Fixing your mind and
understanding on me you will come to me, there is no doubt He who thinks
of the supreme divine being, O son of Prithâ! with the mind not
(running) to other (objects), and possessed of abstraction in the shape
of continuous meditation (about the Supreme) goes to him.'

<span id="fn_206"></span>[145:2](taf28.htm#fr_208.md) It is not exactly
known from what Sûtra this passage is taken, but it is not difficult to
discover similar passages in the Sûtras which constitute the canonical
books of the Sukhâvatî sect, i.e., in the larger or smaller
*Sukhâvatî-vyûha*, or in the *Amitâyurdhyâna*. I here quote such a
passage from Max Müller's English translation of the larger
*Sukhâvatî-vyûha-Sûtra*, Sec. XXVII.: "And if, O Ânanda, any son or
daughter of a good family should wish--What?--How then may I see that
Tathâgata Amitâbha visibly, then he must raise his thought on to the
highest perfect knowledge, he must direct his thought with perseverance
and excessive <span id="page_146">p. 146</span> desire towards that
Buddha country, and direct the stock of his good works towards being
born there." As I noticed elsewhere, if those Mahâyâna texts had been
considered at the time of Açvaghosha, that is, in the first century
after or before Christ, as a genuine teaching of Buddha, then it would
have to be admitted, it seems to me, that the Mahâyâna system existed at
an early stage of the development of Buddhism, most probably side by
side with Hînayânism, which is generally supposed by Pâli scholars to be
more primitive. But the history of Buddhism in India as a whole is still
veiled with dark clouds of uncertainty, in spite of the fact that quite
a few original Sanskrit texts have been recovered.
