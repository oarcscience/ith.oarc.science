# ADORATION.

ADORATION to the World-honored Ones (*Bhagavat*) <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md) in all the ten quarters, who universally
produce great benefits, whose wisdom is infinite and transcendent, and
who save and guard \[all beings\].

\[Adoration\] to the Dharma <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58.md) whose
essence and

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

attributes are like the ocean, revealing to us the principle of anâtman
and forming the storage of infinite merits.

\[Adoration\] to the congregation (*samgha*) of those who assiduously
aspire after perfect knowledge (*samyaksambodhi*).

That all beings (*sarvasattva*) may rid themselves of doubt, become free
from evil attachment, and, by the awakening of faith (*çraddha*),
inherit Buddha-seeds, I write this Discourse. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_57"></span>[46:1](taf15.htm#fr_57.md) There are ten
appellations most commonly given to a Buddha: (1) *Tathâgata* (the one
who thus comes, or he who has been expected and fulfils all
expectations, the perfect one); (2) *Arhat* (the worthy one, but
according to Nâgârjuna's *Mahâprajñâpâramitâçâstra*, Chinese translation
by Kumârajîva, Vol. III., p. 17, one who has destroyed all enemies of
evil passions, or one who is revered by gods and men, or one who will
not be reborn; see also Vol. II., p. 20); (3) *Samyaksambuddha* (one who
is perfect by enlightenment); (4) *Vidyâcaranasampanna* (one who is
perfect in knowledge and conduct); (5) *Sugata* (one who goes well); (6)
*Lokavid* (one who knows the world); (7) *Anuttara* (one who has no
superior); (8) *Purushadamyasârathi* (the tamer of all beings); (9)
*Câstâdevâmanushyânâm* (the teacher of gods and men); (10) *Buddha* (the
enlightened one). When *Lokavid* and *Anuttara* are considered to be one
title, as in the *Sutra on the Ten Appellations*, *Bhagavat* is added to
make the tenth.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[46:2](taf15.htm#fr_58.md) According to a general
interpretation of Mahâyâna Buddhists dharma means: (1) that which
exists; (2) the object of understanding. Dharma may therefore be
rendered in the first sense by "object," or "thing," or "substance," or
"being," including everything mental as well as physical in its broadest
sense, and so sarvadharma will designate all possible existences in the
universe; <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> while dharma in the second
sense may safely be rendered by "law" or "doctrine" as generally
understood by Western Buddhist scholars, to most of whom, however, the
first significance of the term is strangely unknown. Max Müller fitly
remarks in his introduction to the English translation of the
*Vajracchedîkâ*, p. xiv: "Dharma in its ordinary Buddhist phraseology
may be correctly rendered by law. Thus the whole teaching of Buddha is
called the good law, Saddharma. But in our treatise dharma is generally
used in a different sense. It means form (εῖ᾽δος) and likewise what is
possessed of form, what is therefore different from other things, what
is individual, in fact, what we mean by a thing or an object. This
meaning has escaped most of the translators, both Oriental and Western,
but if we were always to translate dharma by law, it seems to me that
the whole drift of our treatise would become unintelligible." In this
translation dharma is rendered sometimes by "thing," sometimes by "law,"
sometimes by "truth" or "doctrine," according to the context. But when
it is synonymous with suchness (*bhûtatathatâ*), I have retained its
original Sanskrit form, capitalised.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[47:1](taf15.htm#fr_59.md) An almost similar
passage is repeated in the succeeding paragraph, while it does not occur
in the older translation It may be a mistake on the part of the new
translation, but I have left it as it stands in the text.
