### VARGA 28. DIVISION OF THE *S*ARÎRAS.

Thus those Mallas offered religious reverence to the relics, and used
the most costly flowers and scents for their supreme act of worship.
<span class="margnote">. 2218</span>

Then the kings of the seven countries <span
id="fr_888"></span>[3](#fn_887.md), having heard that Buddha was dead, sent
messengers to

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

the Mallas asking to share the sacred relics (of Buddha). <span
class="margnote">. 2219</span>

Then the Mallas reverencing the body of Tathâgata, trusting to their
martial renown, conceived a haughty mind: <span class="margnote">.
2220</span>

'They would rather part with life itself (they said), than with the
relics of the Buddha;' so those messengers returned from the futile
embassage. Then the seven kings, highly indignant, <span
class="margnote">. 2221</span>

With an army, numerous as the rain. clouds, advanced on Ku*s*inagara;
the people who went from the city filled with terror soon returned <span
class="margnote">. 2222</span>

And told the Mallas all, that the soldiers and the cavalry of the
neighbouring countries were coming, with elephants and chariots, to
surround the Ku*s*inagara city. <span class="margnote">. 2223</span>

The gardens, lying without the town, the fountains, lakes, flower and
fruit trees were now destroyed by the advancing host, and all the
pleasant resting-places lay in ruins. <span class="margnote">.
2224</span>

The Mallas, mounting on the city towers, beheld the great supports of
life <span id="fr_889"></span>[1](#fn_888.md) destroyed; they then prepared
their warlike engines to crush the foe without; <span class="margnote">.
2225</span>

Balistas <span id="fr_890"></span>[2](#fn_889.md) and catapults and 'flying
torches <span id="fr_891"></span>[3](#fn_890.md)' to

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

hurl against the advancing host. Then the seven kings entrenched
themselves around the city, each army host filled with increasing
courage; <span class="margnote">. 2226</span>

Their wings of battle shining in array as the sun's seven beams of glory
shine; the heavy drums <span id="fr_892"></span>[1](#fn_891.md) rolling as
the thunder, the warlike breath (rising) as the full cloud mist. <span
class="margnote">. 2227</span>

The Mallas, greatly incensed, opening the gates command the fray to
begin; the aged men and women whose hearts had trust in Buddha's law,
<span class="margnote">. 2228</span>

With deep concern breathed forth their vow, 'Oh! may the victory be a
bloodless one <span id="fr_893"></span>[2](#fn_892.md)!' Those who had
friends used mutual exhortations not to encourage in themselves a desire
for strife. <span class="margnote">. 2229</span>

And now the warriors, clad in armour, grasping their spears and
brandishing their swords ’midst the confused noise and heavy drums <span
id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_891) (advanced.md). But ere the contest had
begun, <span class="margnote">. 2230</span>

There was a certain Brahman whose name was Dro*n*a (tuh-lau-na),
celebrated for penetration, honour'd for modesty and lowliness, <span
class="margnote">. 2231</span>

Whose loving heart took pleasure in religion. This one addressed those
kings and said: 'Regarding the unequalled strength of yonder city, one
man alone would be enough (for its defence); <span class="margnote">.
2232</span>

How much less when with determined heart (they are united), In the
beginning <span id="fr_895"></span>[3](#fn_893.md) mutual strife produced
destruction, how now can it result in glory or renown? <span
class="margnote">. 2233</span>

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

'The clash of swords and bloody onset done, ’tis certain one must
perish! and therefore whilst you aim to vanquish those, both sides will
suffer in the fray. <span class="margnote">. 2234</span>

'Then there are many chances, too, of battle, ’tis hard to measure
strength by appearances; the strong, indeed, may overcome the weak, the
weak may also overcome the strong; <span class="margnote">. 2235</span>

'The powerful champion may despise the snake, but how will he escape a
wounded body? there are men whose natures bland and soft, seem suited
for the company of women or of children, <span class="margnote">.
2236</span>

'But when enlisted in the ranks, make perfect soldiers. As fire when it
is fed with oil, though reckoned weak, is not extinguished easily; so
when you say that they (your enemies) are weak, <span class="margnote">.
2237</span>

'Beware of leaning overmuch on strength of body; nought can compare with
strength of right (religion). There was in ancient times a *G*ina <span
id="fr_896"></span>[1](#fn_894.md) king, whose name was Kârandhama
(Avikshit), <span class="margnote">. 2238</span>

'His graceful (upright) presence caused such love (in others) that he
could overcome all animosity; but though he ruled the world and was high
renowned, and rich and prosperous, <span class="margnote">. 2239</span>

'Yet in the end he went back <span id="fr_897"></span>[2](#fn_895.md) and
all was lost! So when the ox has drunk enough, he too returns. Use then
the principles of righteousness, use the expedients of good will and
love. <span class="margnote">. 2240</span>

'Conquer your foe by force, you increase his

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

enmity; conquer by love, and you will reap no after-sorrow. The present
strife is but a thirst for blood, this thing cannot be endured! <span
class="margnote">. 2241</span>

'If you desire to honour Buddha, follow the example of his patience and
long-suffering <span id="fr_898"></span>[1](#fn_896.md)!' Thus this Brahman
with confidence declared the truth; <span class="margnote">. 2242</span>

'Imbued with highest principles of peace, he spake with boldness and
unflinchingly. And now the kings addressed the Brahman thus: <span
class="margnote">. 2243</span>

'You have chosen a fitting time for giving increase to the seed of
wisdom, the essence of true friendship is (leads to) the utterance of
truth. The greatest force (of reason) lies in righteous judgment. <span
class="margnote">. 2244</span>

'But now in turn hear what we say: The rules of kings are framed to
avoid the use of force when hatred has arisen from low desires (question
of the five pleasures); <span class="margnote">. 2245</span>

'Or else to avoid the sudden use of violence in trifling questions
(where some trifling matter is at stake). But we for the sake of law
(religion) are about to fight. What wonder is it! <span
class="margnote">. 2246</span>

'Swollen pride is a principle to be opposed, for it leads to the
overthrow of society; no wonder then that Buddha preached against it,
teaching men to practise lowliness and humility. <span
class="margnote">. 2247</span>

'Then why should we be forbidden to pay our reverence to his
body-relics? In ancient days a

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

lord of the great earth, Pih-shih-tsung <span
id="fr_899"></span>[1](#fn_897.md) Nanda \[or two lords, viz.
Pih-shih-tsung and Nanda\], <span class="margnote">. 2248</span>

'For the sake of a beautiful woman fought and destroyed each other; how
much more now, for the sake of religious reverence to our master, freed
from passion, gone to Nirvâ*n*a, <span class="margnote">. 2249</span>

'Without regard to self, or careful of our lives, should we contend and
assert our rights! A former king Kaurava (or belonging to the Kauravas)
fought with a Pâ*nd*ava (king), <span class="margnote">. 2250</span>

'And the more they increased in strength the more they struggled, all
for some temporary gain; how much more for our not-coveting <span
id="fr_900"></span>[2](#fn_898) master (should we contend.md), coveting to
get his living (relics)? <span class="margnote">. 2251</span>

'The son of Râma, too, the *Ri*shi (or Râma*ri*shiputra), angry with
king Da*s*aratha, destroyed his country, slew the people, because of the
rage he felt; <span class="margnote">. 2252</span>

'How much less for our master, freed from anger, should we be niggard of
our lives! Râma, for Sîta's sake, killed all the demon-spirits; <span
class="margnote">. 2253</span>

'How much more for our lord, heaven <span
id="fr_901"></span>[3](#fn_899.md)-received, should we not sacrifice our
lives! The two demons A-lai (Alaka) and Po-ku were ever drawn into
contention; <span class="margnote">. 2254</span>

'In the first place, because of their folly and ignorance, causing wide
ruin among men; how

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

much less for our all-wise master should we begrudge our lives! <span
class="margnote">. 2255</span>

'Wherefore if from these examples we find others ready to die for no
real principle, how shall we for our teacher of gods (Devas) and men,
reverenced by the universe, <span class="margnote">. 2256</span>

'Spare our bodies or begrudge our lives, and not be earnest in desire to
make our offerings! Now then, if you desire to stay the strife, go, and
for us demand within the city <span class="margnote">. 2257</span>

'That they open wide (distribute) the relics, and so cause our prayer to
be fulfilled. But because your words are right ones, we hold our anger
for a while; <span class="margnote">. 2258</span>

'Even as the great, angry snake, by the power of charms is quieted.' And
now the Brahman <span id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_900.md), having received
the king's instruction, <span class="margnote">. 2259</span>

Entering the city, went to the Mallas, and saluting them, spoke these
true words: 'Without the city those who are kings among men <span
id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_901.md) grasp with their hands their martial
weapons, <span class="margnote">. 2260</span>

'And with their bodies clad in weighty armour wait eagerly (to fight);
glorious as the sun's rays; bristling with rage as the roused lion.
These united are, to overthrow this city. <span class="margnote">.
2261</span>

'But whilst they wage this religious war, they fear lest they may act
irreligiously, and so they have sent me here to say what they require.
<span class="margnote">. 2262</span>

'"We <span id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_902.md) have come, not for the sake
of territory,

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

much less for money's sake, nor on account of any insolent feeling, nor
yet from any thought of hatred; <span class="margnote">. 2263</span>

'"But because we venerate the great *Ri*shi, we have come on this
account. You, noble sirs! know well our mind! Why should there be such
sorrowful contention! <span class="margnote">. 2264</span>

'"You honour what we honour, both alike, then we are brothers as
concerns religion. We both with equal heart revere the bequeathed
spiritual relics of the lord. <span class="margnote">. 2265</span>

'"To be miserly in (hoarding) wealth, this is an unreasonable fault; how
much more to grudge religion, of which there is so little knowledge in
the world! <span class="margnote">. 2266</span>

'"The exclusive and the selfishly-inclined, should practise laws of
hospitality (civility) <span id="fr_905"></span>[1](#fn_903.md); but if ye
have not rules of honour <span id="fr_906"></span>[2](#fn_904.md) such as
these, then shut your gates and guard yourselves." <span
class="margnote">. 2267</span>

'This is the tenor of the words, be they good or bad, spoken by them.
But now for myself and my own feelings, let me add these true and
sincere words. <span class="margnote">. 2268</span>

'Let there be no contention either way; reason ought to minister for
peace, the lord when dwelling in the world ever employed the force of
patience. <span class="margnote">. 2269</span>

'Not to obey his holy teaching, and yet to offer gifts to him, is
contradiction. Men of the world

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

for some indulgence, some wealth or land, contend and fight, <span
class="margnote">. 2270</span>

'But those who believe the righteous law, should obediently conform
their lives to it; to believe and yet to harbour enmity, this is to
oppose "religious principle" to "conduct." <span class="margnote">.
2271</span>

'Buddha himself at rest, and full of love, desired to bestow the rest he
enjoyed, on all. To adore with worship the great merciful, and yet to
gender wide destruction, <span class="margnote">. 2272</span>

'(How is this possible?) Divide the relics, then, that all may worship
them alike; obeying thus the law, the fame thereof wide-spread, then
righteous principles will be diffused; <span class="margnote">.
2273</span>

'But if others walk not righteously, we ought by righteous dealing to
appease them, in this way showing the advantage (pleasure) of religion,
we cause religion everywhere to take deep hold and abide. <span
class="margnote">. 2274</span>

'Buddha has told us that of all charity "religious charity" is the
highest; men easily bestow their wealth in charity, but hard is the
charity that works for righteousness.' <span class="margnote">.
2275</span>

The Mallas hearing the Brahman's words with inward shame gazed at one
another; and answered the Brahma*k*ârin thus: 'We thank you much for
purposing to come to us, <span class="margnote">. 2276</span>

'And for your friendly and religious counsel--speaking so well, and
reasonably. Yours are words which a Brahman ought to use, in keeping
with his holy character <span id="fr_907"></span>[1](#fn_905.md); <span
class="margnote">. 2277</span>

'Words full of reconciliation, pointing out the

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

proper road; like one recovering a wandering horse brings him back by
the path which he had lost. <span class="margnote">. 2278</span>

'We then ought to adopt the plan of reconciliation such as you have
shown us; to hear the truth and not obey it brings afterwards regretful
sorrow.' <span class="margnote">. 2279</span>

Then they opened out the master's relics and in eight parts equally
divided them. Themselves paid reverence to one part, the other seven
they handed to the Brahman; <span class="margnote">. 2280</span>

The seven kings having accepted these, rejoiced and placed them on their
heads <span id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_906.md); and thus with them returned
to their own country, and erected Dâgobas for worship over them. <span
class="margnote">. 2281</span>

The Brahma*k*ârin then besought the Mallas to bestow on him the
relic-pitcher as his portion, and from the seven kings he requested a
fragment of their relics, as an eighth share. <span class="margnote">.
2282</span>

Taking this, he returned and raised a *K*aitya, which still is named
'the Golden Pitcher Dâgoba.' Then the men of Ku*s*inagara collecting all
the ashes of the burning, <span class="margnote">. 2283</span>

Raised over them a *K*aitya, and called it 'the Ashes Dâgoba.' The eight
Stûpas of the eight kings, 'the Golden Pitcher' and 'the Ashes
Stûpa <span id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_907.md),' <span class="margnote">.
2284</span>

Thus throughout *G*ambudvîpa there first were raised ten Dâgobas. Then
all the lords and ladies

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

of the country holding gem-embroidered canopies, <span
class="margnote">. 2285</span>

Paid their offerings at the various shrines, adorning them as any golden
mountain <span id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_908.md). And so with music and
with dancing through the day and night they made merry, and sang. <span
class="margnote">. 2286</span>

And now the Arhats numbering five hundred, having for ever lost their
master's presence, reflecting there was now no ground of certainty,
returned to G*ri*dhrakû*t*a mount; <span class="margnote">. 2287</span>

Assembling in king *S*akra's cavern <span
id="fr_911"></span>[2](#fn_909.md), they collected there the Sûtra
Pi*t*aka; all the assembly agreeing that the venerable Ânanda <span
class="margnote">. 2288</span>

Should say (recite), for the sake of the congregation, the sermons of
Tathâgata from first to last, 'Great and small, whatever you have heard
from the mouth of the deceased Muni.' <span class="margnote">.
2289</span>

Then Amanda in the great assembly ascending the lion throne, declared in
order what the lord had preached, uttering the words 'Thus have I
heard.' <span class="margnote">. 2290</span>

The whole assembly, bathed in tears, were deeply moved as he pronounced
the words 'I heard;' and so he announced the law as to the time, as to
the place, as to the person; <span class="margnote">. 2291</span>

As he spoke, so was it written down from first to last, the complete
Sûtra Pi*t*aka <span id="fr_912"></span>[3](#fn_910.md). By diligent

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

attention in the use of means, practising (the way of) wisdom, (all
these) (Arhats) obtained Nirvâ*n*a; <span class="margnote">. 2292</span>

Those now able so to do, or hereafter able, shall attain Nirvâ*n*a, in
the same way. King A*s*oka <span id="fr_913"></span>[1](#fn_911.md) born in
the world when strong, caused much sorrow; <span class="margnote">.
2293</span>

When feeble <span id="fr_914"></span>[2](#fn_912.md), then he banished
sorrow; as the A*s*oka-flower tree, ruling over *G*ambudvîpa, his heart
for ever put an end to sorrow, <span class="margnote">. 2294</span>

When brought to entire faith in the true law; therefore he was called
'the King who frees from sorrow.' A descendant of the Mayûra family,
receiving from heaven a righteous disposition, <span class="margnote">.
2295</span>

He ruled equally over the world; he raised everywhere towers and
shrines, his private name the 'violent A*s*oka,' now called the
'righteous A*s*oka.' <span class="margnote">. 2296</span>

Opening the Dâgobas raised by those seven kings to take the *S*arîras
thence, he spread them everywhere, and raised in one day eighty-four
thousand towers <span id="fr_915"></span>[3](#fn_913.md); <span
class="margnote">. 2297</span>

Only with regard to the eighth pagoda in Râmagrama, which the Nâga
spirit protected <span id="fr_916"></span>[4](#fn_914.md), the king was
unable to obtain those relics; <span class="margnote">. 2298</span>

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

But though he obtained them not, knowing they were spiritually
bequeathed relics of Buddha which the Nâga worshipped and adored, his
faith was in creased and his reverent disposition. <span
class="margnote">. 2299</span>

Although the king was ruler of the world, yet was he able to obtain the
first holy fruit <span id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_915.md); and thus induced
the entire empire to honour and revere the shrines of Tathâgata. <span
class="margnote">. 2300</span>

In the past and present, thus there has been deliverance for all.
Tathâgata, when in the world; and now his relics--after his Nirvâ*n*a;
<span class="margnote">. 2301</span>

Those who worship and revere these, gain equal merit; so also those who
raise themselves by wisdom, and reverence the virtues of the Tathâgata,
<span class="margnote">. 2302</span>

Cherishing religion, fostering a spirit of alms-giving, they gain great
merit also. The noble and superlative law of Buddha ought to receive the
adoration of the world. <span class="margnote">. 2303</span>

Gone to that undying place (Amrita), those who believe (his law) shall
follow him there; therefore let all the Devas and men, without
exception, worship and adore <span class="margnote">. 2304</span>

The one great loving and compassionate, who mastered thoroughly the
highest truth, in order to deliver all that lives. Who that hears of
him, but yearns with love! <span class="margnote">. 2305</span>

The pains of birth, old age, disease, and death, the endless sorrows of
the world, the countless miseries of 'hereafter,' dreaded by all the
Devas, <span class="margnote">. 2306</span>

He has removed all these accumulated sorrows;

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

say, who would not revere him? to escape the joys of after life, this is
the world's chief joy! <span class="margnote">. 2307</span>

To add the pain of other births, this is the world's worst sorrow!
Buddha, escaped from pain of birth, shall have no joy of the
'hereafter <span id="fr_918"></span>[1](#fn_916.md)!' <span
class="margnote">. 2308</span>

And having shown the way to all the world, who would not reverence and
adore him? To sing the praises of the lordly monk, and (declare) his
acts from first to last, <span class="margnote">. 2309</span>

Without self-seeking or self-honour, without desire for personal renown,
but following what the scriptures say, to benefit the world, (has been
my aim.) <span class="margnote">. 2310</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_887"></span>[325:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_888.md) The seven 'kings'
were, the king of Magadha, the Li*kkh*avis of Vai*s*âlî, the *S*âkyas of
Kapilavastu, the Bulis of Allakappa, the Koliyas of Râmagrâma, the
Brahman of Ve*th*adipa, and the Mallas of Pâvâ; Sacred Books of the
East, vol. xi, pp. 131, 132.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[326:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_889.md) The supports of
life, as I take it, are the fields and fountains.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[326:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_890.md) It may be rendered
'bow catapults' and 'balista-stone-carriages,' or bows, catapults,
balistas, and stone carriages (carrying machines?).

<span id="fn_890"></span>[326:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_891.md) These flying
torches and other instruments were used by the Northern nations from
remote antiquity. There is no indication of them, however, in the plate
(xxxviii) in Tree and Serpent Worship, which, I take it, represents this
scene. A*s*vaghosha was familiar with Kanishka and his military
appliances, and these doubtless included the instruments here referred
to.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[327:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_894.md) Is <span
id="img_32700"></span> ![](img/32700.jpg) for <span
id="img_32701"></span> ![](img/32701.jpg)? If so, it would be cymbals
and drums.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[327:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_893.md) May they subdue
those without loss or hurt to themselves.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[327:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_895.md) Or, from the
beginning.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[328:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_896.md) A *G*ina king, or a
conquering king. Kârandhama was a name of Avikshit.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[328:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_897.md) Whether it means he
went back 'to death,' or he lost his possessions by warfare, is not
plain from the text. The phrase 'all was lost,' may also be rendered,
'he gave up all.'

<span id="fn_896"></span>[329:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_898.md)

'Hear, reverend sirs, one single word from me.  
Forbearance was our Buddha wont to teach.'  
             Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 133

But it is not plain how Dro*n*a could address the Mallas as 'reverend
sirs,' unless indeed the brethren were going to fight, which is beyond
probability.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[330:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_899.md) The character
'tsung' in this name is uncertain, I have not therefore attempted to
restore it.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[330:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_900.md) Not-covetous; here
there is a double-entendre, contrasting the absence of covetousness in
Buddha with the presence of it in the Pâ*nd*avas and Kauravas.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[330:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_901.md) <span

<span id="fn_900"></span>[331:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_902.md) There is nothing
like this in the Southern account.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[331:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_903.md) 'Kings among men,'
άνακτες ἀνδρῶν.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[331:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_904.md) This is the only
way to take the translation, although the pronoun ’ngo standing alone
would signify 'I' have come; but <span id="page_332">p. 332</span>
perhaps the singular implies that Dro*n*a used the words of the chief of
the kings.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[332:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_905.md) Should practise
'waiting for guest laws,' civil conduct. I have given here the sense of
the passage.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[332:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_906.md) Kshatriya rules,

<span id="fn_906"></span>[334:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_908.md) Placing relics on
the head was a token of reverence. Compare plate xxxviii (Tree and
Serpent Worship).

<span id="fn_907"></span>[334:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_909.md) In reference to
these *K*aityas or towers, compare the account given in the Pâli (Sacred
Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 135), and also Fă-hien, cap. xxiii.

Mountain, i.e. Sumeru.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[335:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_912.md) Here we have a
short account of the first Buddhist Council, called the Council of the
500. It forms no part of the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, although it is
found in the Vinaya Pi*t*aka. Compare Oldenberg, Vinaya Pi*t*akam,
Introduction.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[336:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_913.md) This episode about
A*s*oka is a curious one. It would seem from it that A*s*vaghosha knew
only of one king of that name, called first 'the fierce,' afterwards
'the righteous.'

<span id="fn_912"></span>[336:2](sbe1930.htm#fr_914.md) There are one or
two Avadânas to be met with in Chinese Buddhist literature, relating to
A*s*oka's sickness, and how he then desired to redeem his character by
making offerings to Buddha. But the accounts are too uncertain to be
admitted as conclusive evidence in the question of his conversion.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[336:3](sbe1930.htm#fr_915.md) This is a story
everywhere received in Northern books. These eighty-four thousand towers
are supposed to represent the number of sections, or perhaps letters, in
the Pi*t*akas.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[336:4](sbe1930.htm#fr_916.md) See Fă-hien's
account, cap. xxiii.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[337:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_917.md) 'That is, the first
step in the Buddhist profession of sanctity (Srotâpanna).

<span id="fn_916"></span>[338:1](sbe1930.htm#fr_918.md) The joy of the
'hereafter,' is the joy, as men count it, of future sentient happiness.
This, according to the text, it is the happiness of Buddha to have
escaped.
