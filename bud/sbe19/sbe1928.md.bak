### VARGA 26. MAHÂPARINIRVÂ*N*A.

At this time there was a Brahma*k*ârin whose name was Su-po-to-lo <span
id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_797) (Subhadra.md); he was well known for his
virtuous qualities (bhadra), leading a pure life according to the rules
of morality, and protecting all living things. <span class="margnote">.
1984</span>

When young <span id="fr_798"></span>[2](#fn_798.md) he had adopted
heretical views and become a recluse among unbelievers--this one,
wishing to see the lord, spake to Ânanda thus: <span class="margnote">.
1985</span>

'I hear that the system of Tathâgata is of a

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

singular character and very profound (difficult to fathom), and that he
(has reached) the highest wisdom (anuttarâ(sam)bodhi) in the world, the
first of all horse-tamers <span id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_799.md). <span
class="margnote">. 1986</span>

'(I hear moreover) that he is now about to die (reach Nirvâ*n*a), it
will be difficult <span id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_800.md) indeed to meet
with him again, and difficult to see those who have seen him with
difficulty, even as it is to catch in a mirror the reflection of the
moon. <span class="margnote">. 1987</span>

'I now desire respectfully to see him the greatest and most virtuous
guide (of men), because I seek to escape this mass of sorrow
(accumulated sorrow) and reach the other shore of birth and death, <span
class="margnote">. 1988</span>

'The sun of Buddha now about to quench its rays, O! let me for a moment
gaze upon him.' The feelings of Ânanda now were much affected, thinking
that this request was made with a view to controversy, <span
class="margnote">. 1989</span>

Or that he (i.e. Subhadra) felt an inward joy because the lord was on
the eve of death. He was not willing therefore to permit the interview
with Buddha (the Buddha-sight). Buddha, knowing the man's (that one's)
earnest desire and that he was a vessel fit for true religion (right
doctrine), <span class="margnote">. 1990</span>

Therefore addressed Ânanda thus: 'Permit that heretic to advance; I was
born to save mankind <span id="fr_801"></span>[3](#fn_801.md), make no
hindrance therefore or excuse!' <span class="margnote">. 1991</span>

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

Subhadra, hearing this, was overjoyed at heart, and his religious
feelings (his feelings of joy in religion) were much enlarged, as with
increased reverence he advanced to Buddha's presence. <span
class="margnote">. 1992</span>

Then, as the occasion required <span id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_802.md), he
spoke becoming words and with politeness made his salutation <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_803.md), his features pleasing and with hands
conjoined (he said): 'Now I desire to ask somewhat from thee; <span
class="margnote">. 1993</span>

'The world has many teachers of religion <span
id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_804) (those who know the law.md) as I am myself;
but I hear that Buddha has attained a way which is the end of all,
complete emancipation. <span class="margnote">. 1994</span>

'O that you would, on my account, briefly explain (your method), moisten
my empty, thirsty soul (heart)! not with a view to controversy or from a
desire to gain the mastery (but with sincerity I ask you so to do).'
<span class="margnote">. 1995</span>

Then Buddha, for the Brahma*k*ârin's sake, in brief recounted the eight
'right ways' (noble paths)--on hearing which, his empty soul (meek
heart) accepted it, as one deceived accepts direction in the right road.
1996}

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

Perceiving now, he knew that what he had before perceived was not the
final way (of salvation), but now he felt he had attained what he had
not before attained, and so he gave up and forsook his books of heresy.
<span class="margnote">. 1997</span>

Moreover, now he rejected (turned his back) on the gloomy hindrances of
doubt (moha), reflecting how by his former practices, mixed up with
anger, hate, and ignorance, he had long cherished no real (good)
joy <span id="fr_805"></span>[1](#fn_805.md). <span class="margnote">.
1998</span>

For if (he argued) the ways of lust and hate and ignorance are able to
produce a virtuous karman (good works), then 'hearing much' and
'persevering wisdom' (or, wisdom and perseverance (vîrya)) these, too,
are born from lust, (which cannot be.) <span class="margnote">.
1999</span>

But if a man is able to cut down hate and ignorance, then also he puts
off all consequences of works (karman), and these being finally
destroyed, this is complete emancipation. <span class="margnote">.
2000</span>

Those thus freed from works are likewise freed from subtle questionings
(investigation of subtle principles), (such as) what the world says
'that all things, everywhere, possess a self-nature <span
id="fr_806"></span>[2](#fn_806.md).' <span class="margnote">. 2001</span>

But if this be the case and therefore lust, hate, and ignorance possess
a self-implanted nature, then this nature must inhere in them; what then
means the word 'deliverance?' <span class="margnote">. 2002</span>

For even if we rightly cause <span id="fr_807"></span>[3](#fn_807.md) the
overthrow

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (destruction) of
hate and ignorance, yet if lust (love) remains, then there is a return
of birth; even as water, cold in its nature, may by fire be heated,
<span class="margnote">. 2003</span>

But when the fire goes out then it becomes cold again, because this is
its constant nature; so (we may) ever know that the nature which lust
has is permanent \[or, 'endurance, we may know, is the nature of
lust'\], and neither hearing, wisdom, or perseverance can alter it.
<span class="margnote">. 2004</span>

Neither capable of increase or diminution, how can there be deliverance?
I held aforetime (thus he thought) that (those things capable of) birth
and death resulted thus, from their own innate nature; <span
class="margnote">. 2005</span>

But now I see that such a belief excludes deliverance; for what is
(born) by nature must endure so, what end can such things have? <span
class="margnote">. 2006</span>

Just as a burning lamp cannot but give its light; the way (doctrine) of
Buddha is the only true one, that lust, as the root-cause, brings forth
the things that live (the world); <span class="margnote">. 2007</span>

Destroy this lust (love) then there is Nirvâ*n*a (quiet extinction); the
cause destroyed then the fruit is not produced. I formerly maintained
that 'I' (self) was a distinct entity (body), not seeing that it has no
maker. <span class="margnote">. 2008</span>

But now I hear the right doctrine preached by Buddha, there is no 'self'
(personal self) in all the world, for all things are produced by cause,
and therefore there is no creator (Î*s*vara). <span class="margnote">.
2009</span>

If then sorrow is produced by cause (or, if then cause producing things,
there is sorrow), the cause may likewise be destroyed; for if the world
is cause-produced,

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

then is the view correct, that by destruction of the cause, there is an
end. <span class="margnote">. 2010</span>

The cause destroyed, the world brought to an end, there is no room for
such a thought as permanence, and therefore all my former views (he
said) are 'done away,' and so he deeply 'saw' the true doctrine taught
by Buddha. <span class="margnote">. 2011</span>

Because of seeds well sown in former times, he was enabled thus to
understand the law on hearing it; thus he reached the good and perfect
state of quietness, the peaceful, never-ending place (of rest). <span
class="margnote">. 2012</span>

His heart expanding to receive the truth, he gazed with earnest look on
Buddha as he slept, nor could he bear to see Tathâgata depart and die
(leave the world and attain Nirvâ*n*a); <span class="margnote">.
2013</span>

'Ere yet,' he said, 'Buddha shall reach the term (of life) I will myself
first leave the world (become extinct);' and then with hands close
joined, retiring from the holy form (face or features), he took his seat
apart, and sat composed and firm <span id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_808.md).
<span class="margnote">. 2014</span>

Then giving up his life (years), he reached Nirvâ*n*a, as when the rain
puts out a little fire. Then Buddha spake to all his followers
(Bhikshus): 'This my very last disciple <span class="margnote">.
2015</span>

'Has now attained Nirvâ*n*a, cherish him (his remains) properly.' Then
Buddha the first night (watch) passed, the moon bright shining and all
the stars clear in their lustre, <span class="margnote">. 2016</span>

The quiet grove without a sound, moved by his great compassionate heart,
declared to his disciples

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

this his bequeathed precepts <span id="fr_809"></span>[1](#fn_809.md) (his
testamentary rules). 'After my Nirvâ*n*a, <span class="margnote">.
2017</span>

'Ye ought to reverence and obey the Pratimoksha, (receive it) as your
master, a shining lamp in the dark night, <span class="margnote">.
2018</span>

'Or as a great jewel (treasured by) a poor man. The injunctions I have
ever given, these you ought to obey and follow carefully, and treat in
no way different from myself. <span class="margnote">. 2019</span>

'Keep pure your body, words, and conduct, put from you all concerns of
daily life (business), lands, houses, cattle, storing wealth or hoarding
grain. <span class="margnote">. 2020</span>

'All these should be avoided as we avoid a fiery pit; (so also) sowing
the land, cutting down shrubs, healing of wounds or the practice of
medicine, <span class="margnote">. 2021</span>

'Star-gazing and astrology, forecasting lucky or unfortunate events by
signs (palm signs), prognosticating good or evil, all these are things
forbidden. <span class="margnote">. 2022</span>

'Keeping the body temperate, eat at proper times; receive no mission as
a go-between; compound no philteries; abhor dissimulation; <span
class="margnote">. 2023</span>

'Follow right doctrine, and be kind to all that lives; receive in
moderation what is given; receive but hoard not up; these are, in brief,
my spoken precepts. <span class="margnote">. 2024</span>

'These form the groundwork of my rules, these also are the ground of
full emancipation <span id="fr_810"></span>[2](#fn_810.md). Enabled

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

thus to live (relying on this law, able to live) this is rightly to
receive all (other things). <span class="margnote">. 2025</span>

'This is true wisdom which embraces all, this is the way (cause) to
attain the end; this code of rules, therefore, ye should hold and keep,
and never let it slip or be destroyed. <span class="margnote">.
2026</span>

'For when pure rules of conduct are observed (not broken), then there is
true religion; without these, virtue languishes; found yourselves
therefore well on these my precepts (moral rules); <span
class="margnote">. 2027</span>

'Grounded thus in rules of purity, the springs of feeling (animal
feeling) will be well controlled, even as the well-instructed cowherd
guides well his cattle (permits them neither to loiter nor hurry on).
<span class="margnote">. 2028</span>

'Ill-governed feelings (senses), like the horse, run wild through all
the six domains of sense, bringing upon us in the present world
unhappiness, and in the next, birth in an evil way. <span
class="margnote">. 2029</span>

'So, like the horse ill-broken, these land us in the ditch; therefore
the wise and prudent man will not allow his senses licence. <span
class="margnote">. 2030</span>

'For these senses (organs of sense) are, indeed, our greatest foes,
causes of misery; for men enamoured thus by sensuous things cause all
their miseries to recur. <span class="margnote">. 2031</span>

'Destructive as a poisonous snake, or like a savage tiger, or like a
raging fire, the greatest evil in the world, he who is wise, is freed
from fear of these. <span class="margnote">. 2032</span>

'But what he fears is only this--a light and trivial heart, which drags
a man to future misery (evil way

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

of birth) just for a little sip of pleasure not looking at the yawning
gulf (before us); <span class="margnote">. 2033</span>

'Like the wild elephant freed from the iron curb (aṅkusa), or like the
ape that has regained the forest trees, such is the light and trivial
heart;--the wise man should restrain and hold it therefore. <span
class="margnote">. 2034</span>

'Letting the heart go loose without restraint, that man shall not attain
Nirvâ*n*a; therefore we ought to hold the heart in cheek, and go apart
from men and seek a quiet resting-place (hermit's abode). <span
class="margnote">. 2035</span>

'Know when to eat and the right measure; and so with reference to the
rules of clothing and of medicine; take care you do not by the food you
take, encourage in yourselves a covetous or an angry mind. <span
class="margnote">. 2036</span>

'Eat your food to satisfy your hunger and (drink to satisfy) your
thirst, as we repair an old or broken chariot, or like the butterfly
that sips the flower destroying not its fragrance or its texture. <span
class="margnote">. 2037</span>

'The Bhikshu, in begging food, should beware of injuring the faithful
mind of another <span id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_811.md); if a man opens
his heart in charity, think not about his capabilities (i.e. to overtax
him), <span class="margnote">. 2038</span>

'For ’tis not well to calculate too closely the strength of the ox, lest
by loading him (beyond his strength) you cause him injury. At morning,
noon, and night, successively, store up good works. <span
class="margnote">. 2039</span>

'During the first and after watch at night be not overpowered by sleep,
but in the middle watch, with heart composed, take sleep (and rest)---be
thoughtful towards the dawn of day. <span class="margnote">. 2040</span>

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

'Sleep not the whole night through, making the body and the life relaxed
and feeble; think! when the fire shall burn the body always, what length
of sleep will then be possible? <span class="margnote">. 2041</span>

'For when the hateful brood of sorrow rising through space, with all its
attendant horrors, meeting the mind o’erwhelmed by sleep and death,
shall seize its prey, who then shall waken it? <span class="margnote">.
2042</span>

'The poisonous snake dwelling within a house can be enticed away by
proper charms, so the black toad that dwells within his heart, the early
waker disenchants and banishes. <span class="margnote">. 2043</span>

'He who sleeps on heedlessly (without plan), this man has no modesty;
but modesty is like a beauteous robe, or like the curb that guides the
elephant. <span class="margnote">. 2044</span>

'Modest behaviour keeps the heart composed, without it every virtuous
root will die. Who has this modesty, the world applauds (calls him
excellent); without it, he is but as any beast. <span class="margnote">.
2045</span>

'If a man with a sharp sword should cut the (another's) body bit by bit
(limb by limb), let not an angry thought, or of resentment, rise, and
let the mouth speak no ill word. <span class="margnote">. 2046</span>

'Your evil thoughts and evil words but hurt yourself and not another;
nothing so full of victory as patience, though your body suffer the pain
of mutilation. <span class="margnote">. 2047</span>

'For recollect that he who has this patience cannot be overcome, his
strength being so firm; therefore give not way to anger or evil words
towards men in power <span id="fr_812"></span>[1](#fn_812.md). <span
class="margnote">. 2048</span>

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

'Anger and hate destroy the true law; and they destroy dignity and
beauty of body; as when one dies we lose our name for beauty, so the
fire of anger itself burns up the heart. <span class="margnote">.
2049</span>

'Anger is foe to all religious merit, he who loves virtue let him not be
passionate; the layman who is angry when oppressed by many sorrows is
not wondered at, <span class="margnote">. 2050</span>

'But he who has "left his home <span id="fr_813"></span>[1](#fn_813.md)"
indulging anger, this is indeed opposed to principle, as if in frozen
water there were found the heat of fire. <span class="margnote">.
2051</span>

'If indolence (an indolent mind) arises in your heart, then with your
own hand smooth down your head <span id="fr_814"></span>[2](#fn_814.md),
shave off your hair, and clad in sombre (dyed or stained) garments, in
your hand holding the begging-pot, go ask for food; <span
class="margnote">. 2052</span>

'On every side the living perish, what room for indolence? the worldly
man, relying on his substance or his family, indulging in indolence, is
wrong; <span class="margnote">. 2053</span>

'How much more the religious man, whose purpose is to seek the way of
rescue, who encourages within an indolent mind; this surely is
impossible! <span class="margnote">. 2054</span>

'Crookedness and truth (straightness) are in their nature opposite and
cannot dwell together more than frost and fire; for one who has become
religious, and practises the way of straight behaviour, a false and
crooked way of speech is not becoming. <span class="margnote">.
2055</span>

'False and flattering speech is like the magician's

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

art; but he who ponders on religion cannot speak falsely (wildly). To
"covet much," brings sorrow; desiring little, there is rest and peace.
<span class="margnote">. 2056</span>

'To procure rest (peace of mind), there must be small desire--much more
in case of those who seek deliverance (salvation). The niggard dreads
the much-seeking man lest he should filch away his property (wealth and
jewels), <span class="margnote">. 2057</span>

'But he who loves to give has also fear, lest he should not possess
enough to give; therefore we ought to encourage small desire, that we
may have to give to him who wants, without such fear. <span
class="margnote">. 2058</span>

From this desiring-little-mind we find the way of true deliverance;
desiring true deliverance (seeking salvation) we ought to practise
knowing-enough (contentment). <span class="margnote">. 2059</span>

'A contented mind is always joyful, but joy like this is but
religion <span id="fr_815"></span>[1](#fn_815.md); the rich and poor alike,
having contentment, enjoy perpetual rest. <span class="margnote">.
2060</span>

The ill-contented man though he be born to heavenly joys, because he is
not contented would ever have a mind burned up by the fire of sorrow.
<span class="margnote">. 2061</span>

'The rich, without contentment, endures the pain of poverty; though
poor, if yet he be contented, then he is rich indeed! <span
class="margnote">. 2062</span>

'That ill-contented man, the bounds of the five desires extending
further still, (becomes) insatiable in his requirements, (and so)
through the long night (of life) gathers increasing sorrow. <span
class="margnote">. 2063</span>

'Without cessation thus he cherishes his careful (anxious) plans, whilst
he who lives contented, freed

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

from anxious thoughts about relationships (family concerns), his heart
is ever peaceful and at rest. <span class="margnote">. 2064</span>

'And so because he rests and is at peace within, the gods and men revere
and do him service. Therefore we ought to put away all cares about
relationship (the encumbrance of close or distant relationships). <span
class="margnote">. 2065</span>

'For like a solitary desert tree in which the birds and monkeys gather.
so is it when we are cumbered much with family associations; through the
long night we gather many sorrows. <span class="margnote">. 2066</span>

'Many dependents (relationships) are like the many bands (that bind us),
or like the old elephant that struggles in the mud. By diligent
perseverance a man may get much profit; <span class="margnote">.
2067</span>

'Therefore night and day men ought with ceaseless effort to exert
themselves; the tiny streams that trickle down the mountain slopes
(valleys) by always flowing eat away the rock. <span class="margnote">.
2068</span>

'If we use not earnest diligence in drilling wood in wood for fire, we
shall not obtain the spark, so ought we to be diligent and persevere, as
the skilful master drills the wood for fire. <span class="margnote">.
2069</span>

'A "virtuous friend <span id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_816.md)" though he be
gentle is not to be compared with right reflection (thought)--right
thought kept well in the mind, no evil thing can ever enter there. <span
class="margnote">. 2070</span>

'Wherefore those who practise (a religious life) should always think
about "the body" (their true condition--themselves); if thought upon
oneself be

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

absent, then all virtue (virtuous intentions or purposes) dies. <span
class="margnote">. 2071</span>

'For as the champion warrior relies for victory upon his armour's
strength, so "right thought" is like a strong cuirass able to withstand
the six sense-robbers (the robber-objects of the six senses). <span
class="margnote">. 2072</span>

'Right faith <span id="fr_817"></span>[1](#fn_817) (samâdhi.md)
enwraps <span id="fr_818"></span>[2](#fn_818.md) the enlightened heart, (so
that a man) perceives the world throughout (is liable to) birth and
death; therefore the religious man should practise "samâdhi." <span
class="margnote">. 2073</span>

'Having found peace (quietness and peace) in samâdhi, we put an end to
all the mass of sorrows, wisdom then can enlighten us, and so we put
away the rules by which we acquire (knowledge by the senses). <span
class="margnote">. 2074</span>

'By inward thought and right consideration following with gladness the
directions of the "true law," this is the way in which both lay (men of
the world) and men who have left their homes (religious men) should
walk. <span class="margnote">. 2075</span>

'Across the sea of birth and death, "wisdom" is the handy bark; "wisdom"
is the shining lamp that lightens up the dark and gloomy (world). <span
class="margnote">. 2076</span>

'"Wisdom" is the grateful medicine for all the defiling ills \[of life\]
(â*s*ravas); "wisdom" is the axe wherewith to level all the tangled
(prickly) forest trees of sorrow. <span class="margnote">. 2077</span>

'"Wisdom" is the bridge that spans the rushing stream of ignorance and
lust--therefore, in every

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

way, by thought and right attention (listening), a man should diligently
inure himself to engender "wisdom." <span class="margnote">. 2078</span>

'Having acquired the threefold <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_819.md)
wisdom, then, though blind, the eye of wisdom sees throughout; but
without wisdom the mind is poor and insincere (false); such things
cannot suit (agree with) the man who has left his home. <span
class="margnote">. 2079</span>

'Wherefore let the enlightened man lay well to heart that false and
fruitless (vain) things become him not, and let him strive with single
mind for that pure (refined and excellent) joy which can be found alone
in perfect rest and quietude (the place of rest and peace, i.e.
Nirvâ*n*a). <span class="margnote">. 2080</span>

'Above all things be not careless, for carelessness is the chief foe of
virtue; if a man avoid this fault he may be born where *S*akra-râ*g*a
dwells. <span class="margnote">. 2081</span>

'He who gives way to carelessness of mind must have his lot where the
Asuras dwell. Thus have I done my task, my fitting task, (in setting
forth the way of) quietude, the proof (work) of love <span
id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_820.md). <span class="margnote">. 2082</span>

'On your parts be diligent <span id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_821.md)
(earnest)! with virtuous purpose practise well these rules (works), in
quiet solitude of desert hermitage nourish and cherish a still and
peaceful heart. <span class="margnote">. 2083</span>

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

'Exert yourselves to the utmost, give no place to remissness, for as in
worldly matters when the considerate physician prescribes fit medicine
for the disease he has detected, <span class="margnote">. 2084</span>

'Should the sick man neglect to use it, this cannot be the physician's
fault, so I have told you (now) the truth, and set before you this the
one and level road (the road of plain duty). <span class="margnote">.
2085</span>

'Hearing my words and not with care obeying them, this is not the fault
of him who speaks; if there be anything not clearly understood in the
principles of the "four truths," <span class="margnote">. 2086</span>

'You now may ask me, freely; let not your inward thoughts be longer
hid.' The lord in mercy thus instructing them, the whole assembly
remained silent. <span class="margnote">. 2087</span>

Then Anuruddha, observing that the great congregation continued silent
and expressed no doubt, with closed hands thus spake to Buddha: <span
class="margnote">. 2088</span>

'The moon may be warm, the sun's rays be cool, the air be still <span
id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_822.md), the earth's nature mobile; these four
things, though yet unheard of its the world, (may happen); <span
class="margnote">. 2089</span>

'But this assembly never can have doubt about the principles of sorrow,
accumulation, destruction, and the way (the four truths)--the
incontrovertible truths, as declared by the lord. <span
class="margnote">. 2090</span>

But because the lord is going to die, we all have sorrow (are deeply
affected); and we cannot raise our thoughts to the high theme of the
lord's preaching. <span class="margnote">. 2091</span>

'Perhaps some fresh disciple, whose feelings are

yet not entirely freed (from other influences) \[might doubt\]; but we,
who now have heard this tender, sorrowful discourse, have altogether
freed ourselves from doubt. <span class="margnote">. 2092</span>

'Passed the sea of birth and death, without desire, with nought *t*o
seek, we only know how much we love, and, grieving, ask, why Buddha dies
so quickly?' <span class="margnote">. 2093</span>

Buddha regarding Anuruddha, perceiving how his words were full of
bitterness (sorrow-laden), again with loving heart, appeasing him,
replied: <span class="margnote">. 2094</span>

'In the beginning <span id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_823.md) things were
fixed, in the end again they separate; different combinations cause
other substances, for there is no uniform and constant principle (in
nature). <span class="margnote">. 2095</span>

'But when all mutual purposes be answered (what is for oneself and for
another, be done), what then shall chaos and creation do! the gods and
men alike that should be saved, shall all have been completely saved!
<span class="margnote">. 2096</span>

'Ye then! my followers, who know so well the perfect law, remember! the
end must come (complete destruction of the universe must come); give not
way again to sorrow! <span class="margnote">. 2097</span>

'Use diligently the appointed means; aim to reach the home where
separation cannot come; I have lit the lamp of wisdom, its rays alone
can drive away the gloom that shrouds the world. <span
class="margnote">. 2098</span>

'The world is not for ever fixed! Ye should

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

rejoice therefore! as when a friend, afflicted grievously, his sickness
healed, escapes from pain. <span class="margnote">. 2099</span>

'For I have put away this painful vessel (my painful body), I have
stemmed the flowing sea (sea current) of birth and death, free for ever
now, from pain (the mass of sorrow)! for this you should exult with joy!
<span class="margnote">. 2100</span>

'Now guard yourselves aright, let there be no remissness! that which
exists will all return to nothingness! and now I die. <span
class="margnote">. 2101</span>

'From this time forth my words are done, this is my very last
instruction.' Then entering the Samâdhi of the first Dhyâna, he went
successively through all the nine in a direct order; <span
class="margnote">. 2102</span>

Then inversely he returned throughout and entered on the first, and then
from the first he raised himself and entered on the fourth. <span
class="margnote">. 2103</span>

Leaving the state of Samâdhi, his soul without a resting-place (a house
to lodge in), forthwith he reached Nirvâ*n*a. And then, as Buddha died,
the great earth quaked throughout. <span class="margnote">. 2104</span>

In space, on every hand, was fire like rain (it rained fire) \[or,
possibly, 'there was rain and fire'\], no fuel, self-consuming <span
id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_824.md). And so from out the earth great flames
arose on every side (the eight points of the earth), <span
class="margnote">. 2105</span>

Thus up to the heavenly mansions flames burst forth; the crash of
thunder shook the heavens and earth, rolling along the mountains and the
valleys, <span class="margnote">. 2106</span>

Even as when the Devas and Asuras fight with sound of drums and mutual
conflict. A wind tempestuous from the four bounds of earth arose--

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

whilst from the crags and hills, dust and ashes fell like rain. <span
class="margnote">. 2107</span>

The sun and moon withdrew their shining; the peaceful streams on every
side were torrent-swollen; the sturdy forests shook like aspen leaves,
whilst flowers and leaves untimely fell around, like scattered rain.
<span class="margnote">. 2108</span>

The flying dragons, carried on pitchy clouds, wept down their
tears <span id="fr_825"></span>[1](#fn_825) (five-headed tears.md); the
four kings and their associates, moved by pity <span
id="fr_826"></span>[2](#fn_826.md), forgot their works of charity. <span
class="margnote">. 2109</span>

The pure Devas came to earth from heaven, halting mid-air they looked
upon the changeful scene (or, the death scene), not sorrowing, not
rejoicing. <span class="margnote">. 2110</span>

But yet they sighed to think of the world, heedless of its sacred
teacher, hastening to destruction. The eightfold heavenly spirits <span
id="fr_827"></span>[3](#fn_827.md), on every side filled space, <span
class="margnote">. 2111</span>

Cast down at heart and grieving, they scattered flowers as offerings.
Only Mâra-râ*g*a rejoiced, and struck up sounds of music in his
exultation. <span class="margnote">. 2112</span>

Whilst *G*ambudvîpa <span id="fr_828"></span>[4](#fn_828.md), shorn of its
glory, (seemed. to grieve) as when the mountain tops fall down to earth,
or like the great elephant robbed of its tusks, or like the ox-king
spoiled of his horns; <span class="margnote">. 2113</span>

Or heaven without the sun and moon, or as the lily beaten by the hail;
thus was the world bereaved when Buddha died! <span class="margnote">.
2114</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_797"></span>[290:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_797.md) Called Subhadda in
the Southern accounts.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[290:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_798.md) This may also be
translated 'of small endowments.'

<span id="fn_799"></span>[291:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_799.md) Compare
'Purisa-damma-sârathi,' as before. We observe, again, how the reference
here is to taming of 'horses,' in the Southern accounts to the taming of
the 'steer,' showing the associations of the people using the figure.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[291:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_800.md) 'Sometimes and full
seldom do Tathâgatas appear in the world,' Sacred Books of the East,
vol. xi, p. 104.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[291:3](sbe1928.htm#fr_801.md) Here again the
construction is inverted and un-Chinese, but <span id="page_292">p.
292</span> the sense appears plain, ngo wei to *g*in sing, 'I, to save
men am born.' The idea of Buddha as a saviour of men seems to be a
development of his character as 'teacher' or 'sage.' It expanded
afterwards in Northern Buddhism into the idea of a universal saviour,
and was afterwards merged in the character of Avalokites.vara, a being
'engaged by an eternal oath (covenant) to save all living things.' The
presence of Western modes of thought cannot be doubted here.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[292:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_802.md) According to the
occasion; or, as it was customary on such an occasion.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[292:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_803.md) Compare the Pâli
sarâ*n*iya*m* vitisâretvâ; 'wen sun,' however, in the Chinese, appears
to correspond with the Pâli abhivâdeti.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[292:3](sbe1928.htm#fr_804.md) These teachers are
named in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[293:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_805.md) I think <span
id="img_29300"></span> ![](img/29300.jpg) is for <span
id="img_29301"></span> ![](img/29301.jpg), in which case the line would
be, 'he had long cherished works (karman) not good' (<span
id="img_29302"></span> ![](img/29302.jpg)).

<span id="fn_806"></span>[293:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_806.md) This theory of a
'self-nature' (svabhâva) appears to have prevailed widely about the time
of A*s*vaghosha, the Svabhâvika sect of Buddhists perhaps had their
origin about this time.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[293:3](sbe1928.htm#fr_807.md) That is, 'by the
use of right means.'

<span id="fn_808"></span>[295:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_808.md) Compare this
account with the Pâli (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 110, and
note).

<span id="fn_809"></span>[296:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_809.md) These 'bequeathed
precepts' form a separate tract in the Chinese Buddhist Canon; it is
generally bound up with the 'Sûtra of 42 Sections.' I have translated it
in my first Report on the Chinese Buddhist Books in the Library of the
India Office. \[This Sûtra. in Chinese is called 'an epitome of the
Vinaya.' Is it the 'substance of the Vinaya' referred to in the Bairât
Edict of A*s*oka?\]

<span id="fn_810"></span>[296:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_810.md) Full emancipation
seems here to be a synonym of 'Pratimoksha.' <span id="page_297">p.
297</span> The rules of the Pratimoksha (250 rules) were probably later
in their origin than the rules here given.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[298:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_811.md) This seems to refer
to the offence given by a Bhikshu in asking food, either seeking much or
of different quality to that offered.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[299:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_812.md) So I translate the
symbol 'kia.'

<span id="fn_813"></span>[300:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_813.md) That is, the
hermit, or professed disciple.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[300:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_814.md) Does this refer to
smoothing the hair previous to shaving it off? But the sense in any case
is obscure, for how could a person admit himself to the 'order?'

<span id="fn_815"></span>[301:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_815.md) So the line plainly
means fun hi tsih shi fă, 'joy, like this, is but religion.'

<span id="fn_816"></span>[302:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_816.md) This 'virtuous
friend' is here, probably, to be taken in its literal sense. The 'right
reflection' is samyak sm*ri*ti. And so the others that follow are the
eight portions of the holy path.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[303:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_817.md) Mr. Rhys Davids
(Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 145) is of opinion that samâdhi
in Buddhism corresponds to 'faith' in Christianity. There is much to
bear out this opinion.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[303:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_818.md) The ἔνδυμα (in a
gnostic sense) of the awakened heart; the atmosphere in which the
enlightened heart lives.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[304:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_819.md) Is this the wisdom
of Buddha, dharma and saṅgha? or does it refer to the trividyâs, the
knowledge of impermanence, sorrow, and unreality? See Childers, Pâli
Dict. sub vijja; also Mr. Rhys Davids' Tevi*gg*a Sutta, Introduction,
Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[304:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_820.md) I have finished my
task of love in setting forth to you the way of rest.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[304:3](sbe1928.htm#fr_821.md) 'Behold now,
brethren, I exhort you, saying, "Decay is inherent in all component
things! Work out your salvation with diligence!" Sacred Books of the
East, vol. xi, p. 114.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[305:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_822.md) In the sense of'
fixed' or 'solid.'

<span id="fn_823"></span>[306:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_823.md) This is a very
singular passage; it refers to the Buddhist theory that the world
(universe) is continually renewed and destroyed, but here we have the
novel addition that in 'the end' all this will cease, and there will be
no chaos ('void,' hung) and no renovation (re-creation).

<span id="fn_824"></span>[307:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_824.md) That is, the fire
was self-originated, and was supported without fuel.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[308:1](sbe1928.htm#fr_825.md) This passage is
obscure, it may mean the dragons wept tears from their five heads, but
it is doubtful.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[308:2](sbe1928.htm#fr_826.md) Here again is an
error in the text, the symbol <span id="img_30800"></span>
![](img/30800.jpg) being clearly a misprint.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[308:3](sbe1928.htm#fr_827.md) That is, Nâgas,
Kinnaras, and the rest.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[308:4](sbe1928.htm#fr_828.md) That is, 'the
world,' as Buddhists count it.
