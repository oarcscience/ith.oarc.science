### VARGA 17. THE GREAT DISCIPLE BECOMES A HERMIT.

At this time Bimbisâra Râ*g*a, bowing his head, requested the honoured
of the world to change his

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

place of abode for the bamboo grove <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md); graciously accepting it, Buddha
remained silent. <span class="margnote">. 1380</span>

Then the king, having perceived the truth, offered his adoration and
returned to his palace. The world-honoured, with the great congregation,
proceeded on foot, to rest for awhile in the bamboo garden <span
id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_490.md). <span class="margnote">. 1381</span>

(There he dwelt) to convert all that breathed <span
id="fr_491"></span>[3](#fn_491.md), to kindle once for all <span
id="fr_492"></span>[4](#fn_492.md) the lamp of wisdom, to establish Brahma
and the Devas, and to confirm the lives <span
id="fr_493"></span>[5](#fn_493.md) of saints and sages. <span
class="margnote">. 1382</span>

At this time A*s*va*g*it and Vâshpa <span
id="fr_494"></span>[6](#fn_494.md), with heart composed and every member
(sense) subdued, the time having come for begging food, entered into the
town of Râ*g*ag*ri*ha: <span class="margnote">. 1383</span>

Unrivalled in the world were they for grace of person, and in dignity of
carriage excelling all. The lords and ladies of the city seeing them,
were filled with joy; <span class="margnote">. 1384</span>

Those who were walking stood still, those before waited, those behind
hastened on. Now the *Ri*shi: Kapila amongst all his numerous disciples
<span class="margnote">. 1385</span>

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

Had one of wide-spread fame, whose name was *S*âriputra; he, beholding
the wonderful grace of the Bhikshus, their composed mien and subdued
senses, <span class="margnote">. 1386</span>

Their dignified walk and carriage, raising his hands, enquiring, said:
'Young in years, but pure and graceful in appearance, such as I before
have never seen, <span class="margnote">. 1387</span>

'What law most excellent (have you obeyed)? and who your master that has
taught you? and what the doctrine you have learned? Tell me, I pray you,
and relieve my doubts.' <span class="margnote">. 1388</span>

Then of the Bhikshus, one <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_495.md),
rejoicing at his question, with pleasing air and gracious words,
replied: 'The omniscient, born of the Ikshvâku family, <span
class="margnote">. 1389</span>

'The very first ’midst gods and men, this one is my great master. I am
indeed but young, the sun of. wisdom has but just arisen, <span
class="margnote">. 1390</span>

'How can I then explain the master's doctrine? Its meaning is deep and
very hard to understand, but now, according to my poor capability
(wisdom), I will recount in brief the master's doctrine: <span
class="margnote">. 1391</span>

'"Whatever things exist all spring from cause, the principles (cause) of
birth and death (may be) destroyed, the way is by the means he has
declared <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_496.md)."' <span
class="margnote">. 1392</span>

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

Then the twice-born Upata (Upatishya), embracing heartily what he had
heard, put from him all sense-pollution, and obtained the pure eyes of
the law. <span class="margnote">. 1393</span>

The former explanations he had trusted, respecting cause and what was
not the cause, that there was nothing that was made, but was made by
Î*s*vara, <span class="margnote">. 1394</span>

All this, now that he had heard the rule of true causation,
understanding (penetrating) the wisdom of the no-self, adding thereto
the knowledge of the minute (dust) troubles <span
id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_497.md), which can never be overcome in their
completeness (completely destroyed), <span class="margnote">.
1395</span>

But by the teaching of Tathâgata, all this he now for ever put away;
leaving no room for thought of self, the thought of self will
disappear <span id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_498.md). <span
class="margnote">. 1396</span>

'Who, when the brightness of the sun gives light, would call for the
dimness of the lamp? for, like the severing of the lotus, the stem once
cut, the pods (?) will also die; <span class="margnote">. 1397</span>

'So Buddha's teaching cutting off the stem of sorrow, no seeds are left
to grow or lead to further increase.' Then bowing at the Bhikshu's feet,
with grateful mien, he wended homewards. <span class="margnote">.
1398</span>

The Bhikshus after having begged their food, likewise went back to the
bamboo grove. Sâriputra

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

on his arrival home, (rested) with joyful face and full of peace. <span
class="margnote">. 1399</span>

His friend the honoured Mugalin (Maudgalyâyana), equally renowned for
learning, seeing *S*âriputra in the distance <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_499.md), his pleasing air and lightsome step,
<span class="margnote">. 1400</span>

Spoke thus: 'As I now see thee, there is an unusual look I notice, your
former nature seems quite changed, the signs of happiness I now observe,
<span class="margnote">. 1401</span>

'All indicate the possession of eternal truth, these marks are not
uncaused.' Answering he said: The words of the Tathâgata are such as
never yet were spoken;' <span class="margnote">. 1402</span>

And then, requested, he declared (what he had heard). Hearing the words
and understanding them, he too put off the world's defilement, and
gained the eyes of true religion, <span class="margnote">. 1403</span>

The reward of a long-planted virtuous cause; and, as one sees by a lamp
that comes to hand, so he obtained an unmoved faith in Buddha; and now
they both set out for Buddha's presence, <span class="margnote">.
1404</span>

With a large crowd of followers, two hundred men and fifty. Buddha
seeing the two worthies <span id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_500.md) coming,
spoke thus to his disciples: <span class="margnote">. 1405</span>

'These two men who come shall be my two most eminent followers, one
unsurpassed for wisdom, the other for powers miraculous;' <span
class="margnote">. 1406</span>

And then with Brahma's voice <span id="fr_501"></span>[3](#fn_501.md),
profound and

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

sweet, he forthwith bade them 'Welcome!' Here is the pure and peaceful
law (he said); here the end of all discipleship! <span
class="margnote">. 1407</span>

Their hands grasping the triple-staff <span
id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_502.md), their twisted hair holding the
water-vessel <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_503.md), hearing the words of
Buddha's welcome, they forthwith changed into complete
*S*rama*n*as <span id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_504.md); <span
class="margnote">. 1408</span>

The leaders two and all their followers, assuming the complete
appearance of Bhikshus, with prostrate forms fell down at Buddha's feet,
then rising, sat beside him <span id="fr_505"></span>[4](#fn_505.md): <span
class="margnote">. 1409</span>

And with obedient heart listening to the word, they all became Rahats.
At this time there was a twice-(born) sage <span
id="fr_506"></span>[5](#fn_506), Kâ*s*yapa Shi-ming-teng (Eggidatta.md)
(Agnidatta), <span class="margnote">. 1410</span>

Celebrated and perfect in person, rich in possessions, and his wife most
virtuous. But all this he

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

had left and become a hermit, seeking the way of salvation. <span
class="margnote">. 1411</span>

And now in the way by the To-tseu <span id="fr_507"></span>[1](#fn_507.md)
tower he suddenly encountered *S*âkya Muni, remarkable for his dignified
and illustrious appearance, as the embroidered flag of a Deva (temple);
<span class="margnote">. 1412</span>

Respectfully and reverently approaching, with head bowed down, he
worshipped his feet, whilst he said: 'Truly, honoured one, you are my
teacher, and I am your follower, <span class="margnote">. 1413</span>

'Much and long time have I been harassed with doubts, oh! would that you
would light the lamp <span id="fr_508"></span>[2](#fn_508.md) (of
knowledge).' Buddha knowing that this twice-(born) sage was heartily
desirous of finding the best mode of escape <span
id="fr_509"></span>[3](#fn_509.md), <span class="margnote">. 1414</span>

With soft and pliant voice, he bade him come and welcome. Hearing his
bidding and his heart complying, losing all listlessness of body or
spirit, <span class="margnote">. 1415</span>

His soul embraced the terms of this most excellent salvation <span
id="fr_510"></span>[4](#fn_510.md). Quiet and calm, putting away
defilement, the great merciful, as he alone knew how, briefly explained
the mode of this deliverance, <span class="margnote">. 1416</span>

Exhibiting the secrets of his law, ending with}

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

the four indestructible acquirements <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_511.md). The great sage, everywhere celebrated,
was called Mahâ Kâ*s*yapa, <span class="margnote">. 1417</span>

His original faith was that 'body and soul are different,' but he had
also held that they are the same, that there was both 'I' and a
place <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_512.md) for I; but now he for ever
cast away his former faith, <span class="margnote">. 1418</span>

And considered only (the truth) that 'sorrow' is ever accumulating; so
(he argued) by removing sorrow there will be 'no remains' (i.e. no
subject for suffering); obedience to the precepts and the practice of
discipline, though not themselves the cause, yet he considered these the
necessary mode by which to find deliverance. <span class="margnote">.
1419</span>

With equal and impartial mind, he considered the nature of sorrow, for
evermore freed from a cleaving heart. Whether we think 'this is,' or
'this is not' (he thought), both tend to produce a listless (idle) mode
of life; <span class="margnote">. 1420</span>

But when with equal mind we see the truth, then certainty is produced
and no more doubt. If we rely for support on wealth or form, then wild
confusion and concupiscence result, <span class="margnote">. 1421</span>

Inconstant and impure. But lust and covetous desire removed, the heart
of love and equal thoughts produced, there can be then no enemies or
friends (variance), <span class="margnote">. 1422</span>

But the heart is pitiful and kindly disposed to all, and thus is
destroyed the power of anger and of hate. Trusting to outward things and
their relationships, then crowding thoughts of every kind are gendered;
<span class="margnote">. 1423</span>

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Reflecting well, and crushing out confusing thought, then lust for
pleasure is destroyed. Though born in the Arûpa world (he saw) that
there would be a remnant of life still left; <span class="margnote">.
1424</span>

Unacquainted with the four right truths, he had felt an eager longing
for this deliverance, for the quiet resulting from the absence of all
thought. And now putting away for ever covetous desire for such a
formless state of being, <span class="margnote">. 1425</span>

His restless heart was agitated still, as the stream is excited by the
rude wind. Then entering on deep reflection in quiet he subdued his
troubled mind, <span class="margnote">. 1426</span>

And realised the truth of there being no 'self,' and that therefore
birth and death are no realities; but beyond this point he rose not, his
thought of 'self' destroyed, all else was lost. <span class="margnote">.
1427</span>

But now the lamp of wisdom lit, the gloom of every doubt dispersed, he
saw an end to that which seemed without an end; ignorance finally
dispelled, <span class="margnote">. 1428</span>

He considered the ten points of excellence; the ten seeds of sorrow
destroyed, he came once more to life, and what he ought to do, he did.
And now regarding with reverence the face of his lord, <span
class="margnote">. 1429</span>

He put away the three <span id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_513.md) and gained
the three <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_514.md); so were there three
disciples <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_515.md) in addition to the

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

three <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_516.md); and as the three stars
range around the Trayastri*m*sas heaven, <span class="margnote">.
1430</span>

Waiting upon the three and five <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_517.md),
so the three wait on Buddha. <span class="margnote">. 1431</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_489"></span>[193:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_489.md) This garden, called
the Kara*nd*a Ve*n*uvana, was a favourite residence of Buddha. For an
account of it, see Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism, p. 194. It was
situated between the old city of Râ*g*ag*ri*ha and the new city, about
three hundred yards to the north of the former (see Fă-lien, chap. xxx,
Beal's translation, p. 117 and note 2).

<span id="fn_490"></span>[193:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_490.md) I have translated
Ku’an 'to rest awhile,' it might be supposed to refer to the rest of the
rainy season. But it is doubtful whether this ordinance was instituted
so early.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[193:3](sbe1919.htm#fr_491.md) All living things.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[193:4](sbe1919.htm#fr_492.md) To establish and
settle the brightness of the lamp of wisdom.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[193:5](sbe1919.htm#fr_493.md) To establish the
settlement of sages and saints.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[193:6](sbe1919.htm#fr_494.md) He is sometimes
called Da*s*abala Kâ*s*yapa (Eitel, Handbook, p. 158 b).

<span id="fn_495"></span>[194:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_495.md) In the Pâli account
of this incident A*s*va*g*it alone is represented as begging his food;
but here A*s*va*g*it and Vâshpa are joined according to the later rule
(as it would seem) which forbad one mendicant to proceed alone through a
town. (Compare Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiii, p. 344.)

<span id="fn_496"></span>[194:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_496.md) For the Southern
version of this famous stanza, see Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiii,
p. 146; also Manual of Buddhism, <span id="page_195">p. 195</span> p.
196. For a similar account from the Chinese, see Wong Puh, § 77.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[195:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_497.md) The 'dust troubles'
are the troubles caused by objects of sense, as numerous as motes in a
sunbeam.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[195:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_498.md) 'Look upon the
world as void, O Mogharâ*g*an, being always thoughtful; having destroyed
the view of oneself-(as really existing), so one may overcome death; the
king of death will not see him who thus regards the world,' Sutta
Nipâta, Fausböll, p. 208.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[196:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_499.md) 'Then the
paribbâ*g*aka Sâriputta went to the place where the paribbâ*g*aka
Moggallâna was,' Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiii, p. 147.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[196:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_500.md) The two 'bhadras,'
i.e. 'sages,' or 'virtuous ones.'

<span id="fn_501"></span>[196:3](sbe1919.htm#fr_501.md) Or, with
'Brahma-voice' (Brahmaghosha), for which, see Childers sub voce.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[197:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_502.md) This triple
(three-wonderful) staff is, I suppose, a mark of a Brahman student.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[197:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_503.md) Twisted hair
holding the pitcher; this may also refer to some custom among the
Brahmans. Or the line may be rendered, 'their hair twisted and holding
their pitchers.'

<span id="fn_504"></span>[197:3](sbe1919.htm#fr_504.md) This sudden
transformation from the garb and appearance of laymen into shorn and
vested Bhikshus, is one often recounted in Buddhist stories.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[197:4](sbe1919.htm#fr_505.md) Or, sat on one side
(ekamantam).

<span id="fn_506"></span>[197:5](sbe1919.htm#fr_506.md) This expression,
which might also be rendered 'two religious leaders' (’rh sse), may
also, by supplying the word 'sing,' be translated a 'twice-born sage,'
i.e. a Brahman; and this appears more apposite with what follows, and
therefore I have adopted it. The Brahman alluded to would then be called
Kâ*s*yapa Agnidatta. The story of Eggidatta is given by Bigandet
(Legend, p. 180, first edition), but there is nothing said about his
name Kâ*s*yapa. Eitel (Handbook, sub voce Mahâkâ*s*yapa) gives an
explanation of the name Kâ*s*yapa,' he who swallowed light;' but the
literal translation of the words in our text is, 'Kâ*s*yapa giving in
charity a bright lamp.'

<span id="fn_507"></span>[198:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_507.md) This 'many
children' tower is perhaps the one at Vai*s*âlî alluded to by Fă-hien,
chap. xxv.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[198:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_508.md) Here the phrase
'teng ming,' light of the lamp, seems to be a play on the name 'ming
teng,' bright lamp. The method and way in which a disciple
(saddhivihârika) chooses a master (upa*ggh*âya) is explained, Sacred
Books of the East, vol. xiii, p. 154.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[198:3](sbe1919.htm#fr_509) Literally, '(had.md) a
heart rejoicing in the most complete method of salvation (moksha).'

<span id="fn_510"></span>[198:4](sbe1919.htm#fr_510.md) Or, 'the mode of
salvation explained by the most excellent (Buddha).'

<span id="fn_511"></span>[199:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_511.md)
*K*atu*h*-samyak-pradhâna?

<span id="fn_512"></span>[199:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_512.md) <span
id="img_19900"></span> ![](img/19900.jpg) 'the place of.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[200:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_513.md) The three poisons,
lust, hatred, ignorance.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[200:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_514.md) The three treasures
(triratna), Buddha, the law, the community.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[200:3](sbe1919.htm#fr_515.md) The three
disciples, as it seems, were *S*âriputra, Maudgalyâyana, and Agnidatta
(Kâ*s*yapa).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[201:1](sbe1919.htm#fr_516.md) In addition to the
three brothers (the Kâ*s*yapas).

<span id="fn_517"></span>[201:2](sbe1919.htm#fr_517.md) The allusion here
is obscure; there may be a misprint in the text.
