# KIOUEN IV.

### VARGA 16. BIMBISÂRA RÂ*G*A BECOMES A DISCIPLE.

And now those five men, A*s*va*g*it, Vâshpa, and the others, having
heard that he (Kau*nd*inya) 'knew' the law, with humble mien and
self-subdued, <span class="margnote">. 1277</span>

Their hands joined, offered their homage, and looked with reverence in
the teacher's face. Tathâgata, by wise expedient, caused them one by one
to embrace the law. <span class="margnote">. 1278</span>

And so from first to last the five Bhikshus obtained reason and subdued
their senses, like the five stars which shine in heaven, waiting upon
the brightening moon. <span class="margnote">. 1279</span>

At this time in the town of Ku-i <span id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_475.md)
(Ku*s*inârâ) there was a noble's son (called) Yasas; lost in night-sleep
suddenly he woke, and when he saw his attendants all, <span
class="margnote">. 1280</span>

Men and women, with ill-clad bodies, sleeping, his heart was filled with
loathing; reflecting on the root of sorrow, (he thought) how madly
foolish men were immersed in it; <span class="margnote">. 1281</span>

Clothing himself, and putting on his jewels, he left his home and
wandered forth; then on the way he stood and cried aloud, 'Alas! alas!
what endless chain of sorrows.' <span class="margnote">. 1282</span>

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Tathâgata, by night, was walking forth, and hearing sounds like these,
'Alas! what sorrow,' forthwith replied, 'You are welcome! here, on the
other hand, there is a place of rest, <span class="margnote">.
1283</span>

'The most excellent, refreshing, Nirvâ*n*a, quiet and unmoved, free from
sorrow.' Yasas hearing Buddha's exhortation, there rose much joy within
his heart, <span class="margnote">. 1284</span>

And in the place of the disgust he felt, the cooling streams of holy
wisdom found their way, as when one enters first a cold pellucid lake.
Advancing then, he came where Buddha was; <span class="margnote">.
1285</span>

His person decked with common ornaments, his mind already freed from all
defects; by power of the good root obtained in other births, he quickly
reached the fruit of an Arhat; <span class="margnote">. 1286</span>

The secret light of pure wisdom's virtue (li) enabled him to understand,
on listening to the law; just as a pure silken fabric <span
id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_476.md) with ease is dyed a different colour;
<span class="margnote">. 1287</span>

Thus having attained to self-illumination, and done that which was to be
done, (he was converted); then looking at his person richly ornamented,
his heart was filled with shame. <span class="margnote">. 1288</span>

Tathâgata knowing his inward thoughts, in gâthas spoke the following
words: 'Tho’ ornamented with jewels, the heart may yet have conquered
sense; <span class="margnote">. 1289</span>

'Looking with equal mind on all that lives, (in such a case) the outward
form does not affect religion; the body, too, may wear the ascetic's
garb, the heart, meanwhile, be immersed in worldly thoughts; <span
class="margnote">. 1290</span>

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

'Dwelling in lonely woods, yet covetous of worldly show, such men are
after all mere worldlings; the body may have a worldly guise, the heart
mount high to things celestial; <span class="margnote">. 1291</span>

'The layman and the hermit are the same, when only both have banished
thought of "self," but if the heart be twined with carnal bonds, what
use the marks of bodily attention? <span class="margnote">. 1292</span>

'He who wears martial decorations, does so because by valour he has
triumphed o’er an enemy,--so he who wears the hermit's colour’d robe,
does so for having vanquished sorrow as his foe.' <span
class="margnote">. 1293</span>

Then he bade him come, and be a member of his church (a Bhikshu); and at
the bidding to! his garments changed! and he stood wholly attired in
hermit's dress, complete; in heart and outward look, a *S*rama*n*a.
<span class="margnote">. 1294</span>

Now (Yasas) had in former days some light companions, in number fifty
and four; when these beheld their friend a hermit, they. too, one by
one, attained true wisdom \[entered the true law\]; <span
class="margnote">. 1295</span>

By virtue of deeds done in former births, these deeds now bore their
perfect fruit. Just as when burning ashes are sprinkled by water, the
water being dried, the flame bursts forth. <span class="margnote">.
1296</span>

So now, with those above, the *S*râvakas (disciples) were altogether
sixty, all Arhats; entirely obedient and instructed in the law of
perfect discipleship <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md). So perfected
he taught them further: <span class="margnote">. 1297</span>

'Now ye have passed the stream and reached "the other shore," across the
sea of birth and death;

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

what should be done, ye now have done! and ye may now receive the
charity of others. <span class="margnote">. 1298</span>

'Go then through every country, convert those not yet converted;
throughout the world that lies burnt up with sorrow, teach everywhere;
(instruct) those lacking right instruction; <span class="margnote">.
1299</span>

'Go, therefore! each one travelling by himself <span
id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_478.md); filled with compassion, go! rescue and
receive. I too will go alone, back to yonder Kia-*k*e <span
id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479.md) mountain; <span class="margnote">.
1300</span>

'Where there are great *Ri*shis, royal *Ri*shis, Brahman *Ri*shis too,
these all dwell there, influencing, men according to their schools;
<span class="margnote">. 1301</span>

'The *Ri*shi Kâ*s*yapa, enduring pain, reverenced by all the country,
making converts too of many, him will I visit and convert.' <span
class="margnote">. 1302</span>

Then the sixty Bhikshus respectfully receiving orders to preach, each
according to his fore-determined purpose, following his inclination,
went thro’ every land; <span class="margnote">. 1303</span>

The honour'd of the world went on alone, till he arrived at the Kia-ke
mountain, then entering a retired religious dell, he came. to where the
*Ri*shi Kâ*s*yapa was. <span class="margnote">. 1304</span>

Now this one had a 'fire grot' where he offered sacrifice, where an evil
Nâga dwelt <span id="fr_480"></span>[3](#fn_480.md), who wandered here and
there in search of rest, through mountains and wild places of the earth.
<span class="margnote">. 1305</span>

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

The honoured of the world,.(wishing) to instruct this hermit and convert
him, asked him, on coming, for a place to lodge that night. Kâ*s*yapa,
replying, spake to Buddha thus: 'I have no resting-place to offer for
the night, <span class="margnote">. 1306</span>

'Only this fire grot where I sacrifice, this is a cool and fit place for
the purpose, but an evil dragon dwells there, who is accustomed, as he
can, to poison men.' <span class="margnote">. 1307</span>

Buddha replied, 'Permit me only, and for the night I'll take my dwelling
there,' Kâ*s*yapa made many difficulties, but the world-honoured one
still asked the favour. <span class="margnote">. 1308</span>

Then Kâ*s*yapa addressed Buddha, 'My mind desires no controversy, only I
have my fears and apprehensions, but follow you your own good pleasure.'
<span class="margnote">. 1309</span>

Buddha forthwith stepped within the fiery grot, and took his seat with
dignity and deep reflection; and now the evil Nâga seeing Buddha,
belched forth in rage his fiery poison, <span class="margnote">.
1310</span>

And filled the place with burning vapour. But this could not affect the
form of Buddha. Through-out the abode the fire consumed itself, the
honoured of the world still sat composed: <span class="margnote">.
1311</span>

Even as Brahma, in the midst of the kalpa-fire that burns and reaches to
the Brahma heavens, still sits unmoved, without a thought of fear or
apprehension, <span class="margnote">. 1312</span>

(So Buddha sat); the evil Nâga seeing him, his face glowing with peace,
and still unchanged, ceased his poisonous blast, his heart appeased; he
bent his head and worshipped. <span class="margnote">. 1313</span>

Kâ*s*yapa in the night seeing the fire-glow, sighed;

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Ah! alas! what
misery! this most distinguished man is also burnt up by the fiery Nâga,'
<span class="margnote">. 1314</span>

Then Kâ*s*yapa and his followers at morning light came one and all to
look. Now Buddha having subdued the evil Nâga, had straightway placed
him in his pâtra, <span class="margnote">. 1315</span>

(Beholding which) and seeing the power of Buddha, Kâ*s*yapa conceived
within him deep and secret thoughts: 'This Gotama,' he thought, 'is
deeply versed (in religion), but still he said, "I am a master of
religion."' <span class="margnote">. 1316</span>

Then Buddha, as occasion offered, displayed all kinds of spiritual
changes <span id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481.md), influencing his
(Kâ*s*yapa's) heart-thoughts, changing and subduing them; <span
class="margnote">. 1317</span>

Making his mind pliant and yielding, until at length prepared to be a
vessel of the true law, he confessed that his poor wisdom could not
compare with the complete wisdom of the world-honoured one. <span
class="margnote">. 1318</span>

And so, convinced at last, humbly submitting, he accepted right
instruction. (Thus) U-pi-lo (Uravilva) Kâ*s*yapa, and five hundred of
his followers <span class="margnote">. 1319</span>

Following their master, virtuously submissive, in turn received the
teaching of the law. Kâ*s*yapa and all his followers were thus entirely
converted. <span class="margnote">. 1320</span>

The *Ri*shi then, taking his goods and all his sacrificial vessels,
threw them together in the river, which floated down upon the surface of
the current. <span class="margnote">. 1321</span>

Nadi and Gada, brothers, who dwelt adown the stream, seeing these
articles of clothing (and the rest) floating along the stream
disorderly, <span class="margnote">. 1322</span>

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Said, 'Some great change has happened,' and deeply pained, were
restlessly (concerned). The two, each with five hundred followers, going
up the stream to seek their brother, <span class="margnote">.
1323</span>

Seeing him now dressed as a hermit, and all his followers with him,
having got knowledge of the miraculous law--strange thoughts engaged
their minds-- 1324

'Our brother having submitted thus, we too should also follow him (they
said).' Thus the three brothers, with all their band of followers, <span
class="margnote">. 1325</span>

Were brought to hear the lord's discourse on the comparison of a fire
sacrifice <span id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_482.md): (and in the discourse
he taught), 'How the dark smoke of ignorance arises <span
id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_483.md), whilst confused thoughts, like wood
drilled into wood, create the fire, <span class="margnote">. 1326</span>

'Lust, anger, delusion, these are as fire produced, and these enflame
and burn all living things. Thus the fire of grief and sorrow, once
enkindled, ceases not to burn, <span class="margnote">. 1327</span>

'Ever giving rise to birth and death; but whilst this fire of sorrow
ceases not, yet are there two kinds of fire, one that burns but has no
fuel left; <span class="margnote">. 1328</span>

'So when the heart of man has once conceived distaste for sin, this
distaste removing covetous desire, covetous desire extinguished, there
is rescue; <span class="margnote">. 1329</span>

'If once this rescue has been found, then with it is born sight and
knowledge, by which distinguishing

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

the streams of birth and death, and practising pure conduct, <span
class="margnote">. 1330</span>

'All is done that should be done, and hereafter shall be no more life
(bhava).' Thus the thousand Bhikshus hearing the world-honoured preach,
<span class="margnote">. 1331</span>

All defects <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484.md) for ever done away,
their minds found perfect and complete deliverance. Then Buddha for the
Kâ*s*yapas' sakes, and for the benefit of the thousand Bhikshus, having
preached, <span class="margnote">. 1332</span>

And done all that should be done, himself with purity and wisdom and all
the concourse of high qualities excellently adorned, he gave them, as in
charity, rules for cleansing sense. <span class="margnote">. 1333</span>

The great *Ri*shi, listening to reason, lost all regard for bodily
austerities, and, as a man without a guide, was emptied of himself, and
learned discipleship. <span class="margnote">. 1334</span>

And now the honoured one and all his followers go forward to the royal
city <span id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_485) (Râ*g*ag*ri*ha.md), remembering,
as he did, the Magadha king, and what he heretofore had promised. 1335.

The honoured one when he arrived, remained within the 'staff grove <span
id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_486.md);' Bimbisâra Râ*g*a hearing thereof, with
all his company of courtiers, <span class="margnote">. 1336</span>

Lords and ladies all surrounding him, came to where the master was. Then
at a distance seeing Buddha seated, with humbled heart and subdued
presence, <span class="margnote">. 1337</span>

Putting off his common ornaments, descending from his chariot, forward
he stepped; even as

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*akra, king of
gods, going to where Brahmadevarâ*g*a dwells. <span class="margnote">.
1338</span>

Bowing down at Buddha's feet, he asked him, with respect, about his
health of body; Buddha in his turn, having made enquiries, begged him to
be seated on one side. <span class="margnote">. 1339</span>

Then the king's mind reflected silently: 'This *S*âkya must have great
controlling power, to subject to his will these Kâ*s*yapas who now are
round him as disciples.' <span class="margnote">. 1340</span>

Buddha, knowing all thoughts, spoke thus to Kâ*s*yapa, questioning him:
'What profit have you found in giving up your fire-adoring law?' <span
class="margnote">. 1341</span>

Kâ*s*yapa hearing Buddha's words, rising with dignity before the great
assembly, bowed lowly down, and then with clasped hands and a loud voice
addressing Buddha, said: <span class="margnote">. 1342</span>

'The profit I received, adoring the fire spirit, was this,--continuance
in the wheel of life, birth and death with all their sorrows
growing,--this service I have therefore cast away; <span
class="margnote">. 1343</span>

'Diligently I persevered in fire-worship, seeking to put an end to the
five desires, in return I found desires endlessly increasing, therefore
have I cast off this service. <span class="margnote">. 1344</span>

'Sacrificing thus to fire with many Mantras, I did but miss (i.e. I did
not find) escape from birth; receiving birth, with it came all its
sorrows, therefore I cast it off and sought for rest. <span
class="margnote">. 1345</span>

'I was versed, indeed, in self-affliction, my mode of worship largely
adopted, and counted of all most excellent, and yet I was opposed to
highest wisdom. <span class="margnote">. 1346</span>

'Therefore have I discarded it, and gone in quest

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

of the supreme Nirvâ*n*a. Removing from me birth, old age, disease, and
death, I sought a place of undying rest and calm. <span
class="margnote">. 1347</span>

'And as I gained the knowledge of this truth, then I cast off the law of
worshipping the fire (or, by fire).' The honoured-of-the-world, hearing
Kâ*s*yapa declaring his experience of truth, <span class="margnote">.
1348</span>

Wishing to move the world throughout to conceive a heart of purity and
faith, addressing Kâ*s*yapa further, said,' Welcome! great master,
welcome! <span class="margnote">. 1349</span>

'Rightly have you distinguished law from law, and well obtained the
highest wisdom; now before this great assembly, pray you! exhibit your
excellent endowments; <span class="margnote">. 1350</span>

'As any rich and wealthy noble opens for view his costly treasures,
causing the poor and sorrow-laden multitude to increase their
forgetfulness awhile; <span class="margnote">. 1351</span>

'(So do you now) and honour well your lord's instruction.' Forthwith in
presence of the assembly, gathering up his body and entering Samâdhi,
calmly he ascended into space, <span class="margnote">. 1352</span>

And there displayed himself, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping,
emitting fiery vapour from his body, on his right and left side water
and fire, not burning and not moistening him; <span class="margnote">.
1353</span>

Then clouds and rain proceeded from him, thunder with lightning shook
the heaven and earth; thus he drew the world to look in adoration, with
eyes undazzled as they gazed; <span class="margnote">. 1354</span>

With different mouths, but all in language one, they magnified and
praised this wondrous spectacle, then afterwards drawn by spiritual
force, they came and worshipped at the master's feet, <span
class="margnote">. 1355</span>

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

(Exclaiming), 'Buddha is our great teacher! we are the honoured one's
disciples! Thus having magnified his work and finished all he purposed
doing, <span class="margnote">. 1356</span>

Drawing the world as universal witness, the assembly was convinced that
he, the world-honoured, was truly the 'Omniscient!' <span
class="margnote">. 1357</span>

Buddha, perceiving that the whole assembly was ready as a vessel to
receive the law, spoke thus to Bimbisâra Râ*g*a: 'Listen now and
understand; <span class="margnote">. 1358</span>

'The mind, the thoughts, and all the senses are subject to the law of
life and death. This fault <span id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_487.md) of
birth and death, once understood, then there is clear and plain
perception; <span class="margnote">. 1359</span>

'Obtaining this clear perception, then there is born knowledge of self,
knowing oneself and with this knowledge laws of birth and death, then
there is no grasping and no sense-perception. <span class="margnote">.
1360</span>

'Knowing oneself, and understanding how the senses act, then there is no
room for "I," or ground for framing it; then all the accumulated mass of
sorrow, sorrows born from life and death, <span class="margnote">.
1361</span>

'Being recognised as attributes of body, and as this body is not "I,"
nor offers ground for "I," then comes the great superlative (discovery),
the source of peace unending; <span class="margnote">. 1362</span>

'This thought (view) of "self" gives rise to all these sorrows, binding
as with cords <span id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_488.md) the world, but
having found there is no "I" that can be bound, then all these bonds are
severed. <span class="margnote">. 1363</span>

'There are no bonds indeed--they disappear--

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

and seeing this there is deliverance. The world holds to this thought of
"I," and so, from this, comes false apprehension. <span
class="margnote">. 1364</span>

'Of those who maintain the truth of it, some say the "I" endures, some
say it perishes; taking the two extremes of birth and death, their error
is most grievous! <span class="margnote">. 1365</span>

'For if they say the "I" (soul) is perishable, the fruit they strive
for, too, will perish; and at some time there will be no hereafter, this
is indeed a meritless deliverance. <span class="margnote">. 1366</span>

'But if they say the "I" is not to perish, then in the midst of all this
life and death there is but one identity (as space), which is not born
and does not die. <span class="margnote">. 1367</span>

'If this is what they call the "I," then are all things living, one--for
all have this unchanging self--not perfected by any deeds, but
self-perfect; <span class="margnote">. 1368</span>

'If so, if such a self it is that acts, let there be no self-mortifying
conduct, the self is lord and master; what need to do that which is
done? <span class="margnote">. 1369</span>

'For if this "I" is lasting and imperishable, then reason would teach it
never can be changed. But now we see the marks of joy and sorrow, what
room for constancy then is here? <span class="margnote">. 1370</span>

'Knowing that birth brings this deliverance then I put away all thought
of sin's defilement; the whole world, everything, endures! what then
becomes of this idea of rescue. <span class="margnote">. 1371</span>

'We cannot even talk of putting self away, truth is the same as
falsehood, it is not "I" that do a thing, and who, forsooth, is he that
talks of "I?" <span class="margnote">. 1372</span>

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

'But if it is not "I" that do the thing, then there is no "I" that does
it, and in the absence of these both, there is no "I" at all, in very
truth. <span class="margnote">. 1373</span>

'No doer and no knower, no lord, yet notwithstanding this, there ever
lasts this birth and death, like morn and night ever recurring. But now
attend to me and listen; <span class="margnote">. 1374</span>

'The senses six and their six objects united cause the six kinds of
knowledge, these three (i.e. senses, objects, and resulting knowledge)
united bring forth contact, then the intervolved effects of recollection
(follow). <span class="margnote">. 1375</span>

'Then like the burning glass and tinder thro’ the sun's power cause fire
to appear, so thro’ the knowledge born of sense and object, the lord (of
knowledge) (self) (like the fire) is born. <span class="margnote">.
1376</span>

'The shoot springs from the seed, the seed is not the shoot, not one and
yet not different, such is the birth of all that lives.' <span
class="margnote">. 1377</span>

The honoured of the world preaching the truth, the equal and impartial
paramârtha, thus addressed the king with all his followers. Then king
Bimbisâra filled with joy, <span class="margnote">. 1378</span>

Removing from himself defilement, gained religious sight, a hundred
thousand spirits also, hearing the words of the immortal law, shook off
and lost the stain of sin. <span class="margnote">. 1379</span>
