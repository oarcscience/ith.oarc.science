</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">VARGA 7. ENTERING THE PLACE (WOOD) OF AUSTERITIES.</h3>  
<p>The prince having dismissed <I>K</I>andaka, as he entered the <I>Ri</I>shis' abode, his graceful body brightly</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></p>  
<p>shining, lit up on every side the forest 'place of suffering;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 495</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Himself gifted with every excellence (Siddh&acirc;rtha), according to his gifts, so were they reflected. As the lion, the king of beasts, when he enters among the herd of beasts, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 496</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Drives from their minds all thoughts of common things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, as now they watch the true form of their kind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so those <I>Ri</I>shi masters assembled there, suddenly perceiving the miraculous portent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 497</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Were struck with awe and fearful gladness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, as they gazed with earnest eyes and hands conjoined. The men and women too, engaged in various occupations, beholding him, with unchanged attitudes, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 498</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Gazed as the gods look on king <I>S</I>akra, with constant look and eyes unmoved; so the <I>Ri</I>shis, with their feet fixed fast, looked at him even thus; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 499</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whatever in their hands they held, without releasing it, they stopped and looked; even as the ox when yoked to the wain, his body bound, his mind also restrained; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 500</FONT></span></p>  
<p>So also the followers of the holy <I>Ri</I>shis, each called the other to behold the miracle. The peacocks and the other birds with cries commingled flapped their wings; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 501</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins holding the rules of deer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, following the deer wandering through mountain glades, (as the) deer coarse of nature, with flashing eyes [shen shih], regard (or see) the prince with fixed gaze; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 502</FONT></span></p>  
<p>So following the deer, those Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins intently gaze likewise, looking at the exceeding glory of the Ikshv&acirc;ku. As the glory of the rising sun <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 503</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Is able to affect the herds of milch kine, so as to increase the quantity of their sweet-scented milk, so those Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins, with wondrous joy, thus spoke .one to the other: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 504</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Surely this is one of the eight Vasu Devas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;' others, 'this is one of the two A<I>s</I>vins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;' others, 'this is M&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>;' others, 'this is one of the&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Brahmak&acirc;yikas;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 505</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Others, 'this is S&ucirc;ryadeva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> or <I>K</I>andradeva, coming down; are they not seeking here a sacrifice which is their due? Come let us haste to offer our religious services!' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 506</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince, on his part, with respectful mien addressed to them polite salutation. Then Bodhisattva, looking with care in every direction on the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins occupying the wood, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 507</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Each engaged in his religious duties, all desirous of the delights of heaven, addressed the senior Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, and asked him as to the path of true religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 508</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Now having but just come here, I do not yet know the rules of your religious life. I ask you therefore for information, and I pray explain to me what I ask.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 509</FONT></span></p>  
<p>On this that twice-born (Brahman) in reply explained in succession all the modes of painful discipline, and the fruits expected as their result. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 510</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(How some ate) nothing brought from inhabited places (villages)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (but) that produced from pure water, (others) edible roots and tender twigs, (others) fruits and flowers fit for food, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 511</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Each according to the rules of his sect, clothing and food in each case different, some living amongst bird-kind, and like them capturing and eating food; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 512</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Others eating as the deer the grass (and herbs); others living like serpents, inhaling air; others eating nothing pounded in wood or stone; some eating with two teeth, till a wound be formed; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 513</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Others, again, begging their food and giving it in charity, taking only the remnants for themselves; others, again, who let water continually drip on their heads and those who offer up with fire; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 514</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Others who practise water-dwelling like fish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; thus there are (he said) Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins of every sort, who practise austerities, that they may at the end of life obtain a birth in heaven, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 515</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And by their present sufferings afterwards obtain peaceable fruit. The lord of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the excellent master, hearing all their modes of sorrow-producing penance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 516</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Not perceiving any element of truth in them, experienced no joyful emotion in his heart; lost in thought, he regarded the men with pity, and with his heart in agreement his mouth thus spake: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 517</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Pitiful indeed are such sufferings! and merely n quest of a human or heavenly reward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, ever revolving in the cycle of birth or death, how great your sufferings, how small the recompence! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 518</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Leaving your friends, giving up honourable position; with a firm purpose to obtain the joys of heaven, although you may escape little sorrows, yet in the end involved in great sorrow; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 519</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Promoting the destruction of your outward form, and undergoing every kind of painful penance, and yet seeking to obtain another birth; increasing and prolonging the causes of the five desires, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 520</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Not considering that herefrom (result repeated) birth and death, undergoing suffering and, by that, seeking further suffering; thus it is that the world of men, though dreading the approach of death, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 521</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Yet strive after renewed birth; and being thus born, they must die again. Altho&#8217; still dreading (the power of) suffering, yet prolonging their stay in the sea of pain: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 522</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Disliking from their heart their present kind of life, yet still striving incessantly after other life; enduring affliction that they may partake of joy; seeking a birth in heaven, to suffer further trouble; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 523</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Seeking joys, whilst the heart sinks with feebleness. For this is so with those who oppose right reason; they cannot but be cramped and poor at heart. But by earnestness and diligence, then we conquer. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 524</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Walking in the path of true wisdom, letting go both extremes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, we then reach ultimate perfection; to mortify the body, (if) this is religion,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> then to enjoy rest, is something not resulting from religion. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 525</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To walk religiously and afterwards to receive happiness, this is to make the fruit of religion something different from religion; but bodily exercise is but the cause of death, strength results alone from the mind's intention; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 526</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'If you remove (from conduct) the purpose of the mind, the bodily act is but as rotten wood; wherefore, regulate the mind, and then the body will spontaneously go right. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 527</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'(You say that) to eat pure things is a cause of religious merit, but the wild beasts and the children of poverty ever feed on these fruits and medicinal herbs; these then ought to gain much religious merit. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 528</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But if you say that the heart being good then bodily suffering is the cause of further merit, (then I ask) why may not those who walk (live) in ease, also possess a virtuous heart? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 529</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If joys are opposed to a virtuous heart, a virtuous heart may also be opposed to bodily suffering; if, for instance, all those heretics profess purity because they use water (in various ways), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 530</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Then those who thus use water among men, even with a wicked mind (karma), yet ought ever to be pure. But if righteousness is the groundwork of a <I>Ri</I>shi's purity, then the idea of a sacred spot as his dwelling, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 531</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Being the cause of his righteousness (is wrong). What is reverenced, should be known and seen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Reverence indeed is due to righteous conduct, but let it not redound to the place (or, mode of life).' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 532</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus speaking at large on religious questions, they went on till the setting sun. He then beheld their rites in connection with sacrifice to fire, the drilling (for sparks) and the fanning into flame, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 533</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Also the sprinkling of the butter libations, also the chanting of the mystic prayers, till the sun went down. The prince considering these acts, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 534</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Could not perceive the right reason of them, and was now desirous to turn and go. Then all those Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins came together to him to request him to stay; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 535</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Regarding with reverence the dignity of Bodhisattva, very desirous, they earnestly besought him: 'You have come from an irreligious place, to this wood where true religion flourishes, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 536</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And yet, now, you wish to go away; we beg you, then, on this account, to stay.' All the old Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins, with their twisted hair and bark clothes, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 537</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Came following after Bodhisattva, asking him as a god&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to stay a little while. Bodhisattva seeing these aged ones following him, their bodies worn with macerations, 538.</p>  
<p>Stood still and rested beneath a tree; and soothing them, urged them to return. Then all the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins, young and old, surrounding him, made their request with joined hands: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 539</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You who have so unexpectedly arrived here, amid these garden glades so full&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of attraction, why now are you leaving them and going away, to seek perfection in the wilderness? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 540</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'As a man loving (long) life, is unwilling to let go his body, so we are even thus; would that you would stop awhile. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 541</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'This is a spot where Brahmans and <I>Ri</I>shis have ever dwelt, royal <I>Ri</I>shis and heavenly <I>Ri</I>shis, these all have dwelt within these woods. The places on the borders of the snowy mountains, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 542</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Where men of high birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> undergo their penance, those places are not to be compared to this. All the body of learned masters from this place have reached heaven; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 543</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'All the learned <I>Ri</I>shis who have sought religious merit, have from this place and northwards (found it), those who have attained a knowledge of the true law, and gained divine wisdom come not from southwards; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 544</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'If you indeed see us remiss and not earnest enough, practising rules not pure, and on that account are not pleased to stay, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 545</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Then we are the ones that ought to go; you can still remain and dwell here, all these different Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins ever desire to find companions in their penances. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 546</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And you, because you are conspicuous for your religious earnestness, should not so quickly cast away their society: if you can remain here, they will honour you as god <I>S</I>akra, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 547</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Yea! as the Devas pay worship to B<I>ri</I>haspati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (or, Virudhakapati).' Then Bodhisattva answered the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins and told them what his desires were: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 548</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I am seeking for a true method of escape, I desire solely to destroy all mundane influences; but you, with strong hearts, practise your rules as ascetics, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 549</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'And pay respectful attention to such visitors as may come. My heart indeed is moved with affection towards you, for pleasant conversation is agreeable to all, those who listen are affected thereby; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 550</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And so hearing your words, my mind is strengthened in religious feeling; you indeed have all paid me much respect, in agreement with the courtesy of your religious profession; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 551</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But now I am constrained to depart, my heart grieves thereat exceedingly, first of all, having left my own kindred, and now about to be separated from you. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 552</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The pain of separation from associates, this pain is as great as the other, it is impossible for my mind not to grieve, as it is not to see others' faults&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 553</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But you, by suffering pain, desire earnestly to obtain the joys of birth in heaven; whilst I desire to escape from the three worlds, and therefore I give up what my reason (mind) tells me must be ejected&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 554</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The law which you practise, you inherit from the deeds of former teachers, but I, desiring to destroy all combination (accumulation), seek a law which admits of no such accident. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 555</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'And therefore I cannot in this grove delay for a longer while in fruitless discussions.' At this time all the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins, hearing the words spoken by Bodhisattva, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 556</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Words full of right reason and truth, very excellent in the distinction of principles, their hearts rejoiced and exulted greatly, and deep feelings of reverence were excited within them. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 557</FONT></span></p>  
<p>At this time there was one Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, who always slept in the dust, with tangled hair and raiment of the bark of trees, his eyes bleared (yellow), preparing himself in an ascetic practice (called) 'high-nose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 558</FONT></span></p>  
<p>This one addressed Bodhisattva in the following words: 'Strong in will! bright in wisdom! firmly fixed in resolve to escape (pass beyond) the limits of birth, knowing that in escape from birth there alone is rest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 559</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Not affected by any desire after heavenly blessedness, the mind set upon, the eternal destruction of the body (bodily form), you are indeed miraculous in appearance, (as you are) alone in the possession of such a mind. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 560</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To sacrifice to the gods, and to practise every kind of austerity, all this is designed to secure a birth in heaven, but here there is no mortification of selfish desire, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 561</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'There is still a selfish personal aim; but to bend the will to seek final escape, this is indeed the work of a true teacher, this is the aim of an enlightened master; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 562</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This place is no right halting-place for you, you ought to proceed to Mount Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a (P&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ava), there dwells a great Muni, whose name is A-lo-lam (Ar&acirc;<I>d</I>a R&acirc;ma). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 563</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'He only has reached the end (of religious aims), the most excellent eye (of the law). Go therefore</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to the place where he dwells, and listen there to the true exposition of the law. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 564</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'This will make your heart rejoice, as you learn to follow the precepts of his system. As for me, beholding the joy of your resolve, and fearing that I shall not obtain rest, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 565</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I must once more let go (dismiss) those following me, and seek other disciples; straighten my head (nose) and gaze with my full eyes; anoint my lips and cleanse my teeth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 566</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Cover my shoulders and make bright my face, smooth my tongue and make it pliable. Thus, O excellently marked, sir! fully drinking (at the fountain of) the water you give (glorious water)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 567</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I shall escape from the unfathomable depths. In the world nought is comparable to this, that which old men and <I>Ri</I>shis have not known, that shall (I)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> know and obtain: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 568</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Bodhisattva having listened to these words, left the company of the <I>Ri</I>shis, whilst they all, turning round him to the right, returned to their place. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 569</FONT></span></p>
