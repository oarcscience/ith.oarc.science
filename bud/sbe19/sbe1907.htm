<p>And so the king increased the means for gratifying the appetite for pleasure; both night and day the joys of music wore out the prince, opposed to pleasure; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 323</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Disgusted with them, he desired their absence, his mind was weaned from all such thoughts, he only thought of age, disease, and death; as the lion wounded by an arrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 324</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The king then sent his chief ministers, and the most distinguished of his family, young in years and eminent for beauty, as well as for wisdom and dignity of manners, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 325</FONT></span></p>  
<p>To accompany, and rest with him, both night and day, in order to influence the prince's mind. And now within a little interval, the prince again requested the king that he might go abroad. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 326</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Once more the chariot and the well-paced horses were prepared, adorned with precious substances and every gem; and then with all the nobles, his associates, surrounding him, he left the city gates: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 327</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Just as the four kinds of flower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, when the sun shines, open out their leaves, so was the prince in all his spiritual splendour; effulgent in the beauty of his youth time; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 328</FONT></span></p>  
<p>As he proceeded to the gardens from the city, the road was well prepared, smooth, and wide, the trees were bright with flowers and fruit, his heart was joyous, and forgetful of its care. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 329</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now by the roadside as he beheld the ploughmen, plodding along the furrows, and the writhing worms, his heart again was moved with piteous feeling, and anguish pierced his soul afresh; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 330</FONT></span></p>  
<p>To see those labourers at their toil, struggling with painful work, their bodies bent, their hair dishevelled, the dripping sweat upon their faces, their persons fouled with mud and dust; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 331</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The ploughing oxen, too, bent by the yokes, their lolling tongues and gaping mouths; the nature of the prince, loving, compassionate, his mind conceived most poignant sorrow, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 332</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And nobly moved to sympathy, he groaned with pain; then stooping down he sat upon the ground, and watched this painful scene of suffering; reflecting on the ways of birth and death! <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 333</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Alas! he cried, for all the world! how dark and ignorant, void of understanding!' And then to give his followers chance of rest, he bade them each repose where&#8217;er they list; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 334</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Whilst he beneath the shadow of a <I>G</I>ambu tree, gracefully seated, gave himself to thought. He pondered on the fact of life and death, inconstancy, and endless progress to decay. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 335</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His heart thus fixed without confusion, the five desires (senses) covered and clouded over, lost in possession of enlightenment and insight, he entered on the first pure state of ecstacy. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 336</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All low desire removed, most perfect peace ensued; and fully now in Sam&acirc;dhi (he saw) the misery and utter sorrow of the world; the ruin wrought by age; disease, and death; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 337</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The great misery following on the body's death and yet men not awakened to the truth! oppressed</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with others' suffering (age, disease, and death), this load of sorrow weigh&#8217;d his mind; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 338</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'I now will seek (he said) a noble law, unlike the worldly methods known to men, I will oppose disease and age and death, and strive against the mischief wrought by these on men.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 339</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus lost in tranquil contemplation, (he considered that) youth, vigour, and strength of life, constantly renewing themselves, without long stay, in the end fulfil the rule of ultimate destruction; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 340</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(Thus he pondered) without excessive joy or grief, without hesitation or confusion of thought, without dreaminess or extreme longing, without aversion or discontent, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 341</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But perfectly at peace, with no hindrance, radiant with the beams of increased illumination. At this time a Deva of the Pure abode, transforming himself into the shape of a Bhikshu, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 342</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Came to the place where the prince was seated; the prince with due consideration rose to meet him, and asked him who he was. In reply he said, 'I am a Sh&acirc;man, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 343</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Depressed and sad at thought of age, disease, and death, I have left my home to seek some way of rescue, but everywhere I find old age, disease, and death, all (things) hasten to decay and there is no permanency; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 344</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Therefore I search for the happiness of something that decays not, that never perishes, that never knows beginning, that looks with equal mind on enemy and friend, that heeds not wealth nor beauty, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 345</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The happiness of one who finds repose alone in</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></p>  
<p>solitude, in some unfrequented dell, free from molestation, all thoughts about the world destroyed, dwelling in some lonely hermitage, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 346</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Untouched by any worldly source of pollution, begging for food sufficient for the body.' And forthwith as he stood before the prince, gradually rising up he disappeared in space. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 347</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince with joyful mind, considering, recollected former Buddhas, established thus in perfect dignity of manner; with noble mien and presence, as this visitor. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 348</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus calling things to mind with perfect self-possession, he reached the thought of righteousness, and by what means it can be gained. Indulging thus for length of time in thoughts of religious solitude, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 349</FONT></span></p>  
<p>He now suppressed his feelings and controlled his members, and rising turned again towards the city. His followers all flocked after him, calling him to stop and not go far from them, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 350</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But in his mind these secret thoughts so held him, devising means by which to escape from the world, that tho&#8217; his body moved along the road, his heart was far away among the mountains; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 351</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as the bound and captive elephant, ever thinks about his desert wilds. The prince now entering the city, there met him men and women, earnest for their several ends; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 352</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The old besought him for their children, the young sought something for the wife, others sought something for their brethren; all those allied by kinship or by family, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 353</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Aimed to obtain their several suits, all of them joined in relationship dreading the pain (expectation)</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of separation. And now the prince's heart was filled with joy, as he suddenly heard those words 'separation and association.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 354</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'These are joyful sounds to me,' he said, 'they assure me that my vow shall be accomplished.' Then deeply pondering the joy of 'snapped relationship,' the idea of Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, deepened and widened in him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 355</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His body as a peak of the Golden Mount, his shoulder like the elephant's, his voice like the spring-thunder, his deep-blue eye like that of the king of oxen, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 356</FONT></span></p>  
<p>His mind full of religious thoughts (aims), his face bright as the full moon, his step like that of the lion king, thus he entered his palace, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 357</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as the son of Lord <I>S</I>akra (or, <I>S</I>akra-putra) his mind reverential, his person dignified, he went straight to his father's presence, and with head inclined, enquired, 'Is the king well?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 358</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then he explained his dread of age, disease, and death, and sought respectfully permission to become a hermit. 'For all things in the world' (he said), 'though now united, tend to separation;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 359</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Therefore he prayed to leave the world; desiring to find 'true deliverance.' His royal father hearing the words 'leave the world,' was forthwith seized with great heart-trembling, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 360</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as the strong wild elephant shakes with his weight the boughs of some young sapling; going forward, seizing the prince's hands, with falling tears, he spake as follows: <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 361</FONT></span></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Stop! nor speak such words, the time is not yet come for "a religious life," you are young and strong, your heart beats full, to lead a religious life frequently involves trouble, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 362</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'It is rarely possible to hold the desires in check, the heart not yet estranged from their enjoyment; to leave your home and lead a painful ascetic life, your heart can hardly yet resolve on such a course; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 363</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To dwell amidst the desert wilds or lonely dells, this heart of yours would not be perfectly at rest, for though you love religious matters, you are not yet like me in years; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 364</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You should undertake the kingdom's government, and let me first adopt ascetic life; but to give up your father and your sacred duties, this is not to act religiously; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 365</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'You should suppress this thought of "leaving home," and undertake your worldly duties, find your delight in getting an illustrious name, and after this give up your home and family.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 366</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince, with proper reverence and respectful feelings, again besought his royal father; but promised if he could be saved from four calamities, that he would give up the thought of 'leaving home;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 367</FONT></span></p>  
<p>If he would grant him life without end, no disease, nor undesirable old age, and no decay of earthly possessions; then he would obey and give up the thought of 'leaving home.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 368</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The royal father then addressed the prince, 'Speak not such words as these, for with respect to these four things, who is there able to prevent them, or say nay to their approach; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 369</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'Asking such things as these (four things), you would provoke men's laughter! But put away this thought of "leaving home," and once more take yourself to pleasure.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 370</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince again besought his father, 'If you may not grant me these four prayers, then let me go I pray, and leave my home. O! place no difficulties in my path; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 371</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Your son is dwelling in a burning house, would you indeed prevent his leaving it! To solve a doubt is only reasonable, who could forbid a man to seek its explanation? <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 372</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'Or if he were forbidden, then by self-destruction he might solve the difficulty, in an unrighteous way: and if he were to do so, who could restrain him after death?' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 373</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The royal father, seeing his son's mind so firmly fixed that it could not be turned, and that it would be waste of strength to bandy further words or arguments, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 374</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Forthwith commanded more attendant women, to provoke still more his mind to pleasure; day and night (he ordered them) to keep the roads and ways, to the end that he might not leave his palace; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 375</FONT></span></p>  
<p>(He moreover ordered) all the ministers of the country to come to the place where dwelt the prince, to quote and illustrate the rules of filial piety, hoping to cause him to obey the wishes of the king. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 376</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince, beholding his royal father bathed with tears and o&#8217;erwhelmed with grief, forthwith returned to his abode, and sat himself in silence to consider; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 377</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>All the women of the palace, coming towards him, waited as they circled him, and gazed in silence on his beauteous form. They gazed upon him not with furtive glance, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 378</FONT></span></p>  
<p>But like the deer in autumn brake looks wistfully at the hunter; around the prince's straight and handsome form, (bright) as the mountain of true gold (Sumeru), <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 379</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The dancing women gathered doubtingly, waiting to hear him bid them sound their music; repressing every feeling of the heart through fear, even as the deer within the brake; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 380</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Now gradually the day began to wane, the prince still sitting in the evening light, his glory streaming forth in splendour, as the sun lights up Mount Sumeru; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 381</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus seated on his jewelled couch, surrounded by the fumes of sandal-wood, the dancing women took their places round; then sounded forth their heavenly (Gandharva) music, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 382</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Even as Vai<I>s</I>aman (Vai<I>s</I>rava<I>n</I>a) produces every kind of rare and heavenly sounds. The thoughts which dwelt within the prince's mind entirely drove from him desire for music, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 383</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And tho&#8217; the sounds filled all the place, they fell upon his ear unnoticed. At this time the Deva of the Pure abode, knowing the prince's time was come, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 384</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The destined time for quitting home, suddenly assumed a form and came to earth, to make the shapes of all the women unattractive, so that they might create disgust, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 385</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And no desire arise from thought of beauty. Their half-clad forms bent in ungainly attitudes,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p>forgetful in their sleep, their bodies crooked or supine, the instruments of music lying scattered in disorder; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 386</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Leaning and facing one another, or with back to back, or like those beings thrown into the abyss, their jewelled necklets bound about like chains, their clothes and undergarments swathed around their persons; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 387</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Grasping their instruments, stretched along the earth, even as those undergoing punishment at the hands of keepers (eunuchs), their garments in confusion, or like the broken kani flower (poppy?); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 388</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Or some with bodies leaning in sleep against the wall, in fashion like a hanging bow or horn, or with their hands holding to the window-frames, and looking like an outstretched corpse; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 389</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their mouths half opened or else gaping wide, the loathsome dribble trickling forth, their heads uncovered and in wild disorder, like some unreasoning madman's; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 390</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The flower wreaths torn and hanging across their face, or slipping off the face upon the ground; others with body raised as if in fearful dread, just like the lonely desert(?) bird; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 391</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Or others pillowed on their neighbour's lap, their hands and feet entwined together, whilst others smiled or knit their brows in turn, some with eyes closed and open mouth, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 392</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Their bodies lying in wild disorder, stretched here and there, like corpses thrown together. And now the prince seated, in his beauty, looked with thought on all the waiting women; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 393</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Before, they had appeared exceeding lovely, their laughing words, their hearts so light and gay, their</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>forms so plump and young, their looks so bright; but now, how changed! so uninviting and repulsive. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 394</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And such is woman's disposition! how can they, then, be ever dear, or closely trusted; such false appearances! and unreal pretences; they only madden and delude the minds of men. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 395</FONT></span></p>  
<p>And now (he said), 'I have awakened to the truth! Resolved am I to leave such false society.' At this time the Deva of the Pure abode descended and approached, unfastening the doors. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 396</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The prince, too, at this time rose and walked along, amid the prostrate forms of all the women; with difficulty reaching to the inner hall, he called to <I>K</I>andaka, in these words, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 397</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'My mind is now athirst and longing for the draught of the fountain of sweet dew, saddle then my horse, and quickly bring it here. I wish to reach the deathless city; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 398</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'My heart is fixed beyond all change, resolved I am and bound by sacred oath; these women, once so charming and enticing, now behold I altogether loathsome; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 399</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'The gates, which were before fast-barred and locked, now stand free and open! these evidences of something supernatural, point to a climax of my life.' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 400</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Then <I>K</I>andaka stood reflecting inwardly, whether to obey or not the prince's order, without informing his royal father of it, and so incur the heaviest punishment. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 401</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The Devas then gave spiritual strength; and unperceived the horse equipped came round, with even pace; a gallant steed, with all his jewelled trappings for a rider; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 402</FONT></span></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>High-maned, with flowing tail, broad-backed, short-haired and ear&#8217;d, with belly like the deer's, head like the king of parrots, wide forehead, round and claw-shaped nostrils, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 403</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Breath like the dragon's, with breast and shoulders square, true and sufficient marks of his high breed. The royal prince, stroking the horse's neck, and rubbing down his body, said, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 404</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'My royal father ever rode on thee, and found thee brave in fight slid fearless of the foe; now I desire to rely on thee alike! to carry me far off to the stream (ford) of endless life, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 405</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'To fight against and overcome the opposing force of men, the men who associate in search of pleasure, the men who engage in the search after wealth, the crowds who follow and flatter such persons; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 406</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'In opposing sorrow, friendly help is difficult (to find), in seeking religious truth there must be rare enlightenment, let us then be knit together thus as friends; then, at last, there will be rest from sorrow. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 407</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'But now I wish to go abroad, to give deliverance from pain; now then, for your own sake it is, and for the sake of all your kind, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 408</FONT></span></p>  
<p>'That you should exert your strength, with noble pace, without lagging or weariness.' Having thus exhorted him, he bestrode his horse, and grasping the reins, proceeded forth; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 409</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The man like the sun shining forth from his tabernacle (sun-palace streams), the horse like the white floating cloud (the white cloud-pile), exerting himself but without exciting haste, his breath concealed and without snorting; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 410</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Four spirits (Devas) accompanying him, held up</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></p>  
<p>his feet, heedfully concealing (his advance), silently and without noise; the heavy gates fastened and barred (locked), the heavenly spirits of themselves caused to open; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 411</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Reverencing deeply the virtuous (sinless) father, loving deeply the unequalled son, equally affected with love towards all the members of his family (these. Devas took their place). <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 412</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Suppressing his feelings, but not extinguishing his memory, lightly he advanced and proceeded beyond the city, pure and spotless as the lily flowers which spring from the mud; <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 413</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Looking up with earnestness at his father's palace, he announced his purpose--unwitnessed and unwritten--'If I escape not birth, old age, and death, for evermore I pass not thus along;' <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 414</FONT></span></p>  
<p>All the concourse of Devas, the space-filling N&acirc;gas and spirits followed joyfully and exclaimed Well! well! (s&acirc;dhu), in confirmation of the true words (he spoke); <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 415</FONT></span></p>  
<p>The N&acirc;gas and the company of Devas acquired a condition of heart difficult to obtain, and each with his own inherent light led on the way shedding forth their brightness. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 416</FONT></span></p>  
<p>Thus man and horse both strong of heart went onwards, lost to sight, like streaming stars, but ere the eastern quarter flashed with light, they had advanced three yo<I>g</I>anas. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">. 417</FONT></span></p>
