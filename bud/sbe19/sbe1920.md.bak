### VARGA 18. CONVERSION OF <span id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_518) THE 'SUPPORTER OF THE ORPHANS AND DESTITUTE <span id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_519)' (ANÂTHAPI*ND*ADA.md).

At this time there was a great householder <span
id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_520.md) whose name was 'Friend of the Orphan and
Destitute;' he was very rich and of unbounded means, and widely
charitable in helping the poor and needy. <span class="margnote">.
1432</span>

Now this man coming far away from the north, even from the country of
Ko*s*ala <span id="fr_521"></span>[6](#fn_521.md), stopped at the house of
a friend whose name was Sheu-lo <span id="fr_522"></span>[7](#fn_522.md)
(in Râ*g*ag*ri*ha). <span class="margnote">. 1433</span>

Hearing that Buddha was in the world and dwelling

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

in the bamboo grove near at hand, understanding moreover his renown and
illustrious qualities, he set out that very night <span
id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_523.md) for the grove. <span class="margnote">.
1434</span>

Tathâgata, well aware of his character, and that he was prepared to
bring forth purity and faith <span id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_524.md),
according to the case, called him by his true <span
id="fr_525"></span>[3](#fn_525) (name.md), and for his sake addressed him
in words of religion: <span class="margnote">. 1435</span>

'Having rejoiced in the true law <span id="fr_526"></span>[4](#fn_526.md),
and being humbly <span id="fr_527"></span>[5](#fn_527.md) desirous for a
pure and believing heart, thou hast overcome desire for sleep, and art
here to pay me reverence; <span class="margnote">. 1436</span>

'Now then will I for your sake discharge fully the duties of a first
meeting <span id="fr_528"></span>[6](#fn_528.md). In your former births the
root of virtue planted firm in pure and rare expectancy <span
id="fr_529"></span>[7](#fn_529.md), <span class="margnote">. 1437</span>

'Hearing now the name of Buddha, you rejoiced because you are a vessel
fit for righteousness, humble

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

in mind, but large in gracious deeds, abundant in your charity to the
poor and helpless-- 1438

'The name you possess wide spread and famous, (this is) the just reward
(fruit) of former merit. The deeds you now perform are done of charity,
done with the fullest purpose and of single heart. <span
class="margnote">. 1439</span>

'Now, therefore, take from me <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_530.md) the
charity of perfect rest (Nirvâ*n*a), and for this end accept my rules of
purity. My rules <span id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_531.md) are full of
grace, able to rescue from destruction (evil ways of birth), <span
class="margnote">. 1440</span>

'And cause a man to ascend to heaven and share in all its pleasures. But
yet to seek for these (pleasures) is a great evil, for lustful longing
in its increase brings much sorrow. <span class="margnote">. 1441</span>

Practise then the art of "giving up <span
id="fr_532"></span>[3](#fn_532.md)" all search, for "giving up" desire is
the joy of perfect rest (Nirvâ*n*a) <span
id="fr_533"></span>[4](#fn_533.md). Know <span
id="fr_534"></span>[5](#fn_534.md) then! that age, disease,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

and death, these are the great sorrows of the world. <span
class="margnote">. 1442</span>

'Rightly considering the world, we put away birth and old age, disease
and death; (but now) because we see that men at large inherit sorrow
caused by age, disease, and death, <span class="margnote">. 1443</span>

'(We gather that) when born in heaven, the case is also thus; for there
is no continuance there for any, and where there is no continuance there
is sorrow, and having sorrow there is no "true self." <span
class="margnote">. 1444</span>

'And if the state of "no continuance" and of sorrow is opposed to
"self," what room is there for such idea or ground for "self <span
id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_535.md)?" Know then! that "sorrow" is this very
sorrow (viz. of knowledge), and its repetition is "accumulation <span
id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_536.md);" <span class="margnote">. 1445</span>

'Destroy <span id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_537.md) this sorrow and there is
joy, the way <span id="fr_538"></span>[4](#fn_538.md) is in the calm and
quiet place. The restless busy nature of the world, this I declare is at
the root of pain. <span class="margnote">. 1446</span>

'Stop then the end by choking up the source <span
id="fr_539"></span>[5](#fn_539.md).

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Desire not either
life (bhava) or its opposite; the raging fire of birth, old age, and
death burns up the world on every side. <span class="margnote">.
1447</span>

'Seeing the constant toil (unrest) of birth and death we ought to strive
to attain a passive state (no-thought), the final goal of Sammata <span
id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_540.md), the place of immortality <span
id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_541.md) and rest. <span class="margnote">.
1448</span>

'All is empty! neither "self," nor place for "self," but all the world
is like a phantasy; this is the way to regard ourselves, as but a heap
of composite qualities (sa*m*skâra).' <span class="margnote">.
1449</span>

The nobleman hearing the spoken law forthwith attained the first <span
id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_542.md) degree of holiness, he emptied, as it
were, the sea of birth and death, one drop <span
id="fr_543"></span>[4](#fn_543.md) alone remaining. <span
class="margnote">. 1450</span>

By practising, apart from men, the banishment of all desire he soon
attained the one impersonal

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

condition, not <span id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_544.md) as common folk do
now-a-day who speculate upon the mode of true deliverance; <span
class="margnote">. 1451</span>

For he who does not banish sorrow-causing sa*m*skâras does but involve
himself in every kind of question; and though he reaches to the highest
form of being, yet grasps not the one and only truth; <span
class="margnote">. 1452</span>

Erroneous thoughts as to the joy of heaven are still entwined by the
fast cords of lust <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_545.md). The nobleman
attending to the spoken law the cloud of darkness opened before the
shining splendour; <span class="margnote">. 1453</span>

Thus he attained true sight, erroneous views for ever dissipated; even
as the furious winds of autumn sway to and fro and scatter all the
heaped-up clouds. <span class="margnote">. 1454</span>

He argued <span id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_546.md) not that Î*s*vara was
cause, nor did he advocate some cause heretical, nor yet again did he
affirm there was no cause for the beginning of the world. <span
class="margnote">. 1455</span>

'If the world was made by Î*s*vara deva <span
id="fr_547"></span>[4](#fn_547.md), there should be neither young nor old,
first nor after, nor the five ways of birth (transmigration); and when
once born there should be no destruction. <span class="margnote">.
1456</span>

'Nor should there be such thing as sorrow or calamity, nor doing wrong
nor doing right; for all,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

both pure and impure deeds, these must come from Î*s*vara deva. <span
class="margnote">. 1457</span>

'Again, if Î*s*vara deva made the world there should be never question
(doubt) about the fact, even as a son born of his father ever confesses
him and pays him reverence. <span class="margnote">. 1458</span>

'Men when pressed by sore calamity ought not (if Î*s*vara be creator) to
rebel against him, but rather reverence him completely, as the
self-existent. Nor ought they to adore more gods than one (other
spirits). <span class="margnote">. 1459</span>

'Again, if Î*s*vara be the maker he should not be called the
self-existent <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_548.md), because in that he
is the maker now he always, should have been the maker (ever making).
<span class="margnote">. 1460</span>

'But if ever making, then ever self-remembering  <span
id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_549.md), and therefore not the self-existent
one. And if he made without a mind (purpose) then is he like the sucking
child; <span class="margnote">. 1461</span>

'But if he made having an (ever prompting) purpose, then is he not, with
such a purpose, self-existent. Sorrow and joy spring up in all that
lives, these at least are not the works of Î*s*vara; <span
class="margnote">. 1462</span>

'For if he causes grief <span id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_550.md) and joy,
he must himself

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

have love (preference) and hate; but if he loves unduly, or has hatred,
he cannot properly be named the self-existent. <span class="margnote">.
1463</span>

'Again, if Î*s*vara be the maker, all living things should silently
submit, patient beneath the maker's power, and then what use to practise
virtue? <span class="margnote">. 1464</span>

'’Twere equal, then, the doing right or wrong, there should be no reward
of works; the works themselves being his making, then all things are the
same with him, the maker. <span class="margnote">. 1465</span>

'But if all things are one with him, then our deeds, and we who do them,
are also self-existent. But if Î*s*vara be uncreated, then all things
(being one with him) are uncreated. <span class="margnote">. 1466</span>

'But if you say there is another cause beside him as creator, then
Î*s*vara is not the "end of all" (Î*s*vara, who ought to be
inexhaustible, is not so), and therefore all that lives may after all be
uncreated (without a maker). <span class="margnote">. 1467</span>

'Thus, you see, the thought of Î*s*vara is overthrown in this discussion
(*s*âstra); and all such contradictory assertions should be exposed; if
not, the blame is ours <span id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_551.md). <span
class="margnote">. 1468</span>

'Again, if it be said self-nature <span id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_552.md)
is the maker, this

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

is as faulty as the first assertion; nor has either of the
Hetuvidyâ <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) *s*âstras asserted such
a thing as this, till now. <span class="margnote">. 1469</span>

'That which depends on nothing cannot as a cause make that which is; but
all things round us come from a cause, as the plant comes from the seed;
<span class="margnote">. 1470</span>

'We cannot therefore say that all things are produced by self-nature.
Again, all things which exist (are made) spring not from one (nature) as
a cause; <span class="margnote">. 1471</span>

'And yet you say self-nature is but one, it cannot then be cause of all.
If you say that that self-nature pervades and fills all places, <span
class="margnote">. 1472</span>

'If it pervades and fills all things, then certainly it cannot make them
too; for there would be nothing, then, to make, and therefore this
cannot be the cause. <span class="margnote">. 1473</span>

If, again, it fills all places and yet makes all things that exist, then
it should throughout "all time" have made for ever that which is, <span
class="margnote">. 1474</span>

But if you say it made things thus, then there is nothing to be made "in
time <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_554.md);" know then for certain
self-nature cannot be the cause of all. <span class="margnote">.
1475</span>

Again, they say that that self-nature excludes all

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

gu*n*as <span id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_555) (modifications.md), therefore
all things made by it ought likewise to be free from gu*n*as. <span
class="margnote">. 1476</span>

'But we see, in fact, that all things in the world are fettered
throughout by gu*n*as, therefore, again, we say that self-nature cannot
be the cause of all. <span class="margnote">. 1477</span>

'If, again, you say that that self-nature is different from such
qualities (gu*n*as), (we answer), since self-nature must have ever
caused, it cannot differ in its nature (from itself); <span
class="margnote">. 1478</span>

'But if the world (all living things) be different from these qualities
(gu*n*as), then self-nature cannot be the cause. Again, if self-nature
be unchangeable, so things should also be without decay; <span
class="margnote">. 1479</span>

'If we regard self-nature as the cause, then cause and consequence of
reason should be one; but because we see decay in all things, we know
that they at least are caused. <span class="margnote">. 1480</span>

'Again, if self-nature be the cause, why should we seek to find
"escape?" for we ourselves possess this nature; patient then should we
endure both birth and death. <span class="margnote">. 1481</span>

'For let us take the case that one may find "escape," self-nature still
will re-construct the evil of birth. If self-nature in itself be blind,
yet ’tis the maker of the world that sees. <span class="margnote">.
1482</span>

'On this account again it cannot be the maker, because, in this case,
cause and effect would differ in their character, but-in all the world
around us, cause and effect go hand in hand. <span class="margnote">.
1483</span>

'Again, if self-nature have no purpose <span
id="fr_556"></span>[2](#fn_556) (aim.md), it

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

cannot cause that which has such purpose. We know on seeing smoke there
must be fire, and cause and result are ever classed together thus. <span
class="margnote">. 1484</span>

'We are forbidden, then, to say an unthinking cause can make a thing
that has intelligence. The gold of which the cup is made is gold
throughout from first to last. <span class="margnote">. 1485</span>

'Self-nature then that makes these things from first to last must
permeate all it makes. Once more, if "time" is maker of the world,
’twere needless then to seek "escape," <span class="margnote">.
1486</span>

'For "time" is constant and unchangeable, let us in patience bear the
"intervals" of time. The world in its successions has no limits, the
"intervals" of time are boundless also. <span class="margnote">.
1487</span>

'Those then who practise a religious life need not rely on "methods" or
"expedients." The To-lo-piu Kiu-na <span id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_557.md)
(Tripuna gu*n*a *s*âstra?), the one strange *S*âstra in the world, <span
class="margnote">. 1488</span>

'Although it has so many theories (utterings), yet still, be it known,
it is opposed to any single cause. But if, again, you say that
"self <span id="fr_558"></span>[2](#fn_558.md)" is maker, then surely self
should make things pleasingly, <span class="margnote">. 1489</span>

'But now things are not pleasing for oneself, how then is it said that
self is maker? But if he did not wish to make things so, then he who
wishes for things pleasing, is opposed to self, the maker. <span
class="margnote">. 1490</span>

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

'Sorrow and, joy are not self-existing, how can these be made by "self?"
But if we allow. that self was maker, there should not be, at least, an
evil karman <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_559.md); <span
class="margnote">. 1491</span>

'But yet our deeds produce results both good and evil, know then that
"self" cannot be maker. But perhaps you say "self" is the maker
according to occasion <span id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_560) (time.md), and
then the occasion ought to be for good alone; <span class="margnote">.
1492</span>

'But as good and evil both result from "cause," it cannot be that "self"
has made it so. But if you adopt the argument--there is no maker--then
it is useless practising expedients  <span
id="fr_561"></span>[3](#fn_561.md); <span class="margnote">. 1493</span>

'All things are fixed and certain of themselves, what good to try to
make them otherwise? Deeds of every kind, done in the world, do,
notwithstanding, bring forth every kind of fruit; <span
class="margnote">. 1494</span>

'Therefore we argue all things that exist are not without some cause or
other. There is both "mind" and "want of mind," all things come from
fixed causation; <span class="margnote">. 1495</span>

'The world and all therein is not the result of "nothing" as a cause.'
The nobleman <span id="fr_562"></span>[4](#fn_562) (householder.md), his
heart receiving light, perceived throughout the most excellent system of
truth, <span class="margnote">. 1496</span>

Simple, and of wisdom born; thus firmly settled

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

in the true doctrine he lowly bent in worship at the feet of Buddha and
with closed hands made his request: <span class="margnote">. 1497</span>

'I dwell indeed at *S*râvastî (Sâvatthi) <span
id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_563.md), a land rich in produce, and enjoying
peace; Prasena*g*it (Pasenit) <span id="fr_564"></span>[2](#fn_564.md) is
the great king thereof, the offspring of the "lion" family; <span
class="margnote">. 1498</span>

'His high renown and fame spread everywhere, reverenced by all both far
and near. Now am I wishful there to found a Vihâra, I pray you of your
tenderness accept it from me. <span class="margnote">. 1499</span>

'I know the heart of Buddha has no preferences, nor does he seek a
resting-place from labour, but on behalf of all that lives refuse not my
request.' <span class="margnote">. 1500</span>

Buddha, knowing the householder's heart, that his great charity was now
the moving cause, untainted and unselfish charity, nobly considerate of
the heart of all that lives <span class="margnote">. 1501</span>

(He said), 'Now you have seen the true doctrine, your guileless heart
loves to exercise its charity, for wealth and money are inconstant
treasures, ’twere better quickly to bestow such things on others. <span
class="margnote">. 1502</span>

'For when a treasury has been burnt, whatever precious things may have
escaped the fire, the wise

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

man, knowing their inconstancy, gives freely, doing acts of kindness
with his saved possessions. <span class="margnote">. 1503</span>

'But the niggard guards them carefully, fearing to lose them, worn by
anxiety, but never fearing (worst of all!) "inconstancy <span
id="fr_565"></span>[1](#fn_565.md)," and that accumulated sorrow, when he
loses all! <span class="margnote">. 1504</span>

'There is a proper time and a proper mode in charity, just as the
vigorous warrior goes to battle, so is the man "able to give," he also
is an able warrior; a champion strong and wise in action. <span
class="margnote">. 1505</span>

'The charitable man is loved by all, well-known and far-renowned! his
friendship prized by the gentle and the good, in death his heart at rest
and full of joy! <span class="margnote">. 1506</span>

'He suffers no repentance, no tormenting fear, nor is he born a wretched
ghost or demon! this is the opening flower of his reward, the fruit that
follows--hard to conjecture <span id="fr_566"></span>[2](#fn_566.md)! <span
class="margnote">. 1507</span>

'In all the six conditions born there is no sweet companion like pure
charity; if born a Deva or a man, then charity brings worship and renown
on every hand; <span class="margnote">. 1508</span>

'If born among the lower creatures (beasts), the result of charity will
follow in contentment got; wisdom leads the way to fixed composure
without dependence and without number <span
id="fr_567"></span>[3](#fn_567.md). <span class="margnote">. 1509</span>

'And if we even reach the immortal path, still by continuous acts of
charity we fulfil ourselves in

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

consequence of kindly charity done elsewhere. Training ourselves in the
eightfold <span id="fr_568"></span>[1](#fn_568.md) path of recollection,
<span class="margnote">. 1510</span>

'In every thought the heart is filled with joy, firm fixed in holy
contemplation (samâdhi), by meditation still we add to wisdom, able to
see aright (the cause of) birth and death; <span class="margnote">.
1511</span>

'Having beheld aright the cause of these, then follows in due order
perfect deliverance. The charitable man discarding earthly wealth, nobly
excludes the power of covetous desire; <span class="margnote">.
1512</span>

'Loving and compassionate now, he gives with reverence and banishes all
hatred, envy, anger. So plainly may we see the fruit of charity, putting
away all covetous and unbelieving ways, <span class="margnote">.
1513</span>

'The bands of sorrow all destroyed, this is the fruit of kindly charity.
Know then! the charitable man has found the cause of final rescue; <span
class="margnote">. 1514</span>

'Even as the man who plants the sapling, thereby secures the shade, the
flowers, the fruit (of the tree full grown); the result of charity is
even so, its reward is joy and, the great Nirvâ*n*a. <span
class="margnote">. 1515</span>

'The charity which unstores <span id="fr_569"></span>[2](#fn_569.md) wealth
leads to returns of well-stored fruit. Giving away our food we get more
strength, giving away our clothes we get more beauty, <span
class="margnote">. 1516</span>

'Founding religious rest-places <span id="fr_570"></span>[3](#fn_570.md)
(pure abodes) we

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

reap the perfect fruit of the best charity. There is a way of giving,
seeking pleasure by it; there is a way of giving, coveting to get more;
<span class="margnote">. 1517</span>

'Some also give away to get a name for charity, others to get the
happiness of heaven, others to avoid the pain of being poor (hereafter),
but yours, O friend! is a charity without such thoughts, <span
class="margnote">. 1518</span>

'The highest and the best degree of charity without self-interest or
thought of getting more. What your heart inclines you now to do, let it
be quickly done and well completed! <span class="margnote">. 1519</span>

'The uncertain and the lustful heart goes wandering here and there, but
the pure eyes (of virtue) Opening, the heart comes back and rests <span
id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_571.md)!' The nobleman accepting Buddha's
teaching, his kindly heart receiving yet more light, <span
class="margnote">. 1520</span>

He invited Upatishya <span id="fr_572"></span>[2](#fn_572.md), his
excellent friend, to accompany him on his return to Ko*s*ala; and then
going round to select a pleasant site, <span class="margnote">.
1521</span>

He saw the garden of the heir-apparent, *G*eta, the groves and limpid
streams most pure. Proceeding where the prince was dwelling, he asked
for leave to buy the ground; <span class="margnote">. 1522</span>

The prince, because he valued it so much, at first was not inclined to
sell, but said at last: 'If you can cover it with gold then, but not
else, you may possess it <span id="fr_573"></span>[3](#fn_573.md).' <span
class="margnote">. 1523</span>

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

The nobleman, his heart rejoicing, forthwith began to spread his gold.
Then *G*eta said: 'I will not give, why then spread you your gold?'
<span class="margnote">. 1524</span>

The nobleman replied, 'Not give; why then said you, "Fill it with yellow
gold?"' And thus they differed and contended both, till they resorted to
the magistrate. <span class="margnote">. 1525</span>

Meanwhile the people whispered much about his unwonted <span
id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_574) (charity.md), and *G*eta too, knowing the
man's sincerity, asked more about the matter: what his reasons were. On
his reply, 'I wish to found a Vihâra, <span class="margnote">.
1526</span>

'And offer it to the Tathâgata and all his Bhikshu followers,' the
prince, hearing the name of Buddha, received at once illumination, <span
class="margnote">. 1527</span>

And only took one half the gold, desiring to share in the foundation:
'Yours is the land (he said), but mine the trees; these will I give to
Buddha as my share in the offering.' <span class="margnote">.
1528</span>

Then the noble took the land, *G*eta the trees, and settled both in
trust on *S*âriputra. Then they began to build the hall, labouring night
and day to finish it; <span class="margnote">. 1529</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_518"></span>[201:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_518.md) Literally, 'he
converts,' &c.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[201:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_519.md) This is the Chinese
explanation of the name of Anâthapi*nd*ada (or Anâthapi*nd*ika), 'the
protector or supporter of the destitute.' He is otherwise called Sudatta
(see Jul. II, 294).

<span id="fn_520"></span>[201:5](sbe1920.htm#fr_520.md) The Chinese is
simply 'ta *k*ang *k*é,' but this is evidently the equivalent of
'Mahâ-se*tth*i,' a term applied emphatically to Anâthapi*nd*ada (see
Rhys Davids, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiii, p. 202, note 2). Where
I have translated it 'nobleman,' the word 'treasurer' might be
substituted; the term 'elder' cannot be allowed. Yasa the son of a
se*tth*i is called by Rh. D. a 'noble youth' (op. cit., p. 102, § 7).

<span id="fn_521"></span>[201:6](sbe1920.htm#fr_521.md) That is, Uttara
Ko*s*ala (Northern Ko*s*ala), the capital of which was *S*râvastî.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[201:7](sbe1920.htm#fr_522.md) Rhys Davids gives
the name of one of the rich merchant's daughters, *K*ûla-Subhaddâ (Birth
Stories, p. 130; perhaps his friend at Râ*g*ag*ri*ha was called Sûla or
Kûla (see also Manual of Buddhism, p. 219).

<span id="fn_523"></span>[202:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_523.md) The statements that
he came 'by night,' and that Buddha called him by his name--or, as the
Chinese might be translated, called him 'true' (? guileless)--appear as
though borrowed from the Gospel narrative. Nicodemus was rich, and
Nathaniel (Bartholomew) preached in India (Euseb. Lib. v. cap. 10). He
is said to have carried the Gospel of St. Matthew there, where it was
discovered by Pantaenus.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[202:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_524.md) That is, that he
was ripe for conversion.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[202:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_525.md) The name by which
he was called, according to Spence Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, p. 217),
was Sudatta.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[202:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_526.md) That is, 'because'
you have rejoiced. The 'true law' is the same as 'religious truth.'

<span id="fn_527"></span>[202:5](sbe1920.htm#fr_527.md) Literally, 'pure
and truthful of heart, with meekness thirsting (after knowledge).'

<span id="fn_528"></span>[202:6](sbe1920.htm#fr_528.md) The meaning is, as
we have now met for the first time, I will explain my doctrine (preach)
in a formal (polite) way.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[202:7](sbe1920.htm#fr_529.md) That is, your merit
in former births has caused you to reap a reward in your present
condition.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[203:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_530.md) The construction
here is difficult. There seems to be a play on the word 'shi,' religious
charity; the sense is, that as Anâthapi*nd*ada was remarkable for his
liberality now, he should be liberally rewarded by gaining a knowledge
of salvation (Nirvâ*n*a).

<span id="fn_531"></span>[203:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_531.md) Instead of 'my
rules,' it would be better to understand the word in an indefinite sense
as 'rules of morality' (*s*îla).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[203:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_532.md) 'Giving up,' that
is, putting away all desire and giving up 'self,' even in relation to
future reward; compare the hymn of S. Francis Xavier,

'O Deus, ego amo Te  
Nec amo Te ut salves me,' etc.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again,

'Non ut in coelo salves me  
Nec praemii ullius spe.'

<span id="fn_533"></span>[203:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_533.md) This definition of
Nirvâ*n*a, as a condition of perfect rest resulting from 'giving up'
desire, is in agreement with the remarks of Mr. Rhys Davids and others,
who describe Nirvâ*n*a as resulting from the absence of a 'grasping'
disposition.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[203:5](sbe1920.htm#fr_534.md) It would seem, from
the context, that the word '*k*i' (know), in this line, is a mistake for
'sing,' birth.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[204:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_535.md) The argument is,
that there can be no personal self, in other words, no 'soul,' where
there is no continuance, or power of independent existence. This is one
of the principles of Buddhism, viz. that what has had a beginning must
come to an end; the 'soul,' therefore, as it began with the birth of the
individual, must die (and as the Buddhists said) with the individual. If
we put this into modern phraseology, it will be something like this,
'the very nature of phenomena demonstrates that they must have had a
beginning, and that they must have an end' (Huxley, Lay Sermons, p. 17).

<span id="fn_536"></span>[204:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_536.md) The sorrow of
'accumulation' is the second of the 'four truths' (according to Northern
accounts).

<span id="fn_537"></span>[204:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_537.md) 'Destruction' is
the third great truth.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[204:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_538.md) The 'way' is the
fourth truth.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[204:5](sbe1920.htm#fr_539.md) The sentiment here
enunciated is repeated, under various forms, in Dhammapada; the first
paragraph in the Sûtra of Forty-two Sections, also, exhibits the same
truth.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[205:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_540.md) Sammata or Sammati
seems to be the same as Samatha in Pâli (concerning which, see Childers,
Pâli Dict. sub voce). The Chinese expression 'yih sin' (one heart) is
generally equivalent to 'sammata,' ecstatic union. It cannot here be
rendered by samâdhi.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[205:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_541.md) The place of 'sweet
dew' (am*ri*ta).

<span id="fn_542"></span>[205:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_542.md) That is, of a
Srotâpanna. Spence Hardy, in his Manual of Buddhism, p. 218, also says
that Anâthapi*nd*ada entered the first path after hearing the sermon;
but in his account the sermon consisted of two stanzas only, 'He who is
free from evil desire attains the highest estate and is always in
prosperity. He who cuts off demerit, who subdues the mind and attains a
state of perfect equanimity, secures Nirvâ*n*a; this is his prosperity.'
In this account the idea of 'prosperity' is the same as the 'charity of
Nirvâ*n*a' in our version.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[205:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_543.md) This appears to
allude to the circumstance that at the dedication of the Vihâra
Anâthapi*nd*ada arrived at the third degree of holiness, after which
there was but one birth (drop) more to experience before reaching
Nirvâ*n*a (Manual of Buddhism, p. 220).

<span id="fn_544"></span>[206:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_544.md) These lines appear
to be by way of reflection.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[206:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_545.md) 'Lust' in the sense
of 'appetite.'

<span id="fn_546"></span>[206:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_546.md) Here follows a long
dissertation on the subject of the 'maker' of the world. The theories
refuted are (1) that Î*s*vara is maker, (2) that self-nature is the
cause, (3) that time is the maker, (4) that self (in the sense of
'universal self') is the cause, (5) that there is no cause.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[206:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_547.md) Here I begin with
inverted commas, as if the discourse were either spoken by Buddha or
interpolated by A*s*vaghosha.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[207:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_548.md) In the sense of
'existing in himself' or independently. How entirely Northern Buddhism
changed its character shortly after A*s*vaghosha's time, is evident from
the fact that Avalokites.vara, 'the god who looks down' (in the sense of
protector), became an object of almost universal worship, and was
afterwards regarded as the creating god.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[207:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_549.md) That is, ever
'purposing' to make, and so not complete in himself.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[207:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_550.md) 'This question,
"unde malum et quare,"' was the question that of old met the thoughtful
at every turn. And it has always <span id="page_208">p. 208</span> done
so. Many of the arguments used in the text may be found in works
treating on the subject of 'evil' and its origin.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[208:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_551.md) So the passage must
be translated; but if so, it would appear, as before stated, that this
discourse on the 'maker' is introduced here parenthetically by
A*s*vaghosha, not as spoken by Buddha. No doubt the theories and their
confutations were such as prevailed in his day.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[208:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_552.md) By self-nature, or,
original nature, is evidently meant 'svabhâva.' The theory of such a
cause had evidently gained ground at this time in the North, although it
seems unknown amongst <span id="page_209">p. 209</span> Southern
Buddhists. Nâgasena wrote a *S*âstra ('of one *s*loka') to disprove it.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[209:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_553.md) The usual Chinese
expression for 'hetuvidyâ' is 'in ming;' here the phrase is 'ming in;'
but I suppose this to be either an error, or equivalent with the other.
The Hetuvidyâ sâstra is a treatise on the 'explanation of causes.'

<span id="fn_554"></span>[209:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_554.md) The argument seems
to be that self-nature must have made all things from the first as they
are; there is no room therefore for further creation, but things are
still made, therefore self-nature cannot be the cause.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[210:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_555.md) That is, that it is
nirgu*n*a, devoid of qualities.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[210:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_556.md) "No purpose'--no
heart; if we take the two powers of soul <span id="page_211">p.
211</span>(according to the scholastic method) to be a 'vis cognitiva'
and a 'vis effectiva,' the expression in the text appears to correspond
with the latter.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[211:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_557.md) I do not know any
other way of restoring these symbols than the one I have used. But what
is the Tripuna gu*n*a sâstra?

<span id="fn_558"></span>[211:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_558.md) 'Self' in the sense
of a 'universal cause' co-extensive with the things made.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[212:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_559.md) There should not be
works producing birth in one of the evil ways.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[212:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_560.md) I do not understand
the point here; literally the passage is 'saying self according to time
makes'--the Chinese 'ts’ui ski' means 'whenever convenient,' or 'at a
good time;' so that the passage may mean 'but if you say that self
creates only when so prompted by itself.'

<span id="fn_561"></span>[212:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_561.md) That is, using
means for salvation or escape from sorrow.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[212:4](sbe1920.htm#fr_562.md) Here the narrative
seems to take up the thread dropped at v. 1451.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[213:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_563.md) She-po-ti;
evidently a Pâli or Prâkrit form of the Sanskrit *S*râvastî. The Chinese
explanation of this name is (as found in the next line) a 'country of
abundance.' It has been identified by General Cunningham with Sâhet
Mâhet.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[213:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_564.md) Po-sze-nih, i.e.
Prasena*g*it (victorious army). With respect to this king, we know from
Hiouen Thsang (Jul. II, 317) that he did not belong to the *S*âkya race,
but he became a convert to Buddhism. His son Virûdhaka massacred a
number of the *S*âkyas, 'and the ground was covered with their dead
bodies as with pieces of straw' (Jul. II, 317). The king is here
described as belonging to the Si*m*ha race; probably he was a Scyth, of
the same family as the Va*gg*is, one tribe of whom was called the 'lion'
tribe.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[214:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_565.md) 'Inconstancy,' or
'death.'

<span id="fn_566"></span>[214:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_566.md) This is a singular
expression, implying that the character of a good man's final condition
is difficult to describe: 'it has not entered the heart.'

<span id="fn_567"></span>[214:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_567.md) These two lines
appear to be irrelevant; nor do I understand the last phrase 'without
number,' in its connection with the context.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[215:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_568.md) The eight
recollections (nim); doubtless these are the eight 'samâpattis'
(attainments or endowments), concerning which we may consult Childers'
Pâli Dict., sub 'samâpatti.'

<span id="fn_569"></span>[215:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_569.md) That is, which does
not store up wealth, but unstores it to give away. There seems to be
here a tacit allusion to Sudatta's wealth, which he unstored and gave in
charity by purchasing the garden of *G*eta.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[215:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_570.md) That is, Vihâras.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[216:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_571.md) These two lines are
probably proverbial, something of this kind, 'the uncertain, amorous
mind is profligate (wandering), the enlightened man comes to himself.'

<span id="fn_572"></span>[216:2](sbe1920.htm#fr_572.md) Upatissa is the
same as *S*âriputra. Hiouen Thsang (Jul. II, 296) says that Buddha sent
*S*âriputra with Sudatta, to advise and counsel him.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[216:3](sbe1920.htm#fr_573.md) The famous contract
between Sudatta and *G*eta, the heir-apparent, is well known, and may be
read in all the translations of the <span id="page_217">p. 217</span>
lives of Buddha. There is a representation of the proceeding in plate
lvii (Bharhut Stûpa). I may observe here that the figure immediately in
front (by the side of *G*eta, the prince, who is apparently giving away
the trees, whilst Sudatta below him is giving the land), whistling with
thumb and forefinger, and waving the robe, is typical of a number of
others in these sculptures similarly engaged (see e*g*. plate xiii
\[outer face\]).

<span id="fn_574"></span>[217:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_574.md) Or, the unwonted
circumstance; or, the 'unusual' character of Sudatta.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[218:1](sbe1920.htm#fr_575.md) The expression 'to
rest' may also mean 'to observe the rainy season rest,' if the ordinance
of Wass had been enacted at this time.
