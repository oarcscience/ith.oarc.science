### VARGA 19. INTERVIEW BETWEEN FATHER AND SON.

Buddha in the Magadha country (employing himself in) converting all
kinds of unbelievers <span id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_576) (heretics.md),
entirely changed them by the one and self-same <span
id="fr_577"></span>[3](#fn_577.md) law he preached, even as the sun drowns
with its brightness all the stars. <span class="margnote">. 1534</span>

Then leaving the city of the five mountains <span
id="fr_578"></span>[4](#fn_578.md) with the company of his thousand
disciples, and with a

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

great multitude who went before and came after him, he advanced towards
the Ni-kin <span id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_579.md) mountain, <span
class="margnote">. 1535</span>

Near Kapilavastu; and there he conceived in himself a generous purpose
to prepare an offering [according](errata.htm#2.md) to his religious
doctrine <span id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_580.md) to present to his father,
the king. <span class="margnote">. 1536</span>

And now in anticipation of his coming the royal teacher (purohita) and
the chief minister had sent forth certain officers and their attendants
to observe on the right hand and the left (what was taking place); and
they soon espied him (Buddha) as he advanced or halted on the way. <span
class="margnote">. 1537</span>

Knowing that Buddha was now returning to his country they hastened
back <span id="fr_581"></span>[3](#fn_581.md) and quickly announced the
tidings, 'The prince who wandered forth afar to obtain enlightenment,
having fulfilled his aim, is now coming back.' <span class="margnote">.
1538</span>

The king hearing the news was greatly rejoiced, and forthwith went out
with his gaudy equipage to meet (his son); and the whole body of gentry
(sse) belonging to the country, went forth with him in his company.
<span class="margnote">. 1539</span>

Gradually advancing he beheld Buddha from afar, his marks of beauty
sparkling with splendour two-fold

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

greater than of yore; placed in the middle of the great congregation he
seemed to be even as Brahma râ*g*a. <span class="margnote">. 1540</span>

Descending from his chariot and advancing with dignity, (the king) was
anxious lest there should be any religious <span
id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_582.md) difficulty (in the way of instant
recognition); and now beholding his. beauty he inwardly rejoiced, but
his mouth found no words to utter. <span class="margnote">. 1541</span>

He reflected, too, how that he was still dwelling among the unconverted
throng, whilst his son had advanced and become a saint (*Ri*shi); and
although he was his son, yet as he now occupied the position of a
religious lord <span id="fr_583"></span>[2](#fn_583.md), he knew not by
what name to address him. <span class="margnote">. 1542</span>

Furthermore he thought with himself how he had long ago desired
earnestly (this interview), which now had happened unawares <span
id="fr_584"></span>[3](#fn_584) (without arrangement.md). Meantime his son
in silence took a seat, perfectly composed and with unchanged
countenance. <span class="margnote">. 1543</span>

Thus for some time sitting opposite each other, with no expression of
feeling (the king reflected thus) <span id="fr_585"></span>[4](#fn_585.md),
'How desolate and sad does he now make my heart, as that of a man, who,
fainting, longs for water, upon the road espies a fountain pure and
cold; <span class="margnote">. 1544</span>

'With haste he speeds towards it and longs to

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

drink, when suddenly the spring dries up and disappears. Thus, now I see
my son, his well-known features as of old; <span class="margnote">.
1545</span>

'But how estranged his heart! and how his manner high and lifted up!
There are no grateful outflowings of soul, his feelings seem unwilling
to express themselves; cold and vacant (there he sits); and like a
thirsty man before a dried-up fountain (so am I).' <span
class="margnote">. 1546</span>

Still distant thus (they sat), with crowding thoughts rushing through
the mind, their eyes full met, but no responding joy; each looking at
the other, seemed as one who thinking of a distant friend, gazes by
accident upon his pictured form <span id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_586.md).
<span class="margnote">. 1547</span>

'That you' (the king reflected) 'who of right might rule the world, even
as that Mândhât*ri* râ*g*a, should now go begging here and there your
food! what joy or charm has such a life as this? <span
class="margnote">. 1548</span>

'Composed and firm as Sumeru <span id="fr_587"></span>[2](#fn_587.md), with
marks of beauty bright as the sunlight, with dignity of step like the ox
king, fearless as any lion, <span class="margnote">. 1549</span>

'And yet receiving not the tribute of the world, but begging food
sufficient for your body's nourishment!' Buddha, knowing his father's
mind, still kept to his own filial purpose. <span class="margnote">.
1550</span>

And then to open out his <span id="fr_588"></span>[3](#fn_588.md) mind, and
moved with

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

pity for the multitude of people, by his miraculous power he rose in
mid-air, and with his hands (appeared) to grasp the sun and moon <span
id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_589.md) <span class="margnote">. 1551</span>

Then he walked to and fro in space, and underwent all kinds of
transformation, dividing his body into many parts, then joining all in
one again. <span class="margnote">. 1552</span>

Treading firm on water as on dry land, entering the earth as in the
water, passing through walls of stone without impediment, from the right
side and the left water and fire produced <span
id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_590.md)! <span class="margnote">. 1553</span>

The king, his father, filled with joy, now dismissed all thought of son
and father <span id="fr_591"></span>[3](#fn_591.md); then upon a lotus
throne, seated in space, he (Buddha) for his father's sake declared the
law. <span class="margnote">. 1554</span>

'I know that the king's heart (is full of) love and recollection, and
that for his son's sake he adds grief to grief; but now let the bands of
love that bind him, thinking of his son, be instantly unloosed and
utterly destroyed. <span class="margnote">. 1555</span>

'Ceasing from thoughts of love, let your calmed mind receive from me,
your son, religious nourishment; such as no son has offered yet to
father, such do I present to you the king, my father. <span
class="margnote">. 1556</span>

'And what no father yet has from a son received, now from your son you
may accept, a gift miraculous for any mortal king to enjoy, and seldom
had by any heavenly king! <span class="margnote">. 1557</span>

'The way superlative of life immortal <span
id="fr_592"></span>[4](#fn_592.md) (sweet

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

dew) I offer now the Mahârâ*g*a; from accumulated deeds comes birth, and
as the result of deeds comes recompense; <span class="margnote">.
1558</span>

'Knowing then that deeds bring fruit, how diligent should you be to rid
yourself of worldly deeds! how careful that in the world your, deeds
should be only good and gentle! <span class="margnote">. 1559</span>

'Fondly affected by relationship or firmly bound by mutual ties of love,
at end of life the soul (spirit) goes forth alone,--then, only our good
deeds befriend us.-- 1560

Whirled in the five ways of the wheel of life, three kinds of deeds
produce three kinds of birth <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_593.md), and
these are caused by lustful hankering, each kind different in its
character. <span class="margnote">. 1561</span>

'Deprive these of their power by the practice now of (proper) deeds of
body and of word; by such right preparation day and night strive to get
rid of all confusion of the mind and practise silent (contemplation);
<span class="margnote">. 1562</span>

'Only this brings profit in the end, besides this there is no reality;
for be sure! the three worlds are but as the froth and bubble of the
sea. <span class="margnote">. 1563</span>

'Would you have pleasure, or would you practise that which brings it
near? then prepare yourself by

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

deeds that bring the fourth birth <span id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_594.md):
but (still) the five ways in the wheel of birth and death are like the
uncertain wanderings of the stars; <span class="margnote">. 1564</span>

'For heavenly beings too must suffer change: how shall we find with men
(a hope of) constancy; Nirvâ*n*a! that is the chief rest; composure!
that the best of all enjoyments! <span class="margnote">. 1565</span>

'The five indulgences (pleasures) enjoyed by mortal kings are fraught
with danger and distress, like dwelling with a poisonous snake; what
pleasure, for a moment, can there be in such a case? <span
class="margnote">. 1566</span>

'The wise man sees the world as compassed round with burning flames; he
fears always, nor can he rest till he has banished, once for all, birth,
age, and death. <span class="margnote">. 1567</span>

'Infinitely quiet is the place where the wise man finds his abode; no
need of arms (instruments) or weapons there! no elephants or horses,
chariots or soldiers there! <span class="margnote">. 1568</span>

'Subdued the power of covetous desire and angry thoughts and ignorance,
there's nothing left in the wide world to conquer! Knowing what sorrow
is, he cuts away the cause of sorrow; <span class="margnote">.
1569</span>

'This destroyed, by practising right means, rightly enlightened in the
four true principles  <span id="fr_595"></span>[2](#fn_595.md), he casts
off fear and escapes the evil ways of birth.' The king when first he saw
his wondrous spiritual power (of miracle) rejoiced in heart; <span
class="margnote">. 1570</span>

'But now his feelings deeply affected by the joy of (hearing) truth, he
became a perfect vessel for receiving true religion, and with clasped
hands he

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

breathed forth his praise: 'Wonderful indeed! the fruit of your resolve
(oath) <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_596.md) completed thus! <span
class="margnote">. 1571</span>

'Wonderful indeed! the overwhelming sorrow passed away! Wonderful
indeed, this gain to me! At first my sorrowing heart was heavy, but now
my sorrow has brought forth only profit! <span class="margnote">.
1572</span>

'Wonderful indeed! for now, to-day, I reap the full fruit of a begotten
son. It was right he should reject the choice pleasures of a monarch
(conqueror); it was right he should so earnestly and with diligence
practise penance; <span class="margnote">. 1573</span>

'It was right he should cast off his family and kin; it was right he
should cut off every feeling of love and affection. The old *Ri*shi
kings boasting of their penance gained no merit; <span
class="margnote">. 1574</span>

'But you, living in a peaceful, quiet place, have done all and completed
all; yourself at rest now you give rest to others, moved by your mighty
sympathy (compassion) for all that lives! <span class="margnote">.
1575</span>

If you had kept your first estate with men, and as a *K*akravartin
monarch ruled the world, possessing then no self-depending power of
miracle, how could my soul have then received deliverance? <span
class="margnote">. 1576</span>

Then there would have been no excellent law declared, causing me such
joy to-day; no! had you been a universal sovereign, the bonds of birth
and death would still have been unsevered; <span class="margnote">.
1577</span>

'But now you have escaped from birth and death; the great pain of
transmigration overcome, you are able, for the sake of every creature,
widely to preach the law of life immortal (sweet dew), <span
class="margnote">. 1578</span>

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

'And to exhibit thus your power miraculous, and (show) the deep and wide
power of wisdom; the grief of birth and death eternally destroyed, you
now have risen far above both gods and men. <span class="margnote">.
1579</span>

'You might have kept the holy state of a *K*akravartin monarch; but no
such good as this would have resulted.' Thus his words of praise
concluded, filled with increased reverence and religious love, <span
class="margnote">. 1580</span>

He who occupied the honoured place of a royal father, bowed down
respectfully and did obeisance. Then all the people of the kingdom,
beholding Buddha's miraculous power, <span class="margnote">.
1581</span>

And having heard the deep and excellent law, seeing, moreover, the
king's grave reverence, with clasped hands bowed down and worshipped.
Possessed with deep portentous thoughts, <span class="margnote">.
1582</span>

Satiated with sorrows attached to lay-life, they all conceived a wish to
leave their homes <span id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_597.md). The princes,
too, of the *S*âkya tribe, their minds enlightened to perceive the
perfect fruit of righteousness, <span class="margnote">. 1583</span>

Entirely satiated with the glittering joys of the world, forsaking home,
rejoiced to join his company (become hermits). Ânanda, Nanda, Kin-pi
(Kimbila) <span id="fr_598"></span>[2](#fn_598.md), Anuruddha, <span
class="margnote">. 1584</span>

Nandupananda, with *K*u*nd*adana <span id="fr_599"></span>[3](#fn_599.md),
all these principal nobles and others of the *S*âkya family, <span
class="margnote">. 1585</span>

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

From the teaching of Buddha became disciples and accepted the law. The
sons of the great minister of state, Udâyin being the chief, <span
class="margnote">. 1586</span>

With all the royal princes following in order became recluses. Moreover,
the son of Atalî, whose name was Upâli, <span class="margnote">.
1587</span>

Seeing all these princes and the sons of the chief minister becoming
hermits, his mind opening for conversion, he, too, received the law of
renunciation. <span class="margnote">. 1588</span>

The royal father seeing his son possessing the great qualities of
*Ri*ddhi, himself entered on the calm flowings (of thought), the gate of
the true law of eternal life. <span class="margnote">. 1589</span>

Leaving his kingly estate and country, lost in meditation, he drank
sweet dew. Practising (his religious duties) in solitude, silent and
contemplative he dwelt in his palace, a royal *Ri*shi. <span
class="margnote">. 1590</span>

Tathâgata following a peaceable <span id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_600.md)
life, recognised fully by his tribe, repeating the joyful news of
religion, gladdened the hearts of all his kinsmen hearing him. <span
class="margnote">. 1591</span>

And now, it being the right time for begging food, he entered the
Kapila, country (Kapilavastu); in the city all the lords and ladies, in
admiration, raised this chant of praise: <span class="margnote">.
1592</span>

'Siddhârtha! fully enlightened! has come back again!' The news flying
quickly in and out of doors, the great and small came forth to see him;
<span class="margnote">. 1593</span>

Every door and every window crowded, climbing on shoulders <span
id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_601.md), bending down the eyes, they gazed

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

upon the marks of beauty on his person, shining and glorious! <span
class="margnote">. 1594</span>

Wearing his Kashâya garment outside, the glory of his person from within
shone forth, like the sun's perfect wheel; within, without, he seemed
one mass of splendour <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_602.md)1. <span
class="margnote">. 1595</span>

Those who beheld were filled with sympathising <span
id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_603.md) joy; their hands conjoined, they wept
(for gladness) <span id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_604.md); and so they
watched him as he paced with dignity the road, his form collected, all
his organs well-controlled! <span class="margnote">. 1596</span>

His lovely body exhibiting the perfection <span
id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_605.md) of religious beauty, his dignified
compassion adding to their regretful joy! his shaven head, his personal
beauty sacrificed! his body clad in dark and sombre vestment, <span
class="margnote">. 1597</span>

His manner natural and plain, his unadorned appearance; his
circumspection as he looked upon the earth in walking! 'He who ought to
have had held over him the feather-shade' (they said), 'whose hands
should grasp "the [reins](errata.htm#3.md) of the flying <span
id="fr_606"></span>[5](#fn_606.md) dragon," <span class="margnote">.
1598</span>

'See how he walks in daylight on the dusty road! holding his alms-dish,
going to beg! Gifted enough to tread down every enemy, lovely enough to
gladden woman's heart, <span class="margnote">. 1599</span>

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

'With glittering vesture and with godlike crown reverenced he might have
been by servile crowds! But now, his manly beauty hidden, with heart
re-strained, and outward form subdued, <span class="margnote">.
1600</span>

'Rejecting the much-coveted and glorious apparel, his shining body clad
with garments grey, what aim, what object, now! Hating the five delights
that move the world, <span class="margnote">. 1601</span>

Forsaking virtuous wife and tender child, loving the solitude, he
wanders friendless; hard, indeed, for virtuous wife through the long
night <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_607.md), cherishing her grief; <span
class="margnote">. 1602</span>

'And now to hear he is a hermit! She enquires not now (so lost to life)
of the royal Suddhodana if he has seen his son or not! <span
class="margnote">. 1603</span>

'But as she views his beauteous person, (to think) his altered form is
now a hermit's! hating his home, still full of love; his father, too,
what rest for him (they say)! <span class="margnote">. 1604</span>

'And then his loving child Râhula, weeping with constant sorrowful
desire! And now to see no change, or heart-relenting; and this the end
of such enlightenment! <span class="margnote">. 1605</span>

'All these attractive marks, the proofs of a religious calling, whereas,
when born, all said, these are marks of a "great man," who ought to
receive tribute from the four seas! <span class="margnote">. 1606</span>

'And now to see what he has come to! all these predictive words vain and
illusive.' Thus they talked together, the gossiping multitude, with
confused accents. <span class="margnote">. 1607</span>

Tathâgata, his heart unaffected,. felt no joy and

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

no regret. But he was moved by equal love to all the world, his one
desire that men should escape the grief of lust; <span
class="margnote">. 1608</span>

To cause the root of virtue to increase, and for the sake of coming
ages, to leave the marks of self-denial <span
id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_608.md) behind him, to dissipate the clouds and
mists of sensual desire, <span class="margnote">. 1609</span>

He entered, thus intentioned, on the town to beg. He accepted food both
good or had, whatever came, from rich or poor, without distinction;
having filled his alms-dish, he then returned back to the solitude.
<span class="margnote">. 1610</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_576"></span>[218:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_576.md) 'I tau,' different
persuasions. It was during Buddha's stay near Râ*g*ag*ri*ha that
different rules for the direction of the 'Order' were framed. See
Romantic Legend, p. 340 seq. There is no reference in our text to the
stately march of Buddha to Kapilavastu, or of the different messages
sent to him, as related by Bigandet, p. 160, and in Hardy's Manual of
Buddhism, pp. 198, 199, also Romantic Legend, p. 349.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[218:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_577.md) Yih-mi-fă,
'one-taste law.'

<span id="fn_578"></span>[218:4](sbe1921.htm#fr_578.md) That is,
Râ*g*ag*ri*ha; the city surrounded by five mountains.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[219:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_579.md) This may be the
Nyagrodha garden alluded to by Spence Hardy, Manual of Buddhism, p. 200,
and also in the Romantic Legend, p. 350. The symbols ni-kin, however,
seem to have some other equivalent, such as Nigantha.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[219:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_580.md) This of course
means 'a religious offering,' or 'service of religion,' i.e. agreeable
to religion.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[219:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_581.md) There is no
reference here to their conversion as in the Southern accounts. The
account in the Manual of Buddhism, p. 200, of the king's preparation to
meet his son, bears the appearance of a late date, and in exaggeration
surpasses all we find in the Northern books.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[220:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_582.md) That is, whether
religion required a greeting first from him, the father.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[220:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_583.md) An Arhat or
distinguished saint.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[220:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_584.md) Without any
summons.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[220:4](sbe1921.htm#fr_585.md) I supply this (as
in many other cases); in the text we are without direction when and
where to bring in these explanatory phrases,

<span id="fn_586"></span>[221:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_586.md) This translation is
doubtful; there is some question as to the correct reading.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[221:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_587.md) Buddha is often
called 'the golden mountain,' and in this particular, as in many others,
there is in Buddhism a marked resemblance with traditions known among
primitive races; Bel, for example, is called 'the great mountain.'

<span id="fn_588"></span>[221:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_588.md) That is, as I
understand it, to move his father's mind. It may be understood, however,
in the sense of carrying out his own purpose.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[222:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_589.md) Here we have an
account of the grotesque miracles that distinguish this part of the
narrative in all Northern Buddhist books; see Romantic Legend, p. 352.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[222:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_590.md) This is probably
the twin-miracle (yamaka-pâ*t*ihâriya*n*) referred to by Mr. Rhys
Davids, Birth Stories, p. 105 n.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[222:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_591.md) That is, of the
relative duties of father and son.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[222:4](sbe1921.htm#fr_592.md) This phrase, 'the
way of sweet dew,' I can only restore to 'the <span id="page_223">p.
223</span> way of immortality;' of course it means 'immortality'
(am*ri*ta*m*) according to Buddhist ideas, that is, Nirvâ*n*a. Childers
tells us that 'Buddhaghosa says that Nirvâ*n*a is called amata, because
not being born it does not decay or die' (Pâli Dict., sub amata*m*).
This definition of Nirvâ*n*a is the usual one found in Chinese books,
that state which admits 'neither of birth nor death.'

<span id="fn_593"></span>[223:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_593.md) Referring to the
three inferior kinds of birth, as a beast, a preta, or in hell.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[224:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_594.md) The 'fourth birth'
would be as 'a man;' but it may refer here to birth as 'a Deva.'

<span id="fn_595"></span>[224:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_595.md) That is, in the
'four truths.'

<span id="fn_596"></span>[225:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_596.md) That is, the oath
to become enlightened and a deliverer.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[226:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_597.md) That is, to become
mendicants, or religious followers of Buddha.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[226:2](sbe1921.htm#fr_598.md) The conversion of
Nanda &c. is referred to in Spence Hardy's Manual of Buddhism, p. 227. I
have restored Kin-pi to Kimbila from this authority, p. 228. Perhaps
also in the. Romantic Legend, p. 386, it ought to have been so restored.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[226:3](sbe1921.htm#fr_599.md) Kun-ka-to-na. I do
not remember having met with this name before. It may be meant for
*Kh*andaka, see Schiefner, 'Lebensbeschreibung *S*âkyamuni's,' p. 266.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[227:1](sbe1921.htm#fr_600.md) Or, living in
peaceful prosecution of his work.
