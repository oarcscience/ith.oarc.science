### VARGA 4. PUTTING AWAY DESIRE.

The prince on entering the garden, the women came around to pay him
court; and to arouse in him thoughts frivolous; with ogling ways and
deep design, <span class="margnote">. 254</span>

Each one setting herself off to best advantage; or joining together in
harmonious concert, clapping their hands, or moving their feet in
unison, or joining close, body to body, limb to limb; <span
class="margnote">. 255</span>

Or indulging in smart repartees, and mutual smiles; or assuming a
thoughtful saddened countenance, and so by sympathy to please the
prince, and provoke in him a heart affected by love. <span
class="margnote">. 256</span>

But all the women beheld the prince, clouded in brow, and his godlike
body not exhibiting its wonted signs of beauty; fair in bodily
appearance, surpassingly lovely <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md),
<span class="margnote">. 251</span>

All looked upwards as they gazed, as when we call upon the moon Deva to
come <span id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_117.md); but all their subtle
devices <span id="fr_118"></span>[3](#fn_118.md) were ineffectual to move
Bodhisattva's heart. <span class="margnote">. 258</span>

At last commingling together they join and look astonished and in fear,
silent without a word. Then there was a Brahmaputra, whose name was
called Udâyi <span id="fr_119"></span>[4](#fn_119) (Yau-to-i.md). <span
class="margnote">. 259</span>

(He) addressing the women, said, 'Now all of

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

you, so graceful and fair, (see if you cannot) by your combined power
hit on some device; for beauty's power is not for ever. <span
class="margnote">. 260</span>

'Still it holds the world in bondage, by secret ways and lustful arts;
but no such loveliness in all the world (as yours), equal to that of
heavenly nymphs <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md); <span
class="margnote">. 261</span>

'The gods beholding it would leave their queens, spirits and *Ri*shis
would be misled by it; why not then the prince, the son of an earthly
king <span id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)? why should not his feelings
be aroused? <span class="margnote">. 262</span>

'This prince indeed, though he restrains his heart and holds it
fixed <span id="fr_122"></span>[3](#fn_122.md), pure-minded, with virtue
uncontaminated, not to be overcome by power of women; <span
class="margnote">. 263</span>

'(Yet) of old there was Sundarî (Su-to-li) able to destroy the great
*Ri*shi, and to lead him to indulge in love, and so degrade his boasted
eminence <span id="fr_123"></span>[4](#fn_123.md); <span class="margnote">.
264</span>

'Undergoing long penance, Gautama fell likewise (by the arts of) a
heavenly queen; Shing-kü, a *Ri*shi putra, practising lustful
indulgences according to fancy <span id="fr_124"></span>[5](#fn_124.md),
(was lost). <span class="margnote">. 265</span>

'The Brahman *Ri*shi Vi*s*vâmitra (Pi-she-po), living religiously <span
id="fr_125"></span>[6](#fn_125.md) for ten thousand years, deeply

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

ensnared by a heavenly queen, in one day was completely shipwreck’d in
faith <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md); <span class="margnote">.
266</span>

'Thus those enticing women, by their power, overcame the Brahman
ascetics how much more may ye, by your arts, overpower (the resolves) of
the king's son; <span class="margnote">. 267</span>

'Strive therefore after new devices <span
id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md), let not the king fail in a successor to
the throne; women, altho’ naturally weak <span
id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_128.md), are high and potent in the way of
ruling men. <span class="margnote">. 268</span>

'What may not their arts accomplish in promoting in men a lustful
(impure) desire?' At this time all the attendant women, hearing
throughout the words of Udâyi, <span class="margnote">. 269</span>

Increasing their powers of pleasing, as the quiet horse when touched by
the whip, went into the presence of the royal prince, and each one
strove in the practice of every kind of art, <span class="margnote">.
270</span>

(They) joined in music and in smiling conversation, raising their
eyebrows, showing their white teeth, with ogling looks, glancing one at
the other, their light drapery exhibiting their white bodies, <span
class="margnote">. 271</span>

Daintily moving with mincing gait, acting the part of a bride as if
coming gradually nearer <span id="fr_129"></span>[4](#fn_129.md), desiring
to promote in him a feeling of love, remembering the words of the great
king <span id="fr_130"></span>[5](#fn_130.md), <span class="margnote">.
272</span>

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

'With dissolute form and slightly clad, forgetful of modesty and womanly
reserve.' The prince with resolute heart was silent and still, with
unmoved face (he sat); <span class="margnote">. 273</span>

Even as the great elephant-dragon, whilst the entire herd moves round
him <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md); so nothing could disturb or
move his heart, dwelling in their midst as in a confined room <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_132.md). <span class="margnote">. 274</span>

Like the divine *S*akra, around whom all the Devîs assemble, so was the
prince as he dwelt in the gar-dens; (the maidens) encircling him thus;
<span class="margnote">. 275</span>

Some arranging their dress, others washing their hands or feet, others
perfuming their bodies with scent, others twining flowers for
decoration, <span class="margnote">. 276</span>

Others making strings for jewelled necklets, others rubbing or striking
their bodies, others resting, or lying, one beside the other, others,
with head inclined, whispering secret words, <span class="margnote">.
277</span>

Others engaged in common sports, others talking of amorous things,
others assuming lustful attitudes, striving thus to move his heart;
<span class="margnote">. 278</span>

But Bodhisattva, peaceful and collected, firm as a rock, difficult to
move, hearing all these women's talk, unaffected either to joy or
sorrow, <span class="margnote">. 279</span>

Was driven still more to serious thought, sighing to witness such
strange conduct, and beginning to understand the women's design, by
these means to disconcert his mind, <span class="margnote">. 280</span>

'Not knowing that youthful beauty soon falls, destroyed by old age and
death, fading and perishing! This is the great distress! What ignorance

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

and delusion (he reflected) overshadow their minds, <span
class="margnote">. 281</span>

'Surely they ought to consider old age, disease, and death, and day and
night stir themselves up to exertion, whilst this sharp double-edged
sword hangs over the neck. What room for sport or laughter, <span
class="margnote">. 282</span>

'Beholding those (monsters) old age, disease, and death? A man who is
unable to resort to this inward knowledge, what is he but a wooden or a
plaster man, what heart-consideration in such a case! <span
class="margnote">. 283</span>

'Like the double tree that appears in the desert, with leaves and fruit
all perfect and ripe, the first cut down and destroyed, the other
unmoved by apprehension, <span class="margnote">. 284</span>

'So it is in the case of the mass of men, they have no understanding
either!' At this time Udâyi came to the place where the prince was,
<span class="margnote">. 285</span>

And observing his silent and thoughtful mien, unmoved by any desire for
indulgence (the five desires), he forthwith addressed the prince, and
said, 'The Mahâra*g*a, by his former appointment <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md), <span class="margnote">. 286</span>

'Has selected me to act as friend to his son; may I therefore speak some
friendly words? an enlightened friendship (or, friend) is of three
sorts, that which removes things unprofitable, <span class="margnote">.
287</span>

'Promotes that which is real gain, and stands by a friend in adversity.
I claim the name of

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "enlightened
friend," and would renounce all that is magisterial, <span
class="margnote">. 288</span>

'But yet not speak lightly or with indifference. What then are the three
sources of advantage? listen, and I will now utter true words, and prove
myself a true and sincere adviser. <span class="margnote">. 289</span>

'When the years are fresh and ripening, beauty and pleasing qualities in
bloom, not to give proper weight to woman's influence, this is a weak
man's policy (body) <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md). <span
class="margnote">. 290</span>

'It is right sometimes to be of a crafty mind, submitting to those
little subterfuges, which find a place in the heart's undercurrents, and
obeying what those thoughts suggest, <span class="margnote">. 291</span>

'In way of pleasures to be got from dalliance, this is no wrong in
woman's (eye)! even if now the heart has no desire, yet it is fair to
follow such devices; <span class="margnote">. 292</span>

'Agreement (acquiescence) is the joy of woman's heart, acquiescence is
the substance (the full) of true adornment; but if a man reject these
overtures, he's like a tree deprived of leaves and fruits; <span
class="margnote">. 293</span>

'Why then ought you to yield and acquiesce? that you may share in all
these things. Because in taking, there's an end of trouble--no light and
changeful thoughts then worry us--294

'For pleasure is the first and foremost thought of all, the gods
themselves cannot dispense with it. Lord *S*akra was drawn by it to love
the wife of Gautama the *Ri*shi; <span class="margnote">. 295</span>

'So likewise the *Ri*shi Agastya, through a long

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

period of discipline <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md), practising
austerities, from hankering after a heavenly queen (Devî), lost all
reward of his religious endeavours, 296°

'The *Ri*shi B*ri*haspati, and *K*andradeva putra; the *Ri*shi
Parâ*s*ara, and Kava*ñg*ara (Kia-pin-*k*e-lo) <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136.md): <span class="margnote">. 297</span>

'All these, out of many others, were overcome by woman's love. How much
more then, in your case, should you partake in such pleasant joys; <span
class="margnote">. 298</span>

'Nor refuse, with wilful heart, to participate in the worldly delights,
which your present station, possessed of such advantages, offers you, in
the presence of these attendants.' <span class="margnote">. 299</span>

At this time the royal prince, hearing the words of his friend Udâyi, so
skilfully put, with such fine distinction, cleverly citing worldly
instances, <span class="margnote">. 300</span>

Answered thus to Udâyi: 'Thank you for having spoken sincerely to me,
let me likewise answer you in the same way, and let your heart suspend
its judgment whilst you listen; <span class="margnote">. 301</span>

'It is not that I am careless about beauty, or am ignorant of (the power
of) human joys, but only that I see on all the impress of change;
therefore my heart is sad and heavy; <span class="margnote">. 302</span>

'If these things were sure of lasting, without the ills of age, disease,
and death, then would I too take my fill of love; and to the end find no
disgust or sadness; <span class="margnote">. 303</span>

'If you will undertake to cause these women's beauty not after-while to
change or wither, then, though the joy of love may have its evil, still
it might hold the mind in thraldom; <span class="margnote">. 304</span>

('To know that other) men grow old, sicken, and

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

die, would be enough to rob such joys of satisfaction; yet how much more
in their own case (knowing this) would discontentment fill the mind;
<span class="margnote">. 305</span>

'(To know) such pleasures hasten to decay, and their bodies likewise;
if, notwithstanding this, men yield to the power of love, their case
indeed is like the very beasts. <span class="margnote">. 306</span>

'And now you cite the names of many *Ri*shis, who practised lustful ways
in life; their cases likewise cause me sorrow, for in that they did
these things, they perished. <span class="margnote">. 307</span>

'Again, you cite the name of that illustrious king, who freely gratified
his passions, but he, in like way, perished in the act; know, then, that
he was not a conqueror (*G*ina); <span class="margnote">. 308</span>

'With smooth words to conceal an intrigue, and to persuade one's
neighbour to consent, and by consenting to defile his mind; how can this
be called a just device? <span class="margnote">. 309</span>

'It is but to seduce one with a hollow lie,--such ways are not for me to
practise; or, for those who love the truth and honesty; for they are,
forsooth, unrighteous ways, <span class="margnote">. 310</span>

'And such a disposition is hard to reverence; shaping one's conduct
after one's likings, liking this or that, and seeing no harm in it, what
method of experience is this! <span class="margnote">. 311</span>

'A hollow compliance, and a protesting heart, such method is not for me
to follow; but this I know, old age, disease, and death, these are the
great afflictions which accumulate, <span class="margnote">. 312</span>

And overwhelm me with their presence; on these I find no friend to
speak, alas! alas! Udâyi! these, after all, are the great concerns;
<span class="margnote">. 313</span>

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

'The pain of birth, old age, disease, and death; this grief is that we
have to fear; the eyes see all things falling to decay, and yet the
heart finds joy in following them; <span class="margnote">. 314</span>

'But I have little strength of purpose, or command; this heart of mine
is feeble and distraught, reflecting thus on age, disease, and death.
Distracted, as I never was before; <span class="margnote">. 315</span>

'Sleepless by night and day, how can I then indulge in pleasure? Old
age, disease, and death consuming me, their certainty beyond a doubt,
<span class="margnote">. 316</span>

'And still to have no heavy thoughts, in truth my heart would be a log
or stone.' Thus the prince, for Uda's sake, used every kind of skilful
argument, <span class="margnote">. 317</span>

Describing all the pains of pleasure; and not perceiving that the day
declined. And now the waiting women all, with music and their various
attractions, <span class="margnote">. 318</span>

Seeing that all were useless for the end, with shame began to flock back
to the city; the prince beholding all the gardens, bereft of their gaudy
ornaments, <span class="margnote">. 319</span>

The women all returning home, the place becoming silent and deserted,
felt with twofold strength the thought of impermanence. With saddened
mien going back, he entered his palace; <span class="margnote">.
320</span>

The king, his father, hearing of the prince, his heart estranged from
thoughts of pleasure, was greatly overcome with sorrow, and like a sword
it pierced his heart. <span class="margnote">. 321</span>

Forthwith assembling all his council, he sought of them some means to
gain his end; they all replied, 'These sources of desire are not enough
to hold and captivate his heart.' <span class="margnote">. 322</span>

<span id="fn_124"></span>[39:5](sbe1906.htm#fr_124.md) The phrase which
ends this line is obscure. It may be rendered thus, Shing-kü, the
*Ri*shi putra, practised lustful ways, beside the flowings of the
fountain.' \[See a similar case, Catena of Buddhist Scriptures, p.
259.\] The Sanskrit text is as follows: '*Ri*shyas*ri*ṅga, the son of a

\[The great king was probably the father of Buddha.\]

<span id="fn_131"></span>[41:1](sbe1906.htm#fr_131.md) Or, surrounded by
the entire herd.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[41:2](sbe1906.htm#fr_132.md) That is, cramped in
the midst of the encircling crowd of girls.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[42:1](sbe1906.htm#fr_133.md) This passage is
obscure; literally it is 'former--seeing--command.'

<span id="fn_134"></span>[43:1](sbe1906.htm#fr_134.md) 'This is the
character of non-victorious men,' Again there is a play on the word
'Shing' a *G*ina. The Sanskrit renders it 'rudeness.' The Chinese
fi-shing-*g*in may also mean coarse or unpolished.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[44:1](sbe1906.htm#fr_135.md) '*K*ang-yê,' the
long night.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[44:2](sbe1906.htm#fr_136.md) The Sanskrit text
has, 'Vasish*th*a begat Kapi*ñg*alâda.'
