### VARGA 24. THE DIFFERENCES OF THE LI*KKH*AVIS.

The venerable Ânanda, seeing the earth shaking on every side, his heart
was fearful and his hair erect; he asked the cause thereof of Buddha.
<span class="margnote">. 1847</span>

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

Buddha replied: 'Ânanda! I have fixed three months to end my life, the
rest of life I utterly give up; this is the reason why the earth is
greatly shaken.' <span class="margnote">. 1848</span>

Ânanda, hearing the instruction of Buddha, was moved with pity and the
tears flowed down his face, even as when an elephant of mighty strength
shakes (with a blow) the sandal-wood tree. <span class="margnote">.
1849</span>

Thus was (Ânanda) shaken and his mind perturbed, whilst down (his
cheeks) the tears, like drops of perfume, flowed; so much he loved the
lord his master, so full of kindness (was he), and, as yet, not freed
from earthly thoughts (desire) <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_726.md).
<span class="margnote">. 1850</span>

Thinking then on these four things <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_727.md)
alone, he gave his grief full liberty, nor could he master it, (but
said), 'Now I hear the lord declare that he has fixed for good his time
to die (Nirvâ*n*a), <span class="margnote">. 1851</span>

'My body fails, my strength is gone, my mind is dazed, my soul is all
discordant, and all the words of truth forgotten; a wild deserted waste
seems heaven and earth. <span class="margnote">. 1852</span>

'Have pity! save me, master (lord of the world)! perish not so
soon <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_728.md)! Perished with bitter
cold <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_729.md), I chanced upon a
fire--forthwith it disappeared. <span class="margnote">. 1853</span>

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

'Wandering amid the wilds of grief and pain, deceived, confused, I lost
my way--suddenly a wise and prudent guide encountered me, but hardly
saved from my bewilderment, he once more vanished. <span
class="margnote">. 1854</span>

'Like some poor man treading through endless mud, weary and parched with
thirst, longs for the water, suddenly he lights upon a cool refreshing
lake, he hastens to it--lo! it dries before him. <span
class="margnote">. 1855</span>

'The deep blue, bright, refulgent eye <span
id="fr_730"></span>[1](#fn_730.md), piercing through all the worlds, with
wisdom brightens the dark gloom, the darkness (but) for a moment is
dispelled <span id="fr_731"></span>[2](#fn_731.md). <span
class="margnote">. 1856</span>

'As when the blade shoots through the yielding earth, the clouds collect
and we await the welcome shower, then a fierce wind drives the big
clouds away, and so with disappointed hope we watch the dried-up field!
<span class="margnote">. 1857</span>

'Deep darkness reigned for want of wisdom, the world of sentient
creatures groped for light, Tathâgata lit up the lamp of wisdom, then
suddenly extinguished it--ere he had brought it out <span
id="fr_732"></span>[3](#fn_732.md).' <span class="margnote">. 1858</span>

Buddha, hearing Ânanda speaking thus, grieved at his words, and pitying
his distress, with soothing accents and with gentle presence spake with
purpose to declare the one true <span id="fr_733"></span>[4](#fn_733.md)
law: <span class="margnote">. 1859</span>

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

'If men but knew their own <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_734.md) nature,
they would not dwell (indulge) in sorrow; everything that lives,
whate’er it be <span id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_735.md), all this is
subject to destruction's law; <span class="margnote">. 1860</span>

'I have already told you plainly, the law (nature) of things
"joined <span id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_736.md)" is to "separate;" the
principle of kindness and of love <span id="fr_737"></span>[4](#fn_737.md)
is not abiding, ’tis better then to reject this pitiful and doting
heart. <span class="margnote">. 1861</span>

'All things around us bear the stamp of instant change; born, they
perish; no self-sufficiency <span id="fr_738"></span>[5](#fn_738.md); those
who would wish to keep them long, find in the end no room for doing so.
<span class="margnote">. 1862</span>

'If things around us could be kept for aye, and were not liable to
change or separation, then this would be salvation <span
id="fr_739"></span>[6](#fn_739.md)! where then can this be sought? <span
class="margnote">. 1863</span>

'You, and all that lives, can seek in me this great deliverance! That
which you may all attain

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have already
told you, (and tell you) to the end. <span class="margnote">.
1864</span>

'Why then should I preserve this body? The body of the excellent
law <span id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_740.md) shall long endure! I am
resolved; I look for rest! This is the one thing needful <span
id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_741.md). <span class="margnote">. 1865</span>

'So do I now instruct all creatures, and as a guide, not seen before, I
lead them; prepare yourselves to cast off consciousness <span
id="fr_742"></span>[3](#fn_742.md), fix yourselves well in your own
island <span id="fr_743"></span>[4](#fn_743.md). <span class="margnote">.
1866</span>

Those who are thus fixed (mid-stream), with single aim and earnestness
striving in the use of means, preparing quietly a quiet place, not moved
by others' way of thinking, <span class="margnote">. 1867</span>

'Know well, such men are safe on the law's island. Fixed in
contemplation, lighted by the lamp of wisdom, they have thus finally
destroyed ignorance and gloom. Consider well the world's four bounds,
<span class="margnote">. 1868</span>

'And dare to seek for true religion only; forget "yourself," and every
"ground of self," the bones, the nerves, the skin, the flesh, the mucus,
the blood that flows through every little vein; <span class="margnote">.
1869</span>

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

'Behold these things as constantly impure, what joy then can there be in
such a body? every sensation born from cause, like the bubble floating
on the water. <span class="margnote">. 1870</span>

'The sorrow coming from (the consciousness of) birth and death and
inconstancy, removes all thought of joy--the mind acquainted with the
law of production <span id="fr_744"></span>[1](#fn_744.md), stability, and
destruction, (recognises) how again and once again things follow or
(succeed one another) with no endurance. <span class="margnote">.
1871</span>

'But thinking well about Nirvâ*n*a <span
id="fr_745"></span>[2](#fn_745.md), the thought of endurance is for ever
dismissed, (we see how) the sa*m*skâras <span
id="fr_746"></span>[3](#fn_746.md) from causes have arisen, and how these
aggregates will again dissolve, all of them impermanent. <span
class="margnote">. 1872</span>

'The foolish man conceives the idea of "self," the wise man sees there
is no ground on which to build the idea of "self," thus through the
world he rightly looks and well concludes, <span class="margnote">.
1873</span>

'All, therefore, is but evil (one perverse way)--the aggregate amassed
by sorrow must perish (in the end)! if once confirmed in this
conviction, that man perceives the truth. <span class="margnote">.
1874</span>

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

'This body, too, of Buddha now existing (soon will) perish, the law is
one and constant, and without exception.' Buddha having delivered this
excellent sermon, appeased the heart of Ânanda, <span class="margnote">.
1875</span>

Then all the Li*kkh*avis, hearing the report <span
id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_747.md), with fear and apprehension assembled in
a body; devoid of their usual ornaments, they hastened to the place
where Buddha was. <span class="margnote">. 1876</span>

Having saluted him according to custom, they stood on one side, wishing
to ask him a question, but not being able to find words. Buddha, knowing
well their heart, by way of remedy, in the right use of means <span
id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_748.md), spake thus: <span class="margnote">.
1877</span>

'Now I perfectly understand that you have in your minds unusual
thoughts, not referring to worldly matters, but wholly connected with
subjects of religion; <span class="margnote">. 1878</span>

'And now you wish to hear from me, what may be known respecting the
report about my resolve to terminate my life, and my purpose to put an
end to the repetition of birth. <span class="margnote">. 1879</span>

'Impermanence is the nature of all that exists <span
id="fr_749"></span>[3](#fn_749.md), constant change and restlessness its
conditions; unfixed, unprofitable, without the marks of long endurance.
<span class="margnote">. 1880</span>

'In ancient days the *Ri*shi kings, Vasish*th*a *Ri*shi,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mândhât*ri*, the
*K*akravartin monarchs, and the rest, these and all others like them,
<span class="margnote">. 1881</span>

'The former conquerors (*G*inas), who lived with strength like Î*s*vara,
these all have long ago perished, not one remains till now; <span
class="margnote">. 1882</span>

The sun and moon, *S*akra himself, and the great multitude of his
attendants, will all, without exception, perish <span
id="fr_750"></span>[1](#fn_750.md); there is not one that can for long
endure; <span class="margnote">. 1883</span>

All the Buddhas of the past ages, numerous as the sands of the Ganges,
by their wisdom enlightening the world, have all gone out as a
lamp <span id="fr_751"></span>[2](#fn_751.md); <span class="margnote">.
1884</span>

'All the Buddhas yet to come will also perish in the same way; why then
should I alone be different? I too will pass into Nirvâ*n*a; <span
class="margnote">. 1885</span>

'But as they prepared others for salvation, so now should you press
forward in the path; Vai*s*âlî may be glad indeed, if you should find
the way of rest! <span class="margnote">. 1886</span>

'The world, in truth, is void of help, the "three worlds" not enough for
joy--stay then the course of sorrow, by engendering a heart without
desire. <span class="margnote">. 1887</span>

'Give up for good the long and straggling (way of life), press onward on
the northern track <span id="fr_752"></span>[3](#fn_752.md), step by

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

step advance along the upward road, as the sun skirts along (approaches)
the western <span id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_753.md) mountains.' <span
class="margnote">. 1888</span>

At this time the Li*kkh*avis, with saddened hearts, went back along the
way; lifting their hands to heaven and sighing bitterly: 'Alas! what
sorrow this! <span class="margnote">. 1889</span>

'His body like the pure gold mountain <span
id="fr_754"></span>[2](#fn_754.md), the marks upon his person so majestic,
ere long and like a towering crag he falls; not to live, then why not,
"not to love <span id="fr_755"></span>[3](#fn_755.md)?" <span
class="margnote">. 1890</span>

'The powers of birth and death, weakened awhile; the lord Tathâgata,
himself the fount (mother) of wisdom (appeared), and now to give it up
and disappear! without a saviour now, what check to sorrow. <span
class="margnote">. 1891</span>

'The world long time endured in darkness, and men were led by a false
light along the way--when lo! the sun of wisdom rose; and now, again, it
fades and dies--no warning given. <span class="margnote">. 1892</span>

'Behold the whirling waves of ignorance engulfing all the world! (Why
is) the bridge or raft of wisdom in a moment cut away? <span
class="margnote">. 1893</span>

'The loving and the great physician king (came) with remedies of wisdom,
beyond all price, to heal the hurts and pains of men--why suddenly goes
he away? <span class="margnote">. 1894</span>

'The excellent and heavenly flag of love adorned with wisdom's blazonry,
embroidered with the diamond

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

heart, the world not satisfied with gazing on it, <span
class="margnote">. 1895</span>

'The glorious flag of heavenly worship <span
id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_756.md)! Why in a moment is it snapped? Why such
misfortune for the world, when from the tide of constant revolutions
<span class="margnote">. 1896</span>

'A way of escape was opened-but now shut again! and there is no escape
from weary sorrow!' Tathâgata, possessed of fond and loving heart, now
steels himself and goes away; <span class="margnote">. 1897</span>

He holds his heart <span id="fr_757"></span>[2](#fn_757.md) so patient and
so loving, and, like the Wai-ka-ni (Vakkani?) flower, with thoughts cast
down (irresolute) and tardy, he goes depressed along the road; <span
class="margnote">. 1898</span>

Or like a man fresh from a loved one's grave, the funeral past and the
last farewell taken, comes back (with anxious look). <span
class="margnote">. 1899</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[269:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_726.md) 'Freedom from
desire' (vîtarâga) was the distinction of an Arhat; Ânanda had not yet
arrived at this condition.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[269:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_727.md) 'These four
things,' or, the things of the world; 'the four' denoting the 'four
quarters,' that is, 'the world.'

<span id="fn_728"></span>[269:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_728.md) This and the
previous line may otherwise be translated,' Have pity! save the world, O
lord! from this so unexpected an end (of your life).'

<span id="fn_729"></span>[269:4](sbe1926.htm#fr_729.md) These and the
succeeding comparisons represent the condition of Ânanda in prospect of
Buddha's death.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[270:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_730.md) That is, the eye of
Buddha, about which so much is said in the books.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[270:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_731.md) Such appears to be
the meaning of the passage, implying that the disappearance of darkness
is but for a moment.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[270:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_732.md) Or, alas! why bring
it out!

<span id="fn_733"></span>[270:4](sbe1926.htm#fr_733.md) The expression
here, as in other cases, is a strong affirmative, 'the true law of
truth,' 'the only true law;' the word 'law' means religious system.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[271:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_734) '(The character of.md)
self-nature,' or as in the text.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[271:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_735.md) 'All things that
have a personal or individual existence.' It would be well to compare
the, spirit of this sermon with the old belief of the Veda, respecting
the birth of the 'one nature' from which the visible world took shape
(History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature by Max Müller, p. 561). It seems
that the effort of Buddha was to transcend the time of the birth of this
nature, and thus arrive at the condition of the original first cause,
which 'breathed breathless;' in other words, this is the condition of
Nirvâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[271:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_736.md) As in the
concluding verse of the Va*g*ra*kkh*edikâ Sûtra, 'târakâ timira*m*,' &c.
Analecta Oxoniensia, Aryan Series, vol. I, part i, p. 46.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[271:4](sbe1926.htm#fr_737.md) 'Love' in the sense
of parental love; or the love which produced the world.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[271:5](sbe1926.htm#fr_738.md) In the Rig-veda
(according to Dr. Muir) the gods though spoken of as immortal are not
regarded as unbeginning or self-existent; see Journal of the Royal
Asiatic Society, 1864, p. 62.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[271:6](sbe1926.htm#fr_739.md) That is, there
would be no need to seek salvation, for it would be already possessed.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[272:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_740.md) The 'body of the
law' represents the teaching of the word of Buddha, which teaching is
supposed to be accompanied with or attended by a living power, ever
dwelling with the congregation of the faithful.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[272:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_741.md) 'That which is
wanting only resides in this.'

<span id="fn_742"></span>[272:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_742.md) The Chinese 'siang'
is equivalent to Sanskrit sa*ñgñ*â, the third skandha (constituents of
personal being). It is the receptive (subjective) power, in distinction
to the perceptive power (vedanâ). Buddha denied the necessity of
personal consciousness (i.e. of self-consciousness, or consciousness of
self) as an element of life, i.e. life in the abstract.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[272:4](sbe1926.htm#fr_743.md) This idea of 'an
island' (dvipa), fixed amid the running stream of life, is found in
Dhammapada, verse 25.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[273:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_744.md) The law of
production, stability, and destruction; this refers to the Buddhist
theory of the successive stages in the development of the world. The
world is produced from chaos, established for a period, and then
destroyed; and this law is a perpetual one, extending through all space
(the infinite systems of worlds) and through all time.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[273:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_745.md) Nirvâ*n*a,
quietness and extinction.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[273:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_746.md) The sa*m*skâras,
the elements of being, i.e. individual being (for a full account of this
term, see Childers' Pâli Dict. sub voce). With regard to the use of the
Chinese 'hing' for sa*m*skâra, see Eitel, Handbook, sub sa*m*skâra; also
consult Colebrooke, Hindu Philosophy, p. 254, and Burnouf (Introduction,
pp. 504, 505, note 2).

<span id="fn_747"></span>[274:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_747.md) 'Hearing it,' in
the original, i.e. hearing the report of Buddha's approaching death.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[274:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_748.md) 'The right use of
means' is the rendering of the Chinese 'fang pien,' the Sanskrit upâya;
this term may mean 'by artifice,' or, 'by way of expedient;' but
generally it refers to the use of means to an end, where the 'means' are
evanescent and illusory; the end attained, lasting and real.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[274:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_749.md) Here we have the
well-known Pâli formula 'sabbe sa*m*khârâ ani*kk*â.'

<span id="fn_750"></span>[275:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_750.md) That the gods were
considered to be mortal appears, as Wilson says (Rig-veda, vol. i, p. 7
n), from the title (nara) given to them. Compare also Coxe, Mythol. II,
p. 13, and Muir, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1864, p. 62.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[275:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_751.md) This idea of a lamp
going out is a fundamental one as a definition of Nirvâ*n*a
(pa*gg*otassa nibbânam). Its meaning has been discussed by Professor Max
Müller in his Introduction to Buddhaghosha's Parables (by Captain
Rogers).

<span id="fn_752"></span>[275:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_752.md) That is, the
northern track of the sun.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[276:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_753.md) The idea appears to
be, that as the sun advances in his course, he approaches the western
mountains as his true setting place, i.e. he approaches the equinoctial
point.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[276:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_754.md) This comparison of
Buddha's body to the golden mountain (sumeru) is a very frequent one,
and is probably allied in its origin with the idea of Bel, 'the great
mountain' (sadu rabu).

<span id="fn_755"></span>[276:3](sbe1926.htm#fr_755.md) The sense is, 'if
he dies, where is the proof of his love?'

<span id="fn_756"></span>[277:1](sbe1926.htm#fr_756.md) Religious
sacrifices.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[277:2](sbe1926.htm#fr_757.md) That is, he
restrains himself.
