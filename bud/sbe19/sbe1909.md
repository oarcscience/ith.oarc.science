### VARGA 7. ENTERING THE PLACE (WOOD) OF AUSTERITIES.

The prince having dismissed *K*andaka, as he entered the *Ri*shis'
abode, his graceful body brightly

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

shining, lit up on every side the forest 'place of suffering;' <span
class="margnote">. 495</span>

Himself gifted with every excellence (Siddhârtha), according to his
gifts, so were they reflected. As the lion, the king of beasts, when he
enters among the herd of beasts, <span class="margnote">. 496</span>

Drives from their minds all thoughts of common things <span
id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_181.md), as now they watch the true form of
their kind <span id="fr_182"></span>[2](#fn_182.md), so those *Ri*shi
masters assembled there, suddenly perceiving the miraculous
portent <span id="fr_183"></span>[3](#fn_183.md), <span class="margnote">.
497</span>

Were struck with awe and fearful gladness <span
id="fr_184"></span>[4](#fn_184.md), as they gazed with earnest eyes and
hands conjoined. The men and women too, engaged in various occupations,
beholding him, with unchanged attitudes, <span class="margnote">.
498</span>

Gazed as the gods look on king *S*akra, with constant look and eyes
unmoved; so the *Ri*shis, with their feet fixed fast, looked at him even
thus; <span class="margnote">. 499</span>

Whatever in their hands they held, without releasing it, they stopped
and looked; even as the ox when yoked to the wain, his body bound, his
mind also restrained; <span class="margnote">. 500</span>

So also the followers of the holy *Ri*shis, each called the other to
behold the miracle. The peacocks and the other birds with cries
commingled flapped their wings; <span class="margnote">. 501</span>

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

The Brahma*k*ârins holding the rules of deer <span
id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md), following the deer wandering through
mountain glades, (as the) deer coarse of nature, with flashing eyes
\[shen shih\], regard (or see) the prince with fixed gaze; <span
class="margnote">. 502</span>

So following the deer, those Brahma*k*ârins intently gaze likewise,
looking at the exceeding glory of the Ikshvâku. As the glory of the
rising sun <span class="margnote">. 503</span>

Is able to affect the herds of milch kine, so as to increase the
quantity of their sweet-scented milk, so those Brahma*k*ârins, with
wondrous joy, thus spoke .one to the other: <span class="margnote">.
504</span>

'Surely this is one of the eight Vasu Devas <span
id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_186.md);' others, 'this is one of the two
A*s*vins <span id="fr_187"></span>[3](#fn_187.md);' others, 'this is
Mâra <span id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_188.md);' others, 'this is one of
the <span id="fr_189"></span>[5](#fn_189.md) Brahmakâyikas;' <span
class="margnote">. 505</span>

Others, 'this is Sûryadeva <span id="fr_190"></span>[6](#fn_190.md) or
*K*andradeva, coming down; are they not seeking here a sacrifice which
is their due? Come let us haste to offer our religious services!' <span
class="margnote">. 506</span>

The prince, on his part, with respectful mien addressed to them polite
salutation. Then Bodhisattva, looking with care in every direction on
the Brahma*k*ârins occupying the wood, <span class="margnote">.
507</span>

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

Each engaged in his religious duties, all desirous of the delights of
heaven, addressed the senior Brahma*k*ârin, and asked him as to the path
of true religion <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_191.md). <span
class="margnote">. 508</span>

'Now having but just come here, I do not yet know the rules of your
religious life. I ask you therefore for information, and I pray explain
to me what I ask.' <span class="margnote">. 509</span>

On this that twice-born (Brahman) in reply explained in succession all
the modes of painful discipline, and the fruits expected as their
result. <span class="margnote">. 510</span>

(How some ate) nothing brought from inhabited places (villages) <span
id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_192), (but.md) that produced from pure water,
(others) edible roots and tender twigs, (others) fruits and flowers fit
for food, <span class="margnote">. 511</span>

Each according to the rules of his sect, clothing and food in each case
different, some living amongst bird-kind, and like them capturing and
eating food; <span class="margnote">. 512</span>

Others eating as the deer the grass (and herbs); others living like
serpents, inhaling air; others eating nothing pounded in wood or stone;
some eating with two teeth, till a wound be formed; <span
class="margnote">. 513</span>

Others, again, begging their food and giving it in charity, taking only
the remnants for themselves; others, again, who let water continually
drip on their heads and those who offer up with fire; <span
class="margnote">. 514</span>

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Others who practise water-dwelling like fish <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193); thus there are (he said.md) Brahma*k*ârins
of every sort, who practise austerities, that they may at the end of
life obtain a birth in heaven, <span class="margnote">. 515</span>

And by their present sufferings afterwards obtain peaceable fruit. The
lord of men <span id="fr_194"></span>[2](#fn_194.md), the excellent master,
hearing all their modes of sorrow-producing penance, <span
class="margnote">. 516</span>

Not perceiving any element of truth in them, experienced no joyful
emotion in his heart; lost in thought, he regarded the men with pity,
and with his heart in agreement his mouth thus spake: <span
class="margnote">. 517</span>

'Pitiful indeed are such sufferings! and merely n quest of a human or
heavenly reward <span id="fr_195"></span>[3](#fn_195.md), ever revolving in
the cycle of birth or death, how great your sufferings, how small the
recompence! <span class="margnote">. 518</span>

'Leaving your friends, giving up honourable position; with a firm
purpose to obtain the joys of heaven, although you may escape little
sorrows, yet in the end involved in great sorrow; <span
class="margnote">. 519</span>

'Promoting the destruction of your outward form, and undergoing every
kind of painful penance, and yet seeking to obtain another birth;
increasing and prolonging the causes of the five desires, <span
class="margnote">. 520</span>

'Not considering that herefrom (result repeated) birth and death,
undergoing suffering and, by that, seeking further suffering; thus it is
that the world of men, though dreading the approach of death, <span
class="margnote">. 521</span>

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

'Yet strive after renewed birth; and being thus born, they must die
again. Altho’ still dreading (the power of) suffering, yet prolonging
their stay in the sea of pain: <span class="margnote">. 522</span>

'Disliking from their heart their present kind of life, yet still
striving incessantly after other life; enduring affliction that they may
partake of joy; seeking a birth in heaven, to suffer further trouble;
<span class="margnote">. 523</span>

'Seeking joys, whilst the heart sinks with feebleness. For this is so
with those who oppose right reason; they cannot but be cramped and poor
at heart. But by earnestness and diligence, then we conquer. <span
class="margnote">. 524</span>

'Walking in the path of true wisdom, letting go both extremes <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196.md), we then reach ultimate perfection; to
mortify the body, (if) this is religion, <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) then to enjoy rest, is something not
resulting from religion. <span class="margnote">. 525</span>

'To walk religiously and afterwards to receive happiness, this is to
make the fruit of religion something different from religion; but bodily
exercise is but the cause of death, strength results alone from the
mind's intention; <span class="margnote">. 526</span>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

'If you remove (from conduct) the purpose of the mind, the bodily act is
but as rotten wood; wherefore, regulate the mind, and then the body will
spontaneously go right. <span class="margnote">. 527</span>

'(You say that) to eat pure things is a cause of religious merit, but
the wild beasts and the children of poverty ever feed on these fruits
and medicinal herbs; these then ought to gain much religious merit.
<span class="margnote">. 528</span>

'But if you say that the heart being good then bodily suffering is the
cause of further merit, (then I ask) why may not those who walk (live)
in ease, also possess a virtuous heart? <span class="margnote">.
529</span>

'If joys are opposed to a virtuous heart, a virtuous heart may also be
opposed to bodily suffering; if, for instance, all those heretics
profess purity because they use water (in various ways), <span
class="margnote">. 530</span>

'Then those who thus use water among men, even with a wicked mind
(karma), yet ought ever to be pure. But if righteousness is the
groundwork of a *Ri*shi's purity, then the idea of a sacred spot as his
dwelling, <span class="margnote">. 531</span>

'Being the cause of his righteousness (is wrong). What is reverenced,
should be known and seen <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md).
Reverence indeed is due to righteous conduct, but let it not redound to
the place (or, mode of life).' <span class="margnote">. 532</span>

Thus speaking at large on religious questions, they went on till the
setting sun. He then beheld their rites in connection with sacrifice to
fire, the drilling (for sparks) and the fanning into flame, <span
class="margnote">. 533</span>

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Also the sprinkling of the butter libations, also the chanting of the
mystic prayers, till the sun went down. The prince considering these
acts, <span class="margnote">. 534</span>

Could not perceive the right reason of them, and was now desirous to
turn and go. Then all those Brahma*k*ârins came together to him to
request him to stay; <span class="margnote">. 535</span>

Regarding with reverence the dignity of Bodhisattva, very desirous, they
earnestly besought him: 'You have come from an irreligious place, to
this wood where true religion flourishes, <span class="margnote">.
536</span>

'And yet, now, you wish to go away; we beg you, then, on this account,
to stay.' All the old Brahma*k*ârins, with their twisted hair and bark
clothes, <span class="margnote">. 537</span>

Came following after Bodhisattva, asking him as a god <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) to stay a little while. Bodhisattva
seeing these aged ones following him, their bodies worn with
macerations, 538.

Stood still and rested beneath a tree; and soothing them, urged them to
return. Then all the Brahma*k*ârins, young and old, surrounding him,
made their request with joined hands: <span class="margnote">.
539</span>

'You who have so unexpectedly arrived here, amid these garden glades so
full <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200.md) of attraction, why now are
you leaving them and going away, to seek perfection in the wilderness?
<span class="margnote">. 540</span>

'As a man loving (long) life, is unwilling to let go his body, so we are
even thus; would that you would stop awhile. <span class="margnote">.
541</span>

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

'This is a spot where Brahmans and *Ri*shis have ever dwelt, royal
*Ri*shis and heavenly *Ri*shis, these all have dwelt within these woods.
The places on the borders of the snowy mountains, <span
class="margnote">. 542</span>

'Where men of high birth <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) undergo
their penance, those places are not to be compared to this. All the body
of learned masters from this place have reached heaven; <span
class="margnote">. 543</span>

'All the learned *Ri*shis who have sought religious merit, have from
this place and northwards (found it), those who have attained a
knowledge of the true law, and gained divine wisdom come not from
southwards; <span class="margnote">. 544</span>

'If you indeed see us remiss and not earnest enough, practising rules
not pure, and on that account are not pleased to stay, <span
class="margnote">. 545</span>

'Then we are the ones that ought to go; you can still remain and dwell
here, all these different Brahma*k*ârins ever desire to find companions
in their penances. <span class="margnote">. 546</span>

'And you, because you are conspicuous for your religious earnestness,
should not so quickly cast away their society: if you can remain here,
they will honour you as god *S*akra, <span class="margnote">. 547</span>

'Yea! as the Devas pay worship to B*ri*haspati <span
id="fr_202"></span>[2](#fn_202) (or, Virudhakapati.md).' Then Bodhisattva
answered the Brahma*k*ârins and told them what his desires were: <span
class="margnote">. 548</span>

'I am seeking for a true method of escape, I desire solely to destroy
all mundane influences; but you, with strong hearts, practise your rules
as ascetics, <span class="margnote">. 549</span>

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

'And pay respectful attention to such visitors as may come. My heart
indeed is moved with affection towards you, for pleasant conversation is
agreeable to all, those who listen are affected thereby; <span
class="margnote">. 550</span>

'And so hearing your words, my mind is strengthened in religious
feeling; you indeed have all paid me much respect, in agreement with the
courtesy of your religious profession; <span class="margnote">.
551</span>

'But now I am constrained to depart, my heart grieves thereat
exceedingly, first of all, having left my own kindred, and now about to
be separated from you. <span class="margnote">. 552</span>

'The pain of separation from associates, this pain is as great as the
other, it is impossible for my mind not to grieve, as it is not to see
others' faults <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md). <span
class="margnote">. 553</span>

'But you, by suffering pain, desire earnestly to obtain the joys of
birth in heaven; whilst I desire to escape from the three worlds, and
therefore I give up what my reason (mind) tells me must be ejected <span
id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md). <span class="margnote">. 554</span>

'The law which you practise, you inherit from the deeds of former
teachers, but I, desiring to destroy all combination (accumulation),
seek a law which admits of no such accident. <span class="margnote">.
555</span>

'And therefore I cannot in this grove delay for a longer while in
fruitless discussions.' At this time all the Brahma*k*ârins, hearing the
words spoken by Bodhisattva, <span class="margnote">. 556</span>

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

Words full of right reason and truth, very excellent in the distinction
of principles, their hearts rejoiced and exulted greatly, and deep
feelings of reverence were excited within them. <span class="margnote">.
557</span>

At this time there was one Brahma*k*ârin, who always slept in the dust,
with tangled hair and raiment of the bark of trees, his eyes bleared
(yellow), preparing himself in an ascetic practice (called)
'high-nose <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md).' <span
class="margnote">. 558</span>

This one addressed Bodhisattva in the following words: 'Strong in will!
bright in wisdom! firmly fixed in resolve to escape (pass beyond) the
limits of birth, knowing that in escape from birth there alone is rest,
<span class="margnote">. 559</span>

'Not affected by any desire after heavenly blessedness, the mind set
upon, the eternal destruction of the body (bodily form), you are indeed
miraculous in appearance, (as you are) alone in the possession of such a
mind. <span class="margnote">. 560</span>

'To sacrifice to the gods, and to practise every kind of austerity, all
this is designed to secure a birth in heaven, but here there is no
mortification of selfish desire, <span class="margnote">. 561</span>

'There is still a selfish personal aim; but to bend the will to seek
final escape, this is indeed the work of a true teacher, this is the aim
of an enlightened master; <span class="margnote">. 562</span>

'This place is no right halting-place for you, you ought to proceed to
Mount Pi*nd*a (Pâ*nd*ava), there dwells a great Muni, whose name is
A-lo-lam (Arâ*d*a Râma). <span class="margnote">. 563</span>

'He only has reached the end (of religious aims), the most excellent eye
(of the law). Go therefore

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

to the place where he dwells, and listen there to the true exposition of
the law. <span class="margnote">. 564</span>

'This will make your heart rejoice, as you learn to follow the precepts
of his system. As for me, beholding the joy of your resolve, and fearing
that I shall not obtain rest, <span class="margnote">. 565</span>

'I must once more let go (dismiss) those following me, and seek other
disciples; straighten my head (nose) and gaze with my full eyes; anoint
my lips and cleanse my teeth, <span class="margnote">. 566</span>

'Cover my shoulders and make bright my face, smooth my tongue and make
it pliable. Thus, O excellently marked, sir! fully drinking (at the
fountain of) the water you give (glorious water) <span
id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_206.md), <span class="margnote">. 567</span>

'I shall escape from the unfathomable depths. In the world nought is
comparable to this, that which old men and *Ri*shis have not known, that
shall (I) <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_207.md) know and obtain: <span
class="margnote">. 568</span>

Bodhisattva having listened to these words, left the company of the
*Ri*shis, whilst they all, turning round him to the right, returned to
their place. <span class="margnote">. 569</span>

id="img_07300"></span> ![](img/07300.jpg), for 'aged' (as before).

<span id="fn_192"></span>[73:2](sbe1909.htm#fr_192.md) Literally, 'opposed
to village coming out,' or, 'that which comes out of (<span
id="img_07301"></span> ![](img/07301.jpg)) villages.'

<span id="fn_193"></span>[74:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_193.md) That is, as I
understand it, *Ri*shis who live in water like fish. In the former case
the 'air-inhaling snake *Ri*shi' would be *Ri*shis who endeavour to live
on air like the boa.

had been tien-*g*in po, it would have simply meant 'a heavenly reward.'

<span id="fn_196"></span>[75:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_196.md) This line, which
(with the following ones) is obscure, may be literally translated, 'a
double letting-go, eternal Nirvâ*n*a,' where Nirvâ*n*a is in the
original <span id="img_07500"></span> ![](img/07500.jpg). The two
extremes are worldly life and ascetic life.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[75:2](sbe1909.htm#fr_197.md) The word <span
id="img_07501"></span> ![](img/07501.jpg), like dharma, is difficult to
translate. It may mean here either 'religion' or 'something formal;' but
the idea of the whole verse seems to be this, 'if suffering pain is a
part of religion, then to enjoy rest is different from religion,
therefore to practise religious austerities with the view of afterwards
obtaining rest, is to make the fruit of religion something different
from, or opposed to, religion itself.'

<span id="fn_198"></span>[76:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_198.md) This is, as it
seems, the meaning of the line, or it may be rendered, 'What is esteemed
of weight ought to be seen in the world.'

<span id="fn_199"></span>[77:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_199.md) The original is
<span id="img_07700"></span> ![](img/07700.jpg); probably <span
id="img_07701"></span> ![](img/07701.jpg) is for <span
id="img_07702"></span> ![](img/07702.jpg).

<span id="fn_200"></span>[77:2](sbe1909.htm#fr_200.md) I am not sure
whether I understand the original, or whether there is not a mistake in
the text, which is <span id="img_07703"></span> ![](img/07703.jpg).

<span id="fn_201"></span>[78:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_201.md) Tsang-*kh*ang *g*in,

<span id="fn_203"></span>[79:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_203.md) This and the
previous line might perhaps be better rendered thus, 'A joyless life
(absence of joy) is opposed to my disposition, moreover (it is my
disposition) not to observe the faults of others.'

<span id="fn_204"></span>[79:2](sbe1909.htm#fr_204.md) Literally, the form
(body) turning from them even as (<span id="img_07900"></span>
![](img/07900.jpg)) the mind rejects (<span id="img_07901"></span>
![](img/07901.jpg)); or may it be rendered, 'the body giving up, though
the mind is still perverse.'

<span id="fn_205"></span>[80:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_205.md) I.e. raising his
nose to look up at the sun.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[81:1](sbe1909.htm#fr_206.md) This line and the
context, again, is obscure. Perhaps <span id="img_08100"></span>
![](img/08100.jpg) is a mistake for <span id="img_08101"></span>
![](img/08101.jpg), which latter expression may mean the 'sweet dew'
(am*ri*ta) of Bodhisattva's doctrine.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[81:2](sbe1909.htm#fr_207) Or, that (you know.md)
and will obtain.
