### VARGA 22. THE LADY ÂMRÂ <span id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_673) (ÂMRAPÂLÎ.md) SEES BUDDHA.

The lord of the world having finished his wide work of conversion
conceived in himself a desire (heart) for Nirvâ*n*a. Accordingly
proceeding from the city of Râ*g*ag*ri*ha, he went on towards the town
of Pa-lin-fo (Pâ*t*aliputra) <span id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_674.md).
<span class="margnote">. 1735</span>

Having arrived there, he dwelt in the famous Pâ*t*ali *k*etiya <span
id="fr_675"></span>[4](#fn_675). Now this (town of Pâ*t*aliputra.md) is

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

the frontier town of Magadha, defending the outskirts of the country.
<span class="margnote">. 1736</span>

Ruling the country was a Brahman <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_676.md)
of wide renown and great learning in the scriptures (sûtras); and (there
was also) an overseer of the country, to take the omens of the land with
respect to rest or calamity. <span class="margnote">. 1737</span>

At this time the king of Magadha sent to that officer of inspection
(overseer) a messenger to warn and command him to raise fortifications
in the neighbourhood (round) of the town for its security and
protection. <span class="margnote">. 1738</span>

And now the lord of the world, as they were raising the fortifications,
predicted that in consequence of the Devas and spirits who protected and
kept (the land), the place should continue strong and free from calamity
(destruction). <span class="margnote">. 1739</span>

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

On this the heart of the overseer greatly rejoiced <span
id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_677.md), and he made religious offerings to
Buddha, the law, and the church. Buddha now leaving the city gate went
on towards the river Ganges. <span class="margnote">. 1740</span>

The overseer from his deep reverence for Buddha named the gate (through
which the lord had passed) the 'Gautama gate <span
id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_678.md).' Meanwhile the people all by the side
of the river Ganges went forth to pay reverence to the lord of the
world. <span class="margnote">. 1741</span>

They prepared for him every kind of religious offering, and each one
with his gaudy boat (decorated boat) <span
id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_679.md) invited him to cross over. The lord of
the world, considering the number of the boats, feared lest by an
appearance of partiality in accepting one, he might hurt the minds of
all the rest. <span class="margnote">. 1742</span>

Therefore in a moment by his spiritual power he transported himself and
the great congregation (across the river), leaving this shore he passed
at once to that, <span class="margnote">. 1743</span>

Signifying thereby the passage in the boat of wisdom <span
id="fr_680"></span>[4](#fn_680) (from this world to Nirvâ*n*a.md), a boat
large enough to transport all that lives (to save the world), even as
without a boat he crossed without hindrance the river (Ganges). <span
class="margnote">. 1744</span>

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

Then all the people on the bank of the river, with one voice, raised a
rapturous shout <span id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_681.md), and all declared
this ford should be called the Gautama ford. <span class="margnote">.
1745</span>

As the city gate is called the Gautama gate, so this Gautama ford is so
known through ages; and shall be so called through generations to
come <span id="fr_682"></span>[2](#fn_682.md). <span class="margnote">.
1746</span>

Then Tathâgata, going forward still, came to that celebrated Kuli <span
id="fr_683"></span>[3](#fn_683.md) village, where he preached and converted
many; again he went on to the Nâdi <span id="fr_684"></span>[4](#fn_684.md)
village, <span class="margnote">. 1747</span>

Where many deaths had occurred among the people. The friends of the dead
then came (to the lord) and asked, 'Where have our friends and relatives
deceased, now gone to be born, after this life ended <span
id="fr_685"></span>[5](#fn_685.md)?' <span class="margnote">. 1748</span>

Buddha, knowing well the sequence of deeds, answered each according to
his several case. Then going forward to Vai*s*âlî  <span
id="fr_686"></span>[6](#fn_686.md), he located himself in the Âmra
grove <span id="fr_687"></span>[7](#fn_687.md). <span class="margnote">.
1749</span>

The celebrated Lady Âmrâ, well affected to Buddha, went to that garden
followed by her waiting

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

women, whilst the children from the schools <span
id="fr_688"></span>[1](#fn_688.md) paid her respect. <span
class="margnote">. 1750</span>

Thus with circumspection and self-restraint, her person lightly and
plainly clothed, putting away all her ornamented robes and all
adornments of scent and flowers, <span class="margnote">. 1751</span>

As a prudent and virtuous woman goes forth to perform her religious
duties, so she went on, beautiful to look upon, like any Devî in
appearance. <span class="margnote">. 1752</span>

Buddha seeing the lady in the distance approaching, spake thus to all
the Bhikshus <span id="fr_689"></span>[2](#fn_689.md): 'This woman is
indeed exceedingly beautiful, able to fascinate the minds (feelings) of
the religious; <span class="margnote">. 1753</span>

'Now then, keep your recollection straight! let wisdom keep your mind in
subjection! Better fall into the fierce tiger's mouth, or under the
sharp knife of the executioner, <span class="margnote">. 1754</span>

'Than to dwell with a woman and excite in yourselves lustful thoughts. A
woman is anxious to exhibit her form and shape <span
id="fr_690"></span>[3](#fn_690.md), whether walking, standing, sitting, or
sleeping. <span class="margnote">. 1755</span>

'Even when represented as a picture, she desires most of all to set off
the blandishments of her beauty, and thus to rob men of their steadfast
heart! How then ought you to guard yourselves? <span class="margnote">.
1756</span>

'By regarding her tears and her smiles as enemies, her stooping form,
her hanging arms, and all her disentangled hair as toils designed to
entrap man's heart. <span class="margnote">. 1757</span>

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

'Then how much more (should you suspect) her studied, amorous beauty!
when she displays her dainty outline, her richly ornamented form, and
chatters gaily with the foolish man! <span class="margnote">.
1758</span>

'Ah, then! what perturbation and what evil thoughts, not seeing
underneath the horrid, tainted shape, the sorrows of impermanence, the
impurity, the unreality! <span class="margnote">. 1759</span>

'Considering these as the reality, all lustful thoughts die out; rightly
considering these, within their several limits, not even an Apsaras
would give you joy. <span class="margnote">. 1760</span>

'But yet the power of lust is great with men, and is to be feared
withal; take then the bow of earnest perseverance, and the sharp arrow
points of wisdom, <span class="margnote">. 1761</span>

'Cover your head with the helmet of right-thought, and fight with fixed
resolve against the five desires. Better far with red-hot iron pins bore
out both your eyes, <span class="margnote">. 1762</span>

'Than encourage in yourselves lustful thoughts, or look upon a woman's
form with such desires. Lust beclouding a man's heart, confused with
woman's beauty, <span class="margnote">. 1763</span>

'The mind is dazed, and at the end of life that man must fall into an
"evil way." Fear then the sorrow of that "evil way!" and harbour not the
deceits of women. <span class="margnote">. 1764</span>

'The senses not confined within due limits, and the objects of sense not
limited as they ought to be, lustful and covetous thoughts grow up
between the two, because the senses and their objects are unequally
yoked. <span class="margnote">. 1765</span>

'Just as when two ploughing oxen are yoked

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

together to one halter and cross-bar, but not together pulling as they
go, so is it when the senses and their objects are unequally matched.
<span class="margnote">. 1766</span>

'Therefore, I say, restrain the heart, give it no unbridled license.'
Thus Buddha, for the Bhikshus' sake, explained the law in various ways.
<span class="margnote">. 1767</span>

And now that Âmrâ lady gradually approached the presence of the lord;
seeing Buddha seated beneath a tree, lost in thought and wholly absorbed
by it, <span class="margnote">. 1768</span>

She recollected that he had a great compassionate heart, and therefore
she believed he would in pity receive her garden grove. With steadfast
heart and joyful mien and rightly governed feelings, <span
class="margnote">. 1769</span>

Her outward form restrained, her heart composed, bowing her head at
Buddha's feet, she took her place as the lord bade her, whilst he in
sequence right declared the law: <span class="margnote">. 1770</span>

'Your heart (O lady!) seems composed and quieted, your form without
external ornaments; young in years and rich, you seem well-talented as
you are beautiful. <span class="margnote">. 1771</span>

'That one, so gifted, should by faith be able to receive the law of
righteousness is, indeed, a rare thing in the world! The wisdom of a
master <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_691.md), derived from former
births, enables him to accept the law with joy, this is not rare; <span
class="margnote">. 1772</span>

'But that a woman, weak of will, scant in wisdom, deeply immersed in
love, should yet be able to delight in piety, this, indeed, is very
rare. <span class="margnote">. 1773</span>

'A man born in the world, by proper thought comes to delight in
goodness, he recognises the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

impermanence of wealth and beauty, and looks upon religion as his best
ornament. <span class="margnote">. 1774</span>

'He feels that this alone can remedy the ills of life and change the
fate of young and old; the evil destiny that cramps another's life
cannot affect him, living righteously; <span class="margnote">.
1775</span>

'Always removing that which excites desire, he is strong in the absence
of desire; seeking to find, not what vain thoughts suggest, but that to
which religion points him. <span class="margnote">. 1776</span>

'Relying on external help, he has sorrow; self-reliant, there is
strength and joy. But in the case of woman, from another comes the
labour, and the nurture of another's child. <span class="margnote">.
1777</span>

'Thus then should every one consider well, and loath and put away the
form of woman.' Âmrâ the lady, hearing the law, rejoiced. <span
class="margnote">. 1778</span>

Her wisdom strengthened, and still more enlightened, she was enabled to
cast off desire, and of herself dissatisfied with woman's form, was
freed from all polluting thoughts. <span class="margnote">. 1779</span>

Though still constrained to woman's form, filled with religious joy, she
bowed at Buddha's feet and spoke: 'Oh! may the lord, in deep compassion,
receive from me, though ignorant, <span class="margnote">. 1780</span>

'This offering, and so fulfil my earnest vow.' Then Buddha knowing her
sincerity, and for the good of all that lives, <span class="margnote">.
1781</span>

Silently accepted her request, and caused in her full joy, in
consequence; whilst all her friends attentive, grew in knowledge, and,
after adoration, went back home. <span class="margnote">. 1782</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_673"></span>[249:2](sbe1924.htm#fr_673.md) This lady is called
Ambapâlî, the courtezan, in the southern records.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[249:3](sbe1924.htm#fr_674.md) Pâ*t*aliputra, so
called, as it seems, from a flower, pâ*t*ali (Bignonia suaveolens). It
was otherwise called Kusumapura, 'the city of flowers.' The Palimbothra
of the Greeks, Arrian, Hist. Ind. p. 324 (ed. Gronovii); supposed to be
the modern Patna. The story found in the text, viz. that the place was
an unfortified village or frontier station of Magadha when Buddha was
seventy-nine years old, compared with the statement that in the time of
Megasthenes it was one of the largest and most prosperous towns of India
(Arrian, as above), seems to show that some considerable time had
elapsed between the Nirvâ*n*a and the period of the Greek conquest. It
is singular however (as I stated in Buddhist Pilgrims, p. lxiv) that
Fă-hien in his account of this town (cap. xxvii) makes no allusion to
the Buddhist council said to have been held there under Dharmâ*s*oka.
(For further notice of Pâ*t*aliputra, compare Sacred Books of the East,
vol. xi, pp. 16, 17; also Bigandet, p. 257, and Spence Hardy, passim.)

<span id="fn_675"></span>[249:4](sbe1924.htm#fr_675.md) There is no mention
of the Pâ*t*ali *k*etiya (unless the rest-house is the same as the
Ketiya hall) in the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, but in Bigandet, p. 257, it
is stated that the people prepared the 'dzeat,' or hall, for his use.
This 'dzeat' had been erected by <span id="page_250">p. 250</span> king
Agâta*s*atru for receiving the Li*kkh*avi princes of Vai*s*âlî, who had
come to a conference at this place to settle their affairs with the
king. This hall is probably represented at A*g*antâ, Cave xvi (see
Burgess' Report, vol. i, plate xiii, fig. 2; also Mrs. Speirs' Ancient
India, p. 197); at least it would seem so from the exact account left us
of the position Buddha took on this occasion, 'he entered the hall and
took his seat against the central pillar of the hall' (Rhys Davids and
Bigandet in loc.) Does this hall, built by king Agâta*s*atru, and called
in our text a 'Ketiya hall,' bear any resemblance to a Basilica?

<span id="fn_676"></span>[250:1](sbe1924.htm#fr_676.md) Rhys Davids (Sacred
Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 18) tells us that 'the chief magistrates
of Magadha Sunîdha and Vassakâra were building a fortress at
Pâ*t*aligâma to repel the Va*gg*ians;' I have therefore in my
translation supposed the '*k*u kwŏ' and the 'yang kwan' to be the two
officers referred to. It would seem that these titles 'ruling the
country' and 'overseer' were recognised at the time. The text, however,
would bear another translation, making the Brahman ruler the same as the
omen-taking overseer.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[251:1](sbe1924.htm#fr_677.md) The account here
given is less exact than that of the Mahâ-parinibbâna-Sutta, and it
would seem as if it were borrowed from a popular form of that work.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[251:2](sbe1924.htm#fr_678.md) This is in
agreement with the Southern account (see Rhys Davids, Sacred Books of
the East, vol. xi, p. 2 r).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[251:3](sbe1924.htm#fr_679.md) There is no mention
here made of the river being 'brimful and overflowing' as in the
Southern books, nor of the search for rafts of wood or basket-work.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[251:4](sbe1924.htm#fr_680.md) Compare the account
given by Rhys Davids (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xi, p. 21) and the
verse or song there preserved.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[252:1](sbe1924.htm#fr_681.md) Or rather 'shouted
out, "miraculous!"'

<span id="fn_682"></span>[252:2](sbe1924.htm#fr_682.md) Is there any name
corresponding to the 'Gautama' ford known near Patna?

<span id="fn_683"></span>[252:3](sbe1924.htm#fr_683.md) No doubt the same
as Ko*t*igâma (op. cit., p. 23) called Kantikama by Bigandet, p. 259.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[252:4](sbe1924.htm#fr_684.md) 'Come, Ânanda, let
us go to the villages of Nâdika,' Rhys Davids, p. 24.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[252:5](sbe1924.htm#fr_685.md) The names of the
dead are given in the Pâli; the account here is evidently an abstract
only.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[252:6](sbe1924.htm#fr_686.md) 'Come, Ânanda, let
us go on to Vesâli.' Rh. D., p. 28.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[252:7](sbe1924.htm#fr_687.md) 'And there at
Vesâli the Blessed One stayed at Ambapâlî's grove,' Rh. D., p. 28.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[253:1](sbe1924.htm#fr_688.md) So I translate
ts’iang tsin; it may mean grown-up scholars, however, or 'students.'

<span id="fn_689"></span>[253:2](sbe1924.htm#fr_689.md) This sermon against
'woman's wiles' is not found in the Pâli.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[253:3](sbe1924.htm#fr_690.md) Tsz’ t’ai, her
bewitching movements or airs.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[255:1](sbe1924.htm#fr_691.md) That is, of a man.
