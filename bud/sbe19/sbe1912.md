# KIOUEN III.

### VARGA 10. BIMBASÂRA RÂ*G*A INVITES THE PRINCE.

The royal prince departing from the court-master (i.e. the Purohita) and
the great minister, Saddharma <span id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_299.md),
keeping along <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_300.md) the stream, then
crossing the Ganges, he took the road towards the Vulture Peak <span
id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_301.md), <span class="margnote">. 777</span>

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Hidden among the five mountains <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_302.md),
standing alone a lovely peak as a roof amid (the others). The trees and
shrubs and flowers in bloom, the flowing fountains, and the cooling
rills, <span class="margnote">. 778</span>

(All these he gazed upon)--then passing on, he entered the city of the
five peaks, calm and peaceful, as one come down from heaven <span
id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_303.md). The country folk, seeing the royal
prince, his comeliness and his excessive grace, <span class="margnote">.
779</span>

Though young in years, yet glorious in his person, incomparable as the
appearance of a great master, seeing him thus, strange thoughts affected
them, as if they gazed upon the banner (curtain) of I*s*vara <span
id="fr_304"></span>[3](#fn_304.md). <span class="margnote">. 780</span>

They stayed the foot, who passed athwart the path; those hastened on,
who were behind.; those going before, turned back their heads and gazed
with earnest, wistful <span id="fr_305"></span>[4](#fn_305.md) look. <span
class="margnote">. 781</span>

The marks and distinguishing points of his person <span
id="fr_306"></span>[5](#fn_306.md), on these they fixed their eyes without
fatigue, and then approached with reverent homage, joining both their
hands in salutation: <span class="margnote">. 782</span>

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

With all there was a sense of wondrous joy, as in their several ways
they offered what they had, looking at his noble and illustrious
features; bending down their bodies <span
id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_307.md) modestly, <span class="margnote">.
783</span>

Correcting every careless or unseemly gesture, thus they showed their
reverence to him silently <span id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_308.md); those
who with anxious heart, seeking release, were moved by love, with
feelings composed bowed down the more <span
id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_309.md). <span class="margnote">. 784</span>

Great men and women, in their several engagements <span
id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_310.md), at the same time arrested on their way,
paid to his person and his presence homage: and following him as they
gazed, they went not back. <span class="margnote">. 785</span>

For the white circle between his eyebrows <span
id="fr_311"></span>[5](#fn_311.md) adorning his wide and violet
colour’d <span id="fr_312"></span>[6](#fn_312.md) eyes, his noble body
bright as gold, his pure and web-joined fingers, <span
class="margnote">. 786</span>

All these, though he were but a hermit, were marks of one who was a holy
king; and now the men and women of Râ*g*ag*ri*ha, the old and young
alike, were moved, <span class="margnote">. 787</span>

(And cried), 'This man so noble as a recluse, what common joy is this
for us <span id="fr_313"></span>[7](#fn_313.md)!' At this time Bimbasâra
Râ*g*a, placed upon a high tower of observation, <span
class="margnote">. 788</span>

Seeing all those men and women, in different ways

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

exhibiting one mark of surprise <span id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314.md),
calling before him some man outside, enquired at once the cause of it;
<span class="margnote">. 789</span>

This one bending his knee below the tower, told fully what he had seen
and heard, 'That one of the *S*âkya race, renowned of old, a prince most
excellent and wonderful, <span class="margnote">. 790</span>

'Divinely wise, beyond the way of this world, a fitting king to rule the
eight regions, now without home, is here, and all men are paying homage
to him.' <span class="margnote">. 791</span>

The king on hearing this was deeply moved at heart <span
id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315.md), and though his body was restrained, his
soul had gone <span id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_316.md). Calling his
ministers speedily before him, and all his nobles and attendants, <span
class="margnote">. 792</span>

He bade them follow secretly the (prince's) steps, to observe what
charity was given <span id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_317.md). (So in
obedience to the command) they followed and watched him steadfastly, as
with even gait and unmoved presence <span class="margnote">. 793</span>

He entered on the town and begged his food, according to the rule of all
great hermits, with joyful mien and undisturbed mind, not anxious
whether much or little alms were given; <span class="margnote">.
794</span>

Whatever he received, costly or poor, he placed within his bowl, then
turned back to the wood, and having eaten it and drank of the flowing
stream, he joyous sat upon the immaculate mountain <span
id="fr_318"></span>[5](#fn_318.md). <span class="margnote">. 795</span>

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

(There he beheld) the green trees fringing with their shade the crags,
the scented flowers growing between the intervals, whilst the peacocks
and the other birds, joyously flying, mingled their notes; <span
class="margnote">. 796</span>

His sacred garments bright and lustrous, (shone) as the sun-lit mulberry
leaves; the messengers beholding his fixed composure, one by one
(returning), reported what they had seen; <span class="margnote">.
797</span>

The king hearing it, was moved at heart, and forthwith ordered his royal
equipment to be brought, his god-like crown and his flower-bespangled
robes; then, as the lion-king, he strided forth, <span
class="margnote">. 798</span>

And choosing certain aged persons of consideration, learned men, able
calmly and wisely to discriminate, he (with them) led the way followed
by a hundred thousand people, who like a cloud ascended with the king
the royal mountain. <span class="margnote">. 799</span>

And now beholding the dignity of Bodhisattva, every outward gesture
(spring of action) under government, sitting with ease upon the mountain
crag <span id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_319.md), as the moon shining limpid
in the pure heavens, <span class="margnote">. 800</span>

So (was) his matchless beauty and purity of grace; then as the
converting presence of religion <span id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_320.md)
dwelling within the heart makes it reverential <span
id="fr_321"></span>[3](#fn_321), so (beholding him.md) he reverently
approached, <span class="margnote">. 801</span>

Even as divine *S*âkara comes to the presence of

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mo-hi-su-ma <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_322.md), so with every outward form of courtesy
and reverence <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_323.md) (the king
approached) and asked him respectfully of his welfare. <span
class="margnote">. 802</span>

Bodhisattva, answering as he was moved <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_324.md), in his turn made similar enquiries.
Then the king, the questioning over, sat down with dignity upon a
clean-faced rock. <span class="margnote">. 803</span>

And so he steadfastly beheld the divine appearance (of the prince), the
sweetness and complacency of his features <span
id="fr_325"></span>[4](#fn_325.md) revealing <span
id="fr_326"></span>[5](#fn_326.md) what his station was and high estate,
his family renown, received by inheritance, <span class="margnote">.
804</span>

The king who for a time restrained his feelings, now wishful to get rid
of doubts, (enquired) (why one) descended from the royal family of the
sun-brightness having attended to religious sacrifices thro’ ten
thousand generations, <span class="margnote">. 805</span>

Whereof the virtue had descended as his full inheritance, increasing and
accumulating until now <span id="fr_327"></span>[6](#fn_327), (why he.md)
so excellent in wisdom, so young in years, had now become a recluse,
<span class="margnote">. 806</span>

Rejecting the position of a *K*akravartin's <span
id="fr_328"></span>[7](#fn_328.md) son, begging his food, despising family
fame, his beauteous

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

form, fit for perfumes and anointings, why clothed with coarse Kasâya
garments; <span class="margnote">. 807</span>

The hand which ought to grasp the reins of empire, instead thereof,
taking its little stint of food; if indeed (the king continued) you were
not of royal descent, and would receive as an offering the transfer of
this land, <span class="margnote">. 808</span>

Then would I divide with you my empire <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md); saying this, he scarcely hoped to
excite his feelings, who had left his home and family, to be a hermit.
Then forthwith the king proceeded thus: <span class="margnote">.
809</span>

'Give just weight I pray you to my truthful words, desire for power is
kin to nobleness, and so is just pride of fame or family or wealth or
personal appearance; <span class="margnote">. 810</span>

'No longer having any wish to subdue the proud, or to bend (others) down
and so get thanks from men, it were better, then, to give to the strong
and warlike martial arms to wear, for them to follow war and by their
power to get supremacy; <span class="margnote">. 811</span>

'But when by one's own power a kingdom falls to hand, who would not then
accept the reins of empire? The wise man knows the time to take
religion, wealth, and worldly pleasure. <span class="margnote">.
812</span>

'But if he obtains not <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_330.md) the three
(or, threefold profit), then in the end he abates his earnest efforts,
and reverencing religion, he lets go material wealth. Wealth is the one
desire <span id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_331.md) of worldly men; <span
class="margnote">. 813</span>

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

'To be rich and lose all desire for religion, this is to gain but
outside wealth. But to be poor and even thus despise religion, what
pleasure can indulgence give in such a case! <span class="margnote">.
814</span>

'But when possessed of all the three, and when enjoyed with reason and
propriety, then religion, wealth, and pleasure make what is rightly
called a great master; <span class="margnote">. 815</span>

'Permit not, then, your perfectly-endowed body to lay aside (sacrifice)
its glory, without reward (merit); Mandha(ri) the *K*akravartin, as a
monarch, ruled the four empires of the world, <span class="margnote">.
816</span>

'And shared with *S*akra his royal throne, but was unequal to the task
of ruling heaven. But you, with your redoubtable strength, may well
grasp both heavenly and human power; <span class="margnote">. 817</span>

'I do not rely upon my kingly power <span
id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_332.md), in my desire to keep you here by force,
but seeing you change your comeliness of person, and wearing the
hermit's garb, <span class="margnote">. 818</span>

'Whilst it makes me reverence you for your virtue, moves me with pity
and regret for you as a man; you now go begging your food, and I offer
you (desire to offer) the whole land as yours; <span class="margnote">.
819</span>

'Whilst you are young and lusty enjoy yourself <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_333.md). During middle life acquire wealth, and
when old and all your abilities ripened, then is the time for following
the rules of religion; <span class="margnote">. 820</span>

'When young to encourage religious fervour, is to destroy the sources of
desire; but when old and

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the breath (of desire) is less eager, then is the time to seek religious
solitude; <span class="margnote">. 821</span>

'When old we should avoid, as a shame, desire of wealth, but get honour
in the world by a religious life; but when young, and the heart light
and elastic, then is the time to partake of pleasure, <span
class="margnote">. 822</span>

'In boon companionship to indulge in gaiety, and partake to the full of
mutual intercourse; but as-years creep on, giving up indulgence, to
observe the ordinances of religion, <span class="margnote">. 823</span>

'To mortify the five desires, and go on increasing a joyful and
religious heart, is not this the law of the eminent kings of old, who as
a great company paid worship to heaven, <span class="margnote">.
824</span>

'And borne on the dragon's back, received the joys of celestial abodes?
All these divine and victorious monarchs, glorious in person, richly
adorned, <span class="margnote">. 825</span>

'Thus having as a company performed their religious offering, in the end
received the reward of their conduct in heaven.' Thus Bimbasâra Râ*g*a
(used) every kind of winning expedient in argument; <span
class="margnote">. 826</span>

The royal prince unmoved and fixed remained firm as Mount Sumeru.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_299"></span>[111:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_299.md) Saddharma may be
the name of the minister, or it may be rendered 'the great minister of
the true law,' i.e. of religion.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[111:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_300.md) For the symbol
<span id="img_11100"></span> ![](img/11100.jpg) I have substituted <span
id="img_11101"></span> ![](img/11101.jpg) 'to go towards.' The whole
line may be translated 'following the turbulent (streams) he crossed the
Ganges,' in this case <span id="img_11102"></span> ![](img/11102.jpg)
would be for <span id="img_11103"></span> ![](img/11103.jpg). But the
sentence is obscure, as 'lang tsai' may be a proper name.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[111:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_301.md) The distance from
the place of the interview with the ministers to the Vulture Peak would
be in a straight line about 150 miles. In the Southern books
(Nidâna-kathâ; Buddhist Birth Stories, by Mr. Rhys Davids, pp. 85 and 87
n.) it is said that from Kapilavastu to the River Anomâ, near which the
interview took place, is thirty yo*g*anas; this is greatly in excess of
the real distance, which is about thirty-three miles, or five yo*g*anas.
Then again from the Anomâ River, or the village of Maneya (Mhaniya),
where the Bodhisattva halted (see Romantic Legend of Buddha, p. 140, and
compare vol. xii, plate viii, Archæological Survey of India), to
Râ*g*ag*ri*ha by way of Vai*s*âlî would not be more than 180 miles, so
that the whole distance from Kapilavastu (assuming Bhuila to represent
this old town) would be about 215 miles, or about thirty yo*g*anas.
Hence we assume that the thirty yo*g*anas of the Southern account is
intended to represent the entire distance from Kapilavastu, and not from
the River Anomâ. Mr. Rhys Davids supposes the distance from Kapilavastu
to Râ*g*ag*ri*ha (viâ Vai*s*alî) to be sixty yo*g*anas (loc. cit. Birth
Stories). In the Southern account the journey from the Anomâ to
Râ*g*ag*ri*ha is described as having been accomplished in one day.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[112:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_302.md) The five mountains,
viz., which surrounded Râ*g*ag*ri*ha, see Fah-hian, p. 112 n. The text
seems to imply that the Vulture Peak towered above the others, but its
base was hidden among the five.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[112:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_303.md) As a Deva, outside
(heaven).

<span id="fn_304"></span>[112:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_304.md) The banner of
I*s*vara (Indra) is frequently represented in Buddhist sculptures. There
is a pleasing figure of it in Mrs. Speir's Ancient India, p. 230; see
also Tree and Serpent Worship, plate xxxviii and elsewhere.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[112:4](sbe1912.htm#fr_305.md) Unsatisfied look,
that is, constant or fixed gaze.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[112:5](sbe1912.htm#fr_306.md) The marks and
distinguishing points are the signs to be found on the person of one
destined to be a Buddha. In the text the expression 'on the four limbs'
means 'on the body.'

<span id="fn_307"></span>[113:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_307.md) Their different
bodies, or forms.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[113:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_308.md) Silently they added
their respectful homage.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[113:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_309.md) These lines seem to
refer to the ease of mind given to the care-worn by the presence of
Bodhisattva.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[113:4](sbe1912.htm#fr_310.md) Whether engaged on
public or private affairs; so at least the text seems to mean, <span
id="img_11300"></span> ![](img/11300.jpg).

<span id="fn_311"></span>[113:5](sbe1912.htm#fr_311.md) That is, the urna,
or circle of hair, supposed to be on the forehead of every great man.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[113:6](sbe1912.htm#fr_312.md) The colour is
indefinite blue-like; compare the Greek κύανος.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[113:7](sbe1912.htm#fr_313.md) That is, 'what an
occasion for uncommon joy is this!'

<span id="fn_314"></span>[114:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_314.md) Scared in different
ways, assuming one attitude, or unvarying attitude; the line simply
means they all showed the same indication of astonishment.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[114:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_315.md) Rejoiced with fear,
or with astonishment.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[114:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_316.md) His body held (to
the place), his soul (shin) had already hastened, i.e. to the spot where
Bodhisattva was.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[114:4](sbe1912.htm#fr_317.md) Or, what religious
offering should be made.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[114:5](sbe1912.htm#fr_318.md) The White Mountain,
meaning probably the Royal Mountain.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[115:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_319.md) On the lofty abode
of the mountain (peak).

<span id="fn_320"></span>[115:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_320.md) This expression is
singular, it will hear no other translation than this, 'the converting
body (or, presence) of the law, i.e. religion.'

<span id="fn_321"></span>[115:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_321.md) Or, causes
reverence (on the part of the beholder).

<span id="fn_322"></span>[116:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_322.md) Probably the symbol
ma is here used for va, in which case the name would be restored to
Mâhe*s*vara.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[116:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_323.md) It is difficult to
render such passages as this literally, but it might be translated thus,
'With collected air and every mark of decorum.'

<span id="fn_324"></span>[116:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_324.md) That is, according
to the circumstances of the enquiry.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[116:4](sbe1912.htm#fr_325.md) The sweet
expression blended with a joyfulness of countenance.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[116:5](sbe1912.htm#fr_326.md) Or it may be
rendered, 'Correctly hearing his name and high degree,' as though one of
the king's attendants had whispered the name and family of Bodhisattva
in his ear.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[116:6](sbe1912.htm#fr_327.md) Largely possessed
(or, collected) in his own person.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[116:7](sbe1912.htm#fr_328.md) Son of a holy king.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[117:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_329.md) The absence of
covetousness in Bimbasâra has passed into a proverb or a typical
instance in Buddhist literature. (Compare A*s*vaghosha's Sermons,
passim.)

<span id="fn_330"></span>[117:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_330.md) If he desires not
to possess the three, that is, wealth, pleasure, religion.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[117:3](sbe1912.htm#fr_331.md) Wealth affects
(makes) all men of the world.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[118:1](sbe1912.htm#fr_332.md) That is, I do not
command you as a king, but desire you to share my kingly power.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[118:2](sbe1912.htm#fr_333.md) Receive the
pleasure of the five enjoyments (of sense), i.e. the indulgence of the
five senses.
