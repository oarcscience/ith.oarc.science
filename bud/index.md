#### Jataka

The Jataka is a huge collection of fables framed as previous
incarnations of the Buddha, many of which either have parallels or
derivatives in western folklore and literature. Although the Jataka is
not considered part of the canonical Buddhist scripture, it is very
popular. Each tale usually has a concise moral, and the entire
collection is a browsers' delight.
