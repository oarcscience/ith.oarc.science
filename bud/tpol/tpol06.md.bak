### CHAPTER III

### TAKING THE THOUGHT OF ENLIGHTENMENT (11)

<span class="smallcaps">I rejoice</span> exceedingly in all creatures’
good works that end the sorrows of their evil lot; may the sorrowful
find happiness! I rejoice in the deliverance of embodied beings from the
griefs of life's wanderings, and in the Sonship of Enlightenment, and
the Enlightenment, that belongs to the Saviours. I rejoice in the
Commanders’ (12) oceans of Thought, that bring happiness and establish
welfare for all creatures. With clasped hands .I entreat the perfectly
Enlightened Ones who stand in all regions that they kindle the lamp of
the Law for them who in their blindness fall into sorrow. With clasped
hands I pray the Conquerors who yearn for the Stillness (13) that they
abide here for endless æons, lest this world become blind. In reward for
all this righteousness that I have won by my works I would fain become a
soother of all the sorrows of all creatures. May I be a balm to the
sick, their healer and servitor, until sickness come

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

never again; may I quench with rains of food and drink the anguish of
hunger and thirst; may I be in the famine of the ages’ end their drink
and meat; may I become an unfailing store for the poor, and serve them
with manifold things for their need. My own being and my pleasures, all
my righteousness in the past, present, and future I surrender
indifferently, that all creatures may win to their end. The Stillness
lies in surrender of all things, and my spirit is fain for the.
Stillness; if I must surrender all, it is best to give it for
fellow-creatures. I yield myself to all living things to deal with me as
they list; they may smite or revile me for ever, bestrew me with dust,
play with my body, laugh and wanton; I have given them my body, why
shall I care? Let them make me do whatever works bring them pleasure;
but may never mishap befall any of them by reason of me. If the spirit
of any be wroth or pleased with mc, may that be ever a cause for them to
win all their desires. May all who slander me, or do me hurt, or jeer at
me, gain a share in Enlightenment. I would be a protector of the
unprotected, a guide of wayfarers, a ship, a dyke, and a bridge for them
who seek the further Shore; a lamp for them who need a lamp, a bed for
them who need a bed, a stave for all beings who need a slave. I would be
a magic gem, a lucky jar, a spell of power, a sovereign balm, a
wishing-tree, a cow of plenty (14), for

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

embodied beings. As the earth and other elements are for the various
service of the countless creatures dwelling in the whole of space, so
may I in various wise support the whole sphere of life lodged in space,
until all be at peace. As the Blessed of old took the Thought of
Enlightenment and held fast to the rule for Sons of Enlightenment in the
order thereof, so do I frame the Thought of Enlightenment for the weal
of the world, and so will I observe these rules in their sequence.

When he has thus taken the Thought of Enlightenment in a spirit of
grace, the sage must fill his thought with gladness in order to
strengthen the issue. This day my birth is fruitful, my human life a
blessing; this day have I been born in the race of the Enlightened, now
am I their son. And henceforth mine is the task of them who work
worthily of their race, lest any blemish fall upon this stainless stock.
This Thought of Enlightenment has arisen within me I know not how, even
as a gem might be gotten by a blind man from a dunghill; it is an elixir
made to destroy death in the world, an unfailing treasure to relieve the
world's poverty, a supreme balm to allay the world's sickness, a tree
under which may rest all creatures wearied with wandering over life's
paths, a bridge open to all wayfarers for passing over hard ways, a moon
of thought arising to cool the fever of the world's sin, a great

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

sun driving away the gloom of the world's ignorance, a fresh butter
created by the churning of the milk of the Good Law. For the caravan of
beings who wander through life's paths hungering to taste of happiness
this banquet of bliss is prepared, that will satisfy all creatures
coming to it. I summon to-day the world to the estate of Enlightenment,
and meanwhile to happiness; may gods, dæmons, and other beings rejoice
in the presence of all the Saviours!
