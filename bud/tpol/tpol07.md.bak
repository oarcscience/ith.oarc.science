### CHAPTER IV

### HEEDFULNESS IN THE THOUGHT OF ENLIGHTENMENT

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> son of the Conqueror, who has thus
firmly laid hold of the Thought of Enlightenment, must constantly strive
without slackening to observe the rule. If a work be undertaken in haste
and without right reflection, one may well consider whether it should be
done or no, oven though a vow have been made; but how should I delay in
this work, which has been perpended by the Enlightened Ones, by their
most sage Sons, and by me likewise according to the measure of my power?
If I fulfil not my vow by deeds, I shall be false to all beings, and
what a fate will be mine! Even of a small matter it is said that he who
gives not what he has purposed in thought to give becomes a tortured
ghost; how, then, shall it be with him who proffers aloud and earnestly
the gift of supreme happiness? I shall be false to all the world, and
what a fate will be mine! . . .

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

Therefore I must heedfully fulfil my vow; if I labour not this very day,
down, down I fall. Numberless are the Enlightened who have passed by in
search of all living beings; and through my own fault I have not conic
into their healing hands. If this day also I shall be as I have been
again and again, misery, sickness, death, maiming, dismemberment, and
the like will fall to my lot; and when shall I win that most rare boon,
the coming of one of the Enlightened, faith, human birth, and fitness to
labour in righteousness, a day of health with food and no vexations?
Life is a brief instant, and plays us false; the body is like a thing
held in precarious tenure. Truly with deeds such as mine have been I
shall not again win human birth; and if I win it not, evil awaits me;
whence should good come? Since I work not righteousness when I am able,
how shall I do it when crazed by the pains of hell? I do no righteous
work, and gather sin; the very name of good destiny is lost to me for
millions of æons, Therefore the Lord has said that human birth is
exceedingly hard to win; hard as for a turtle to pass its neck into the
hole of a yoke in the ocean. . . .

I have found this most rare sphere of weal (15), I know not how; and
shall I with open eyes suffer myself to be borne back to these hells? My
thought cannot grasp it; like one who is driven mad by spells, I know
not by whom I

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

am crazed or who possesses me. My foes, Desire, Hate, and their kindred,
are handless and footless, they are neither valiant nor cunning; how can
they have enslaved me? But they dwell in my spirit, and there at their
ease smite me. And withal I am not wroth with them; fie on my unseemly
long-suffering! If all gods and mankind were my foes, they could not
drag me to the fire of the hell Avīchī; but into this flame, at the
touch whereof not even ashes would remain of Meru (16), these mighty
enemies the Passions hurl me in an instant. No other foes have life so
long as the beginningless, endless, everlasting life of my enemies the
Passions. All beings may be turned by submission to kindness; but these
Passions become all the more vexatious by my submission. Then whilst
these everlasting foes, sole source of the birth of the floods of
sorrow, are dwelling in. my heart, how can I fearlessly rejoice in the
life of the flesh? Whence can I have happiness, if these warders of the
prison-house of existence, ay, these torturers of the damned in hell and
elsewhere, lodge in the house of my spirit, in the bower of my desire?
Then I will not lay down my burden until these foes be smitten before my
eyes. Men of lofty spirit are stirred to wrath against even a mean
offender, and sleep not until they have smitten him. They rage in the
forefront of battle, furious, heeding not the anguish of wounds from
arrows and javelins, to

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

strike fiercely at the poor creatures doomed by nature to death, and
turn not away until they have fulfilled their purpose. How then, and for
what reason, should I, who have set myself to strike down these natural
foes, the constant causes of ail miseries, sink down in base despair,
even for hundreds of disasters? Men bear on their limbs, like ornaments,
meaningless scars gotten from their enemies; why should sufferings
overcome me, who am labouring to accomplish a lofty end? Setting their
thoughts upon their mere livelihood, fishers, Chaṇḍālas, husbandman, and
the like bear the miseries of cold, heat, and the rest; why should not I
suffer them for the weal of the world?

Ah, when I vowed to deliver all beings within the hounds of space in its
ten points (17) from the Passions, I myself had not won deliverance
froth the Passions. Knowing not my now measure, I spoke like a madman..
Then I will never turn back from smiting the Passions. I will grapple
with them, will wrathfully make war on them all except the passion that
makes for the destruction of the Passions. Though my bowels ooze out and
my head fall off, I will nowise abase myself before my foes the
Passions. An enemy, though driven away, may establish himself in another
spot, whence he may return with gathered powers; but such is not the way
of the enemy Passion. Where can this dweller in my

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

spirit go when I cast him out; where can he stand, to labour for my
destruction? It is only that I—fool that I am—make no effort; the
miserable Passions are to he overcome by the vision of wisdom. The
Passions lie not in the objects of sense, nor in the sense-organs, nor
between them, nor elsewhere; where do they lie? And yet they disturb the
whole world

They are but a phantom. Then cast away thy heart's terror, and labour
for wisdom; why shouldst thou vainly torture thyself in hell? Thus
resolved, I will strive to fulfil the rule as it has been taught; how
should he who needs medicine find healing, if he depart from the
physician's command?
