### <span class="smallcaps">Chapter XIV.</span>

### *After Justification*.

(§ 71, 72, 73, 74, 75)

We have now reached that portion of the Shinshu Catechism which deals
with *Zokutaimon*, i.e. with the earthly life of the believer after he
has received justification by Faith in Amida, has cast all his cares
upon Him, and has entered into the Sacred Heart of Buddha. We shall find
it necessary to consider many questions relating to Grace and
Sanctification, and again we shall be astonished by the similarities
between the Shinshu and the Christian systems of Theology.

And first, let me summarize what I have been taught, as a Christian,
concerning God's grace. It will enable me to describe more accurately
the Shinshu position.

Grace consists in the direct illumination of the mind, and the
inspiration of the will, by God. <span id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_92.md) It
is necessary for all good actions: it is indispensible to the just man,
because, without it, he cannot persevere in the state of grace, or work
out his own salvation: it is equally necessary to the man outside the
covenant of grace, because, without it, he can not only not turn to the
safe refuge of religion, but cannot even do any action that is good. All
that is ethically good in human life comes through the grace of God. But
the grace of God is over all his works:

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

there is not one that is excluded from it. It is God's spiritual
sunshine that gives light to the just as well as to the unjust. It is
not limited to priests and monks, nor to that class of people whom the
Japanese call *Shūkyōka* (religiously minded persons): it illuminates
and inspires the statesman in his cabinet, the merchant at his desk, the
carpenter in his workshop: it is the inner soul (as it were) of all good
actions, secular as well as religious, and there is no man, be he the
most despicable of creatures, who does anything in accordance with the
promptings of God's grace, that shall fail to receive from the all-just
tribunal of Heaven his due meed of praise and encouragement. If I may
express myself in Buddhist terminology, the grace of God is the source
(the *in* \#) of all good karma. <span id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md)

Turning now to the *Shinshu Hyakuwa*, I find (in § 71) that the earthly
life of a believer after receiving the Believing Heart may be compared
to a day spent on the road along which one travels to enter into the
full happiness of the Fruits of Enlightenment. (*Shinjin wo etaru ue no
jinsei-seikwatsu wa, Bukkwa no kōfuku ni iru dōchū no hi-okuri de
arimasu*).

The travellers along this road dwell continually in the Glory of Mida's
Light ("One the Light of

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God's own
Presence, O’er His ransomed People shed"); and they are continually
under the protection of all "gods, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas," the
beings who hold in the Buddhist mind a place analogous to that occupied
in the Christian system by ministering angels forth sent to minister to
the heirs of salvation. The consequence of the clear light in which they
dwell is that they are able to estimate rightly the importance of human
virtue, that they set their minds to becoming active promoters of the
peaceful welfare of society, rightly deeming that social duties are so
important and weighty in their nature that the believer cannot afford to
neglect them. This state of mind is that which is known in the Shinshu
theology as *Zokutaimon*—the frame of mind which enables a man to
discharge his duty towards his neighbour.

In the succeeding paragraph (§ 72) we are brought to the question of
works done before justification. The *Zokutaimon*, we are asked, is it
something that is obligatory upon a man *before* he receives the
justifying faith in Amida, or is it merely something to be done after
justification?

The author begins with a somewhat suggestive expression. *Shin wo ete
hajimete Shinshu no* <span class="smallcaps">utsuwa</span> *to naru no
desu*. " It is not until a man has received faith that he becomes a
<span class="smallcaps">vessel</span>, of the Shinshu." There is a sort
of Pauline echo about the phrase which is not without
significance. <span id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md) Before

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

the acceptance of faith a man cannot be said to be *Shinshugyōja*, a
practising believer of the Shinshu Faith. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[\*](#fn_95.md) The *Zokutaimon* of the Shinshu Faith is
therefore, properly speaking, an obligation which does not come into
full force until a man has definitely accepted the Faith in Amida as
laid down in the *Shintaimon* portion of the Shinshu creed.

Still, we are told, there are men who are within (*kamei* \# *suru*) the
fold (*hani* \#) of the Shinshu, who have not yet made a personal
acceptance of the faith upon which the Shinshu system is based, just as
there are amongst ourselves persons who by Infant Baptism have entered
into the congregation of Christ's Church without any very definite
heart-acceptance of their Christian privilege. For such persons, because
they belong to the Shinshu, it is more than expedient that they should
understand and practise the religious obligations of life. It is a most
important religious principle that, so long as men have to be in the
world, they should do their duties as citizens of the world, and these
duties ought not to be shirked as indifferent, even though a man have
not yet received the grace of a Saving Faith. (*Koto ni seken futsu no
seikwatsu ni majiwarite tsutawaru shūfū* \# *de aru kara, nao nao mishin
no aida wa dō de mo yoi to iu wake de wa arimasenu*.)

The next paragraph (§ 73) treats of the authorities that may be quoted
for this view of the *Zokutaimon*. It need not delay us here, it is
fully treated of

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

in *Shinshu Seikun*, and seems to have only an academic interest.

In § 78, the question is asked, if we may look upon the duties of the
*Zokutaimon* as being natural obligations, or merely as voluntary
duties, binding upon such men only as have made some sort of profession
of religion. And to this the answer is, that whilst certain of the
duties in this section are indeed nothing but natural duties, incumbent
on all men as members of human society, there are certain others which
concern believers only. These may be summed up in the one word *hō-on*,
\#, a phrase to be more fully discussed in our next chapter. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md)

This section of the Catechism, (for Mr. Nishimoto now goes off into a
consideration of the *hō on*,) closes with a warning against spiritual
pride. (§ 75).

It is customary, in some sects of Buddhism, to give to men who have a
peculiar reputation for sanctity, certain distinguishing titles such as
"living Buddha," &c, &c. Mr. Nishimoto has already in § 70 given us some
of these distinguishing names and titles of honour. Here he gives us two
more, *Shōjōjū*, and *Zennin*, <span id="fr_97"></span>[†](#fn_97.md)
"righteous man," and again

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

reiterates the warning against presumption or pride.

We must not expect, we are told, that the acceptance of Faith will work
any outward change in us, either in our body, or in our life. Still
there will be a change. When we have made the surrender of Faith, a
living Fire has been kindled in our hearts, and the flames of Faith
within will show themselves in the smoke of Conduct without (*shin-kwa
uchi ni areba, gyō-en hoka ni arawaru*). We live in Amida's light as in
an Ocean, and Amida's light dwells in us, and the consequence of this
interpenetration, an idea not unknown to the Christian, is that, whether
we try to be such or not, we are lights shining in the world (*shizen to
tokkō no kagayaki ga gozaimasu*. cf. Phil ii. 15). As men, living among
men, we have a variety of duties to perform, and are brought into
multitudinous relationships with our fellow creatures, which we cannot
shirk or escape from. But these responsibilities are not peculiar to
ourselves. We share them with all our fellow-men, and this thought
should keep us humble.

At the same time, it should be added, for our encouragement, when we
look at the inner man of him that has accepted the principle of Faith,
we find there a happiness and a peace, such as one who has not yet
believed cannot possibly understand. That internal happiness and peace
will necessarily show itself in the quiet, peaceful strength that will
characterize our daily lives. <span id="fr_98"></span>[\*](#fn_98.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[109:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_92.md) Gratia actualis
consistit in immediatā mentis illustratione atque inspiratione
voluntatis immediatā. Hurter, Theologiae Dogmaticae Compendium vol. iii
p. 11.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[110:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_93.md) There are some good
actions which are not done in obedience to the dictates of God's grace.
Some are done from pride, others from a [hypocritical](errata.htm#12.md)
desire to stand well in the sight of men. Such actions are only
apparently good, and of these we can say that they have in them the
"nature of sin." But I am not talking of these. I am thinking of the
honestly good actions of men who have not yet attained to
"justification" by faith in the One Saviour.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[111:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_94.md) The Japanese word
*utsuwa* is the equivalent of the Greek word σκευος and is used in the
Japanese versions of Rom ix. 22, both in the Protestant version and in
that used in the Greek Church. I have not yet seen the new translation
(now in print) of the Roman Catholics.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[112:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_95.md) One frequently hears
among Roman Catholics phrases like, 'il est catholique mais il ne
pratique pas': i.e. he is not a *gyōja*.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[113:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_96.md) I may, however,
briefly state here that the obvious Greek translation for *hō on* is
Eucharistia, and that the attitude of the Shinshu mind after having made
the act of Faith, may be most fitly described in the words of St Paul,
Eph. v. 20.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[113:†](sahw16.htm#fr_97.md) But see the quotation
from Nanjo given in the note at the end of Chapt. vii. One of these
titles, *Daitoku* (\#) "great virtue," though not mentioned by Mr.
Nishimoto, is historically interesting. One of the Tang Emperors,
Taitsung, in 972, appointed ten Daitoku to superintend all the clergy of
all sorts in his capital. Some of the Daitoku were undoubtedly
Buddhists, but the title is also given to Olopen, the leader of the
Nestorians, on the memorial erected a year or two later.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[114:\*](sahw16.htm#fr_98.md) In the light of the
historical discussion to be found in the Appendix, it is possible that
*Shintaimon* and *Zokutaimon* may represent the distinction made between
the "Perfect" and the "Hearers" in Manichaeism.
