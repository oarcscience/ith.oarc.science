### *The Shinshu in its relations to S’akyamuni and to Buddhism in general*.

(§§ 1–17.) <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

The Shinshu claims to be a Buddhistic sect.—Buddhism, as a religion,
presupposes no creator, only a Law of Cause and Effect which has always
worked inexorably as far as human thought can carry us backwards, a Law
through the operations of which all the worlds comprising the universe
have been evolved out of the original chaos of matter (Jap. *Shinnyo*
Skt. *Būtatathāta*), and brought to their present state of growth,
decay, or ruin.

The Founder of Buddhism is the Buddha S’akyamuni whose death may be
placed about the year 480 B. C. The religion reached Japan, officially,
by way of Central Asia, China, and Corea, about the middle of the sixth
century A.D. About a thousand years had thus elapsed from the Nirvāna of
S’akyamuni to the time when Buddhism first reached these shores. In the
course of these centuries it had become one of the most stupendous
systems of religious teaching that the world has ever seen. Its sacred
books numbered over six thousand volumes: the articles in its creed were
described as being 81,000 in number, and the whole system was aptly

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

compared to an immense pharmacopœa, in which were to be found drugs and
prescriptions for every one of the spiritual troubles of mankind
(including toothache and the teething of children). <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) No physician ever came across all human
diseases in the course of his practice, or had occasion to try all
drugs: no religious teacher ever had to deal with all forms of ignorance
and sin, or to provide remedies suitable for each case. The utmost that
any teacher of Buddhism can do is to draw from this vast storehouse a
few doctrines that seem most suitable for the wants of those with whom
he has to deal, and to formulate for himself a particularized system
which may lie wholly within the confines of Buddhism, and yet scarcely
touch any one of the sister systems formulated, within the Buddhist
sphere, by other minds.

Hence, almost from the very commencement, Buddhism has been a religion
with many (and occasionally diametrically opposite) doctrines, erected,
from time to time, into conflicting sects and denominations.

We may pass over the Indian and Chinese sects, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[†](#fn_9.md) which have now none but an antiquarian
value. All that has come in the way of denominationalism from India to
Japan is the division into the three vehicles, or *yānas* <span
id="fr_10"></span>[‡](#fn_10.md) as they are called. Shinshu

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

claims to belong to the last and truest of these, to the *Real
Mahāyāna*, which has satisfactorily solved the problem of making the
personal experience of the individual believer serve for the salvation
of others.

Again, if we contemplate the Supreme, whether by that we mean an
individual personal God or an impersonal principle, we shall at once
recognize, as indispensible attributes, the existence in Him (or It) of
Mercy and Wisdom. The Supreme without these two attributes is
unthinkable to the mind of civilized man. Moreover, Mercy and Wisdom are
not merely attributes of God, they are also avenues by which we can
approach Him. Buddhism professes to have two gates by which we may touch
the Supreme, the Gate of Wisdom, and the Gate of Mercy. It professes
philosophical teachings whereby man is taught to know, see, understand,
all the Wisdom that there is in the Supreme; it has also a Gate of
Mercy, through which the Mercy and Love of the Supreme flows into man's
heart to soften and purify it. The Shinshu teaches its disciples to
enter Heaven by the Gate of Mercy. It is pietistic <span
id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) rather than philosophical.

But there are two ways of entering even at the Gate of Mercy. We may try
to enter in on the strength of our own merits, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[†](#fn_12.md) and claim the clemency

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of Heaven as a reward for the good deeds and holy actions that we have
done ourselves This is known in Japanese as *shōdō*, the "holy path,"
and is the path generally taught by Buddhist sects. But Buddhism (in
Japan at any rate) speaks also of another way by which the gate may be
entered. It tells of a Saviour who has entered for us, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) who has smoothed the path, and prepared
the mansion, and now calls us to the Paradise of Bliss. This is called
in *Jōdo mon*, the Gate that leads to Paradise, and it is to this Gate
that the Shinshu believer is taught to direct his footsteps.

Again, a man may enter the Gate that leads to Paradise by faith in the
Saviour who calls him to come that way, and yet find room in his heart
to give worship and reverence to other Buddhas, Saints, and deities.
Other Jōdo sects may do this, <span id="fr_14"></span>[†](#fn_14.md) but
the Shinshuist knows (or professes to know) no Saviour but Amida, whom
alone he worships with his whole heart.

Similarly, a man may say; "It is true that I am saved by faith, but my
faith in Amida cannot set me free from obedience to the wise rules laid
down by S’akyamuni for the guidance of his disciples." <span
id="fr_15"></span>[‡](#fn_15.md) So he abstains from meat and worldly
amusements, abjures marriage and lives in a monastery. "But,"

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

says the Shinshuist, in reply, "the Truth is not so. If I am saved by
Faith, the Law becomes of none effect. If Amida saves me through His
merits only, then my actions come to be of infinitely small importance,
Neither what I eat, nor my attitude towards marriage, nor anything of
this kind can possibly affect my eternal salvation." So the Shinshu
believer, clerical or lay, lives as a citizen of the world, eats as his
neighbours eat, marries like them and rears up children, and says that
the home and not the monastery is the focus of the religious life.

It follows from all this that the attitude of the Shinshu towards
S’akyamuni himself has been radically modified. Alone among the sects of
Buddhism, the Shinshu offers no worship to the Founder of the Buddhist
religion, not even that limited worship which it renders to Shōtoku
Taishi, to Shinran himself, and to a few quite unknown Japanese
worthies. <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md) "The only reason," says
Shinran, in a poem <span id="fr_17"></span>[†](#fn_17.md) to which his
followers pay peculiar reverence, "the only reason why S’akyamuni
appeared on earth was that he might make known to men the Great Saving
Vow of Amitābha." And Amida, the Father, the Eternal Being, who
originated the Law

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of Cause and Effect, <span id="fr_18"></span>[\*](#fn_18.md) has, by his
Vow for the Salvation of Men by Faith alone quite regardless of their
merits, so profoundly modified the working of that Law, that it really
seems doubtful whether the definition of Buddhism with which we started
really holds good for the Shinshu, or whether we ought not to place the
Shinshu in a category by itself as a quasi-Buddhist religion which
contains in it elements which are apparently not of Buddhist origin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[9:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_7.md) The reference is to the
paragraphs in *Shinshu Hyakuwa*.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[10:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_8.md) Nanjo's Cat. of the
Tripitaka actually gives the names of Sūtras containing remedies and
charms for these ailments.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[10:†](sahw04.htm#fr_9.md) I refer to the numerous
Hinayāna Sects in existence about the commencement of the Christian era.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[10:‡](sahw04.htm#fr_10.md) The author of the
Saddharmapundarika Sūtra speaks of three yānas or vehicles. 1. That of
the *Arhats* (Hinayāna) which only talked of the Salvation of the
Individual himself. <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> 2. That of Pratyeka
Buddhas (apparent Mahāyāna—*Gondaijō*) which enabled a man to reach
Enlightenment (more than Salvation) but only for the Individual. 3. That
of the Bodhisattva, or true Mahāyāna (*Jitsudaijō*) which taught the
believer to use his Enlightenment for the benefit of his
fellow-creatures.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[11:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_11.md) *Shūkyōteki* as
opposed to *gakumonteki*.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[11:†](sahw04.htm#fr_12.md) Jap. *jiriki*.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[12:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_13.md) Hence the words
*tariki*, "another man's efforts," or *igyō*.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[12:†](sahw04.htm#fr_14.md) Such sects are known as
*Hōbenmon:* sects which adapt their teaching and rites to the weakness
and prejudices of their followers. As opposed to such sects the Shinshu
profess to be the *Shinjitsumon* or True Gate.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[12:‡](sahw04.htm#fr_15.md) To the Shinshuist all
the laws of the ancient Vinaya discipline are *Hōben*, "accommodations."

<span id="fn_16"></span>[13:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_16.md) The so-called
*Zenchishiki* or "righteous and wise men" of Shinshu. It is noteworthy
while the worship of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is like the false
Angel-worship against which St. Paul warns us, the honour now paid by
the Shinshu to their *Zenchishiki* is like the commemoration of good men
which has always obtained in the Christian Church.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[13:†](sahw04.htm#fr_17.md) The *Shōshinge* of
which a translation will be found later in this book.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[14:\*](sahw04.htm#fr_18.md) Rev. K. Tada,
Shōshinge Kōwa. p. 74. (*Nyorai wa*) kono sekai no yorodzu no mono wo
suburu tame ni innengwa no taihō wo sadame, go-jishin mata kono taihō ni
yotte arawase tamai, kono taihō ni yotte sono issai no hataraki wo
shimeshi tamau no de arimasu. "In order that he might regulate all
things in the world, he established the law of cause and effect,
manifested himself, too, in accordance with this great law, and by it
manifests (to the world) all his operations." This comes very near the
acknowledgement of a First Cause.
