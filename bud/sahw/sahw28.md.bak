### APPENDIX II.

### *Manichaean influences in the Shinshu*.

There are good grounds for affirming that Zendō was acquainted with
Manichaeanism and that he borrowed some parts of his system, at least,
from that religion.

\(i\) Zendō is said to have investigated the teachings of the White
Lotus Society, which had been founded by Eon (Hui-yin) two and a half
centuries before his time, i. e. about A.D. 380, and therefore prior to
Vasubandhu's time (A.D. 450). The White Lotus Society is spoken of by
Buddhists in Japan as having been the first beginning of the formal and
organized worship of Amida (See. e. g. Murakami): but Dèvéria in Journal
Asiatique, Ser. ix. vol. x. p. 461, quotes from a Chinese work to the
effect that it was a form of Manichaeism. It is to be noticed, however,
that Eon is not reckoned by the Shinshuists as one of the patriarchs of
their faith.

\(ii\) The same author shows that Manichaean Temples are mentioned as
existing in Singanfu in the years 510 (?), 621, 631, 760, being known
successively as Tenji, Taishinji, and, finally, as Dai-un Kōmyōji.
[Manichaeanism](errata.htm#22.md) must therefore have been quite as
prominently before Zendō's mind as Nestorianism, and the name of Kōmyōji
seems almost conclusive proof of a Manichaean affiliation.

\(iii\) There are many points in Manichaeanism which are reproduced in
Amidaism especially in. Zendō's activities; e. g. the dislike of
marriage, the

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

refusal to send for doctors (Cf. *jisetsu tōrai*), the vigorous
abstinence from meat which Zendō preached; the belief that the devotee
would cease from all further transmigrations, and go at death, straight
to the paradise beyond, without needing to make supplication to Buddha.
Also the belief that salvation has nothing to do with morals (*akunin
shōki*), but only with faith.

On the other hand it must be observed:—

\(a\) That many of the above points are to be found in other sects of
Japanese Buddhism. Besides the above, it may be observed that Nichiren
(see Seigoroku. p. 64) mentions Mani by name as a great sage, that he
speaks of those who invoke Mahes’vara (according to Dévéria, a very
Manichaean devotion) and classifies them as heretics equally with those
who invoke Amida, though without identifying the two (see Seigoroku. pp.
97. 622); and finally that the prohibition of the seven pungent herbs
(\#), which is essentially Manichaean, is found is many sects. (See
*Bukkyō Kyōmon Kaitōshu* vol. iii. p. 239). There are also many sects in
Japan which have adopted the dualistic Principle (\#) of *yō* (\#) and
*in* (\#) which is common both to Manichaeism and to its parent
religion, Zoroastrianism.

And (b), whatever may be said of the other sects of Amidaism, it is
clear that Shinshuism has discarded all or almost all the Manichaean
elements mentioned above, and reformed itself in every instance in what
may be termed a Christian direction. It allows marriage, it permits the
eating of meat and of pungent herbs. It does not teach Dualism, unless
it be that the distinction between

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shinnyo and Mumyō
(\#) constitutes Dualism: it has scotched, though not killed, the
*akunin shōki* theory, for which it has invented a new explanation, and
no Shinshuist to day would hesitate about sending for a doctor if he
were unwell. Hōnen (Genkū) may have been a Manichaean. Shinran certainly
was not. Between Hōnen and Shinran the lotus of Shinshuism, for some
cause, known perhaps but not disclosed, pushed itself several feet
higher up into the sunlight of Truth. Manichaean elements became less
prominent and distinct, the resemblance to Christianity became more
pronounced.

Shinran's name is concocted of syllables taken from the names of two of
his illustrious predecessors, Gen*shin* and Don*ran*. It may be that he
found in these two teachers the inspiration of those reforms which made
his followers differ from those of his predecessor Hōnen. Future study
may perhaps enable us to lay bare the real teachings of these two Sages
of the Shinshu.
