### *The Care of the Dead*.

### (ii) Days of Mourning &c.

(§§ 91–95).

There are certain festivals in Japanese Buddhism connected with the dead
in general.

I. *Higan*. Periods of seven days at the spring and autumn Equinoxes,
devoted to special worship in connection with the departed. The word
*Higan* means the "opposite shore." At the Equinox the sun, as it were,
crosses from one shore to the other. The "opposite shore" is a natural
figure of death, and the Buddhist, like the Christian, would say that

"Part of the host have crossed the flood,  
     And part are crossing now."

</div>

In other sects, prayers are made at these seasons for the souls of the
departed, and offerings presented for their repose. The Shinshuist
observes the same ceremonial, but he calls his Higan devotions a
*sambutsu-e*, or meeting for the praise of Buddha; for he cannot be
sorry for those that are in the good keeping of Amida, nor pray for the
repose of those whose eternal happiness he believes to be secured for
ever.

II\. *Urabon* or the *Bon Festival* is the All Souls’ Day of Japan,
coming in the middle of the seventh month. At the Bon Festival it is
believed

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

that the spirits of the dead return to the homes of their earthly life,
and lamps are lighted to show them on their way, food prepared for their
refreshment, and evergreen sheds for them to rest in. *O Bon* is the
harvest time of the country priest, who looks to its rewards and
emoluments far more keenly than any Christian parson looks to his Easter
offerings; but the return of the spirits of the departed is not always a
subject of joyful contemplation to the layman of indifferent holiness.
There is a terror of 'spooks' in all countries, and *revenants* are not
always welcomed. I have known country people positively refuse, at
Bon-time, to open their doors to speak to belated travellers who were
asking for direction. How were they to know that the voices outside the
door did not come from spirits of undesirable and unwelcome relatives,
who had gone over to the majority and were now visiting their ancient
homes?

But the Shinshuist does not allow himself to dwell on the gloomy side of
things. His *Urabon* is called *Kwaukie*, 'feast of rejoicing'; for,
again, there is no need for him to be anxious as to the frame of mind in
which his dear ones will return to visit their ancestral homes. His dear
ones are safe in Paradise, sitting on lotus leaves, and listening to the
sermons of Father Amida.

III\. *Eitai shidō*, a term used in other sects for the masses said at
stated intervals for the souls of the dead long since departed, is
changed in the Shinshu to *sosen shaon*, gratitude for the deceased
ancestors. It is with the Shinshu almost as it is with the English
Churchman when he "blesses

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God's Holy Name
for all His servants departed this life in God's faith and fear." There
is no public prayer, but there is grateful
[commemoration](errata.htm#14.md).

The same principle holds good in the case of the particular dead, as in
that of the dead in general.

IV\. The *kijitsu* and *saijitsu*, anniversaries, and memorial days, for
parents, wife, or children, are changed from days of prayer and
intercession to days of praise and thanksgiving, and if the Shinshuist
celebrates these days with the same dignity and pomp that is observed in
other bodies, his motives are not the same. He has no intention to
benefit the dead by what he does: he looks to the benefit to the
worshipper himself, to the good the service will do to the non-believer
(§ 92). That the souls of the dead may be benefited by these services is
not denied. Only, the main object is to benefit the living rather than
the dead (§ 93), and the benefit to the dead seems to be connected more
especially with those forty nine days before mentioned during which the
soul lingers in the intermediate state (*chū-u*) before entering
definitely into its proper sphere, be it good or bad (§ 94).

All these things the Shinshu observes, and yet in every one of them it
has modified the accepted Buddhist tradition in favour of one which is
essentially its own. The same may be said of the *indō* ceremony to
which I have already alluded, and to the practice of giving a *hōmyō* or
*kaimyō* (posthumous names) to the deceased. The former is considered by
the Shinshu as being given to the soul after death by Amida himself, who
comes and takes it by the hand to Paradise: the latter is given by

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

the priests at the time of the funeral ceremonies, as a sign, like the
symbolical head-shaving of a deceased layman, that the departed
So-and-So, has now definitely entered into religion (*buppō*), and left
the ranks of the laity. There is a striking resemblance here to the New
Name which, in the Apocalypse, is said to be given to him that is
faithful.
