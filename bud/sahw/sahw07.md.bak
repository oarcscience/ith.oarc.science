### *The Shōshinge*.

Before proceeding with the treatment of my subject it will be well for
me to put my readers in possession of this celebrated poem <span
id="fr_32"></span>[\*](#fn_32.md) or hymn, composed by the great Shinran
himself, which is said to form a part of the daily devotions of every
truly devout Shinshu household. I shall constantly have occasion to
refer to it in the course of these pages, as it forms in itself a sort
of summary of the whole historical position of the Shinshu. I am
fortunately able to avail myself of the assistance afforded me by a
translation from Mr. Tada's own pen. I have in several passages made use
of words and phrases drawn from Christian theology to express what I
have believed to be the real meaning of the poem. I have done so
purposely, my object in doing so being to call attention to the
parallelisms between the two systems. They are indeed well called
parallel, for like parallel straight lines they "meet in Infinity." May
we say that Infinity is God?

\[*Pages 36 through the top of page 46, which contain the Japanese text
of the Shōshinge, are presented as thumbnailed images—JBH*\].

1-2. I put my trust in the great Tathāgata of Infinite Life and
Boundless Light!

3–10. Hōzō the Bodhisattva, <span id="fr_33"></span>[\*](#fn_33.md) in the
days of his humiliation, being in the presence of the Tathāgata
Sejizaiō, <span id="fr_34"></span>[†](#fn_34.md) examining the degree of
excellence of the Paradises of all the Buddhas, the causes of their
formation, and the angels and men in them, made his great Vow and
proclaimed his mighty Oath, which he meditated and selected for the
space of five long Kalpas; and he repeated the Vow of announcing his
Holy Name 'Amida' in all the Ten Quarters.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

11–16. Universally doth he send forth his endless, boundless,
all-pervading, unrivalled, supreme Light, his Light of Purity, of Joy,
of Wisdom, His changeless, unconceivable, unexplainable Light, brighter
than the brightness of Sun or Moon. His Light illuminates worlds more
numerous than dust, and all sentient creatures enjoy it and are
illuminated thereby.

17–20. His Holy Name <span id="fr_35"></span>[\*](#fn_35.md) which was
revealed by his Vow of Salvation, is the fundamental Power that justly
determines us to enter into his Pure Land. His Vow to make us put our
sincere trust in it is the effective cause which produces perfect
Enlightenment. His Vow to lead us without fail into Nirvāna has been
fulfilled; in consequence of it, we can acquire the same rank as the
Bodhisattva <span id="fr_36"></span>[†](#fn_36.md) in this life, and
Nirvāna in the next.

21–24. The reason why the Tathāgata S’akyamuni was revealed to the world
was solely that he might proclaim the Boundless Ocean of Amida's
Fundamental Vow. Men, numerous as the Ocean Waves, who are subject to
the Five Obstacles <span id="fr_37"></span>[‡](#fn_37.md) and

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

entangled in Evil, should certainly listen to the Tathāgata's true
words.

25–28. If once there be aroused in. us but one thought of joy and love
(in consequence of the Vow), we turn just as we are <span
id="fr_38"></span>[\*](#fn_38.md) with our sins and lusts upon us, towards
Nirvāna. Laymen and saints alike, <span id="fr_39"></span>[†](#fn_39.md)
even those who have committed the five deadly sins, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[‡](#fn_40.md) and slandered the Holy Laws of Buddha,
will yet, by faith in the power of the Tathāgata, enter into the
enjoyment and taste of his mercy, as surely as the water in the mountain
stream ultimately reaches the Ocean and becomes salt.

29–35. The Light of the Divine Heart which has taken hold of us,
illuminates and protects us

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

continually, and dispels the darkness of Ignorance. It is true that the
dark mist of covetousness and passion constantly overhangs the sky that
is above the believing heart. Yet, though the sky above may be
constantly overcast, beneath the cloud <span
id="fr_41"></span>[\*](#fn_41.md) it is light, there is no darkness.

35–40. When we have made Faith our own, and have received a sight of the
great mercy and a thought of pious joy, we pass away sideways <span
id="fr_42"></span>[†](#fn_42.md) from the five evil spheres of life. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[‡](#fn_43.md) If any layman, whether good or bad, hears
and believes the all-embracing Vow of Amida-Buddha, him will the
Tathāgata S’akyamuni praise for his wisdom, and will call him a
lotus-flower among men.

41–48. For sentient creatures, who are heretical, evil, and proud, to
believe and accept the practice of Amida's Fundamental Vow, is indeed a
hard matter, there is nothing harder than this.

Abhidharma <span id="fr_44"></span>[§](#fn_44.md) Doctors of Western India,
noble

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

priests of China and Japan, have declared to us that the true meaning of
the Great Saint's (S’akyamuni's) appearance was to point to the true Vow
of Amida, and the Vow is just the way for us.

50–54. S’akyamuni the Tathāgata, on the mountain peak in Lanka, <span
id="fr_45"></span>[\*](#fn_45) (in Ceylon.md), prophesied for the people
assembled to hear him that there should appear in South India, a great
teacher, Nāgārjuna by name, who should destroy the conflicting views of
Entity and Non-Entity, <span id="fr_46"></span>[†](#fn_46.md) who should
clearly teach the excellent law, of the Mahāyāna, who should reach the
Class of Joy and be born in Paradise.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

55–60. He (Nāgārjuna) <span id="fr_47"></span>[\*](#fn_47.md) taught that
the way of Salvation by one's own efforts is like a toilsome journey by
land, that the Way of Faith in the Merits of Another is as an easy
voyage in a fair ship over smooth waters, that if a man put his trust in
the Fundamental Vow of Amida, he will enter at once, by Buddha's power,
into the class of those destined to be born in the Pure Land. Only let
him ever call upon the Name of the Tathāgata, and gratefully commemorate
the great all-embracing Vow.

61–64. Vasubandhu, <span id="fr_48"></span>[†](#fn_48.md) also, the
Bodhisattva, composed his praise of the Pure Land, put his whole trust
and confidence in the Tathāgata of Boundless Light, established the
truth by the Sutras, <span id="fr_49"></span>[‡](#fn_49.md) and made clear
the way of 'cross-wise going-out' through the merits of the great
Fundamental Vow.

65–72. (Vasubandhu taught), with a view to the Salvation of Men through
the Faith in Another's merits which Amida bestows <span
id="fr_50"></span>[§](#fn_50.md) upon us, the mystery

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

of the One Heart. If a man enter into this Faith, he will acquire the
merit of the Great Ocean of Divine Treasures, and will certainly be
admitted to the Great Company of the Saints, in the present life. In the
future life, he will go to the Pure Land which shines with the Light of
Wisdom like the lotus, and having acquired the Holy Existence with
divine power he will return to the forest of human passions, and there,
in the garden of life and death, (for the Salvation of his fellow
creatures), will manifest himself in various transformations.

73–78. Take Donran <span id="fr_51"></span>[\*](#fn_51.md) our teacher,
whom the king (Wuti) of the Lian Dynasty reverenced as a Bodhisattva.
From Bodhiruci, the Master of the Tripitaka, he received the teaching of
the Pure Land, and burning the ascetic books (in which he had hitherto
put his trust), put his faith in the Paradise of Bliss. He followed the
teachings of Vasubandhu, (which he learned from Bodhiruci), and clearly
taught that Amida's Great Vow was the effective cause of Birth in
Paradise.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

78–84. (Donran taught) that the Grace of new birth into Paradise, as
well as that whereby we can return to Earth to aid our fellowing-beings,
is a gift which we receive through the Buddha's power, and that the
effective cause whereby we are justly determined to be born in the Pure
Land, is only the believing heart. Wherefore, if we, blind and sinful
persons, arouse this believing heart, we can perceive Nirvana in this
life. Afterwards, without fail, we reach the Pure Land of Boundless
Light, and teaching all sentient creatures that are involved in misery
of Earth, lead them to salvation.

85–92. Dōshaku <span id="fr_52"></span>[\*](#fn_52.md) taught that the
innumerable practices for perfecting righteousness by one's own efforts
are of no value, and the invocation of the Name which comprises all
virtues, he praised as beneficial. He spoke much of the three marks of
Non-Faith <span id="fr_53"></span>[†](#fn_53.md) and Faith, and showed that
in all three Ages <span id="fr_54"></span>[‡](#fn_54.md)

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

it is the principle of Mercy that alone rules and draws men. Though a
man had done evil all his life, yet, .if he were once brought near to
the Great Vow, he would reach the Land of Bliss and enjoy the fruits of
Salvation.

93–94. Zendō <span id="fr_55"></span>[\*](#fn_55.md) was the first that
understood the true will of Buddha S’akyamuni in his age, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[†](#fn_56.md) and that had pity, alike for those who
practised meditation or moral good, as for those who lived in
wickedness.

95–100. Zendō taught that the Effect of Salvation is given by the Holy
Light <span id="fr_57"></span>[‡](#fn_57.md) and the Sacred Name of Amida,
and expounded the Great Ocean of Wisdom contained in the Fundamental
Vow. The believer, having rightly received the adamantine heart of firm
faith, and having answered to the calling of the Tathāgata with a joyful
heart, like Vaidehi <span id="fr_58"></span>[§](#fn_58.md) receives the
threefold assurance <span id="fr_59"></span>[\*\*](#fn_59.md) and

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

immediately enters into the happiness of the Eternal Life. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[\*](#fn_60.md)

101–102. Genshin studied all the teachings of S’akyamuni, and earnestly
aspired to go to the Buddha's Land. He exhorted all men to go there too.

103–108. Genshin <span id="fr_61"></span>[†](#fn_61.md) established a
difference between a pure and an impure Faith, the one deep and the
other shallow. Also, he taught that there are two forms of Paradise
(Kwedo and Hōdo), as places of rest for those of deep and shallow faith
respectively. O deadly sinner! Invoke but once Amida-Buddha! He is
taking hold of us. Though our eyes of flesh can not clearly see him
owing to our sins, yet is his mercy constantly present to illuminate our
minds.

109—112. My teacher Genkū <span id="fr_62"></span>[‡](#fn_62.md) threw
light on Buddhism, and had deep compassion for the laity, good or bad.
It was he who originated the Shinshu teachings in this country, and
propagated

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

in this wicked world the doctrine of Amida's Selected Vow. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[\*](#fn_63.md)

113–116. Genkū taught that the reason why men keep constantly returning
to the Home of Error (bodily life), is entirely due to our being fast
bound with doubt. In order that we may enter straight into the peaceful
and eternal abode of Nirvāna, it is necessary for us to receive the
believing heart.

117–120. Thus prophets and teachers, propagating the teachings of the
Sutras, have saved countless men from countless evils. Monks and laymen
in the present age! We must put our hearts together, and believe the
words that these exalted monks have spoken.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_32"></span>[35:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_32.md) It may be well to
state here that great doubts have been thrown upon the historicity of
Shinran. It is maintained by some that no such person as Shinran ever
existed, that, in other words, he was a mythical personage, invented by
Genkū's not over scrupulous disciple, Zenshin, for purposes of his own,
and that no documentary proof of Shinran's existence can be advanced
dating less than a century from the date of his supposed death. On this
point I have reserved my judgment, and have given Shinran the benefit of
the doubt.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[46:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_33.md) *Hōzō* is in the
Sanskrit *Dharmakara*. It is the name given to Amida during the period
of his sojourn on earth as a man. It will be borne in mind of course
that, according to the Shinshu teachings, he existed as Amitābha before
his appearance on earth in the form of a man. The *in-i no to ki*, which
Mr. Tada has translated "days of his humiliation," form an interlude
between an eternal Past and an eternal Future, just as do the thirty
three years of the earthly life of Jesus Christ.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[46:†](sahw07.htm#fr_34.md) *Sejizaiō*. Sanskrit
*Lokes’vara Rāja*, "King Lord of the World." In the Sukhavati Vyuha this
is the name given to the Buddha before whom Hōzō appeared to make his
vow. Cf. Heb x. 5-11, and Phil ii. 9. 10.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[47:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_35.md) *His Holy Name*, i.e.
Amida Butsu.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[47:†](sahw07.htm#fr_36.md) A Bodhisattva is the
stage immediately below that of a Buddha. If we remember that a Buddha
is a "perfect Being," we shall also see that there is an analogy between
a Bodhisattva, and a "Son of God" such as Saint John speaks of.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[47:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_37.md) There are said to be 5
obstacles which call men away from the duties of religion, and so hinder
their Salvation (*go-joku*): 1. War, sickness, calamity. 2. The
hindrances which come from contact with immoral men and which infects
our lives. 3. The hindrances of false doctrine, heresy, and schism. 4.
The hindrances of our own lusts and passions. 5. The despondency which
leads men to *accidie* or *acedia*, i.e. "getting slack," and sometimes
even to suicide.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[48:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_38.md) *Just as we are*. Mr.
Tada's words will at once suggest a well-known Christian hymn which has
the same thought.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[48:†](sahw07.htm#fr_39.md) *Laymen and Saints
alike*. We shall see, in the course of these chapters, that there are
certain historical connections between the Manichaeans and some of the
Amidaist Fathers. It is possible that the distinction here made between
laymen and Saints may be an echo of Manichaeism. We shall land it again
in the case of later Patriarchs, and in the Appendix.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[48:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_40.md)There are two
enumerations of the deadly sins. In the Hīnayāna, they are 1. Parricide,
2. Matricide. 3. The murder of a religious man. 4. The introduction of
strife into the Church. 5, With evil intent to wound a Buddha. The five
deadly sins of the Mahāyāna are the following:—1. Sacrilegious
defilement or destruction of temples, images, or holy vessels 2. To
speak slightingly or contemptuously of the three Vehicles or forms of
faith. 3. To treat religious persons with disrespect. 4. The deadly sins
of the Hīnayāna, mentioned above. 5. Committing any of the ten forbidden
things, taking life, theft, adultery, lying, unclean language, malicious
talking, a double tongue, greediness, anger, folly. It is probably to
the latter that Shinran is here referring. Cf. x. Tim i. 8–16.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[49:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_41.md) *Beneath the cloud*.
It is possible that this word "cloud" may have some reference to the
name given to Manichaean temples, *Dar-un-Kōmyōji*, "Temple of the Light
Shining in the Great Cloud." See Appendix I and II

<span id="fn_42"></span>[49:†](sahw07.htm#fr_42.md) *Sideways* i.e. by a
short cut. Salvation by Faith. For the expression, "taken hold of us," a
few lines above, Cf. Phil. iii. 12.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[49:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_43.md) The five spheres of
existence into which Evil enters are: 1. Angels, (liable to fall). 2.
Men. 3. Devils in Hell. 4. Hungry Demons. 5. Beasts and Brutes.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[49:§](sahw07.htm#fr_44.md) *Abhidharma* etc. In
these lines, Shinran is referring especially to the seven Patriarchs of
the Shinshu, whom we shall have occasion to mention again. The writers
of the Abhidharma or metaphysical treatises of the Buddhist Canon must
all be placed the end of the first century A.D., if not later. <span
id="page_50">p. 50</span> The Apocryphal Gospel of St. Thomas tells us
that the great Christian preacher met a martyr's death at Gandhāra, the
very spot where the remains of Kanishka's temple with the relics of
S’akyamuni have recently been discovered. And only a few years after
this there arises in Buddhism a school of preachers who say that
Salvation comes not by any works that man can do, but by Faith in One
who has given himself to be our Saviour!

<span id="fn_45"></span>[50:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_45.md) *Lanka is the old name
of Ceylon*. In the Sūtra known in Japan as the *Ryoga Kyō*, (Lankāvātara
Sūtra) it is said by some that S’akyamuni (whether miraculously or not)
visited Ceylon, and there prophesied that Nāgārjuna should appear some
six centuries afterwards, and do all the things here mentioned. I cannot
here enter into the question of the genuineness of this much disputed
Buddhist prophecy.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[50:†](sahw07.htm#fr_46.md) The question of *Entity
and Non-Entity* which troubled Buddhism in the first century A.D. also
under the name of the Gnostic heresy known as Docetism, was troubling
the infant Christian Church. From recent discoveries it would seem the
Entity teachers (Sarvāstivādins) were most powerful under Kanishka.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[51:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_47.md) Nāgārjuna's date may
be placed somewhere about A.D. 120, during the reign of Kanishka, who
flourished until about A.D. 150. The Council which Kanishka held is said
to have devoted very especial attention to the Abhidharma, and was
followed by a great out-burst of missionary activity which brought the
Amida books to China in A.D. 147. V. A. Smith (Early Hist. of India p.
231) says that this was due to Kanishka's conquest of Khotan, which
opened the way for his Buddhist subjects to penetrate into China.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[51:†](sahw07.htm#fr_48.md) Vasubandhu's date is
now generally placed about A.D. 450.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[51:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_49.md) One Shinshu priest has
explained this to me in the Singular, as referring only to the Daikyō,
or Amitāyurdhyāni Sutra.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51:§](sahw07.htm#fr_50.md) *bestows*. Cf. Eph. ii.
8.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[52:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_51.md) Donran is esteemed as
the first of the Chinese Patriarchs. His date is given as A.D. 500–560,
and his activities fell under the rule of the Lian Dynasty, A.D.
502–557. Donran apparently began life as a Taoist philosopher, who being
very anxious to complete some philosophical investigations, and fearing
lest he should die before they were completed, sought for some potent
elixir of Life. Bodhiruci, an Indian missionary, working at Loyang from
A.D. 503 to 558, pointed him to the Amida Scriptures. But it is evident
that Bodhiruci, like his Master, Vasubandhu, mainly thought of the hope
set before the believer of "returning to the forest of human passions,"
and it was this that attracted Donran, as giving him the hope of
completing his investigations. Re-birth in Paradise was to him a thing
to be desired mainly on that account.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_52.md) *Dōshaku's* birth is
given as A.D. 554, or thereabouts. He is reckoned as the Second Chinese
Patriarch, and lived long enough to see and advise his successor, Zendō.
See Appendix I.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[53:†](sahw07.htm#fr_53.md) *Non-Faith and Faith*.
A faith which is not a true one, says Mr. Tada in his commentary, may be
known by the following characteristic marks. 1. It is not pure and
simple. 2. Is not a faith "with the whole heart." 3. Is liable to
changes. On the contrary, a true faith is. 1. Plain and simple. 2.
Whole-hearted. 3. Lasting (sōzokushin).

<span id="fn_54"></span>[53:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_54.md) The three Ages are well
known to Buddhist thought. (a) The period of *Upright Law*, to last for
500 years after the Nirvana. By that time the true understanding of
S’akya's teaching would have died out. (b) A period of 1000 years,
beginning 500 years after the Nirvana—*the Image Law Period*. Then (c) a
second millennium (or according to the Shinshu, 10,000 years, of the
*Decay of the Law*. In this period Shinran appeared, as did also
Nichiren. Dōshaku's teaching was that, whatever <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> might be the period, the Mercy of the Buddha would still hold
good, and the more so when the decay of Faith made Salvation by Works
more and more difficult. It is instructive to note the parallel between
Dōshaku's thought as here given, and St. Paul's arguments as to the
relations between the Gospel and the Law as worked out in the Epistle to
the Galatians.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[54:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_55.md) *Zendō*. circa A.D.
614. See Appendix I.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[54:†](sahw07.htm#fr_56.md) *in his age*. i.e. in
S’akyamuni's own age. This would mean that Zendō first understood that
S’akyamuni's chief object in teaching, was to point men to Amida. Manes
apparently did the same.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[54:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_57.md) *Holy Light*. i e.
Kōmyō. See Appendix I and II.

Bimbisāra, to whom S’akyamuni first gave the teachings about Amida, in
the Amitāyurdhyāni-Sutra.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[54:\*\*](sahw07.htm#fr_59.md) *threefold
assurance*. lit. *san-nin*, the three forms of perfect patience. But the
word seems to correspond more or less with the threefold *plerophoria*
or "full assurance," mentioned by St. Paul in Col. ii. 2; Heb. vi. 2; X.
22.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[55:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_60.md) *Eternal Life*.
Compare a very similar thought in St. John V. 24

<span id="fn_61"></span>[55:†](sahw07.htm#fr_61.md) Genshin, first Japanese
Patriarch. A.D. 912–1017. Wrote much on the efficacy of prayer. The
distinction which Genshin makes between the two forms of Paradise, and
the two kinds of faith, savours somewhat of Manichaeism. *Kwedo* is a
place where the soul is "purged" from the seeds of error, by the "fire"
of the Holy Name. See Appendix I and II.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[55:‡](sahw07.htm#fr_62.md) *Genkū's* date is A.D.
1133–1212. Genkū's compassion for the laity was called out by the
political and social miseries of his time, and by the neglect of their
duty as religious teachers by the large and influential sects of the
day. It is the contention of the Shinshu that all Shinran's reforms were
really prompted by Genkū (Hōnen).

<span id="fn_63"></span>[56:\*](sahw07.htm#fr_63.md) *Selected Vow*:
because Hōzo Biku made his Vow after a careful study and examination of
all the different Paradises of the various Buddhas.
