### <span class="smallcaps">Chapter XXIII.</span>

### *Fasting*.

(Shōjin \#)

(§ 98)

The word *shōjin*, though generally limited to fasting from meat, really
has a much wider signification. It implies the purification of the soul
from every impurity that may prove an obstacle in its path into the
presence of the Unseen Deity.

The devout Shinshuist is taught, not merely to abstain at the proper
seasons from meat, but to extend the scope of his fast by abstaining
from fish, from wine, from tobacco, from pungent herbs, from all
occasions that minister to sin. Shinshuism does not however fall into
the Manichean error of considering these things bad in themselves. It
merely rejects them, whenever, and so far as, they become ministers of
temptation.

And if, human nature being what it is, the Shinshuist does not always
rise to the high ideal thus set before him, we will not throw stones. We
will think of our own shortcomings, and by our example help the
Shinshuist to keep his own law better.

In § 99 we are warned that we cannot be saved by the observance of any
ceremony. Ceremonies are to be observed, we are told, for the purpose of
keeping our faith alive and warm, an effect which they undoubtedly
produce if properly carried out. They

are also valuable indices whereby we may know the state and progress of
a man's faith. For, says our author, when we see a *zaike*, which is
trim and nicely kept, with signs of prosperity, if not of wealth, we may
conclude with justice that the "parsonage people" are industrious and
diligent. Similarly, when we find a *zaike* in which the duties of the
Faith are laid aside, or perfunctorily performed, we may safely conclude
that the religion of that family is at a low ebb.
