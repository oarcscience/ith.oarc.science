### *The Care of the Dead*.

(A Shinshu Funeral.)

In the older Jōdo Sect, there is a pretty custom connected with the
death of a believer. A picture of Amida is hung on the wall near the
head of the sick bed, and a silken or other cord, fastened at the one
end to the picture, is fastened at the other to the wrist of the dying
man. It is a vivid representation of a celebrated chapter in the
Hokekyō, in which the glorified S’akyamuni, whom the Amidaist sects
identify with Amida, is represented as throwing a rope (the merits of
His Great Vow) into the midst of a burning house (this transitory life),
in order that its frail and erring occupants may lay hold of it by
faith, and be thus drawn out of the midst of the conflagration to the
safe refuge of the Garden outside. The ceremony is, therefore, a
symbolic expression of the belief of the Jōdo disciples, that it is this
salvation that is put into operation at the moment of the believer's
death.

In the Shinshu, the ceremony would be meaningless, for it is the firm
conviction of the disciple of Shinran that the Rope of Salvation was
thrown to him long ago, that he seized it at the moment when he fixed
his faith on Amida, and that the only thing that remains for the dying
man to do is to await death with thankfulness, and a with sure and
certain hope.

Perhaps the best way to set forth the beliefs and practices of the
Shinshu with regard to the solemn

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

question of death will be to describe an actual Shinshu funeral. Such a
description has been furnished me by my friend, Mr. K. Tachibana,
himself a priest of the Sōtō Sect. It is taken from an account which
appeared in the Magazine called *Fūzoku Gappō* at the time of the
obsequies of Kōsho, 21st Abbot of the Eastern Hongwanji, at Kyoto, who
died on the 15th January 1894.

Three days after death, on the morning of the 18th, the corpse, arrayed
in ecclesiastical vestments of a *gokō* <span
id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md) colour, was placed in a sitting posture
on a *Kyokuroku*, or camp-chair, in one of the official rooms of his
private residence. Devout laymen were constantly in attendance, and at
intervals, as groups of mourners passed through to pay their last
respects to the deceased prelate, the light curtain of split bamboo was
silently raised, so that they might gaze freely upon the dead, the face,
however, being veiled so that only the eyes were visible. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[†](#fn_111.md)

On the evening of the following day the corpse was washed (for the
second time), <span id="fr_112"></span>[‡](#fn_112.md) put into a coffin,
and removed to the Head Temple, where a special mortuary chapel had been
fitted up, with a picture of Amida hanging in a conspicuous place behind
the coffin. Here it was kept for ten days, constantly attended by
priests in minor orders, who silently burned incense before it every ten
minutes, and watched by relatives and friends, by the ladies of

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the late Abbot's household, and by representatives of Imperial
personages, etc.

On the evening of the 29th, after a short ceremony, the corpse was
removed from the mortuary chapel to the great Halls of the Temple, first
to the Daishidō, or Hall Sacred to Shinran, and then to the Amidadō, or
Hall of Amida, where it was exposed to the inspection of the Faithful,
in general, being visited by thousands of pilgrims from every part of
the country, who had flocked to Kyoto for the occasion.

It was then removed to a place called Uchino, for the funeral service
proper. Uchino was in former times the place of cremation, but the
growth of the city has made it an undesirable spot for the purpose. The
cremation therefore took place elsewhere.

The service at Uchino, which began as soon as the whole congregation had
taken their places (only near relatives, priests of high rank, and the
representatives of Imperial Princes and the Nobility being admitted),
was a comparatively simple one.

It began with the solemn Fourfold Invitation. "With reverence we invite
the Buddhas of the Ten Directions (i.e. all the Buddhas) to come down
upon the Sacred Altar. There is joy in the scattering of Flowers."

"With reverence we invite the Nyorai S’akyamuni to come down on this
Sacred Altar. There is joy in the Scattering of Flowers."

"With reverence we invite the Nyorai Amitābha to come down on this
Sacred Altar. There is joy in the Scattering of Flowers."

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

"With reverence we invite Kwannon and Seishi, and the other holy
Bodhisattvas, to come down on this Sacred Altar. There is joy in the
Scattering of Flowers."

It will be seen that there is in this Fourfold Invocation a pretty exact
picture of the theological position of Shinshuism. It begins with a sort
of polytheism. There have been "lords many and gods many"—there are
Buddhas in all the Ten Quarters of the Universe, through whom the Saving
Way has been made known since ages of immeasurable remoteness. (The
names of some amongst them are to be found in the Sukhāvati Vyūhas and
other Sūtras revered by the Sect.) Amongst all these Buddhas one has
been preeminent, the only one for whom a claim to historicity has been
set up, the. Buddha S’akyamuni. S’akyamuni, according to the Shinshu,
not only teaches. the same broad way of salvation as did the rest, but
he goes a step further, and bears witness to another Buddha—the Eternal
Fount and Source of all Buddhaship—the Buddha Amitābha. And Amitābha is
invoked in His threefold aspect, in the glory of his past, the glory
which is His in the Dharmakaya, in the glory of His humiliation—the
glory which He had when He became man; in the glory of His present,
when, as Namu-Amida-Butsu, He sits as king of Paradise. And the
Bodhisattvas, the ministers of Amida, are invoked, beginning with
Kwannon and Seishi, and ending with the humblest of those in whom has
dwelt the spirit of Amida. It is impossible, perhaps, to compress the
Shinshu Faith into a shorter compass than this.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

After this followed the chanting of the *Shōshinge* which, as the reader
is aware, gives the history of the transmission of the sect, the
chanting of the *Nembutsu-wasan*, or hymn in praise of Amida, which
summarizes the belief of the sect, and especially its belief in the
efficacy of faith in Amida at the supreme moment of death, and finally,
after many repetitions of the Nembutsu formula, the *Ekō*, or prayer of
transference.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Gwannishi kudoku    Byōdō se issai

</div>

"Let us pray that the merits (acquired by this our service) may be
distributed equally among all Sentient Beings, that they may all alike
conceive in themselves the desire for Bodhi, and may ascend and be
reborn in the Land of Peace and Comfort."

With those Words ended the service in the Uchino ground. It is a
distinguishing feature of the Shinshu funeral rites that they contain no
*indō*, or 'guiding words' addressed to the deceased, to instruct him,
in case he should be ignorant, how to behave himself, what to believe,
and what to practice, in order to secure a safe passage through the
realms of darkness. The firm belief of the Shinshuist that Amida has got
sure hold of him, and that He will guide him safely to the mansion that
He has prepared, makes the *indō* a needless and meaningless form of
words.

There was, however, one piece of ritual, in the funeral I am describing,
peculiar to such rites when celebrated at Uchino,—a symbolical
cremation, the

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

burning of a bundle of straw in memory of the fact that Uchino had once
been a crematory. When this was done, the coffin was removed to the
crematory at Kwazan-in, accompanied by the strains of the *Shōshinge*,
and the smoke of incense.

None but the successor of the deceased Abbot, a few near relatives, and
ancient retainers, were admitted to the crematorium, and the fire was
kindled by the new Abbot himself. Presently the smoke was seen issuing
from the building.

*Jhāyati! Jhāpeti!* "He burns and causes to burn." The words used in
this phrase are interesting, as giving Pali forms instead of Sanskrit,
thus pointing to a Buddhism of Magadhan origin, by the side of that
which came via Central Asia and China. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) After the cremation, the ashes were
carried back to Uchino, secretly and under guard, a custom observed in
the Shinshu ever since the fifteenth century, when, on the death of
Rennyo Shōnin, the jealous Tendai monks attempted to waylay the
procession that was carrying back the hallowed bones, and to scatter the
precious relics to the winds.

The next morning, with incense, Shoshinge, and Nembutsu, the ashes were
again removed from Uchino to the Chūindō Hall of the Hongwanji, where
they remained beneath an Altar until the 49th day after death, when they
were finally placed in their permanent resting place. The 49th day is,
in

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhist belief, a
very critical day in the history of the soul after death. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[\*](#fn_114.md) On that day its future destiny is
decided, and it goes from the intermediate state into its proper place
in . the world to come. A Buddhist, who was much interested in
Christianity, once pointed out to me the similarity between his beliefs,
and the period recorded to have elapsed between Easter and Pentecost.
"It was on the fortieth day after death," he said, "that Christ ascended
into the Heavens, but it cannot have been till the forty-ninth that He
definitely took his seat at the 'right hand' of His Father. And the very
next day after He had come into His Kingdom He sent down the Holy
Spirit!"

<span id="fn_110"></span>[135:\*](sahw21.htm#fr_110.md) *Go* is the
honorific, *Kō* (\#) is incense.—"Incense colour" is a sort of grey,
smoky, colour.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[135:†](sahw21.htm#fr_111.md) It is universal in
the funerals of clerics, thus to expose the corpse in a sitting posture.
This is not done for laymen.

*Jhāpeti* are not words peculiar to Shinshu. They are used in all sects.
Of Pali words surviving in Japan we may instance *dabi* a cremation.
Some words survive in two forms: e. g. *biku*, which is Pali, *bishū*
which is the Sanskrit *bhikshu*, "a monk." Also *abidon* = the Pali
*abhidamma*, and *abidatsuma* = Skt *abhidharma*.
