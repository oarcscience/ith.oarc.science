## SHINRAN AND HIS WORK.

## COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SHINSHU THEOLOGY.

### <span class="smallcaps">Chapter I</span>.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introductory</span>.

It is my intention in these lectures to sketch, for my own benefit, as
well as for that of my Readers, the history and doctrine of the
*Shinshū* or "True Sect" of Japanese Buddhism, such as it is to be seen
today in many parts of the Empire of Japan. The *Shinshū* is one of the
*Amida* or *Jōdo* Sects, so called either from its chief, we may say,
only Deity, the Original and Unoriginated Buddha, Amitābha or Amitāyus,
Lord of Boundless Life and Light, whom the Japanese know as Amida
Nyorai, or Mida; or else from *Jōdo* or Paradise, the safe Heaven of
freedom from sin and evil, which *Amida* promises to all who, with full
trust and confidence, draw near and invoke His Name, which, carved on a
tablet and placed in a holy place, is the quasi-Sacramental Exposition
and Pledge of His Immeasurable Compassion and Mercy.

There are in Japan four sects of Buddhism which profess a belief in
Amida and practise the Nembutsu. <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) Two
of these—the *Yūdzūnembutsu* and *Ji*,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —are insignificant
in influence and numbers. The other two—the *Jōdo* and the *Shinshū* are
weighty and numerous, comprising between them more than one half of the
Buddhist believers in this country. The *Shinshū* is the youngest, and
by far the most popular of them all, and carries out to its logical
conclusions the principle of Salvation by Faith in the Vow of Amida, the
One Buddha, which lies at the root of the doctrinal system of all four
sects. It is a purely Japanese sect—so, as a matter of fact, are all the
Jōdo sects;—for it is only in Japan that it has been found possible to
establish religious sects on the sole principle of Faith in Amida looked
upon as the One and Only Buddha. Yet it has its roots in the past, and
the Shinshuist proudly points to the fact that the Amida doctrines have
come down to him from the great Indian Mahāyānist doctors, Nāgārjuna and
Vasubandhu, through China, to the earliest days of Buddhism in Japan,
and that what Shinran elaborated was only the logical development of
that which previous Japanese doctors, Shōtoku, Kūya, Genshin and Hōnen,
had established.

Nay, he will trace his spiritual pedigree still further, and claim that
his doctrines come to him straight from the Buddha S’akyamuni himself,
and will defend, as genuine records of S’akyamuni's teachings, the three
Sūtras <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) in which, towards the end of
his career, the great Indian Teacher, brought his mission to a
conclusion, by pointing his hearers to the Mercies of the Great Buddha
of Boundless Life and Light. He had taught them, says the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shinshuist, for
many long years the doctrines of the Holy Path <span
id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2) ("this is the way: walk ye in it".md). But the
Holy Path is a road along which it needs strength and courage to walk,
and the majority of mankind are feeble. For the weary, the heavy-laden,
the sinner, the great S’akyamuni at last opened the Gate of Faith in the
Mercies of Amida, and thus made his system all-embracing and universal,
by welcoming to his fold the ignorant and sinful, as well as the wise
and holy.

The numerous points of resemblance between Christianity and Shinshu will
not fail to strike the readers of these pages. These resemblances may be
accounted for in many ways.

\(i\) The "Three Books," may be the genuine records of S’akyamuni's
Teaching. In that case they will .fall at the end of S’akyamuni's life,
between B.C. 490 and 480, after the fall of Babylon and when Persia was
already at grips with Greece. It is impossible to deny that, by that
time, the teachings of Jewish prophets may already have found an echo in
Indian teaching halls and *vihāras*. <span id="fr_3"></span>[†](#fn_3.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Or (ii) the "Three Books" may not have been composed until somewhere
near the time when we get the first literary mention of them, i.e. about
the middle of the second century A.D. In that case, it would seem
impossible to deny the possibility of Christian (and esp. Gnostic)
influences in their production. <span id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4.md)

Or again (iii), if we consider that the Amida Sects, as distinct bodies,
do not make their appearance on the scene until after Nestorians and
Buddhists had been working together side by side for a few centuries in
China,—that great school-house of Japanese religion,—we may again
suppose that there has been an influencing of Buddhist thought by
Christian ideas. In the course of these Lectures we shall frequently
have occasion to consider the wonderful coincidences which exist between
Christian theology and what we may call the theology of the Shinshu. The
Japanese theologians discuss a very large number of

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

problems, such as the relations between Faith and Works, Conversion, the
New Birth, Abstinence from meats, and from marriage, etc. which are
almost identical with those which agitated the Christian Communion
during the Apostolic age and afterwards,—strange to say, in almost every
case do we find the Shinshu doctors taking the same side as St. Paul in
their treatment of these questions.

There is a great deal to be said in favour of any or all of these
hypotheses, but this is not the place in which to say it. There is
another and more generous way of looking at the problem. It is equally
possible, we may say, that there has been no historical connection
whatever between Christianity and the Mahāyāna. It is quite possible
that neither faith has borrowed from the other, but that God, Who
fulfils Himself in countless ways, has brought Shinshuists and
Christians, along totally different roads, to the common acknowledgement
of the fact that there is One and Only One Lord and Saviour of Mankind,
and that He willeth all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of
the Truth, by faith in what He has done, and not. through any works or
merits of their own. <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) Viewed
superficially, the Saviours are respectively God-in-Christ and Amida
Nyorai—poles apart from each another. Go below the surface, and there is
much reason for concluding that the two conceptions are identical, and
that, without being conscious of it,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

our worship, under different forms and names, is all the while being
directed towards the same object. Throughout this book I purpose
consistently to take this line of argument, viz. that when the
Shinshuist recites his Nembutsu, he is (however unconsciously)
addressing the same Divine Person whom the Christian worships, on his
knees in the closet or before the Altar, and I believe that the witness
to Himself which God has thus given to the Japanese is one which the
Christian missionary would be ill advised to set aside or neglect.

The adoption of this line of argument will save me from a great deal of
antiquarian research and historical disquisition,—discussions which are
after all of but little value for the practical issues of life. These
matters will mostly appear only in footnotes and appendices, as matters
of secondary importance, and I shall be able to expose, in considerable
detail, and with constant reference to Christianity, the actual
teachings of the Shinshu itself, what answer they give to the spiritual
needs and cravings of mankind, how and in what way they help men to be
better, where they conflict with Christianity, and where they have fresh
light to throw on points which we Christians have held, perhaps,
mechanically, without a due appreciation of their full significance.

In order to give definiteness and order to my book, I am basing it on a
Japanese work which has but recently appeared—a Catechism of Shinshu
Doctrine, <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)—which I shall follow
faithfully from

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

chapter to chapter, and from section to section. I shall not give a
romanized Japanese text, nor even necessarily a literal translation. My
missionary readers (to whom alone such an original would be important)
ought to be able to read the Japanese text for themselves in the popular
style in which Mr. Nishimoto's book is written. Facilities for checking
my statement will be easily obtained by comparing them with the Japanese
from which I take them.

I hope none of my Christian readers will suspect me of advocating any
form of Christian doctrine at variance with that sound Nicene Faith
which the Catholic Church formulated for herself at the end of that long
struggle which was, in fact, if not in name, a struggle against the
Orientalism of invaders from Asia. I hope also that no Buddhist (if any
Buddhist condescends to read me) will think that I want to score a cheap
victory, and to degrade his Amida, by identifying him, however
tentatively, with God as revealed in Christ. It is with no controversial
aim that I take up my pen. Rather, I feel that the quarrel between
Eastern Buddhism and Western Christianity is one to be best solved by
the path of meditation and prayer. For, if, through the exercise of
Faith, we could, even for a few weeks only, realize that the Lord whom
we variously worship is One and the Same, the Source of Life and Light,
and if, with that Faith, we could come *just as we are*, Christians and
Buddhists, and ask for Light, are we to doubt Christ, or are we to doubt
Amida, by supposing that Light would be withheld from his children by
One whom Christians and

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Buddhists alike
delight in calling a Loving Father?

My Lectures will therefore be a first step in a new and perhaps
dangerous missionary experiment—the homoeopathic treatment of Shinshu
Theology. I am fully aware of the dangers that attend my
experiment,—what beleaguered city was ever yet taken without danger to
the besiegers? Still, I venture to ask for a sympathetic hearing till I
have said my say. I ask for no endorsement, though I trust the
reasonableness of my propositions will commend them in time to the
thoughtful reader's Christian or Buddhist conscience. In the old days of
Japan, when a *samurai* was about to undertake some doubtful enterprise
which his clan could not be expected readily to endorse, he would cut
himself off from his kinsmen, and become a *rōnin*. Then, if he failed,
he failed, and the clan took no harm: if he succeeded, he returned in
triumph to his feudal lord, bringing with him the fruits of his victory.
It is quite good to be a *rōnin* for Christ's sake. If I fail, I fail,
and the faithful will disown me, though I myself shall hope to be saved
"so as by fire." If I succeed, my work will bear its fruit, and the
result will be *ad majorem Dei gloriam*.

Book of Daniel is Identical with Cyaxares II of Xenophon's Cyropædia
(and Xenophon is sometimes a safer guide than Herodotus), it will be
seen that there must have been a very close connection between the
Medo-Persian Kingdom and N. W. and Central India. See article by
Bosanquet on "The Chronology of the Medes" in the Journal of the "R. As.
Soc." for 1858. If the Amida teachings are the genuine teachings of
S’akyamuni himself, we must not only say, with the Shinshuist, that he
did not promulgate them until towards the end of ministry, but we must
go further and say that it cannot have been until the end of his
ministry that he himself learned of the mercies of Amitābha. For it is
<span id="page_4">p. 4</span> inconceivable that a Teacher, with a large
and compassionate heart, like S’akyamuni, should have been content to
teach to suffering humanity the long and painful road of salvation by
works and merits, and to have withheld from them the short and easy Path
of Salvation by Faith. I conclude therefore that if this doctrine came
to the Buddhist world from the lips of S’akyamuni himself, it was a
doctrine which he only learned long after his Enlightenment under the Bō
Tree, and which he preached as soon as he knew it. It was a "better
way," and between B.C. 500 and 480, there must have been many
opportunities, even in India, of learning of Him whose worship was at
that juncture rising from a national cult to the world wide faith of an
Isaiah or an Ezekiel.

had a monotheistic faith of its own, opposed by the warrior caste (to
which S’akyamuni belonged) against the prevailing Pantheism of the
Brahmans. (Girerson, in Asiatic Quarterly Review July 1909).
