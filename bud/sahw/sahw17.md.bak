### CHAPTER XV.

### *Hō-on* (\#).

(§ 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83)

The word *Hō on* is not one that is absolutely peculiar to the Shinshu
Body. But it is one that, taken into the Shinshu system of theology, has
acquired an entirely fresh import and significance. In other sects of
Japanese Buddhism, religious rites and observances are practised for the
sake of the benefit accruing to the worshipper therefrom. Thus, the
Shingon or Tendai devotee recites *mantras* and *darani*, or goes
through prescribed manual acts, in order, by some theurgic process, to
compel the Deity to do that which he; the worshipper, happens to desire.
Thus, the disciple of the Zen sits absorbed in contemplation, waiting
for the moment when the Divine Light shall break into his soul, and the
Divine Voice speak to his conscience, with an illuminative power that
defies description, and in words that cannot be uttered or pronounced.
Thus, even the pious believer of the Jōdo sect recites his Nembutsu with
fervent zeal, believing that, with every repetition of the Sacred Name,
and every moving of the beads of his rosary, he is adding to his own
stock of merit, and making his own calling and election sure. But, for
the Shinshu believer, church-going and religious observances assume a
different aspect. There is no question of acquiring God's favour or
obtaining a benefit. Everything bas been already obtained that the soul
can possibly wish for. It only remains to give "thanks to God for

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

his inestimable gift," and the more the value of that great gift is
appreciated at its proper worth, the more fervent and the more constant
will be the expression of the believer's gratitude.

Hence it is that the whole sum of the religious observances of the
Shinshu believer after his "conversion" may be expressed in the one word
*hō-on*—"the giving of thanks" always, and in all things,—a kind of
never failing Eucharist.

And yet *hō-on* practices, though not observed for the purpose of
acquiring merit, but merely as an expression of gratitude for mercies
received, are not wholly without a certain effect on the heart and soul
of him that practises them.

I have already spoken of the three constituent parts of Karma, the *in*,
and the *en*, and the *kwa*. The *in* (\#), or primary cause of man's
salvation, is the Desire and Will of God, who willeth to have all men
saved and brought to the knowledge of Himself. This faith, given by
Amida-God, is the *seed* of the new Life implanted in our hearts. When
the believer understands that he is the heir (and the use of the
expression *sōzoku suru*, "to inherit," in §76 of the *Shinshu Hyakuwa*
is again significant) of Amida's promises, the "seed" is planted in his
heart, as the *in*, or primary cause. The seed is watered and
fertilized, kept from withering, decay, or death, encouraged to grow and
put forth leaves and branches, by the *en* (\#), the secondary cause,
the "eucharists," (if I may use the term with all holy reverence) which
his thankful heart is continually offering, and the *in* and the *en*,
working together, have their fruit (*kwa* \#) in holiness of life. It
seems to me that, taking

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the *Shinshu Hyakuwa* for my text, I have been able, without twisting
its statements into anything that a Shinshuist theologian would dispute,
to draw out, in logical sequence, a fair summary of the doctrine of
Sacramental Grace.

Again, if the Divine Will (or *hongwan*), implanted in our hearts, is
the *in*, and if the "eucharists" we offer are the *en*, we shall,
according to the Shinshu ideas, find the *kwa*, or fruit, in the
believer's conduct on this earth and in this transitory life. Paradise,
Salvation, Nirvana,—all these things are not the *fruits* that come from
the religious observances of the believer. They are not fruits at all,
they are part and parcel of that inestimable, free gift, which
Amida-God, the God who for us men became man, has freely bestowed on us.
They are included in the "all things" which, according to St. Paul, are
the necessary accompaniments of that gift of His Son, which God made
about the time when both Christianity and the Mahāyāna sprang into
existence.

If the *seed* is in our hearts, if the *sun* and *rain* of religious
practices make it grow, the only place in which the fruit can show
itself is on the tree, *i.e.* in this world, in our conduct and
behaviour as citizens of the earthly, and human, state and society.
Hence, to the Shinshu believer, the peculiar importance of the *zoku
taimon* (§71, *zokutaimon no hataraki wa hō-on no hoka wa nai no de
animasu*).

The *zokutaimon* of the believer is thus concerned with the same objects
and the same duties as the daily conduct, or *zokutaimon*, of the man
that has no religion, yet the two can never be quite the same thing,
inasmuch as they are done from absolutely

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

contradictory motives. *Hō-on to wa donata ni taishite nasu no de
arimasu ka?* To whom should our *hō-on*, the offering of our thankful
lives, be directed? St. Paul would have had no hesitation as to the
proper answer to give to this question. "Whether ye eat, or drink, or
whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God," would have been his answer.
The Shinshuist's reply is very similar (§ 77). Our *hō-on* is to be
directed to Amida Nyorai, from whom we have received all things. It is
with the *Nembutsu*, the formula of praise, on our lips or in our
hearts, that we go about our daily occupations (*Nyorai no go-on wo
kansha suru, seishin de Nembutsu tonaetsutsu dose kagyo wo itonamu no de
arimasu*). The motive sanctifies the action, and it is this motive that
differentiates *toto coelo* the life of the man of the world from that
of him who has been "saved by His Grace."

*Hō on* is expressed in many ways. It is not simply a matter of reciting
the *Nembutsu*. We must consider that all "wholesome practices" <span
id="fr_99"></span>[\*](#fn_99.md) form part of the life of the "thankful,"
and that the doing of them is a part of the burden of duty laid upon us
by the Nyorai himself (§ 78). Again, the practice of *hō-on* serves for
the advancement of religion in others. We shall all remember the passage
in St. Paul (1. Cor. xiv. 16) where the Apostle is discussing the
advisability of encouraging the public practice of speaking with
tongues, and asks how, if a man pray in a "tongue," the unlearned or
ignorant brother shall be able to say "Amen" to his giving

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

of thanks. A similar idea seems to underlie the thought expressed in §
99 of the *Shinshu Hyakuwa*. When the believer, we are told, recites his
*Nembutsu* aloud, the standers-by, who chance to hear him, cannot fail
to be edified. It may happen that the words of his giving of thanks fall
on soil ready prepared, hearts in which the seed of Faith (*in*) has
been planted, watered, and fertilized. Such hearts are good soil, and
the words of the believer's thanksgiving, falling like the latter rain,
act as the final *en*, and bring the Faith to maturity. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[\*](#fn_100.md) Or it may fall upon hearts less
advanced in Faith. Neither so will its effect be lost; for the Faith of
the Shinshu believer is that no single one of the oft-repeated
invocations can possibly fail to do some good in the world. "Thus,
directly and indirectly, the Nembutsu is a true Giving of Thanks, for it
helps. on the Law of Buddha." <span id="fr_101"></span>[†](#fn_101.md)

But, we may say, it is all very well to construct a *hō-on* out of the
Nembutsu and other holy rites. How is it, however, possible to treat
worldly and mundane occurrences as 'acts of thanksgiving'? To which it
may be answered (§ 80), that, if we learn to treat all our actions,
after we have accepted Faith, as being so many acts of thanksgiving, we

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

shall gradually come to lose all sense of self, whether it be our own
profit, or the satisfaction of our desires. This 'denial of self ' (for
that is what it amounts to) makes us ready to endure all sufferings and
pain, kills our pride, and makes us feel that our whole duty lies in
being thankful. When we reach this frame of mind all our actions become
true and straight (*shinsei* \#), and naturally tend to the advancement
of religion.

We now come to a paragraph of which I only write with the utmost
reluctance. It is always painful to find fault, more especially so when
one has to point out the shortcomings of a rival religion, which is
accepted honestly and in good faith by thousands of good men. I hope
that all that I have hitherto said of the Shinshu Creed will save me now
from the charge of captious fault-finding.

If a man consecrates his whole daily life as a thank-offering for
Amida's mercies, in what light are we to consider the lies and sharp
practices which form an inseparable portion of that daily life <span
id="fr_102"></span>[\*](#fn_102.md)?

We are told in reply that lies and sharp practices are not, in
themselves, "thank-offerings." But when a man is very zealous for the
propagation of his religion, and offers his whole life, lies,
sharp-practices, and all, to that end, the whole offering is acceptable,
and lies and sharp practices, seeing that

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

they become aids to the propagation of the Faith, become parts of an
acceptable offering, and are thus accepted.

Truly, an offering of leavened bread! After that one ceases to wonder
that the Japanese merchant gets the reputation of being occasionally
"slim," There is no need to discuss this teaching. It bears its own
reprobation on its face.

But one can see from this paragraph, where the Christian, with an almost
identical creed, but one based on a sure rock of historical fact, and
with a consequently more robust faith, and a morality which need fear
nothing, will find his message to deliver to the Shinshu. One can see,
too, where the conversion of the Shinshu must begin. It is a case for
"purging out the leaven," and when the purging has been done, one of the
great obstacles in the way of the recognition of Christ will have been
removed. There are always some, however, who will not come to the Light,
"lest their deeds should be reproved."
