### *Sōzoku*.

(§§ 83–85)

It is necessary that the Faith in Amida once implanted in the heart
should be kept alive. Man's heart is changeable and fickle, but there
are means whereby the Faith may be prevented from decaying within us.

The Shinshu enumerates five such means (*go shō gyō* \#).

These are,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. The Recitation of the Nembutsu,

2\. The Reading of the Scriptures (*dokukyō*),

3\. The cultivation of the feeling of joy which comes from allowing the
imagination to dwell upon the bliss of Paradise,

4\. The worship and adoration of the images and pictures of Amida,

5\. The consorting with like-minded believers, and speaking of the
praises of Amida.

</div>

The Shinshuists are said to feel very strongly about the last of these
"means of grace." More than all other Buddhists, they are said to object
to mixed marriages with those who do not belong to the "household" of
the Shinshu.
