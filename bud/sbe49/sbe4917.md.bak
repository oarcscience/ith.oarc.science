## BOOK XV.

 

   1. Daily praised by all the various heavenly beings, the perfectly
Wise One\[1\] thus passed that period of seven days which is designated
'the aliment of joy\[2\].'

   2. He then passed the second week, while he was bathed with jars full
of water by the heavenly beings, the Bodhisattvas and the rest.

   3. Then having bathed in the four oceans and being seated on his
throne, he passed the third week restraining his eyes from seeing.

   4. In the fourth week, assuming many forms, he stood triumphant on
his throne, having delivered a being who was ready to be converted.

   5. A god named Sama*m*takusuma, bearing an offering of flowers, thus
addressed with folded hands the great Buddha who was seated there:

   6. 'What is the name, O holy one, of this meditation, engaged in
which thou hast thus passed four whole weeks with joy, deeply
pondering?'

   7. 'This is designated, O divine being, "the array\[3\] of the
aliment of great joy," like an inaugurated king, who has overcome his
enemies and enjoys prosperity.'

   8. Having said this, the saint possessing the ten

3\. Vyûha.\]

<span id="p. 160">{p. 160}</span>

pre-eminent powers, full of joy, continued, 'The former perfect Buddhas
also did not leave the Bodhi tree.

   9. 'Here the Kle*s*as and the Mâras together with ignorance and the
Âsravas have been conquered by me; and perfect wisdom has been attained
able to deliver the world.

   10. 'I too, resolved to follow the teaching of the former Buddhas,
remained four whole weeks in the fulfilment of my inauguration\[1\].'

   11. Then Mâra, utterly despondent in soul, thus addressed the
Tathâgata, 'O holy one, be pleased to enter Nirvâ*n*a, thy desires are
accomplished.'

   12. 'I will first establish in perfect wisdom worlds as numerous as
the sand, and then I will enter Nirvâ*n*a,' thus did the Buddha reply,
and with a shriek Mâra went to his home.

   13. Then the three daughters of Mâra, Lust, Thirst, and Delight\[2\],
beholding their father with defeated face, approached the Tathâgata.

   14. Lust, with a face like the moon and versed in all the arts of
enchantment, tried to infatuate him by her descriptions of the pleasures
of a householder's life.

   15. 'Think, "If I abandon an emperor's happiness, with what paltry
happiness shall I have to content myself? When success is lost, what
shall I have to enjoy?"--and come and take refuge with us.

   16. 'Else, in bitter repentance, thou wilt remember me hereafter,
when thou art fallen.'--But he listened

\[1. Query abhishekâdikâryata*h*?

3\. Cf. also Lalitav. XXIV (arati?)\]

<span id="p. 161">{p. 161}</span>

not to her words, closing his eyes in deep meditation like one who is
sleepy.

   17. Then Thirst, shameless like one distressed with thirst, thus
addressed him who was free from all thirst: 'Fie, fie, thou hast
abandoned thy family duties, thou hast fallen from all social
obligations;

   18. 'Without power no asceticism, sacrifice, or vow can be
accomplished,--those great *Ri*shis Brahman and the rest, because they
were endowed with power, enjoy their present triumph.

   19. 'Know me to be the power called Thirst\[1\], and worship thirst
accordingly; else I will clasp thee with all my might and fling away thy
life.'

   20. Motionless as one almost dead, he continued in meditation,
remembering the former Buddhas; then Delight next tried to win him who
was indeed hard to be won by evil deeds.

   21. 'O holy one, I am Delight by name, fostering all practicable
delights,--therefore making me the female mendicant's tutelary power,
bring delight within thy reach.'

   22. But whether flattered or threatened, whether she uttered curses
or blessings, he remained absorbed in meditation, perfectly tranquil
like one who has entered Nirvâ*n*a.

   23. Then the three, with despondent faces, having retired together on
one side, consulted with one another and came forward wearing the
appearance of youthful beauty.

   24. Folding their hands in reverence they thus addressed the
Tathâgata, 'O holy one, receive us as religious mendicants, we are come
to thy one refuge.

<span class="small">\[1. Sc. Desire.\]</span>

<span id="p. 162">{p. 162}</span>

   25. 'Having heard the fame of thy achievements, we, the daughters of
Namu*k*i, have come from the golden city, abandoning the life of a
household.

   26. 'We are desirous of repressing the teaching of our five hundred
brothers,--we would be freed from a master, as thou thyself art freed
from all passions.'

   27. Having his mind continually guided by the conduct which leads to
Nirvâ*n*a, and setting himself to remember the (former) Buddhas, he kept
his eyes closed, absorbed in meditation.

   28. Then again, having resolved on their new plan in concert, these
enchantresses, assuming an older aspect, approached once more to delude
him.

   29. 'We have come here after wandering under the dismal avatâra of
slaves\[1\],--thou art the avatâra of Buddha,--do thou establish us,
mature, in the true Buddha doctrine.

   30. 'We are women of older age, much to be pitied, bewildered by the
fear of death,--we are therefore worthy to be established in that
doctrine of Nirvâ*n*a which puts an end to all future births.'

   31. These words of the enchantresses were heard by him, yet he felt
no anger; but they all became the victims of old age, through the
manifestation of his divine power.

   32. Having beheld him plunged in meditation, immovable like the
mountain Meru,--they turned away their faces and they could not retain
their beauty.

   33. Bending their feet, with decrepit limbs, they

<span class="small">\[1. I read dâsa- for dâ*s*a-; could there be a
reference to the ten avatâras?\]</span>

<span id="p. 163">{p. 163}</span>

thus addressed their father: 'O father, do thou, the lord of the world
of Desire, restore us to our own forms.'

   34. His daughters were dear, but he had no power to alter the effect
of the will of Buddha; then their father said to them, 'Go to the refuge
which he gives.'

   35. Then they in various guises, bent humbly at his feet, implored
the perfect Buddha, 'Pardon our transgression, whose minds were
intoxicated with youth.'

   36. The teacher, that mine of Forgiveness, in silence restored them
by his will; and having repeatedly worshipped and praised him they went
joyfully to their home.

   37. Then again Mâra, the lord of the world of Desire, lost to shame,
taking the form of the head of a family, thus addressed him from the
sky:

   38. 'I worshipped thee long ago, foretelling that thou wouldest
become a Buddha; and by my blessings thou hast to-day become Buddha
Tathâgata.

   39. 'As thou didst come from thine own kingdom, so now having
returned as Tathâgata, with a name corresponding to the reality be a
king Tathâgata.

   40. 'Having gone to that royal station, do thou meditate on the three
jewels, and cherish thy father and mother, and delight Ya*s*odharâ,--

   41. 'Possessed of a thousand sons, and able to deliver the world, be
successively the supreme lord of every world from the Yâma heaven
onwards\[1\].

   42. 'Having become also the supreme lord of all

<span class="small">\[1. Mâra rules the four heavens from the Yâma to
the Paranirmitava*s*avartin, Mahâbrahman the twenty Brahmalokas above
them.\]</span>

<span id="p. 164">{p. 164}</span>

Bodhisattvas, thou shalt attain Nirvâ*n*a; O wise seer, repair to the
hermitage of Kapila in order to beget those sons.

   43. 'As thou art the king of the Law, so shall thy sons also be all
Tathâgatas, and all the activity and cessation of existence shall depend
upon thee, O *G*ina.'

   44. To him thus speaking the All-wise replied, Hear, O shameless one;
thou art Mâra,--not the head of a clan, the upholder of the race of the
*S*âkyas.

   45. 'A host like thee, though they came in myriads, could not harm
me,--I will go to my kingdom gradually, I will bring the world to
perfect happiness.

   46. 'Thou art utterly vanquished, O Namu*k*i, go back to thy own
home; I will go hence to turn the wheel of the Law in Vârâ*n*asî.'

   47. He, on hearing this command, saying with a deep sigh, 'Alas! I am
crushed,' left him and went despondent and companionless through the sky
to his home.

   48. Then he, the conqueror of Mâra, rising from that throne, set
forth to journey alone to the holy Vârâ*n*asî.

   49. The heavens became covered with clouds when they saw the chief of
saints, and the king of the Nâgas Mu*k*ilinda made a petition in
reverential faith:

   50. 'O holy one, thou art all-wise, there will be stormy weather for
seven days,--wind, rain, and darkness,--dwell for the time in my abode.'

   51. Though himself possessed of all supernatural power, the holy one
thought of the world still involved in embodied existence, and sitting
on that jewel-seat he remained absorbed in contemplation.

<span id="p. 165">{p. 165}</span>

   52. That king of the Nâgas there protected the Buddha, who is himself
the source of all protection, from the rain, wind, and darkness,
covering his body with his own hood.

   53. When the seven days were past and the Nâga had paid his homage
and was gone, the *G*ina proceeded to the bank of a river, near a forest
of goat-herds\[1\].

   54. As the Sugata stayed there during the night, a deity, who bore
the name of the Indian fig-tree, came up to him, illumining the spot
where he was, and thus addressed him with folded hands:

   55. 'The fig-tree was planted by me when I was born as a man, bearing
the name of Buddha; and it has been fostered like the Bodhi tree in the
hope of delivering myself from evil.

   56. 'By the merit of that action I myself have been born in heaven;
in kindness to me, O my lord, do thou dwell seven days in triumph here.'

   57. 'So be it,' said the chief of all saints, the true Kalpa tree to
grant the wishes of the faithful votary, and he stayed under the
fig-tree, absorbed in contemplation, spreading lustre around like a full
moon.

   58. There he dwelt seven days; and then in a forest of Datura trees,
sitting at the foot of a palm, he remained absorbed in contemplation.

   59. Spending thus in different spots his weeks of meditation, day and
night, the great saint, pondering and fasting, went on in his way,
longing to accomplish the world's salvation.

   60. Then two wealthy merchants from the land

<span class="small">\[1. A*g*apâlaka is in Pâli costus speciosus; bit it
may here be a proper name.\]</span>

<span id="p. 166">{p. 166}</span>

of Uttara Utkala\[1\], named Trapusha and Bhallika, journeying with five
hundred waggons,

   61. Being freed from a sin which involved a birth as pretas\[2\],
both joyfully worshipped Buddha with an offering of the three sweet
substancess\[3\] and milk; and they obtained thereby auspicious
blessings.

   62. They obtained pieces of his nails and hairs for a *K*aitya and
they also received a prophecy of their future birth, and having received
the additional promise, 'Ye shall also obtain a stone\[4\],' they then
proceeded on their way elsewhere.

   63. Then Buddha accepted alms in his bowl, offered by the goddess who
dwelt in the Datura grove, and he blessed her with benedictions.

   64. The *G*ina then blessed the four bowls as one, which were offered
by the four Mahârâ*g*as\[5\], and ate with pleasure the offering of
milk.

   65. Then one day the *G*ina ate there an Harîtakî fruit\[6\] which
was offered to him by *S*akra, and having planted the seed he caused it
to grow to a tree.

   66. The king of the Devas carried the news thereof joyfully to the
Deva-heavens; and gods, men, and demons watered it with reverential
circurnambulations.

   67. On hearing the news of the Harîtakî seed, and remembering the
whole history from first to last, a daughter of the gods named Bhadrikâ,
who had been a cow in her former birth\[7\], came from heaven.

\[1. Northern Orissa.

6\. Terminalia chebula.

7\. Cf. Mahâbh. V, 7553.\]

<span id="p. 167">{p. 167}</span>

   68. She, the daughter of the gods, smiling with her companions, thus
addressed the *G*ina, bringing him a garment of rags, dependent from a
bough:

   69. 'I beg to bring to thy notice--what? O Buddha!--accept this
garment of rags, by whose influence I am now a daughter of heaven named
Bhadrikâ.'

   70. 'By the further development of this merit thou shalt become a
Bodhisattva'--uttering this blessing the Teacher accepted the rags.

   71. Beholding the tattered rags, the gods, crowding in the sky,
filled with woncer, and uttering cries of hi hi, flung down upon him
garments of heavenly silk.

   72. 'These are not fit for a religious mendicant,'--so saying, he did
not accept even one of them,--only thinking in his calm apathy, 'these
are fit for imperial pomp and a householder's luxury.'

   73. He desired a stone slab and some water in order to wash the dirt
away,--*S*akra at that moment dug out a great river full of water;

   74. And four stones are brought to him by the four Mahârâ*g*as,--on
one he himself sat, on another he performed the washing;

   75. On another he performed the drying, and another he flung up into
the sky; the stone as it flew up reached the blazing city\[1\] and
astonished all the worlds.

   76. After paying their worship in many ways, Trapusha and Bhallika
duly raised an excellent *K*aitya and they called it *S*ilâgarbha.

   77. The ascetics of that neighbourhood paid their

<span class="small">\[1. The sun: or the sphere of fire?\]</span>

<span id="p. 168">{p. 168}</span>

homage to the 'Three Stones' when they were made into a *K*aitya, and
the noble stream flowed widely known as the 'Holy River.'

   78. Those who bathe and offer their worship in the holy river and
reverence the *K*aitya. of the three stones, become great-souled
Bodhisattvas and obtain Nirvâ*n*a.

   79. Then seated under a palm-tree the holy one pondered: 'The
profound wisdom so hard to be understood is now known by me.

   80. 'These sin-defiled worlds understand not this most excellent
(Law), and the unenlightened shamelessly censure both me and my wisdom.

   81. 'Shall I proclaim the Law? It is only produced by knowledge;
having attained it thus in my lonely pondering, do I feel strong enough
to deliver the world?'

   82. Having remembered all that he had heard before, he again
pondered; and resolving, 'I will explain it for the sake of delivering
the world,'

   83. Buddha, the chief of saints, absorbed in contemplation, shone
forth, arousing\[1\] the world, having emitted in the darkness of the
night a light from the tuft of hair between his eyebrows.

   84. When it became dawn, Brahman and the other gods, and the various
rulers of the different worlds, besought Sugata to turn the wheel of the
Law.

   85. When the *G*ina by his silence uttered an assenting 'so be it,'
they returned to their own abodes; and the lion of the *S*âkyas also
shone there, still remaining lost in contemplation.

   86. Then the four divinities (of the Bodhi tree),

<span class="small">\[1. Cf. *s*loka 118.\]</span>

<span id="p. 169">{p. 169}</span>

Dharmaru*k*i and the rest, addressed him, 'Where, O teacher of the
world, will the holy one turn the wheel of the Law?'

   87. 'In Vârâ*n*asî, in the Deer Park will I turn the wheel of the
Law; seated in the fourth posture\[1\] O deities, I will deliver the
world.'

   88. There the holy one, the bull of the *S*âkya race, pondered, 'For
whom shall I first turn the wheel of the Law?'

   89. The glorious one reflected that \[2\]Rudraka and Arâ*d*a were
dead\[3\], and then he remembered those others, the five men united in a
worthy society\[4\], who dwelt at Kâ*s*î.

   90. Then Buddha set out to go joyfully to Kâ*s*î, manifesting as he
went the manifold supernatural course of life of Magadha.

   91. Having made a mendicant (whom he met) happy in the path of those
who are illustrious through the Law, the glorious one went on,
illumining the country which lies to the north of Gayâ.

   92. (Having stayed) in the dwelling of the prince of the Nâgas, named
Sudar*s*ana, on the occurrence of night, he ate a morning meal
consisting of the five kinds of ambrosia, and departed, gladdening him
with his blessing.

   93. Near Va*n*ârâ\[5\] he went under the shadow

\[1. Sc. the padmâsana (Yoga-sûtras II, 46), described as that in which
the left foot is bent between the right leg and thigh, and the right
foot is bent between the left foot and thigh.

3\. Nirvâtau.

Lalitav. p. 528?\]

<span id="p. 170">{p. 170}</span>

of a tree and there he established a poor Brâhman named Nandin in sacred
knowledge.

   94. In Va*n*ârâ in a householder's dwelling he was lodged for the
night; in the morning he partook of some milk and departed, having given
his blessing.

   95. In the village called Vu*m*dadvira he lodged in the abode of a
Yaksha named Vu*m*da\[1\], and in the morning after taking some milk and
giving his blessing he departed.

   96. Next was the garden named Rohitavastuka, and there the Nâga-king
Kama*nd*alu with his courtiers also worshipped him.

   97. Having delivered various beings in every place, the compassionate
saint journeyed on to Gandhapura and was worshipped there by the Yaksha
Gandha.

   98. When he arrived at the city Sârathi, the citizens volunteered to
be charioteers in his service; thence he came to the Ganges, and he bade
the ferryman cross.

   99. 'Good man, convey me across the Ganges, may the seven blessings
be thine.' 'I carry no one across unless he pays the fee.'

   100. 'I have nothing, what shall I give?' So saying he went through
the sky like the king of birds; and from that time Bimbisâra abolished
the ferry-fee for all ascetics.

   101. Then having entered Vârâ*n*asî, the *G*ina, illumining the city
with his light, filled the minds of all the inhabitants of Kâ*s*î with
excessive interest.

<span class="small">\[1. This may be *K*u*m*da.\]</span>

<span id="p. 171">{p. 171}</span>

   102. In the *S*ankhamedhîya garden, the king of righteousness,
absorbed in meditation, passed the night, gladdening like the moon all
those who were astonished at his appearance.

   103. The next day at the end of the second watch\[1\], having gone
his begging round collecting alms, he, the unequalled one, like Hari,
proceeded to the Deer Park.

   104. The five disciples united in a worthy society\[2\], when they
beheld him, said to, one another, 'This is Gautama who has come hither,
the ascetic who has abandoned his self-control.

   105. 'He wanders about now, greedy\[3\], of impure soul, unstable and
with his senses under no firm control, devoted to inquiries regarding
the frying-pan.

   106. 'We will not ask after his health, nor rise to meet him, nor
address him, nor offer him a welcome, nor a seat, nor bid him enter into
our dwelling.'

   107. Having understood their agreement, with a smiling countenance,
spreading light all around, Buddha advanced gradually nearer, holding
his staff and his begging-pot.

   108. Forgetful of their agreement, the five friends, under his
constraining majesty, rose up like birds in their cages when scorched by
fire.

   109. Having taken his begging-bowl and staff, they gave him an
arghya, and water for washing his feet and rinsing his mouth; and bowing

\[1. Does thi yâmadvaye mean at noon, courting the ahorâtra from sunrise
to sunrise?

2\. Cf. supra, 89.

3\. Or perhaps 'irregular.'\]

<span id="p. 172">{p. 172}</span>

reverentially they said to him, 'Honoured Sir, health to thee.'

   110. 'Health in every respect is ours,--that wisdom has been attained
which is so hard to be won,'--so saying, the holy one thus spoke to the
five worthy associates:

   111. 'But address me not as "worthy Sir," know that I am a *G*ina,--I
have come to give the first wheel of the Law to you. Receive initiation
from me,--ye shall obtain the place of Nirvâ*n*a.'

   112. Then the five, pure in heart, begged leave to undertake his vow
of a religious life; and the Buddha, touching their heads, received them
into the mendicant order.

   113. Then at the mendicants' respectful request the chief of saints
bathed in the tank, and after eating ambrosia he reflected on the field
of the Law\[1\].

   114. Remembering that the Deer Park and the field of the *G*ina were
there, he went joyfully with them and pointed out the sacred seats.

   115. Having worshipped three seats, he desired to visit the fourth,
and when the worthy disciples asked about it, the teacher thus addressed
them:

   116. 'These are the four seats of the Buddhas of the (present) Bhadra
Age,--three Buddhas have passed therein, and I here am the fourth
possessor of the ten powers.'

   117. Having thus addressed them the glorious one bowed to that throne
of the Law, decked with tapestries of cloth and silk, and having its
stone

<span class="small">\[1. Does this mean the country round Benares, as
the land where all Buddhas turned the wheel of the Law?\]</span>

<span id="p. 173">{p. 173}</span>

inlaid with jewels, like a golden mountain, guarded by the kings of
kings,

   In the former fortnight of Âshâ*dh*a, on the day consecrated to the
Regent of Jupiter, on the lunar day sacred to Vish*n*u, and on an
auspicious conjunction, under the asterism Anurâdhâ\[1\], and in the
muhûrta called the Victorious, in the night,--he took his stand on the
throne.

   118. The five worthy disciples stood in front, with joyful minds,
paying their homage, and the son of *S*uddhodana performed that act of
meditation which is called the Arouser of all worlds;

   Brâhman and the other gods came surrounded by their attendants,
summoned each from his own world; and Maitrîya\[2\] with the deities of
the Tushita heaven came for the turning of the wheel of the Law.

   119. So too when the multitude of the sons of the *G*inas and the
*S*ûras gathered together from the ten directions of space, there came
also the noble chief of the sons of the *G*inas, named
Dharma*k*akra\[3\], carrying the wheel of the Law;

   With head reverentially bowed, having placed it, a mass of gold and
jewels, before the Buddha and having worshipped him, he thus besought
him, 'O thou lord of saints, turn the wheel of the Law as it has been
done by (former) Sugatas.'
