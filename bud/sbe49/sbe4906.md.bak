## BOOK IV.

 

   1. Then from that city-garden, with their eyes restless in
excitement, the women went out to meet the prince as a newly-arrived
bridegroom;

   2. And when they came up to him, their eyes wide open in wonder, they
performed their due homage with hands folded like a lotus-calyx.

   3. Then they stood surrounding him, their minds overpowered by
passion, as if they were drinking him in with their eyes motionless and
blossoming wide with love.

   4. Some of the women verily thought that he was Kâma
incarnate,--decorated as he was with his brilliant signs as with connate
ornaments.

   5. Others thought from his gentleness and majesty that it was the
moon with its ambrosial beams as it were visibly come down to the earth.

   6. Others, smitten by his beauty, yawned\[1\] as if to swallow him,
and fixing their eyes on each other, softly sighed.

   7. Thus the women only looked upon him, simply gazing with their
eyes,--they spoke not, nor did they smile, controlled by his power.

   8. But having seen them thus listless, bewildered in their love, the
wise son of the family priest, Udâyin, thus addressed them:

   9. 'Ye are all skilled in all the graceful arts,

<span class="small">\[1. Cf. Sâhitya Darp. § 155, 13.\]</span>

<span id="p. 38">{p. 38}</span>

proficients in understanding the language of amorous sentiments,
possessed of beauty and gracefulness, thorough masters in your own
styles.

   10. 'With these graces of yours ye may embellish even the Northern
Kurus, yea, even the dances\[1\] of Kuvera, much more this little earth.

   11. 'Ye are able to move even sages who have lost all their desires,
and to ensnare even the gods who are charmed by heavenly nymphs.

   12. 'By your skill in expressing the heart's feelings, by your
coquetry, your grace, and your perfect beauty, ye are able to enrapture
even women, how much more easily men.

   13. 'You thus skilled as ye are, each set\[2\] in her own proper
sphere,--such as this is your power,--I am not satisfied with your
simplicity \[when you profess to find him beyond your reach\].

   14. 'This timid action of yours would be fit for new brides, their
eyes closed through shame,--or it might be a blandishment worthy even of
the wives of the cowherds\[3\].

   15. 'What though this hero be great by his exalted glory, yet "great
is the might of women," let this be your firm resolve.

   16. 'In olden time a great seer, hard to be conquered even by the
gods, was spurned by a harlot, the beauty of Kâ*s*i, planting her feet
upon him.

   17. 'The Bhikshu Manthâlagautama was also formerly spurned by
Bâlamukhyâ with her leg,

\[1. Professor Bühler suggests *k*âkrî*d*am, cf. *s*loka 28.

2\. I read niyuktânâm for viyuktânâm.

3\. Is this a reference to K*ri*sh*n*a's story? but cf. Weber, Ind.
Antiquary, vol. v, p. 254.\]

<span id="p. 39">{p. 39}</span>

and wishing to please her he carried out dead bodies for her sake to be
buried.

   18. 'And a woman low in standing and caste fascinated the great seer
Gautama, though a master of long penances and old in years.

   19. 'So *S*ântâ\[1\] by her various wiles captivated and subdued the
sage's son *Ri*shya*sri*nga, unskilled in women's ways.

   20. 'And the great seer Vi*s*vâmitra, though plunged in a profound
penance\[2\], was carried captive for ten years in the forests by the
nymph Gh*ri*tâ*k*î\[3\].

   21. 'Many such seers as these have women brought to shame,--how much
more then a delicate prince in the first flower of his age?

   22. 'This being so, boldly put forth your efforts that the prosperity
of the king's family may not be turned away from him.

   23. 'Ordinary women captivate similar lovers; but they are truly
women who subdue the natures of high and low.'

   24. Having heard these words of Udâyin these women as stung to the
heart rose even above themselves for the conquest of the prince.

   25. With their brows, their glances, their coquetries, their smiles,
their delicate movements, they made all sorts of significant gestures
like women utterly terrified.

   26. But they soon regained their confidence\[4\] through the command
of the king and the gentle temperament of the prince, and through the
power of intoxication and of love.

4\. Lit. 'dispelled their want of confidence.'\]

<span id="p. 40">{p. 40}</span>

   27. Then surrounded by troops of women the prince wandered in the
wood like an elephant in the forests of Himavat accompanied by a herd of
females.

   28. Attended by the women he shone in that pleasant grove, as the sun
surrounded by Apsarasas in his royal garden.

   29. There some of them, urged by passion, pressed him with their full
firm bosoms in gentle collisions.

   30. Another violently embraced him after making a pretended
stumble,--leaning on him with her shoulders drooping down, and with her
gentle creeper-like arms dependent.

   31. Another with her mouth smelling of spirituous liquor, her lower
lip red like copper, whispered in his ear, 'Let my secret be heard.'

   32. Another, all wet with unguents, as if giving him her command,
clasped his hand eagerly and said, 'Perform thy rites of adoration
here.'

   33. Another, with her blue garments continually slipping down in
pretended intoxication, stood conspicuous with her tongue visible like
the night with its lightning flashing.

   34. Others, with their golden zones tinkling, wandered about here and
there, showing to him their hips veiled with thin cloth.

   35. Others leaned, holding a mango-bough in full flower, displaying
their bosoms like golden jars.

   36. Another, coming from a lotus-bed, carrying lotuses and with eyes
like lotuses, stood like the lotus-goddess Padmâ, by the side of that
lotus-faced prince.

   37. Another sang a sweet song easily understood and with the proper
gesticulations, rousing

<span id="p. 41">{p. 41}</span>

him, self-subdued though he was, by her glances, as saying, 'O how thou
art deluded.'

   38. Another, having armed herself\[1\] with her bright face, with its
brow-bow drawn to its full, imitated his action, as playing the hero.

   39. Another, with beautiful full bosoms, and having her earrings
waving in the wind\[2\], laughed loudly at him, as if saying, 'Catch me,
sir, if you can!'

   40. Some, as he was going away, bound him with strings of
garlands,--others punished him with words like an elephant-driver's
hook, gentle yet reproachful.

   41. Another, wishing to argue with him, seizing a mango-spray, asked,
all bewildered with passion, 'This flower, whose is it?'

   42. Another, assuming a gait and attitude like those of a man, said
to him, 'Thou who art conquered by women, go and conquer this earth!'

   43. Then another with rolling eyes, smelling a blue lotus, thus
addressed the prince with words slightly indistinct in her excitement,

   44. 'See, my lord, this mango covered with its honey-scented flowers,
where the kokila sings, as if imprisoned in a golden cage.

   45. 'Come and see this a*s*oka tree, which augments lovers'
sorrows,--where the bees make a noise as if they were scorched by fire.

   46. 'Come and see this tilaka tree, embraced by a slender
mango-branch, like a man in a white garment by a woman decked with
yellow unguents.

   47. 'Behold this kuruvaka in flower, bright like

\[1. Prâv*ri*tya.

2\. I read vâtâghûr*n*ita.\]

<span id="p. 42">{p. 42}</span>

fresh\[1\] resin-juice, which bends down as if it felt reproached by the
colour of women's nails\[2\].

   48. 'Come and see this young a*s*oka, covered all over with new
shoots, which stands as it were ashamed at the beauty of our hands.

   49. 'See this lake surrounded by the sinduvâra shrubs growing on its
banks\[3\], like a fair woman reclining, clad in fine white cloth.

   50. 'See the imperial power of females,--yonder ruddy-goose in the
water goes behind his mate following her like a slave.

   51. 'Come and listen to the notes of this intoxicated cuckoo as he
sings, while another cuckoo sings as if consenting, wholly without care.

   52. 'Would that thine was the intoxication of the birds which the
spring produces,--and not the thought of a thinking man, ever pondering
how wise he is!'

   53. Thus these young women, their souls carried away by love,
assailed the prince with all kinds of stratagems.

   54. But although thus attacked, he, having his senses guarded by
self-control, neither rejoiced nor smiled, thinking anxiously, 'One must
die.'

   55. Having seen them in their real condition\[4\], that best of men
pondered with an undisturbed\[5\] and stedfast mind.

\[1. I read nirmuktam, which might mean 'just exuded,' or the whole
compound may mean (cf. Kum. Sambh. V, 34) 'like a lip which has given up
the use of pinguent.'

2\. Cf. Vikramorva*s*î, Act 11, strî-nakha-pâ*t*ala*m* kuruvakam.

3\. I read tîra*g*ai*h* sinduvârakai*h*.

4\. For vasthânam cf. Maitri Upan. (Comm.) VI, 1.

5\. I would read asa*m*vignena.\]

<span id="p. 43">{p. 43}</span>

   56. 'What is it that these women lack\[1\] that they perceive not
that youth is fickle? for this old age will destroy whatever has beauty.

   57. 'Verily they do not see any one's plunge into disease, and so
dismissing fear, they are joyous in a world which is all pain.

   58. 'Evidently they know nothing of death which carries all away; and
so at ease and without distress they can sport and laugh.

   59. 'What rational being, who knows of old age, death and sickness,
could stand\[2\] or sit down at his ease or sleep, far less laugh?

   60. 'But he verily is like one bereft of sense, who, beholding
another aged or sick or dead, remains self-possessed and not afflicted.

   61. '(So) even when a tree is deprived of its flowers and fruits, or
if it is cut down and falls, no other tree sorrows.'

   62. Seeing him thus absorbed in contemplation, with his desires
estranged from all worldly objects, Udâyin, well skilled in the rules of
policy, with kindly feelings addressed him:

   63. 'Since I was appointed by the king as a fitting friend for thee,
therefore I have a wish to speak to thee in this friendliness of my
heart.

   64. 'To hinder from what is disadvantageous,--to urge to what is
advantageous,--and not to forsake in misfortune,--these are the three
marks of a friend.

   65. 'If I, after having promised my friendship, were not to heed when
thou turnest away from the great end of man, there would be no
friendship in me.

\[1. Ki*m* vinâ.

2\. I would conjecture tish*th*en.\]

<span id="p. 44">{p. 44}</span>

   66. 'Therefore I speak as thy friend,--such rudeness as this to women
is not befitting for one young in years and graceful in person.

   67. 'It is right to woo a woman even by guile,--this is useful both
for getting rid of shame and for one's own enjoyment.

   68. 'Reverential behaviour and compliance with her wishes are what
binds a woman's heart; good qualities truly are a cause of love, and
women love respect.

   69. 'Wilt thou not then, O large-eyed prince, even if thy heart is
unwilling, seek to please them with a courtesy worthy of this beauty of
thine?

   70. 'Courtesy is the balm of women, courtesy is the best ornament;
beauty without courtesy is like a grove without flowers.

   71. 'But of what use is courtesy by itself? let it be assisted by the
heart's feelings; surely, when worldly objects so hard to attain are in
thy grasp, thou wilt not despise them.

   72. 'Knowing that pleasure was the best of objects, even the god
Pura*m*dara (Indra) wooed in olden time Ahalyâ the wife of the saint
Gautama.

   73. 'So too Agastya wooed Rohi*n*î, the wife of Soma; and therefore,
as *S*ruti saith, a like thing befell Lopâmudrâ\[1\].

   74. 'The great ascetic V*ri*haspati begot Bharadvâ*g*a on Mamatâ the
daughter of the Maruts, the wife of Autathya\[2\].

\[1. Agastya's wife. This seems to refer to Lopâmudrâ's words to her
husband in Rig-veda I, 179; cf. also Mahâbh. III, xcvii.

2\. this should be Utathya (cf. Mahâbh. I, civ). Mamatâ had Dîrghatamas
by her husband and Bharadvâ*g*a by V*ri*haspati. The MSS. read Samatâ.\]

<span id="p. 45">{p. 45}</span>

   75. 'The Moon, the best of offerers, begat Budha of divine nature on
the spouse of V*ri*haspati as she was offering a libation\[1\].

   76. 'So too in old time Parâ*s*ara, overpowered by passion on the
bank of the Yamunâ, lay with the maiden Kâlî who was the daughter of the
son of the Water (Agni).

   77. 'The sage Va*s*ish*th*a through lust begot a son Kapi*ñg*alâda on
Akshamâlâ a despised low-caste woman\[2\].

   78. 'And the seer-king Yayâti, even when the vigour of his prime was
gone, sported in the *K*aitraratha forest with the Apsaras Vi*s*vâ*k*î.

   79. 'And the Kaurava king Pâ*nd*u, though he knew that intercourse
with his wife would end in death, yet overcome by the beauty and good
qualities of Mâdrî yielded to the pleasures of love.

   80. 'And so Karâla*g*anaka, when he carried off the Brâhman's
daughter, incurred loss of caste thereby, but he would not give up his
love.

   81. 'Great heroes such as these pursued even contemptible desires for
the sake of pleasure, how much more so when they are praiseworthy of
their kind?

   82. 'And yet thou, a young man, possessed of strength and beauty,
despisest enjoyments which rightly belong to thee, and to which the
whole world is devoted.'

   83. Having heard these specious words of his, well-supported by
sacred tradition, the prince made reply, in a voice like the thundering
of a cloud:

\[1. She is called Târâ, Vish*n*u Pur. IV, 6.

2\. Manu IX, 23.\]

<span id="p. 46">{p. 46}</span>

   84. 'This speech manifesting affection is well-befitting in thee; but
I will convince thee as to where thou wrongly judgest me.

   85. 'I do not despise worldly objects, I know that all mankind are
bound up therein; but remembering that the world is transitory, my mind
cannot find pleasure in them.

   86. 'Old age, disease, and death--if these three things did not
exist, I too should find my enjoyment in the objects that please the
mind.

   87. 'Yet even though this beauty of women were to remain perpetual,
still delight in the pleasures of desire would not be worthy of the wise
man.

   88. 'But since their beauty will be drunk up by old age, to delight
therein through infatuation cannot be a thing approved even by
thyself\[1\].

   89. 'He who himself subject to death, disease, and old age, can sport
undisturbed with those whose very nature implies death, disease, and old
age, such a man is on a level with birds and beasts.

   90. 'And as for what thou sayest as to even those great men having
become victims to desire, do not be bewildered by them, for destruction
was also their lot.

   91. 'Real greatness is not to be found there, where there is
universally destruction, or where there is attachment to earthly
objects, or a want of self-control.

   92. 'And when thou sayest, "Let one deal with women even by guile," I
know nought about guile, even if it be accompanied with courtesy.

   93. 'That compliance too with a woman's wishes

<span class="small">\[1. Or 'even by the soul.'\]</span>

<span id="p. 47">{p. 47}</span>

pleases me not, if truthfulness be not there; if there be not a union
with one's whole soul and nature, then "out upon it" say I.

   94. 'A soul overpowered by passion, believing in falsehood, carried
away by attachment and blind to the faults of its objects,--what is
there in it worth being deceived?

   95. 'And if the victims of passion do deceive one another,--are not
men unfit for women to look at and women for men?

   96. Since then these things are so, thou surely wouldest not lead me
astray into ignoble pleasures,--me afflicted by sorrow, and subject to
old age and death?

   97. 'Ah! thy mind must be very firm and strong, if thou canst find
substance in the transitory pleasures of sense; even in the midst of
violent alarm thou canst cling to worldly objects, when thou seest all
created beings in the road of death.

   98. 'But I am fearful and exceedingly bewildered, as I ponder the
terrors of old age, death, and disease; I can find no peace, no
self-command, much less can I find pleasure, while I see the world as it
were ablaze with fire.

   99. 'If desire arises in the heart of the man, who knows that death
is certain,--I think that his soul must be made of iron, who restrains
it in this great terror and does not weep.'

   100. Then the prince uttered a discourse full of resolve and
abolishing the objects of desire; and the lord of day, whose orb is the
worthy centre of human eyes, departed to the Western Mountain.

   101. And the women, having worn their garlands and ornaments in vain,
with their graceful arts and

<span id="p. 48">{p. 48}</span>

endearments all fruitless, concealing their love deep in their
hearts\[1\], returned to the city with broken hopes.

   102. Having thus seen the beauty\[2\] of the troop of women who had
gone out to the city-garden, now withdrawn in the evening,--the prince,
pondering the transitoriness which envelopes all things, entered his
dwelling.

   103. Then the king, when he heard how his mind turned away from all
objects of sense, could not lie down all that night, like an elephant
with an arrow in its heart; but wearied in all sorts of consultation, he
and his ministers could find no other means beside these (despised)
pleasures to restrain his son's purpose.
