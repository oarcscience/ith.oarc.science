<p>164. These three things are expounded unto us by Donran Daishi. First, that faith is not holiness, for faith is not abiding. At one time it abideth, at another it is gone.</p>  
<p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A></p>  
<p>165. And second: This faith is not Single Minded, for it hath not resolution.</p>  
<p>And third: It continueth not, for the other thoughts of the heart divide it against itself.</p>  
<p>166. The three ways of this faith lead the one to the other one. On this must the believer fix his eyes. If his faith is not in holiness, then hath he not the faith of resolution.</p>  
<p>167. And having not the faith that is resolute, that faith cannot endure, and because it endureth not, how can he attain unto the faith of determination? And attaining not unto the faith of determination, the faith is not sanctified in him.</p>  
<p>168. For the attainment of Right Practice expounded by the Master of the Written Word is according unto the true faith and this alone.</p>  
<p>169. If a man return into the Great Way of the Divine Promise, eschewing the narrow ways of deeds and works, in him shall the true light of Nirvana be made manifest.</p>  
<p>170. The mighty king So, he of the Ryo line, worshipped the Great Teacher Donran Daishi, naming him the Bodhisattva of Ran, turning his face in worship unto the dwelling-place of his Teacher.</p>
