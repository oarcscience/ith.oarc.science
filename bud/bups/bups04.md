**OF PARADISE**

37\. Seek refuge in the heavenly harmony.

For the jewel groves and gem trees of Paradise give forth a sweet and
most excellent melody in pure and ordered unison.

38\. Seek refuge in the Divine Promise, the Treasury of Merit,

For the seven jewel trees are fragrant in Paradise where the flowers,
the fruits, the branches and the leaves thereof

Cast back their radiance the one to the other.

39\. Bring homage to the perfect Righteousness. As the pure wind blows
over the trees glorious with jewels,

It draweth from them a noble music with fivefold strains of harmony.

40\. In all the world is no place hidden from the glory shed by hundreds
of myriad rays from the heart of every flower of Paradise.

41\. Like unto a golden mountain reflecting the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

myriad rays of these heavenly blossoms, so is the form of the Infinite
One.

42\. From His Sacred Body, as from a wellspring, floweth this light over
the Ten Regions of the world.

By His Sacred teaching He leadeth all having life into the way of light.

43\. Seek refuge in the Treasury of Righteousness.

For in Paradise is that holy lake, with its waters of eightfold Virtue,
all-glorious with the seven jewels. And all this is the inconceivable
handiwork of Purity.

44\. Seek refuge in the All-Honoured.

For when sorrow and sighing are fled away, the Holy Land shall rejoice
with joy and singing. Therefore is it called Paradise.

45\. The Buddhas of the Three Ages and the Ten Regions, they in whom the
Dual Wisdom is perfect and their illumination entire, lead all the
worlds marvellously into the way of Salvation, the Truth being their
Vehicle.

46\. He that seeketh refuge in the Kingdom of the Infinite One is a
citizen of the Kingdom of every Buddha.

Let him that is set free, with single heart give

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

praises unto One Buddha, for in so doing he praiseth all.

47\. The faithful believer at that moment when he rejoiceth in the sound
of the name of the Infinite One hath revealed unto his very eyes the
Buddha of Light.

48\. Let him that hath faith praise the Virtue of the Divine Wisdom.

Let him strive to declare it unto all men that he may offer his
thankfulness for the grace of the Buddha.
