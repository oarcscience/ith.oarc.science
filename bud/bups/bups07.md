**CONCERNING THE LESSER SUTRA**

80\. The Eternal Father is called the Buddha of Infinite Light, because
very mightily He holdeth in safety all beings dwelling in the Ten
Regions of the world who, by His merciful enlightenment, recite His Holy
Name.

having life to trust in the Supernal Virtue of the Holy Name, declaring
that weighed against this even righteous deeds are the lesser good.

One, for even the testimony and the safeguarding that he hath of all the
Buddhas proceed only from the fulfilment of His most merciful promise.

sands of Ganges, guide into a sure trust in the Holy Name those sinful
creatures and evil-hearted that wander in the darkness of this wicked
world bearing the five signs of degeneration upon it.
