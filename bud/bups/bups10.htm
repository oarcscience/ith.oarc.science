<p align="center"><b>OF THANKSGIVING FOR NAGARJUNA, THE</b></p>  
<p align="center"><b>GREAT TEACHER OF INDIA</b></p>  
<p>117. Nagarjuna, the great teacher, setting forth in many excellent writings the praise of the Kingdom of Purity, hath instructed us to recite the Holy Name.</p>  
<p>118. For the Lord Buddha declared in prophecy that in India, in the Southern Parts, should arise a great Teacher, trampling upon the false teachings of affirmation and denial.</p>  
<p>119. Nagarjuna, the Great Teacher, he who mightily set forth the noble doctrine of the greater Vehicle, and himself attained unto that height whereon a man rejoiceth eternally in the Faith, hath very sweetly persuaded men that they should receive the teaching of the Holy Name.</p>  
<p>120. Nagarjuna, that great priest, setting forth</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>the two ways&#8212;the way that is straight and plain, and the way of high austerity, leadeth very gently to the Ark of the Divine Promise such as are driven through the weariness of births and deaths.</p>  
<p>121. He who receiveth this teaching of Nagarjuna the Great Teacher, should recite always the Holy Name, believing the Divine Promise of the Buddha of Infinite Light.</p>  
<p>122. Whoso would quickly attain unto that resting-place where illusion ceaseth, should recite the Holy Name holding his mind in steadfast piety.</p>  
<p>123. One Ark only, that Ark of the Divine Promise of our merciful Father, doth voyage and bear us unto the shore of the eternal peace&#8212;even us who so long have drifted hither and thither in the ocean of birth and death.</p>  
<p>124. This great priest hath in one utterance set forth that the Lord is Ruler indeed of the sacred teaching, and that herein are the holy Bodhisattvas His ministers. Therefore should we bring homage unto our Lord.</p>  
<p>125. The mighty company of the Bodhisattvas utter these words, "When we became wise in holiness, yea, we who have striven through Kalpas unnumbered,</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>126. "Yet could we not root out our earthly desires which are the very seed of birth and death. But through that only way of the meditation of the Highest did we attain unto the final deliverance that hath destroyed all our sin."</p>
