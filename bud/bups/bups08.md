**OF THE MANY SUTRAS CONCERNING THE**

**INFINITE ONE**

85\. Having great pity, our Eternal Father lighteneth the dark night of
ignorance, manifesting Himself in that Land of Joy as the Buddha of
Infinite Light which enlighteneth all the worlds with its immeasurable
glory.

86\. That Lord most compassionate, the Buddha of immeasurable Light, He
who had attained unto the Supreme Wisdom even before the myriads of
Kalpas were, pitying them that know not, made himself manifest in the
Palace of Kapila as the Lord Sakya-muni.

87\. If a man had the duration of all the myriad Kalpas, had he
innumerable tongues and each of these tongues innumerable voices, yet
should he vainly essay the praises of that Blessed One.

88\. The Lord instructeth us that the way into Paradise is straight and
easy. Therefore whoso

receiveth not this Truth is, in verity, called a man that hath not eyes
to see nor ears to hear.

89\. The One true freedom is the Highest, and the Absolute is perfect
freedom. And when we attain unto that freedom, for us shall desire and
doubt vanish away.

90\. When every man is beloved of us, even as the son of our own body,
there is the Universal Mind made perfect in us. And this shall be in
Paradise.

91\. He who is in all things supreme, is Himself Nirvana, and Nirvana is
that true light that abideth in the Land that is to come, but this world
cannot know it.

92\. Our Lord instructeth us that he who rejoiceth in his faith is, in
so doing, in unity with the Highest. For true faith is the seed of
light, and the seed of true light is in itself the potentiality of that
which is Deity.

93\. Whoso trusteth not in the Supreme Wisdom of the Enlightened One,
clinging unto his own purblind knowledge, must suffer by fire for long
Kalpas of ages.
