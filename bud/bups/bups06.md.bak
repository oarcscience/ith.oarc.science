**CONCERNING THE SUTRA OF THE**

**MEDITATION**

71\. That Lord that was made flesh in India, the Lord of great pity,
showing unto Vaidehi, Queen of Magadha, the golden mirror created by his
marvellous power, commanded her to choose the Land of Pure Joy among all
the worlds therein appearing.

72\. Binbisara, he who commanded that an ascetic should be slain before
his pre-ordained time was come, by his own son was imprisoned in a
seven-walled prison as the due recompense of his violence.

73\. Ajāta-Šatru, prince and heir of Magadha, denouncing his mother as a
traitor, with drawn sword ran furiously upon her.

74\. Then said Jīvaka the minister and another with him: "This act is
worthy only of an outcast. For the fame of our race unworthy art thou to
dwell in the Palace." And earnestly did they counsel him to change his
evil purpose.

75\. Laying his hand on his sword-hilt, Jīvaka, the minister, drew
backwards a few steps, steadfastly regarding the prince, that he might
avert

this great sin. And so it was that the prince laid down his sword, and
secluded his mother in a palace.

76\. Certain is it that Ananda with Vaidehi, Devadatta and yet others,
bearing their part in this great sorrow of the royal palace of Magadha,
must needs so suffer that they might know the infinite pity of the
Blessed One, that Lord who in this world made manifest the true
teaching.

77\. And all these wise ones having so received instruction revealed
unto us, who are of all evildoers worst, the true way, the refuge of His
divine promise that absolveth all the sins of men.

78\. For when the full time was come that by the will of our Lord and of
Vaidehi the teaching of the Pure Land should be made known here on
Earth, Ajāta-Šatru, her son, sinned this sin, Varshakara his minister
bearing testimony against it.

79\. It is needful that the heart of a man be opened unto the Faith
universal which He who is Blessed hath shown us, forsaking the belief
that his own works shall save him, for in every man the power to perform
righteous deeds is differing.
