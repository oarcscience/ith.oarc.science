**CONCERNING THE WELFARE OF THE**

**PRESENT WORLD**

94\. He that hath unending pity, the Buddha of Infinite Life, hath given
unto us in the Sutra of Golden Light a teaching concerning long life,
that the way of long life and the welfare of the people might be made
known unto them.

95\. Dengyo-Daishi, he who taught the Tendaishu in the mount of Hiye,
hath compassionately instructed us that we should recite Namuamidabutsu,
that Holiest Name, as a sure shield against the seven sorts of
calamities.

96\. Whoso reciteth the Holy Name, that is higher than all other
virtues, shall be set free from the fetters of the past, the present,
and the future.

97\. To him that reciteth the Holy Name shall be good unending even in
this world, for the sin of his former births is vanquished and his youth
set free from death.

98\. To him that reciteth the Holy Name, shall Brahma and Chakra the
great king bring homage, and about him shall heavenly beings and
benignant deities keep watch throughout the days and nights.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

99\. That man that reciteth the Holy Name shall the four mighty Regents
in Heaven guard through the days and nights against the disturbance of
all evil spirits.

100\. To him that reciteth the Holy Name shall the Deity of the Earth
bring homage, watching over him throughout the day and night, as the
shadow follows its substance.

101\. To him who reciteth the Holy Name, Nanda and Upananda the Naga
Kings, together with their attendant deities shall bring homage,
watching over him throughout the day and night.

102\. To him who reciteth the Holy Name, the King of Death, together
with his ministers in the five worlds, shall do reverence, guarding him
throughout the days and nights.

103\. Mara, the Tempter, he who is Ruler of that heaven where pleasures
are collected, hath sworn unto the Lord to shield him from temptation
who reciteth the Holy Name.

104\. All good deities in Earth and Heaven shall be gracious unto him
who reciteth the Holy Name, shielding him throughout the days and
nights.

105\. All evil spirits in heaven and earth tremble before that believer
who standeth upon the Immutable

promise. For even in this world hath he the mind of Divine Illumination.

10G. Kwannon and Seishi, the Bodhisattvas of incarnate Pity and Wisdom,
together with their companions, innumerable as the sands of Ganges,
shall be beside him who reciteth the Holy Name, even as the shadow
cleaves to the substance.

107\. Within the Light of Buddha of Infinite Light are unnumbered
Buddhas, and of these, each and every one shall shield him who hath
within him the true Faith.

108\. Whoso reciteth the Holy Name shall be surrounded himself by those
Buddhas who cannot be numbered, who in the Ten Regions with joy protect
and guide him.

Upon the Sutra of Suraigama-Samadhi, I, Shinran Shōnin, have uttered
these eight lauds praising the virtue of Seishi the Bodhisattva of
Wisdom.

109\. Seishi, he who is the Bodhisattva of Wisdom, having comprehended
the fullness of the Holiest Name, rising from his seat, prostrated
himself beneath the feet of our Lord, worshipping Him, he and his
fellowship, and thus he spake :

110\. "O my Lord, in the ancient time, before

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

the Kalpas innumerable as the sands of Ganges, there was manifest in
this world a Buddha, and His Name was called—The Buddha of Infinite
Light.

111\. "In His footsteps twelve Buddhas followed, and twelve long Kalpas
have rolled away. And of these Buddhas the last was He that is called
that Buddha in whose glory the Sun and Moon are even as darkness.

112\. "Unto me hath that Buddha revealed the Path of the meditation of
the Supreme—that meditation wherein He instructeth us that all the
Buddhas of all the Ten Regions compassionate as even as a father pitieth
his child.

113\. Whoso seeketh refuge in Buddha, as a child in the bosom of his
mother shall verily perceive Him now or in the time that shall be. And
it shall be soon.

114\. "As a man encompassed by the cloud of incense casteth sweet odours
about him, so he that trusteth in the Holy Promise is spiritually endued
with the Divine Essence.

115\. "When I was initiate in right doing, I attained unto the high way
of that assurance that freed me from birth and death, through the
teaching of the Noble Doctrine of the Holy Name.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

"Therefore in this world, rejoicing, I guide the faithful believer into
the way of Purity."

116\. Now with all praise let us give thanks unto the merciful goodness
of the Bodhisattva of Wisdom.
