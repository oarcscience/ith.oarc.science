### II, 4, 6. THE DADHIVÁHANA-BIRTH.

   "Endowed with color, smell and flavor". This the Master related while
living at Veḷuvana, concerning a traitor. The matter is like that told
above. The Master furthermore (said): "O bhikkhus! association with the
wicked is certainly bad and pernicious; but what avails is it to speak
about the perniciousness to human beings of reprobate association?
formerly, even the sweet-flavored senseless amba-tree, whose flavor is
equal to the divine flavor, having come <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>
into contact with the disagreeable, sour nimba-tree, became sour and
bitter; having said so, he related a tale:

   In (times) past, while Bra<u>h</u>madatta reigned in Báráṇasí, four
brá<u>h</u>maṇa-brothers in the kingdom of Kásí, having devoted
themselves to the life of isis and having built huts at regular
distances in the region of Himavanta, took up their dwelling there.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

   Their eldest brother having died obtained Sakkaship. When he knew
this event then in succession after the lapse of seven or eight days
going to assist them, one day having saluted the eldest ascetic and sat
down apart, he asked: "Lord, what art thou in need of?"

   The ascetic, who was suffering from the jaundice, said: "I am in need
of fire". He gave him a small hatchet.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

   The ascetic said: "who shall take this and bring me fuel?" Then Sakka
thus said to him: "whenever, Lord, thou art in need of fuel, then
striking this hatchet with (thy) hand, thou shalt say: bring me fuel and
make a fire, (and) it will bring fuel and make a fire for thee".

   Having given him the hatchet, he went to the second (ascetic) and
asked: "Lord, what art thou in need of"?--Near his hut there is an
elephant-path. He being molested by the elephants said: "on account of
the elephants annoyance arises to me, drive them away!" Sakka, having
handed him a drum, (said): "Lord, when this end is beaten your enemies
will flee away, (and) when that (end) is beaten they will be
friendly-minded (to you) and surround (you) with a four-fold army;"
(and) so having said and having given (him) the drum,--

   He went to the presence of the youngest and asked: "Lord, what art
thou in need of"? He was also afflicted with the jaundice, therefore he
said: "I am in need of milk". Sakka, having given him a milk-bowl,
(said): "if you, wishing (for anything), overthrow this (bowl), then
having become a great river and pouring out a torrent, it will be able
to take a kingdom and give it to you"; so having said he went away.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

   Thenceforward the hatchet makes a fire for the eldest brother; when
the (one) end of the drum is beaten by the second (brother), the
elephants flee away; (and) the youngest enjoys (his) milk.

   At this time a boar straying in a place where once a town had stood,
saw a set of jewels endowed with supernatural power. He seized those
jewels in (his) mouth and by virtue of them having risen into the air,
went to an islet in the middle of the sea, and thinking: here it is
expedient for me now to live, descended and took up (his) abode in a
convenient spot under an udumbara-tree. One day having placed the jewels
before (him), he fell asleep at the foot of the tree.

   Meanwhile an inhabitant of the Kási-kingdom, expelled from home by
his parents, who said: "this (fellow) is of no service to us", went to a
seaport and embarked in a ship as <span id="page_25">p. 25</span> a
servant to the sailors; when the ship was wrecked, and he had reached
that island (by) lying on a plank, then, while seeking for different
fruits, he observed the boar asleep, went softly up and took the jewels,
and having by virtue of them risen into the air and sat down on the
udumbara-tree he thought: this boar being an air-walker by virtue of the
jewels lives here, I think it is expedient for me first to kill him and
eat (his) flesh and then to go away. Having broken off a small stick (of
the tree), he let it fall down on his head. The boar when aroused, not
seeing the jewels, runs about hither and thither. The man seated on the
tree laughed. The boar having observed him when looking round, striking
(his) head against the tree, there met with (his) death.

   The man having descended, made a fire, cooked his flesh and ate it,
(afterwards) having ascended in the air, going along the summit of
Himavanta he observed a collection of hermitages, and having descended
into the hermitage of the eldest ascetic, living (there) two or three
days he <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> waited on him and (so) saw the
power of the hatchet. Thinking, I must get possession of this, he showed
the ascetic the power of the jewels and said: Lord, take these (jewels)
of mine and give (me) the hatchet (for them)." The ascetic, desirous of
walking in the air, took them and gave the hatchet. When he got it,
after going a little (distance), he striking the hatchet said: "hatchet,
strike off the head of the ascetic and bring me the jewels". The hatchet
having gone and struck off the head of the ascetic, brought (back) the
jewels.

   (Afterwards) having put the hatchet in a secret place, he went to the
middle ascetic's presence, and after living (there) a short time and
seeing the power of the drum, giving the jewels he got possession of the
drum, and having (afterwards), in the same way as before, caused also
his head to be cut off,--

   He went to the youngest (ascetic), where having seen the power of the
milk-bowl he got possession of it by giving the jewels and (then), in
the same way as before, caused his head to be cut off.

   (Now) taking the Jewels, the Hatchet, the Drum and the Milk-bowl he
ascended into the air, and staying not far from Báráṇasí he sent by the
hand of a man a letter to the king of Báráṇasí to this effect: either do
me battle or give up the kingdom. The king having heard (his) bidding,
<span id="page_27">p. 27</span> went out saying: "we will seize the
robber". He beat the one end of the drum (and immediately) a four-fold
army surrounded (him). Having discovered that the king had unfolded (his
troops) he poured out (his) milk-bowl. There arose a great river. The
multitude sinking down in the milk could not escape. Striking the
hatchet he said: bring (me) the king's head, (and) the hatchet went,
brought the (king's) head and threw (it) down at (his) feet. (So quickly
was it done that) not a single one was able to wield (his) weapon.
Having entered the city surrounded by a great force, he caused himself
to be crowned, and reigned (afterwards) with justice as the king called
Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana.

   One day white casting nets and weels in the river for sport, a
celestial amba-fruit coming from the Kaṇṇamuṇḍa-lake, stuck in the net.
Those who cast the net, when they saw it, gave (it) to the king. It was
a large golden ball, of the size of a bowl. The king asked the
foresters: of what (tree) is this the fruit? Having learned that it was
an amba-fruit, he enjoyed (it), planted (its) stone in his garden and
caused it to be watered with milk-water. The tree having sprung up bore
fruit in the third year. Great honor <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> was
paid to the amba-tree. They sprinkle (it) with milk-water, they give
(it) five fingers full of perfume, they surround (it) with garlands,
they light a lamp with perfumed oil. Its covering, furthermore, was of
silk and coarse cloth. (Its) fruits were sweet (and) golden.

   King Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana, sending the amba-fruit to other kings, from
fear that a tree might grow up from the stone, sent (them) after having
(first) pierced with a maṇḍu-thorn the place where the sprout should
spring forth. (And therefore) when, after eating the amba, they planted
the stone, it would not thrive. They asking: what is the reason of it,
learned the cause. Then one of the kings called (his) gardener and asked
(him): "wilt thou he able to destroy the sweetness of (king)
Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana's amba-fruits and make them bitter, and when he
answered: yes Sire! he sent him away, after giving (him) a thousand
(pieces of silver), saying: go then. He went to Báráṇasí and caused it
to be reported to the king: "a gardener has come", and being summoned by
him and having entered and saluted the king, he was asked: art thou a
gardener, and having said: yes Sire! <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> he
enlarged upon his ability. The king said: go and stay with our gardener.
These two persons henceforth tend the garden. The newly arrived
gardener, causing flowers to bloom, and fruits to be gathered, out of
season, made the garden charming. The king being pleased with him,
having discharged the old gardener, gave him (the charge of) the garden.

   He finding the garden in his hands, sowed nimbas and paggavavallis
round the amba-tree. Gradually the nimbas grew up. Their roots and
branches were united and variously connected together. By this union
with what was disagreeable and sour the sweet-fruited amba at last
became bitter, with a taste like (that of) the nimba-leaf. Having
discovered that the amba-fruits had become bitter the gardener ran away.
Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana having gone into the garden, (on) eating an
amba-fruit but not being able to get <span id="page_30">p. 30</span>
down the juice of the amba, which had entered (his) mouth, (because it
was) like that of the dibgusting nimba, hawked and spit.

   At that time Bodhisatta was his admonitor. The king having invited
Bodhisatta, (on) asking him: "O learned (man)! of the usual care
bestowed upon this tree nothing has been omitted; still its fruit has
become bitter, what is the cause (of this)?" he recited the first
stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>1.</td>
<td>"This amba-tree was formerly<br />
endowed with color, smell and flavor,<br />
obtaining such a culture<br />
why has this amba bitter fruit?"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   Then telling (him) the cause of it Bodhisatta recited the second
stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>2.</td>
<td>"Thy amba, O Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana,<br />
is surrounded by nimbas,<br />
the root (of the one) is united with the root (of the other),<br />
the branches (of the one) embrace the branches (of the other):<br />
by reason of (its) connection with the bad (nimbas),<br />
therefore the amba has bitter fruit".</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   The king having heard his words, caused all the nimbas and
paggavavallis to be cut off and (their) roots to be eradicated, <span
id="page_31">p. 31</span> the sour earth entirely to be carried away and
sweet earth to be brought to (it), and the amba to be tended with
milk-water, sugar-water and fragrant water. By the union with sweet
juices it again became sweet.

   The king having handed over the garden to the original gardener, (at
last) having lived to a full age, he passed away (and was rewarded)
according to his deeds.

   The Master having given this moral instruction, summed up the Játaka
thus: "At that time I was the wise counsellor". The
Dadhivá<u>h</u>ana-Birth.
