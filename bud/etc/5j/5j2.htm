<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou didst (what was) right". This the Master related, while living at Jetavana, concerning the priest L&aacute;&#7735;ud&aacute;yi. He, forsooth, was not able, among two or three persons, to succeed in uttering a single word. Being of a very timid mind, when thinking: I will say one thing, he said another. Talking about this disposition of his,

the monks sat down in the Hall of Dhamma. The Master having arrived, asked: what do you now sit here talking about? and when they answered: truly about this, he (said): not (only) now, o monks, L&aacute;&#7735;ud&aacute;yi is of a very timid mind, (but) also formerly (he was) of a very timid mind, (and) thus having said he related a tale:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In (times) past, while Bra<U>h</U>madatta reigned in B&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute;, Bodhisatta, having been born in a br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a-family in the kingdom of K&aacute;s&iacute;, (and) after reaching the age of maturity, having acquired (all sorts of) accomplishments in Takkasil&aacute;, returned to (his) home, and (here) learning his parents' poverty, in order to relieve (his) distressed family, having asked leave of (his) parents, he went to B&aacute;r&aacute;&#7751;as&iacute; and served the king. He became dear (and) pleasing to the king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then (it happened that) while his father got (his) living by ploughing with two oxen, one of them died. He went to Bodhisatta and said: "(my) dear (son), one ox (of mine) is dead, the work of ploughing does not proceed, ask the king for an ox". "(My) dear (father), not long ago the king (was) seen by me, now to ask for oxen (would) not (be) proper, do you ask" "(My) dear (son), you know not my timidity, forsooth I in the presence of two or three am not able to succeed (in my) speech, if I go into the presence of the king to ask for an (other) ox, I shall return after having given (him) the one (remaining)". "(My) dear (father), be it as it may, I cannot ask the king, but on the other hand, I will make you fit (for it)". " Well then, make me fit".</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodhisatta took (his) father, went to a cemetery choked with b&iacute;ra&#7751;a-grass, and having bound here and there (some) bundles of grass, gave them names, saying: this is the king, this the vice-king, (and) this the general, (whereupon) he showed them to (his) father successively, saying: "(my) dear (father), when thou hast gone to the presence of the king and said: (may) the great king be victorious, you shall ask for an ox by reciting this stanza," (and) so he taught him the (following) stanza:</P>

give (me) another, O khattiya!"</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<P>The br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a having for a year made this stanza familiar to himself, he said to Bodhisatta: "(My) dear Somadatta, the stanza is familiar to me, now I am able to recite it in the presence of any one, lead me to the presence of the king."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saying: well, (my) dear (father), and having caused (him) to take (with him) a suitable present, led (his) father to the presence of the king. The br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a having said: (may) the great king be victorious, offered the present. The king said: "Somadatta, what is this br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a to thee?" "(He is) my father, O great king." "For what purpose bas he come?" At this moment the br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a, in order to ask for the ox, reciting the stanza said:</P>

<P>The king understanding that the br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a had repeated (it) wrongly, smiled and said: "Somadatta, in your house I suppose

(there are) many oxen." "Great king, they must have been given by you (then)." The king being pleased with Bodhisatta ('s answer) gave the br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a sixteen oxen, (several) ornamental articles and a village for his clothing, as a br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a-present, and sent him away with great honor. The br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a having mounted a carriage drawn by entirely-white Sindhu-horses, went with a great retinue to the village.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bodhisatta sitting down together with his father in the carriage (said) on the way: "(my) dear (father), for a whole year I made you apt, but at the moment of your being accomplished, you gave the ox to the king," (and) having said so he recited the first stanza:</P>

(but) alteredst the chief word, when thou enteredst the assemblage;<BR>
no training protects the (man) with little brains."</TD></TR>

<P>Whereupon the br&aacute;<U>h</U>ma&#7751;a, having heard his words, recited the second stanza:</P>

runs a double (risk):<BR>

for such is the nature of asking."</TD></TR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master having given this moral instruction, summed up the J&aacute;taka thus: "At that time Somadatta's father was L&aacute;&#7735;ud&aacute;yi, and Somadatta I. The Somadatta-Birth.</P>
