### II, 7, 1. THE SOMADATTA-BIRTH.

   "Thou didst (what was) right". This the Master related, while living
at Jetavana, concerning the priest Láḷudáyi. He, forsooth, was not able,
among two or three persons, to succeed in uttering a single word. Being
of a very timid mind, when thinking: I will say one thing, he said
another. Talking about this disposition of his, <span id="page_32">p.
32</span> the monks sat down in the Hall of Dhamma. The Master having
arrived, asked: what do you now sit here talking about? and when they
answered: truly about this, he (said): not (only) now, o monks, Láḷudáyi
is of a very timid mind, (but) also formerly (he was) of a very timid
mind, (and) thus having said he related a tale:

   In (times) past, while Bra<u>h</u>madatta reigned in Báráṇasí,
Bodhisatta, having been born in a brá<u>h</u>maṇa-family in the kingdom
of Kásí, (and) after reaching the age of maturity, having acquired (all
sorts of) accomplishments in Takkasilá, returned to (his) home, and
(here) learning his parents' poverty, in order to relieve (his)
distressed family, having asked leave of (his) parents, he went to
Báráṇasí and served the king. He became dear (and) pleasing to the king.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

   Then (it happened that) while his father got (his) living by
ploughing with two oxen, one of them died. He went to Bodhisatta and
said: "(my) dear (son), one ox (of mine) is dead, the work of ploughing
does not proceed, ask the king for an ox". "(My) dear (father), not long
ago the king (was) seen by me, now to ask for oxen (would) not (be)
proper, do you ask" "(My) dear (son), you know not my timidity, forsooth
I in the presence of two or three am not able to succeed (in my) speech,
if I go into the presence of the king to ask for an (other) ox, I shall
return after having given (him) the one (remaining)". "(My) dear
(father), be it as it may, I cannot ask the king, but on the other hand,
I will make you fit (for it)". " Well then, make me fit".

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

   Bodhisatta took (his) father, went to a cemetery choked with
bíraṇa-grass, and having bound here and there (some) bundles of grass,
gave them names, saying: this is the king, this the vice-king, (and)
this the general, (whereupon) he showed them to (his) father
successively, saying: "(my) dear (father), when thou hast gone to the
presence of the king and said: (may) the great king be victorious, you
shall ask for an ox by reciting this stanza," (and) so he taught him the
(following) stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"I (used to) have two oxen, O great king,<br />
by means of which we plough the field;<br />
of them one is dead, O Sire,<br />
give (me) another, O khattiya!"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The brá<u>h</u>maṇa having for a year made this stanza familiar to
himself, he said to Bodhisatta: "(My) dear Somadatta, the stanza is
familiar to me, now I am able to recite it in the presence of any one,
lead me to the presence of the king."

   He saying: well, (my) dear (father), and having caused (him) to take
(with him) a suitable present, led (his) father to the presence of the
king. The brá<u>h</u>maṇa having said: (may) the great king be
victorious, offered the present. The king said: "Somadatta, what is this
brá<u>h</u>maṇa to thee?" "(He is) my father, O great king." "For what
purpose bas he come?" At this moment the brá<u>h</u>maṇa, in order to
ask for the ox, reciting the stanza said:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"I (used to) have two oxen, O great king,<br />
by means of which we plough the field;<br />
of them one is dead, O Sire,<br />
take the other, O khattiya!"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The king understanding that the brá<u>h</u>maṇa had repeated (it)
wrongly, smiled and said: "Somadatta, in your house I suppose <span
id="page_35">p. 35</span> (there are) many oxen." "Great king, they must
have been given by you (then)." The king being pleased with Bodhisatta
('s answer) gave the brá<u>h</u>maṇa sixteen oxen, (several) ornamental
articles and a village for his clothing, as a brá<u>h</u>maṇa-present,
and sent him away with great honor. The brá<u>h</u>maṇa having mounted a
carriage drawn by entirely-white Sindhu-horses, went with a great
retinue to the village.

   Bodhisatta sitting down together with his father in the carriage
(said) on the way: "(my) dear (father), for a whole year I made you apt,
but at the moment of your being accomplished, you gave the ox to the
king," (and) having said so he recited the first stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"Steadily attentive, thou didst (what was) right,<br />
for a year in (the cemetery) full of bíraṇa-grass,<br />
(but) alteredst the chief word, when thou enteredst the assemblage;<br />
no training protects the (man) with little brains."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Whereupon the brá<u>h</u>maṇa, having heard his words, recited the
second stanza:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd" data-valign="top">
<td>"He who asks (for anything), dear Somadatta,<br />
runs a double (risk):<br />
(viz.) loss and the acquirement of wealth,<br />
for such is the nature of asking."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   The Master having given this moral instruction, summed up the Játaka
thus: "At that time Somadatta's father was Láḷudáyi, and Somadatta I.
