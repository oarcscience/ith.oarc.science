#### III. WHY CALLED THE TRUE SECT OF PURE LAND?

<span class="smallcaps">By</span> the True Sect of Pure Land is meant
the true teaching in the doctrine of Pure Land, that is to say, the way
of truth that assures one's rebirth in the Pure Land of Amida.

We can imagine the existence of three paths leading to the Pure Land of
Amida, one of which is broad and safe, while the other two are rough and
narrow. This broad and safe one is the true way that assures our rebirth
in Pure Land.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

The Pure Land of Amida is a land of perfect beauty founded upon the
truth of goodness, and not a particle of impurity could be brought in
there. Therefore, however apparently good and praiseworthy in this
world, human morality issuing out of a heart ever full of defilement
cannot be said to be a good which is truly free from every trace of
impurity; and it will be an impossibility to be born in Pure Land
through our human will and moral discipline; nay, if indeed a person
wants to be born there, he must absolutely renounce his self-will.

Through what power shall we be allowed to be born in Pure Land? The
question has been answered in the very beginning of things, for the will
of Amida entertains no doubt as to this point. That pure and beautiful
land of happiness is for us; Amida, wishing to have us join him in Pure
Land, is ever showering his light upon us in order

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

to make us grow in wisdom and to become conscious of our sinfulness and
falsehood, whereby we might come to entertain the desire of being born
in the land of truth and goodness. It is thus entirely due to the
effulgence of Amitābha (the Infinite Light) that we have at all grown
conscious of the darkness existing in our hearts and awakened an
aspiration after a land of eternal light. Amida who has brought up our
minds to this state while we were altogether unaware of his
[existence](errata.htm#12.md), is now beckoning us, saying: "Hear my name
of truth and goodness, awaken your consciousness of the impurity and
falsehood darkening your hearts, and have your destiny absolutely
entrusted into my hands that will save you from sin and ignorance."
Those who listen to this call of Amida, and growing aware of their
sinfulness, surrender themselves to the will of the Buddha, and grasp
his hand of salvation with absolute confidence,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

are embraced in the truth and goodness of his love that saves; and after
death they will no more be the owner of such a defiled mind and body as
they have now, but being born in the land of happiness and purity, will
be given infinite wisdom and love. If it is not for the love of Amida
that wills to save all beings, we shall have no opportunity to be born
in his Land of Purity. Therefore, the true way of being born in the
Buddha-country lies in crossing this sea of suffering on board the boat
of love steered by Amida. This way is called the "Gugwan," by which is
meant the Buddha's will to save all beings.

But there are some who can not resign themselves entirely to the
Buddha's will to save; though approaching the true way, they are not yet
quite ready to surrender themselves to Amida, whose arms are extended
towards them for their salvation, but desire to be born

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

in Pure Land through the merit of reciting his name with singleness of
heart. These people, believing there is no other way of being born in
Pure Land but through the reciting of Amida's name, place too much
emphasis on the reciting itself and have the tendency to repeat the name
of the Buddha as many times as they could. These are the people who want
to be in Pure Land partly through their own efforts. They would be born
on the outskirts of it if their hearts remain serene at the time of
their death. We call, however, this way the "Shimmon," or real gate.

There are still others who can not enter even upon the path of the
so-called "Shimmon"; for they so strongly believe in their own
efficiency that they desire to be born in the Pure Land of Amida through
the accumulation of merits gained by their own moral and religious
deeds. Such people would be

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

born on the outskirts of Pure Land if by the accumulation of merit their
hearts remain undisturbed. This way is known as the "Yōmon," meaning the
gate of importance.

These two gates or ways, the "Shimmon" and the "Yōmon," are not the true
road leading to Pure Land. As there is mixture here of one's own impure
will, one is barred from the Pure Land proper; only by the love of the
Buddha, one is able to approach a region lying on the outskirts. To such
one, the time will come when he will realise his own fault after years
of self-discipline in the outlying district of Pure Land, and then he
will for the first time come to the path of truth. It is, then, evident
that these two gates are merely provisionary, narrow ones furnished for
those who are unable to enter at once upon the path of truth, while the
"Gugwan" way is the only, true, ultimate one directly carrying us to the
abode

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

of Amida.

When a man thus perceives the existence of these three different roads
to Pure Land, he must guard himself against going astray, and follow the
true, straight road of the "Gugwan," The doctrine that teaches this, is
called the True Sect of Pure Land, or briefly the True Sect.
