#### II. SYSTEMATISATION.

<span class="smallcaps">Buddhism</span> is a most complex system of
religion, and its founder, Shākyamuni, taught his followers in various
ways according to their different abilities, characters, and
dispositions; the Buddha opened many a gate of entrance for his
disciples, and of these we now distinguish generally two main entrances
or pathways

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

to salvation. One of them is the way directly leading to the truth of
salvation whereby one can escape from a world of suffering; while the
other is a provisionary way which will prepare one to enter finally upon
the path of truth. It is necessary for students of Buddhism to keep this
distinction in mind. Let us now see what an insight Shinran Shōnin had
into the essential truth of Buddhism, according to what it taught in the
above-mentioned three sūtras and by those seven great predecessors of
his.

Buddhism divides itself into two principal schools, the Lesser and the
Greater Vehicle; the former is for the Shrāvakas and Pratyeka-buddhas,
who are satisfied with a comparatively inferior attainment, while the
Greater Vehicle teaches the way of great enlightenment whereby is made
possible the attainment of Buddhahood. Therefore, the doctrine of the
Greater Vehicle must be regarded as

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

superior to that of the Lesser Vehicle. But in the former we again
distinguish what is called the "Path for the Wise" (*shōdōmon*) from
that of "Pure Land" (*jōdomon*). The "Path for the Wise" is one that
will lead a Buddhist to sagehood while on earth, by uprooting the
passions and disciplining himself in all virtues; whereas the "Path of
Pure Land" teaches us to attain to Buddhahood by being born in the Pure
Land of Amida. The "Path for the Wise" requires one to gain
enlightenment through one's own efforts, and its prescribed discipline
is naturally beset with difficulties. Therefore, it is properly called
the "jiriki-kyō" or the doctrine of self-salvation, by which it is meant
that one can be saved by one's own efforts; or the "nangyō-dō," which is
to say, the way difficult to practise.

The "Path of Pure Land," on the other hand, teaches the possibility of
attaining enlightenment through a power

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

other than oneself; and, therefore, this way must be considered far
easier than the other, and we call it the "tariki-kyō," that is, the
doctrine that teaches salvation by a power other than one's own; it is
also called the "igyō-dō," which means the way easy to practise. It is
evident, then, that if a man is not highly endowed with wisdom and
intelligence, the following of the "Path for the Wise" must be said to
be extremely difficult. For such people as ourselves who were born in
these latter days far from the time of the Buddha, and who are not
endowed with wisdom nor intelligence, the best policy will be to walk
along the "Path of Pure Land," believing in salvation through the grace
of Amida.

The Buddhism of the Greater Vehicle can also be viewed as having two
classes of teaching, the "Gradual" (*zen*) and "Abrupt" (*ton*). The
"Gradual" is the doctrine that teaches the attainment of final
enlightenment after gradually pas-

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

sing through stages of discipline; while, according to the "Abrupt"
teaching, one can reach the goal, as if by a sudden leap, without
successively passing through various stages of ascension.

This distinction of the "Gradual" and the "Abrupt" can also be applied
to the "Path for the Wise" as well as to the "Path of Pure Land." The
"Gradual" teaching in the "Path for the Wise" says that Buddhahood is
attainable by practising the six virtues of perfection (*pāramitas*) for
a period of three asamkhyas and one hundred great kalpas. The "Abrupt"
teaching in the "Path for the Wise," on the contrary, shows no such
patience, for it declares that when a man gets enlightened as to his
spiritual oneness with the Buddha, he is a Buddha. While this latter
teaching of Buddhism points out the direct way of attaining Buddhahood,
the "Gradual" way must be said to be provisional in its relation

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

to the one just mentioned, in as much as its function is to prepare one
for the final and real comprehension of the truth.

Now, the distinction of the "Gradual" and the "Abrupt" in the "Path of
Pure Land" is that, according to the former, one is able to enter into
the Pure Land of Amida only by degrees, and not, as it were, at a
stroke; for a man can only be born on the outskirts of Pure Land if he
wishes to be there by the accumulation of good deeds through his own
efforts, and it is after another accumulation of merits that he can have
his faith firmly established and at last be a resident in the Pure Land
proper: whereas the "Abrupt" doctrine teaches that when a man, having an
immovable faith in the absolute saving power of Amida, completely
resigns himself into the hands of the Buddha, this faith of his at once
determines his destiny to be born in the Pure Land proper, and

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

he is able to have a spiritual insight into the enlightenment of the
Buddha. It is apparent, then, that this latter teaching penetrates more
deeply into the truth of the doctrine of Pure Land than the other one,
which is merely a provisionary or preparatory step leading up to the
ultimate truth.

There are, thus, two classes or grades of teaching in the doctrine for
the Wise as well as in that of Pure Land, provisionary and ultimate. But
the ultimate teaching in the doctrine for the Wise, when compared to the
corresponding grade of teaching in the doctrine of Pure Land, must be
regarded as still belonging to the preparatory grade; for the former is
the path beset with difficulties requiring an extraordinary amount of
discipline to overcome them. The tabular view that follows will make us
understand the foregoing argument more graphically:

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The conclusion of
all this is that the "Abrupt" teaching in the doctrine of Pure Land is
the final path leading to the truth of Buddhahood attainable by all
sentient beings; and this is no more than the teaching of the True Sect
of Pure Land.

These four terms are too technical to be briefly explained here; suffice
it to quote a passage from the *Shinshū-kyōshi* ("Principal teachings of
the True Sect" by K. Ogurusu), relating to the subject. The translation
is by Mr. James Troup of England.

"Again, within the Shōdōmon there are the methods (schools) of
'lengthwise going-out' and 'lengthwise passing-over.' The Hossō and
San-ron Sects belong to the school of 'lengthwise going-out'; the
Ke-gon, Tendai, Shin-gon, and Zen Sects belong to that of the
'lengthwise passing-over.' In the Jōdo-mon there are the methods of
'crosswise going-out,' and 'crosswise passing-over.' Salvation by
various actions constitutes 'crosswise going-out.' This depends on the
power of one's self. Salvation by remembrance of the Name of Buddha
constitutes 'crosswise passing-over.' This depends on the Power of
Another."
