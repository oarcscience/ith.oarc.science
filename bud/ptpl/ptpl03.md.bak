# PRINCIPAL TEACHINGS

# OF THE

# TRUE SECT OF PURE LAND.

### I. HISTORY.

#### I. SHINRAN SHŌNIN.

<span class="smallcaps">During</span> the past thirty centuries that
have elapsed since the death of Shākyamuni, his Good Law has grown into
a huge tree with many outstretching branches; and each of these is now
everywhere endeavoring to propound the Law according to its own way of
interpretation, and also to perpetuate its own religious practice. Among
these branches, the one that most clearly indicates the Blessed One's
way of salvation and that most thoroughly teaches his life of faith is
the True Sect of Pure Land; for surely it is the doctrine of this Sect
that the ultimate signification of the Buddha's will to

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

save is faithfully preserved. While it goes without saying that this
True Sect of Pure Land is the doctrine preached by the World-honored
Shākyamuni Buddha himself, it was not until some seven hundred years
ago, that is, until the founder of the True Sect, Shinran Shōnin, stayed
in the Province of Hidachi to promulgate a new Buddhist teaching, that
this Sect came to be recognised as such, forming an independent
organisation among the Buddhists.

Shinran Shōnin was born on April 1 in the third year of Jōan, 1173 A.D.,
in the village of Hino near Kyōto. His family was of the Fujiwara clan
that occupied at the time the most important position in the empire, and
his noble father, Arinori Hino, held an honorable office at the imperial
court. The Shōnin was the eldest son, and from this fact we can easily
see what an auspicious prospect he had before

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

him; for could not he, as heir to a noble family, occupy a high official
rank, wield his influence as he willed, and indulge in the enjoyment of
a worldly life? But the death of his parents, while he was yet a child,
made him depend upon his uncle, Lord Noritsuna; and this unfortunate
circumstance left a very deep impression on his young mind, which,
naturally sensitive, now brooded over the uncertainty of human life. At
the age of nine, he left home to lead a monkish life at a Buddhist
monastery called Shōren-in at Awada-Guchi, where Jiyen Sōjō, the high
priest, took him as disciple, shaved his head, and gave him the Buddhist
name, Han-yen.

After this, the Shōnin went to the Mount Hiye, and staying at the
Daijō-in which was in the Mudō-ji, pursued his study under various
masters in the deep philosophy of the Tendai Sect, and disciplined
himself according to its religious practices. He also sought to

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

enlarge his knowledge by delving into the doctrines of all the other
Buddhist sects; but he was unable to reach the true way leading to a
release from this world of pain. He went even so far as to invoke the
aid of the gods as well as the Buddhas to make him realise an immovable
state of tranquillity; but all to no purpose.

While thus vainly seeking his way of release, many years passed on; and
he came to be looked up and paid high respect by all his teachers and
friends as one whose deep learning and unimpeachable morality were
incomparable. His priestly rank advanced, and when he was twenty-five
years old, he was made Monzeki (chief priest) of the Shōkō-in. All these
successes, however, were far from satisfying his noble spirit, which was
ever hankering after the truth. His spiritual vexations increased the
more. When will the light come to this poor yet earnest truth-seeker?

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

His twenty-ninth year which he attained in the first year of Kennin
(1201 A.D.), still found him in a state of mental uncertainty.
Determined to arrive at the settlement of all his doubts, he went daily
to the Rokkaku-dō, Kyōto, for one hundred days beginning with Jan. 10 of
that year, and offered his final prayers to Avalokitēçvara Bōdhisattva
(Kwannon Bosatsu) to suffer him to see the light. At last, he had a
vision of the Bosatsu, and through his instruction he went to Yoshimidzu
in order to be taught by Hōnen Shōnin. Now, according to his doctrine,
all sentient beings were sure to be saved and embraced in the light of
Amida <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) and to be born in the Land of
Happiness, eternal and imperishable, if they, however sinful, only
believe in the name of the Buddha, and, forsaking all their petty cares
of the world at present and to come, abandon themselves to his saving
hands

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

so mercifully extended towards all beings, and recite his name with
singleness of heart. It was through listening to this doctrine that our
Shōnin came to remove from his mind every shadow of his spiritual doubt.
Then, for the first time, he came to perceive that Amida was the name of
his true Father, and could not help realising that, during these
twenty-nine years of his existence, his life had ever been actuated by
this Father's will to save, and that this true Father, from the very
beginning of all things, had [been](errata.htm#1.md) unintermittently at
work to save his sinful children through his eternal mercy. The Shōnin
was filled with joy and gratitude unspeakable. To commemorate this
occasion of his spiritual regeneration, he was given by his master a new
Buddhist name, Shakkū. [Abandoning](errata.htm#2.md) his former adherence
to the faith of the Tendai Sect, he now embraced the Pure Land Sect;
that is to say, forsaking the

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

uncertainty of "self-salvation" (*jiriki*, meaning "self-power"), he
became a believer in the efficacy and surety of salvation through a
power other than his own (*tariki*, meaning "other-power").

After this, he resigned his priestly position as Monzeki, and becoming a
mere Buddhist monk in black, he built an humble hut at Okazaki, where he
continued to receive further instructions from Hōnen Shōnin. His faith
grew ever deeper until he thoroughly understood the signification of his
master's doctrine. In October, 1203 A.D., our Shōnin decided to follow
the advice of Hōnen Shōnin to enter upon a conjugal life and to give the
world an example concretely illustrating their faith that the
householder could be saved as much as the celibate monk. He was,
therefore, married to Princess Tamahi, daughter of Prince Kanezane Kujō,
formerly prime minister to the Emperor.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He was thirty-one
years of age while the Princess eighteen. This marriage, in fact, was
undertaken to settle the religious doubt then prevailing as regards the
final redemption of those secular householders, who, living with their
family, have not completely destroyed the root of passion. Prince Kujō
was one of those who were in doubt about this point, and our Shōnin made
the practical demonstration of his belief by marrying one of his
daughters and living the life of a man of the world. In the year
following, a son was born to him, who was named Han-i.

In 1205 A.D., our Shōnin was given by his revered master a copy of his
work entitled, "The Sen-Jyaku Hon-Gwan Nen-Butsu Shū <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)—which we have reason to consider a memorable

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

event in the life of Shinran Shōnin; for it was to a very selected few
that the master was pleased to give his own writing,—only to those
disciples of his who distinguished themselves in learning and virtue.
Our Shōnin assumed yet another name this year in accordance with his
master's wish. The name was Zenshin, meaning "good faith." In this wise,
the relation between the Shōnin and his master grew closer and closer,
every one recognised in him a spirit that harbored a most powerful faith
equal to that of his master.

Fortunately or unfortunately, this fact led to a series of sad events in
1207 in the life of the Founder of the True Sect. The beginning of it
was the conversion of two court ladies into the faith of Pure Land, who
finally entered a nunnery. This greatly offended the feeling of the
court and set it against Hōnen Shōnin and his followers. Taking
advantage

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

of the court's displeasure, those Buddhist monks belonging to the
Kōfuku-ji monastery at Nara, who were for years observing the spread of
the Pure Land Sect with unmitigated jealousy, now maliciously denounced
its chief propagators to the court and asked for an imperial order to
forbid the preaching of the doctrine of the Pure Land Sect. The court at
last lent its ear to this vicious counsel and ordered Hōnen Shōnin to
leave the Capital for Tosa Province. Our founder, too, as the foremost
disciple of the venerable Hōnen, could not escape the misfortune and was
banished to Kokubu in Echigo Province.

Our Shōnin had now to be separated from his revered master as well as
from his beloved family. We can well understand what sorrowful feelings
were then astir in his heart, which, however, was not so darkened as to
be altogether insensible to the other aspect of this

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

sad event. Perceiving the gracious design of the Buddha even in the
midst of the calamity, he thought in this wise: "Echigo, which is so
remotely situated, could perhaps never have chance to listen to the Good
Law of the Buddha if there were not such an opportunity as this. My
banishment serves an excellent purpose of proselytism. If I happen to
find even one soul embracing the same faith as mine in that remote
province, I shall regard it as owing to the wisdom of my venerable
master." Thus thinking, he departed for his [destination](errata.htm#3.md)
with cheerful spirits.

Therefore, all the way along his long journey, our Shōnin made use of
every occasion to give utterance to his faith and to make his people
interested in the Good Law. When finally he reached his place of
banishment in Echigo, he was ever active in his missionary work, going
about in his neighboring villages and exercising his personal influence

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

over the country people. In the meantime, Princess Tamahi, who, being
left behind in the Capital, had spent days and nights in sorrow and
without consolation, made up her mind to share with her husband the
provincial loneliness in the faraway snowy region of Echigo, and let
herself suffer the misery of banishment.

Five years passed, and in November, 1211, the court issued an order to
terminate the banishment of our Shōnin. The message carried by Lord
Norimitsu Okazaki did not arrive at the destination until December of
the same year.

To his receipt of the message, our Shōnin signed himself Gutoku (which
means "simple-hearted bald man"). He inwardly wished, by thus
designating himself, to determine his own status among followers of the
Buddha, which was neither that of a monk nor that of a layman,—his was
indeed a most peculiar one. What other signification

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

he wanted to give to this unique title was that he was one of those
simple-hearted Buddhists who were not wise, nor intelligent, nor
learned. He used to believe himself as an ignorant and sinful soul, as
it implied in the literal sense of the title, Gutoku. This critical
valuation of himself was an aspect of his religious belief. Afterwards,
he had another name given himself, Shinran, by which he is popularly
known now.

When he received the message of release, he wished at once to proceed to
the Capital and see his venerable master; but being prevented by various
circumstances, it was not until January of the following year that he
could start from Kokubu. When he reached Kōdzuke on his way to Kyōto
toward the middle of February, an unexpected news made him plunge into
the deepest sorrow and despair; for it was the news of the death on
January 25 of his revered master, Hōnen Shōnin, whom he

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

wished to see fervently for once before his final passing. His
heart-breaking was so great, indeed, that he threw himself down on the
ground and cried most piteously. He now abandoned his plan to proceed to
the Capital, and making his way for Hidachi Province, he visited several
towns along his route and preached his faith to the people.

Since January, 1217, he settled at Inada of Hidachi Province, and began
writing his "Kyō-Gyō-Shin-Shō" <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) (*The
Teaching, Practice, Faith, and Attainment*), in which are laid down the
fundamental principles of the True Sect of Pure Land. This was his first
literary work, and the greatest, for on this is built the entire
structure of the True Sect. After the passing of his master, there were
many of his disciples, who failed to grasp the spirit of their master
and grossly misrepresented its vital signification. To

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

save the latter from a wreckage, therefore, and to make known the true
purport of the Pure Land Sect (that is, the True Sect of Pure Land) free
from all possible misinterpretations, he wrote this most significant
book. It was completed in the year 1224, when our Shōnin was fifty-two
years of age.

In the year following (1225 A.D.), the Shōnin built a temple at Takada
of Shimodzuke Province. In 1226, the temple received the name, Senju
Amida Ji, by an imperial order. After this, the True Sect of Pure Land
began to draw its circles of propagation wider and wider around these
two centers, Inada and Takada; and many men and women of good family
gathered about him, who led them to the truth of the Buddhist faith. For
twenty years in these localities he had thus been indefatigably engaged
for the cause of the True Sect of Pure Land, when he conceived an idea
to visit the Capital in

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 1232. He was then
sixty years old.

He left his monastery at Takada to the care of his disciple, Shimbutsu;
and accompanied only by two of his disciples, (while his wife remained
alone at Inada,) he started for Kyōto where he had been long absent. In
Kyōto he had no fixed residence, and moved from one place to another,
among which we may mention Gojō-Nishinotōin, Okazaki, Nijō-Tominokōji,
etc. He was never tired of preaching the Good Law of the compassionate
Buddha to whomever that came to him for spiritual guidance and helpful
instructions; and to those who could not pay him a personal visit, he
sent letters dwelling upon the joyful life of a devout Buddhist. Towards
the end of his life the Shōnin wrote various messages for the sake of
uneducated followers of his faith, in which he expounded the essentials
of the True Sect in the plainest possible terms.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

In 1262, he reached the high age of ninety, and began to show symptoms
of an illness on November 23; but he complained of nothing particularly,
except speaking of the deep love of Amida and reciting his name with
profound devotion. On the twenty-seventh, he bid farewell to his
disciples, saying that he would be waiting for them in Pure Land when
the time come for them to join him there. After this, he kept on
reciting the name of Amida. On the following day, according to the
example shown by the Great Muni of the Shākyas at the time of his
Nirvāna, he had his head turned towards the North, facing the West, and
lying on his right-hand side, in a room at the Zembō-in; at noon his
reciting came quietly to an end, showing that he finally returned to the
Land of Light, when it is said that an odor of indescribably sweet
fragrance filled the room and a flash of white light was seen across the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Western sky, as if
unfolding a long piece of immaculate linen.

His remains were cremated on the twenty-ninth at the Yennin-ji, south of
Toribeno, and his ashes were buried at Ōtani, Higashiyama, over which
now stands tombstones.

The Shōnin was apparently a manifestation of Amida-Butsu, he was indeed
a saving light who came among us some seven hundred years ago to dispel
the darkness of this world. His life of ninety years on earth was an
imprint eternally engraved on the hearts of sinners not yet freed from
impurities. He lived among us to typify the life of a sinful soul, who
could yet be saved through his faith in the boundless love of Amida, and
left a unique example for us who are intoxicated with the wine of
passion. So, our Shōnin did not follow the steps of an ancient sage,
who, leaving his home and severing all the family tics, would fly away
from

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

this world, in order to cleanse the heart, to sanctify the conduct, and
to be thoroughly imbued with the purest religious sentiment, and who by
virtue of these unworldly merits was permitted to be born in the country
of the Buddha. The Shōnin, on the contrary, married Princess Tamahi and
lived a family life, even after his confirmation in the Buddhist faith.

Four sons and three daughters were born through this union. The first,
third, fourth, and fifth children were sons who were named respectively,
Han-i, Zenran, Myōshin, and Dōshō; while the second, sixth, and seventh
were daughters, whose names were: Masa-hime, Saga-hime, and Iya-hime.
The Shōnin could not help but deeply love these children, so dear to the
heart of the father that he once confessed with a truly human weakness:
"I am the one who, not knowing how to be blessed by the saving love of
Amida,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

is drowned in the tempest of passion and has lost his way in the
mountains of worldliness." The founder of the True Sect, thus unlike
most religious leaders, was a husband and father, who loved his family
with all his heart and found his salvation in the eternal love of Amida.

It is due to this fact that in the True Sect of Pure Land there is no
distinction made between the monk and the layman as regards their
outward religious practice; while in all the other Buddhist sects the
monk leads a life of celibacy and refrains from eating the animal's
flesh, the followers of the True Sect have no such special order among
them, for their "monks" marry and eat meat. Their religious life,
therefore, consists in continuing to live an ordinary, everyday human
life, not necessarily struggling to free themselves from the so-called
"defilements" of the flesh, and in leaving the grave matter of

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

salvation entirely in the saving hands of Amida; for theirs is only to
be grateful for the Buddha's saving love and to express this gratitude
by the observance of all the moral laws and the efficient execution of
their respective duties. This faith and this way of living were
exemplified by our venerable Shinran Shōnin, the Founder of the True
Sect of Pure Land.

The Shōnin had many devoted disciples, among whom the following were the
most noted: Shōshin, Shimbutsu, Jun-shin, Muyishin, Myōhō, Yuiyen,
Nyūsai, Saibutsu, Kakushin, Ren-yi, etc. There were among these
disciples some who had at first entertained an idea to murder the
master, imagining him to be the enemy of Buddhism; but as soon as they
approached the Shōnin, his personality so powerfully impressed them that
they at once abandoned the evil design and became the most devoted of
his disciples. There were, again,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

others who grew more attached to the master, because he was revealed to
them in a vision as an incarnation of Amida. It is not, therefore,
difficult for one to realise even in these remote days with what
veneration he was regarded by these people; indeed, who could refrain
from revering him as a Buddha? In spite of these facts, the Shōnin
refused to regard these devoted followers of his as disciples, but
considered them as his best friends embracing the same faith, or as his
younger brothers growing under the guidance of the one spiritual father.
He respected and loved every one of them as such, declaring: "I,
Shinran, have no disciples in faith." It is evident then that the master
entertained no thought of styling himself as a religious leader or
teacher, he only regarded himself as a blessed child living in the
all-embracing love of Amida.

In his old age, he wrote many books,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

in which he praised the love and virtue of the Buddha, confessed his
faith, and propounded the principles of the True Sect of Pure Land; and
it is through these writings that we have now access to the inner life
of our Founder. Among chief works of his besides the one already
referred to, "The Kyō-gyō-shin-shō," we mention the following: "The
Gutoku-shō," <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) "The
Jōdo-monrui-jushō," <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) "The
Nyū-shutsu-nimon-ge," <span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) "The
Jōdo-sangyō-wōjō-monrui," <span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#fn_6.md) "The
Wōgen-yekō-monrui," <span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#fn_7.md)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The
Jōdo-wasan," <span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#fn_8.md) "The Kōsō-wasan," <span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#fn_9.md) "The Shōzōmatsu-wasan," <span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#fn_10.md) "The Yui-shin-shō-mon-i," <span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#fn_11.md) "The Songō-shinzō-meimon," <span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#fn_12.md) "The Ichinen-tanen-shōmon," <span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](#fn_13.md) etc.

Besides these, we have two volumes of his letters collected by his
disciples, which are entitled, "The Mattō-shō" <span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#fn_14.md) and "The Go-shōsoku-shū." <span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](#fn_15.md) Still later, Nyoshin Shōnin, grandson of
the master, compiled sayings of the latter

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

under the title, "The Tan-i-shō." <span id="fr_16"></span>[16](#fn_16.md)
By the aid of these books, we are able to look into his faith and
conviction as it was alive in his heart; and our exposition of the
doctrine of the True Sect will be according to these works.
