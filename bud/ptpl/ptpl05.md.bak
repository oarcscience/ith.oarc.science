#### III. THE EASTERN HONGWANJI.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> September, 1594, Kyōnyo Shōnin
resigned his position as "Jūshoku" (residing priest) of the Hongwanji at
Horikawa, Nishi-Rokujō, in favor of his brother, Junnyo, while Kyōnyo
himself made his residence at the new Hongwanji built (1602) at
Karasu-maru, Higashi-Rokujō, the site of which was donated by Tokugawa
Iyeyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa Shōgunate government. Since then,
the Hongwanji at Horikawa was designated the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Western Hongwanji
and the one at Karasu-maru the Eastern Hongwanji. With the co-existence
of these two centers of power, the followers of the True Sect and their
numerous local temples were naturally divided into two groups, alleging
their loyalty to either of their two mother Hongwanjis. Those who went
to the Eastern Hongwanji were called the Eastern Branch, and the other
the Western. Ever since that time, these two branches of the Hongwanji
have kept on their brotherly relations, each endeavoring to contribute
to the prosperity of their common cause. In 1881, the Eastern Branch
came to be known as the Ōtani Branch, while the Western the Hongwanji
Branch.

After the division, those who successively occupied the position of
Jūshoku ("residing priest") or Hosshu ("the chief abbot") at the Eastern
Hongwanji were: Kyōnyo, Sennyo. Takunyo, Jyōnyo, Ichinyo, Shinnyo,
Jyūnyo, Tatsunyo,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gonnyo, and
Gennyo. The present Hosshu is Shōnyo who is called Kōyen.

Since its first establishment in 1602, the Eastern Hongwanji had
suffered no disaster until 1788 when the great fire of Kyōto consumed
the greater parts of the city, and the temple too could not escape its
devastating progress. It was rebuilt in 1798, but in 1823 it was again
destroyed by a fire. The building was restored in 1835, and burned again
in 1858 when Kyōto suffered another great fire. Though a temporary hall
was constructed in 1860, it met the same disaster as before, when a war
broke out within the city in 1864. The present magnificent building was
finished in 1895.

The Eastern Branch, since its early history, has encouraged the study of
its canonical writings and the education of able preachers; and it was
during the Kwambun era (1661-1672) that the Lecture Hall of the
Kwanzeon-ji was

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

removed from Tsukushi, and the first school was established in Shōsei
Garden, better known by the name of Kikoku-tei. In 1754, this school was
[transferred](errata.htm#8.md) to Takakura, Kyōto, and the curriculum was
prepared on an extended scale. This is what is known as the Takakura
College. Among the many noted scholars that were educated at the
College, there were the following: Yekū, Yenen, Yerin, Zuiye, Jinrei,
Senmyō, Ton-ye, Hōkei, Gitō, Hōkai, Daigan, Tokuryū, Reiwō, Reiyō,
Shūzon, Gijyō, Ryūwon, Gidō, Jingō, Giten, Gyōchyū, Sengan, Senryū,
Kakuju, etc.

By these savants, the philosophical foundations of not only the True
Sect but all the other Buddhist sects were minutely investigated. Since
the introduction of Western sciences into the Far East, the College
granted the establishment of a new department where Buddhism as well as
the sciences and

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

philosophies of the East and West will be studied. In 1901, this new
department was [transferred](errata.htm#9.md) to Sugamo, Tōkyō, and another
enlargement and innovation was carried out in order to meet all the
requirements of modern education. It can safely be said that this
College at present offers a most complete course of study for
investigators of Buddhism. After its removal to Tōkyō, the College was
first presided by Kiyozawa Mansi; and Nanjō Bunyū was his successor.

In 1911, this College was again [transferred](errata.htm#10.md) to
Takakura, Kyōto, and the name of Shinshū Daigaku was changed to that of
Shinshū Ōtani Daigaku. It was first presided by Ōtani Yeiryō, younger
brother of the present Hosshu, Shōnyo Shōnin. He was then the chief of
the educational department of the Eastern Hongwanji. During his
presidency, the present new buildings were completed at Oyama, in
Kami-gamo, north of Kyōto. In the last year, Nanjō Bunyū

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

became its president.

Since 1888, the Eastern Hongwanji has been building schools for boys as
well as for girls in various parts of Japan, the largest of which is now
at Imakumano, Kyōto, where are educated 700 boys belonging to the True
Sect. One can judge from this how increasingly influential is growing
the educational activity of the Eastern Hongwanji in these days.

Several monthly periodicals are issued by this branch of the True Sect.
"The Shūhō" is the official organ containing the business reports of the
Sect and the accounts of the missionary activities at home and abroad.
The paper in which are published the results of scholarly investigation
relating to religion and philosophy in general is called "The Mujintō,"
while those periodicals which concern themselves with the practical side
of religion are "The Seishinkai," "The Fukyōkai," "The Kyūdō,"

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The Kwanren,"
"The Futoku," "The Shinfukyō," "The Makoto," "The Dōhō," "The Hōzō,"
"The Hōwa," "The Hikari," "The Shinsekai no Tokufū," etc. Besides these,
there are many important writings yearly coming from the pen of scholars
belonging to the True Sect.

The Eastern Branch of Hongwanji is at present showing the tendency to
become a spiritual center of Japan. The Buddhist families belonging to
this denomination amount to more than several millions, and it has over
fifty Betsuin (or branch temples), some 8160 Matsuji (or local temples),
and several hundreds of lecture halls (or in Japanese *Sekkyōjo*)
distributed all over the country. The managers of these places are
called either "Rimban," or "Jyūshoku," or "Shunin"; and the Jyūshoku of
the local temple, that is, Matsuji, is hereditary as is the master
(*hosshu*) of the mother Hongwanji.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

The followers of this Sect belong either to a branch temple (*betsuin*),
or to a local temple (*matsuji*), or to a lecture hall (*sekkyōjo*); and
they are called its "Danke" (supporters or donors) or "Kōjū" (members or
associates). The relation between the local temple and its supporters is
close and cordial.

Missionaries are regularly despatched from the headquarters, who will
preach on fixed dates at a branch temple, or local temple or lecture
hall. We have at present about 2500 of such travelling preachers. In the
larger towns there are some stationary teachers whose mission is to
visit factories, educational institutions, young men's associations,
etc.; they may also respond to invitations from the
[military](errata.htm#11.md) post stationed there. There are about 120
stationary teachers. We have, further, several tens of the religious
advisers who are sent to teach in the penitentiaries at the request of
the government.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

The Eastern Hongwanji also spends much for philanthropy. One of its
successful works attracting much public attention is the establishment
of a free lodging station for the poor, in Tōkyō.

The building of a branch temple (*betsuin*) at Shanghai in 1876 marked
the beginning of the foreign missionary work by the Eastern Hongwanji.
Since then, the missionaries have been sent to several places in China,
Korea, and other lands. These foreign missionaries are called Kaikyōshi,
meaning carriers of the Good Law throughout the world in order to bring
our brethren to enlightenment.
