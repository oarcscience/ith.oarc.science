REGARDING OUR FAITH:

Concerning studying, what Bodhisattvas throughout the Three
Different Times have studied together is This particular mind.

Concerning recollection, what all Buddhas throughout the Three
Different Times have recollected Is This particular mind.

Concerning disclosure, what every single Sutra from Tripitaka
has thus far disclosed is This particular mind.

Concerning confusion, what each and every ordinary being has
confused is nothing but This particular mind.

Concerning realization, what all practitioners of Tao realize is
This particular mind.

Concerning transmission, what all Patriarchs have transmitted
one to another is This particular mind.

Concerning meditation, what all the humble students throughout
the world have sought through introspective meditation is
nothing but This particular mind.

If anyone masters This particular mind, every day matters will
be set right and everything will be completely clear.  If This
particular mind is confused, everything, everywhere will be
topsy-turvy and each and every thought will be insane.  This
particular essence abides in every ordinary being.  This is our
original nature of Buddhahood; It is the original spring from
which everything in the world flows.
