NOTES: A Feb 1980 poem by Bill La FLEUR,of the Zen Center of Los Angeles

a flow of chamagne
and of monks moving through
the crowd with bowls
and silverware: a pile
of shoes at the treshold
as the people inside get
more dense, more linquid,
more ready to dance;
the tall bride's family members
wera flowers and shoes
and happily 
stand out even here where
in all ten directions there
is nothing
but crowd
