The Japanese Music Institute of America is a non-profit educational
organization dedicated to fostering the growth and study of traditional
Japanese music.  The institute provides quality music programs,
specifically in the areas of Shakuhachi and traditional Japanese
ensemble training.  All programs are funded through student fees and
donations.
 
JMI is directed by Masayuki Koga, one of Japan's finest Shakuhachi
masters.  Koga-sensei received his master-teacher degree from the Tozan
Shakuhachi Flute School in 1964.  He has recorded several albums for
Columbia records.

"There is no secret to excel in playing the shakuhachi.
 Blow not intensely, but from your heart.
 Although technique is secondary, it helps to express your true self.
 If we are natural, we make fine sound.
 If we have an open mind, our sound will be mellow.
 If we have right attitudes toward life,
 our music will be acceptable to everyone.
 Take care of your sound as you would care for yourself." -- Koga
