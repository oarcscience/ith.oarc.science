Gently blows the darkness
linking lake moon and sun
one into the other

The pathway grows silvered
with our effort
grass subdued petal scattered
with each pass of our unsteady feet

It does not seem like enligtenment
to burden this clear day of autumn
with the activity 
of our sitting

How brifgtly glimers that moon
caught in the evening cup
of our steadied hands !
