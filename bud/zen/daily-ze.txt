The Zen Buddhist texts listed below  have been translated from Japanese and rendered into
 a thoughtful English by the Diamond Sangha members, Honolulu, Hawaii headed by Robert 
Aitken Roshi. Although the basic work was done in the 1970s and the 1980s translations
 of some of the texts are not final as they tend to continue to be improved on and refined. 
These texts are used with gratitude and delight by members of several affiliated Zen
 centers and communities, including California Diamond Sangha, Santa Rosa and Berkeley,
 USA (headed by John Tarrant Roshi);  Sydney Zen Center, Australia, and the Zen Group 
of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.

[The final authoritative version of the sutras - as translated in Dec 1991 by Robert Aitken 
Roshi can be now found in the document called: diamond-sangha-zen-sutras.txt available

THE GREAT PRAJNA PARAMITA HEART SUTRA

Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, practising deep Prajna Paramita,
clearly saw that all five skandhas are empty,
transforming all suffering and distress.
Shariputra, form is no other than emptiness,
emptiness no other than form;
form is exactly emptiness, emptiness exactly form;
sensation, perception, mental reaction, consciousness are also like this.
Shariputra, all things are essentially empty--
not born, not destroyed;
not stained, not pure; without loss, without gain.
Therefore in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, perception,
	mental reaction, consciousness;
no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind,
no colour, sound, smell, taste, touch, object of thought;
no seeing and so on to no thinking;
no ignorance and also no ending of ignorance,
and so on to no old age and death
and also no ending of old age and death;
no suffering, cause of suffering, cessation, path;
no wisdom and no attainment. Since there is nothing to attain,
the Bodhisattva lives by Prajna Paramita,
with no hindrance in the mind; no hindrance and therefore no fear;
far beyond delusive thinking right here is Nirvana.
All Buddhas of past, present, and future live by Prajna Paramita,
attaining Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.
Therefore know that Prajna Paramita is
the great mantra, the vivid mantra,
the unsurpassed mantra, the supreme mantra,
which completely removes all suffering.
This is truth, not mere formality.
Therefore set forth the Prajna Paramita mantra,
set forth this mantra and proclaim:
Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate
Bodhi Swaha!

DEDICATION OF SUTRAS AT THE END OF SESSHIN

In the purity and clarity of the Dharmakaya,
in the fullness and perfection of the Sambogakaya,
in the infinite variety of the Nirmanakaya,
we dedicate the virtues of our sesshin and our reciting of "Maka Hannya
Haramita Shingyo"
to the Ancient Seven Buddhas, Dai Osho,
Shakyamuni Buddha, Dai Osho,

and for the enlightenment of bushes and grasses and all the many beings

in grateful thanks to all our many guides along the ancient way,
*All Buddhas throughout space and time,
all Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas,
the Great Prajnaparamita.

The incomparable Buddha-power that banishes suffering.
Om! The Buddha of reality, wisdom, Nirvana!

With no categories, this mysterious power
Saves all beings; suffering goes, happiness comes, Swaha!

HAKUIN ZENJI: SONG OF ZAZEN

All beings by nature are Buddha,
As ice by nature is water.
Apart from water there is no ice;
Apart from beings, no Buddha.

How sad that people ignore the near
And search for truth afar:
Like someone in the midst of water
Crying out in thirst;
Like a child of a wealthy home
Wandering among the poor.

Lost on dark paths of ignorance,
We wander through the Six Worlds;
From dark path to dark path--
When shall we be freed from birth and death?

Oh, the zazen of the Mahayana!
To this the highest praise!
Devotion, repentance, training,
The many paramitas--
All have their source in zazen.

Those who try zazen even once
Wipe away beginningless crimes.
Where are all the dark paths then?
Tbe Pure Land itself is near.

Those who hear this truth even once
And listen with a grateful heart,
Treasuring it, revering it,
Gain blessings without end.

Much more, those who turn about
And bear witness to self-nature,
Self-nature that is no-nature,
Go far beyond mere doctrine.

Here effect and cause are the same;
The Way is neither two nor three.
With form that is no-form,
Going and coming, we are never astray;
With thought that is no-thought,
Singing and dancing are the voice of the Law.

Boundless and free is the sky of Samadhi!
Bright the full moon of wisdom!
Truly, is anything missing now?
Nirvana is right here, before our eyes;
This very place is the Lotus Land;
This very body, the Buddha

=============================================================

AT THE END OF THE EVENING DURING SESSHIN

The sky of samadhi and the moonlight of wisdom are the temple of our
	practice;
our friends and family members guide us as we walk the ancient path;
we dedicate the virtues of reciting Hakuin Zenji's "Song of Zazen" to:
	Rinzai Gigen, Dai Osho,
	Hakuin Ekaku, Dai Osho,
and to the guardians of the Dharma and the protectors of our sacred hall,
*All Buddhas throughout space and time,
all Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas,
the great Prajnaparamita.

=============================================================

TOREI ZENJI: BODHISATTVA'S VOW

When I (a student of the Dharma) look at the real form of the universe,
all is the never-failing manifestation of the mysterious truth of Tathagata.
In any event, in any moment, and in any place,
none can be other than the marvellous revelation of its glorious light.

This realization made our founding teachers and 
					virtuous Zen leaders extend tender care,
with the heart of worshipping,
to animals and birds, and indeed to all beings.
This realization teaches us that our daily food, drink, clothes, and protections of life
are the warm flesh and blood, the merciful incarnation of Buddha
Who can be ungrateful or not respectful to each and every thing, as well as to human
	beings!

Even though someone may be a fool,
be warm and compassionate.
If by any chance such a person should turn against us,
become a sworn enemy and abuse and persecute us,
we should sincerely bow down with humble language, 
					in reverent belief that he or she is
	the merciful avatar of Buddha,
who uses devices to emancipate us from sinful karma
that has been produced and accumulated upon ourselves
by our own egoistic delusion and attachment
through countless cycles of kalpas.

Then on each moment's flash of our thought there will grow a lotus flower,
and on each lotus flower will be revealed a Buddha.
These Buddhas will glorify Sukhavati, the Pure Land, every moment and everywhere.

May we extend this mind over all beings
so that we and the world together
may attain maturity in Buddha's wisdom.

Kanzeon:
Veneration to the Buddha.
With Buddha I have origin;
With Buddha I have affinity;
Affinity with Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha;
Eternity, joy, self, and purity.
Mornings my thoughts are Kanzeon;
Evenings my thoughts are Kanzeon;
Thought after thought arise in the mind;
Thought after thought are not separate from mind.

=============================================================

AT THE BEGINNING OF EVENING MEETINGS

Infinite realms of light and dark convey the Buddha-Mind;
birds and trees and stars and we ourselves come forth in perfect
	harmony;
we recite our gatha and our sutra for the many beings of the world;
in grateful thanks to all our many guides along the ancient way,
*All Buddhas throughout space and time,
all Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas,
the great Prajnaparamita.

=============================================================

SECOND SUTRA SERVICE DEDICATION

The Buddha and his teachers and his many sons and daughters
turn the Dhamma wheel to show the wisdom of the stones and clouds;
we dedicate the virtues of reciting Torei Zenji's "Bodhisattva's Vow" and
the "Enmei Jikku Kannon Gyo" to:
	Choro Nyogen, Dai Osho,
	Hannya Gempo, Dai Osho,
	Mitta Soen, Dai Osho,
and to our relatives and companions of the past who rest in deepest
	samadhi,
*All Buddhas throughout space and time,
all Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas,
the great Prajnaparamita.

=============================================================

SHIGU SEIGAN MON

SHU JO MU HEN SEI GAN DO
BONNO MU JIN SEI GAN DAN
HO MON MU RYO SEI GAN GAKU
BUTSO DO MU JO SEI GAN JO

GREAT VOWS FOR ALL

Though the many beings are numberless,
I vow to save them.

Though greed, hatred, and ignorance rise endlessly,
I vow to cut them off.

Though the Dharma is vast and fathomless,
I vow to understand it.

Though Buddha's Way is beyond attaimnent,
I vow to embody it fully.

=============================================================

ON OPENING THE DHARMA

The Dharma, incomparably profound and minutely subtle,
Is rarely encountered, even in hundreds of thousands of millions
	of kalpas;
We now can see it, listen to it, accept and hold it:
May we completely realize the true meaning of the Tathagata.
