  HOW TO PRACTICE 

"One way of meditation practice is consistently cutting off random,
irrelevant thoughts, thereby protecting yourself from delusions.  As
soon as one thought arises you must destroy it immediately by being
attentively alert.  After random, irrelevant thought has been alertly
destroyed, subsequent associations will not arise.  Do not even utilize
the insights gained by this alertness, because being unconcerned with
both random, irrelevant thought and attentive alertness is called
No-Mind."

Practice resting your thought internally.
Practice being composed, unaffected by external phenomena.

Practice being cool and chilly. 
Practice letting each moment become ton thousand years. 
Practice becoming like cold ashes and a lofty dead tree. 
Practice being like the incense holder in an ancient temple. 
Practice being like a white silk thread hanging from on high.
