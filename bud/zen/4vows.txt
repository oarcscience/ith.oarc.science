FOUR GREAT VOWS

Ordinary-beings are innumerable I vow to liberate them all

Defilements are endless I vow to eliminate them all

Buddha's teachings are unlimited I vow to learn them all

The ways of enlightenment are supreme

I vow to achieve them all

I vow to liberate all ordinary-beings from my mind

I vow to eliminate all defilements from my mind

I vow to embrace every teaching of my self-nature

I vow to achieve the way of enlightenment from my self-nature
