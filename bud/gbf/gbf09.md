### BUDDHIST ALLUSIONS IN JAPANESE FOLK-SONG

   PERHAPS only a Japanese representative of the older culture could
fully inform us to what degree the mental soil of the race has been
saturated and fertilized by Buddhist idealism. At all events, no
European could do so; for to understand the whole relation of
Far-Eastern religion to Far-Eastern life would require, not only such
scholarship, but also such experience as no European could gain in a
lifetime. Yet for even the Western stranger there are everywhere signs
of what Buddhism has been to Japan in the past. All the arts and most of
the industries repeat Buddhist legends to the eye trained in symbolism;
and there is scarcely an object of handiwork possessing any beauty or
significance of form—from the plaything of a child to the heirloom of a
prince—which does not in some

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

way proclaim the ancient debt to Buddhism of the craft that made it. One
may discern Buddhist thoughts in the cheap cotton prints from an Ôsaka
mill not less than in the figured silks of Kyôto. The reliefs upon an
iron kettle, or the elephant-heads of bronze making the handles of a
shopkeeper's *hibachi*;—the patterns of screen-paper, or the commonest
ornamental woodwork of a gateway;—the etchings upon a metal pipe, or the
enameling upon a costly vase,—may all relate, with equal eloquence, the
traditions of faith. There are reflections or echoes of Buddhist
teaching in the composition of a garden;—in the countless ideographs of
the long vistas of shop-signs;—in the wonderfully expressive names given
to certain fruits and flowers;—in the appellations of mountains, capes,
waterfalls, villages,—even of modern railway stations. And the new
civilization would not yet seem to have much affected the influence thus
manifested. Trains and steamers now yearly carry to famous shrines more
pilgrims than visited them ever before in a twelvemonth;—the temple
bells still, in despite of clocks and watches, mark

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

the passing of time for the millions;—the speech of the people is still
poetized with Buddhist utterances;—literature and drama still teem with
Buddhist expressions;—and the most ordinary voices of the street-songs
of children playing, a chorus of laborers at their toil, even cries of
itinerant street-venders—often recall to me some story of saints and
Bodhisattvas, or the text of some sutra.

   Such an experience first gave me the idea of making a collection of
songs containing Buddhist expressions or allusions. But in view of the
extent of the subject I could not at once decide where to begin. A
bewildering variety of Japanese songs—a variety of which the mere
nomenclature would occupy pages—offers material of this description.
Among noteworthy kinds may be mentioned the *Utai*, dramatic songs,
mostly composed by high priests, of which probably no ten lines are
without some allusion to Buddhism;—the *Naga-uta*, songs often of
extraordinary length;—and the *Jôruri*, whole romances in verse, with
which professional singers can delight their audiences for five or six
hours at a time. The mere dimension of such compositions

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

necessarily excluded them from my plan; but there remained a legion of
briefer forms to choose among. I resolved at last to limit my
undertaking mainly to *dodoitsu*,—little songs of twenty-six syllables
only, arranged in four lines (7, 7, 7, 5). They are more regular in
construction than the street-songs treated of in a former paper; but
they are essentially popular, and therefore more widely representative
of Buddhist influences than many superior kinds of composition could be.
Out of a very large number collected for me, I have selected between
forty and fifty as typical of the class.

 

   Perhaps those pieces which reflect the ideas of preëxistence and of
future rebirths will prove especially interesting to the Western
reader,—much less because of poetical worth than because of comparative
novelty. We have very little English verse of any class containing
fancies of this kind; but they swarm in Japanese poetry oven as
commonplaces and conventionalisms. Such an exquisite thing as Rossetti's
"Sudden Light,"—bewitching us chiefly through the penetrative subtlety
of a

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

thought anathematized by all our orthodoxies for eighteen hundred
years,—could interest a Japanese only as the exceptional rendering, by
an Occidental, of fancies and feelings familiar to the most ignorant
peasant. Certainly no one will be able to find in these Japanese
verses—or, rather, in my own wretchedly prosy translations of them—even
a hint of anything like the ghostly delicacy of Rossetti's imagining:—

    I have been here before,—  
        But when or how I cannot tell:  
    I know the grass beyond the door,  
        The sweet, keen smell,  
The sighing sound, the lights along the shore.

    You have been mine before,—  
        How long ago I may not know:  
    But just when at that swallow's soar  
        Your neck turned so,  
Some veil did fall,—I knew it all of yore.

Yet what a queer *living* difference between such enigmatically delicate
handling of thoughts classed as forbidden fruit in the Western Eden of
Dreams and the every-day Japanese utterances that spring directly out of
ancient Eastern faith!—

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

*Love, it is often said, has nothing to do with reason.  
The cause of ours must be some* En *in a previous
birth*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*Even the knot of the rope tying our boats together  
Knotted was long ago by some love in a former birth*.

*If the touching even of sleeves be through* En *of a former
existence,  
Very much deeper must be the* En *that unites us now!*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

Kwahô\[3\] *this life must be,—this dwelling with one so tender;—  
I am reaping now the reward of deeds in a former birth!*

\[1.

Iro wa shian no  
Hoka to-wa iédo,  
Koré mo saki-sho no  
        En de arô.

"En" is a Buddhist word signifying affinity,—relation of cause and
effect from life to life.

2\.

Sodé suri-ô no mo  
Tashô no en yo,  
Mashité futari ga  
        Fukai naka.

Allusion is here made to the old Buddhist proverb: *Sodé no furi-awasé
mo tashô no en*,—"Even the touching of sleeves in passing is caused by
some affinity operating from former lives."

3\. The Buddhist word "Kwahô" is commonly used instead of other synonyms
for Karma (such as ingwa, innen, etc.), to signify the good, rather than
the bad results of action in previous lives. But it is sometimes used in
both meanings. Here there seems to be an allusion to the proverbial
expression, *Kwahô no yoi hito* (lit.: a person of good Kwahô), meaning
it fortunate individual.\]

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

   Many songs of this class refer to the customary vow which lovers make
to belong to each other for more lives than one,—a vow perhaps
originally inspired by the Buddhist aphorism,—

*Oya-ko wa, is-sé;  
Fûfu wa, ni-sé;  
Shujû wa, san-zé.*

The relation of parent and child is for one life; that of wife and
husband, for two lives; that of master and servant, for three lives."
Although the tender relation is thus limited to the time of two lives,
the vow—(as Japanese dramas testify, and as the letters of those who
kill themselves for love bear witness)—is often passionately made for
seven. The following selections show a considerable variety of
tone,—ranging from the pathetic to the satirical,—in the treatment of
this topic:

*I have cut my hair for his sake; but the deeper relation between us  
Cannot be cut in this, nor yet in another life.*

\[1.

Kami wa kitté mo  
Ni-sé madé kaketa  
Fukai enishi wa  
       Kiru mono ka?

    Literally: "Hair have-cut although, two existences until, <span
id="page_192">p. 192</span> deep relation, cut-how-can-it-be?" By the
mention of the hair-cutting we know the speaker is a woman. Her husband,
or possibly betrothed lover, is dead; and, according to the Buddhist
custom, she signifies her desire to remain faithful to his memory by the
sacrifice of her hair. For detailed information on this subject see, in
my Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan, the chapter, "Of Women's Hair."\]

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

*She looks at the portrait of him to whom for two lives she is
promised:  
Happy remembrances come, and each brings a smile to her
face.<sup>\[1\]</sup>*

*If in this present life we never can hope for union,  
Then we shall first keep house in the Lotos-Palace
beyond.<sup>\[2\]</sup>*

*Have we not spoken the vow that binds for a double existence?  
If we must separate now, I can only wish to die.*

\[1.

Ni-sé to chigirishi  
Shashin wo nagamé  
Omoi-idashité  
       Warai-gao.

Lit.: "Two existences that made alliance, photograph look-at, thinking
bring-out smiling face." The use of the term *shashin*, photograph,
shows that the poem is not old.

2\.

Totémo kono yo dé  
Sowaré-nu naraba  
Hasu no uténa dé  
       Ara sétai.

Lit.: "By-any-means, this-world-in, cannot-live-together if, Lotos-of
Palace-in, new-housekeeping." It is with this thought that lovers
voluntarily die together; and the song might be called a song of
*jôshi*.\]

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

*There!—oh, what shall we do? . . . Pledged for a double existence,  
And now, as we sit together, the string of the* samisen
*snaps!*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*He woos by teaching the Law of Cause and Effect for three lives,  
And makes a contract for two—the crafty-smiling priest!*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

   Every mortal has lived and is destined to live countless lives; yet
the happy moments of any single existence are not therefore less
precious in themselves:—

*Not to have met one night is verily cause for sorrow;  
Since twice in a single birth the same night never comes.*

But even as a summer unusually warm is apt to herald a winter of
exceptional severity, so too much happiness in this life may signify
great suffering in the next:—

*Always I suffer thus! . . . Methinks, in my last existence,  
Too happy I must have been,—did not suffer enough.*

   Next in point of exotic interest to the songs expressing belief in
preëxistence and rebirth, I think I should place those treating of the

\[1. Among singing-girls it is believed that the snapping of a
samisen-string under such circumstances as those indicated in the above
song is an omen of coming separation.

2 This song is of a priest who breaks the vow of celibacy.\]

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

doctrine of *ingwa*, or Karma. I offer some free translations from
these, together with one selection from a class of compositions more
elaborate and usually much longer than the *dodoitsu*, called *hauta*.
In the original, at least, my selection from the *hauta*—which contains
a charming simile about the firefly—is by far the prettiest:—

*Weep not!—turn to me! . . . Nay, all my suspicions vanish!  
Forgive me those words unkind: some* ingwa *controlled my tongue!*

Evidently this is the remorseful pleading of a jealous lover. The next
might be the answer of the girl whose tears he had caused to flow:

*I cannot imagine at all by what strange manner of* ingwa*  
Came I to fall in love with one so unkind as you!*

Or she might exclaim:—

*Is this the turning of* En*?—am I caught in the Wheel of Karma?  
That, alas! is a wheel not to be moved from the rut!*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

\[1.

Meguru en kaya?  
Kuruma no watashi  
Hiku ni hikarénu  
    Kono ingwa.

   There is a play on words in the original which I have not attempted
to render. The idea is of an unhappy match—<span id="page_195">p.
195</span> either betrothal or marriage—from which the woman wishes to
withdraw when too late.\]

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

A more remarkable reference to the Wheel of Karma is the following:—

*Father and mother forbade, and so I gave up my lover;—  
Yet still, with the whirl of the Wheel, the thought of him comes and
goes*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

This is a *hauta*:—

*Numberless insects there are that call from dawn to evening,  
Crying, "I love! I love!"—but the Firefly's silent passion,  
Making its body burn, is deeper than all their longing.  
Even such is my love . . . yet I cannot think through what ingwa  
I opened my heart—alas!—to a being not sincere!*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

\[1.

Oya no iken dé  
Akirameta no wo  
Mata mo rin-yé dé  
         Omoi-dasu.

The Buddhist word *Rin-yé*, or *Rinten*, has the meaning of "turning the
Wheel,"—another expression for passing from birth to birth. The Wheel
here is the great Circle of Illusion,—the whirl of Karma.

2\.

Kaäi, kaäi to  
Naku mushi yori mo,  
Nakanu hotaru ga  
Mi wo kogasu.  
Nanno ingwa dé  
Jitsu naki hito ni  
Shin wo akashité,—  
      Aa kuyashi!

Lit.. "'I-love-I-love'-saying-cry-insects than, better <span
id="page_196">p. 196</span> never-cry-firefly, body scorch! What Karma
because-of, sincerity-not-is-man to, inmost-mind opened?—ah! regret!, .
. . It was formerly believed that the firefly's light really burned its
own body.\]

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

   If the foregoing seem productions possible only to our psychological
antipodes, it is quite otherwise with a group of folk-songs reflecting
the doctrine of Impermanency. Concerning the instability of all material
things, and the hollowness of all earthly pleasures, Christian and
Buddhist thought are very much in accord. The great difference between
them appears only when we compare their teaching as to things
ghostly,—and especially as to the nature of the Ego. But the Oriental
doctrine that the Ego itself is an impermanent compound, and that the
Self is not the true Consciousness, rarely finds expression in these
popular songs. For the common people the Self exists: it is a real
(though multiple) personality that passes from birth to birth. Only the
educated Buddhist comprehends the deeper teaching that what we imagine
to be Self is wholly illusion,—a darkening veil woven by Karma; and that
there is no Self but the Infinite Self, the eternal Absolute.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

In the following *dodoitsu* will be found mostly thoughts or emotions
according with universal experience:—

*Gathering clouds to the moon;—storm and rain to the flowers:  
Somehow this world of woe never is just as we like*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*Almost as soon as they bloom, the scented flowers of the plum-tree  
By the wind of this world of change are scattered and blown away*.

*Thinking to-morrow remains, thou heart's frail flower-of-cherry?  
How knowest whether this night the tempest will not
come?*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

\[1.

Tsuki ni murakumo,  
Hana ni wa arashi:  
Tokaku uki-yo wa  
      Mama naranu.

   This song especially refers to unhappy love, and contains the
substance of two Buddhist proverbs: *Tsuki ni murakumo, hana ni kazé*
(cloud-masses to the moon; wind to flowers); and *Mama ni naranu wa
uki-yo no narai* (to be disappointed is the rule in this miserable
world). "Uki-yo" (this fleeting or unhappy world) is one of the
commonest Buddhist terms in use.

2\.

    Asu ari to  
Omô kokoro no  
    Ada-zakura:  
Yo wa ni arashi no  
Fukanu monokawa?

Lit.: "To-morrow-is that think heart-of perishable-cherry flower:
this-night-in-storm blow-not, is-it-certain?"\]

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

*Shadow and shape alike melt and flow back to nothing:  
He who knows this truth is the Daruma of snow*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*As the moon of the fifteenth night, the heart till the age fifteen:  
Then the brightness wanes, and the darkness comes with
love*.<sup>\[2\]</sup>

*All things change, we are told, in this world of change and sorrow;  
But love's way never changes of promising never to
change*.<sup>\[3\]</sup>

\[1.

Kagé mo katachi mo  
Kiyuréba moto no  
Midzu to satoru zo  
        Yuki-Daruma.

   Lit.: "Shadow and shape also, if-melt-away, original-water
is,-that-understands Snow-Daruma." Daruma (Dharma), the twenty-eighth
patriarch of the Zen sect, is said to have lost his legs through
remaining long in the posture of meditation; and many legless
toy-figures, which are so balanced that they will always assume an
upright position however often placed upside-down, are called by his
name. The snow-men made by Japanese children have the same traditional
form.—The Japanese friend who helped me to translate these verses, tells
me that a ghostly meaning attaches to the word "Kagé" \[shadow\] in the
above;—this would give a much more profound signification to the whole
verse.

2 According to the old calendar, there was always a full moon on the
fifteenth of the month. The Buddhist allusion in the verse is to
*mayoi*, the illusion of passion, which is compared to a darkness
concealing the Right Way.

3\.

Kawaru uki-yo ni  
Kawaranu mono wa <span id="page_199">p. 199</span>  
Kawarumai to no  
         Koi no michi.

Lit.: "Change changeable-world-in, does-not-change that-which,
'We-will-never-change'-saying of Love-of Way."\]

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

*Cruel the beautiful fish,—utterly heartless that lightning!  
Before one can look even twice it vanishes wholly away!*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*His very sweetness itself makes my existence a burden!  
Truly this world of change is a world of constant woe!*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

*Neither for youth nor age is fixed the life of the body;—  
Bidding me wait for a time is the word that forever
divides*.<sup>\[3\]</sup>

\[1.

Honni tsurénai  
Ano inadzuma wa  
Futa mé minu uchi  
        Kiyété yuku.

The Buddhist saying, *Inadzuma no hikari, ishi no hi* (lightning-flash
and flint-spark),—symbolizing the temporary nature of all pleasures,—is
here playfully referred to. The song complains of a too brief meeting
with sweetheart or lover.

2\. Words of a loving but jealous woman, thus interpreted by my Japanese
friend: "The more kind he is, the more his kindness overwhelms me with
anxiety lest he be equally tender to other girls who may also fall in
love with him."

3\.

Rô-shô fujô no  
Mi dé ari nagara,  
Jisetsu maté to wa  
       Kiré-kotoba.

Lit. Old-young not-fixed-of body being, time-wait to-say, cutting-word."
"Ros-hô fujô" is a Buddhist phrase. The meaning of the song is: "Since
all things in this <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> world are
uncertain, asking me to wait for our marriage-day means that you do not
really love me;—for either of us might die before the time you speak
of."\]

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

*Only too well I know that to meet will cause more
weeping;*<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
*Yet never to meet at all were sorrow too great to bear*.

*Too joyful in union to think, we forget that the smiles of the
evening  
Sometimes themselves become the sources of morning-tears*.

Yet, notwithstanding the doctrine of impermanency, we are told in
another *dodoitsu* that—

*He who was never bewitched by the charming smile of a woman,  
A wooden Buddha is he—a Buddha of bronze or stone!*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

And why a Buddha of wood, or bronze, or stone? Because the living Buddha
was not

\[1. Allusion is made to the Buddhist text, *Shôja hitsu metsu, esha jô
ri* ("Whosoever is born must die, and all who meet must as surely
part"), and to the religious phrase, *Ai betsu ri ku* ("Sorrow of
parting and pain of separation").

2\. Much more amusing in the original:—

Adana é-gao ni  
Mayowanu mono wa  
Ki-Butsu,—kana-Butsu,—  
         Ishi-botoké!

   "Charming-smile-by bewildered-not, he-as-for, wood-Buddha,
metal-Buddha, stone-Buddha!" The term "Ishi-botoké" especially refers to
the stone images of the Buddha <span id="page_201">p. 201</span> placed
in cemeteries.—This song is sung in every part of Japan; I have heard it
many times in different places.\]

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

so insensible, as we are assured, with jocose irreverence, in the
following:—

*"Forsake this fitful world"!—  
          that was or teaching teaching!  
And Ragora*,<sup>\[1\]</sup> *son of his loins?—was he forgotten
indeed?*

There is an untranslatable pun in the original, which, if written in
Romaji, would run thus

Uki-yo wo sutéyo t'a  
So yo:  
Ragora to iû ko wo  
        Wasurété ka?

*Shakamuni* is the Japanese rendering of "Sakyamuni;" "Shaka Sama" is
therefore "Lord Sakya," or "Lord Buddha." But *saka-sama* is a Japanese
word meaning "topsy-turvy," "upside down;" and the difference between
the pronunciation of Shaka Sama and *saka-sama* is slight enough to have
suggested the pun. Love in suspense is not usually inclined to
reverence.

\[1. *Râhula*.\]

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

*Even while praying together in front of the tablets ancestral,  
Lovers find chance to murmur prayers never meant for the
dead!*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

And as for interrupters:—

*Hateful the wind or rain that ruins the bloom of flowers:  
Even more hateful for who obstructs the way of love*.

Yet the help of the Gods is earnestly besought:—

*I make my hyaku-dô, traveling Love's dark pathway,  
Ever praying to meet the owner of my heart.*<sup>\[2\]</sup>

\[1.

Ekô suru toté  
Hotoké no maé yé  
Futari mukaité,  
       Konabé daté.

Lit.: "Repeat prayers saying, dead-of-presence-in twain
facing,—small-pan cooking!" "*Hotoké* means a dead person as well as a
Buddha. (See my Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan: "The Household Shrine").
*Konabé-daté* is an idiomatic expression signifying a lovers'
tête-à-tête. It is derived from the phrase, *Chin-chin kamo nabé*
("cooking a wild duck in a pan"),—the idea suggested being that of the
pleasure experienced by an amorous couple in eating out of the same
dish. *Chin-chin*, an onomatope, expresses the sound of the gravy
boiling.

2\. To perform the rite called "o-hyaku-dô" means to make one hundred
visits to a temple, saying a prayer each time. The expression "dark way
of Love" (*koi no yami* or *yamiji*) is a Buddhist phrase; love, being
due to *mayoi*, or <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> illusion, is a
state of spiritual darkness. The term "owner of my heart" is an
attempted rendering of the Japanese word *nushi*, signifying "master,"
"owner,"—often, also, "landlord,"—and, in love-matters, the lord or
master of the affection inspired.\]

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

   The interest attaching to the following typical group of love-songs
will be found to depend chiefly upon the Buddhist allusions:—

*In the bed of the River of Souls, or in waiting alone at evening,  
The pain differs nothing at all: to a mountain the pebble
grows.*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*Who furthest after illusion wanders on Love's dark pathway  
Is ever the clearest-seeing,*<sup>\[2\]</sup> *not the simple or dull*.

\[1.

Sai-no-kawara to  
Nushi matsu yoi we  
Koishi, koishi ga  
     Yama, to naru.

A more literal translation would be: "In the Sai-no-Kawara ('Dry bed of
the River of Souls') and in the evening when waiting for the loved one,
'*Koiski, Koiski*' becomes a mountain." There is a delicate pun here,—a
play on the word *Koishi*, which, as pronounced, though not as written,
may mean either "a small stone," or "longing to see." In the bed of the
phantom river, Sai-no-Kawa, the ghosts of children are obliged to pile
up little stones, the weight of which increases so as to tax their
strength to the utmost. There is a reference here also to a verse in the
Buddhist *wasan* of Jizô, describing the crying of the children for
their parents: "*Chichi koishi! haha koishi!*" (See *Glimpses of
Unfamiliar Japan*, vol. i. pp. 59-61.)

2\. Clearest-sighted,—that is, in worldly matters.\]

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

*Coldly seen from without our love looks utter folly:  
Who never has felt* mayoi *never could understand!*

*Countless the men must be who dwell in three thousand worlds;  
Yet among them all is none worthy to change for mine*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*However fickle I seem, my heart is never unfaithful  
Out of the slime itself, spotless the lotos grows*.<sup>\[2\]</sup>

*So that we stay together, even the Hell of the Blood Lake—  
Even the Mountain of Swords—will signify nothing at
all*.<sup>\[3\]</sup>

\[1.

San-zen sékai ni  
Otoko wa arédo,  
Nushi ni mi-kayeru  
    Hito wa nai.

   "San-zen sekai," the three thousand worlds, is a common Buddhist
expression. Literally translated, the above song runs:
"Three-thousand-worlds-in men are, but lover-to-exchange person is not."

2\. The familiar Buddhist simile is used more significantly here than
the Western reader might suppose from the above rendering. These are
supposed to be the words either of a professional singing-girl or of a
*jorô*. Her calling is derisively termed a *doro-midzu kagyô*
("foul-water occupation"); and her citation of the famous Buddhist
comparison in self-defense is particularly, and pathetically, happy.

3\.

Chi-no-Iké-Jigoku mo,  
Tsuragi-no-Yama mo,  
Futari-dzuré nara,  
Itoi 'a sénu.

The Hell of the Blood-Lake is a hell for women; and the Mountain of
Swords is usually depicted in Buddhist <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>
prints as a place of infernal punishment for men in especial.\]

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

*Not yet indeed is my body garbed in the ink-black habit;—  
But as for this heart bereaved, already it is a nun*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*My hair, indeed, is uncut; but my heart has become a religious;  
A nun it shall always be till the hour I meet him again*.

But even the priest or nun is not always exempt from the power of
*mayoi*:—

*I am wearing the sable garb,—and yet, through illusion of longing,  
Ever I lose my way,—knowing not whither or where!*

   So far, my examples have been principally chosen from the more
serious class of *dodoitsu*. But in *dodoitsu* of a lighter class the
Buddhist allusions are perhaps even more frequent. The following group
of five will serve for specimens of hundreds:—

\[1. In the original much more pretty and much more simple:—

Sumi no koromo ni  
Mi wa yatsusanedo,  
Kokoro hitotsu wa  
        Ama-hôshi.

Ink-black-*koromo* \[priest's or nun's outer robe\] in, body not clad,
but heart-one nun." *Hitotsu*, "one," also means "solitary," "forlorn,"
"bereaved." *Ama hôshi*, lit.: "nun-priest."\]

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

*Never can be recalled the word too quickly spoken:  
Therefore with Emma's face the lover receives the
prayer*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>

*Thrice did I hear that prayer with Buddha's face; but hereafter  
My face shall be Emma's face because of too many prayers*.

*Now they are merry together; but under their boat is
Jigoku*.<sup>\[2\]</sup>  
*Blow quickly, thou river-wind,—blow a typhoon for my sake!*

*Vainly, to make him stay, I said that the crows were night
crows;*<sup>\[3\]</sup>—  
*The bell of the dawn peals doom,—the bell that cannot lie.*

\[1. The implication is that he has hastily promised more than he wishes
to perform. Emma, or Yemma (Sansc. Yama), is the Lord of Hell and Judge
of Souls; and, as depicted in Buddhist sculpture and painting, is more
than fearful to look upon. There is an evident reference in this song to
the Buddhist proverb: *Karu-toki no Jizô-gao; nasu-toki no Emma-gao*
("Borrowing-time, the face of Jizô; repaying-time, the face of Emma").

2\. "Jigoku" is the Buddhist name for various hells (Sansc. *narakas*).
The allusion here is to the proverb, *Funa-ita ichi-mai shita wa
Jigoku*: "Under \[*the thickness of*\] a single boat-plank is
hell,"—referring to the perils of the sea. This song is a satire on
jealousy; and the boat spoken of is probably a roofed pleasure-boat,
such as excursions are made into the sound of music.

3\. *Tsuki-yo-garasu*, lit.: "moon-night crows." Crows usually announce
the dawn by their cawing; but sometimes on moonlight nights they caw at
all hours from sunset to saw <span id="page_207">p. 207</span> rise. The
bell referred to is the bell of some Buddhist temple: the *aké-no-kane*,
or "dawn-bell," being, in all parts of Japan, sounded from every
Buddhist *tera*. There is a pun in the original;—the expression
*tsukenai*, "cannot tell \[a lie\]," might also be interpreted
phonetically as "cannot *strike* \[a bell\]."\]

*This my desire: To kill the crows of three thousand worlds,  
And then to repose in peace with the owner of my heart!*<sup>\[1\]</sup>

have cited this last only as a curiosity. For it has a strange history,
and is not what it seems,—although the apparent motive was certainly
suggested by some song like the one immediately preceding it. It is a
song of loyalty, and was composed by Kido of Chôshû, one of the leaders
in that great movement which brought about the downfall of the
Shôgunate, the restoration of the Imperial power, the reconstruction of
Japanese society, and the introduction and adoption of Western
civilization. Kido, Saigô, and Ôkubo are rightly termed the three heroes
of the restoration. While preparing his plans at Kyôto, in company with
his friend Saigô, Kido composed

\[1.

San-zen sékai no  
Karasu wo koroshi  
Nushi to soi-né ga  
    Shité mitai!

\]

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

and sang this song as an intimation of his real sentiments. By the
phrase, "ravens of the three thousand worlds," he designated the
Tokugawa partisans; by the word *nushi* (lord, or heart's-master) he
signified the Emperor; and by the term *soiné* (reposing together) he
referred to the hoped-for condition of direct responsibility to the
Throne, without further intervention of Shôgun and daimyô. It was not
the first example in Japanese history of the use of popular song as a
medium for the utterance of opinions which, expressed in plainer
language, would have invited assassination.

 

   While I was writing the preceding note upon Kido's song, the Buddhist
phrase, *Sanzen sékai* (twice occurring, as the reader will have
observed, in the present collection), suggested a few reflections with
which this paper may fitly conclude. I remember that when, I first
attempted, years ago, to learn the outlines of Buddhist philosophy, one
fact which particularly impressed me was the vastness of the Buddhist
concept of the universe. Buddhism, as I read it, had not offered itself
to

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

humanity as a saving creed for one inhabited world, but as the religion
of "innumerable hundreds of thousands of myriads of
kôtis<sup>\[1\]</sup> of worlds." And the modern scientific revelation
of stellar evolution and dissolution then seemed to me, and still seems,
like a prodigious confirmation of certain Buddhist theories of cosmical
law.

   The man of science to-day cannot ignore the enormous suggestions of
the new story that the heavens are telling. He finds himself compelled
to regard the development of what we call mind as a general phase or
incident in the ripening of planetary life throughout the universe. He
is obliged to consider the relation of our own petty sphere to the great
swarming of suns and systems as no more than the relation of a single
noctiluca to the phosphorescence of a sea. By its creed the Oriental
intellect has been better prepared than the Occidental to accept this
tremendous revelation, not as a wisdom that increaseth sorrow, but as a
wisdom to quicken faith. And I cannot but think that out of the certain
future union of Western knowledge

\[1. 1 kôti = 10,000,000.\]

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

with Eastern thought there must eventually proceed a Neo-Buddhism
inheriting all the strength of Science, yet spiritually able to
recompense the seeker after truth with the recompense foretold in the
twelfth chapter of the Sutra of the Diamond-Cutter. Taking the text as
it stands,—in despite of commentators,—what more could be unselfishly
desired from any spiritual teaching than the reward promised in that
verse,—"*They shall be endowed with the Highest Wonder*"?
