    A SHORT HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF THE BON RELIGION  (PART 2)

    THE FOUNDER AND HIS TEACHINGS:

        The founder of Bon religion is the Lord Shenrab Mibo (gShen-rab Mi-bo). In 
    past ages there were three brothers, Dagpa (Dag-pa), Salba (aSal-ba), and 
    Shepa (Shes-pa), who studied the Bon doctrines in the heaven named Sridpa 
    (Srid-pa) Yesang (Ye-sangs), under the Bon sage Bumtri Logi Chechan ('Bum-khri 
    glog-gi-lce-can). When their studies were completed, they visited the God of 
    Compassion, Shenlha Okar (gShen-lha 'od-dkar) and asked him how they could 
    help the living beings submerged in the misery and sorrow of suffering. He 
    advised them to act as guides to mankind in three successive ages of the 
    world. To follow his advice the eldest brother Dagpa completed his work in the 
    past world age. The second brother Salba took the name Shenrab and became 
    the teacher and guide of the present world age. The youngest brother Shepa 
    will come to teach in the next world age.

        The Lord Shenrab was born in the Barpo Sogye Palace to the south of 
    Mount Yungdrung. He was born a prince, married while young and had children.
    At the age of 31 he renounced the world and lived in austerity, teaching the 
    doctrine. During his whole life his efforts to propagate the Bon religion were 
    obstructed by the demon Khyabpa (Khyab-pa) Lagring (Lag-ring). This demon 
    fought to destroy or impede the work of Tonpa Shenrab untill he was eventually 
    converted and became his disciple. Once, pursuing the demon to regain his 
    stolen horses, Tonpa Shenrab arrived in Tibet; it was his only visit to Tibet.
    There he imparted some instructions concerning the performance of rituals but, 
    on the whole, found the land unprepared to receive fuller teachings. Before 
    leaving Tibet he prophesied that all his teachings would flourish in Tibet 
    when the time was ripe. Tonpa Shenrab departed this life at the age of 82.

        There are three biographies of Tonpa Shenrab. The earliest and shortest 
    one is known as Dodu (mDo-'dus): "Epitome of Aphorism". The second which is
    in two volumes is called Zermik (gZer-mig): "Piercing Eye". These two accounts
    date from the 10th and 11th centuries respectively. The third and largest is 
    in twelve volumes and is known as Zhiji (gZhi-brjid): "The Glorious". It 
    belongs to the category of scriptures known as "spiritual transmission" 
    (bsNyan-rgyud). It is believed to have been dictated to Londen Nyingpo (bLo-
    ldan snying-po) who lived in the fourteenth century.
