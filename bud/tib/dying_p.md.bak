    Introduction
    ============
    In discussing the spiritual needs of the dying from the Buddhist
    perspective, we firstly need to look at several key points, namely:

    gaining an understanding of the shortness and preciousness of life.
    considering what can help ourselves and others at the same time of
    death.
    considering what goes on after death.
    the Buddhist concept of mind.


    Reflections On Death
    ====================
    In order to gain an understanding of the shortness and preciousness of
    life and how to make it meaningful we need to reflect on the fact that
    death is certain and that the time of death is uncertain. These points
    may seem obvious but we rarely stop to consider the truth of them.
    For example, when we consider that death is certain we can reflect on
    several points:
            1) there is no possible way to escape death (nobody ever has), 
            2) life has a definite, inflexible limit and each moment brings
    us closer to the end of this life, and
            3) death comes in a moment and it's time is unexpected (and
    even while alive we devote very little of our life to spiritual
    practice). 

    When reflecting on the fact that the time of death in uncertain we can
    analyse this further by recognising that:
            1) the duration of our lifespan is uncertain - young people can
    die before old people, the healthy before the sick, etc.
            2) there are many causes and circumstances that lead to death
    but few that favour the sustenance of life - in fact even the things
    that sustain life and make it comfortable can kill us e.g. food, our
    house, our car.
            3) the weakness and fragility of our body contributes to life's
    uncertainty - our body can be easily destroyed by disease or accident.

    Reflecting on these points can help us to realise that life is short
    and precious and that there is no time to lose. It is good to remind
    ourselves of these points each day. It can be very helpful when first
    getting up each day to say to ourselves "today may be the last day of
    my life, let me live it therefore by making it as meaningful as
    possible, being of benefit to others, etc.".

    It can also be very helpful to consider how we would react if we were
    told, for example, that we only had 3 or 6 months to live, to ask
    ourselves questions like:
    am I ready to die?      
    what unfinished business do I have?     
    what do I want to do or achieve in the time I have left?
    will my priorities change?
    what can help me at the time of death?
    or as somebody put it "Live each day as though it were your last and
    one day you'll be right!"



    The other critical point is to consider what will help us at the time
    of death. Reflection here reveals that:
            1) worldly possessions such as wealth, position or money can't
    help us
            2) relatives and friends can neither prevent death nor go with
    us
            3) even our own precious body is of no help to us and we have
    to leave it behind.
     
    So ultimately the only thing that can help us is the state of our mind,
    the state of our mental or spiritual development.


    Karma and the mind
    ==================
    How is this so? The Buddhist belief is that every action of body,
    speech and mind that we create lays down a subtle imprint in our mind
    which has the potential to ripen as future happiness or suffering,
    depending on whether the action was positive or negative. These
    imprints remain in the mind until they ripen or until they are purified
    or cleansed by spiritual practices. This process in known as the law of
    karma.

    The mind itself is formless, shapeless, colourless, genderless, and has
    the ability to know or cognize all phenomena. It's basic nature is
    luminous and knowing. The mind also has different levels - gross,
    subtle, and very subtle. The very subtle mind is very clear and is
    usually only experienced at the time of death or during advanced
    meditation practices. The imprints of our actions (karmic imprints) are
    stored in the very subtle mind.

    Death, intermediate state and rebirth
    =====================================
    At the time of death, the body and mind go through a process of
    dissolution, where the 25 psycho-physical constituents that we are
    comprised of gradually absorb and lose their ability to function.1 This
    process of dissolution is associated with external and internal signs.
    This process continues even after the breathing ceases, for up to 3
    days.

    During this process the mind becomes more and more subtle and clear
    until it eventually reaches the point of the 'clear light of death',
    where it is said to be approximately 9 times more clear than in the
    normal waking state. At this point the mind separates from the body,
    taking with it all of the subtle imprints from that life and previous
    ones.

    This very subtle mind or consciousness and the very subtle wind upon
    which it rides then arises into an intermediate state (bardo) being
    which has a subtle (non-physical) body that can move through solid
    objects, travel anywhere just by thinking of that place, and so on. The
    intermediate state being stays in that state for up to 7 weeks, by
    which time a suitable place of rebirth is usually found. This place of
    rebirth is determined by the force of karma, whereby the intermediate
    state being dies and the consciousness is propelled without control
    towards the place of rebirth. The consciousness enters the fertilized
    egg at or near the moment of conception and the new life begins.

    Crucial in this whole process is the state of mind at the time of
    death, because it is this that determines the situation a person will
    be reborn into. If the mind is calm and peaceful and imbued with
    positive thoughts at the time of death, this will augur well for a
    happy rebirth. However, if the mind is in a state of anger or has
    strong desire or is fearful etc, this will predispose to an unhappy or
    lower type of rebirth.

    The mind that arises at the time of death is usually the one that the
    person is most habituated to. People tend to die in character, although
    this is not always so. So in the Buddhist tradition it is emphasised
    strongly that the time to prepare for death is now, because if we
    develop and gain control over our mind now and create many positive
    causes we will have a calm and controlled mind at the time of death and
    be free of fear. In effect, our whole life is a preparation for death
    and it is said that the mark of a spiritual practitioner is to have no
    regrets at the time of death. As a friend of mine said recently on
    hearing about these concepts, "Perhaps it's time I started swotting for
    the finals!"

    The spiritual needs of the dying
    ================================
    When considering the spiritual needs of the dying, the basic principle
    is to do whatever you can do to help the person die with a calm and
    peaceful mind, with spiritual/positive thoughts uppermost. This is
    because it is believed that the state of mind at the time of death is
    vitally important and plays an important role in determining what will
    happen to the person after death.

    So whether we are a doctor or nurse relieving pain and other
    distressing symptoms and reassuring the family, a counsellor helping to
    resolve emotional issues, a minister of religion offering spiritual
    counsel, or a volunteer who offers companionship and support for the
    dying person and their loved ones, we are all contributing
    significantly towards obtaining this calm and peaceful state of mind. 

    Within this basic principle, there are several ways we can categorise
    people which will help to determine the type of spiritual support that
    they need, namely:
            Is the person conscious or unconscious?
                    - if conscious, you can do the practices with them or
    get them to do them
                    - if unconscious, you have to do the practices for them 
            Does the person have specific religious beliefs or not?
                    - if religious, remind them of their religious
    practices
                    - if not religious, encourage them to have positive
    thoughts, or remind them of positive things they have done

    For a person with a spiritual faith it is beneficial to have spiritual
    objects around them e.g. an altar, a rosary, photos of their spiritual
    teacher, or to play spiritual music, or to burn incense, and so on -
    whatever reminds them of their spiritual practice. It is good also to
    talk to them about their spiritual practices, recite prayers with them
    and so forth. For an unconscious person it is said to be good to recite
    prayers, mantras etc into their ear.

    If a person does not have a spiritual faith, it is helpful to remind
    them of positive things they have done in their life, or of positive
    qualities such as love and compassion and kindness.

    It is important to avoid religious activities that are inappropriate or
    unwanted by the dying person. Someone standing at the end of the bed
    reciting prayers may be an annoyance, and I have seen a case of an
    attempted deathbed salvation which greatly angered the dying person.

    The basic aim is to avoid any objects or people that generate strong
    attachment or anger in the mind of the dying person. From the spiritual
    viewpoint it is desirable to avoid loud shows of emotion in the
    presence of the dying person. We have to remind ourselves that the
    dying process is of great spiritual importance and we don't want to
    disturb the mind of the dying person, which is in an increasingly clear
    and subtle state. We have to do whatever we can to allow the person to
    die in a calm/happy/peaceful state of mind.


    Meditations for sick and dying people
    =====================================
    For those who have advanced illness but are still conscious there are a
    number of simple meditation techniques or visualisations that can be
    very helpful.

    For those who are anxious or fearful of dying, teaching them relaxation
    or guiding them through a simple relaxation technique can be very
    beneficial. I will usually leave them a relaxation tape that they can
    use any time of day or night, whenever the need arises. When
    appropriate, touch, massage, reflexology and similar techniques can
    also be very soothing and stress-relieving, especially as the person
    may be somewhat starved of touch due to the fears and awkwardness of
    people who visit them. 

    A simple meditation technique that is very effective is awareness of
    the breath. The person becomes aware of the movement of the breath
    inwards and outwards at the level of the nostrils, breathing naturally
    and easily, not forcing or exaggerating the breath. At the same time,
    any thoughts that arise are let go of, constantly bringing the mind
    back to the breath. This technique, although simple, can generate very
    calm states of mind and relieve anxiety.

    When the awareness of breath is then combined with the recitation of
    certain words or mantras or prayer it becomes very powerful. Just to
    say "Let...go...let...go..." in time with the in and out breaths can be
    soothing and relaxing. A person with a spiritual belief can use a
    prayer or mantra with the breath. For example, one lady whom I was
    visiting who was an ex-Catholic nun chose the prayer "not mine, Lord,
    but thy will be done". She shortened this by reciting "Not my will" on
    the in-breath and "but yours" on the out-breath, repeating this over
    and over again.

    The beauty of this technique is that 1) it can be done for short
    periods of time and requires little concentration, which is often
    reduced by the effects of disease and medication, 2) it helps to calm
    the mind and reduce anxiety, 3) it utilizes and strengthens the
    person's spiritual refuge, 4) it does not require anything other than
    the breath.

    For both a religious and a non-religious person a white light 'healing'
    meditation can bring a lot of comfort and benefit. The person
    visualizes a brilliant ball of white light above their head, with the
    light streaming down through their bodies, removing sickness, pain,
    fear, anxiety and filling the body with blissful healing light energy.
    Depending on the person's belief system, they can see the light as
    being in the nature of Jesus, or Buddha or some other spiritual figure,
    or they can just visualise it as a source of universal healing energy.
    This meditation combines very well with the breath awareness technique
    and is also good to have on tape to leave with the person, to be used
    whenever needed day or night. When a person is close to death they can
    also be encouraged to let go into the light, into the heart of Jesus or
    Buddha seated above their head, whatever is appropriate for that
    person.

    The use of guided imagery or gentle music can also be soothing and
    relaxing and help the person to have a calm and peaceful mind as they
    approach death.

    A person in pain can also be guided through a pain meditation, a
    technique whereby the pain is explored in detail, often leading to a
    reduction or eradication of the pain.2A very profound meditative
    technique is to actually use the illness or pain as a way of developing
    compassion. For those who can use this technique the results can be
    very great. The person is encouraged to think that "by me experiencing
    this cancer/AIDS/pain etc, may all other beings in the world be free of
    this, and may they have good health, happiness and long life". The
    person uses their sickness or pain as a way of opening their heart to
    others who are in a similar situation. People who have used this
    technique have often gone from being totally caught up in their own
    misery to a state of open-heartedness and peace.

    An even more advanced technique is the meditation on "taking and giving
    on the breath" as described in the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures. In this
    meditation, one visualises taking on the suffering of all other living
    beings (or this could be restricted to those with cancer or AIDS etc)
    in the form of black smoke, which is taken in on the in-breath. Then on
    the out-breath all of our health and happiness and all positive
    qualities are sent out to other living beings in the form of white
    light, and we visualise them receiving everything that they want. At
    our heart we visualise a black rock of selfishness, and as the black
    smoke is inhaled we visualise it hitting the black rock and smashing it
    completely, thus eradicating all trace of selfishness from our minds.

    This meditation is a profound method for developing compassion quickly
    but there will only be a minority of patients who will be able to use
    this method. The usual way to progress in these meditations is to start
    with small problems such as a headache or tiredness etc, then gradually
    train our minds to transform bigger and bigger problems.




    Conclusion 
    ==========
    The aim of all these methods is to help the dying person die with a
    calm, happy and positive mind. Anything that we can do to achieve this
    will benefit the person, whether that be good nursing care and pain
    relief, massage, the presence of a loving family, or whatever. It is
    said that the best thing we can bring to a dying person is our own
    quiet and peaceful mind.

    In this way we will help the dying person make the transition from this
    life to the next as smooth and as meaningful as possible, recognising
    the vital spiritual importance of this transition.

    My wish is that this short paper may in some way be of benefit to those
    who read it and reflect on it, and hence to the sick or suffering
    people that you serve.
