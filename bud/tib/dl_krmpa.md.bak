    The Press Release below (which was printed on Rumteck Monastery
    stationary) has been passed to me by Namgyal Tsering, a monk in Situ
    Rinpoche. He tells me that Situ Rinpoche wishes to see it widely
    circulated. It was published following some disturbances in Delhi at
    the time of Tenzin Chentse's "enthronement" ceremony.

    ============================================================
    New Delhi. April 4, 1994

    Press Release
               THE DALAI LAMA REAFFIRMS
            THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE KARMAPA
                 TO THE KAGYU THRONE

    The entire Tibetan community were greatly preturbed when a small
    faction of the Karma Kargyu order of Tibetan Buddhists, on 17
    March 1994, suddenly performed a welcome ceremony at Delhi for a
    young boy allegedly named Tenzin Chentse who they claim on the basis
    of some vague credentials to be the seventeenth Karmapa.
    The indignation and consequent scuffles that followed are a
    matter of sorrow and regret to a community that deeply believes
    in truth, peace and harmony.

    His Holiness the Dalai Lama, on 29th March 1994 received a
    delegation representing almost all the heads of the Kagyu order
    and was appraised of these unfortunate developments. He strongly
    reaffirmed that there can only be one Karmapa on the throne and
    the he is Ugyen Trinlay Dorji who has already been enthroned at
    Tsurphu in Tibet. The Dalai Lama reiterated that this decision is
    final and impossible to change.

    The Dalai Lama was distressed by some media and other reports
    concerning these matters and instructed his cabinet to write to
    all Tibetan Buddhists, The Home minister of india and the  Chief
    minister of the State of Sikkim affirming his satisfaction
    concerning the enthronement of the 17th Karmapa and dismissed as
    baseless some mischevous allegations concerning any Chinese
    connection.

    In our capacities as the leaders  of the Kagyu order of  Tibetan
    Buddhists,  we are making our official position clear that there
    can  be no other Karmapa than Ugyen Trinley Dorji.  Today,  the
    Kagyu order is one among the four major Tibetan Mahayana Buddhist
    orders and accounts for about 20% of the Tibetan followers and
    between a third to a half of the followers in Sikkim, Ladakh,
    Bhutan and Nepal. This order also has  a large following among
    some 100,00 foreigners from, South East Asia, Europe and
    North America.  It has nearly 200 monasteries in  Tibet, 30 in
    India and Nepal and over 200 meditation centres around the world.

                1


    The supreme head of the Karma Kagyu order has always been the
    Karmapa in a succession of incarnations since the eleventh
    century. His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa passed away on
    November 5, 1981 at the age of 58. The four regents agreed, in
    writing, to administer the affairs of the sect by rotation.  The
    'letter of prediction' was discovered in a brocade talisman which
    the Karmapa had given to Tai Situ Rimpoche ten months before his
    passing away on November 5, 1981. This discovery was shown to all
    the regents on March 22, 1992 and was initially greeted by
    universal joy. However, soon thereafter, Shamar Rimpoche and his
    followers began to behave strangely and threaten the solidarity
    of the Kagyu community.

    Details concerning all these events, the circumstances of the
    discovery of the seventeenth Karmapa on the basis of the 'letter
    of prediction', his formal approval by the Dalai Lama, his
    enthronement at Tsurphu in Tibet and the unfortunate incidents on
    March 17, 1994 are noted in the attached background note.


    On behalf of all members of the Kagyu community we collectively
    appeal to all followers and especially the followers of our dear
    and respected colleague Shamar Rimpoche to honour the sacred
    tradition of Tibetan incarnation where there can only be one
    incarnation of the revered Karmapa. We earnestly appeal to all
    followers of the Kagyu order so that we can stand together and
    ensure that no external interests can break our unity and we can
    all work together for truth, peace and harmony which is our
    message to the world in these troubled times.

    Attached to the preceeding Press Release was another document, also
    dated April 4th, 1994 and titled "A Background note concerning the
    Kagyu Order of Tibetan Buddhism and issues relating to the Karmapa
    incarnation."

    As several people in this thread seem to have already read the
    so-called "Karmapa Papers" -(apparently representing the views of
    Sharma Rinpoche and his followers) - I will also be posting this
    background note here once I have re-typed it from the hard copy) as it
    represents the case as stated by the followers of Situ Rinpoche and
    the Karmapa enthroned at Tsurphu.
