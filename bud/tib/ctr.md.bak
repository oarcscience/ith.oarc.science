                   Biography of Chagdud Rinpoche

       Chagdud Rinpoche, abbot of Chagdud Gonpa, fled Tibet during the
    Chinese invasion and worked tirelessly over the next twenty years in
    Tibetan refugee camps in India and Nepal. At the urging of Western
    students, he came to the United States in 1979 and has dedicated his
    remaining years to the preservation of the Tibetan Buddhist arts and
    teachings.
     
       Rinpoche is a highly realized meditation master and accomplished
    scholar, artist and poet. As part of his lama training, which began at
    the age of five, he received extensive instruction in all aspects of
    Tibetan Buddhism, completed two three-year retreats, and studied with
    some of the greatest Dzogchen and Vajrayana masters of his time. His
    extensive training, along with his humor, compassion and skill as a
    teacher, has made it possible for him to transmit his profound
    insights to people of widely divergent backgrounds and interests.
    Chagdud Rinpoche's generation is the last to have absorbed the full
    cultural and spiritual heritage of Tibet and he is among those few who
    are bringing this knowledge to the West.
