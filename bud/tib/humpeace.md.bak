    Introduction
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    When we rise in the morning and listen to the radio or read the 
    newspaper, we are confronted with the same sad news: violence, 
    crime, wars, and disasters. I cannot recall a single day without 
    a report of something terrible happening somewhere. Even in 
    these modern times it is clear that one's precious life is not 
    safe. No former generation has had to experience so much bad 
    news as we face today; this constant awareness of fear and 
    tension should make any sensitive and compassionate person 
    question seriously the progress of our modern world.
       
       It is ironic that the more serious problems emanate from the 
    more industrially advanced societies. Science and technology 
    have worked wonders in many fields, but the basic human 
    problems remain. There is unprecedented literacy, yet this 
    universal education does not seem to have fostered goodness, 
    but only mental restlessness and discontent instead. There is 
    no doubt about the increase in our material progress and 
    technology, but somehow this is not sufficient as we have not 
    yet succeeded in bringing about peace and happiness or in 
    overcoming suffering.
       
       We can only conclude that there must be something seriously 
    wrong with our progress and development, and if we do not check 
    it in time there could be disastrous consequences for the 
    future of humanity. I am not at all against science and 
    technology -- they have contributed immensely to the overall 
    experience of humankind; to our material comfort and well-being 
    and to our greater understanding of the world we live in. But 
    if we give too much emphasis to science and technology we are 
    in danger of losing touch with those aspects of human knowledge 
    and understanding that aspire towards honesty and altruism.
       
       Science and technology, though capable of creating 
    immeasurable material comfort, cannot replace the age-old 
    spiritual and humanitarian values that have largely shaped 
    world civilization, in all its national forms, as we know it 
    today. No one can deny the unprecedented material benefit of 
    science and technology, but our basic human problems remain; we 
    are still faced with the same, if not more, suffering, fear, 
    and tension. Thus it is only logical to try to strike a balance 
    between material development on the one hand and the 
    development of spiritual, human values on the other. In order 
    to bring about this great adjustment, we need to revive our 
    humanitarian values.
       
       I am sure that many people share my concern about the 
    present worldwide moral crisis and will join in my appeal to 
    all humanitarians and religious practitioners who also share 
    this concern to help make our societies more compassionate, 
    just, and equitable. I do not speak as a Buddhist or even as a 
    Tibetan. Nor do I speak as an expert on international politics 
    (though I unavoidably comment on these matters). Rather, I 
    speak simply as a human being, as an upholder of the 
    humanitarian values that are the bedrock not only of Mahayana 
    Buddhism but of all the great world religions. From this 
    perspective I share with you my personal outlook-that

        1 universal humanitarianism is essential to solve global 
            problems;
        2 compassion is the pillar of world peace;
        3 all world religions are already for world peace in this way, 
            as are all humanitarians of whatever ideology;
        4 each individual has a universal responsibility to shape 
            institutions to serve human needs.




    Solving Human Problems through Transforming Human Attitudes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Of the many problems we face today, some are natural calamities 
    and must be accepted and faced with equanimity. Others, 
    however, are of our own making, created by misunderstanding, 
    and can be corrected. One such type arises from the conflict of 
    ideologies, political or religious, when people fight each 
    other for petty ends, losing sight of the basic humanity that 
    binds us all together as a single human family. We must 
    remember that the different religions, ideologies, and 
    political systems of the world are meant for human beings to 
    achieve happiness. We must not lose sight of this fundamental 
    goal and at no time should we place means above ends; the 
    supremacy of humanity over matter and ideology must always be 
    maintained.

       By far the greatest single danger facing humankind -- in 
    fact, all living beings on our planet -- is the threat of 
    nuclear destruction. I need not elaborate on this danger, but I 
    would like to appeal to all the leaders of the nuclear powers 
    who literally hold the future of the world in their hands, to 
    the scientists and technicians who continue to create these 
    awesome weapons of destruction, and to all the people at large 
    who are in a position to influence their leaders: I appeal to 
    them to exercise their sanity and begin to work at dismantling 
    and destroying all nuclear weapons. We know that in the event 
    of a nuclear war there will be no victors because there will be 
    no survivors! Is it not frightening just to contemplate such 
    inhuman and heartless destruction? And, is it not logical that 
    we should remove the cause for our own destruction when we know 
    the cause and have both the time and the means to do so? Often 
    we cannot overcome our problems because we either do not know 
    the cause or, if we understand it, do not have the means to 
    remove it. This is not the case with the nuclear threat.


    Whether they belong to more evolved species like humans or to 
    simpler ones such as animals, all beings primarily seek peace, 
    comfort, and security. Life is as dear to the mute animal as it 
    is to any human being; even the simplest insect strives for 
    protection from dangers that threaten its life. Just as each 
    one of us wants to live and does not wish to die, so it is with 
    all other creatures in the universe, though their power to 
    effect this is a different matter.    

      Broadly speaking there are two types of happiness and suffering, 
    mental and physical, and of the two, I believe that mental 
    suffering and happiness are the more acute. Hence, I stress the
    training of the mind to endure suffering and attain a more lasting 
    state of happiness. However, I also have a more general and concrete 
    idea of happiness: a combination of inner peace, economic 
    development, and, above all, world peace. To achieve such goals I 
    feel it is necessary to develop a sense of universal responsibility, 
    a deep concern for all irrespective of creed, colour, sex, or 
    nationality.    

      The premise behind this idea of universal responsibility is 
    the simple fact that, in general terms, all others' desires 
    are the same as mine. Every being wants happiness and does not 
    want suffering. If we, as intelligent human beings, do not accept 
    this fact, there will be more and more suffering on this planet. 
    If we adopt a self-centered approach to life and constantly try 
    to use others for our own self-interest, we may gain temporary 
    benefits, but in the long run we will not succeed in achieving 
    even personal happiness,  and world peace will be completely out 
    of the question.    

      In their quest for happiness, humans have used different methods, 
    which all too often have been cruel and repellent. Behaving in 
    ways utterly unbecoming to their status as humans, they inflict 
    suffering upon fellow humans and the other living beings for 
    their own selfish gains. In the end, such short-sighted actions 
    bring suffering to oneself as well as to others. To be born a 
    human being is a rare event in itself, and it is wise to use 
    this opportunity as effectively and skillfully as possible. We 
    must have the proper perspective, that of the universal life 
    process, so that the happiness or glory of one person or group 
    is not sought at the expense of others.    

      All this calls for a new approach to global problems. The world 
    is becoming smaller and smaller -- and more and more 
    interdependent -- as a result of rapid technological advances and 
    international trade as well as increasing trans-national relations. 
    We now depend very much on each other. In ancient times problems 
    were mostly family-size, and they were naturally tackled at the 
    family level, but the situation has changed. Today we are so 
    interdependent, so closely interconnected with each other, that 
    without a sense of universal responsibility, a feeling of universal 
    brotherhood and sisterhood, and an understanding and belief that we
    really are part of one big human family, we cannot hope to overcome 
    the dangers to our very existence -- let alone bring about peace 
    and happiness.

       One nation's problems can no longer be satisfactorily solved 
    by itself alone; too much depends on the interest, attitude, and 
    cooperation of other nations. A universal humanitarian approach 
    to world problems seems the only sound basis for world peace. 
    What does this mean: We begin from the recognition mentioned 
    previously that all beings cherish happiness and do not want 
    suffering. It then becomes both morally wrong and pragmatically 
    unwise to pursue only one's own happiness oblivious to the feelings 
    and aspirations of all others who surround us as members of the 
    same human family. The wiser course is to think of others also when 
    pursuing our own happiness. This will lead to what I call 'wise 
    self-interest,' which hopefully will transform itself into 
    'compromised self-interest,' or better still, 'mutual interest.'

      Although the increasing interdependence among nations might 
    be expected to generate more sympathetic cooperation, it is 
    difficult to achieve a spirit of genuine cooperation as long as 
    people remain indifferent to the feelings and happiness of 
    others. When people are motivated mostly by greed and jealousy, 
    it is not possible for them to live in harmony. A spiritual 
    approach may not solve all the political problems that have 
    been caused by the existing self-centered approach, but in the 
    long run it will overcome the very basis of the problems that 
    we face today.

       On the other hand, if humankind continues to approach its 
    problems considering only temporary expediency, future 
    generations will have to face tremendous difficulties. the 
    global population is increasing, and our resources are being 
    rapidly depleted. Look at the trees, for example. No one knows 
    exactly what adverse effects massive deforestation will have on 
    the climate, the soil, and global ecology as a whole. We are 
    facing problems because people are concentrating only on their 
    short-term, selfish interests, not thinking of the entire 
    human family. They are not thinking of the earth and the 
    long-term effects on universal life as a whole. If we of the 
    present generation do not think about these now, future 
    generations may not be able to cope with them.




    Compassion as the Pillar of World Peace
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    According to Buddhist psychology, most of our troubles are due 
    to our passionate desire for and attachment to things that we 
    misapprehend as enduring entities. The pursuit of the objects 
    of our desire and attachment involves the use of aggression and 
    competitiveness as supposedly efficacious instruments. These 
    mental processes easily translate into actions, breeding 
    belligerence as an obvious effect. Such processes have been 
    going on in the human mind since time immemorial, but their 
    execution has become more effective under modern conditions. 
    What can we do to control and regulate these 'poisons' -- delusion,
    greed, and aggression? For it is these poisons that are behind 
    almost every trouble in the world.

       As one brought up in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, I feel 
    that love and compassion are the moral fabric of world peace. 
    Let me first define what I mean by compassion. When you have 
    pity or compassion for a very poor person, you are showing 
    sympathy because he or she is poor; your compassion is based on 
    altruistic considerations. On the other hand, love towards your 
    wife, your husband, your children, or a close friend is usually 
    based on attachment. When your attachment changes, your 
    kindness also changes; it may disappear. This is not true love. 
    Real love is not based on attachment, but on altruism. In this 
    case your compassion will remain as a humane response to 
    suffering as long as beings continue to suffer.
       
       This type of compassion is what we must strive to cultivate 
    in ourselves, and we must develop it from a limited amount to 
    the limitless. Undiscriminating, spontaneous, and unlimited 
    compassion for all sentient beings is obviously not the usual 
    love that one has for friends or family, which is alloyed with 
    ignorance, desire, and attachment. The kind of love we should 
    advocate is this wider love that you can have even for someone 
    who has done harm to you: your enemy.
       
       The rationale for compassion is that every one of us wants 
    to avoid suffering and gain happiness. This, in turn, is based 
    on the valid feeling of 'I,' which determines the universal 
    desire for happiness. Indeed, all beings are born with similar 
    desires and should have an equal right to fulfill them. If I 
    compare myself with others, who are countless, I feel that 
    others are more important because I am just one person whereas 
    others are many. Further, the Tibetan Buddhist tradition 
    teaches us to view all sentient beings as our dear mothers and 
    to show our gratitude by loving them all. For, according to 
    Buddhist theory, we are born and reborn countless numbers of 
    times, and it is conceivable that each being has been our 
    parent at one time or another. In this way all beings in the 
    universe share a family relationship.
       
       Whether one believes in religion or not, there is no one who 
    does not appreciate love and compassion. Right from the moment 
    of our birth, we are under the care and kindness of our 
    parents; later in life, when facing the sufferings of disease 
    and old age, we are again dependent on the kindness of others. 
    If at the beginning and end of our lives we depend upon others' 
    kindness, why then in the middle should be not act kindly 
    towards others?
       
       The development of a kind heart (a feeling of closeness for 
    all human beings) does not involve the religiosity we normally 
    associate with conventional religious practice. It is not only 
    for people who believe in religion, but is for everyone 
    regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation. It is 
    for anyone who considers himself or herself, above all, a 
    member of the human family and who sees things from this larger 
    and longer perspective. This is a powerful feeling that we 
    should develop and apply; instead, we often neglect it, 
    particularly in our prime years when we experience a false 
    sense of security.
       
       When we take into account a longer perspective, the fact 
    that all wish to gain happiness and avoid suffering, and keep 
    in mind our relative unimportance in relation to countless 
    others, we can conclude that it is worthwhile to share our 
    possessions with others. When you train in this sort of 
    outlook, a true sense of compassion -- a true sense of love and 
    respect for others -- becomes possible. Individual happiness 
    ceases to be a conscious self-seeking effort; it becomes an 
    automatic and far superior by-product of the whole process of 
    loving and serving others.
       
       Another result of spiritual development, most useful in 
    day-to-day life, is that it gives a calmness and presence of 
    mind. Our lives are in constant flux, bringing many 
    difficulties. When faced with a calm and clear mind, problems 
    can be successfully resolved. When, instead, we lose control 
    over our minds through hatred, selfishness, jealousy, and 
    anger, we lose our sense of judgment. Our minds are blinded 
    and at those wild moments anything can happen, including war. 
    Thus, the practice of compassion and wisdom is useful to all, 
    especially to those responsible for running national affairs, 
    in whose hands lie the power and opportunity to create the 
    structure of world peace.



    World Religions for World Peace
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The principles discussed so far are in accordance with the 
    ethical teachings of all world religions. I maintain that every 
    major religion of the world -- Buddhism, Christianity, 
    Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism, Sikhism, 
    Taoism, Zoroastrianism -- has similar ideals of love, the same 
    goal of benefiting humanity through spiritual practice, and the 
    same effect of making their followers into better human beings. 
    All religions teach moral precepts for perfecting the functions 
    of mind, body, and speech. All religions agree upon the 
    necessity to control the undisciplined mind that harbors 
    selfishness and other roots of trouble, and each teaches a path 
    leading to a spiritual state that is peaceful, disciplined, 
    ethical, and wise. It is in this sense that I believe all 
    religions have essentially the same message. Differences of 
    dogma may be ascribed to differences of time and circumstance 
    as well as cultural influences; indeed, there is no end to 
    scholastic argument when we consider the purely metaphysical 
    side of religion. However, it is much more beneficial to try to 
    implement in daily life the shared precepts for goodness taught 
    by all religions rather than to argue about minor differences 
    in approach.
       
       There are many different religions to bring comfort and 
    happiness to humanity in much the same way as there are 
    particular treatments for different diseases. For, all 
    religions endeavor in their own way to help living beings 
    avoid misery and gain happiness. And, although we can find 
    causes for preferring certain interpretations of religious 
    truths, there is much greater cause for unity, stemming from 
    the human heart. Each religion works in its own way to lessen 
    human suffering and contribute to world civilization. 
    Conversion is not the point. For instance, I do not think of 
    converting others to Buddhism or merely furthering the Buddhist 
    cause. Rather, I try to think of how I as a Buddhist 
    humanitarian can contribute to human happiness.
       
       While pointing out the fundamental similarities between 
    world religions, I do not advocate one particular religion at 
    the expense of all others, nor do I seek a new 'world 
    religion.' All the different religions of the world are needed 
    to enrich human experience and world civilization. Our human 
    minds, being of different caliber and disposition, need 
    different approaches to peace and happiness. It is just like 
    food. Certain people find Christianity more appealing, others 
    prefer Buddhism because there is no creator in it and 
    everything depends upon your own actions. We can make similar 
    arguments for other religions as well. Thus, the point is 
    clear: humanity needs all the world's religions to suit the 
    ways of life, diverse spiritual needs, and inherited national 
    traditions of individual human beings.
       
       It is from this perspective that I welcome efforts being 
    made in various parts of the world for better understanding 
    among religions. The need for this is particularly urgent now. 
    If all religions make the betterment of humanity their main 
    concern, then they can easily work together in harmony for 
    world peace. Interfaith understanding will bring about the 
    unity necessary for all religions to work together. However, 
    although this is indeed an important step, we must remember 
    that there are no quick or easy solutions. We cannot hide the 
    doctrinal differences that exist among various faiths, nor can 
    we hope to replace the existing religions by a new universal 
    belief. Each religion has its own distinctive contributions to 
    make, and each in its own way is suitable to a particular group 
    of people as they understand life. The world needs them all.
     

    There are two primary tasks facing religious practitioners who 
    are concerned with world peace. First, we must promote better 
    interfaith understanding so as to create a workable degree of 
    unity among all religions. This may be achieved in part by 
    respecting each other's beliefs and by emphasizing our common 
    concern for human well-being. Second, we must bring about a 
    viable consensus on basic spiritual values that touch every 
    human heart and enhance general human happiness. This means we 
    must emphasize the common denominator of all world religions -- 
    humanitarian ideals. These two steps will enable us to act both 
    individually and together to create the necessary spiritual 
    conditions for world peace.
       
       We practitioners of different faiths can work together for 
    world peace when we view different religions as essentially 
    instruments to develop a good heart -- love and respect for 
    others, a true sense of community. The most important thing is 
    to look at the purpose of religion and not at the details of 
    theology or metaphysics, which can lead to mere 
    intellectualism. I believe that all the major religions of the 
    world can contribute to world peace and work together for the 
    benefit of humanity if we put aside subtle metaphysical 
    differences, which are really the internal business of each 
    religion.
       
       Despite the progressive secularization brought about by 
    worldwide modernization and despite systematic attempts in some 
    parts of the world to destroy spiritual values, the vast 
    majority of humanity continues to believe in one religion or 
    another. The undying faith in religion, evident even under 
    irreligious political systems, clearly demonstrates the potency 
    of religion as such. This spiritual energy and power can be 
    purposefully used to bring about the spiritual conditions 
    necessary for world peace. Religious leaders and humanitarians 
    all over the world have a special role to play in this respect.
       
       Whether we will be able to achieve world peace or not, we 
    have no choice but to work towards that goal. If our minds are 
    dominated by anger, we will lose the best part of human 
    intelligence -- wisdom, the ability to decide between right and 
    wrong. Anger is one of the most serious problems facing the 
    world today.
     


    Individual Power to Shape Institutions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Anger plays no small role in current conflicts such as those in 
    the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the North-South problem, and 
    so forth. These conflicts arise from a failure to understand 
    one another's humanness. The answer is not the development and 
    use of greater military force, nor an arms race. Nor is it 
    purely political or purely technological. Basically it is 
    spiritual, in the sense that what is required is a sensitive 
    understanding of our common human situation. Hatred and 
    fighting cannot bring happiness to anyone, even to the winners 
    of battles. Violence always produces misery and thus is 
    essentially counter-productive. It is, therefore, time for 
    world leaders to learn to transcend the differences of race, 
    culture, and ideology and to regard one another through eyes 
    that see the common human situation. To do so would benefit 
    individuals, communities, nations, and the world at large.
       
       The greater part of present world tension seems to stem from 
    the 'Eastern bloc' versus 'Western bloc' conflict that has been 
    going on since World War II. These two blocs tend to describe 
    and view each other in a totally unfavourable light. This 
    continuing, unreasonable struggle is due to a lack of mutual 
    affection and respect for each other as fellow human beings. 
    Those of the Eastern bloc should reduce their hatred towards 
    the Western bloc because the Western bloc is also made up of 
    human beings -- men, women, and children. Similarly those of the 
    Western bloc should reduce their hatred towards of the eastern 
    bloc because the Eastern bloc is also human beings. In such a 
    reduction of mutual hatred, the leaders of both blocs have a 
    powerful role to play. But first and foremost, leaders must 
    realize their own and others' humanness. Without this basic 
    realization, very little effective reduction of organized 
    hatred can be achieved.
       
       If, for example, the leader of the United States of America 
    and the leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
    suddenly met each other in the middle of a desolate island, I 
    am sure they would respond to each other spontaneously as 
    fellow human beings. But a wall of mutual suspicion and 
    misunderstanding separates them the moment they are identified 
    as the 'President of the USA and the 'Secretary-General of the 
    USSR'. More human contact in the form of informal extended 
    meetings, without any agenda, would improve their mutual 
    understanding; they would learn to relate to each other as 
    human beings and could then try to tackle international 
    problems based on this understanding. No two parties, 
    especially those with a history of antagonism, can negotiate 
    fruitfully in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and hatred.
       
       I suggest that world leaders meet about once a year in a 
    beautiful place without any business, just to get to know each 
    other as human beings. Then, later, they could meet to discuss 
    mutual and global problems. I am sure many others share my wish 
    that world leaders meet at the conference table in such an 
    atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding of each other's 
    humanness.


    To improve person-to-person contact in the world at large, I 
    would like to see greater encouragement of international 
    tourism. Also, mass media, particularly in democratic
    societies, can make a considerable contribution to world peace 
    by giving greater coverage to human interest items that reflect 
    the ultimate oneness of humanity. With the rise of a few big 
    powers in the international arena, the humanitarian role of 
    international organizations is being bypassed and neglected. I 
    hope that this will be corrected and that all international 
    organizations, especially the United Nations, will be more 
    active and effective in ensuring maximum benefit to humanity 
    and promoting international understanding. It will indeed be 
    tragic if the few powerful members continue to misuse world 
    bodies like the UN for their one-sided interests. The UN must 
    become the instrument of world peace. This world body must be 
    respected by all, for the UN is the only source of hope for 
    small oppressed nations and hence for the planet as a whole.
       
       As all nations are economically dependent upon one another 
    more than ever before, human understanding must go beyond 
    national boundaries and embrace the international community at 
    large. Indeed, unless we can create an atmosphere of genuine 
    cooperation, gained not by threatened or actual use of force 
    but by heartfelt understanding, world problems will only 
    increase. If people in poorer countries are denied the 
    happiness they desire and deserve, they will naturally be 
    dissatisfied and pose problems for the rich. If unwanted 
    social, political, and cultural forms continue to be imposed 
    upon unwilling people, the attainment of world peace is 
    doubtful. However, if we satisfy people at a heart-to-heart 
    level, peace will surely come.
       
       Within each nation, the individual ought to be given the 
    right to happiness, and among nations, there must be equal 
    concern for the welfare of even the smallest nations. I am not 
    suggesting that one system is better than another and all 
    should adopt it. On the contrary, a variety of political 
    systems and ideologies is desirable and accords with the 
    variety of dispositions within the human community. This 
    variety enhances the ceaseless human quest for happiness. Thus 
    each community should be free to evolve its own political and 
    socioeconomic system, based on the principle of 
    self-determination.
       
       The achievement of justice, harmony, and peace depends on 
    many factors. We should think about them in terms of human 
    benefit in the long run rather than the short term. I realize 
    the enormity of the task before us, but I see no other 
    alternative than the one I am proposing -- which is based on our 
    common humanity. Nations have no choice but to be concerned 
    about the welfare of others, not so much because of their 
    belief in humanity, but because it is in the mutual and 
    long-term interest of all concerned. An appreciation of this 
    new reality is indicated by the emergence of regional or 
    continental economic organizations such as the European 
    Economic Community, the Association of South East Asian 
    Nations, and so forth. I hope more such trans-national 
    organizations will be formed, particularly in regions where 
    economic development and regional stability seem in short 
    supply.
     

    Under present conditions, there is definitely a growing need 
    for human understanding and a sense of universal 
    responsibility. In order to achieve such ideas, we must 
    generate a good and kind heart, for without this, we can 
    achieve neither universal happiness nor lasting world peace. We 
    cannot create peace on paper. While advocating universal 
    responsibility and universal brotherhood and sisterhood, the 
    facts are that humanity is organized in separate entities in 
    the form of national societies. Thus, in a realistic sense, I 
    feel it is these societies that must act as the building-blocks 
    for world peace.

       Attempts have been made in the past to create societies more 
    just and equal. Institutions have been established with noble 
    charters to combat anti-social forces. Unfortunately, such 
    ideas have been cheated by selfishness. More than ever before, 
    we witness today how ethics and noble principles are obscured 
    by the shadow of self-interest, particularly in the political 
    sphere. There is a school of thought that warns us to refrain 
    from politics altogether, as politics has become synonymous 
    with amorality. Politics devoid of ethics does not further 
    human welfare, and life without morality reduces humans to the 
    level of beasts. However, politics is not axiomatically 'dirty.' 
    Rather, the instruments of our political culture have distorted 
    the high ideals and noble concepts meant to further human 
    welfare. Naturally, spiritual people express their concern 
    about religious leaders 'messing' with politics, since they 
    fear the contamination of religion by dirty politics.

       I question the popular assumption that religion and ethics 
    have no place in politics and that religious persons should 
    seclude themselves as hermits. Such a view of religion is too 
    one-sided; it lacks a proper perspective on the individual's 
    relation to society and the role of religion in our lives. 
    Ethics is as crucial to a politician as it is to a religious 
    practitioner. Dangerous consequences will follow when 
    politicians and rulers forget moral principles. Whether we 
    believe in God or karma, ethics is the foundation of every 
    religion.

       Such human qualities as morality, compassion, decency, 
    wisdom, and so forth have been the foundations of all 
    civilizations. These qualities must be cultivated and sustained 
    through systematic moral education in a conductive social 
    environment so that a more humane world may emerge. The 
    qualities required to create such a world must be inculcated 
    right from the beginning, from childhood. We cannot wait for 
    the next generation to make this change; the present generation 
    must attempt a renewal of basic human values. If there is any 
    hope, it is in the future generations, but not unless we 
    institute major change on a worldwide scale in our present 
    educational system. We need a revolution in our commitment to 
    and practice of universal humanitarian values.

       It is not enough to make noisy calls to halt moral 
    degeneration; we must do something about it. Since present-day 
    governments do not shoulder such 'religious' responsibilities, 
    humanitarian and religious leaders must strengthen the existing 
    civic, social, cultural, educational, and religious 
    organizations to revive human and spiritual values. Where 
    necessary, we must create new organizations to achieve these 
    goals. Only in so doing can we hope to create a more stable 
    basis for world peace.

       Living in society, we should share the sufferings of our 
    fellow citizens and practice compassion and tolerance not only 
    towards our loved ones but also towards our enemies. This is 
    the test of our moral strength. We must set an example by our 
    own practice, for we cannot hope to convince others of the 
    value of religion by mere words. We must live up to the same 
    high standards of integrity and sacrifice that we ask of 
    others. The ultimate purpose of all religions is to serve and 
    benefit humanity. This is why it is so important that religion 
    always be used to effect the happiness and peace of all beings 
    and not merely to convert others.

       Still, in religion there are no national boundaries. A 
    religion can and should be used by any people or person who 
    finds it beneficial. What is important for each seeker is to 
    choose a religion that is most suitable to himself or herself. 
    But, the embracing of a particular religion does not mean the 
    rejection of another religion or one's own community. In fact, 
    it is important that those who embrace a religion should not 
    cut themselves off from their own society; they should continue 
    to live within their own community and in harmony with its 
    members. By escaping from your own community, you cannot 
    benefit others, whereas benefiting others is actually the basic 
    aim of religion.

       In this regard there are two things important to keep in 
    mind: self-examination and self-correction. We should 
    constantly check our attitude toward others, examining 
    ourselves carefully, and we should correct ourselves 
    immediately when we find we are in the wrong.


    Finally, a few words about material progress. I have heard a 
    great deal of complaint against material progress from 
    Westerners, and yet, paradoxically, it has been the very pride 
    of the Western world. I see nothing wrong with material 
    progress per se, provided people are always given precedence. 
    It is my firm belief that in order to solve human problems in 
    all their dimensions, we must combine and harmonize economic 
    development with spiritual growth. However, we must know its 
    limitations. Although materialistic knowledge in the form of 
    science and technology has contributed enormously to human 
    welfare, it is not capable of creating lasting happiness. In 
    America, for example, where technological development is 
    perhaps more advanced than in any other country, there is still 
    a great deal of mental suffering. This is because 
    materialistic knowledge can only provide a type of happiness 
    that is dependent upon physical conditions. It cannot provide 
    happiness that springs from inner development independent of 
    external factors.
       
       For renewal of human values and attainment of lasting 
    happiness, we need to look to the common humanitarian heritage 
    of all nations the world over. May this essay serve as an 
    urgent reminder lest we forget the human values that unite us 
    all as a single family on this planet.

        I have written the above lines
        To tell my constant feeling.
        Whenever I meet even a 'foreigner,'
        I have always the same feeling:
        'I am meeting another member of the human family.'
        This attitude has deepened
        My affection and respect for all beings.
        May this natural wish be
        My small contribution to world peace.
        I pray for a more friendly,
        More caring, and more understanding
        Human family on this planet.
        To all who dislike suffering,
        Who cherish lasting happiness--
        This is my heartfelt appeal.

    Tibet House
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    Tibet House has been founded as a non-sectarian, educational 
    and cultural, not-for-profit institution, under the guidance of 
    His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader 
    of the Tibetan people.
       Its purpose is:
        
        * To preserve as a living tradition Tibet's cultural and 
          religious heritage,
        * To present, as vital knowledge, Tibet's ancient traditions 
          of philosophy, art and science, and
        * To share with the world community Tibet's unique 
          contributions to universal spiritual understanding and human 
          development.
       
       Tibet House is currently seeking a permanent residence in 
    New York City. Through educational programs and lectures, 
    exhibitions, research facilities, publishing enterprises, 
    broadcast programming, concerts and special spiritual and 
    secular events, Tibet House will stir the heart of the visitor 
    who will encounter there the mystery, power and beauty of Tibet.


    Programs
    ~~~~~~~~
    We have begun to realize Tibet House with the following 
    programs:
       
       Tibet House has co-sponsored the North American tours of 
    several Tibetan performing arts group: the Gyuto Tantric 
    University Multiphonic Choir from October 1988 through February 
    1989; the Loseling Monastic University's Great Prayer Festival 
    program, "Sacred Music, Sacred Dance," in February 1989; and 
    the Namgyal Monastery's Kalachakra Dancers from July through 
    October, of 1989.
       
       Tibet House is working with the American Institute of 
    Buddhist Studies and the New York Open Center to present a 
    series of seminars on Tibetan history, culture and religion at 
    the Open Center. The first, in the Fall of 1987, and the 
    second, in the Fall of 1988, were both well attended. Major 
    conferences on all aspects of Tibet will follow during The Year 
    of Tibet.
       
       In 1991 Tibet House will sponsor a series of nationwide 
    cultural events to be called //The Year of Tibet//. At the heart of 
    this event is //Wisdom and Compassion// -- the most extensive 
    exhibition of Tibetan art yet seen. Organized in cooperation 
    with the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the show will 
    include rare and extraordinary examples of Tibetan art and 
    sculpture from museums and private collections around the 
    world, as well as from the personal collection of His Holiness 
    the Dalai Lama. Many of these works of art are to be displayed 
    publicly for the first time. After its initial opening, //Wisdom 
    and Compassion// is scheduled to travel to major art museums in 
    Washington, New York and Chicago. Concurrently, plans are being 
    made to present a show of Traditional Tibetan Folk Art to be 
    seen in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. 
    Catalogues and related publications focusing on Tibetan art and 
    history are being developed with Harry M. Abrams, Inc. The Year 
    of Tibet will also mark the premiere of a newly commissioned 
    opera by Philip Glass at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, based 
    on the life of the great Tibetan saint Milarepa. A world tour 
    will follow.
       
       Additionally, audiences across the country will have the 
    opportunity to see authentic Tibetan Opera, as performed by the 
    Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts from Dharamsala, India, 
    the capital of Tibet's government in exile. Complementing these 
    activities, a series of newly produced narratives and 
    documentary films, focusing on Tibet's culture and history, 
    will be shown on national TV stations. //The Year of Tibet// will 
    initiate the first annual Tibetan film festival.
