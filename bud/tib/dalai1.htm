THAILAND - DALAI LAMA URGES RELEASE OF BURMA'S SUU KYI (FEB. 18) PAC 
RIM INTELLIGENCE REPORT - The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai 
Lama, yesterday expressed hope that the efforts of the Nobel Peace 
laureates will help to frec Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu 
Kyi who has been under house arrest in Rangoon since 1989. 

The Dalai Lama arrived here from New Delhi yesterday afternoon for a 
24-hour visit, also urged the world community to take every effort 
to secure the release of Suu Kyi. 

"I am quite sure, in this way, we can make some contribution. 
Obviously it can raise some deeper awareness in the public mind," he 
told media representatives at Wat Bowon Nivet where he was to spend 
the night. "Eventually, I think we may achieve our goalthe release 
of Aung San Suu Kyi. It may take time," he said during the 30-minute 
interview. 

Asked whether the campaign in Thailand by the Nobel laureates to 
help Suu Kyi would constitute interference in Burma's internal 
affairs, he said with a smile: "Humanity knows no national boundary.
" 

The Dalai Lama, whose visit here is opposed by some military leaders 
and opposition politicians, said countries help each other in times 
of suffering, such as floods, earthquakes, and famine as in Somalia. 

"Nobody says it is interference," he said. "So, similar is basic 
human rights. It is one kind of suffering which humanity must take 
care (of)." 

The 60-year-old Dalai Lama, who has for the past 40 years been a 
symbol of peaceful struggle by Tibetans against Chinese rule, was 
met by the Supreme Patriarch upon his arrival at the temple amidst 
extremely tight security. An army of policemen blocked off dozens of 
well-wishers who tried to offer him flowers. 

Describing the Supreme Patriarch as "my spiritual brother", the 
Dalai Lama said he was happy to be back in Thailand which he visited 
twice in 1969 and 1972 before diplomatic relations between Thailand 
and China were normalised. He was refused an entry visa in 1987 and 
1990 by the Thai government which was afraid of offending Beijing. 

Just hours before his scheduled arrival, there was confusion as to 
where he would stay following reports that the milhary had objected 
to War Bowon Nivet giving him accommodation. 

The Thai organizers of his visit wanted War Charaprathan Rangsarit 
in Nonthaburi as an alternative. But two hours before his arrival it 
was decided that he would stay at War Bowon Nivet. 

"The Dalai Lama asked to stay at War Bowon Nivet Wihan." Dr Pradit 
Charoenthaithawi, rector of Mahidon University, told reporters. 

Besides the Dalai Lama. six other Nobel Peace laureates have also 
arrived in Bangkok to begin a campaign for human fights in 
neighbouring Burma. 

"In the long-run, showing concern by all humanity would benefit 
Burma," the Dalai Lama said of the on-going campaigns by the 
international community on behalf of the Burmese people. 

"The world is getting smaller. And everything depends on everything 
else. Others' interests are actually our own interest also. If 
others are happy, we will be happy. If others suffer, we ultimately 
will suffer." 

The spiritual leader. who lives in exile in India, said in 1991, 
during a meeting in Norway with other Nobel Peace laureates, he 
signed a joint appeal for Suu Kyi's release. Last year, he also made 
a separate appeal when the Burmese government began to release some 
political prisoners. 

The Dalai Lama said he had great admiration for Suu K.vi whom he 
described as a "real freedom fighter who received blood cells from 
her father", Aung San, the father of Burmese independence. 

Dr Pradit, who has been heavily cnticized by the military and the 
opposition for his role in arranging the laureates' visit, asked the 
media representatives to avoid asking the Dalai Lama about China or 
Tibet. 

Ammy Commander in Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit claims the laureates' 
visit will affect Thailand's relations with China and Burma. 

But Pradit reiterated yesterday that the Dalai Lama's visit was 
based purely on his desire to promote Buddhism. 

"We have no intention to bring war into our own home as alleged by 
some people." he said, referring to Gen Wimon's earlier statement. 

He said the Dalai Lama is a very disciplined religious leader and he 
would not get involved in any political matters during his short 
stay in Thailand. 

I came here for peace. The main objective is for the release of Aung 
San Suu Kyi," said the Dalai Lama, clad in his traditional red and 
orange robes, to reporters who mobbed him at the airport. 

He only smiled when some reporters asked him to comment on 
opposition among certain quarters in Thailand to his visit. (passage
