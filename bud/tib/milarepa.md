          ==========>>> ENTERING THE DHARMA GATE <<<==========

                  Though grief in the Ocean of Samsara
               Is preached, and its renunciation is urged,
                     Few people are really convinced
                   And renounce it with determination.
            Though knowing that life will ever turn to death,
               Few feel uneasy, or think that it will end.
            Though their life is blessed with good prospects,
                 Few can practice abstention for a day.
               Though the Bliss of Liberation is expounded
                    And Samsara's pains are stressed,
                  Few can really enter the Dharma Gate.
                  Though the profound Pith-Instructions
          Of the Whispered Lineage are given without stint, few
                     Without fail can practice them.
              Though the teaching of Mahamudra is expounded
            And the Pointing-out demonstration is exercised,
             Few can really understand the Essence of Mind.
                To the hermit's life and the Guru's wish
                     One can always aspire, but few
                       Can put them into practice.
                  The perfect, skillful path of Naropa
                   May be shown, without concealment,
                   But those who can really follow it
                       Are very few.  My dear lad,
                    You should follow in my footsteps
                     If in this life you want to do
                      Something that is worthwhile.
