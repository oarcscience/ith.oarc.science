    HIS HOLINESS DILGO KHYENTSE RINPOCHE
    (1910- 1991)
     
       His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Head of the Nyingma School of
    Tibetan Buddhism,passed away in Bhutan on September 28, 1991.
    Universally revered as the most outstanding master of the Dzogchen
    teachings and foremost upholder of the unbiased (Rime) spirit within
    the Buddhist tradition of Tibet, he was one of the principal lineage
    holders of the Dzogchen Longchen Nyingtik tradition and a highly
    acclaimed "terton", a discoverer of spiritual treasures concealed by
    Padmasambhava.  As such, he became the teacher of many of the
    important Lamas of today, and for several years had been giving
    teachings from the Nyingma and Dzogchen tradition to His Holiness the
    Dalai Lama. He was spiritual adviser to the royal family of Bhutan,
    and has thousands of disciples in India, the Himalayas, Tibet and the
    West.
     
       Born in l910 in Kham Derge, Eastern Tibet, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche
    was recognised as an incarnation whilst still in his mother's womb by
    the great master, Mipham Rinpoche, who foresaw his exceptional
    destiny.  At the age of eleven he entered Shechen Monastery, one of
    the six principal monasteries of the Nyingma tradition, and was
    formally recognised and enthroned by his teacher, Shechen Gyaltsap
    Rinpoche, as the wisdom-mind emanation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
    (1820-92), the extraordinary visionary master who, alongside Jamgon
    Kongtrul and Chogyur Lingpa, spearheaded the spiritual and cultural
    renaissance in Tibet which became known as the Rime movement.
     
       Khyentse Rinpoche spent many years at Shechen with his teacher,
    Shechen Gyaltsap, who imparted to him all the essential instructions
    and empowerments of the Nyingma tradition. Studying with
    over fifty great masters and scholars, including the renowned Khenpo
    Shyenga, and practising for years in remote caves and solitary
    hermitages, his understanding and realisation matured and blossomed.
    From an early age, Khyentse Rinpoche had received visions of Guru
    Rinpoche and he began now to reveal his terma teachings. He became on
    of the closest disciples of Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro (1896-1959),
    the activity emanation of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who granted him a
    vast number of teachings, and prepared him to be his lineage holder in
    a period when he knew the survival of the teaching of Buddha, and
    especially the Dzogchen teachings, would be in jeopardy.
     
       Khyentse Rinpoche devoted his entire life to worhng for the benefit
    of others. He travelled tirelessly throughout India, the Himalayas,
    South East Asia and the West, transmitting the pure essence of the
    teachings to his countless disciples. He composed many commentaries,
    meditation texts and poems, and became famous for his outstanding
    scholarship and wisdom. He played an enormous part in preserving
    Tibet's rich spintual heritage by collffting and publishing many rare
    Buddhist texts which otherwise would have been lost forever in the
    systematic destruction of the monastic universtities and libraries in
    Tibet during the Chinese occupation.
     
       Khyentse Rinpoche established the great living tradition of Shechen
    in Baudhanath, Nepal, constructing a new monastery, Shechen Tennyi
    Dargyeling, which looks out onto the great stupa, and personally
    supervising the education and training of the young Lamas destined to
    continue the tradition there.  The abbot of the monastery is Khyentse
    Rinpoche's grandson and spiritual heir, the VII Rabjam Rinpoche.  In
    India, he built a new stupa at Bodhgaya, the site of Buddha
    Shaykamuni's enlightenment beneath the Bodhi tree, and prepared plans
    for the construction of seven other stupas in each of the great
    pilgrimage places associated with the life of the Buddha, according to
    the prediction of Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro. This project carries
    immense significance for the continuity of the Buddhist teachings in
    the East, the aversion of war and famine, and promotion of world peace
    and harmony.
     
    In this way, Khyentse Rinpoche spent his whole life in complete and
    selfless dedication helping others and continuing the unbroken
    transmission of the teachings.  Not a single minute in his day was
    wasted from the moment he woke, early before dawn, to perform his
    prayers and meditation practice, until late at night in an
    uninterrupted stream of teachings, empowerments, instructions,
    interviews, and supervision of Dharma projects, all of which were
    accomplished with his charactenstic sense of spaciousness, humour and
    ease.
     
       Khyentse Rinpoche was a master who was larger than life, in a
    category entirely of his own. It would be no exaggeration to say that
    within recent times in the Buddhist tradition of Tibet, there was no
    other meditation master or scholar of his calibre.  With more that
    twenty years in retreat, his poetic and inspired writings, his vast
    learning, his tremendous achievements in the fields of building and
    publishing, his inexhaustible energy and the unique and effortless
    manner in which he continuously taught and passed on the transmission,
    he epitomised the image of the greatest Lamas of the past
     
       Over the years, Khyentse Rinpoche has shown tremendous kindness to
    Sogyal Rinpoche and the RIGPA sangha, confernng teachings and
    empowerments on numerous occasions, both in the East and the West. He
    was the principal 'object of refuge' for the whole sangha and inspired
    in them all a natural devotion and a heartfelt conviction that he was
    none other than Padmasambhava himself. It was in August 1990 during
    Rigpa's summer retreat in the French Alps that this long and deep
    connection matured in a glorious way when Khyentse Rinpoche bestowed
    the most profound transmissions from the Dzogchen Longchen Nyintik
    cycle.  Radiant and in excellent health, day after day the blessings
    of his wisdom mind flowed effortlessly in an unbroken stream of
    empowerments, teachings and transmissions which created a foundation
    and sowed the seeds for the complete practice of the Nyingma path and
    Dzogpachenpo . This was to be one of his last major teachings and one
    of the very rare occasions he gave a complete transmission of the
    Dzogchen teachings to a large group. The significance of this
    unprecedented and auspicious meeting is apparent now more than ever,
    and will remain a constant source of inspiration in our hearts and in
    our practice.
     
       The passing away of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche marks the end of an
    era, and is a tremendous loss both for the Nyingma tradition and
    Tibetan Buddhism as a whole.  It is impossible to express in words the
    full measure of our sadness and how greatly we will miss him. He has
    given us now the ultimate teaching on impermanence to urge us to
    spiritual practice. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama said recently,"We
    all, his disciples, should repay his kindness with our practice."
