    Subject:      Prayer for a Swift Return

    Spontaneous Fulfilment of Wishes
    -------- Prayer for a Swift Return -----------

    O Gurus abiding in the ten directions' infinite realms,
    Buddhas, bodhisattvas, shravakas, pratyekabuddhas and dharmapalas -
    Pray oceanic sources of refuge generate the power of compassion
    To grant siddhi of our desired wishes' fulfilment here and now!

    With long familiar excellent wisdom's 1 force flourishing 2.
    And enthusiasm fully firm in accomplishing others' welfare,
    Skilled in bearing Buddha's teachings aloft to the ten directions,
    I pray at the feet of the Venerable Guru.

    Protector, bearing witness for the conquerors and bodhisattvas,
    You are determined always to fulfil the welfare of others;
    Yet your having left me and other faithful disciples
    To enter the peaceful sphere torments us so!

    But since it is never possible that great beings
    At any time waver form achieving others' welfare
    For trainees  of this realm born from your speech -
    May you swiftly show the young excellent face of your rebirth!

    Scholary, moral and kind, with teaching, debate and composition,
    Masterfully spreading the essence of sutra and tantra to the ten directions
    As Buddha's supreme representative for the teachings -
    May the bright smiling young moon of your re-emanation quickly come!

    COLOPHON:  This prayer for the swift return of the great spiritual guide
    of Ganden Jangste Monastery's Gowo College, Geshe Kenrab Tobgye, whose
    supreme form has passed to peace, was requested on behalf of all his dharma
    centres, Gowo College of Ganden Jangste, and Losang Donden of the Tseten
    Norbu household, together with offerings.  Geshe Nyima Gyeltsen composed
    it based on prayers for swift return composed by His Holiness the
    Fourteenth Dalia Lama
