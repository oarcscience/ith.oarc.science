    ABSTRACT/KEYWORDS:
    (Originally this text was a Mac MsWord 3 file using "ANUIndian" font to
    handle diacritical marks).

    Lamdre represents one of the most precious non-canonical literatures of  Sakya
    Tibetan Buddhism.  It  generally covers esoteric teachings of
    Mahnuttara-yoga-tantra  and Hevajra Tantra.  The Lamdre literature is not only
    the greatest historical evidence of the tradition but the greatest gift of its
    masters.   Whil.
    e exact dates of the Indian masters are  not easy to determine,
    the preservation of their teachings in notes, manuscripts and stories has
    provided primary sources for the study of this 1400 year old tradition.
    The Lamdre texts are meditational and practical manuals used by hundreds of
    ecclesiastics and lay practitioners of the Sakya tradition, constituting a
    sacred and secret path  which past great masters have trodden.  Those who are
    fortunate enough to own a set of Lamdre texts would treat them as most valuable
    thing and they are taken wherever they may go.  Thus these texts are known as
    "non-detachable" ['bral spas] for practitioners.  Works on Lamdre contain
    sacred oral history, hagiographies of the lineage masters, instructions on
    esoteric meditation practices of Hevajra Sdhana, numerous commentaries on
    Hevajra Tantra, and related liturgies on rites and rituals of the Tantra.
    Traditionally these texts are only accessible to the faithful and fortunate
    initiates, who are then allowed to  practise the meanings of these texts.

    A brief account of the origin of the selective accumulation of Lamdre works
    written by scholars and Yogins during a period that spanned from the 7th to the
    20th century C. E. will be useful.  Generally the entire Lamdre literature can
    be divided into six main divisions:

    1. Expositons on Hevajra Tantra [gu bad].
    2. Classical Lamdre Manuscripts [lam 'bras glegs bam].
    3. Hagiography of the Lineage Masters [bla ma brgyud pa'i rnam thar].
    4. Treatises on Common Lamdre Teachings [lam 'bras tshogs bad].
    5. Manuals on Uncommon Lamdre Teachings [lam 'bras slob bad].
    6. Liturgy on Initiation Rites, Maala  Rituals and Hevajra Sdhana
    [dba da dkyil chog sgrub thabs skor].

    In addition to the expositions written by Lamdre masters and the like, there are
    numerous Indian expositions gu bad or rnam 'grel on Hevajra  Tantra in the
    Tibetan Buddhist canon.  They are used and consulted within and outside the
    Lamdre tradition.  The classical Lamdr.
    e manuscripts are pre-15th century
    scriptures extracted  both from expositions and oral instructions which are
    compiled and edited, and named after the colour of the wrapping cloth excluding
    "Lamdre Blue Annals" [lam 'bras pod son].  Prior to 13th century,  notes on the
    secret oral teachings were passed down from master to disciple and were
    circulated in manuscript form.  In 13th century when carving and production of
    xylographic blocks began in Tibet, selected works were compiled and edited in
    the collected works of the five founding masters of Sakya [sa skya go ma la].
    Beside Virpa  and other Indian authors, the earliest Lamdre authors were sa
    chen kun dga' si po (1092-1158) and his sons, slob dpon bsod nams rtse mo
    (1142-1182) and rje btsun grags pa rgyal mtshan (1147-1216),whose works were
    published in their collected works [bka' 'bum]. This was then followed by sa
    skya pa i ta kun dga' rgyal mtshan (1182-1251/52) and his nephew 'gro mgon
    chos rgyal 'phags pa blo gros rgyal mtshan (1235-1280), whose works on Lamdre
    are also found in their collected works.  In spite of the inclusion of the
    Lamdre works by the Five Masters in their collected works, the Lamdre literature
    did not become known until the emergence of separate editions of extracted
    Lamdre work(s) wrapped in different coloured clothes.  The hagiographies of
    Lamdre lineage masters cover one third of the entire Lamdre literature.  There
    are many works on Lamdre in the bka' 'bums of Sakya masters which are not
    included in this edition.  The success story of Sakyapa scholarship from the
    13th to the 16th century and the glorification of individual scholars and Yogins
    have led to the compilation and creation of "Collected Works" [bka' 'bum].
    However the nature of the contents of Lamdre works being secret and esoteric did
    not allow its disclosure through compilation and printing.  There was a
    self-imposed restriction on the disclosure of Tantric instructions in almost
    every tradition.  For instance, a.
     ston chos 'bar advised  Sachen not to write
    or even talk to anyone about Lamdre practice for eighteen years, and only after
    the lapse of  time, did Sachen began to teach and write on Lamdre.  Out of his
    eleven commentaries, which were in fact commentaries to the same root text [gu
    rtsa ba rdo rje tshig rka], lam 'bras gags ma, being the last one of all and
    especially because of its conciseness, was compiled together with some notes and
    they sealed and locked in a wooden trunk.  Although it was originally known as
    "sag ubs ma," a name derived from the wooden trunk, its actual name is gags ma
    since it was given to gags i ra ba dba phyug dpal, not to be confused with
    gags si po rgyal mtshan, a disciple of tshogs sgom kun dga' dpal. According
    to Ngorchen, since Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltshan located, selected, compiled and
    wrapped this and other instructions on Lamdre in a yellow  cloth, it became
    known as  "Lamdre Yellow Annals" [lam 'bras pod ser ma].1 As a matter of
    interest we can see here that within one generation, this work had received
    three different names much to the confusion of the historians of Lamdre
    literature.  One can imagine how the discrepancies in identification of the
    eleven commentaries would have arisen.  Another important Lamdre author is dmar
    chos kyi rgyal po,who as a close disciple of Sapan, wrote " gu gad dmar ma "
    on the basis of instructions given by Sapan which later became known as "Lamdre
    Red Annals" [lam 'bras pod dmar]. In his introduction, dmar reiterates that lam
    'bras gags ma was primarily used as a reference by Sapan when giving teachings
    on Lamdre.  Based on these two works, the first systematic and comprehensive
    Lamdre treatise, "Lamdre Black Annals" [lam 'bras pod nag], was written by bla
    ma dam pa bsod nams rgyal msthan (1312-1375), who also sponsored the first
    edition of the collected works of the five masters as a tribute at the funeral
    observance of his deceased teacher dpal ldan se ge.   His treatise was so name.
    d
    because it was wrapped in a dark iron coloured cloth.  Beside these, there were
    number of works on Lamdre written by some disciples of Drogmi and the five
    masters which are not listed in this edition.

    The 16th century saw the emergence of a galaxy of Lamdre scholars and masters.
    In spite of the aforementioned Lamdre works named after the different colours of
    the volumes, other works found in the collected works of numerous masters may
    have been carved earlier but  there is no evidence of Lamdre being printed.  In
    this edition of Sakya Lamdre Literature Series (S. L. L. S.), we will notice
    that the works are divided into lam 'bras slob bad and lam 'bras tshogs bad.
    Prior to 15th century, there was neither any literature which distinguished
    between  the two lineages nor any evidence of their existence.  This system of
    two lineages has been developed from a practice of mus chen dkon mchog rgyal
    mtshan (1388-1469), who gave pithy instructions to bdag chen blo gros rgyal
    mtshan (1444-1479) in private.  It was restricted to small number of selected
    disciples, and was seldom given, as it was designed to guide advanced
    individuals who were making experiential progress [myo khrid] on the basis of
    the teacher's experiential advice [man ag]. The common lineage, however,
    allowed a larger group of students and was given annually in Ngor monastery in
    Tibet, and bore the name tshogs bad.  Dagchen Lodro Gyaltshan, who has also
    written numerous works, is regarded as the first promulgator of both lineages.
    Subsequently his disciples and grand-disciples, who followed the two distinct
    lineages, made a vast liturgical contribution to the development of the
    lineages. An obvious difference between the two is the language and style of
    composition rather than the contents.  Lobshey manuals are straight forward
    instructions written in the warm colloquial language of Upper Tsang, while
    Tshogshey manuals use rather classical and scholastic Tibetan, with numerous
    quotes from Stras  and.
     Tantras.

    or chen dkon mchog lhun grub (1497-1547), a prolific Sakya author, wrote  some
    scholastic treatises on Three Visions and Three Tantras.  His works simplified
    the duties of many later Lamdre masters, who made a habit of reading it in
    teaching sessions, so that  it became the classical Lamdre Tshogshey manual of
    Sakya and Ngor monasteries. Perhaps his works were widely read than any others.
    My first introduction to Lamdre work was his "Beautiful Ornament of Three
    Visions" [sna gsum mdzes rgyan] in 1970.  Later 'jam mgon a mes abs ag dba
    kun dga' bsod nams (1537-1601) and pa chen ag dba chos grags's (1572-1651)
    works were and are still used as alternative or supplementary to the former
    manuals in Tshogshey tradition.

    The uncommon Lamdre lineage was transmitted through rdo ri pa kun spas pa chen
    po (1449-1524) to sgo rum kun dga' legs pa and from both of them to Tsharchen.
    It remained solely as oral teachings until 'jam dbyas mkhyen brtse dba phyug
    (1524-1568) and ma thos klu sgrub rgya mtsho (1523-1594) who became the sun and
    moon-like disciples of tshar chen blo gsal rgya mtsho (1502-1567).  These two
    eminent masters took notes on the basis of instruction heard from Tsharchen, and
    wrote two complete sets of Lamdre Lobshey manuals,  which were later endorsed by
    Tsharchen.   Most of these works remained as manuscripts [gzigs dpe].  In 1904
    'jam mgon blo gter dba po (1847-1914)  courageously arranged and sponsored the
    task of preparing xylographic blocks of seventeen volume Lamdre Lobshey
    (including all the biographies) in spite of criticism from others who feared
    that the printing and disclosure of the secret teachings might displease the
    Dharma protectors.   Ignoring their opposition, he wrote a synthesis of the two
    Lamdre Lobshey manuals and dispelled the doubts of contradiction between the two
    works raised by other scholars.  Without his tireless effort and noble example
    of sponsoring, editing and publishing many important Sakya works e.g. s.
    grub
    thabs kun btus including lam 'bras slob bad, this edition of the  complete
    collection of Lamdre (31 Volumes) could not have  materialized.  Prior to this
    they were not published together since the uncommon texts were indirectly
    censored from printing.

    This catalogue is based on the collection of legitimate works on Lamdre
    tradition written by many lineage Gurus of both traditions from Virpa  to His
    Eminence Chogay Trichen Rinpoche. They are a gradual accumulation of works
    compiled, edited and re-edited by numerous masters.  Naturally there are Lamdre
    bibliographies and lists of received teachings [gsan yig] of early prominent
    masters which do not  contain the latter works.  Notwithstanding this, we do not
    see any theory to guide us how to distinguish between  the authors or works of
    the two traditions.  The classification neither follow chronological order nor
    are there technical reasons to indicate how the works were distinguished. If the
    concept of slob bad tradition came into being after Dagchen Lodro Gyaltshan,
    then all works prior to him should be tshogs bad and post Dagchen Lodro
    Gyaltshan works should be slob bad.  But this does not appear to be the case.
    For instance, while most works of Drakpa Gyaltshan are listed in the slob bad,
    some of his works are listed in tshogs bad.  Similarly the lam 'bras gags ma
    and other ten commentaries which served the basis of all works listed in this
    catalogue were and are not used for either of the Lamdre teaching situation.
    Separate teaching and oral transmission sessions [lu rgyun] on these
    commentaries were held outside of Lamdre sessions if the commentarial lineages
    and transmissions were extant.  It is essential to include the eleven
    commentaries in the collection of Lamdre works since they were the first
    expositions on the subject.  Eminent Lamdre scholars such as Ngawang Choedak's
    works should not necessarily fall in the tshogs bad division as he has been a
    recipient and promulgator of both traditions.
    .  The free usage of his works
    practised in both traditions is evidence of the impartiality of his works.  He
    has been a great exponent of both traditions.

    The emergence of this thirty one volume Sakya Lamdre Literature Series is a
    welcome and new phenomenon in the history of Lamdre texts.  We may hope that
    this edition can be enlarged and developed in the near future.  It amalgamates
    tshogs bad, slob bad,  the eleven commentaries by Sachen, as well as many
    other works related to Lamdre.  It was edited by His Holiness Sakya Trizin for
    its publication undertaken by Sakya Centre, Dehra Dun in 1983.  His Holiness
    explains the model of his edition in the postcript of its bibiography.  It is
    published in the traditional folio style [dpe gzugs] or loose leafs which
    required several years of painstaking calligraphy work by many dedicated monks
    of Sakya Centre.  Thanks are due to all the monks, including Venerable Migmar
    Tseten, for their dedication in making such a publication possible. For the sake
    of convenience in locating the references, I have amended the title numbers
    which are numbered  in sequence.  The folio numbers are given without specifying
    side a or side b since odd and even numbers indicate them.  Translation of the
    essential part of the Tibetan titles are provided together with their
    transliterations.  Volumes are marked alphabetically; hence the first volume is
    marked 'pod ka pa' Volume One.  Future editors of Lamdre texts need to consider
    collecting more works on Lamdre from a wider sources e.g. bka' 'bums, which are
    not included in this edition, and to develop a systematic theory of
    classification  arrangements between the two traditions and different works.
