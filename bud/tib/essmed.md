                     ESSENTIAL ADVICE ON MEDITATION
                     excerpts from Teachings by Sogyal Rinpoche

    When you read books about meditation, or often when meditation is 
    is  presented by different groups, much of the emphasis falls  on 
    the techniques. In the West, people tend to be very interested in 
    the  "technology"  of  meditation.  However,  by  far  the   most 
    important feature of meditation is not technique, but the way  of 
    being,  the  spirit, which is callled the  "posture",  a  posture 
    which  is  not so much physical, but more to do  with  spirit  or 
    attitude.

    It  is  well  to recognize that when you start  on  a  meditation 
    practice,  you  are  entering a totally  different  dimension  of 
    reality.  Normally  in life we put a great deal  of  effort  into 
    achieving  things,  and  there is a  lot  of  struggle  involved, 
    whereas  meditation is just the opposite, it is a break from  how 
    we normally operate.

    Meditation  is  simply a question of being, of  melting,  like  a 
    piece  of  butter  left in the sun. It has  nothing  to  do  with 
    whether  or not you "know" anything about it, in fact, each  time 
    you  practice  meditation  it  should be fresh,  as  if  it  were 
    happening  for  the very first time. You just quietly  sit,  your 
    body  still,  your speech silent, your mind at  ease,  and  allow 
    thoughts to come and go, without letting them play havoc on  you. 
    If you need something to do, then watch the breathing. This is  a 
    very  simple process. When you are breathing out, know  that  you 
    are  breathing  out.  When  you breath  in,  know  that  you  are 
    breathing  in, without supplying any kind of extra commentary  or 
    internalized mental gossip, but just identifying with the breath. 
    That  very simple process of mindfulness processes your  thoughts 
    and emotions, and then, like an old skin being shed, something is 
    peeled off and freed.

    Usually  people  tend  to  relax the  body  by  concentrating  on 
    different  parts.  Real  relaxation comes  when  you  relax  from 
    within,  for  then  everything else will ease  itself  out  quite 
    naturally.

    When  you begin to practice, you center yourself, in  touch  with 
    your  "soft spot", and just remain there. You need not  focus  on 
    anything in particular to begin with. Just be spacious, and allow 
    thoughts  and emotions to settle. If you do so, then later,  when 
    you use a method such as watching the breath, your attention will 
    more easily be on your breathing. There is no particular point on 
    the  breath on which you need to focus, it is simply the  process 
    of  breathing.  Twenty-five percent of your attention is  on  the 
    breath,  and  seventy-five percent is relaxed.  Try  to  actually 
    identify  with the breathing, rather than just watching  it.  You 
    may choose an object, like a flower, for example, to focus  upon. 
    Sometimes you are taught to visualize a light on the forehead, or 
    in  the heart. Sometimes a sound or a mantra can be used. But  at 
    the  beginning  it is best to simply be spacious, like  the  sky. 
    Think of yourself as the sky, holding the whole universe.

    When  you  sit, let things settle and allow all  your  discordant 
    self  with  its ungenuineness and unnaturalness to  disolve,  out 
    of  that  rises  your real being. You  experience  an  aspect  of 
    yourself which is more genuine and more authentic-the "real" you. 
    As  you  go deeper, you begin to discover and connect  with  your 
    fundamental goodness.

    The  whole point of meditation is to get used to the that  aspect 
    which you have forgotten. In Tibetan "meditation" means  "getting 
    used to". Getting used to what? to your true nature, your  Buddha 
    nature.  This  is  why,  in the  highest  teaching  of  Buddhism, 
    Dzogchen, you are told to "rest in the nature of mind". You  just 
    quietly  sit  and let all thoughts and concepts dissolve.  It  is 
    like  when the clouds dissolve or the mist evaporates, to  reveal 
    the clear sky and the sun shining down. When everything dissolves 
    like  this, you begin to experience your true nature, to  "live". 
    Then you know it, and at that moment, you feel really good. It is 
    unlike  any  other  feeling of well being  that  you  might  have 
    experienced.  This is a real and genuine goodness, in  which  you 
    feel  a  deep sense of peace, contentment  and  confidence  about 
    yourself. 

    It is good to meditate when you feel inspired. Early mornings can 
    bring that inspiration, as the best moments of the mind are early 
    in  the  day,  when  the mind is calmer  and  fresher  (the  time 
    traditionaly recommended is before dawn). It is more  appropriate 
    to  sit when you are inspired, for not only is it easier then  as 
    you  are in a better frame of mind for meditation, but  you  will 
    also be more encouraged by the very practice that you do. This in 
    turn will bring more confidence in the practice, and later on you 
    will  be able to practice when you are not inspired. There is  no 
    need  to meditate for a long time: just remain quietly until  you 
    are  a little open and able to connect with your  heart  essence. 
    That is the main point. 

    After that, some integration, or meditation in action. Once  your 
    mindfulness  has been awakened by your meditation, your  mind  is 
    calm  and your perception a little more coherent. Then,  whatever 
    you  do,  you  are present, right there. As  in  the  famous  Zen 
    master's  saying:  "When I eat, I eat; when I  sleep,  I  sleep". 
    Whatever  you do, you are fully present in the act. Even  washing 
    dishes,  if  it is done one-pointedly, can  be  very  energizing, 
    freeing, cleansing. You are more peaceful, so you are more "you". 
    You assume the "Universal You".

    One  of  the fundamental points of the spiritual  journey  is  to 
    persevere along the path. Though one's meditation may be good one 
    day  and  and  not so good the next,  like  changes  in  scenery, 
    essentially it is not the experiences, good or bad which count so 
    much, but rather that when you persevere, the real practice  rubs 
    off on you and comes through both good and bad. Good and bad  are 
    simply apparations, just as there may be good or bad weather, yet 
    the sky is always unchanging. If you persevere and have that  sky 
    like  attitude  of  spaciousness,  without  being  perturbed   by 
    emotions and experiences, you will develop stability and the real 
    profoundness  of meditation will take effect. You will find  that 
    gradually  and almost unnoticed, your attitude begins to  change. 
    You  do not hold on to things as solidly as before, or  grasp  at 
    them  so strongly, and though crisis will still happen,  you  can 
    handle them a bit better with more humor and ease. You will  even 
    be  able to laugh at difficulties a little, since there  is  more 
    space between you and them, and you are freer of yourself. Things 
    become  less  solid,  slightly ridiculous, and  you  become  more 
    light-hearted.
