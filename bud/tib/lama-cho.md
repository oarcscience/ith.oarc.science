    UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A BUDDHIST SHRINE

    It is our human nature to keep precious things in a safe place when we have
    them. We can tell ourselves what are the most important objects we own by
    examining where and how we keep them.  For a practising Buddhist, an image or a
    drawing of the Buddha and other Buddhist symbols are important objects which
    enhance his faith and remembrance of the teachings.  The time and effort
    required to keep the shrine clean and replenished with flowers and other
    offerings is considered a skilful activity to focus one's mind in the spiritual
    practices. It will be more than interesting if we can realize the reason why we
    arrange and keep our things around the house reflect our state of minds.   It
    appears that things can and have meanings as much as our minds can project upon
    them.  We are not going to tell our children that  their toys are not real and
    have no significance. Your 15 year old Holden may seem unreal when you see your
    friend's  new sports car. When you walk into a Buddhist shrine, you can tell
    that your heart-felt devotion or lack of it, is expressed through your body
    language.  Just as all objects have some kind of power or influence to our
    minds, the serene Buddha image and nicely arranged flowers and aromatic incense
    cause our minds to reflect within ourselves in the deep meditative
    concentration.  The positive impact of seeing a Buddha image on our minds cannot
    be underestimated.  The Buddha images are purposely consecrated and blessed to
    radiate the spiritual power and  blessings so that whoever happen to see them
    experiences the positive feeling through the medium of the statue.  As long as
    our minds are dependent upon sensory objects, it is important to have
    appropriate objects conducive to our minds.  A Buddhist would find it inspiring
    and motivating to see a Buddha image, which helps him to remember the qualities
    of a Buddha and his teachings.  He or she  shows  devotion by bowing down, offer
    flowers and light a candle or two before taking a seat to meditate.  Bowing down
    purifies pride and cultivates humility.  One cannot meditate properly if one
    cannot let go off such negativities.  The shrine enables us to remind ourselves
    to surrender all the negativities in order to feel peace, serenity, tranquility,
    freedom and light.  Keeping the shrine clean represents the sanctification of
    our spiritual self and acknowledges the purity of an enlightened being.  In
    Tibetan Buddhist shrines, many water bowls are arranged on the altar to
    cultivate its manyfold qualities, fluidity, continuity, universality and purity
    in our practice and faith.  Flowers, candles, fruits and incense are brought as
    offerings to the Buddha  and they give us an opportunity to practise generosity
    and test our understanding of the Law of Karma.  When you come to attend a
    session, rearrange the offerings on the altar, clean the water bowls and fill
    them with fresh water [start from left to right], remove  withered flowers and
    old fruits and light a candle before you take a seat. You will be surprized with
    the difference it makes to your meditation.  While you are doing these, you can
    pray your wishful thoughts in the following manner: Water: May I and others
    cultivate pure and continuous faith in our spiritual practices!  Flower: May my
    heart blossom with the gift of love and compassion so that I can share it to
    others and grace them with happiness! Incense: May all the negative vibrations
    accumulated due to my selfishness, ignorance, greed and hatred be purified by
    the aroma of  the practice of morality! Light: May the light of understanding,
    faith, awareness and wisdom illuminate the darkness of confusion, mistrust and
    all defilements! Perfume: May the aroma of unshakable faith and confidence have
    the ability to please anybody who come in contact with me! Fruit: May I be able
    to satisfy the needs of sentient beings by sustaining the mind with the abundant
    food of meditation and wisdom!  Now, you can practice this when you go to the
    centre next time or  visit a temple, or you can perhaps rearrange the Buddha
    image in your house to enrich the spiritual vibration around your house.
