            Contemplation and meditation on death and impermanence are
    regarded as very important in Buddhism for two reasons : (1) it  is
    only by recognising how precious and how short life is that we are most
    likely to make it meaningful and to live it fully and (2)  by
    understanding the death process and familiarizing ourself with it, we
    can remove fear at the time of death and ensure a good  rebirth.
            Because the way in which we live our lives and our state of
    mind at death directly influence our future lives, it is said  that the
    aim or mark of a spiritual practitioner is to have no fear or regrets
    at the time of death.  People who practice to the  best of their
    abilities will die, it is said, in a state of great bliss. The mediocre
    practitioner will die happily. Even the  initial practitioner will have
    neither fear nor dread at the time of death.  So one should aim at
    achieving at least the smallest of  these results.
            There are two common meditations on death in the Tibetan
    tradition.  The first looks at the certainty and imminence of  death
    and what will be of benefit at the time of death, in order to motivate
    us to make the best use of our lives. The second is a  simulation or
    rehearsal of the actual death process, which familiarizes us with death
    and takes away the fear of the unknown, thus  allowing us to die
    skilfully. Traditionally, in Buddhist countries, one is also encouraged
    to go to a cemetery or burial ground to  contemplate on death and
    become familiar with this inevitable event.

            The first of these meditations is known as the nine-round death
    meditation, in which we contemplate the 3 roots, the 9  reasonings, and
    the 3 convictions, as described below:

    A       DEATH IS CERTAIN

            1.      There is no possible way to escape death.  
                    No-one ever has, not even Jesus, Buddha, etc. Of the
    current
                    world population of over 5 billion people, almost none
    will be 
                    alive in 100 years time.

            2.      Life has a definite, inflexible limit and each moment
    brings us
                    closer to the finality of this life.  
                    We are dying from the moment we are born.

            3.      Death comes in a moment and its time is unexpected.
                    All that separates us from the next life is one breath.
        
    Conviction:  To practise the spiritual path and ripen our inner
    potential by
    cultivating positive mental qualities and abandoning disturbing mental
    qualities.        


    B       THE TIME OF DEATH IS UNCERTAIN 

            4.      The duration of our lifespan is uncertain.  
                    The young can die before the old, the healthy before
    the sick, 
                    etc.

            
            5.      There are many causes and circumstances that lead to
    death, but
                    few that favour the sustenance of life.  
                    Even things that sustain life can kill us, for example
    food, motor 
                    vehicles, property.

            6.      The weakness and fragility of one's physical body
    contribute to life's   uncertainty.  
                    The body can be easily destroyed by disease or
    accident, for 
                    example cancer, AIDS, vehicle accidents, other
    disasters.                                                     

    Conviction:  To ripen our inner potential now, without delay.


    C       THE ONLY THING THAT CAN HELP US AT THE TIME OF DEATH IS
            OUR MENTAL/SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT (because all that goes on to
            the next life is our mind with its karmic (positive or
    negative) imprints.)

            7.      Worldly possessions such as wealth, position, money
    can't help.

            8.      Relatives and friends can neither prevent death nor go
    with us.

            9.      Even our own precious body is of no help to us.  
                    We have to leave it behind like a shell, an empty husk,
    an 
                    overcoat.

    Conviction:  To ripen our inner potential purely, without staining our 
    efforts with attachment to worldly concerns.


            The second meditation simulates or rehearses the actual death
    process. Knowledge of this process is particularly important  because
    advanced practitioners can engage in a series of yogas that are
    modelled on death, intermediate state (Tibetan: bar-do) and  rebirth
    until they gain such control over them that they are no longer subject
    to ordinary uncontrolled death and rebirth.

            It is therefore essential for the practitioner to know the
    stages of death and the mind-body relationship behind them. The 
    description of this is based on a presentation of the winds, or
    currents of energy, that serve as foundations for various levels of 
    consciousness, and the channels in which they flow. Upon the serial
    collapse of the ability of these winds to serve as bases of 
    consciousness, the internal and external events of death unfold. 
    Through the power of meditation, the yogi makes the coarse winds 
    dissolve into the very subtle life-bearing wind at the heart. This yoga
    mirrors the process that occurs at death and involves  concentration on
    the psychic channels and the channel-centres (chakras) inside the body.

            At the channel-centres there are white and red drops, upon
    which physical and mental health are based. The white is  predominant
    at the top of the head and the red at the solar plexus. These drops
    have their origin in a white and red drop at the  heart centre, and
    this drop is the size of a small pea and has a white top and red
    bottom. It is called the indestructible drop,  since it lasts until
    death. The very subtle life-bearing wind dwells inside it and, at
    death, all winds ultimately dissolve into it,  whereupon the clear
    light vision of death dawns.

            The physiology of death revolves around changes in the winds,
    channels and drops. Psychologically, due to the fact that 
    consciousnesses of varying grossness and subtlety depend on the winds,
    like a rider on a horse, their dissolving or loss of ability  to serve
    as bases of consciousness induces radical changes in conscious
    experience.

            Death begins with the sequential dissolution of the winds
    associated with the four elements (earth, water, fire and air). 
    "Earth" refers to the hard factors of the body such as bone, and the
    dissolution of the wind associated with it means that that wind  is no
    longer capable of serving as a mount or basis for consciousness. As a
    consequence of its dissolution, the capacity of the wind  associated
    with "water" (the fluid factors of the body) to act as a mount for
    consciousness becomes more manifest. The ceasing of  this capacity in
    one element and its greater manifestation in another is called
    "dissolution" - it is not, therefore, a case of  gross earth dissolving
    into water.

            Simultaneously with the dissolution of the earth element, four
    other factors dissolve (see Chart 1), accompanied by  external signs
    (generally visible to others) and an internal sign (the inner
    experience of the dying person). The same is repeated  in serial order
    for the other three elements (see Charts 2-4), with corresponding
    external and internal signs.

                                            the heart                    
    light of death

    (The above charts are taken from "Death, Intermediate State and Rebirth
    in Tibetan Buddhism" by Lati Rinbochay and Jeffrey Hopkins)

            Upon the inception of the fifth cycle the mind begins to
    dissolve, in the sense that coarser types cease and subtler minds 
    become manifest. First, conceptuality ceases, dissolving into a mind of
    white appearance. This subtler mind, to which only a vacuity  filled by
    white light appears, is free from coarse conceptuality. It, in turn,
    dissolves into a heightened mind of red appearance,  which then
    dissolves into a mind of black appearance. At this point all that
    appears is a vacuity filled by blackness, during which  the person
    eventually becomes unconscious. In time this is cleared away, leaving a
    totally clear emptiness (the mind of clear light)  free from the white,
    red and black appearances (see Chart 5). This is the final vision of
    death.

            This description of the various internal visions correlates
    closely with the literature on the near-death experience.  People who
    have had a near-death experience often describe moving from darkness
    (for example a black tunnel) towards a brilliant,  peaceful, loving
    light. A comprehensive study comparing death and near-death experiences
    of Tibetans and Euro-Americans has shown  many similarities between the
    two (Carr, 1993). Care must be taken though in such comparisons because
    the near-death experience is  not actual death, that is, the
    consciousness permanently leaving the body.  

            Since the outer breath ceased some time before (in the fourth
    cycle), from this point of view the point of actual death is  related
    not to the cessation of the outer breath but to the appearance of the
    mind of clear light. A person can remain in this state  of lucid
    vacuity for up to three days, after which (if the body has not been
    ravaged by illness) the external sign of drops of red  or white liquid
    emerging from the nose and sexual organ occur, indicating the departure
    of consciousness. 

            Other signs of the consciousness leaving the body are 1) when
    all heat has left the area of the heart centre (in the  centre of the
    chest), 2) the body starts to smell or decompose, 3) a subtle awareness
    that the consciousness has left and the body  has become like 'an empty
    shell', 4) a slumping of the body in a practitioner who has been
    sitting in meditation after the stopping  of the breath. Buddhists
    generally prefer that the body not be removed for disposal before one
    or more of these signs occur, because  until then the consciousness is
    still in the body and any violent handling of it may disturb the end
    processes of death. A Buddhist  monk or nun or friend should ideally be
    called in before the body is moved in order for the appropriate prayers
    and procedures to be  carried out.

            When the clear light vision ceases, the consciousness leaves
    the body and passes through the other seven stages of  dissolution
    (black near-attainment, red increase etc.) in reverse order. As soon as
    this reverse process begins the person is reborn  into an intermediate
    state between lives, with a subtle body that can go instantly wherever
    it likes, move through solid objects  etc., in its journey to the next
    place of rebirth.

            The intermediate state can last from a moment to seven days,
    depending on whether or not a suitable birthplace is found.  If one is
    not found the being undergoes a "small death", experiencing the eight
    signs of death as previously described (but very  briefly). He/she then
    again experiences the eight signs of the reverse process and is reborn
    in a second intermediate state. This  can happen for a total of seven
    births in the intermediate state (making a total of forty-nine days)
    during which a place of rebirth  must be found.

            The "small death" that occurs between intermediate states or
    just prior to taking rebirth is compared to experiencing the  eight
    signs (from the mirage-like vision to the clear light) when going into
    deep sleep or when coming out of a dream. Similarly  also, when
    entering a dream or when awakening from sleep the eight signs of the
    reverse process are experienced.

            These states of increasing subtlety during death and of
    increasing grossness during rebirth are also experienced in  fainting
    and orgasm as well as before and after sleeping and dreaming, although
    not in complete form. It is this great subtlety and  clarity of the
    mind during the death process that makes it so valuable to use for
    advanced meditation practices, and why such  emphasis is put on it in
    Buddhism. Advanced practitioners will often stay in the clear light
    meditation for several days after the  breathing has stopped, engaging
    in these advanced meditations, and can achieve liberation at this time.

            The Buddhist view is that each living being has a continuity or
    stream of consciousness that moves from one life to the  next. Each
    being has had countless previous lives and will continue to be reborn
    again and again without control unless he/she  develops his/her mind to
    the point where, like the yogis mentioned above, he/she gains control
    over this process. When the stream of  consciousness or mind moves from
    one life to the next it brings with it the karmic imprints or
    potentialities from  previous lives.  Karma literally means "action",
    and all of the actions of body, speech and mind leave an imprint on the
    mind-stream. These karmas  can be negative, positive or neutral,
    depending on the action. They can ripen at any time in the future,
    whenever conditions are  suitable. These karmic seeds or imprints are
    never lost.

            At the time of death (clear light stage) the consciousness
    (very subtle mind) leaves the body and the person takes the  body of an
    intermediate state being. They are in the form that they will take in
    their next life (some texts say the previous life),  but in a subtle
    rather than a gross form. As mentioned previously, it can take up to
    forty-nine days to find a suitable place of  rebirth. This rebirth is
    propelled by karma and is uncontrolled. In effect the karma of the
    intermediate state being matches that of  its future parents. The
    intermediate state being has the illusory appearance of its future
    parents copulating. It is drawn to this  place by the force of
    attraction to its parent of the opposite sex, and it is this desire
    that causes the consciousness of the  intermediate state being to enter
    the fertilized ovum. This happens at or near the time of conception and
    the new life has begun.

            One will not necessarily be reborn as a human being. Buddhists
    describe six realms of existence that one can be reborn  into, these
    being the hell realms, the preta (hungry ghost) realm, the animal
    realm, the human realm, the jealous god (asura) realm  and the god
    (sura) realms. One's experience in these situations can range from
    intense suffering in the hell realms to unimaginable  pleasures in the
    god realms. But all of these levels of existence are regarded as
    unsatisfactory by the spiritual practitioner  because no matter how
    high one goes within this cyclic existence, one may one day fall down
    again to the lower realms of existence.  So the aim of the spiritual
    practitioner is to develop his/her mind to the extent where a stop is
    put to this uncontrolled rebirth,  as mentioned previously. The
    practitioner realises that all six levels of existence are ultimately
    in the nature of suffering, so  wishes to be free of them forever.

            The state of mind at the time of death is regarded as extremely
    important, because this plays a vital part in the  situation one is
    reborn into. This is one reason why suicide is regarded in Buddhism as
    very unfortunate, because the state of mind  of the person who commits
    suicide is usually depressed and negative and is likely to throw them
    into a lower rebirth. Also, it  doesn't end the suffering, it just
    postpones it to another life.

            When considering the spiritual care of the dying, it can be
    helpful to divide people into several different categories,  because
    the category they are in will determine the most useful approach to
    use. These categories are: 1) whether the person is  conscious or
    unconscious, and 2) whether they have a religious belief or not. In
    terms of the first category, if the person is  conscious they can do
    the practices themselves or someone can assist them, but if they are
    unconscious someone has to do the  practices for them. For the second
    category, if a person has specific religious beliefs, these can be
    utilised to help them. If they  do not, they still need to be
    encouraged to have positive/virtuous thoughts at the time of death,
    such as reminding them of positive  things they have done during their
    life.

            For a spiritual practitioner, it is helpful to encourage them
    to have thoughts such as love, compassion, remembering their  spiritual
    teacher. It is beneficial also to have an image in the room of Jesus,
    Mary, Buddha, or some other spiritual figure that  may have meaning for
    the dying person. It may be helpful for those who are with the dying
    person to say some prayers, recite mantras  etc. - this could be silent
    or aloud, whatever seems most appropriate.

            However, one needs to be very sensitive to the needs of the
    dying person. The most important thing is to keep the mind of  the
    person happy and calm. Nothing should be done (including certain
    spiritual practices) if this causes the person to be annoyed or 
    irritated. There is a common conception that it is good to read "The
    Tibetan Book of the Dead" to the dying person, but if he/she   is not
    familiar with the particular deities and practices contained in it,
    then this is not likely to prove very beneficial.

            Because the death process is so important, it is best not to
    disturb the dying person with noise or shows of emotion.  Expressing
    attachment and clinging to the dying person can disturb the mind and
    therefore the death process, so it is more helpful  to mentally let the
    person go, to encourage them to move on to the next life without fear.
    It is important not to deny death or to  push it away, just to be with
    the dying person as fully and openly as possible, trying to have an
    open and deep sharing of the  person's fear, pain, joy, love, etc.

            As mentioned previously, when a person is dying, their mind
    becomes much more subtle, and they are more open to receiving  mental
    messages from those people close to them. So silent communication and
    prayer can be very helpful. It is not necessary to talk  much. The
    dying person can be encouraged to let go into the light, into God's
    love etc. (again, this can be verbal or mental).

            It can be very helpful to encourage the dying person to use
    breathing meditation -  to let go of the thoughts and  concentrate on
    the movement of the breath. This can be helpful for developing
    calmness, for pain control, for acceptance, for  removing fear. It can
    help the dying person to get in touch with their inner stillness and
    peace and come to terms with their death.  This breathing technique can
    be especially useful when combined with a mantra, prayer, or
    affirmation (i.e. half on the in-breath,  half on the out-breath).

            One of the Tibetan lamas, Sogyal Rinpoche, says that for up to
    about twenty-one days after a person dies they are more  connected to
    the previous life than to the next one. So for this period in
    particular the loved ones can be encouraged to continue  their (silent)
    communication with the deceased person - to say their good-byes, finish
    any unfinished business, reassure the dead  person, encourage them to
    let go of their old life and to move on to the next one. It can be
    reassuring even just to talk to the  dead person and at some level to
    know that they are probably receiving your message. The mind of the
    deceased person at this stage  can still be subtle and receptive.

            For the more adept practitioners there is also the method of
    transference of consciousness at the time of death (Tibetan:  po-wa).
    With training, at the time of death, the practitioner can project his
    mind upwards from his heart centre through his crown  directly to one
    of the Buddha pure realms, or at least to a higher rebirth. Someone who
    has perfected this training can also assist  others at the time of
    death to project their mind to a good rebirth. 

            It is believed that if the consciousness leaves the body of the
    dead person through the crown or from a higher part of the  body, it is
    likely to result in a good type of rebirth. Conversely, if the
    consciousness leaves from a lower part of the body this  is likely to
    result in rebirth in one of the lower realms. For this reason, when a
    person dies it is believed that the first part of  the body that should
    be touched is the crown. The crown is located about eight finger widths
    (of the person being measured) back  from the (original) hairline. To
    rub or tap this area or gently pull the crown hair after a person dies
    is regarded as very  beneficial and may well help the person to obtain
    a higher rebirth. Their are special blessed pills (po-wa pills) that
    can be placed  on the crown after death which also facilitates this
    process.

            Once the consciousness has left the body (which, as mentioned
    earlier, can take up to three days) it doesn't matter how  the body is
    disposed of or handled (including the carrying out of a post-mortem
    examination) because in effect it has just become an  empty shell.
    However, if the body is disposed of before the consciousness has left,
    this will obviously be very disturbing for the  person who is going
    through the final stages of psychological dissolution. 

            This raises the question of whether or not it is advisable to
    donate one's organs after dying. The usual answer given by  the Tibetan
    lamas to this question is that if the wish to donate one's organs is
    done with the motivation of compassion, then any  disturbance to the
    death process that this causes is far outweighed by the positive karma
    that one is creating by this act of  giving. It is another way in which
    one can die with a positive and compassionate mind.  

            A Tibetan tradition which is becoming more popular in the West
    is to get part of the remains of the deceased (e.g. ashes,  hair,
    nails) blessed and then put into statues, tsa-tsas (Buddha images made
    of clay or plaster) or stupas (reliquary monuments  representing the
    Buddha's body, speech and mind). These stupas for instance could be
    kept in the person's home, larger ones could be  erected in a memorial
    garden.  Making offerings to these or circumambulating them and so on
    is regarded as highly meritorious, both  for the person who has died
    and for the loved ones.

            There are also rituals for caring for the dead, for guiding the
    dead person through the intermediate state into a good  rebirth. Such a
    ritual is "The Tibetan Book of the Dead", more correctly titled
    "Liberation Through Hearing in the Bardo".
