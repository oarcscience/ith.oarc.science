                      "WHAT IS TANTRA?!"
                    RIDING THE WISDOM TIGER


    Introduction:

    From the beginning of time there have been those rare women and men
    who, following their hearts great yearning, have answered the
    existential question of birth and death with realization of who they
    truly are - who we all are. Pranama is such a one. He invites,
    cajoles, dares us to join the dance. Read his words, let them enter
    your heart and smash the taboo against unreasonable happiness. The
    flame of being is passed from master to disciple in the great silence
    of the heart - these words are an engraved invitation.

     "What is Tantra?"
      an interview with Tantric Master Prem Pranama

    This interview occured in the summer of 1994. The interviewer, Ralph
    Abrams, has been a spiritual seeker for the last 25 years. He has
    worked with Swami Muktananda, Nisargadatta Maharaj, Chagdud Tulku,
    Nagkpa Chogyum, Native American teachers and currently lives in the
    Crazy Cloud Hermitage where he studies the Tantric path with Pranama.

    R: The word Tantra is thrown around quite a bit in spiritual circles
    these days, and it often means very different things. I'd like to
    start off with the simple question: What is Tantra?


    P: Tantra is the hot blood of spiritual practice. It smashes the taboo
    against unreasonable happiness; a thunderbolt path, swift, joyful, and
    fierce.  There are many different types of paths. Some touch you like
    a gentle spring rain, but Tantra is the wild summer thunder storm
    churning with creation, destruction, bliss and emptiness.  Tantra is a
    wild mother tiger - if you approach her with right motivation, right
    intention, and integrity, she'll suckle you at her breast; but if you
    come to her in a sloppy way, she'll rip apart your body-mind, eat you
    for dinner, and shit out what's left.

    R: Wow!  I think that this sense of joyful abandon and the force and
    bliss you've described would make the Tantric path attractive to many
    people.  Plus the fact that it is known to be a very swift path to
    enlightenment.

    P.  Swift, yes.  But the Tantric Vajrayana path is complex and can be
    dangerous.  It requires a strong, well integrated sense of self
    prepared through careful preliminary practice. Otherwise it is
    possible for the practitioner to make gross errors in judgment.  On
    the Tantric path, it is perhaps easier to become the ultimate form of
    egohood and delusion than it is to become free. You can start off
    intending to liberate the tyranny of ordinary appearance into
    primordial awareness and end up crystallizing the ego into
    diamond-hard delusion. There is no authentic Tantra without profound
    commitment, discipline, intelligence, courage, and a sense of wild,
    foolhardy, fearless abandon.

    R: Why is that? And why foolhardy abandon?

    P: Foolhardy because the path is for gamblers.  There is a beautiful
    Rumi poem which speaks to this from the Sufi tradition.

     "Love is reckless; not reason.  Reason seeks a profit.  Love comes on
    strong, consuming herself unabashed.

    Yet in the midst of suffering love proceeds like a millstone, hard
    surfaced and straight forward.

    Having died to self interest, she risks everything and asks for
    nothing.  Love gambles away every gift God bestows.

    Without cause God gave us Being; without cause give it back again.
    Gambling yourself away is beyond any religion.

    Religion seeks grace and favor, but those who gamble these away are
    Gods favorites, for they neither put God to the test nor knock at the
                                  door of gain and loss"
            (translation by Edmund Helminski)

       Tantra takes the jump into crazy wisdom by eliminating even God from
    the equation, leaving only the mystery with no ultimate attempt to
    define it. This is a path for those whose hearts are so wild that they
    are ready to throw it all away on a hunch, for an intuition.
      Discipline, courage, hard work and intelligence are required
    because that is what any quest of the heart demands.  Tantra, which
    molds the power of creation and ego into skillful means cutting
    through delusion, requires careful preparation. We don't expect
    someone who just wants to play around now and then on a keyboard to
    become a concert pianist. We don't expect someone to be able to get up
    off the couch one day and run a four minute mile. Great tasks require
    great effort.
       With Tantra we are taking the mind and body as cauldron, feeling,
    ego, elements and world as alchemical ingredients, and imagination
    informed by divine power as catalyst; and we are accomplishing the
    great magical task of alchemical transformation. The base metal of
    dualistic view becomes the infinitely valuable gold of pure and
    luminous awareness. Tantra is a path of tremendous power. This power
    is not easy to use without getting burned by it. Yet, at the same
    time, it is a path of great joy.
       If you're going to use poison, pleasure, and personality as the
    path, you have to be careful not to auto-destruct. In working with an
    advanced sadhana (practice) such as Vajrakilaya, which is central to
    our lineage, powerful energies of psyche, nature, and the subtle
    realms are harnessed. When such a powerful sadhana is introduced into
    one's system through authentic empowerment, it is not something to be
    taken lightly. Let's say you re going to bring anger into the
    path. It's a razor's edge between liberating anger into the wrathful
    compassion of mirror like wisdom and just becoming an arrogant,
    self-righteous prig. With Vajrakilaya, either you are actually
    transforming your mind stream into this wisdom-being of great wrath
    and power, or you are just dressing up your egoistic anger in the
    deitie's clothes. If Tantra is misused, the divine becomes a demon.
       When you work with the Tantric path, you are playing with a live
    wire. It s charged not with electricity, but with the power behind
    creative force. Tantric sadhana deconstructs and constructs reality,
    as play, until the essence of reality becomes obvious.  Through the
    sadhanas, private non-realities interface with the public non-reality
    until you realize the true nature of both. You use illusion to cut
    through illusion.

    R.  I am not sure I understand what you mean by public and private
    non-realities. Are the images, energies, and beings worked with in the
    practices real or not? Could you elaborate on that bit?

    P.  The basis of all this lies in an understanding of Dharmakaya and
    sunyata, "the realm of essence" and "emptiness". The Dharmakaya is not
    a place or even a state of being or consciousness. Dharmakaya is the
    field of pure potential, which is exploding into actualized energy and
    matter at every moment. Each object or thing, even in its "thingness",
    is still in essence characterized by this field of potentiality. In
    other words, each "thing" is empty of permanent characteristics; its
    characteristics share the quality of pure dynamic potentiality and are
    always tending towards the expression of that potential via constant
    change and transformation.
       All worlds and fields of perception explode from this pure
    potentiality, which is also pure awareness or emptiness. This essence,
    this emptiness, is unspeakable and is not any thing at all. And yet it
    is the dynamic matrix from which all of this (waving his arm about the
    room) arises, and of which all of this is a presentation, and into
    which all this returns.
       This explosion of essence creates fields of energetic
    perception. This energy is conditioned into forms by the play of cause
    and effect. These forms are our world and our self. The world, and all
    worlds, are coincident with the essence of awareness, which is
    birthless and deathless and utterly free of the implications of form
    and limit. The manifest world is not other than essence, but essence
    is not limited to the shape or conditions of the manifest worlds. One
    might say that the world and all worlds are held together as form by
    the conditioned and habitual intent of consciousness. Our particular
    world is held together by the intent of human beings. The worlds of
    other beings are held by the force of their conditioned intent.
       The structures of existence are not "real" in any ultimate
    sense. They are public non-realities, playful dreams shaped out of
    essence and molded in form. They are the radiance of pure
    potentiality, momentarily given shape by intent and held in a
    seemingly cohesive pattern by karma or patterned habitualized
    consciousness. A Tantric yogi shatters the tyranny of ordinary
    appearance - the forgetting of how things took on their seemingly real
    forms - by molding new structures of existence - private
    non-realities.
       We are not talking here about "creative visualization" in the sense
    generally used. Imagination is, generally, simply mind forms within
    the public non-reality. We are talking about the actual deconstruction
    of the building blocks of reality and reconstruction of
    alternatives. Both public and private non-realities are conditioned
    forms of consciousness. By enacting the process of creation and
    destruction in the private non-reality the unquestioned authortiy and
    permanence of the public non-reality is undermined. Through the
    process of advanced Tantric sadhana one is able to recognize the
    ground of intrinsic awareness within all conditioned forms. This
    realization allows one to live as intrinsic awareness and recognize
    all arising as ornaments of that awareness.
       The idea of Tantra is not identification with endless new
    conditioned forms of awareness and color.  The point is to slip
    between the cracks into the matrix of pure potentiality itself. The
    goal is not achievement of unusual states it is to recognize your
    primordial intrinsic nature in all appearence. Then all appearance has
    the single taste of bliss and wisdom. That's not the end either it's
    the beginning of endless play.

    R.  That goes quite a bit beyond the general view of Tantra as merely
    a way of advanced self-help rather than a profoundly magical or
    transcendental practice. But isn't it also true that Tantra (in this
    radical form) works with the ordinary emotions and everyday problems?

    P.  There are no ordinary emotions and everyday problems. That's the
    point.  Being is the natural luminous quality of this matrix of pure
    potential and Being presents itself in the play of existence. The
    bliss-mad radiance of pure awareness plays in the colors of Being. The
    world and your own body, your mind and your energies are nothing other
    than the natural communicative thrust of limitlessness.  There is
    absolutely nothing ordinary about anything.
       When the colors of Being are read through the distortions of
    dualistic view, they appear as emotions and confusion, and one is
    bound in the tyranny of ordinary appearance.  Being freed from
    distorted view plays as feeling and clarity in the wild and raucous
    romp of manifestation. When the true nature of every event is
    recognized, even the most seemingly mundane moment will hold such
    great beauty that it will shatter the mind.
       Tantra's power lies in its ability to recognize the poisons of ego
    as distortions of the qualities of enlightenment.  The practices
    transform these distortions or, depending on one's capacity,
    spontaneously liberate dualistic distorted view into its own true
    nature. For Tantra the stuff of body, emotion and mind, ordinary
    emotions and events are the essential ingredients needed for the
    alchemical transformation of distorted view into Buddhahood.

    R.  You mention Being's appearance as a play of colors, and that
    intrigues me. So often Being is described as clear light or white
    light. Non-dual realization seems to be a one dimensional and one
    flavor thing, whereas this seems to have depth.

    P.  Light broken open by a prism displays the colors that are always
    its nature. Its essence is clear light and its nature is to manifest
    as the colors of the rainbow. Pure awareness is completely transparent
    like a sheet of glass. But when broken open, it displays the rainbow
    of colors or flavors that are the substance of manifestation. Pure
    awareness and the colors of Being are not in opposition or even in any
    way two. They are aspects of singleness. So many spiritual paths
    inherently, though often subtly, negate world, body, and
    existence. They are always seeking to get elsewhere into the "light"
    failing to recognize that all is light.
       Spiritual systems often misinterpret bondage as resulting from
    being in form rather than from wrong view. Because of this, they
    wrongly assume that enlightenment means to be abstracted out of form
    into subtle realms or "pure" awareness. These spiritual systems try to
    negate form and dissolve, or return, into the pre-form matrix of pure
    potentiality. This is possible and that radical act of transcending
    form is most blissful - but it is not enlightenment. Form and formless
    are not two; they are a single mystery. These systems are
    spiritualized forms of the dualistic delusion. Tantra, which in its
    true form is Advaitic (or non-dual), transcends this
    limitation. Tantra is wisdom gone wild embracing the totality of what
    is.
       With Tantra you are not getting somewhere; you are just waking up
    to the true nature of things as they are. The colors inherent in clear
    light are not other than the light. The display whereby Being presents
    its limitless mystery is not other than the birthless and deathless
    pure mystery from which Being comes..

    R.  It's interesting that you mention Advaita. I recently read
    Poonjaji, an Advaitic master. He advocates no practice. Form is
    illusion and every action by the illusory self adds to
    unenlightenment. What do you think of that.

    P: Well, I have great respect for the traditional forms of Advaita. I
    have always been intimately connected with Ramana Maharshi, and the
    path that I teach is "Advaitic Tantrayana". On the other hand, there are
    some serious problems and limitations with the talking school of
    Advaita versus the various practice schools such as Tantra.

    R: What do you mean by "talking school"?

    P: Talking schools are those that understand that delusion is only an
    illusion and all that you need to do is understand the illusion to be
    free of it. Because all you need to do is understand, then all I need
    to do as master is explain the truth to you, and all you need to do is
    listen and you will "get it". The problem is that this is a superficial
    grasp of understanding. Understanding in the talking school is
    considered a primarily mental act. I talk; you listen. In truth
    understanding is a whole body act. You must understand with the cells
    of your body, your mind and your feelings. Listening involves a
    profound action of the entire self. This action is what practice
    is. Spiritual practice is the act of listening to the teaching with
    the whole body.
       There are fundamental differences between a teacher, even an
    awakened one, and a master. Poonjaji is a teacher. He speaks about
    Truth very nicely, though he suffers a bit from the delusion of
    viewing form as illusion rather than presentation of the formless. Due
    to this he lacks the skillful means needed to deal with the actual
    roots of delusion. He lacks the skillful means to communicate with the
    whole bodily being rather just the mind. In a recent interview he said
    that he teaches the pure Truth - some get it, some don't, and he doesn t
    know why.  That's the difference between a teacher and a master: A
    master knows why and can deal skillfully with the causes.  A master is
    willing to deal with delusion on its own ground if necessary.  He or
    she is willing to take on the dragon in its cave, even if the dragon
    is only an illusion.
       The teachers of the endless talk no practice school go on to say
    "open your eyes and see the beautiful sunset. You do not need to do
    anything, add anything to yourself. Just open your eyes". While it is
    true that you don't need to add anything, the problem is that your
    eyes are shut and you are wearing a blindfold. You open your eyes and
    see nothing. These teachers do not see you because they are too busy
    admiring their own "non-dualism".
       The teachers of the Advaita talking school do in fact give
    practices. They give the very difficult practice of pre-verbal inquiry
    which works once you have taken off your blindfold. But until then it
    leaves you stranded. All too often people make sense of the words and
    develop conceptual enlightenment. You understand the description of
    the sunset so well that you think you are seeing it, even though you
    are still wearing a blindfold and have your eyes closed. People in
    this condition even go on to become teachers of the talking school,
    endlessly describing the imagined sunset to others. I am sure that it
    is based on my Tantric predilection for wisdom gone wild, my delight
    in manifestation, but I often find these Advaitic teachers a little
    prissy. They are unable to enjoy the game, unable to enjoy the madness
    and wildness of existence. There is no space for non-dual dualism in
    their non-dualism.

    R: That clears up some confusion about Advaita which I hadn't quite
    been able to put into words.  You mentioned Ramana Maharshi. As I
    understand it your path was not originally Tantric.  I would be
    interested in hearing about how you evolved into this style of
    practice and teaching. What led you to awakening and to teaching the
    way that you do?

    P: My introduction and initiation into the world of Tantra began with
    a naked menstruating woman in the University of Michigan's graduate
    school library. She danced and sang and placed her bleeding cunt over
    my mouth and I drank from that source the nectar of immortality, the
    liquid union of bliss and emptiness.  She was the Vajra Dakini Yeshe
    Tso-gyal, Mother of my true life. But that is the end of the story and
    was not planned, asked for, or expected. For most of my spiritual
    journey I had nothing to do with Tantra nor wanted to.
       My own spiritual work began in the Gurdjieff system. Gurdjieff was
    influenced by Tantric teachings though more strongly influenced by the
    Sufi schools. In his system I found a concrete practical method for
    working with the habitual conditioning of my body, mind, and
    emotions. I got to see myself without any veneer.  It was in this
    school that I began to truly crystallize the wish to grow and forge it
    into a center of gravity that could begin to pull the unintegrated
    parts of the self into a unified whole.
       After some time I began to find that certain axioms on which the
    work depended were, for me, limited in their view. Given the lack of
    anyone I considered a true Master, I resumed my search for a system
    that could take me farther. I visited many different teachers and
    communities, read enormous amounts, and engaged in a variety of rather
    extreme experiments on myself. Eventually I encountered the work of
    the enigmatic and rascally Master Osho.  My meeting with Osho, who was
    called Bhagwan at that time, awakened my heart into intense ecstasy
    and devotion. It also began a long period of powerful visionary
    experiences that centered on the Virgin Mary and the Goddess Kali.
       For me devotion was an instant and natural though hard path often
    filled with confusion.  My heart exploded in love. The Guru is the
    trigger. The Guru is the object that the devotee uses as an excuse to
    slip through the boundaries of ordinary feeling. I learned, in a trial
    by fire, that irresponsible devotion to the master always ends in
    serious suffering. In other words the Guru ain t your daddy, the Guru
    is an introduction to your own nature. What is most important is that
    I did learn, and over time the love that Bhagwan awoke in me matured
    into non-dual inquiry.
       One day all the energy that had been pouring outward in love for
    five years simply stopped and began to move inward.  This process was
    fundamentally Ramana Maharshi's question "Who am I"?.  Who is the one
    who experiences all experience?  This process cuts through all
    hierarchy of "higher" or "lower" experience by cutting to the root of
    all experience. Each time I sat down it was like a vortex of energy
    moving into expanding fields of silence.  I would feel this vortex and
    rest in it. It would draw me into deeper and deeper states of silence
    from where I would engage pre-verbal inquiry. What had been ecstasy
    and love before was now recognized as a womb-like place of silence.
       When I started the meditative phase of my practice, all the visions
    stopped short. Previously they were explosions of love, and they kind
    of rode on the outflowing energy of devotion, my interest in them
    fueling their appearance.  Very late in the silent phase of practice,
    several months before my own awakening, a new series of visionary
    experiences began. Visions of Yeshe Tso-gyal, Queen of the Lake of
    Awareness, Mother of Pure Pleasure. These visions exploded from the
    depths of emptiness and silence.
       One morning, after I had finished my practice, I went to the
    library to study Sufi texts.  I was reading two volumes of Rumi's
    works.  As I was walking towards the library, I had a feeling that was
    familiar from previous visionary experiences.  It was an intense
    pleasurable sensation that pushed out from the center of my body, from
    my heart, towards my skin, though this time it seemed to open forth
    from silent space. I felt giddy and drunk. I looked up and for a
    moment I could swear I saw the outline of a dancing woman standing in
    the air above the library.  She was huge!  Maybe three hundred feet
    tall.
       The vision lasted for a second, and I went in and began reading on
    the nearly deserted fourth floor.  The longer I sat, the more intense
    this vibration became.  I knew this process very well, and I knew it
    would lead to a feeling of such intensity, that the ordinary world
    around me would black out. This feeling of ecstatic drunkenness gets
    stronger and stronger as if it's resonating more and more swiftly
    through the entire body.  At a certain point visionary experience
    outshines the "ordinary" world.
       I found myself in a cemetery.  A woman approached.  She was naked,
    except for some bone ornaments. She was singing and dancing a tune of
    haunting melody, which I later discovered was the mantra of her
    consort Padmasambhava: Om Ah Hung Vajra Guru Padma Siddhi Hung!
       I was entranced, simultaneously with ecstatic love and an absolute
    feeling of overwhelming sexual desire so strong that I was sure I
    would die from it. She danced around me and then swiftly stood
    directly in front of me placing her genitals over my face. Her vagina
    was over my mouth, there was blood flowing from it, and I drank this
    blood deeply in an unending flow.  I could feel it coursing through my
    body like liquid heat.  Suddenly the vision disappeared.  I got up and
    went home - well, actually, I think I first went and had a chocolate
    chip cookie. This began a period of what my wife and I refer to as the
    "drooling in the living room" period.  I spent close to a month, mostly
    sitting in a rocking chair in our living room unable to function
    because the force of Bliss that was flowing through my body was so
    overwhelming. I was also unable to speak about what was happening.

    R: You have a very understanding wife.

    P: Yes.  Without her I cannot imagine what would have happened to me
    during this time.  These experiences awoke in my mind and body such
    intense unending bliss and latent neurotic traces of such force that
    it was unbelievable.  Feelings of every kind of distortion, rage,
    anger, lust, grasping, aversion.  I am sad to say that I did a fair
    amount of acting out on these before any balance was restored, causing
    suffering to myself and others. Needless to say, this was a very
    trying time for our marriage.
       One of the things that happens in spiritual practice is that the
    subtle aspects of our ego, the seed essences of ego, hide within our
    own practice. If you are lucky enough, at some point the bliss force
    of the divine will force these out into the open.
       So it wasn't all just bliss.  It was an encounter with the ugliest
    sides of myself and the most beautiful. The whole picture.  The
    visions, on a daily basis, kept arising.  By and large they involved
    an experiment in mixing states of bliss with my previous practice of
    self inquiry and the feeling of silent emptiness.  Bliss wed to
    emptiness produces tremendous power and that's what was being
    introduced at this point.

    R: I can see the evolution of you path from Gurdjieff's very concrete
    self work into the devotional relationship with a master and mystical
    states and that leading into silence and inquiry. It seems kind of
    like this Tantric part was finishing you off. So did this practice
    lead to your realization?

    P: This was all going on without any conscious volition at all.  I was
    continuing Advaitic non-dual self inquiry with all the force I could:
    Who is the one experiencing this?  And if I had actually been able to
    stop these experiences I probably would have, because they were
    distracting me from inquiry as well as provoking some pretty stupid
    behavior in my ordinary life. Luckily, the power of the Dakini, the
    wisdom woman, was so much greater than my piddling efforts to prevent
    it. But as these experiences continued in the body, mind and emotions
    I continued my inquiry.
      The awakening came as a result of this practice mix.  The mind of
    bliss is capable of penetrating much more deeply into
    truth. Happiness, bliss and pleasure inspire a radical kind of
    courage. Without it no one would leap into that sky of deathlessness
    and selflessness. Without the bliss force no one would be such an
    idiot as to throw their life away on a hunch. Realization itself is
    beyond any and all experience. It is, however, not exclusive of
    experience or even rejecting of it; it is all-inclusive. After
    awakening one is restored to absolute and endless humor.

    R. So how did your teaching work begin and where did the Tantric
    transmission figure in that?

    P. Several months after Awakening, a friend of my wife's, feeling the
    difference in me, asked if I would help her with her spiritual
    practice.  I agreed, and several months later more friends of our
    family asked if I would work with them.  My teaching began very slowly
    and gradually.  In the beginning, what I taught was non-dual inquiry,
    because it seemed the most direct.  What I realized over time was that
    the practice of inquiry and also the natural practice of devotion
    toward the formless divine is ineffective in most people's lives.  It
    doesn't carry with it the skillful means to work with the obscurations
    and defilements - the gross and subtle neuroses - that prevent people
    from realizing their own nature of bliss and awareness in perfect
    union.
       The Advaitic practice that I was doing was extremely similar to the
    Dzogchen or Ati Yoga teachings of the Nyingma lineage.  It was through
    the Advaitic practices that I was able to reconnect.
       One of the most amazing things about Padmasambhava, Yeshe
    Tso-gyal's Guru, was his recognition that there were many teachings
    that would need to be re-discovered at a later time.  He and Yeshe
    Tso-gyal wrote the practices down and hid them in the elements and in
    the pure nature of awareness - in the mind stream of his
    disciples. This is the true origin of my connection to Tantra.
    Padmasambhava created what is called a Mind Mandate Seal and hid
    teachings on Tantra's skillful means like a timed-release
    capsule. When my own practice matured to the point where it was
    appropriate this force of wisdom opened.  The force, power and bliss
    of it was released also, even though I had completely forgotten this
    connection.

    R: So you really didn't have any contact with Tibetan lamas, or the
    Nyingma (Padmasambhava's) lineage, yet your teaching is very much
    influenced by Tantra and you recognize Padmasambhava as your root
    Guru. Without any contact with the lineage, you're kind of a wild card
    as a teacher.

    P: (Laughing uproariously) Yeah, I am a wild card as a Tantric
    Master. But even wilder than this crazy connection with Tantra is that
    I am free. Free of birth and death, fear, anxiety, worry. Free beyond
    being and non-being. Free to do anything. And I just might - and it's
    a wonderful thing!
         A wild card like me who has awakened into and embodied the heart
    of Tantric practice is unique in terms of the trans-cultural migration
    of Tantra to the West.  Padmasambhava was a wild guy because he was
    the freedom and bliss of this mysterious reality. Those who awaken to
    their true nature are the same one - though in their own unique
    appearance. As Tantra develops in this culture, many aspects of its
    form are going to have to change.  At the same time this must be done
    in such a way as to not damage the teachings. This is a job of great
    delicacy. These changes need to be done by someone who stands outside
    the traditional lineages yet respects the heart drop of the teachings
    with extreme reverence..
       All Tantric practice originates from Pure Vision revelation.
    Tantric practices in the Buddhist form originate from the
    Sambhogakaya, or the Visionary Bliss Realm of reality. An advanced
    practitioner can receive teachings from this source though it is very
    rare. An awakened master is this realm - it is an aspect of their
    body.
       It is certainly reasonable to be skeptical, and I ask my
    students not to accept anyone's teachings on blind faith, but to test
    them in the laboratory of their own body/mind.  The faith needed to
    have a Tantric relationship to a Spiritual Master has to develop over
    a long period of time.  You can't simply jump right into it. There
    must be testing on both sides - time and deeds. I certainly am mad by
    any standard. You and I don't live in even remotely similar worlds. I
    know the universe to be my body, time itself to be my subtle form, and
    the sky of deathless awareness to be my mind.  My interest now is to
    spark this awakening in others, not to have them fixate on me. That
    would only destroy their growth and in the long or short run cause
    them to hate me. We all hate what we are dependent on - no one likes
    to be a slave.
       You should take a little time before hopping into the Dharma bed
    because once in it there really is no such thing as safe sex. Think
    about it as carefully as you would a marriage partner. It can take
    years.
       There is a safety catch: You don't receive advanced
    Tantric practices in the beginning anyway.  You begin with the
    pre-preliminary practices, which in our community are a series having
    to do with developing stability in body, mind and emotion at the
    ordinary psychological level.  You can use the traditional meditations
    on loving kindness, and exchanging oneself for others. These styles of
    meditation work very deeply.  At the same time, I might suggest that
    somebody seek out therapy, or work in a Twelve Step program.
       If you are obsessed with anxiety, fear, worry, comparison,
    shame, self doubt, body doubt, sex doubt, then those things become
    your center of gravity.  The constant effort to compensate for the
    pain of neurosis saps you of the joy of ordinary life and the energy
    for spiritual evolution. In this state of being, people try to replace
    the work neededto develop an authentic center of gravity with the
    Master or God - as if some external could be it for you. This must be
    outgrown.
       Next there are the extraordinary Tantric preliminaries involving
    Prostrations, Vajrasattva practice, Mandala practice and Guru
    Yoga. These are fairly traditional. This is not an assembly line to
    enlightenment. Each person s path is unique and possibly very
    different from this description. There are people in our community who
    never work with the Tantric path at all, who work along other
    lines. The extraordinary preliminaries however are profound
    psycho-transformational methods weaving together body, emotion, energy
    and mind to awaken latent potential.
       During this phase and after the preliminaries are finished students
    begin to work with the energies of diety yoga and the radical
    practices of Advaita and Mahasanti.  Another way I work with my
    students is to send them to the best of the living masters from the
    traditional lineages.  This broadens their view and them to test my
    teaching, my style of teaching, and the authenticity of my
    transmission in the context of those who are commonly acknowledged to
    be Tantric Masters. Three wonderful Masters I send my disciples to are
    Chagdud Tulku, Lama Tharchin, and Nkgapa Chogyam.

    R: It doesn't sound like you're shy about letting your students go out
    and experience other Masters.

    P: Absolutely not!

    R. That seems a bit unusual. Most people have a great fear of Gurus
    entrapping them in dependency relationships. Sending disciples to
    other masters seems like it would help cut through that.

    P. It is necessary for two reasons.  One is that it cross-pollinates
    the lineage.  This is one of the beautiful things about Tantra.  You
    need the foundation of more than one master.  You need to receive the
    special energies of transmission and empowerment from a variety of
    skillful masters.  This cross-pollinates, just like in gardening; it
    creates a stronger plant. There is one Guru in your heart and many in
    the world. It is up to each person to figure out who their heart
    connection is with.
       The other reason is, I am a wild card as far as Tantric teachings
    go. I claim the authority to teach Tantra based on my own radical
    awakening into non-dual awareness and my own Mind Mandate Transmission
    from Padmasambhava. Such claims could easily be made by any idiot -
    and often are. I want my students and disciples to have a strong
    ground on which they can evaluate me and decide where our connection
    will go. I would like my students who do Tantric practice to be able
    to work with other masters so that they can come to a greater degree
    of understanding of my work when evaluated in the context of the
    traditional tantric practice.

    R: It seems to me that there is a lot of information and books written
    about sexual Tantra, and certainly more people are interested in that
    than in other forms of Tantra. Perhaps they are seeking this bliss
    courage that you mentioned earlier.  Do you think that people
    practicing sex yoga are by and large serious Tantric practitioners?

    P: Well, there's no point in judging other peoples' spiritual paths.
    If your path is not authentic over time that becomes clear.
    Traditionally, the use of sexuality in Tantra comes at a very
    developed stage of the path. There is no sexual Tantra if one has not
    transcended desire. Certainly a lot of people are trying to explore
    and play with sexual energy, and that is great, and they are relating
    it to the word Tantra because Tantra uses sexuality as part of the
    path.  We live in a seemingly open and permissive culture that
    actually is very uptight, prudish and provincial.  We hype neurotic
    sense stimulation in order to sell everything from shampoo to
    cars. Underneath, there is fear of everything genital.
       Tantra, however, is not about sexuality. It is about enlightenment.
    Compared to the bliss force of your true nature, the pleasure of
    orgasm is pretty puny. The teachings can be used to bring a certain
    degree of ordinary balance to the psyche, including openness about
    sexuality. That's a very good thing but let's not stop at the doorway!

    R: Enjoying Tantra for the psychological help is good but no
    substitute for radical absolute spiritual liberation.

    P: Right.

    R: You emphasize community and that is very interesting to me. I find
    that many people these days want their practice to be a personal and
    private part of their life. Relationships are hard and spiritual
    practice is hard mixing the two seems like it could ease up the
    process or complicate it.

    P: For spiritual practice, community is of vital importance in our
    culture. In traditional cultures the shock that broke one out of
    complacent patterns came from moving out of a community that had been
    the center of one s life.  In our culture, we have just the opposite
    senario. The shock here is brought about when people move into
    community from the isolated lives that our culture creates. This was
    central to the Gurdjieff system and very powerful.

    R: That sense of isolation we have as a culture is very sad.

    P: It is very sad - heartbreaking!  As you grow and mature in sadhana
    you need to test your growth in daily life, in job, in relationship,
    and in the community of other practitioners. There are of course
    exceptions to this, people who need solitude for their practice to
    grow strong, and there are practices which require prolonged solitude
    for accomplishment.  Right now I am discussing with the community the
    formation of a Hermitage center for long term intensive retreats.
    This is very important if we re going to actually manifest the higher
    levels of practice and destroy the tyranny of ordinary appearance.
       We must be careful that the higher and highest levels of Tantric
    practice do get transmitted. The loss of these great methods is a real
    danger.  There is a danger to the traditional forms of Tantra because
    the cultures of Tantric practice are being decimated by war or
    westernization, the cult of scientism. I think in our culture there is
    a different threat: That the deeper levels of practice will not be
    reached to begin with. In our culture the threat is that Tantra will
    be stillborn. Practitioners will have to break through the cult of
    TV. mentality and mediocrity into the dignity of their Vajra natures
    if Tantra is to take root here and flower in its fullness.

    R: There might not be enough students who have the basics down and
    then move into the deeper levels of practice.

    P: Right.  As Tantric practice takes root in our culture it is
    important that there be an understanding of the vastness of
    possibilities that Tantra offers. Waking up into the bliss-mad realm
    of the perfect union of perception and pure pleasure is really quite
    something. It is better than what people are dreaming up in the sex
    workshops.
       For one who is awake, the relationship to the world, to the
    elements, is completely different than for anybody else.  We have to
    be able to move into the really magical and wondrous forms of
    transformational practice where you are working not only with your own
    body/mind at its most subtle levels, but the elements themselves. That
    level of awakening needs to be realized It s power needs to be applied
    to the culture and the actual ground upon which we live. To work at
    these levels - the beginning levels and the most advanced levels,
    which bring radical awakening or enlightenment - to work with all of
    these is the real gift that Tantra brings.  The gift is that we can
    encompass the whole of our lives, from the ordinary to the most
    wondrous, in a single path.

    R: Which is quite a feat.

    P: It is!  The Tantric yogi, who can live married with children, a
    completely ordinary life, but at the same time play with the world as
    an ornament of awareness, is really something! To recognize all
    appearance as the ornament of your own wisdom nature and to live in
    the bliss-mad realm of freedom where all perception is delight: That
    is the goal of Tantra.

    R: Thank you.

    P: Remember we are talking here about your birthright. Awakening is
    your birthright. Accept your inheritance!
