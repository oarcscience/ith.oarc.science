    1.
    Empowerment of Khando Chenmo Yeshe Tsogyel
    The Female Tantric Buddha

    The Practice of the Yeshe Tsogyel Awareness-spell encourages the
    Strong Laughter of the Dakinis as an aspect of one's existence.  This
    means that one's circumstances become vivid with opportunities for
    Practices, and electric with the immanent possibilities of Liberation.
    With this practice there is the innate encouragement to be vital and
    alive in each moment, to experience a nakedness of perception and the
    dynamic continuity of 'the inescapeability [sic] of *what is*'.  The
    Completion Phase Practice of Khandro Chenmo Yeshe Tsogyel is to
    realize Transference of consciousness at the time of Death to the
    Realised Sphere of her own mind, known as 'o-kar Kang-ri - the Mountain
    of White Light.'


    2.
    Waning Moon and Yeshe Tsogyel Tsog-khorlo Envisionment

    >From within the Lucid Shining Emptiness of my own Being,

    I instantly arise in the Iridescent Form of the Great Enlightened Dakini;
    Khandro Chenmo Yeshe Tsogyel.  My Gaze is at once Soft and Penetrating;
    Compassionate yet Playfully Wrathful, in token of my ability [to]
    infuse all circumstances with vivid opportunities for Realisation.
    My Wide Open Eyes Sparkle with the Electricity of Existence
    and Non-existence and communicate the immanence of Liberation
    for all Yogis and Yoginis.

    My mouth is open and my tongue is flickering.
    My Strong Laughter overpowers all dualistic conceptions.

    My hair is wound up in a Yogini's bun on top of my head
    and ornamented with a golden takdrol topped with a flaming skull.
    I am naked in token of utter lack of pretension and complete fearlessness.
    I am open to the entire universe and the inescapability of what is.

    I wear the six human bone cemetery ornaments
    to show that I have accomplished the six Tantric Vehicles;
    and, as the sign that I have passed beyond all relative constraints.
    I wear the Conch Yogini earrings, and Sit on a Tiger skin
    in display of my mastery of all Siddhis.

    In my left hand I hold the skull bowl;
    symbol of the Transformed emotions, and of Wisdom.
    The white bone of the skull is the Male Quality of Spacious Passion.
    The red frothing oceans of menstrual blood within the skull bowl
    is the Female Quality of Passionate Space.

    I cradle the Khatvangha trident in the crook of my left arm.
    The three points of the khatvanga
    pierce the fabric of attraction, aversion and indifference.
    The secret Nature of the Khatvangha is Padhmasambhava
    who is my Secret Inner Method nature.
    In my right hand I hold the golden Five Pronged Wrathful Vajra,
    with which I overpower all apparent phenomena in Bliss-Emptiness.

    I sit in the Dzogchen Yogini's posture: in Display of the natural condition,
    in which everything relaxes into its own condition of Primal Purity.
    My right foot is extended in token of my ability
    to enter swiftly into Activity for the benefit
    of Everyone and Everything Everywhere.

    1. Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche - biographic details
    [Bolds and italics not reproduced in either of these.]

    Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche is an English-born Lama, recognized as the second
    Incarnation of the Tantric Yogi 'a-Shul Pema Ledgen, by His Holiness Kyabje
    Khordong Terchen Tulku Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche  (Holder of the Chang-Ter
    and Khordong-Ter Lineages of the Nyingma School).

    The Nyingma are the oldest Tradition of Tantra in Tibet, and the one most
    directly associated with Padmasambhava (the Second Buddha who brought
    Tantra to Tibet).

    The Nyingma are the Holders of the Dzogchen Teaching - the most Direct
    and Essential Path of the Three Inner Tantras.  The Inner Tantras of the
    Nyingma are unique in the richness and simplicity of their View and Method,
    and Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche is becoming increasingly well known for his
    authentic yet radical presentation of these Ancient Spiritual Treasure
    Teachings.

    Kyabje Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche (Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche's Root Teacher -
    Spiritual Father) is one of the Great Tertons of this century.  The Tertons
    are Revealers of the Hidden Spiritual Treasures of Padmasambhava,
    mystically sealed (through his Enlightened Mind-Mandate) to be Discover
    [sic] at future times.  These Astonishing Teachings were Hidden for future
    Discovery with the Intention that the Nyingma Tradition would never grow
    stale, but would continually address the current situation of people in
    the world.  Ter are encoded in the Secret Dakini Script of Khandro Yeshe
    Tsogyel (the Enlightened Tibetan Woman - Yogini and mystic consort of
    Padmasambhava) and they come to light whenever the Tradition is in
    danger of stagnating through the human cultural tendency to atrophication.

    Ter re-vitalise the entire Tradition in terms of its poignant relevance
    to our times.  The Tertons (Incarnations of the twenty-five Disciples of
    Padmasambhava) are predicted to appear at various times to reveal
    Teachings, and these Great Lamas are the living fire of the Nyingma School.
    By making contact with such Lamas we are brought into Direct contact
    with the Mind Speech and Presence of Padmasambhava as a potent personal
    reality; and this is seldom more true than in the case of Kyabje Chhimed
    Rigdzin Rinpoche.  Kyabje Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche (the Incarnation of
    one of the twenty-five disciples, called Kye-chung Lotsa) is one of the
    few major living Tertons; and has (in his present life as Terchen Zilngon
    Lingpa) discovered many powerful and extraordinary Ter.

    In his last life, he was known as Khalding Lingpa and in that life Ngakpa
    Chogyam Rinpoche was a Heart-Son of this MahaSiddha and Great Terton
    (referred to earlier in this text as 'a-Shul Pema Legden).  'a-Shul Pema
    Legden was Khalding Lingpa's Visionary Artist and Ter-scribe and worked
    with him very closely.

    'a-Shul Pema Legden, a monk-Yogi, was inpired to renounce his monastic
    vows late in life in order to spend his remaining years in the company of
    a young wandering Yogini.

    His Incarnation, Aro Yeshe, spent his short life as Togden in a Gar (Yogic
    tent encampment) on the Tibetan-Nepalese border, where he instructed his
    disciples according to his own Visionary Revelations.

    In this life, Rinpoche recognized his connection with the Tradition of
    Padmasambhava whilst still relatively young, but only in a rather abstract
    sense as all overt reminders were absent in his life.  It took until he was
    fifteen before he met with the actuality of the Tibetan Tantric Tradition
    of the Wrathful Awareness-Beings in books of Thangka paintings.  From that
    time onward he sought out information on Tibet from as many available
    sources as he could determine.  This eventually led him to travel to the
    Himalayas, where he received Tantric Teachings and Empowerments with
    Lamas of each of the Tibetan Schools.  This enabled him, not only to
    develop a profound appreciation for all the Schools but also to
    re-establish his link with the Nyingma White Tradition.

    Lamas of the White Tradition take Tantric rather than Sutric ordination,
    and are therefore not required to be celibate or abstemious.  Their vows
    are primarily Internal, but among their various external commitments is
    their characteristic sign of having un-cut hair.  White Tradition Lamas
    are called Ngakpas (or Ngakmas in the case of women).  The word 'Ngakpa'
    literally means: Mantra man, and indicates someone who has gained the
    power of mantra (Awareness-spell) through Practice.

    Rinpoche took his Ngakpa ordination and Empowerments (in which he received
    his robes) from Kyabje Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche in 1978 and was acknowledged
    as a Spiritual Son.  Although Kyabje Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche recognised him
    immediately as 'a-Shul Pema Legden, he waited until 1988 before letting
    Rinpoche know due to the time having previously been inauspicious.  It was at
    this later time also that Rinpoche was Empowered with the authority to wear
    the Tak-drol ornament (Liberation on Wearing) in his hair in recognition of
    his ability.

    Whilst in the Himalayas, he undertook several long solitary retreats and
    followed the instruction to practice in wild and fearful places.  He
    practiced under the guidance of several Lamas who were highly accomplished
    Tantric Adepts and Masters of Dzogchen.  Through his training he underwent
    various terrifying ordeals during the Practice of Chod (the charnal-ground
    Practice of Cutting Attachment to both subtle and overt reference points -
    the personal demons that devour our life-energy life energy [sic].

    In 1983, he returned to Britain to be able to help people interested follow
    the Path of the Nyingma White Tradition.  In returning, he determined to make
    it possible for ordinary people to practice in an urban Western context.
    He was initially requested to Teach at the Lam-rim Buddhist Centre in Wales
    by his old friend Ven. Ani Tsultrim Zangmo la - who had received nuns' robes
    from H.H. Gyalwa Karmapa in the early 1960's.  From the first public Teaching
    enthusiastic requests came for him to Teach regularly in Cardiff, Wales.
    Within a year a group of personal students gathered around him and
    "Sang-ngak-cho-dzong" was established.

    This name was given to Rinpoche and his students by His Holiness Kyabje
    Jigdrel Yeshe Dorje Dudjom Rinpoche (the late Supreme Head of the Nyingma
    School) and means: Secret Awareness-spell Fortress.  "Sang-ngak-cho-dzong"
    has become a highly individual association of people enthusiastically
    committed to the establishment of the Nyingma White Tradition in the West.
    They study and Practice under the guidance of Rinpoche (who has devised
    an Apprenticeship programme for their training) and integrate the Practice
    of the Nyingma Inner Tantras with their everyday working and family
    lives.  Rinpoche has evolved a fiercely gleeful approach, combined
    with a humorous sensitivity to life-issues of people in the West.

    Rinpoche is the author of 'Rainbow of Liberated Energy' (1986), and
    'Journey into Vastness' (1989).

    He is currently engaged with the writing of his third book, entitled:
    'Wearing the Body of Visions', which deals with the Visionary Practices
    of the Kye-rim phase of Inner Tantra.

    He has contributed several chapters to books on the psychology/Buddhism
    interface (notably 'Space in Mind') and given interviews to a variety of
    magazines in the spheres of Buddhism, psychology, shamanism, health,
    alternative medicine, spirituality and creativity.  He has a variety of
    media appearances (notably in the Observer and the BBC Television
    documentary: 'The Lotus and the Leek'; a film on Tibetan Buddhism in
    Wales).  Rinpoche has given a number of key-note addresses at
    international conferences, such as the British Psychological Society
    (1986) and SEN/Institute of Transpersonal Psychology (1990).

    An unusual aspect of Rinpoche's Teaching, is that he has committed himself
    to working with a relatively small number of personal students (called
    Apprentices) for whom he gives Apprentice Retreats.

    He also gives Open Teaching Retreats in order to introduce wider audiences
    to the methods of the Nyingma Inner Tantras.  Rinpoche travels widely at
    the invitation of various institutions and individuals and is keen to
    establish links between his Tradition and the Arts.  He is enthusiastically
    engaged in making available the powerful Teachings that have long been
    obscured by both cultural and academic  barriers, and in making it possible
    for people to integrate their Practice with the life-styles that are common
    in the West.

    He is a Tantric artist, calligrapher, poet, singer and healer.  His
    calligraphies have been exhibited at a number of galleries and have been
    commissioned for the covers of several books and magazines.  In 1989, he
    was awarded a Doctorate (by the International Nyingma Society, founded by
    His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche) in Tibetan Tantric Psychology.  In November
    1990 Rinpoche Discovered a Crystal Sphere (Shel-kar) buried in the sacred
    hill of Swayambhu (Katmandu, Nepal).  This Miraculous Object was
    subsequently validated as Ter of Padmasambhava by both His Holiness
    Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and His Holiness Kyabje Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche.

    Rinpoche is a personal friend and Vajra-brother of Lama Sonam Sangpo
    Rinpoche and Lama Tharchin Rinpoche.  With his Vajra-Brothers, he shares
    the wish that in these difficult times all those who Teach the precious
    Vajrayana Traditions should work together to encourage harmony and
    enthusiasm for the Spacious-Passion of the Teachings.

    Rinpoche's work is to present the Essence of the Tantric View of Life as a:
    dynamic yet subtle; spacious yet grounded path - free of the current
    spiritual biases toward: fantasy, 'meaningful' cosiness, thirst for
    intensity, or the spiritualisation of neurosise. [sic]

    "If you were to fall to your death from a very great height;
      it would be a shame not to enjoy the view as you fell,
      or to appreciate the wind in your hair
      and the warmth of the sun in your face.
      To Practice Tantra is to Ride the Tiger of Crazy Wisdom:
      to plummet into Wisdom-Fire, and emerge
      Wearing the Body of Visions!"

    Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche



    2.  'Friends of Sang-ngak-cho-dzong'

    "Sang-ngak-cho-dzong" was named by His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche.
    It is an association of those who follow the Nyingma White Tradition
    under the guidance of Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche.  The purpose of becoming
    a 'Friend of Sang-ngak-cho-dzong' is to be able to remain in contact with
    Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche without becoming an Apprentice (see
    Apprenticeship Information and Application Form).


    The White Tradition

    The White Lineages of the Nyingma School are sometimes known as the
    house-holder or nonmonastic traditions.  These are the Lineages that
    owe their inspiration to Padmasambhava (the Tantric Buddha) and touch,
    more than any other, on integration with everyday life.  Many great Siddhas
    in these Linneages have been nomads or farmers.  There have been great
    Teachers who have been illiterate, yet who have bequeathed Teachings
    which have occupied scholars for centuries.  Many important Lamas of
    this Tradition (men and women) have been family people, whose family
    lives have demonstrated the Essence of the Teaching in its most profound
    respects.  The Inner Tantra Teachings and practice-style of the White
    Tradition could obviously be of immense benefit to us in the West today;
    but sadly it is not widely known or made available.


    Inner Tantra

    The Inner Tantras of the Nyingma School provide profound methods for
    realisation in one life-time.  The Maha-yoga and Anu-yoga provide methods
    which transform the energy of the individual through Vision and Inner Sound;
    and Ati-yoga, enables us (through direct introduction by the Lama) to
    explode the confines of conventional reality.  Within the Yogic Lineages
    of the White Tradition there exist a startling variety of psycho-physical
    methods which are brilliant in their simplicity and dynamic effectiveness.
    This rich vibrant tradition needs to be preserved.  The lives of the Lamas
    of this tradition (especially those who are now old) need to be recorded
    and their inspirational Teaching-stories related.  To provide information
    one the White Tradition, and the Teaching work of Rinpoche, we publish
    'Hidden Word'.


    'Hidden Word' the journal.

    'Friends of Sang-ngak-cho-dzong' are on our mailing list, and always find
    out when and where courses or retreats given by Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche
    will be held; well in advance.  You will also receive a copy of our journal
    'Hidden Word' which is produced twice a year.  'Hidden Word' is the journal
    of "Sang-ngak-cho-dzong".  It provides information on the White Tradition
    of the Nyingma School (White Lineages of the Kagyud and Sakya Schools,
    occasionally, will also be featured).

    Rinpoche is dedicated to the establishment of a White Tradition of Ngakphang
    & Nalphang Practitioners based upon integration with life as it's lived for
    most people in our times.  'Hidden Word' contains occasional Teachings given
    by Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche, and by his Tsa-wa'i Lama - H.H. Kyabje Khordong
    Terchen Tulku Chhimed Rigdzin Rinpoche.  'Hidden Word' contains occasional
    interviews with Rinpoche's Vajra Brothers and Sister: Sonam Sangpo Rinpoche,
    Tharchin Rinpoche and Khandro Tendzin Dolkar.  Each edition contains an
    interview and/or Teaching with Ngakpa Chogyam Rinpoche.

    It will contain information from rare sources; together with illustrations,
    line drawings and photographs of the Tradition.


    Participation.

    As a 'Friend of Sang-ngak-cho-dzong' you will be actively supporting the
    many objectives of establishing this Ancient Tradition in a manner that can
    be accessed for the benefit of people with jobs and families.  These aims
    include Teacher-training programmes, which will enable more people to
    have access to Western Lamas within this Tradition.

    We are at this time engaged in the task of raising the necessary funds for
    establishing a retreat place, which will be called "Tigers' Nest" after
    the meditation cave where Padmasambhava manifersted [sic] Dorje Trollo.
    (This will become the permanent home for this style of Teaching and
    Practice.) Any contributions, therefore, are warmly welcomed - however
    small.  Charitable status is currently in process of application and
    should be obtained by the end of 1992.

    D. Supplemental Notes and Comments [My comments are in brackets. - Tyagi]:
    ____________________________________________

    "Yeshe Tsogyel... Tib., lit. 'Princess of the Wisdom Lake,' 757-817;
    intimate companion of Padmasambhava and the most important female
    figure in the tradition of the Nyingmapa school.  Named for a miracle
    that occurred at the time of her birth, the rising of a nearby lake....
    Padmasambhava took her as his consort and transmitted to her
    particularly the teachings of the *phurba* cycle.  Yeshe Tsogyel
    codified countless of her guru's teachings in *terma* texts and
    also composed his biography.  In the last part of her life she was
    active mainly in east Tibet.  She is venerated up to the present
    day as a *dakini*."

    _The Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen_, by Fischer-Schreiber,
    Ehrhard, and Diener, transl. by Michael Kohn, Shambhala Pubs. Inc., 1991;
    page 253.


    "Phurba... Tib., lit. 'nail, wedge'; a dagger for subduing demons
    introduced into the ritual of Tibetan Buddhism by Padmasambhava.
    As a system for the direct transmutaton of negative forces, it plays
    a central role in a system of meditative practice that was transmitted
    by Yeshe Tsogyel.  The actual *phurba* is a three-edged knife with a
    handle in the shape of half of a *dorje*....

    "The origin of the *phurba* is associated with a long Tantra presented
    by Padmasambhava at the beginning of his journey to Tibet.  A deity
    personified as a *phurba* plays an important role as a *yidam* in the
    Sakyapa and Nyingmapa schools;..."  Ibid, page 170.


    "Dakini...Skt.; in Indian folk belief, a female demon to be found in the
    company of gods; in Vajrayana Buddhism, the inspiring power of
    consciousness, usually depicted in the iconography as a wrathful
    naked female figure (forms of manifestation).  As semiwrathful or
    wrathful *yidam*, the dakini has the task of integrating the powers
    liberated by the practitioner in the process of visualization
    (*sadhana*).  In Tibetan, *dakini* is translated as *khadroma*.
    *Kha* means 'celestial space,' emptiness (*shunyata*) become
    an image; *dro* has the meaning of walking and moving about;
    *ma* indicates the feminine gender in substantive form.  Thus the
    *khadroma* is a female figure that moves on the highest level
    of reality; her nakedness symbolizes knowledge of truth unveiled.
    The homeland of the *dakinis* is said to be the mystic realm of
    Urgyen [aka Shambhala]."  Ibid, page 50.


    "Yidam... Tib., lit. 'firm mind'; in Vajrayana Buddhism, a term for a
    personal deity, whose nature corresponds to the individual
    psychological makeup of the practitioner.  *Yidams* are manifestations
    of the *sambhogakhaya* [buddha-body of delight] and are visualized
    in meditative practice (*sadhana*), i.e. perceived with the inner eye.
    They can take on either a peaceful or wrathful form of manifestation....

    "Tibetan Buddhism does not particularly regard *yidam* as protective
    deities (as the personal deities...are regarded in Hindu Tantra); rather
    their function is as an aid in the transformative process in which the
    practitioner comes to acknowledge his or her own basic personality
    structure.  The *yidams* also serve to bring the practitioner to a
    sense of ultimate connection with the traditional lineage whose
    teaching he or she follows....

    "In the Tibetan pantheon, male and female deities are also represented
    in union (*yab-yum*), as, for example, the male deities Chakrasamvara
    and Vajrabhairava with their consorts...."  Ibid, page 253.


    "Following many trials, Tsogyel eventually received full initiation
    into the Tantra and was transformed into a 'Sky-walker,' a female adept
    of the highest order.  Padmasambhava said to her, 'The basis for realizing
    enlightenment is a human body.  Male or female, there is no great
    difference.  But if she develops the mind bent on enlightenment, the
    woman's body is better.

    "For many years thereafter, Tsogyel worked for the good of all - feeding
    the hungry, clothing the naked, caring for the sick, instructing the
    ignorant, and 'giving her sexual parts to the lustful.'...

    "Tsogyel also married a leper and served him as a model wife.  She died at
    a great age, and is now venerated as Tibet's top female Tantric master."

    _Lust For Enlightenment: Buddhism and Sex_, by John Stevens, Shambhala
    Pubs. Inc., 1990; pages 70-72.
