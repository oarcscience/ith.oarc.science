                            INTRODUCTION
 
 //Words of Truth// was composed by His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso, the 
 Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, during the autumn of 1960, a year 
 and a half after he was forced into exile in India. It is one of the 
 most important prayers for Tibetans today. It is recited each 
 morning with their daily prayers and sung to a medley of four lovely 
 melodies on occasions such as the March 10 Uprising Day observance.
 
    For Tibetans there is no separation between the sacred and the 
 secular. Accordingly, this prayer finds a place in both arenas. 
 //Words of Truth// is dedicated to restoring peace, the Buddhist 
 teachings, and the culture and self-determination of the Tibetan 
 people in their homeland. It is also an invocation of compassion 
 towards all suffering sentient beings: oppressor and oppressed 
 alike.
    
    Prayer serves most immediately to focus the thoughts toward a 
 specific end, in this case the preservation of Tibetan civilization 
 and the goal of universal compassion. Prayer is also a refined 
 expression of a state of mind, of an inner vision. Prayer is a crown 
 jewel of speech. Speech is intimately tied to the breath, the coarse 
 form of energy that empowers the mind's awareness. While all speech 
 has such subtle power its basis, prayer (recited or sung) is a 
 carefully crafted mode of speech -- a vital channel into the depths 
 of the mind.
    
    Thus, one truly can appreciate the significance and beauty of His 
 Holiness's //Words of Truth//. May its multifold repetition in the 
 Tibetan, and now English, language contribute to the goal of 
 compassionate liberation for all sentient beings.

                        A Prayer Composed by
   HIS HOLINESS TENZIN GYATSO, THE FOURTEENTH DALAI LAMA OF TIBET,
             Honoring and Invoking the Great Compassion
           of the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Teachings,
                     and the Spiritual Community
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
               O Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and disciples
                  of the past, present, and future:
                     Having remarkable qualities
                   immeasurably vast as the ocean,
               Who regard all helpless sentient beings
                         as your only child;
          Please consider the truth of my anguished pleas.
                                        
                                        
         Buddha's full teachings dispel the pain of worldly
                 existence and self-oriented peace;
   May they flourish, spreading prosperity and happiness through-
                      out this spacious world.
                  O holders of the Dharma: scholars
                     and realized practitioners;
            May your ten fold virtuous practice prevail.
                                        
                                        
                  Humble sentient beings, tormented
                    by sufferings without cease,
             Completely suppressed by seemingly endless
                and terribly intense, negative deeds,
          May all their fears from unbearable war, famine,
                      and disease be pacified,
       To freely breathe an ocean of happiness and well-being.
                  And particularly the pious people
          of the Land of Snows who, through various means,
            Are mercilessly destroyed by barbaric hordes
                      on the side of darkness,
           Kindly let the power of your compassion arise,
            To quickly stem the flow of blood and tears.
                                        
                                        
       Those unrelentingly cruel ones, objects of compassion,
                    Maddened by delusion's evils,
               wantonly destroy themselves and others;
                 May they achieve the eye of wisdom,
                knowing what must be done and undone,
           And abide in the glory of friendship and love.
                                        
                                        
       May this heartfelt wish of total freedom for all Tibet,
               Which has been awaited for a long time,
                     be spontaneously fulfilled;
             Please grant soon the good fortune to enjoy
       The happy celebration of spiritual with temporal rule.
                                        
                                        
           O protector Chenrezig, compassionately care for
             Those who have undergone myriad hardships,
         Completely sacrificing their most cherished lives,
                         bodies, and wealth,
            For the sake of the teachings, practitioners,
                         people, and nation.
                                        
                                        
           Thus, the protector Chenrezig made vast prayers
                 Before the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
                 To fully embrace the Land of Snows;
      May the good results of these prayers now quickly appear.
            By the profound interdependence of emptiness
                         and relative forms,
             Together with the force of great compassion
            in the Three Jewels and their Words of Truth,
                        And through the power
         of the infallible law of actions and their fruits,
               May this truthful prayer be unhindered
                       and quickly fulfilled.
                                        
                                        
                                * * *
                                        
 
 This prayer, //Words of Truth//, was composed by His Holiness Tenzin 
 Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, on 29 September 1960 at 
 his temporary headquarters in the Swarg Ashram at Dharamsala, Kangra 
 District, Himachal State, India. This prayer for restoring peace, 
 the Buddhist teachings, and the culture and self-determination of 
 the Tibetan people in their homeland was written after repeated 
 requests by Tibetan government officials along with the unanimous 
 consensus of the monastic and lay communities. Particular 
 acknowledgment was given to the requests by Barzhi Phuntsog Wangyal; 
 Lobsang Tendzin, treasurer of Lhatsun Labrang, and his wife, Tashi 
 Dolma; and Lobsang Dorje, treasurer of Shelkhar Monastery.
 
    This translation was made in Dharamsala, India, during April 1992 
 by Rabjampa Dupchok Gyaltsen and Peter Gold, under the editorial 
 guidance of the Ven. Lotsawa Lhakdor and Ven. Lotsawa Tendzin Dorje, 
 with certain clarifications by the Ven. Lobsang Gyatso, Principal of 
 the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics. It was made with the sincere 
 intention of stimulating a broad understanding of the current 
 condition of Tibet and its people, as well as of humanity as a 
 whole, whose sufferings cry out for a compassionate solution. In 
 today's interconnected world, no person or society stands alone. As 
 such, the fate of Tibet is indeed the fate of the world. His 
 Holiness's //Words of Truth// bears an essential message to us all 
 in this regard. May this translation aid in establishing peace and 
 altruism among all members of the global family.

 This versification into English lyrics was made expressly for 
 singing the prayer, //Words of Truth//, to its customary tunes. It 
 was written by Peter Gold in Dharamsala, India during April 1992 and 
 is intended to convey the basic meaning of the prayer in a manner 
 appropriate to the medium of song.

         Buddhas and saints...and disciples throughout time,
          Having qualities, infinite as the ocean is wide,
                Seeing each being as your only child,
            Please heed my truthful and anguished cries.
                                        
                                        
       Buddha's teachings:...selfish peace, suffering's cease,
           Spreading joy and prosperity through the world;
                 O scholars and great practitioners,
             May the Dharma's ten virtuous ways prevail.
                                        
                                        
          Humble beings...suffering torments without cease,
            Pressed completely by bad thoughts and deeds,
              Pacify their fears: war, famine, disease,
                To breathe an ocean of joy and peace.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                               Part II
                                        
                                        
                 Pious people in the Land of Snows,
          Destroyed...mercilessly...through various means,
                By barbarian hordes out of darkness;
    Through compassion...may the blood and tears...quickly cease.
       Cruel people needing compassion, made mad by delusions,
              Destroying...themselves...and others too;
           Give them the eye of wisdom to know what to do;
     In a glorious...state of friendship...and of selfless love.
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                              Part III
                                        
                                        
                 So this wish for freedom in Tibet,
                 It's been awaited for a long time;
                  May the good fortune arise soon,
                  Of spiritual with temporal rule.
                                        
                                        
                O protector, please look after them,
               Those who've undergone great suffering;
               Sacrificing lives and all their wealth
                For the nation, people, and religion.

                 To fully embrace the Land of Snows;
          May good things appear not through your prayers.

                 By the profound interdependence...
                  of emptiness and relative forms,
               With compassion in the Three Jewels and
                           Words of Truth,
                    And through the infallible...
