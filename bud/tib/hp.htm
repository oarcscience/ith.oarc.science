HYMN OF PRAISE
 
     I hold aloft the scepter of compassion, the diamond thunderbolt of
love. Its' five prongs showing the five wisdoms, conquering the five
passions. I must be worthy to uphold it.
 
     I hold aloft its' companion, the bell of wisdom, ringing freedom
throughout the universes. I resolve never to separate from the perfect
wisdom, to realize I cannot be separate. I will ring the bell
throughout all worlds, throughout all lives.
 
     I hold them together to show the non-duality of wisdom and
compassion, with every fiber of my being, throughout all worlds.
 
     I receive the bow and arrow, the bow of wisdom of selflessness,
the arrow of communication, precise teaching, sending out the messages
of wisdom to all beings. I shoot the arrow of freedom everywhere, in
all directions, to slay the enemy of ignorance, and cynicism, and
despair.
 
     I receive the wheel of majesty and truth. I vow to turn the wheel,
to liberate all beings, to preserve their freedoms.
 
     I hold the gesture of sophisticated understanding, fine
distinction between good and evil, beauty and ugliness.
 
     I uphold the book, the teaching of the Buddha Yamantaka, conqueror
of death. I accept responsibility for the teaching.
 
     I remind all beings of the ground of freedom and the void.
 
     I hold in reverence the ornaments of our teacher, His Holiness the
Dalai Lama, always with us in our hearts.
 
     The gesture of non-duality, the gesture of offering.
 
     I receive the radiant wish-fulfilling jewel, to uphold the
teachings of the jewel clan of the Buddhas.
 
     I receive the vajra of the vajra clan.
 
     My hands are dancing gods and goddesses of worship.
 
     I receive the lotus of the lotus clan.
 
     I touch the earth.
 
     I uphold my vajra scepter and bell.
 
     I uphold the sword of the sword clan, turning envy into all
accomplishing wisdom and its' teachings.
