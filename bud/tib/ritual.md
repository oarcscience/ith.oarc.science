    The Culture of Ritual and the Quest for Enlightenment
    -----------------------------------------------------
        By David Frawley (Vamadeva Shastri)
     
     
       Since prehistoric times, ritual has been perhaps the most important
    human activity.  Throughout the world there has existed an ancient and
    ongoing tradition of sacred action performed with the aim of improving
    not only our condition in the universe, but the condition of the
    universe itself.
     
       Indeed, the further back we look, the more we examine traditional
    and indigenous cultures, the more we find that human life has been
    primarily a ritual or set of sacred actions.  Whether we consider the
    aborigines of Australia, the Native Americans, the ancient Hindus and
    Egyptians, or our own European ancestors, we find a world-wide
    preoccupation with ritual action that cuts across all races,
    religions, and cultures. We could even say that human culture is
    primarily a culture of ritual.
     
       Yet ritual has been rejected by the modern mind as irrational,
    superstitious, or primitive.  The church had already stifled and
    sterilized ritual, and the Western enlightenments--a materialistic,
    not spiritual, enlightenment--has largely stripped our lives of
    ritual.  The idea that our actions could affect the mental or
    spiritual realm, or be linked with cosmic powers like the stars and
    planets, appeared contrary to the mechanistic scientific view that all
    things are matter, and that what is not evident through the senses
    must not exist.
     
       However, twentieth century science has revealed a universe
    consisting of interrelated energy fields and transcending ordinary
    time/space limitations. This is a world view that runs counter to
    ordinary sensory ideas of physical reality, but is not so different
    from the ritualistic view of a universe as an organic intelligence in
    which human beings play an integral part and purpose.
     
       There is a revival of interest in ritual today that is part of our
    culture's reexamination of mythology. In the academic world, ritual is
    now viewed as an art form or a means of social bonding, not merely a
    curious superstition. But such an intellectual view of ritual does not
    consider its spiritual meaning. Academics find ritual interesting,
    like an antique or relic, but do not see a need to incorporate ritual
    in our daily lives. Nor does this viewpoint regard ritual as necessary
    for either personal or collective well-being.
     
       Is ritual just some exotic or superstitious form of action,
    requiring strange paraphernalia like fires or feathers, or is it any
    action done with conscious purpose, attention, and power?
     
       Any action that is repeatedly energized with thought and intention
    gains power, thereby becoming a ritual of sorts. In fact, all our
    actions have a ritualistic orientation, because action tends toward
    repetition and reinforcement, thereby projecting a particular energy
    to link us with certain forces in the world in which we live. In this
    regard, even basic vital functions like eating and breathing are
    rituals, that is, rhythmic actions drawing into us various cosmic
    energies.
     
       Yet it is our most meaningful actions that approach ritual. Artists
    and scientists project energy and intent in action, performing with a
    certain regularity and purposefulness which renders their actions into
    a kind of ritual. Indeed, the creative individual experiences his or
    her work in a meaningful way that can be called ritualistic.  The
    highest ritual is meditation, wherein everything we do becomes imbued
    with attention and awareness.
     
    RITUAL AND KARMA
     
       The Sanskrit word karma, which usually refers to the effects of our
    actions through various lives, originally meant "ritual." Action or
    karma is always a ritual; that is, whatever action we do sets in
    motion certain forces, not only of a personal but of a collective and
    cosmic nature.
     
       All action, we could say, is like jumping into a stream. We can
    choose the stream to jump into, but once in the stream we come under
    the stream's forces, which are no longer a matter of choice. Whatever
    we do places us in a stream of action which has a momentum that will
    carry us in a particular direction. Conscious actions reinforce the
    energy of consciousness, which causes us to grow in awareness.
    Unconscious actions reinforce habit, inertia, and the energy of
    ignorance, which places us under the domination of the external world.
     
       Once we recognize that action is karma, we will approach our
    actions with an awareness that makes them sacred. We will then give
    even simple and everyday actions an attention so that we do not let
    ourselves drift in the stream of unconscious action into greater
    darkness and sorrow.
     
       However, most of us seldom recognize the karmic or ritualistic
    nature of our actions.  This is because effects of our action manifest
    only through time. Some of our actions do not bear fruit at all in the
    present incarnation.  Unless we look at the really long-term
    consequences of what we do, it is difficult to take control of our
    actions.  For example, if we could put our hands in a fire and not get
    burned until some months or years later, we might carelessly throw our
    whole body into a fire. Yet this is the type of delay that often
    exists between destructive mental actions and their outer
    consequences.
     
    RITUAL AND REINTEGRATION
     
       We have eliminated from our lives the rituals that sustain
    traditional cultures. This process began with the triumph of
    Christianity, which reduced the abundance of pagan rituals that
    permeated all of life to but a few rituals, like Mass on Sunday.
    Protestant Christianity in turn rejected most Catholic rituals,
    tending to view all ritual as idolatrous. science in its crude realism
    removed us still further from ritual, questioning the very existence
    of God.
     
       Stripped of meaningful rituals, our lives have become meaningless,
    and our action lacks any real purpose other than personal enjoyment.
    Our action is denied any cosmic significance, becoming merely a
    personal affair in which we project personal achievement and
    gratification as the true meaning of our lives.
     
       However much we may achieve personally, our action will remain
    limited and will bring inevitable sorrow. In our emphasis on the
    separate self, our actions fail to connect us with the cosmos and the
    deeper reality beyond our conditioned life.
     
       To fill the void created by a lack of true ritual, or sacred
    action, we have created, perhaps unconsciously, an entire set of false
    rituals. These are rituals of entertainment, sports, politics, and
    even crime. We have not eliminated ritual from life, but have only
    succeeded in removing any dimension of transcendence from our actions.
     
       Our rituals have become mundane and sensate, with no spiritual
    goal; they have become a repetition of sensation, and at worst, of
    negative emotions. We have invested the heroes of sports events and
    violent movies with a kind of sacred reality and given them prestige,
    honor, and adoration. It is as if they were not mere mortals, but gods
    and goddesses, glamour images of a higher reality.
     
       Even much of our religion, in which ritual survives at a reduced
    level, is dominated by false rituals promoting conflict and division
    between people, rather than uniting us with the universe. Church
    services are largely mechanical, a kind of social duty, or, if lively,
    a kind of drama and entertainment. The main messages of religion have
    become negative: sin, guilt, the devil, hell, Armageddon, and the need
    to convert "unbelievers. Such religion is rarely part of a living and
    creative opening to the great powers of the cosmic mind.
     
       Much of our modern malaise, characterized by crime, drugs, and
    promiscuity, appears to stem from a lack of meaningful ritual. True
    ritual does not consist in reinforcing conditioned patterns of
    separate identity (us vs them). Actions which do this are false
    rituals, which project a kind of hypnosis that blinds us to the unity
    of life.
     
       True ritual acts in harmony with the rhythms of the universe,
    uniting us with the great current of time and transformation leading
    to the eternal. True ritual gives a universal meaning to all that we
    do and to all with whom we come in contact, including all of nature.
    It requires being cognizant of the divine presence in the world and
    the cosmic power and interplay of all the forces in our lives.
     
       Ritual, moreover, is not illogical or unscientific. Ritual is
    perhaps the ultimate science of action, with its own logic, structure,
    and order. It is often a detailed and precise activity, in which even
    minor deviations can distort the ritual, even turning it into a
    negative action.
     
       We have lost our sense of the philosophy behind the science of
    ritual.  Ritual teaches us that what we do on a personal or
    microcosmic level corresponds to what occurs on a universal or
    macrocosmic level. It shows the way to achieve harmony in life by
    connecting our personal actions with their cosmic equivalents, uniting
    the human and the cosmic in the awareness of the cosmic being. Until
    we rediscover this inner truth of ritual, our lives are likely to
    remain confused and superficial.
     
    RITUAL AND SPIRITUALITY
     
       In the spiritual realm, we also find that ritual has often been
    devalued. Many forms of mind-oriented or psychological spirituality
    --like the direct awareness paths of Vedanta and Buddhism--appear to
    reject ritual. It is frequently stated that no action can lead us to
    enlightenment, that only knowledge--not any rite--can dispel the
    darkness. Yet the rationale for this spiritual rejection of ritual is
    quite different from that of the materialistic mind.
     
       Direct awareness paths ultimately regard ritual as a lower level of
    spiritual practice, appropriate to outer or lesser goals of life like
    health or mental harmony, but not sufficient for Self-realization.
    This is because ritual is bound by time and relies on material
    substances, which keeps us in the relative realm. These spiritual
    systems regard ritual as maintaining harmony in the relative realm,
    and so reject ritual along with the realm of relativity.
     
       Those trained in logical materialism may be inclined to adopt the
    logic of mind-oriented spirituality, rejecting ritual without having
    ever practiced any, and not grant ritual even the efficacy which mind-
    oriented teachings recognize. Mind-oriented teachings may not regard
    ritual as the highest path, but this does not mean that they reject
    ritual as useless or that the followers of these paths never perform
    any rituals. Indeed, many yogis on direct awareness paths do perform
    rituals, not for enlightenment as such but for purification,
    protection, or the giving of blessings.
     
    OUR PSYCHIC ENVIRONMENT
     
       Ritual provides a meaningful way to deal with our subtle, or
    psychic, environment, which consists of the various mental and
    emotional forces which energize our lives. Though these forces are not
    visible, like the health or disease promoting bacteria found in the
    air we breathe, nevertheless they do have specific effects. Like the
    physical environment, so too our subtle or psychic environment
    requires attention. We clean our house, do the dishes, and clean our
    body daily, but how many of us give similar care to our psychic
    environment? We may be cautious and drive carefully in the visible
    world, but how many of us give the same care to our journeying in the
    subtle world? An unclean physical environment breeds diseases, and the
    same is true of an unclean psychic environment. If we don't air our
    house out, stagnation can breed diseases. A stagnant emotional or
    psychological field has the same effect on an inner level.
     
       Most of what have been regarded as demons or ghosts in traditional
    cultures are simply negative energy patterns within our subtle
    environment or astral field. They are like the molds, bacteria, and
    viruses that attack us on a physical level. Just as cleaning our
    physical environment helps eliminate such toxins, so clearing our
    psychic environment does the same thing on its level. This is the
    basis of the work of various yogis, shamans, and psychic healers,
    and was also the original role of priests and magicians.
     
       The great yogis and sages have always been aware of the subtle
    environment. To those of inner vision, these inner influences are as
    evident as the forces of the outer world, like sunshine or rain. To be
    unaware of the forces of the subtle environment can be as dangerous as
    to be blind to those in the physical world.  Yet if we recognize these
    subtle forces and adjust to them--like putting on a raincoat to go out
    on a rainy day--we will find that most of our difficulties in life are
    avoidable, and that a new dimension of spiritual growth will open to
    us.
     
    MODALITIES OF PSYCHIC PERCEPTION
     
       There are several ways to read our inner environment. Intuition is
    perhaps the best thing.  True intuition is a form of perception, not
    mere imagination or emotion, nor is it the product of wishful
    thinking. Unfortunately, much of what we may think is a real
    perception of our psychic field may be imaginary, or may be a true
    intuition mixed with false imagination. To develop such a real
    intuition requires training in concentration, visualization, mantra,
    and meditation.
     
       There are persons who possess degrees of psychic perception. Yet
    such psychics may not be truly helpful, even when their knowledge in
    some respects is correct. Many psychics possess a light which, like a
    flashlight, can illuminate some aspect of our lives. But a limited
    light can be misleading. Though a flashlight might reveal something,
    one cannot rely upon it for full illumination. One cannot use it, for
    example, to drive a car at night. Psychic perception must be
    integrated into a full spiritual vision, an openness to enlightenment
    or Self-realization as the goal of life.
     
       There are various subtle or occult sciences which help develop and
    structure our intuition. Astrology, for example, most specifically
    shows the subtle forces in operation in our lives, as transmitted via
    the stars and planets.  The astrological birth chart shows the subtle
    energies which govern our life as a whole. It is like a map of our
    subtle environment and its forces through the current incarnation. The
    astrological chart done for any particular day and place reveals the
    general or collective subtle environment.
     
       Natural healing systems aligned with various yogic and spiritual
    practices--like the Ayurvedic medicine of India, or Tibetan medicine
    --contain an entire science of diagnosing and treating the subtle
    body.  Subtle body disorders are mirrored in mental and emotional
    conditions, in dreams, and in nervous system and sensory derangements.
    Treatments for the subtle body include subtle sensory modalities like
    aromas, colors, and gems, the use of breath (pranayama), mantra, and
    meditation. Certain foods and herbs also have their benefit. Such
    treatments usually occur as part of various rituals.
     
       Meditation, which helps us to observe and understand the workings
    of the mind, is central to any clear psychic insight. It removes the
    limitations of the ego which tend to distort our perception and cloud
    it with desire.
     
    FORMS OF RITUAL
     
       The best way to change our subtle environment is through various
    rituals, which produce a subtle energy that can clear or alter the
    psychic realm. We can learn to harness the latent subtle forces that
    exist within the physical world.
     
       Most rituals involve invoking and offering various essences or
    precious items from the world of nature. In typical Hindu puja (ritual
    offering), these involve the essences of the five elements and their
    corresponding sensory qualities.
     
    Earth--A fragrant oil (like sandalwood)
    Water--Sweet food or pure water
    Fire--The flame of a ghee lamp
    Air--Incense
    Ether--A flower
     
       Of these five, incense is perhaps most important as well as easiest
    to use. Incense creates a subtle aroma which removes stagnant energy
    from our psychic environment.
     
       Different types of incense have their respective properties and can
    be used for specific effects. For example, sandalwood is cooling and
    calming, and reduces fever, agitation, and anger. Jasmine is
    invigorating and purifying to the heart. Fragrant oils can similarly
    be used, either for anointing parts of the body (like the third eye)
    or for anointing the altar or sacred space that we use.
     
       The use of light or fire is another universal way to affect the
    subtle realm of light around us. According to yogic science, it is
    best to use a nutritive oil as fuel for the lamp. This helps nourish
    the positive energies and entities of our subtle environment. Ghee
    (clarified butter) is considered to be the best oil for lamps, but
    other vegetable oils also may be used. Candles are helpful but do not
    have the same effect as the nutritive oil in a lamp.
     
       Wood fires are still more powerful, but should be limited to
    special events. A special Vedic fire offering called Agnilotra, in
    which cow dung is burned at precise moments of sunrise and sunset, is
    considered the most powerful of Hindu rituals.
     
       Many rituals involve the use of images, which may be the picture or
    statue of a guru, avatar, or deity. Such forms help redirect our
    mental energy, which in life is usually concentrated on a personal
    form (family or friends), toward the forces of the subtle realm and
    their benefic influences.  Stone or metal statues are particularly
    strong for carrying psychic energy.  Through them, various Devas or
    beings of the subtle world can be brought into our psychic
    environment. The images themselves are not worshipped, but used as
    conduits for higher forces. We could compare them to a picture of our
    spouse that we keep at the work place to maintain a mental harmony.
     
       Ritual generally requires an altar or sacred room. Like any action,
    it requires the appropriate field for it to be done properly. A ritual
    is a way of maintaining a garden of helpful astral forces, and like
    any garden it must be tended on a regular basis. By creating a sacred
    space, ritual cleanses and spiritualizes the subtle environment.
     
       The main way of empowering ritual is through the use of mantra or
    the repetition of sacred sounds. Mantra helps us to participate
    mentally in a ritual, which is necessary to giving the ritual real
    power. This is so because ritual is a way of inner action or
    knowledge, not merely a mechanical procedure.  There are various
    mantras which relate to different ritual actions. These may be single
    seed syllables like OM, words of praise to the deity words of
    offering, or other propitiatory measures. Through mantra alone, which
    is the internal ritual or ritual of the mind and does not require any
    external substance, we can turn all of our actions into ritual.
     
    RITUAL AND DISEASE
     
       Most physical and psychological disorders begin with a derangement
    of our psychic or emotional environment. For a disease to manifest on
    the physical plane, it must first take root on the psychic plane.
    There must be some stagnation in the aural field or some degree of
    psychic vulnerability. Hence, clearing our psychic environment on a
    daily basis is an important key to physical and mental health, as well
    as an aid to spiritual practice.
     
       Each part of our environment has its special requirements. The
    kitchen, as the place where food is prepared and eaten, must be
    rendered sacred. This is done primarily by preparing our food with an
    attitude of love and respect. The bedroom, where we sleep and leave
    our bodies daily to return to our souls, also requires beauty or
    sanctification. The rooms of children, whose partially developed minds
    and bodies are more vulnerable to negative psychic influences, must
    also be protected. Our workplace, where we connect to the external
    world with its destructive influences, also requires protection.
     
       While it is best to create an altar or meditation room, we must
    consider needs of the various spheres in which we live and perform
    appropriate rituals. This does not mean that we must spend our entire
    day doing rituals. It is no more necessary to do so than it is to
    brush our teeth or sweep the floor all day long. But a certain period
    of ritual action, about one hour a day, can be helpful.
     
       Most societies have developed special classes of ritualists, such
    as priests, yogis, shamans, or magicians.  Even artists and doctors
    have been given such roles in some cultures.  Such knowers of ritual
    are important for primary sacraments or special events such as birth,
    death, marriage, or moving into a new house.  Society needs such a
    class of individuals and should give them proper compensation for
    their invaluable service.
     
       That such classes have at times degenerated and promoted
    exploitation is no reason to reject them altogether. All fields of
    human life can be abused by the human ego, but this does not deny the
    value of the action itself. Even in the modern world we invest our
    doctors, psychologists, and lawyers with a special religious aura, and
    regard their actions with ritualistic awe. This only indicates an
    ongoing social need for ritual and for those who are trained in its
    proper performance.
     
       From the yogic standpoint, what is important is to learn to master
    the subtle forces. It is of little use to analyze them. Modern
    psychology often emphasizes analysis of the psyche, especially
    relative to personal patterns of a particular incarnation. Yoga
    emphasizes changing this energetic pattern by learning how to use the
    subtle forces. Yogic practice is a process in which ritual, posture,
    breath, mantra, and meditation are used to enable us to recreate our
    own reality.
     
    RITUAL AND SOCIETY
     
       Ritual is of special importance for the collective life, for the
    benefit of society as a whole.  Collective rituals help clear the
    collective mental field of its negative karma, and help create peace
    and harmony in society, preventing war and other social disorders.
     
       One of the most simple of all rituals is a collective prayer for
    peace. Such prayers should always be directed toward peace for all
    beings, for all creation, and should not be prayers on behalf of
    particular countries, religions, or groups. The divisive interest
    created by "particularist" prayer actually breeds further conflict.
     
       One of the great problems in the modern world is that we no longer
    have spiritually meaningful collective rituals. Our collective rituals
    have become negative rituals of drama and sensation, sex and violence,
    or political action aimed at defeating an enemy. Our mass media
    generally projects a negative psychic field because it is the product
    of inorganic forces and of commercial and political motivations. TV,
    radio, and other media devices also emit vibrations that tend to lower
    the energy of our psychic field. Unless we counter these influences
    with positive rituals, the state of the world cannot improve.
     
       Rituals are of special importance for young people, who need not
    only social bonding but bonding with the world of nature and spiritual
    reality in order to discover who they really are.  Otherwise, young
    people feel alienated and out of harmony with life. Lack of meaningful
    ritual is surely a factor in the high rate of crime, depression, and
    suicide among the young.
     
    RITUAL AND MEDITATION
     
       Some great spiritual thinkers, notably J.  Krishnamurti, have
    appeared to object to the use of any ritual. Such critics say that
    ritual binds us to the realm of action and that ritual, being an outer
    action, is useless for the pursuit of enlightenment or Self-
    realization. Though such objections may reflect a lofty state of
    awareness, they do not address the real purpose of ritual. Ritual
    binds us to the realm of action only if it is done out of personal
    desire. If it is done with the same intention that we keep the rest of
    our lives in order, then it has its importance for all of us, even
    those who may be enlightened.
     
       In the true sense, ritual means right action, and any action done
    rightly, with wisdom and compassion, is a ritual.  We cannot avoid
    action as long as we live. For action not to bind us, it must be a
    ritual not in the personal sense but as a means of connecting with
    cosmic being and its movement.
     
       In this regard, meditation itself is the highest form of ritual or
    right action. Few of us can go into a state of spontaneous meditation
    whenever we choose to, but we can carry out rituals that help prepare
    the mental field or create the sacred space in which meditation can
    occur. As long as we are doing such actions in a preparatory manner,
    they cannot harm us.  From outer rituals, like fire offerings, we move
    to inner rituals, like mantra, to arrive finally at the inmost ritual,
    which is meditation.  This is the true way of action for human beings.
     
       Ultimately all of our action is a ritual, and each action sets in
    motion certain forces which further either enlightenment or ignorance.
    There is no neutral action. To become conscious of our actions and to
    connect them with the benefit forces of the universe is the essence of
    all ritual.
     
       To restore the science of ritual is thus a spiritual and
    psychological endeavor of the highest order. It is one of the
    challenges of the coming millennia. Ritual creates the structure that
    sustains our personal and collective lives.
