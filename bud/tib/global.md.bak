               Universal Responsibility and Our Global Environment
                           His Holiness the Dalai Lama


      As the twentieth century draws to a close, we find that the world has 
      grown smaller. The world's people have become almost one community.  
      Political and military alliances have created large multinational 
      groups; industry and international trade have produced a global 
      economy. Worldwide communications are eliminating ancient barriers of 
      distance, language and race. We are also being drawn together by the 
      grave problems we face: overpopulation, dwindling natural resources, 
      and an environmental crisis that threatens our air, water, and trees, 
      along with the vast number of beautiful life forms that are the very 
      foundation of existence on this small planet we share.

      I believe that to meet the challenge of our times, human beings will   
      have to develop a greater sense of universal responsibility. Each of 
      us must learn to work not just for his or her own self, family or 
      nation, but for the benefit of all mankind. Universal responsibility 
      is the real key to human survival. It is the best foundation for world 
      peace, the equitable use of natural resources and, through concern for 
      future generations, the proper care of the environment.

      That is why it is so heartening to see such non-governmental 
      organisations as yours. Your role in forging a better future is 
      absolutely essential. I have come across many such orgaisations built 
      by dedicated volunteers out of genuine concern for their fellow human 
      beings. Such commitment represents the forefront of both social and 
      environmental progress.

      Whether we like it or not, we have all been born on this earth as part 
      of one great family. Rich or poor, educated or uneducated, belonging 
      to one nation, religion, ideology or another, ultimately each of us is 
      just a human being like everyone else. We all desire happiness and do 
      not want suffering. Furthermore, each of us has the same right to 
      pursue happiness and avoid suffering. When you recognise that all 
      beings are equal in this respect, you automatically feel empathy and 
      closeness for them. Out of this, in turn, comes a genuine sense of 
      universal responsibility -- the wish to actively help others overcome 
      their problems.

      The need for a sense of universal responsibility is present in every   
      aspect of modern life. Nowadays, significant events in one part of the 
      world eventually affect the entire planet. Therefore, we have to treat 
      each major local problem as a global concern from the moment it 
      begins. We can no longer invoke the national, racial or ideological 
      barriers that separate us without destructive repercussions. In the 
      context of our new interdependence, considering the interest of others 
      is clearly the best form of self-interest.

      We need to appreciate interdependence in nature far more than we have   
      in the past. Our ignorance of it is directly reponsible for many of 
      the problems we face. For instance, tapping the limited resources of 
      our world -- particularly those of the developing nations -- simply to 
      fuel consumerism, is disastrous. If it continues unchecked, eventually 
      we will all suffer. We must respect the delicate balance of life and 
      allow it to replenish itself.

      Ignorance of interdependence has not only harmed the natural 
      environment, but human society as well. Instead of caring for one 
      another, we place most of our efforts for happiness in pursuing 
      individual material consumption. We have become so engrossed in this 
      pursuit that, without knowing it, we have neglected to foster the most 
      basic human needs of love, kindness and cooperation. This is very sad.  
      We have to consider what we human beings really are. We are not 
      machine-made objects. However, since we are not solely material 
      creatures, it is a mistake to seek fulfillment in external development 
      alone.

      To pursue growth properly, we need to renew our commitment to human  
      values in many fields. Political life, of course, requires an ethical 
      foundation, but science and religion, as well, should be pursued from 
      a moral basis. Without it scientists cannot distinguish between 
      beneficial technologies and those which are merely expedient. The 
      environmental damage surrounding us is the most obvious result of this 
      confusion. In the case of religion, it is particularly necessary.

      The purpose of religion is not to construct beautiful buildings, but 
      to cultivate positive human qualities such as tolerance, generosity 
      and love. Every world religion, no matter what its philosophical view, 
      is founded first and foremost on the precept that we must reduce our 
      selfishness and serve others. Unfortunately, sometimes in the name of 
      religion, people cause more quarrels than they solve. Practitioners of 
      different faiths should realise that each religious tradition has 
      immense intrinsic value as a means for providing mental and spiritual 
      health.

      I have been extremely heartened to follow the recent developments in 
      the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Laying down 
      guns on both sides, and talking face-to-face is, in my opinion, the 
      only way to resolve such disputes. We must learn to live together in a 
      nonviolent way that nurtures the freedom of all people.

      There is a wonderful verse in the Bible about turning swords into 
      ploughshares. It is a lovely image, a weapon transformed into a tool 
      to serve basic human needs, symbolic of an attitude of inner and outer 
      disarmament. In the spirit of this ancient message, I think it is 
      important that we stress today the urgency of a policy that is long 
      overdue -- the demilitarisation of the entire planet.  
      Demilitarisation would free great human resources for protection of 
      the environment, relief of poverty, and sustainable human development.

      I have always envisioned the future of my own country, Tibet, as 
      founded on this basis. Tibet will be a neutral, demilitarised 
      sanctuary where weapons are forbidden and the people live in harmony 
      with nature. I have called this a Zone of Ahimsa or non-violence.  
      This is not merely a dream -- it is precisely the way Tibetans tried 
      to live for over a thousand years before our country was tragically 
      invaded. In Tibet, wildlife was protected in accordance with Buddhist 
      principles. We enacted decrees to protect the environment, but it was 
      mainly protected by the beliefs which were installed in use as 
      children.

      I would like to conclude by stating that I feel optimistic about the 
      future. There are a number of recent trends which show our potential 
      for achieving a better world. The rapid changes in our attitude 
      towards the earth are a source of hope. As recently as a decade ago, 
      we thoughtlessly devoured the resources of the world as if there was 
      no end to them. We failed to realise that unchecked consumerism was 
      disastrous for both the environment and social welfare. Now, both 
      individuals and governments are seeking a new ecological and economic 
      order.

      It is true to say that as late as the 1980s people believed that war 
      was an inevitable condition of mankind. The notion prevailed that 
      people with conflicting interests could only confront each other.  
      This view has deminished. Today people all over the globe are more 
      committed to peaceful co-existence, as is evident here in the Middle 
      East. This is an astonishingly positive development.

      After believing for centuries that human society could only be   
      governed with rigid authoritarian discipline, people in all corners of 
      the world have woken up to the virtues of democracy. Speaking from 
      their hearts, they have shown that the desire for freedom and truth 
      and democracy stems from the core of human nature. Recent events have 
      proved that the simple expression of truth is an immense force in the 
      human mind, and as a result, in the shaping of history.

      One of the greatest lessons for all of us has been the peaceful change  
      in Eastern Europe. In the past, oppressed people have always resorted 
      to violence in their struggle to be free. Now, these peaceful 
      revolutions, following in the footsteps of Gandhi and Martin Luther 
      King, have given future generations a tremendous example of 
      successful, nonviolent change. When, in the future, the need arises to 
      change society, our descendents can look back to 1989 as a paradigm  
      for peaceful struggle: a real success story on an unprecedented scale, 
      involving more than half a dozen nations and hundreds of millions of 
      people.

      Meanwhile, there has been a growth of awareness of human rights.  
      Crude power can never subdue mankind's basic desire for freedom, truth 
      and democracy, which are our fundamental right. People simply don't 
      like a person or a system that bullies, cheats and lies. These 
      activities are essentially opposed to the human spirit.

      All these encouraging signs reflect a renewed appreciation of the 
      benefits of basic human values. Because of the lessons we have begun 
      to learn, the next century will be friendlier, more harmonious, and 
      less harmful. Compassion, the seeds of peace, will be able to 
      flourish. At the same time, I believe that every individual has a 
      responsibility to help guide our global family in the right direction.  
      Good wishes alone are not enough, we each have to assume 
      responsibility.

      I hope and pray that in the days ahead, each of us will do all we can  
      to see that the goal of creating a happier, more harmonious and 
      healthier world is achieved.
