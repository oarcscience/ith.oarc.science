<p>THE Master remained in Cravasti for some time; then he left, to return to Rajagriha where King Vimbasara awaited him. He had stopped to rest in a village that was about halfway, when he saw seven men approaching. He recognized them. Six were relatives, and they were among the wealthiest and most powerful of the Sakyas. Their names were Anuruddha, Bhadrika, Bhrigu, Kimbala, Devadatta and Ananda. The seventh was a barber named Upali.</p>  
<p>Anuruddha, one day had said to himself that it was a disgrace that none of the Sakyas had seen fit to follow the Buddha. He decided to set a good example, and as there was no reason for hiding his intention, he mentioned it first to Bhadrika, who was his best friend. Bhadrika approved of his decision, and after giving it some thought, resolved to do likewise. These two then won over Ananda, Bhrigu, Kimbala and Devadatta, by convincing them that there was no higher calling than that of a monk.</p>  
<p>The six princes then set out to join the Buddha.</p>  
<p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> They had hardly left Kapilavastu when Ananda, glancing at Bhadrika, exclaimed:</p>  
<p>"How now, Bhadrika! You would lead a life of holiness, and you keep all your jewels?"</p>  
<p>Bhadrika blushed; but then he saw that Ananda was also wearing his jewelry, and he laughingly replied:</p>  
<p>"Look at yourself, Ananda."</p>  
<p>It was now Ananda's turn to blush.</p>  
<p>Whereupon they all looked at one another, and they found they were still wearing their jewels. It made them feel ashamed; they lowered their eyes, and were walking along the road in silence when they met the barber Upali.</p>  
<p>"Barber," said Ananda, "take my jewels; I give them to you."</p>  
<p>"And take mine," said Bhadrika.</p>  
<p>The others also handed their jewels to Upali. He was at a loss for an answer. Why should these princes, who had never seen him before, give him such presents? Should he accept them? Should he refuse?</p>  
<p>Anuruddha understood the barber's hesitation. He said to him:</p>  
<p>"Do not be afraid to accept these jewels. We are on our way to join the great hermit who was born to the Sakyas, we are on our way to join Siddhartha, who has become the Buddha. He will instruct</p>  
<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>us in the knowledge, and we shall submit to his rule."</p>  
<p>"Princes," asked the barber, "are you going to become monks?"</p>  
<p>"Yes," they answered.</p>  
<p>He then took the jewels and started for the city. But, suddenly, he thought, "I am acting like a fool. Who will ever believe that princes thrust these riches upon me? I shall be taken for a thief, or perhaps for an assassin. The least that can happen to me is that I shall incur the deep displeasure of the Sakyas. I shall not keep the jewels." He hung them on a tree that stood beside the road. And he thought, "Those princes are setting a noble example. They had the courage to leave their palaces; do I, who am nothing, lack the courage to leave my shop? No. I shall follow them. I, too, shall see the Buddha, and may he receive me into the community!"</p>  
<p>He followed the princes at a distance. He was shy about joining them. Bhadrika happened to turn around. He saw Upali; he called him.</p>  
<p>"Barber, why did you throw away our jewels?" he asked.</p>  
<p>"I, too, want to become a monk," replied the barber.</p>  
<p>"Then walk with us," said Bhadrika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p>But Upali still hung back. Anuruddha said to him:</p>  
<p>"Walk beside us, barber. Monks make no distinctions, except for age and for virtue. When we stand before the Buddha, you must even be the first to address him, and the first to ask him to receive you into the community. For by yielding to you, the princes will show that they have put aside their Sakya pride."</p>  
<p>They continued on their way. Suddenly, a hawk swooped down on Devadatta's head and carried off a diamond he had been wearing in his hair. This exposed his vanity, and it made the princes smile. Devadatta, now, had not a single jewel left, but his companions, in their hearts, still questioned the sincerity of his faith.</p>
