### 14. Gopa's Great Virtue

PRESENTLY the women of the palace came to pay homage to the Master.
Gopa, alone,

was missing. The king evinced his surprise.

"I asked her to come with us," said Mahaprajapati. "'I shall not go with
you,' she answered. 'I may be wanting in virtue; I may not deserve to
see my husband. If 1 have done nothing wrong, he will come to me of his
own accord, and I shall then show him the respect that is his due.'"

The Master left his seat and went to Gopa's apartments. She had
discarded her costly raiment and her soft veils; she had flung aside her
bracelets and her necklaces; she was wearing a reddish-colored robe,
made of some coarse material. At the sight of her thus attired, he
smiled with happiness. She fell at his feet and worshipped him.

"You see," said she, "I wanted to dress as you are dressed; I wanted to
know about your life in order to live as you live. You eat but once a
day, and I eat but once a day. You gave up sleeping in a bed; look
around: no bed will you see, for here is the bench on which I sleep. And
from now on

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I shall have done
with sweet perfumes, and no longer shall I put flowers in my hair."

"I was aware of your great virtue, Gopa," replied the Master. "It has
not failed you, and I praise you for it. How many women are there in
this world who would have had the courage to do as you did?"

And seating himself, he spoke these words:

"Women are not to be trusted. For one who is wise and good, more than a
thousand can be found who are foolish and wicked. Woman is more
mysterious than the path of a fish through the water; she is as fierce
as a robber, and like the robber, she is deceitful; she will rarely tell
the truth, for to her a lie is like the truth and the truth like a lie.
Often have I told my disciples to avoid women. It displeases me even to
have them speak to them. Yet you, Gopa, are not false; I believe in your
virtue. Virtue is a flower not easily found; a woman must have clear
eyes in order to see it; she must have pure hands in order to gather it
Mara hides his pointed arrows under flowers oh, how many women love
treacherous flower, flowers that inflict wounds which never heal!
Unhappy women! The body is but foam and they know it not. They cling to
this world, then the day comes when King Death claims them for his own.
The body is less substantial than a mirage: who

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

knows that will break Mara's flowered arrows, who knows that will never
meet King Death. Death carries away the woman who heedlessly gathers
flowers, even as the torrent, swollen by the storm, carries away the
drowsy village. Gather flowers, O woman, take joy in their colors, drink
in their perfume; Death lies in wait for you, and before you are
satisfied, you will be his. Consider the bee: it goes from flower to
flower, and, harming no one, simply takes the nectar from which honey is
made."
