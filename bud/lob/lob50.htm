<p>ONE day, he returned to the country of Rajagriha.</p>  
<p>In a field, not far from the city, he came upon a brahman named Bharadvaja. It was the harvest season, and the brahman and his servants were joyously celebrating. They were laughing and singing as the Master went by. He held out his alms-bowl, and those who recognized him, greeted him and made him many friendly offerings. This displeased Bharadvaja. He went up to the Master, and he said to him in a loud voice:</p>  
<p>"Monk, tarry not in our midst; you set an evil example. We work, we that are here, and with watchful eyes, we observe the changes of seasons. When it is time to plow, my servants plow; when it is time to sow, they sow; and I plow and sow with them. Then the day comes when we harvest the fruit of our labor. We provide our own food, and when it is stored away, we have good reason to rest and play. While you, you roam the streets and walk the roads, and the only trouble you deign to take is to hold out a bowl to those you</p>  
<p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>meet. It would be better far for you to work; it would be better far to plow and sow."</p>  
<p>The Master smiled and answered:</p>  
<p>"Friend, like you I plow and sow, and when my work is done, I eat."</p>  
<p>"You plow? You sow?" said Bharadvaja. "How can I believe that? Where are your cattle? Where is your grain? Where is your plow?"</p>  
<p>The Master said:</p>  
<p>"Purity of understanding, that is the glorious seed I sow. Works of holiness are the rain that falls upon the fertile earth where the seed sprouts and ripens. And mine is a mighty plow: it has wisdom for its plowshare, the law for its handles, and an active faith is the powerful bullock yoked to its pole. Desire is uprooted like weeds in the fields I plow, and I gather in the richest of harvests, nirvana."</p>  
<p>He continued on his way. But the brahman Bharadvaja followed him; he would now hear the sacred word.</p>  
<p>They entered the city. On the public square, a large crowd was watching a troop of dancers. The daughter of the leader -was attracting particular attention. Such grace and beauty had seldom been seen, and, whenever she appeared, those who were not master of their passions burned with the</p>  
<p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></A></p>  
<p>desire to possess her. Her name was Kuvalaya.</p>  
<p>She had just finished dancing. Ardent eyes were still fastened upon her. She was aware of her power, and full of pride and audacity, she shouted 'to the crowd:</p>  
<p>"Admire me, my lords! In all Rajagriha is there one who can surpass Kuvalaya in beauty, are there any who can even equal her?"</p>  
<p>"Yes, woman," replied the brahman Bharadvaja. "What is your beauty when compared with the beauty of the Master?"</p>  
<p>"I would see this Master whose beauty you praise," said Kuvalaya; "lead me to him."</p>  
<p>"Here he is," said the Blessed One.</p>  
<p>And he came forward.</p>  
<p>The dancer stared at him.</p>  
<p>"You are beautiful," she said at last. "I shall dance for you."</p>  
<p>Kuvalaya danced. The dance began slowly. She had wrapped all her veils about her, even covering&nbsp; her face, and the beauty once so boldly flaunted was now only a dim promise. She was like the moon, hiding behind soft clouds from the gaze of night. A cloud flew away; a faint ray escaped through the rift. The dance became more rapid; one by one the veils fell away, and the queen of the stars appeared in all her glory. Faster and faster she</p>  
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>  
<p>whirled; suddenly, a blinding light flashed in her eyes, and she stopped. She was naked. The crowd gasped and surged forward.</p>  
<p>"Unhappy woman!" said the Buddha.</p>  
<p>He looked at her intently. Whereupon Kuvalaya's cheeks became sunken, her forehead wrinkled and her eyes grew dull. Only a few ugly teeth were left in her mouth; only a few thin strands of grey hair still hung from her head, and she was stooped as with age. The Blessed One had punished her as he had once punished Mara's daughters when they had tried to tempt him; he had changed the beautiful dancer into a shrivelled old woman.</p>  
<p>She sighed:</p>  
<p>"Master, I know the great wrong I have done. An ephemeral beauty had made me vain. You taught me a bitter lesson, but I feel that some day I shall be happy to have received it. Let me learn the sacred truths; then may I be released for ever from this body that, even when it was the delight of men, was nothing but a loathsome corpse."</p>  
<p>The Master granted Kuvalaya's request, and she became one of the most devout of the Buddha's faithful followers.</p>
