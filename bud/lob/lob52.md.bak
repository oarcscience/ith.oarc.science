### 10. Devadatta Expelled from the Community

THE monk Devadatta was possessed of an arrogant nature. He was impatient
of any restraint. He aspired to supplant the Buddha, but the monks, he
knew, would not join him in an open revolt. For that he needed the
support of some king or prince.

"King Vimbasara is an old man," he said to himself, one day; "Prince
Ajatasatru, who is young and brave, is eager to succeed him to the
throne. I could advise the prince to his advantage, and, in return, he
could help me to become the head of the community."

He went to see Ajatasatru. He addressed him in flattering terms; he
praised his strength, his courage, his beauty.

"Oh, if you were king," said he, "what glory would come to Rajagriha!
You would conquer the neighboring states; all the sovereigns of the
world would pay you homage: you would be the omnipotent master, and you
would be worshipped like a God."

With such words as these, Devadatta won Ajatasatru's

confidence. He received many precious gifts, and he became still more
arrogant.

Maudgalyayana noticed Devadatta's frequent visits to the prince. He
decided to warn the Blessed One.

"My Lord," he began, "Devadatta is very friendly with Prince
Ajatasatru."

The Blessed One interrupted him.

"Let Devadatta do as he pleases; we shall soon know the truth. I am
aware that Ajatasatru pays him homage; it does not advance him a single
step in the path of virtue. Let Devadatta glory in his arrogance! It
will be his ruin. As the banana-tree and the bamboo-tree bear fruit only
to die, so will the honors Devadatta is receiving simply hasten his
downfall."

Devadatta soon reached the height of vanity. He could not abide the
Buddha's grandeur, and, one day, he made bold to say to him:

"Master, you are now well along in years; it is a great hardship for you
to rule the monks; you should retire. Meditate in peace upon the sublime
law you have discovered, and the community let me take charge of."

The Master smiled quizzically.

"Be not concerned about me, Devadatta; you are too kind. I shall know
when it is time to retire. For the present, I shall stay in charge of
the community.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Besides, when the
time does come, I shall not give it even to Sariputra or Maudgalyayana,
those two great minds that are like blazing torches, and you want it,
Devadatta, you who have such a mediocre intelligence, you who shed even
less light than a night-lamp!"

Devadatta bowed respectfully before the Master, but he could not hide
the fire of anger in his eyes.

The Master then sent for learned Sariputra.

"Sariputra," said he, "go through the city of Rajagriha and cry in a
loud voice: 'Beware of Devadatta! He has strayed from the path of
righteousness. The Buddha is not responsible for his words or for his
actions; the law no longer inspires him, the community no longer
interests him. Henceforth, Devadatta speaks only for himself.'"

It grieved Sariputra to have such a painful mission to perform; however,
he understood the Master's reasons, and he went through the city crying
Devadatta's shame. The inhabitants stopped to listen, and some thought,
"The monks envy Devadatta his friendship for Prince Ajatasatru." But the
others said, "Devadatta must have committed a serious offense, for the
Blessed One thus publicly to denounce him."
