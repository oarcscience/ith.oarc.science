<p>MONTHS passed. Then, one day, the queen knew that the time was approaching for her son to be born. She went to King Suddhodana, and she said to him:</p>  
<p>"My lord, I would wander through the happy gardens. Birds are singing in the trees, and the air is bright with flower-dust. I would wander through the happy gardens."</p>  
<p>"But it will weary you, O queen," replied Suddhodana. "Are you not afraid?"</p>  
<p>"The innocent being that I carry in my womb must be born amid the innocence of budding flowers. No, I will go, O master, I will go into the flower-gardens."</p>  
<p>The king yielded to Maya's wish. He said to his servants:</p>  
<p>"Go into the gardens and deck them out in silver and in gold. Drape the trees with precious hangings. Let everything be magnificent, for the queen will pass."</p>  
<p>Then he addressed Maya:</p>  
<p>"Array yourself, to-day, in great splendor, O</p>  
<p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Maya. Ride in a gorgeous palanquin; let your most beautiful maidens carry you. Order your servants to use rare perfumes; have them wear ropes of pearls and bracelets of precious stones; have them carry lutes and drums and flutes, and sing sweet songs that would delight the Gods themselves."</p>  
<p>Suddhodana was obeyed, and when the queen reached the palace-gates the guards greeted her with joyous cries. Bells peeled gaily, peacocks spread their gorgeous tail-feathers, and the song of swans throbbed in the air.</p>  
<p>They came to a wood where the trees were in bloom, and Maya ordered them to set down the palanquin. She stepped out and began wandering about, aimlessly. She was happy. And behold! she found a rare tree, the branches drooping under their burden of blossoms. She went up to it; gracefully extending her hand, she drew down a branch. Suddenly, she stood very still. She smiled, and the maidens who were near her received a lovely child into their arms.</p>  
<p>At that same moment all that was alive in the world trembled with joy. The earth quivered. Songs and the patter of dancing feet echoed in the sky. Trees of all seasons burst into flower, and ripe fruit hung from the branches. A pure, serene light appeared in the sky. The sick were rid of their suffering. The hungry were satisfied. Those to</p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A></p>  
<p>whom wine had played false became sober. Madmen recovered their reason, the weak their strength, the poor their wealth. Prisons opened their gates. The wicked were cleansed of all evil.</p>  
<p>One of Maya's maidens hastened to King Suddhodana and joyously exclaimed:</p>  
<p>"My lord, my lord, a son is born to you, a son who will bring great glory to your house!"</p>  
<p>He was speechless. But his face was radiant with joy, and he knew great happiness.</p>  
<p>Presently he summoned all the Sakyas, and he commanded them to accompany him into the garden where the child had been born. They obeyed, and, with a host of brahmans in attendance, they formed a noble retinue as they gravely followed the king.</p>  
<p>When he came near the child, the king made a deep obeisance, and he said:</p>  
<p>"Do you bow as I bow before the prince, to whom I give the name Siddhartha."</p>  
<p>They all bowed, and the brahmans, inspired by the Gods, then sang:</p>  
<p>"All creatures are happy, and they are no longer rough, those roads travelled by men, for he is born, he who gives happiness: he will bring happiness into the world. In the darkness a great light has dawned, the sun and the moon are like dying embers, for he is born, he who gives light: he will</p>  
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>bring light into the world. The blind see, the deaf hear, the foolish have recovered their reason, for he is born, he who restores sight, and restores hearing, and restores the mind: he will bring sight, he will bring hearing, he will bring reason into the world. Perfumed zephyrs ease the suffering of mankind, for he is born, he who heals: he will bring health into the world. Flames are no longer pitiless, the flow of rivers has been stayed, the earth has trembled gently: he will be the one to see the truth."</p>
