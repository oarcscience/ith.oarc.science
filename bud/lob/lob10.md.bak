### 8. Siddhartha Leads a Life of Pleasure

PRINCE Siddhartha lived happily with his wife, the princess. And the
king, whose love for his son now verged on adoration, took infinite care
to spare him the sight of anything that might distress him. He built
three magnificent palaces for him: one for the winter, one for the
summer, and the third for the rainy season; and these he was forbidden
ever to leave, to wander over the broad face of the earth.

In his palaces, white as autumn clouds and bright as the celestial
chariots of the Gods and Goddesses, the prince drained the cup of
pleasure. He led a life of voluptuous ease; he spent languid hours
listening to music played by the princess and her maidens, and when
beautiful, smiling dancers appeared before him and performed to the
sound of golden kettle-drums, with delight he watched them as they
swayed with a grace and loveliness rare even among the happy Apsarases.

Women cast furtive glances at him: their eyes boldly offered or archly
pleaded, and their drooping lashes were a promise of ineffable delight.

games amused him, their charms held him in thrall, and he was content to
remain in these palaces so full of their laughter and song. For he knew
nothing of old age and sickness; he knew nothing of death.

Suddhodana rejoiced at the life his son was leading, though his own
conduct he judged with the utmost severity. He strove to keep his soul
serene and pure; he refrained from doing evil, and he lavished gifts on
those who were virtuous. He never yielded to indolence or pleasure; he
was never burned by the poison of avarice. As wild horses are made to
bear the yoke, even so did he subdue his passions, and in virtue he
surpassed his kinsmen and his friends. The knowledge he acquired he
placed at the service of his fellow-men, and he only studied those
subjects that were useful to all. He not only sought the welfare of his
own people but he also wanted the whole world to be happy. He purified
his body with the water from the sacred ponds, and he purified his soul
with the holy water of virtue. He never uttered a word that was pleasant
and yet a lie; the truths he spoke never gave offense or pain. He tried
to be just, and it was by honesty, not by force, that he defeated the
pride of his enemies. He did not strike, he did not even look with anger
upon those who deserved the penalty of death; instead, he gave them
useful advice, and then their freedom.

The king was an example to all his subjects, and

the happiest and most virtuous of kingdoms.

Then beautiful Gopa bore the prince a son, and he was given the name of
Rahula. King Suddhodana was happy to see his family prosper, and he was
as proud of the birth of his grandson as he had been of the birth of his
son.

He continued in the path of virtue, he lived almost like a hermit, and
his actions were saintly; yet he kept urging on his beloved son to new
pleasures, so great was his fear to see him leave the palace and the
city and seek the austere refuge of the holy forests.
