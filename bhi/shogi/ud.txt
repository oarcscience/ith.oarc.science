Dear Fellow-workers in the Cause of &Baha'u'llah, 
     It is with words of regret and disappointment that I desire to open 
this letter because of my inability, in view of my manifold and pressing 
duties, to respond individually and in writing to the many messages of 
love and sympathy and of hope that you have so affectionately sent me 
since our Beloved's passing from this World.  I am sure I am voicing 
the sentiments of the bereaved ladies of the Household when I say that 
however desirous we may be to correspond separately with every one 
of you, the grave responsibilities and manifold duties now devolved 
upon us make it regrettably impossible to express in written messages 
to every friend what we constantly feel in our hearts, and pray for 
when visiting His sacred Shrine.  
     At this grave and momentous period through which the Cause of 
God in conformity with the Divine Wisdom is passing, it is the sacred 
duty of every one of us to endeavour to realise the full significance of 
this Hour of Transition, and then to make a supreme resolve to arise 
steadfastly for the fulfilment of our sacred obligations.  
     Great as is the love and paternal care which our beloved Master is 
extending to us from on High, and unique as is the Spirit that 
animates today His servants in the world, yet a great deal will depend 
upon the character and efforts of His loved ones on whom now rests the 
responsibility of carrying on His work gloriously after Him.  How 
great is the need at this moment when the promised outpourings of His 
grace are ready to be extended to every soul, for us all to form a broad 
vision of the mission of the Cause to mankind, and to do all in our 
power to spread it throughout the world.  The eyes of the world, now 
that the sublime Personality of the Master has been removed from this 
visible plane, are turned with eager anticipation to us who are named 
after His name, and on whom rests primarily the responsibility to keep 
burning the torch that He has lit in this world.  How keenly I feel at 
this challenging hour in the history of the Cause the need for a firm 
and definite determination to subordinate all our personal likings, our 
local interests, to the interests and requirements of the Cause of God!  
Now is the time to set aside, nay, to forget altogether, minor 
considerations regarding our internal relationships, and to present a 
solid united front to the world animated by no other desire but to serve 
and propagate His Cause.  
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  (See para. 3, page xvii.)  
 
+P4 
     It is my firm conviction which I now express with all sincerity and 
candour, that the dignity and unity of the Cause urgently demands--
particularly throughout the American continent--that the friends 
should in their words and conduct emphasise and give absolute 
prominence to the constructive dynamic principles of &Baha'u'llah, 
rather than attach undue importance to His negative Teachings.  With 
hearts cleansed from the least trace of suspicion and filled with hope 
and faith in what the spirit of love can achieve, we must one and all 
endeavour at this moment to forget past impressions, and with absolute 
goodwill and genuine co-operation unite in deepening and diffusing 
the spirit of love and service that the Cause has thus far so remarkably 
shown to the world.  To this attitude of goodwill, of forebearance and 
genuine kindness to all, must be added, however, constant but 
unprovocative vigilance, lest unrestricted association with the peoples 
of the world should enable the very few who have been definitely 
pronounced by the Master as injurious to the body of the Cause, to 
make a breach in the Movement.  Not until, however, an unmistakable 
evidence should appear, manifestly revealing the evil motives of a 
certain individual or groups of individuals, is it advisable to make the 
matter public; for an untimely declaration that shall give rise to open 
differences among the friends is far more detrimental than forbearing 
still further with those who are suspected of evil intentions.  As the 
Master so fully and consistently did throughout His lifetime, we must 
all make a supreme effort to pour out a genuine spirit of kindness and 
hopeful love to peoples of various creeds and classes, and must abstain 
from all provocative language that may impede the effect of what true 
and continued kindness can produce.  
     Does not &Abdu'l-Baha wish us, as He looks down upon us with 
loving expectation from His glorious Station, to obliterate as much as 
possible all traces of censure, of conflicting discussions, of cooling 
remarks, of petty unnecessary observations that impede the onward 
march of the Cause, that damp the zeal of the firm believer and detract 
from the sublimity of the &Baha'i Cause in the eyes of the inquirer?  In 
order, however, to insure fair and quick and vigorous action whenever 
such an evil activity is revealed and has been carefully ascertained, the 
best and only means would appear to be, for the careful observer, once 
he is assured of such an evil action, and has grown hopeless of the 
attitude of kindness and forbearance, to report it quietly to the Spiritual 
Assembly representative of the friends in that locality and submit the 
case to their earnest and full consideration.  Should the majority of the 
 
+P5 
members of that Assembly be conscientiously convinced of the case--
and this being a national issue affecting the body of the friends in 
America--it should, only through the intermediary of that Assembly, 
be cautiously communicated to that greater body representing all the 
Assemblies in America, which will in its turn obtain all the available 
data from the local Assembly in question, study carefully the situation 
and reserve for itself the ultimate decision.  It may, if it decides so, refer 
to the Holy Land for further consideration and consultation.  
     This clearly places heavy responsibilities on the local as well as 
national Assemblies, which in the course of time will evolve, with the 
Master's power and guidance, into the local and national Houses of 
Justice.  Hence the vital necessity of having a local Spiritual Assembly 
in every locality where the number of adult declared believers exceeds 
nine, and of making provision for the indirect election of a Body that 
shall adequately represent the interests of all the friends and Assemblies 
throughout the American Continent.  
     A perusal of some of the words of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha on 
the duties and functions of the Spiritual Assemblies in every land 
(later to be designated as the local Houses of Justice), emphatically 
reveals the sacredness of their nature, the wide scope of their activity, 
and the grave responsibility which rests upon them.  
     Addressing the members of the Spiritual Assembly in Chicago, the 
Master reveals the following:--"Whenever ye enter the council-chamber, 
recite this prayer with a heart throbbing with the love of God 
and a tongue purified from all but His remembrance, that the All-powerful 
may graciously aid you to achieve supreme victory:--`O 
God, my God!  We are servants of Thine that have turned with 
devotion to Thy Holy Face, that have detached ourselves from all 
beside Thee in this glorious Day.  We have gathered in this spiritual 
assembly, united in our views and thoughts, with our purposes 
harmonised to exalt Thy Word amidst mankind.  O Lord, our God!  
Make us the signs of Thy Divine Guidance, the Standards of Thy 
exalted Faith amongst men, servants to Thy mighty Covenant.  O 
Thou our Lord Most High!  Manifestations of Thy Divine Unity in 
Thine &Abha Kingdom, and resplendent stars shining upon all regions.  
Lord!  Aid us to become seas surging with the billows of Thy wondrous 
Grace, streams flowing from Thy all-glorious Heights, goodly fruits 
upon the Tree of Thy heavenly Cause, trees waving through the 
breezes of Thy Bounty in Thy celestial Vineyard.  O God!  Make our 
souls dependent upon the Verses of Thy Divine Unity, our hearts 
 
+P6 
cheered with the outpourings of Thy Grace, that we may unite even 
as the waves of one sea and become merged together as the rays of 
Thine effulgent Light; that our thoughts, our views, our feelings may 
become as one reality, manifesting the spirit of union throughout the 
world.  Thou art the Gracious, the Bountiful, the Bestower, the 
Almighty, the Merciful, the Compassionate.'"  
     In the Most Holy Book is revealed:--"The Lord hath ordained 
that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather 
counsellors to the number of &Baha, and should it exceed this number 
it does not matter.  It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the 
Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians 
appointed of God for all that dwell on earth.  It is incumbent upon 
them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the 
servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, 
and to choose that which is meet and seemly.  Thus hath the Lord your 
God commanded you.  Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly 
revealed in His Tablet.  Fear God, O ye that perceive."  
     Furthermore, &Abdu'l-Baha reveals the following:--"It is 
incumbent upon every one not to take any step without consulting the 
Spiritual Assembly, and they must assuredly obey with heart and soul 
its bidding and be submissive unto it, that things may be properly 
ordered and well arranged.  Otherwise every person will act 
independently and after his own judgment, will follow his own desire, 
and do harm to the Cause."  
     "The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity 
of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, 
attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst 
His loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude 
to His exalted Threshold.  Should they be graciously aided to acquire 
these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of &Baha shall be 
vouchsafed to them.  In this day, assemblies of consultation are of the 
greatest importance and a vital necessity.  Obedience unto them is 
essential and obligatory.  The members thereof must take counsel 
together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may 
arise.  This can be attained when every member expresseth with 
absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument.  
Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until 
matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed.  The shining 
spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions.  
If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously well and good; 
 
+P7 
but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority 
of voices must prevail."  
     Enumerating the obligations incumbent upon the members of 
consulting councils, the Beloved reveals the following:--"The first 
condition is absolute love and harmony amongst the members of the 
assembly.  They must be wholly free from estrangement and must 
manifest in themselves the Unity of God, for they are the waves of one 
sea, the drops of one river, the stars of one heaven, the rays of one sun, 
the trees of one orchard, the flowers of one garden.  Should harmony of 
thought and absolute unity be non-existent, that gathering shall be 
dispersed and that assembly be brought to naught.  The second 
condition:--They must when coming together turn their faces to the 
Kingdom on High and ask aid from the Realm of Glory.  They must 
then proceed with the utmost devotion, courtesy, dignity, care and 
moderation to express their views.  They must in every matter search 
out the truth and not insist upon their own opinion, for stubbornness 
and persistence in one's views will lead ultimately to discord and 
wrangling and the truth will remain hidden.  The honoured members 
must with all freedom express their own thoughts, and it is in no wise 
permissible for one to belittle the thought of another, nay, he must with 
moderation set forth the truth, and should differences of opinion arise 
a majority of voices must prevail, and all must obey and submit to the 
majority.  It is again not permitted that any one of the honoured 
members object to or censure, whether in or out of the meeting, any 
decision arrived at previously, though that decision be not right, for 
such criticism would prevent any decision from being enforced.  In 
short, whatsoever thing is arranged in harmony and with love and 
purity of motive, its result is light, and should the least trace of 
estrangement prevail the result shall be darkness upon darkness....  If 
this be so regarded, that Assembly shall be of God, but otherwise it 
shall lead to coolness and alienation that proceed from the Evil One.  
Discussions must all be confined to spiritual matters that pertain to the 
training of souls, the instruction of children, the relief of the poor, the 
help of the feeble throughout all classes in the world, kindness to all 
peoples, the diffusion of the fragrances of God and the exaltation of 
His Holy Word.  Should they endeavour to fulfil these conditions the 
Grace of the Holy Spirit shall be vouchsafed unto them, and that 
assembly shall become the centre of the Divine blessings, the hosts of 
Divine confirmation shall come to their aid, and they shall day by day 
receive a new effusion of Spirit."  
 
+P8 
     So great is the importance and so supreme is the authority of these 
assemblies that once &Abdu'l-Baha after having Himself and in His 
own handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the 
&Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by &Shaykh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from 
Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation 
to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before 
publication their approval and consent.  These are His very words in 
that Tablet:--"His honour, &Shaykh &Faraju'llah, has here rendered 
into Arabic with greatest care the &Ishraqat and yet I have told him that 
he must submit his version to the Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I 
have conditioned its publication upon the approval of the above-named 
Assembly.  This is so that things may be arranged in an orderly 
manner, for should it not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet 
and print and circulate it on his own account.  Even a non-believer 
might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder.  If 
it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual 
Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a non-believer 
will have no recognition whatever."  
     This is indeed a clear indication of the Master's express desire that 
nothing whatever should be given to the public by any individual 
among the friends, unless fully considered and approved by the 
Spiritual Assembly in his locality; and if this (as is undoubtedly the 
case) is a matter that pertains to the general interest of the Cause in 
that land, then it is incumbent upon the Spiritual Assembly to submit 
it to the consideration and approval of the national body representing 
all the various local assemblies.  Not only with regard to publication, 
but all matters without any exception whatsoever, regarding the 
interests of the Cause in that locality, individually or collectively, 
should be referred exclusively to the Spiritual Assembly in that 
locality, which shall decide upon it, unless it be a matter of national 
interest, in which case it shall be referred to the national body.  With 
this national body also will rest the decision whether a given question 
is of local or national interest.  (By national affairs is not meant matters 
that are political in their character, for the friends of God the world 
over are strictly forbidden to meddle with political affairs in any way 
whatever, but rather things that affect the spiritual activities of the 
body of the friends in that land).  
     Full harmony, however, as well as co-operation among the various 
local assemblies and the members themselves, and particularly between 
each assembly and the national body, is of the utmost importance, for 
upon it depends the unity of the Cause of God, the solidarity of the 
 
+P9 
friends, the full, speedy and efficient working of the spiritual activities 
of His loved ones.  
     Large issues in such spiritual activities that affect the Cause in 
general in that land, such as the management of the "Star of the West" 
and any periodical which the National Body may decide to be a &Baha'i 
organ, the matter of publication, or reprinting &Baha'i literature and its 
distribution among the various assemblies, the means whereby the 
teaching campaign may be stimulated and maintained, the work of 
the &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, the racial question in relation to the Cause, 
the matter of receiving Orientals and associating with them, the care 
and maintenance of the precious film exhibiting a phase of the Master's 
sojourn in the United States of America as well as the original matrix 
and the records of His voice, and various other national spiritual 
activities, far from being under the exclusive jurisdiction of any local 
assembly or group of friends, must each be minutely and fully directed 
by a special board, elected by the National Body, constituted as a 
committee thereof, responsible to it and upon which the National Body 
shall exercise constant and general supervision.  
     The time is indeed ripe for the manifold activities, wherein the 
servants and handmaidens of &Baha'u'llah are so devoutly and earnestly 
engaged, to be harmonised and conducted with unity, co-operation and 
efficiency, that the effect of such a combined and systematised effort, 
through which an All-powerful Spirit is steadily pouring, may 
transcend every other achievement of the past, however glorious it has 
been, and may stand, now that, to the eyes of the outside world the 
glorious Person of the Master is no more, a convincing testimony of 
the potency of His everliving Spirit.  
                                    Your brother and co-worker in His Cause,

To my spiritual brethren and sisters in Great Britain.  
Care of the members of the Spiritual Council.+F1  
 
My dearest brethren and sisters in the faith of God!  
     May I at the very outset of this, my very first letter to you, convey 
 
+F1 Dr. Esselmont+ and E. T. Hall+ were "chosen" to represent Bournemouth 
+F1 and Manchester respectively and they met with seven others representing  
+F1 "The London Groups" to form the first "All-England &Baha'i Council" which 
+F1 met at the London home of Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper+ 6 June, 1922.  Mr. G. 
+F1 P. Simpson+ was elected Chairman.  
 
+P10 
to your hearts in words, however inadequate but assuredly deeply felt 
and sincere, a measure of my burning impatience, during my days of 
retirement, to return speedily and join hands with you in the great 
work of consolidation that awaits every earnest believer in the Cause 
of &Baha'u'llah.  
     Now that happily I feel myself restored to a position where I can 
take up with continuity and vigour the threads of my manifold duties, 
the bitterness of every disappointment felt, time and again, in the 
course of the past weary months at my feeling of unpreparedness, have 
been merged in the sweetness of the present hour, when I realise that 
spiritually and bodily I am better equipped to shoulder the responsibilities 
of the Cause.  The thought, so often comforting and 
sustaining, that in the counsels of my British co-workers of that land, 
I shall find spontaneous and undiminished support as well as wise and 
experienced assistance, is surely one of those forces which will hearten 
me in the midst of my future labours for the Cause.  
     That in every one of you our departed Master reposed His future 
and truest hopes for an able and convincing presentation of the Cause 
to the outside world, is abundantly revealed in His spoken and written 
words to you, as well as in His general references to the spirit of 
sincerity, of tenacity and devotion that animates His friends of that 
land.  
     The fierce tests that have raged over that island in the past; the calm 
and determination with which they have been so bravely faced and 
surmounted; the seeds of loving fellowship that the Beloved in person 
has more than once scattered in its soil; the rise, as its result, of a few 
but indeed capable, reliable, devoted and experienced followers and 
admirers of the Cause; the splendid and in many instances unique 
opportunities that are yours--these indeed are cherished thoughts for 
a land that illumines its past and should cheer its future.  
     I need hardly tell you how grateful and gratified I felt when I heard 
the news of the actual formation of a National Council whose main 
object is to guide, co-ordinate and harmonise the various activities of 
the friends, and when I learned of its satisfactory composition, its 
harmonious procedure and the splendid work it is achieving.  
     My earnest prayer is that the blessing of the Almighty may rest 
upon all its deliberations, that it may be divinely guided, inspired in 
its work, may smooth speedily and definitely all differences that may 
arise, may promote the all-important work of Teaching, may widen 
the sphere of its correspondence and exchange of news with the distant 
 
+P11 
parts of the &Baha'i world, may secure through its publications a 
dignified and proper presentation of the Cause to the enlightened 
public, and may in every other respect prove itself capable of distinct 
and worthy achievements.  
     With abiding affection and renewed vigour I shall now await the 
joyful tidings of the progress of the Cause and the extension of your 
activities, and will spare no effort in sharing with the faithful, here and 
in other lands, the welcome news of the progressive march of the Cause 
and the unceasing labours of our British friends for the Cause of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
                                                            Your brother,

To my beloved brethren and sisters throughout Great Britain.  
Care of the members of the &Baha'i Council.  
 
Dearest Friends, 
     I have during the last few days been waiting eagerly for the first 
written messages of my Western friends, sent to me since they have 
learned of my return to the Holy Land.  How great was the joy when 
dear Miss Rosenberg's+ letter--the very first that reached me from the 
West--was handed to me this evening, bearing the joyful news of 
the safety, the unity and the happiness of my British friends across the 
seas!  I read it and re-read it with particular pleasure and felt a thrill 
of delight at the welcome news of the harmonious and efficient 
functioning of your Spiritual Assembly.  
     I very sincerely hope that now that I have fully re-entered upon my 
task, I may be enabled to offer my humble share of assistance and 
advice in the all-important work which is now before you.  I fervently 
pray to God that the field of your activities may go on expanding, that 
your zeal and efforts may never diminish, and that new souls, active, 
able and sincere, may soon join with you in bearing aloft the Glorious 
Standard of the Cause in that land....  
     Ere long, an able and experienced teacher recently arrived from 
Persia will visit your shores and will, I trust, by his thorough 
 
+P12 
knowledge of the Cause, his wide experience, his fluency, his ardour 
and his devotion, reanimate every drooping spirit and inspire the 
active worker to make fresh and determined efforts for the deepening 
as well as the spreading of the Movement in those regions.  His 
forthcoming book, which he has patiently and laboriously written on 
the history of the Movement and which has been partly revised by the 
Pen of our Beloved Master is beyond any doubt the most graphic, the 
most reliable and comprehensive of its kind in all &Baha'i literature.  I 
am sure he will considerably enrich the store of your knowledge of the 
various phases and stages of the &Baha'i Movement.  Our beloved Dr. 
Esslemont will, I trust, be particularly pleased to meet him, as he is 
eminently qualified to offer him valuable help in connection with 
various aspects of his (Dr. Esslemont's) book.  I am enclosing various 
suggestions of Mr. Dreyfus-Barney and of Mr. Roy Wilhelm made 
by them at my request, during their last sojourn in the Holy Land.  I 
submit them to Dr. Esslemont's consideration as well as to that of the 
Spiritual Assembly.  I very deeply regret my inability to give the 
attention I desire to this admirable work of his, but will assuredly do 
all in my power to aid him in the final stages of his work.  I am certain 
however that the book as it now stands gives the finest and most 
effective presentation of the various aspects of the Cause to the mind 
of the Oriental as well as to that of the Westerner.  May it arouse a 
genuine and widespread interest in the Cause throughout the world.  
     I am now starting correspondence with every &Baha'i local centre 
throughout the East and will not fail to instruct and urge the believers 
everywhere to send directly through their respective spiritual local 
Assemblies the joyful tidings of the progress of the Cause, in the form 
of regular detailed reports, to the various assemblies of their spiritual 
brethren and sisters in the West.  England, I am confident, will 
regularly and consistently receive, directly, and indirectly through the 
"Star of the West" and the "&Baha'i News" of India, a large share of 
such tidings from Persia, Caucasus, Turkestan, India, Turkey and 
Mesopotamia, North Africa and Egypt.  It would be most gratifying 
and encouraging to all earnest workers for the Cause of &Baha'u'llah if 
every now and then a report on the spiritual activities of the friends in 
Great Britain, as well as articles on spiritual matters, would be 
submitted for publication to the above-mentioned periodicals.  It would, 
I feel very strongly, react very favourably on the Cause in England, 
and would serve to draw closer the ties that bind all spiritual centres 
together at the present time.  
 
+P13 
     I would be pleased and grateful if the members of the Spiritual 
Assembly would at any time inform me of their needs, wants and 
desires, their plans and activities, that I may through my prayers and 
brotherly assistance contribute, however meagrely, to the success of 
their glorious mission in this world.  
     To my extreme regret, I feel unable in view of my manifold and 
pressing duties, and owing to the extraordinary extension of the 
Movement in recent times, to correspond with the friends individually 
and express to them in writing what I always feel in the depth of my 
heart of brotherly affection and abiding gratitude for their love and 
sympathy for me.  I shall, however, await with eager expectation their 
individual letters and assure them of my readiness and wish to be of 
any service to them in their work for the Cause.  
     Remembering every one of you in these hallowed surroundings and 
fervently praying at the three sacred Thresholds that the blessings of 
the Lord may rest upon your individual and collective efforts, 
                                    I am as ever your devoted brother,

The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout 
London, Manchester and Bournemouth.  
Care of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.+F1  
 
Dearest brethren and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha, 
     The letters that I have recently received from the friends in London 
and Manchester have been to me a source of great hope and 
encouragement, and have served to strengthen the ties that bind me to 
my dearly-beloved friends in that great country.  
     I am much pleased and gratified to hear of the wonderful progress 
of the work of our able and devoted brother, &Jinab-i-'Avarih, and my 
earnest hope and prayer is that he may, by his zeal, patience, 
experience and knowledge, set ablaze the fire that the Master has 
kindled in the heart of that land.  
     The supreme necessity, and the urgent need of the Cause of God at 
present, is the unity of the friends, and their sustained and wholehearted

co-operation in their task of spreading the Divine Teachings 
throughout the world.  It is the sacred duty of all believers to have 
implicit confidence in, and support heartily, every decision passed by 
their Spiritual Assemblies, whether local or central; and the members 
of these Assemblies must, on their part, set aside their own inclinations, 
personal interests, likes and dislikes, and regard only the welfare of the 
Cause and the well-being of the friends.  This is surely the foundation 
which must be firmly laid in the hearts of all believers the world over, 
for upon this only can any constructive and permanent service be 
achieved, and the edifice of the Beloved's last instructions, as revealed 
in His Will and Testament, be raised and established.  
     The all-conquering Spirit of &Baha'u'llah cannot prove effective in 
this world of strife and turmoil, and cannot achieve its purpose for 
mankind, unless we, who are named after His Name, and who are the 
recipients of His Grace, endeavour, by our example, our daily life and 
our dealings with our fellow-men, to reveal that noble spirit of love and 
self-sacrifice of which the world stands in need at present.  
     I have been reading lately some of the oldest Tablets of &Abdu'l-Baha 
and am enclosing for your perusal the translation of various 
selections from His soul-stirring words, revealed some twenty-five 
years ago, during the darkest days of His incarceration in the prison 
city of &Akka.  You will realise as you read them the unshakable 
confidence of the Master in the future growth of the Movement, the 
significance of the Cause in this age, and the glorious privilege of the 
friends to labour for its spread in every land.  
     I am enclosing also my revised translation of the Hidden Words, 
both Persian and Arabic, a copy of which I have sent to the friends in 
the United States in response to their cable, requesting me to authorise 
circulation of my version among the friends in America.  
     I have recently received a message from our beloved brethren and 
sisters in Germany, who, in the midst of their sufferings and trials, 
yearn to receive a word of sympathy and comfort from their fellow-workers 
in France and England.  I am sure you will gladly respond to 
their request, and cheer them with the glad-tidings of the wonderful 
progress of the Cause in your land and elsewhere.  
     I am always looking forward to receiving your letters and hear from 
you personally in all matters pertaining to the Cause.  It is my earnest 
prayer whenever I visit the Sacred Shrines, that the friends in England 
may be always protected, guided and blessed in their work of service to 
the Cause, and may soon witness the fulfilment of the glorious promises 
 
+P15 
of the Master regarding the future of that land and the spiritual re-awakening 
of its people.  
                                    Your brother and fellow-worker,

24 February 1923 
 
Dear Spiritual Brother, 
     Your letter to Shoghi Effendi has been received and was read 
by him with keen delight and satisfaction for it bespoke of the 
new spirit of ardent devotion that has enkindled the hearts of the 
faithful followers of &Baha, and of their loyal and active 
endeavours in the path of service.  Should the friends continue 
in their labours of love and service their activities will yield 
glorious results and they shall witness the realisation of the 
promises of the Beloved regarding the spiritual achievements of 
the friends in that land.  
     Shoghi Effendi is highly gratified and encouraged to know 
that the friends have carried out so efficiently his directions 
regarding the establishment of National and local Spiritual 
Assemblies; and he feels confident that the co-ordinated and 
unified efforts of its members, blessed by the unfailing assistance 
and guidance of the Beloved Master, will mark the dawn of a 
new era of spiritual activity and enlightenment.  
     He is very pleased to know that you are faithfully working 
for peace and harmony amongst the friends; and he prays that 
you may be blessed in your endeavours and be inspired and 
guided to clear all misunderstandings that may arise; and may 
help bring about that spirit of unity which is so essential to the 
life and growth of the Cause.  There is no doubt that difficulties 
will always arise; but if met in the spirit of earnest and selfless 
devotion and purity of motive all problems will be solved and 
we shall emerge from every difficulty spiritually stronger and 
wiser.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes to extend to you his thanks for your 
giving him the report of the activities of the friends there.  He 
will soon write a letter to the Assembly based on their report.  He 
wishes you to rest assured that his thoughts and prayers are with 
you wishing you all success in your labours for the promulgation 
of the Blessed Cause.  
 
+P16 
     Although unable to write individual letters he will gladly 
welcome all letters that you will send him in the future...  
 
 
29 November 1923 
 
To the members of the English National Spiritual Assembly 
 
My dearly-beloved fellow-workers in the Vineyard of God!  
     I am in receipt of your letter dated Nov. 17th 1923, and forwarded 
to me by our active and devoted brother, Mr. Simpson.  I have read it 
with the utmost pleasure and satisfaction.  I feel happy and encouraged 
to learn that those few, yet earnest and promising, servants of 
&Baha'u'llah in that land are, despite the vicissitudes and obstacles that 
confront the rapid rise of the Movement, wholeheartedly striving and 
co-operating for the fulfilment of His divine Promise.  
     You, surely, have laid a firm foundation for the future development 
of the Cause in those regions, and my hope is that the National 
Assembly of Great Britain may, by full, frequent, and anxious 
consultation, protect the Cause, maintain and promote harmony 
amongst the friends, and initiate and execute ways and means for the 
diffusion of its spirit and the promotion of its principles.  
     I welcome with keen and genuine satisfaction the active participation 
of our beloved sister, Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper, in the affairs of the 
Cause, and feel confident that her wisdom, her experience, her 
influence, and her unparalleled opportunities for the service of the 
Movement will pave the way for the wholesome growth of the Cause 
in that land.  
     I am sure you all realise the seemingly unsurmountable difficulties 
in the way of individual correspondence with the ever-increasing 
multitude of &Baha'is throughout the world, and I need hardly tell you 
how tremendously difficult it is, and how reluctant I feel, to 
discriminate at all between the many letters of varying importance 
which I daily receive from almost every corner of the globe.  Realising 
however that direct and intimate individual correspondence, in some 
form or other, is most urgent and vital to the interests of the Cause, I 
am, I assure you, giving it these days again my careful and undivided 
attention, and pray God that to this problem may soon be found a 
satisfactory and feasible solution.  In the meantime, I wish to emphasise 
the fact that I eagerly await, and would welcome, and would assuredly 
have time to peruse, most carefully and in person, every individual 
 
+P17 
letter you may wish to send me, and my readiness and wish to attend, 
in the very best way I can, to every matter raised in those letters.  No 
written message, however unimportant, will first be opened and read 
by any one save myself.  
     Regarding the proposed conference on "Living Religions within the 
British Empire", I feel that such a great opportunity for the Movement 
should not be neglected, and I am glad to know that it has been seized 
by the members of the National Assembly, and is being closely 
examined by them.  I would welcome further particulars as to who has 
conceived the idea, under whose auspices it will be conducted, and 
whether it is being supported by government authorities, and what 
conditions are imposed on its proceedings.  I am discussing the matter 
with some of the &Baha'i representatives of India and America as to 
what friends would be most competent to represent the Cause at this 
conference.  I shall communicate on this subject with the National 
Assemblies of India and America, and will inform you immediately 
I receive definite information from them.  
     As to the raising of funds to provide for the expenses of the &Baha'i 
representatives, I am sure the friends in England will find in the 
National Assemblies of India and America and in myself ready and 
generous supporters of a step that will undoubtedly prove of immediate 
and universal value for the ultimate recognition of the Cause by the 
world.  
     It is my ardent prayer that we may all be inspired to adopt the most 
effective measures for the successful achievement of this great 
undertaking.  
     I was much impressed by the charm and force of Major Moore's 
article, published recently in T. P. Cassell's weekly, and I would much 
desire to know whether his action was spontaneous, or whether he was 
urged or requested by someone to write it.  I strongly urge the friends, 
and particularly the members of the National Assembly, to do all in 
their power to make of this able and highly-minded admirer of the 
Cause, a zealous and true &Baha'i.  I am looking forward with keen 
anticipation to his spiritual development and his taking a more active 
part in the affairs of the Cause.  
     I am enclosing for the friends recent translations of the wonderful 
prophetic utterances of &Baha'u'llah, and I trust you will find them of 
great value in your work of teaching and spreading the Cause.  
     Awaiting eagerly your letters, individually as well as collectively, 
                                    I am your brother, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
+P18 
9 December 1923 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Your short yet encouraging letter was gladly received by our 
dear Shoghi Effendi just yesterday evening.  He felt very pleased 
indeed with that spirit of hopefulness which your letter 
conveyed, and he eagerly hopes that in the days to come nothing 
will mar the brightness and optimism of his English brethren 
and sisters over in the West.  
     Your references to the commemoration meeting held in 
London, brought back with all its painful sadness recollections 
of that one night.  In a calm and quiet night, brightened by the 
silvery rays of the moon, gathered &Abdu'l-Baha's sorrow-stricken 
faithful ones, to commemorate the night of His last 
farewell.  On the cistern by the Tomb sat His fervent servants; 
below them flickered the dying lights of Haifa, and above head 
shown in full magnificence the star bespangled heavens.  It was 
in the mid-watches of such a night that with sorrow and fervour 
the servants turned unto their dear Master so near and yet so far 
away; and with a deep feeling of that bitter loss they supplicated 
help and guidance from their Lord.  A word or two from Shoghi 
Effendi made them feel the Master nigh, and made them realise 
as never before that it was only in following in His steps, and in 
living the life that He had, that we can prove our faithfulness to 
our Master's Cause.  It was indeed a night of meditation and 
prayer and we missed you all so much.  
     We are receiving encouraging news from almost everywhere, 
such as Italy, Germany, China and Australia; and as you will 
have them more fully in the circulars of the Spiritual Assembly, 
I had hardly need make mention of them here.  
     Shoghi Effendi's earnest hopes in England are very great, and 
I am sure that the sincere and true-hearted efforts of his fellow-workers, 
will spread the principles of this great Revelation as 
never before.  Hard though it be to get access to the more 
intellectual circles in England, he firmly believes that through 
persistence, the obstacles will be soon overcome and they, with 
their own accord, will welcome you in their midst, turning a 
sympathetic ear to all that you have to share with them.  May 
these high hopes be realised....  
 
+P19 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My beloved brother, 
     My deepest admiration for your indefatigable exertions for the 
success of the Cause.  I will always remember you in my prayers and 
await eagerly your personal letters.  I welcome any suggestions and 
further particulars regarding the conference on the Living Religions 
within the British Empire.  
                                    Your brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
6 January 1924 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letter of Dec. 23rd furnishing necessary information 
concerning the Conference on Religions arrived and made our 
dear Guardian highly pleased and delighted.  
     As he has quite recently written to the friends in England, he 
has instructed me to answer your letter and inform you that he 
has written and directed the National Spiritual Assembly of 
America to have a comprehensive article written by the ablest 
pen among the American friends--to be excellent both in style 
and in representation.  
     After this essay is written, it will be sent to our dear Shoghi 
Effendi who will send it to your N.S. Assembly for your perusal 
and consideration.  You will add your remarks and suggestions 
and return it to him for final approval.  
     Shoghi Effendi is also thinking of selecting someone among 
the Indian friends to represent India.  This Conference and a 
worthy and dignified representation of the Holy Cause therein, 
are under his serious consideration.  We hope that through his 
wise instruction and powerful prayers your activities in this 
respect will be crowned with glorious success and that it will be 
known to the public that the Cause is not a movement collateral 
with other movements such as the Brahma Somaj or &Ahmadi 
movements.  
     Here at the Holy Shrine of our Beloved we remember all the 
dear friends in England and supplicate humbly for their 
happiness.  
     Shoghi Effendi is sending you his love and affection together 
 
+P20 
with his deep appreciation towards your noble labours and 
sacrificial efforts in the service of the Holy Cause...  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear friend, 
     I enclose a copy of my recent letter to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of America regarding the Conference as well as copies of my 
recent translation of some of the most remarkable and prophetic 
utterances of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha which might interest the 
friends in Great Britain.  Pray convey my love to all of them.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
4 January 1924 (Enclosure)  
 
To the members of the American National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
My dearest friends!  
     On Nov. 28th I received the following communication from the 
President of the National Spiritual Assembly of Great Britain!  
     "I have now to bring to your notice, though possibly you are 
already aware of it, a matter which is of the first importance in 
the opinion of the National Spiritual Assembly as you will see 
from one of the paragraphs of the enclosed minutes of its first 
meeting, which was held on October 13th.  So far the programme 
of the conference on the `Living Religions within the British 
Empire' is in a somewhat nebulous condition, but I have 
ascertained from Miss Sharples, the honorary secretary of the 
committee of organisation, that the conference has been approved 
by the authorities of the British Empire Exhibition, 1924 and 
will last for ten days, covering the last week of the month of 
September and the first three days of October.  It is proposed that 
all religions taught and practised throughout the British Empire 
shall be represented at the conference, including the Christians, 
Muhammadans, Buddhists, Brahma Somaj, Theosophists and 
others, and that each one in turn shall have at its disposal a day 
or part of a day for a meeting to expound its principles and deal 
with its organisation and objects."  
     In their last letter, the members of the National Spiritual Assembly 
of Great Britain further inform me that the idea of the above-mentioned 
conference has originated with the Theosophical Society, 
 
+P21 
but these having later dropped its management the organisation of the 
conference passed into the hands of the School of Oriental Studies and 
the Sociological Society.  You will also note from the enclosed copy of 
a letter addressed by the same Miss Sharples to the President of the 
British National Spiritual Assembly that the time offered to the 
&Baha'i representatives will be very limited, and that most probably 
the allotted time will be just sufficient to read their papers or deliver 
their address and engage in the discussion that might arise after their 
formal presentation of the Cause.  
     As the British Empire Exhibition, of which this conference forms 
a part, is itself a semi-official undertaking, and receives actually the 
generous support and active participation of the government authorities 
throughout the British Empire, I feel that the opportunities now 
offered to the &Baha'i world should not be missed, as this chance, if 
properly utilised, might arouse and stimulate widespread interest 
among the enlightened public.  
     As so much will depend upon the nature and general presentation 
of the theme, rather than upon the personality of the reader or speaker, 
I feel that first and foremost our attention should be concentrated on the 
choice and thorough preparation of the subject matter as well as on the 
proper drafting and the form of the paper itself, which might possibly 
have to be submitted afterwards to the authorities of the conference.  
     I feel the necessity of entrusting this highly important and delicate 
task to a special committee, to be appointed most carefully by the 
National Spiritual Assembly of America, and consisting of those who 
by their knowledge of the Cause, their experience in matters of 
publicity, and particularly by their power of expression and beauty of 
style will be qualified to produce a befitting statement on the unique 
history of the Movement as well as its lofty principles.  
     I am enclosing an article on the &Baha'i Movement which I trust 
might serve as a basis and example of the paper in question.  An 
account of the most salient features of the history of the Cause, a brief 
but impressive reference to its many heroes and martyrs, a convincing 
and comprehensive presentation of the basic principles, and a 
characteristic survey of the Master's life, as well as a short but graphic 
description of the present position and influence of the Movement both 
in the East and the West, should, in my opinion, be included and 
combined into one conclusive argument.  Its length should not surpass 
that of the enclosed article, and its general tone, expression and 
language should be at once dignified, sober and forceful.  
 
+P22 
     The greatest care and caution must be exercised in choosing those 
who can best provide and fulfil the above-mentioned requisites and 
conditions.  
     I shall be most pleased to offer my views and suggestions once the 
paper has assumed its final shape, and wish you to obtain the assistance 
and advice of those whom you think able to judge amongst the friends 
in England and elsewhere.  
     Mr. Simpson, the President of the British National Spiritual 
Assembly, writes that Miss Grand from Canada has suggested the 
names of Dr. Watson and Mr. J. O. McCarthy of Toronto to 
represent the Canadian &Baha'is.  I would be pleased to receive your 
views as to who should represent Canada at the Conference.  India is 
the only other country within the British Empire that can send a 
native &Baha'i representative to the conference, and it is rather 
unfortunate that the United States of America should have to be 
excluded, as the speakers at the conference must necessarily be subjects 
of the British Empire.  
     I am enclosing recent translations of the prophetic and most 
remarkable words of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha which I trust you 
will all find of great value and interest in the great work you are doing 
for the Cause.  
     May this great project yield an abundant harvest for the Cause, and 
your efforts be richly blessed by the guiding Spirit of &Abdu'l-Baha.  
                                    Your fellow-worker, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
18 January 1924 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Shoghi Effendi was glad to hear from you again and hopes 
that the activities of the friends in England are progressing day 
after day.  There is really so much to be done in almost every 
country that the more the friends accomplish, the larger does the 
field of service become.  As a matter of fact in many countries we 
can hardly claim to have fully represented the Cause and to have 
declared its strong and sublime principles to all classes of men.  It 
is with a vision of greater accomplishments among higher and 
higher circles of society, that our Guardian wishes his fellow-workers 
to feel inspired; and in these dark and dismal days it is 
 
+P23 
the proclamation of &Baha'u'llah's great Message for which the 
faithful servant must strive with heart and soul.  
     Concerning the sum which Shoghi Effendi has sent to the 
National Assembly as a personal gift; he would like to inform 
you that in case you feel in great need of funds for the activities 
of the Cause in England, you might take from the sum which he 
sent you, and at the time of the Exposition Shoghi Effendi might 
be able to help you in case you cannot collect the necessary 
expense.  Shoghi Effendi attaches great hopes to the activities of 
the friends in London, and may they some day be realised.  
     The copies of the "Hidden Words" you had published were 
received and Shoghi Effendi thinks that they are quite well 
printed.  He is glad that he can share these comforting thoughts 
from &Baha'u'llah with his brothers and sisters in the West....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear fellow-worker, 
     I always look forward with keen anticipation to any news from 
England indicating the progress and advancement of the Cause so dear 
to our hearts.  I pray ardently for every one of you and assure you 
personally of my affection, esteem and gratitude, 
                                    Your brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
6 February 1924 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter to our dear 
Guardian and assure you that he is always most glad to hear from 
you in person and to know still more of the activities of his 
fellow-workers in that country.  At a time when the whole work 
and administration of the Cause with all its overpowering 
intensity and extent has devolved upon the shoulders of our 
youthful Guardian, I am sure you quite well realise what every 
single expression of the progress of the Cause he stands for would 
mean to him as our leader and captain; and at a time when the 
varied questions and problems that the &Baha'i Movement, on its 
way to the spiritual reconquest of the world, is confronted with, 
seem endless in number, I hardly need mention what effect the 
 
+P24 
personal assurance and the undying enthusiasm of his fellow-workers 
would bear upon the tender heart of Shoghi Effendi.  
     Concerning the passing away of Mr. Hall's father, he wishes 
me to ask you to extend to him a full measure of his grief at the 
bereavement of such a radiant brother as Mr. Hall, although he 
briefly conveyed his sentiments to him through a short telegram.  
He was, however, quite pleased with Mr. Hall's work and the 
measure of success which he has met with.  He shared this good 
news with his friends here with a view to inspire all to action.  
You should assure Mr. Hall that the deep sense of love and 
gratitude that Shoghi Effendi feels toward him is perhaps too 
great for me to put into words, but I feel that the success which 
he has attained is an ample proof of Shoghi Effendi's ardent 
prayers for him.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My esteemed brother:--
     Just a word of appreciation on my part of your devoted and persistent 
efforts in the service of the Cause.  Do please convey to our precious 
Mr. Hall my condolences and sentiments of undying affection as well 
as the assurance of my ardent prayers for the welfare and spiritual 
happiness of his dear family and the Manchester &Baha'i Group.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
11 June 1924 
 
To Mr. Simpson, President of the &Baha'i National Spiritual 
Assembly of England.  
 
My dear and revered &Baha'i Brother, 
     As I do not have your address with me I am writing and 
forwarding this to you through our dear brother, Mr. 
Asgarzadeh.+  Some time ago I received a letter addressed to our 
beloved Guardian from Miss Mabel M. Sharples, the Hon. 
Secretary of the Conference on Living Religions within the 
Empire, giving him some information concerning the time of 
the Conference, and conditions covering the submission of 
papers to be read at the Conference.  I forwarded this letter to our 
beloved Shoghi Effendi.  
     Yesterday I received a letter from him instructing me to 
 
+P25 
answer in his behalf Miss Sharples' letter.  Yesterday I answered 
her letter and told her that Shoghi Effendi hopes to be able to 
attend the Conference and deliver an address on the Cause in 
person and in case circumstances prevent him from doing so, a 
paper will be sent to the Conference through Mr. Simpson, the 
President of the &Baha'i Spiritual Assembly, to be read on that 
occasion.  I told her also that we will appreciate any further 
information or suggestion she thinks necessary in regard to this 
matter.  This information or suggestion will be communicated 
by her to your National Spiritual Assembly.  
     This morning a cablegram was communicated by the Greatest 
Holy Leaf to Mr. Roy Wilhelm in New York, instructing the 
committee in charge of the desired article to hasten its despatch.  
This article should be handed towards the end of July.  The time 
is short.  If the American friends have already sent that article, I 
mean if it is on the way, and we receive it in time, we shall 
immediately forward it to our dear Shoghi Effendi for his 
approval and then mail it to you.  If it, however, arrives late, we 
will directly mail it to you so that you may modify it if necessary 
and hand it over to the Secretary of the Conference.  In the latter 
case, it is not necessary to submit it to Shoghi Effendi for his 
approval, for he authorises you, the members of the National 
Spiritual Assembly to make any correction which you think 
advisable.  
     Shoghi Effendi has also instructed me to enclose a cheque for 
thirty pounds in this letter as contribution towards the 
Conference.  If the English friends are to add something to this 
sum and offer it to the Conference, it will be highly appreciated 
by Shoghi Effendi.  
     The cheque is drawn by the Anglo-Palestine Bank at Haifa on 
the Jewish Colonial Trust, London, payable to your order.  It is 
dated June 15th and No. F077834/34224.  Today we received 
the answer to our cablegram to Mr. Wilhelm, stating that the 
article was mailed on the 11th, both to Haifa and England and 
that Mr. Mills would gladly act at the Conference.  
     As we understand Mr. Mountfort Mills may go from America 
to England at the time of the Conference.  Shoghi Effendi will be 
very glad, if Mr. Mills read the Paper.  This desire of Shoghi 
Effendi was also mentioned in to-day's cablegram which was 
communicated to Mr. Wilhelm.  
 
+P26 
     Through the many cablegrams and letters which have arrived 
from different centres of the Cause, promising the maintenance 
of harmony, union and love among the dear friends, the grief 
and sorrow of our beloved Guardian has been greatly lightened 
and so we have great hope that when the hot season of the Holy 
Land is over, we will have the pleasure and joy of his return.  
     The members of the Holy Family are all sending you and 
your dear co-workers their tender love and assure you of their 
ardent prayers at the Holy Shrines in your behalf.  They are 
always awaiting heart-refreshing glad tidings from you.  My 
humble greeting and warm love to yourself and the dear friends 
too.  
     Your humble brother and co-worker in His service,

My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     ...I have to write you and inform you that only yesterday I 
had the privilege of receiving a letter from our dear Guardian 
who is still away from Haifa ... he wishes me to write you, in 
answer to your letter to him, that he very much regrets to be 
unable to be present in London and represent a Cause to which 
he has ... dedicated his heart and soul.  Were it at all possible for 
me to send you his short note, you would see for yourself with 
what a spirit he expresses his deep regret....  Although he realises 
your disappointment at his inability to go to London, he wishes 
me to assure every one of you that his eager prayers for you all 
is unfailing and that it is with a glad heart that he cherishes the 
fondest hopes in the effort that the proceedings of the religious 
Conference shall have on the audience.  May I also add that this 
is a hope in which everybody shares especially the Greatest Holy 
Leaf and the members of the family.  
     I presume by now you have already received a copy of the 
address that is to be read...  
 
+P27 
     You might be interested to know that the news of the progress 
of the Cause among the Kadiani sect in India is quite surprising 
and two of their chief leaders have not only become &Baha'is, but 
have started an admirable little weekly, I think, through which 
they hope to bring many of their colleagues over.  By the way, 
I believe the leader of the sect who is himself a young man is 
coming over to London to represent his sect at the Conference.  
     The confusion and disorder in Persia which had aroused so 
much apprehension on the part of the helpless &Baha'is and had 
even led in one case to actual martyrdom, has apparently 
subsided for the moment.  
     Here in Haifa everybody is in good health.  With heartfelt 
greetings to all the friends in London....

Care of the National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
Dear Friends, 
     I return to the Holy Land with an overpowering sense of the 
gravity of the spiritual state of the Cause in the world.  Much as I 
deplore the disturbing effect of my forced and repeated withdrawals 
from the field of service, I can unhesitatingly assure you that my last 
and momentous step was taken with extreme reluctance and only after 
 
+F1 Also addressed to America and published in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P28 
mature and anxious reflection as to the best way to safeguard the 
interests of a precious Cause.  
     My prolonged absence, my utter inaction should not, however, be 
solely attributed to certain external manifestations of unharmony, of 
discontent and disloyalty--however paralysing their effect has been 
upon the continuance of my work--but also to my own unworthiness 
and to my imperfections and frailties.  
     I venture to request you to join me in yet another prayer, this time 
more ardent and universal than before, supplicating with one voice the 
gracious Master to overlook our weaknesses and failings, to make us 
worthier and braver children of His own.  
     Humanity, through suffering and turmoil, is swiftly moving on 
towards its destiny; if we be loiterers, if we fail to play our part surely 
others will be called upon to take up our task as ministers to the crying 
needs of this afflicted world.  
     Not by the force of numbers, not by the mere exposition of a set of 
new and noble principles, not by an organised campaign of teaching--
no matter how worldwide and elaborate in its character--not even by 
the staunchness of our faith or the exaltation of our enthusiasm, can 
we ultimately hope to vindicate in the eyes of a critical and sceptical 
age the supreme claim of the &Abha Revelation.  One thing and only 
one thing will unfailingly and alone secure the undoubted triumph of 
this sacred Cause, namely, the extent to which our own inner life and 
private character mirror forth in their manifold aspects the splendour 
of those eternal principles proclaimed by &Baha'u'llah.  
     Looking back upon those sullen days of my retirement, bitter with 
feelings of anxiety and gloom, I can recall with appreciation and 
gratitude those unmistakable evidences of your affection and steadfast 
zeal which I have received from time to time, and which have served 
to relieve in no small measure the burden that weighed so heavily upon 
my heart.  
     I can well imagine the degree of uneasiness, nay of affliction, that 
must have agitated the mind and soul of every loving and loyal servant 
of the Beloved during these long months of suspense and distressing 
silence.  But I assure you such remarkable solicitude as you have shown 
for the protection of His Cause, such tenacity of faith and unceasing 
activity as you have displayed for its promotion, cannot but in the end 
be abundantly rewarded by &Abdu'l-Baha, who from His station above 
is the sure witness of all that you have endured and suffered for Him.  
     And now as I look into the future, I hope to see the friends at all 
 
+P29 
times, in every land, and of every shade of thought and character, 
voluntarily and joyously rallying round their local and in particular 
their national centres of activity, upholding and promoting their 
interests with complete unanimity and contentment, with perfect 
understanding, genuine enthusiasm, and sustained vigour.  This indeed 
is the one joy and yearning of my life, for it is the fountain-head from 
which all future blessings will flow, the broad foundation upon which 
the security of the Divine Edifice must ultimately rest.  May we not 
hope that now at last the dawn of a brighter day is breaking upon our 
beloved Cause?

My dear good brother, 
     Your letter of Sept. 30th written to our beloved Guardian, 
Shoghi Effendi, arrived and rejoiced his dear heart with its very 
interesting contents.  
     Yesterday he instructed me to translate a great part of it into 
Persian so that it may be inserted in the circular of the Haifa 
Spiritual Assembly and also to convey to you his great affection 
for you and the dear English friends who so splendidly laboured 
towards the dignified representation of the Cause of God at the 
Conference on Religions.  
     We have already the reports given in "The Times" from the 
two sessions of the Conference allotted to the &Ahmadiyyih 
people and to us.  Both are very interesting indeed....  
     Shoghi Effendi prays for the success and confirmation of you 
and all the dear and noble English friends whose earnestness of 
efforts towards the welfare of the Cause of God he highly 
admires and appreciates with profound love....  
 
 
10 October 1924 
 
My dearly-beloved brother, 
     I am highly gratified with your splendid achievements and deeply 
appreciative of your painstaking efforts.  More power to your elbow!  
You are rendering our precious Cause a splendid service in its hour of 
 
+P30 
need!  Lady Blomfield's+ idea of a reception was undoubtedly inspired 
and was admirably executed.  It has indeed rejoiced my heart.  My love 
and my gratitude for her wise, patient and fruitful efforts.  
                                    Your brother,

My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your very interesting letter of Oct. 15th. written to our 
beloved Guardian together with the printed copy of the sermon 
of Dr. Walsh arrived the day before yesterday and imparted 
great joy to his dear heart.  He cherishes great hopes for the bright 
future of the Cause in England.  Of course his hopes are partly 
based on the intrinsic mighty power of the Cause of God and 
partly on the dignified way the dear friends in England are 
presenting the Cause of God to the public.  
     Yesterday afternoon he instructed me to write this informing 
you of the safe arrival of your letter and assure you that he 
appreciates with great love your distinguished services to the 
Cause of God.  He prays at the Holy Shrines that fresh 
confirmations may reach you from the &Abha Kingdom day by 
day so that you may have material comfort and spiritual success.  
He is sure that the holy spirit of our beloved Lord, &Abdu'l-Baha 
is watching over you and guiding your steps in life.  
     The members of the Holy Family and the friends in Haifa are 
thinking of you and the other dear friends in England with love 
and admiration, joining all in prayers for your happiness.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dearest friend, 
     I wish to add a few words of assurance and sympathy in view of the 
heavy burden of responsibility that rests on your shoulders in these 
difficult and trying times.  My fervent and increasing prayer is that 
&Abdu'l-Baha may show you the way that will enable you to continue 
your splendid pioneer work effectually, peacefully, free from every 
earthly care and anxiety.  Dr. Walsh's sermon is astonishingly good.  
I wish you would send me about 50 copies of the same.  I pray 
unceasingly for my friends in England.  
                                                            Shoghi

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     It is always a pleasure to acknowledge receipt of your letters 
to our dear Guardian, and he was deeply interested in the minutes 
of the last meeting of the N.S.A. which you were so kind as to 
enclose.  
     Your own letter, however, brought up a very interesting and 
vital question in regard to the future progress of the Cause in 
England, especially now that through the efforts of you all the 
spread of the &Baha'i Movement has been well placed on the road 
to our ultimate victory.  Now is the time to take all necessary 
measures against a slacking in our pace and it is truly unfortunate 
that just when the individual endeavours of every single member 
is most needed and necessary, age and earthly cares deprive us of 
some of our experienced and able co-workers.  It would, I believe, 
be a great service if just as few as possible could manage to deny 
themselves of the joy and enthusiasm of serving as noble a Cause.  
     I am sure it would interest you to know that Mr. and Mrs. 
Mills are now in Haifa and all that they have to say proves well 
the energy and efforts of the London friends.  We already have 
about ten pilgrims and are expecting some more.  I suppose Dr. 
Esslemont who would have much to tell us and whose arrival 
Shoghi Effendi is eagerly awaiting, is among those who will 
soon arrive....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear fellow-worker, 
     I trust that the prolonged visit of Dr. Esslemont will prove to be in 
future pregnant with far-reaching possibilities for the service of the 
Cause in England.  To yourself I send my imperishable love and 
brotherly greetings.  
                                    Affectionately, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
22 November 1924 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     The letter you had sent through Dr. Esslemont to Shoghi 
Effendi has arrived and it gave him very great pleasure to read 
it.  Although it is quite beyond me to express to you just what 
 
+P32 
thoughts and sentiments your frank expressions of loyalty and 
love aroused in his heart, this I feel I can assure you that it made 
him hopeful of the future and added to his great confidence in 
you.  
     The &Baha'i Cause has a great mission to the people of England 
but the field of service though immensely vast presents 
innumerable difficulties, and it needs the able hand of a staunch 
and true &Baha'i primarily and the dexterity of a good supervisor, 
to overcome every confronting difficulty and to carry His 
Message to millions of people.  This responsibility has been 
entrusted to you by the guided decision of the &Baha'is in England 
and our Guardian finds great pleasure in confiding the same duty 
in you and in endorsing the happy decision of the friends there.  
     In regard to your contemplated withdrawal from the 
presidency of the N.S.A. and the London Assembly, it made him 
very happy to know that even the thought of it has totally 
vanished.  The hopes that he cherished in you are far too many to 
permit you a more quiet part in &Baha'i activities in England, and 
the hopeful signs of progress in the past year has made the 
prospects of the coming year very bright and it all depends upon 
the efforts of the friends in England and the guidance of our 
Master from on high just how bright it shall turn out to be.  
     We still have Mr. Mills with us in Haifa and I assure you, we 
miss you very much.  The photograph you had sent to Shoghi 
Effendi has been received and it shall be framed and placed in the 
Persian Pilgrim House...  
     ...just of late we had the very sad news of the martyrdom of 
a &Baha'i woman expecting to be soon a mother, and although she 
was related to very influential officers in the army, nothing 
could make the criminals, who sought refuge in the house of one 
of the Mullas, arrested.  Though such cases of untold carnage 
prove with much more force than mere words just what the 
spirit of &Baha'u'llah infused into every such &Baha'i has been, and 
exactly what it means in Persia to try and become one, the 
horrors of such a murder are truly beyond words.  All that we 
have to do is to seek His Grace and to beg and implore for God's 
mercy.  
     May I also write a further assurance of Shoghi Effendi's 
reliance upon you and with an expression of his heartfelt love for 
you....  
 
+P33 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My most precious fellow-worker, 
     But for your unremitting labours, your sound and selfless efforts, the 
burden that weighs upon me would prove well-nigh unbearable.  I am 
sure your heart responds to the sentiments that surge in my heart.  I 
have a profound admiration for the heroic manner in which you are 
rendering such pioneer service to the Cause in England.  May the 
Master sustain you, comfort you and uphold you in your great task.  
Be assured of my brotherly, unfailing prayers.  
                                    I am your true and affectionate brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 

24 November 1924+F1  
 
To my dearly beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha.  
Care of the English National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
Dearest friends!  
     The day is drawing near when for the third time we shall 
commemorate the world over the passing of our well-beloved &Abdu'l-Baha.  
May we not pause for a moment, and gather our thoughts?  
How has it fared with us, His little band of followers, since that day?  
Whither are we now marching, what has been our achievement?  
     We have but to turn our eyes to the world without to realise the 
fierceness and the magnitude of the forces of darkness that are 
struggling with the dawning light of the &Abha Revelation.  Nations, 
though exhausted and disillusioned, have seemingly begun to cherish 
anew the spirit of revenge, of domination, and strife.  Peoples, convulsed 
by economic upheavals, are slowly drifting into two great opposing 
camps with all their menace of social chaos, class hatreds, and world-wide 
ruin.  Races, alienated more than ever before, are filled with 
mistrust, humiliation and fear, and seem to prepare themselves for a 
fresh and fateful encounter.  Creeds and religions, caught in this 
whirlpool of conflict and passion, appear to gaze with impotence and 
despair at this spectacle of increasing turmoil.  
     Such is the plight of mankind three years after the passing of Him 
from Whose lips fell unceasingly the sure message of a fast-approaching 
Divine salvation.  Are we by our thoughts, our words, our deeds, 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P34 
whether individually or collectively, preparing the way?  Are we 
hastening the advent of the Day He so often foretold?  
     None can deny that the flame of faith and love which His mighty 
hand kindled in many hearts has, despite our bereavement, continued 
to burn as brightly and steadily as ever before.  Who can question that 
His loved ones, both in the East and the West, notwithstanding the 
insidious strivings of the enemies of the Cause, have displayed a spirit 
of unshakable loyalty worthy of the highest praise?  What greater 
perseverance and fortitude than that which His tried and trusted 
friends have shown in the face of untold calamities, intolerable 
oppression, and incredible restrictions?  Such staunchness of faith, such 
an unsullied love, such magnificent loyalty, such heroic constancy, 
such noble courage, however unprecedented and laudable in themselves, 
cannot alone lead us to the final and complete triumph of such a great 
Cause.  Not until the dynamic love we cherish for Him is sufficiently 
reflected in its power and purity in all our dealings with our fellowmen, 
however remotely connected and humble in origin, can we hope to 
exalt in the eyes of a self-seeking world the genuineness of the all-conquering
love of God.  Not until we live ourselves the life of a true 
&Baha'i can we hope to demonstrate the creative and transforming 
potency of the Faith we profess.  Nothing but the abundance of our 
actions, nothing but the purity of our lives and the integrity of our 
character, can in the last resort establish our claim that the &Baha'i spirit 
is in this day the sole agency that can translate a long cherished ideal 
into an enduring achievement.  
     With this vision clearly set before us, and fortified by the knowledge 
of the gracious aid of &Baha'u'llah and the repeated assurances of 
&Abdu'l-Baha, let us first strive to live the life and then arise with one 
heart, one mind, one voice, to reinforce our numbers and achieve our 
end.  Let us recall, and seek on this sad occasion the comfort of the last 
wishes of our departed yet ever watchful Master:  
 
        "It behoveth them not to rest for a moment, neither to 
     seek repose.  They must disperse themselves in every land, 
     pass by every clime, and travel throughout all regions.  
     Bestirred, without rest, and steadfast to the end, they must 
     raise in every land the triumphal cry, &Ya &Baha'u'l-Abha!  
     (O Thou the Glory of Glories)....  The disciples of Christ 
     forgot themselves and all earthly things, forsook all their 
     cares and belongings, purged themselves of self and passion, 
 
+P35 
     and with absolute detachment scattered far and wide and 
     engaged in calling the peoples of the world to the divine 
     guidance; till at last they made the world another world, 
     illumined the surface of the earth, and even to their last 
     hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that beloved 
     one of God.  Finally in various lands they suffered glorious 
     martyrdom.  Let them that are men of action follow in their 
     footsteps!"  
 
     Having grasped the significance of these words, having obtained a 
clear understanding of the true character of our mission, the methods 
to adopt, the course to pursue, and having attained sufficiently that 
individual regeneration--the essential requisite of teaching--let us 
arise to teach His Cause with righteousness, conviction, understanding 
and vigour.  Let this be the paramount and most urgent duty of every 
&Baha'i.  Let us make it the dominating passion of our life.  Let us scatter 
to the uttermost corners of the earth; sacrifice our personal interests, 
comforts, tastes and pleasures; mingle with the divers kindreds and 
peoples of the world; familiarise ourselves with their manners, 
traditions, thoughts and customs; arouse, stimulate and maintain 
universal interest in the Movement, and at the same time endeavour 
by all the means in our power, by concentrated and persistent attention, 
to enlist the unreserved allegiance and the active support of the more 
hopeful and receptive among our hearers.  Let us too bear in mind the 
example which our beloved Master has clearly set before us.  Wise and 
tactful in His approach, wakeful and attentive in His early intercourse, 
broad and liberal in all His public utterances, cautious and gradual in 
the unfolding of the essential verities of the Cause, passionate in His 
appeal yet sober in argument, confident in tone, unswerving in 
conviction, dignified in His manners--such were the distinguishing 
features of our Beloved's noble presentation of the Cause of &Baha'u'llah.  
     If we all choose to tread faithfully His path, surely the day is not far 
distant when our beloved Cause will have emerged from the inevitable 
obscurity of a young and struggling Faith into the broad daylight of 
universal recognition.  This is our duty, our first obligation.  Therein 
lies the secret of the success of the Cause we love so well.  Therein lies 
the hope, the salvation of mankind.  Are we fully conscious of our 
responsibilities?  Do we realise the urgency, the sacredness, the 
immensity, the glory of our task?  
     I entreat you, dear friends, to continue, nay, to redouble your efforts, 
 
+P36 
to keep your vision clear, your hopes undimmed, your determination 
unshaken, so that the power of God within us may fill the world with 
all its glory.  
     In this fervent plea joins me the Greatest Holy Leaf.  Though 
chagrined in the evening of her life at the sorrowful tales of repression 
in Persia, she still turns with the deepest longings of her heart to your 
land where freedom reigns, eager and expectant to behold, ere she is 
called away, the signs of the universal triumph of the Cause she loves 
so dearly.

My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your interesting letter of March 12th written to our beloved 
Guardian together with the draft minutes of the 12th meeting of 
your National Spiritual Assembly has been received.  The draft 
on Haifa for the sum of thirty-three pounds sterling which is the 
joint contribution of the English friends for the relief of their 
suffering brothers at &Nayriz, and enclosed in your letter, has also 
been received.  This sum has been added to contributions received 
from other centres and will be sent by next mail to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of Persia.  From Persia they shall acknowledge 
the receipt of this sum directly and for the present, our Guardian 
acknowledges its receipt gratefully and wishes you to kindly 
convey his gratitude to all the dear friends who have so kindly 
and generously contributed.  
     Our dear brother, Dr. Esslemont, was not well for some time, 
 
+P37 
but now I am glad to tell you that he is better and we are 
expecting him to come out of the hospital to-day.  
     We have nowadays the pleasure of having among us the first 
group of our beloved New Zealand and Australian believers.  
They are of great sincerity and devotion.  From here they are 
intending to visit England where I am sure you will enjoy their 
acquaintance and company very much....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My precious fellow-worker, 
     The prompt and generous contribution of the British friends for the 
relief of the sufferers in &Nayriz is deeply appreciated and I wish to 
offer through you to them all in the name of the victims of that great 
catastrophe my deep and grateful thanks.  May the All-Bountiful 
reward and bless them a hundred fold!  The sum of approximately 
1000 pounds has been until now collected from various parts of the 
&Baha'i world and more is expected.  What an admirable and convincing 
testimony of the reality of the &Baha'i bond that binds the East with the 
West.  Regarding the historical compilation suggested by the Persian 
friends, I think your plan is suitable and correct.  The English N.S.A. 
will I trust collect all the data and exercise its discretion and judgment 
in collating all the material received from the friends and assemblies 
throughout Great Britain, and, after having given it a definite and 
final shape, will forward it direct to Persia.  I would welcome a copy of 
it myself.  Assuring you of my gratitude and prayers, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

WITH &IRAQ HIGH COMMISSIONER APPEALING ARDENTLY FOR 
ACTION TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF &BAHA'U'LLAH'S SACRED HOUSE.  
                                                            SHOGHI.

6 November 1925+F1  
 
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the East and throughout the West.  
 
Dearly-beloved friends:  
     The sad and sudden crisis that has arisen in connexion with the 
ownership of &Baha'u'llah's sacred house in &Baghdad has sent a thrill 
of indignation and dismay throughout the whole of the &Baha'i world.  
Houses that have been occupied by &Baha'u'llah for well nigh the whole 
period of His exile in &Iraq, ordained by Him as the chosen and 
sanctified object of &Baha'i pilgrimage in future, magnified and extolled 
in countless Tablets and Epistles as the sacred centre "round which 
shall circle all peoples and kindreds of the earth"--lie now, due to 
fierce intrigue and ceaseless fanatical opposition, at the mercy of the 
declared enemies of the Cause.  
     I have instantly communicated with every &Baha'i Centre in both 
East and West, and urgently requested the faithful followers of the 
Faith in every land to protest vehemently against this glaring 
perversion of justice, to assert firmly and courteously the spiritual 
rights of the &Baha'i community to the ownership of this venerated 
house, to plead for British fairness and justice, and to pledge their 
unswerving determination to ensure the security of this hallowed spot.  
     Conscious of the fact that this property has been occupied by &Baha'i 
authorised representatives for an uninterrupted period of not less than 
thirty years, and having successfully won their case at the Justice of 
Peace and the Court of First Instance, the &Baha'is the world over 
cannot believe that the high sense of honour and fairness which 
inspired the British Administration of &Iraq will ever tolerate such 
grave miscarriage of justice.  They confidently appeal to the public 
opinion of the world for the defence and protection of their legitimate 
rights now sorely trampled under the feet of relentless enemies.  
     Widespread and effective publicity along these lines, in well-conceived 
and carefully-worded terms, is strongly recommended for it 
will undoubtedly serve to facilitate the solution of this delicate and 
perplexing problem.  
     Having exerted ourselves to the utmost of our ability, let us rest 
assured in the power of the Lord, Who keepeth watch over His house, 
and Who will, no matter how dark present prospects appear, assure for

Dear Friends, 
     I have been asked to enclose for your kind attention the 
following papers:--  
 1.  Circular letter concerning the residential house of &Baha'u'llah 
     in &Baghdad.  
 2.  Circular letter concerning the purchase of land around the 
     Holy Shrines in Haifa.  
 3.  The system of transliteration to be used in all &Baha'i references.  
 4.  A plan of the immediate neighbourhood of the Shrines in 
     Haifa showing in approximate proportions the different plots 
     around it.  
 
     In view of the extreme importance of the aforementioned 
papers, Shoghi Effendi trusts that all necessary measures will be 
taken to insure their prompt distribution among all the different 
assemblies and among all such recognised &Baha'is as your 
distinguished assembly deems fit and advisable....  
 
 
12 November 1925 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Our dear Guardian was very glad to receive your letter of 
Nov. 4th through which you acquaint him with the steps you 
have already taken in carrying out his instruction concerning the 
&Baghdad House.  
     He is highly pleased with what you have done.  In other &Baha'i 
Centres also the friends have in a similar way followed promptly 
his telegraphic instruction.  Up to this time we have received no 
further information regarding the actual situation of the House.  
     Shoghi Effendi will let you know of any fresh development 
as soon as he receives information.  He sends you his warm 
affection and extends to you his appreciation for your noble 
services to the Cause of God.  He prays for your health and 
success in service.  He wishes you to kindly convey his loving 
greeting to all the dear friends in England....  
 
+P40 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear self-sacrificing brother, 
     The wise and prompt measures you have taken have given me the 
utmost satisfaction.  I trust your devoted endeavours will be crowned 
with full success.  I have sent you a few days ago various circulars, a list 
of transliterated terms and the plan of the surroundings of the Holy 
Shrine, copies of all of which I earnestly request you to place in the 
hands of every recognised believer.  
                                    Your grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

FAMILY DISTRESSING NEWS URGE BELIEVERS DEDICATE SPECIAL DAY 
FOR UNIVERSAL PRAYER AND REMEMBRANCE.  
                                                            SHOGHI 
 
27 November 1925 
 
My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I find it very hard to be able to express in adequate words our 
deep feelings and sorrow at the loss of our dearly-beloved 
brother Dr. Esslemont.  Those of us who had known him only 
since his sojourn in Haifa, had even in that short period of time, 
learnt to admire and love him.  How much more so those of you 
to whom he was an old friend and fellow-worker.  
     I have been ordered by Shoghi Effendi to relate in as simple 
words as possible for the information of his friends in England, 
the sufferings of his last days and yet words fail me in that painful 
task.  
     The chronic disease from which he had suffered in the past 
had very much undermined his weak constitution and his 
eagerness to serve the Cause he so dearly loved, despite all advice 
to the contrary, was a great tax upon his failing strength.  His stay 
at the Black Forest in Germany all through the summer had 
improved his health, but upon his return to Haifa he felt rather 
weak and he was frequently in bed for a few days.  Not until a 
fortnight ago was Dr. Esslemont seriously ill and even then the 
doctors thought that in spite of the fact that the trouble from 
 
+P41 
which he had suffered in the past was now more active there was 
no reason for great anxiety.  His health was slowly improving 
and everything was being done to give him the best medical 
advice obtainable here in Haifa, when suddenly and unexpectedly 
at about midnight of November 21st the doctor had a severe 
stroke of "cerebral embolus".  The next day a second stroke 
followed and he at last succumbed to the third which he had at 
about seven o'clock of the next evening.  The attending doctors 
were both European--one Italian and the other German.  Our 
two &Baha'i doctors Yunis &Khan and &Mirza &Arastu, whom you 
must have met in London very gladly put themselves at his 
disposal.  
     Hard as it was for everyone who had known Dr. Esslemont 
to see him pass away and to realise what a great loss it means to 
the friends the world over, we can find no greater consolation 
than in the happy thought that he now lies in peace and his soul 
where it so loved to be.  Beyond all earthly cares, all pains and 
sorrows his soul dwells forever.  
     The funeral service was both simple and touching.  His body 
was washed by two of the friends, dressed and wrapped in white 
silk cloth and perfumed by attar of roses.  On his finger Shoghi 
Effendi placed his own &Baha'i ring which he had worn for a 
good many years.  Laid in a simple casket of walnut and placed 
in the hall of the Pilgrim House, the friends gathered together 
and said their funeral prayer over him.  The casket was carried 
for a short distance by Shoghi Effendi and then placed in the 
Master's carriage and accompanied by the sons-in-law of the 
Master it slowly wound its way, followed by eleven other cabs 
carrying the friends, to the foot of Mt. Carmel.  There it was laid 
to rest in that beautifully-situated cemetery, and flowers from 
the garden of the Master's home were scattered over his grave.  
Simple as he was in his life and character, equally simple was his 
funeral service.  And yet just as in the simplicity of his character 
lay his many virtues, in like manner did the simplicity of that 
service sink into every heart and fill every eye with tears.  
     In case you think it would please them you are perfectly 
welcome to communicate to the family of Dr. Esslemont the 
particulars of his death and burial.  Enclosed you will please find 
a letter from Shoghi Effendi addressed to the family and relations 
of the deceased.  You will please have it read by his wife, who I 
 
+P42 
believe is in London, and then sent over to his father and sister 
who are in Aberdeen.  
     Due to the reason that Shoghi Effendi hopes to build in the 
near future the grave of Dr. Esslemont on his behalf and on 
behalf of all the friends, our Guardian would like very much to 
have the design chosen by the family of the deceased.  Of course 
you would let them know that through certain considerations it 
would be best to have the design devoid of any cross as that in 
this country would particularise it to the Christian faith.  You 
would let the family know that the expense would be defrayed 
by the friends all over the world and by Shoghi Effendi himself.  
     Shoghi Effendi would also like you to send the picture of Dr. 
Esslemont to the countries where the friends have published 
magazines with a request to have it published.  They are America, 
India, Germany and Australia.  He wants you also to write a 
comprehensive biographical sketch of the life of Dr. Esslemont 
for "The Star" in America laying most stress on his life since he 
became a &Baha'i.  This of course does not necessarily mean that 
you should write it yourself but anyone in London.  You should 
also make mention of him in your circular letter in detail....

To the beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful in the East 
and in the West.  
 
Dear fellow-workers, 
     It is with feelings of overwhelming sorrow that I communicate to 
you the news of yet another loss which the Almighty, in His 
inscrutable wisdom, has chosen to inflict upon our beloved Cause.  On 
the 22nd of November, 1925--that memorable and sacred day in 
which the &Baha'is of the Orient celebrated the twin Festivals of the 
Declaration of the &Bab and the Birthday of &Abdu'l-Baha--Dr. John 
E. Esslemont passed on to the &Abha Kingdom.  His end was as swift 
as it was unexpected.  Suffering from the effects of a chronic and 
insidious disease, he fell at last a victim to the inevitable complications 
that ensued, the fatal course of which neither the efforts of vigilant 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P43 
physicians nor the devoted care of his many friends could possibly 
deflect.  
     He bore his sufferings with admirable fortitude, with calm 
resignation and courage.  Though convinced that his ailments would 
never henceforth forsake him, yet many a time he revealed a burning 
desire that the friends residing in the Holy Land should, while visiting 
the Shrines, implore the All-Merciful to prolong his days that he may 
bring to a fuller completion his humble share of service to the Threshold 
of &Baha'u'llah.  To this noble request all hearts warmly responded.  But 
this was not to be.  His close association with my work in Haifa, in 
which I had placed fondest hopes, was suddenly cut short.  His book, 
however, an abiding monument to his pure intention, will, alone, 
inspire generations yet unborn to tread the path of truth and service as 
steadfastly and as unostentatiously as was trodden by its beloved 
author.  The Cause he loved so well he served even unto his last day 
with exemplary faith and unstinted devotion.  His tenacity of faith, his 
high integrity, his self-effacement, his industry and painstaking 
labours were traits of a character the noble qualities of which will live 
and live forever after him.  To me personally he was the warmest of 
friends, a trusted counsellor, an indefatigable collaborator, a lovable 
companion.  
     With tearful eyes I supplicate at the Threshold of &Baha'u'llah--
and request you all to join--in my ardent prayers, for the fuller 
unfolding in the realms beyond of a soul that has already achieved so 
high a spiritual standing in this world.  For by the beauty of his 
character, by his knowledge of the Cause, by the conspicuous 
achievements of his book, he has immortalised his name, and by sheer 
merit deserved to rank as one of the Hands of the Cause of God.  
     He has been laid to rest in the heart of that beautifully situated 
&Baha'i burial ground at the foot of Carmel, close to the mortal remains 
of that venerable soul, &Haji &Mirza &Vakilu'd-Dawlih, the illustrious 
cousin of the &Bab and chief builder of the &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 
&Ishqabad.  Pilgrims visiting his grave from far and near will, with 
pride and gratitude, do honour to a name that adorned the annals of an 
immortal Cause.  
     May he eternally rest in peace.

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I write to acknowledge receipt of your two letters of Nov. 25 
and 28th to Shoghi Effendi and to thank you on his behalf for all 
the trouble you have taken in communicating to the friends and 
to his family the sad news of the passing away of Dr. Esslemont.  
Shoghi Effendi cannot but appreciate the many evidences of 
your devotion and love.  
     We are very glad to know that Mr. Mills is as successful in his 
endeavours and we trust that it should end with a decisive 
victory on our part.  Mr. Mills has kept us briefly in touch with 
what he has been doing in London but we still await more 
detailed news from him.  He is probably too busy to write.  
     Shoghi Effendi has already heard from Miss Esslemont.  
     Everybody is well here.  Shoghi Effendi and the family send 
you their heartfelt greetings....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear indefatigable co-worker, 
     Knowing what the urgency and multiplicity of pressing activities 
mean to a person who pursues his task almost single-handed, I can 
well understand, sympathise, and admire your noble endeavours and 
the splendid work you are doing for the Cause of God.  I wish to renew 
the expression of my deep confidence in, and great appreciation of, the 
part you play at this highly-important and difficult stage of our work.  
Your communications regarding the houses in &Baghdad have been 
highly satisfactory and I trust will yield the long-desired fruit.  
Regarding the position of ..., &Azizu'llah &Khan &Bahadur will 
immediately after my decision let you know on my behalf what I feel 
to be the most suitable way of meeting this difficult situation.  I feel too 
overwhelmed with work to write more.

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I am sending you enclosed a copy of the pamphlet written by 
Dr. Esselmont.  
     Last year Dr. Esslemont sent you a similar copy of the 
pamphlet fully revised for you to publish.  Shoghi Effendi would 
like very much to have a copy of his revised edition and is 
sending the enclosed only as a reminder of some of the 
corrections and revisions he had made in the copy he sent you.  
In case you have published copies of the revised edition, Shoghi 
Effendi would like to have a number of copies sent to him and 
in case you have not published it, he would like you to send him 
a correct copy of the revised form of the edition as you have it.  
He could have it published himself.  In any case, however, he 
wishes you to send back to him the enclosed copy.  
     We received last night news that the keys of the houses in 
&Baghdad have been given to the &Shi'ites and they had made a 
regular demonstration on the occasion.  We await to see what 
will be done at last....  
 
 
23 January 1926 
 
My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I take pleasure in thanking you on behalf of our dear Guardian 
for your letters of Dec. 9th and 13th and of Jan. 4th which he 
was very glad to receive.  He appreciates immensely your many 
efforts and although so far away, you are to him, I assure you, a 
great and indispensable helper.  It is always with confidence in its 
thoroughness that he refers to you anything of importance.  
     He is so glad to learn that the friends in England have in the 
different centres held memorial meetings for our departed 
brother.  He was to us all a great friend and fellow-worker and 
to the Cause a faithful servant--his memory will help us to 
follow an equally righteous path.  
     The biographical sketch which you have written for the 
different &Baha'i magazines and a copy of which you had sent to 
our Guardian was received and read.  He fully approves of it and 
feels sure that the different publications will welcome your 
 
+P46 
article and will be glad to devote some of their pages to the 
memory of one whose name and writings were often to be seen 
in those same magazines.  
     With regard to the design of the grave of Dr. Esslemont, a 
picture of which you had sent enclosed, Shoghi Effendi wishes to 
inform you that although he himself liked the design and would 
have been glad to follow it altogether, up till the present the 
tombs of the &Baha'is have been very simply built and the custom 
has been to have them as beautiful and at the same time as simple 
as possible.  This general custom holds true even in the case of the 
tombs of the Master's mother and brother.  The graves are built 
of white marble stones but the designs have in every case been 
simple, and he wishes you very much to make the family of Dr. 
Esslemont understand that although Shoghi Effendi will not be 
able to follow the design strictly he will try to make the tomb 
as near it as possible, while keeping within the range of the 
customary simplicity.  Even the tomb of the cousin of the &Bab 
which is close to that of Dr. Esslemont and which Shoghi Effendi 
also intends to build will be very simple.  
     In connection with the leaflet of Dr. Esslemont, Shoghi Effendi 
feels that if you intend to publish a new edition you would do 
well to keep it until you are through with it, but if you already 
have many copies of the last issue and the Assembly does not 
intend to bring out a new edition in the near future, he wants 
you to send him the leaflet so as to be able to send it to America 
where he wants to have it translated into Hebrew and other 
languages.  At any case he wants you to send him a copy of it or 
the original as soon as possible.  
     Our Guardian has been very glad to receive a wire of late 
from &Baghdad telling him that everything was hopeful.  As yet 
we do not have any particulars but we trust that we can soon 
regain our rights in the houses.  It is perhaps very fortunate that 
the High Commissioner himself will be in &Baghdad and will be 
able to help us very much....  
     P.S.  With regard to the accent in the letter a in the 
transliteration of Persian names and words and the difficulty of 
the publishers in having a vertical mark, Shoghi Effendi feels 
that in case having the regular vertical mark means too much 
trouble and expense it would be justified to replace it by the 
horizontal dash on the a, but if the trouble and expense would 
 
+P47 
not be much, for the sake of uniformity throughout transliterations 
everywhere, it would be best to have the regular vertical 
mark.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear fellow-worker, 
     I am sure you will understand, and explain my motive and reasons 
to dear Esslemont's relatives in connexion with the design of the tomb.  
Much as I love and esteem my departed friend, I feel I must pay due 
consideration to the general practice prevailing in Haifa and &Akka 
particularly as it is applied even to the resting places of the Master's 
nearest relations.  I will however follow the design as closely as it is 
consistent with simplicity, without altering in any way the shape and 
general outline presented by the architect.  Please assure his relatives of 
my keen desire to do everything possible that will enhance and preserve 
the memory of such a staunch and precious friend.

1 April 1926 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Many thanks for your letter of Feb. 21, and I am so sorry I 
could not answer you earlier.  
     I am sending you enclosed the plan that you had sent and 
behind it I have marked the approximate prices of the plots.  You 
realise that the exact price cannot be determined because they 
fluctuate and various causes bring about this change in price.  For 
this reason I have given two figures one being the minimum and 
the other the maximum.  There are no probabilities that under 
any conditions the maximum and the minimum will change.  
However, I have sent you the price for the so called region rather 
than the individual plots, the latter being due to many reasons 
quite impossible.  
     Shoghi Effendi is quite well though as usual very busy with an 
overwhelmingly vast correspondence.  The family are all well 
and send you their love and best wishes....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My esteemed and valued friend:  
     I understand from your recent cable to me that Miss ... has at last 
complied with my request and written the London Assembly 
acknowledging their authority.  I have immediately cabled you my 
 
+P48 
heartfelt appreciation of her act.  If that is the case I wish to urge you 
and the London Council to exercise the utmost care, consideration and 
vigilance that this new step taken in the right direction may gradually 
lead to a definite solution of this painful problem.  I am as usual terribly 
overwhelmed with my unceasing work and this cable of yours has been 
a most welcome relief.  I have received your letter dated Feb. 7.  I am 
returning one of the leaflets for future publication in London.  I wish 
to remind you of the necessity of close co-operation on the part of the 
English National Spiritual Assembly with `La nova Tago' published 
in Hamburg.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
11 April 1926 
 
My dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I thank you very much indeed on behalf of our dear Guardian 
for your kind letters of March 29th and 31st.  
     The news of the reconciliation of ... with the National 
Assembly has been the source of immeasurable joy to the heart 
of Shoghi Effendi and he appreciates the spirit of both parties in 
trying to forget all past misunderstandings and in starting anew 
with genuine love and goodwill.  This has relieved Shoghi 
Effendi of a very heavy weight of thought and distress and this 
itself gives you as much satisfaction as it does to us all.  
     Shoghi Effendi has gladly received the names of the elected 
body for the London Assembly and he wishes them all success 
from the bottom of his heart.  That they may all help to vindicate 
still more strongly the great claim of our dear Cause in England, 
that they may succeed to increase daily the numbers of earnest 
&Baha'i workers and that they may mirror forth the great spirit 
of our beloved Master, is the fondest hope and the fervent prayer 
of our dear Guardian.  
     As I write you these lines we are all sorely distressed with the 
ghastly news of the martyrdom of twelve &Baha'is in one of the 
towns of southern Persia....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear and valued friend:  
     I have received with feelings of deep satisfaction the welcome news 
of ... compliance with my request.  I wish to impress upon all those 
who come in contact with her the necessity of exercising forbearance, 
 
+P49 
kindness and loving consideration while adhering closely to the 
established principles of the Cause.  I will inform you if any action is 
necessary regarding the martyrdom in Jahrum in Southern Persia--
a monstrous crime that has deeply afflicted us all.  Concerning the 
membership of the Spiritual Assembly, I have already communicated 
with America to the effect that the members who are entitled to vote 
must be strictly limited to nine.  Additional members may attend only 
in a consultative capacity.  I realise fully the delicacy and difficulty of 
your position but it must be made clear to all that nine and only nine 
can vote.  All other subsidiary matters are left to the Assemblies.  
                                    Lovingly, 
                                                            Shoghi

from my dear friends the &Baha'is of England as their much appreciated 
contribution for the purchase of land around the Holy Shrines on Mt. 
Carmel.

22 April 1926+F2  
 
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West. 
 
Fellow-labourers in the Divine Vineyard:  
     In the midst of the many vicissitudes which the creative Word of 
God is destined to encounter in the course of its onward march towards 
the redemption of the world, there breaks upon us the news of still 
another loss, more bewildering in its character, yet more inspiring in 
its challenge, than any of the gravest happenings of recent times.  Once 
again the woeful tale of unabated persecution, involving this time the 
martyrdom of twelve of our long-suffering brethren in Jahrum, 
southern Persia, has reached our ears, and filled us with a gloom which 
all the joys and ennobling memories of &Ridvan have failed to dispel.  
 
+F1 This is the first example of a receipt from the Guardian.  A few such 
+F1 receipts appear in this book as they illustrate his meticulous attention to 
+F1 detail.  They do not, however, represent the total contributions made by 
+F1 members of the British &Baha'i community during the thirty-five years 
+F1 covered by the book.  
+F2 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration."  
 
+P50 
     From the meagre reports which have thus far been received from 
that distracted country it appears that this shameful and atrocious act, 
though the outcome of a number of obscure and complex causes, has 
been chiefly instigated by that ever-present factor of fierce and relentless 
impulse of religious hostility.  Persia--long-neglected and sorely-tried--
continues, despite the revival of recent hopes, to be the down-trodden 
victim of unscrupulous personal rivalries and factious intrigue, 
of tribal revolt, political dissensions and religious animosities--all of 
which have in times past brought in their wake the shedding of the 
blood of so many of its innocent and choicest sons.  
     Fully alive to the gravity of the occasion, and realising the urgency 
of my sacred duty, I have, upon the receipt of the news, transmitted 
telegraphically through the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is 
of Persia a special message addressed in the name of the &Baha'is in 
every land to the supreme Authority in the State, expressing our 
profound horror at this outrageous act as well as our earnest entreaty 
to inflict immediate punishment on the perpetrators of so abominable 
a crime.  And as this sad event involved chiefly the welfare and security 
of the &Baha'i residents in Persia, I have specially requested all local 
Assemblies in that land to address a similar message to the highest 
authorities concerned appealing for full protection and justice.  Should 
future developments necessitate direct and foreign intervention, I shall 
acquaint the national &Baha'i representatives in every land to take in 
cooperation with all local Assemblies such measures as will effectually 
conduce to a fuller recognition of the dynamic force latent in the &Baha'i 
Faith and ensure the betterment of the lot of the heroic supporters of 
our Cause.  
     Pending the opening of official and direct communication with 
recognised authorities whether in Persia or elsewhere, I strongly feel 
that the time has assuredly come when it is incumbent upon every 
conscientious promoter of the Cause to bestir himself and undertake in 
consultation with the friends in his locality such measures of publicity 
as will lead to the gradual awakening of the conscience of the civilised 
world to what is admittedly an ignominious manifestation of a 
decadent age.  
     I would specially request all National Assemblies to give their 
anxious and immediate consideration to this grave matter, and to 
devise ways and means that will secure the fullest publicity to our 
grievances.  I would remind them that whatever is published should be 
couched in terms that are at once correct, forceful and inoffensive.  I 
 
+P51 
would particularly stress the importance of making every effort to 
secure the sympathy and hospitality of the leading journals and 
periodicals of the Western world, and of sending to the Holy Land any 
such references in papers that will arise to champion the cause of 
Righteousness and Justice.  I greatly deplore the fact that owing to the 
remoteness and the unstable conditions in Persia, details and particulars 
regarding this ugly incident are not as yet available, but will be duly 
communicated to the various centres immediately upon their receipt.  
I would however ask the believers throughout the West to arise 
without any further delay and supplement the publication of the news 
conveyed in this message with an account of previous happenings of 
a similar character, combined with an adequate survey of the aim, the 
principles, and history of the &Baha'i Cause.  
     It is to you, dearly beloved friends of the West, who are the 
standard-bearers of the emancipation and triumph of the &Baha'i Faith, 
that our afflicted brethren of the East have turned their expectant eyes, 
confident that the day cannot be far-distant when, in accordance with 
&Abdu'l-Baha's explicit utterance, the West will "seize the Cause" 
from Persia's fettered hands and lead it to glorious victory.  
     Though grief-stricken and horrified at this cruel blow, let us be on 
our guard lest we give way to despair, lest we forget that in the 
Almighty's inscrutable Wisdom this sudden calamity may prove to be 
but a blessing in disguise.  For what else can it do but to stir the inmost 
depths of our souls, set our faith ablaze, galvanise our efforts, dissolve 
our differences, and provide one of the chief instruments which the 
unhampered promoters of the Faith can utilise to attract the attention, 
enlist the sympathy, and eventually win the allegiance of all mankind?  
     Ours is this supreme opportunity; may we fulfil our trust.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful
throughout the West.  
 
Dearly beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     Grave and manifold as are the problems confronting the struggling 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah, none appear more significant nor seem more 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P52 
compelling in their urgency than the incredible sufferings borne so 
heroically by our down-trodden brethren of the East.  Recent reports 
confirming the news which I have lately communicated to you have all 
emphasised the barbarous severity practised on the innocent followers 
of our Cause.  They reveal the possibility of the extension of this 
agitation, partly instigated for political purposes and selfish motives, 
to neighbouring towns and provinces, and dwell upon the traditional 
slackness of the local authorities to inflict prompt and severe punishment 
upon all the perpetrators of such abominable crimes.  It has been 
ascertained that in the town of Jahrum women have suffered 
martyrdom in a most atrocious manner, that the knife of the criminal 
has mercilessly cut to pieces the body of a child, that a number have 
been severely beaten and injured, their bodies mutilated, their homes 
pillaged, their property confiscated, and the homeless remnants of their 
family abandoned to the mercy of a shameless and tyrannical people.  
In other parts of Persia, and particularly in the province of 
&Adhirbayjan, in the town of &Maraghih, the friends have been pitilessly 
denied the civic rights and privileges extended to every citizen of the 
land.  They have been refused the use of the public bath, and been 
denied access to such shops as provide the necessities of life.  They have 
been declared deprived of the benefit and protection of the law, and all 
association and dealing with them denounced as a direct violation of 
the precepts and principles of &Islam.  It has even been authoritatively 
stated that the decencies of public interment have been refused to their 
dead, and that in a particular case every effort to induce the Moslem 
undertaker to provide the wood for the construction of the coffin failed 
to secure the official support of the authorities concerned.  Every appeal 
made by these harassed &Baha'is on behalf of their brethren, whether 
living or dead, has been met with cold indifference, with vague 
promises, and not infrequently with severe rebuke and undeserved 
chastisement.  
     The tale of such outrageous conduct, such widespread suffering and 
loss, if properly expressed and broadcast, cannot fail in the end to 
arouse the conscience of civilised mankind, and thereby secure the 
much-needed relief for a long-suffering people.  I would, therefore, 
renew my plea, and request you most earnestly to redouble your efforts 
in the wide field of publicity, to devise every possible means that will 
alleviate the fears and sorrows of the silent sufferers in that distracted 
country.  
     Surely these vile wrong-doers cannot long remain unpunished for 
 
+P53 
their ferocious atrocities, and the day may not be far distant when we 
shall witness, as we have observed elsewhere, the promised signs of 
Divine Retribution avenging the blood of the slaughtered servants of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
20 May 1926 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I thank you on behalf of Shoghi Effendi for your letter of May 
8th.  
     He was very glad indeed to learn the names of the newly 
elected London Spiritual Assembly and he wishes them success 
from the bottom of his heart.  He earnestly trusts that throughout 
the coming year they will succeed to give a fresh impetus to the 
progress of the Cause in England and will not be satisfied with 
only mediocre efforts and endeavours.  
     With regard to the election of the Assemblies and your desire 
to have substitutes in order to ensure a steady and easy-to-obtain 
quorum for business, Shoghi Effendi would not like to give you 
any further special regulations but would prefer you to 
communicate with America and follow the method they have 
adopted.  He has a keen desire that uniformity should exist in the 
regulations.  I am sure you would gladly communicate with Mr. 
Horace Holley on the subject.  
     He is so gratified that the case of ... is settled permanently and 
he hopes that in future no such petty misunderstandings will 
come in the way of the steady growth of the Movement, which 
is of the utmost necessity not only in England but throughout 
the world.  
     Shoghi Effendi is well but as usual very busy.  The recent 
atrocities in Persia have been a source of deep grief to his 
heart....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear fellow-worker, 
     In order to avoid misunderstandings and confusion and ensure 
uniformity of method and action I have requested you to conform to the 
 
+P54 
principle adopted by the American friends and Mr. Holley will inform 
you of the method they pursue.  I realise the special and peculiar 
difficulties that prevail in London and the nature of the obstacles with 
which they are confronted.  I feel however that an earnest effort should 
be made to overcome them and that the members must arrange their 
affairs in such a way as to ensure their prompt attendance at 9 
meetings which are held in the course of the year.  This surely is not an 
insurmountable obstacle.  
     I will remember their needs and difficulties in my prayers at the 
Holy Shrines and will continue to supplicate for them Divine guidance 
and blessings.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
28 June 1926 
 
Dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated June 22nd, 1926.  He is most appreciative of the 
many and continuous services you are rendering to the Cause in 
that land.  Your efficiency, sincerity and untiring zeal are great 
assets for the friends in England....  
     Shoghi Effendi fully approves of your suggestion to put a 
royalty on the translations of Dr. Esslemont's book equal to what 
he had arranged for the original.  Not only is that a fair thing to 
do but also it is incumbent upon us to show our appreciation of 
Dr. Esslemont's services to the Cause by safeguarding the interests 
of his family, especially as his wife is an invalid and in need of 
help.  Shoghi Effendi specially wants me to ask you to show 
utmost consideration to her interests.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear fellow-worker, 
     I hope you will assure Mrs. Esslemont on my behalf and express to 
her my warm approval of your suggestion which would safeguard her 
interests and prove of some assistance to her....  
     Assuring you of my earnest prayers for your continued and 
unsparing efforts for the promotion of the Cause you serve so well, 
                                    I am your grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
+P55 
16 July 1926 
 
Dear Mr. Simpson, 
     This is to acknowledge the receipt of your letter to Shoghi 
Effendi dated June 20, 1926.  He is very thankful for what you 
are trying to do for the friends in Persia.  I hope the efforts of the 
whole western friends combined will alleviate this great burden 
which rests upon them, and at least give them the peace and 
comfort which they have been for so long desiring.  
     As to the translation or rather revision of the translation of the 
"Hidden Words".  A year ago, I believe, the American friends 
wrote to Shoghi Effendi and asked him to do it.  Complying 
with their wish he revised his translation and they have published 
it both in paper and leather bound.  Shoghi Effendi believes that 
another edition in England will be useless and perhaps will not 
find the necessary market.  You could buy from America all the 
copies you need.  Nevertheless, if you want to have a new English 
edition you can procure a copy from America.  Shoghi Effendi 
does not believe it necessary to give it a still other revision....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear and able friend, 
     I am in correspondence with Rev. Townshend+ in connexion with 
various alterations in my rendering of the Hidden Words.  I have just 
received his second letter containing suggestions which I greatly 
appreciate and value.  I am hoping to revise it for a third time after my 
correspondence with Mr. T. is over.  I feel you can postpone it for the 
present.  I hope and pray you will succeed in giving wide and effective 
publicity to the atrocities perpetrated in Persia, in the British Press.  It 
is so necessary and important.  We must at all costs capture the heights 
and the British friends have in this connexion a unique and splendid 
opportunity in their own country and amid their own people.  Difficult 
though it be we must persevere and not relax in our efforts.  What 
Martha+F1 has achieved is a great incentive and example.  Your own 
splendid efforts are deeply and lovingly appreciated by me.  
                                                            Shoghi

To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West.  
 
Dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     In the course of the few months that have elapsed since my last 
communication to you regarding the appalling circumstances that have 
culminated in the martyrdom of our Persian brethren in Jahrum, 
events of the highest importance to the future welfare of our beloved 
Cause have transpired, and with startling suddenness conferred abiding 
solace upon those who still have to face the pains and terrors of 
unmitigated and shameless tyranny.  
     You have, most of you I presume, read with thrilling joy in one of 
the recent issues of the "Star of the West" that illuminating account 
given by our beloved sister, Miss Martha Root, wherein she tells with 
her characteristic directness and modesty the story of her moving 
interview with Her Majesty Queen Marie of Rumania and of the 
cordial and ready response which her gentle yet persuasive presentation 
of the principles of the &Baha'i Faith has evoked in the heart of that 
honoured Queen.  One of the visible and potent effects which this 
historic interview proved capable of achieving was the remarkable 
appeal in the form of an open letter which Her Majesty freely and 
spontaneously caused to be published to the world at large testifying in 
a language of exquisite beauty to the power and sublimity of the 
Message of &Baha'u'llah.  
     It was indeed a never-to-be-forgotten occasion when, on the eve of 
the day commemorating the passing of &Baha'u'llah, a handful of us, 
His sorrowing servants, had gathered round His beloved Shrine 
supplicating relief and deliverance for the down-trodden in Persia, to 
receive in the midst of the silence of that distressing hour the glad-tiding 
of this notable triumph which the unbending energy and 
indomitable spirit of our beloved Martha has achieved for our sacred 
Cause.  
     With bowed heads and grateful hearts we recognise in this glowing 
tribute which Royalty has thus paid to the Cause of &Baha'u'llah an 
epoch-making pronouncement destined to herald those stirring events 
which, as &Abdu'l-Baha has prophesied, shall in the fullness of time 
signalise the triumph of God's holy Faith.  For who can doubt but that 
the deeds of those valiant pioneers of the Faith, unexampled though 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P57 
they have been in the abundance of their number and unexcelled in 
their sublime heroism, are but a faint glimmer of what, according to the 
Divine Promise, its steadfast followers are destined to perform?  Those 
heroic exploits that have immortalised the names of its primitive 
adherents will continue to adorn and illuminate the pages of its blood-stained 
history; yet we cannot forget that the period of its full fruition 
with all its promise of world felicity and undreamt-of-achievements is 
yet to be realised, its golden Age yet to unfold.  Indeed, how chastening 
to our pride, how challenging to our enthusiasm, if we but pause for 
a moment amidst the world's many distractions and ponder in our 
hearts the vastness, the compelling urgency, the ineffable glory of what 
still remains unachieved.  
     But let us all remember, in this connexion, that prior to every 
conceivable measure destined to raise the efficiency of our administrative 
activities, more vital than any scheme which the most resourceful 
amongst us can devise, far above the most elaborate structure which the 
concerted efforts of organised Assemblies can hope to raise, is the 
realisation down in the innermost heart of every true believer of 
the regenerating power, the supreme necessity, the unfailing efficacy 
of the Message he bears.  I assure you, dear friends, that nothing short 
of such an immovable conviction could have in days past enabled our 
beloved Cause to weather the blackest storms in its history.  Naught 
else can today vitalise the manifold activities in which unnumbered 
disciples of the Faith are engaged; naught else can provide that driving 
force and sustaining power that are both so essential to the success of 
vast and enduring achievements.  It is this spirit that above all else we 
should sedulously guard, and strive with all our might to fortify and 
exemplify in all our undertakings.  
     Moved by an irresistible impulse, I have addressed to Her Majesty 
in the name of the &Baha'is of both the East and the West a written 
expression of our joyous admiration and gratitude for the queenly 
tribute which Her Majesty has paid to the beauty and nobility of the 
&Baha'i Teachings.  I have, moreover, assured Her Majesty of the far-reaching 
effect which her superb testimony will inevitably produce, 
and of the welcome consolation it has already brought to the silent 
sufferers in that distracted country.  To my message of appreciation and 
gratitude there has come lately a written response, penned by Her 
Majesty, profoundly touching, singularly outspoken, and highly 
significant in the testimony it bears, from this queenly tribute to a 
Divine Ideal I quote these penetrating words:  
 
+P58 
     "Indeed a great light came to me with the Message of &Baha'u'llah 
and &Abdu'l-Baha.  It came as all great messages come at an hour of dire 
grief and inner conflict and distress, so the seed sank deeply....  We 
pass on the Message from mouth to mouth and all those we give it to 
see a light suddenly lighting before them and much that was obscure 
and perplexing becomes simple, luminous and full of hope as never 
before.  That my open letter was balm to those suffering for the Cause 
is indeed a great happiness to me, and I take it as a sign that God 
accepted my humble tribute....  With bowed head I recognise that I 
too am but an instrument in greater Hands and rejoice in the 
knowledge...."  
     Dear friends, with feelings of profound emotion we recall the 
glowing promises that have so often fallen from the lips of our departed 
Master, and with throbbing hearts rejoice in the gradual realisation of 
His most cherished desire.  
     And as we call to mind the circumstances that have led to such a 
notable advance, we are filled with admiration for that unique and 
great-hearted apostle of &Baha'u'llah, our dearly-beloved Martha Root, 
who under trying circumstances and almost single-handed in her 
efforts, has so wonderfully paved the way for the universal recognition 
of the Cause of God.  In her case we have verily witnessed in an 
unmistakable manner what the power of dauntless faith, when coupled 
with sublimity of character, can achieve, what forces it can release, to 
what heights it can rise.  
     Let such remarkable revelations of the reality and continuity of the 
Divine Purpose, made manifest from time to time to us His feeble 
children serve to fortify our faith in Him, to warm the chill which 
fleeting misfortunes may leave behind, and fill us with that Celestial 
potency which alone can enable us to withstand the storm and stress 
that lives dedicated to His service must needs encounter.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
23 October 1926 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letters dated October 3rd and 10th, 1926.  He wishes me 
especially to mention how appreciative he is of your many 
 
+P59 
services so efficiently and devotingly rendered.  He will pray for 
you and for the other members of the London Group that 
through your combined efforts an unprecedented progress be 
made there and numerous persons attracted to the precepts of the 
Cause.  
     Concerning the attendance of certain individuals at the 
meeting of the Assemblies and at the invitation of that body.  
This, Shoghi Effendi considers, to be as expert advice which is 
absolutely necessary for good administration.  The members of 
the Assembly are not supposed to know everything on every 
subject, so they can invite a person, versed in that question, to 
attend their meetings and explain his views.  But naturally he 
will have no right to vote....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear and precious co-worker, 
     I am glad and grateful to feel that the joint efforts of Martha and 
Mountfort+F1 have given a fresh impetus to the promotion of the Cause 
in Great Britain.  I trust that the collective and individual efforts of the 
members of the British Spiritual Assemblies will serve to consolidate 
the work already achieved.  I should be pleased to receive if available 
full copies of any newspapers in Great Britain that may have published 
the appreciations broadcast by the Queen of Rumania.  The entire 
issue of the papers--not clippings--will be of great significance to the 
friends in Persia.  Ten copies of each would be sufficient.  I wish also to 
request you to urge all the friends in Great Britain to subscribe to the 
"Messager &Baha'i" published by Mrs. Stannard in Geneva.  It is 
essential and valuable.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
29 October 1926+F2  
 
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West.  
 
Dear fellow-workers in the Divine Vineyard!  
     It will gladden and rejoice every one of you to learn that from 
 
+F1 Martha Root and Mountfort Mills.  
+F2 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P60 
various quarters there has of late reached the Holy Land tidings of 
fresh developments that are a clear indication of those hidden and 
transforming influences which, from the source of &Baha'u'llah's mystic 
strength, continue to flow with ever-increasing vitality into the heart 
of this troubled world.  
     Both in the wider field of its spiritual conquests, where its 
indomitable spirit is forging ahead, capturing the heights, pervading 
the multitude; as well as in the gradual consolidation of the 
administrative structure which its avowed followers the world over are 
labouring to raise and fortify, the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, we can 
increasingly discern, bids fair to become that force which, though not 
as yet universally recognised, none can afford to belittle or ignore.  
     In the bold and repeated testimonies which Her Majesty, Queen 
Marie of Rumania, has chosen to give to the world--a copy of whose 
latest pronouncement I enclose--we truly recognise evidences of the 
irresistible power, the increasing vitality, the strange working of a 
Faith destined to regenerate the world.  Her Majesty's striking tribute 
paid to the illuminative power of the Teachings of &Baha'u'llah and 
&Abdu'l-Baha is bound to effect an entire transformation in the attitude 
of many to a Faith the tenets of which have often been misunderstood 
and sorely neglected.  It will serve as a fresh stimulus to the enlightened 
and cultured to investigate with an open mind the verities of its 
message, the source of its life-giving principles.  
     From &Baghdad, moreover, where the sacred habitation of &Baha'u'llah 
has been violated by a relentless enemy and converted into a rallying 
centre for the corrupt, the perverse, and the fanatical, there comes the 
news, highly reassuring to us all, of the satisfactory progress of the 
negotiations which, we are informed on high authority, will soon lead 
to the expropriation of the property by the State, culminating in the 
fullness of time in its occupation by the triumphant followers of God's 
holy Faith.  The case of the houses, so ably presented, so persistently 
pursued, above all reinforced by the vigilant and protecting power of 
our departed Master, will eventually triumph, and by its repercussions 
in Persia as in the world at large, will lend a powerful impetus to the 
liberation of those forces which will carry the Cause to its ultimate 
destiny.  I will, when the occasion presents itself, inform the believers 
through their respective National Spiritual Assemblies to address 
messages of appreciation and gratitude to the Authorities concerned in 
view of their unrelaxing efforts for the triumph of Right and Justice.  
     For the present, we cannot but rejoice and feel profoundly thankful 
 
+P61 
as we witness in so many directions the welcome signs of the gradual 
emancipation of the struggling Faith of &Baha'u'llah, of the increasing 
recognition on the part of both the high and lowly of its universal 
principles--all so rich in their promise of ultimate victory.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
29 November 1926 
 
Dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter dated November 14th, 1926, together with the minutes of 
the 18th meeting of the National Assembly, held on October 
23rd 1926.  He has received the 200 copies of the 4th edition of 
the folder and desires to thank you for them.  
     The question of incorporating the National Assembly is very 
important for though at present there may not be any important 
business which necessitates that, one may arise at any time.  There 
is also some advantage in being ready for any future developments.  
But naturally such a step should be taken after consultation 
with competent lawyers lest some defect may in the future cause 
some inconveniences.  
     What Shoghi Effendi desires to have are clippings of any 
article written by the Queen of Rumania on subjects referring to 
the Cause and published in England.  He has received such 
declarations or open letters from America and wishes to know 
what she is doing along those lines in England which is her own 
native home.  It is really wonderful how boldly she is advocating 
this Cause absolutely regardless of what others may say.  This is 
a very good lesson for those who being &Baha'is keep in the dark 
so as not to be criticised and perhaps ostracised by so called 
society people.  
     We are eagerly awaiting to meet Miss Rosenberg and Mrs. 
Slade+ to obtain a first hand information of the condition of the 
Cause in England and the extent to which Mr. Mills and Miss 
Root have succeeded to improve it.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
My dearly-beloved co-worker:  
     I am hoping that our deliberations with our English &Baha'i visitors 
 
+P62 
will assist and aid the work in which you are engaged and prove 
beneficial to the Cause in general.  I feel that the opportunities now 
open to the friends are greater than ever before and I will pray that the 
measures they undertake will redound to the glory, the power and 
effectiveness of the Cause.  The utterances of the Rumanian Queen 
should be given the fullest possible publicity and be fully utilised as I 
feel they are of great significance and value.  More power to your 
elbow!  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
29 January 1927 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend, Mr. Simpson, 
     Thank you so very much for your clear good letter of Jan. 
16th--Shoghi Effendi bids me say how much pleasure he always 
derives from the perusal of your letters--which are always 
expressed with such admirable clearness, and to the point.  He has 
just now been discussing with me the various matters you 
mention.  
     He says that in one way we are not quite correct in the way 
we manage our elections for the National Assembly--Shoghi 
Effendi says that the intention is, that when once the 19 delegates 
have been elected by the friends of the respective centres in the 
proportions you mention, i.e. 12 delegates from among the 
London friends, five from the Manchester friends, and two from 
the Bournemouth group, that then, these 19 delegates assembled 
should choose by secret ballot from the whole body of the 
believers in Gt. Britain and Ireland, the nine friends they consider 
most suitable as members of the National Assembly.  Heretofore, 
as I understand it, it has rather been our practice that the 12 
London delegates elected six from the London friends--the 
Manchester five delegates elected two from Manchester and the 
Bournemouth delegates elected one from Bournemouth.  But, 
Shoghi Effendi says, all the 19 delegates must clearly understand 
that they must select from the whole body of the believers in Gt. 
Britain and Ireland those 9 whom they consider the most fit and 
suitable members to constitute the National Assembly.  Therefore 
it will be necessary to supply each of the 19 delegates with a 
complete list of all those believers in Gt. Britain and Ireland.  
From that complete list of course must be eliminated all those 
who from one cause or another are unable to serve on the 
 
+P63 
National Assembly.  Also--Shoghi Effendi says that those 19 
elected delegates should if possible meet during the Feast of 
&Ridvan in London thus forming as it were a baby Convention!  
I had not realised before that the annual &Baha'i Convention in 
the U.S.A. consists solely of those delegates who had been chosen 
by their respective Centres in order that they may elect the 9 to 
form the National Assembly of that country.  Did you understand 
this?  I certainly did not.  As Shoghi Effendi points out--it is quite 
possible that--e.g. in the future--7 members might be elected 
from the Manchester friends and only two from London!  On 
the other hand--it is quite possible that all nine members chosen 
by the 19 delegates might be from the London group.  Of course, 
on reflection one sees clearly that the proceedings must be as now 
described because in the future there may be 21 or 53 separate 
local Assemblies in Gt. Britain just as is now the case in the 
U.S.A.--and it would obviously be impossible for each of these 
Assemblies to elect one of their number to sit as their 
representative on the National Assembly.  No doubt I ought to 
have understood this before--but I must confess I did not!...  
     It is very grievous that our dear Mrs. Cropper should have 
been so ill--we have all been praying for her recovery since we 
knew of it and I am thankful to hear she is now making steady 
progress.  
     Since writing to you I too have had a bad influenza cold that 
swept through our house.  But I am now quite recovered I am 
glad to say.  
     With all best wishes to yourself.  
                                    Your sincere friend in His service, 
                                                            Ethel Rosenberg 
 
P.S.  I have just remembered I have said nothing about the 
London area that should be included--Shoghi Effendi thinks it 
would save trouble if you drew your circle widely enough to 
include Mrs. Slade and her daughter!  At first he inclined to agree 
with you that it would be best to take the middle one--the 
Postal Area--and make exceptions in favour of Mrs. Haybittel 
and her daughter.  (Mrs. Ginman+ I hear from my brother has 
moved into town now) but it seemed to him that you might 
possibly have other friends residing or moving out to Surbiton 
etc., so that it might save you trouble in the future if you selected 
 
+P64 
the widest area?  This is merely a suggestion on his part--as it 
will no doubt be decided at the meeting of the London Assembly.  
But with regard to the choosing by the 19 delegates of the nine 
members of the National Assembly, his instructions are quite 
definite and must not be departed from--as these instructions 
are as laid down by the Master in the Testament and other 
Tablets.  Shoghi Effendi says you can even now soon select the 
day for the 19 delegates to come to London during &Ridvan.  By 
the way &Ridvan begins exactly 31 days after the New Year so it 
starts almost always on April 21st and lasts for 12 days.  I have 
recorded my notes on list enclosed.  
                                    Yours ever, 
                                                            E. Rosenberg 
     Shoghi+F1 Effendi emphatically urges that the 19 friends elected as 
delegates should meet together during &Ridvan--Shoghi Effendi 
has sent you three copies of the &Baha'i Year Book, one for 
London, one for Manchester and one for Bournemouth.  
                                    Read and approved.      Shoghi 
 
Editor's Note:  
     From December 1926 to April 1927, while the secretary who was then 
helping with the English correspondence was away from Haifa, Miss Ethel J. 
Rosenberg (addressed in letters by the Guardian as "My dear Rosa"), was on 
pilgrimage and kept up a lengthy and repetitive correspondence with George 
P. Simpson.  In these letters from Miss Rosenberg are many instructions from 
the Guardian to the British National Assembly.  The letter reproduced in this 
compilation, dated January 29th, 1927 is important for many reasons:  
 
 1.  It is the only one from Miss Rosenberg which carried the handwriting of 
     Shoghi Effendi where he "Approved" what had been written.  
 2.  It outlined the principle for the election of the National Spiritual 
     Assembly by delegates which the British N.S.A. had not then appreciated 
     from the earlier letters of the Guardian (of 1923, 1294, 1925, later 
     published in "&Baha'i Administration").  
 3.  It insisted upon Convention being held in London during &Ridvan.  
 4.  It clarified the need to have a recognised voting area for London but left 
     the final decision to the local Spiritual Assembly of London.  
 
     As a result of this letter 13 delegates attended Convention and 4 voted by 
post; ten members were elected to the National Assembly (Guardian's letter of 
May, 13th, 1927 refers), and the London area was defined as having a radius of 
36 miles.

To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West.  
 
Dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha:  
     The trend of various events, affecting directly and indirectly the 
interests of the &Baha'i Cause, have of late served to bring into further 
prominence the character as well as the significance of a Faith destined 
to regenerate the world.  
     Of all the diverse issues which today are gradually tending to 
consolidate and extend the bounds of the Revelation of &Baha'u'llah, the 
decision of Egypt's religious Tribunal regarding the &Baha'is under its 
jurisdiction appears at the present moment to be the most powerful in 
its challenge, the most startling in its character, and the most perplexing 
in the consequences it may entail.  I have already alluded in my letter 
of January 10, 1926, addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &Baha'is of the United States and Canada, to a particular feature 
of this momentous verdict, which after mature deliberation has obtained 
the sanction of Egypt's highest ecclesiastical authorities, has been 
communicated and printed, and is regarded as final and binding.  I have 
stressed in my last reference to this far-reaching pronouncement the 
negative aspect of this document which condemns in most unequivocal 
and emphatic language the followers of &Baha'u'llah as the believers in 
heresy, offensive and injurious to &Islam, and wholly incompatible with 
the accepted doctrines and practice of its orthodox adherents.  
     A closer study of the text of the decision will, however, reveal the 
fact that coupled with this strong denunciation is the positive assertion 
of a truth which the recognised opponents of the &Baha'i Faith in other 
Muhammadan countries have up to the present time either sedulously 
ignored or maliciously endeavoured to disprove.  Not content with this 
harsh and unjustifiable repudiation of the so-called menacing and 
heretical doctrines of the adherents of the &Baha'i Faith, they proceed in 
a formal manner to declare in the text of that very decision their belief, 
that the &Baha'i Faith is a "new religion", "entirely independent" and, 
by reason of the magnitude of its claim and the character of its "laws, 
principles and beliefs," worthy to be reckoned as one of the established 
religious systems of the world.  Quoting various passages judiciously 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P66 
gleaned from a number of &Baha'i sacred Books as an evidence to their 
splendid testimony, they proceed in a notable statement to deduce the 
fact that henceforth it shall be regarded as impossible for the followers 
of such a Faith to be designated as Muslim, just as it would be incorrect 
and erroneous to call a Muhammadan either Christian or Jew.  
     It cannot be denied that in the course of the inevitable developments 
of this present situation the resident &Baha'is of Egypt, originally 
belonging to the Muslim Faith, will be placed in a most humiliating 
and embarrassing position.  They, however, cannot but rejoice in the 
knowledge that whereas in various Muhammadan countries and 
particularly in Persia the overwhelming majority of the leaders of 
&Islam are utterly opposed to any form of declaration that would 
facilitate the universal recognition of the Cause, the authorised heads 
of their co-religionists in one of the most advanced communities in the 
Muhammadan world have, of their own initiative, published to the 
world a document that may justly be termed as the first charter of 
liberty emancipating the &Baha'i Faith from the fetters of orthodox 
&Islam.  And in order to insure the complete rupture of &Baha'i official 
relations with Muslim Courts they lay down in unmistakable terms 
the condition that under no circumstances can the marriage of those 
&Baha'is who have been required to divorce their Muslim wives be 
renewed by the Muslim Court unless and until the husbands formally 
recant their faith by solemnly declaring that the &Qur'an is the "last" 
Book of God revealed to man, that no law can abrogate the Prophet's 
Law, no faith can succeed His Faith, no revelation can claim to fulfill 
His Revelation.  
     While unwavering in their belief in the Divine station of the 
Author of the &Qur'an and profoundly convinced of the necessity and 
worldwide influence of His Divine mission, &Baha'is in every land 
stand undeterred and unabashed in the face of the strong condemnation 
pronounced against their brethren in Egypt.  Indeed, they together with 
their fellow-workers in all Muslim countries welcome with gladness 
and pride every opportunity for further emancipation that they may 
set forth in a truer light the sublime mission of &Baha'u'llah.  
     In the face of such an outspoken and challenging declaration, the 
&Baha'is of the West cannot but feel the deepest sympathy with their 
Egyptian brethren who, for the sake of our beloved Cause and its 
deliverance, have to face all the embarrassments and vexations which 
the severance of old-established ties must necessarily entail.  They will, 
however, most certainly expect every staunch and loyal believer in the 
 
+P67 
Faith who resides in that land to refrain in view of the grave warning 
uttered expressly by our opponents, from any practice that would in 
any manner constitute in the eyes of a critical and vigilant enemy a 
repudiation of the fundamental beliefs of the people of &Baha.  They will 
most assuredly, whenever the moment is opportune, step forth with 
eager hearts to offer every support in their power to their fellow-workers 
who, with stout hearts and irreproachable loyalty, will 
continue to hold aloft the standard of God's struggling Faith.  They 
will not fail to come to the rescue of those who with joyous confidence 
will endure to the very end such vicissitudes as this New Day of God, 
now in its birth-throes, must needs suffer and surmount.  
     We cannot believe that as the Movement grows in strength, in 
authority and influence, the perplexities and the sufferings it has had 
to contend with in the past will correspondingly decrease and vanish.  
Nay, as it grows from strength to strength, the fanatical defendants of 
the strongholds of orthodoxy, whatever be their denomination, realising 
the penetrating influence of this growing Faith, will arise and strain 
every nerve to extinguish its light and discredit its name.  For has not 
our beloved &Abdu'l-Baha sent forth His glowing prophecy from behind 
the prison walls of the citadel of &Akka--words so significant in their 
forecast of the coming world turmoil, yet so rich in their promise of 
eventual victory:--  
     "How great, how very great is the Cause; how very fierce the 
onslaught of all the peoples and kindreds of the earth!  Erelong 
shall the clamour of the multitude throughout Africa, throughout 
America, the cry of the European and of the Turk, the groaning 
of India and China be heard from far and near.  One and all they 
shall arise with all their power to resist His Cause.  Then shall the 
Knights of the Lord, assisted by grace from on high, strengthened 
by faith, aided by the power of understanding and reinforced by 
the legions of the Covenant, arise and make manifest the truth of 
the verse:  `Behold the confusion that hath befallen the tribes of 
the defeated!'"  
     Dearly beloved friends, upon us devolves the supreme obligation to 
stand by His side, to fight His battles and to win His victory.  May we 
prove ourselves worthy of this trust.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dearly-beloved friends:  
     With feelings of horror and indignation I communicate to you the 
tale of yet another tragedy involving the shedding of the blood of a 
martyr of the Faith on Persia's sacred soil.  I have before me, as I pen 
these lines, the report of the local Spiritual Assembly of &Ardibil, a 
town on the north-east confines of the province of &Adhirbayjan, not far 
distant from those hallowed spots where the &Bab suffered His last 
confinement and martyrdom.  Addressed to the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the &Baha'is of Persia, this report recounts in simple but 
moving language the circumstances that have led to the cowardly crime 
committed in the darkness of the night at the instigation of the fanatical 
clergy--the deadliest opponents of the Faith in that town.  
     Our martyred brother, &Aminu'l-'Ulama by name had for some 
time past become notorious in the eyes of the Muslim inhabitants of 
&Ardibil for his tenacity of faith by openly refusing at every instance to 
vilify and renounce his most cherished convictions.  In the latter part 
of &Ramadan--the month associated with prayer, pious deeds and 
fasting--his use of the public bath--that long-established institution 
the amenities and privileges of which are as a rule accorded only to the 
adherents of the Muslim Faith--had served to inflame the mob, and 
to provide a scheming instigator with a pretext to terminate his life.  In 
the market-place he was ridiculed and condemned as an apostate of the 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P69 
Faith of &Islam, who, by boldly rejecting the repeated entreaties 
showered upon him to execrate the &Baha'i name, had lawfully incurred 
the penalty of immediate death at the hands of every pious upholder of 
the Muslim tradition.  
     In spite of the close surveillance exercised by a body of guards 
stationed around his house, in response to the intercession of his friends 
with the local authorities, the treacherous criminal found his way into 
his home, and on the night of the 22nd of &Ramadan, corresponding 
with the 26th of March 1927, assailed him in a most atrocious and 
dastardly manner.  Concealing within the folds of his garment his 
unsheathed dagger, he approached his victim and claiming the need of 
whispering a confidential message in his ears plunged the weapon hilt-deep 
into his vitals, cutting across his ribs and mutilating his body.  
Every attempt to secure immediate medical assistance seems to have 
been foiled by malicious devices on the part of the associates of this 
merciless criminal, and the helpless victim after a few hours of 
agonising pain surrendered his soul to his Beloved.  His friends and 
fellow-believers, alarmed at the prospect of a fresh outbreak that would 
inevitably result were his mortal remains to be accorded the ordinary 
privileges of a decent burial, decided to inter his body in one of the two 
rooms that served as his own dwelling, seeking thereby to appease the 
fury of an unrelenting foe.  
     He leaves behind in desperate poverty a family of minors with no 
support but their mother, expectant to bring forth her child, and with 
no hope of relief from their &non-Baha'i relatives in whose eyes they 
deserve to be treated only with the meanest contempt.  
     It appears from the above-mentioned report that the merciless 
assailant has been arrested, waiting, however, as has been the case 
with similar incidents in southern Persia, to be sooner or later released 
under the pressure of bribery and intimidation sedulously exercised by 
an impenitent enemy.  
     Dearest friends!  Any measure of publicity the concerted efforts of 
the &Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies of the West, on whom almighty 
Providence has conferred the inestimable benefits of religious toleration 
and freedom, can accord to this latest manifestation of unbridled 
barbarism in Persia will be most opportune and valuable.  It will, I am 
certain, confer abiding solace to those disconsolate sufferers who with 
sublime heroism continue to uphold the traditions of their beloved 
Faith.  Our one weapon lies in our prayerful efforts, intelligently and 
persistently pursued, to arouse by every means at our disposal the 
 
+P70 
conscience of unheeding humanity, and to direct the attention of men 
of vision and authority to these incredibly odious acts which in their 
ferocity and frequency cannot but constitute in the eyes of every fair-minded 
observer the gravest challenge to all that is sacred and precious 
in our present day civilisation.

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I thank you on behalf of our dear Guardian for your welcome 
letter of the 2nd.  
     It was with unbounded joy and great hopes for the future that 
we learnt of the success of your first National Convention.  May 
it prove to be the beginning of a new era of achievement and 
expansion in the field of service.  Time was when individually 
we had to drink deep from the all-satisfying teachings of the 
&Baha'i Faith, and although this is far from being accomplished 
yet it is time for us to share with many others what we firmly 
believe....  
     Miss Rosenberg left only a few days ago and I suppose she will 
arrive back home earlier than this letter.  
     As she will have plenty of news to give you I hardly need add 
any....  

          [From the Guardian:]
My dear and valued co-worker:  
     Although I rejoice at your appointment as member of the National 
and local Assemblies, I fully sympathise with you in your arduous 
work and responsibilities, for all of which you are so distinctly equipped 
and qualified.  I feel that next year, the number of members should be 
strictly confined to nine, and a second ballot is quite proper and 
 
+P71 
justified.+F1  I trust that the choice of Rev. Biggs signifies his unreserved 
acceptance of the Faith in its entirety--a condition that we must 
increasingly stress in the years that come.  Please assure the elected 
members of my love, my best wishes and of my ardent prayers for them 
all individually and collectively that the Beloved may guide them, and 
reinforce their efforts for the spread of our beloved Cause.  
                                    Your true brother,

     He is glad to see the well chosen members each undertaking 
his suitable task with the chairman shining amongst them.  
However he trusts that the coming year may be one of renewed 
activity and greater accomplishment.  Let us not be loiterers in a 
fast-flying world especially when we know to what grave and 
universal ills this Cause is a divine remedy....

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I am instructed by our dear Shoghi Effendi to thank you for 
your letter of Dec. 31st with enclosures all of which he was very 
glad and interested to read.  
     With regard to Miss Pinchon's+ book, Shoghi Effendi feels 
that if she herself and the Assembly in London feel that the 
arrangement with the London branch of Brentano's is really to 
her advantage, he would then be glad to endorse it.  The 
arguments you had brought were really very favourable and 
that might help the success of the book in America.  Moreover, 
he would wish you to thank Asgarzadeh for his commitment in 
helping the Assembly to promise a sum of fifty pounds.  Shoghi 
Effendi has liked the book immensely and trusts that it may 
render great services and fulfil all our hopes.  
     He has taken notice of your solicitor's answer with regard to 
official recognition by the Board of Trade and thinks your view 
of the subject perfectly sound.  Will the answer of the Board of 
Trade prove a stimulus to the friends in England and help to 
multiply their numbers and establish the Faith?...  
 
+P73 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am so glad to have the opportunity of reaffirming in person my 
deep affection for, and unshaken confidence in, you as well as my 
growing appreciation of your ability and constancy in service.  I am 
delighted at the prospect of the joint publication of Miss Pinchon's 
admirable book in London and in New York, and I would leave all 
subsidiary matters in this connexion to the National Assembly and 
Miss Pinchon herself.  I wish to order beforehand 50 copies of her book 
at whatever price the publishers will fix the rate of its sale, and will 
gladly send through you the amount whenever seems to you the most 
suitable time.  Kindly assure the friends of my continued prayers at the 
Holy Shrines for their welfare and the success of their arduous yet 
noble task.  
                                    Affectionately,

8 February 1928 
 
My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I am instructed by our dear Guardian to thank you for your 
letter of Jan. 29th with the minutes of the regular meeting of the 
English N.S.A. enclosed.  
     He has read both your letter and the minutes with interest and 
pleasure.  He trusts that your next list of electors will show 
marked progress and your weekly meetings at Lindsay Hall will 
attract new and enlightened people.  It is strange that the English 
&Baha'is have really contributed a great deal to the Cause, and in 
the form of books and publications given us works of real and 
permanent value--perhaps proportionately more than America, 
and yet it is such a Herculean affair to bring in new fellow-workers.  
Perhaps just that difficulty is a sign of their merit--
staunch and unflinching adherence once they believe in 
something.  
     In connection with the form in which new electors are to be 
admitted into the Cause, our Guardian will personally append 
his suggestions if any.  You would do well to see what the 
American system is.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes very much that Miss Pinchon's book 
will prove a "good-seller" in England also.  Perhaps in being less 
scholarly it might prove more popular and widely read....

To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West.  
 
Dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha, 
     Events of a startling character and of the utmost significance to the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah, have recently transpired throughout the Near 
and Middle East in such rapid succession, that I feel moved to write 
about them to those who, in distant lands and with eager hearts, are 
waiting to witness the fulfilment of the prophecies of &Baha'u'llah.  You 
will, I am certain, rejoice with me to learn that the quickening forces 
of internal reform are swiftly awakening from their age-long slumber 
of negligence those lands which, trodden by the feet of &Baha'u'llah and 
wherein are enshrined the memorable scenes of His birth, His ministry, 
His exiles, His banishments, His suffering and His ascension, are 
destined in the fullness of time to play a pre-eminent &role in the 
regeneration of the East--nay of all mankind.  
     From Persia, the cradle of our Faith and the object of our tenderest 
affections, there breaks upon us the news of the first stirrings of that 
social and political Reformation which, as we firmly believe, is but the 
direct and unavoidable consequence of that great spiritual Revival 
ushered in by the Revelation of &Baha'u'llah.  These social and political 
forces now released by the Source of such a tremendous Revival are 
bound in their turn to demolish one by one the barriers that have so 
long impeded its flow, sapped its vitality and obscured its radiance.  
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P76 
     From a communication addressed to me recently by the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Persia, as well as from reliable 
reports submitted by the local representatives of the Persian believers, 
and confirmed by the vivid narrative of visiting pilgrims, it is becoming 
increasingly manifest that the glowing promises so many times uttered 
by our departed Master are, with extraordinary exactitude and 
remarkable swiftness, being successively fulfilled.  Reforms of a 
revolutionary character are, without bloodshed and with negligible 
resistance, gradually transforming the very basis and structure of 
Persia's primitive society.  The essentials of public security and order 
are being energetically provided throughout the length and breadth of 
the &Shah's domain, and are hailed with particular gratification by that 
much harassed section of the population--our long-suffering brethren 
of that land.  The rapidity, the incredible ease, with which the 
enlightened proposals of its government, in matters of education, trade 
and finance, means of transportation and travel, and the development 
of the country's internal resources, are receiving the unqualified 
sanction of a hitherto reactionary Legislature, and are overcoming the 
resistance and apathy of the masses, have undoubtedly tended to hasten 
the emancipation of our Persian brethren from the remaining fetters 
of a once despotic and blood-stained regime.  The severely repressive 
and humiliating measures undertaken on the initiative of progressive 
provincial Governors, and with the connivance of State officials in the 
Capital, aiming at the scattering and ultimate extinction of a rapidly 
waning clergy, such as degradation, detainment, deportation and in 
some cases pitiless execution, are paving the way for the entire removal 
of the shackles imposed by an ignorant and fanatical priesthood upon 
the administration of State affairs.  In matters of dress; in the obligatory 
enforcement of a uniform style of national head-gear; in the strict 
limitation of the number, the rights and the prerogatives of high 
ecclesiastical officials; in the growing unpopularity of the veil among 
almost every section of society; in the marked distinction which 
unofficially and in various phases of public life is being made by an 
enlightened and pressing minority between the tottering forms of a 
discredited Ecclesiasticism and the civil rights and duties of civilised 
society; in the general laxity in religious observances and ceremonies; 
in the slow and hidden process of secularisation invading many a 
Government department under the courageous guidance of the 
Governors of outlying provinces--in all of these a discerning eye can 
easily discover the symptoms that augur well for a future that is sure 
to witness the formal and complete separation of Church and State.  
 
+P77 
     To this uplifting movement, various external factors are being 
added that are tending to hasten and stimulate this process of internal 
regeneration so significant in the life of renascent Persia.  The 
multiplicity and increasing facilities in the means of transportation 
and travel; the State visit of energetic and enlightened reformers to 
Persia's capital; the forthcoming and widely-advertised journey of the 
&Shah himself to the progressive capitals of Western Europe; the 
repercussion of Turkey's astounding reforms among an essentially 
sensitive and receptive people; the loud and persistent clamour of a 
revolting order in Russia against the evil domination and dark 
plottings of all forms of religious sectarianism; the relentless vigour 
with which &Afghanistan's ambitious Ruler, reinforced by the example 
of his gracious Consort, is pursuing his campaign of repression against 
a similar order of a corrupted clergy at home--all tend to lend their 
force in fostering and fashioning that public opinion which can alone 
provide an enduring basis for the reform Movement destined to usher 
in that golden Era craved for by the followers of the Faith in 
&Baha'u'llah's native land.  
     As a direct consequence of the birth of this new consciousness in the 
life of the nation, as evidenced by these early stirrings in the minds of 
the people, both high and low, meetings of an elaborate character, 
unprecedented in the number of their attendants, in the tone of the 
public addresses, in the undisturbed atmosphere of their proceedings, 
and the general impressiveness of their organisation, have been 
publicly held in &Tihran, under the auspices of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the &Baha'is of Persia.  Particularly significant and 
impressive were those that were held in the &Haziratu'l-Quds, the 
administrative and spiritual centre of the Faith in the Capital, on 
the occasion of the twin Festivals commemorating the declaration of 
the &Bab and the birth of &Abdu'l-Baha, at the chief of which no less 
than two thousand representative &Baha'is and &non-Baha'is, leaders of 
public opinion, State officials and foreign representatives were officially 
invited.  The addresses stressing the universality of the Teachings of 
the Cause, the formal and ordered character of the proceedings so 
unusual a feature to a gathering of such proportions, the mingling of 
the &Baha'is with the recognised representatives of progressive thought 
in the Capital who, by virtue of their high office and stately 
appearance, lent colour and weight to the concourse of attending 
believers, have all contributed to enhance the brilliance and spiritual 
significance of that gathering on that memorable occasion.  
     Moreover, reports of a highly encouraging nature are being 
 
+P78 
continually received from local Assemblies and individual believers, 
giving the names and stating the numbers of influential Persians who, 
hitherto reluctant to declare openly their faith in &Baha'u'llah, are as a 
result of this reassuring and promising state of affairs emerging from 
the obscurity of their concealment and enlisting under the erected 
banner of &Baha'u'llah.  This has served to embolden the followers of the 
Faith to take the necessary steps, under the direction of their local 
Assemblies, for the institution of &Baha'i schools, for the holding of 
public gatherings, for the establishment of &Baha'i hostels, libraries and 
public baths, for the construction of official headquarters for their 
administrative work, and for the gradual execution among themselves, 
within the limits imposed upon them by the State, of the laws and 
ordinances revealed in the &Kitab-i-Aqdas.  Words fail me to describe 
the feelings of those patiently suffering brethren of ours in that land, 
who, with eyes dim with tears and hearts overflowing with 
thanksgiving and praise, are witnessing on every side and with 
increasing force the unfoldment of a Faith which they have served so 
well and love so dearly.  Accounts pathetic and inspiring in their tone 
are being received from that steadfast and cheerful band of exultant 
believers, and are being shared with the resident friends in the Holy 
Land who, having had the privilege of close and continued association 
with the person of &Abdu'l-Baha, cannot but marvel at the range, the 
potency and accuracy of the prophecies of their departed Master.  
     From Turkey, on whose soil, for well nigh three score years and ten, 
were enacted some of the sublimest and most tragic scenes in the annals 
of the Cause; Turkey, under whose rule &Baha'u'llah twice proclaimed 
Himself, was thrice exiled and banished, and finally ascended to the 
&Abha Kingdom, and where &Abdu'l-Baha spent more than fifty years 
of His Life, in incarceration and suffering; has of late been rudely 
awakened to a Call which it has so long obstinately despised and 
ignored.  Following on the overthrow of that effete theocracy, resting 
on the twin institutions of the Caliphate and Sultanate--those two 
sinister forces that have combined to inflict the deadliest blows to our 
beloved Faith in the earliest stages of its infancy and growth--an 
uncompromising policy aiming at the secularisation of the State and 
the disestablishment of &Islam was initiated and carried out with 
exemplary vigour.  Religious institutions and monastic orders which 
under the guise of religious propaganda were converted into hotbeds of 
political intrigue and sedition were peremptorily closed, their adherents 
scattered and banished, their funds confiscated, their privileges and 
 
+P79 
prerogatives abolished.  None, save the little band of &Baha'u'llah's 
devoted followers, escaped the trenchant axe of the pitiless reformer; 
all, without fear or favour, had to submit to his searching investigations, 
his dictatorial edicts, his severe and irrevocable judgment.  Lately, 
however, the Turkish Government, faithful to its policy of ceaseless 
vigilance, and fearful of the growing activities of the &Baha'is under its 
rule, decided to order the Police in the town of Smyrna to conduct a 
close investigation into the purpose, the character and the effects of 
&Baha'i activity in that town.  No sooner were the representative &Baha'is 
in that locality arrested and conducted to the Law Courts for purposes 
of investigation, than the President of the &Baha'i Spiritual Assembly 
of Constantinople who, having read in the morning papers the report 
of the Smyrna incident, had resolved unsummoned to offer the 
necessary explanations to the authorities concerned, was in his turn 
arrested and taken to the Police Headquarters where he soon afterwards 
was joined by the other members of the Assembly.  The official 
searching of their homes, the seizure of whatever &Baha'i literature they 
had in their possession, their twenty-four hours' detention at the Police 
station, the searching severity of the cross-examination to which they 
were subjected--all proved powerless to alarm and shake the faith of 
those intrepid champions of the Cause, or to evince anything 
detrimental to the best interests of the State.  On the contrary, they 
served to deeply impress upon the minds and hearts of the officials 
concerned the sublimity, the innocence, and the dynamic force of the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  So much so that their books were returned, a 
genuine desire to deepen their knowledge of the Cause was expressed 
by their examiners, and widespread publicity, as reflected in the articles 
of about a dozen leading newspapers of Turkey, was accorded by the 
Government, proclaiming the innocence of the Cause and lifting up 
the ban that now so oppressively weighs upon religious institutions in 
Turkey.  
     From Constantinople in European Turkey to the eastern confines 
of Anatolia, on the banks of the river Euphrates, where a small and 
flourishing &Baha'i Community has been recently established, a wave 
of public interest, criticism and inquiry has been sweeping over the 
surface of the land, as witnessed by the character and number of the 
leading articles, the illustrations and caricatures that have appeared in 
the most prominent newspapers of the capital and the provincial towns 
of Asiatic Turkey.  Not only Turkey, but its neighbouring countries 
of the East and the West, have lifted up their voice in the vindication 
 
+P80 
of the &Baha'i truth.  From information thus far gathered we learn that 
in Hungary, in &Iraq, Egypt and Syria, and as far west as France and 
England, newspapers have, of their own accord, with varying degree 
of accuracy, and in more or less detail, reported this incident in their 
columns, and have given, unasked and unaware, such publicity to our 
beloved Faith which no campaign of teaching, however elaborately 
organised by the believers themselves, could ever hope to achieve at the 
present time.  Surely the invincible arm of &Baha'u'llah, working 
through strange and mysterious ways, will continue to guard and 
uphold, to steer the course, to consolidate, and eventually to achieve the 
world-wide recognition and triumph of His holy Faith.  
     And while the East, through suffering and turmoil, is moving on in 
its slow and toilsome march towards the acceptance of God's holy 
Faith, let us turn for a moment our gaze to the Western Hemisphere, 
and particularly to the American continent, and attempt to visualise 
the possibilities of the future spread of the Cause, and to estimate afresh 
those golden yet swiftly passing opportunities which &Baha'u'llah in 
those far-away lands has accorded to His chosen people.  I feel 
thoroughly convinced, and am moved to share this firm conviction 
within me with that great company of western believers, that in the 
speedy resumption of the sorely-neglected construction of the 
&Mashriqu'l-Adhkar at Wilmette lies our undoubted privilege, our 
primary obligation, our most vital opportunity to lend an unprecedented 
impetus to the advancement of the Cause, not only throughout the 
West but in every country of the world.  I would not stress at this 
moment the prestige and good name of the Cause, much as they are 
involved in this most pressing issue, I would not dwell upon the eager 
expectancy with which the unnumbered followers of the Faith as well 
as the vast number of the non-believers in almost every section of 
society throughout the East are awaiting to behold that noble structure 
rear its head in the heart of that far-western continent; nor would I 
expatiate on the ineffable beauty of this holy Edifice, its towering 
glory, its artistic design, its unique character, or its functions in the 
organic life of the &Baha'i community of the future.  But I would with 
all the strength of my conviction emphasise the immeasurable spiritual 
significance of an Edifice, so beauteous, so holy, erected solely by the 
concerted efforts, strained to the utmost degree of self-sacrifice, of the 
entire body of the believers who are fully conscious of the significance 
of the Revelation of &Baha'u'llah.  In this vast endeavour, unparalleled 
in modern times, its world-wide range, its spontaneity, its heroic and 
 
+P81 
holy character, the American believers, on the soil of whose country 
&Baha'u'llah's first universal House of Worship is to be built, must, if 
they be faithful to their trust, claim and fulfil a pre-eminent share in 
the collective contributions offered by the &Baha'is of the world.  
     For this reason do I feel impelled to direct my incessant plea in 
particular to the followers of the Faith in the United States and 
Canada to arise and play their part, while there is yet time, and not 
to allow their earnest strivings to be swamped and superseded by the 
self-sacrificing heroism of the multitude of their brethren in Persia.  
Again I feel the urge to remind you one and all of the necessity of 
keeping ever in mind this fundamental verity that the efficacy of the 
spiritual forces centering in, and radiating from, the first 
&Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in the West will in a great measure depend upon the 
extent to which we, the pioneer workers in that land will with clear vision, 
unquenchable faith, and inflexible determination, resolve to voluntarily 
abnegate temporal advantages in our support of so meritorious an 
endeavour.  The higher the degree of our renunciation and self-sacrifice, 
the wider the range of the contributing believers, the more apparent 
will become the vitalising forces that are to emanate from this unique 
and sacred Edifice; and the greater, in consequence, the stimulating 
effect it will exert upon the propagation of the Faith in the days to 
come.  Not by the abundance of our donations, not even by the 
spontaneity of our efforts, but rather by the degree of self-abnegation 
which our contributions will entail, can we effectively promote the 
speedy realisation of &Abdu'l-Baha's cherished desire.  How great our 
responsibility, how immense our task, how priceless the advantages 
that we can reap!  
     I cannot refrain, however, from giving expression to my gratification 
and appreciation of the substantial and continued support already 
accorded, and in particular during the past year by the believers in the 
United States and Canada, under the wise and judicious direction of 
their elected national representatives, to the Plan of Unified Action, 
whose declared purpose is to insure, ere the present &Baha'i year comes 
to a close, the raising of the funds required for the building of the first 
Unit of the &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  The vigilance and fidelity with which 
the National Assembly of the United States and Canada has observed 
its pledge in connection with the limitation of the current administrative 
expenses of the Cause, and the zeal and ready response manifested by 
local Assemblies and individual believers to curtail their local and 
personal expenditures in order to concentrate on the Temple Fund, are 
 
+P82 
worthy of the highest praise, and will deservedly attract the manifold 
blessings of a loving and bountiful Master.  Much indeed has been 
accomplished during this past year of concentrated and consecrated 
self-sacrifice for so glorious a purpose.  Much more still remains unachieved 
if we are to vindicate, in the eyes of an expectant world, the honourable 
name, the inexhaustible and miraculous vitality of the Revelation of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
     In the mid-watches of the night, commemorating the passing of 
Him Who with His own hands laid the head-cornerstone of His 
Father's House of Worship in that land, seated within the hallowed 
precincts of His shrine, and keeping vigil in the company of His closest 
companions, I have more than once in the midst of my devotions 
prayerfully remembered those chosen ones of God on whose shoulders 
has fallen so weighty a responsibility, whose destiny is to bring to full 
fruition so excellent a heritage.  I have recalled on that peaceful and 
moonlit night, with much emotion and gratitude, the inestimable 
bounties He lavished while on earth upon you.  I have revived in my 
memory the glowing promises that His unfailing guidance and 
gracious assistance would continue from His station on high to be 
showered upon you.  I have pictured in my mind that beauteous vision 
of a Cause unfolded in all its glory which in His immortal writings 
He has revealed unto you.  And with my head upon His threshold, I 
have prayed and prayed again that we may all prove ourselves worthy 
disciples of so gracious a Master, that we may, when called unto Him, 
transmit, undiminished and unimpaired, our share of the immeasurably 
precious heritage bequeathed by Him to us all.  
     And in closing, dearly-beloved friends, what more appropriate 
thought with which to conclude my fervent plea than these pregnant 
words fallen from the lips of &Baha'u'llah:  "O My friends!  I bear 
witness that the Divine Bounty has been vouchsafed unto you, His 
Argument has been made manifest, His Proof has been revealed and 
His Guidance has shone forth upon you.  Let it now be seen what your 
endeavours in the path of renunciation can reveal."  
                                    Your true brother,

+P83 
Dear fellow-workers, 
     I desire to convey to you in a few words my impressions of the 
recently published "&Baha'i World", copies of which I understand, 
have already, thanks to the assiduous care and indefatigable efforts 
displayed by the Publishing Committee of the American National 
Spiritual Assembly, been widely distributed among the &Baha'i 
countries of East and West.  
     This unique record of world-wide &Baha'i activity attempts to present 
to the general public, as well as to the student and scholar, those 
historical facts and fundamental principles that constitute the 
distinguishing features of the Message of &Baha'u'llah to this age.  I 
have ever since its inception taken a keen and sustained interest in its 
development, have personally participated in the collection of its 
material, the arrangement of its contents, and the close scrutiny of 
whatever data it contains.  
     I confidently and emphatically recommend it to every thoughtful 
and eager follower of the Faith, whether in the East or in the West, 
whose desire is to place in the hands of the critical and intelligent 
inquirer, of whatever class, creed or colour, a work that can truly 
witness to the high purpose, the moving history, the enduring 
achievements, the resistless march and infinite prospects of the 
Revelation of &Baha'u'llah.  Eminently readable and attractive in its 
features, reliable and authoritative in the material it contains, up-to-date, 
comprehensive and accurate in the mass of information it gives, 
concise and persuasive in its treatment of the fundamental aspects of 
the Cause, thoroughly representative in the illustrations and 
photographs it reveals--it stands unexcelled and unapproached by any 
publication of its kind in the varied literature of our beloved Cause.  It 
will, without the slightest doubt, if generously and vigorously 
supported, arouse unprecedented interest among all classes of civilised 
society.  
     I earnestly request you, dearly-beloved friends, to exert the utmost 
effort for the prompt and widespread circulation of a book that so 
faithfully and vividly portrays, in all its essential features, its 
far-reaching ramifications and most arresting aspects, the all-encompassing 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  Whatever assistance, financial or moral, extended 
by &Baha'i Spiritual Assemblies and individual believers, to those who 
have been responsible for such a highly valuable and representative 
production will, it should be remembered, be directly utilised to advance 
the interests and reinforce the funds that are being raised in behalf of 
 
+P84 
the &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar, and will indirectly serve to exert a most 
powerful stimulus in removing the malicious misrepresentations and 
unfortunate misunderstandings that have so long and so grievously 
clouded the luminous Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout the West.  
 
Dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     With feelings of profound sorrow I am moved to address you these 
few lines mourning the loss which the Cause has undoubtedly 
sustained by the passing of one who, for many years and in 
circumstances of exceptional significance, rendered the sacred Threshold 
distinctive and inestimable services.  The hand of Divine Decree has 
removed, by the death of our talented and dearly-beloved friend, Mr. 
Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney, yet another outstanding figure in the 
Cause of &Baha'u'llah, who, by his brilliant gifts of mind and heart as 
well as by the divers achievements of his life, has truly enriched the 
annals of God's immortal Faith.  
     A pioneer of the Cause of &Baha'u'llah ever since its celestial light 
first warmed and illuminated the West, he has, by his close association 
with the person of &Abdu'l-Baha, by his contact with all sections of 
society, by his scholarly presentation of the history and fundamentals 
of the Faith, and lastly by his unforgettable share in the settlement of 
the complex and pressing issues that called for expert assistance in the 
days following &Abdu'l-Baha's passing, achieved a standing which few 
have as yet attained.  
     The days of his spiritual communion with &Abdu'l-Baha and His 
household within the walls of the prison-city of &Akka, wherein he 
imbibed the principles which he later so ably expounded to the peoples 
of the West; his pre-eminent role on his return to Paris in kindling the 
torch which is destined to shed eternal illumination upon his native 
land and its people; the links of abiding fellowship which he forged 
with our Persian brethren in the course of the historic mission entrusted 
 
+F1 Printed also in "&Baha'i Administration".  
 
+P85 
to his charge by our Beloved; the seeds which he scattered far and wide 
during his subsequent travels to the heart of Asia, throughout India, 
beyond the remotest villages of Burma and as far as the eastern 
confines of Indo-China; the able support he lent in its initial and 
intermediary stages to the case of &Baha'u'llah's house in &Baghdad; his 
unhesitating intervention with State officials in paving the way for 
the ultimate emancipation of our Egyptian brethren from the yoke of 
orthodox &Islam; the stimulating encouragement his visit caused to the 
&Baha'i community of Tunis on the northern shores of Africa; and last 
but not least the ability and diligence with which he applied himself 
to the solution of the delicate and vexing problems of the Holy Land 
in the critical years following &Abdu'l-Baha's ascension--all stand out 
as memorable landmarks in a life that was as varied in its international 
aspects as it was rich in its spiritual experience.  
     His gifts of unfailing sympathy and penetrating insight, his wide 
knowledge and mature experience, all of which he utilised for the glory 
and propagation of the Message of &Baha'u'llah, will be gratefully 
remembered by future generations who, as the days go by, will better 
estimate the abiding value of the responsibilities he shouldered for the 
introduction and consolidation of the &Baha'i Faith in the Western 
world.  
     Suffering as he did in his last days from the effects of a slow and 
painful illness, he bore heroically his share of the afflictions of the 
world, and is now in the realms of blissful deliverance partaking his 
full share of the goodly reward which he certainly deserved.  To me, and 
particularly amid the storm and stress that have agitated my life after 
&Abdu'l-Baha's passing, he was a sustaining and comforting 
companion, a most valued counsellor, an intimate and trusted friend.  
     With much emotion and the deepest sense of gratitude I supplicate 
at the holy Threshold--and request you to join with me in my 
prayers--for the spiritual advancement in the realms above of a soul 
who by the sheer merit of the signal services he rendered already 
deserves to rank highly among the departed faithful.  
     May he forever rest in peace.

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     I write on behalf of the Guardian with reference to a subject 
that has lately been raised by the N.S.A. of America, and referred 
to him--the publication of a revised edition of the "Hidden 
Words" in England.  
     Shoghi Effendi has asked me to write to America that in view 
of the alterations that were lately introduced through the 
assistance of Miss Rosenberg and Canon Townshend, a new 
edition of the "Hidden Words" is fully justified and he approves 
of it.  However he does advise that such a publication should not 
be taken up privately but wholly undertaken by the English 
N.S.A. and in view of the large stock which the American 
N.S.A. now holds of the present edition, he would urge that the 
new edition should be deferred until the American N.S.A. has 
sold off the bulk of its present stock.  In general he would greatly 
desire and keenly advise better co-operation and co-ordination 
in the work of the American and English N.S.A. with regard to 
publication.  London, despite its small group has done great work 
in &Baha'i publications but they must never forget that their 
market lies unfortunately mainly across the Atlantic....  
     ...I hope you have been able to go to Geneva with Mr. Mills.  
Yours will be an Englishman's sober and matter of fact talk....

My dear Mr. Simpson, 
     Thank you so much for your letter of Sept. 19th and for the 
copy of the "Hidden Words" you sent me later.  
     Evidently enough I kept them until our Guardian's arrival 
and I now hasten to reply.  
     While he is well pleased with the booklet as it is now 
produced, Shoghi Effendi wishes me to express his regret that by 
appearing so soon, it has rendered the sale of a few thousand 
copies now in the hands of the American Publications Committee, 
extremely difficult, if not impossible.  
     Of course the Guardian appreciates your efforts and understands 
perfectly your desire to have a more correct and a better 
printed copy of the work on hand.  It is with that view that he is 
sending enclosed a cheque to the value of &19 for which kindly 
send him leather bound copies exactly like the specimen you 
sent.  
     Shoghi Effendi has returned much refreshed and has again 
taken up his work with renewed strength.  He is much hopeful 
of your new centre in Regent Street or thereabouts, and he trusts 
that it will mark a turning point in the history of the Cause in 
England--from happy tea-parties at individual homes, into a 
group of less personal but eager, active and thoughtful workers 
co-operating in a common service.  It is a basis upon which 
healthy progress is possible....

     "...I am delighted with your new centre, and will pray at the 
Holy Shrines from the depths of my heart for its progress.  Kindly 
assure my dear English friends of my heartfelt appreciation of their 
staunchness, their renewed activity, their self-sacrificing endeavours.  
I will continue to pray for their individual, as well as their collective 
efforts, from the bottom of my heart."

Through Miss Challis+:--  
     "I rejoice to hear of the new centre in London.  I will pray for its 
extension and growth and for the success of your manifold 
activities...."  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
Through his Secretary to Sister Challis:--  
     "Now that the London centre has been transferred to a better 
locality we hope it will attract more attention and add to the 
number of attendants at the meetings.  We should however, bear 
in mind that no matter how important the hall may be--the 
talks given and the unity manifested are of far greater 
significance."  
     "Shoghi Effendi has a special affection for the English friends, 
for he has been in their midst and knows most of them 
personally.  He therefore wishes and prays fervently that their 
number may increase, and that they may render distinguished 
services to the Cause.  Please assure them all of his prayers and 
extend to them his loving greetings."

     With regard to change in the official title of the N.S.A. he is 
pleased that the matter has been definitely decided.  
 
+P89 
(i.e.--"National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the British 
Isles.")  
     In connection with the important question of collating and 
editing the Master's Tablets to the friends in the British Isles ... 
Shoghi Effendi has already wired his reply.  
 
(i.e.--Cablegram Haifa February 3 1930--
     "WELCOME TOWNSHEND'S SPLENDID SUGGESTION REGARDING 
COLLECTION TABLETS, ADVISE SEND ORIGINALS TO HIM FOR 
PRESENT.")  
 
     Shoghi Effendi wants me to express his pleasure over such an 
undertaking, and he sincerely trusts that it will result into a 
splendid achievement for posterity--a mine of endless knowledge, 
illumination, and insight into &Baha'i teachings and 
outlook.  
     He wishes me to add that whereas he welcomes the work on 
the Tablets the friends have received from the Master he does 
not wish anything done on notes taken or personal accounts of 
visits.  
     The reason for this is the fear that a set of conflicting accounts 
of the same topic may crop up in various parts of the world from 
friends who have drawn largely from their memory, or have 
based their understanding of the Master's opinion or words, 
upon the imperfect, not to say faulty, renderings of the interpreters 
of those days.  
     Such accounts are not only impossible to verify but may lead 
to much perplexity and constitute a set of traditions that may not 
prove healthy....

     The work of collecting and publishing the Tablets is one of 
the most important tasks that this generation has undertaken, for 
upon it depends our true understanding of the Cause and its 
principles.  The more we put it off, the more we are apt to lose 
some of the original writings.  Yet important as this task may be, 
it is fraught with difficulties.  The early translations are far from 
being accurate, no matter who the translator may be.  Shoghi 
Effendi firmly believes that only Tablets with the Master's 
signature and in the original tongue should be recognised.  Any 
translations or copies of them fail from having real authority.  
This shows the importance of collecting the original Tablets that 
bear the Master's signature.

Editor's Note:  
     From the end of 1930 until early 1934 there are no records of cables or 
letters from the Guardian.  Indeed there are very few references to the 
Guardian in the scanty Minutes of the National Assembly of that period.  These 
brief Minutes indicate that only five or six short meetings were held each 
year.  
     At the meeting of the National Assembly on 12 June, 1932 it was reported 
that a reply had been received from Shoghi Effendi in answer to a request from 
a Mr Wren for some confirmation of the Lambeth Resolution on Peace.  
Another letter from the Guardian was read during the September 11 meeting 
and it was recorded that the Assembly endorsed Resolution 26 of the Lambeth 
Conference, 1930 "with the full sanction of Shoghi Effendi".  
 
+P91 
24 January 1934+F1  
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     At the request of the Guardian I am sending you enclosed the 
programme of "The New Commonwealth", a society for the 
promotion of international law and order, having its headquarters 
in London, and which seems to have a wide and well selected 
membership.  The Guardian wishes the British N.S.A. to consider 
the possibility of their joining this organisation, and to carefully 
investigate whether any affiliation with that body involves any 
political allegiance or may indirectly and eventually lead to 
participation in any form of political activity.  In the contrary 
case, he strongly advises the N.S.A. to join that organisation, as 
he feels that in this way the friends can give a wide and effective 
publicity to the teachings of the Cause.  Membership in non-political 
organisations of this type is, indeed, the best method of 
teaching indirectly the Message by making useful and frequent 
contacts with well-known and influential persons who, if not 
completely won to the Faith, can at least become of some 
effective use to it.  
     Trusting that you are in the best of health, and with the 
assurance of Shoghi Effendi's ardent prayers on your behalf and 
on behalf of all the friends in London.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 
 
11 February 1934 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge on his behalf the 
receipt of your letters dated Jan. 20th and Feb. 2nd, 1934, all of 
which he read with deep interest.  He has also received the text 
of the High Commissioner's reply to your petition.  
     With regard to the "New Commonwealth" society he would 
advise the N.S.A. to join it as soon as possible after having 
carefully ascertained that affiliation with such a body does not 
involve any political allegiance to any doctrine or group.  As you 
have already stated this organisation is run on non-party lines.  It 
would be, however, advisable that you should find out the real 
 
+F1 Addressed to Mrs. Slade.  
 
+P92 
aims and objectives of the society and specially the methods it 
advocates for the carrying out of its ideals before definitely 
joining it.  
     The Guardian hopes that this will give the friends a further 
opportunity to make new contacts, and to draw more competent 
and sincere people to the Cause.  He is fully alive to the difficulties 
facing the friends at the present time.  But he would urge each 
and all to work harder than ever, and to persevere in order that 
the Faith may be better appreciated and understood by the 
public.  
     He will continue to supplicate on behalf of you all at the Holy 
Shrines, so that &Baha'u'llah may sustain you in your efforts to 
spread His message.  
                                With best wishes for Mr. Slade and yourself, 
                                                       Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless richly your continued and self-sacrificing 
endeavours, restore your health, cheer your heart, and enable you to 
promote effectively the vital interests of our beloved Faith.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     I wish to thank you in the name of the Guardian for your 
deeply appreciated letter of April 24th, as well as for the article 
on Jerusalem which appeared in "Time and Tide", all of which 
he greatly enjoyed reading.  
     In regard to Mr. Townshend's book+F1 he wishes me to renew 
his request that your N.S.A. should seriously consider the ways 
and means for the speedy publication of this highly valuable 
work, the spread of which cannot but give an unprecedented 
publicity to the Faith.  He values the efforts that have thus far 
been exerted to this end and particularly appreciates the careful 
attention you have given the matter and hopes that as a result of 
these combined efforts something truly substantial will be 
achieved.  
 
+F1 "Promise of All Ages"  
 
+P93 
     Shoghi Effendi feels rather surprised that no acknowledgment 
has thus far been made of his last general letter, Feb. 8+F1, to the 
believers of the West, a copy of which was forwarded to you as 
secretary of the N.S.A.  Will you please be kind enough to inform 
him whether the said document has reached you safely.  
     With the renewed assurance of his best wishes and of his 
continued supplications for the speedy development of the Cause 
in your country.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the assurance of my continued prayers for the extension of 
the range of your splendid activities and for the success of your constant 
and high endeavours, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
15 May 1934 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     The Guardian has received and deeply appreciated your 
message dated May 7th, and was gratified to learn of the results 
of your national &Baha'i elections.  He wishes me to convey to 
you, and to the remaining officers of the N.S.A. his hearty 
greetings, and his best wishes for the success and continued 
expansion of your &Baha'i activities in this year.  He is fervently 
praying for your guidance and assistance in all the various and 
historic steps you are taking for the spread and the consolidation 
of the Movement throughout Great Britain.  
     What the Guardian would strongly urge your National 
Assembly to do in the next few months is a renewed and decisive 
effort for the speedy publication of Mr. Townshend's recent 
book on the Cause.  Through the reading of such a challenging 
and scholarly work many will, undoubtedly, be awakened and 
stimulated, while others will be infuriated to the extent of 
virulently attacking the Faith.  The unprecedented publicity 
which the Cause will be thus receiving will in itself constitute an 
important step towards a wider and fuller recognition of the 
Movement by distinguished personalities, in both intellectual 
and social circles.  Mr. Townshend's book is, indeed, very timely, 
 
+F1 Published under the title, "The Dispensation of &Baha'u'llah".  
 
+P94 
and through it the friends and the non-believers will be given a 
new vision of the Cause.  Shoghi Effendi is hoping that, as a result 
of his repeated requests, your N.S.A. will be stimulated to renew 
and persevere in their efforts in this vitally important matter.  
     With the renewed assurance of his prayers on your behalf and 
on behalf of the friends in London.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     I will fervently pray that the obstacles that stand in your way and 
which hinder the publication of Canon Townshend's splendid work 
will be completely and speedily surmounted.  I anticipate an outburst 
of interest and an unprecedented revival of activity as a direct result of 
the circulation of this notable work--a work which I trust will prove 
a landmark in the history of the Faith in your land.  
                                                           Shoghi 
 
2 July 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     Shoghi Effendi is pleased to learn, from your letters of June 
11th and 16th, of the new possibilities for the publication of 
Canon Townshend's book.  Realising the number and force of 
the difficulties which have thus far stood in your way, he cannot 
indeed but feel gratified that you have at last been able to 
overcome some of them.  He hopes that through your 
determination to have this valuable booklet published without 
any further delay some valuable and permanent result will be 
achieved, and that a few people of capacity and influence will be 
attracted to the Faith.  
     In case no publishing firm accepts your offer for the printing 
of the booklet, the Guardian approves that the N.S.A. should 
undertake the publication.  
     Hoping to hear very soon some more definite and encouraging 
news about this matter, and with the Guardian's best wishes for 
you and for your collaborators in the N.S.A.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 
 
+P95 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the renewed assurance of my loving and continued prayers 
for the success of your unsparing efforts for the spread of His Faith and 
the consolidation of its institutions, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
11 July 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter, and to assure you once more of his deepfelt 
appreciation of your highly-valued efforts for the publication of 
Canon Townshend's booklet on the Cause.  He hopes that the 
believers the world over will co-operate with your N.S.A. for 
giving the work the widest publicity possible, and by ordering 
as many copies as they can for distribution in their own 
communities.  They will surely appreciate, and draw great benefit 
from, this original and beautifully-written essay of Mr. 
Townshend, and they will certainly do their best to make it 
known by the outside world.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes you to send him, as soon as the book is 
published, 150 copies for his library.  He will also place some of 
them in &Baha'u'llah's Mansion at &Bahji for the benefit of the 
&Baha'i as well as &non-Baha'i visitors.  
     With the renewed assurance of his best wishes and of his 
continued prayers on your behalf.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your incessant and meritorious 
endeavours and crown them with unprecedented success, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

2 September 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has received and read with much interest your 
letter of August 9th.  It gives him pleasure to learn that the 
 
+P96 
agreement for the publication of Canon Townshend's book has 
already been signed, and he is looking forward to see the book 
out of the press within the next few weeks.  He hopes that your 
communications with the American N.S.A. for bringing out an 
American edition of this same book are proceeding satisfactorily, 
as he has every reason to believe that the friends in America will 
do their best to secure for that important publication the widest 
demand and publicity possible.  
     Shoghi Effendi would advise that you should also communicate 
with the N.S.A. of the &Baha'is of Australia and New Zealand, 
and with other English speaking Assemblies, groups and 
individuals, informing them of this new publication, and asking 
for their assistance in creating for it as wide a demand as possible.  
     With his renewed greetings and best wishes to you and to all 
the friends in London, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     I have read your letter of May 22 and Aug. 9 with joy and 
thankfulness as both eloquently testify to your inflexible resolve to 
promote by every means in your power the best interests of our beloved 
Cause.  I trust and pray that the effect of the publication of the 
"Promise" will be such as to gladden your heart and reinforce the 
constant efforts which you have so devotedly exerted in recent years for 
the propagation of the Faith.  I will soon send the cheque for the books 
I have asked you to send me and which I will distribute as widely as 
I possibly can.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
30 September 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has directed me to thank you for your welcome 
letter dated September fifth.  The news of the passing away of 
Mr. Simpson has deeply grieved his heart.  He hopes and fervently 
prays that the Beloved may fully reward him for all the services 
which he has rendered the Faith in Great Britain, and particularly 
for the active part which he took during the early days of his 
association with the Movement, in establishing the Cause of the 
Administration in that land.  May the Almighty enable his soul 
to progress spiritually in the other world, and may the memory 
 
+P97 
of his earlier services to the Faith sustain and encourage the 
friends in their labours for the propagation of the Cause in Great 
Britain.  
     The Guardian has already written Mr. ... concerning Mr. ... 
gift to the Cause and has expressed his profound appreciation of 
the suggestion made by him to have his property registered in 
the name of your National Assembly.  This step, he is convinced, 
would be of great help to your Assembly, in that it would assist 
in enabling it to obtain full legal recognition from the authorities 
and thus become an effective and powerful organ for the 
administration of &Baha'i affairs throughout the British Isles.  But, 
if your Assembly feels that such a step would be premature, he 
suggests that you should have the property registered in the 
name of the Palestine Branch of the American N.S.A., until such 
time as your own Assembly would be in a position to acquire 
full legal recognition from the British authorities, and will be 
entitled to hold property in Palestine.  In the meantime the 
American N.S.A. can issue a statement testifying that this 
property is registered only temporarily in their name, and that 
as soon as the incorporation is effected they will have it 
transferred to the name of the National Assembly of the British 
Isles.  
     Concerning the material which your Assembly has been 
requested to provide for the writing of a history of the Cause in 
England, the Guardian feels the advisability of making as few 
references to individuals as possible.  He further suggests that 
emphasis be placed on two major events, the Master's visit to 
England, and the publication of Dr. Esslemont's "New Era" 
which, indeed, constitutes a real landmark in the history of the 
Faith in that country.  
     There is another point to which the Guardian wishes to draw 
the attention of your N.S.A.  It is the importance which national 
&Baha'i summer schools are acquiring in the development and 
spread of the Cause.  Two of these, as you know, have already 
been established and are now regularly functioning, that of 
America with its three branches in Green Acre, Lou-Helen 
Ranch and Geyserville, and that of Esslingen in Germany which 
in the last two years has considerably developed, and has attracted 
the attention of non-German believers throughout the &Baha'i 
world.  The Guardian suggests that pending the establishment of 
 
+P98 
a similar &Baha'i Summer School in England, your Assembly 
should take into consideration the most effective way in which 
it can co-operate with the German friends in furthering the 
interests of their summer school at Esslingen.  Meanwhile an 
effort should be made by our English believers to take the 
necessary steps for the formation of a similar institution in Great 
Britain.  Many &Baha'i travellers in Europe, mostly American, 
have had this summer the opportunity of attending meetings 
and classes of the friends in Esslingen.  Mr. and Mrs. Greven, Mrs. 
Collins, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop representing the &Baha'i Bureau at 
Geneva.  &Baha'is from Austria and Persia attended.  Miss Jack and 
Mrs. Gregory came specially from the Balkans, and gave detailed 
reports on the conditions of the Cause in the Balkans.  In view of 
this international importance which the Esslingen summer 
school is thus acquiring, at least in Europe, the Guardian feels the 
advisability of your National Assembly being represented at 
these important gatherings.  
     In closing I wish to ask you to convey the Guardian's greetings 
and love to Mr. &Asgharzadeh who, as you write, seems to be 
suffering from ill-health.  Will you kindly assure him of Shoghi 
Effendi's prayers for his complete recovery, and express his 
appreciation of his continued labours for the Cause in London.  
     With warmest greetings to you and to all the friends, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     The utmost effort, I feel, should be exerted to ensure the 
incorporation of the British National Assembly.  Should the authorities 
require a document setting forth the laws and principles governing the 
activities of the community, the text of the Declaration of Trust and 
By-laws now operating in America and adopted by the National 
Assemblies of Egypt, India and &Iraq should be presented to them.  The 
text is published in Vol. IV of the "&Baha'i World" and constitutes a 
pattern for all national &Baha'i constitutions.  I would also greatly 
welcome close collaboration by the believers in England in the 
development of the very useful and promising summer school recently 
initiated in Esslingen and which has served this summer as a meeting 
place of teachers and representatives in Europe.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

22 November 1934 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated September 21st and November 16th have 
been received and their contents carefully noted by the Guardian.  
     He has also received the one hundred and fifty copies of "The 
Promise of All Ages" and wishes me to thank you for them, and 
to renew his appreciation of your painstaking efforts for the 
publication of this most timely and singularly penetrating book 
on the Cause.  He hopes and prays that your labours in this 
connexion may be abundantly rewarded.  He has already sent 
Mr. Townshend a cheque of thirty-five pounds on account of 
the 150 copies of his book.  He hopes the sum will reach him 
very soon.  He would deeply appreciate if you kindly send him 
copies of the letters of acknowledgment which you receive from 
those to whom the book has been offered, as in this way he can 
more or less know of the reaction which the book has produced 
on the mind of the intellectual public in London and elsewhere.  
     With regard to Mr. Townshend's suggestion to procure the 
copyright of the portraits of the Master taken in Paris, Shoghi 
Effendi fully approves the idea, and would advise you to write 
the Paris Assembly about it and to try to enlist their co-operation 
and help in this matter.  
     The Guardian also wishes to express his whole-hearted 
approval of the steps your National Assembly is taking for 
incorporating their Assembly as a duly recognised religious body 
in England and throughout the British Isles.  He would suggest 
that in case the authorities refuse to recognise the N.S.A. as a 
religious society you should insist on having it temporarily 
registered as a commercial body or under any other designation.  
He requests you to send him copies of the registration documents 
as soon as they are ready, as he intends to take the necessary steps 
for the establishment of a Palestine Branch of your National 
Assembly similar to that which the American N.S.A. now 
possesses in Palestine.  
     With his fervent prayers and loving greetings to you and to 
all the friends in London, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     The books you have sent me are being widely distributed and I am 
 
+P100 
sure they will serve to stimulate genuine interest in the fundamentals 
of the Faith.  A special and sustained effort, I feel, should be exerted by 
your National Assembly in order to ensure that copies of this brilliant 
production may reach most, if not all the &Baha'i centres throughout the 
East and West and may be made accessible to the most influential 
leaders and organisations in every continent of the Globe.  The success 
it can achieve largely depends upon the publicity which the continued 
and organised endeavours of your Assembly can now accord it.  
                                    Praying for your success and protection.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
17 December 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has directed me to thank you for your welcome 
letter dated December 8th, and also for the undated one just 
received.  
     In regard to his money order for the 150 copies of the 
"Promise of All Ages", he wishes you to offer the remaining sum 
to your National Assembly for the purposes of their national 
fund.  
     He is pleased to learn that the editor of "The Times' Literary 
Supplement" has accepted to have Canon Townshend's book 
reviewed in his paper.  He trusts that the result will be such as to 
stimulate many people to buy this volume, and to carefully and 
seriously study and meditate upon its contents.  
     With reference to Mr. ... property on Mt. Carmel, the 
Guardian specially requests you to proceed quickly in the matter 
of your National Assembly's incorporation so as to enable him 
to establish a branch of that Assembly in Palestine and thus make 
possible the registration of the land in question in the name of 
the British N.S.A.  The land is completely safe-guarded at present.  
     He would deeply appreciate if you send him photostatic copies 
of the registration documents as soon as they will be ready.  
     In this connection, the Guardian wishes me to draw once 
more your attention to the importance of following, in the 
adoption of your Assembly's constitution, complete and exact 
wording of the text of the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of 
 
+P101 
the American N.S.A., with due consideration however to all 
local conditions which may necessitate some minor departure 
from the original American copy.  
     It will interest you to know that the N.S.A. of the &Baha'is of 
India and Burma have carefully followed the constitutions 
adopted by the American believers, both in the local and the 
national sphere, and have succeeded in registering their National 
Assembly as a legal body empowered to administer the affairs of 
the Cause throughout India and Burma.  The Guardian is now 
engaged in establishing a branch of the Indian N.S.A. in Palestine.  
The National Assemblies of Egypt, &Iraq and Persia have likewise 
adopted without any alteration whatever the text of the 
American constitution as a pattern for their local as well as 
national regulations and by-laws.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty enable you to surmount all the obstacles that 
stand in your path and accomplish the great project which you are 
initiating, and establish your manifold administrative activities on a 
sound, permanent and unassailable basis.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
27 December 1934 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has directed me to send you enclosed a copy of 
the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the &Baha'is of India and Burma.  
     You will find, after going carefully over the text, that except 
for Article VIII which is being amended, it is fully identical with 
the constitution adopted by the American N.S.A., and as such is 
in close conformity with the principles laid down by the 
Guardian concerning national &Baha'i constitutions throughout 
the world.  
     He feels it his duty, now that your N.S.A. is taking steps for 
its formal registration in the Government, to earnestly request 
you to adopt, in its entirety and without any alteration, the full 
text of the constitution of the American N.S.A. so as to maintain 
 
+P102 
the necessary uniformity in the essential principles of the 
Administrative Order.  Whatever is not specified in the text of 
this national constitution, the Guardian has already explained to 
the National Assemblies of America, India, Egypt, &Iraq and 
Persia, is to be left to the discretion of these Assemblies.  He does 
not object if there be any differences in these secondary matters, 
but he feels that he should insist on uniformity in essentials.  
Diversity in unity--which is so vital and basic a principle of the 
Movement--would thereby be maintained.  
     With heartiest greetings to you and to all the friends, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 
 
15 February 1935 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letters of 
the fourth of January last and of the seventh of this month, all of 
which he has read with deepest interest.  
     He was, however, grieved to learn of the slight indisposition 
in your health, and particularly of the serious illness of Miss Elsie 
Lea.  He is praying for you both at the Holy Shrines that you may 
be given the necessary strength to resume your work for the 
Cause in London.  
     With regard to the situation in Persia, it is pretty bad indeed.  
Conditions have not improved in the slightest degree, and the 
friends are still suffering from the intolerable burden of 
restrictions imposed upon them by the Authorities.  The 
Guardian does not advise your Assembly to enter into detailed 
correspondence with any of the friends there, but sees no 
objection if you send them copies of your News Letters....  
     The friends will no doubt appreciate the possibilities which 
the admission of so distinguished a person as ... in their midst 
will have for the Cause.  This new development should, indeed, 
encourage and stimulate them to persevere, nay to redouble 
their efforts for the extension of their teaching activities 
throughout Great Britain.  The future of the Cause in that 
country is, indeed, bright.  But the friends should also exert their 
utmost, lest through neglect and apathy its progress be impeded.  
Now that such a wonderful opportunity has presented itself to 
 
+P103 
them, it is their responsibility to take their full chance and to 
make a renewed attempt to extend and further consolidate their 
teaching work in London and throughout the British Isles.  
     Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying that through the 
confirmations and blessings of &Baha'u'llah you may all be assisted 
in effectively attaining this objective.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am so pleased to learn of the splendid response of ... to the call of 
our Faith, and would urge you to make a special effort, in conjunction 
with the friends and Assemblies in England, to aid him to deepen his 
faith and extend the scope of his valued activities.  I will pray for the 
success of your efforts and the realisation of your highest hopes.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
7 April 1935 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     Shoghi Effendi has received your letters dated March 8th and 
April 1st, and wishes me to thank you for them.  
     With regard to the incorporation of the British N.S.A., he is 
sorry, indeed, that the authorities have definitely refused your 
application.  He is, nevertheless, confident that your Assembly's 
efforts in this connection will, in due time, bear fruit, and that 
the officials concerned will gradually come to alter their views 
regarding the nature and significance of the Movement.  
     In the meantime, the Guardian can have ... property on Mt. 
Carmel transferred to the name of the Palestine Branch of the 
American N.S.A.  
     With the renewed expression of Shoghi Effendi's deepfelt 
appreciation of your services, and with his loving greetings and 
best wishes to you and to the friends in London....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-worker, 
     I grieve to learn of the refusal of the Board of Trade to incorporate 
the National Assembly, but I feel certain that the friends will not 
allow this setback to damp their zeal or to weaken their determination 
 
+P104 
to prosecute the work they have so devotedly undertaken.  It may 
indeed prove a blessing in disguise, and I would urge the friends to 
persevere and not to lose heart and to rest assured that our beloved 
Faith will ultimately conquer.  
                                    With my best wishes for all of you, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
9 December 1935 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has just received letters from Sir Herbert 
Samuel and Sir Francis Younghusband inviting him to attend 
and present a paper on the subject:  How to promote the spirit of 
World Fellowship through religion at the projected conference 
of the "World Fellowship Through Religion" to be held in 
London this coming July.  
     As he is unable to be present at this meeting, he has thought 
best to ask the British N.S.A. to act as his representatives, and to 
appoint someone to read this paper which he is asking Mr. 
Townshend to prepare for that occasion.  He is specially writing 
Mr. Townshend about it, and urging him to have the statement 
ready by the end of January, when it has to be handed by your 
N.S.A. to Sir Francis Younghusband according to his request 
from the Guardian.  
     He also thinks it necessary for your Assembly to communicate 
as promptly as you can with Sir F. Younghusband, and to express 
your readiness and pleasure to participate in the activities and 
deliberations of the World Fellowship conference.  
     In view of the vital importance of this gathering, at which 
representatives of various religious organisations will be present, 
and specially as Sir Herbert Samuel has himself expressed the 
desire that the Cause should be authoritatively and adequately 
represented there, Shoghi Effendi would urge the British N.S.A. 
to make every effort to fully avail themselves of this splendid 
opportunity for giving the Faith in England a fresh and 
unprecedented impetus.  
     Wishing you complete success in your labours in this 
connection, and awaiting the news of the progress of the action 
that you will take in this matter, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 
 
+P105 
26 December 1935 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     This letter is to confirm the one I wrote you nearly two weeks 
ago at the direction of the Guardian regarding the projected 
World Congress of Faiths to be held in London next summer.  
     As stated in that letter, the Guardian has whole-heartedly 
accepted the Committee's invitation, as expressed through both 
Sir Herbert Samuel and Sir Francis Younghusband, to have the 
Cause authoritatively represented at the above-mentioned 
Congress.  
     He now wishes to urge again your N.S.A. to speed up the 
matter of preparing the address which he has requested Mr. 
Townshend to prepare for that occasion.  He is also urging 
Mr. Townshend to have the address ready for presentation to 
the Committee towards the end of next January.  
     The Guardian hopes that the N.S.A. will do its very best to 
speed up this matter.  
     With his renewed thanks to you and to the friends, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 
 
13 March 1936 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has just sent you a cable asking you to send him, 
as soon as you can, two copies of the photograph of the N.S.A. 
of the British Isles of the year 1935-36 for publication in Volume 
Six of the "&Baha'i World".  He hopes there will be no delay in 
forwarding to him these photographs.  
                                    Thanking you in anticipation, 
                                    Yours in His Service, 
16 March 1936 
 
Dear Mrs. Slade, 
     The Guardian has been very pleased to learn, from the report 
you have submitted for the next issue of the "&Baha'i World" 
regarding the activities of the Cause in England, that the centre 
 
+P106 
in London has been given by the authorities the status of a place 
of worship, and that the Movement has been registered as a 
definite religious community.  
     If there are any documents or any letters you have obtained 
from the Government in connection with such a registration 
will you kindly send him reproductions of them as promptly as 
you can for publication in the next issue of the "&Baha'i World" 
(Vol. VI).  
     With many thanks and warmest greetings, 
                                    Yours in His Service,

The National Teaching Committee of the N.S.A. of the British 
Isles.  
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     The Guardian has read with profoundest interest the second 
number of the "Teaching Bulletin" issued by the N.S.A. of the 
&Baha'is of the British Isles, and feels highly gratified at the steps 
your committee is taking for the inauguration of a new teaching 
campaign throughout England.  This is surely a clear evidence of 
the new spirit animating the friends in that country, and a 
further revelation of their intense desire to give the cause of 
teaching a fresh and unprecedented stimulus.  There is undoubtedly 
no higher call than that of bringing the Message to a world 
tormented and torn on every side by the forces of destructive 
materialism.  It is for us to realise the full measure of responsibility 
that has been laid upon our shoulders in this matter, and having 
attained full consciousness of our responsibility to unitedly arise 
to contribute all that we can towards its discharge.  
     It is Shoghi Effendi's hope that under the guidance and 
encouragement of the N.S.A. your committee's work will 
steadily progress, and that the results achieved will be such as to 
create further confidence and arouse fresh hopes in your activities 
among all the friends throughout the British Isles.  He is looking 
eagerly forward to learn more of your activities, and to witness 
further signs of the effectiveness, unity and power with which 
 
+P107 
you are striving to diffuse the Teachings and principles of the 
Cause.  
     May the Almighty ever bless and sustain you in your 
labours....

The National Teaching Committee of the N.S.A. of the British 
Isles.  
 
Dear friends and co-workers, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to convey to you his deep 
gratitude for your welcome message of April 21st.  He has been 
made truly happy by its perusal and wishes me to express once 
more his genuine appreciation of the remarkable work which 
your committee is accomplishing for the spread of the Message 
throughout England.  He wishes you full success in your labours, 
and is praying to &Baha'u'llah to guide and assist you in every step 
you are taking for the dissemination of His Teachings and the 
establishment of His Faith in your country.  
     His chief advice to you is perseverance without which, he 
strongly feels, no success is attainable.  The difficulties in your 
way are undoubtedly manifold and not always easy to overcome.  
But provided you persevere, and face with courage, full faith and 
confidence such obstacles you can be sure of attaining the goal 
you have set yourselves to achieve.  
     Now is the beginning of your work.  And as in the beginning 
of every task you are bound to meet all sorts of difficulties.  The 
more you strive to overcome these, the greater will be your 
reward, and the nearer you will get to that glorious success 
 
+P108 
which, as repeatedly promised by &Baha'u'llah, must needs crown 
the efforts of all those who, whole-heartedly and with pure 
detachment, strive to work for the spread and establishment of 
His Cause.  
     With cordial greetings and every good wish....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the renewed assurance of my loving and constant prayers for 
the extension of your meritorious activities and services, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear Mr. Hofman+, 
     The Guardian has duly received your letter of April 29th 
written at the direction of the N.S.A. of the British Isles, and he 
wishes me to thank you for it.  
     He has learned with deep satisfaction of the result of your 
national elections, and has instructed me to convey to each and 
every member of your newly elected assembly his hearty 
congratulations and sincere good wishes.  He hopes that the 
officers of the N.S.A. will be fully guided in the discharge of 
their manifold and heavy responsibilities, and that through their 
collective and sustained efforts the Cause will receive a fresh and 
unprecedented impetus throughout England.  He is praying from 
the very depth of his heart on behalf of you all, entreating 
&Baha'u'llah to ever bless, sustain and guide you in your labours.  
     The Guardian would deeply appreciate receiving the minutes 
of the N.S.A. meetings, and hopes that you will send these to him 
as regularly as you can.  
     With his renewed and most loving greetings, also to the 
members of the N.S.A....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Wishing you the fullest success in your high and deeply appreciated 
endeavours, 
                                    Your true brother,

3 September 1936 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your welcome letter of August 7th together with the enclosed 
programme of the English &Baha'i Summer School and Mrs. 
Bishop's notes on the &Baha'i session of the World Fellowship of 
Faiths Congress have all duly arrived and been read with 
sustained interest and deepest appreciation by our beloved 
Guardian.  
     He has been particularly pleased to read Mrs. Bishop's report 
which is truly illuminating and highly encouraging.  The Cause 
has no doubt been well represented at the Congress, and the 
attendants must have surely been deeply impressed by the 
manner in which the Message was introduced and presented by 
both the &Baha'i and &non-Baha'i speakers.  
     The Guardian feels particularly grateful for the share which 
your N.S.A., as well as your distinguished and able co-workers 
Mrs. Bishop and Madame Orlova have contributed towards the 
success of the &Baha'i meeting.  May the noble efforts which you 
all have so unitedly and so successfully exerted in this connection 
serve to attract, even as a magnet, the blessings of God and His 
favours upon the entire community of the believers throughout 
the British Isles.  
     With every good wish and hearty greetings to you, and to 
your fellow-members in the N.S.A....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearest co-workers, 
     I rejoice to learn of the splendid work that has recently been 
achieved.  Your accomplishments should spur you on to achieve still 
greater results in both the teaching and administrative spheres of 
&Baha'i service.  My prayers will be offered on your behalf.  The work 
in which you are so devotedly engaged is near and dear to my heart.  
Persevere and never feel disheartened.  
                                    Affectionately, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
17 October 1936 
 
Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge with 
thanks the receipt of your letter dated August 25th with the 
 
+P110 
enclosed minutes of the British N.S.A.'s last meeting.  He has read 
them all with utmost care and profoundest appreciation.  
     Regarding your Summer School; he is indeed grateful to your 
Assembly for the great success that has attended your efforts for 
the formation of this institution, the teaching value of which for 
England cannot be overestimated.  He wishes, in particular, to 
offer his most sincere thanks to the &Baha'i youth group in London 
for their remarkable share in making the school such an 
outstanding success this year.  This has been certainly a bold 
undertaking, considering the limited number and resources of 
the believers in England.  But the results obtained are highly 
encouraging and augur well for the future of this first English 
&Baha'i Summer School.  The unity, courage and whole-hearted 
loyalty of the friends have enabled them to boldly face and 
successfully overcome the difficulties and obstacles which may 
have first appeared, to many at least, to be quite unsurmountable.  
The Guardian would, therefore, urge all the believers to 
persevere in their efforts for raising the standard, both intellectual 
and spiritual, of their Summer School and to heighten its prestige 
in the eyes of the friends, and of the general &non-Baha'i public 
outside.  The institution of the Summer School constitutes a vital 
and inseparable part of any teaching campaign, and as such ought 
to be given the full importance it deserves in the teaching plans 
and activities of the believers.  It should be organised in such a 
way as to attract the attention of the non-believers to the Cause 
and thus become an effective medium for teaching.  Also it should 
afford the believers themselves an opportunity to deepen their 
knowledge of the Teachings, through lectures and discussions 
and by means of close and intense community life.  
     As regards the N.S.A.'s request concerning Mrs. Bishop's 
teaching services in England, the Guardian wishes you to assure 
your fellow-members of his hearty approval of their suggestion 
that she should extend her stay in your country for another year.  
He is advising her to visit Geneva for a brief period and then 
return immediately back to England....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearest co-worker, 
     I wish to congratulate in person the English believers, and 
particularly the members of the youth group, on their splendid 
achievements.  The activities they have initiated, the perseverance, zeal 
 
+P111 
and fidelity they have increasingly manifested, the plans they have 
conceived and the obstacles they have already overcome, rejoice my 
heart and arouse fresh hopes and expectations within me.  I will 
continue to pray for their success.  Rest assured and persevere.  
                                    Affectionately, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
2 December 1936
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     Your kind letter of November 22nd with enclosures have 
been read with deep interest and profound gratitude by our 
beloved Guardian, and their contents have imparted fresh 
encouragement to his heart.  He has also received your 
communication of the 28th September with the accompanying 
minutes of the British N.S.A. and the report of your Summer 
School, and is indeed sorry for the long delay in thanking you 
for them.  
     Regarding Mr. Townshend, the Guardian is pleased to hear 
that he has written you, and offered a method whereby he could 
be freed to serve the Faith.  He is confident that your N.S.A. will 
give this matter their most careful and sympathetic consideration, 
and fervently hopes that they will, as a result, be able to find 
some way that would relieve Mr. Townshend of his many 
domestic cares and troubles which, as you know only too well, 
seriously impede the progress and expansion of his activities for 
the Faith.  
     It is a matter of deep regret, indeed, that our dear friend's 
material position is such as to make it quite impossible for him 
to devote his full time and energies to the Cause.  The friends in 
Great Britain, who are in special need of his able assistance in 
their teaching work, should, therefore, consider it their 
responsibility to find some solution to this urgent problem facing 
one of their most distinguished and competent fellow-workers.  
     Any suggestion which your N.S.A. could offer would 
certainly be deeply appreciated by Mr. Townshend, and the 
Guardian would be only too pleased to assist your Assembly in 
insuring the success of any plan you may propose and decide 
upon in this matter.  
 
+P112 
     Wishing you full and continued success in your work, and 
assuring you again of Shoghi Effendi's fervent prayers on your 
behalf and on behalf of your fellow-members in the N.S.A....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-worker, 
     Your splendid collaboration with the English believers is, as I am 
gradually and increasingly realising it, infusing a new life and a fresh 
determination into individuals and assemblies which will prove of the 
utmost benefit to our beloved Cause.  Persevere in your remarkable 
efforts and historic achievements.  With the aid of Mrs. Bishop an 
unprecedented and most powerful impetus will I am sure be given to 
the onward march of the Cause of God.  I am deeply grateful to you.  
                                    Your true brother,

10 January 1937 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brother, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to inform you of the receipt 
of your communications of the 6th and 24th December and of 
the 1st January, all of which he has read, together with their 
enclosures, with sustained interest.  Kindly convey to your 
fellow-members in the N.S.A. his appreciation and gratitude for 
the truly valuable work they are accomplishing for the 
promotion of the Faith in Great Britain.  He is continually and 
fervently praying for the guidance and success of the plans they 
have recently initiated for the extension of the teaching work 
and for the consolidation of the administrative institutions of the 
Cause in their land.  
     The Guardian is specially praying for the success of your 
N.S.A.'s project in connection with Mr. Townshend's problem.  
Much as he realises the financial difficulties involved in such a 
plan, he is nevertheless convinced that if every individual 
believer, no matter how limited his resources, pledges himself to 
give it his whole-hearted and continued support it will 
eventually, though after considerable effort and self-sacrifice, 
become effective and successful.  The opportunity has now come 
for the friends in Great Britain to demonstrate the measure of 
their devotion to the Cause, as well as their capacity to maintain, 
consolidate and extend its nascent administrative institutions in 
 
+P113 
that land.  The occasion calls for a tremendous amount of 
sacrifice, of perseverance and united labour on the part of the 
friends, and for the self-same devotion that characterised the 
nation-wide efforts of the American believers for the building 
up of their beloved Temple at Wilmette.  May the friends in 
Great Britain, despite their limited numbers and resources, be 
guided and assisted to successfully meet this challenge.  Their 
triumph will assuredly draw upon them the blessings and 
confirmations of &Baha'u'llah, and may prove to be the signal for 
fresh conquests and unprecedented developments in the Cause 
throughout the British Isles.  
     Regarding the New Commonwealth Society, the Guardian 
does not wish the friends, whether individually or collectively, 
to affiliate themselves with this and other kindred organisations, 
in view of the fact that the aims and ideals upheld by such bodies 
do not entirely conform to the Teachings, and hence there is 
always the possibility of creating complications for the Cause by 
accepting membership in them.  
     However, as the New Commonwealth Society is nearer to 
the Cause than perhaps any other organisation of its kind, the 
Guardian would advise the friends to participate, occasionally 
and in an informal manner, in its activities, to attend some of its 
meetings, and to contribute articles to its publications.  Association, 
as you certainly realise, is quite different from affiliation, 
and it is the latter which the Guardian wishes the friends to 
strictly avoid.  
     With his warmest greetings and sincere good wishes to you 
and your fellow-members in the N.S.A....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the renewed assurance of my continued, my loving and ardent 
prayers for the expansion and the consolidation of the splendid work 
which the English believers are unitedly accomplishing for the 
furtherance of the Cause of &Baha'u'llah, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
24 February 1937 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of 
 
+P114 
your welcome communications of the 19th January and the 
enclosed latest number of the "&Baha'i Journal" issued by the 
British N.S.A., and to transmit to you, and through you to your 
distinguished collaborators in that body, his admiration and 
gratitude for the quick action you have been prompted to take 
in connection with the formation of a Publishing Company 
under the direction of your National Assembly.  
     The plan you have conceived is certainly bold, knowing how 
limited are the number and resources of the believers in England.  
But it nevertheless offers great possibilities of development and 
success, provided your Assembly gives it full moral and financial 
support, and succeeds in stimulating the interest and obtaining 
the assistance of the believers outside Great Britain for its 
immediate and effective prosecution.  
     In this connection, he wishes you to assure the N.S.A. of his 
whole-hearted and full approval of their suggestion to solicit 
subscriptions from the &Baha'is of those countries who normally 
order literature from them.  He feels it, indeed, to be the duty of 
every believer who has the means, and has also the interest of the 
Cause at heart, to assist in any capacity, and to any extent he can, 
in carrying out the British N.S.A.'s project.  Nothing can 
demonstrate more effectively the spirit of solidarity and self-sacrifice 
which should animate the friends than their response to 
this call.  Aside from the fact that London is the heart of the 
British Empire, and as such commands an importance which 
few other centres in the world can equal and should consequently 
be raised to the status of one of the leading outposts of the Faith, 
it should be stated that now that the Administrative Order has 
at last been firmly established and is being increasingly 
consolidated in that centre, it is the supreme obligation of all the 
believers, both in Great Britain and other European countries, to 
assist by every means in hastening this internal development and 
growth.  And it is quite evident that the formation of a Publishing 
Company along the lines suggested by the British N.S.A. is the 
greatest asset to such a development and expansion of the Cause 
in London and throughout England as a whole.  
     It is the Guardian's hope that the response which the friends 
will make to this project will be such as to mark the inauguration 
of a new era of expansion of the Cause throughout the British 
Isles, and the rest of the far-flung British Empire.  He would 
 
+P115 
appeal to every believer to carefully ponder upon the responsibilities 
which he is called upon to shoulder in order to meet this 
supreme and vital obligation.

Dear and prized co-worker, 
     Your subsequent letters dated Jan. 29th enclosing the minutes of the 
National Assembly meeting, and February 26th enclosing copy of the 
&Baha'i Journal No. 5 have also reached me and have filled my heart 
with joy and gratitude for the splendid services of your Assembly and 
the efforts they are systematically and vigorously exerting for the 
initiation, the expansion and consolidation of &Baha'i administrative 
activities and enterprises at this auspicious stage in the evolution of the 
Faith in your country.  I fully approve the publication in your Journal 
of the passages quoted in your letter of February 26th.  I am enclosing 
the sum of &50 as my contribution towards the Fund which is being 
raised for the establishment of the Publishing Company for the success 
of which I cherish the brightest hopes.  I will especially pray for the 
removal of every obstacle that may impede its formation and 
development, and for the realisation of your highest hopes in this 
connection.  Persevere in your great enterprise, and rest assured that the 
almighty power of &Baha'u'llah will, if you remain steadfast in your 
purpose, enable you to attain your goal.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     I am charged by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the 
receipt of your communications of March 21st, 31st and of 
April 22nd with enclosures.  
     He has received and read with particular interest the latest 
issue of the Journal issued by the British N.S.A. and is indeed 
happy to realise that the teaching work, now so ably reinforced 
by the valuable support extended to it by dear Mrs. Bishop, is 
steadily progressing in England.  He is most pleased over the 
progress of the Devonshire Group, and wishes you to assure its 
members, and particularly Mrs. Stevens+, of his deep appreciation 
of their efforts for the propagation of the Message in that highly 
promising centre from which, he hopes, the light of the Cause 
will radiate throughout South Western England which has 
heretofore remained closed to the Faith.  He would urge your 
N.S.A. to continue giving your attention to the problem of 
finding ways and means to further widen the interest that has 
been aroused, and is fervently praying that your efforts in this 
connection may bear the richest and most satisfactory results.  
     Concerning the N.S.A.'s Publishing Fund; the Guardian has 
learned with satisfaction that the friends are gradually awakening 
to the realisation that it constitutes an invaluable support to the 
extension of the teaching work throughout the British Isles.  He 
hopes that the flow of contributions will steadily increase, so as 
to enable your Assembly to carry out its important project.  He 
is rejoiced to hear that you have taken the necessary steps to have 
the Company legally established--which step, he hopes, will 
pave the way for the registration of the N.S.A. as an independent 
religious organisation....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the assurance of my continued prayers for the realisation of 
your highest hopes, and for the uninterrupted progress and consolidation 
of your teaching and administrative activities, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     I am charged by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the

on behalf of the British N.S.A.  
     The enclosed copy of the Annual Report, as well as the minutes 
of the N.S.A. meeting of the 13th May have also reached him 
and he has read their contents with deepest satisfaction.  
     With regard to your Assembly's request for permission to 
publish in the "&Baha'i Journal" an extract from his letter of April 
24th addressed to Miss Baxter+, he wishes you to assure your 
fellow members of his approval of their request.  
     With his loving &Baha'i greetings and with his renewed and 
abiding appreciation of your labours for the Cause....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     Your letter of June 24th has also been received.  I feel the urge to add 
these few words in person in order to assure you afresh of my deep 
appreciation of the remarkable spirit of constancy, devotion and loyalty 
which you and your fellow workers, in both the teaching and 
administrative spheres of &Baha'i service are ably and continually 
manifesting.  My heart overflows with unspeakable gratitude.  I will 
continue to pray for all of you from the depths of my heart.

thanks the receipt of your letter of the 17th August enclosing the 
 
+P118 
minutes of the meeting of the British N.S.A. held at the Summer 
School on August 8th....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your persistent efforts and enable you to 
consolidate still further the manifold interests of the Faith of God.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
16 November 1937 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am charged by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of 
your communications of September 26th and November 6th 
with enclosures, all of which he has read with deepest interest 
and appreciation.  
     He very much regrets indeed the departure of Mrs. Bishop 
and Madame Orlova from England, as the services they rendered 
all through their stay in that country have been truly outstanding.  
The teaching force, in particular, will feel the loss of these two 
of its most capable and promising supporters.  Every effort should 
now be exerted by the N.S.A. however, to carry on the teaching 
work through every means possible, and every believer should 
be made to realise that he has an added and most grave 
responsibility to shoulder in this matter.  
     The Guardian has also learned with deep regret of ... 
resignation from the membership of the N.S.A. and trusts that 
the new member who will be elected to replace her will be able 
to contribute as much as she did to the growth and further 
consolidations of the National Assembly.  
     He will continue to pray for the confirmation and guidance 
of all the members, that they may befittingly discharge their 
manifold and weighty obligations toward the Faith throughout 
the British Isles.  
     With his loving greetings and deepest appreciation of your 
efforts....  
 
          [From the Guardian:]
     Wishing you the fullest success in the efforts which you are exerting 
in conjunction with the believers for the protection, the promotion, and 
the consolidation of the Cause of God.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

24th, January 10th, February 13th and March 22nd together 
with the enclosed minutes of the meetings of the British N.S.A., 
as well as the copies of the "&Baha'i Journal", all of which he has 
read with closest attention and keenest interest.  
     He has noted with gratification that the Teaching Conference 
held in Manchester during last December was successful, and 
that the meetings were all pervaded with a spirit of unity and of 
fellowship.  He has read with deep satisfaction the report of the 
above Conference which you had sent, and indeed trusts that the 
decision and plans that have been adopted will, through their 
faithful application in the course of this year, serve to greatly 
accelerate the expansion of the teaching work throughout the 
British Isles....  
 
+P120 
     P.S.  Shoghi Effendi has just received your letter of May 16th 
and wishes your Assembly to make strenuous efforts in 
connection with the incorporation of the N.S.A.  He would 
advise you to approach Lady Blomfield, Major Tudor-Pole and 
Lord Lamington.  
     The Guardian wishes me to inform you that you have been 
appointed by him a member of the International staff of editors 
of the "&Baha'i World".  He wishes you to start from now 
collecting the necessary material for the next edition and to send 
them gradually and directly to Mrs. French.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     I greatly welcome the determination of the English believers to 
concentrate their energies on the teaching work, and I pray from all 
my heart for the success of their high endeavours in this all-important 
field of &Baha'i service.  Individuals as well as local Assemblies must 
arise and co-operate and persevere and refuse to allow any obstacle, 
however formidable, to dim their hopes or to deflect them from the 
course they have so spontaneously chosen to pursue.  Kindly assure 
them of my constant prayers for their success.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
30 June 1938 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am instructed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt 
of your communication dated May 31st, enclosing two copies of 
the newly published booklet prepared by the British N.S.A. for 
teaching purposes, and also the latest issue of the "&Baha'i Journal", 
and the report of the Convention proceedings for this year.  
     He has read with keenest interest and with deep gratification 
the Annual Report of your Assembly and has been very much 
impressed indeed by its comprehensiveness, and by your ability 
in presenting the facts in such a lucid and effective language.  He 
has sent the text to Mr. Holley for reproduction in the next 
"&Baha'i World", as an appendix to the International Survey of 
activities.  
     Although the range of &Baha'i activities throughout Great 
Britain during this past year has been considerably restricted as 
 
+P121 
a result of the departure of many travelling and visiting &Baha'i 
teachers, yet the fact that the friends were, in spite of that and 
other handicaps, able to maintain the course of their activities 
constitutes a clear evidence that the English &Baha'i Community 
is at last able to stand on its own feet, and has sufficient resources, 
both moral and material, to enable it to carry on, without any 
external help, the heavy task that has been committed to its 
charge.  
     The Guardian wishes you to assure your fellow members on 
the N.S.A. and through them the friends throughout Great 
Britain, of his fervent prayers that throughout the course of this 
new year they may evince such a unity, zeal and renewed 
consecration to their task as to further demonstrate the strength 
of their position as a self-supporting and ever-growing national 
&Baha'i community....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Wishing you and your dear co-workers the utmost success in your 
high and meritorious endeavours, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your communications written on behalf of the British N.S.A. 
and dated June 23rd, July 8th and September 15th with their 
enclosures have all been duly received and their contents noted 
with interest and satisfaction by our beloved Guardian.  
     Regarding the papers you had enclosed in your last letter 
relating to the N.S.A.'s application for incorporation, he has read 
these with the closest attention, and has already communicated 
to you his approval by cable, and wishes me now to urge your 
Assembly to proceed with this matter without delay and to 
 
+P122 
make every effort to have the whole thing completed in the 
course of the next few months, preferably before the termination 
of your Assembly's term of office next April....  
     The Guardian has read with considerable interest Mr. 
Balyuzi's+ booklet on "&Baha'u'llah", and hopes that the two 
companion essays on the &Bab and the Master on which he is 
working will be soon completed and ready for distribution, as 
he feels they can be of a valuable help to the friends in their 
teaching work.  
     With the renewed assurances of his prayers for the confirmation 
of your services, and reciprocating your greetings....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-worker, 
     The energy, loyalty and resourcefulness with which your Assembly 
is conducting and extending the manifold activities of the Faith in 
these days of stress and trial deserve the highest praise.  Your 
achievements constitute indeed a landmark in the history of the Faith 
in that land.  I urge you, with all earnestness and with feelings of 
abounding gratitude, to redouble your efforts and to persevere until 
your highest hopes and plans in both the spiritual and administrative 
spheres are realised and fulfilled.  My prayers are always with you.

27 November 1938 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am directed by our beloved Guardian to express his thanks 
for your letter of the 2nd inst. written on behalf of the N.S.A.  
     He has noted your Assembly's request for his advice as to what 
forms of national service friends may volunteer for in times of 
emergency.  While the believers, he feels, should exert every 
effort to obtain from the authorities a permit exempting them 
from active military service in a combatant capacity, it is their 
duty at the same time, as loyal and devoted citizens, to offer their 
services to their country in any field of national service which is 
not specifically aggressive or directly military.  Such forms of 
national work as air raid precaution service, ambulance corps, 
and other humanitarian work or activity of a non-combatant 
nature, are the most suitable types of service the friends can 
 
+P123 
render, and which they should gladly volunteer for, since in 
addition to the fact that they do not involve any violation of the 
spirit or principle of the Teachings, they constitute a form of 
social and humanitarian service which the Cause holds sacred 
and emphatically enjoins.  
     The Guardian has noted with genuine satisfaction what you 
had written about your recent visit to ... and his earnest desire 
to become of increasing service to the Faith.  We will certainly 
pray that he may fully avail himself of the manifold opportunities 
that now lie before him of spreading the knowledge of the Cause 
in hitherto closed and conservative circles, and of thus drawing 
to it the attention of thoughtful and responsible people 
throughout Britain.  
     With the renewed assurances of his prayers for you and for 
your dear fellow members of the N.S.A....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and trusted co-worker, 
     The marvellous zeal, unity, understanding and devotion exemplified 
by the English believers in recent months, individually as well as 
through their concentrated efforts, constitute a landmark in the 
progressive development of the Faith in that land.  They who have 
risen to the height of their present opportunities stand at the threshold 
of unprecedented achievements.  They must labour continually, exercise 
the utmost vigilance, proclaim courageously, and cling tenaciously to 
the principles of their Faith, spiritual as well as administrative, and 
resolve to endure every sacrifice and hardship, however severe, for the 
vindication, the consolidation and recognition of the Faith they profess 
and are now so admirably serving.  
     With a heart filled with pride and gratitude I pray continually for 
their triumph.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     At the direction of our beloved Guardian I acknowledge with 
thanks the receipt of your communications dated November 
28th, December 5th, January 5th and 14th written on behalf of 
the British N.S.A., all of which he has read, together with their 
enclosures, with earnest and fullest attention.  
     Regarding the matter of the N.S.A.'s incorporation, he has 
noted with real satisfaction that in spite of the difficulties raised 
by the officials in the Board of Trade in connection with your 
application, the contacts you have formed with these officials 
have been of such a friendly nature as to give your Assembly an 
opportunity to further press your case, and also to impress the 
authorities concerned with the true nature and significance of 
the Faith.  
     The Guardian would urge your Assembly to strain every 
nerve to bring this task to speedy completion, and wishes me to 
reassure you and your fellow-members that he will continually 
and most fervently pray that your renewed efforts in this 
connection may be crowned with full success.  
     He also wishes me to express his feelings of deep satisfaction 
at the efforts of your Assembly in connection with the 
publication of "New World Order", which paper, he hopes, will 
prove of increasing value as a medium for the spread of the 
Cause throughout England.  
     In closing I feel I must also convey his loving thanks to your 
Assembly for the very cordial welcome and warm hospitality 
which you have, in response to his telegram, kindly extended to 
our well beloved and highly esteemed brother Mr. &Ala'i.  The 
love and consideration he has been shown by the friends, and by 
the members of your Assembly in particular, will, he feels 
certain, help to a marked degree in counter-acting the painful 
 
+P125 
effects of the insidious disease from which he is so severely, yet 
so uncomplainingly suffering.  The spirit of courage and fortitude 
which he is displaying surely cannot but create a profound 
impression upon all those friends, doctors and patients who come 
in contact with him.  May his presence in your midst, however 
temporary, serve as an opportunity of further spreading the 
knowledge of the Faith, and also be the means of encouragement 
and inspiration to the believers....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     I am delighted with the work which is being so energetically 
conducted, and so faithfully extended and consolidated by the English 
believers, and particularly by their national elected representatives 
whose magnificent efforts, courage and perseverance deserve the highest 
praise.  A splendid beginning has been made.  A firm foundation has 
been established.  Perseverance is now required to bring these devoted, 
painstaking and concerted efforts to full and speedy fruition.  The path 
you are treading is beset with formidable obstacles, but the invincible 
power of the Faith will, if you remain faithful and steadfast, enable 
you to surmount them.  My prayers will continue to be offered on your 
behalf.  May &Baha'u'llah fulfil every hope you cherish in the service of 
His Faith.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     At our beloved Guardian's direction I gratefully acknowledge 
the receipt of your communications dated February 19th, March 
7th and 27th, May 3rd with enclosures, written on behalf of the 
British N.S.A.  
     He has noted with considerable satisfaction the report of the 
progress recently achieved in Bradford and Torquay where, 
he is most delighted to know, the friends, and particularly the 
newly enrolled young believers, are displaying great enthusiasm 
in their activities and have obtained many openings of presenting 
the Cause.  
     The news of the confirmation of Mr. Frank Hurst+ is specially 
gratifying and should prove of deep encouragement to all the 
friends who should indeed avail themselves of the opportunity 
of his presence in the community to give intensive publicity to 
the Faith.  
     Regarding the new prayer book which the N.S.A. is proposing 
to publish; the manuscript has already been returned to your 
address and the suggestions and recommendations of the 
Guardian on the matter duly conveyed to your Assembly in a 
recent letter.  He would advise that on the inside cover mention 
should be made only of the British Reviewing Committee's 
approval, as it is invariably done in the case of all official &Baha'i 
publications.  
     In connection with the problem of &Baha'i refugees, the 
Guardian feels this is a matter which concerns the N.S.A., who 
would be justified in taking any action they deem appropriate, 
 
+F1 In reply to the Convention's cable stating that two new Assemblies--
+F1 Bradford and Torquay--were represented, and the incorporation documents 
+F1 were completed.  
 
+P127 
provided the state of the National Fund permits it, and only after 
the particular case of each individual applicant has been 
thoroughly investigated, and his status as a believer duly 
ascertained.  
     With reference to your suggestion as to the advisability of 
your approaching Mr. Eden, and through him possibly Lord 
Halifax, with the view to obtaining from them statements for 
the "&Baha'i World", Shoghi Effendi would approve of your 
seeing Mr. Eden only, and would leave it to the N.S.A.'s 
discretion whether you should approach him as his representative 
or as the representative of the British National Assembly.  
     Concerning Mrs. Basil Hall's+ paper which she had prepared 
for last year's Summer School; the N.S.A.'s approval sanctioning 
its publication would be sufficient.  You need not, therefore, send 
the manuscript to Haifa.  But as to the passages she had quoted 
from Myron Phelps' book, the Guardian does not advise that 
these quotations be included in the pamphlet, as Phelps' book is 
full of inaccuracies that are misleading, and for this reason should 
be ignored by the believers.  
     The Guardian is inexpressibly delighted at the news of the 
completion of the N.S.A.'s incorporation certificate, and would 
appreciate your sending him three photostat reproductions of 
the original, one of which he will arrange to be placed in the 
Mansion at &Bahji, and the second he will include in the next issue 
of "&Baha'i World", and the third he will keep in his own files.  
     The Guardian wishes me in closing to urge your Assembly to 
make a special effort during this year to concentrate on furthering 
the teaching work in Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Brighton, 
Sheffield and Bournemouth, in view of the teaching opportunities 
that these centres, as indicated in your letter, seem to offer at 
present.  He welcomes the recommendation made to this effect 
at the last Annual Convention and would urge the newly elected 
N.S.A. to give this task its continued and fullest attention.  
However stupendous the plan now confronting your Assembly 
may be, you should resolutely and relentlessly endeavour to 
carry it through, ever confident in the promised assistance and 
unfailing guidance of &Baha'u'llah.  
     To you and your distinguished fellow-members I beg to 
convey the assurances of his profound and loving appreciation of 
your loyal and affectionate greetings....  
 
+P128 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The extension, along sound lines and with such memorable 
swiftness and harmony, of the activities in which the believers of the 
United Kingdom are so earnestly and devotedly engaged, merits the 
highest praise and is a source of constant encouragement and 
satisfaction to me in my arduous work.  They are taking a momentous 
step forward and are launching enterprises that will no doubt shed 
fresh lustre on their beloved Faith and leave a distinct mark on &Baha'i 
history.  I will continue to pray on their behalf, and feel certain that if 
they persevere the Beloved will richly bless their concentrated and 
highly meritorious efforts.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
4 June 1939 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am charged by our beloved Guardian to inform you of the 
receipt of your letter of May 9th written on behalf of the British 
N.S.A. on the subject of the &Baha'i attitude towards war.  
     His instructions on this matter, conveyed in a letter addressed 
to your Assembly during last November, were not intended for 
that particular occasion, but were meant for present conditions, 
and for any such emergency as may arise in the immediate 
future.  
     It is still his firm conviction that the believers, while expressing 
their readiness to unreservedly obey any directions that the 
authorities may issue concerning national service in time of war, 
should also, and while there is yet no outbreak of hostilities, 
appeal to the government for exemption from active military 
service in a combatant capacity, stressing the fact that in doing 
so they are not prompted by any selfish considerations but by the 
sole and supreme motive of upholding the Teachings of their 
Faith, which make it a moral obligation for them to desist from 
any act that would involve them in direct warfare with their 
fellow-humans of any other race or nation.  The &Baha'i Teachings, 
indeed, condemn, emphatically and unequivocally, any form of 
physical violence, and warfare in the battlefield is obviously a 
form, and perhaps the worst form which such violence can 
assume.  
 
+P129 
     There are many other avenues through which the believers 
can assist in times of war by enlisting in services of a non-combatant 
nature--services that do not involve the direct 
shedding of blood--such as ambulance work, anti-air raid 
precaution service, office and administrative works, and it is for 
such types of national service that they should volunteer.  
     It is immaterial whether such activities would still expose 
them to dangers, either at home or in the front, since their desire 
is not to protect their lives, but to desist from any acts of wilful 
murder.  
     The friends should consider it their conscientious duty, as 
loyal members of the Faith, to apply for such exemption, even 
though there may be slight prospect of their obtaining the 
consent and approval of the authorities to their petition.  It is 
most essential that in times of such national excitement and 
emergency as those through which so many countries in the 
world are now passing that the believers should not allow 
themselves to be carried away by the passions agitating the 
masses, and act in a manner that would make them deviate from 
the path of wisdom and moderation, and lead them to violate, 
however reluctantly and indirectly, the spirit as well as the letter 
of the Teachings.  
     The N.S.A., in this and similar issues that may arise in future, 
should act with firmness and vigilance and with such wisdom 
and tact as would make them an example worthy of the 
confidence and admiration of all the believers....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the beloved bless and guide you in collaboration with your 
fellow members, to uphold the integrity, vindicate the truth, 
demonstrate the power, and promote the spirit of the exalted teachings 
of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
26 June 1939 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     On behalf of our beloved Guardian I beg to acknowledge 
with grateful thanks the receipt of your Assembly's communications 
 
+P130 
of May 26th and June 1st, together with the accompanying 
copy of the minutes of your meeting held on May 
20th-21st, and the latest issue of the "&Baha'i Journal" containing 
your Annual Report and the account of the Convention 
proceedings for this year.  
     He found the Annual Report published in the Journal so 
encouraging that he decided to have certain sections of it 
translated into Persian, and sent through the Haifa Assembly's 
newsletter, to different &Baha'i centres throughout the East.  
     In response to your request for one copy of each of the printed 
translations of Dr. Esslemont's book which the N.S.A. wishes to 
include as part of the &Baha'i exhibit at the forthcoming "Sunday 
Times" Book Exhibition to be held in London during next 
Autumn, the Guardian has directed me to mail to your address 
thirty-one printed translations of that book, which are the only 
ones available at present.  There are a few more translations in 
process of publication, among which, it will surely interest the 
friends to know, is the Icelandic version which, it is hoped, will 
be off the press sometime in the course of this Summer.  The new 
revised edition of the German translation, which is being 
published under the auspices of the International &Baha'i Bureau 
in Geneva, will be soon ready, and you can obtain a copy of that 
new edition by applying to Mrs. Lynch.  
     The Guardian does not want these books to be returned to 
Haifa after the closing of the Exhibition, but wishes you to 
accept them as his gift to the National &Baha'i Library at the 
Centre in London, and would suggest that you keep them for 
any future &Baha'i exhibit which the N.S.A. may propose to hold 
in other parts of England.  
     He wishes me, in this connection, to express the hope that the 
exhibition you have arranged for this coming Autumn will 
prove highly successful and a most useful and effective medium 
of teaching the Cause.  The idea of a &Baha'i display, chiefly of 
publications, he feels, is indeed excellent, and he will specially 
pray therefore that the one you are now preparing will achieve 
such results as to encourage and stimulate the N.S.A. to arrange 
for similar exhibits in the future.  
     Regarding the originals of Tablets revealed in honour of the 
late Miss Rosenberg, there are only one or two of them, here in 
Haifa, and these were sent by Miss Rosenberg herself.  The 
 
+P131 
Guardian is keeping them for the present as they contain 
important references concerning the practice of monogamy in 
the Cause.  
     To you and your dear fellow-members I seize this opportunity 
of renewing the assurances of his abiding and loving gratitude, 
and of wishing you continued guidance for the further 
promotion of the Faith in England....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The determination of the English believers to extend rapidly and 
systematically the range of their teaching and administrative activities 
is a welcome evidence of the genuineness of their faith, the nobility of 
their purpose and the depth of their devotion.  That such a determination 
may yield the richest fruit is my special and constant prayer.  What 
they have already achieved fortifies my hopes and confidence in them.  
They have laid a firm and unassailable basis for their future work.  
Perseverance, co-ordination, fearlessness, vigour and wisdom will 
enable them to gradually rear on this basis the majestic structure of 
&Baha'u'llah's administrative order, which in the fulness of time must 
yield, on the soil of their country a harvest unexampled in its 
abundance and glory.  May His Spirit guide and sustain them to 
hasten that hour and consummate that task.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Enclosed please find a draft for fifteen English pounds issued 
in your name which the Guardian has directed me to forward to 
you with the request that you send him for that sum copies of 
Mr. Townshend's "Heart of the Gospel", which he understands 
will be off the press in the course of this month.  
     May I take this opportunity of expressing his hope that this 
little volume may fulfil the author's purpose, namely to attract 
the attention of the orthodox Christian element in England to 
the Cause, and stimulate many thoughtful and spiritually minded 
individuals to seriously investigate the Teachings....

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     On behalf of our beloved Guardian I beg to acknowledge 
with grateful thanks the receipt of your communications dated 
July 11th, 20th, August 14th (2 letters) and October 19th with 
enclosures written on behalf of the British N.S.A.  
     He also wishes me to inform you that the photostatic 
reproductions of the incorporation papers of your Assembly 
have safely reached him, and he has placed one copy in 
&Baha'u'llah's Mansion in &Bahji, and is keeping the other for 
inclusion in the next issue of the "&Baha'i World".  
     The copies of Mr. Townshend's latest book, "The Heart of the 
Gospel", which you have forwarded at his request have likewise 
been received and a number of volumes distributed among the 
 
+F1 The Guardian only used his full name in cables when the censorship 
+F1 regulations during states of emergency made it obligatory.  
 
+P133 
various &Baha'i libraries established in the Holy Land.  He feels 
confident the N.S.A. is sparing no effort to bring this valuable 
production to the attention of leading personalities throughout 
the British Isles, and will pray that the interest aroused may be 
such as to lead to the full spiritual awakening and confirmation 
of a number of thoughtful individuals in various parts of the 
country.  
     As regards the projected prayer book; he does not know 
whether the N.S.A. has been able to proceed with the printing 
of this work.  But in case it is published, he would like you to 
mail to him twenty copies, some of which he needs for 
distribution among various &Baha'i libraries here.  
     The Guardian feels most truly delighted to know that the 
outbreak of war has, in general, stimulated the friends to greater 
teaching effort, and that the newly established communities such 
as those of Bradford and Torquay are showing particular 
enthusiasm in carrying on the teaching work in their respective 
centres.  He will earnestly supplicate the Almighty that He may 
bless and reinforce these steadfast and self-sacrificing exertions of 
the English believers, and that He may, in these days of storm 
and stress, vouchsafe unto them all an increasing measure of His 
unfailing protection and guidance....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     I wish to reaffirm clearly and emphatically my deep sense of 
gratification and gratitude for the recent and truly remarkable evidences 
of the devotion, courage and perseverance of the English &Baha'i 
community in the face of the perils that now confront it.  Its members 
have abundantly demonstrated their profound attachment to their 
Cause, their unshakable resolution to uphold its truth and defend its 
interests, and their unfailing solicitude for whatever may promote and 
safeguard its institutions.  However great and sinister the forces with 
which they may have to battle in future, I feel confident that they will 
befittingly uphold the torch of Divine Guidance that has been 
entrusted to their hands and will discharge their responsibilities with 
still greater tenacity, fidelity, vigour and devotion.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     The Guardian has just received your letter of the 20th 
November last, and feels indeed deeply encouraged at the report 
of the teaching activities of our dear English believers.  He is 
unspeakably grateful to you all, and in particular to the members 
of your Assembly, for the determination, resourcefulness and the 
spirit of absolute consecration with which you are prosecuting 
the teaching campaign throughout England, and he will ardently 
pray that, in spite of the smallness of your numbers and means, 
and notwithstanding the various obstacles you may encounter in 
the course of your future activities for the Faith, you may, 
individually and collectively, receive such confirmations from 
&Baha'u'llah as would enable you each and all to befittingly and 
completely acquit yourselves of this high task you have 
undertaken to accomplish in service of His Faith.  
     In connection with your application for exemption from 
active military service, the Guardian trusts that the authorities 
will give careful consideration to this matter, and will find it 
possible to relieve the &Baha'i friends from the necessity of serving 
in the army in a combatant capacity.  Should they, however, 
refuse to grant such exemption, the believers should unhesitatingly 
assure them of their unqualified obedience and of their 
readiness to join and serve in the army in whatever manner the 
government deems best.  
     Renewing to you and to all the friends his warmest good 
wishes and greetings....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The various and compelling evidences of the unquenchable

the English believers, in these days of stress, of turmoil and danger, 
have cheered my heart and fortified me in the discharge of my arduous 
and multitudinous duties and responsibilities.  I feel truly proud of 
them all, and will, with increasing gratitude and redoubled fervour, 
supplicate the Beloved whose Cause they are so valiantly serving, to 
bless, sustain, guide and protect them under all circumstances, and aid 
them to establish firmly the institutions of His Faith throughout the 
length and breadth of their country.

29 December 1939 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge 
with thanks the receipt of your communication of the 19th 
December, sent through the care of our very dear brother Dr. 
&Ali, and of the twenty copies of the newly-published prayer 
book, as well as the last copy of the "&Baha'i Journal" and the 
Christmas number of "New World Order".  
     He has also received and read with deep satisfaction the 
statement on `&Baha'is and War' recently issued by the N.S.A., 
together with the teaching report prepared by your Assembly, 
both of which he will consider for incorporation in the next 
issue of the "&Baha'i World", the manuscript of which he hopes to 
receive in the course of January or February next....  
     The Guardian welcomes the plan suggested by Mr. Townshend 
to republish "The Promise of All Ages" under his own 
name, and trusts this will serve to attract wider publicity to the 
Cause, and in particular to fully awaken the church officials to 
the significance of such direct and vigorous presentation of the 
Faith by so well-known and long-standing a Christian divine.  
     Renewing to you and your dear fellow-members and to all 
the friends in London, the assurances of his prayers for your 
welfare and protection in these perilous days, and with his 
warmest greetings to you all....  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The news of your persistent activities, your safety and protection,

for you, and will continue to supplicate the Almighty on your behalf.

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     The Guardian wishes me to write and thank you for your 
welcome communication of January 29th with its various 
enclosures, all of which he was indeed most gratified and 
encouraged to read.  
     As you have not mentioned having received his general letter 
of December 21st written in connection with the transfer of the 
sacred remains of the Purest Branch and of &Abdu'l-Baha's 
mother to Mt. Carmel, I am taking the liberty of sending you on 
his behalf another copy which, I trust, will reach you safely....  
     The Guardian welcomes your suggestions to send a memorial 
of the late Lady Blomfield for publication in the next issue of the 
 
+F1 Lady Blomfield passed away 31 December 1939.  
 
+P137 
"&Baha'i World", Vol. VIII, and wishes you to send him in 
addition a good photograph of her for reproduction in the same 
volume.  
     Also he would appreciate your sending him a brief account of 
Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper's &Baha'i life and services together 
with her photograph for publication in the same issue of the 
Biennial.  
     The passing away of these two long-standing believers has 
indeed robbed the Cause in England of two of its most 
distinguished members, and the English &Baha'i Community is 
certainly the poorer now that it has been deprived of their ready 
and invaluable support.  
     The departure of &Sitarih &Khanum in particular is to be deeply 
mourned, not only by the members of the Faith throughout 
England, but by so many of her fellow-believers abroad, and the 
Guardian himself feels most keenly the loss of so precious and 
faithful a co-worker, who, in the early days following &Abdu'l-Baha's 
ascension, had proved of such invaluable assistance to him 
in the discharge of his heavy duties and responsibilities....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers, 
     I wish to reaffirm my deep sense of gratitude and admiration for the 
splendid manner in which the English believers are discharging their 
duties and responsibilities in these days of increasing peril, anxiety 
and stress.  Their tenacity, courage, faith and noble exertions will as a 
magnet attract the undoubted and promised blessing of &Baha'u'llah.  
They have, at a time when the basis of ordered society itself is rocking 
and trembling, laid an unassailable foundation for the Administrative 
Order of their Faith.  Upon this basis the rising generation will erect 
a noble structure that will excite the admiration of their fellow 
countrymen.  My prayers for them will continually be offered at the 
Holy Shrines.  
                                    Gratefully,

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     Your letter dated March 13th has safely reached our beloved 
Guardian together with the following enclosures:  
 
+P138 
     In Memoriam:  Lady Blomfield.  
     Minutes N.S.A. March 2nd and 3rd.  
     "&Baha'i Journal" No. 21.  
     Introduction to "The Chosen Highway".  
     Preface to "The Chosen Highway".  
 
He has also received by registered post the photographs of Lady 
Blomfield and Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper which you had kindly 
sent at his request for reproduction in the "&Baha'i World"....  
     The Guardian has noted with satisfaction that the arrangements 
for the publication of "The Chosen Highway" are complete, and 
hopes that by the time you receive this letter it will be well on 
the way to printing.  
     Concerning the question you have asked as to whether in 
elections for Spiritual Assemblies the electors should cast exactly 
nine votes, or may cast less than this number.  Inasmuch as 
Spiritual Assembly membership, according to the principles of 
&Baha'i Administration, has been limited for the present to nine 
members, it follows that no electoral vote can be effective unless 
it is cast for exactly that number.  It is, therefore, the sacred duty 
of every &Baha'i elector to cast nine votes, neither more nor less, 
except under special circumstances, so as to ensure that the results 
of the elections for the Spiritual Assembly will be effective and 
on as wide a basis of representation as possible....  
 
     P.S.  The Guardian has noted with surprise in reading over the 
Minutes of your N.S.A. that the British Annual Convention is 
to be held this year on the 12th May.  He wishes you from now 
on to hold that gathering on any day during the period of 
&Ridvan (21 April-2 May)  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, sustain and protect the English believers, 
who in these days of unprecedented turmoil, stress and danger, are 
holding aloft so courageously the banner of the Faith, and who will, 
in the days to come, contribute, through His grace and power, a notable 
share to its establishment and recognition in the West.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 7th 
addressed to our beloved Guardian, and of the enclosed memoir 
of Lady Blomfield which you have condensed at his request for 
use in the "&Baha'i World", Vol. VIII.  
     The size of the memoir in question makes it now quite suitable 
for reproduction in the Biennial, and it will be forwarded to the 
U.S.A. for incorporation in the manuscript, as the latter has been 
already mailed to America for printing.  
     The material regarding the &Baha'i wedding recently held in 
London has been also received and noted with interest and 
appreciation by our beloved Guardian.  He is keeping it for 
possible use in the forthcoming or future editions of the "&Baha'i 
World".  
     Renewing to you and your dear co-workers the assurances of 
his prayers, and of his deep gratitude for your painstaking and 
devoted exertions in service to the Cause in England, and with 
greetings....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     Our anxiety for the safety of the English believers is deepening 
every day, as it is fully realised how dangerous the situation has 
 
+P140 
become in recent months, and how manifold and pressing are the 
problems that confront them in the faithful discharge of their sacred 
and vital responsibilities.  The perusal of the reports, minutes and 
periodicals received lately from that country has served to deepen my 
sense of admiration and my feelings of gratitude for the wisdom, the 
staunchness and fidelity with which the elected representatives of the 
English believers are conducting in these critical times the activities of 
their Faith.  My fervent and constant prayer is that &Baha'u'llah may 
ever keep them safe and protected under the shadow of His wings and 
aid them to play a worthy and memorable part in these tragic days of 
the Formative Period of our beloved Cause.  
                                                            Shoghi

Dear Mr. Hofman, 
     On behalf of the Guardian I beg to acknowledge the receipt 
of your communications dated May 28th, June 20th, July 5th 
and August 30th with enclosures, written at the direction of the 
British N.S.A.  
     He has noted with satisfaction the results of the elections for 
the new N.S.A. and wishes you to convey to your fellow 
members the assurances of his prayers for the success of their 
work during this year.  Notwithstanding the storm and stress 
raging around them, the friends in England should more than 
ever, firmly united behind their National Assembly, and 
strengthened by an unshakable conviction in the ultimate 
triumph of their Faith, earnestly and resolutely endeavour to 
foster the cause of teaching.  The trials and tribulations facing 
them should but serve to steel their resolve to leave no stone 
unturned until their goal has been fully accomplished.  The 
 
+P141 
Guardian's prayers are being ardently offered that whatever the 
immediate repercussions of the war may be on the British &Baha'i 
Community, its members may, through the Divine aid and 
protection of &Baha'u'llah, receive such guidance and strength as 
would enable them to face confidently and courageously the 
sufferings and vicissitudes of the present hour, and to arise as one 
body for the promulgation and wider establishment of the Faith 
throughout Great Britain.  
     Concerning your Assembly's request for lantern slides of the 
Shrines on Mt. Carmel which you propose to use in your 
teaching campaign, the Guardian much regrets that no such 
slides are at present available here.  
     As regards the question of what procedure the &Baha'i 
Assemblies should adopt when dissatisfied with the services of 
any of their officers, should such dissatisfaction involve the 
loyalty of an Assembly officer to the Faith, he should, following 
a majority vote be dismissed.  But in case the dissatisfaction is due 
to the incompetence of a member, or simply to a neglect on his 
part to discharge his duties, this does not constitute sufficient 
justification to force his resignation or dismissal from the 
Assembly.  He should be kept in office until new elections are 
held.  
     The Guardian fully approves that, in view of the National 
Secretary's key position in the Cause at the present time, he 
should apply for complete exemption.  He hopes that the 
representations the N.S.A. will make will meet with success.  
     In closing he wishes me to acknowledge with thanks the 
receipt of two copies of Lady Blomfield's book presented to him 
by the N.S.A., one of which he has already placed in the Library 
of &Baha'u'llah's Mansion in &Bahji....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     I was greatly relieved to learn of the safety of the English believers 
and was filled with admiration through the assurance you have given 
me of their steadfastness, their unwavering determination to labour for 
the spread of our beloved Faith and the defence and protection of its 
interests in spite of the unprecedented calamities and confusion that 
now afflict their country.  &Baha'u'llah from His station on high is 
watching over them, is pleased with them, and will, I feel certain, 
 
+P142 
guide their steps, cheer their hearts, bless their efforts, protect their 
lives, and fulfil the desire of their hearts.  
                                    Gratefully and affectionately,

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter to him 
of December 9th, 1940.  
     He was greatly relieved to hear from your letter and cables 
that all the dear friends in the British Isles are well and safe, as his 
thoughts have been so constantly with them during these 
dangerous and tragic days.  
     The extreme devotion to the Faith of &Baha'u'llah which the 
English friends are evincing at such a time of trial and suffering 
not only sets a truly heroic example to their fellow &Baha'is the 
world over, but greatly cheers and encourages the Guardian 
himself, at a time when he has every reason to long to see the 
&Baha'is stand out as luminous examples to their fellow-men--
thus leading them out of the valley of spiritual death into the 
glorious plains of the future World Order of Mankind.  
     The recently received news of the Convention's resolve to 
teach the Faith as never before in those islands, and to achieve 
new victories in this all-important field, meets not only with 
Shoghi Effendi's whole-hearted approval, but also evokes his 
profound gratitude and admiration.  His ardent and loving 
prayers continually surround you all and all the sorely tried 
&Baha'is, who with you are toiling for the triumph of our Faith.  
     He was deeply touched at the spirit which impelled Lord 
Lamington to wish to place in the hands of the Guardian that 
ring which he had for so long treasured as a gift of the beloved 
Master.  He feels that it is only befitting that this historic relic 
should be the property of the British &Baha'is and wishes it to be 
kept in your National Archives.  If you could send a copy of Lady 
Lamington's letter the Guardian would very much like to have 
it.  Assuring you of the Guardian's ardent love and prayers....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved co-workers, 
     The message I have recently received, with the assurance it gives me 
and the spirit it conveys, merits indeed the highest praise.  The English 
believers in these days of increasing peril and stress, are manifesting 
 
+F1 This was the first letter received by the British N.S.A. in which the 
+F1 secretarial part was written by, and signed, "R. &Rabbani" (&Amatu'l-Baha 
+F1 &Ruhiyyih &Khanum).  
 
+P144 
those qualities which only those who have deeply imbibed the 
transforming spirit and the ennobling principles of the Cause of God 
are able to reveal.  They are by their very acts, their sufferings and 
exertions, and above all by the superb staunchness of their faith, laying 
a magnificent foundation for the spiritual edifice their hands are 
destined to raise in their native land.  My prayers for them all will 
surround them wherever they labour and in every sphere of their 
meritorious activities.  
                                    Gratefully and affectionately, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Shoghi Effendi instructs me to answer your letter to him of 
March 10th, 1941 together with the minutes of your meeting 
held March 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and your Feb. "&Baha'i Journal" and 
the "World Congress of Faiths" programme, all of which he was 
very pleased indeed to receive.  
     I cannot adequately express to you all the warm love and 
profound admiration for the &Baha'is of those islands which 
Shoghi Effendi feels.  At such a time of personal danger and 
anguish the spirit of pure love and devotion to the Faith and 
Order of &Baha'u'llah which they manifest, and which is so 
typified by the zeal and wisdom with which your National 
Spiritual Assembly is handling the affairs of the Cause in that 
country, is a source of great comfort to the Guardian himself.  
     Indeed he feels that the N.S.A. members are bearing their load 
of responsibility in a manner which lifts partially the weight of 
cares from his own shoulders, and sets a noble example to all 
&Baha'i administrative bodies.

+P145 
     In reference to your question contained in minute 208+F1 of the 
recent N.S.A. meeting:  Shoghi Effendi feels that while all &Baha'is 
should be encouraged to turn to their Assembly for the solution 
of their various problems, thus enabling the Spiritual Assembly 
to fulfil one of its most important functions, yet they are quite 
free to write to him if they feel the urge to do so....  
     He was also very pleased to note the teaching plans undertaken 
by your body at this time, particularly in respect to Manchester.  
He hopes the believers there are all well and safe, and will pray 
for the confirmations of &Baha'u'llah in their contemplated 
teaching campaign.  
     Indeed, dear friends, his thoughts and prayers are constantly 
with you and the beloved flock of English believers over whom 
you are so faithfully watching through these dark days.  
     He wishes you at all times to turn to him for any advice or 
help you may need.  
                                    With assurances of his abiding love...  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved co-workers, 
     As the dangers confronting the believers in the British Isles increase 
in number and gravity, my admiration, as well as the admiration of 
the &Baha'is in East and West, for the spirit that animates those who 
face them, grows deeper and acquires added intensity and fervour.  
Though their numbers be small, and their activities restricted, and 
their trials and anxieties manifold and oppressive, yet their spiritual 
contribution through their fortitude, valour and self-sacrifice, to the 
progressive unfoldment of the Faith's latent potentialities in the 
Western World is both notable and constantly increasing.  As 
the clouds of war dissipate, and the horrors of this universal carnage 
fade away, it will become increasingly evident, to both the friends and 
foes of the Faith, how solid has been the foundation which their 
indomitable spirit has laid, and how rich the harvest which their 
incessant labours have yielded.  
     With a heart brimful with love and gratitude, I will, when visiting 
the Holy Shrines, recall their signal acts, and supplicate increasing 
blessings on the historic work, which, in their hour of trial, they are 
so magnificently achieving, for the glory, for the honour, the extension 
and the establishment of the invincible Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i co-worker, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letter to him 
of May 6th, and to acknowledge the receipt of the minutes of the 
N.S.A. meetings held on April 25th and 27th.  
     He was very happy to receive your letter, and his heart 
rejoiced at the good news which it conveyed.  The holding of a 
successful &Baha'i Convention during days of such stress and strain 
as the English believers are passing through, he considers as a 
triumph of the spirit of their faith in &Baha'u'llah.  They are 
increasingly demonstrating their right to be called champions of 
the Cause of God, and manifesting their ability to follow in the 
footsteps of the early heroes of their religion.  The Guardian feels 
truly proud of them.  
     In accordance with the request you made in connection with 
the generous proposal of ..., Shoghi Effendi cabled your 
Assembly his approval of their plan for establishing a building 
fund for a future &Baha'i property to be built in....  He feels that 
this demonstrates a most notable donation to the Cause of God 
on their parts, and wishes you to convey to them both the 
 
+P147 
expression of his profound gratitude for this service they are 
rendering the Faith in England.  
     These evidences of growth, in spite of the universal destruction 
that is holding the planet in its grip at the present time, should 
greatly hearten the believers.  They bear witness to the future 
harvests which their increasing labours are sure to reap, and 
demonstrate the great and God-given strength which flows and 
will flow ever more abundantly from the springs which 
&Baha'u'llah has unsealed in these days.  
     Shoghi Effendi assures you all of his unceasing prayers on your 
behalf, that God may strengthen, bless, and guide you in your 
great work for His Faith.  
     He wishes you to please convey his love to all the British 
believers and to assure them of his prayers for their protection 
and for the triumph of their labours....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-workers, 
     I am thrilled by the recent evidences of the noble determination of 
the English believers to extend the range of their activities in these 
days of grave danger and widespread and ever deepening anxiety and 
stress.  The report of your Convention sessions, of your teaching 
activities and of your &Baha'i publications, and other administrative 
undertakings, enhances my admiration and deepens my gratitude for 
the historic work you are achieving in these days.  This feeling is 
shared by all those of your co-workers, both in the East and the West, 
who follow the progress of your work despite the formidable obstacles 
in your path.  We all pray for your safety, for the realisation of all your 
hopes, and the fulfilment of the plans you have so boldly conceived and 
are so energetically carrying out.  
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friend, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters to him 
dated June 6th and 30th respectively, also the minutes of the 
N.S.A. meetings of May 24th and 25th and June 14th were 
safely received.  
     He is happy to see that, in spite of the great physical and 
nervous strain which the believers of England are at present 
being subjected to--especially in centres like London--they yet 
persevere with the work of the Cause and the attraction of new 
souls.  
     The Guardian does not feel that the friends should for a 
moment feel discouraged if they do not succeed in having large 
meetings or the public do not regularly attend, this is easily 
understandable in view of the severe ordeal which their present 
sufferings subject them to.  However, the importance of 
broadcasting the seeds of the Cause far and wide can never be 
sufficiently stressed.  It is the right and privilege of organised 
humanity to hear of the Faith and the Plan of &Baha'u'llah in these 
days, and in this holy duty to their fellow men the &Baha'is must 
not fail whatever may be the sadness of their personal plight, for 
they alone can truly see the future in the tragic present, and 
possess hope and strength to go on with the spiritual battle for 
the victory of the New Day.  
     Regarding the question you have put to the Guardian 
concerning minute No. 259, whatever is not laid down in "&Baha'i 
Administration" is left to the judgement of the National Spiritual 
Assembly to decide.  These are purely secondary details and as the 
Guardian wishes to avoid introducing into the administration a 
labyrinth of rules and regulations he leaves the friends in 
authority to decide such matters as they arise.  
     He hopes the Summer School will be a success.  In all your 
undertakings you may rest assured of his constant and most 
loving prayers, not only for the National Assembly members, 
but for each and every member of the flock they are watching 
over and guiding....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The report of your continued activities, conducted amid the turmoil 
 
+P149 
that oppresses and afflicts the English believers, is a source of continual 
joy and inspiration to me, as well as those who, in distant parts of the 
&Baha'i world are made to realise the unwavering constancy with 
which you are all upholding the vital interests of the Faith of God.  
That the teaching work is speedily expanding, that the institutions of 
the Faith are functioning with vigour and in accordance with the 
principles of the Administrative Order, testify to the solidity of the 
foundations that have been established.  On this foundation you will 
as the present hindrances are removed, and the tremendous reactions 
of this conflict are made apparent, rear an edifice worthy of the name, 
and attesting the glory of the Faith, of &Baha'u'llah.  Persevere in your 
present labours and be ever confident.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters dated 
June 30th, Aug. 20th, Sept. 5th, Oct. 20th and 28th (duplicates 
of both received) and December 23rd and to acknowledge the 
receipt of the various minutes, programmes, etc., which they 
enclosed.  
     Regarding ..., Shoghi Effendi is writing him direct, advising 
 
+P150 
him to sever his membership in the Synagogue, but to continue 
to maintain friendly association with the members of its 
community.  
     The Guardian was very happy indeed to hear of the success of 
the Summer School and the enthusiasm that prevailed.  He has 
received news of it from some of the friends, as well as the 
N.S.A., and feels that the English &Baha'is have every reason to 
feel encouraged and proud of the way their tireless efforts are 
being rewarded.  
     The good news of the increase in &Baha'i membership is yet 
another evidence of the vitality of the community and the 
activity of the friends, in spite of the gloom of the times, which 
increasingly prevails.  Indeed as material affairs go from bad to 
worse in the world, the confidence, optimism, love and hope of 
the believers will, by force of contrast, shine out as an ever 
brighter beacon, leading the people to the Path of Truth, the 
way laid down by God, which alone can guide them to the 
promise of the future.  
     Now that the British Isles have a respite from intense aerial 
warfare, no doubt the friends, especially in London and other 
cities, find themselves more refreshed and consequently better 
able to carry on the work of the Cause.  They should not lose any 
time in consolidating the teaching work, reinforcing new 
centres, and enlarging their numbers.  
     The Guardian is urging the American friends, also, to redouble 
their efforts and not lose their precious opportunities.  The value 
of work accomplished at present is inestimable, and opportunities 
lost are in a way quite irretrievable, as the agony of mankind 
moves forward to a climax....  
     The many activities undertaken by the English friends, their 
determined efforts to bring the Cause before a wider public and 
reach people of outstanding importance, their new centres and 
study groups, are all signs which should greatly encourage them 
and demonstrate to them that the Holy Spirit is ever ready to 
sustain and reinforce the believers in all work for the good of our 
precious Faith.  
     The Guardian assures the members of the National Assembly 
of his most loving prayers on their behalf and his deep and 
abiding appreciation of their tireless services.  They are helping 
the friends to build an edifice which neither time nor tide shall 
 
+P151 
undermine and which needs must become the sole refuge for 
their sorely tried countrymen....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     I wish to assure you again of my feelings of profound gratitude for 
the manner in which you are performing your sacred task and 
discharging, individually and collectively, your pressing and manifold 
responsibilities.  I rejoice and am deeply thankful to learn that the trials 
and tribulations that so fiercely assailed you in the past have lessened 
and have failed to interfere with the progress of your activities.  
&Baha'u'llah will no doubt continue to guide, sustain and protect you 
in the days to come and is well pleased with the marvellous evidences 
of your perseverance, unity, loyalty and devotion.  I will continue to 
supplicate His abundant blessing for you all, that your numbers may 
steadily increase, your community life be continually enriched, your 
institutions flourish and multiply, and the foundation of your 
individual spiritual lives be strengthened.  Persevere in your high 
labours.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

20 June 1942 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     The Guardian has instructed me to answer your letters written 
on behalf of the National Assembly, and dated Feb. 6th, March 
17th and April 6th, and to acknowledge the receipt of the 
minutes of the Jan. and March meetings of your Assembly 
together with other enclosures.  
     In pursuance of your request the Guardian wrote to Mr. and 
 
+P152 
Mrs. Hill about the tragic and unexpected passing of their 
daughter.  He also felt moved to cable them his condolences and 
the assurance of his prayers.  This must have been for them a very 
grievous blow; but he feels sure the deep assurances concerning 
the future life, which have been given us by &Baha'u'llah, have 
comforted and sustained them throughout.  
     He was pleased to read the sympathetic letter you received 
from ex-President Benes of Czechoslovakia, as well as that of Sir 
Ronald Storrs.  Many men in high positions are aware now of the 
existence and aims of our Faith, but they do not yet reckon it to 
be a movement worthy of more profound interest on their part.  
As time goes by, however, we may rest assured their interest will 
grow.  
     That is perhaps what is most glorious about our present 
activities all over the world, that we, a band not large in 
numbers, not possessing financial backing or the prestige of great 
names, should, in the name of our beloved Faith, be forging 
ahead at such a pace, and demonstrating to future and present 
generations that it is the God-given qualities of our religion that 
are raising it up and not the transient support of worldly fame 
and power.  All that will come later, when it has been made clear 
beyond the shadow of a doubt that what raised aloft the banner 
of &Baha'u'llah was the love, sacrifice and devotion of His humble 
followers and the change that His teachings wrought in their 
hearts and lives.  
     It is just such exemplary devotion and perseverance that the 
British &Baha'is are showing at present, and their reward cannot 
but be great and lasting.  The laying of the foundation is a slow 
process, but the most important one in the erection of any 
structure.  The Guardian feels that your Assembly, as well as the 
friends in England, have every reason to feel proud of, and 
encouraged by, the way the work is progressing there.  
     He hopes that your Summer School this year will be even 
more successful than last year, in spite of being held in two parts.  
You may be sure he will pray for its success.  
     He fully realises the difficulties you are undergoing enhanced 
by the war and its hardships, yet he sees, perhaps even more 
clearly than you yourselves can, that these very difficulties and 
the surmounting of them are deepening and strengthening the 
ties that bind you all to our beloved Faith, and enabling you to 
 
+P153 
do a work which only future generations of your countrymen 
will be able to properly appreciate and assess.  
     Please convey to all the dear friends the assurances of his love 
and his prayers for their service in these days, and his high hopes 
for the future that awaits them in the days to come, when the 
Cause of God begins to emerge above the waves of the old order 
and shines forth in all its strength and beauty.  
     Assuring you and all your fellow-members of his deep 
appreciation of your tireless work and his ardent prayers for 
your guidance and strength....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved co-worker, 
     The steady progress and extension of &Baha'i activities in the British 
Isles is, no doubt, the direct consequence of the unswerving loyalty, the 
high courage, the incorruptible spirit and the exemplary devotion and 
steadfastness of the British believers, who have, simply and strikingly, 
demonstrated the quality of their faith and the soundness of their 
institutions in these days of unprecedented commotion, stress and peril.  
I feel proud of their record of service and of the evidence of their noble 
faith.  The Beloved watches over them from the &Abha Kingdom.  The 
Concourse on High extols their achievements and will reinforce their 
endeavours.  They should confidently, gratefully, joyously and unitedly 
redouble their efforts, extend the range of their activities, rededicate 
themselves to their historic task and anticipate a renewed outpouring 
of &Baha'u'llah's promised blessings and favours.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters of May 14th and June 10th together with their 
enclosures reached the Guardian safely, and he has instructed me 
to answer you on his behalf.  
     He has been very gratified to hear of the successful Summer 
School sessions, news of the Buxton one having just recently 
reached him in your latest cable.  He feels that you must all be 
very encouraged that this new way of holding them in different 
places, which circumstances made imperative, has proved so 
successful in the end.  It presages the day when the friends in 
England will see the institutions of their Faith rising from various 
flourishing centres.  
     Regarding minute No. 507, the Guardian feels that it would 
be better for either the mothers of &Baha'i children--or some 
committee your Assembly might delegate the task to--to choose 
excerpts from the Sacred Words to be used by the child rather 
than just something made up.  Of course prayer can be purely 
spontaneous, but many of the sentences and thoughts combined 
in &Baha'i writings of a devotional nature are easy to grasp, and 
the revealed Word is endowed with a power of its own....  
     Shoghi Effendi fully realises the strain which those who are so 
actively bearing the weight of &Baha'i responsibility are subjected 
to in these days, when already, as private individuals, the events 
of the world are affecting their lives and drawing on their 
strength.  It makes the quality of &Baha'i service so much finer, 
that it should entail on the part of all definite self-sacrifice.  
     Though the friends may not be fully aware of it, their staunch 
perseverance in carrying out their &Baha'i activities in the face of 
war conditions, is really in itself of historic importance.  
Convention, Summer Schools, meetings, all are not only 
demonstrating the calibre of their faith, but also evincing marked 
progress, all of which greatly cheers and delights the Guardian.  
 
+P155 
     He assures you and your fellow-members of the National 
Spiritual Assembly, of his continued prayers on your behalf, that 
you may be guided, protected and sustained in your devoted 
services to the Faith....  
     P.S.--Shoghi Effendi is deeply interested in the plans you are 
developing to aid and attract more young people to the Faith.  He 
feels this is both praiseworthy and a valuable method of teaching 
the Cause.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker, 
     The work so splendidly initiated by the English believers and so 
devotedly and energetically pursued and consolidated in these days of 
peril, uncertainty and turmoil, establishes beyond any doubt their right 
to claim to be the true upholders and custodians of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah.  They have, ever since the outbreak of this world wide 
conflict, abundantly demonstrated the high quality of their faith, the 
soundness of their institutions, the intensity of their devotion, and 
their capacity to defend and promote the interests of their beloved 
Cause.  Impelled by admiration and gratitude for the work they have 
already accomplished, I have contributed a sum which I trust will 
enable them to extend the range of their teaching activities throughout 
the British Isles.  May the Beloved graciously assist them to achieve 
such victories in this field as shall truly befit the conclusion of the first 
century of the &Baha'i Era.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated July 19th 1942, Aug. 20th 1942, Sept. 15th 
1942, and Dec. 8th 1942 have all reached the Guardian safely, as 
well as their enclosures, and he has instructed me to answer them 
on his behalf.  
     This last year he has been greatly overburdened with work, 
and that is why he so frequently has to delay the answering of his 
many letters.  
     The good news you conveyed of the marked success of the 
various Summer Schools held last year pleased him greatly.  
When the English friends remember that it is not many years 
since they ventured on their first Summer School and now, 
during war time, they have managed to hold four successful 
ones, they should feel very encouraged and proud!  It shows that 
when the determination is strong and the faith firm, the friends 
can work wonders and surprise even themselves!  
     He was also delighted to hear of the successful teaching work 
and public meetings undertaken in Bradford and Manchester, 
and that the advertisements and publicity which you are 
sponsoring are meeting with a certain amount of response from 
the public.  
     He hopes that some of the friends will find it possible to move, 
at least temporarily, to centres where sufficient believers, or 
interested enquirers exist to enable a Spiritual Assembly to be 
formed by 1944.  If such work is feasible it is, indeed, of great 
importance and well worth the sacrifices involved.  This policy 
 
+P157 
of settlement has been fruitful in both India and the United 
States, and as soon as a determined and active Assembly is started 
it is, of course, much easier to teach and carry on the work of the 
Cause.  
     The burdens everyone has to bear these days are heavy, and 
the way often seems long and hard which we and our fellow-men 
in general, are called upon to tread; but we know where it 
leads and what our work is and what that work must ultimately 
mean to not only the &Baha'is but the whole world.  This 
knowledge strengthens us and enables us to go on with a faith 
and confidence which cannot but help and inspire others.  We are 
&Baha'u'llah's army and we cannot fail, as He leads us on.  
     The Guardian assures you and all the N.S.A. members of his 
most loving prayers.  The English friends are increasingly dear to 
him, and he has great hopes for their future achievements.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The evidences of renewed activity in the teaching field are most 
encouraging and the spirit which animates the English believers in 
these days of stress and peril is highly inspiring.  As the first &Baha'i 
century draws to a close, a supreme effort should be exerted by the 
believers in order to consummate befittingly the task they have arisen 
to achieve.  I will pray with all my heart that the hopes they cherish 
may be realised, and their continued labours be crowned with glorious 
success.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters, written on behalf of the National Spiritual 
Assembly, and dated Oct. 22nd 1942, Feb. 18th 1943 and April 
12th and May 11th, have all been received, and the Guardian has 
instructed me to answer them on his behalf.  
 
+P159 
     He was very pleased to hear that the publicity you are giving 
the Faith is meeting with a wider response than has hitherto been 
the case, and he hopes that the N.S.A. and local Assemblies will 
organise their efforts in such a way as to enable them to draw 
enquirers closer to the Cause and, if possible, meet with them 
and include them in suitable teaching classes.  
     Regarding the matter of &Fuad &Afnan's grave, the Guardian has 
no objection to its being built.  
     He feels that &Baha'is who, though still considering themselves 
believers, omit attending the 19 Day Feasts for long periods, 
should not be deprived of their voting rights; they should, 
however, be encouraged to attend these Feasts as often as possible.  
     In less than a year the &Baha'is the world over will be 
celebrating the 100th anniversary of their Faith, and the 
Guardian is very anxious that the British believers should 
commemorate this historic occasion befittingly.  He would, 
therefore, suggest that your Assembly take up the following 
points for deliberation as soon as possible:  
 
 1.  The holding of a large and representative gathering, attended 
     by the &Baha'is and the public alike, in a hired hall in London 
     on the 23rd May 1944.  He feels that prominent friends and 
     sympathisers of the Faith should be invited to speak on this 
     occasion, as well as &Baha'is, and that every effort should be 
     made to make the gathering both festive and dignified, as 
     befits so blessed and solemn an occasion.  
 2.  The publication of a Centenary Pamphlet outlining the 
     important events of the Faith, and with a special emphasis 
     placed on the rise and development of the Cause in England, 
     its early history in that country, the achievements of the 
     friends in spreading the Teachings there and establishing the 
     administration, the formation of the Publishing Trust, and so 
     on. 
 3.  He wishes your Assembly to call the annual &Baha'i Convention 
     for days that will include the 22nd May, so that all the 
     assembled friends may be present at a special &Baha'i meeting 
     to be held at 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset on May 
     22nd as this is the exact time at which the &Bab made His first 
     historic declaration of His mission to &Mulla &Husayn.  
 
     In order to aid the dear English believers in their befitting 
 
+P160 
celebration of so glorious an occasion the Guardian is forwarding 
to your Assembly the sum of two hundred pounds sterling to be 
used for the arrangements you deem fit to make, and the 
publication of the above mentioned pamphlet.  The &Baha'i 
communities all over the world--wherever free to do so--will 
also be celebrating this memorable day, each according to its 
capacity, and he is very anxious that the British &Baha'is should, 
as befits their increasingly prominent position in the &Baha'i 
World, demonstrate to the public and to their fellow believers, 
the vitality of their community and the marked advancement it 
has made of late.  He leaves all details to the discretion of your 
Assembly.  
     Mr. Yool of Manchester was recently able to spend his leave 
in Haifa at the Western Pilgrim House, and the Guardian was so 
happy to welcome one of the English friends here.  He hopes that 
after the war many will be able to make the pilgrimage.  They 
will be most welcome.  
     Assuring you and all the members of the N.S.A. of his loving 
prayers and his ardent hopes for the success of this great 
celebration which you will now be planning....  
     P.S.  The Guardian recently cabled asking you to forward a 
complete list of all Spiritual Assemblies in the British Isles and 
the name of every locality where one or more believers reside.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     I pray that the celebration of the Centenary of our beloved Faith by 
the English believers may be a remarkable success.  The committee that 
will have to be appointed for this purpose must strain every nerve, 
explore every avenue, and lose no time in order to ensure the 
unqualified success of this undertaking.  I will supplicate the Beloved 
to guide every step you take, to aid you to surmount all obstacles, and 
to inspire you to undertake the measures that are most conducive to the 
proper discharge of your noble task.  The widest possible publicity 
should be given to the Faith by every means at your disposal.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
4 August 1943 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters, written on behalf of the National Spiritual 
 
+P161 
Assembly and dated May 14th and June 6th have been received, 
together with the minutes of the April and May N.S.A. meetings, 
and the Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his 
behalf.  
     He was very encouraged to see the number of places where 
there are now one or two registered &Baha'is residing, as these are 
beacons of the Faith--however lonely and however, as yet, 
feeble the light they are able to radiate.  
     The Guardian feels that it would be an excellent plan if some 
way could be found to raise Bournemouth and Torquay to 
Assembly status; either through some self-sacrificing souls 
moving to these places and thus giving them the required 
number, or through the efforts of the local and visiting teachers.  
With the Centenary of the Faith so rapidly approaching it seems 
a great pity that England should be deprived of these two 
Assemblies, when each one of them only requires one person to 
bring it to Assembly status.  
     Regarding the questions you asked in connection with the 
following minutes of the N.S.A. meetings:  
 
753.  The Guardian advises you to consult Canon Townshend, 
      and if he considers it advisable to compile a pamphlet for 
      distribution to the clergy you could get one out along the 
      lines he might suggest as suitable.  
754.  He would not advise any special contact being made with 
      the Swedenborgians as the Master's reference is not 
      sufficiently clear and emphatic to warrant it.  
755.  The Guardian does not believe you should ask the Russian

      matter.  You might ask the American N.S.A. if they have

labours during the coming months, to prepare the way for a 
befitting and glorious Centenary celebration of our beloved

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved friends, 
     I was so pleased and encouraged to witness the recent evidences of 
 
+P162 
the determination of the English believers to arise, as never before, 
during this concluding year of the first &Baha'i century, and ensure the 
extension of the teaching activities of the Faith, the consolidation of its 
interests, and a better understanding and wider recognition of its aims, 
its principles, and accomplishments.  The efforts they must exert during 
these remaining months must be unprecedented in their range and 
character.  The blessings that will be vouchsafed to them, if they 
unitedly persevere and vigorously prosecute their urgent task, will 
alike be unprecedented.  The preparation for a befitting celebration of 
the forthcoming Centenary must likewise be carefully and energetically 
carried out.  May the Almighty sustain and guide them in their vast 
and meritorious endeavours.

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated July 15th, Aug. 12th, Oct. 3rd, Nov. 1st 
and 10th and Dec. 5th together with various enclosures have 
been received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer 
them on his behalf.  
     Regarding the article by Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper, the 
Guardian does not place such material in the archives, but it 
might possibly be either stored with past documents or have 
been returned to the "&Baha'i World" Committee.  He regrets his 
inability to forward it to you in time to be of any use in 
preparing the Centenary Pamphlet.  
     He would like you to assure Mr. St. Barbe Baker+ that the 
&Baha'is would be happy to avail themselves of his connections in 
Africa and his assistance and advice in the future teaching work 
there.  Tremendous tasks lie ahead of the believers during the 
opening years of the second &Baha'i century, and undoubtedly 
spreading the Faith in Africa will be one of them.  
     He considered the Diary gotten out by the Publishing Trust 
to be in excellent taste, and is very pleased it has proved a 
medium of spreading the news of the existence of our beloved 
Faith and its nature.  He appreciated receiving the copies 
forwarded to him.  He is also very pleased to hear that the 
publication of the Centenary Pamphlet is now assured.  
     He sees no objection to getting out a compilation of Tablets 
of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha (as per minute No. 906) 
providing the source is authentic and the translations faithful and 
presentable.  
     He was very pleased to see that new and better headquarters 
for the Assembly and meetings in London have been found, and 
trusts this foreshadows the development of a national administrative 
headquarters there in England in the not too distant 
future.  
 
+F1 The cabled reply was "First meeting thirteenth October, 1923."  
 
+P164 
     In spite of the burden the &Baha'is, in common with their 
countrymen, are bearing these days, they are showing marked 
progress in their activities, and he feels confident that the friends, 
so loyal and devoted to the beloved Faith, will arise unitedly, in 
so important a country as England--one of the first to receive 
the Divine Message in the West--and will ensure that the 
Centenary is befittingly celebrated in spite of the many 
difficulties to be overcome.  
     Assuring you one and all of his ardent prayers for the success 
of your work, for your strength and protection....  
     P.S.  Your letter of Jan. 18th has been received and the 
Guardian wishes to state that in connection with the royalties on 
"Paris Talks" that, as Mrs. Hall and her sister wish to turn them 
over to the Cause, the Assembly should accept and the money in 
future go to the National Fund there in England....  
     Any royalties on the works of the Master, as one of the 
Central Figures of our Faith, are naturally the property of the 
Cause and not of His heirs.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     I am delighted to hear of the steps that have been taken by your 
Assembly in preparation for the forthcoming celebration of the 
centenary of our beloved Faith, and I pray that success may crown 
your devoted efforts.  The English believers are in every field of &Baha'i 
activity and service demonstrating the quality of their faith and the 
keen sense of responsibility which animates them in their organised 
and concerted endeavours for the promotion of the vital interests of the 
Faith.  I feel proud of their record of service, and will pray with 
increasing fervour for their protection and success.

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated March 3rd and 25th, April 23rd, May 18th 
 
+F1 In response to cable from Convention announcing adoption of a six year 
+F1 plan and requesting the Guardian to set the goals.  
 
+P170 
and July 6th together with their enclosures have all been 
received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer 
them on his behalf.  
     He was most deeply gratified over the way the Centenary was 
conducted in London and feels that it has adequately demonstrated 
the vitality of the faith which animates the British &Baha'i 
community.  They may well look upon this as their major 
achievement since the visits to their shores of the beloved Master.  
He was also very pleased to hear of the celebrations successfully 
held by the Manchester and Torquay &Baha'is in their respective 
communities.  
     "The Centenary of a World Faith" he found most excellently 
gotten out and not only well written but calculated to arouse the 
interest of the reader and impress him with the true stature of 
our World Faith.  He has distributed copies among the friends 
and placed some in the library of the Mansion, at &Bahji.  He was 
also pleased with the programme of the London Meetings--so 
you can see that the patient efforts and sacrifices of the members 
of the N.S.A. and all those who contributed to the marked 
success of the Centenary celebrations in England, have met not 
only with his approval and admiration but brought happiness to 
his often heavily over-burdened heart!  
     Regarding your question concerning minute No. 1050; this 
is entirely a matter of conscience; if the individual feels for some 
reason justified in voting for himself, he is free to do so.  
Regarding your question of the proper time to celebrate or hold 
our meetings of commemoration, the time should be fixed by 
counting after sunset; the Master passed away one hour after 
midnight, which falls a certain number of hours after sunset; so 
His passing should be commemorated according to the sun and 
regardless of daylight saving time.  The same applies to the 
ascension of &Baha'u'llah who passed away about 8 hours after 
sunset.  
     The Guardian has already cabled you regarding your Six Year 
Teaching Plan, and he hopes that events in the future will be 
more favourable to carrying it out than they are at present.  He 
often thinks of and prays for the English friends during these 
days of ordeal they are again passing through and he feels 
confident &Baha'u'llah will strengthen their work and bless their 
efforts for this Holy Cause....  
 
+P171 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The Six Year Plan which the national elected representatives of the 
English believers have spontaneously launched is a further evidence of 
their unquenchable faith and noble and unyielding determination to 
prosecute energetically the teaching work in the British Isles and to 
exploit to the full the notable advantages derived from the successful 
celebrations of the &Baha'i Centenary in London.  Attention should be 
focussed in the course of the opening year of the second &Baha'i Century 
on the needs and requirements of this Plan.  The multiplication of 
&Baha'i centres and the dissemination of &Baha'i literature should be 
regarded as the chief objectives of the prosecutors of the Plan.  Every 
sacrifice should be made, every effort should be exerted and every 
avenue should be explored to ensure the success of the Plan.  The 
English believers stand identified with this Plan.  The immediate 
destinies of the entire community depend upon it.  I will pray for its 
success, will watch its progress and pledge every assistance within my 
power for its promotion.  May the Beloved bless all those who have 
embarked upon it and crown their enterprise with brilliant and total 
victory.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters, written on behalf of the National Spiritual 
Assembly, and dated Aug. 2nd, 21st and 31st (airgraph) and Oct. 
9th, Nov. 16th (airgraph) and Nov. 23rd (duplicate copy also 
received), Dec. 19th (duplicate copy also received) all of 1944, 
and Jan. 25th 1945 (duplicate copy also received) have arrived 
safely with any enclosures they contained, and the beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer them.  
     He fully realises the many handicaps the English &Baha'is are 
labouring under, and appreciates all the more deeply their 
perseverance and devotion shown in such activities as the 
National Centenary in London and local exhibitions and 
meetings held elsewhere, as well as the successful Summer 
School, the various printing undertakings and the renewed 
efforts to establish new centres and strengthen older ones.  In this 
connection he would like you to please convey to Miss Young+F1 
and all other pioneers the expression of his loving appreciation 
of this historic service they have arisen to render the Faith in 
England.  
     The tasks facing the believers everywhere are great, for they 
see only too clearly that the only permanent remedy for the 
many afflictions the world is suffering from, is a change of heart 
and a new pattern of not only thought but personal conduct.  The 
impetus that has been given by the Manifestation of God for this 
Age is the sole one that can regenerate humanity, and as we 
&Baha'is are the only ones yet aware of this new force in the 
world, our obligation towards our fellow men is tremendous 
and inescapable!  Therefore he hopes that many more of the 
friends there will arise to do pioneering work and help achieve 
the important goals set by the Six Year Plan.  When once a few 
bold, self-sacrificing individuals have arisen to serve, their 
example will no doubt encourage other timid would-be pioneers 
to follow in their footsteps.  The history of our Faith is full of 
records of the remarkable things achieved by really very simple, 
 
+F1 Miss Jessica Young+; Mrs. Kathleen Brown (later Lady Hornell)+; Miss 
+F1 Ursula Newman (later Mrs. &Samandari)+ were the first to arise to pioneer 
+F1 in the British Isles.  
 
+P173 
insignificant individuals, who became veritable beacons and 
towers of strength through having placed their trust in God, 
having arisen to proclaim His Message.  The stamina and 
fortitude shown by the people at large during all these hard and 
bitter years of war should surely find a nobler example in the 
deeds of the &Baha'is who are connected with the Divine Source!  
He urges your Assembly to do all in its power, through financial 
and moral assistance, to get more pioneers into the field.  
     Mr. Hofman has just written him about his meeting with the 
Paris believers, and he feels that as most of the friends there are 
elderly people and have suffered many privations, the British 
N.S.A. should keep in close touch with them and help and 
inspire them all it can....  
     Also concerning your question about the prayers and changing 
the pronouns:  This cannot be done, even in the long Obligatory 
Prayer or the healing prayers.  Either we must ignore this mere 
detail or say a prayer that applies to our sex or number....  
     You may be sure that you, and your fellow members of the 
N.S.A., are very often in his thoughts and prayers.  He deeply 
appreciates your steadfast and persevering labours and hopes that 
the believers of England will arise to fulfil their high duties and 
discharge the debts they owe their countrymen through the 
privilege of being the followers of &Baha'u'llah in these dark yet 
historic days....  
     P.S.  The following is a copy of the cable the Guardian sent 
you in answer to your request for his advice as to the Six Year 
Plan the British believers resolved to undertake:  

     "WELCOME SPONTANEOUS DECISION.  ADVISE FORMATION NINETEEN 
&BAHA'I SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLIES SPREAD OVER ENGLAND WALES 
SCOTLAND NORTHERN IRELAND AND EIRE.  PRAYING SIGNAL 
VICTORY."  
 
     He will, you may be sure, do everything in his power to assist 
the friends to achieve this objective.  

          [From the Guardian:]
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The Six Year Plan which the English believers have conceived and 
are now energetically prosecuting constitutes a landmark in the history 
of the Faith in the British Isles.  It is the first collective enterprise 
undertaken by them for the spread of the Faith and the consolidation 
 
+P174 
of its divinely appointed institutions.  The national elected representatives 
of the &Baha'i community in those islands must watch carefully 
every phase in its development, provide whatever is required for its 
systematic and steady extension, encourage the believers to disperse, to 
settle, to persevere, and to appeal more directly and effectively to the 
masses who are waiting for this Divine Message, and on whose 
ultimate response the triumph of the Cause of &Baha'u'llah must depend.  
Obstacles, however formidable, should be surmounted.  Setbacks, 
however discouraging at first, must not, under any circumstances, 
cause them to deviate from the path they are so devotedly and 
determinedly pursuing.  That glorious success may eventually crown 
their concerted and historic endeavours is my fervent and constant 
prayer at the Holy Shrines.  May the Beloved aid them to achieve their 
noble end.

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to forward you the 
enclosed copy of his message+F1 to the &Baha'is of East and West on 
the happy occasion of the termination of the European war.  
 
+F1 Cable 9 May 1945.  
 
+P177 
     He would appreciate your sharing it not only with all the 
British friends but with the Paris believers too.  
     Please inform him of the safe receipt of this message as soon as 
it reaches you.  
     We all send you our loving greetings and are greatly relieved 
to know your lives will now assume a more normal course after 
all these years of suffering....  
 
 
9 August 1945 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated March 8th and 12th, April 17th, May 10th 
and 18th and July 8th and June 9th have been received, as well 
as the various enclosures you mention in them, and the 
photographs, sent under the separate cover.  The beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.  
     He was very pleased to hear you are now in touch with the 
French believers and able to help them morally, and also with 
some physical assistance too!  It is only right that England, the 
first country whose &Baha'i community is in a position to reach 
out a helping hand to its sister communities in Europe, should do 
so, and should have this privilege and honour.  
     He realises the many difficulties that stand in the way of the 
British &Baha'is in regard to fulfilling the important Six Year 
Teaching Plan they have undertaken.  But he hopes that now the 
European war is over, and conditions are returning to a more 
normal way of life, that the friends, conscious of their very great 
spiritual responsibility, will arise and, in spite of everything, 
accomplish the work they have chosen for themselves and which 
is of such great spiritual importance to their countrymen.  
     The more we study the present condition of the world, the 
more deeply we become convinced that there just cannot be any 
way out of its problems except the way of God, as given by Him, 
through &Baha'u'llah.  The early Persian &Baha'is gave their lives 
for the Cause; the Western believers have been spared this 
necessity, but their comfort, to some extent, they must sacrifice 
if they are going to discharge their moral obligation to tortured 
humanity, and bring to it the message of the Father.  Once the 
friends start out to win the goals set in their Plan, they will find 
 
+P178 
the Divine confirmation sustaining them and hastening its 
consummation.  This is what happened in the American Seven 
Year Plan and the Indian Six Year Plan, and the same spiritual 
assistance will certainly be vouchsafed the English believers, once 
they arise with faith and confidence, to do their work.  
     In regard to the question you raise in your letter of June 9th 
about the "Paris Talks", the Guardian does not advise your 
putting the suggested footnote, as we cannot be absolutely sure, 
unless we see the Persian text, that what you propose is really 
what the Master means.  The present translation cannot be 
considered accurate in all its details, obviously, and as at the 
moment the Persian text is not available, he suggests you either 
put no footnote at all, or one stating that the meaning is obscure 
and future re-translation will clear up such passages.  
     You may be sure that his ardent prayers will be offered on 
behalf of all the British &Baha'is, that &Baha'u'llah may aid them to 
fulfil His work and may open the doors of servitude and guide 
them on their way.  He will also pray for you and your fellow 
N.S.A. members, for your strength, protection and guidance in 
fulfilling your many important tasks.  
     P.S.  Regarding Mr. ... financial affairs; there is naturally no 
objection to his receiving his own money, but he should have no 
communication with his family, and should arrange for your 
N.S.A. to receive his money and deliver it to him.  The Guardian 
is very pleased that he has taken the right, courageous, &Baha'i 
course of action in his life, and will certainly pray for his 
happiness and protection.  
     There is no ambiguity about the Master's attitude towards 
psychic forces; He very strongly warned the believers against 
using them.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     I grieve to learn of the slow progress of the Six Year Plan which the 
English believers have so nobly conceived, and which, I pray and hope, 
will be triumphantly consummated.  The Plan constitutes a direct and 
grave challenge to the English &Baha'i community in its entirety.  It 
should be regarded as the greatest collective enterprise ever launched by 
the followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in the British Isles.  It is thus 
far one of the most significant undertakings embarked upon by the 
members of &Baha'i National Assemblies during the opening years of 
 
+P179 
the second &Baha'i century.  To it, as already observed, the immediate 
destinies of the community of the English believers are linked, and on 
it must depend the future orientation and evolution of the institutions 
which the members of that community are labouring to erect for the 
diffusion of the principles and the establishment of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah in their country.  It must not, it cannot, fail.  The attention 
of the entire body of the believers must be continually focussed upon it.  
No sacrifice can be deemed too great for its successful prosecution.  All 
must arise harmoniously, co-operate and lend their share of assistance.  
May the spirit of &Baha'u'llah enable them to achieve signal success.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
18 December 1945 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to acknowledge the 
receipt of your two letters dated Aug. 11th and Nov. 9th and to 
answer them on his behalf.  Their enclosures were also 
received....  
     He was very pleased to hear that you have had eight new 
&Baha'is since Convention and hopes that this is only a foretaste of 
the conversion of souls in far greater numbers in the years lying 
ahead of us.  
     The Six Year Plan is of the utmost importance, and he urges 
your Assembly to continually keep reminding the friends of the 
necessity for sustaining their efforts through arising personally 
to serve and through giving generously that others may serve in 
their place.  
     In this connection he hopes you will use the services of Marion 
Holley, now Mrs. David Hofman+, to the full.  She is a gifted 
speaker and writer, and has had invaluable experience in America 
as a member of the National Teaching Committee, during the 
Seven Year Plan.  Both she and Mr. Hofman are wholly dedicated 
to the service of the Cause, and eager to do all in their power to 
help accomplish the goals of your Six Year Plan.  
     He was happy to hear that the Summer School was held 
successfully.  Now that the war is over, and conditions gradually 
returning to normal, he hopes that the British believers will 
exert their utmost in serving the Cause and spreading its message.  
 
+P180 
Although from time to time they will receive the help of outside 
&Baha'is, the major responsibility is theirs, and the lion's share of 
the work will naturally fall to them as both their privilege and 
their duty.  
     He assures you one and all that his ardent prayers sustain you 
in your labours for the Faith and he feels sure that with sufficient 
effort on the part of all, and the Power of God which inevitably 
sustains self-sacrificing service in His Path, the goals can be 
gloriously achieved....  
     P.S.  He was delighted to hear of the welfare of the German 
believers.  Reports of a similar nature had already reached him, 
but no figures had been given.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved co-workers, 
     I am anxiously waiting for the news of the progress of the Six Year 
Plan, upon which the future orientation of the collective activities of 
the English believers depends, and with which the immediate destinies 
of their Faith are interwoven.  No sacrifice is too great to ensure its 
success.  The utmost effort, vigilance, perseverance and self-sacrifice are 
required to carry it to a successful conclusion.  If the friends, individually 
and collectively, play their part and exert their utmost, the abundant 
blessings of &Baha'u'llah will be fully vouchsafed, and the strength of 
the Plan will mark a glorious chapter in the history of the Faith.  I 
appeal to the entire community to dedicate itself to this sacred and 
urgent task, the greatest collective enterprise ever undertaken by the 
followers of &Baha'u'llah in the British Isles.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letters dated Sep. 6th and Nov. 6th 1945 and Jan. 2nd, 
Feb. 8th and 19th 1946, have been received together with their 
enclosures, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to 
answer them on his behalf.  
     He has been delighted to see, through your letter and reports 
sent by other &Baha'is, that the Teaching Conference in 
Manchester was such a success, and he feels this marks a turning 
point in your Six Year Plan.  Now that goal towns have been 
chosen, the friends must concentrate all their forces and resources 
on establishing Assemblies in them as soon as possible.  He feels 
sure that once the signs of success become evident all the 
believers, tired and depressed after so many years of war and 
privation, will become vitalised with optimism and enthusiasm 
and drive forward unitedly towards the complete victory of 
their plans.  
     He was delighted to hear that Miss Townshend+ and Mr. 
Lee+ have arisen as pioneers, and he wishes you to please assure 
them of his special prayers for the success of their devoted 
labours.  
     He was also very happy to hear you have found a place to hold 
your Summer School; this is such an important &Baha'i activity 
 
+P182 
that even if the expenses are such as to necessitate its being 
subsidised by the National Fund it does not matter.  
     He advises you to send half of the Russian books in your 
possession to the &Baha'i Bureau in Geneva.  Mrs. Lynch can 
distribute them from there, as required, to other centres.  
     He feels it would be an excellent means of serving the Cause 
and enhancing the prestige of the British &Baha'is if you can send 
a delegate to the Spiritual World Congress to be held in Brussels.  
     We are sending ... the Haifa News Letter direct from here; 
thank you for sending his address.  The Guardian suggests if you 
have not already done so, that you send the address of the Dutch 
&Baha'i to Mrs. Lynch, so that travelling believers can be put in 
touch with him.  
     He is eagerly awaiting more good news of the progress of 
your Six Year Plan, and assures you all that he will ardently pray 
for its speedy and complete success in the Holy Shrines.  
     Your Assembly's labours are very deeply appreciated....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The enterprise launched by the English &Baha'i community in the 
opening years of the second &Baha'i Century is of tremendous 
significance, and will, if successful, mark not only the inception of a 
glorious chapter in the history of the Faith in the British Isles, but will 
constitute a landmark in the spiritual awakening of its people.  The 
forces which such a consummation will release none can estimate 
sufficiently at present.  The task is colossal, but the reinforcing power 
of &Baha'u'llah, who is watching over it and is ready to bless and 
sustain it if its prosecutors arise to play their part, is likewise 
immeasurable.  The recent Teaching Conference is but the initial stage 
in this mighty, this collective, and indeed historic undertaking.  The 
goal towns which have been selected should be regarded as the chief 
objectives requiring the immediate and concentrated attention of its 
zealous promoters.  Every consideration should be subordinated to the 
paramount need of establishing at any cost and by every means 
possible, vigorously functioning assemblies at these centres.  No effort 
should be wasted, all must arise to lend their assistance; no sacrifice is 
too great to ensure the completion of the first stage of this noble 
enterprise.  Unity, perseverance, self-sacrifice, will guarantee its success.  
Obstacles may arise, set-backs will no doubt occur, but the 
 
+P183 
unconquerable spirit animating the English believers must ultimately 
triumph.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

29 May 1946 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters (and those previously written by Mrs. Ferraby+ 
as secretary) dated March 19th and 21st; April 12th and 23rd; 
and May 2nd and 11th, as well as their enclosures, have all been 
received, and the Guardian has instructed me to answer them on 
his behalf.  
     Regarding the various points which have been raised in these 
letters.  
     As he already informed you by cable, he sees no objection to 
substituting some other town for Cardiff if that has proved too 
unpromising....  
     People who for years have ceased to either attend meetings or 
show the slightest interest in the Cause can be dropped from the 
voting list; but any who are unable to attend meetings, but still 
 
+F1 In answer to cabled request for guidance about tied vote at Convention.  
 
+P185 
consider themselves to be &Baha'is and are desirous of keeping up 
their contact with the Faith, should naturally be kept on the 
voting list.  
     He feels at the present stage of the Cause's development in 
England it is perhaps wiser not to make any hard and fast rules 
about the boundaries of towns for assembly purposes.  However, 
you should bear in mind that in the future some proper 
delineation will be necessary.  
     As to the question of the Publishing Trust about quoting 
excerpts from some of the Meditations; there is no objection to 
this at all.  
     He hopes you will be able to find some suitable quarters in 
London for your &Baha'i Centre; he considers that at the present 
time, with the heavy and essential teaching programme you 
have undertaken, it is out of the question to purchase headquarters.  
     The Guardian takes the keenest interest in your Six Year Plan, 
and he wishes me to point out to you certain things in this 
connection:  if the important goals of new Assemblies are to be 
achieved, he feels you will have to organise the work on a new 
basis.  England now stands, one might say, on the brink of a new 
phase of its &Baha'i life; the long years of war are over, the friends 
are not only awakened to a sense of their responsibilities, but 
have increased in numbers, in zeal, and in unity; there is a 
growing number of people who are anxious to do pioneer work.  
What is needed is a planned and consistent form of teaching and 
administrative support of the activities your Assembly is 
inaugurating.  
     He feels the time has come when the British &Baha'is' resources 
are sufficient to enable them to embark on their teaching 
campaign in a manner similar to that already followed by the 
American and Indian &Baha'is.  In other words pioneers who 
volunteer for work, if they are not able to support themselves, 
should be supported by the National Fund until they either find 
work or their task is completed.  
     Likewise travelling teachers should be assisted financially to 
carry out the "projects" assigned to them.  The friends should not 
for a moment confuse this type of support with the creation of 
a paid clergy.  Any &Baha'i can, at the discretion of the N.S.A., 
receive this necessary assistance and it is clearly understood it is 
temporary and only to carry out a specific plan.  &Baha'u'llah 
 
+P186 
Himself has not only enjoined on everyone the duty of teaching 
His Faith, but stated if you cannot go yourself, to send someone 
in your stead.  The National Assembly, through and with its 
Teaching Committee, should take immediate steps to get 
pioneers out into the goal towns and teachers circulating about, 
to not only support and inaugurate the new work, but to 
stimulate the existing Assemblies and groups, and help them to 
expand.  
     He hopes that your Assembly, unitedly and with complete 
dedication to the great work that lies ahead of you, will 
concentrate all your forces on the teaching work.  You may be 
sure he will pray for your success in the Holy Shrines, and that 
all the British &Baha'is may realise to the full their historic 
responsibilities and arise to discharge them....  
     P.S.  Your letter of May 29th has since been received and the 
extra photos of N.S.A. members will be forwarded to America.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The activities of the English &Baha'i community in pursuance of the 
Plan, which in its scope and potentialities is wholly unprecedented in 
the history of the Faith in the British Isles, are now approaching a 
critical stage, and will, if not relentlessly expanded and consolidated, 
fall far short of their ultimate objective.  They have now entered the 
third year of their Plan, and the work that still remains unaccomplished 
is considerable, but not beyond what their united and sustained 
endeavours can accomplish.  The utmost support, if the Plan is to yield 
its promise, should be continually and increasingly extended to every 
pioneer, both moral and financial, who will arise to contribute his or 
her share to its success.  All the institutions of the Faith so laboriously 
erected since the inception of the Formative Age, most of the financial 
resources of the community that have been accumulated, the 
deliberations of the elected representatives of the entire body of the 
believers, both local and national, should henceforth be dedicated to the 
vital requirements and noble aims of an enterprise which, if successful, 
will pave the way, and provide the necessary agencies, for the 
proclamation of the Faith to the masses throughout the British Isles.  
     The Faith is too circumscribed at present, its resources too limited, 
its range too restricted, and the number of its active supporters too few, 
to allow a systematic and nation-wide campaign designed to awaken 
the masses, to be effectively inaugurated.  The present Plan is but a 
 
+P187 
stepping stone that must lead eventually the English believers to 
execute so tremendous and meritorious an undertaking.  The duties 
and responsibilities now facing them must, however, be fully 
discharged.  No time or effort should be wasted.  All, young and old, 
must be aroused to a new consciousness of their collective responsibilities.  
A greater measure of self-sacrifice, a greater audacity, a greater reliance 
on the sustaining grace of &Baha'u'llah, are required to lend the 
necessary impetus to the progressive unfoldment and ultimate fruition 
of this dynamic process which the followers of &Baha'u'llah, labouring 
in the heart of a world encircling empire, have set in motion.  May 
signal success crown their historic labours.

7 June 1946 
 
National Youth Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letter dated May 16th and written on behalf of the 
National Youth Committee, was received, and the beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     He is very happy to see that the &Baha'i Youth of the British 
Isles are now organised and working with enthusiasm for the 
spread of the Faith there.  He feels that they have a great and 
important &role to play during the next few years in fulfilling the 
objectives of the Six Year Plan.  
     Young people, being, for the most part, freer than the older 
believers, are in a position to arise as pioneers and move to new 
towns as settlers.  A great number of the pioneers in America, 
who left their native cities, and often their native land, in order 
to fulfil the Seven Year Plan, were young people--some of them 
so young that the Spiritual Assemblies they helped to establish 
they were themselves not yet old enough to be elected to!  
     The Guardian has enjoyed very much meeting Capt. Philip 
Hainsworth+, who had the unique privilege of being in Haifa 
for over a month, and he feels sure that upon his return to 
England he will lend great impetus to both the Youth and 
teaching work.  
 
+P188 
     He heartily approves of your "Youth Bulletin" project and 
urges you to place special emphasis on articles that are of 
pertinent interest to young people, such as those dealing with the 
economic, social and moral aspects of society.  
     Assuring you, and all the members of your Committee, of his 
loving prayers for the success of your labours....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your meritorious endeavours, guide every 
step you take in the path of service, aid you to extend the range of your 
activities, and enable you to promote, by every means in your power, 
and in a most effective manner, the vital interests of a Plan with which 
the immediate destinies of the members of the English &Baha'i 
Community, both young and old, are so inextricably interwoven.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to send you the 
following copy of a cable he sent the N.S.A. on the 7th of 
this month:  "DELIGHTED LATEST REPORT TEACHING ACTIVITIES.

     In the first draft of this cable sent you a word was left out, 
namely "twice" before the "19" in reference to the first increase 
of the number of convention delegates.  This was corrected the 
same day by cable.  
     The Guardian has so far received no acknowledgment of the

receipt of this long cable and he is anxious to know if it reached 
you safely?  Also the five hundred pounds which was forwarded 
by cable, through Barclays Bank, to your name?  
     Assuring you of his loving prayers on your behalf....  
     P.S.  He was very happy to hear that the N.S.A. is now united, 
and that sources of misunderstanding and uneasiness have been 
entirely cleared up.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters dated June 1st and 26th and July 20th and 25th, 
 
+P190 
together with their enclosures, have been received, and our 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     Regarding the various points you raised.  
     Unless the Russian "New Era" is hopelessly bad, the Guardian 
advises it nevertheless be made use of, as it will be some time 
before the funds of the Cause can be used for a new edition.  If the 
mistakes are mostly in the nature of mistranslations of certain 
important terms it might be possible for you, in conjunction 
with Mrs. Lynch, to have printed or mimeographed a list of 
errata, and stick it in the book, in this way Russian-speaking 
people will not be denied some literature on the Faith, however 
inadequate.  
     The attitude of the friends towards orientals should be one of 
great caution, according to the Master's own often-repeated and 
explicit instructions and warnings.  Any believer in good 
standing would not leave his home community without a letter 
of credential, and certainly no Persians, claiming to be &Baha'is, 
but lacking credentials, should be accepted until the Persian 
N.S.A. has clarified their status.  They can, naturally, attend 
public meetings, but should not be permitted to come to the 19- 
Day Feasts; the friends may associate with them, but should be 
very cautious, bearing in mind that many orientals, who scorned 
or were even actively against the Cause while living in the East, 
now find it convenient to pose as believers or friends of the Faith 
in a Western community where they are strangers.  
     As regards your question about &Baha'i procedure; the present 
statement can certainly be amplified to include the United 
Nations Organisation.  
     He feels that your Assembly should constantly, through its 
communications to the friends and its committees, and in every 
way possible, stir the British &Baha'i community to a sense of the 
great urgency of their pioneer activities; and the need for more 
pioneers.  They now have a golden opportunity to arise and fulfil 
their own cherished plans before it is too late.  In the future we 
may well look back upon these present days and see that in them 
lay our greatest chance to build for the future and to call people 
to the Faith while they were still deeply impressed with the 
tragedy and futility of war; and before they become too engulfed 
in post war problems, or too bitterly disillusioned by the trend 
of world affairs to even seek a solution.  More believers must 
 
+P191 
arise, and, putting their trust in &Baha'u'llah, do their duty to the 
Faith they believe in and love so dearly.  The youth in particular 
should be encouraged to enter this field of service, for the spread 
of the Cause is their only hope for a stable world in which to live 
and establish families of their own.  
     His loving prayers are with you all in your many services to 
the Cause of God, and he is greatly encouraged by the way the 
work is going forward in England....+F1  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The evidences of intensified activity and of notable progress on the 
part of the English believers in recent months have rejoiced my heart 
and deepened my feelings of admiration and gratitude for the manner 
in which they are discharging, individually and collectively, their high 
responsibilities.  I long to hear of the steady progress of their Plan, and 
will continue to pray for the removal of every obstacle in their path.  
However considerable their recent achievements, they are still in the 
initial stage of their great unfolding mission, and are not even capable 
as yet of visualising the possibilities or of estimating the consequences 
of their present-day labours.  The consummation of their present task 
will mark the opening of a new era in the development of their 
community and will signalise the inauguration of a great epoch in the 
history of the Faith in their land--an epoch that must witness the 
universal recognition of their Cause and the proclamation of its truths, 
its claims and tenets, to the masses of their countrymen throughout the 
British Isles.  The Plan they are now prosecuting will provide the 
machinery and establish the basic structure that will enable them to 
arouse the people, among all sections of the population, and aid them, 
systematically and gradually, to recognise &Baha'u'llah, and support the 
nascent institutions of this World Order.  Now it is their duty to lay 
an unassailable foundation for the great work that is to be undertaken 
in the future.  There is no time to lose.  Theirs is a priceless opportunity 
and a great privilege.  They must neither vacillate nor falter.  They

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letter of September 19th was received, and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf, and to 
congratulate you and the other members of your committee on 
the excellent first issue of your &Baha'i Youth Bulletin.  
     This is an important new undertaking, and must be established 
as a firm innovation on the part of the British &Baha'i community.  
He hopes it will gradually become the means of interesting and 
attracting many new souls to the Faith.  
     In fact the Youth work everywhere in the &Baha'i World is 
dear to his heart, and he attaches great importance to it.  The 
young people, who will inevitably grow up to shoulder all the 
work of the Cause, are really its hope, and should be one of the 
most active factors in its propagation.  Through their courageous 
 
+F1 Approving Teaching Conference to be dedicated to the 25th Anniversary 
+F1 of the Guardianship.  
 
+P193 
adherence to the high moral and ethical standards set out by 
&Baha'u'llah, and through gaining a mastery of His many, 
diversified, and profound teachings, they can shape, to a great 
extent, the development and aid in the rapid expansion of their 
beloved Faith in the various countries in which they labour.  
They should be made to realise their responsibility is heavy and 
their privilege very precious.  
     He wishes to assure you and all the other members of the 
National Youth Committee, of his most loving prayers for your 
progress, and for the success of the work you have so 
enthusiastically and devotedly undertaken....  

          [From the Guardian:]  
     May the Beloved bless abundantly the work which your Committee 
has so nobly initiated, remove all obstacles from your path, aid you to 
realise every hope you cherish, and carry out every plan you conceive, 
for the furtherance of the interests of our beloved Faith and of its God-given 
institutions.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your communications dated Sept. 12, Oct. 4th and 17th, 
Nov. 19th, 18th and 21st and Dec. 29th 1946 have all been 
received together with their enclosures and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf....  
     He was very happy to see the marked success of your Summer 
School this past year and also to receive very encouraging reports 
of the Manchester Teaching Conference; a great change has 
come over the work in England during the past year and one 
which must certainly rejoice the hearts of the older &Baha'is in 
particular as they compare the present state of the Cause with the 
decades that passed when it had two or three spiritual Assemblies 
and seemed to be practically standing still!  It seems, indeed, as if 
an important corner had been turned and that the Faith in the 
 
+P195 
British Isles is at last showing its true stature and casting a 
portentous shadow of future events before it!  
     He is particularly happy to see the way the &Baha'i young 
people are arising and serving in the pioneer field with such 
courage, determination and success.  
     Regarding the question you asked him about the sentence 
from the "Aqdas" for the marriage certificate:  he feels that the 
following is a suitable translation of this passage:  "Enter into 
wedlock, O people, that ye may bring forth one who will make 
mention of me."  
     The very good news of Nottingham and Birmingham 
achieving Assembly status was most welcome and he hopes the 
friends will redouble their efforts in connection with the 
remaining goal towns.  Likewise the establishment of pioneers in 
both Eire and Scotland is of historic importance and they should 
receive every assistance from the National Teaching Committee 
and from your Assembly.  
     Now that the British believers see tangible results of their 
labours and perseverance taking shape, they should feel 
encouraged to make new sacrifices; a little effort on our part is 
so richly blessed by &Baha'u'llah--we can only wonder what the 
rewards would be for a great, concerted, truly inspired effort by 
all members of the community.  
     He assures you all of his most loving prayers for your guidance 
and the success of your historic enterprises....  
     P.S.  Shoghi Effendi would like your Assembly to make every 
effort to help Dr. Lotfullah Hakim+ to come to England from 
Persia; he wishes to continue his study of massage etc. and he 
could be of great help in the teaching work as he is a devoted and 
fine &Baha'i.  Shoghi Effendi suggested he might investigate the 
possibility of carrying out his studies in Edinburgh or some 
other goal town and thus help with the Six Year Plan at the same 
time.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The present crucial year, now drawing to a close, may well be 
regarded as one of the most memorable in the annals of British &Baha'i 
history.  The magnificent, spontaneous and collective response of almost 
the entire community of the English believers to the imperative call of 
teaching; the support lent by individuals, groups and Assemblies to the 
 
+P196 
Plan set in motion by its national elected representatives; the success 
attending the Teaching Conference; the multiplication of &Baha'i 
centres in England; the initial steps taken to establish the structure of 
the Administrative Order of the Faith, in Ireland, Scotland and 
Wales--all these have combined to raise the stature of the community, 
and to prepare it for the still greater tasks that must be faced by its 
members after the successful prosecution of the present Plan.  
     The &Baha'is of the British Isles are now, slowly, laboriously and in 
strict accordance with the principles of a steadily expanding, divinely 
appointed Administrative Order, building up the essential and primary 
institutions which are destined to act as the chief and most powerful 
instruments for the proclamation of the Faith to the masses of their 
countrymen, at a subsequent stage in the development of the Faith in 
their land.  As these institutions expand and are consolidated, the 
community will find itself equipped, not only to carry the Message of 
the New Day to the multitudes throughout the length and breadth of 
its homeland, but prepared and fortified to initiate teaching campaigns 
beyond the shores of its native land, and in distant territories and 
various parts of the Empire of which that land is the heart and centre.  
     Theirs is the duty, during these coming years, to lay patiently, 
assiduously and unitedly the foundation on which the structure of their 
future international services to their beloved Faith can be firmly and 
unassailably established.  Upon the success of the Plan they are now so 
diligently and devotedly prosecuting, must depend the scope and 
effectiveness of their two-fold task of proclaiming the verities of their 
Faith to their fellow countrymen at home, and of implanting its 
banner abroad amidst the peoples and races of a far-flung Empire.  
     That they may carry out, in a befitting manner and by the appointed 
time, the preliminary steps so essential for the fulfilment of their high 
destiny is my dearest wish and constant prayer.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letters dated August 10th (from the secretary) and 
December 19th and March 18th (from the Business Manager of 
the Editorial Committee) were received, and as our beloved 
Guardian is greatly overburdened by his steadily expanding 
correspondence, he has instructed me to answer these communications 
all in one.  
     He was very pleased to receive copies of "Youth Bulletin," 
which he thinks is starting out in the right direction; he would 
like to receive this publication regularly.  
     The work you are doing is very important, and the British 
&Baha'i Youth should feel very encouraged to see the way some 
of their members have arisen and gone forth to pioneer.  He 
hopes others will follow this example in order to ensure the 
success of the Six Year Plan.  
     You may be sure his loving prayers are offered for you all in 
the Holy Shrines....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain, bless and guide you in your 
notable, meritorious, and deeply appreciated activities, aid you to

8 May 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters dated Jan. 19th and 23rd; Feb. 16th, 27th and 
28th; March 8th and 25th; and April 4th, 19th, 20th, 22nd and 
23rd, 1947, have all been received, together with their enclosures 
and the material sent under separate cover, and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
 
+P199 
     Regarding the various questions you have raised.  
     He has already informed the American N.S.A. that he feels 
Mr. Townshend's services to the Faith can best be rendered by 
his writing about it, as he obviously has an outstanding ability in 
this direction, combined with knowledge and zeal, and can 
render a very valuable service this way; he also feels that Mr. 
Townshend, now that his church association seems about to be 
broken, could be used as part of the pioneer force in Eire.  It is his 
own land, he knows his own people, and the need for workers 
there is very particularly great this year....  
     If Mr. Townshend has not as yet been registered as a voting 
believer he certainly should be immediately.  Everyone knows 
he has been a most devoted &Baha'i for many years and his 
contributions should certainly be considered those of a voting 
&Baha'i.  
     He would appreciate receiving, for the files here in Haifa, a 
copy of the revised Articles of Association.  
     Regarding the prayer translated by Dr. &Khan and his daughter:  
although he has not taken time to compare it with the original, 
he assumes it is a faithful translation.  Unfortunately it is not a 
style which in our language can convey the richness and power 
of the original, and he would not recommend that this version 
of it be printed.  There is no objection, however, to its circulation 
among the friends if they want it.  
     As to certain of your voting members who have long been 
inactive, and whose conduct you disapprove of, he suggests you 
make an effort to find out if they still believe in the Faith, and if 
they do, and wish to be members of it, then they should be 
helped to mend their ways.  If this patient and loving method 
does not prove successful and they refuse to identify themselves 
with the Faith, they should be removed from the voting list.  
     Miss ... should be advised, for the sake of better serving the 
Cause she loves so dearly, to take care of her health; also she 
should be made to realise that a pessimistic and critical approach 
(although perhaps fully justified by the situation) produces no 
results.  We, having the power of the Faith to draw on, must 
always be constructive in our efforts, as this will produce results 
and attract Divine blessings upon them.  
     Concerning the membership of ... in the synagogue:  as this 
concerns his &non-Baha'i Jewish wife and means a great deal to 
 
+P200 
her--even involving the place of her burial--the Guardian does 
not feel it is right to request him to take a step which would 
deprive her of her own religious rights.  On the other hand, he 
sees no reason why ... should not write a letter to the appropriate 
authority in this synagogue, explaining that he is a practising 
&Baha'i but is keeping his synagogue membership for the benefit 
of his wife and children.  Some similar action should be taken by 
..., or he should give up his synagogue membership.  
     He realises the difficult position of the London community, 
but the goals of the Plan, and its success, justify any temporary 
weakening of the work in the capital, which in the end will be 
greatly strengthened by the national spread of the Faith.  He 
certainly will specially pray for this work in London.  
     The achievement of all goals during this crucial year has been 
very great, and brought him a conviction that the Cause in the 
British Isles is now operating on an entirely new footing, and 
that the community of believers there has thrown off once and 
for all time a certain lethargy which seemed to have retarded its 
progress in the past.  Although so much still remains to be 
accomplished, the combination of the new zest for work and the 
determination of the friends to succeed, and the unfailing 
assistance of &Baha'u'llah, promised to all who arise and put their 
faith in Him, will surely mow down all obstacles and carry the 
British believers through to victory.  
     He feels that the way your assembly is working, with its many 
and active committees, and the plans you have outlined in your 
report, are excellent.  Any suggestions he has to make, as the 
work unfolds, he will communicate to you.  
     The Summer School, he feels, is of great importance, and he 
hopes gradually believers from the continent will visit it and be 
helped and inspired by their contact with the now active and 
flourishing British &Baha'i community!  
     You may be sure in the prayers he offers in the Holy Shrines 
you and your assembly's work are often remembered....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The success that has crowned the strenuous efforts exerted by the 
entire British &Baha'i community in the course of this crucial year, has 
raised immensely its prestige in the estimation of its sister communities 
in East and West, and has demonstrated in a very striking manner, 
the vitality, resourcefulness and determination of its members, and 
 
+P201 
merits the praise and blessings of the concourse on high, and 
particularly of our beloved Master, who in the course of two successive 
visits showered His loving kindness on the English believers, and 
chose the capital city of their country as the scene of His first public 
appearance before a western audience.  This remarkable exploit, 
unparelleled since the inception of the administrative order in that 
land, and unsurpassed by any achievement associated with the 
followers of &Baha'u'llah in the British Isles since the introduction of 
His Faith into their country, augurs well for the successful termination 
of the Initial Phase of the Plan, and fills me with hope that total 
victory will ultimately be achieved, at the appointed time, by the 
prosecutors of this bold, this historic and far-reaching enterprise.  
     The Plan itself when consummated will signalise the opening of a 
new epoch in British &Baha'i history, an epoch which must witness, 
simultaneously with the vigorous initiation of subsequent Plans 
designed to broaden the basis, and multiply the institutions, of a 
steadily evolving administrative order, the inauguration of systematic 
undertakings, jointly launched by the English, the Scottish, the Irish 
and Welsh believers, and aiming, on the one hand, at the proclamation 
of the Divine Message to the masses of their respective countrymen, 
and, on the other, at the establishment of the structural basis of a 
divinely appointed Administrative Order throughout the far-flung 
dependencies of the British Crown.  
     For the present, however, and as an essential preliminary to the vast 
and challenging tasks that await them beyond the shores of their 
homeland, the eyes of the prosecutors of the present Plan must be 
focused on the vital and urgent requirements in England, and 
particularly Scotland, Wales and Ireland, wherein the nuclei that 
have been recently formed, should, ere the expiry of the present year, 
be converted into full-fledged assemblies.  The erection of the 
administrative institutions of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in these virgin 
territories will no doubt befittingly mark the termination of the initial 
phase of the Plan, and proclaim to the entire &Baha'i world the 
resolution, as well as the ability, of its valiant promoters to create 
the indispensable agencies required for an intensive propagation of the 
Faith at home, and the planting of its banner overseas.  
     Theirs is an unspeakably thrilling task, an awe-inspiring obligation, 
a priceless opportunity.  Their recent victories inspire a confident hope 
that a no less outstanding success will mark their future endeavours.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Your letter, with enclosures, to our Beloved Guardian, on 
behalf of the National Youth Committee, and dated February 
26th, was received and he has instructed me to answer it on his 
behalf.  He did not reply sooner because he is so very busy and 
overworked, and feels sure you understand the reason for the 
delay.  
     The services which the &Baha'i young people are rendering the 
Cause, not only in England but in Scotland and in Eire, please 
him greatly, as the Youth are the ones who perforce, in the near 
 
+P203 
future, will find themselves carrying on the administrative and 
teaching work of the Faith, and the sooner they prepare 
themselves for this heavy responsibility through actual experience 
in the pioneer field, the better.  
     He is delighted to see the steady progress of your activities and 
the way your Bulletin is progressing, and he assures you all of his 
loving prayers for the success of all your undertakings....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless continually your meritorious efforts, guide and 
sustain you in your activities, and aid you to fulfil your heart's desire 
in the service of His glorious Faith.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated August 21st, as 
well as the note of your Secretary, Miss Howes, dated August 
29th, have been received, together with the copy of your Youth 
Letter, and I have been instructed to answer you on his behalf.  
     He is very happy to hear of the formation of the new Youth 
Groups you mention, as this will not only greatly stimulate the 
&Baha'i Youth and enable them to attract new young people to 
the Faith, but will also do the general work of the Cause in these 
cities a great deal of good.  He urges your Committee to make 
every effort to establish youth groups wherever there are 
Spiritual Assemblies, and circumstances permit.  He would like 
to receive five copies of your Youth Letter if this is convenient.  
     Your services are very deeply valued, and he assures you all of 
his loving prayers for the success and expansion of your 
activities....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The activities initiated and diligently pursued by the members of 
your committee deserve the highest praise.  The devotion, the 
perseverance, the loyalty, the assiduous care with which you are 
striving to promote the interests of the &Baha'i Youth throughout the 
British Isles rejoice my heart, and will no doubt act as a magnet that 
will attract the blessings of the Almighty.  Persevere in your historic 
labours, and rest assured that the Beloved is well pleased with your 
splendid accomplishments.  I will continue to pray from the depths of 
my heart for the extension of your valued activities.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

     He is very pleased to see the work your Committee is 
undertaking and feel that it is of the greatest importance.  The 
unity, love, harmony and proper understanding of the administration 
of the Cause which exists in a community are the measure 
of its progress, and on them depend directly the expansion of the

     He wishes you every success, and assures you of his prayers in

     He was very pleased to see the enthusiasm and devotion with 
which you have entered into this important branch of &Baha'i 
activity, and he hopes your labours will be richly rewarded with 
success.  
     He would suggest that wherever classes for &Baha'i children are

so that their minds may receive the broad, basic and tolerant 
doctrines of our glorious Faith.  
     He assures you of his loving prayers for the success of your

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated May 18th and 
27th; June 4th, 9th and 16th; July 5th, 8th (two of this date), 
12th and 14th; August 9th and September 15th, 20th and 29th; 
and October 6th and 13th, have all been received, as well as their 
enclosures, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf....  
     He received a letter direct from the World Congress of Faiths, 
and wrote them offering full &Baha'i co-operation, and informing 
 
+P207 
them he was ready to appoint a &Baha'i representative to attend 
any conference they may hold.  
     The discovery of the Master's letter to Andrew Carnegie is 
very interesting, in spite of the very poor translation of this 
Tablet, and he will be very pleased to receive a photostat of the 
original, or at least a faithful copy of the text in Persian.  
     He would be pleased to continue receiving the reports of the 
Assembly Development Committee.  
     Regarding the question you asked him:  he feels that in the case 
of a believer who will be 21 years old on April 22nd, there is no 
objection, at this time, when the work of the Cause is so urgent 
and the workers so few, in permitting him to vote on April 21st.  
     The conduct of ... is an excellent example of why he, (and 
&Abdu'l-Baha before him), feels it so necessary to be very strict 
about the admission of Orientals into the communities of the 
Western world.  The British people, being shrewd by nature and 
having had considerable experience with Orientals and peoples 
of all races, are far less vulnerable to the insidious influence of the 
insincere than are the more naive and less experienced Americans.  
People such as this young man, &Baha'i in name whenever it suits 
their convenience to be so, caring really nothing about the Faith 
at heart, and ready to abandon it at a moment's notice if the 
pleasures to be gained outweigh the humiliation of ostracism, are 
a real menace to the Cause, especially to the faith of young and 
untried believers.  It is to protect the Cause against such 
individuals that the Guardian is at present so strict about not 
permitting Persians to visit America at this time.  
     In regard to your question about qualifications of delegates 
and assembly members:  the qualifications which he outlined are 
really applicable to anyone we elect to a &Baha'i office, whatever 
its nature.  But those are only an indication, they do not mean 
people who don't fulfil them cannot be elected to office.  We 
must aim as high as we can.  He does not feel the friends should 
attach so much importance to limitations--such as people 
perhaps not being able to attend assembly or convention 
meetings, because if they do, then the fundamental concept of 
everyone being willing to do &Baha'i service on administrative 
bodies will be weakened, and the friends may be tempted to vote 
for those who, because of independent means or circumstances 
in their lives, are freer to come and go but less qualified to serve.  
 
+P208 
     Regarding "&Abdu'l-Baha in London".  Nothing can be 
considered scripture for which we do not have an original text.  
A verbatim record in Persian of His talks would of course be 
more reliable than one in English because He was not always 
accurately interpreted.  However such a book is of value, and 
certainly has its place in our literature.  
     He assures you all of the deep appreciation of your valiant 
labours and his loving prayers on your behalf....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The gigantic task, now being so energetically and successfully 
carried out by the consecrated and firmly knit British &Baha'i 
community, constitutes a glorious landmark in recent &Baha'i history, 
and will, when viewed in proper perspective, deserve to be regarded as 
one of the most outstanding enterprises launched by the followers of 
&Baha'u'llah in the opening years of the second &Baha'i century.  Alike 
in its magnitude and significance, this momentous undertaking is 
unprecedented in the annals of the Faith in the British Isles, and 
deserves to rank as one of the most compelling evidences of the creative 
power of its Author, marking the rise and establishment of His 
institutions on the European continent.  It is yet too early to assess the 
potentialities of this present Plan and those destined to follow it, or 
estimate their future benefits.  The blessings they will confer, as the 
forces latent within them are progressively revealed, on the people 
dwelling within those Islands, and subsequently, as their sphere is 
enlarged and their implications are fully disclosed, on the diversified 
peoples and races inhabiting the widely scattered dependencies of a far-flung 
empire, in both the East and the West, are unimaginably 
glorious.  
     A staggering responsibility rests on the shoulders of those who have 
been called upon to assist in the operation of the initial stages of this 
heroic colossal enterprise, and to participate in the privilege of directing 
its course, and nursing its infant strength.  Setbacks and reverses are 
inevitable as this mighty Plan progresses and expands.  Critical stages 
in its unfoldment must be encountered with unswerving resolution 
and confident hope.  Whatever hardships and sacrifices its future 
prosecution may involve must be borne with courage, pride and 
thankfulness.  To insure its speedy advancement every issue must be 
subordinated to its vital requirements, and every individual effort 
co-ordinated with the agencies designed for its execution.  
 
+P209 
     Its present and pressing needs in the virgin territories of Eire, 
Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland must be met with concentrated 
attention, continuous, systematic effort and the utmost self-sacrifice.  
The goals to be achieved in the capitals and chief cities of these newly 
opened territories must be relentlessly pursued, no matter how hard 
and stony the path that must be trodden.  The prizes already won in 
other towns in those islands must at all costs be preserved and 
subsequently further enriched by fresh spiritual conquests in 
neighbouring counties and farther afield.  Indeed the steps preliminary 
to the formation of a &Baha'i administrative centre in every county 
throughout the British Isles, must sooner or later be taken, as an 
essential prelude to the effective proclamation of the Faith to the 
masses.  That the English &Baha'is, aided and reinforced gradually by 
fresh recruits from among their Irish, Welsh and Scottish countrymen, 
may hasten the advent of such a glorious day in British &Baha'i history 
is the dearest wish of my heart and the object of my constant 
supplication at the Threshold of &Baha'u'llah.

the Master to Andrew Carnegie, as this is yet another authentic 
and interesting &Baha'i document.  
     He was, likewise, very pleased to receive the statement of Sir 
A. Ramaswami Mudaliar testifying to his appreciation of the 
Faith, and he will use it in the appropriate section of "&Baha'i 
World" in the forthcoming edition.  
     The instruction he gave to the effect that committees should 
elect their own officers, he feels, is universal in scope and should, 
therefore, apply to Great Britain as well....  
     Regarding the matter of the budget of the N.S.A. he feels that 
both wisdom and courage is required in this matter.  You should 
not fix a budget which is too heavy for the community to meet, 
even with sacrifice.  Both the pressing needs of the Cause and 
your Plan, as well as the foreseeable possibilities of your income 
should guide you.  
     He has no objection to extracts from his letters to ... being 
published.  He feels that in the future it is not necessary to ask his 
permission to publish such extracts.  As long as the person who 
has received a letter, such as he would wish to share with others, 
from the Guardian, has no objection to its publication, he has no 
objection either.  Anything confidential he always specifies as 
being such.  
     He feels that the question of Mrs. Hofman giving up the 
secretaryship of the National Teaching Committee, and who is 
to be chairman of it, etc. is something to be decided there by 
those responsible for the work.  
     In one of your letters you mentioned some ... who have 
 
+P213 
visited the London Centre and their attitude:  great patience 
must be used in dealing with the child-like members of some of 
these primitive races.  They are innocent in heart and have 
certainly had a very bad example, in many Christians, of a 
purely mercenary approach to religion, but if their hearts and 
minds once become illumined with the Faith they could make 
very fine believers.  
     Regarding the matter of believers who have been deprived of 
their voting rights:  just as no one should ever be deprived of his 
voting right lightly, it should likewise be realised that to be 
deprived of it is a grave matter, and involves heavy penalties 
spiritually.  People who have been so deprived should not be 
permitted to attend any meetings involving the administration 
of the Cause, such as an election or a 19 Day Feast.  They can 
attend the 9 Holy Days, however; they should not be married 
by &Baha'i law, no money should be accepted from them, they 
should not be given credentials (which imply a member of the 
community in good standing) nor should they be used officially 
as teachers or speakers.  
     He has no objection to your getting out a book on &Baha'i 
Procedure similar to the synopsis you enclosed for his 
information.  He wishes you, however, to stick to essentials and, 
as far as possible, avoid--not only in the book but in your 
Assembly's decisions--binding the friends by a lot of procedure 
on minor matters which he always urges should be, as much as 
possible, dealt with according to each case that comes up.  He 
wishes to keep the administration of the Cause as flexible as 
possible and not impede the work by a codified set of rules.  
     As to the attitude of the &Baha'is in the British Isles towards the 
World Government Movement:  he thinks that as this Movement, 
so far, seems to be working for what we believe in, and 
not for anything we do not subscribe to, the &Baha'is should by all 
means support it, vote for the representatives to be sent to its 
constituent Assembly in 1950, and stand for election if they wish 
to.  However, he feels your Assembly should keep a careful 
watch on this Movement, and if it becomes in any way 
imperialistic, anti-Russian, or in any other field starts sponsoring 
attitudes partizan or political in nature, the believers should be 
advised to withdraw their support and help.  He does not think 
your Assembly should take any initiative in this Movement 
 
+P214 
outside of its jurisdiction, such as in the Middle East, through 
asking the friends to send in &non-Baha'i names, etc.  
     He does not advise you to try and create more than one 
Assembly, i.e. the present one, in the London area.  
     The work being accomplished in the British Isles is not only 
a source of pride to him, but is increasingly being recognised and 
admired by the &Baha'i communities throughout the World, and 
is greatly encouraging them in their own struggles.  For people 
are prone to thinking that the American &Baha'is accomplish so 
much solely because of the great advantages they enjoy in their 
very fortunate country, whereas now the friends, knowing full 
well how much England suffered during the war, and is still 
suffering, are forced to acknowledge that it is spirit, determination, 
faith and devotion which bring victories into being, one 
after another, in Britain, and not luxury and leisure.  Your 
achievements are heartening the friends in many places where 
their numbers are few, and the obstacles to be overcome great!  
In fact the American &Baha'is who have visited England feel there 
is much to be copied at home in your spirit and methods.  
     He, therefore, urges you all to persevere courageously, 
knowing what you are accomplishing is infinitely precious and 
great.  You are witnessing with your own eyes the fruition of 
your plans, the nearing of the moment when your hopes will be 
fully realised.  
     He assures you all of his very loving prayers on your behalf, 
and for the speedy progress of your work.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The successful conclusion of the Initial Phase of the first collective 
enterprise launched by the followers of &Baha'u'llah in the British Isles 
during the first year of the second &Baha'i century constitutes a milestone 
of the utmost significance on the road leading the British &Baha'i 
community to the glorious destiny ordained for them by Divine 
Providence.  The efforts exerted, the magnitude of the success which has 
been achieved, the spirit of consecration that has been demonstrated, 
the solidarity, determination and perseverance evinced by individuals, 
groups and assemblies during the opening years of this century are 
indeed unprecedented in British &Baha'i history, and may be regarded 
next to &Abdu'l-Baha's twice repeated visit to the British Isles, as the 
most potent period in the annals of the British &Baha'i community.  
 
+P215 
     The establishment of the structural basis of the Administrative 
Order of the Faith in Scotland, Wales and Eire--an accomplishment 
of tremendous spiritual significance in itself--has greatly enhanced 
the momentous character of this period, and will lend a mighty impetus 
to the evolution of the Faith in the days to come.  
     The Final Phase of the Plan must now be carried forward with still 
greater energy, with still nobler self-sacrifice, with a clearer vision of 
the historic import of the work which is to be accomplished, with a 
mightier determination to bring it to a successful conclusion.  The 
resources at the disposal of the community must, as a result of its 
expansion, be continually augmented and carefully extended.  The 
prizes so painstakingly won must, at all costs, be safeguarded and 
consolidated.  The newly enrolled believers must be constantly 
encouraged to assume an increasing share of the responsibilities and of 
the administrative functions devolving upon the members of the 
community.  The pioneer activities undertaken by its members must, 
however great the sacrifices involved, be increasingly developed, 
systematised and accelerated.  The needs of the Faith in the newly 
opened territories in the west, in the north, and in the south, must, 
while the specific goals of the Plan are being pursued, be given special 
attention, in order to enrich the life of the entire community, to 
increase the diversity of its constituent elements, to demonstrate the 
welding and assimilative power of the Faith, and to stimulate the 
processes now set in motion for the spiritual regeneration of all the 
ethnic elements within the British Isles.  
     In token of my gratitude for the work already accomplished, as a 
recognition of the status achieved by the British &Baha'i community in 
the Western Hemisphere, in anticipation of the tasks that still remain 
to be undertaken, I feel moved to initiate, as soon as the situation here 
permits, measures that will enable me, through the institution of a 
Palestine Branch of the British &Baha'i National Assembly, to register 
in the name of the body of the elected representatives of the followers 
of &Baha'u'llah throughout the British Isles, a portion of &Baha'i 
international endowments dedicated to the Shrine of the &Bab on 
Mount Carmel.  May this step, associating it with its sister national 
assemblies in the United States and India in the possession of so sacred 
a trust, lend its share to the consolidation and distinction of the central 
institution of the Administrative Order of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in 
the British Isles.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated July 14th and of 
July 20th, August 6th and 30th and September 11th and October 
8th, have been received, as well as various enclosures forwarded, 
and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     ...There are always bound to be some human complications 
cropping up in the work, but with love and patience these can 
usually be smoothed out, and he feels your assembly invariably 
shows these qualities in helping the friends to overcome their 
problems.  
     He believes that people such as ... have no real idea of what 
the New History Society stands for, and can therefore be taught 
the Faith, and converted to it, by the right handling.  All the 
friends must do in such cases is to make quite sure that the person 
in question is sincere and grasps the Will and Testament.  There 
are, of course, some individuals in whom the subversive spirit of 
Sohrab has taken root, and these should be carefully guarded 
against, but they are more the exception than the rule.  
     He feels that the local Assemblies should be encouraged to 
realise that the National Committees are constituted to serve 
their needs, not to dictate arbitrarily to them, and to unify the 
work of the Cause which is now spreading so rapidly in the 
 
+P219 
British Isles.  The committees in question should be very tactful 
in dealing with a young assembly which is beginning to "feel its 
oats", as this spirit of independence, if properly handled, can lead 
it to be strong and independent rather than weak and always 
relying on other bodies to carry it forward.  Assemblies, however, 
should certainly co-operate with National Committees and not 
refuse their assistance.  
     Dr. &Yunis &Khan &Afrukhteh is planning to go to England for 
medical treatment, and the Guardian would appreciate your 
Assembly's giving him every assistance possible.  He has been ill 
for some time, and Shoghi Effendi hopes he will recover his 
health, as he is a wonderful believer, full of wisdom and 
devotion, and his services are much needed in the Cause.  He has 
advised him to assist you in your teaching work as soon as his 
health permits this exertion.  
     He also hopes dear Dr. &Lotfullah &Hakim will be of valuable 
assistance in your teaching work.  
     He has recently asked Mr. &Varqa, his representative, to transfer 
to your Assembly five hundred pounds to assist you in your 
manifold activities connected with your Six Year Plan.  
Unfortunately it is not possible to send any money out of 
Palestine at present, even from Persia it is difficult to transfer 
funds, but he trusts this sum will be of assistance to you.  
     The Guardian feels that the assemblies of Cardiff, Dublin and 
Edinburgh must receive sustained support, as they are the three 
most important assemblies formed under the Plan, and must be 
built into strong and flourishing communities, free from any 
danger of relapse.  
     He is very happy about the general progress of the work in the 
British Isles, and the remarkable, sustained, and self-sacrificing 
work the believers are doing, guided and assisted by the devoted 
efforts of your Assembly.  
     You may be sure you are all remembered in his prayers in the 
Holy Shrines, and he eagerly awaits news of fresh victories in the 
teaching field.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved friends and co-workers, 
     The opening of the Final Phase of the First Collective Enterprise 
undertaken in the history of the British &Baha'i community marks the 
closing of a stage of tremendous historic significance in the evolution 
 
+P220 
of that community and, indeed, in the spiritual history of the British 
Isles.  Well nigh fifty years after the inception of that community, 
almost a quarter of a century after the birth of the Administrative 
Order, and on the morrow of the world-wide celebrations of the 
centenary of the Faith, a Plan, ambitious in its scope and endowed 
with vast potentialities, was nobly and spontaneously conceived by the 
small band of its devoted adherents in those islands.  An effort, 
extending over a period of no less than four years, nation-wide in its 
range, sustained, systematic, prodigious has been exerted.  A victory 
unparalleled in British &Baha'i annals has been achieved.  Towards its 
consummation newly won recruits to the ranks of this growing 
community, representative of the English, the Scottish, the Irish and 
Welsh races have notably contributed.  The seeds sown, with such 
lavish hands by the Founder of that community in the course of two 
successive visits to the United Kingdom, have at last germinated.  The 
machinery of the Administrative Order, slowly and laboriously taking 
shape, on the morrow of His ascension, has, as destined by Him who 
delineated its features in His Will and Testament, been put to the 
service of this newly conceived Plan, and is now yielding its first fruits.  
Born at the turn of the last century, its nucleus formed in the heart and 
nerve centre of a far-flung Empire, gestating for over a decade whilst 
confined to the narrow limits of the English territory whence it first 
sprang, energised, after having lain dormant for no less than ten years, 
through the twice repeated journeys of the Centre of &Baha'u'llah's 
Covenant to both the English and Scottish capitals, shaped and trained 
through the processes of a divinely conceived, slowly evolving 
Administrative Order, propelled along the broad highroad of its destiny 
in direct consequence of the initial operation of the First Plan set in 
operation for its further unfoldment, emerging as a truly representative 
and firmly-knit community, at the conclusion of the Initial Phase of 
that Plan through the spread of its ramifications among the peoples 
of Scotland, Wales and Ireland, the organised band of the followers 
of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah throughout the British Isles, within sight 
of the conclusion of the Final Phase of the Six Year Plan, stands on 
the threshold of a door which when opened will disclose to the eyes of 
its members a vista of vast dimensions, of majestic beauty, of infinite 
promise.  
     Theirs is the unrivalled opportunity, should they bestir themselves, 
to carry forward to a triumphant conclusion this first corporate effort 
to which they have consecrated themselves and their nascent 
 
+P221 
institutions, to embark, in the course of subsequent Plans, on 
enterprises destined to safeguard and consolidate, in all parts of the 
motherland, the achievements so hardly won, to proclaim, unequivocally, 
systematically and effectively, to the masses throughout the 
length and breadth of the British Isles the verities enshrined in their 
Faith, to initiate the establishment of a befitting National 
&Haziratu'l-Quds in either the capital of the United Kingdom or further 
north in the very heart of the British Isles, to inaugurate national and local 
endowments, to incorporate the newly constituted assemblies, to 
undertake the preliminary measures for the erection of the first 
&Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in the British Empire, and to launch crusades 
designed to implant the banner of the Faith and lay the structural basis 
of its Administrative Order throughout the diversified, the numerous 
and widely scattered colonies of the British Crown.  
     Not theirs, however, while the present tasks remain as yet 
unaccomplished, to dwell upon, or even visualise, however dimly, the 
course which the progress of their subsequent labours must assume in 
a world whose stability is so lamentably shaken, and whose immediate 
future is so dark.  Theirs is the duty to derive from this fleeting glimpse 
of the glories which their future destiny holds in store for them fresh 
inspiration and added stimulus for a befitting performance of the work 
that lies immediately ahead.  
     Two brief years separate them from the hour destined to witness the 
total triumph of their first organised, nation-wide collective enterprise.  
Every minute of this interval is infinitely precious.  The gloom 
overhanging the entire planet is deepening ominously every day.  The 
American followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, through the ever-swelling 
army of their pioneers and settlers, on the northern, the 
western and southern fringes of the European Continent, as well as 
the newly resuscitated German and Austrian &Baha'i communities 
labouring in its very heart, have nobly arisen, and are doing their part 
in paving the way for the spiritual awakening and the ultimate 
redemption of the teeming millions of its war-torn, discordant, fear-stricken 
and spiritually famished inhabitants.  
     They who man the North-Western outpost of the Faith in Europe 
must, whilst pursuing their chartered course, play a distinctive part in 
this threefold crusade launched, almost simultaneously, from three 
directions, in conformity with specifically laid out plans, at so critical 
an hour, in so vast a field, amidst such diversified and conflicting races 
and nations of what may well be regarded as the cradle of a civilisation, 
 
+P222 
and the mother of a Faith, whose fate now hangs so perilously in the 
balance.  
     That the valiant community of the British followers of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah may assume an ever-increasing share in this gloriously 
unfolding, this herculean, this Divinely propelled enterprise is the 
dearest wish of my heart and the object of my constant prayers.

     He feels that, although precedence must be given to the new 
goal assemblies, this does not mean the older assemblies like 
Bournemouth can afford to be neglected.  They must be 
maintained, but the first call on pioneers must be from the 
critical goal assemblies who--at least theoretically--need help 
more urgently!  He has just cabled you about this.  
     He sees no objection to your printing excerpts from his 
"Dispensation" and "God Passes By" in your compilation on the 
Covenant.  Although he strongly feels that the Master's writings, 
the revealed Word of &Baha'u'llah and the &Bab, and his own 
writings should, out of respect for the difference in their relative 
stations, be published whenever possible in separate volumes, 
 
+F1 Louise Charlot, Constance Langdon-Davies+, and Cyril Jenkerson were 
+F1 pioneering to Oxford.  
 
+P225 
this must not be fanatically adhered to where an educative 
compilation on a certain subject is conceived.  
     A vacancy can be recognised, under the circumstances you 
outlined in your letter of December 22, 1948, and a new 
assembly member be elected.  But of course this in no way 
implies the retiring member of the Assembly is not a full voting 
believer, and a member of the community in good standing.  
     He deeply sympathises with the struggles of the British &Baha'is 
at present to perform their task, now reaching the crucial stage, 
in spite of financial difficulties and shortage of pioneers.  It would 
seem as if all our tasks, all over the world, including here at the 
World Centre, are becoming increasingly more of a challenge to 
us.  As the time approaches for the ending of the various Plans, 
Six Year ones, Seven Year, Five Year, etc., the obstacles seem to 
become greater, and the friends are made to realise that very real, 
hard, often back-breaking effort and sacrifice is involved!  The 
The American &Baha'is here-to-fore so relatively easily 
victorious(!), are now feeling a very real squeeze on their 
resources and determination.  The same is true of India, Persia, 
and the other countries with goals to accomplish within a fixed 
and rapidly diminishing period!  He himself, having undertaken 
at such a disturbed time to raise at least the first story or arcade 
of the new part of the &Bab's Shrine, finds himself beset with 
worries, problems and complications which have not only 
doubled his work, but exhaust and harass him all the time.  So at 
least, let the British friends know that when they struggle and 
feel hard beset, they are not struggling and worrying alone!  Far 
from it!!  
     We must expect these things:  It is becoming evident that the 
world is not yet through with its labour, the New Age not yet 
fully born, real Peace not yet right around the corner.  We must 
have no illusions about how much depends on us and our success 
or failure.  All humanity is disturbed and suffering and confused; 
we cannot expect to not be disturbed and not to suffer--but we 
don't have to be confused.  On the contrary, confidence and 
assurance, hope and optimism are our prerogative.  The successful 
carrying out of our various Plans is the greatest sign we can give 
of our faith and inner assurance, and the best way we can help 
our fellow-men out of their confusion and difficulties.  
     He assures you he feels that the British &Baha'is have got what 
 
+P226 
it takes (to be a trifle slangy) to be successful and accomplish their 
goals.  Let them therefore demonstrate it to the rest of the &Baha'i 
World....  
     P.S.--Your letter of April 4th has just been received.  The 
Guardian is too busy to undertake at present the revision of 
&Baha'u'llah's Tablet to the Christians, but he has no objection to 
a committee doing it.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The British &Baha'i community, now embarked on the final phase 
of the first historic collective enterprise undertaken in British &Baha'i 
history, stands at the parting of the ways.  Only a brief interval 
separates it from the fateful date when its first experiment in a collective 
nation-wide effort to achieve a definite goal in the path of service to its 
beloved Faith will have ended.  Five years of stupendous effort, of 
magnificent self-sacrifice, of marvellous dedication and of splendid 
cooperation have marked the progressive evolution of the Plan to its 
present stage.  What has been achieved during this short span of years, 
despite the smallness of numbers, the paucity of resources and the 
exhaustion resulting from a prolonged and severely devastating 
conflict, has, beyond the shadow of a doubt, eclipsed the brightest 
achievements recorded in the course of more than half a century in the 
annals of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in that country.  
     The &Baha'i world, in its entirety, is struck with amazement at the 
quality of the work performed, at the extent and number of the 
victories achieved by this community.  Its sister-community in the 
great Republic of the West, already laden with many and splendid 
trophies gathered in distant fields and over a long period of time cannot 
regard this resurgence of the &Baha'i spirit, this manifestation of &Baha'i 
solidarity, these ennobling evidences of &Baha'i achievement, amidst so 
conservative a people, within so short a time, under such trying 
circumstances, and by so small a band of workers, except with feelings 
compounded of envy, of admiration and respect.  Its sister-communities 
throughout the East, venerable by reason of their age, and the sacrifices 
they have made, and fully aware of the long period of incubation this 
community has undergone, recall, with feelings of delight, &Abdu'l-Baha's 
prediction, forecasting the germination, at their appointed time, 
of the potent seeds His loving hands have sown in the course of His 
twice-repeated visit to that Island, and marvel at the rapidity with 
which its soil is now manifesting the potentialities with which it has 
 
+P227 
been endowed.  He Who blessed it with His footsteps, Who called into 
being, and fostered the growth of, the community labouring in that 
Island, hails, from His station on high, the exploits which immortalise 
the small band of His present-day consecrated and resolute followers, 
who are carrying on the torch which He Himself had entrusted to their 
immediate predecessors.  &Baha'u'llah Himself lauds the conspicuous 
victories being won in His Name, in the dawning years of the Second 
&Baha'i Century, at the very heart and centre of the greatest Empire the 
world has ever seen, whose Sovereign Monarch He Himself had 
addressed and whose deeds He, with His Own pen, had commended.  
     The one remaining year, ere the present Plan of this blessed, this 
radiant and spiritually potent community, is scheduled to draw to a 
close, cannot, must not, be allowed to jeopardise the prizes so 
painstakingly won during five memorable years of British &Baha'i 
history.  The newly-enrolled believers, on whom the mantle of the first 
generation of &Abdu'l-Baha's British disciples has now fallen, and are 
now summoned to participate in a Plan, whose scope and potency their 
predecessors could have never visualised and whose initial success must 
thrill and rejoice their souls in the &Abha Kingdom, have a distinct, a 
sacred, a peculiar and urgent responsibility to discharge in ensuring the 
consummation of this mighty enterprise.  Through active and constant 
participation with their veteran co-workers, in filling swiftly the still 
remaining gaps in the pattern of the Plan, now in its concluding stage; 
in displaying systematic and sustained activity in the pioneer field 
now stretching before them; in sacrificing, in as great a measure as 
possible, their resources, to facilitate the attainment of all its goals, they 
can best discharge their immense debt of gratitude to the Cause of the 
Most Great Name, Who has singled them out, at so critical an hour, 
and from among such a vast multitude of their slumbering countrymen, 
to serve and glorify His Faith.  
     I entreat them, and plead as well with their older brethren who have 
set so momentous a Plan in motion, to arise as one soul, to exert one 
more superhuman effort, to fix steadily their gaze on the pinnacle they 
are visibly approaching and to disencumber themselves of any burden 
impeding their arduous climb, in a last and determined attempt to scale 
and conquer the summit, from which alone they can catch a glimpse of 
the future glory of their destiny.

&Baha'i Public Relations, Mr. Richard Backwell, sec.  
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Our Guardian thanks you very kindly for the excellent piece 
of publicity you forwarded to him with your letter of March 31.  
It should bring the Cause to the attention of many, and is sober, 
and very encouraging, in tone.  
     He hopes your committee will have many more triumphs 
along this line!...  
     P.S.  Please convey to Mr. George Marshall+ a cordial welcome 
into the service of our beloved Faith from our Guardian.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Assuring you of my loving prayers for the success of your constant 
and meritorious efforts in the service of our beloved Faith, and for the 
realisation of your heart's desire in its service, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters dated April 8, 22, 27; May 13, 17, 24; June 7, 10, 
 
+P231 
23 (two of this date), 25, 28; July 19, 22, and 30:  and August 
10th, together with various enclosures, have been received by 
our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer them 
on his behalf.  
     He has already informed you by cable of his views regarding....  
He realises that, of course, it is very difficult for him to 
renounce his plan of educating his son ... in England, and the 
Guardian hopes that the boy can find a way, either through 
doing agricultural work or gaining a scholarship, or through the 
help his father might himself obtain from Persia for him, to go 
on with his studies.  But it is obviously out of the question for 
your Assembly to shoulder this financial burden.  
     He already cabled you about the appropriate manner for 
commemorating the Centenary of the &Bab's martyrdom, so I 
will not go into the subject again here.  
     The fine spirit of co-operation shown by ... pleased him 
immensely.  He has since received from her a letter full of joy and 
devotion to the Cause, which pleased him greatly....  
     Now that the Cause is spreading so rapidly throughout the 
world, the National Assemblies must be vigilant, and do all they 
can to protect and assert its independent status, and to give 
assistance to isolated or repressed Assemblies, when they are 
turned to for help or advice.  
     He has recently received enthusiastic letters from Mrs. 
Preston+ in Kenya and informed her that when she needs advice 
or assistance she should turn to your Assembly, while, of course, 
keeping in close contact with him as well.  
     He realises that your Assembly, and all the British &Baha'is, are 
facing the most difficult and critical months of your Plan.  The 
friends must be made to realise that the urgency of the task 
during these few months which lie ahead, is not only acute but 
temporary.  Once they make this final effort, and clamber to the 
top of their goal, they can rest.  The opportunity for achievement 
is absolutely unique, for this is their first Plan, and consequently 
the most historic one of the many they will, no doubt, carry out 
in future decades.  To fail, so near to victory, would indeed be 
sad, and he cannot but suppose, would be a severe blow to that 
stubborn British pride which is so famous for its tenacity of 
purpose!  However he himself is not thinking in terms of their 
failure, but rather believes they can, by one last determined 
 
+P232 
drive, be successful, even if they feel some exhaustion at the end 
of their race against time.  They must, likewise, at this crucial 
hour, remember that failure or success are never confined to the 
immediate community concerned, but have wide repercussions.  
Their success will not only greatly enhance their prestige in the 
&Baha'i World, but will inspire the often flagging efforts of the 
believers in the East, who have so many obstacles to overcome, 
and are by nature and experience more prone to become 
disheartened in the execution of fixed tasks.  
     It was the success of America's first Seven Year Plan which so 
stimulated the British community that it, in its turn, was 
determined to have a Plan and a victory of its own.  Now it 
really cannot lose; it has gone too far, laboured too brilliantly, 
shown too much courage and high sacrifice, to let, at the last 
minute, the prize fall from its grasp!  
     His prayers and thoughts are with you all, constantly, and 
with all the believers, toiling so devotedly all over the British 
Isles....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     As the Plan, to which the entire British community has pledged its 
support, approaches its end, my heart turns with increasing longing 
and expectation, towards those who so spontaneously initiated it, so 
enthusiastically set it in motion, so valiantly overthrew the barriers 
that confronted them in the initial stage of its unfoldment, who so 
unitedly consecrated their efforts to its subsequent development, and 
who are now within sight of its final consummation.  I cannot believe 
that a community which, motivated by so noble an impulse, capable of 
such prodigious efforts, dedicated so whole-heartedly to so gigantic a 
task, blessed by so many evidences of Divine assistance and guidance, 
enriched by the first fruits garnered in the course of the execution of a 
splendidly conceived enterprise, will allow, at the very moment when 
final victory is, at long last, within sight, through a momentary 
relaxation of effort, the magnificent prize of total success, to slip from 
its grasp, and the fortunes of such a potentially powerful undertaking 
to be marred by any feelings of impotence or exhaustion which might 
well, at the eleventh hour, assail those who have for so long and in such 
a great measure, expended their energies for the prosecution of so 
weighty and far-reaching a Plan.  
 
+P233 
     The required number of pioneers who must arise, while there is yet 
time, and stop the dangerous breaches which a fate-laden Plan, now in 
the last stages of its development, reveals to the eyes of its prosecutors 
must, however costly the sacrifice, be instantly found, and rushed 
without delay to the scene of action.  The funds, which must enable 
these last minute pioneers to adjust their affairs and settle down 
wherever most needed, must, under no circumstances, and particularly 
on the part of the well-to-do, be withheld, as the present critical 
situation moves towards its climax.  
     Great and overpowering as these sacrifices may now appear, they 
will, when viewed in their proper perspective, be adjudged as 
inconsiderable, and pale into insignificance when balanced against the 
inestimable advantages which must accrue to a community that has 
achieved total and complete victory for a Plan so epoch-making in 
character, and so charged with undreamt of potentialities.  The sacrifices 
which this fateful hour calls for, are by their very nature, individual; 
the loss or inconvenience they entail are at most transitory in their 
effect, and might well be fully compensated for in the days ahead, 
whereas the blessings that must irresistibly flow out, as the result of the 
integral success of a nation-wide, historically unprecedented Plan, will 
enrich and ennoble the life of an entire community, exert an abiding 
influence on its fortunes, and empower it to launch still mightier 
crusades in the course of subsequent stages in its organic spiritual 
development.  How bountiful, moreover, will be the rewards which He 
who watches from on high the varying fortunes of the Plan and 
presides over its destinies, must either in this world or in the next--
and it may well be in both--choose to confer upon those, who, at the 
hour of the Plan's greatest need, will fly to its succour, exhibit the 
rarest evidences of courage and heroism, and choose to subordinate 
their personal interests to the immediate needs and future glory of the 
community to which they belong.  
     The interval during which a decision so momentous, so rich in 
promise, must be taken is steadily and inexorably shrinking.  The 
golden opportunity which such a decision offers will never again recur.  
The issues hinging on such a decision can neither be over-estimated 
nor visualised while the fate of the First Plan embarked upon by the 
British &Baha'i community still hangs in the balance.  The invisible 
hosts of the Kingdom are ready and eager to rush forth to the assistance 
of such as will have the courage to weigh the issues involved and to 
take the decision commensurate with these issues.  To such as take it, 
 
+P234 
while there is yet time, the present generation as well as those who will 
succeed it will be eternally grateful, for theirs will have been the 
privilege of sealing on the one hand, the fate of the First Historic Plan 
in British &Baha'i annals, and on the other of paving the way for the 
initiation of the successive enterprises that must follow in its wake.  
     To reach such a decision, to face willingly and cheerfully its 
consequences, will, above all, earn the good-pleasure and commendation 
of the One Who, well nigh a hundred years ago, so gloriously made 
the supreme sacrifice of laying down His life that the Cause for which 
the present prosecutors of the Plan have so wholly dedicated themselves 
might live, prosper and bear, in the fullness of time, its fairest fruit in 
both the East and the West.  
     Dear friends!  As the tale of the woes and trials He endured is called 
to mind, during the months preceding the centenary of His martyrdom, 
and destined to witness the conclusion of the Six Year Plan sponsored 
by the British &Baha'i community, a resolution, born of the love and 
admiration which the memory of His heroic life and tragic death must 
evoke in every &Baha'i heart, should seize, and galvanise into action, 
the little band of His lovers and followers, who, of their own accord, 
and at the dawn of the second &Baha'i century, have risen to launch the 
first collective enterprise in British &Baha'i history, and chosen to 
associate its consummation with the centenary of the death of the 
martyr Prophet and co-founder of their Faith.  The centenary of the 
inception of His Mission has witnessed the initiation of so 
praiseworthy, so vast and potent an enterprise, extending its 
ramifications over the entire territory of the British Isles.  The 
observances, commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the last act 
of His life, must, as pledged by its initiators, synchronise with the 
successful termination and glorious triumph of that same enterprise 
throughout the length and breadth of that same territory.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Summer School Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of October 9 was received, and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was very glad to hear the School was such a success this 
year, and that--a very important factor--it placed no extra 
burden on the National Fund at this critical juncture.  
     Next year your School will be held after the end of your Plan, 
he hopes the victorious end!  It would be suitable to hold some 
kind of review of how the goals were won and to remember the 
many sacrifices that have been made, for they have been very 
real and taxed to the uttermost the strength of the servants of 
&Baha'u'llah in the British Isles.  
     Also he feels it would be good to have some course on the 
Covenant, the force that binds and strengthens the &Baha'i 
community and holds it together, when so many man-made 
institutions are disintegrating and going on the rocks of discord 
and lack of faith.  
     Likewise, discussion of the future needs of the community 
should be held.  By next Summer you will know better what 
these are, and can formulate your points to be taken up and 
considered.  
     He will pray that a suitable place may be found for the friends 
to gather.  
     Every year your school is more representative and successful 
than the year before, and he feels sure this will continue to be so 
until that happy day comes when Summer School develops at 
last into a seat of &Baha'i learning....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your meritorious efforts, guide and sustain 
you in your activities, enable you to extend continually their range,

and contribute to the consolidation of the newly-born institutions of

&Baha'is of the British Isles 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     The Guardian approves of the policy your committee is 
pursuing, as outlined in your letter to him of October 27th, of 
devoting all the energies of the British Youth, active in the 
Cause, to assisting in the achievement of the goals of the Plan.  
     He was very happy to hear your part of the programme at 
Summer School was more successful than ever before, and that 
the Bulletin is being maintained and at the same time costing 
less.  
     Your determination, and the work you are doing, are 
admirable, and he is very pleased with you all....

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of January 12th, written by Mr. Hainsworth, was 
received, as well as the material enclosed, and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was glad to learn the Manchester Conference was such a 
success, and appreciated the very generous offer of Mr. Leach+.  
If the believers all over the world were animated by such a spirit, 
there would scarcely be any necessity for "Plans".  
     These days, as &Ridvan approaches, his anxious thoughts are 
with not only the British community, but other &Baha'i 
communities in different parts of the world.  He longs to see 
them fully achieve their goals; for to do something for God 100 
per cent has an attractive power, and brings future Divine 
confirmations.  
     His ardent prayers are with you all, you may be sure....  

          [From the Guardian:]
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain and guide you in your 
historic labours, aid you to extend the range of your splendid 
achievements, consolidate the victories you have won, and lend a still 
greater impetus to the progress and expansion of your unforgettable 
accomplishments.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     At the instruction of our beloved Guardian I am forwarding 
you the enclosed material for possible use in connection with the 
centenary of the &Bab's martyrdom.  
 
+F1 Mary Basil-Hall, "Parvine".  
 
+P247 
     In America they are going to get out a pamphlet with this and 
other material, more complete, which the Guardian has asked 
them to forward you copies of as soon as printed.  
     He regrets the delay in answering your Assembly's letters.  My 
father has been desperately ill for over 8 weeks and the worry 
involved and doctors, nurses etc. has been so distressing to us all 
that it has been temporarily impossible to attend to his mail.  
However, now he is improving, the Guardian hopes to shortly 
be able to get his letters answered....  
 
 
15 June 1950 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your many communications dated August 20, 26; September 
30; October 6, 7, 10, 26; November 7, 9, 14, 23, 25; December 
8, 18, 22, 23 (two of this date), 24, all of 1949, and January 4, 20, 
30; February 2, 22; March 1, 6, 18, 29 (two of this date); April 
7, 18, 19 (two of this date), 24, 27; and May 2, 4, 8, 16 (three of 
this date) of 1950, have been received as well as their enclosures 
and other material, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me 
to answer you on his behalf.  
     He regrets very much the long delay in not only answering 
your Assembly's letters but those of other N.S.A.s' as well.  The 
past winter, owing to the fact that large excavations had to be 
carried out behind the Shrine in order to permit construction to 
continue, was a particularly busy gruelling one for him.  On top 
of this, at the beginning of April, Mr. Maxwell became 
dangerously ill and the constant worry and preoccupation of us 
all with doctors, nurses, etc., forced the Guardian to put aside his 
letters entirely for the time being.  Thanks to the mercy of God 
Mr. Maxwell is now recovering slowly; but the past months 
were very difficult ones for everyone.  
     To now take up the various matters referred to in your letters.  
     The Guardian does not feel that a quorum of delegates is 
necessary in any sense for the convention.  Under unusual 
circumstances National bodies can be elected by mailed votes of 
all the delegates; the primary function of the delegates is to elect 
 
+P248 
the N.S.A.  Suggestions from the Convention floor can be made 
by a majority of those present.  
     The Guardian is very pleased to see that Peter Esslemont is 
growing closer to the Faith.  A friendly contact with him should 
always be maintained.  
     Regarding his cable concerning Hussein:  he has been very 
surprised to note that the terms "low-born Christian girl" and 
"disgraceful alliance" should arouse any question:  it seems to him 
that the friends should realise it is not befitting for the Guardian's 
own brother, the grandchild of the Master, an &Afnan and &Aghsan 
mentioned in the Will and Testament of the Master, and of 
whom so much was expected because of his relation to the 
Family of the Prophet, to marry an unknown girl, according to 
goodness knows what rite, who is not a believer at all.  Surely, 
every &Baha'i must realise that the terms low-born and Christian 
are definitions of a situation and in no way imply any 
condemnation of a person's birth or the religion they belong to 
as such.  We have no snobbery and no religious prejudice in our 
Faith.  But the members of the Master's family have contracted 
marriages which cannot be considered in any other light than 
disgraceful, in view of what &Abdu'l-Baha wished for them.  
     Recently the Court of First Instance, in &Karkuk, &Iraq, has 
accepted to register a &Baha'i marriage certificate.  This is the first 
time in the East (except for the British Mandate authorities and 
the Israeli Government), that a &Baha'i marriage has been 
recognised as being legal.  The Guardian feels that this can form 
a very important precedent for the other Oriental countries, and 
he suggests you inform the Egyptian N.S.A. of his view and urge 
them to press for due recognition in Egypt, using this precedent 
as a lever.  
     There is nothing in our teachings about Freud and his method.  
Psychiatric treatment in general is no doubt an important 
contribution to medicine, but we must believe it is still a 
growing rather than a perfected science.  As &Baha'u'llah has urged 
us to avail ourselves of the help of good physicians &Baha'is are 
certainly not only free to turn to psychiatry for assistance but 
should, when available, do so.  This does not mean psychiatrists 
are always wise or always right, it means we are free to avail 
ourselves of the best medicine has to offer us.  
     The Guardian thanks you and the friends for your eagerness 
 
+P249 
to contribute to the cost of the Shrine through the special edition 
of "Prescription for Living"; also he thanks the friends at 
Convention for the copy they sent him.  
     I need not tell you how immensely relieved, proud and 
gratified the beloved Guardian was when he knew the British 
community had achieved their Plan so successfully.  During the 
last year he was often anxious as he shared with your Assembly 
and the National Teaching Committee the news of how acute 
the position was, and how great the obstacles still remaining to 
be overcome.  
     From the beginning, however, he felt confident that this 
dedicated and courageous community could and would drive 
through to victory, and his joy was very great when it did.  He 
firmly believes this will exert a great influence on the future of 
the &Baha'i community there, and indirectly on the history of that 
country in the days to come.  It is not possible, at close range, to 
understand the implications of what we do; but when we see 
things in historical perspective, we realise that what seemed 
small at the time was really a turning point in destiny.  
     The Guardian was delighted to receive the Welsh pamphlet, 
also the map you sent him.  He is planning to have the map 
published in the next edition of "&Baha'i World", and he placed 
the pamphlet in the Mansion of &Baha'u'llah.  
     He approves of the Investment Scheme of the Publishing 
Trust, and he trusts that the members of the community will 
respond and thus enable your Assembly to expand its publishing 
activities.  He leaves the question of approaching &Baha'is overseas, 
should the Trust be in need of further capital, to your Assembly's 
discretion.  
     The Guardian does not approve of your placing a condition 
upon recognition of local assemblies (mentioned in your letter 
of January 20); and he wishes in this connection to emphasise the 
fact that every possible care should be taken not to add to 
existing rules and regulations in the form of statements or 
otherwise.  He has already advised the American and other 
National Assemblies to beware of adding more rules and 
regulations.  
     The death of Mrs. Hall, such a faithful and devoted servant of 
the Faith, is a great loss to the British community.  The Guardian 
appreciated receiving a copy of her Will, which mirrors her 
 
+P250 
solicitude for the interests of the Cause in England.  He trusts that 
a &Baha'i Ceremony could take place at the graveside, which 
certainly would have been her own wish.  
     Regarding ..., if the financial response of the friends to the 
needs of the Faith there is not sufficient for your Assembly to 
continue to defray his expenses as a teacher and pioneer, then it 
seems inevitable that he will have to make some other plans.  His 
services have been of real value, and his intimate knowledge of 
the teachings and steadfastness in the Covenant have enabled 
him to contribute much to the understanding of the friends.  
     The Guardian approves your resolution to keep Mr. Ferraby+ 
as paid secretary of the Assembly.  He deeply appreciates Mr. 
Ferraby's devoted services.  
     The Guardian wishes to assure you, one and all, of his prayers 
for the success of the new work your Assembly will be 
undertaking, and for the consolidation of all the recent goals 
achieved.  
     P.S.  Also just received are a receipt for the Guardian's 
contribution, dated May 15th and your letter, with enclosure, of 
May 28th and May 24th.  A photo of the Shrine will be mailed 
you very soon.  
     P.P.S.  The Guardian will certainly pray for the progress and 
happiness of the soul of Mr. Manton.  No doubt the selfless 
services his son has rendered the Cause of God, in an hour of 
great need, will be accepted and enable him to influence the state 
of his father through his own prayers.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     On the occasion of the victorious consummation of the first historic 
Plan undertaken by the British &Baha'i community, I feel moved to reaffirm 
my feelings of exultation, joy and gratitude for the superb 
triumph that marks such a great turning point in British &Baha'i 
history.  No single event, in the course of its half-a-century existence, 
with the exception of the twice repeated visit of the Centre of the 
Covenant to the British Isles, has proved as significant and momentous 
as this unique collective achievement, which may, in a sense, be 
regarded as the first and long-awaited fruit of that intimate and 
personal contact, established both in private and in public, by &Abdu'l-Baha 
with its members as well as with various representatives of the 
country to which it belongs.  
 
+P251 
     So magnificent an achievement has, no doubt, endowed the entire 
community, now representative of the peoples of England, Wales, 
Scotland and Ireland, with tremendous potentialities, empowering it 
to launch on the first stage of its historic overseas mission destined to 
bring that community into closer and more concrete association with 
its sister communities in North America and Egypt, for the purpose of 
promoting the Faith in the vast virgin territories where its banner is 
still unraised and which constitute an integral part of the territories of 
the British Crown beyond the confines of that community's homeland.  
     To the races and tribes inhabiting these territories throughout the 
vast African Continent &Abdu'l-Baha when His life was in imminent 
danger, specifically referred in a Tablet, addressed by Him to the 
cousin of the &Bab and chief builder of the first &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of 
the &Baha'i world, in which He predicts, in moving terms, the 
awakening of the peoples of that dark continent and the ultimate 
triumph of His Father's Faith among its backward peoples as well as 
among the great masses inhabiting China and India.  
     To the accomplishment of the initial stages of this colossal task, 
envisaged by our beloved Master, the &Baha'i community of the British 
Isles, now greatly reinforced, resting on a far broader foundation, 
galvanised into action, qualified through its initial signal victory in its 
homeland--the base of its future operations overseas, is now summoned 
to direct its attention and its energies.  
     While, in the current and two succeeding years which separate us 
from the celebration of the centenary of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's 
prophetic mission, close and sustained attention should be directed by 
the elected representatives, as well as by the rank and file, of that 
community towards the safeguarding of the prizes won throughout the 
length and breadth of the British Isles, and the consolidation of the 
newly born institutions, the preliminary steps, constituting the prelude 
to this prodigious systemic labour and soul-thrilling enterprise, destined 
to extend its ramifications, in the years that lie ahead, to the fringe and 
within the very heart of a vast continent, must be carefully and 
prayerfully taken.  
     Though the members of this community are still restricted in 
number, though its resources are as yet meagre, though its recent 
victories are as yet unconsolidated, though it has hardly recuperated 
from its recent labours, undertaken during a period of great national 
exhaustion and severe austerity, the mere act of launching upon so 
glorious, so fateful an enterprise, will, of necessity, create at this 
 
+P252 
propitious hour the receptivity which will enable a swiftly marching, 
stout-hearted, virile community, now standing on the threshold of its 
mission beyond the seas, to attract a fresh measure of celestial potency 
adequate to its growing needs and its ever expanding responsibilities.  
The miracle its members have performed over so vast a territory, in so 
short a time, and under such adverse circumstances, cannot but augur 
well for the initial success of an enterprise infinitely more meritorious, 
of far greater promise, and endowed with vastly superior spiritual 
potentialities.  
     How great the honour with which the &Baha'i pioneers of the present 
generation of the subjects of the British Crown will be invested in the 
eyes of posterity within their island home and abroad!  How great 
the debt of gratitude of those who will labour after them and garner the 
fruit of their present day assiduous exertions to those whose privilege 
is to blaze the trail and break the soil in the virgin territories destined, 
as prophesied by &Abdu'l-Baha, to acclaim the Faith of &Baha'u'llah and 
establish the institutions of His embryonic World Order!  
     This community, laden with the trophies of so recent and splendid 
a victory, and summoned to brace itself for another exertion, so fate-laden 
in its consequences, stands too near the structure which its hands 
are now rearing to visualise the dimensions of its task, appraise its 
value, and appreciate its future glory.  Alive to its inherent capacity, 
conscious of its high responsibility, aware of the sacredness of its 
mission, emboldened by its recent exploits, trusting fully in that 
reinforcing Power that guided and sustained it unfailingly in the past, 
this community can do no better than to gird up afresh its loins, turn 
its back upon the clamour of the age, its fears, confusion and strife, step 
resolutely forward on its chosen path, unshakably confident that with 
every step it takes, should it remain undeflected in its purpose and 
undimmed in its vision, a fresh outpouring of Divine grace will 
reinforce and guide its march on the highroad of its destiny.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters dated June 6th and two of June 13th have just 
reached the Guardian, with their enclosures, and he wishes you 
 
+P253 
to please regard this as a sort of postscript to the detailed letter to 
your Assembly which was mailed a short time ago.  He thanks 
you for the copies of correspondence with the Official Solicitor, 
and trusts this matter is now satisfactorily settled.  
     He approves of the advice your Assembly has given....  
However, he does not approve of ... going to Canada or South 
America.  He has been forced, owing to the very unfortunate 
influence of certain so-called &Baha'is from Persia, to lay down a 
general rule that no Persians for the present proceed to North or 
South America.  As many sincere souls have, through obedience 
to his instructions, given up trips to those territories, he feels he 
cannot permit any exceptions to be made, not even for so 
important a purpose as pioneering.  This would be a manifest 
injustice to those who have obeyed him with an exemplary 
spirit.  He feels sure ... will understand and accept this.  There are 
a great many places where they can serve the Faith in the East, in 
Europe, or in Africa.  
     Whatever form of co-operation will get the best results your 
Assembly is free to decide upon in regard to the Egyptian and 
American N.S.A.s' extension teaching in Africa.  He feels, 
however, that simultaneous activity is more practicable at 
present.  
     There are no specific tribes listed in the Master's Tablets; the 
pioneering should be directed at present towards the most 
feasible possibilities.  
     The Guardian feels that Kenya, as it already has a &Baha'i, 
should be excluded from your Plan.  Uganda and Tanganyika 
would be much more suitable in conjunction with any other 
territory, but not Nigeria, which already has some &Baha'is.  
However, it must not necessarily be these two.  
     Entirely aside from any additional literature it might be 
possible to get out in Hausa and Swahili he feels your objective 
must be to print at least a pamphlet in three languages other than 
those Philip Hainsworth has tackled.  It must be borne in mind 
that printing in new languages kills two birds with one stone--
not only does it enable the Faith to reach new elements, but it 
also enriches our literature and is excellent as a means of calling 
the attention of the public to the universality of our Cause and 
the extent of our world-wide activities!  
     He will be delighted to receive the reports regarding the 
progress of the British &Baha'is' first overseas mission.  
 
+P254 
     P.S.  Regarding expenditures:  the Guardian feels that the 
greatest effort should be made to curtail everything that is not 
essential; this is the primary responsibility of the N.S.A.  The 
Guardian will be very pleased to receive copies of the reports of 
the Africa and Consolidation Committees and was pleased to 
read the first two reports.

copies are desired you can enquire from the American N.S.A. 
what they cost etc.  
     He feels sure all the believers will be happy to see how

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Some time ago I wrote you on behalf of the Guardian giving 
you the following information, but as I have heard a letter to 
Mr. Holley posted at the same time has not been received, I fear 
yours too may have been lost.  
     The beloved Guardian has sent each of the National Assemblies 
under separate cover, a couple of enlarged photos of the finished 
arcade of the &Bab's Shrine.  These are a little gift from him.  He 
would like as many of the believers as possible to see them, and 
for them to then be hung wherever they would then be seen 
most, in some countries this would be the National Hazira.  
     He has sent two negatives to the American N.S.A., and 
instructed prints be made available for sale to the friends desiring 
copies.  You can no doubt order some if desired.  
     Please cable the Guardian acknowledging receipt of these 
photos as soon as they reach you....

(2 letters), October 31st, November 13th, November 24th (2 
letters), December 10th, December 22nd, 1950, and January 
2nd, January 25th and February 2nd, 20th, 1951, together with 
enclosures as well as photographs, have been received, and our 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
(A postscript dated March 18th adds:  "Your letters (two) dated 
March 8th have also been received with enclosures.")  
     He regrets that, due to pressure of work, he is not able to write 
more frequently, but feels that the cable communications 
between himself and your assembly attend to the essential work 
in between letters....  
     Regarding your question about the communication with the 
King, as mentioned in Minutes 292 and 344, he feels that both 
contemplated approaches should be dropped for the present.  By 
undertaking such action we call attention to ourselves in a very 
conspicuous manner, and investigation of who the senders are of 
such petitions would only expose the weakness of our numbers 
and detract from the prestige which the Cause is slowly 
beginning to acquire in the eyes of the world.  
     He thanks you very much for the map, showing the British 
&Baha'i community at the end of the Six Year Plan.  He has placed 
it on a wall of the Mansion of &Bahji, where visitors and believers 
can enjoy it.  It certainly marks the scene of one of the most 
historic victories of the Faith.  
     In regard to the question of the African campaign, the 
Guardian is immensely pleased with the way your assembly and 
the special committee you have appointed, have seized this 
project and are vigorously prosecuting it.  He admires the 
evidences of careful planning and staunch determination which 
all the data regarding this important campaign, which you have 
forwarded to him, bear witness to.  
     He was very happy to receive the Chinyanza pamphlets which 
you sent to him, and also likes very much the "Africa News" 
which the committee is getting out and which is so alive with 
plans and news.  
     He is also delighted to see that the Persian National Assembly 
is vigorously co-operating with your Assembly and facilitating 
settlement of some devoted Persian pioneer there who no doubt 
will be of great help to the work....  
 
+P259 
     He feels that, although it is preferable that the three pioneers 
to each virgin country should be in one town or at least as near 
each other as possible, it should not be considered the essential 
point at this juncture.  
     The most important thing of all is to get the pioneers out there 
and established if possible in some self-supporting work.  Once 
this has been done, the work within the country itself can be 
gradually organised and plans made to consolidate it in a more 
practical manner.  
     He used the word "tribes" loosely to mean the peoples of 
Africa and not necessarily individuals still living under tribal 
system.  
     The Guardian does not feel that it is necessary to specify any 
particular prayer to be said for the Africa work.  The main thing 
is that the &Baha'is should pray for its success.  
     He approves of your getting out the edition of the "New Era" 
which you now have in the press; but feels very strongly that 
any future editions should strictly conform to the 1937 American 
edition, in order to preserve uniformity in this very important 
&Baha'i publication.  
     Regarding your question about military service, the Guardian 
sees no reason why the &Baha'i in question should not bring a test 
case, and press the matter.  It is now, since he has become a 
follower of &Baha'u'llah, against his conscience to kill his fellow-men; 
and he should have the right to explain his position and ask 
to be exempted from combatant service.  During the hearing of 
such cases the &Baha'is should make it absolutely clear that we do 
not fear being placed in danger, and are not asking to be given 
a safe berth in hours of national crisis--quite the contrary--any 
dangerous service the &Baha'is can render their fellow-men during 
the agonies of war, they should be anxious to accept.  
     The work that the British &Baha'is are accomplishing is very 
dear to his heart; and he wishes your Assembly to constantly 
encourage the friends (as of course they are doing) to go on with 
all phases of their &Baha'i work and maintain the tempo they 
achieved during the past few years.  They have distinguished 
themselves so much that now their fellow &Baha'is in other lands 
expect them to lead the way in new fields, and to continue being 
the pace setters for at least the British Empire, if not other 
countries as well!  Success brings burdens; and the British &Baha'is 
 
+P260 
who were so miraculously successful at the last moment of their 
Six Year Plan, now find themselves in the sometimes difficult 
position of being a cynosure for all eyes.  
     He assures you, one and all, of his loving prayers for the work 
you are so faithfully carrying out on behalf of the believers in the 
British Isles....  
     P.S.--I wish to call your attention to certain things in 
"Principles of &Baha'i Administration" which has just reached the 
Guardian; although the material is good, he feels that the 
complete lack of quotation marks is very misleading.  His own 
words, the words of his various secretaries, even the Words of 
&Baha'u'llah Himself, are all lumped together as one text.  This is 
not only not reverent in the case of &Baha'u'llah's Words, but 
misleading.  Although the secretaries of the Guardian convey his 
thoughts and instructions and these messages are authoritative, 
their words are in no sense the same as his, their style certainly 
not the same, and their authority less, for they use their own 
terms and not his exact words in conveying his messages.  He 
feels that in any future edition this fault should be remedied, any 
quotations from &Baha'u'llah or the Master plainly attributed to 
them, and the words of the Guardian clearly differentiated from 
those of his secretaries.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The magnificent spirit of devotion and the initiative and 
resourcefulness demonstrated in recent months by a triumphant 
community, in its eagerness to launch, ahead of the appointed time, the 
enterprise destined to carry the fame of its members and establish its 
outposts as far afield as the African Continent, merit the highest 
praise.  By their organising ability, by their zeal in enlisting the 
collaboration of their sister communities in the African, the American 
and Asiatic continents for the effective prosecution of this epoch-making 
enterprise; by the tenacity, sagacity and fidelity which they 
have displayed in the course of its opening phase; by their utter 
consecration and their complete reliance on the One Who watches over 
their destiny, they have set an example worthy of emulation by the 
members of &Baha'i communities in both the East and the West.  
     The despatch of the first pioneer to Tanganyika, signalising the 
inauguration of the African campaign, following so closely upon the 
successful termination of the Six Year Plan, will be recognised by 
 
+P261 
posterity as the initial move in an undertaking designed to supplement 
and enrich the record of signal collective services rendered by the 
members of this community within the confines and throughout the 
length and breadth of its homeland.  On it, however great the support 
it will receive from its sister communities in the days to come, will 
devolve the chief responsibility of guiding the destinies, of supplying 
the motive power, and of contributing to the resources of a crusade 
which, for the first time in &Baha'i history, involves the collaboration, 
and affects the fortunes, of no less than four National Assemblies, in 
both Hemispheres and within four continents of the globe.  
     On the success of this enterprise, unprecedented in its scope, unique 
in its character and immense in its spiritual potentialities, must depend 
the initiation, at a later period in the Formative Age of the Faith, of 
undertakings embracing within their range all National Assemblies 
functioning throughout the &Baha'i World, undertakings constituting 
in themselves a prelude to the launching of world-wide enterprises 
destined to be embarked upon, in future epochs of that same Age, by 
the Universal House of Justice, that will symbolise the unity and 
coordinate and unify the activities of these National Assemblies.  
     Indeed the birth of this African enterprise, in the opening decade of 
the second &Baha'i century, coinciding as it does with the formation of 
the International &Baha'i Council, should be acclaimed as an event of 
peculiar significance in the evolution of our beloved Faith.  Both events 
will, no doubt, be hailed by posterity as simultaneous and compelling 
evidences of the irresistible unfoldment of a divinely appointed 
Administrative Order and of the development, on an international 
scale, of its subsidiary agencies, heralding the establishment of the 
Supreme Legislative Body designed to crown the Administrative 
Edifice now being laboriously erected by the privileged builders of a 
Divine Order, whose features have been delineated by the Centre of 
the Covenant in His Will and Testament, whose fundamental laws 
have been revealed by the Founder of our Faith in His &Kitab-i-Aqdas, 
and Whose advent has been foreshadowed by the Herald of the &Baha'i 
Dispensation in the &Bayan, His most weighty Book.  
     To be singled out as the chief agency in the prosecution of a task of 
such dimensions, such significance, and the harbinger of events so 
glorious, is indeed at once an inestimable blessing and a staggering 
responsibility with which the British &Baha'i community, emerging 
triumphantly and in rapid succession from the ordeal of a world war 
and the struggles involved in the prosecution of an historic Plan, has 
 
+P262 
been honoured at so critical and challenging an hour in the fortunes of 
mankind.  
     To labour assiduously for the despatch, in the coming year marking 
the official opening of the Two Year Plan, of pioneers to the chosen 
Territories of the African Continent; to ensure that its three sister 
National Assemblies will steadily reinforce its work through financial 
assistance as well as through the increase in the number of pioneers; 
to expedite the translation, publication and dissemination of &Baha'i 
literature in the three selected languages throughout these Territories; 
to enlarge the scope of the contacts established with representatives of 
the African peoples and with institutions designed to foster their 
interests; to cultivate cordial relations with, and secure the goodwill 
and support of, the civil authorities in the goal countries where the 
pioneers will reside; to maintain steady correspondence with, fan the 
zeal, seek the counsel and secure the assistance of the budding and 
scattered communities in the North, the South and the Heart of that 
vast, that promising and slowly awakening continent; to prepare for 
the eventual convocation, under its own auspices and following the 
example set, and the procedure adopted, by its sister American 
Assembly on the European Continent, of the First African Teaching 
Conference, representative of both the white and black races, 
constituting an epoch-making landmark in the evolution of the Faith 
among the African races and possibly synchronising with the centenary 
celebrations of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's Mission, and adding another 
victor's crown to the laurels already won by the British followers of the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah in their own homeland--these stand out as the 
paramount and inescapable duties confronting the British National 
Spiritual Assembly as it stands on the threshold of a new and glorious 
epoch in British &Baha'i history.  
     Though the prospect of this new venture is indeed enthralling, 
though it demands careful planning, the allocation of substantial sums 
for its prosecution, and the exertion of strenuous efforts for its 
systematic development, the prizes so laboriously won at home must 
under no circumstances be jeopardised.  The twofold obligation of 
preserving the status of the newly-fledged Assemblies in England, 
Wales, Scotland and Ireland and of propagating the Faith among the 
people dwelling in the British Isles through active teaching and the 
wide circulation of &Baha'i literature must be faithfully discharged.  
The necessary foundation for the proclamation of the Faith, at a later 
stage in the development of the British &Baha'i community, amidst the 
 
+P263 
British people and in the very heart of the British Empire must be 
carefully laid.  Whatever measures will facilitate the future recognition 
of the Faith by the civil authorities in the localities where its followers 
reside, and eventually by the central government in Westminster, 
must, within the means at their disposal, and however tentatively, be 
adopted.  
     Then and only then will this community, carrying out faithfully 
the twofold duty incumbent upon it, both at home and abroad, be 
vouchsafed by &Baha'u'llah the full measure of His grace which will 
enable it to traverse, speedily and successfully, the present stage in its 
evolution, and acquire still greater potentialities for the revelation of 
a still brighter aspect of its mission designed to illuminate with the 
light of Divine Guidance and in the course of the Formative and 
Golden Ages of the Faith all the Dependencies of the British Crown, 
and erect the administrative structure within these Territories, of an 
Order, incomparably mightier and more enduring than any which 
that Crown has ever established.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letter of August 27th has been received, and the beloved 
Guardian is sending you herein his receipt for the contribution 
of the British &Baha'is to the Shrine.  He noted with interest and 
appreciation that the Bank raised no objections to the transfer of 
this sum for such a purpose, and feels this indicates the slowly 
growing recognition of the Faith's nature and importance.  Your 
own ever devoted services to the Cause are greatly appreciated 
by him, you may be sure....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     I gratefully acknowledge the receipt of the sum of three hundred 
pounds from the &Baha'is of the British Isles, to be expended for the 
construction of the Shrine of the &Bab on Mt. Carmel.  
                                                            Shoghi 
 
16 October 1951 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters dated March 26th (two); April 4th (three), 11th, 
17th, 8th, 7th and 24th; May 1st, 4th, 12th and 24th; June 1st, 
 
+F1 To the Treasurer for this special fund--Arthur Norton+.  
 
+P268 
4th, 19th (two), 12th, 23rd and 27th; July 4th, 6th, 21st (two), 
25th and 31st; August 8th, 9th and 15th; September 15th, 18th 
and 19th; have all been received, as well as their enclosures, and 
the photographs sent and material under separate cover, and the 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     It will no doubt make you happy to hear that the Guardian 
has really had a little rest this summer, much needed after the 
tremendous strain of last year's worries and burdens.  He can now 
turn to his important N.S.A. letters somewhat refreshed.  
     To take up certain matters raised in your letters:  
     There are two Funds, that of the Shrine of the &Bab and the 
International Fund; but at present it is more important for the 
friends to concentrate on completing the work in progress on 
the Shrine, which, thanks to the response of the believers from 
all over the world, is going forward uninterruptedly, in spite of 
the very difficult situation in the Holy Land which makes all 
kinds of building work frightfully complicated.  
     The Guardian would very much like to receive five copies of 
every publication brought out in England for the &Baha'i libraries 
in Haifa and at &Bahji and in Acre.  He thanks you for the diaries 
you sent....  
     For your information the Guardian does not want any 
believers to migrate at present to this country.  It will not meet 
with his approval under any circumstances.  The local problems, 
with a small group of Covenant-Breakers more or less active in 
stirring up trouble; the efforts, at present successful, which he is 
making to establish the most cordial relations with the 
Government; the upbuilding of the international institutions of 
the Faith; the consolidation of the International &Baha'i Council--
all require that no complications arise and no further strain be 
added to the burden of work at the World Centre of the Faith.  
      Now we come to the part of your activities nearest to his heart 
at present--Africa Campaign.  By all means any translation at 
present into Somali should be given up, as the advice of experts 
prove it both unnecessary and very expensive.  
     The Guardian feels that, in view of the fact that funds for 
sending out pioneers are limited, and that a good number of 
pioneers are available, it is better to choose those most qualified 
and not, for the time being at least, accept every offer, however 
devoted the spirit behind it.  
 
+P269 
     He fully appreciates the fact that Somaliland is going to be 
somewhat difficult.  In view of its peculiar status your Assembly 
should bear in mind the possibility of sending there a British 
subject, if this should prove feasible, and pending a time when 
the Persians can go there and make arrangements for someone to 
represent them.  
     The Guardian considers that your Assembly is the consultative 
body for all African territories, and that the other National 
Assemblies should keep in close touch with you.  This does not 
mean, however, that the initiative for the places allotted to them 
by the Guardian does not lie in their own hands.  Likewise, the 
planning of the African Conference should be handled by you, 
in close co-operation with the other N.S.A.s.  He does not feel it 
is feasible for the other N.S.A.s to pool their finances for the 
African work and put it in your Fund.  
     The unfortunate crisis in Persia may hold up, for a time, their 
services in Africa, and he hopes you will do all you can to offset 
this most unfortunate setback to their work.  The Persian 
believers, have, for over a hundred years, borne the brunt of 
persecution and are still doing so, being the unhappy victims of 
their country and their race.  They merit the ardent sympathy 
of their fellow &Baha'is the world over.  
     The Guardian is very anxious to know how the work is going 
in the British Isles:  he feels that the Africa Campaign has been 
launched in a way far exceeding his hopes, is being visibly 
blessed from on high, and, with the same amount of perseverance 
shown so far, is assured of great and speedy victories.  But the 
goals, so hard won and at such cost of sacrifice at home, must not 
be lost.  He urges all the friends to not allow the dazzling prospect 
overseas to take their attention away from the steady work of 
consolidation still required at home!  The work abroad rests on 
the foundation laid so well and so painfully at home; if one 
suffers, so will the other.  
     The British &Baha'is have distinguished themselves in recent 
years to a degree which has given them great prominence in the 
entire &Baha'i World and inspired others to follow their example.  
They cannot and must not lose this hard-won prominence, but, 
on the contrary, must demonstrate that it was not a spurt of 
speed but the evidence of deep and hardy roots bearing their first 
fruits, after years of quiet growth.  
 
+P270 
     He remembers all the members of your Assembly in his 
prayers, and prays that the community of believers you serve so 
devotedly may go on rising to ever greater heights and shoulder 
all their tasks with increasing vigour, faith and devotion....  
     P.S.  Regarding the forthcoming Centenary celebrations: the 
Guardian feels both national and local celebrations should be 
held very much as were those of the 1944 Centenary, but on a 
larger scale, with more publicity, if possible.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The auspicious launching of the first teaching Crusade undertaken 
by the British &Baha'i community beyond the borders of its homeland, 
marks yet another stage in the evolution of the &Baha'i Administrative 
Order in the British Isles, and signalises the opening of an epoch of the 
utmost significance in the Formative Age of the &Baha'i Dispensation.  
Though the operation of the Plan is of short duration, yet it constitutes 
a prelude to a series of successive campaigns which a firmly knit, 
vigorously functioning, clear visioned, intensely alive national 
community is destined to initiate, direct and control from its newly 
consolidated administrative headquarters in the heart of the British 
Isles, not only throughout the Dependencies of the British Crown 
within the African Continent, but eventually in the widely scattered 
Territories of an Empire whose ramifications extend into every 
continent of the globe.  
     A little over half-a-century ago, this community, now invested with 
a mandate of the utmost significance both at home and overseas, was 
called into being in the course of the opening years of the third and last 
epoch of the Heroic Age of the Faith.  A decade later, the Appointed 
Centre of a Covenant, through the creative and potent energies of 
which so important a member of a steadily rising world community 
was conceived and nurtured, chose to infuse into that infant community 
through the impact of His personality in the course of a twice repeated 
visit to the heart and centre of that Empire, a measure of His own 
mysterious power, which, as He Himself prophesied, was destined to 
unfold its potentialities in the course of a later age.  On the morrow of 
His passing, the earliest evidences of the unfailing promise He had 
made revealed themselves through the first stirrings of an Administrative 
Order--the Child of the Covenant, the Shield of that community 
and the divinely appointed Agency for the execution of the mandate 
with which that community was to be invested in the second epoch of 
 
+P271 
the Formative Age of the &Baha'i Dispensation.  A little over two 
decades later, that community, armed and equipped with the mighty, 
divinely conceived agencies of a laboriously erected, unassailably 
established Administrative Order, embarked upon a six-year enterprise 
that culminated in the erection of the institutions of that Order in the 
very heart and capital cities of its island home--the essential prerequisite 
for the inauguration of yet another stage in its unfoldment.  
On the morrow of the triumphant termination of the first collective 
enterprise launched by that community in British &Baha'i history, its 
jubilant members braced themselves, during a one-year interval, for the 
initial onslaught, which they were preparing to launch, unitedly and 
determinedly, far beyond the shores of their homeland amid alien, 
widely diversified, politically restless, economically backward, spiritually 
famished tribes and peoples, and in the course of one of the most 
critical periods in human history.  On the morrow of the centenary of 
the martyrdom of the Prophet Herald of its Faith, this same community 
had already formulated its plans, initiated its programme of publications 
in various African languages, despatched its first pioneer to the heart 
of that continent, forged the necessary links with its allied sister 
communities participating in various enterprises in that same 
continent, and established its first essential contact with divers 
government agencies capable of giving their advice and assistance in 
the prosecution of its historic and arduous task.  
     This community, so young in experience, so richly endowed by 
the love and care of a departed all-powerful Master, so firmly 
entrenched in the stronghold of its Administrative Order, already so 
rich in prizes won in the course of the first collective enterprise 
undertaken in its history, so promising in the vigour, the zeal and 
devotion which it is now displaying, is faced, at the present hour, with 
a grave, a sacred and inescapable responsibility--a responsibility that 
will increase as the brief eighteen-month interval separating it from 
the termination of its Two Year Plan speeds to a close.  
     Upon the discharge of this weighty responsibility now resting upon 
it must depend the inauguration of yet another Plan, of longer 
duration, of greater scope, of a still more challenging character, and of 
greater consequence in the effect it must have on that community's 
destiny.  
     Time is running short.  The present hour in the fortunes of mankind 
is critical.  The centenary of the birth of the Revelation of &Baha'u'llah 
is fast approaching.  The British &Baha'i community must gird up its 
 
+P272 
loins, redouble its exertions, undertake further sacrifices, demonstrate 
greater solidarity and rise to still greater heights of consecrated 
devotion.  
     The flow of pioneers to the African Continent must be noticeably 
accelerated.  The provision of &Baha'i literature in all the selected 
African languages must be speeded up.  The ties binding the community 
with its cooperating sister communities must be steadily reinforced.  
The prizes already garnered as a result of the operation of the Six-Year 
Plan in England, Wales, Scotland, Eire and Northern Ireland, 
must, at all costs, be safeguarded.  The preparations for the forthcoming 
first African Teaching Conference must be carefully planned and
meticulously carried out.  Above all, the zeal kindled in the breasts of 
administrators, pioneers, teachers and supporters, jointly contributing 
to the success of this meritorious enterprise, must burn ever more 
brightly and be reflected in still more remarkable exploits.  
     Then, and only then, will this community be enabled to contribute 
its share of tribute to the memory of the Founder of its Faith, on the 
occasion of the centenary of the birth of His Prophetic Mission, in as 
befitting a manner as the share it already contributed, through the 
consummation of its first historic Plan, to the world-wide celebrations 
which commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the founding of its 
Faith.  Then, and only then, will it be qualified to embark upon yet 
another Crusade, whose scope will transcend the limits of the vast 
African Continent, and the culmination of which might well coincide 
with the Most Great Jubilee that will commemorate the centenary of 
the formal assumption by &Baha'u'llah of His prophetic office, a jubilee 
envisaged by &Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets, and prophesied more than 
two thousand years ago, by Daniel in His Book.  
     So glorious a vision, now unfolded before the eyes of the British 
followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, cannot but galvanise them into 
action, at once swift, resolute and unrelaxing, and fire their souls with 
a spirit so consuming as to melt every obstacle that may intervene 
between them and the achievement of their present goal.  
     May they, one and all, prove themselves, in the crucial months 
immediately ahead, worthy of the blessings vouchsafed to them in the 
past, and of the high destiny which it lies in their power to achieve in 
the future.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     As I just recently sent you a long letter on behalf of the 
beloved Guardian to which he appended at some length, he 
wishes you to consider this reply to your letters of October 17th 
(three in number) as a postscript to the other.  
     As regards the questions you raised:  
     The ideal thing would be to have at least one &Baha'i from 
every territory in Africa attend the African Conference.  This is 
the goal to be worked for, and attained if possible, as it will 
greatly stimulate the work and especially the inexperienced and 
isolated believers.  
     The solar calendar should, by all means, be adhered to in 
Africa.  
     He feels that your Assembly is responsible for the time being 
for the work in territories not under the charge of other N.S.A.s 
(Tunis, Sudan and Ethiopia are under Egyptian care).  
     You are not directly responsible for any work done in 
territories which have been allotted to other N.S.A.s.  But you 
should correspond with them, and give them any help and 
advice you can, both the N.S.A.s and their African Committees.  
In the case of Eric Manton+, though he will be under Persia's 
jurisdiction you can keep him informed of your work, so as to 
cheer him up.  
     Only the five participating National Assemblies are responsible 
directly for financing the African work.  No invitations should 
be extended to other bodies or individuals to contribute.  
Naturally if any one wants to, they no doubt will, but it would 
be, he feels, very inappropriate to broadcast any appeal.  The 
Africa work is not an international undertaking but an interassembly 
one, confined to five national Bodies.

     He is very pleased over the way the work is progressing, and

Africa Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letters of November 5th and 22nd (enclosures were also 
received) have been received, and the beloved Guardian has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was pleased to hear that Sir Ronald Storrs keeps up a 
friendly interest in the Faith.  
     Regarding ... it is obvious that people like this, who have had 
in some cases a smattering of &Baha'i teaching are not fully aware 
of the implications of the Faith.  However, this does not mean 
that we should not help them and hold on to them, in the hope 
of being able, as time and circumstances permit, to deepen them 
and produce from them really fine believers.  This has happened 
on many occasions in the past, and the Guardian hopes that, 
through correspondence with him, your committee--and 
perhaps the Groups in Africa--will be able to accomplish this.  
     In response to his requests for money, you should point out to 
him that as we finance entirely our own activities as our gift to 
mankind, we have to harbour our resources and concentrate on 
the most important expenditures.  You will know what these 
are; and they certainly don't include a headquarters in Nigeria.  
You might also encourage him to make an effort to attend the 
Africa Conference.  
 
+F1 Regarding the first Intercontinental Conference.  
 
+P275 
     The Guardian also hopes that you will give ... every 
encouragement.  She is a fine soul, and no doubt, if she had time 
devoted to her, would soon develop into an assured and active 
believer.  You should encourage her also to make every effort to 
be present at the Africa Conference, and in the meantime to 
correspond with believers abroad, and do her best to teach the 
Cause there in spite of her handicaps.  
     The Guardian feels that the next step in &Baha'i literature might 
well be the publication of a more comprehensive work in 
Luganda and Swahili.  However, he would like the Africa 
Committee to undertake pamphlets in other languages as well; 
let him know what languages the committee proposes.  
     He attaches, as you know, the greatest importance to the work 
of your committee and is tremendously impressed by the 
progress being made in Africa, and by the capacity, tenacity and 
enthusiasm the British Africa Committee is showing in handling 
its share of this extremely important campaign.  His prayers are 
frequently offered on your behalf.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty whose Cause you serve with such devotion, 
ability and faithfulness, reward you abundantly for your labours, 
guide you and sustain you and assist you to enrich continually the 
record of your meritorious service.  
                                  Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you the 
following:  
     He wishes the British National Assembly to please do all they 
can to watch over the two young sons of our dear friends, Mr. 
and Mrs. ..., in view of the fact that the youngest boy is little 
more than a child, he needs particularly to have his spiritual 
welfare safeguarded through as much contact as possible with 
believers.  
     The wonderful services this devoted and self-sacrificing father 
and mother are rendering the Faith have forced them to be 
separated from their children, and hence the Guardian requests 
your Assembly to please take special care of the boys.  
     We are all very happy to have ... here, and they have brought 
most heartening reports of the progress of the work in Africa

Africa Committee of the National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of the 18th of February, with enclosures, has 
reached the beloved Guardian; and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     He is very pleased over the progress being made, particularly 
in Uganda; and the recent pilgrimage of the dear &Bananis, he 
feels sure, will add a great impetus to the work there.  
     Regarding the matters of policy you raised in your letter, he 
sees no objection to the Persian &Baha'is,--as long as there are so 
many of them, and it is unwise to concentrate too many 
applicants on one country at one time as you point out,--going 
to countries under the jurisdiction of other National Spiritual 
Assemblies, such as Egypt and India.  
     He considers that it is of the greatest importance that pioneers 
should have upright characters, as well as some considerable 
knowledge of the Teachings.  We cannot expect that every 
pioneer will be a person of importance; but we must hope that 
each one will be a person of worth, in his own character.  This 
should be pointed out to the Indian friends.

     India should likewise make an effort to send pioneers primarily 
to the territories embraced in its own part of the Plan; but if they 
can make available to your committee for British territory, 
some qualified Indian &Baha'is, who for some reason cannot go to 
one of the Indian National Assembly's assignments, then there is 
no objection.  
     The Guardian thinks that it is wise not to influence ... by 
sending him material which he does not at present wish to 
receive.  He is, judging from his letter, a sincere but immature 
believer....  
     P.S.  Your National Assembly is not responsible for Eritrea but 
you may encourage any believers there.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your high endeavours, guide and sustain 
you continually, and aid you to win great victories in the service of 
His Faith.

National &Baha'i Youth Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of April 9, 1952, has been received, and the 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was most happy to see that so many of the &Baha'i youth 
and their friends had gathered together for the Youth 
Conference; and trusts that, from this consultation, a greater 
activity amongst the &Baha'i youth of the British Isles will result.  
     All over the &Baha'i world, we see that not an inconsiderable 
proportion of the most active and devoted pioneers are young

people.  This is only right and proper, because they are freer, 
usually, to migrate to distant lands, embark on new projects, and

     He will pray for all of you, for your success and the deepening 
of your capacities in the service of &Baha'u'llah.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless and sustain you in your meritorious 
activities and aid you to achieve great victories in the service of His

Africa Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of May 16th has been received, and the beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He has read with great interest the reports which your 
committee sends him regularly, because as you know the work 
in Africa is to him one of the most important activities going on 
in the &Baha'i world, and very close to his heart.  
 
+P281 
     He was very sorry to hear from the recent cable sent him that 
there is a question about the Kampala Conference, and whether 
arrangements can be made for it to be held there.  Undoubtedly 
there is an increasingly negative attitude toward our work 
growing up amongst the officials, probably due to the lack of 
racial discrimination they are coming to realise is one of our 
fundamental teachings, a teaching carried into action, and not 
merely a pious hope....  He wishes you to keep him informed 
about this and the progress being made.  
     Your suggested souvenir booklet sounds interesting, and he 
urges you to consider the wisdom of including a photograph of 
Mr. Gregory, First Negro Hand of the Cause, in addition to the 
others.  
     As regards the latest progress photo of the Shrine Mr. Ted 
Cardell+ took a great many pictures here, which the Guardian 
told him he could share with the &Baha'is anywhere in the world; 
and it seems as if, exclusive of the work on the drum, which will 
begin showing distinctly in about two months' time, the best 
possible photograph you can obtain of the Shrine at present 
would be one of Ted's.  You should therefore apply to him for 
one.  
     The Guardian is very anxious that, during the coming months, 
the Africa Committee and the &Baha'is should concentrate their 
efforts on establishing an Assembly in Kenya, and hopes that you 
will be able to direct pioneers to Nairobi as soon as possible.  
     The Guardian considers that it is premature at this time to 
answer your question about consultation at the Africa Conference, 
between people from territories which will come under 
the jurisdiction of the East and Central Africa National Spiritual 
Assembly.  He is so overworked and tired at the moment that he 
has not been able to go into the entire question of the Inter-Continental 
Conferences, the countries which will come under 
the jurisdiction of various future national bodies, etc.  He hopes 
that he will be able, during the coming months, to do this, and 
if he feels it wise, will advise you by cable concerning a 
consultation such as you suggest, at the Conference.  
     He assures all the members of your committee of his deep 
appreciation of the work they are doing, and of his loving 
prayers for their success....  
     P.S.  Your personal letter of May 17th was received, and he 
 
+P282 
assures you not only of how deeply he admires the spirit you and 
your husband have, and the work you accomplish, but of his 
loving prayers that you may be given strength to carry out this 
work.  
     Mr. ... evidently is very immature and has no real concept of 
the Faith; this does not mean, however, that we should abandon 
him as a contact or let him become the prey of the New History 
Society.  We should keep in friendly touch until someone can see 
him.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty Whose Cause you and your co-workers are 
serving with such an exemplary spirit of devotion, fidelity and 
perseverance, reward you for your meritorious labours, remove all 
obstacles from your path and enable you to win great victories in the 
days to come, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
12 June 1952 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letters of October 3, 
October 27 (4), November 5, 9, 22 (2), 24 and 29, December 6, 
19 (4) and 21, 1951, and January 1, 2, 7, 11, 16, 17, 20 and 29 
(3), February 1, 16, 20 (3), 27 (2) and February 29, March 5 and 
14, April 3, 15 and 24, May 5, 13, 19 (2), 27 and 31, and June 
6th, 10th and June 12, 1952, and he has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  He also has received the various enclosures 
which you sent with these letters....  
     The book you sent from the friends in Bahrein was received, 
and pleased the beloved Guardian very much, as the lines are 
written in the handwriting of &Baha'u'llah at the beginning of the 
book.  (This answers your question in your letter of June 6th.)  
     It brought great joy to his heart to see that you were able to 
maintain all assemblies in spite of the heavy odds against you.  It 
demonstrates to him once more the tenacity and devotion of the 
British &Baha'is, which is rapidly becoming one of the great assets 
of the Faith in its process of international expansion....  
     The wonderful spirit shown by Dr. &Afnan and his wife is 
 
+P283 
certainly an example to all pioneers.  He hopes that Mrs. &Afnan 
will settle herself successfully in Africa, and soon be able to have 
her husband join her.  
     He was very happy to hear that the Teaching Conference has 
been so successful.  Undoubtedly the dedication of the friends to 
their tasks at that time facilitated the achievement of their goals 
in April....  
     The Guardian would like to assure your Assembly of his 
loving prayers for dear Mr. Sam Scott, who pioneered at such a 
ripe age, and who is surely receiving his reward in the &Abha 
Kingdom.+F1  
     He considers it advisable that all believers living in Africa, 
even those who did so before the beginning of the Plan, should 
have some form of credentials....  
     Your suggestion of inaugurating the Holy Year next &Ridvan 
and continuing on until October, 1953, with celebrations, meets 
with his approval.  
     As regards the Africa campaign:  this enterprise, so enthusiastically 
carried on, has been throughout this past year the greatest 
source of joy to the heart of the beloved Guardian.  The visits of 
the dear &Bananis and Ted Cardell, the news they brought and the 
general progress of the work, have made Africa seem right next 
door to Haifa!  The formation of the Dar-es-Salaam and Kampala 
Assemblies was also a great satisfaction to him.  
     He urges you to now concentrate on an Assembly for Nairobi 
by next April.  This should not be too difficult of achievement in 
view of the devoted efforts of Mr. Cardell and the pioneers eager 
to go there.  
     As regards your question about Somaliland:  any one of the 
three Somalilands may be chosen as a goal territory.  
     In this connection, he feels that Persian pioneers should be 
accepted for any and all territories; they are arising in large 
numbers to offer their services, and it is a great pity that these 
dedicated and eager friends are so restricted as regards settlement.  
Your Assembly should do all in its power to facilitate placing 
them.  
     The Guardian feels that although the Conference planned for 
Kampala is primarily a Conference and in no sense a Convention 
 
+F1 From Leeds to Norwich at age 84 and died at age 86.  
 
+P284 
(having no delegates), there is no objection to the representatives 
of various N.S.A.s who may attend meeting in separate sessions 
for more special and concentrated consultation.  Any Hands of 
the Cause attending could also be included in this private 
discussion.  
     He feels that now more than ever the British friends have 
every reason to feel proud of their accomplishments and happy 
over the very evident bestowals from the Throne on High.  They 
have found, after half a century of development, scope for their 
abilities, and a field large enough to distinguish themselves in, 
and they are certainly taking advantage of it, much to the delight 
of the Guardian and their &fellow-Baha'is.  
     You may be sure that he remembers you all in his prayers, and 
also the body of the faithful believers you serve to such good 
purpose.  
     He would like you to please thank, on his behalf, the friends 
who so devotedly contribute to the construction of the Holy 
Shrine....  
     P.S.  As regards &Baha'i divorce as mentioned in your letters of 
June 12th:  &Baha'is (whether one party or both are believers) 
should follow the &Baha'i law of divorce, i.e. one year of waiting, 
and not neglect this divinely given law.  Whether they were 
&Baha'is when they married or not has nothing to do with it.  
     In connection with the budget, mentioned in your letter of 
June 10th, he feels, in the future, you should not set a budget 
which the resources of the community are unable to meet; 
however, owing to the crucial Africa work and the forthcoming 
Conference, he realises you had at this time no other choice.  He 
is going to arrange for one thousand pounds to be sent to your 
Assembly in order to meet the needs of the Conference and the 
literature in African languages still to be published.  The 
remaining translations should be pressed forward in order to be 
ready for the Conference next year.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The Two Year Plan on which the British &Baha'i community has 
embarked bids fair, as it approaches its conclusion, to eclipse, however 
short its duration, the exploits of that community throughout the 
length and breadth of the British Isles, in the course of the prosecution 
of the first collective enterprise undertaken in British &Baha'i history.  
 
+P285 
This second historic undertaking marks the inauguration of the 
Mission entrusted to this community for the purpose of diffusing the 
Message of &Baha'u'llah and of implanting its banner through successive 
stages, and in collaboration with its sister communities, not only in the 
territories of the British Crown in the African Continent, but 
throughout the dependencies of a widely scattered Empire in the 
remaining continents of the globe.  It may well be regarded as a 
befitting prelude to the official participation of this community in the 
Ten Year, world-encircling Crusade, designed to signalise the 
celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's 
Mission, involving the systematic co-operation of no less than twelve 
National Assemblies throughout the &Baha'i world, and destined to 
culminate in the Most Great Jubilee that will, God willing, witness 
the introduction of the Faith into all the Sovereign States, the Chief 
Dependencies and Islands of the entire planet.  
     In the conduct of this world-encompassing task, so vast in scope, so 
thrilling in its possibilities, so formidable in its potentialities, the 
British &Baha'i community will be called upon to play a preponderating 
&role, in conjunction with the American &Baha'i community, acting as 
the Chief Custodians of &Abdu'l-Baha's Master Plan, and seconded by 
its sister communities in the British Dominions in both hemispheres, 
in awakening the peoples, races and nations comprising the British 
Commonwealth and Empire to the redemptive Message of &Baha'u'llah, 
and in establishing, on an unassailable foundation, the structural basis 
of His World Order.  
     The diversity of functions which the assumption of this task will 
involve; the privileges and bounties it will, of a certainty, confer on its 
prosecutors; the degree of dedication, the amount of preparation it will 
require for its proper discharge; the severe strain it must necessarily 
impose on all those who will shoulder its burdens; the gravity of the 
manifold problems it will raise; the severe challenge with which they 
who will arise to carry it out will be confronted--as witnessed by the 
delicate and complicated situation that has already arisen in the initial 
stage of this historic Mission in the heart of Africa, in connection with 
the holding of the projected inter-continental conference--all these 
must be carefully pondered in preparation for the launching, at its 
appointed time, of an undertaking that will constitute, not only a 
milestone of the utmost significance in the history of the Faith in the 
British Isles, but will also be hailed by posterity as a landmark of 
peculiar significance in British history.  
 
+P286 
     Whilst the small band of wholly dedicated, patiently labouring, 
much admired, greatly promising followers and supporters of the Faith, 
in England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, contemplate, from their 
respective homelands, the grandeur of their future task, dwell on its 
sacred character, and meditate on the wide range of its problems, 
possibilities, perils and glories, let them devote particular and sustained 
attention to the imperative needs, the urgent requirements of their no 
less important and vital mission at home, in their boroughs and 
counties, amidst their own people, and strain every nerve to reinforce, 
through a rapid increase in their numbers, through a steady 
multiplication of their administrative institutions, through a systematic 
consolidation of the structure of the edifice they are raising within the 
borders of their native land, their respective communities, which must 
be regarded as the base for the future operations that will be conducted 
by the members of these communities, under the guidance of their 
elected representatives, for the spiritual conquest and the ultimate 
redemption of the nations, tribes and races owing allegiance to the 
British Crown.  
     With every forward step taken by this stalwart community in the 
path of service to the Cause of &Baha'u'llah, with every signal victory 
achieved for the promulgation of His Faith, a new revelation of the 
glorious Mission which this community is privileged to undertake is 
unfolded before the eyes of its members and a wider vista of the future 
range of its operations, both at home and overseas, opens before it.  
With every complication that arises in the course of its unfolding 
Mission, with even every seeming reverse it meets with, as its destiny 
unfolds, a clearer understanding of the character of its stewardship to 
the Faith of &Baha'u'llah is vouchsafed to its members, a greater measure 
of His sustaining grace is poured forth from on high, a more compelling 
evidence of His all-conquering power is evinced, and a more majestic 
assertion of His mysterious purpose is demonstrated.  
     The potent seeds a loving and vigilant Master sowed with His 
Own hands, in the course of a twice repeated visit to the homeland of 
this community, are now, after having lain dormant for almost a 
quarter of a century, at long last, sprouting throughout the length and 
breadth of the British Isles, and are even revealing the potency of their 
regenerative power, through the instrumentality of those valiant 
pioneers, who, faithful to His Call and dedicated to His service, are 
leaving the shores of those islands to settle in the territories of a far-away
and backward continent.  Amidst their arduous labours, in their 
 
+P287 
contact with the heterogeneous tribes and races dwelling in that 
continent, in their dealings with the civil authorities of divers countries 
and states within whose jurisdiction they will labour, in their struggle 
with an inhospitable climate, in the hazards to which they will be 
inevitably exposed, in the adventures they may experience, in the 
reverses they may temporarily suffer, in the opposition they will meet 
with, in the tests and trials they will undergo, His unfailing guidance 
will be vouchsafed to them in direct proportion to the degree of their 
consecration to their task, and the perseverance, the courage and fidelity 
they will display as they discharge their duties.  
     The remarkable success that has attended their high endeavours 
since the initiation of their first collective enterprise within the confines 
of their native land, the still more notable evidence of God's sustaining 
grace that has accompanied the opening of the first stage of their 
Mission overseas, are sufficient proof of the tremendous potency of the 
forces at work for the purpose of ensuring the unrestricted expansion 
of their future activities within and beyond the frontiers of their island 
home, and the ultimate consummation of their magnificent enterprise.  
     In the months immediately ahead, the strongholds of the Faith 
erected, in the form of local assemblies, and already established in 
Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, must be maintained at all costs 
in their present strength; the groups and isolated centres already 
brought into being must, under no circumstances, be allowed to decrease 
in number or be lost to the Faith; the translation and publication of 
pamphlets in the languages already selected must be vigorously pushed 
forward and completed; the centre in the capital of Kenya must be 
assiduously expanded; the preparations for the projected inter-continental 
Conference must be carefully carried out; the effective 
participation of the representatives of the British &Baha'i community in 
the Stockholm inter-continental Conference must be ensured; and all 
the preparatory steps, required for the effectual collaboration of the 
members of this community in the global crusade, destined to be 
launched on the morrow of the world-wide celebrations of the 
approaching Holy Year, should, to whatever extent possible, be 
undertaken.  
     There is no time to lose.  The issues at stake call for immediate 
action, demand unrelaxing vigilance, undivided attention, and a 
consecration unexampled in the annals of the Faith in the British 
Isles.  Though the number of those summoned to shoulder so immense 
a task be dishearteningly small, though the resources at their disposal 
 
+P288 
be meagre, though the cares and preoccupations of the peoples amidst 
whom they live are such as to often blind them to the Faith and its 
healing message, yet the position they occupy and the responsibilities 
devolving upon them in the heart and centre of a world-wide empire, 
the manifold tokens of esteem and loving-kindness showered upon 
them during the infancy of this community by the Centre of God's 
Covenant; the inherent qualities of tenacity of purpose, of exemplary 
fidelity, of perspicacity that distinguishes the race to which they belong, 
must inspire hope and confidence in their future, and fully entitles 
them to play a leading role in the future proclamation of the Message 
of &Baha'u'llah to the multitudes that live beneath the shadow of the 
British Crown.  
     That they may become increasingly conscious of the sublimity of 
their task; that they may address themselves to it with their 
characteristic zeal, ability, intelligence and fervour; that they may 
speedily acquire the spiritual potentialities for the initiation of a still 
more momentous stage in the unfoldment of their historic Mission; 
that they may earn increasingly, through their superb feats, the 
unqualified admiration of their brethren in every continent of the globe 
and prove themselves worthy of the bounties already received and those 
which, we may well believe, are held in store for them, is my cherished 
hope and constant prayer.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you in his 
behalf, to request that information relating to the British Isles 
and their activities, contained in the booklet "The &Baha'i Faith" 
 
+F1 On 9 January 1951 the Guardian announced the formation of the first 
+F1 International &Baha'i Council, hailing it as "the greatest event shedding 
+F1 lustre upon second epoch of Formative Age..." and on 8 March 1952 he 
+F1 enlarged it and named its eight members.  Hand of the Cause Leroy Ioas was 
+F1 appointed Secretary General and as such wrote frequently to the British 
+F1 National Spiritual Assembly.  He wrote more frequently, however, conveying 
+F1 messages from the Guardian, requesting information, sharing news, etc., 
+F1 signing his letters "Assistant Secretary".  This was the first letter of 
+F1 this kind.  His letters are now included wherever he indicates that he is 
+F1 writing on behalf of the Guardian.  
 
+P289 
`Information Statistical and Comparative' be brought up to date 
as of May 1 1952, and sent to him here by the first possible air 
mail post.  
     One of the features of the Holy Year will be the re-issuance of 
this important book; inasmuch as the Holy Year is fast 
approaching the Guardian wishes the information as quickly as 
possible.  
     Briefly, the information which your N.S.A. is to provide, 
brought up to date of May 1, 1952, is as follows:  
     Incorporated local spiritual assemblies in the British Isles.  
     &Baha'i Centres in the British Isles, showing, if possible, the 
division between local spiritual assemblies, Groups and Isolated 
Believers.  
     Any information not immediately available should be handled 
by telegraph, but such information as is available should not be 
delayed for any one or two delinquents.  You can appreciate that

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Enclosed please find the Guardian's Convention Message.  
     As there are a great many African languages enumerated, and 
the spelling is very involved, the Guardian has decided to Air 
Mail you this message, rather than have it cabled, which was his 
original intention.  
     Please cable immediately you receive this letter, acknowledging 
it, so that the Guardian will know his Convention Message 
is in your hands.  Otherwise he will of course have to cable it 
from here.  
     He is eagerly awaiting the report of the African Conference, 
which he has not received to date....  
     P.S.  Your letter regarding a rug supposedly owned by 
&Baha'u'llah coming up for sale, has just been received, and the 
Guardian feels that he cannot possibly authenticate this rug as 
having belonged at any time to &Baha'u'llah.  It may of course be 
quite true that it did.  He leaves it to the discretion of your 
Assembly to decide whether you wish to purchase it or not.

Africa Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letters of June 27, August 4, August 18, September 19, 
October 9 and November 27, 1952, with enclosures, have been 
received, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     Your letter of May 25th has also been received.  He of course 
meant French Equatorial Africa, but condensed it for the sake of 
the cable.  The Belgian Congo is naturally separate.  
     As many of your questions and reports dealt with pre-Conference 
complications, which, thanks to the grace of 
&Baha'u'llah, were all satisfactorily removed, I will not touch 
upon them in this letter.  
     The Guardian was immensely pleased and relieved when it 
became clear that the &Baha'is had obtained visas for Uganda, and 
were attending in large numbers, and that hotel accommodation 
was available.  
     From the report he has received from Mr. Ioas and pilgrims, 
the Conference was undoubtedly a tremendous success, and 
befittingly inaugurated the round of celebrations during this 
Holy Year.  
     It is a great pity that there should have been so much 
unfavourable publicity connected with the public meeting 
associated with the Conference, and its attendance.  One cannot, 
however, help but feel that such an attitude was inevitable sooner 
or later, because there is no doubt that the missionaries are 
beginning to feel the keenest resentment and a certain degree of 
alarm, due to the success of our teaching methods in Africa.  
 
+P301 
     Your committee will no doubt face, in the days to come, 
many grave problems; but the Guardian feels sure that, whatever 
happens, and whatever attacks are made upon the Faith and its 
pioneers, the net result cannot but be good for us in the long run, 
and can only serve to hasten the spread of the Cause.  
     He feels that your committee has every right to feel immensely 
proud, and grateful to God, for the success of your unremitting 
labours over such a long period of time.  
     He was most happy to hear that Mr. Dudley Smith Kutendele 
is planning to go and teach the Faith in Nyasaland, and will pray 
that his efforts may meet with success in the end.  
     Your understanding of the treatment of polygamist converts 
to the Faith is quite correct, but of course if anyone who is a 
&Baha'i wishes to marry more than one wife, he cannot do so.  If 
they should disobey this law, then the cases must be handled in 
the same way as the Persians do, which is that these persons who 
become polygamists, break the laws of marriage.  
     As regards your question about the proper designation for the 
huts which will be used by the believers in villages, as &Baha'i 
Centres, he thinks that, for the time being, until a more dignified 
structure can be erected, they should be called "&Baha'i Centre", 
and not &Haziratu'l-Quds--the correct name is &Haziratu'l-Quds 
and not &Hazira.  
     He was immensely pleased over the example shown by Enos 
Epyeru, in withdrawing from political affiliation, and feels that 
some of the African friends are showing a most exemplary spirit 
of devotion and loyalty.  He feels that a great potential strength 
lies in these new African believers.  
     No doubt your committee will be faced with problems, due 
to the inexperience of some of these people in administrative 
matters, but, through loving guidance, and the wisdom of those 
who are associated with them on the spot, these minor things can 
be satisfactorily taken care of, and the main thing, the 
establishment of assemblies and groups, be carried out 
successfully.  
     The Guardian was indeed delighted over &Ali &Nakhjavani's 
trip to the Teso district.  The purity of his spirit, the intensity of 
his devotion, and the longing in his heart to bring the Faith to his 
African brothers, all of which he so clearly showed forth in his 
actions, were no doubt the great factors which enkindled the 
 
+P302 
first fires in the hearts of the believers in that land, and which 
have spread so swiftly and have been the cause of such joy to our 
beloved Guardian.  
     The Guardian considers that the settling of all the virgin 
territories all over the world is the most important of the goals 
given to any of the National Assemblies, and that it should be 
given precedence.  Indeed, he is hoping that the one hundred and 
thirty territories still unopened may all be settled by pioneers 
this year, if possible.  
     It is not necessary for a National Assembly to confine itself to 
the placing of pioneers from its own community in its goal 
areas--it may draw on other &Baha'i communities for pioneers 
for its goal territories, as well, and vice versa.  In other words, 
pioneers from the British Isles may be sent to territories under 
the administrative jurisdiction of other National Bodies than the 
British National Assembly, and pioneers may be accepted for 
British posts who are not members of the British community.  
The important thing is to achieve the goals.  
     The Guardian is urging the bodies associated with the work 
in Africa to disperse their forces, and not endeavour to build up 
large communities.  Otherwise, there will be a large number of 
pioneers in one place, while other goal countries may be left 
entirely without a pioneer.  
     As regards the translations for Africa, he has urged the 
American National Spiritual Assembly, in connection with the 
printing of &Baha'i literature in the languages allotted to that 
continent, to give you any help it can.  
     The Guardian feels confident that, by proper concentration of 
effort and exchange of information between the committees 
responsible for getting the pioneers out to Africa, the ways and 
means will be forthcoming to achieve our objectives this year.  
     You may rest assured that his prayers will continue to be 
offered for the work you are performing, and that he most 
deeply appreciates the conscientious and tireless devotion of all 
the members of your committee, a devotion which has enabled 
the Conference to take place with such success.  
                                    With loving &Baha'i greetings....  
 
     P.S.  In reading over this letter, I see that I have not done 
justice to the deep feeling of appreciation our beloved Guardian 
 
+P303 
has for the wonderful spirit shown by Mr. &Banani and his wife, 
as well as by Philip Hainsworth and Mr. and Mrs. Collison.  The 
services of all of those friends cannot be overestimated, nor those 
of the devoted pioneers in Kenya and Tanganyika.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, sustain and guide you in your highly 
meritorious endeavours, remove all obstacles from your path, and 
enable you to lend a great impetus to the historic work being achieved 
in the African Continent.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi 
 
5 June 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Our Beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by reports 
reaching him from all parts of the &Baha'i World, of victories, 
already gained, and plans being laid for the prosecution of the 
Ten Year Crusade.  He was particularly pleased to learn that 
some 150 people have offered to pioneer in virgin overseas areas 
at the American Convention.  
     These reports have evoked his awe-inspiring and soul-stirring 
cablegram of May 28th+F1, calling for the immediate settlement 
of all the 131 virgin areas of the Plan, just as quickly as possible.  
He is convinced the Friends will arise and translate their 
enthusiasm into Action, because the Keynote of the Crusade, 
must be Action, Action, Action.  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your 
Assembly to amplify some of the aspects of his dynamic message.  
     The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an emergency 
nature, that he feels pioneering in one of them takes precedence 
over every other type of &Baha'i service--whether it be in the 
teaching or administrative fields of the Faith.  So important is it 
that the National Assembly may delay initiation of steps to fulfil 
other phases of the Plan, until all these areas are conquered for 
the Faith.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, must be allowed to 
interfere with the placing of pioneers in each of the 131 goal 
countries.  
 
+F1 Announcing "Roll of Honour" for "Knights of &Baha'u'llah" published in 
+F1 "Messages to the &Baha'i World, 1950-1957", p. 48.  
 
+P304 
     There are some general observations which the Guardian 
shares with you, and then some specific suggestions which are 
enumerated below:  
     1.  Every individual who has offered to pioneer, must be 
encouraged in every way by the National Assembly.  
     2.  The National Assembly should assist each pioneer, so they 
may be placed in their post just as quickly as possible.  
     3.  The handling of each application for pioneering service 
must be expedited, and not allowed to be bogged down for any 
reason, or in the hands of committees.  
     4.  The National Assembly should make it their first order of 
business to follow up actively this most important task.  They 
must make it the first order of business at each Assembly meeting 
to see that each application is being progressed rapidly.  This does 
not mean the special committees should not handle the details, 
but it does mean the Assembly itself must review each application 
at each meeting and see that the pioneer gets into the field as soon 
as possible.  
     5.  A large number of pioneers should not be sent to any one 
country.  One, or even two, will be sufficient for the time being.  
Later on, if supplementary assistance is needed, that of course can 
be taken care of.  The all important thing now is to get at least 
one pioneer in each of the 131 virgin areas.  
     6.  The National Assembly may exercise its prerogatives and 
suggest to applicants where their services are most needed.  This, 
of course, applies particularly to pioneers who might wish to 
settle in one area.  
     7.  Because there have been so many applicants in America, 
the Guardian has written them that they may place their pioneers 
in any virgin area in the world.  His objective now is to fill these 
lands yet unconquered by the Hosts of Heaven and he feels the 
initial impact must be made now.  Thus, from whatever sources 
they come, they should be placed in the field at the earliest 
possible moment.  Furthermore, as the Chief Executors of 
&Abdu'l-Baha's Divine Plan, He expects the Americans to bear 
the brunt of the load everywhere.  He has instructed the 
American N.S.A. to communicate with your Assembly with 
regard to pioneers to be settled in territories coming under your 
assignment, as well as territories not under your assignment, but 
where your Assembly can aid them in settling, particularly in 
 
+P305 
areas of the Commonwealth which are not under your 
assignment.  
 
     The specific suggestions of the Guardian are:  
 
     (a) Areas close at hand and easy of settlement should be filled 
first.  Then the areas more difficult, and finally those which will 
be quite difficult.  
     (b) Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable should 
be sent at once to the Guardian, giving the name, place, and any 
pertinent information.  
     (c) A monthly report of progress is to be sent by your 
Assembly to the Secretary-General of the International &Baha'i 
Council.  Special matters of report nature, for the Guardian, in 
connection with the plan should be sent to the Secretary-General 
of the Council also.  
     This does not mean that any administrative matters in 
connection with the settlement of pioneers, etc., should be 
handled with the Council.  Such matters should continue to be 
handled with the Guardian direct.  The Council is simply to co-ordinate 
reports, consolidate them, keep maps up to date, etc., for 
the Guardian, and your reports will enable them to do this.  
     (d) The Guardian feels the following areas are not difficult to 
settle, and he thinks you should arrange for their settlement at 
once; and he will appreciate cable advice of each settlement as 
they take place.  
 
     Channel Islands                Malta 
     Hebrides Islands               Cyprus 
     Shetland Islands 
 
     (e) The Guardian has cabled you, and at his direction I have 
written the Friends in Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika of the 
importance of their spreading out, and if possible sending 
pioneers into the surrounding areas in Africa, such as Belgian 
Congo, Ruanda Urundi, Somaliland, and even South West 
Africa.  He wishes you to follow up this matter closely.  The 
Guardian attached great importance to the Ashanti Protectorate, 
and if any of the Friends can go there, particularly any Persians 
you may be assisting in getting located, he will appreciate it.  
     As the Guardian's dramatic cable indicates, an illuminated 
 
+P306 
"Roll of Honour" on which will be inscribed the names of the 
"Knights of &Baha'u'llah" who first enter these 131 virgin areas, 
will be placed inside the entrance door of the Inner Sanctuary of 
the Tomb of &Baha'u'llah.  From time to time, the Guardian will 
announce to the &Baha'i World the names of those Holy Souls 
who arise under the conditions outlined in his message, and settle 
these areas and conquer them for &Baha'u'llah.  
     Now is the Hour for the Friends everywhere to demonstrate 
the spiritual vitality of the Faith, and of their devotion.  There is 
no time after this moment, to settle the unconquered areas.  The 
Guardian is sure the Friends throughout the world, and 
particularly the staunch &Baha'is in the British Isles, will arise as 
one soul in many bodies, and surging ahead, cover the face of the 
Earth with the Glory of the Lord.  
     The Guardian will pray fervently for the &Baha'is of the British 
Isles for the success of their efforts.  
     The Guardian will pray for the members of your Assembly, 
whose sacrificial efforts he greatly values....  
 
 
8 June 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you following 
my letter of June 5th in connection with the great importance 
of settling one hundred and thirty-one virgin areas, during the 
next few months.  
     Naturally it will be difficult for the Faith to be established in 
the new territories or amongst the new tribes if they do not have 
at least a pamphlet for distribution to the new contacts.  
     He therefore feels that along with the sending of pioneers into 
the virgin areas, the translation of literature into the languages 
assigned to the British National Assembly should take place.  He 
has cabled you direct concerning this very important matter, 
and has informed you in his cable that he is arranging for a gift 
of 1,000 Pounds to assist you in this most important work.  
     The Guardian feels that one of the existing pamphlets would 
be satisfactory, or a new one, which you may feel it desirable to 
prepare.  At this time, it is not necessary to enter into the question 
of translation of &Baha'i books, simply a pamphlet, which can be 
used for teaching purposes.  
 
+P307 
     The Guardian wishes you to budget the necessary funds to 
cover this work and to see that it is actively pursued, so that the 
literature will be available at an early date.  
     He wishes you to send current reports of activities in 
connection with this matter to the Secretary-General of the 
International &Baha'i Council, so that the data may be assembled 
with all the necessary information in connection with the Ten 
Year Crusade, for the Guardian.  
     He sends his loving greetings to you.  
 
 
25 June 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letters of July 8, 12 and 16, August 5 and 13, September 
16, 20 and 26, October 13, 14 and 26, December 12 (3) and 17, 
1952, and January 4, 6, 13, 15, 20, 27 (2) and 29, February 3 and 
6, March 12, 17, 22, 23 and 26, April 1, 17, 20, 24 and 29, May 
5, 11, 14, 15 (2), 28 and 30, 1953, with their enclosures, have 
been received by the beloved Guardian, as well as material sent 
under separate cover, and he has instructed me to answer you on 
his behalf.  
     As you are all aware, the pressure of work is constantly 
increasing all over the &Baha'i world, and of course the heaviest 
load falls upon the Guardian.  That is why he is finding it 
increasingly difficult to keep up with his letters, not only to 
individuals, but also to national bodies, important as they are.  He 
regrets this delay, but sees no remedy for it.  
     It was a source of great pride to him that the British &Baha'is 
succeeded with their Plan, in spite of the fact that it was a long, 
hard struggle, and in some instances the odds seemed very much 
against them.  He feels sure that their qualities of tenacity of 
purpose, fidelity and initiative will carry them on to even greater 
distinction during the coming ten years, as they execute their 
portion of the Global Crusade, an important portion.  
     It was very nice to have dear Dr. Mitchell+ here; the Guardian 
hopes that gradually more British &Baha'is will be able to make 
the pilgrimage.  
     He was very relieved to hear that dear Mr. Townshend has 
recovered his health to such an extent that he will be attending 
 
+P308 
the Stockholm Conference, where his presence will be welcomed 
by all the other Hands attending, and the believers as well....  
     The letters which your Assembly wrote at the request of the 
... &Baha'is to certain officials there, he thought were excellent.  
What he did not think was excellent was the almost insulting 
reply you received as regards ... from the authorities in London 
and signed by....  The letter was a mass of contradictions, and 
the excuses transparent, to say the least.  It shows that there is no 
doubt going to be a stiffening opposition from certain colonial 
governments, as the &Baha'i work progresses.  
     Your Assembly will undoubtedly continue to press the matter 
as best you can with the authorities, without causing too much 
opposition....  
     The question of impressing upon the Africans who are seeking 
enrolment the necessity of not drinking is a delicate one.  When 
enrolling new believers, we must be wise and gentle, and not 
place so many obstacles in their way that they feel it impossible 
to accept the Faith.  On the other hand, once accorded 
membership in the community of the followers of &Baha'u'llah, 
it must be brought home to them that they are expected to live 
up to His teachings, and to show forth the signs of a noble 
character in conformity with His laws.  This can often be done 
gradually, after the new believer is enrolled.  
     Now that the African work has entered upon an entirely new 
phase, indeed the work all over the world, the position your 
Assembly held as the more or less co-ordinating body for the 
work in Africa has been changed.  However, the closest co-operation 
will be necessary between all the National Assemblies 
concerned with the Africa teaching work, if the Plan is to go 
ahead swiftly; and exchange of information, especially as regards 
pioneer possibilities and posts, is essential, in order to get the 
believers out to the goal countries during this year, which is the 
Guardian's ardent hope, and to which he attaches the greatest 
possible importance.  There is no objection to British pioneers 
going into the territories of other Assemblies, or believers under 
other jurisdiction being used by your Assembly.  The most 
important thing is to open up the virgin countries; and of course 
whoever works in a country under the jurisdiction of a specific 
Assembly, no matter where their origin may have been, would 
be under the orders of that Assembly.  
 
+P309 
     As he has cabled, he considers that, at this stage in the 
development of the Faith in Africa, it is not necessary for so 
many people to congregate in one centre, such as Kampala, when 
there is such a tremendous need in neighbouring territories for 
pioneers, whether native or European.  
     He considers that the formation of a school at this time is 
premature.  It would involve us in heavy responsibilities which 
for the sake of public opinion would have to be discharged 
efficiently and in an exemplary manner, and he does not consider 
that we have the resources or the facilities at present to embark 
on such a project.  There is no reason why the subject cannot be 
reconsidered at a future date.  
     He considers that the attitude of your Assembly regarding 
police service which might be required of the &Baha'is in Kenya 
at this time is correct, and that it is not war, so far.  As it seems 
that ... situation with his employer, for the present at least, 
prevented him from having to do police duty, the subject does 
not arise for the moment.  He does not think that any general 
rule can be laid down in such matters.  Events must be watched, 
and, when situations such as these arise, fresh consultation with 
him will be necessary....  
     As he has already informed you, and the National Spiritual 
Assembly of America as well, there is no objection to your 
receiving co-operation from them and financial assistance which 
they might be able to give you in publishing some of the 
literature in the African languages.  
     He thinks your Assembly's decision regarding spiritual healing 
being demonstrated at a &Baha'i meeting was quite sound.  We 
should try not to have the Faith identified with such things in the 
eyes of the public, officially.  What the believers do privately, 
which in no way contravenes the Teachings, is their own affair.  
     As regards the Obligatory Prayers, the friends in the West 
should continue to use them exactly as they have been doing, 
and as is set forth in the remarks in parentheses which accompany 
the prayers in the book "Prayers and Meditations".  The Guardian 
himself will, whenever he sees fit, and considers the time is ripe, 
inform the friends in such matters in greater detail.  
     Of all the work being undertaken by the believers, East and 
West, at the present time, undoubtedly the most urgent is that of 
getting the pioneers out to the goal countries during this year, if 
 
+P310 
possible.  Not only will spiritual strength accrue from this 
settlement of so many new lands, but the prestige it gives us in 
the eyes of the &non-Baha'is is great.  He fully realises heavy 
burdens have been placed upon the shoulders of all the &Baha'is, 
and particularly upon the members of the twelve N.S.A.s 
directing this great crusade.  But who else except the believers 
can do the work of &Baha'u'llah?  And short of accomplishing His 
work, where else lies hope for this confused and sorely-tried 
world?  
     In spite of your many problems, he feels confident that you 
will find amongst the valiant members of the British &Baha'i 
community sufficient volunteers to enable you to fill your virgin 
territories and islands with at least one pioneer per place.  As he 
has already pointed out, there can be exchange; in other words, 
one Assembly can make use of volunteers for its goals from 
amongst believers under the jurisdiction of another N.S.A. if 
such are available.  
     In spite of your financial position and the work that lies ahead, 
the Guardian has felt it wise and necessary for you to take steps 
to purchase a national headquarters.  When we remember that 
England is one of the oldest &Baha'i countries, so to speak, in the 
West, and that in spite of her distinction she is still without a 
suitable seat for her national &Baha'i administration, we see how 
important it is for her, on the eve of this great period of 
expansion, to have a National Centre.  France, without any 
N.S.A. as yet, now has one, and it is high time England had one 
too.  You will receive aid from others in this undertaking, as well 
as from the Guardian.  He was pleased that Mr. Joseph took the 
first step in enabling you to fulfil this objective.  
     His loving thoughts and prayers are with each and every one 
of you, as you face your great responsibilities and rise to meet 
your priceless opportunities....  
     P.S.  The Guardian wishes your Assembly to express to Mr. 
Albert Joseph his deep appreciation of the assistance he is giving 
you in connection with the purchase of a National Headquarters.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The successive victories won, in recent years, by the British &Baha'i 
community, proclaiming, on the one hand, the triumphant conclusion 
of the first collective enterprise undertaken in British &Baha'i history on 
 
+P311 
the morrow of the centenary celebrations of the Founding of the Faith 
of &Baha'u'llah, and on the other, the successful termination of the Two 
Year Plan, marking the inauguration of the community's historic 
Mission beyond the confines of its homeland, have immensely 
enhanced its prestige throughout the entire &Baha'i world, have won for 
it the abiding gratitude and profound admiration of all who labour for 
our beloved Faith, and entitled it to assume a prominent share in the 
conduct of the world spiritual Crusade launched amidst the festivities 
signalising the climax of the celebrations of this Holy Year 
commemorating the centenary of the birth of the Mission of the 
Author of the &Baha'i Dispensation.  
     Much has been achieved in the course of the past nine years, both 
within the borders of this community's island home, and throughout 
the widely scattered Dependencies of the British Crown, on the shores 
as well as within the heart of the vast and far-off African Continent, 
to merit the pride that fills the hearts of its staunch and stalwart 
members, to deserve the applause of the Concourse on High, to evoke 
the fondest hopes for the steady unfoldment and ultimate consummation 
of the historic Mission entrusted to the care of the British followers of 
the Cause of &Baha'u'llah, and to befittingly usher in a new Era in 
British &Baha'i history--an Era that will for ever remain associated 
with the systematic introduction of God's triumphant Faith, through 
the concerted efforts of the heroic band of &Baha'i pioneers, dwelling 
within the British Isles, into the Chief Dependencies of the British 
Crown scattered throughout the European and Asiatic continents and 
the islands and archipelagos of the Seven Seas.  
     The entire community, now firmly entrenched within the 
Administrative strongholds, recently and so laboriously established in 
England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, must rise as one man to the 
occasion that now presents itself.  With hearts brimming with the love 
of &Baha'u'llah, with souls entirely dedicated to His Cause, with minds 
attuned to the laws and precepts underlying His teachings, steeled with 
an inflexible determination to utilise, to the fullest extent, the 
administrative agencies which their hands have fashioned since the 
passing of &Abdu'l-Baha, and deriving fresh hope and sustenance from 
the rapid and remarkable victories won in both the teaching and 
administrative spheres of &Baha'i activity, both at home and abroad, the 
members of this high-minded, tenacious and spiritually alive 
community must gird up their loins, intensify their efforts a hundredfold 
and, through their combined and sustained efforts, write yet another 
 
+P312 
chapter in British &Baha'i history that will illuminate the annals of the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah and eclipse the splendour of the feats already 
accomplished in the past fifty years by the adherents of His Cause in 
their native land.  
     The twofold process, already set in motion, which has been attended 
by such conspicuous success, must, in the course of the coming decade, 
be not only fully maintained but steadily accelerated.  While the 
structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith within the British 
Isles is being steadily reinforced and enlarged, through the multiplication 
of the administrative institutions of the Faith in England, 
Scotland, Wales and Ireland and the consolidation of the newly-fledged 
assemblies already established, an effort, unprecedented in scope 
and intensity, must be continually and determinedly exerted to lay the 
administrative basis of this Order not only in the islands bordering the 
British Isles, but in the Dependencies of the British Crown in the 
Mediterranean, and in the African and Asiatic Continents.  
     This vital aspect of the Mission committed to the care of the British 
&Baha'i community, must, in the course of the Crusade upon which it 
has embarked, receive a tremendous impetus, and gather such 
momentum as to justify the trust &Abdu'l-Baha so confidently placed 
in this community and the distinctive functions with which its 
members have been invested since His passing.  The development of the 
institutions of the Faith on the home front must be supplemented by, 
and afford a constant stimulus to, the rise of similar institutions, first 
in the limited number of territories and islands assigned to the elected 
representatives of this community, and eventually throughout the 
colonies and protectorates comprising the British Empire.  
     The opening phase of the Ten Year Plan so auspiciously 
inaugurated on the morrow of the memorable victories already 
achieved, covering a period of no less than two years, must be 
distinguished by the opening, in rapid succession, of the eleven virgin 
territories in Europe and Africa and the laying of a firm foundation for 
the future erection of a rapidly rising Administrative Order whose 
ramifications are destined to encircle within the coming ten years the 
entire planet.  
     The exertions required to consummate the first stage of this Ten 
Year Plan are admittedly arduous, and demand the utmost 
attentiveness, and a degree of sacrifice and consecration unequalled in 
the entire course of British &Baha'i history.  In spite of the smallness of 
their numbers, and the limited resources at their disposal, the members 
 
+P313 
of the community living in the British Isles, including administrators 
and teachers, as well as the band of self-sacrificing pioneers who have 
already forsaken their homes and are labouring in distant fields in the 
African Continent, must, at whatever cost, disperse more widely and 
direct their footsteps to the virgin territories and islands assigned to 
their National Assembly, contributing thereby, directly and effectively, 
to the speedy and successful termination of the initial phase of a 
Crusade on which the immediate destinies of the entire community so 
largely depend.  
     While this supreme effort is being exerted special and immediate 
attention must, likewise, be directed to two other objectives which 
constitute a vital part of the work now confronting the members of this 
community.  The selection of the site of the &Haziratu'l-Quds in the city 
of London, the heart of the British Empire, and the national 
administrative seat of the &Baha'is of the British Isles, and the adoption 
of effective measures for its immediate purchase, as well as the 
preparation of a suitable pamphlet and its prompt translation and 
publication in the thirty-one languages assigned to the British &Baha'i 
National Assembly, are matters of such urgency as to be given 
precedence, during the coming two years, over all the other objectives 
of the Ten Year Plan.  
     The Plan on which the British &Baha'i community has embarked, 
unique in its significance, unprecedented in its scope, so vast in its 
potentialities, so meritorious in its objectives, so challenging in its 
features, will, if consummated, at the appointed time, open a further 
vista, before the eyes of its victorious prosecutors, of such transcendent 
glory as none of them can as yet even dimly imagine.  The path leading 
to the discovery of this brilliant yet at present distant goal, at which a 
triumphant community will be enabled to catch a glimpse of its 
ultimate destiny, revealed in the plenitude of its splendour, is long, 
steep and thorny.  The prizes to be won by those who must tread this 
path, in the years immediately ahead, are not to be easily secured.  The 
challenge will be prolonged and severe.  The opportunities they now 
have to scale loftier heights of heroism, and achieve still mightier 
victories during the interval separating the Great and Most Great 
Jubilees, will if missed never again recur.  
     He Who, in His infinite love and mercy, called into being this 
community, more than fifty years ago, at the time of the inception of 
His Father's Faith in the West, Who tenderly and vigilantly nursed 
it and guided its footsteps in the early years of its infancy, Who twice 
 
+P314 
conferred upon it the inestimable blessings of personal contact with its 
members, Who sustained, from His station on high, its development 
in the course of no less than two decades, within the framework of a 
rising Administrative Order, Who enabled it to expand and consolidate 
itself within its island home, Who launched it, subsequently, on its 
mission overseas, will, if its members prove themselves worthy of His 
trust, continue to shower His manifold blessings upon them, at this 
hour of their greatest need, and will enable them to traverse, speedily 
and successfully, the second and momentous stage in the progressive 
unfoldment of that same Mission.  
     That they may, guided and assisted by the vigilance, the wisdom 
and devotion of their elected national representatives, forge ahead with 
undiminished vigour, with exemplary fidelity, and with inflexible 
determination, along the path of their high destiny, overcome every 
obstacle that stands in their way, achieve signal success in the course 
of the opening phase of this world-girdling Crusade, and crown 
eventually their Ten Year Plan with a victory unexampled in the 
annals of the Faith in the British Isles, is my cherished hope for them 
and my fervent and constant prayer.

To the Hands of the Cause, the members of the National 
Spiritual Assemblies, the pioneers, the resident believers and 
visitors attending the European Intercontinental Teaching 
Conference in Stockholm, Sweden (July 21/26, 1953).  
 
Well-beloved Friends, 
     With a glad and grateful heart I welcome the convocation, in the 
capital city of Sweden, of the third of a series of Intercontinental 
Teaching Conferences associated with the world-wide festivities 
commemorating the Centenary of the Mission of &Baha'u'llah and 
destined to exert a profound and lasting influence on the immediate 
fortunes of His Faith in all continents of the globe.  
     I look back with feelings of wonder, thankfulness and joy upon the 
chain of memorable circumstances which, a little over a century ago, 
accompanied the introduction of the Faith into, and marked the 
inception of its nascent institutions within a continent which, in the 
course of the last two thousand years, has exercised on the destiny of 
the human race a pervasive influence unequalled by that of any other 
continent of the globe.  
     I feel impelled on this historic occasion, when the members of the 
American, the British, the German and the newly formed Italo-Swiss 
National Spiritual Assemblies, as well as representatives of the &Baha'is 
of the United Kingdom, of Eire, of Germany, of Austria, of the 
Scandinavian and Benelux countries, of the Iberian Peninsula, of 
Italy, of Switzerland, of France and of Finland are assembled, to pay 
a warm tribute to the valiant labours of the early British and French 
&Baha'i pioneers, who at the very dawn of the Faith in Europe, strove 
with such diligence, consecration and resolution to fan into flame that 
holy Fire which the hand of the appointed Centre of &Baha'u'llah's 
Covenant had kindled in the north-west extremity of that continent 
 
+F1 Refers to purchase of &Haziratu'l-Quds, London.  
 
+P316 
on the morrow of His Father's ascension.  I recall the slow eastward 
spread of that infant Light which led to the gradual emergence of the 
German and Austrian &Baha'i communities, during the darkest period 
of &Abdu'l-Baha's incarceration in the prison-fortress of &Akka.  I am 
reminded of His subsequent epoch-making visit, soon after His 
providential release from His forty-year confinement in the Most 
Great Prison, to these newly-fledged struggling communities, of His 
patient seed-sowing destined to yield at a later age its first fruits, and 
constituting a landmark of the utmost significance in the rise and 
establishment of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in that continent.  
     I, moreover, call to mind, on this occasion, the successive episodes 
which, on the morrow of &Abdu'l-Baha's ascension, in the course of the 
initial Epoch of the Formative Age of the &Baha'i Dispensation, 
signalised the emergence of those administrative institutions, both local 
and national, which proclaimed the germination of those potent seeds 
which had lain dormant for more than a decade in these newly-opened 
European territories, and which culminated in the construction of the 
framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah 
and the erection of the first two pillars destined to sustain in that 
continent the weight of the final unit of that Order.  
     Nor can I fail to acclaim, as a further milestone in the irresistible 
evolution of that Faith, the launching, following the creation of the 
administrative agencies designed to provide the effectual instruments 
for its propagation, of the Six Year Plan of the British &Baha'i 
community followed successively by the European Teaching Campaign, 
inaugurated in accordance with the provisions of the second 
Seven Year Plan of the American &Baha'i community, the Five Year 
Plan conceived by the German and Austrian &Baha'i communities and 
the Two Year Plan later initiated by the British &Baha'i community--
Plans which, within less than a decade, succeeded in laying the 
structural basis of the Administrative Order of the Faith in Wales, in 
Scotland, in Northern Ireland and in Eire, in multiplying and 
consolidating &Baha'i institutions throughout the British Isles, in 
broadening and strengthening the foundations of that same Order in 
Germany and Austria, in erecting the National Administrative 
Headquarters of the Faith in the city of Frankfurt, in establishing 
Spiritual Assemblies in the capital cities of no less than ten sovereign 
states in Europe, in reinforcing the administrative foundations of that 
Faith in those territories, in providing the means for the convocation 
of four European, and a series of regional, Teaching Conferences, and 
 
+P317 
above all, in the convocation of the historic Convention in Florence, 
culminating in the emergence of the National Spiritual Assembly of 
the &Baha'is of Italy and Switzerland, the third in a series of institutions 
destined to play their part in the eventual establishment of the Supreme 
Legislative Body of the Administrative Order of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
     The hour is now ripe for these communities, whether new or old, 
local or national, already functioning on the northern, the western and 
the southern fringes of that continent, as well as those situated in its 
very heart, to initiate befittingly and prosecute energetically the 
European Campaign of a global Crusade which will not only 
contribute, to an unprecedented degree, to the broadening and the 
consolidation of the foundations of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah on the 
continent of Europe, but will also diffuse its light over the neighbouring 
islands, and will, God willing, carry its radiance to the eastern 
territories of that continent, and beyond them as far as the heart of 
Asia.  
     The privileged prosecutors of so revolutionising, so gigantic, so 
sacred and beneficent a campaign are, on the morrow of its launching, 
and at such a crucial hour in the destinies of the European continent, 
summoned to undertake:  First, the formation, under the aegis of the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the United States, of 
one National Spiritual Assembly in each of the Scandinavian and 
Benelux countries, and those of the Iberian Peninsula, and one in 
Finland, as well as the establishment, in collaboration with the Paris 
Spiritual Assembly, of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is 
of France, the establishment under the aegis of the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the &Baha'is of Germany and Austria, of the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Austria, and the establishment, 
under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of 
the United States, and in association with the National Spiritual 
Assembly of the &Baha'is of Italy and Switzerland, of independent 
National Spiritual Assemblies in Italy and Switzerland.  Second, the 
construction of the first &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of Europe in the city of 
Frankfurt, the heart of Germany, which occupies such a central 
position in the continent of Europe.  Third, the purchase of land for the 
future construction of two &Mashriqu'l-Adhkars, one in the north in 
the city of Stockholm, and one in the south in the city of Rome, the seat 
and stronghold of the most powerful Church in Christendom.  Fourth, 
the opening of the following thirty virgin territories and islands:  
 
+P318 
Albania, Crete, Estonia, Finno-Karelia, Frisian Islands, Greece, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Moldavia, Rumania, White Russia, assigned to 
the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Germany and 
Austria; Channel Islands, Cyprus, Faroe Islands, Hebrides Islands, 
Malta, Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands, assigned to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the British Isles; Andorra, 
Azores, Balearic Islands, Lofoten Islands, Spitzbergen, Ukraine, 
assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the 
United States of America; Liechtenstein, Monaco, Rhodes, San 
Marino, Sardinia, Sicily, assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly 
of the &Baha'is of Italy and Switzerland.  Fifth, the translation and 
publication of &Baha'i literature in the following ten languages to be 
undertaken by the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the 
United States of America, through its European Teaching Committee:  
Basque, Estonian, Flemish, Lapp, Maltese, Piedmontese, Romani, 
Romansch, Yiddish, Ziryen.  Sixth, the consolidation of Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland, France, Holland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, 
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, allocated to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the United States of America; of 
Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Russian 
S.F.S., Yugoslavia, allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of 
the &Baha'is of Germany and Austria; of Eire, allocated to the National 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the British Isles; of Iceland, 
allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Canada; 
and of Corsica, allocated to the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
&Baha'is of Italy and Switzerland.  Seventh, the incorporation of 
the thirteen above-mentioned National Spiritual Assemblies.  Eighth, 
the establishment by these same National Spiritual Assemblies of 
national &Baha'i endowments.  Ninth, the establishment of a national 
&Haziratu'l-Quds in the capital city of each of the countries where the 
National Spiritual Assemblies are to be established, as well as one in 
London and one in Paris.  Tenth, the formation of a National &Baha'i 
Publishing Trust in Frankfurt, Germany.  Eleventh, the formation of 
Israel Branches of the National Spiritual Assemblies of the &Baha'is of 
the British Isles and of Germany and Austria, authorised to hold, on 
behalf of their parent institutions, property dedicated to the Holy 
Shrines at the World Centre of the Faith in the State of Israel.  
Twelfth, the conversion to the Faith of representatives of the Basque 
and Gypsy races.  Thirteenth, the appointment during &Ridvan 1954, 
by the Hands of the Cause in Europe, of an auxiliary board of nine 
 
+P319 
members who will, in conjunction with the four National Spiritual 
Assemblies participating in the European campaign, assist, through 
periodic and systematic visits to &Baha'i centres, in the efficient and 
prompt execution of the Plans formulated for the prosecution of the 
teaching campaign in the European continent.  
     A continent occupying such a central and strategic position on the 
entire planet; so rich and eventful in its history; so diversified in its 
culture; from whose soil sprang both the Hellenic and Roman 
civilisations; the mainspring of a civilisation to some of whose features 
&Baha'u'llah Himself paid tribute; on whose southern shores Christendom 
first established its home; along whose eastern marches the mighty 
forces of the Cross and the Crescent so frequently clashed; on whose 
south-western extremity a fast evolving Islamic culture yielded its 
fairest fruit; in whose heart the light of the Reformation shone so 
brightly, shedding its rays as far as the outlying regions of the globe; 
the well-spring of American culture; whose northern and western 
fringes were first warmed and illuminated, less than a century ago, by 
the dawning light of the Revelation of &Baha'u'llah; in whose heart a 
community, so rich in promise, was subsequently established; whose 
soil was later sanctified by the twice-repeated visit of the appointed 
Centre of His Covenant; which witnessed, in consequence of the rise 
and establishment of the Administrative Order of His Faith, the 
erection of two of the foremost pillars of the future Universal House of 
Justice; which, in recent years, sustained the dynamic impact of a 
series of national Plans preparatory to the launching of a world 
spiritual crusade--such a continent has at last at this critical hour, this 
great turning-point in its fortunes, entered upon what may well be 
regarded as the opening phase of a great spiritual revival that bids fair 
to eclipse any period in its spiritual history.  
     May the elected representatives of the National &Baha'i communities 
entrusted with the conduct of this momentous undertaking launched 
on the soil of this continent, aided by the Hands of the Cause and their 
auxiliary boards, reinforced by the local communities, the groups and 
isolated believers sharing in this massive and collective enterprise, and 
supported by the subsidiary agencies to be appointed for its efficient 
prosecution, be graciously assisted by the Lord of Hosts to contribute, 
in the years immediately ahead, through their concerted efforts and 
collective achievements, in both the teaching and administrative 
spheres of &Baha'i activity, to the success of this glorious Crusade, and 
lend a tremendous impetus to the conversion, the reconciliation and the 
 
+P320 
ultimate unification of the divers and conflicting peoples, races and 
classes dwelling within the borders of a travailing, a sorely-agitated 
and spiritually-famished continent.  
     May all the privileged participators, enlisting under the banner of 
&Baha'u'llah for the promotion of so pre-eminent and meritorious a 
Cause, be they from the Eastern or Western hemisphere, of either sex, 
white or coloured, young or old, neophyte or veteran, whether serving 
in their capacity as expounders of the teachings, or administrators, of 
His Faith, as settlers or itinerant teachers, distinguish themselves by 
such deeds of heroism as will rival, nay outshine, the feats accomplished 
nineteen hundred years ago by that little band of God-intoxicated 
disciples who, fearlessly preaching the Gospel of a newly-arisen 
Messiah, contributed so decisively to the illumination, the regeneration 
and the advancement of the entire European continent.

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your letter of 5th August has been received by the beloved 
 
+P321 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The contributions made by the British &Baha'i community to 
the Shrine of the &Bab Fund and to the &Baha'i International Fund 
are greatly appreciated.  Receipts are enclosed herewith.+F1  
     The beloved Guardian deeply values the unique and outstanding 
services of the &Baha'is of the British Isles.  Through their 
devotion and sacrifice, they are setting an example for posterity.  
     He wishes me to assure you that he prays fervently for the 
spiritual confirmation of all of the friends of the British Isles; for 
their material and spiritual welfare, and that every obstacle may 
be removed from their paths of service, particularly during the 
Global Crusade.  
     The Shrine of the &Bab is rapidly nearing completion.  Its 
beauty and splendour are difficult to portray.  Certainly the 
Guardian very aptly described the octagon, the drum and the 
dome as the triple crowns on the Shrine of the &Bab.  Now that 
the glory and splendour of the golden dome is revealed by the 
removal of all of the scaffolding, it is truly a golden crown for 
the Shrine, and each time one looks at it, one becomes more and 
more impressed that it is a symbol of the manner in which the 
&Baha'is of the world, led by the beloved Guardian, are crowning 
the &Baha'i activities of the past one hundred years by spreading 
the knowledge of the Glory of the Lord throughout the world.  
     The Guardian sends his loving greetings to you all....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:

this Island, and wishes your Assembly to see that the teaching 
work there progresses as rapidly and efficiently as possible.  
     At the present time, it has again become virgin, according to 
our records.  Do you know if Miss Townshend intends to return?  
If not, your Assembly should undertake to fill the post just as 
quickly as possible, with someone else.  
     As you have become aware through the Guardian's Convention 
Message, he is very happy with the result of the first year of 
the Ten-Year Crusade.  He is hoping that the second year will 
witness even more glorious victories, and this time on the home 
front, as well as in foreign fields.  
     He would appreciate a report of the plans for Malta, as soon 
as possible.  In order to save him work, it is suggested it be sent 
to me.  (Mr. L. Ioas)

European and Asian Committee 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of the 9th of Nur, 110, was received by the 
beloved Guardian.  
     As he has been tremendously busy during this Holy Year--
and indeed his work is increasing all the time--and there was 
nothing urgent that required an immediate reply--he has 
delayed in answering you until he had more time.  
     He hopes that your committee will be able to gradually assist 
in the work allotted to the British National Spiritual Assembly 
during the Plan.  
     The most important thing of course is to get the believers out 
into wholly virgin areas, and keep them there.  So far, England 
has done nobly, and he is proud of their efforts.  
     The Pacific area is also of great importance.  If there is any 
possibility of British subjects going out to territories that are 
under the jurisdiction of other National Bodies, but difficult to 
get into, he feels that they should be referred to the committees 
concerned, or the National Spiritual Assemblies concerned, 
because of the importance of achieving all the goals of the Plan, 
regardless of which Assembly has certain goals under its 
immediate jurisdiction.  
     He assures you he will pray for the success of your devoted 
labours, in the Holy Shrine.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your meritorious activities, guide and 
sustain you always, and enable you to lend a great impetus to the 
splendid work now being accomplished in Europe and in Asia.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your loving letter of April 30th has just come to hand, calling 
attention to the fact that Olga Mills, one of the pioneers in Malta, 
 
+P328 
is serving there very actively.  The beloved Guardian had been 
informed by someone that she had left.  
     However, the intent of the letter of April 24th still remains--
that no pioneer should leave their goal unless for very urgent 
reasons.  In the case of Malta, this is a country which can only be 
settled by English &Baha'is, and therefore the Guardian feels it of 
great importance that any pioneer who goes there should remain.  
It is hoped that it may be possible for Una Townshend to return 
in due course, to carry on her work there.  
     The Guardian asks that you convey to Olga Mills his loving 
appreciation of her devoted services, and assure her of his prayers 
in her behalf.  
     If Una Townshend finds it impossible to return to Malta, then 
the Guardian hopes you can send some other pioneer to that 
important post....  
 
 
16 May 1954 
 
     I am enclosing, at the instruction of our beloved Guardian, the 
original title-deed of one-quarter of an acre of land recently 
purchased near the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf on 
Mount Carmel; and registered in the name of the Israel Branch 
of the National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of the British 
Isles.  
     The cost of this property was six thousand dollars.  
     He feels sure that the British &Baha'is will rejoice to know that 
they now have a part of the International &Baha'i Endowments in 
the name of their own special Israel Branch....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The various letters of your committee dated June 8 and 25, 
July 6, August 13, September 23, October 8, November 25 and 
December 31, 1953, and January 27 (3), March 6 and 30 and 
April 20, 1954, with their enclosures, have been received by the 
 
+P329 
beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  As he has been in constant cable communication with 
you during the past year, I will not go into many of the matters 
which have already been attended to.  
     Of all the places in the world where the &Baha'i Faith exists and 
is spreading, the Guardian is definitely most pleased with Africa, 
and most proud of Uganda.  He feels that the spirit shown by 
white and negro pioneers alike in that continent, presents a 
challenge to the &Baha'is everywhere in the world, and that old 
and staid communities may well learn from, and emulate the 
example of, the believers of Africa, many of them scarcely a year 
old in the Cause of God!  
     He feels that your committee and the British N.S.A. have 
every reason to be proud of the work you have accomplished, 
and grateful for the blessings you have received from on High.  
     It has particularly rejoiced his heart to see the way almost 
every goal was attained at the last minute, before the end of the 
first year of the Ten Year Crusade, many of these goals through 
the immediate whole-hearted response of some of these new 
African &Baha'is, themselves the spiritual children of other African 
&Baha'is--young in the Faith, but old in their understanding of it.  
     The main task, now that the back of the pioneer settlement 
work has been broken, so to speak, is the consolidation of these 
territories and the maintaining of the pioneers at their posts.  He 
is constantly urging all National Assemblies to impress upon 
those who have gone forth to settle virgin territories, the 
importance of staying there, and of only abandoning their posts 
if they are forced to do so by the Government in question, and 
not for some other reason.  The friends have had such difficulty 
in gaining access to some of these countries,--visas, housing, 
expenses have all been such a problem--that once they get there, 
they should really move heaven and earth to remain.  
     He is very happy that two of the Temple sites on the African 
continent have been purchased, and feels that this will release a 
tremendous spiritual impetus.  He hopes that the Egyptian &Baha'is 
will soon decide on a site, and that will complete the chain for 
the time being.  
     Concerning the various questions you have raised regarding 
literature and translations, he thinks that it is perhaps better to 
have a proper introductory pamphlet on the Faith translated into 
 
+P330 
... and not give any wide publicity for the time being, than to 
spend money translating a lopsided presentation of the Teachings.  
However, he believes that, with sufficient effort and good 
judgment, a pamphlet could be gotten out that would neither 
stress too strongly the racial teachings, nor minimise them too 
much, and could discreetly be used for teaching purposes in...  
     He has spoken very strongly to some of the pilgrims here 
about the teaching work in that country, and impressed upon 
them that the whole object of the pioneers in going forth to 
Africa, is to teach the coloured people, and not the white people.  
This does not mean that they must refuse to teach the white 
people, which would be a foolish attitude.  It does, however, 
mean that they should constantly bear in mind that it is to the 
native African that they are now carrying the Message of 
&Baha'u'llah, in his own country, and not to people from abroad 
who have migrated there permanently or temporarily and are a 
minority, and many of them, judging by their acts, a very 
unsavoury minority.  
     He hopes that every effort will be made to get out a pamphlet 
in each of the languages chosen, or those that you have substituted 
for a chosen language.  He fully realises that, in many cases, the 
people who speak the language are illiterate, and, strictly 
speaking, do not require a printed pamphlet in their own tongue.  
He considers however the psychological values of having 
something translated into their own language, the compliment 
implicit in it, so to speak, of great importance, sufficient to offset 
the time, effort and expense involved.  
     He would like your committee to convey to all the pioneers, 
most particularly the negro ones, the expression of his deep 
admiration of the wonderful spirit that animates them, his 
feeling of affection for them, and the assurance of his ardent 
prayers for their success.  
     Africa is truly awakening and finding herself, and she 
undoubtedly has a great message to give, and a great contribution 
to make to the advancement of world civilisation.  To the degree 
to which her peoples accept &Baha'u'llah, will they be blessed, 
strengthened and protected.  
     He hopes that, whilst concentrating on the consolidation of 
the work under your jurisdiction, you will give every assistance 
within your power to the other National Assemblies who have 
 
+P331 
difficult places to settle.  The Portuguese and Spanish territories 
seem to be the hardest of all to gain access to.  Any help your 
committee can give along this line would certainly be rendering 
a great service to the Cause.  
     He deeply appreciates the work you have done, and your 
committee achievements, during the past year, and assures each 
and all of you of his loving prayers on your behalf....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Assuring you of my loving and constant prayers for the success of 
the efforts you are so devotedly exerting for the promotion of our 
beloved Faith and its institutions, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has been greatly pleased with the 
reports he has received of the progress of the teaching work in 
Oxford.  He feels the friends in that city have undertaken their 
responsibility diligently and successfully.  
     It is his feeling that the Faith should be firmly established in 
Cambridge, which is also one of the great centres of learning in 
the British Isles.  He understands that Cambridge is a goal city of 
the Crusade, and he feels that the time has now arrived for the 
opening of that city and the expansion of the teaching work 
there.  
     He would appreciate a report from you as to the progress of 
the Faith in that important city.  This report should be addressed 
to me, and I will inform him of its contents....  
 
 
11 June 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write you in 
connection with the purchase of the &Haziratu'l-Quds for the city 
of London.  The Guardian is very hopeful that your Assembly 
will be able to complete this important matter in the near future.  
     In connection with the purchase of &Haziratu'l-Quds, under the 
 
+P332 
Ten Year Crusade there are a total of 49 to be procured.  4 of 
them were procured during the first year of the Crusade.  
     At the Guardian's direction, I have written the National 
Assemblies involved, calling for the purchase of 17 &Haziratu'l-Quds 
of the 45, during this year.  One of these 17 &Haziratu'l-Quds 
is the one in London.  
     The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to the 
fulfilment of this aspect of the Ten Year Crusade; and sincerely 
hopes your Assembly will concentrate on the purchase of the 
&Haziratu'l-Quds for London, so that it may be consummated as 
soon as possible....  
 
 
17 June 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your Assembly's letters dated June 10 (2), 17, 22 and 26, July 
3, 7, 8, 9 (2), 16 and 24, August 17, 19 (2) and 24, September 17, 
21, 24 and 25, October 1, 8, 12, 22 and 28, November 13 (4) and 
18 (2), December 10 (2), 12 and 23, 1953, and January 7, 20 (2), 
21 and 22, February 17 (3), 19 (3), 21, 23 (2) and 25, March 1, 
23, 24 and 25 (3), April 13 and 28, May 12, 21 and 25, June 1 
(4) and 15, 1954, with enclosures, have been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He regrets very much the long delays in answering the 
National Spiritual Assemblies, but is finding it increasingly 
difficult to keep abreast of his work.  He feels sometimes that he 
will soon be forced to give up correspondence with individuals, 
although he is reluctant to do so, because so many of the new 
believers brought in during the present teaching activities in 
Africa and other far goals are writing to him.  However, he has 
attended to a great many of your questions by cable, and the 
visits of a number of English pilgrims have enabled him to send 
you messages and to keep the British community in contact with 
the work in the Holy Land.  
     He greatly appreciated the desire of John and Dorothy Ferraby 
to go out as pioneers, but considered that it would weaken the 
work of the National Assembly altogether too much.  Important 
as the pioneer field is, if all the most able workers go out, the 
 
+P333 
campaigns carried on from different national bases will become 
absolutely unwieldy for lack of adequate able management.  
     The expression of condolences which your Assembly conveyed 
to him at the time of the passing of Fred Schopflocher and 
Dorothy Baker, two dear and trusted Hands of the Cause who 
could ill be spared from their work at this time, touched him 
very much.  Others must now arise, and through their services 
seek to fill the gaps which such valuable workers have left in the 
vanguard of the &Baha'i host.  
     He would like you to express to the British pioneers on the 
home front, whose names you forwarded to him, his sincere 
thanks.  Their arising to protect the goals which have been won 
by other pioneers at a cost of such sacrifice and effort was noble 
and highly meritorious.  
     Speaking of pioneers, he was very pleased to hear recently that 
Mrs. &Shomais &Afnan had succeeded in gaining entry into 
Ethiopia.  Her perseverance in the face of a great deal of 
opposition is certainly exemplary.  
     As he already cabled you, he did not approve of the statements 
you had prepared for circulation amongst the Assemblies 
regarding &Baha'i marriage.  Some of the remarks were incorrect 
in the first place, and in the second place he is strongly against 
Statements!  He wishes the friends to keep as elastic as possible in 
administering the affairs of the Faith, while at the same time 
adhering to fundamentals.  He knows that at times this 
inconveniences the National Bodies and makes their work more 
detailed, but believes it to be the lesser, so to speak, of two evils.  
     He was very sorry to learn that dear Mr. Townshend's health 
is in such a precarious state, and necessitated the return of his 
daughter from Malta.  His devotion is so single-hearted and 
touching, and his determination to carry on at all costs is 
exemplary, and should inspire the young people to follow in his 
footsteps.  
     When compiling the list of African languages into which the 
&Baha'i Message should be translated, the Guardian realised that 
certain changes would probably be necessary--naturally the 
fewer the better.  In this connection, if you feel it advisable and 
not otherwise, he would like you to convey to Dr. Berry, of the 
African Department of the School of Oriental and African 
studies, his personal thanks for the valuable advice he has given 
 
+P334 
your Assembly, and his friendly co-operation.  You might also, 
at your discretion, extend his thanks to any other members of 
the Staff who have assisted you.  
     He is very pleased that the Temple land has been bought in 
Kampala.  Mr. and Mrs. Elston are visiting here at the present 
time; and he has told them he feels that at present the Temple 
land should merely be held in trust, and all meetings continue in 
the &Haziratu'l-Quds building.  Should this eventually prove too 
small, enlarging one of the rooms to accommodate more of the 
people at the meetings might be considered as a possibility; but 
any work carried out must be of a very economical nature, and 
he does not think it is pressing at present, anyway.  
     I need not tell you that the work in Africa, and more 
particularly in Uganda, is very dear to his heart.  The progress 
made there during the last year has borne him up and encouraged 
him greatly when he was often weighed down with work.  He 
feels that this country and its peoples, in the very heart of Africa, 
are a most precious trust.  Their receptivity to the Teachings, 
their great desire to serve their new Faith, the number of them 
who have arisen to go out as pioneers, mark them as a people 
apart in the &Baha'i world, at least for the time being.  May many 
others in neighbouring countries prove as worthy, and follow 
their example.  
     In dealing with people who are still backward in relation to 
our civilised standards, and in many cases guided by a tribal 
system which has strong orders of its own, he feels that you 
should be both tactful and forbearing.  There is no specific 
minimum age mentioned in the &Baha'i teachings at which girls 
may marry.  In the future, this and other questions unspecified 
will be dealt with by the International House of Justice.  In the 
meantime, we must not be too strict in enforcing our opinions 
on peoples still living in primitive social orders.  
     The difficulty of getting a &Baha'i into ... has now been 
temporarily solved.  The Guardian does not see why &Baha'is 
should have to state to any Government that the reason for their 
visit to a country is for the purposes of teaching the &Baha'i Faith.  
Most of the time, though not perhaps invariably, this is calculated 
to arouse suspicion and opposition.  One has to deal with cases as 
they arise.  A blanket rule could never apply over so wide a field 
as that in which &Baha'i pioneers are working.  
 
+P335 
     Although the children of &Baha'i parents are considered to be 
&Baha'is, there is no objection at the present time, for purposes of 
keeping a correct census, and also ascertaining whether the 
young people are, sincerely, believers, and willing to do their 
share in service to the Faith, to asking them to make a declaration 
of their intention at the age of fifteen or so.  Originally, the 
Guardian understands, this was adopted in America to enable 
young &Baha'i men to make certain arrangements in connection 
with their application for non-combatant status upon their 
attaining the age of military service.  There is really nothing 
about it in the Teachings or in the Administration.  Your 
Assembly is free to do as it pleases in this matter.  
     Regarding the publication of a pamphlet on the &Baha'i 
Teachings on Monarchy, funds and circumstances permitting, 
the Guardian sees no objection to this whatsoever.  It might 
appeal to a certain type of British mind very much, though he 
fears there are other minds to which it may not appeal!  However, 
considering &Baha'u'llah has taught these things, there is no reason 
why we should not share them with those interested in the 
subject.  
     He is very sorry that it has not been possible to purchase the 
National &Haziratu'l-Quds yet.  In spite of the fact that he attaches 
great importance to this, he does not think that the cost should 
become exorbitant merely in order to accomplish a goal before 
a certain date.  The &Baha'is, not only in England, but all over the 
world, have embarked upon a Plan which will involve over a 
period of years a very heavy expenditure.  Undoubtedly they 
will have to help each other; but they will scarcely have the 
financial strength to help each other to the tune of extremely 
expensive buildings, Temple sites, etc., in different parts of the 
world.  He has given instructions to Canada, Germany, Rome, 
etc., to cut down on the proposals they made to him, because the 
price of these things in different parts of the world, when added 
up, would be well beyond the means of the Faith to meet at 
present.  He feels sure that, however painful and toilsome the 
process may be, you will eventually find a suitable spot in 
London, and one that your Assembly, with the help of the 
British believers and other possible contributions from outside 
as well, can afford.  
     The remarkable achievements in the pioneer field, a field in 
 
+P336 
which your own Assembly has been far from backward, are a 
source of great encouragement to all the believers as well as to 
him.  The addition of one hundred countries during one year is 
certainly history-making.  
     Now that the back of the foreign pioneering work has been 
broken, so to speak, a greater measure of attention must be paid 
to the home fronts.  The consolidation work, though far less 
spectacular, constitutes a very weighty task, and will require a 
constant measure of sacrificial effort if the goals are to be fulfilled.  
He thinks that during the coming year greater attention should 
be paid to the home front, while at the same time maintaining 
the pioneer posts at their present standard, at least.  
     The principle is, and it should be impressed on the minds of 
all pioneers, to hold their territory at any cost.  Just because they 
have left their homes, and gone out and carried the Faith to one 
of these virgin areas, does not mean that the task is accomplished.  
On the contrary, nothing could be sadder than that these newly-won 
territories should be lost after a few months' effort.  He 
hopes that in your correspondence with the pioneers you will 
impress this fact upon them and make them realise that to be a 
"Knight of &Baha'u'llah" is not only a very high and pleasant 
position, but involves a truly tremendous responsibility.  To 
remain at one's post, to undergo sacrifice and hardship, loneliness 
and, if necessary, persecution, in order to hold aloft the torch of 
&Baha'u'llah, is the true function of every pioneer.  
     Let them remember Marion Jack, who for over twenty years, 
in a country the language of which she never mastered; during 
war and bombardment; evacuation and poverty; and at length, 
serious illness, stuck to her post, and has now blessed the soil of 
the land she had chosen to serve at such cost with her precious 
remains, every atom of which was dedicated to &Baha'u'llah.  
Perhaps the friends are not aware that the Guardian, himself, 
during the war on more more than one occasion urged her to 
seek safety in Switzerland rather than remain behind enemy 
lines and be entirely cut off.  Lovingly she pleaded that he would 
not require her to leave her post, and he acquiesced to her 
request.  Surely the standard of Marion Jack should be borne in 
mind by every pioneer!  
     Regarding your question about including the Tablet of the 
Virgin in a compilation of "&Baha'i Scriptures" which you wish 
 
+P337 
to publish--the old translation is very poor and has many 
inaccuracies.  However, the Guardian has no time at all to 
retranslate it or correct it himself.  
     He leaves it to the discretion of your Assembly as to whether 
you wish to include it in a compilation or not.  
     I am returning to you the list you sent with suggested 
corrections in relation to the pamphlet your Assembly published 
last year--"The &Baha'i Faith 1844-1952, Information Statistical 
and Comparative".  The righthand column marked "Suggested", 
he considers quite acceptable.  The places where you have put 
question marks are correct, with very few exceptions which the 
Guardian has corrected, in the column marked "As Listed", with 
the exception of the transliteration of the name &Shu'a'u'llah, 
(Number 12) which the Guardian has corrected.  
     Assuring you of the Guardian's loving prayers for the success 
of your devoted labours....  
     P.S.  July 28th.  Your letter of July 7th has likewise been 
received.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The achievements of the members of the tenacious, the valiant and 
wide-awake British &Baha'i community, within the borders of their 
homeland and beyond its confines, in the course of the opening year of 
the &Baha'i World Crusade, deserve the highest commendation and 
have considerably heightened its prestige and deepened my own 
admiration for it as well as that of its sister communities in both 
Hemispheres.  
     Called into being through the dispensations of a watchful 
Providence, in the middle of the memorable decade that witnessed the 
introduction of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah into the Western world; 
sharing with its sister community across the Channel the distinction 
of being the first to be quickened by the life-giving influences generated 
by the newly-established Covenant of &Baha'u'llah in the Holy Land; 
the recipient of untold blessings showered upon it by the Centre of the 
Covenant in the days of its infancy; singled out among the newly-fledged 
communities in both Europe and the North American 
Continent through the twice repeated visits of &Abdu'l-Baha to the 
shores of its homeland; fully equipped with the agencies of a divinely 
conceived Administrative Order, patiently and laboriously erected by 
its stalwart members in the years immediately following the setting of 
 
+P338 
the Orb of that same Covenant; enriched by the experience derived 
from the successful prosecution of two successive nationwide Plans 
formulated by its national elected representatives, this community 
finds itself, on the morrow of the termination of the opening year of the 
afore-mentioned Crusade, simultaneously firmly rooted within the soil 
of its homeland and vigorously branching out on the first stage of its 
mission in foreign fields, and exhibiting, both at home and abroad, 
evidences of a development that bids fair to eclipse any of its collective 
achievements in the past five decades since its inception.  
     In both the teaching and administrative spheres of its ever-expanding, 
swiftly unfolding activities, whether in the heart and 
capital city of the Empire to which it belongs, or in the chief cities 
recently opened by its pioneering members in the territories comprising 
its island home, or in the diversified and far-flung dependencies of the 
British Crown in the African Continent, this virile, forward 
marching, securely established community has amply demonstrated its 
capacity to be regarded as one of the chief strongholds of a divinely 
conceived Faith and one of the principal bastions sustaining the fabric 
of &Baha'u'llah's world-encompassing Order.  
     Standing as it does on the threshold of the second phase of a Crusade 
with which its immediate destinies are inseparably linked, and to 
which it has voluntarily and enthusiastically pledged its combined 
resources, the tasks now confronting it demand a degree of concentration, 
dedication, co-ordination, resourcefulness and perseverance 
hitherto unequalled in any period of its career.  
     The prizes won in recent months, since the launching of the Ten 
Year Plan to which it stands committed, through the strenuous 
exertions and the shining example of its pioneers in the islands situated 
to the North, the West and the South of its homeland, as well as in the 
far away territories lying in the heart of the African Continent and 
situated on both its eastern and western shores, must, however great 
the sacrifices involved, be preserved.  The acquisition of the national 
&Haziratu'l-Quds in a centrally located area in a city that ranks as the 
chief metropolis of a vast Empire is yet another task of the utmost 
urgency and of the highest significance, the consummation of which 
should be considered as the chief objective and pre-eminent duty of this 
community's elected national representatives, and one which is bound 
to exert, in the days immediately ahead, a far-reaching and pervasive 
influence on the growth and unfoldment of the Faith which it is their 
privilege to serve and promote.  
 
+P339 
     Of no less importance is the responsibility to reinforce the structure 
of the Administrative Order throughout the British Isles, and 
particularly in the newly opened territories of Scotland, Wales, Eire 
and Northern Ireland, through a rapid and unprecedented increase in 
the number of the avowed supporters of the Faith, and a multiplication 
of isolated centres, groups and assemblies that constitute the warp and 
woof of the fabric of its evolving Order.  
     A no less urgent task, which will directly reinforce this fabric, and 
heighten the prestige of the Faith itself, and pave the way for the 
establishment of &Baha'i local endowments, is the prompt incorporation 
of firmly established local assemblies, a process which, as soon as it is 
initiated, must gather steady momentum throughout the length and 
breadth of the British Isles, and be ultimately reinforced by the 
incorporation of all local assemblies destined to be established in the 
virgin territories recently opened in the neighbourhood of the British 
Isles and in the African territories allotted to your Assembly under the 
provisions of the Ten Year Plan.  
     Special attention should, moreover, be paid to the no less vital duty 
of completing the translation, the publication and the dissemination of 
&Baha'i literature in the languages assigned to your Assembly, in 
accordance with that same Plan, an achievement which will greatly 
stimulate the work to be undertaken in the course of the future phases 
of this world spiritual Crusade as it unfolds itself in the African 
Continent.  
     Whilst these highly meritorious enterprises are being assiduously 
carried on, the inescapable and sacred duty of consolidating the nine 
African territories and the two additional ones in Europe and Asia 
must be adequately discharged, in order to enable the British &Baha'i 
community to bring to full fruition the noble mission entrusted so 
confidently to its care.  
     The tasks facing this community in the course of this second and 
future phases of a world-encircling Crusade are admittedly vast, 
complex and challenging.  The resources at the disposal of its doggedly 
persevering, wholly dedicated members are, alas, circumscribed and 
inadequate.  The Mission, however, to which its Founder is calling it, 
is unspeakably glorious.  Many and divers will, no doubt, be the tests, 
the setbacks and trials which teachers and administrators alike within 
the ranks of its members, must necessarily experience.  The times, 
during which the opening phase of its Mission overseas is to yield its 
fairest fruit, are fraught with great peril.  Both at home and in distant 
 
+P340 
outposts of the Empire, the opposition which those responsible for its 
development and consolidation will encounter from those in authority, 
whether civil or ecclesiastic, will progressively hamper their efforts.  
The competition from its own sister communities, in various regions 
of the globe and in the course of the systematic prosecution of the same 
world-embracing task will, in the meantime, grow keener.  
     Every ounce of energy its members can muster must unhesitatingly 
be expended to further the supreme end for which so sacred, so 
formidable and so momentous a Plan has been devised.  With every 
sacrifice that is made, with every forward step that is taken along the 
toilsome and long road they are destined to tread, with every victory 
dearly and laboriously won by the champions, the representatives, the 
vanguard, the spokesmen, as well as the rank and file of this 
community, a measure of blessing from on high will undoubtedly be 
vouchsafed, in order to reinforce the exertions, cheer the hearts, and 
stimulate the march of all those enlisted in the service of so glorious a 
Cause.  
     The hour is propitious for a concerted effort which in its scope and 
intensity will surpass any united action of which the British followers 
of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah have proved themselves capable in the past.  
     That they may ascend from height to height, go forward from 
victory to victory, is the fervent prayer of one who has invariably 
followed the course of their exploits with undiminished confidence and 
admiration, who has cherished the brightest hopes for the ultimate 
attainment of their Mission, and whose love and esteem for them has 
correspondingly increased with every revelation of the capacities and 
energies with which they have discharged, and are constantly 
discharging, their Mission.  
                                    Your true brother,

Dear John:  
     Thank you for your letter of June 15th, with regard to Dar-es-Salaam.  
     The Guardian attaches very great importance to the "incorporation" 
and "exemption" of any Assembly; likewise the 
acquirement of any endowments.  
     Therefore, if you have not already sent directly to the 
Guardian a photostatic copy of the Exemption granted the Dar-es-Salaam 
Assembly, I would like to suggest that one be sent to 
him through me.  
     Likewise if anything constructive develops with regard to the 
burial ground at Dar-es-Salaam, please let me know as soon as 
possible....  
 
 
22 July 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     ...The Guardian has instructed me to write your Assembly, 
calling attention to the manner in which questions of teaching 
activities in new areas and consolidation areas assigned to any 
Assembly, are carried out.  
     The National Spiritual Assembly is the Body which is charged 
with the administrative responsibility of the tasks of the Ten 
Year Crusade.  Neither the Hands of the Cause nor their Boards 
have administrative responsibilities in connection with this 
work.  
     The members of the Boards are to report to the Hands of the 
Cause in the area regarding all situations, and of course in detail 
concerning any problem, so that the National Assembly may 
take appropriate action.  
     The Hands of the Cause themselves will correspond with the 
National Spiritual Assembly involved, calling their attention to 
the problem, so that the National Assembly may take appropriate 
action.  
     The Guardian has instructed that the Hands of the Cause are 
not to correspond with the committees of the National Spiritual 
 
+P342 
Assemblies, but directly with the National Spiritual Assemblies 
themselves.  
     The beloved Guardian greatly values the outstanding work 
which your Assembly is doing.  He will pray for your continued 
success.  He sends you his loving greetings....

Dear &Baha'i Co-workers:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to inquire of your 
Assembly what the situation is surrounding the translation and 
publication of &Baha'i literature into the following languages:  
 
                               Erso 
                               Gaelic 
 
     These are not languages of the Ten Year Crusade, but 
languages which have been translated prior to the opening of the 
Ten Year Crusade.  He is very anxious to know what the status 
is of these translations and publications.  If no work has been done 
on them, he would urge that you have the work undertaken at 
an early date....  
 
 
8 March 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very anxious to secure as quickly as 
possible data concerning the &Haziratu'l-Quds which have been 
acquired in connection with the goals of the Ten Year Crusade.  
To this end, he would very greatly appreciate your sending me 
by return air mail the information concerning the &Haziratu'l-Quds 
in London.  
     He would like to know the area of land involved, the size of 
the building, so far as number of rooms is concerned, the original 
purchase price of the &Haziratu'l-Quds, the expenses of the 
transaction, and then the total cost.  
     The Guardian asks that this be sent to me by return airmail....  
 
 
29 March 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     On April 21st we will enter the last year of the second phase 
of the Ten Year Crusade.  As you know, one of the objectives of 
this second phase was the rapid multiplication of Assemblies, 
Groups and Centres throughout the world.  
 
+P345 
     During the past year, a great deal has been accomplished by 
the friends in their efforts to disperse from the large centres of 
population in order to build up the goal cities and establish new 
centres.  However, we have not accomplished a great deal in the 
way of increasing the number of &Baha'is, nor the number of 
Spiritual Assemblies.  
     The beloved Guardian sincerely hopes you will make it a 
point of major study and consideration on the part of your 
Assembly, so that the entire community may lend itself to the 
accomplishment of this great goal during the coming year.  
Foundations must be laid for many more Assemblies.  The friends 
must disperse from the large centres of population.  Our teaching 
work must become so sanctified and penetrating that many, 
many souls will be confirmed.  The friends should go forward on 
this great task in a very determined manner in order to establish 
as many new Assemblies during the coming year as are possible.  
     In letters which have come to the beloved Guardian, he has 
noted the friends feel there is no need to establish new Assemblies 
until 1963.  
     The Ten Year Crusade ends in 1963; but as many of the goals 
should be won as quickly as possible.  It should certainly be clear 
to all of the friends that we cannot hold off on winning the 
various goals of our tasks until the last year of the Crusade.  They 
should be won just as quickly as possible.  Furthermore, there are 
many tasks of the Crusade which the Guardian is not launching 
until preliminary goals have been won.  For instance, it would be 
impossible to establish National Assemblies in all of the areas 
proposed until there are more &Baha'is, more Groups and more 
Assemblies in those countries.  On the home front, further tasks 
are dependent upon the winning of victories now.  The Guardian 
hopes the keynote of the teaching work on the home front 
during the current year will be the dispersion of the friends on 
an unprecedented scale, and the winning of as many Assemblies 
as is possible....

Dear John:  
     In order not to keep the Assembly waiting for an answer, the 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you this letter in 
reply to yours of April 15th.  
     The principle is wherever the &Baha'i laws at the present time 
conflict with the civil law of the country, the believers living in 
it must obey the civil law.  
     The &Baha'is in England, as regards divorce will consequently 
have to follow British law, and in conjunction with this, as far 
as possible, uphold the &Baha'i law of divorce as well.  The way the 
details of this are to be worked out is left entirely to the discretion 
of your National Assembly....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has been greatly enthused the last few

is the word that Spiritual Assemblies have been established in 
Mogadiscio, in Italian Somaliland and Djibouti in French

Somaliland.  This leaves the only Somaliland without an

appreciate your Assembly giving consideration to this matter, to 
see if there is any way that a pioneer could go from England to 
British Somaliland, to firmly establish the Faith there.  He 
understands fully the problems involved.  
     A copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. &Banani, Hand of the 
Cause, so that he might give consideration to the possibility of 
having some native &Baha'is from Uganda move to British 
Somaliland, and either teach or settle there.  
     The beloved Guardian assures your Assembly of his prayers 
on your behalf.  He sends you his loving greetings....

in Persia at present should meet with success.  I do hope all goes

Dear &Baha'i Brother,

September 17 (two) and 27, October 13, 16 (two) and 26,

May 9, 12 and 27, June 8 and 9, July 5 (four), 11 and 14, 1955, 
with enclosures, also the material sent separately, have been 
received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     The matters taken up by cable I will not go into again here in 
detail.  
     It has been a great source of satisfaction to him to receive here 
last winter two members of the National Body, Mr. and Mrs. 
John Ferraby, as well as more than one believer from England.  
The contact with the British &Baha'is always pleases him greatly.  
As you know, he admires many of the staunch British qualities 
very much, and is proud of the accomplishments of this 
community during recent years.  
     He has been pleased over the progress made in the teaching 
field abroad and at home; in the publication of &Baha'i literature 
in African languages; and, above all, by the purchase of the 
National Headquarters in London, and the formal dedication of 
the building, recently held.  He feels sure that, now that the 
National Assembly has a befitting seat for its national affairs--a 
building which at the same time will solve the problem of the 
London Spiritual Assembly, through giving them a meeting-place--
the work in both London and throughout the country 
will receive a new impetus.  With every important step forward 
there is a new release of spiritual energy; and the founding of the 
National &Haziratu'l-Quds is certainly a most important milestone 
in the progress of the Cause in the British Isles.  
     As regards various questions raised in your correspondence 
with him, he sees no reason why the Publishing Trust should 
have a separate legal status, as long as it is not essential for it to do 
so.  
     He approves of returning to Ronga as one of the languages 
into which &Baha'i literature should be translated, according to 
the provisions of the Ten Year Plan, and giving up Shangaan.  
     He would like very much to receive photostats of the actual 
Certificates of Incorporation issued to the London and Manchester 
and Liverpool Assemblies, to be placed in the Mansion 
of &Baha'u'llah.  
     He does not think your Assembly need take any action about 
 
+P350 
removing archives or other material from London.  If, at a future 
date, the world situation reaches the point where it is obvious 
that things in London are in great danger, then your Assembly 
should consider the matter.  Fortunately, that is not the case at 
present.  
     Any monies received from the sale of the property bequeathed 
by Mrs. B ... can be used by your Assembly as it sees fit.  
     As he already pointed out to the Secretary, when he was in 
Haifa, a National Endowment is at the present time to be 
considered more in the nature of a token endowment.  It need 
not be in the capital, and can represent a very small investment; 
indeed as little as one thousand dollars, if a suitable piece of 
property for that price should be found, would be acceptable.  
     He was very sorry to hear of the tragic death of Mrs. Langdon-Davies.  
She was a capable, staunch and devoted member of the 
community and of the National Assembly as well; and her 
services will be missed by her co-workers, and particularly the 
friends in Oxford.  He prays for the progress of her soul in the 
&Abha kingdom, and that she may be rewarded for her labours in 
this world, performed with so much zeal and steadfastness.  
     He hopes that Mr. John Mitchell's condition has improved.  
He was very sorry indeed to hear that he had been forced to 
leave Malta.  Please assure him of the Guardian's loving and 
fervent prayers on his behalf.  
     As regards the question of &Baha'is belonging to churches, 
synagogues, Freemasonry, etc., the friends must realise that now 
that the Faith is over a hundred years old, and its own institutions 
arising, so to speak, rapidly above-ground, the distinctions are 
becoming ever sharper, and the necessity for them to support 
whole-heartedly their own institutions and cut themselves off 
entirely from those of the past, is now clearer than ever before.  
The eyes of the people of the world are beginning to be focussed 
on us; and, as humanity's plight goes from bad to worse, we will 
be watched ever more intently by &non-Baha'is, to see whether 
we do uphold our own institutions whole-heartedly; whether 
we are the people of the new creation or not; whether we live 
up to our beliefs, principles and laws in deed as well as word.  We 
cannot be too careful.  We cannot be too exemplary.  
     There is another aspect to this question which the friends 
should seriously ponder, and that is that, whereas organisations 
 
+P351 
such as Freemasonry may have been in the past entirely free 
from any political taint, in the state of flux the world is in at 
present, and the extraordinary way in which things become 
corrupted and tainted by political thought and influences, there 
is no guarantee that such an association might not gradually or 
suddenly become a political instrument.  The less &Baha'is have to 
do, therefore, with such things, the better.  
     He wishes you to thank ... on his behalf for the spirit of 
devotion to the Faith which he has shown in connection with 
this matter.  He feels sure that he will see the necessity to sever 
himself from his previous association with Freemasonry.  The 
older &Baha'is, through their example in such matters, form 
rallying points around which the younger &Baha'is, not so steady 
yet on their spiritual legs, so to speak, can cluster.  
     If you send him five copies of everything published in the 
British Isles, it will be sufficient for the libraries here at the 
World Centre....  
     The Africa Committee should carefully consider such 
problems as that of the Negro pioneers being too long apart 
from their wives; and, if no other solution is feasible, the pioneer 
will have to return to his family.  In the case of some of the very 
distinguished servants of the Faith who have arisen and gone 
forth from Uganda to pioneer, this would indeed be a loss to the 
work.  If their wives could go and join them, it would naturally 
be preferable.  This is a matter for the committee in consultation 
with your Assembly and the Hand of the Cause, &Musa &Banani, 
to decide.  
     Undoubtedly the most important task facing the British 
community at the present time, is to increase its membership.  It 
has performed miracles during the past ten years, through 
shifting around devoted volunteers from one centre to another, 
in order to maintain or to create Spiritual Assemblies; but, 
efficacious as this has been in the past, it is certainly not a 
permanent solution to the problem.  The only solution is to 
bring in more &Baha'is.  This requires patient, prayerful, ceaseless 
efforts on the part of, not only the &Baha'i teachers and pioneers, 
but every single member of the community.  The British people 
are traditionally slow to move.  Fortunately, once they do move, 
it's almost impossible to stop them; but to overcome the inertia 
requires great effort.  In bringing new people into the Faith, the 
 
+P352 
friends always come up against this problem.  He urges all the 
&Baha'is, however, not to become discouraged, but to persevere 
and redouble their efforts, knowing that they can and must 
succeed in the end.  He, on his part, will reinforce their efforts 
with his prayers in the Holy Shrines....  
     As regards your question about depleted Assemblies, as there 
is nothing in the constitution of the National Spiritual Assembly 
covering these matters, every National Body is free to make its 
own decision as to what the status of an Assembly is from one 
annual election to the next, if they fall below nine for any reason.  
     As regards certain matters raised in your recent letters:  
     Your Assembly is free to choose the place for the endowment 
for the East and Central N.S.A. if you feel Uganda inadvisable.  
     The delegates reaching the Conventions in Africa is a matter 
for each N.S.A., from whose area of jurisdiction they are elected, 
to arrange and provide financial help if needed.  
     A prisoner, showing sincere faith in the Cause, may be 
accepted as a &Baha'i on the same basis of investigating his 
qualifications as to belief as any other individual outside prison.  
Each case should be carefully considered on its own merits.  
Naturally, a person in confinement cannot be active in any 
community and administrative work.  When he gets out, he 
becomes part of the community in which he resides.  No new 
ruling is required in this matter.  All other details in relation to 
prisoners can be decided by the N.S.A. concerned as they arise.  
     The Guardian feels that, though it is naturally preferable, it is 
not essential for consolidation territories to have a group by 
&Ridvan, 1956....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
      The contribution made, since the inception of the world-wide &Baha'i 
Crusade, severally as well as collectively, by the assiduously striving, 
clear-visioned, inflexibly resolved, and unswervingly faithful members 
of the British &Baha'i community to the progress and development of the 
Ten Year Plan, inaugurated on the morrow of the centenary 
celebration of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's Mission, has been such as to 
excite the heartfelt admiration of their fellow-workers in every 
continent of the globe.  The prestige of this valiant community has 
soared rapidly, its annals have been notably enriched, the foundations 
on which its fortunes now rest have been considerably reinforced, 
 
+P353 
whilst the variety and solidity of its administrative achievements have 
won the unstinted praise of its sister communities in both the East and 
the West.  My own feelings of unqualified admiration for the tenacity 
of the faith of its members, for their unrelaxing vigilance, their 
unfailing sense of responsibility and their willingness to sacrifice in 
order to meet any challenges that confront them, have deepened with 
every advance they have made, and every victory they have won along 
the path leading them towards the fulfilment of their destiny.  
     The historic triumph achieved as a result of the successful prosecution 
of the Six Year Plan, spontaneously embarked upon by this 
numerically small yet richly endowed, spiritually resourceful community, 
on the morrow of the hundredth anniversary of the founding of 
the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, followed immediately by the initiation of a 
Two Year Plan which marked the inauguration of this community's 
Mission beyond the confines of its homeland, culminated in the formal 
association of its members with their brethren in every continent of the 
globe for the launching and prosecution of a decade-long world-embracing 
crusade, destined to carry that same community through yet 
another stage, of the utmost significance, in the fulfilment of its world-wide
and glorious mission among the widely scattered territories of the 
British Crown in no less than three continents of the globe.  
     The extension and consolidation, in the course of more than a 
decade, of the administrative base established so painstakingly for the 
prosecution of this community's far-flung mission, through the 
formation and multiplication of isolated centres, groups and local 
assemblies throughout the length and breadth of England, Wales, 
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Eire; the opening of the virgin islands 
lying in the neighbourhood of these territories and forming a part of 
the British Isles, constituting a most welcome and much needed 
reinforcement of the Administrative Structure raised so valiantly and 
patiently by its members in their island home; the magnificent success 
surpassing, in its quality and scope, the fondest expectations of the 
elected representatives of this community, which attended the spiritual 
conquest of a number of African territories, situated along the Western 
and Eastern shores of that continent and its very heart; the settlement 
of pioneers in two Mediterranean islands; the selection and purchase 
of a befitting national administrative headquarters situated close to the 
heart of the capital city of the British Empire; the acquisition of a plot 
in the outskirts of the capital city of Uganda, situated in the heart of 
the African continent, to serve as the site for a future &Baha'i House of 
 
+P354 
Worship; the rapid advancement in the translation and publication of 
&Baha'i literature in the thirty-one African languages, allotted, under 
the Ten Year Plan to the elected national representatives of this same 
community; the steady progress made more recently in the incorporation 
of firmly established local assemblies; the formation of the Israel 
Branch of the British National Assembly at the world centre of the 
Faith in Israel--these stand out as the most prominent and significant 
evidences of the uninterrupted development of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah 
under the wise leadership, and through the assiduous and incessant 
exertions, of the elected national representatives of this virile 
community.  
     The year that has recently opened, constituting the second and last 
year of the second phase of a Ten-Year global crusade, must witness 
a development and consolidation of the activities already initiated, in 
both the teaching and administrative spheres of &Baha'i endeavour, as 
swift and as notable as the progress already achieved in recent years.  
Time is indeed short.  The responsibilities shouldered by the members 
of this community are manifold, pressing, sacred and inescapable.  The 
eyes of the entire &Baha'i world are upon them, eager and expectant to 
witness feats as superb as those that have marked the birth and 
establishment of the Administrative Order of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah 
in the British Isles, and exploits as meritorious and significant as those 
that have accompanied the inception and progress of the mission 
entrusted to His British followers, on the morrow of the emergence of 
that Administrative Order in their homeland.  
     The process aiming at the rapid increase in the number of the 
avowed and active supporters of the Faith must continue unabated in 
the months immediately ahead.  A simultaneous multiplication in the 
number of isolated centres, groups and local assemblies must be ensured 
in order to reinforce the agencies on which the rising administrative 
structure of the Faith must ultimately rest.  The process of incorporation 
must likewise be strenuously stimulated for the purpose of strengthening 
legally, and enhancing the prestige of, these rising institutions.  The 
newly opened territories forming part of the British Isles, situated in 
the Mediterranean, in the Atlantic Ocean, along the western and 
eastern coasts of Africa, and in its very heart, must be continually 
reinforced, and the prizes won in those distant fields safeguarded, 
however great the sacrifice involved.  The establishment of national 
&Baha'i endowments in the British Isles is yet another task which, ere 
the termination of the current year, must be accomplished, as a prelude 
 
+P355 
to the establishment of a similar endowment in the continent of Africa 
following the emergence of the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
&Baha'is of Central and East Africa.  
     Above all, the most careful consideration should be given to the 
measures required to ensure the emergence of the afore-mentioned 
National Assembly in the heart of the African continent, marking the 
culmination of the efforts so diligently exerted, and the fruition of 
the enterprises so painstakingly inaugurated, since the formation of the 
Two Year Plan by the British &Baha'i community.  
     The emergence of this institution, signalising the erection of yet 
another pillar of the Universal House of Justice in the African 
continent, and constituting the first fruit, yielded on foreign soil, of the 
Mission entrusted to the British followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, 
and which may be hailed as a worthy counterpart of the central 
Administrative Institution established, on the morrow of &Abdu'l-Baha's 
Passing, in the heart of the British Isles, will be acclaimed by 
posterity as a milestone of far-reaching significance in British &Baha'i 
history.  It will proclaim to the entire &Baha'i world the maturity of the 
swiftly rising, highly promising, steadily consolidating British &Baha'i 
community.  Every British follower of the Faith, whether in his home 
islands or overseas, must feel proud and deeply grateful for the 
impending consummation of so superb and momentous a victory.  
Every energy must be lent to ensure a befitting celebration of such an 
enduring and magnificent achievement.  
     The efforts of the members of this community must indeed be 
redoubled, nay trebled, as they view with afflicted hearts the tragic 
trend of events transpiring with such dramatic and sudden swiftness in 
&Baha'u'llah's native land.  The tribulations suffered, over so wide a 
field, by so many of their co-religionists, under circumstances so 
appalling and harrowing in their nature, at the hands of redoubtable, 
pitiless, barbarous adversaries, should spur them on to still greater 
endeavours in a land blessed with freedom of religion and tolerance, 
and occupying so conspicuous a position among its sister nations.  
     Theirs is an opportunity which they must instantly grasp.  Theirs 
is a responsibility which they cannot escape.  Theirs is the duty to 
offset, by the quality of their achievements, the dire losses which are 
now being sustained in the cradle of the Faith.  That they may in every 
field and at all times discharge their heavy responsibilities is my 
constant prayer and dearest hope.

Dear John, 
      I am writing you this at the instruction of the beloved 
Guardian.  
     As you will have no doubt seen by his recent cable, he has 
come to the historic decision to build a Temple in Africa, in 
Kampala.  He has been in communication with Mr. &Banani about 
this, and from reports received it appears there will be no 
objections.  The land must be surveyed (this is being done), and 
design of the building submitted so as to meet health and 
building requirements.  
     The Guardian wishes your Assembly to please get busy at 
once and have a design, or designs, made for the building; it is 
not necessary to try in any way to copy the Wilmette Temple:  
the things that are essential are the following:  
 
     1.  A nine-sided building.  
     2.  A dome, in proportion to the building.  
     3.  A seating capacity between 300 and 500; you could count 
     floor space at 300 or 400 and provide a balcony around the 
     auditorium for expansion in seating capacity.  
     4.  No "chapels" or small rooms should be added; this was a 
     misapprehension held in the old days.  
 
     As to materials your Assembly and architect can go into that, 
but brick or cement would be all right.  Stone would seem to be 
out of the question.  
     It should not be too expensive or pretentious, but dignified 
and worthy.  
     There is no reason why the architect should be a &Baha'i--in 
fact your use of someone there would get it done faster, probably.  
The imperative thing is to send preliminary drawings to the 
Guardian within two months, if possible.  
     The terrible situation in Persia makes him most anxious to 
have this project go forward speedily.  He feels funds will not be 
too much of a problem if great costs are not involved.  
     He sends you and all N.S.A. members his loving greetings....  
 
 
+P357 
30 August 1955 
 
     The beloved Guardian has received the clippings from English 
newspapers and read them with keen interest; he attached 
much importance to such publicity in journals of such high standing....  
     Regarding your questions--
     It is permissible to use selections from the "Promulgation of 
Universal Peace" in compilations.  
     Better omit the prayer of the &Bab you mentioned.  
     The Guardian does not feel the present status of London, 
regarding its assembly, should be changed.  Other cities should 
have their assemblies based, as usual, and already adopted in 
other countries, on the civil limits of the city in question....

Dear John:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write and inform 
your Assembly of the following:  
     The National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa 
should be elected by 76 delegates, which is four times nineteen.  
This number should be apportioned amongst the spiritual 
assemblies within the countries the future N.S.A. will represent.  
 
+P358 
He leaves an equitable distribution of the number of delegates to 
the Assemblies, to your Assembly to decide.  
     The British N.S.A. certainly has its work cut out for it in the 
near future, what with this historic convention in the offing and 
a Temple to be built!...

     The drawings for the Temple in Kampala have reached the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf regarding their suitability.  
     Frankly, he was very discouraged by these drawings, as he 
feels that such an ultra-modern style is wholly unsuitable for a 
 
+P359 
&Baha'i Temple....  It seems to him that the modern influence is 
now so strong and widespread that it is out of the question to get 
a discreet and dignified building designed for our purposes.  
     ...He is sorry to disappoint your Assembly, and regrets the 
time, trouble and expense which has been involved in finding a 
design.  
     As he cabled your Assembly he also feels that to seek a new 
Temple site is unwise; from descriptions received at the time of 
its purchase it seems satisfactory, and there is enough land around 
it for possible expansion in the future....  
     He feels therefore that until your hear from him you (had) 
better take no further steps as regards a design for Kampala.

Dear John:  
     This is just a note on behalf of the beloved Guardian to answer 
the point raised in one of your recent letters.  
     You say that in Irish, the word "&Bab" is not appropriate to be 
used; and as the word "Gate" is not as nice in translation in any 
language, he suggests that in place of the word "&Bab", you use 
"Herald"....  
     P.S.  The Guardian approves your sending "Advice to &Baha'is 
in British Colonies" to other N.S.A.'s, but feels it is not necessary 
to send a copy to the Colonial Office itself.  He feels teaching 
work in Uganda should now be concentrated on consolidation, 
primarily.  
     The Guardian's decision regard Mr. ... design is final; it is

temple....

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your loving letter of December 1st has been received.  
     The Guardian attaches the utmost importance to the 
development of the Faith in the Pacific Islands.  Wherever an 
opportunity opens for expansion of the work in one of the 
Islands, he feels that opportunity should be seized and exploited 
to the fullest extent.  Thus, if it is possible for anyone to proceed 
to the Solomon Islands to assist the Blums there, it would be 
very, very helpful.  
     As the Guardian understands the situation, the Blums have 
not left the Solomon Islands, but are expanding their business 
and service.  Thus the work which Mr. Blum previously engaged 
in, of driving a taxi, is now open to someone else; and therefore 
the pioneer to go to the Solomons would find a position waiting 
for him.  
     The Guardian understands that the Blums are very well 
thought of and respected throughout the Solomon Islands.  
     I am sending a copy of this correspondence to the Persian 
N.S.A., and encouraging them to send pioneers to the Solomon 
Islands.  You may wish to also correspond with them....  
 
 
15 December 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write you in 
connection with the translation of &Baha'i literature into languages 
as called for by the Ten Year Crusade.  
     31 languages have been assigned to your Assembly; and of 
these, 24 translations have been made or are under way.  The 
Guardian feels this is a very fine record, and one of which you 
may be proud.  
     At the same time he feels special effort should be made to 
complete the translations.  He has no record of translations of 7 
languages.  Will you please send me a letter for him, indicating 
what the status of each of these languages is....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has directed me to write you in 
connection with the purchase of an endowment for East Africa.  
     As you know, a contribution has been made by the Hand of 
the Cause, Mrs. Amelia E. Collins, of One Thousand Dollars for 
the purchase of the endowment for Kampala.  The Guardian feels 
a small piece of property which can be bought for this One 
Thousand Dollars should be procured at once, so that this goal 
of the Ten Year Crusade can be concluded.  He feels that you 
should at once buy a small plot of land in Uganda, at a cost of 
approximately One Thousand Dollars.  The American N.S.A. 
will remit the funds as you direct.  
     Will you please let me know just what can be done in 
connection with this project?  
     The Guardian sends the members of the National Assembly 
his loving greetings, and assures them of his prayers in their 
behalf....

11 July 1956 
 
Dear John, 
     As a number of questions raised in your communications 
addressed to the beloved Guardian have been answered by cable 
or through the Assistant Secretary, I will not go into these 
matters here, but merely acknowledge on his behalf receipt of 
the letters from your National Body, together with their 
enclosures and material sent under separate cover which were 
dated as follows:  July 22, August 8, 9, 11 (two), 12 (two), and 
18, September 7, 9, 10, 23 (three), 26 and 28, October 7 (two), 
13 (two), 25, 26, 28 (two), and 29, November 3, 4, 9, 21 (two), 
24 and 30, December 1, 2, 9 (three), 19 and 29 (two), 1955, and 
January 6, 10, 17, 23, 27, and 30 (two), February 10, 16, and 27, 
March 8, 9, 19, and 29, April 2, 10, 13, 16, 17, and 26, May 4, 
14, 16, 31, and June 13, 19, 22, and 29, 1956.  
     He appreciated receiving copies of the Diary which your 
Assembly forwarded to him, and which is invariably gotten out 
efficiently and in a pleasing manner.  He thinks the five copies 
you sent will be sufficient.  
     The generous spirit in which the British &Baha'is, hard-pressed 
as they are to meet the requirements of the work in Great 
Britain, responded to the needs of their persecuted brethren in 
Persia, deeply touched him.  These evidences of &Baha'i sacrifice 
and solidarity cannot but nourish the very roots of the Faith and 
strengthen its institutions.  
     As he advised you by cable, he felt it unwise to seek to clarify 
the relationship of the &Baha'is to the advertised holding of 
Ahmad Sohrab's conference in Jerusalem.  Having a very shrewd 
eye to his own advantage, it has become obvious that one of the 
means by which he hopes to promote interest in his conference 
is to arouse active opposition from the &Baha'is and create a source 
of discussion in the press.  In view of this, the Guardian has been 
very careful to have the friends avoid rising to this bait.  They 
should, in their personal contacts with people, and in a quiet 
 
+P365 
manner, point out when occasion arises that the Caravan 
activities have nothing whatsoever to do with the &Baha'i Faith 
and are indeed unfriendly to it.  Whatever he does cannot but 
end in failure, because he has cut himself off entirely from the 
living tree of the Faith and is wholly insincere in his motives.  
     In spite of the fact that Mr. ... has been expelled from Gilbert 
and Ellice Islands, the remarkable progress of the Faith there has 
been a source of great satisfaction.  It shows that a spiritual 
receptivity, a purity of heart and uprightness of character exists 
potentially amongst many of the peoples of the Pacific Isles to an 
extent equal to that of the tribesmen of Africa.  It is indeed an 
encouraging and awe-inspiring sight to witness the spread of our 
beloved Faith amongst those whom civilised nations misguidedly 
term "savages", "primitive peoples" and "uncivilised nations".  He 
hopes that your Assembly will do all in its power to ensure that 
Mrs. ... remains in the Islands.  Although for some period at least 
this may entail separation from her husband, he believes that 
these two dedicated and exemplary pioneers will be willing to 
accept this sacrifice in view of the extraordinary work they have 
accomplished and are accomplishing.  The community there 
must not be abandoned, particularly by its "mother", so to speak.  
It must be well and profoundly grounded in the Faith before 
such a risky step can be taken.  He hopes that you will deal most 
wisely and co-operatively with the Colonial Office officials in 
this matter and any others that may arise.  Their esteem, their 
good-will, and their co-operation are practically indispensable 
for the future work in many islands throughout the Pacific area, 
and nothing but the frustration of our objectives can be gained 
through alienating them in any way.  This should be impressed 
upon the pioneers and the local &Baha'is as well.  
     The beloved Guardian regrets very much the entire situation 
in which the dear Hand of the Cause, Mr. Townshend, finds 
himself.  He is much loved, and his services have been of a unique 
nature in providing the Faith with so many excellent books, the 
latest of which the Guardian hopes will soon be ready for 
publication....  
     The persecution of the Faith last year in Persia, although no 
doubt a great trial to the Persian believers, can be regarded in no 
other light than as a triumph.  The designs of the traditional 
enemies of the Faith, the &mullahs, have been entirely frustrated.  
 
+P366 
The Government has been forced to take action for the first time 
in its history to officially protect the &Baha'is and their institutions 
and the Cause of God has received a publicity all over the 
world--entirely free of charge--which an expenditure of many 
thousands of pounds could not have secured for it.  
     In spite of the great anxiety and pain which the crisis of last 
summer caused the Guardian, he could not help being highly 
gratified that, for practically the first time, publicity of a weighty 
nature was given to the Faith in such papers as the "Spectator", 
the "Observer", "The Times" and the "Manchester Guardian", 
and that the voices of two such distinguished scholars as Professor 
Gilbert Murray and Professor Arnold Toynbee were raised in 
defence of the believers of &Baha'u'llah and His Faith.  This has 
opened the door on a new phase of the unfoldment of the Faith 
in the British Isles.  However slow the process may seem, the first 
inklings of its emergence as a public force can now be 
discerned....  
     The loss of some of the Spiritual Assemblies in England this 
year need not be viewed as an unduly horrible experience.  It was 
inevitable that the British &Baha'i community would have to get 
itself, once and for all, grounded on the same basis as all other 
&Baha'i communities, namely, that of having Spiritual Assemblies 
function within defined civil limits.  Although this seems to have 
dealt a set-back to the work, it is purely temporary.  The localities 
have perforce been increased, which is a step in the right 
direction, and which cannot but widen the foundation of the 
Administrative Order.  In those islands more members of the 
community will be given the opportunity to serve on local 
Assemblies and their committees; and above all, the new crisis 
which developed because of this change-over once more 
demonstrated the truly extraordinary and exemplary steadfastness 
of the British &Baha'is which had led them, over and over 
again, at great cost to themselves, to throw themselves into the 
breach.  Although this is a well-known national characteristic, it 
provides nevertheless a great example to their &fellow-Baha'is all 
over the world.  The Guardian knows of no community, east or 
west, which so valiantly and so consistently, one might almost 
say ferociously, has arisen to defend its Home Front.  He has the 
greatest admiration for the spirit which animates them and for 
their achievements.  
 
+P367 
     He was sorry to refuse the request of the National Assembly 
to, under certain circumstances, permit the localities that would 
achieve Assembly status by next &Ridvan, to have a delegate at the 
National Convention.  He feels that, although this would no 
doubt have provided a great stimulus to the friends, it was an 
unjustifiable breach of the general administrative procedure.  If 
there are too many exceptions, the rule has a tendency to lose its 
clearly defined character, not to mention encouraging other 
communities to want to be exceptions too, under various 
circumstances!  
     The Guardian hopes that during the coming year there will be 
more Assemblies incorporated, as he attaches great importance 
to this process.  
     He was delighted that the Irish translation had been completed, 
and also very happy to hear that the National Endowment for 
the British National Spiritual Assembly had been purchased.  All 
these signs of life and vitality are greatly to be admired, and 
prove the intense virility and youthfulness of the British &Baha'i 
community.  
     He was sorry to have to disappoint Mr. ... who was so 
enthusiastic about his own design for the Temple.  However, 
there was no possible question of accepting something as extreme 
as this.  The Guardian feels very strongly that, regardless of what 
the opinion of the latest school of architecture may be on the 
subject, the styles represented at present all over the world in 
architecture are not only very ugly, but completely lack the 
dignity and grace which must be at least partially present in a 
&Baha'i House of Worship.  One must always bear in mind that 
the vast majority of human beings are neither very modern nor 
very extreme in their tastes, and that what the advanced school 
may think is marvellous is often very distasteful indeed to just 
plain, simple people.  
     The Hand of the Cause, Mr. Remey, has now completed a 
design for the Kampala Temple which meets with the Guardian's 
approval.  It will shortly be ready to be forwarded to the Central 
and East Africa National Assembly.  
     It was a great pleasure for Shoghi Effendi to have a number of 
pilgrims from the British Isles as his guests this winter.  They 
brought with them the spirit of perseverance and devotion so 
clearly evinced by the British believers; and he feels sure that, 
 
+P368 
upon their return, they carried back much of inspiration and 
encouragement to the friends at home.  
     Not the least of the landmarks reached on the international 
&Baha'i scene this year has been the formation of the three new 
National Bodies in Africa.  Your Assembly and the community 
you represent have every reason to look with pride and affection 
upon the development of the Cause in the African continent, and 
upon the many spiritual children and grandchildren, and perhaps 
great-grandchildren you have over there.  The record has been 
truly astonishing, and such as to gladden the heart of &Abdu'l-Baha 
Who so ardently longed, Himself, to go forth "on foot" and 
carry the Message to yet another of the far corners of the world.  
     No doubt although the Central and East Africa Assembly is 
a strong one, it will still welcome and need at least a large 
measure of moral support from its parent; and he feels sure that 
you will always be ready and willing to help in any way you can 
with advice and suggestions, and perhaps teachers and pioneers 
and other support as opportunity affords.  (As he informed you 
when you were here, he does not feel the British National 
Spiritual Assembly can support financially its Central and East 
Africa one.  However, a token contribution would be a kind and 
appropriate gesture.)  In any case, you should keep in close touch 
with the work there, a work dear, not only to the Guardian's 
heart, but to all of yours as well.  
     As regards certain questions raised in your letters:  There is no 
objection for the time being in going on including in Prayer 
Books the Prayer of the &Bab:  "In the Name of God, the Victor 
of the Most Victorious", etc.  
     As regards the question raised in Africa about divorce 
connected with adultery, these are matters for the future.  No 
action of any new kind should be taken at present.  
     As regards strikes, the Guardian feels that your own 
understanding of the matter as expressed in your letter is quite 
correct, and he does not see the necessity of adding anything to 
it.  We should avoid becoming rigid and laying down any more 
rules and regulations of conduct.  
     Regarding taking oaths, there is nothing in the Teachings on 
this subject.  As a &Baha'i is enjoined by &Baha'u'llah to be truthful, 
he would express his truthfulness, no matter what the formality 
of the law in any local place required of him.  There can be no 
 
+P369 
objection to &Baha'is conforming to the requirements of the law 
court whatever they may be in such matters, as in no case would 
they constitute in any way a denial of their own beliefs as &Baha'is.  
     Concerning the short obligatory Prayer:  the Guardian does 
not wish to define these things at present; the time will come for 
it in future.  The friends need not be too strict about it at present.  
The Greatest Name is &Allah-u-Abha.  
     He remembers you and all the N.S.A. members in his prayers 
most lovingly, and supplicates for your success and that strength 
may be given you to discharge your many important duties.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The emergence of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is 
of Central and East Africa, under such auspicious circumstances, and 
after the lapse of such a short period of time since the inception of the 
Ten Year Plan, marks a milestone of far-reaching significance in the 
unfoldment of the great historic Mission entrusted to the British 
&Baha'i community in the vast and far-flung territories beyond the 
confines of its motherland.  It is, moreover, a striking evidence of the 
exemplary and whole-hearted devotion of its members to that Mission, 
and of the vigour, the vigilance, the resourcefulness, the tenacity and 
the courage with which they have conducted this vast and magnificent 
enterprise launched in the heart of that continent, in the face of various 
obstacles and with such limited resources at their disposal.  The entire 
community, now standing on the threshold of still greater and nobler 
enterprises in other parts of the world, and particularly its national 
elected representatives, who have so splendidly discharged their 
responsibilities overseas, and assumed with characteristic resolution, 
fearlessness and consecration the direction of the manifold activities of 
so dynamic an enterprise, must be heartily congratulated on so 
conspicuous a victory, won in such a distant field, within so brief an 
interval, at the cost of so much sacrifice, by so limited a number of 
pioneers, labouring amidst a people so divergent in language, customs 
and manners.  
     Its sister communities in both the East and the West, and 
particularly its daughter communities, now blossoming into new life, 
and marching forth, unitedly and resolutely, along the path traced for 
them in the Ten Year Plan, cannot but feel proud of the tremendous 
work first initiated in the heart of Africa by British &Baha'i pioneers, 
and of the organising ability, the sound judgement, the unquestioning 
 
+P370 
fidelity, and the dogged determination that have characterised every 
stage in the rise, the development and fruition of the first collective 
enterprise embarked upon beyond the confines of the British Isles by 
the British adherents of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  
     Though much of the responsibility hitherto discharged by your 
Assembly, in both the heart of the continent and the territories situated 
on its Eastern and Western shores, will now devolve on the newly 
established Regional Spiritual Assemblies, the particular Mission you 
have been called upon, through the dispensation of Providence to fulfil, 
is by no means concluded.  Every assistance within your power, 
particularly in matters requiring the aid, support and intervention of 
the authorities at the Colonial Office, and in connection with the 
translation of &Baha'i literature into African languages, their 
publication and dissemination, as well as with any publicity that can 
be given in the British press to the marvellous achievements of the 
numerous &Baha'i communities recently raised up in Africa, and now 
energetically discharging their manifold and sacred duties all over that 
continent--such assistance should be constantly and unstintingly 
extended to these newly fledged communities which the power of the 
Most Great Name has called into being at so crucial a period in 
human history, and at so auspicious a stage in the mysterious 
unfoldment of God's Plan for all mankind.  
     While this beneficent, slowly maturing, irresistibly advancing 
enterprise develops and gains momentum, through the concerted and 
tireless efforts of its original organisers in the British Isles and those in 
charge of its immediate destinies in Africa itself, a corresponding 
endeavour, no less consecrated, persistent and enthusiastic, should be 
exerted in the Islands of the Mediterranean and the Far East, where 
similar exploits must needs be achieved by those who have performed 
such unforgettable feats among the Negroes of the African continent.  
     Parallel with this highly vital and urgently needed exertion in 
foreign fields, a further intensification of effort is required on the 
homefront, and particularly throughout the newly opened islands 
bordering the homeland itself, now standing in such dire need of a flow 
of pioneers and a concentration of material resources unexampled in 
British &Baha'i history.  There is no reason to doubt that the phenomenal 
progress achieved within the span of a few years, amidst an alien 
people, and in such distant and backward territories, will be duplicated, 
nay surpassed, among people of the same race, speaking the same 
language, of the same background, and living in such close proximity 
 
+P371 
to the Administrative Centre in the British Isles, provided that a 
determination no less unyielding, and a dedication no less whole-hearted 
and complete, will be displayed by those who have already won 
such memorable victories in such far-off and inhospitable regions of the 
globe.  He Who in recent years infallibly guided from His realms above 
the steps of the little band of pioneers and administrators under such 
difficult and challenging circumstances, Who galvanised their souls, 
blessed their handiwork, raised their status, and noised abroad their 
fame, can well enable them, if they but arise to the occasion now 
presenting itself, to conquer with no less rapidity and even greater 
effectiveness, the citadels of men's hearts, to tear down the barriers 
which now confront them, and ignite a fire in the hearts of their own 
countrymen as consuming as the one that has set ablaze, in so 
conspicuous a fashion, the souls of the African races over the length 
and breadth of an entire continent.  
     The rapid increase in the number of the avowed supporters of the 
Faith, the multiplication of groups, isolated centres and assemblies 
within the limits of the homeland and its neighbouring islands, must 
be accompanied by a marked acceleration in the process of internal 
consolidation, such as the incorporation of firmly established local 
Assemblies, expansion in the publication and dissemination of &Baha'i 
literature, and the adoption of carefully considered measures aimed at 
giving a still wider publicity, among circles hitherto unapproached, or 
as yet inadequately informed of the tenets, the aims and purposes, as 
well as the world-wide achievements of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in 
both the teaching and administrative spheres of its activities.  
     The highly gratifying and truly praiseworthy success which has 
attended, so unexpectedly, the energetic efforts exerted by your 
Assembly in connection with the campaign of publicity initiated for 
the purpose of safeguarding the rights of our oppressed brethren in 
Persia must be regarded as a most encouraging sign, and should 
constitute a prelude and a stepping-stone to a still wider undertaking, 
aimed at a more systematic presentation of the ideals animating our 
beloved Cause and of its fundamental verities, and an adequate 
proclamation of its God-given mission to this distracted, sadly erring, 
and increasingly tormented generation.  
     The annals of the British &Baha'i community, small in numbers, yet 
unconquerable in spirit, tenacious in belief, undeviating in purpose, 
alert and vigilant in the discharge of its manifold duties and 
responsibilities, have in consequence of its epoch-making achievements 
 
+P372 
been vastly enriched.  The process set in motion and greatly accelerated 
through the successive formulation of the Six Year Plan, the Two 
Year Plan and the Ten Year Plan, must continue unabated and 
unimpaired.  Nay with every passing day it must gather momentum.  
Every individual believer must, henceforth, encouraged and inspired 
by all that has already been achieved, contribute to its future and 
speedy unfoldment.  That the entire community may befittingly 
respond to the call of the present hour and bring to a final consummation 
the Mission with which it has been entrusted is the deepest yearning 
of my heart and the object of my unceasing prayers.

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of 16 &Mashiyyat 113, with enclosures, has been 
received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     He is most hopeful that the second week-end school will 
prove as successful and fruitful as the one held in February 
apparently was.  
     The Guardian is delighted over the progress being made in 
Northern Ireland.  He greatly admires the tenacity and spirit of 
dedication of the believers living in the British Isles, and is 
confident the friends in your region will unitedly bend all their 
energies toward the fulfilment of the goals they have set their 
hearts on attaining by next &Ridvan.  
     Rest assured of his loving prayers for you all....

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write to your 
Assembly, with regard to the Tristan da Cunha Island.  
     Earlier in the Ten Year Crusade, one of the English &Baha'is 
offered to settle in this Island, in order to establish the Faith there.  
At that time, the Guardian felt we must concentrate on the goals 
of the Crusade only.  Now, however, the Friends have won so 
many victories, and the goals of the Crusade are being gained 
currently, early in the Crusade, he feels supplementary areas may 
be settled--and for that matter, supplementary activities engaged 
in.  
     Thus, if this friend still wishes to settle in the Island of Tristan 
da Cunha, he would welcome it being done.  
     If only the home front would surge ahead, then the Crusade 
would surely be moving ahead of the schedule.  Let us pray those 
at home will arise with the same dedication, and consecration as 
the valiant pioneers, causing a new life to be manifest on all 
home fronts.  
     The Guardian sends the members of your Assembly his loving 
greetings....

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     Your loving letters concerning contributions to the Shrine of 
the &Bab Fund, and the International Fund, have been received by 
the Beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge 
them on his behalf.  These contributions from the Friends in 
England, and the Friends in the Seychelles, are greatly appreciated 
by the Guardian.  Receipt is enclosed.  Will you please, on behalf 
of the Guardian express his appreciation to Mr. & Mrs. ... and 
the devoted friends in the Seychelles.  
     The Guardian has been deeply touched by the continuing 
victories being won by the friends in the Seychelles.  
     The Beloved Guardian also wishes the dear Friends in England 
to know of his deep appreciation of their consecration, and their 
sacrifices for the Faith.  This noble spirit cannot do other than 
attract the blessings of the Holy Spirit, which will assure victory.  
He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and for the success 
of your many labours.  
                                    He sends you his loving Greetings....

To the &Baha'is who were present at the Birmingham Teaching 
Conference, January 5th 1957.  
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of greeting, 
and was very happy to hear that the Birmingham Teaching 
Conference had been such an outstanding success.  
     Undoubtedly the Faith in the British Isles is making steady 
and sound progress, and he hopes that during the coming months 
many of the Spiritual Assemblies which have been placed in 
jeopardy will be consolidated in time for the elections.  He feels 
sure that the British &Baha'is, who have done more pioneering per 
capita than any other &Baha'i community in the world, will do all 
in their power to safeguard the precious goals they have won at 
the cost of so much sacrifice and valiant endeavour.  
 
+P375 
     He assures you one and all of his loving prayers for your 
success, and that he will remember you in his visits to the Holy 
Shrines....  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain you in your highly 
meritorious labours, guide every step you take in the path of service to 
His Faith, and enable you to lend a great impetus, in the days to come, 
to the onward march of our beloved Cause throughout the British Isles 
and to the consolidation of its divinely appointed institutions, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your 
Assembly with regard to showing interior views of the Shrine 
of &Baha'u'llah in slides.  
     The Guardian read in some minutes, or in a report of one of 
the Summer Schools, that slides were shown of the Holy Land, 
and among them one of the interior of the Shrine.  He would like 
to know whether this is the interior Garden, or the Inner Shrine 
itself, and whose slides they are.  
     He feels that the Shrine of &Baha'u'llah and the &Bab are so 
sacred, it is improper for any slides to be shown of the Interiors.  
Thus, the slide which was shown at the Summer School should 
be destroyed, and if it forms a part of any sets of views of the 
Holy Land, this slide be removed from the set.  
     He sends you his loving Greetings....

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you 
concerning a list which he desires, showing the languages into 
which the scriptures, or parts of them have been translated.  
     He has the book entitled "The Gospel in Many Tongues" 
issued by the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Bible House, 
146 Queen Victoria Street, London, E.C.4, (in 1948).  This shows 
specimens of 770 languages in which this Society has published 
or circulated some portion of the Gospel.  
     In the preface, they state "If those versions published by other 
agents are included, there are now well over a thousand forms of 
speech represented in the Library at Bible House".  
     The Guardian would like to secure a list of the additional 
some 300 languages into which the Gospel has been translated, 
referred to in this quotation.  Could you secure it for him, from 
the Bible Society, at the Bible House.  
     Is it fair to assume this would then be all the languages, from 
any source, into which the Bible or parts have been translated?  
Your early advice will be appreciated.  
     For your information, in the list of languages into which 
&Baha'i literature has been translated, there are some 20, not 
included in the published book of the 770 languages into which 
Christian Scripture has been published, as covered by the Book.  
     The question is, are these 20 included in the supplementary 
list, which makes the 1,000 or more into which Christian 
Scripture has been translated.  Your sending the list will enable 
us to make the check here.  
     If you could secure this list and send it promptly, it might 
enable the Guardian to include this interesting point in his 
Convention message....

Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     The Beloved Guardian has been very deeply impressed with 
the latest book of our dear departed co-worker, Hand of the 
Cause, George Townshend.  
     He feels that this Book should be used as the basis of a very 
active campaign of teaching and publicity throughout the British 
Isles.  
     Publicity regarding the book should be arranged, book 
reviews secured, if possible.  Religious leaders should be sent 
copies, even the highest Ecclesiastical leaders.  Many copies should 
be mailed to the important leaders of the Church of England, 
and other religious denominations of the British Isles.  
     This book very finely presents the relationship between Christ 
and &Baha'u'llah, and outlines the manner in which the &Baha'i 
Faith is setting up the Kingdom of God, which the Christians are 
praying for.  
     The Guardian feels that very beneficial results will be achieved 
by this active public programme, with this book, "Christ and 
&Baha'u'llah" even if it stirs up opposition and criticism for the 
time being.  
     He will pray for your Assembly, and for the success of your 
many labours in the Cause of God....

to learn of this situation, but disapproves of it in the strongest

     Any &Baha'i may attend a Feast, a local &Baha'i, a &Baha'i from out 
of town, certainly an isolated &Baha'i from the neighbourhood.  
     It is the duty of the ... Assembly to take strong measures to

     As a number of questions raised in your letters have been 
answered by cable or through the National Assembly Secretary, 
I will not go into those again here.  
     He was interested to see the Tablets which Dr. Moayad located 
in Cambridge, and appreciated having copies of them.  
     It has been a great pleasure to have had so many members of 
the British &Baha'i community here last winter and spring as 
pilgrims.  
     He is immensely proud of the work which has been 
accomplished during the last year, of the remarkable spirit of 
dedication which animates the entire community, and which 
invariably produces, at an hour of crisis, a strong and healthy 
reaction on the part of the community to rush reinforcements to 
its weak Assemblies, when they are in danger of dissolution.  
     He realises that the enforcement of the general rule that an 
Assembly must function within civic limits has caused considerable 
havoc in Britain, as well as other countries.  However, it 
enables the friends, through splitting up into smaller communities, 
to have before their eyes the appetising prospect of forming 
yet another Spiritual Assembly, all on their own, so to speak.  It 
gives more believers the opportunity to serve on these 
Administrative Bodies, challenges the teaching activities of them 
all, and stimulates them to fresh efforts in the hope of early 
victory.  
     The news of the success of your Convention this year; the fact 
that the community was able to manoeuvre its finances into a 
position of equilibrium, a position, incidentally, which it should 
make every effort to maintain; the large number of friends who 
attended the beautiful memorial meeting held for the dear Hand 
of the Cause, George Townshend, also pleased and encouraged 
our beloved Guardian.  
 
+P382 
     He was pleased to hear from Rhodesia of the incorporation of 
the Salisbury Assembly, which seems to be in the nature of a 
foundation for the future incorporation of all Spiritual Assemblies 
throughout the Rhodesias.  This is yet another valuable service 
which your Assembly has been instrumental in rendering the 
Faith in Africa.  
     He thanks your Assembly for the coloured photographs of the 
&Haziratu'l-Quds and also for the film of the Summer School 
which you sent him.  He was very pleased also to receive copies 
of the Irish pamphlets, and hopes the Gaelic translation will soon 
be out.  
     As regards your question about printing in books the approval 
of the National Assembly, he thinks that, if in certain 
circumstances this seems inadvisable, there is no objection to 
omitting it.  The approval of the National Body should be sought 
for all &Baha'i publications, so as to protect the Faith from 
unofficially disseminating information which may in some 
respects be false or inaccurate.  Once this has been done, it is not 
so essential for the fact to appear in the book, if it will mitigate 
the effects of the book and decrease its sales....  
     The death of the Hand of the Cause, George Townshend, is a 
great loss to the British community as it not only deprives them 
of their most distinguished member, their unique Hand, but also 
of a most inspiring and faithful co-worker and a distinguished 
&Baha'i author.  His latest book has been read with great interest 
by the Guardian, and he hopes your Assembly is ensuring its 
wide distribution to various religious leaders in Britain.  If 
opposition to the Faith can be aroused through this book, it will 
be the greatest service that dear George Townshend has ever 
rendered.  It was always his hope that, through his pen, sparks 
would fly and begin the conflagration in whose light the Faith 
would shine forth in all its splendour.  Let us hope that this last 
service of his will indeed prove to be the vital spark setting off 
this process of opposition which will inevitably lead to a wide 
recognition and acceptance of the Faith.  
     The Guardian hopes that during the present year the home 
Assemblies will not only be maintained and groups prepared for 
assembly status next &Ridvan, but that it will be possible to 
reinforce the work in the islands off the shores of the British Isles.  
The sooner a nucleus of local people is established in these goal 
 
+P383 
places the sooner will the pioneers be able to move on to new 
fields and to lend their assistance to the teaching work either on 
the Home Front or in the Pacific area.  
     Please assure the dear pioneers that he greatly admires their 
steadfastness of purpose, their self-sacrifice and their exemplary 
spirit, and that he particularly prays for them in the Holy Shrines.  
     As regards the future work in the Pacific:  It is entirely 
premature at this time for your Assembly to think about the 
work there.  The Home Front and the work in the neighbouring 
islands around Great Britain, as well as those allotted under the 
Ten Year Plan to your Assembly in the Mediterranean, must 
receive the concentrated attention of your Body, its Committees 
and the believers.  When the time comes to become active in the 
Pacific area, you may be sure he will let you know!  
     He feels that the urgent need now is to get out "Some 
Answered Questions", which is one of the most important books 
for a proper study of the Faith.  When this has been printed, the 
next publication of the Master's Works can be considered....  
     As to your question about the words used in the marriage 
ceremony; the two versions mean practically the same thing, 
and either may be used.+F1  
     It is most regrettable that the Caravan should have gotten 
hold of ...; if this situation is stirred up too much it will only 
enable Ahmad Sohrab to make a big fuss and get more publicity.  
In view of this the Guardian feels your Assembly should be 
watchful and seek out, if possible, a suitable person and a suitable 
opportunity to call to her attention the facts that the &Baha'i Faith, 
so widely spread and acknowledged, has nothing to do with the 
Caravan which is a purely opportunist organisation and so 
loosely knit together as to have almost no power of influencing 
people one way or another.  To do the wrong thing in a situation 
such as this would be worse than to do nothing.  
     He assures you one and all of his loving prayers for your 
success in all you do for the Faith.  

          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The year that has just elapsed, following upon the swift and 
 
+F1 The two versions are:  "We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God", and 
+F1 "Verily we are content with the Will of God".  
 
+P384 
spectacular success achieved by the firmly grounded, the progressive 
and alert British &Baha'i community in the heart of the African 
Continent--a success attested by the triumphant emergence of the 
Regional Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Central and East 
Africa--has witnessed a progress throughout the length and breadth 
of the Homefront, as well as in the northern islands in the 
neighbourhood of the British Isles, which, though not spectacular, 
nevertheless testifies to the earnestness, the devotion and the exemplary 
tenacity with which the members of this community are conducting, 
in all its aspects, the noble Mission entrusted to their care, and are 
grappling with the manifold problems involved in its prosecution.  
     This present and crucial year must be signalised in the annals of 
British &Baha'i history by a substantial measure of internal 
administrative consolidation and a noticeable expansion in the all-important 
teaching field, which will enable the members of this 
community, now standing on the threshold of a new and brilliant 
phase in the unfoldment of their Mission in foreign fields, to reinforce 
and broaden the base of their future operations beyond the confines of 
their native land.  
     The splendid work achieved, in such a short space of time, in a field 
so distant, and amongst a race so alien in its background, outlook and 
customs, must, if the significance of that Mission is to be properly 
assessed, be regarded as only a prelude to the series of future campaigns 
which the privileged members of the British &Baha'i community, 
residing and firmly rooted in the heart of a far-flung Commonwealth 
and Empire, will, if faithful to such a Mission, launch, in the years 
ahead, in the islands of the North Sea and of the Mediterranean, as 
well as in the remote territories situated in the Pacific area--campaigns 
which, in their range and significance, must throw into shade the feats 
performed in the African Continent.  
     To be enabled to rise to this occasion, to ensure the energetic, the 
systematic and uninterrupted conduct of so vast and diversified an 
enterprise, amidst peoples and races fully as promising, and even more 
remotedly situated, and presenting them with a challenge more severe 
than any which has faced them in the past, the small band of the 
ardent, the high minded, the resolute followers of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah, charged by Destiny and by virtue of the enviable position 
they occupy, with so glorious a responsibility for the future awakening 
of the great masses, living under the shadow of, or whose governments 
are directly associated with, the British Crown, must needs in the 
 
+P385 
years immediately ahead, acquire greater coherence, increase more 
rapidly in numbers, definitely emerge from obscurity, plumb greater 
depths of consecration, enrich its store of administrative experience, 
become definitely self-supporting, and associate itself more closely, 
through the body of its elected representatives and its future Hands, 
with the National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies on the European 
mainland and in all the other continents of the globe, and particularly 
with the Hands already appointed in both the Eastern and Western 
Hemispheres.  
     The sooner these prime requisites, so essential for a further 
unfoldment of the mighty potentialities inherent in so splendid a 
Mission, are fulfilled, the sooner will the call be raised for the opening 
of a new chapter in the history of British &Baha'i achievements overseas.  
     The rapid multiplication of isolated centres, groups and local 
assemblies, particularly in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and 
Eire; the incorporation of firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies; 
a greater measure of publicity; a wider dissemination of &Baha'i 
literature; a quick and substantial rehabilitation of the vitally 
important national Fund; a firmer grasp of the essential verities of the 
Faith; a more profound study of its history and a deeper understanding 
of the genesis, the significance, the workings, and the present status 
and achievements of its embryonic World Order and of the Covenant 
to which it owes its birth and vitality--these remain the rock-bottom 
requirements which alone can guarantee the opening and hasten the 
advent, of that blissful era which every British &Baha'i heart so eagerly 
anticipates, and the glories of which can, at present, be but dimly 
discerned.  
     Now, of a certainty, is not the time for the members of this gallant 
band, so thinly spread over the length and breadth of its island home, 
and reaching out, so laboriously yet so determinedly to the inhospitable 
islands fringing its northern and western coasts, to dwell, however 
tentatively, on the nature of the tantalising task awaiting them in the 
not distant future, or to seek to probe into its mysterious, divinely 
guided operation.  Theirs is the duty to plod on, however tedious the 
nature of the work demanding their immediate attention, however 
formidable the obstacles involved in its proper execution, however 
prolonged the effort which its success necessitates, until the signs of its 
ultimate consummation, heralding the launching of what is sure to be 
the most spectacular phase of their Mission, are clearly discerned.  
     A responsibility, at once colossal, sacred and highly challenging, 
 
+P386 
faces not only the body of the elected representatives of this community, 
but each and every one of its members.  As the world spiritual Crusade, 
to the successful prosecution of which the British followers of the Faith 
of &Baha'u'llah have, singly and collectively, so markedly contributed, 
approaches its mid-point, the evidences of this indispensable quickening 
of the tempo of &Baha'i activity all over the British Isles and the islands 
situated in their neighbourhood and far beyond their confines, must 
become more manifest and rapidly multiply.  The admiration and 
esteem in which a community, relatively small in numbers, strictly 
limited in resources, yet capable of such solid and enduring 
achievements, is held by its sister and daughter communities in every 
continent of the globe, far from declining must be further enhanced.  
The historic process originated as far back as the year which witnessed 
the formulation of the Six Year Plan on the occasion of the Centenary 
of the Declaration of the &Bab in &Shiraz, which gathered momentum, 
as a result of the inauguration of the Two Year Plan which followed 
the Centenary of the &Bab's Martyrdom in &Tabriz, which received a 
tremendous impetus, in consequence of the launching of the Ten Year 
Crusade, commemorating the centenary celebrations of the birth of 
&Baha'u'llah's Mission in &Tihran--such a process must, as the 
centenary celebrations designed to commemorate the Declaration of 
that same Mission in &Baghdad approaches, be so markedly accelerated, 
and yield such a harvest, as will astonish the entire &Baha'i world, and 
give the signal for the inauguration, by those who have so 
spontaneously set this process in motion, more than a decade ago, of a 
blissful era designed to carry the chief builders of &Baha'u'llah's 
embryonic World Order, throughout the unnumbered, the diversified 
and widely scattered Dependencies of the British Crown, to still 
greater heights of achievements in the service and for the glory of His 
Faith.  
     May they, as they forge ahead along the high road leading to 
ultimate, total and complete victory, receive as their daily sustenance, 
a still fuller measure of the abounding grace, promised to the believers 
of an earlier generation by the Centre of the Covenant, the Author of 
the Divine Plan, Himself, on the occasion of His twice-repeated visit 
to their shores, and which has been unfailingly vouchsafed to 
themselves, in the course of over three decades, since the birth of the 
Formative Age of the Faith and the rise of its Administrative Order 
in their homeland.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of April 12th, conveying such heartening news, 
was received by our beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me 
to answer you on his behalf.  
     He feels your Assembly, a hard-won prize, and occupying an 
important position as representative of the Faith in Northern 
Ireland, is one of the key assemblies in the British Isles, and he is 
immensely proud of your achievement in at last forming it.  
     You may be sure he will pray for your protection and success 
in the Holy Shrines, and that your numbers may increase in 
Belfast and your ship weather every storm triumphantly!  
                                    With loving greetings,

     May the Almighty bless sustain and guide you in your meritorious 
activities, remove every obstacle from your path and enable you to win 
still greater victories in the service of His glorious Faith.

Dear &Baha'i Friends,

he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     Now that you are six there (judging by your signatures), a 
mere three is required to enable you to reach your Goal and have 
your Assembly next April.  
     You may be sure that he will supplicate in the Holy Shrines 
that these three may be speedily found and the Assembly safely 
established in accordance with the present Plan.

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of April 21st reached our beloved Guardian after 
a long delay, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     The formation of your Assembly, in the face of so many 
difficulties, was indeed a noble achievement, and serves to prove 
that our struggles as individuals, often handicapped by the sense 
of our own inadequacy, are reinforced by the grace of &Baha'u'llah, 
Who enables us to achieve the seemingly impossible!  
     He urges you all to persevere in maintaining your Assembly, 
which forms one of the vital links in the &Baha'i chain, which will 
soon gird the British Isles, never to lose heart, and to redouble 
your teaching labours so as to ensure a broader foundation next 
year for your Assembly's election and thus guarantee its 
permanency.  
     His prayers will be offered for you, one and all, for your 
success and guidance.

are making to establish the Cause in Wales, and he wants you to 
know he admires your courage and determination, and most 
deeply values the dedicated spirit which animates you.  
     The news of your first public meeting was good news indeed, 
and he feels sure your perseverance and the strong backing which

important your work is to the progress of the Plan in the British

formation of your Assembly.  
     With an Assembly in Cardiff, in Edinburgh, and Dublin, the 
representative character of the Faith in the British Isles is fully 
established and the National body greatly re-inforced.  
     He fully realises the difficulties which have attended your 
work there, and which makes your victory all the more 
praiseworthy and precious.  He urges you to now courageously 
persevere in your work and ensure that Cardiff has, by next 
April, a stable membership from which to call on for the 
Spiritual Assembly's maintenance.  
     You may be sure that he will assist you with his prayers, and 
pray that each and every one of you may be protected and 
assisted in your devoted services to the Faith.

which we &Baha'is approach all minorities, also of our devout 
desire to share with such a talented race the glory of &Baha'u'llah's

     I was so pleased and grateful to receive your welcome letter, and the 
first fruit of your services and high endeavours for the promotion of our 
beloved Faith.  
     I feel proud of the spirit that animates you, and will supplicate the

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of July 18th with enclosure has been received by 
the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you 
on his behalf.  
     He is delighted with the way the work is progressing in 
Cardiff, and that there are now nine believers living there.  
     He particularly values the instant decision made during the 
Convention, and consequent action taken, by Dr. Miller+ in 
leaving an excellent medical practice in Liverpool, to settle in 
Cardiff, with all it entailed of sacrifice in being separated from 
his wife, and in being obliged to accept a junior post in a hospital 
at Cardiff.  It is qualities such as these, which the pioneer carries 
 
+P396 
to his new post, which attract a reinforcing power from on 
High, and enable him to create in the hearts of those who meet 
him a longing to have what he possesses, and ignite in these new 
hearts the flame of the love of &Baha'u'llah.  
     The Guardian feels sure his &non-Baha'i wife will likewise 
receive a blessing for her part in this sacrifice, which helped to 
make this move possible.  
     He is deeply appreciative of the Welsh translation; and is 
confident it will prove to be of great assistance in the promotion 
of the Teachings in Wales.  
                                    With warm &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah guide you and your fellow-members, 
and enable you, in the days to come, to reinforce the foundation that 
has been laid, and to extend the range of your highly meritorious 
exertions and accomplishments, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of December 29th was received, and the beloved 
Guardian was very happy indeed to hear that the week-end 
school had been a success.  
     He is delighted to see that the Faith is progressing in Wales, 
and he feels sure that the Welsh people will not only respond to 
the Message if given opportunity, but contribute to the Faith a 
distinctive share of their own, when they arise in its service.  
     He hopes that there will indeed be Welsh Summer Schools in 
the future.  
                                    Assuring you of his loving prayers, 
                                              With warmest greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, guide, and sustain you and your dear co-workers 
in your constant and highly meritorious activities, remove 
 
+P397 
every obstacle from your path, and enable you to enrich the record of 
your deeply appreciated services to His Faith and its institutions.  
                                    Your true brother,

To the believers who were present in Dublin at the 19 Day Feast 
of &Kamal 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Our beloved Guardian was very happy to receive your 
message and to see that the Cause is now gaining a firm footing 
in Eire.  
     He is particularly happy to welcome Mrs. Coleman into the 
Faith as the first new &Baha'i in Dublin, and he hopes that ere long 
you will be able to establish the first historic spiritual Assembly 
in that city.  
     The Irish are tenacious in their religious beliefs, and once 
convinced of the truth and significance of our glorious Faith 
should make ardent and devoted &Baha'is.  
     He assures you all of his loving prayers for the success of your 
devoted labours.  
                                    With warmest greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     Your joint message rejoiced my heart.  I cherish great hopes for the 
future of the work so splendidly initiated in that historic island.  I will 
pray from the depths of my heart for the extension and consolidation 
of your meritorious activities to which I attach the utmost importance.  
Persevere in your glorious task, and rest assured that the Beloved, 
Who is watching over you, will bless your high endeavours and fulfil 
your dearest hopes.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

The Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Dublin, Eire 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Our beloved Guardian was very delighted to receive your 
communication of April 21st, written to him from your newly 
elected body.  
     He was particularly pleased to read the signatures of three 
members of the Townshend family, as Mr. Townshend and his 
wife have truly sacrificed in order to stand forward as declared 
and active &Baha'is and assist in the formation of this historic 
Assembly.  
     The task facing you is great, but very exhilarating.  Eire lies 
before you, your territory, of which you are the Mother 
Assembly, and however difficult your conquest may be, it is a 
challenging and wonderful service you are called upon to render.  
     The Irish people, with their deep religious instinct, although 
they may be at first difficult to convert, once convinced of the 
truth, will make staunch believers and will, he hopes, convey 
this Faith, with all its promise and healing power, to other 
countries in the course of time.  
     He assures you his prayers are with you, for your progress and 
your success in every field of &Baha'i service.  
                                    With loving greetings, 
     P.S.  The delay in answering your letter was due to the long 
time it took to reach Haifa.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     The work achieved in Dublin during the last few months, 
culminating in the formation of the first Spiritual Assembly in Ireland, 
is indeed highly praiseworthy.  Such a consummation is an event that 
will adorn the annals of the Faith, and is in itself a prelude to still 
greater victories in the days to come.  I truly feel proud of the British 
and Irish believers who have collaborated so devotedly and strenuously, 
and won so conspicuous a victory.  I will fervently supplicate on their 
behalf, and will await eagerly the news of the progress of their historic 
achievements.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

The &Baha'i Group, Eccles 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of January 2nd was received, through the kindness 
of Mr. Gregory, and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
    He will certainly pray in the Holy Shrines that you may 
succeed in attaining your objective; but, even should you fail to 
establish a spiritual assembly by April, you must not feel 
discouraged, because it is much more important to have a solid 
foundation in the beginning than to meet a date line--welcome 
as the assembly would be!  
     He admires very much the spirit animating you, and hopes 
that a flourishing community will develop there.  
                                    With warm &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide your steps, aid you to 
extend the scope of your activities, and win great victories in the 
service of His glorious Faith, 
                                    Your true brother,

The Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Edinburgh 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Our beloved Guardian was very happy indeed to receive your 
letter to him dated April 21st--which has taken a long time to 
reach him, as you can see--and he has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     The formation of the first Assembly of the Faith in Scotland 
is a great and promising achievement.  He has a profound 
admiration for the characteristics of the Scots; their deep 
religious feelings, their frank, open and friendly nature, their 
tenacity and abilities will enable them to greatly enrich the Faith 
 
+P400 
in the British Isles, and, he hopes, later in the pioneer fields 
abroad.  
     He trusts that your Assembly, and especially those members 
of it who are natives of Scotland, will soon succeed in attracting 
many more serious minded truth-seekers to the Faith there.  
Now Edinburgh has become the mother Assembly of Scotland, 
and must, by its example, set the pace, and assist in the 
development of all future Scottish &Baha'i Assemblies.  
     He assures you all he will pray for your success, for your 
unity, and that &Baha'u'llah may guide you all in administering 
the affairs of His Cause in that city.  
     He was particularly interested to hear that one of the new 
believers had met &Abdu'l-Baha on His visit to Edinburgh many 
years ago.  
                                    With loving greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers, 
     Your welcome message brought deep joy to my heart and filled me 
with gratitude for this latest evidence of the all-conquering power of 
&Baha'u'llah, as well as for the magnificent efforts exerted by British 
believers in that historic and ancient city.  I will, I assure you, pray 
from the depths of my heart for your success, the increase of your 
numbers, the multiplication of your activities, and the consolidation of 
your achievements.  Persevere in your meritorious endeavours, and rest 
assured that the Beloved will watch over you and crown your high 
endeavours with signal success.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     As our beloved Guardian is at present very pressed for time in 
connection with the tremendous amount of work the building 
of the Shrine entails at this juncture, I am answering your loving 
&Naw-Ruz Message very briefly on his behalf.  
     You may be sure the work in Edinburgh is very dear to his 
 
+P401 
heart and he will continue to pray for its advancement, and for 
each and every one of you, in the Holy Shrines.  
                                    With warmest greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, continually and abundantly, your high 
endeavours, aid you to add to your numbers, deepen your understanding 
of the essentials of His Faith, extend the range of your activities, 
consolidate your achievements, and win great and memorable victories 
for its institutions, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

To the Glasgow &Baha'is 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter dated 5.7.50 has been received, and the beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     The progress being made in spreading the Faith in Scotland 
pleases him immensely, and he feels the Cause will find many 
exemplary and wonderful servants among the Scotch people.  
They may be slow to be convinced, but once they embrace a 
thing they do so with full conviction and great determination to 
serve their belief.  
     He will pray that your assembly may confirm many new 
souls, and thus gradually free the devoted pioneers, who went 
there to teach, for services in new and maybe distant fields.  
     You may be sure he deeply appreciates all you have done.  
                                    With loving greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers, 
     I was so pleased and grateful to receive your most welcome message, 
and I profoundly appreciate the noble sentiments you have expressed.  
I wish to assure you that I will pray for your success from the depths 
of my heart, that the Beloved may guide your steps, bless your high 
endeavours, and enable you to lend a tremendous impetus to the spread 
of the Faith in Scotland.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of February 20th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The Guardian was very happy to learn of your coming 
County Teaching Conference.  He has been very happy over the  
large number of pioneers who have arisen in the British Isles and 
have gone to new territories, both in the British Isles and in 
foreign lands, and he considers this a fine record.  
     He hopes your deliberations will produce a still greater effort 
on the part of all the friends to implant more deeply and scatter 
more widely the seeds of the Faith, which are so greatly needed 
everywhere.  
     The Guardian assures you of his loving prayers for the 
abundant success of your endeavours.

Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Liverpool 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter dated May 7 was received, and our beloved 
Guardian rejoiced over the news of the formation of your 
Assembly.  He would have answered you sooner had he not been 
so overpowered with not only the work connected with the 
arcade of the Shrine's completion, but also anxiety caused by the 
long and serious illness of Mr. Maxwell, its architect.  
     He trusts your Assembly will enlarge its community during 
this year, and thus strengthen its foundations and ensure its 
future activities.  
 
+P403 
     The victory won in the British Isles filled his heart with pride, 
and encourages him to believe a brilliant future lies ahead of the
community there.  
                                    With warmest greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:]

     Your most welcome message cheered my heart, and I wish to assure 
you in person of my sincere and profound admiration for the spirit that
animates you in your activities, as well as of my ardent prayers for 
you, that the Beloved may guide and sustain you always, and enable
you to win great and memorable victories for His Faith and its infant

you had gathered together and united in sending your love to
him, with the first believer to come from England since the door 
of pilgrimage has been open.  
     He will remember you all in his loving prayers in the Shrines, 
and urges you to devote as much of your time individually as 
possible to the promotion of the goals of your present Plan.  
                                    With warmest &Baha'i greetings,

My Dear Friend, 
     I am directed by our Guardian to thank you for your welcome 
letter of January 11th.  
     He has been very pleased to learn of the more rapid progress 
of the Cause in Manchester and of a greater measure of unity 
among the friends.  He is glad that Mr. Hall is taking this 
initiative and he sincerely trusts that you will all persevere in 
your endeavours, will keep dear the necessity for harmony and 
unity and thus make your group a progressive, enthusiastic and 
worthy &Baha'i centre in England.  He appreciated your efforts 
and that of all friends in Manchester.  He wishes you please to 
convey to them an expression of his heartfelt love and good 
wishes.  
     With best regards, 
                                    Sincerely in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
My Dear co-worker, 
     I am delighted with the news you give me.  The friends in 
Manchester occupy a warm and abiding place in my heart.  The 
fragrant memory of my visit to them is still fresh and vivid in my 
mind.  I will continue to supplicate at the Beloved's Shrine for each one 
of them the Almighty's richest blessings, that they may be guided and 
strengthened to render in the days to come inestimable services to the 
sacred Threshold.  
     With my best wishes to your dear relatives,

Dear &Baha'i Sister, 
     Shoghi Effendi was greatly pleased to receive your kind letter 
of June 24th, 1932, and he has requested me to address you these 
 
+P405 
few lines expressing his heartfelt appreciation of the precious and 
most valuable steps taken by our Manchester friends towards a 
greater extension and consolidation of the Cause.  
     The Guardian was specially glad to hear that you have 
established a new &Baha'i Centre and he fervently hopes that as a 
result of this new move the interests of the Faith will be 
promoted and its teachings will succeed in confirming some 
new souls.  
     The precious efforts so continuously exerted by our 
Manchester &Baha'is and particularly by our beloved Mr. Hall 
and Mr. Sugar will undoubtedly yield their fruits in a not very 
distant future.  But the friends should persevere in their task and 
not let any obstacle, however great, hinder their onward march.  
In these days of sufferings and hardships, patience and hope are 
indispensable for the success of any idea or plan.  
     In closing may I assure you of our Guardian's best wishes and 
ask you to extend to all our Manchester &Baha'is the expression of 
his heartfelt thanks and appreciation.  
                                    Yours in His Service, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your high and unsparing efforts, enable you 
to extend the scope of your activities, and consolidate the foundations 
of the Faith in that great city.

28 July 1950 
 
The Manchester Spiritual Assembly 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter has been received, dated June 6th, and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He feels that the questions of ... could be answered by a better 
understanding of the teachings--however, for the sake of his 
sincere services to the Faith, he will answer them here:  
 
     (1) Christ received the kiss of Judas, in fact He said one of His 
disciples would betray Him.  It is not a question of these Holy 
 
+P406 
Souls seeing the future, but of what, in Their wisdom, They 
deem it necessary to accept in the Path of sacrifice.  If we are 
going to question the wisdom of the Prophets we can question 
God's Wisdom too, and the advisability of the whole system we 
live in.  
     (2) Nabil's suicide was not insanity but love.  He loved 
&Baha'u'llah too much to go on in a world that no longer held 
Him.  
     (3) The "sacrifice" of goats has nothing to do with the Faith.  
&Baha'u'llah was surrounded by Muslim admirers and friends, 
and they merely followed the custom of their people on such an 
occasion, when many hundreds gathered to console His bereaved 
family.  
     (4) We cannot, not knowing the factors &Baha'u'llah weighed 
in His own mind, judge of the wisdom of His withdrawal to 
Kurdistan.  But, studying His life and teachings, we should see in 
it an act of wisdom, and not superficially measure Him by our 
standards.  
     (5) Love is certainly the attribute we associate par excellence 
with our Maker.  But has He no justice and does not justice fall 
on the back of the evil doer as a scourge?  
     (6) This question seems to imply a lack of understanding of 
love.  There is very little Divine love in the world to-day, but a 
great deal of intellectual reasoning, which is an entirely different 
thing, and springs from the mind and not the heart.  The 
Martyrs--most of them died because of their love for the &Bab, 
for &Baha'u'llah, and through Them for God.  The veil between 
the inner and outer world was very thin, and to tear it, and be 
free to be near the Beloved, was very sweet.  But it takes love, not 
reason to understand these things.  We must also remember the 
Martyrs were called upon to deny their faith or die, as men of 
principle they preferred to die.  
     (7) &Baha'u'llah's claims are much greater because humanity is 
more mature and can afford to hear them.  But He draws on the 
same Source that was accessible to all the Prophets, it is we who 
can now receive more.  
     (8) The Guardian feels ... should study more deeply the 
teachings, and meditate on what he studies.  We liken God to the 
Sun, which gives us all our life.  So the Spirit of God reaches us 
through the Souls of the Manifestations.  We must learn to 
 
+P407 
commune with Their Souls, and this is what the Martyrs seemed 
to have done, and what brought them such ecstacy of joy that life 
became nothing.  This is the true mysticism, and the secret, inner 
meaning of life which humanity has at present, drifted so far 
from.  
 
     The Guardian will pray that this dear friend may deepen his 
understanding and arise and become a wonderful teacher of the 
Faith.  
     He will also pray for the progress of the work in Manchester 
and the success of your devoted labours.  
                                    With &Baha'i love, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your efforts, guide and sustain you in your 
activities, and enable you to promote effectively the best interests of

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Our beloved Guardian thanks you not only for the good news 
you conveyed to him in your letter of January 6th, but for the 
spirit which prompted you to share it with him.  
     He admires greatly the services of your community and the 
unity amongst you, which no doubt is largely responsible for 
your success.  
     He will join his prayers to yours for the success of the labours 
of your two latest pioneering members.  
                                    With &Baha'i love, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers, 
     I feel truly proud of your notable services, and I wish to assure you 
of my profound appreciation of your labours, of my loving prayers for 
the progress of your meritorious activities, and the realisation of every 
 
+P408 
hope you cherish in the service of our beloved Faith and of its nascent 
institutions.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

The &Baha'is of Norwich 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of August 2nd has been received and our beloved 
Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was very pleased to see that you are girding up your loins 
to do your utmost for the Plan in the critical months that lie 
ahead.  
     Nothing will further your ends more quickly than the greatest 
love, unity and co-operation amongst yourselves.  These are the 
very soul of the order &Baha'u'llah has come to establish in the 
world and when the people see these qualities and characteristics 
actively demonstrated in our midst, those who are receptive will 
hasten to join our ranks.  Likewise when they see the lack of these 
virtues they will hesitate to embrace the Faith however much 
they may admire its teachings.  
     He will certainly pray that your Assembly may be maintained, 
your numbers increase, and your devotion be rewarded.  
                                    With &Baha'i love, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers, 
     I was pleased to hear from you and receive the assurance of your 
love, your devotion to the interests of our beloved Faith and your 
determination to serve its best interests.  
     I will pray from the depths of my heart on your behalf, that the 
Almighty may bless and sustain you and enable you to win memorable 
victories for His Faith.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letter of July 29th with enclosures has been received, 
and the beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on 
his behalf.  
     He was most happy to receive the July Jarrold Magazine and 
to see the article on the Faith; and also to learn from the copy of 
your News Letter of the activities of the believers in that locality.  
     The Guardian greatly appreciates the spirit animating the 
friends there in the service of the Cause.  He sends you all his 
loving greetings, and assures you of his prayers for the success of 
your devoted labours.  
                                    With warm &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Assuring you of my abiding admiration of your devoted and 
constant endeavours for the promotion of our beloved Faith, and of my 
fervent prayers for the realisation of every hope you cherish for its 
promotion, 
                                    Your true brother,

The &Baha'is of Nottingham 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter, dated February 16th, was received and read by 
our beloved Guardian with great joy, and he has instructed me 
to answer it on his behalf.  
     The news of your group having reached Assembly status was 
a source of deep satisfaction to him, and demonstrates what the 
friends can do, once they put their shoulder to the wheel!  
     You have every reason to feel proud of your achievement, and 
he hopes you will, through your correspondence and contacts 
with your fellow believers, encourage them to follow your 
example and forge ahead, in spite of every obstacle, with 
determination, confident that once we do our part, God is never 
failing in His.  
 
+P410 
     He hopes your numbers will steadily increase and that many 
young people will be attracted to the Faith, as the part they have 
to play is very great and, also, their need of the Faith very great.  
     You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for you, 
and for the success of your labours, in the Holy Shrines.  
                                    With &Baha'i love, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your efforts in the service of our beloved 
Faith, and you to deepen your knowledge of the essentials of His 
World Order, to increase your numbers, to extend the scope of your 
activities, and to fulfil every desire you cherish for its promotion and 
consolidation.  
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

The &Baha'is of Nottingham 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated May 4, has been 
received, and he deeply appreciates your message of devotion 
and affection.  
     His burden is indeed a heavy one, and after so many years of 
continuous responsibility he often feels very tired.  But when he 
sees the loyalty of the friends and their steadfast perseverance in 
their tasks his heart is lightened and he feels greatly encouraged.  
     It is much easier to work when you see results being obtained 
under your very eyes, and, although in many ways his service to 
the Faith has been lonelier and more complicated than that of the 
beloved Master, yet he has had the great blessing of seeing the 
Cause spread out all over the world and greatly expand in many 
countries--such as England, India, the United State, etc.--as it 
never did in the days of &Abdu'l-Baha, Who worked so 
unremittingly towards this end, and Who planted what we now 
reap.  
     He feels the British believers can and will--indeed must--
succeed in their Plan, and his thoughts and prayers are with them 
very often.  
                                    With &Baha'i love, 
 
+P411 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     Your message cheered my heart, and I wish to assure you that I 
greatly value your noble sentiments, and will supplicate the Beloved 
to bless your efforts, guide every step you take in the path of service, 
enable you to extend continually the range of your activities, and 
consolidate the work you have so splendidly inaugurated, and are so 
devotedly prosecuting in the service of this glorious Faith, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of September 14 with enclosure was received, and 
the beloved Guardian thanks you for it.  
     He was pleased to see the enterprising spirit shown by Mr. 
Semple+, and hopes his classes will produce many new contacts.  
     The progress made in Oxford is heartening, and he trusts still 
greater progress lies ahead.  
                                    With loving &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty abundantly reward you for your patient and 
splendid labours, sustain and guide you at all times and under all 
circumstances, enable you to extend the range of your meritorious

Dear Friends:  
     Your letter of December 14th has been received; and the 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
 
+P412 
     He was very pleased to hear of the progress being made; and 
that it has been possible to give the Message to some of the 
"undergrads".  It is most important that the Faith should be 
conveyed with a sense of dignity at so important a university as 
Oxford; and better that the work should go forward slowly 
than that any mistakes should be made.  
     He assures you all that he deeply appreciates your devoted 
labours; and he hopes that you will fulfill your objective of 
increasing the number of believers there.  
                                    With warm &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved, whose Cause you are serving with such fidelity, 
ability and devotion, reward you abundantly for your meritorious 
labours, guide every step you take, and enable you to lay a firm and 
unassailable foundation for the future institutions of His Faith in that 
historic and promising City.

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of December 10th has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He was very happy to see that you have held another meeting 
in Manchester College, and hopes that the attracted ones who 
attended may become real students of the Faith, and eventually 
join its ranks.  
     The poem by Miss Masefield was much appreciated by the 
Guardian.  Please assure Miss Masefield that he liked it very 
much, and will consider using it for a future volume of "&Baha'i 
World".  The only thing that he saw that seemed to need 
correction was that the word "&Abha", was spelled "Abba" instead 
of "&Abha".  
     He hopes that Miss Masefield, through the friendship and 
 
+P413 
wise association of the members of your Group with her, will 
feel moved to declare herself an active member of the Faith.  He 
will pray that this may come about.  
     The Guardian will also pray for the success of the devoted 
labours of the believers in Oxford.  
                                    With warm &Baha'i love, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty guide and sustain you always, remove all 
obstacles from your path, and enable you to win great and memorable 
victories in the service of His Faith,

by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     He thanks you very much for the expression of your 
sympathy, and for the newspaper clipping you enclosed.  
     It has indeed been a great loss to the work of the Faith, to lose 
such a valiant, constant and distinguished Hand as dear Dorothy 
Baker.  It will leave a gap in the pioneer field, as well.  No doubt 
her noble spirit will be able to assist and inspire from on high, 
and this must be the consolation of all her friends and admirers.  
     He trusts the work in Oxford is progressing steadily; and he 
assures you all of his loving prayers in your behalf.

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of April 9th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     Mrs. Winsten invited the Guardian if possible to view in 
person her portrait of &Abdu'l-Baha.  Needless to say, he thanked 
her for her kind invitation, but informed her this would be quite 
out of the question.  
     He is very pleased to hear that she has consented to forwarding 
a photograph through acquaintances of hers, and he will be very 
interested to see it.  He will let you know if he considers the 
likeness sufficiently good to warrant any of the &Baha'is purchasing 
it.  It is a pity to own portraits of &Abdu'l-Baha which do not in 
any way resemble Him.  
     Some time ago you asked him to send you a copy of the 
description which Miss Campbell+ brought to Haifa of how the 
artist made this drawing of &Abdu'l-Baha.  Unfortunately this has 
been mislaid, and it is not possible for the Guardian to send you 
a copy.  However, the original you may be sure is safe in his 
papers.  
     He is very happy to hear of the progress of the Cause in 
Oxford, such a very important centre from every standpoint.  He 
assures you all of his loving prayers for the progress of your 
activities, and for each and all of you.  
                                    With warmest &Baha'i greetings, 

          [From the Guardian:] 
     Assuring you of my loving prayers for you all, and for the success 
of your efforts for the promotion of our beloved Faith, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letter of November 30th with enclosure has been 
 
+P415 
received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     The news of the opening of the Oxford &Baha'is' first Centre 
rejoiced his heart.  He was particularly happy to know that this 
project was consummated and the Centre furnished and made 
ready for use almost entirely through the united efforts and 
devotion of the believers themselves.  
     As you know, the Guardian attaches great importance to 
Oxford.  Now that the friends have a Centre, which in itself will 
be a means of attracting seeking souls to them to learn of the 
Faith; and also the &Baha'is have made for themselves a teaching 
plan, he feels confident that the work will go forward there with 
great strides, and that your community will grow in numbers 
and in strength.  
     He will remember you all in his loving prayers in the Holy 
Shrines.  
                                    With loving &Baha'i greetings,

     He is hoping that the fact that the believers now have their 
own Centre in Oxford will greatly stimulate the work there, 
and cause the more rapid expansion of the Faith in this difficult 
town.  
     The work done among the University students should be 
steadily pursued.  Perhaps before long some among their number 
may determine to accept the Faith and arise whole-heartedly to 
serve it.

of Mrs. Langdon-Davies.  A short biographical account of her life

to questions asked in personal letters to him.  It is possible 
therefore to catch a glimpse of the changing problems facing the 
&Baha'i community and these frequently reflected conditions in 
the country as a whole.  This is particularly significant in the 
years immediately following the Second World War for as the 
Guardian, in a letter written on his behalf by his secretary, wrote 
of the British believers, 
     "... he feels the greatest sympathy for them, and considers 
     that when their present achievements are assessed in the future, 
     people will give them a double measure of praise for having 
     done so much when they were least fit to do it."

          [From the Guardian] 
     ...I wish you, my dearest friend, to make once again a supreme 
effort to come to a full understanding with the friends outside....  
Extend to them your generous and helping hand, approach them with 
a spirit of selflessness and cordiality and the result, I am confident will 
be indeed marvellous.  My heart rejoices at the news of the growth of 
harmony among the friends and I feel paralysed in my work when I 
hear to the contrary.  I am impressing on the friends in ... the absolute 
necessity of cultivating understanding and friendliness and consolidating 
the foundation of the National Assembly.  For upon these National 
Assemblies will the Edifice of the Universal House of Justice be raised.  
 
 
28 October 1925 
 
     Shoghi Effendi is much interested to hear of your literary 
work.  He fully agrees with you that different people must be 
approached in different ways and that valuable work for the 
&Baha'i Cause can be done within the Christian Churches by 
promoting the "Christianity of Christ".  &Abdu'l-Baha said that 
when people become true Christians, they will find themselves 
&Baha'is.  One or two of the best &Baha'is I know were very earnest, 
sincere, devoted Christians and accepted the &Baha'i teachings 
with very little difficulty and without any intervening period of 
religious scepticism, as an amplification and fulfilment of the 
teachings and prophesyings of Christ and the prophets.  
 
 
28 December 1925 
 
     He is very sorry that such undesirable things are every now 
and then cropping up in ... and discouraging you in your work, 
keeping you from devoting all your spare time in teaching the 
Cause and spreading its principles.  He does not wish you, 
however, to lose heart from such things.  As the Cause grows its 
difficulties will increase and its problems will become more 
numerous.  The friends, especially the older ones, should therefore 
try and stand unmoved by them.  In fact the more their difficulties 
 
+P422 
will increase the more they have to take courage and try to solve 
them.  The Master has often said that sorrows are like furrows, 
the deeper they go the more productive the land becomes.  If this 
problem of ... should be settled other problems will arise.  Are 
the friends to become discouraged or are they to follow the 
footsteps of the Master and consider them more as chances to 
show their tenacity of belief and spirit of sacrifice?  In short, 
Shoghi Effendi wishes you to keep on teaching the principles of 
the Cause no matter what problems may arise.  

          [From the Guardian:] 
     ...Let not anxieties and disappointments overwhelm you or 
oppress your generous and sensitive heart.  Turn to Him in prayer and 
remember that I am joining you in your supplications for guidance 
and strength.  Be patient in tribulation and never relax in your efforts 
to promote the Divine Teachings.  
 
 
28 March 1926 
 
     It must have been very distasteful to you to read some of the 
off-hand and ungrammatical translations that more out of 
necessity than choice won circulation and were even published.  
Furthermore, it was always the expressed wish and desire of 
&Abdu'l-Baha to have proper and adequate translations that 
would not only convey the true spirit of the original but also 
possess some literary merit.  And for this he emphasised the 
necessity of a board of translators.  Such a board it has 
unfortunately been impossible to form as yet.  
     Meanwhile Shoghi Effendi, realising the urgent necessity of 
the translation of some of the important writings, has translated 
some of the passages.  
 
 
16 October 1926 
 
     We should, however, be careful, as you mention in your 
letter, not to make this system develop into a hard and fast creed 
or form.  The Cause is pure and free from such things and it 
ought to be the task of the friends to keep it broad and 
progressive.  Man is always apt to fall into the habit of doing a 
 
+P423 
thing in a certain way, and thereby become captive to prescribed 
forms.  It should therefore be the duty of the assemblies 
everywhere to see that, though certain temporary measures are 
taken to further the Cause, they do not crystallise into hard and 
fast creeds.  
 
 
6 April 1928 
 
          [From the Guardian] 
     I feel that regarding such interpretations (of verses from the 
Scriptures) no one has the right to impose his view or opinion and 
require his listeners to believe in his particular interpretation of the 
sacred and prophetic writings.  I have no objection to your 
interpretations and inferences so long as they are represented as your 
own personal observations and reflections.  It would be unnecessary 
and confusing to state authoritatively and officially a dogmatic &Baha'i 
interpretation to be universally accepted and taught by believers.  Such 
matters I feel should be left to the personal judgement and insight of 
individual teachers....  
 
 
12 December 1929 
 
     Ever since its inception (the "&Baha'i World") Shoghi Effendi 
has cherished the hope of making it a work that would prove 
interesting and illuminating to the reader.  Destined mainly for 
the &non-Baha'is, he has tried to attract through its pages the 
attention of educated and enlightened people and especially 
leaders in every country, with a view to acquaint them with the 
broad and fundamental principles of the Faith and to win their 
consideration of the Movement as a growing force for good and 
for peace throughout the entire world.  It is therefore with lively 
satisfaction that he has seen the publication grow yearly in 
importance and this feeling has been lately enhanced very much 
by the words of interest or appreciation which he has received 
from many quarters and leading men, among which was a 
remarkably encouraging letter from Sir Herbert Samuel.  Indeed 
Shoghi Effendi has made it a point to send copies to as many 
leading men as possible and copies of last year's issue were 
presented to the Emperor of Japan, the &Shah of Persia and Queen 
Marie of Rumania.  
 
 
+P424 
9 February 1930 
 
     The subject you had raised with regard to the date of the 
publication of the writings of &Baha'u'llah is interesting as it is 
important.  If I remember correctly the same issue was raised as 
an open challenge in India by some spokesman of the Ahmadiyya 
sect.  The earliest published writings of &Baha'u'llah date from the 
nineties of the last century.  Over forty years ago the Aqdas, a 
volume of general Tablets including &Tarazat, &Ishraqat, and others 
were published in &Ishqabad (Russia) and Bombay respectively 
and copies of these though rare are still procurable.  Simultaneously 
with these, if not earlier, some of the writings of 
&Baha'u'llah were published by the Oriental Department of the 
Imperial Russian University at St. Petersburgh under the 
supervision of its director Baron Rosen (and more particulars 
about these could be found in the books of E. G. Browne) and 
these of course are not undated like some of those published in 
Bombay.  
     The main bulk of the writings of &Baha'u'llah however are to 
be found in manuscript form written by noted scribes after the 
fashion of orientals.  These scribes did not leave all their 
manuscripts undated and &Jinabi Zain, a very noted &Baha'i scribe, 
always dated his copies of the writings of &Baha'u'llah at the end 
of the volume in what E. G. Browne calls `colophenes' and the 
description of some of these colophenes could be found in the 
works of the Cambridge Professor.  
     The son of the above-mentioned scribe is still living in Haifa 
and does very much the same work as his father.  He claims that 
as early as 1868 his father used to write copies of the &Iqan for the 
&Baha'is in Persia as a source of livelihood, and that after 1885 
when he went to &Akka to join &Baha'u'llah's party his entire work 
and time was devoted to copying the sacred writings for sale 
among &Baha'is.  These copies are to be found all throughout the 
East and are almost invariably dated.  
 
 
9 June 1930 
 
     Concerning the accounts of visits to Haifa, published by the 
friends during the Master's life-time, Shoghi Effendi is very 
 
+P425 
reluctant to attribute to them much authority.  Most of these are 
personal impressions and are to be valued only as such.  &Baha'u'llah 
definitely states that only His actual writings are to be relied 
upon.  Such reports may be interesting but not authoritative, no 
matter who the reporter may be...  
 
 
22 October 1930 
 
     ...If those heroic deeds have made such an impression upon 
you, would not the reading of the narrative arouse the friends to 
greater sacrifices and stimulate them to more intensive service?  
It was not mere physical torture that the friends in Persia had to 
endure but also moral persecution for they were cursed and 
vilified by all the people, especially when they ceased to defend 
themselves ... the Master used to say sometimes that the western 
friends will be severely persecuted but theirs will be primarily 
moral....  
 
 
30 November 1930 
 
     He (the Guardian) is enclosing extracts from Lord Curzon's 
"Persia and the Persian Question" giving a detailed and faithful 
description of the state of Persia in the middle of the 19th 
century.  He thinks that references to the extracts ... will be of 
great value in showing to the reader the contrast between the 
decadent state of the government and the people at that time and 
the heroism and nobility of character displayed by the early 
disciples of the &Bab...  Shoghi Effendi is also sending you ... the 
Master's words concerning the situation which led to the 
defensive action which the early disciples of the &Bab were 
compelled to take in &Mazindaran, &Nayriz and &Zanjan.  From 
these words it is evident that a systematic campaign of plunder 
and massacre had been initiated by the central government.  
&Baha'u'llah, Who Himself was an active figure in those days and 
was regarded one of the leading exponents of the Faith of the 
&Bab, states clearly His views in the &Iqan that His conception of 
the sovereignty of the Promised &Qa'im was purely a spiritual 
 
+P426 
one, and not a material or political one...  His view of the 
sovereignty of the &Qa'im confirms the various evidences given 
in the text of the narrative itself of the views held by those who 
actually participated in these events such as &Hujjat, &Quddus, 
&Mulla &Husayn.  The very fact that these disciples were ready and 
willing to emerge from the fort and return to their homes after 
receiving the assurance that they would be no more molested is 
itself an evidence that they were not contemplating any action 
against the authorities.  
     Shoghi Effendi is also sending you an account of the doctrines 
of &Shi'ah &Islam from which the Movement originally sprang.  It 
will help you to connect the origin of the Movement with the 
tenets and beliefs held by the &Shi'ahs of Persia.  The &Bab declared 
Himself at the beginning of His mission to be the "&Bab" by 
which He meant to be the gate or forerunner of "Him Whom 
God will make manifest", that is to say &Baha'u'llah, Whose advent 
the &Shi'ahs also expected in the person of "the return of &Imam 
&Husayn".  The Sunnis also believe in a similar twofold 
manifestation, the first they call "the &Mihdi", the second "the 
Return of Christ".  By the term &Bab, the &Bab meant to be the 
forerunner of the second manifestation rather than, as some have 
maintained, the gate of the &Qa'im.  When He declared Himself to 
be the &Bab, the people understood by the term that He was an 
intermediary between the absent &Qa'im and His followers, 
though He Himself never meant to be such a person.  All He 
claimed to be was that He was the &Qa'im Himself and in addition 
to this station, that of the &Bab, namely the gate or forerunner of 
"Him Whom God will make manifest".  
     There are many authorised traditions from &Muhammad 
stating clearly (as explained in the &Iqan) that the promised &Qa'im 
would bring a new Book and new Laws.  In other words 
abrogating the law of &Islam.  
     Shoghi Effendi feels that the Unity of the &Baha'i revelation as 
one complete whole embracing the Faith of the &Bab should be 
emphasised...  The Faith of the &Bab should not be divorced 
from that of &Baha'u'llah.  Though the teachings of the &Bayan 
have been abrogated and superseded by the laws of Aqdas, yet 
due to the fact that the &Bab considered Himself as the forerunner 
of &Baha'u'llah we should regard His dispensation together with 
that of &Baha'u'llah as forming one entity, the former being an 
 
+P427 
introductory to the advent of the latter.  Just as the advent of John 
the Baptist--who according to various authorities was Himself 
the originator of laws which abrogated the teachings current 
among the Jews--forms part of the Christian revelation, the 
advent of the &Bab likewise forms an integral part of the &Baha'i 
Faith.  That is why Shoghi Effendi feels justified to call &Nabil's 
narrative a narrative of the early days of the &Baha'i revelation.  
     Shoghi Effendi feels that it should be explained that forbidding 
self defence by &Baha'u'llah should not be taken too literally.  To 
put it as bluntly as this, he fears that the question might be 
misunderstood.  &Baha'u'llah could surely have not meant that a 
&Baha'i should not attempt to defend his life against any 
irresponsible assailant who might attack him for any purpose 
whatever, whether religious or not.  Every reasonable person 
would feel under such circumstances justified in protecting his 
life....  
     Regarding &Nabil:  He was born on the 18th day of the month 
of &Safar of the year 1247 A. H. in the village of Zarand in Persia.  
He was thirteen years old when the &Bab declared Himself.  
Though still young he himself was preparing to leave for &Shaykh 
&Tabarsi and join the companions of &Mulla &Husayn when the 
news of the treachery and massacre of the besieged companions 
reached him.  He met &Baha'u'llah in &Kirmanshah and &Tihran 
before the latter's banishment to &Iraq.  He was a close companion 
of the &Bab's amanuensis &Mirza &Ahmad.  He subsequently met 
&Baha'u'llah in &Baghdad, Adrianople and &Akka and was 
commissioned by &Baha'u'llah to journey several times to Persia 
in order to promote the Cause and encourage the scattered and 
persecuted believers.  He was present in &Akka when &Baha'u'llah 
passed away in 1892 and soon after was so overcome with grief 
that he drowned himself in the sea.  His body was found along 
the shore and was buried in the cemetery of &Akka.  &Abdu'l-Baha 
is reported to have been struck with deep sorrow at the manner 
of his death.  He states in his narration that he met the maternal 
uncle of the &Bab, &Haji &Mirza Siyyid &Ali who had visited his 
nephew in the Castle of &Chihriq and had recently returned to 
&Tihran.  He started writing his narrative in 1305 A.H. four years 
before the passing of &Baha'u'llah.  It took him about a year and 
half to write it.  His chief informants were &Mirza &Ahmad the 
amanuensis of the &Bab and &Mirza &Musa the brother of &Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P428 
Parts of his narrative were read in the presence of &Baha'u'llah and 
approved by Him.  &Abdu'l-Baha also went over sections of his 
narrative....  
     Shoghi Effendi has found in the papers of &Abdu'l-Baha a 
complete set of the &Bab's Tablets to the 18 Letters of the Living, 
all written in His own hand-writing and bearing His seal.  In 
addition to these there are two other Tablets both written by 
Himself in exquisite hand-writing, the one addressed to the 19th 
Letter who was Himself and the other to "Him whom God will 
make manifest", i.e. &Baha'u'llah.  This last one has three seals and 
is written on blue paper....  
     Regarding the question raised in your letter....  The &Baha'is 
in Persia avoid political posts and positions, abstain from any 
interference in matters pertaining to the policy of the state, but 
fill the more important administrative posts that have no political 
character.  They feel that in this manner they can best serve the 
interest of their country and prove by their action their integrity 
and attachment to Persia....  
     Shoghi Effendi is enclosing an extremely interesting account 
given by a certain Dr. Cormick, an English physician long 
resident in &Tabriz of his meeting with the &Bab.  He is apparently 
the only Westerner who has met the &Bab and recorded his 
impressions...  Shoghi Effendi thinks of adding it to his notes.  
 
 
30 April 1931 
 
     ...You could also in a quiet way speak to persons whom you 
think are ready for such a message and would appreciate the 
light when they see it.  Try to form around you a group of 
&Baha'is who are well versed in the teachings and who are ready 
to assist you in serving the Cause.  In short try to form an 
assembly of pure and competent souls.  Meanwhile you could 
write, for the Cause is in great need of first class literature and 
you are gifted along that line.  
     The Cause surely needs sacrifices, in fact it is only through 
sacrifice that it can progress, but such determined activity should 
be coupled with wisdom and caution if it is not going to be a 
temporary flare.  Intimate talk and personal contact has proven 
the surest and quietest way for establishing a group....  
 
 
+P429 
7 November 1931 
 
     The present social and economic problems that are facing the 
British people are surely occupying their whole attention, but 
they should also operate as a reminder and draw them closer to 
spiritual matters.  The people have to be made conscious of the 
fact that without a complete change in our outlook and a total 
reform of the guiding principles of our life, such as the Cause 
advocates, our social and economic problems cannot be solved 
nor our conditions ameliorated.  Nothing short of the full 
message of &Baha'u'llah can end the sufferings that are befalling 
humanity.  
 
 
2 January 1932 
 
     It is strange how much suffering man has to put up with while 
on this earth.  Our consolation should be however that it is part 
of a divine plan whose worth we cannot yet fathom....  
     ...Shoghi Effendi wishes ... to encourage those who are 
talented to give expression to the wonderful spirit that animates 
them.  We need poets and writers for the Cause....  Some of the 
poems are written by very youthful persons yet they ring so true 
and give expression to such thoughts that one should halt and 
admire.  In Persia the Cause has given birth to poets that even 
&non-Baha'is consider them as great.  We hope before long we 
will have similar persons arise in the West.  
 
 
10 January 1932 
 
     In Persia the Cause gave birth to many poets of national 
standing.  Let us hope that the west will follow suit and produce 
similar talents.  
 
 
23 February 1932 
 
     The exact date in which the Hidden Words was written you 
can find on the opening page of Mrs. J. E. Stannard's translation 
published in Cairo.  She gives a line in the Master's own 
handwriting giving the date as 1274 A.H. (1857-8 A.D.).  It is 
 
+P430 
generally believed that the Hidden Words was dictated by 
&Baha'u'llah to His secretary as He strolled on the banks of the 
river in &Baghdad--in sections rather than all at one time.  
     As to the date of the &Iqan, I think it can be calculated from the 
actual text and I have it in my papers as 1278 A.H., i.e. 1861 A.D.  
You will find that in the text itself.  It was written in answer to 
questions put by a distinguished &Babi.  
 
 
16 May 1932 
 
     Even though outwardly the number of the friends has not 
been increasing so rapidly, yet the spirit has not remained idle.  
The leaven of spirituality has been working, and when the time 
will come it will manifest itself in a sudden awakening.  All that 
we need is a little more courage, perseverance and patience.  
There are many important men that are attentively watching 
the progress of the Faith but are reluctant to come forward and 
extend a helping hand.  In time they will, and then we shall see 
the Cause of God spread by leaps and bounds....  
 
 
10 August 1932 
 
     Your touching words of condolence and sympathy in 
connection with the sudden removal of the Greatest Holy Leaf 
from our midst have greatly comforted (the Guardian's) aching 
heart and relieved the burden of sorrow that lies so heavily upon 
him.  
     In this great calamity which has seized the entire body of the 
followers of the Faith in both East and West our Guardian's loss 
is the greatest and the most cruel.  His sole comfort, at this 
terrible hour, is to see the friends united and working together 
for the realisation of our departed &Khanum's dearest wishes.  
 
 
15 March 1933 
 
     He deeply appreciates your sincere, well-expressed reference 
to the Tribute he has written to the dearly beloved Greatest 
Holy Leaf.  
 
+P431 
     You cannot imagine to what an extent our dear Guardian has, 
in this loss, been deprived for ever of the sustaining influence and 
kindness that this Most Exalted Leaf used to shower daily upon 
him.  In this beautiful Tribute we can trace the life of this 
beautiful soul, witness with anguish all the sufferings and 
deprivations that she has endured.  Now we should, all of us, try 
in turn to follow her saintly path and direct all our energy to 
serve the Cause which has been so dear to her.  
 
 
6 May 1933 
 
     What the Faith needs, even more than teachers, is books that 
expound the true significance of its principles in the light of 
modern thought and social problems.  
 
 
29 May 1933 
 
     He was deeply touched by the strong attachment of the friends 
to one who, besides being the beloved daughter of &Baha'u'llah, 
exemplified perhaps more than any one the true spirit that 
animates His Teachings.  His (the Guardian's) sincere hope is that 
your love for our departed Greatest Holy Leaf will attain such 
depth and intensity as to enable you to follow in her footsteps 
and to carry out with increasing devotion and vigour all that she 
cherished so much during the entire course of her earthly life.  
The memory of her saintly life will undoubtedly sustain and 
feed your energies and will provide you with that spiritual 
potency of which we are all in such a great need.  
 
 
17 October 1933 
 
     How much the Faith is in need of able and devoted souls like 
you who are ready to suffer every possible deprivation for its 
sake.  If every believer was ready to contribute his share, however 
humble and small, and through any means, whether intellectual 
 
+P432 
or material, the Faith would have undoubtedly made a 
tremendous progress in the world....  
 
 
12 November 1933 
 
     You use the expression "till time ends".  This is misleading, for 
there is no end to time.  The Guardian suggests that you should 
either use the term used in the &Iqan "till the end that has no end", 
or express it in such a manner that would give the idea that time 
has no end....  
     Jehovah is a title of God, whereas &Baha'u'llah is the title of the 
Manifestation of God.  
     ... you count the period of the Christian Dispensation as 
having lasted for 1844 years.  As in the &Baha'i teachings 
&Muhammad is considered as an independent prophet of God, 
you have to consider His Dispensation as having begun in 622 
A.D.  The Christian Dispensation must, therefore, end in 622 
A.D. and from that date till 1844 is the era of &Muhammad.  1260 
is the calculation based on the lunar system.  In other words, it is 
the Hegira year or A.H.  You should either specify this fact, or 
base your calculation on the solar year, in which case it will be 
less than 1260, as there is a difference of one year in every 33 
years.  
     ... you should point out that, only so far as it is recorded in the 
Gospel, Jesus gave two material ordinances only.  Our knowledge 
of Jesus' life and teachings is rather fragmentary and so it would 
be more correct if you specify that these ordinances are only 
those recorded in the Gospel, and they may not be the only ones.  
There may be other teachings and ordinances too, of which no 
record is left.  
     ...Muhammadanism is not only the last of the world 
religions, but a fuller Revelation than any one preceding it.  The 
&Qur'an is not only more authoritative than any previous religious 
gospel, but it contains also much more; ordinances, teachings 
and precepts, which taken together constitute a fuller Revelation 
of God's purpose and law to mankind than Christianity, Judaism 
or any other previous Dispensation.  This view is in complete 
accord with the &Baha'i philosophy of progressive revelation, and 
should be thoroughly accepted and taught by every loyal ... 
&Baha'i.  
 
 
+P433 
1 December 1933 
 
     One more European is reported to have seen &Baha'u'llah from 
a distance, but Professor Browne was the only Westerner who 
actually met Him.  
 
 
4 June 1934 
 
     You should, nevertheless, persevere in your efforts until your 
immediate objective has been fully attained.  God cannot, indeed, 
withdraw from so devoted and so capable a &Baha'i like you all 
the guidance and assistance you need for the effective discharge 
of your responsibilities and obligations to the Cause.  Be, 
therefore, confident in &Baha'u'llah's help.  His Spirit will lead 
you, and will feed your soul with that spiritual sustenance 
whereby you will be able to overcome the obstacles which seem 
to so hopelessly beset your path.  
 
 
10 November 1934 
 
     When you quote the &Bab, or anyone of His disciples you 
should make it clear that the words attributed to them are by no 
means their exact words.  They constitute the substance of their 
message, and thus are not as definite as the quoted words of 
&Baha'u'llah or the Master.  So, the Guardian suggests that you 
should either omit the quotation marks, or to specify that the 
passages quoted are not the exact words used by the &Bab and His 
disciples.  In the future edition of &Nabil's Narrative a similar 
explanation will have to be inserted in the "Dawn Breakers".  
     You state that the Christian Dispensation "was six hundred 
and twenty-two years old at the time of the Hegira".  The 
Guardian suggests that the words "at the time of the Hegira" be 
omitted as they may give the impression that the Revelation of 
Christ extended beyond the date of the Hegira.  
 
 
8 February 1935 
 
     Religious conservatism, particularly in England, constitutes 
indeed a serious obstacle which the friends have to meet when 
 
+P434 
spreading the Message, and not until such an obstacle has been 
completely removed can the Cause effectively spread and 
establish itself in the West.  This religious conservatism is in 
many respects far more dangerous and more difficult to wipe out 
than the religious apathy which is so rapidly invading all classes 
of society.  
     In view of that, it is, at least for the present, more advantageous 
to teach the Message in an indirect way, so as to gradually attract 
and confirm those who have the spiritual capacity of appreciating 
the Cause in its fullness.  
 
 
29 May 1935 
 
     As to your question concerning the meaning of physical 
suffering and its relation to mental and spiritual healing.  Physical 
pain is a necessary accompaniment of all human existence, and as 
such is unavoidable.  As long as there will be life on earth, there 
will be also suffering, in various forms and degrees.  But suffering, 
although an inescapable reality, can nevertheless be utilised as a 
means for the attainment of happiness.  This is the interpretation 
given to it by all the prophets and saints who, in the midst of 
severe tests and trials, felt happy and joyous and experienced 
what is best and holiest in life.  Suffering is both a reminder and 
a guide.  It stimulates us better to adapt ourselves to our 
environmental conditions, and thus leads the way to self 
improvement.  In every suffering one can find a meaning and a 
wisdom.  But it is not always easy to find the secret of that 
wisdom.  It is sometimes only when all our suffering has passed 
that we become aware of its usefulness.  What man considers to 
be evil turns often to be a cause of infinite blessings.  And this is 
due to his desire to know more than he can.  God's wisdom is, 
indeed, inscrutable to us all, and it is no use pushing too far 
trying to discover that which shall always remain a mystery to 
our mind.  
     In connection with your question relative to the &Baha'i 
solution of sex problems.  On the question of sex the &Baha'is are, 
in most of their fundamental views, in full agreement with the 
upholders of traditional morality.  &Baha'u'llah, like all the other 
Prophets and Messengers of God, preaches abstinence, and 
 
+P435 
condemns, in vehement language, all forms of sexual laxity, 
unbridled licence and lust.  The &Baha'i standard of sex morality 
is thus very high, but it is by no means unreasonably rigid.  
While free love is condemned, yet marriage is considered as a 
holy act which every human being should be encouraged, 
though not forced, to perform.  Sex instinct, like all other human 
instincts, is not necessarily evil.  It is a power which, if properly 
directed, can bring joy and satisfaction to the individual.  If 
misused or abused it brings, of course, incalculable harm not 
only to the individual but also to the society in which he lives.  
While the &Baha'is condemn asceticism and all extreme forms of 
self-mortification they at the same time view with disfavour the 
current theories of sex ethics which cannot but bring ruin to 
human society.  In the &Baha'i Cause marriage has been encouraged, 
but made somewhat difficult, conditioned as it is upon the 
consent of the four parents.  Divorce, on the other hand, has been 
made relatively easy, and the sociologists are just beginning to 
realise the importance of this law....  
 
 
6 April 1936 
 
     He (the Guardian) is of the opinion, however, that while the 
secondary aspects of &Baha'i Administration should be left out, a 
comprehensive statement as to its origin and significance in the 
&Baha'i Dispensation is of vital importance in any work of the 
Cause, especially if it is written by a believer.  The main thing is 
to properly present the subject so that the reader may be able to 
grasp it.  
 
 
21 November 1936 
 
     With reference to the absolute pacifists, or conscientious 
objectors to war; their attitude, judged from the &Baha'i 
standpoint, is quite anti-social and due to its exaltation of the 
individual conscience leads inevitably to disorder and chaos in 
society.  Extreme pacifists are thus very close to the anarchists, in 
the sense that both these groups lay an undue emphasis on the 
rights and merits of the individual.  The &Baha'i conception of 
 
+P436 
social life is essentially based on the principle of the subordination 
of the individual will to that of society.  It neither suppresses the 
individual nor does it exalt him to the point of making him an 
anti-social creature, a menace to society.  As in everything it 
follows the `golden mean'.  The only way that society can 
function is for the minority to follow the will of the majority.  
     The other main objection to the conscientious objectors is that 
their method of establishing peace is too negative.  Non-co-operation 
is too passive a philosophy to become an effective 
way for social reconstruction.  Their refusal to bear arms can 
never establish peace.  There should be first a spiritual revitalisation 
which nothing, except the Cause of God, can effectively 
bring to every man's heart.  
 
 
3 February 1937 
 
     Do not feel discouraged if your labours do not always yield an 
abundant fruitage.  For a quick and rapidly-won success is not 
always the best and the most lasting.  The harder you strive to 
attain your goal, the greater will be the confirmations of 
&Baha'u'llah, and the more certain you can feel to attain success.  
Be cheerful, therefore, and exert yourself with full faith and 
confidence.  For &Baha'u'llah has promised His Divine assistance to 
every one who arises with a pure and detached heart to spread 
His Holy Word, even though he may be bereft of every human 
knowledge and capacity, and notwithstanding the forces of 
darkness and of opposition which may be arrayed against him.  
The goal is clear, the path safe and certain, and the assurances of 
&Baha'u'llah as to the eventual success of our efforts quite emphatic.  
Let us keep firm, and whole-heartedly carry on the great work 
which He has entrusted into our hands.  
 
 
31 March 1938 
 
     With reference to your question as to whether individuals can 
help each other by accepting to suffer for each other's sake.  
Surely such sacrifice for our fellow humans can have helpful 
 
+P437 
results.  This law of sacrifice operates in our own lives, as well as 
in the lives of the Divine Manifestations.  
 
 
18 April 1940 
 
     In these stormy days his thoughts are often with you and our 
dear English believers, and his prayers continue to be offered on 
your behalf, that you may all be protected and remain safe, so 
that when this great ordeal of war which is threatening to engulf 
the whole world will have passed, you may all be able to 
continue serving our beloved Cause, and this time through more 
effective means and on a larger scale than ever before.  
     The immediate future, as clearly predicted by the Master, 
must necessarily be very dark for the Cause as well as for the 
whole world, but the promises He has repeatedly given us of a 
glorious future for the Faith and for mankind as a whole are of 
such character as should assuredly sustain and strengthen us 
amidst the trials and tribulations of the days ahead.  
 
 
2 June 1941 
 
     There can be no doubt that after the present suffering of 
humanity many souls, who at present show only a mild interest 
in the Faith, will turn to it as the sole road which can lead them 
out of the valley of blindness and misery to the "green pastures" 
promised by their Lord....  
 
 
1 August 1941 
 
     Wherever the Cause is being spread, as it grows in strength, 
people increasingly will take sides both for and against it.  
Therefore he (the Guardian) is not surprised to learn that you are 
finding yourself in the position, sometimes being upheld and 
sometimes being attacked!  It is a great bounty from God that 
you have had a training in this world which so admirably suits 
you for a champion of His Faith and an exponent of His 
doctrines....  
 
 
+P438 
19 October 1941 
 
     The English &Baha'is are being tested in both faith and character 
very severely, and the Guardian is deeply gratified to see the 
manner in which they are responding, a manner that proclaims 
to all who witness it that these souls are true &Baha'is.  
     The Master longed so to see the believers perfect their faith in 
living.  Now is the supreme hour of test applied, not only to the 
whole world, but to the &Baha'is too; how they act, to the degree 
they adhere to the spirit and the letter of their Faith, will point 
the way to watching humanity and demonstrate the worth of 
being a follower of &Baha'u'llah ... the good news you convey of 
the spirit and devotion of the English friends greatly pleases 
Shoghi Effendi.  
     His hope and prayer is that during these times of danger, 
stress, and misery, the &Baha'is will seek out amidst their fellow-countrymen 
those jewel-like souls that belong to &Baha'u'llah and 
bring them the blessing and comfort of His Faith.  
 
  
30 October 1941 
 
     He (the Guardian) feels that the great point is to confirm 
people of true capacity and ability--from whatever social 
stratum they may be, because the Cause needs now, and will ever 
increasingly need, souls of great ability who can bring it before 
the public at large, administer its ever-growing affairs, and 
contribute to its advancement in every field.  
     As the Guardian's thoughts are very often with the English 
friends, and he feels deeply conscious of both their trials and the 
wonderful &Baha'i spirit in which they are meeting them, he feels 
they have almost a special right to call on him, and he welcomes 
their letters and any news of them he receives.  So you must feel 
free to turn to him whenever you feel the necessity of doing 
so....  
 
 
14 March 1942 
 
     He also approves of the idea of advertising the name "&Baha'i" 
as widely as possible, as we can never tell at what future date the 
 
+P439 
remembrance of that word may aid some soul to seek and find 
the Faith.  
     At present people are too engulfed in hopes, events, desires, 
and various partizanships, to realise that there is no way out for 
humanity except to accept the Divine Plan for this Day, and put 
its healing principles and laws into practice.  But gradually their 
eyes will be opened, and it is for this time that the friends must 
labour to bring the knowledge of the Cause before as wide a 
public as possible.  
 
 
September 1942 
 
     He (the Guardian) fully realises how much strain you are 
subjected to, but he also feels that in so far as is compatible with 
your health you should persevere in all your &Baha'i activities, as 
your services could ill be spared in any field at this time.  
 
 
25 September 1942 
 
     There is an answer in the teachings for everything; 
unfortunately the majority of the &Baha'is, however intensely 
devoted and sincere they may be, lack for the most part the 
necessary scholarship and wisdom to reply to and refute the 
claims and attacks of people with some education and 
standing....  
     It is hard to foresee at present the way in which humanity is 
going to become spiritualised.  At present it seems, the increased 
sufferings yet to be borne, combined with a far wider diffusion 
of the Divine Message, will bring about unbelievable changes in 
the days to come....  
 
 
5 May 1943 
 
     Unless and until the believers really come to realise they are 
one spiritual family, knit together by a bond more lasting than 
mere physical ties can ever be, they will not be able to create that 
warm community atmosphere which alone can attract the hearts 
of humanity, frozen for lack of real love and feeling.  
 
 
+P440 
May 1943 
 
     If, however, you find your health affected by keeping the Fast 
the Guardian would advise you to consult a physician, and if he 
tells you you are unable to fast then of course, you should abstain 
from doing so.  
 
 
26 May 1943 
 
     He (the Guardian) feels that &Baha'i children like you have a lot 
of wonderful work to do for others in the future.  But you don't 
even have to wait until you grow up, you can help your dear 
Mother teach the Cause to others right now, and also tell your 
playmates about it.  The Guardian is going to pray that you may 
grow up to be a shining light in the Cause of &Baha'u'llah.  
 
 
6 August 1943 
 
     The Master reflects the qualities of the Manifestations as if He 
were a mirror.  He reflects not only those of &Baha'u'llah but also 
of Christ as He is the exemplar of the spirit of the Prophet....  
     ...These matters are left to the discretion of the N.S.A.  The 
principle the Guardian has stated ... the addition of further 
regulations and rulings to those already laid down in the bye-laws 
he strongly discourages; he feels it is better, as far as possible, 
to settle problems as they arise rather than create too much red 
tape and hem in the spirit of the Cause into a rigid form.  
 
 
17 October 1944 
 
     There is a difference between character and faith; it is often 
very hard to accept this fact and put up with it, but the fact 
remains that a person may believe in and love the Cause--even 
to being ready to die for it--and yet not have a good personal 
character, or possess traits at variance with the teachings.  We 
should try to change, to let the Power of God help recreate us 
and make us true &Baha'is in deed as well as in belief.  But 
sometimes the process is slow, sometimes it never happens 
because the individual does not try hard enough.  But these things 
 
+P441 
cause us suffering and are a test to us in our fellow-believers, 
most especially if we love them and have been their teacher!  
     The Guardian would advise you to leave your friend to 
himself, to associate with him, his wife and sister-in-law with 
love and forbearance in every way possible, but not to agonise 
over the past or let it cloud your &Baha'i life.  You have given him 
the greatest gift in the world:  the Faith.  Now he must be 
responsible for his own soul.  Your prayers and example can no 
doubt reach and help him.  
     It is true the &Baha'is should try and live a normal healthy life.  
But we cannot for a moment overlook the abnormal state of the 
world.  If there had not been believers ready to give their health, 
comfort, pleasure--everything, for the Cause in these dark days, 
the work would not have gone on.  What are these sacrifices 
compared to keeping a beacon of the Light of &Baha'u'llah 
burning in dark London all these war years?  
     The Guardian is very glad to hear you are so active, both in 
teaching and administrative work, and he will pray that 
&Baha'u'llah may bless and guide you and enable you to serve the 
Cause in an ever increasing measure.  He will also pray for your 
personal happiness....  
 
 
27 November 1944 
 
     The work in England has, indeed, progressed slowly from the 
standpoint of enlarging the Faith's membership and establishing 
new centres and assemblies.  On the other hand, however, the 
British &Baha'is have consolidated the administration and thus 
prepared the way for intensified teaching activities when 
conditions make life easier for the people in that country.  They 
have also built up a very helpful institution in the Publishing 
Trust, one calculated to impress the public and aid greatly in 
their own and other countries' teaching programmes.  The Faith 
there needs more active, devoted, young believers like yourself.  
 
 
27 January 1945 
 
     He was very happy to hear of the marked progress the Cause 
has made in ... and that you have not only a number of new 
 
+P442 
believers but also are actively conducting fireside classes and 
hold public meetings.  All these are evidences of progress, and 
you should feel happy and encouraged about them.  
     The believers, as we all know, should endeavour to set such an 
example in their personal lives and conduct that others will feel 
impelled to embrace a Faith which reforms human character.  
However, unfortunately, not everyone achieves easily and 
rapidly the victory over self.  What every believer, new or old, 
should realise is that the Cause has the spiritual power to re-create 
us if we make the effort to let that power influence us, and 
the greatest help in this respect is prayer.  We must supplicate 
&Baha'u'llah to assist us to overcome the failings in our own 
characters, and also exert our own will-power in mastering 
ourselves.  
     He will certainly pray for the work of the beloved Cause 
there and especially that new souls may be attracted and embrace 
the Faith.  He will also pray that the believers may, for the sake 
of God, draw close to each other and not permit each other's 
short-comings to be a source of disunity and consequently a 
means of depriving thirsty souls of this life-giving Message!  The 
world is full of evil and dark forces and the friends must not 
permit these forces to get hold of them by thinking and feeling 
negatively towards each other....  
 
 
Undated 
 
     His (the Guardian's) burden is truly so heavy--no doubt in 
the future people will see his life in its proper perspective and be 
able to appreciate what he has done, to all intents and purposes 
entirely alone, for the Cause.  
 
 
10 May 1945 
 
     Many of the most valuable, enkindled and erudite teachers the 
Cause has possessed were formerly members of the clergy, 
&Islamic or Christian.  
 
 
+P443 
7 July 1945 
 
     What England needs is a higher percentage of people able to 
meet and attract the public on a large scale, and he hopes you 
will, in the course of giving the Message to every soul that 
yearns for it, make a special effort to confirm people who in their 
turn will be able to arise and broadcast the teachings.  
     The efforts of the friends are, of course, needed to accomplish 
the objectives of the Six Year Teaching Plan, and they should be 
encouraged to do their part, even though they may imagine 
themselves incapable of discharging such duties!  
     The Tablet of Visitation is a compilation of words of 
&Baha'u'llah, revealed at different times for those who were far 
from Him, made by &Nabil, at the Master's instruction, after the 
Ascension of &Baha'u'llah....  
 
 
3 March 1946 
 
     A city like London needs a really impressive, central and 
suitable room which will, on its own merits, create a favourable 
impression, and he hopes the friends will bear this in mind, and 
at the earliest possible date get quarters that are not in a basement.  
     As to attracting the youth; there must be a great number of 
serious-minded people coming back to civilian life.  Of course 
youth attracts youth, and if once an active nucleus of young 
&Baha'is could be formed, and conduct their own meetings no 
doubt they would soon get others interested.  
 
 
4 March 1946 
 
     He (the Guardian) was very sorry to hear that ... has left the 
Cause, and suggests that you point out to her, and to any other 
of the friends who are confused and upset over this matter, that 
the Manifestation of God only gives us teachings and instructions 
designed for our good and protection, and that if each person 
reserves the right to obey his own conscience, the logical 
conclusion is we don't need any spiritual authority to guide and 
protect us, the authority of our own consciences is sufficient!  
 
+P444 
     What &Abdu'l-Baha always pointed out in this matter is that 
these psychic powers were not to be used in this world, and that, 
indeed, it was dangerous to cultivate them here.  They should be 
left dormant, and not exploited, even when we do so with the 
sincere belief we are helping others.  We do not understand their 
nature and have no way of being sure of what is true and what 
is false in such matters.  
     If children are inclined to be psychic they should not be 
blamed for it too harshly, they should not be encouraged to 
strengthen their powers in this direction.  
     People who do not feel they can obey or accept the Teachings 
on a subject cannot be considered &Baha'is, voting or otherwise.  
If a time comes when they feel ready to surrender their opinions 
to One we believe divinely guided, they should be joyously 
welcomed back into the Faith.  
     P.S.  These friends you mention are being upset over this 
question should realise that if they reserve the right to disregard 
the Teachings on one subject, they must give the same right to 
other &Baha'is, and obviously there can be no unity or strength in 
a Faith composed of individuals who only believe in part and not 
all of it.  We must never prefer our wills to the Will of God.  
 
 
19 March 1946 
 
     The &Baha'is should refrain from signing petitions designed to 
bring pressure on the Government which may have any political 
character whatsoever.  There are so many other people who can 
carry on progressive types of activity, but only the &Baha'is can do 
the work of &Baha'u'llah....  
 
 
21 May 1946 
 
     Keeping the Fast is enjoined upon all &Baha'is, regardless of 
nationality; it has a very salutary effect both physically and 
spiritually, and the friends should realise &Baha'u'llah never would 
have instituted it if it were detrimental to the health.  The Master 
referred to the Fast in talks to pilgrims, and some Tablets, but 
most material on this subject is not yet translated.  
 
 
+P445 
20 November 1946 
 
     The Master unceasingly emphasised the importance of unity 
among the friends, and, if anything, it is of even greater 
importance in this present chaotic state of the world than it was 
in His days.  The people are longing for an example--proof that 
harmony and love can actually exist in a community--and it is 
one of the primary duties of the &Baha'is to demonstrate these 
great principles in their relations with each other.  
 
 
15 February 1947 
 
     Philosophy, as you will study it and later teach it, is certainly 
not one of the sciences that begins and ends in words.  Fruitless 
excursions into metaphysical hair-splitting is meant, not a sound 
branch of learning like philosophy.  
     We have no historical proof of the truth of the Master's 
statement regarding the Greek philosophers visiting the Holy 
Land, etc. but such proof may come to light through research in 
the future.  
     As regards your own studies:  he would advise you not to 
devote too much of your time to the abstract side of philosophy, 
but rather to approach it from a more historical angle.  As to 
correlating philosophy with the &Baha'i teachings; this is a 
tremendous work which scholars in the future can undertake.  
We must remember that not only are all the teachings not yet 
translated into English, but they are not even all collected yet.  
Many important Tablets may still come to light which are at 
present owned privately.  
 
 
18 February 1947 
 
     He (the Guardian) wishes he more often got such glad news 
in one letter!  It seems that at last the Cause in England is really 
getting into its stride, and that the British community of 
believers are beginning to show forth the fruits of the many 
blessings showered on them--for England was one of the first 
 
+P446 
countries of the West to hear the Divine Message, and was 
blessed by two visits from the Centre of the Covenant!  Surely 
the older &Baha'is must be astonished to see new centres springing 
up in a matter of months after years of an almost static condition!  
It shows that wherever and whenever the friends arise to serve, 
the mysterious power latent in this Divine Cause rushes in to 
bless and reinforce their labours far beyond their fondest hopes.  
     He is very happy to hear you are established as a pioneer, with 
a business of your own, and you may be sure he will pray for 
your material as well as spiritual success in this goal town....  
 
 
27 September 1947 
 
     There is no objection to children who are as yet unable to 
memorise a whole prayer learning certain sentences only.  
     He (the Guardian) does not feel that the friends should make 
a practice of saying grace or of teaching it to children.  This is not 
part of the &Baha'i Faith, but a Christian practice, and as the Cause 
embraces members of all religions we should be careful not to 
introduce into it the customs of our previous beliefs.  &Baha'u'llah 
has given us the obligatory prayers, also prayers before sleeping, 
for travellers, etc., we should not introduce a new set of prayers 
He has not specified, when He has given us already so many for 
so many occasions....  
 
 
27 September 1947 
 
     He (the Guardian) does not feel you should permit your 
speech impediment to give you a sense of inferiority.  Moses 
stammered!  And what you are and what you believe as a &Baha'i 
give you a tremendous advantage over others.  This does not 
mean that you should not make every effort to overcome it, and 
go to doctors for advice and assistance.  He also assures you he 
will pray that you may overcome this difficulty entirely, also 
that wherever you are the way will open for you to teach and 
serve the Faith.  
 
 
+P447 
13 October 1947 
 
     Regarding your own condition:  he (the Guardian) strongly 
urges you not to dwell on yourself.  Each one of us, if we look 
into our failures, is sure to feel unworthy and despondent, and 
this feeling only frustrates our constructive efforts and wastes 
time.  The thing for us to focus on is the glory of the Cause and 
the Power of &Baha'u'llah which can make of a mere drop a 
surging sea!  You certainly have no right to feel negative; you 
have embraced this glorious Faith and arisen with devotion to 
serve it, and your labours are greatly appreciated by both the 
Guardian and your &fellow-Baha'is.  With something as positive 
as the Faith and all it teaches behind you, you should be a 
veritable lion of confidence, and he will pray that you may 
become so.  
     There is, unfortunately, no way that one can force his own 
good upon a man.  The element of free will is there and all we 
believers--and even the Manifestation of God Himself--can do 
is to offer the truth to mankind.  If the people of the world persist, 
as they seem to be doing, in their blind materialism, they must 
bear the consequences in a prolongation of their present 
condition, and even a worsening of it.  Our duty as &Baha'is is to 
build up such a love and unity within our own ranks that the 
people will be attracted by this example to the Cause.  We also 
must teach all we can and strengthen the &Baha'i community in 
the Administration.  But more we cannot do to avert the great 
sufferings which seemingly still lie ahead of the world in its 
present evil state.  
 
 
14 October 1947 
 
     Summer School is, indeed, a wonderful experience, for at the 
present time it is the only institution that affords the &Baha'is of 
England an opportunity of all living together, for however short 
a time, as a community, and this and the spirit it engenders, has 
a very inspiring affect.  
 
 
19 October 1947 
 
     He (the Guardian) does not feel that it is desirable to lay down 
any conditions for giving to the &Baha'i Fund.  This is an entirely 
 
+P448 
personal matter, and each believer must act according to his own 
judgment and the needs of the Faith.  In times of crisis, whether 
in the affairs of the Cause or in one's own family, people naturally 
behave differently from under normal circumstances.  But 
decisions in these matters must rest with each individual &Baha'i.  
     Generally speaking the secretary of an assembly must be 
careful to convey exactly what the majority decision or advice 
of the body was.  There can surely be no objection to his putting 
it in proper terms and clarifying the matter according to the 
decision or instruction of the assembly.  But he should of course 
not introduce his personal views unless endorsed by the assembly.  
     The nature of assembly minutes is a matter for the body itself 
to decide.  Naturally all important subjects brought up and notes 
must be recorded, but how detailed the record must be is for the 
members themselves to decide.  
     &Abdu'l-Baha said we must sacrifice the important for the 
most important.  The most important thing now for the English 
&Baha'is is to accomplish their Plan.  The sacrifice of other 
activities, cultural or otherwise, is not of very much importance 
compared to their goal.  They can always return, when they have 
more time, to such pursuits.  To serve any great Cause or purpose 
requires sacrifice....  
     &Baha'u'llah is not the intermediary between other Manifestations 
and God.  Each has His own relation to the Primal Source.  
But in the sense that &Baha'u'llah is the greatest Manifestation to 
yet appear, the One who consummates the Revelation of Moses, 
He was the One Moses conversed with in the Burning Bush.  In 
other words, &Baha'u'llah identifies the glory of the God-Head on 
that occasion with Himself.  No distinction can be made amongst 
the Prophets in the sense that They all proceed from one Source, 
and are of one essence.  But Their stations and functions in this 
world are different.  
 
 
4 March 1948 
 
     It is not surprising, in view of the gloom overhanging the 
entire world, and in conjunction with their run-down, exhausted 
state due to war conditions and present circumstances of life in 
England, that the British &Baha'is should sometimes reflect the 
 
+P449 
state of their countrymen!  It is a pity, and they should certainly 
try, as believers, to be cheerful and radiant; but he (the Guardian) 
feels the greatest sympathy for them, and considers that when 
their present achievements are assessed in future, people will give 
them a double measure of praise for having done so much when 
they were least fit to do it.  The spirit of determination, and their 
perseverance, are truly outstanding.  
     Just because some people have lost their vision of the Cause, or 
never had a proper grasp of its implications before entering it, 
and leave the fold, should not cause undue discouragement.  
There are bound to be such cases, and although every moral 
support should be given them, if they still wish to withdraw, 
they fall off--as you said--like withered leaves from the Tree 
of the Faith, and do it no real harm.  
     He likes to be provided with facts by the friends, when they 
ask his advice, for although his decisions are guided by God, he 
is not, like the Prophet, omniscient at will, in spite of the fact that 
he often senses a situation or condition without having any 
detailed knowledge of it....  
 
 
26 March 1948 
 
     One of the greatest problems in the Cause is the relation of the 
believers to each other; for their immaturity (shared with the 
rest of humanity) and imperfections retard the work, create 
complications, and discourage each other.  And yet we must put 
up with these things and try and combat them through love, 
patience and forgiveness individually, and proper administrative 
action collectively.  
 
 
8 April 1948 
 
     We &Baha'is firmly believe that it is possible, if we have the 
right spirit, to make our stumbling blocks stepping-stones to 
progress.  You have already, through at last facing yourself and 
acknowledging that you have both failed and erred in managing 
your life so far, set your feet on the right path.  But now this new 
and spiritual condition in you is going to be proved--and the 
 
+P450 
proving, the testing, will surely consist of the way you determine 
to take your punishment.  
     Life is based on laws:  physical, man-made, and spiritual.  As 
you have broken the laws of the society in which you live, you 
will have to stand up like a man and take your punishment.  The 
spirit in which you do this is the most important thing, and 
constitutes a great opportunity for you.  He (the Guardian) 
advises you to turn your face towards the future, to realise that 
when you are set free you have loving and helpful friends to go 
to, an upright job awaiting you, and you can also become active 
in serving our glorious Faith.  So really everything lies before 
you.  But at present, until your sentence is up, you must live 
within yourself in a way not to spoil the new future awaiting 
you.  You must not become bitter--for after all you are only 
reaping what you planted.  &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha, through 
no crime of their own, spent the better part of their lives in exile 
and imprisoned, but they never became embittered although 
they were the victims of injustice.  You, on the other hand, are 
the victim of injustice which you have inflicted on yourself--
therefore you certainly have no right to be bitter towards the 
world.  
     He urges you to grasp firmly the teachings of our Faith, the 
love of your family and many &Baha'i friends, to put the past 
behind entirely, realising that it can do you no more harm; on 
the contrary, through changing you and making you spiritually 
aware, this very past can be a means of enriching your life in the 
future!  He will certainly ardently pray for your happiness, your 
victory over yourself, and that you may become an exemplary 
and active &Baha'i.  
 
 
9 June 1948 
 
     "Reciting" the Greatest Name means to repeat it over and 
over, silently or out loud....  
     The chairman of the local assembly is, if present, the logical 
and appropriate person to take charge of the consultation period 
between the assembly and the community members at the 
Nineteen Day Feast.  
 
 
+P451 
23 June 1948 
 
     He (the Guardian) encouraged him to face manfully the 
future, accept the legitimate sanction of society as punishment 
for his admittedly anti-social conduct, and realise that his very 
suffering, humiliation and punishment can--if he will let it--be 
the means of freeing him from many of his past weaknesses and 
mistakes, and making him a worthy member of society.  He 
should look to the future, for there is in his power, with 
&Baha'u'llah's help, to shape into a worthy and constructive way 
of life....  
     The English &Baha'is did gloriously succeed after all!  Hitching 
one's wagon to a star, however impractical it may seem, does 
bring results, for man, with God to help him, does possess 
strengths far beyond the mere materialist's ken!  
     As regards your question about p. 41, &Kitab-i-Iqan; to say that, 
after 622 A.D., Christendom was &Islam in disguise is a little 
misleading.  The Sun of Truth, after the advent of &Muhammad, 
no longer shone from the Christian horizon.  &Islam was, from 
then until the &Bab's advent, the Path of Truth.  
     We should never insist on teaching those who are not really 
ready for the Cause.  If a man is not hungry, you cannot make 
him eat.  Among the Theosophists there are, no doubt, many 
receptive souls, but those who are satisfied should be just 
associated with in a friendly way, but let alone.  Once a seeker 
comes to accept the concept of progressive religion, and accepts 
&Baha'u'llah as the Manifestation for this day, the reincarnation 
concept will fade away in the light of truth; we should try and 
avoid controversial issues in the beginning if possible.  
     &Mirza &Abu'l-Fadl was a very excellent and erudite &Baha'i 
teacher.  Although he did err sometimes, yet in identifying 
Abraham with Zoroaster, he is not confusing the Prophet 
Abraham with the Prophet Zoroaster, as the name of Zoroaster 
was supposed to have been "Abram".  
 
 
20 September 1948 
 
     He (the Guardian) is very happy indeed to see the change in 
your attitude and to hear that you are now not only a recognised 
member of our Faith, but a prospective &Baha'i pioneer!  
 
+P452 
     It is quite natural for anyone, observing the present state of the 
world, to feel very depressed and apprehensive of the future.  
Any intelligent person must be wondering what you are 
wondering.  It is indeed hard to see what lies ahead of us in the 
near future--but we, as &Baha'is, unlike most people, have 
absolute assurance that the distant future is serene and bright.  We 
do not know if there will be another Great War; what we do 
know is this:  that unless people become spiritually awakened in 
time, great suffering, maybe in the form of war, will come upon 
them, for humanity must be unified, must be redeemed.  If men 
refuse absolutely to take the easier road of faith, of seeking out 
God's Manifestation for this age and accepting Him, then they 
will bring upon themselves a fresh crisis in human affairs and 
very great affliction.  What we, as &Baha'is, must do is our duty; 
we cannot do other people's duty for them, alas, but we can fulfil 
our own sacred responsibilities by serving our fellow-men, 
living a &Baha'i life, teaching the Faith, and strengthening its 
budding world order.  
     He urges you, just as you have surmounted the crisis in your 
own life, through faith and courage, to now go out and serve the 
Cause with that same faith and courage.  We must leave to God 
the final reckoning with His creatures today--but meantime we 
must give them His Message.  
 
 
17 October 1948 
 
     The Cause in England seems, in spite of financial handicaps, to 
be going forward in Seven League boots.  He (the Guardian) is 
truly proud of the British believers, and this is more than he 
could say in the past, when the work for years seemed to be 
stagnating!  Those days are now passed forever, he feels sure.  
 
 
23 December 1948 
 
     He (the Guardian) is very glad to see you are now living the 
life of an active &Baha'i and keeping in close touch with dear ... 
who is a fine friend to have, with his devotion to the Cause and 
his optimism.  
 
+P453 
     The Guardian urges you not to be discouraged by any setbacks 
you may have.  Life is a process of trials and testings, and these 
are--contrary to what we are prone to thinking--good for us, 
and give us stamina, and teach us to rely on God.  Knowing He 
will help us, we can help ourselves more.  
     He does not know how, in the present very chaotic state of the 
world, you could find just the kind of job you want of driving 
abroad.  Positions are difficult to obtain and travel so complicated.  
Unless you can migrate out to Africa or Australia, in some 
regular government scheme, he would urge you to persevere in 
Great Britain and do the best you can.  He urges you, in the next 
job you have, to pray whenever you feel the conditions at work 
are too much for you.  You will find you are helped and 
strengthened and once you get established in some position you 
may work yourself up, or go on with good references to a better 
employment later on....  
 
 
8 January 1949 
 
     The only people who are truly free of the "dross of self" are 
the Prophets, for to be free of one's ego is a hall-mark of 
perfection.  We humans are never going to become perfect, for 
perfection belongs to a realm we are not destined to enter.  
However, we must constantly mount higher, seek to be more 
perfect.  
     The ego is the animal in us, the heritage of the flesh which is 
full of selfish desires.  By obeying the laws of God, seeking to live 
the life laid down in our teachings, and prayer and struggle, we 
can subdue our egos.  We call people "saints" who have achieved 
the highest degree of mastery over their egos.  
     There is no contradiction between Gleanings p. 66 and p. 262.  
In one place He says the mirror will never be free from dross, in 
the other place He says it will be "so cleared as to be able" etc.  It is a 
relative thing; perfection will never be reached, but great and 
ever greater, progress can be made.  
     The word "Guardian" in the Seven Valleys has no connection 
with the &Baha'i Guardianship.  
     The &Qur'an should be to some extent studied by the &Baha'is 
but they certainly need not seek to acquire a mastery over it, 
 
+P454 
which would take years, unless they really want to.  All Divine 
Revelation seems to have been thrown out in flashes.  The 
Prophets never composed treatises.  That is why in the &Qur'an 
and our own Writings different subjects are so often included in 
one Tablet.  It pulsates, so to speak.  That is why it is "Revelation".  
     Life is a constant struggle, not only against forces around us, 
but above all against our own ego.  We can never afford to rest 
on our own oars, for if we do, we soon see ourselves carried 
down stream again.  Many of those who drift away from the 
Cause do so for the reason that they had ceased to go on 
developing.  They became complacent or indifferent, and 
consequently ceased to draw the spiritual strength and vitality 
from the Cause which they should have.  Sometimes, of course, 
people fail because of a test they just do not meet, and often our 
severest tests come from each other.  Certainly the believer 
should try to avert such things, and if they happen, remedy them 
through love.  Generally speaking nine-tenths of the friends' 
troubles are because they don't do the &Baha'i thing, in relation to 
each other, to the administrative bodies or in their personal lives.  
     No doubt to the degree we &Baha'is the world over strive to 
spread the Cause and live up to its teachings, there will be some 
mitigation of the suffering of the peoples of the world.  But it 
seems apparent that the great failure to respond to &Baha'u'llah's 
instructions, appeals and warnings issued in the 19th century, has 
now sent the world along a path, or released forces, which must 
culminate in a still more violent upheaval and agony.  The thing 
is out of hand, so to speak, and it is too late to avert catastrophic 
trials.  
     You should never be too depressed about your dissatisfaction 
concerning not finding a job you like, a place in the world that 
fits you.  If you analyse it this general sense of mis-fit is one of the 
curses of your generation, one of the products of the world's 
disequilibrium and chaos.  It is not confined to your life, it is 
pretty general.  
 
 
20 March 1949 
 
     He (the Guardian) fully realises that some decisions are very 
hard to take in life, and he urges you in this case to do two 
 
+P455 
things:  in the first place, are you quite sure two years voice-training 
will really carry you where you hope it will?  In other 
words, he presumes that your teacher's opinion has been backed 
up by the opinion of other professionals?  It would be a great pity 
to, in any way, sacrifice your service to the Cause for a career 
which in the end might not prove a substantial one.  And in the 
second place he advises you to remain in ... and continue your 
studies (once you are quite assured about the outcome), providing 
the Plan does not reach such a critical point that it is imperative 
for you to go as a pioneer in order to really help save the 
situation.  If this need arises in such urgency, he certainly feels you 
should temporarily give up your singing lessons, for, of course, 
no sacrifice is too great for the Cause.  What we put into serving 
it we know serves a useful and worthy purpose, whereas the 
outcome of our struggles in life is never assured completely, and 
is certainly insignificant compared to the Faith's importance.  
 
 
22 July 1949 
 
     The work on the Shrine--now beginning to rise visibly at the 
corners--and the spread of the Faith which brings many 
communications from new places, and many problems too, 
keeps us all busy as never before, especially the Guardian.  But to 
see the course going ahead so fast fills our hearts with gratitude 
and the work involved seems a small contribution to make to 
such a Holy Cause.  
     As regards to the question you asked me to put to the Guardian 
about the Aqdas and the House of Justice elections:  as most of the 
laws of the Aqdas cannot at present be enforced anywhere he has 
not deemed it necessary or wise to translate and promulgate 
them.  You can orally translate them for any of the believers 
anxious to know exactly what they are.  The National Assemblies 
(or Houses of Justice) will elect directly the International House 
of Justice, but just what form this election will take must be 
decided in the future when the proper time comes.  Neither the 
Master nor the Guardian have made any pronouncements about 
punishments stipulated in the Aqdas.  
 
 
+P456 
25 July 1949 
 
     There are no quotations from the &Qur'an to support the 
Master's statement that European thinkers acknowledge the 
influence of &Islam in shaping the thought of Europe.  In the 
"Gleanings", page 95 (third printing Jan. 1943) &Baha'u'llah 
says:--"Of old it has been revealed:  Love of one's country is an 
element of the Faith of God!"  Here &Baha'u'llah is quoting not the 
&Qur'an but an &Islamic tradition, and it is this statement which the 
Guardian has used as the basis of his argument in the "Promised 
Day" that nationhood grew out of the direct influence of 
&Muhammad's teachings, and was one of the great contributions 
to mankind's evolution of &Islam.  The building up of nations 
came after &Muhammad, and was a step forward in the direction 
of a unified world which the teachings of &Baha'u'llah has 
provided for.  
 
 
22 October 1949 
     We must not only be patient with others, infinitely patient!, 
but also with our own poor selves, remembering that even the 
Prophets of God sometimes got tired and cried out in despair!  
     The end of the Plan is in view, and a long last push will, he 
sincerely hopes and believes, bring success and a breathing space.  
     Regarding your questions:  it is not the City State, but the 
National State which &Muhammad's teachings fostered.  Christ 
had nothing to do with the City State concept in any direct 
manner.  
     The 100 years respite is only the phrase used by the Guardian 
to convey the idea that for a 100 years or so the Cause had not 
been recognised.  It draws no parallel between this century and 
the last one, nor does it imply a repetition of events.  
     The Hidden Words have no sequence.  They are jewel-like 
thoughts sent out of the mind of the Manifestation of God to 
admonish and counsel men.  Unfortunately &Baha'u'llah was never 
asked, and never, as far as we know, stated, what the force was 
mentioned by Him in the "Epistle".  There is nothing in the 
"Mysterious Forces of Civilization" implying that these great 
conquerors were not blood thirsty.  
 
+P457 
     A healthy social life and &Baha'i work can go hand in hand, but 
not always in times of crisis, such as these days the Cause is 
passing through--and the world--when great sacrifice can alone 
meet the demands of the situation.  
     He urges you to persevere and add up your accomplishments, 
rather than to dwell on the dark side of things.  Everyone's life 
has both a dark and bright side.  The Master said:  turn your back 
to the darkness and your face to Me.  
 
 
18 February 1950 
 
     He (the Guardian) feels that if you consider it too much of a 
strain to keep the Fast you should not do so.  &Baha'u'llah has 
exempted people who are travellers at the time; if you could 
keep it the days you are not travelling, and thus partake of its 
bounty, it would be advisable, but it is not essential.  
 
 
28 March 1950 
 
     The beloved Guardian, having been in touch with you by 
cable, and being more over-worked this year than ever, delayed 
answering.  You know, from what you saw here, how 
inefficient--to under-state the matter--his servants are.  The 
work at the Shrine has vastly increased and of necessity, for as the 
first part of the building will soon be finished, the grounds 
around it have been entirely remodelled to fit it better and show 
it off.  All this he has been forced to superintend and plan 
personally.  The attacks and status of the enemies you know 
about.  So that in all he is very tired.  
 
 
4 October 1950 
 
     We must never take one sentence in the Teachings and isolate 
it from the rest:  it does not mean we must not love, but we must 
reach a spiritual plane where God comes first and great human 
passions are unable to turn us away from Him.  All the time we 
see people who either through the force of hate or the passionate 
 
+P458 
attachment they have to another person, sacrifice principle or 
bar themselves from the Path of God.  
     We know absence of light is darkness, but no one would assert 
darkness was not a fact.  It exists even though it is only the 
absence of something else.  So evil exists too, and we cannot close 
our eyes to it, even though it is a negative existence.  We must 
seek to supplant it by good, and if we see an evil person is not 
influenceable by us, then we should shun his company for it is 
unhealthy.  
     We must love God, and in this state a general love for all men 
becomes possible.  We cannot love each human being for himself, 
but our feeling towards humanity should be motivated by our 
love for the Father who created all men.  
     The &Baha'i Faith teaches man was always potentially man, 
even when passing through lower stages of evolution.  Because 
he has more powers, and subtler powers than the animal, when 
he turns towards evil he becomes more vicious than an animal 
because of these very powers.  
     Many Theosophists accept &Baha'u'llah as a Prophet, but we 
have no special relation to theosophy.  It would seem that the 
Master had some special reason for not mentioning &Baha'u'llah 
specifically in His talk to the Theosophists in Budapest.  What it 
was we do not know, but we can assume His great tact and 
wisdom impelled Him not to on that occasion.  
 
 
20 October 1950 
 
     He (the Guardian) feels that in as far as possible the African 
pioneers should seek to get a job which will take them to one of 
the countries chosen and ensure employment for them there.  It 
does not seem wise or necessary for a &Baha'i to stress the fact he 
or she is going to teach.  A person's religion is their own business, 
and they can talk about it privately as much as they like without 
neglecting their employer's work.  
     Also, he feels no rules can be laid down about how to teach.  
Usually one teaches those receptive souls one finds.  The same 
should apply to the beginning of the work in Africa.  Any direct 
teaching work with the more primitive tribes would have to be 
done after finding out the best and most tactful way of doing it.  
 
+P459 
The first step is to get to Africa, and, in view of the cost involved, 
and the state of the Fund, the pioneers should make every effort 
to get sent out there or at least get employment after arriving, 
thus relieving the &Baha'i Fund as much as possible.  If this fails, 
then of course all the expense will have to be paid by the Fund.  
 
 
11 January 1951 
 
     You have voiced the same suffering, the sign of the same 
mystery, as has been voiced by almost all those who have been 
called upon to serve God.  Even the Prophets of God, we know, 
suffered agony when the Spirit of God descended on Them and 
commanded Them to arise and preach.  Look at Moses saying, 
"I am a stutterer!".  Look at &Muhammad rolled in His rug in 
agony!  The Guardian himself suffered terribly when he learned 
he was the one who had been made the Guardian.  
     So you see your sense of inadequacy, your realisation of your 
own unworthiness is not unique at all.  Many, from the Highest 
to the humblest have had it.  Now the wisdom of it is this:  it is 
such seemingly weak instruments that demonstrate that God is 
the Power achieving the victories and not men.  If you were a 
wealthy, prominent, strong individual who knew all about 
Africa and looked upon going out there as fun, any service you 
render, and victories you have, would be laid to your personality, 
not to the Cause of God!  But because the reverse is true, your 
services will be a witness to the Power of &Baha'u'llah and Truth 
of His Faith.  
     Rest assured, dear sister, you will ever-increasingly be 
sustained, and you will find joy and strength given to you, and 
God will reward you.  You will pass through these dark hours 
triumphant.  The first &Baha'i going on such an historic mission 
could not but suffer--but the compensation will be great....  
 
 
10 February 1951 
 
     Whenever you see tremendous personal problems in your 
private lives, such as those the parents of ... have been called 
 
+P460 
upon to face, you must remember that these afflictions are part 
of human life; and, according to our teachings one of their 
wisdoms is to teach us the impermanence of this world and the 
permanence of the spiritual bonds that we establish with God, 
His Prophet, and those who are alive in the faith of God.  You 
must always remember that the Manifestations of God, 
Themselves, were not immune to suffering of the most human 
nature; and that from the hands of their relatives, they drank the 
bitterest potions, &Baha'u'llah even being proffered poison by His 
half-brother, &Mirza &Yahya.  Beside their afflictions, our afflictions, 
however terrible for us, must seem small in comparison.  
     Regarding your personal affairs, the Guardian will pray that 
your cherished hopes may be fulfilled; and that the way may 
open, if you both desire it, for you to serve together the Faith 
you are so deeply attached to.  Never lose heart, and always 
remember that the power in this Cause is of a nature not 
understood or accessible to those who have not our faith in 
&Baha'u'llah.  
 
 
30 August 1951 
 
     The progress being made in Africa is truly miraculous, as if a 
special benediction from on High is being extended to this work...  
He (the Guardian) feels sure that the work in Uganda will 
now go forward rapidly.  The news from Dar is wonderful too...  
The racial question all over Africa is very acute, but, while 
being wise and tactful, believers must realise that their standard 
is far from that of the white colonials.  They have not gone there 
to uphold the white man's supremacy, but to give the Cause of 
God to, primarily, the black man whose home is Africa.  
 
 
11 November 1951 
 
     Many times the young &Baha'is these days seem to be living the 
lives of soldiers, and in a way the pioneers are the soldiers of 
&Baha'u'llah, going out to plant the banner of His dominion in far 
corners of the earth!  
 
 
+P461 
5 October 1952 
 
     What the Master meant in the words you quoted is simply 
that joy gives one more freedom to create; if the Prophets, the 
Master Himself, and the Guardian, had less problems and 
worries, They could give forth a great deal more creatively to 
the Cause.  When He said that "grow to be as a fruitful tree" he 
meant that, by lifting burdens from the Guardian and trying as 
much as possible to do our share of the work of the Faith, we 
would help Shoghi Effendi to develop his full powers as Guardian 
and, through the Covenant, the Cause would spread its shadow 
over all men.  This we have seen happen in the last 30 years, but 
that does not mean we must not try to our utmost to help him 
by our lives and our services.  
     Teaching is an individual matter; one has to sense when it is 
right to go further in revealing the Source of our Message; no 
rules exist, really, for such things.  
 
 
3 March 1955 
 
     As we almost never attain any spiritual goal without seeing 
the next goal we must attain still beyond our reach, he urges you, 
who have come so far already on the path of spirituality, not to 
fret about the distance you still have to cover!  It is an indefinite 
journey, and, no doubt in the next world the soul is privileged 
to draw closer to God than is possible when bound on this 
physical plane.  
 
 
6 March 1955 
 
     As regards the questions you have asked, as &Baha'u'llah says 
categorically that God commanded Abraham to offer up &Isma'il, 
as far as we are concerned, it is &Isma'il who was the intended 
sacrifice.  
     In view of the great antiquity of Genesis, it is quite possible 
that at some period the names were changed, and the error was 
propagated.  
 
+P462 
     Whatever happened, we &Baha'is must follow the words in our 
own Scriptures as being the most authentic.  
     In the Tablet of the Holy Mariner, the Youth means 
&Baha'u'llah, Himself.  
 
 
12 January 1957 
 
     In the &Baha'i Teachings it is made quite clear that when one is 
ill, one should seek the best available medical advice.  This 
naturally leaves a person free to choose what they consider good 
in medical opinion.  If you and ... feel that she is improving 
under the care of your own doctor, and ... is willing to wait and 
be patient and see if she goes on making progress, there can 
surely be no objection to her doing this.  There are a great many 
as you know mental diseases and troubles at present, and the one 
thing &Baha'is must not do is take a defeatist attitude toward 
them.  The power in the Faith is such that it can sustain us on a 
much higher level in spite of whatever our ailments might be 
than other people who are denied it.  This however does not 
mean that we should ignore medical opinion and treatment.  On 
the contrary, we should do our best to procure the opinion of 
specialists and competent doctors.  
 
 
15 August 1957 
 
     You should not allow the remarks made by the &Baha'is to hurt 
or depress you, but should forget the personalities, and arise to do 
all you can, yourself, to teach the Faith.  
     &Baha'u'llah enjoins work on all.  No one need ever be ashamed 
of his job.  
 
 
+P463 
                           "THEIR DAILY SUSTENANCE" 

     In his last message to the British &Baha'i community as a whole 
the Guardian wrote:  

     May they, as they forge ahead along the high road leading to 
ultimate, total and complete victory, receive as their daily sustenance, 
a still fuller measure of the abounding grace, promised to the believers 
of an earlier generation by the Centre of the Covenant, the Author of 
the Divine Plan, Himself, on the occasion of His twice-repeated visit 
to their shores, and which has been unfailingly vouchsafed to 
themselves, in the course of over three decades, since the birth of the 
Formative Age of the Faith and the rise of its Administrative Order 
in their homeland.

DR. JOHN E. ESSLEMONT 
Hand of the Cause of God                                       page 9 
     Born in 1874 and accepted the Faith in early 1915, Dr. Esslemont 
was elevated to the rank of Hand of the Cause of God after his 
passing on 22 November 1925 and linked by the Guardian with 
George Townshend and Thomas Breakwell, on the passing of 
George Townshend, as "One of three luminaries shedding 
brilliant lustre annals Irish, English, Scottish &Baha'i communities".  
He was "Vice-President" of the first National Assembly from 
October 1923 until November 1924.  For fuller details of his life 
and works read "Dr. J. E. Esslemont" by Dr. Moojan Momen.

EDWARD THEODORE HALL                                           page 9 
     First heard of the Faith in 1910 in the Salford, Lancashire area 
and with his wife Rebecca, her brother John Charles and his wife 
Hester Ann Craven, made contact with Sarah Ann Ridgway, 
one of the earliest British &Baha'is, and later established the second 
&Baha'i Group in the British Isles.  In 1912 Mr. Hall and Mr. 
Craven went to Liverpool and met &Abdu'l-Baha at the boat.  
Five Tablets from the Master were received.  In 1922 the first 
Spiritual Assembly was formed in Manchester with E. T. Hall as 
Secretary.  He also "represented" Manchester on the first National 
Spiritual Council in 1922, and was a member of the National 
Assembly until 1928.  He was entrusted by Shoghi Effendi with 
part of his early diaries and later maintained a close correspondence 
with the Guardian for many years.  His book, "The &Baha'i 
Dawn; Manchester" paints a vivid picture of the early days of 
the Faith in Lancashire.  Through Mr. Hall's correspondence 
with the Editor of the `John O'Groats Journal' (Mr. R. J. G. 
Millar) frequent reviews and letters were published for 
nineteen years until the Editor's retirement.  He passed away on 
5 December 1962 aged 82.  
 
 
MRS. THORNBURGH-CROPPER                                        page 9 
     One of the first &Baha'is of the West and possibly the first &Baha'i 
resident in England.  Her early &Baha'i life is described in "The 
Chosen Highway" and in "The &Baha'i World", Vol. VIII, 
pp. 649-51.  She was a member of the National Spiritual 
 
+P468 
Assembly for its first two years and it was in her house in 
Westminster that the first meeting of the "All-England &Baha'i 
Council" was held on 6 June 1922.  She passed away on 15 March 
1938.  
 
 
GEORGE PALGRAVE SIMPSON                                        page 9 
     Was associated with the Administration of the Faith in the 
British Isles from its earliest days.  Elected as Chairman of the first 
"Spiritual Council" and President of the "National Spiritual 
Assembly" in 1923.  He also served as the Assistant Secretary and 
the Treasurer for some years.  All the early letters from the 
Guardian were addressed to him and the file copies of his letters 
to the Holy Land, some to the Guardian and others to the 
various secretaries, as well as the Minutes in his handwriting, 
give us our closest insight into the conditions obtaining in the 
1920's.  At one stage he felt obliged to resign from the National 
Assembly but was still called upon to remain as its Treasurer and 
attend the meetings!  He served the Cause with great distinction 
until his death on 31 August 1934.  (See letter 30 September 
1934.)  
 
 
MISS ETHEL JENNER ROSENBERG                                    page 11 
     "One of the pioneers of the &Baha'i Cause in the Western World".  
Having first embraced the Faith in 1899 she soon afterwards 
went to &Akka, subsequently visiting many times both &Akka and 
Haifa for months at a time, learning from and assisting the 
Master in translating and transcribing the Teachings.  Beloved 
by all the members of the Holy Family, her passing in November 
1930 at the age of 72 evoked a cabled tribute from Shoghi 
Effendi, who knew her well in England and welcomed her in 
Haifa after the passing of &Abdu'l-Baha.  She was the one entrusted 
to bring the robe of &Baha'u'llah to England, and was a member 
of the National Assembly from 1923-1927.  ("&Baha'i World", 
Vol. IV, p. 263.)  
 
 
&DIA'U'LLAH &ASGHARZADIH, 
Knight of &Baha'u'llah                                        Page 24 
     Born in 1880 into a &Baha'i family which emigrated to &Ishqabad 
when he was fifteen years old, &Dia'u'llah was throughout his life 
an active &Baha'i.  His first pilgrimage was in 1903, his second was 
 
+P469 
seventeen years later, after which he settled in London, and his 
third was at the time of the passing of the Master when Shoghi 
Effendi gave him the task of making copies of the Master's Will 
from the original.  He was a member of the National Assembly 
for various periods between 1925 and 1941 and settled in Jersey 
as a Knight of &Baha'u'llah in 1953 at the age of 73.  He passed 
away in Jersey in April 1956. ("&Baha'i World", Vol. XIII, p. 881.)  
 
 
SARA, LADY BLOMFIELD (&SITARIH &KHANUM)                      Page 30 
     For fuller details of her devoted services to the Cause it is 
necessary to refer to "The Chosen Highway" and "The &Baha'i 
World", Vol. VIII, pp. 651-6.  Born in Ireland of a fearless 
Protestant mother and a strong Roman Catholic father, she 
understood from an early age the tragedy of religious intolerance 
which led her to search for Truth until she found the &Baha'i 
Revelation.  She was held in high esteem in the London society 
of the late "nineties" but she herself was always looking for the 
Promised One.  She was a great friend and admirer of Basil 
Wilberforce, Archdeacon of Westminster.  Not only did she 
place her home in Cadogan Gardens at the disposal of the Master 
during His London visits but she accompanied Him to Paris.  
While He was in America she went to Mount Pelerin, in 
Switzerland, to edit the rough notes of "Paris Talks", had them 
sent to Him for correction and had the book published in time 
for His second visit when He signed and gave away many copies.  
She accompanied Shoghi Effendi when he returned to Haifa 
after the passing of the Master and wrote the letter which was 
later published as "The Passing of &Abdu'l-Baha".  She was a 
member of the National Spiritual Assembly for eight of its first 
eleven years.  She passed away on the last day of 1939 and a 
remarkably fine obituary in the magazine "The World's 
Children" of March 1940 was headed "Lady Blomfield--Apostle 
of World Unity".  
 
 
GEORGE TOWNSHEND 
Hand of the Cause of God                                       Page 55 
     First corresponded with &Abdu'l-Baha about 1918.  The Master 
wrote to him "It is my hope that thy church will come under the 
heavenly Jerusalem".  For very many years he tried to bring to 
the clergy of the Church of Ireland and particularly the senior 
 
+P470 
ones, the realisation of &Baha'u'llah as Christ returned in the 
Glory of the Father.  In spite of his important books, "The Heart 
of the Gospel" and "The Promise of All Ages", no one in the 
church responded and in 1947 the Guardian called upon him to 
resign from the church.  He complied immediately and moved 
with his wife and two children to a small bungalow in Dundrum 
near Dublin.  He was one of the founder members of the first 
Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Dublin and in 1951 was 
elevated to the rank of Hand of the Cause.  For many years he 
gave distinguished services to the Guardian, not least of which 
was the writing of the introduction to "God Passes By" and his 
presentation on behalf of the Guardian of his paper "&Baha'u'llah's 
Ground Plan for World Fellowship" to the inaugural meeting of 
the World Congress of Faiths in 1936.  The pamphlet he wrote 
to all Christians under the title "The Old Churches and the New 
World Faith" was sent out to 10,000 so-called "responsible 
people" in the British Isles on the occasion of his resignation 
from the church, and his last book "Christ and &Baha'u'llah" was 
described by the Guardian as "his crowning achievement".  He 
participated in the Inter-Continental Conference, Stockholm, 
Sweden in July 1953 and passed away in March 1957 at the age 
of 81.  ("&Baha'i World", Vol. XIII, p. 841.)  
 
 
MRS. ISOBEL SLADE                                              page 61 
     It has not been possible to trace exactly when Mrs. Slade became 
a &Baha'i but she did tell the story of how she heard of the Faith 
from a visiting American believer and wished to go on 
pilgrimage to see the Master.  Before her plans were made she 
heard of His passing and she went in the early 1920s.  In the year 
1926 there is a record of her being a "substitute" member of the 
National Assembly elected to "represent" the London community.  
From the following year the delegates elected the National 
Assembly from the national electorate and Mrs. Slade served as 
a member for fourteen of the following nineteen years.  She was, 
in different years, Chairman, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer 
and Assistant Secretary.  She was a "last ditch" pioneer to 
Edinburgh to form the first Assembly there in 1948.  To the end 
of her long life she would delight her visitors with fascinating 
stories of her experiences in the early days of the Faith in the 
British Isles and she passed away in September 1972 at the age of 
 
+P471 
98.  The Universal House of Justice cabled:  "PASSING ISOBEL SLADE

     Also referred to later as "Louise Charlot".  Became a &Baha'i in 
Burlingame, California about 1910, and came to England late in 
1919.  She served on the London Spiritual Assembly for a period; 
pioneered to Oxford, and then to Bristol where she died in 
February 1963 at the age of 92.  
 
 
MISS FLORENCE E. PINCHON                                        page 72 
     Little is known about Miss Pinchon's early life but she was 
mentioned as being active in the Faith with Dr. Esslemont and 
Major Tudor Pole during the First World War (See "&Baha'i 
World" Vol. XIV, pp. 370-2).  "Floy" had a most lucid pen and 
in addition to contributing to &Baha'i and &non-Baha'i magazines, 
wrote "The Coming of the Glory", and "Life after Death".  She 
travelled as a &Baha'i teacher before the Second World War but 
suffered from indifferent health for many years before her death 
in Bournemouth in March 1966.

one of its most loyal and enthusiastic adherents.  Moved to 
London, England in 1920 and was for eleven years a member of 
the community, serving for a period as secretary of the National 
Assembly.  She died in London on 25 May 1931.  ("&Baha'i

Bournemouth &Baha'is called to hear of the passing of the Master.  
Always an active teacher of the Faith, she also served on the 
National Assembly for fifteen of its first eighteen years, mainly 
as its Chairman.  She passed away in Bournemouth in October 
1948.  
 
 
DAVID HOFMAN                                                   page 108 
     A member of the Universal House of Justice since its formation 
in 1963, he became a &Baha'i in the Maxwell home in Montreal 
in 1933, when he began corresponding with the Guardian.  
Returning to England in 1936, he was elected to the British 
National Spiritual Assembly and was the Secretary during some 
of its most crucial years.  He was the first Manager of its 
Publishing Trust and played a vital &role on the National 
Teaching and Africa Committees of the Six and Two Year 
Plans.  He served almost continuously on the National Assembly 
until his election to the Universal House of Justice.  David and 
Marion Hofman pioneered during the Six Year Plan in 
Northampton, Birmingham and Oxford and during the Ten 
Year Crusade in Cardiff and Watford.  Throughout his years of 
devoted service to the British community he was always in 
demand as a most accomplished speaker and convincing teacher.

1923 and served with absolute devotion throughout the 
remainder of her life.  She was for many years a member of the 
London Spiritual Assembly and served for six years on the 
National Assembly.  Throughout her &Baha'i life she corresponded 
frequently with the Guardian and responded to his overseas 
pioneer call when she became a Knight of &Baha'u'llah for the 
Channel Isles in September 1953.  She had already pioneered in 
the Six Year Plan to Birmingham, Nottingham, Hove, Oxford
 
+P473 
and Cardiff.  She died on 21 August 1969 and the Universal

Hand of the Cause of God                                       page 122 
     He was first elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
&Baha'is of the British Isles in 1933 and served continuously until 
1960, when he retired in order to devote his whole time to the 
work of the Hands of the Cause.  He served at the World Centre, 
and travelled to South America and throughout Canada in 1961.  
Mr. Balyuzi was Secretary of the first Summer School 
Committee in 1936, on the National Teaching Committee in 
1940 and Chairman of the National Assembly almost every year 
from 1942 until his retirement.  He was elevated to the rank of 
Hand of the Cause in 1957, and has made invaluable contributions 
to the literature of the Faith with his trilogy, "&Baha'u'llah", 
"&Abdu'l-Baha" and "The &Bab"; his "Edward Granville Browne 
and the &Baha'i Faith", his pamphlet on "&Baha'i Administration",

five years on the National Spiritual Assembly and for a short 
time on the National Teaching Committee of the Six Year Plan.  
At her passing the National Assembly cabled the Guardian, 
"PARVINE GLORIED IN SUCCESS PLAN PASSED TO &ABHA KINGDOM

     Associated with the Faith from the very beginnings of the 
Administration in the British Isles, the Joseph brothers gave long 
and outstanding service to the Cause.  Jacob (later "Jeff") was 
Chairman and Albert (then Ibrahim) a member of the first 
"Spiritual Council" of the &Baha'is of Manchester.  Jacob was a 
member of the first "All-England &Baha'i Council" in 1922 and of 
the first National Spiritual Assembly in 1923.  Both were 
mentioned in and received some Tablets from the Master and 
both were warmly regarded by the Guardian for their services 
to the Faith.  Jeff died in August 1969 in Manchester and Albert 
in August 1978.

within the Empire', and was approached afterwards by Claudia 
Stewart-Coles who exclaimed "You are a &Baha'i".  He subsequently 
accepted the Faith and has introduced it to many 
thousands of people in all walks of life in many lands, for more 
than half a century.  The Guardian became the first Life Member 
of the Men of the Trees in Palestine in 1929.  Later, for twelve 
consecutive years, he sent an official message to St. Barbe's World 
Forestry Charter Gatherings attended by Ambassadors from up 
to sixty-two countries each year.  St. Barbe took an active part on 
the Committee celebrating the Centenary of the Declaration of 
the &Bab in 1944.  After his first Sahara University Expedition 
carrying out an ecological survey of 9,000 miles in 1953, and in 
response to the Guardian's desire, St. Barbe attended the First 
African Conference in Kampala.  In 1975 St. Barbe was called 
upon to advise on tree planting of the site of the &Tihran House 
of Worship in consultation with Quinlan Terry, architect.  
Afterwards, in collaboration with architect Hossein &Amanat, he 
recorded his observations for the Universal House of Justice for 
the landscaping of their site on Mt. Carmel and for tree-scaping 
at &Bahji.  St. Barbe attended the Intercontinental Conference 
Nairobi, in October 1976 and still (1979) at almost 90 is

content to "lay down his bones in service to the Faith" in his 
beloved Africa.

pioneered to St. Ives in the same year.  Ursula became pioneer 
member of the first Dublin Assembly in 1948 and pioneered 
again, a year later, to Belfast.  In Belfast she became member of 
the first Local Assembly and worked with pioneer Dr. Mehdi 
&Samandari, whom she married.  They subsequently pioneered to 
Nairobi in 1953 and later to Somalia, where she was a Knight of 
&Baha'u'llah and became a member of the first Spiritual Assembly 
of Mogadiscio, on which she served from 1954 until 1971.  In 
addition to these experiences, she served on the National 
Assembly for North East Africa (1961-1970) and on the 
National Assembly of Cameroon since 1972, where she still 
serves (1979).

having served the Faith in America with great distinction as a 
teacher, writer and administrator.  With her husband she 
pioneered during the Six Year Plan in Northampton, Birmingham 
and Oxford, and during the Ten Year Crusade in Cardiff 
and Watford.  She served on the National Spiritual Assembly

     Was the first of Hand of the Cause George Townshend's family 
to embrace the Faith which her father had espoused many years 
previously.  She was an active &Baha'i youth and on 16 September 
1946 became the first pioneer in Ireland where she opened the 
`pivotal centre' of Dublin and was on its first Spiritual Assembly 
in 1948.  She pioneered to Malta and was the first Knight of 
&Baha'u'llah in that island in October 1953.

committees and in the teaching work for over thirty years.  He 
served on the National Spiritual Assembly from 1933 to 1940 
and pioneered to Brighton, Torquay and Exeter, sacrificing 
material prosperity over many years in the interests of teaching 
and pioneering.  He passed away in May 1966 at the age of 55

MRS DOROTHY FERRABY (&nee Cansdale)                         page 184 
     Became a &Baha'i and was active in the London Youth group in 
the early 1930's.  She was elected to the National Spiritual 
Assembly in 1941 and served continuously as either Secretary, 
Treasurer or Recording Secretary for the next twenty years.  She 
retired when her husband, Hand of the Cause John Ferraby, left 
to serve at the World Centre.  That the small and scattered 
 
+P477 
British &Baha'i community was held together in the 1940's is 
generally recognised to have been due to the dedicated work of 
Dorothy as Secretary of the National Assembly working 
indefatigably in war-torn London.  She became an Auxiliary 
Board Member in 1954 and was appointed to the European 
Board of Counsellors in 1968.  
 
  
PHILIP HAINSWORTH                                           page 187 
     Accepted the Faith in Bradford in 1938, and at the outbreak of 
War was the first British believer to register as a &Baha'i in the 
Armed Forces.  He had to appeal in Court when seeking 
exemption from being involved in the taking of life and, being 
released from combatant service, was drafted into the Royal 
Army Medical Corps.  Prior to his release from military service 
in 1946, he spent five weeks in Haifa and in the same year 
pioneered to Nottingham.  He was appointed Chairman of the 
National Youth Committee and Secretary of the National 
Teaching Committee and was elected to the National Assembly 
in 1947.  He subsequently pioneered to Oxford and Blackburn.  
In June 1951 he was one of the party of five pioneers who first 
went to Dar-es-Salaam and then on to Kampala, Uganda, where 
he became Secretary of the first local Spiritual Assembly in 1952 
and of the Regional National Assembly in Central and East 
Africa in 1956.  He returned to pioneer in the Leeds area in 1966, 
was elected to the National Assembly in 1967 and is still (1979)  
a member.

years old.  He was a keen Esperantist through which he learned 
of the Faith.  He served for many years on the London Spiritual 
Assembly and was on the National Assembly for a year in 1934.  
Responding to the pioneer call of the Six Year Plan he moved to 
Birmingham in 1946, to Blackburn in 1947, to Norwich in 
1948, and in 1961 at the age of 78 he pioneered to Canterbury.  
At the age of 82 he took a small flat in an old people's home 
where for the first time in his life he was able to entertain the 
friends and hold Feasts and even an assembly meeting.  He passed 
away after an accident on 19 March 1973.

others of that day, she did not formally register as a &Baha'i in the 
British Isles until 1942.  She pioneered to Northampton in 
August 1946 and helped to form its first Assembly, leaving for 
Liverpool in 1949 for the same purpose.  She subsequently 
pioneered to Bristol, Exeter and Stornoway; was the Secretary 
of the National Youth Committee when it launched its "&Baha'i

in 1888.  His grandfather was the first Jew to embrace the Cause 
and &Baha'u'llah revealed a Tablet in his honour.  &Lutfu'llah came 
to study physiotherapy in England in 1910 and he was in 
constant attendance on the Master during His visit in 1911.  He 
went to serve in the Holy Land and returned to England in 1920 
when he accompanied Shoghi Effendi.  He later served with 
distinction in Persia and returned, at the request of the Guardian, 
to Britain in October 1948, where he taught and travelled 
extensively until called to Haifa by the Guardian on 14 
November 1950.  He was appointed to the first International 
&Baha'i Council.  He was elected to the first Universal House of 
Justice in 1963 but because of failing health and advanced age 
regretfully his resignation was accepted in October 1967 though 
he consented to serve until the 1968 election.  He passed away in

at the age of eleven and later, after marriage, settled in 
Birmingham to pursue his trade.  He was confirmed in the Faith 
by the Master, Whom he met in 1911 and 1913, when he was, 
for many years, the only &Baha'i in Birmingham.  Johnny kept 
excellent records of visits and lectures by some of the early 
visitors to Birmingham, including Martha Root, Dr. Esslemont, 
Mountford Mills and Helen Bishop.  At the age of 71 he retired

     Born in Germany in 1882 with a German father and English 
mother she grew up with an insatiable love for travel.  In the 
United States she married an Englishman.  It is not certain when 
she accepted the Faith but she was on pilgrimage in 1930 and 
stayed for a month as companion to Effie Baker.  She was later a 
great help to the friends in Berlin and Leipzig and gave much 
support to Adam Benke who pioneered to Sofia.  After suffering 
many privations during the war in Germany she wrote to the 
Guardian in 1947 and he encouraged her suggestion to pioneer 
to England.  She arrived in early 1948 and settled in her first 
pioneer post in Nottingham.  Within nine months she was again 
on the move in response to pioneer calls.  Belfast, Edinburgh, St. 
 
+P481 
Ives, Brighton, and Bournemouth, making six moves in just 
over two years by a lady in her late sixties.  In 1953 she responded 
immediately and was enrolled as a Knight of &Baha'u'llah for 
Malta where, after numerous vicissitudes and a small but painful 
accident which affected her for many months, she was able, some 
twenty years later, to witness the formation of the first Spiritual 
Assembly in Malta.  She passed away, after twenty-seven years of 
dedicated pioneering which covered four territories, in May

Sugar accepted the Faith on 28 November 1921, but Alfred 
remained agnostic until about 1925.  He became well known for 
his depth of knowledge of the Faith and for his cogent argument.  
He was a teacher of the highest order and was largely responsible 
for the development of the Faith around Lancashire and over the 
Pennines into Bradford and Leeds.  Lucy was a member of the 
National Assembly in 1929 and Alfred was a member during 
eight of the following thirteen years.

in 1948 and within a fortnight offered to pioneer to Belfast.  
After serious illness and a period of recuperation in Cardiff, he 
served in Sheffield until 1953.  "Charlie" answered the Guardian's 
call to settle in unopened territories in the Ten Year Crusade and 
he arrived in Kirkwall, Orkney in September 1953, opening the 
way, "essentially ... alone" for the founding of Kirkwall Spiritual 
 
+P482 
Assembly.  After four years, broken by ill health and persecution, 
he was, for his own safety, sent back to Cardiff.  After a bad fall 
in 1967 from which he never fully recovered, he passed away 
quietly in his sleep on Christmas Day, 1967 in Cardiff.  ("&Baha'i

the small &Baha'i group in Cheltenham in 1940.  She moved to 
Manchester and later pioneered to Northampton in November 
1946 to become member of the first Spiritual Assembly there.  In 
1948 she again pioneered to help form the first Spiritual 
Assembly in the "Pivotal Centre" of Cardiff.  In 1950, during the 
"Year of Respite", Claire became the first pioneer actually to 
move from the British community to settle in Africa.  Hailed by 
the Guardian as the "Mother of Africa" she worked for some 
years in Tanganyika and then moved to Uganda where she 
established a multi-racial kindergarten; she is still at her pioneer 
post at the time of writing (1979).  
 
 
MRS. LIZZIE FOWLER HAINSWORTH                               page 211

younger son Philip that she had not become a &Baha'i during his 
absence in the Armed Forces because "Nobody had asked me to".  
She pioneered to Nottingham in 1946, to Oxford in 1949 and, 
at the age of 72, was the first believer in the British Isles to offer 
to pioneer in the Two Year Plan to Africa.  (Convention 1950.)  
She died in Bradford in September 1951 before she could join 
her son Philip in Uganda.  The Guardian wrote of her through 
his secretary, "She has truly shown an exemplary &Baha'i spirit in 
every way....  He wishes more of the &Baha'is would arise to such 
heights of devotion and sacrifice."

be members of the first Assembly there in 1949.  (It is of interest 
to note that in 1938 there were only three Spiritual Assemblies 
in the British Isles--in London, Manchester and Bournemouth, 
and a total of about eighty registered &Baha'is, yet in Bradford 
there were, during the course of about two years, so many new 
registrations that the first Assembly was elected there in 1939 
and by 1949 that Community had sent out ten pioneers from its 
first twenty-five believers.)  The Jenkersons pioneered to Cyprus 
in 1978 and are still there (1979).

the Royal Air Force.  Returning to Britain in 1946, he pioneered 
in Nottingham, Newcastle, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Leeds; was 
a member of the National Spiritual Assembly from 1947 until 
January 1955 when he pioneered to British Guiana, now Guyana.  
He was for a time part-time manager of the &Baha'i Publishing 
Trust and Editor of the &Baha'i Journal.  After his return from 
Guiana, he settled with his family in Northern Ireland in 1963 
and again served on the National Assembly until 1968 when he 
was appointed an Auxiliary Board Member.  His valuable 
contributions to &Baha'i literature include the compilations with 
which he was associated--"Pattern of &Baha'i Life", "Principles of 
&Baha'i Administration", "The Covenant of &Baha'u'llah", "Guidance 
for Today and Tomorrow", "A Faith for Everyman", and 
his unique approach to the Christians, "The Christianity of Jesus".  
He passed away on 4 October 1972 at the age of 58 when the

with his father, one of the early British believers, in Birmingham.  
(See "John L. Marshall".)  George pioneered for a short while to 
Belfast and then in 1950 to Glasgow where he lived for seven 
years, except for a short pioneering project to maintain the 
Assembly in Edinburgh.  He died at an early age on 30 March 
1958.

August 1945 and settled in Kenya where she was the only &Baha'i 
until the pioneers began to settle under the Two Year Plan.  Her 
husband died unexpectedly in July 1951 leaving her with three 
young children and she and her eldest child were killed in an 
aeroplane crash when she was returning to Kenya after a short 
holiday in England, in February 1952.

author Bernard Leach became a &Baha'i in the early 1930's.  He has 
through his works, his books, his press, radio and television 
interviews introduced the Faith with love, dedication and 
dignity to people in many spheres of society in Britain, Japan and 
America.  He was honoured by Her Majesty the Queen and 
made a Companion of Honour.  Even at ninety years of age, 
though blind, he was serving the Cause with distinction through 
his writings and interviews.  In March 1977, he opened, with 
much favourable publicity, an exhibition of his works at the 
 
+P485 
Victoria and Albert Museum London.  In 1919, when Bernard 
was about to leave Japan, the late Soetsu Yangi, the well-known 
Japanese art critic and philosopher and Bernard's friend for over 
fifty years, paid tribute:  "When he leaves us we shall have lost 
the one man who knows Japan on its spiritual side...  I consider 
his position in Japan, and also his mission in his own country to 
be pregnant with the deepest meaning.  He is trying to knit the 
East and West together by art, and it seems likely that he will be 
remembered as the first to accomplish as an artist, what for so 
long mankind has been dreaming of bringing about...."  
He passed away in May 1979 and to the National Assembly the 
Universal House of Justice cabled:  
"KINDLY EXTEND LOVING SYMPATHY RELATIVES FRIENDS PASSING

Universal House of Justice called for memorial meetings "ALL

     Always proud of the designation "Mother" given to her by 
&Abdu'l-Baha when she was one of the early pilgrims to the Holy 
 
+P486 
Land, it was Mother George who introduced the Faith to Dr. 
John Esslemont.  For very many years she conducted Sunday 
afternoon meetings in her Chelsea home in London and she 
passed away on 4 November 1950 at the age of 91.  ("&Baha'i

elevated to the rank of Hand of the Cause in February 1952.  The 
beloved Guardian also described him as the "spiritual conqueror

territories, served for some five years as the sole Hand of the 
African Continent, and finally, after many years of constant 
suffering, passed away at his pioneering post in Kampala, 
Uganda, on 4 September 1971.  The Universal House of Justice
