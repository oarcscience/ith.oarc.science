*The Splendour of God*, by Eric Hammond, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

O people of God! Be not occupied with yourselves. Be intent on the
betterment of the world and the training of nations.

Glory is not his who loves his native land; but glory is his who loves
his kind.

Courtesy is the lord of all the virtues.

The deniers and contradictors hold to four words:

First: Destroying men's lives.

Second: Burning the Books.

Third: Shunning other nations.

Fourth: Exterminating other communities.

Now, by the Grace and Authority of the Word of God, these four great
barriers have been demolished . . . and God hath changed brutal manners
into spiritual qualities.

Certain laws and principles are necessary and indispensable for Persia;
but it is suitable that these should be accomplished in accord with the
wish of the Shah, the eminent doctors, and the great State authorities.

The fear of God is the real guardian and the ideal protector. Flee from
that which is redolent of corruption (or sedition).
