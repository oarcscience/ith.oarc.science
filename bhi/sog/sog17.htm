<p>O people of God! Be not occupied with yourselves. Be intent on the betterment of the world and the training of nations.</p>  
<p>Glory is not his who loves his native land; but glory is his who loves his kind.</p>  
<p>Courtesy is the lord of all the virtues.</p>  
<p>The deniers and contradictors hold to four words:</p>  
<p>First: Destroying men's lives.</p>  
<p>Second: Burning the Books.</p>  
<p>Third: Shunning other nations.</p>  
<p>Fourth: Exterminating other communities.</p>  
<p>Now, by the Grace and Authority of the Word of God, these four great barriers have been demolished . . . and God hath changed brutal manners into spiritual qualities.</p>  
<p>Certain laws and principles are necessary and indispensable for Persia; but it is suitable that these should be accomplished in accord with the wish of the Shah, the eminent doctors, and the great State authorities.</p>

<p>The fear of God is the real guardian and the ideal protector. Flee from that which is redolent of corruption (or sedition).</p>
