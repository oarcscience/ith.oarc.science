*The Splendour of God*, by Eric Hammond, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

All the former and later Books of God are adorned with His commemoration
and speak His praise. Through Him the standard of knowledge is planted
in the world, and the Banner of Unity is hoisted among nations.

Knowledge is like unto wings for the being (of man) and is as a ladder
for ascending. . . . The possessors of sciences and arts have a great
right among the people of the world. Whereunto testifies the Mother of
Divine Utterance in the Day of Return. Joy unto those that hear.

Knowledge is the means of honour, prosperity, joy, gladness, happiness
and exultation.

He (The Bab) says in description of
'He-whom-God-shall-manifest';—'Verily, He is the One who shall utter in
all grades, "Verily, I am God. There is no God but Me, the Lord of all
things, and all besides Me is created by Me! O ye My

creatures! Ye are to worship Me!"' Likewise, in another place, speaking
of 'He-whom-God-shall-manifest,' he says, 'Verily, I (The Bab) am the
first one of those who worship Him.'

Now, man must reflect upon the 'Worshipper' (The Bab); and the
'Worshipped One' (Baha‘u‘llah); perchance the people of the earth may
attain to a drop of the Sea of Knowledge, and comprehend the Station of
this Manifestation. Verily, He hath appeared, and hath spoken in Truth.
Blessed is he who confesses and acknowledges, and woe unto every remote
denier."

*The Tablet of Tajalleyat*.
