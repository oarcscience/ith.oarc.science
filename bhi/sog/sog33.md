<span class="smallcaps">Of Oneness</span>

My Eternity is My creation. I have created it for thee. My Oneness is My
design. I have designed it for thee; therefore clothe thyself with it.
Thus thou mayest be a star of My Omnipresence for ever.

Alas! that a hundred thousand ideal languages are spoken by One Tongue,
and that a hundred thousand hidden meanings are unfolded in One Melody,
and there is no ear to hearken, nor any heart to perceive a single
letter!

Let the people of Certainty know that a new Garden has appeared in the
Open Court of Holiness, and that all the people of the Heights, and the
temples of the Exalted Heaven, are around it.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Endeavour to reach that station and discover the truths of the mystery
of Love from its blossoms, and unveil abundant knowledge of the Oneness
from its eternal fruits. Radiant are the eyes of him who has entered
therein with trust.

O Dead Men on the Bed of Negligence! Centuries have passed, and ye have
ended your precious limes; yet not a single breath of purity hath ever
come from ye to Our Holy Presence. Ye are drowned in the sea of
polytheism while talking of Oneness.

Oneness, in its true significance, means that God alone should be
realised as the One Power which animates and dominates all things, which
are but manifestations of its energy.
