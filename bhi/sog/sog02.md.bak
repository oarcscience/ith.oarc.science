### THE BENEDICTION OF ABBAS EFFENDI, THE PROPHET OF THE BAHAI RELIGION, TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK:

"*<span class="smallcaps">O God</span>, bring this Servant of thine near
to the Divine Threshold; give him life through the breath of the Holy
Spirit. Open his eyes, loosen his tongue, and cause him to walk in the
path of the Kingdom. Confirm him in Thy service. Grant him eloquent
speech and a fluent pen. Make him beloved in both worlds. If Thou wilt
grant him such bounties, he will be acceptable to the people of
knowledge and will become world-renowned. Thou art the Powerful, the
Mighty*."
