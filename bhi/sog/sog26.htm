<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Of Poverty and Wealth</span></p>  
<p>Boast not of thine own glory over the poor; for I walk before him, and I see thee in thy miserable condition and ever grieve for thee.</p>  
<p>If thou encounter poverty, grieve not; for, in the Time, the King of Riches will descend to thee. Fear not humility, for glory shall be thy portion.</p>  
<p>Be not engrossed with this world, for with fire</p>  
<p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> We test the gold, and with gold We try the servants.</p>  
<p>Thou desirest gold, and We desire the separation from it. Thou hast realised therein the riches of thyself, while I realise thy wealth to consist in thy freedom from it. By My Life! This is My Knowledge, while that is thine imagining; how can My Thought agree with Thine?</p>  
<p>Distribute My possessions among My poor, that in Heaven thou mayest receive from the boundless treasures of Glory and from the stores of Eternal Bliss.</p>  
<p>Let the rich learn the midnight sighing of the poor, lest negligence destroy them and they be deprived of their portion of the tree of wealth.</p>  
<p>Giving and generosity are qualities of Mine. Happy is he who adorns himself with My Virtues.</p>  
<p>Greed must be abandoned, that thou mayest find content; for the greedy has ever been deprived, while the contented has ever been loved and esteemed.</p>  
<p>Let not poverty trouble thee, nor rest assured in wealth. All poverty is succeeded by wealth, and all wealth is followed by poverty.</p>  
<p>To be poor in all save God is a great blessing; make it not small, for, in the end, it will make thee rich in God.</p>  
<p>Know ye that wealth is a strong barrier between the seeker and the Desired One, between</p>  
<p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></A></p>  
<p>the lover and the Beloved. Never shall the rich arrive at the abode of Nearness, nor enter into the city of contentment and resignation; save only a few.</p>  
<p>God is the state of that wealthy one, whose wealth preventeth him not from the Everlasting Kingdom, and depriveth him not of the Eternal Possessions.</p>  
<p>Verily, I declare by the Greatest Name, that the light of that wealthy one shall illumine the people of Heaven, as the sun shines upon the people of the earth.</p>  
<p>O ye who are wealthy on earth! The poor among ye are My Trust. Therefore guard My Trust, and be not wholly occupied with your own ease.</p>  
<p>Purge thyself from the dross of wealth, and, with perfect peace, step into the paradise of poverty; thus shalt thou drink the; wine of Immortality from the fountain of death.</p>  
<p>Rejoice not if fortune smile upon thee, and if humility overtake thee;&#8212;mourn not because of it; for, in their time, they both shall cease and be no more.</p>  
<p>Wert thou to see the Immortal Kingdom, verily thou wouldest abandon the mortal possessions of earth; yet there is a wisdom in the former being concealed and in the latter being manifest; and this is known only to hearts that are pure.</p>
