<span class="smallcaps">Of Disputation and Fault-Finding</span>

Verily I say the most negligent of the servants is he who disputes and
prefers himself to his brother.

Purge thy mind from malice and, free from envy, enter the presence of
Unity.

The tongue is especially for the mention of Me; stain it not with
slander. If the fire of self overcome ye, be mindful to remember your
own faults, and speak not evil of My creatures; because each one of ye
is more conscious and better informed of his own self than of My
creatures.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Hear no evil, and see no evil; degrade not thyself, nor lament. That is:
speak no evil, that thou mayest not hear it. Think not the faults of
others to be great, that thine own may not seem great. Approve not the
abasement of any soul, that thine own abasement may not be exposed.
Then, with stainless mind, holy heart, sanctified breast and pure
thoughts, thou mayest be free during all the days of thy life, which are
counted less than an instant, and with freedom may return from this
mortal body to the paradise of Inner Significances and abide in the
Immortal Kingdom.

Why hast thou overlooked thine own faults, and art observing defects in
My servants? Whosoever does this is condemned by Me.

Breathe not the sins of any one as long as thou art a sinner. If thou
doest contrary to this command, thou art not of Me. To this I bear
witness.
