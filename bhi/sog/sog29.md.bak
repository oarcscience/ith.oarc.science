<span class="smallcaps">Of Pride</span>

Divest yourselves from the garment of pride; and lay aside the robe of
haughtiness.

I declare by My Beauty that I have created

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

ye all from the dust, and to dust shall I turn ye again.

O Sons of Pride! For a few days’ mortal reign ye have rejected My
Immortal Dominion, and are arraying yourselves in robes of scarlet and
gold and boasting of this. I declare by My Beauty that I will bring ye
all together under the uncoloured tent of dust, and will efface the
colours of all; save those who choose My Colour, which is pure from all
colour.

Verily, man is uplifted to the heaven of glory and power through
Meekness; again, through Pride is he degraded to the lowest station.
