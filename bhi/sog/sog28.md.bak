<span class="smallcaps">Of Obedience</span>

The principle of religion is to acknowledge what is revealed by God, and
to obey the laws established in His Book.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

The source of all good is trust in God, obedience to His Command, and
satisfaction in His Will,

O Son of Existence! Keep My Commands for love of Me, and deny thyself
thine own desires if thou wishest My Pleasure.

Neglect not My Laws if thou lowest My Beauty; and forget not My Counsels
if thou art hopeful to attain My Will.

O Son of Man! If thou run through all immensity and speed through the
space of Heaven, thou shalt find no rest save in obedience to Our
Command and in devotion before Our Face.

Magnify My Command that I may reveal to thee the secrets of greatness
and illumine thee with the Lights of Eternity.

Be submissive to Me that I may descend to thee; and serve My Cause that
thou mayest be victorious in Me.

Ponder over thy condition and be thoughtful in action. Dost thou prefer
to die upon thy bed, or to be martyred in My Path upon the dust; to be a
Manifestation of My Command and an expression of My Light in the Highest
Paradise I Discern justly, O My Servant.
