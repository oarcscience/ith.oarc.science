### TEXTS FROM THE TABLETS OF BAHA‘U‘LLAH

"<span class="smallcaps">Association</span> (intercourse) is always
conducive to union and harmony; and union and harmony are the cause of
the order of the world and the life of nations.

Forbearance and Benevolence . . . are as two lights for the darkness of
the world; and as two teachers to lead nations to knowledge.

Good character is, verily, the best mantle for men on the part of God.

Gaze towards Justice and Equity under all circumstances.

Trustworthiness . . . is the door of tranquillity to all the world; the
best garment for your temples and the most splendid crown for your
heads.

Make not light of any matter, but speak in Truthfulness and Sincerity.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

Refuse not to discharge the due reward of any one; respect possessors of
talent; stain not tongues with slander.

Knowledge is one of the greatest benefits of God. To acquire knowledge
is incumbent on all.

*Tablet of Tarazet*.
