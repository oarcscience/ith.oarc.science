<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Of Knowledge</span></p>  
<p>The root of all knowledge is the knowledge of God; Glory be to Him! Knowledge is impossible save through His Manifestation.</p>  
<p>O My Brother! Hear My Beautiful Words from My Sweet Tongue, and drink the Water of Life from the Fountain of My Lips. Sow the seeds of My Innate Wisdom in the pure ground of the heart, and water it with conviction; then the flower of My Knowledge and Wisdom shall</p>  
<p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A></p>  
<p>spring up verdantly in the holy sanctuary of the heart.</p>  
<p>Sow the seeds of knowledge and wisdom in the fertile grounds of the mind, and conceal them there until the hyacinth of Divine Wisdom springs up in the heart and not in the clay.</p>  
<p>Drink the wine of Significancies from the Lips of the Merciful, and behold the radiance of the light of the Sun of Explanation, without veil or cover, from the Dawning-Place of the Word of God:</p>  
<p>Spread the seeds of My Immediate Wisdom in the fertile soil of the heart and water it with the water of certainty; thus shall the hyacinths of My Knowledge and Wisdom spring up and flourish.</p>  
<p>The progress of man depends upon faithfulness, wisdom, chastity, intelligence, and action. He is ever degraded by ignorance, lack of faith, untruth and selfishness.</p>  
<p>Verily, man is not called man until he be imbued with the attributes of The Merciful. He is not man because of wealth and adornment, learning and refinement. Blessed is he who is free; seeking the shore of the Sea of Purity and loving the melody of the dove of Virtue.</p>  
<p>In this day all must serve God with purity and virtue. The effect of the word spoken by the teacher depends upon his purity of purpose. Some are content with words; but the truth of</p>  
<p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A></p>  
<p>words is tested by deeds, and dependent upon life.</p>  
<p>Deeds reveal the station of the man. The words must be according to what has proceeded from the Mouth of the Will of God.</p>  
<p>O my God! O my God! Unite the hearts of Thy servants and reveal to them Thy Great Purpose. May they follow Thy Commandments and abide in Thy Law. Help them, O God, in their endeavour, and grant them strength to serve Thee. O God, leave them not to themselves, but guide their steps by the light of knowledge and cheer their hearts by Thy Love.</p>
