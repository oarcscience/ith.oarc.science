The company of the wicked increaseth sorrow; and the fellowship of the
righteous removeth the rust of the mind.

He who desires to associate with God, let him associate with His
Beloved; and he who desires to hear the Word of God, let him hear the
words of His chosen ones.

Walk not with the wicked and confederate not with him; for the
companionship of the wicked changeth the Light of Life into fire of
remorse.

If thou seekest the attainment of the Holy Spirit, be a companion of the
noble; for the righteous have quaffed from the Chalice of Immortality
passed by the hand of the Cup-Bearer

of Eternity, and they quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead as
doth the true morn.

O Friend! In the garden of the heart plant only flowers of Love. Esteem
the friendship of the just; but withdraw both mind and hand from the
company of the wicked.
