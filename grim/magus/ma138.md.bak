CHAP. XVI.

OF THE SCALE OF UNITY.

NOW let us treat particularly of numbers themselves; and, because number
is nothing else but a repetition of unity, let us first consider unity
itself; for unity doth most simply go through every number, and is the
common measure, fountain, and original of all numbers; contains every
number joined together in itself entirely; the beginner of every
multitude, always the same, and unchangeable; whence, also, being
multiplied into itself, produceth nothing but itself: it is indivisible,
void of all parts. Nothing is before one, nothing is after one, and
beyond it is nothing; and all things which are, desire that one, because
all things proceed from one; and that all things may be the same, it is
necessary that they partake of that one: and as all things proceed of
one into many things, so all thin-s endeavour to return to that one,
from which they proceeded; it is necessary that they should put off
multitude. One, therefore, is referred to the most high God, who, seeing
he is one and innumerable, yet creates innumerable things of himself,
and contains them within himself. There is, therefore, one God--one
world of the one God--one sun of the one world--also one phœnix in the
world--one king amongst bees--one leader amongst flocks of cattle--one
ruler amongst herds of beasts--and cranes follow one, and many other
animals honour unity. Amongst the members of the body there is one
principal, by which all the rest are guided; whether it be the head, or
(as some will) the heart. There is one element, overcoming and
penetrating all things, *viz.* fire. There is one thing created of God,
the subject of *all wondering* which is in earth or in heaven--it is
actually animal, vegetable, and mineral; every where found, known by
few, called by none by its proper name, but covered with figures and
riddles, without which neither Alchymy, nor Natural Magic can attain to
their complete end or perfection. From one man, Adam, all men
proceeded--from that One, all became mortal--from that one, *Jesus
Christ*, they are regenerated; and, as saith St. Paul., one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, one

\[paragraph continues\] Mediator betwixt God and man, one most high
Creator, who is over all, by all, and in us all, For there is one
Father, God, from whence all, and we in him; one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom all, and we by him; one God Holy Ghost, into whom all, and we into
him.
