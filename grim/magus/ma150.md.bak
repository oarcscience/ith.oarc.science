CHAP. XXVIII.

THE MAGIC TABLES OF THE PLANETS--THEIR FORM AND VIRTUE--WHAT DIVINE
NAMES, INTELLIGENCES, AND SPIRITS, ARE SET OVER THEM.

THERE are certain magic tables of numbers distributed to the seven
planets, which they call the sacred tables of the planets; because,
being rightly formed, they are endued with many great virtues of the
heavens, insomuch that they represent the divine order of the celestial
numbers, impressed upon them by the *ideas* of the divine mind, by means
of the soul of the world, and the sweet harmony of those celestial rays;
signifying, according to proportion, supercelestial. intelligences,
which can no other way be expressed than by the marks of numbers,
letters, and characters; for *material* numbers and figures can do
nothing in the mysteries of hidden things, but representatively by
*formal* numbers and figures, as they are governed and informed by
intelligences and divine enumerations, which unite the extremes of the
matter and spirit to the will of the elevated soul, receiving (through
great affection, by the celestial power of the operator) a virtue and
power from God, applied through the soul of the universe; and the
observation of celestial constellations

to a *matter* fit for a form, the mediums being disposed by the skill
and industry of the magician.

But now we will hasten to explain each particular table. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) The first table is assigned to the planet
Saturn, and consists of a square of three, containing the particular
numbers of nine, and in every line three every way, and through each
diameter making fifteen--the whole sum of numbers forty-five; over this
are set such divine names as fill up the numbers with an intelligence,
to what is good, and a spirit to bad; and out of the same numbers are
drawn the seal and character of Saturn, and of the spirits thereof, such
as is beneath ascribed to the table.

Now this table being with a fortunate Saturn, engraven on a plate of
lead, helps child-birth; and to make any man safe or powerful; and to
cause success of petitions with princes and powers; but if it be done,
Saturn being unfortunate, it hinders buildings, planting, and the like,
and casts a man from honours and dignities, causes discord, quarrelling,
and disperses an army.

The second is the table of Jupiter, which consists of a square drawn
into itself; it contains sixteen particular numbers, and in every line
and diameter four, making thirty-four; the sum of all is one hundred and
thirty-six. There are over it divine names, with an intelligence to that
which is good, and a spirit to bad; and out of it is drawn the character
of Jupiter and the spirits thereof; if this is engraven on a plate of
silver, with Jupiter being powerful and ruling in the heavens, it
conduces to gain riches and favour, love, peace, and concord, and to
appease enemies, and to confirm honours, dignities, and counsels; and
dissolves enchantments if engraven on a coral.

The third table belongs to Mars, which is made of a square of five,
containing twenty-five numbers, and of these, in every side and
diameter, five, which makes sixty-five, and the sum of all is three
hundred and twenty-five; and there are over it divine names with an
intelligence to good, and a spirit to evil, and out of it is drawn the
characters of Mars and of his spirits. These, with *Mars* fortunate,
being engraven on an iron plate, or sword, makes

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

a man potent in war and judgment, and petitions, and terrible to his
enemies; and victorious over them; and if engraven upon the stone
correola, it stops blood, and the menstrues; but if it be engraven, with
*Mars* being unfortunate, on a plate of red brass, it prevents and
hinders buildings--it casts down the powerful from dignities, honours,
and riches--causes discord and hatred amongst men and beasts--drives
away bees, pigeons, and fish--and hinders mills from working, *i. e.*
binds them;--it likewise renders hunters and fighters
unfortunate--causes barrenness in men and women--and strikes a terror
into our enemies, and compels them to submit.

The fourth table is of the *Sun*, and is made of a square of six, and
contains thirty-six particular numbers, whereof six in every side and
diameter produce one hundred and eleven, and the sum of all is six
hundred and sixty-six; there are over it divine names, with an
intelligence to what is good, and a spirit to what is evil, and out of
it is drawn the character of the Sun and of his spirits. This being
engraven on a plate of pure gold, Sol being fortunate, renders him that
wears it renowned, amiable, acceptable, potent in all his works, and
equals him to a king, elevating his fortunes, and enabling him to do
whatever he will. But with an unfortunate Sun, it makes one a tyrant,
proud, ambitious, insatiable, and finally to come to an ill ending.

The fifth table is of Venus; consisting of a square of seven, drawn into
itself, *viz.* of forty-nine numbers, whereof seven on each side and
diameter make one hundred and seventy-five, and the sum of all is one
thousand two hundred and twenty-five; there are, likewise, over it
divine names, with an intelligence to good, and a spirit to evil; and
there is drawn out of it the character of Venus, and her spirits. This
being engraven on a plate of silver, Venus being fortunate, promotes
concord, ends strife, procures the love of women, helps conception, is
good against barrenness, gives ability for generation, dissolves
enchantments, causes peace between man and woman, and makes all kinds of
animals fruitful, and likewise cattle; and being put into a dove or
pigeon house, causes an increase; it likewise drives away, melancholy
distempers, and causes joyfulness; and this being carried about
travellers,

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

makes them fortunate. But if it be formed upon brass, Venus being
unfortunate, it acts contrary to all that has been said.

The sixth table is of Mercury, resulting from a square of eight drawn
into itself, containing sixty-four numbers, whereof eight on every side
and by both diameters make two hundred and sixty, and the sum of all is
two thousand and eighty; and over it are set divine names, with an
intelligence to good, with a spirit to bad, and from it is drawn a
character of Mercury, and the spirits thereof; and if, with Mercury
being fortunate, you engrave it upon silver, tin, or yellow brass, or
write it upon virgin parchment, it renders the bearer thereof grateful,
acceptable, and fortunate to do what he pleases: it brings gain, and
prevents poverty; helps the memory, understanding, and divination, and
to the understanding of occult things by dreams; but with an unfortunate
Mercury does every thing contrary to this.

The seventh and last table is of the Moon: it consists of a square of
nine, having eighty-one numbers in every side, and diameter nine,
producing three hundred and sixty-nine; and the sum of all is three
thousand three hundred and twenty-one. There are over it divine names,
with an intelligence to what is good, and a spirit to evil; and from it
are drawn the characters of the Moon and the spirits thereof. This, the
Moon being fortunate, engraven on silver, makes the bearer amiable,
pleasant, cheerful, and honoured, removing all malice and ill-will; it
causes security in a journey, increase of riches, and health of body,
drives away enemies, and other evil things from what place soever thou
shalt wish them to be expelled. But if the Moon be unfortunate, and it
be engraven on a plate of lead, wherever it shall be buried it makes
that place unfortunate, and the inhabitants thereabouts, as also ships,
rivers, fountains, and mills; and it makes every man unfortunate against
whom it shall be directly done, making him fly his place of abode (and
even his country) where it shall be buried; and it hinders physicians
and orators, and all men whatsoever in their office, against whom it
shall be made.

Now how the seals and characters of the planets are drawn from these
tables, the wise searcher, and he who shall understand the verifying of
these tables, shall easily find out.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

Here follow the divine names corresponding with the numbers of the
planets, with the names of the intelligences and dæmons, or spirits,
subject to those names.

It is to be understood that the intelligences are the presiding good
angels that are set over the planets; but that the spirits or dæmons,
with their names seals, or characters, are never inscribed upon any
Talisman, except to execute any evil effect, and that they are subject
to the intelligences, or good spirits; and again, when the spirits and
their characters are used, it will be more conducive to the effect to
add some divine name appropriate to that effect which we desire.
