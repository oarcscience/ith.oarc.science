JOHN RUDOLPH GLAUBER.

R. GLAUBER, a celebrated chymist of *Amsterdam*, accounted the
*Paracelsus* of his time: he had travelled much and by that means
attained to a great many secrets. He wrote above thirty tracts, in some
of which he acted the physician; in others, the adept; and in others,
the metallist. He principally excelled in the last capacity, and
alchymy.

He was a person of easy and genteel address, and, beyond dispute, well
versed in chymistry: being author of the salt, still used in the shops,
called *Sal Glauberi*; as also of all the salts, by oil of vitriol., &c.
He is noted for extolling his arcanæ and preparations, and is reported
to have traded unfairly with his secrets: the best of them he would
sell, at excessive rates, to chymists and others, and would afterwards
re-sell them, or make them public, to increase his fame; whence he was
continually at variance with them.

The principal of his writings are *De Furnis*, and *De Metallis*, which,
though wrote in *Dutch*, have been translated into *Latin* and
*English*. It was *Glauber* who shewed, before the States of *Holland*,
that there is gold contained in sand; and made an experiment thereof to
their entire satisfaction: but so

much lead, fire, and labour, being employed in procuring it, that the
art would not pay charges <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md). However
he plainly demonstrated, that there is no earth, sand, sulphur, or salt,
or other matter, but what contains gold in a greater or less quantity.
In short, he possessed a great many secrets, which are at this time in
the hands of some of our modern chymists.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[195:1](ma269.htm#fr_35.md) It has been asserted by
several eminent chymists, that it might be performed to advantage, as
the process is very simple, and takes up but little time: all that is
requisite is silver, sand, and litharge.
