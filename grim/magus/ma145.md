CHAP. XXIII.

OF THE NUMBER EIGHT, AND THE SCALE.

THE Pythagorians call Eight the number of justice, and fulness: first,
because it is first of all divided into numbers equally even, *viz.*
into four; and that division is, by the same reason, made into twice
two, *viz.* twice two twice; and by reason of this equality of division
it took to itself the name of justice. But the other received the name
of fulness, by reason of the contexture of the corporeal solidity, since
the first makes a solid body. Hence that custom of Orpheus swearing by
the eight deities, if at any time he would beseech Divine justice, whose
names are these:--Fire, Water, Earth, the Heaven, Moon, Sun, Phanes, and
the Night. There are only eight visible spheres of the heavens. Also, by
it the property of corporeal nature is signified, which Orpheus
comprehends in eight of his sea songs: this is also called the.
covenant, or circumcision, which was commanded to be done by the Jews
the eighth day.

There were also, in the old law, eight ornaments of the priest, *viz.* a
breastplate, a coat, a girdle, a mitre, a robe, an ephod, a girdle of
the ephod, and a golden plate. Hither belongs the number to eternity,
and the end of the world, because it follows the number seven, which is
the mystery of time. Hence, also, the number of blessedness, as you may
see in Matthew. It is also called the number of safety, and
conservation; for there were so many souls of the sons of Jesse, from
which David was the eighth.
