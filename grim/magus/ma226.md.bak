CHAP. XIV.

OF THE CALCULATING ART OF SUCH NAMES BY THE TRADITION OF CABALISTS.

THERE is yet another art of these kind of names, which they call
calculatory; and it is made by the following tables, by entering with
some sacred, divine, or angelical name, in the column of letters
descending, by taking those letters which thou shalt find in the common
angles under their stars and signs, which being reduced into order, the
name of a good spirit is made of the nature of that star or sign under
which thou didst enter; but if thou shalt enter in the column ascending,
by taking the common angles above the stars and signs marked in the
lowest line, the name of an evil spirit is made. And these are the names
of spirits of any order of heaven ministering, as of good, so of bad,
which you may after this manner multiply into nine names of so many
orders; inasmuch as you may, by entering with one name, draw forth
another of a spirit

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

of a superior order out of the same, as well of a good as a bad one; yet
the beginning of this calculation depends upon the names of God; for
every word hath a virtue in *magic*, inasmuch as it depends on the word
of God, and is thence framed. Therefore we must know that every
angelical name must proceed from some primary name of God. Therefore
angels are said to bear the name of God, according to that which is
written, "because my name is in him;" therefore that the names of good
angels may be discerned from the names of bad, there is wont oftentimes
to be added some name of Divine Omnipotence, as *El*, or *On*, or *Jah*,
or *Jod*, and to be pronounced together with it: and because *Jah* is a
name of beneficence, and *Jod* the name of a deity, therefore these two
names are put only to the names of angels; but the name *El*, because it
imports power and virtue, is therefore added, not only to good but bad
spirits; for neither can evil spirits either subsist or do any thing
without the virtue of *El*, God. But we must know that common angles of
the same star and sign are to be taken, unless entrance be made with a
mixt name, as are the names of genii, and those of which it hath been
spoken in the preceding chapter, which are made of the dispositions of
the heavens, according to the harmony of divers stars. For as often as
the table is to be entered with these, the common angle is to be taken
under the star or sign of him that enters.

There are moreover some that do so extend those tables that they think
also if there be an entrance made with the name of a star, or office, or
any desired effect, a demon, whether good or bad, serving to that office
or effect may be drawn out; upon the same account they that enter with
the proper name of any person can extract the names of the genii under
that star which shall appear to be over such a person as they shall, by
his physiognomy, or by the passions and inclinations of his mind, and by
his profession and fortune, know him to be either *martial*, or
*saturnine*, or *solary*, or of the nature of any other star.

And although such kind of primary names have none or little power by
their signification, yet such kind of extracted names, and such as are
derived from them, are of very great efficacy; as the rays of the sun
collected in a hollow glass do most intensely burn, the sun itself being
scarce warm.

Now there is an order of letters in those tables under the stars and
signs, almost like that which is with the astrologers, of tens, elevens,
twelves. Of this calculatory art *Alphonsus Cyprius* once wrote, and
also fitted it to Latin characters; but because the letters of every
tongue, as we shewed in the first book, have, in their number, order and
figure, a celestial and divine original, I shall easily grant this
calculation concerning the names of spirits to be made not only by
Hebrew letters, but also *Chaldean, Arabick, Egyptian, Greek* and
*Latin*, and many others, the tables being rightly made after the
imitation of the presidents.

But here it is objected by many, that it falls out that in these tables
men of a differing nature and fortune do oftentimes, by reason of the
sameness of name, obtain the same genius of the same name. We must know
therefore that it must not be thought absurd, that the same daemon may
be separated from any one soul, and the same be set over more. Besides,
as many men have the same name, so also spirits of divers offices or
natures may be noted or marked by one name, and by one and the same seal
or character, yet in a different respect; for as the serpent does
sometimes typify Christ, and sometimes the devil, so the same names and
the same seals may be applied sometimes to the order of a good demon,
sometimes of a bad one. Lastly, the very ardent intention of the
invocator, by which our intellect is joined to the separated
intelligences, is the cause that we have sometimes one spirit, sometimes
another, (although called upon under the same name,) made obsequious to
us.

See the following Plates for the tables of the calculation of the names
of spirits, good and bad, under the presidency of the seven planets, and
under the order of the twelve militant signs.
