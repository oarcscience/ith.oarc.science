CHAP. XVII.

OF THE NUMBER TWO, AND SCALE.

THE first number is two, because it is the first multitude; it can be
measured by no number besides unity alone, the common measure of all
numbers; it is not compounded of numbers, but of one unity only; neither
is it called a number uncompounded, but more properly not compounded.
The number three, is called the first number uncompounded. But the
number two is the first branch of unity, and the first procreation; and
it is called the number of science, and memory, and of light, and the
number of man, who is called

another, and the lesser world: it is also called the number of charity,
and of mutual love; of marriage, and society: as it is said by the
Lord--"Two shall be one flesh."--And Solomon saith, "It is better that
two be together than one, for they have a benefit by their mutual
society: if one shall fall, he shall be supported by the other. Woe to
him that is alone; because, when he falls, he hath not another to help
him. And if two sleep together, they shall warm one another; how shall
one be hot alone?--And if any prevail against him, two resist him." And
it is called the number of wedlock, and sex; for there are two
sexes--masculine and feminine. And two doves bring forth two eggs; out
of the first of which is hatched the male, out of the second the female,
It is also called the middle, that is capable, that is good and bad,
partaking; and the beginning of division, of multitude, and distinction;
and signifies matter. This is also, sometimes, the number of discord, of
confusion, of misfortune, and uncleanness; whence St. Hierom, against
Jovianus, saith--"that therefore it was not spoken in the second day of
the creation of the world."--"And God said, that it was good;"--because
the number of two is evil. Hence also it was, that God commanded that
all unclean animals should go into the ark by couples; because, as I
said, the number of two is a number of uncleanness. Pythagorus, as
Eusebius reports, said, that unity was God, and a good intellect; but
that duality was a devil, and an evil intellect, in which is a material
multitude: wherefore the Pythagorians say, that two is not a number, but
a certain confusion of unities. And Plutarch writes, that the
Pythagorians called unity, Apollo; and two, strife and boldness; and
three, justice, which is the highest perfection, and is not without many
mysteries. Hence there were two tables of the law in Sinai--two
cherubims looking to the propitiatory in Moses--two olives dropping oil,
in Zachariah--two natures in Christ, divine and human: hence Moses saw
two appearances of God, *viz.* his face, and back parts;--also two
Testaments--two commands of love--two first dignities--two first
people--two kinds of spirits, good and bad--two intellectual creatures,
an angel and soul--two great lights--two solstitia--two
equinoctials--two poles--two elements, producing a living soul, *viz.*
earth and water.
