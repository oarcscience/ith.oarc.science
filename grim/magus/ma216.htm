<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER">OF DIVINE EMANATIONS, AND TEN SEPHIROTHS, AND TEN MOST SACRED NAMES OF GOD WHICH RULE THEM, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THEM</FONT>.</P>
<P>GOD himself, although he is trinity in persons, yet he is but one only simple essence; yet we doubt not but that there are in him many divine powers, which emanate or flow from him.</P>

<P>The Cabalists most learned in divine things have received the ten principal names of God, as certain divine powers, Or, as it were, members of God; which, by ten numerations, which we call Sephiroth, as it were vestiments, instruments, or exemplars of the Archetype, have an influence upon all created things, from the highest to the lowest; yet by a certain order: for first and immediately they have influence upon the nine orders of angels and quire of blessed souls, and by them into the celestial spheres, planets and men; by the which Sephiroth every thing receiveth power and virtue.</P>
<P>The first of these is the name <I>Eheia</I>, the name of the divine essence; his numeration is called Cether, which is interpreted a crown or diadem, and signifies the most simple essence of the divinity; and it is called that which the eye seeth not; and is attributed to God the Father, and hath its influence by the order of seraphims, or Hajoth Hakados, that is, creatures of holiness; and then by the <I>primum mobile</I>, it bestows the gift of being upon all things, and filleth the whole universe, both through the circumference and center; whose particular intelligence is called Merattron, that is the prince of faces, whose duty it is to bring others to the face of the Prince; and by him the Lord spake to Moses.</P>
<P>The second name is Jod, or Tetragrammaton joined with Jod; his numeration is Hochma, that is, wisdom, and signifies the divinity full of ideas, and the First Begotten; and is attributed to the Son, and has its influence by the order of cherubins, or that the Hebrews call Orphanim, <I>i. e.</I> forms or wheels; and from thence into the starry heavens, where he frames so many figures as he hath ideas in himself, and distinguishes the very chaos of the creatures, by a particular intelligence called Raziel, who was the ruler of <I>Adam</I>.</P>
<P>The third name is called Tetragrammaton Elohim; his numeration is named <I>Prina</I>, <I>viz.</I> providence and understanding; and signifies remissness, quietness, the jubilee, penitential conversion, a great trumpet, redemption of the world, and the life of the world to come: it is attributed to the Holy Spirit, and hath his influence by the order of thrones, or which the Hebrews call <I>Abalim</I>, that is great angels, mighty and strong; and from thence, by the sphere of <I>Saturn</I>, administers form to the unsettled matter, whose particular</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>intelligence is Zaphkiel, the ruler of Noah, and another intelligence named Jophiel, the ruler of Sem; and these are the three supreme and highest numerations, as it were, seats of the divine persons, by whose command all things are made; but are executed by the other seven, which are therefore called numerations framing.</P>
<P>The fourth name is El, whose numeration is <I>Hesed</I>, which signifies clemency or goodness; likewise grace, mercy, piety, magnificence, the scepter, and right-hand; and hath its influx by the order of dominations, which the Hebrews called <I>Hasmalim</I>; and so through the sphere of Jupiter fashions the images of bodies, bestowing clemency and pacifying justice on all: his particular intelligence is <I>Zadkiel</I>, the ruler of Abraham.</P>

<P>The eighth is called also Elohim Sabaoth, which is likewise the God of Hosts, not of war and justice, but of piety and agreement, for this name signifies both, and precedeth his army; the numeration of this is called <I>Hod</I>, which is, praise, confession, honour and fame; the left column is attributed to it; it hath his influence through the order of the archangels, which the Hebrews call Ben Elohim, that is, the sons of God, into the sphere of Mercury, and gives elegancy, and consonancy of speech, and produces living creatures; his intelligence is Michael, who was the ruler of Solomon.</P>

<P>The tenth name is <I>Adonai Melech</I>, that is, lord and king; his numeration is <I>Malchuth</I>, that is, kingdom and empire, and signifies a church, the temple of God, and a gate; and hath his influence through the order of Animastic, <I>viz</I>. of <I>blessed souls</I>, which, by the Hebrews, is called Issim, that is, nobles, lords, and princes; they are inferior to the <I>hierarchies</I>, and have their influences on the sons of men, and give knowledge and the wonderful under standing of things, also industry and prophecy; and the soul of the Messiah is president amongst them, or the intelligence Merattron, which is called the first creature, or the soul of the world, who was the ruler of Moses.</P>
