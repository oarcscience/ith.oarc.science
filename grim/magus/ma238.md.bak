The Consecration of OIL.

AND likewise in the consecration of oil and perfumes we are to mention
such things as are consonant to this purpose, as of the holy anointing
oil mentioned in Exodus, and divine names significant thereunto; such as
is the name Christ, which signifies anointed; and whatever mysteries
there are relative to oil in the Scriptures, as the two olive-trees
distilling holy oil into the lamps that burn before the face of God,
mentioned in Revelations.
