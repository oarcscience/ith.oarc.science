CHAP. IX.

OF THE MIXTURES OF NATURAL THINGS ONE WITH ANOTHER, AND THE PRODUCING OF
MONSTROUS ANIMALS, BY THE APPLICATION OF NATURAL MAGIC.

MAGICIANS, students, and observers of the operations of Nature, know
how, by the application of active forms to a matter fitly disposed, and
made, as it were, a proper recipient, to effect many wonderful and
uncommon things that seem strange, and above Nature, by gathering this
and that thing beneficial and conducive to that effect which we desire;
however, it is evident that all the powers and virtues of the inferior
bodies are not found comprehended in any one single thing, but are
dispersed amongst many of the compounds here amongst us; wherefore it is
necessary, if there be a hundred virtues of the sun dispersed through so
many animals, plants, metals, or stones, we should gather all these
together, and bring them all into one form, in which we shall see all
the said virtues, being united, contained. Now there is a double virtue
in commixing: one, *viz.* which was once planted in its parts, and is
*celestial*; the other is obtained by a certain artificial mixture of
things, mixed among themselves, according to a due proportion, such as
agree with the heavens under a certain constellation; and this virtue
descends by a certain similitude or likeness that is in things amongst
themselves, by which they are drawn or attracted towards their
superiors, and as much as the following do by degrees correspond with
them that go before, where the patient is fitly applied to its agent. So
from a certain composition of *herbs, vapours*, and such like, made
according to the rules of Natural and Celestial Magic, there results a
certain common form; of which we shall deliver the true and infallible
rules and experiments in our Second Book, where we have written
expressly on the same.

We ought, likewise, to understand that by how much more noble and
excellent the form of any thing is, by so much the more it is prone, and
apt to receive, and powerful to act. Then the virtue of things do indeed
become wonderful; *viz.* when they are applied to matters, mixed and
prepared in fit

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

seasons to give them life, by procuring life for them from the stars,
our own spirit powerfully co-operating therewith; for there is so great
a power in prepared matters, which we see do then receive life, when a
perfect mixture of qualities do break the former contrariety; for so
much the more perfect life things receive, by as much the temper and
composition is free from contrariety. Now the heavens, as a prevailing
cause, do, from the beginning of every thing, (to be generated by the
concoction and perfect digestion of the matter) together with life,
bestow celestial influences and wonderful gifts, according to the
capacity that is in that life and sensible soul to receive more noble
and sublime virtues. For the celestial virtue otherwise lies asleep, as
sulphur kept from flame; but in living bodies it doth always burn, as
kindled sulphur, which, by its vapour, fills all the places that are
near.

There is a book called, "A Book of the Laws of Pluto," which speaks of
monstrous generations, which are not produced according to the laws of
Nature. Of these things which follow we know to be true; *viz.* of worms
are generated gnats; of a horse, wasps; of a calf and ox, bees. Take a
living crab, his legs being broken off, and he buried under the earth, a
scorpion is produced. If a duck be dried into powder, and put into
water, frogs are soon generated; but if he be baked in a pie, and cut
into pieces, and be put in a moist place under ground, toads are
generated. Of the herb garden-basil, bruised, and put between two
stones, are generated scorpions. Of the hairs of a menstruous woman, put
under dung, are bred serpents; and the hair of a horse's tail, put into
water, receives life, and is turned into a most pernicious worm. And
there is an art wherewith a hen, sitting upon eggs, may be generated the
form of a man, which I myself know how to do, and which magicians call
the mandrake, and it hath in it wonderful virtues.

You must, therefore, know which and what kind of matters are either of
art or nature, begun or perfected, or compounded of more things, and
what celestial influences they are able to receive. For a congruity of
natural things is sufficient for the receiving of influence from
celestial because, nothing hindering, the celestials send forth their
light upon inferiors they suffer no matter to be destitute of their
virtue. Wherefore as much matter as is perfect and

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *pure* is, as we before said, fitted to receive
celestial influences; for that is the binding and continuing of the
matter of the soul to the world, which doth daily flow in upon things
natural, and all things which *Nature hath prepared*, that it is
impossible that a prepared matter should not receive life, or a more
noble form.
