CHAP. III.

OF AMULETS, CHARMS, AND ENCHANTMENTS.

THE instrument of enchanters is a pure, living, breathing spirit of the
blood, whereby we bind, or attract, those things which we desire or
delight in; so that, by an earnest intention of the mind, we take
possession of the faculties in a no less potent manner than strong wines
beguile the reason and senses of those who drink them; therefore, to
charm, is either to bind with words, in which there is great virtue, as
the poet sings--

"Words thrice she spake, which caus'd, at will, sweet sleep  
"Appeas'd the troubled waves, and roaring deep."

Indeed, the virtue of man's words are so great, that, when pronounced
with a fervent constancy of the mind, they are able to subvert Nature,
to cause earthquakes, storms, and tempests. I have, in the country, by
only speaking a few words, and used some other things, caused terrible
rains and claps of thunder. Almost all charms are impotent without
words, because words are the speech of the speaker, and the image of the
thing signified or spoken of; therefore, whatever wonderful effect is
intended, let the same be performed with the addition of words
significative of the *will or desire* of the operator; for words are a
kind of occult vehicle of the image conceived or begotten, and sent out
of the body by the soul; therefore, all the forcible power of the spirit
ought to be breathed out with vehemency, and an arduous and intent
desire; and I know how to speak, and convey words together, so as they
may be carried onward to the hearer at a vast distance, no other body
intervening, which thing I have done often. Words are also oftentimes
delivered to us, seemingly by others, in our sleep, whereby we seem to
talk and converse; but then no vocal conversations are of any effect,
except they proceed from spiritual and occult causes: such spirits have
often manifested singular things to me, while in sleep, the which, in
waking, I have thought nought of, until conviction of the truth taught
me credulity in such like matters.

\[paragraph continues\] In the late change of Administration, I knew, at
least five days before it actually terminated, that it would be as I
described to a few of my friends. These things are not alike manifested
to every one; only, I believe, to those who have long seriously attended
to contemplations of this abstruse nature; but there are those who will
say it is not so, merely because they themselves cannot comprehend such
things.

However, not to lose time, we proceed. There are various enchantments,
which I have proved, relative to common occurrences of life, *viz.* a
kind of binding to that effect which we desire: as to love, or hatred;
or to those things we love, or against those things we hate, in all
which there is a magical sympathy above the power of reasoning;
therefore, those abstruse matters we feel, are convinced of, and reflect
upon, and draw them into our use. I will here set down, while speaking
of these things, a very powerful amulet for the stopping, immediately, a
bloody-flux; for the which (with a faith) I dare lay down my life for
the success, and entire cure.

An Amulet for Flux of Blood.

"In the blood of Adam arose death--in the blood of Christ death is
extinguished--in the same blood of Christ I command thee, O, blood, that
thou stop fluxing!" <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

In this one godly superstition there will be found a *ready*, cheap,
easy remedy for that dreadful disorder the bloody-flux, whereby a poor
miserable wretch will reap more real benefit than in a whole shop of an
apothecary's drugs. These four letters are a powerful charm, or amulet,
against the common ague; likewise, let them be written upon a piece of
clean and new vellum, at any time of the day or night, and they will be
found a speedy and certain cure, and much more efficacious than the word
*Abracadabra*: however, as that ancient charm is still (amongst some who
pretend to cure agues, &c.) in some repute, I will here set down the
form and manner of its being

written; <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](ma109.htm#fn_3.md) likewise it must be
pronounced, or spoken, in the same order as it is written, with the
intent or will of the operator declared at the same time of making it.
