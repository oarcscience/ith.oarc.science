TO THE READER.

ALTHOUGH we do not, in any point of science, arrogate perfection in
ourselves, yet something we have attained by dear experience, by
diligent labour, and by study, worthy of being communicated for the
instruction of either the licentious libertine, or the grave
student--the observer of Nature; and this, our Work, we concentrated
into a *focus*: it is, as it were, a spiritual essence drawn from a
large quantity of matter; for we can say, with propriety, that this
little Treatise is truly spiritual, and essential to the happiness of
man: therefore, to those who wish to be happy, with every good intention
we commend this Work to be their constant companion and study, in which,
if they persevere, they shall not fail of their desires in the
attainment of the true Philosophers' Stone.
