PART THE SECOND.

CHAP. I.

OF THE FOUR ELEMENTS AND THEIR NATURAL QUALITIES.

IT is necessary that we should know and understand the nature and
quality of the four elements, in order to our being perfect in the
principles and ground-work of our studies in the Talismanic, or Magical
Art.

Therefore, there are four elements, the original grounds of all
corporeal things, *viz.* fire, earth, water, and air, of which elements
all inferior bodies are compounded; not by way of being heaped up
together, but by transmutation and union; and when they are destroyed,
they are resolved into elements. But there are none of the sensible
elements that are pure; but they are, more or less, mixed, and apt to be
changed the one into the other: even as earth, being moistened and
dissolved, becomes *water*, but the same being made thick and hard,
becomes earth again; and being evaporated through heat it passes into
air, and that being kindled into fire, and this being extinguished, into
air gain, but being cooled after burning, becomes earth again, or else
stone, or sulphur; and this is clearly demonstrated by lightning. Now
every one of these elements have two specifical properties: the former
whereof it retains as proper to itself; in the other, as a mean, it
agrees with that which comes directly after it. For fire is hot and
dry--earth, cold and dry;--water, cold and moist--and air, hot and
moist. And so in this manner the elements, according to two contrary
qualities, are opposite one to the other: as fire to water, and earth to
air. Likewise, the elements are contrary one to the other n another
account: two are heavy, as earth and water--and the others are light, as
fire and air; therefore the Stoics called the former, passives--but the
latter, actives. And Plato distinguishes them after another manner, and

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

assigns to each of them three qualities, *viz.* to the fire, brightness,
thinness, and motion--to the earth, darkness, thickness, and quietness;
and, according to these qualities, the elements of fire and earth are
contrary. Now the other elements borrow their qualities from these, so
that the air receives two qualities from the fire,--thinness, and
motion; and the earth one, *viz.* darkness. In like manner water
receives two qualities of the earth,--darkness and thickness; and the
fire one, *viz.* motion. But fire is twice as thin as air, thrice more
moveable, and four times brighter; the air is twice more bright, thrice
more thin, and four times more moveable. Therefore, as fire is to air,
so is air to water, and water to the earth; and again, as the earth is
to the water, so is water to air, and air to fire. And this is the root
and foundation of all bodies, natures, and wonderful works; and he who
can know, and thoroughly understand these qualities of the elements, and
their mixtures, shall bring to pass wonderful and astonishing things in
magic.

Now each of these elements have a threefold consideration, so that the
number of four may make up the number of twelve; and, by passing by the
number of seven into ten, there may be a progress to the supreme unity
upon which all virtue and wonderful things do depend. Of the first order
are the pure elements, which are neither compounded, changed, or mixed,
but are incorruptible; and not OF which, but THROUGH which, the virtues
of all natural things are brought forth to act. No man is able fully to
declare their virtues, because they can do all things upon all things.
He who remains ignorant of these, shall never be able to bring to pass
any wonderful matter.

Of the second order are elements that are compounded, changeable, and
impure; yet such as may, by art, be reduced to their pure simplicity;
whose virtue, when they are thus reduced, doth, above all things,
perfect all occult and common operations of Nature; and these are the
foundation of the whole of Natural Magic.

Of the third order, are those elements which originally and of
themselves are not elements, but are twice compounded, various and
changeable into another. These are the infallible *medium*, and are
called the *middle nature*, or soul of the middle nature; very few there
are that understand the deep mysteries

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

thereof. In them is, by means of certain numbers, degrees, and orders,
the perfection of every effect in what thing soever, whether *natural*,
*celestial*, or supercelestial: they are full of wonders and mysteries,
and are operative as in Magic natural, so divine. For from these,
through them, proceeds the binding, loosing, and transmutation of all
things--the knowledge and foretelling of things to come--also, the
expelling of evil, and the gaining of good spirits. Let no one,
therefore, without these three sorts of elements, and the true knowledge
thereof, be confident that he can work any thing in the Occult Science
of Magic and Nature.

But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of one order into another,
impure into pure, compounded into simple, and shall understand
distinctly the *nature*, *virtue*, and power of them, in number,
degrees, and order, without dividing the substance, he shall easily
attain to the knowledge and perfect operation of all natural things, and
celestial secrets likewise; and this is the perfection of the Cabala,
which teaches all these before mentioned; and, by a perfect knowledge
thereof, we perform many rare and wonderful experiments.
