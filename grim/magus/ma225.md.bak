CHAP. XIII.

OF FINDING OUT THE NAMES OF SPIRITS AND GENII, FROM THE DISPOSITION OF
THE CELESTIAL BODIES.

THE ancient magicians taught an art of finding out the name of a spirit
to any desired effect, drawing it from the disposition of the heavens;
as, for example, any celestial harmony being proposed to thee, to make
an image or a ring, or any other work to be done under any
constellation, if thou wilt find out the spirit that is the ruler of
that work, the figure of the heaven being erected, cast forth letters in
their number and order, from the degree of the ascendant, according to
the succession of signs through each degree, by filling the whole circle
of the heavens; then those letters which fall into the places of the
stars, the aid of which you would use, being according to the number and
power of those stars marked without into number and order, make the name
of a good spirit. But if thou wilt do so from the beginning of a degree
falling *against* the progress of the signs, the resulting spirit shall
be evil. By this art some of the Hebrews and Chaldean masters teach that
the, nature and name of any genius may be found out; as for example, the
degree of the ascendant of any one's nativity being known, and the other
corners of the heaven being co-equated, then let that which has the most
dignities of planets in those four corners, which the *Arabians* call
*Almutez*, be first observed among the rest; and according to that in
the second place, that which shall be next to it in the number of
dignities, and so in order the rest of them, which obtain any dignity in
the aforesaid corners.

This order being used, you may know the true place and degree of them in
the heavens, beginning from the degree of the ascendant through each
degree, according to the order of signs, to cast twenty-two of the
letters of the Hebrews; then what letters shall fall into the places of
the aforesaid stars, being marked and disposed according to the order
found out above in the stars, and

rightly joined together according to the rules of the Hebrew tongue,
make the name of a genius; to which, according to the custom, some
*monosyllable* name of Divine Omnipotence, *viz.* El or Jah, is
subjoined. But if the casting of the letters be made from an angle of
the falling, and against the succession of the signs, and the letters
which shall fall in the Nadir (that is the opposite point) of the
aforesaid stars be after that order, as are said, joined together, shall
make the name of an evil genius.

But the Chaldeans proceed another way, for they take not the Almutez of
the angles but the Almutez of the eleventh house, and do all things as
has been said. Now they find out an evil genius from the Almutez of the
angle of the twelfth house, which they call an evil spirit, casting from
the degree of the falling against the progress of the signs.
