CHAP. XXXVIII.

OF THE IMAGES OF MARS.

FROM the operations of Mars, they made an image in the hour of Mars
(Mars ascending in the second face of Aries), in a martial stone,
especially in a diamond; the form of which was a man armed, riding upon
a lion, having in his right hand a naked sword erect, carrying in his
left hand the head of a man. They report that an image of this kind
renders a man powerful in good and evil, so that he shall be feared by
all; and whoever carries it, they give him the power of enchantment, so
that he shall terrify men by his looks when he is angry, and stupify
them. They made another image of Mars, for obtaining boldness, courage,
and good fortune, in wars and contentions; the form of which was a
soldier, armed and crowned, girt with a sword, carrying in his right
hand a long lance; and they made this at the hour of Mars, the first
face of Scorpio ascending with it.
