GEORGE RIPLEY.

GEORGE RIPLEY, an *Englishman* by nation, and by profession a canon or
monk of *Britlingthon*. His writings were all very good in their kind,
being wrote exactly in the style of *Bacon*, only more allegorical. As
he was no physician, he does not meddle with any thing of the
preparations of that kind; but treats much of the cure of metals, which
in his language is the purification and maturation thereof. He
rigorously pursued *Geber's* and *Bacon's* principles, and maintained,
for instance, with new evidence, that mercury is the universal matter of
all metals; that this set over the fire, with the purest sulphur, will
become gold, but that if either of them be sick or leprous, *i. e.*
infected with any impurity, instead of gold, some other metal will be
produced. He adds, that as mercury and sulphur are sufficient for the
making of all metals: so of these may an universal medicine, or metal,
be produced for curing of all the sick; which some mistakenly understood
of an universal metal, efficacious in all the diseases of the human
body.
