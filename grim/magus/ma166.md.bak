CHAP. XLV.

THAT HUMAN IMPRECATIONS NATURALLY IMPRESS THEIR POWERS UPON EXTERNAL
THINGS--AND HOW MAN'S MIND, THROUGH A DEGREE OF DEPENDENCIES, ASCENDS
INTO THE INTELLIGIBLE WORLD, AND BECOMES LIKE TO THE MORE SUBLIME
SPIRITS AND INTELLIGENCES.

THE celestial souls send forth their virtues to the celestial bodies,
which transmit them to this sensible world; for the virtues of the
terrene orb proceed from no other cause than celestial. Hence the
magician, that will work by them, uses a cunning invocation of the
superiors, with mysterious words and a certain kind of ingenious speech,
drawing the one to the other; yet by a natural force, through a certain
mutual agreement between them, whereby

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

things follow of their own accord, or sometimes are drawn unwillingly.
Hence says Aristotle, in his sixth book of his Mystical Philosophy,
"that when any one, by binding or bewitching, calls upon the Sun or
other stars, praying them to assist the work desired, the Sun and other
stars do not hear his words; but are moved, after a certain manner, by a
certain conjunction and mutual series, whereby the parts of the world
are mutually subordinate the one to the other, and have a mutual
consent, by reason of their great union: as in a man's body, one member
is moved by perceiving the motion of another; and in a harp, one string
is moved by the motion of another. So when any one moves any part of the
world, other parts are moved by the perceiving of that motion."--The
knowledge, therefore, of the dependency of things following one the
other, is the foundation of all wonderful operation, which is
necessarily required to the exercising the power of attracting superior
virtues. Now the words of men are certain natural things; and because
the parts of the world mutually draw one the other; therefore a magician
invocating by words, works by powers fitted to Nature, by leading some
by the love of one to the other; or drawing others, by reason of the one
following after the other; or by repelling, by reason of the enmity of
one to the other, from the contrariety and difference of things, and
multitude of virtues; which, although they are contrary and different,
yet perfect one part. Sometimes, also, he compels things by way of
authority, by the celestial virtue, because he is not a stranger to the
heavens. A man, therefore, if he receives the impression of a ligation,
or fascination, doth not receive it according to the rational soul, but
sensual; and if he suffers in any part, he suffers according to the
animal part; for they cannot draw a knowing and intelligent man by
reason, but by receiving that impression and force by sense; inasmuch as
the animal spirit of man is, by the influence of the celestials, and
co-operation of the things of the world, affected beyond his former and
natural disposition. As the son moves the father to labour, although
unwilling, to keep and maintain him, although he be wearied; and the
desire to rule, is moved by anger and other labours to get the dominion;
and the indigency of nature, and fear of poverty, moves a man to desire
riches; and the ornaments and beauty of women, is an incitement

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

to concupiscence; and the harmony of a wise musician moves his hearers
with various passions, whereof some do voluntary follow the consonancy
of art, others conform themselves by gesture, although unwilling,
because their sense is captivated, their reason not being intent to
these things. Hence they fall into errors, who think those things to be
above nature, or contrary to nature--which indeed are by nature, and
according to nature. We must know, therefore, that every superior moves
its next inferior, in its degree and order, [not](errata.htm#4.md) only in
bodies, but also in spirits: so the universal soul moves the particular
soul; the rational acts upon the sensual, and that upon the vegetable;
and every part of the world acts upon another, and every part is apt to
be moved by another. And every part of this inferior world suffers from
the heavens, according to their nature and aptitude, as one part of the
animal body suffers for another. And the superior intellectual world
moves all things below itself; and, after a manner, contains all the
same beings, from the first to the last, which are in the inferior
world. Celestial bodies, therefore, move the bodies of the elementary
world, compounded, generable, sensible (from the circumference to the
centre), by superior, perpetual, and spiritual essences, depending on
the primary intellect, which is the acting intellect; but upon the
virtue put in by the word of God; which word the wise Chaldeans of
Babylon call, the Cause of Causes; because from it are produced all
beings: the acting intellect, which is the second, from it depends; and
that by reason of the union of the word with the First Author, from whom
all things being are truly produced: the word, therefore, is the image
of God--the acting intellect, the image of the word--the soul is the
image of this intellect--and our word is the image of the soul, by which
it acts upon natural things naturally, because nature is the work
thereof. And every one of those perfects his subsequent: as a father his
son; and none of the latter exists without the former; for they are
depending among themselves by a kind of ordinate dependency--so that
when the latter is corrupted, it is returned into that which was next
before it, until it come to the heavens; then to the universal soul;
and, lastly, into the acting intellect, by which all other creatures
exist; and itself exists in the principal author, which is the creating
word of God, to which, at length, all things are

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

returned. Our soul, therefore, if it will work any wonderful thing in
these inferiors, must have respect to their beginning, that it may be
strengthened and illustrated by that, and receive power of acting
through each degree, from the very first Author. Therefore we must be
more diligent in contemplating the souls of the stars--then their
bodies, and the super-celestial and intellectual world--then the
celestial, corporeal, because that is more noble; although, also, this
be excellent, and the way to that, and without which medium the
influence of the superior cannot be attained to. As for example: the Sun
is the king of stars, most full of light; but receives it from the
intelligible world, above all other stars, because the soul thereof is
more capable of intelligible splendour. Wherefore he that desires to
attract the influence of the Sun, must contemplate upon the Sun; not
only by the speculation of the exterior light, but also of the interior.
And no man can do this, unless he return to the soul of the Sun, and
become like to it, and comprehend the intelligible light thereof with an
intellectual sight, as the sensible light with the corporeal eye; for
this man shall be filled with the light thereof, and the light whereof,
which is an under type impressed by the supernal orb, it receives into
itself; with the illustration whereof his intellect being endowed, and
truly like to it, and being assisted by it, shall at length attain to
that supreme brightness, and to all forms that partake thereof; and when
he hath received the light of the supreme degree, then his soul shall
come to perfection, and be made like to spirits of the Sun, and shall
attain to the virtues and illustrations of the supernatural virtue, and
shall enjoy the power of them, if he has obtained faith in the First
Author. In the first place, therefore, we must implore assistance from
the First Author; and praying, not only with mouth, but a religious
gesture and supplicant soul, also abundantly, incessantly, and
sincerely, that he would enlighten our mind, and remove darkness,
growing upon our souls by reason of our bodies.
