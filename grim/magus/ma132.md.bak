CHAP. X.

OF THE COMPOSITION OF SOME PERFUMES APPROPRIATED TO THE SEVEN PLANETS.

THE SUN. ☉

WE make a suffumigation for the sun in this manner:--

Take of saffron, ambergris, musk, lignum aloes, lignum balsam, the fruit
of the laurel, cloves, myrrh, and frankincense; of each a like quantity;
all of which being bruised, and mixed together, so as to make a sweet
odour, must be incorporated with the brain of an eagle, or the blood of
a white cock, after the manner of pills, or troches.

THE MOON. ☽

For the moon, we make a suffume of the head of a frog dried, and the
eyes of a bull, the seed of white poppies, frankincense, and camphire,
which must be incorporated with menstruous blood, or the blood of a
goose.

SATURN. ♄

For saturn take the seed of black poppies, henbane, mandrake root,
loadstone, and myrrh, and mix them up with the brain of a cat and the
blood of a bat.

JUPITER. ♃

Take the seed of ash, lignum aloes, storax, the gum Benjamin, the lapis
lazuli, the tops of peacocks' feathers, and incorporate with the blood
of a stork, or swallow, or the brain of a hart.

MARS. ♂

Take uphorbium, bdellium, gum armoniac, the roots of both hellebores,
the loadstone, and a little sulphur, and incorporate them altogether
with the brain of a hart, the blood of a man, and the blood of a black
cat.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

VENUS. ♀

Take musk, ambergris, lignum aloes, red roses, and red coral, and make
them up with sparrow's brains and pigeon's blood.

MERCURY. ☿

Take mastich, frankincense, cloves, and the herb cinquefoil, and the
agate stone, and incorporate them all with the brain of a fox, or
weasel, and the blood of a magpie.

GENERAL FUMES OF THE PLANETS.

To Saturn are appropriated for fumes, odoriferous roots: as pepper-wort
root, &c., and the frankincense tree. To *Jupiter*, all odoriferous
fruits: as nutmegs, cloves, &c. To *Mars*, all odoriferous woods: as
sanders, Cyprus, lignum balsam, and lignum aloes. To the Sun, all gums:
as frankincense, mastich benjamin, storax, laudanum, ambergris, and
musk. To *Venus*, flowers: as roses, violets, saffron, and the like. To
Mercury, all the parings of wood or fruit: as cinnamon, lignum cassia,
mace, citron peel, and bayberries, and whatever seeds are odoriferous.
To the Moon, the leaves of all vegetables: as the leaf indum, the leaf
of the myrtle, and bay tree. Know, also, that according to the opinion
of all magicians, in every good matter (as love, good-will, &c.), there
must be a good perfume, odoriferous and precious;--and in evil matters
(as hatred, anger, misery, and the like), there must be a stinking fume
that is of no worth.

The twelves Signs of the Zodiac also have their proper suffumigations,
*viz.*, Aries, *myrrh*; Taurus, *pepper-wort*; Gemini, *mastich*;
Cancer, *camphire*; Leo, *frankincense*; Virgo, *sanders*; Libra,
*galbanum*; Scorpio, *oppoponax*; Sagittarius, *lignum aloes*;
Capricorn, *benjamin*; Aquarius, *euphorbium*; Pisces, *red storax*. But
Hermes describes the most powerful fume to be, that which is compounded
of the seven aromatics, according to the powers of the seven planets:
for it receives from *Saturn*, pepper-wort; from *Jupiter*, nutmeg;

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

from *Mars*, lignum-aloes; from the *Sun*, mastich; from *Venus*,
saffron; from *Mercury*, cinnamon; and from the *Moon*, myrtle.

By a close observation of the above order of suffumigations, conjoined
with other things, of which we shall speak hereafter (necessary to the
full accomplishment of Talismanic Magic), many wonderful effects may be
caused, especially if we keep in eye what was delivered in the first
part of our Magic, *viz.* that the soul of the operator must go along
with this; otherwise, in vain is *suffumigation, seal, ring, image,
picture, glass*, or any other instrument of magic: seeing that it is not
merely the disposition, but the act of the disposition, and firm and
powerful intent or imagination that gives the effect.--We shall now
hasten to speak, generally, of the construction of rings magical, and
their wonderful and potent virtues and operations.
