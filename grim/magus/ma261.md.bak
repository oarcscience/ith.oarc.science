BABYLONIANS.

UNDER this article of *Babylonians* we shall just give the reader a
general sketch of the antiquity of occult learning among the Chaldeans
of *Babylon*, so famous for their speculations in astrology. *Diodorus
Siculus* informs us, that the inhabitants of Babylon assert, that their
city was very ancient; for they counted four hundred and seventy-three
thousand years, from the first observations of their astrologers to the
coming of *Alexander*. Others say, that the *Babylonians* boasted of
having preserved in their archives the observations which their
astrologers had made on nativities for the space of four hundred and
seventy thousand years; from hence we ought to correct a passage of
*Pliny*, which some authors make use of improperly, either to confute
the antiquity of Babylon, or for other purposes. Aristotle knew without
doubt that the *Babylonians* boasted of having a series of astronomical
observations comprehending a prodigious number of centuries. He was
desirous to inform himself of the truth of this by means of
*Calisthenes*, who was in Alexander's retinue, but found a great mistake
in the account; for it is pretended that *Calisthenes* assured him that
the astronomical observations he had

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

seen in *Babylon*, comprehended no more than 1903 years. *Simplicius*
reports this, and borrows it from *Porphyry*. If *Calisthenes* has
computed right, it must be agreed, that after the deluge men made very
great haste to become astrologers; for according to the Hebrew Bible
there is but two thousand years <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) to
be found from the flood to the death of *Alexander*. There is reason to
question what *Simplicius* reports, and it is remarkable that all the
ancient authors, who have ascribed the building of *Babylon* to
*Semiramis*, have no authority than that of *Ctesias*, whose histories
abounded in fables. And, therefore, we see that *Berosius* blames the
*Greek* writers for affirming, that *Semiramis* built *Babylon*, and
adorned it with the most beautiful structures. The supplement to
*Moreri* quotes *Quintus Curtinus*, in relation to the immodesty of the
*Babylonian* women <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md), who prostituted
their bodies to strangers for money, under the idea of performing their
devotions required by Venus. Observe, that these sums were afterwards
applied to religious uses.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[169:1](ma261.htm#fr_24.md) *Epigenus* tells us,
that amongst the Babylonians there were celestial observations for four
hundred and seventy thousand years, inscribed on pillars or tables of
bricks. *Berosius* and *Critodemus*, who make the least of it, say four
hundred and ninety years.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[169:2](ma261.htm#fr_25.md) This lascivious
ceremony was very ancient. *Jeremiah's* letter inserted in the book of
*Baruch* touches something on it, but in an obscure manner, and wants a
commentary taken out of *Herodotus*. Jeremiah's text runs thus:--"The
women also with cords about them sat in the ways--but if any of them,
drawn by some that passeth by, lie with him, she reproacheth her fellow,
that she was not thought as worthy as herself, nor her cord broken."
Herodotus informs us, that there was a law in *Babylon* which obliged
all the women of the country to seat themselves near the temple of
*Venus*, and there to wait an opportunity of copulating with a stranger,
&c. &c.
