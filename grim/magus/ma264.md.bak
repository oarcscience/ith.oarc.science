ROGER BACON,

COMMONLY CALLED

FRIAR BACON.

ROGER BACON, an Englishman, and a *Franciscan* friar, lived in the XIII
century. He was a great *Astrologer, Chymist, Mathematician*, and
*Magician*. There runs a tradition in English annals, that this friar
made a brazen head, under the rising of the planet Saturn, which spake
with a man's voice, and gave responses to all his questions. *Francis
Picus* says, "that he read in a book wrote by Bacon, that a man might
foretel things to come by means of the mirror *Almuchesi*, composed
according to the rules of perspective; provided he made use of it under
a good constellation, and first brought his body into an even and
temperate state by chymistry." This is agreeable to what *John Picus*
has maintained, that *Bacon* gave himself only to the study of *Natural
Magic*. This friar sent several instruments of his own invention to pope
Clement IV. Several of his books have been published (but they are now
very

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

scarce,) *viz.* *Specula Mathematica & Perspectiva*, *Speculum
Alchymiæ*, *De Mirabili Potestate Artis & Naturæ*, *Epistolæ, cum
Notis*, &c. In all probability he did not perform any thing by any
compact with devils, but has only ascribed to things a surprising
efficacy which they could not naturally have. He was well versed in
judicial astrology. His Speculum Astrologiæ was condemned by Gerson and
Agrippa. Francis Picus and many others have condemned it only because
the author maintains in it, *that, with submission to better judgments,
books of magic ought to be carefully preserved, because the time draws
near that, for certain causes not there specified, they must necessarily
be perused and made use of on some occasions*. *Naude adds*, "that
*Bacon* was so much addicted to judicial astrology, that *Henry de
Hassia*, *William* of *Paris*, and *Nicholas Oresmius*, were obliged to
inveigh sharply against his writings." *Bacon* was fellow of
*Brazen-nose* college in *Oxford* in the year 1226. He was beyond all
compeer the glory of the age he lived in, and may perhaps stand in
competition with the greatest that have appeared since. It is wonderful,
considering the age wherein he lived, how he came by such a depth of
knowledge on all subjects. His treatises are composed with that
elegancy, conciseness, and strength, and abound with such just and
exquisite observations on nature, that, among the whole line of
chymists, we do not know one that can pretend to contend with him. The
reputation of his uncommon learning still survives in *England*. His
cell is shewn at *Oxford* to this day; and there is a tradition, that it
will fall whenever a greater man than *Bacon* shall enter within it. He
wrote many treatises; amongst which, such as are yet extant have
beauties enough to make us sensible of the great loss of the rest. What
relates to chymistry are two small pieces, wrote at *Oxford*, which are
now in print, and the manuscripts to be seen in the public library at
*Leiden*; having been carried thither among *Vossius's* manuscripts from
*England*. In these treatises he clearly shews how imperfect metals may
be ripened into perfect ones. He entirely adopts *Geber's* notion, that
mercury is the common basis of all metals, and sulphur the cement; and
shews that it is by a gradual depuration of the mercurial matter by
sublimation, and the accession of a subtle sulphur by fire, that nature
makes her gold; and that, if during the process, any other third matter
happen to

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

intervene, besides the mercury and sulphur, some base metal arises: so
that, if we by imitating her operations ripen lead, we might easily
change it into good gold.

Several of *Bacon's* operations have been compared with the experiments
of Monsieur *Homberg*, made by that curious prince the duke of
*Orleans*; by which it has been found that *Bacon* has described some of
the very things which *Homberg* published as his own discoveries. For
instance, *Bacon* teaches expressly, that if a pure sulphur be united
with mercury, it will commence gold: on which very principle, Monsieur
Homberg has made various experiments for the production of gold,
described in the *Memoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences*. His other
physical writings shew no less genius and force of mind. In a treatise
 <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md) *Of the secrets Works of Nature*,
he shews that a person who was perfectly acquainted with the manner
nature observes in her operations, would not only be able to rival, but
to surpass nature herself.

This author's works are printed in 8vo and 12mo, under the title of
*Frater Rogerius Baco de Secretis Artis & Naturæ*, but they are become
very rare. From a repeated perusal of them we may perceive that *Bacon*
was no stranger to many of the capital discoveries of the present and
past ages. Gunpowder he certainly knew; thunder and lightning, he tells
us, may be produced by art and that sulphur, nitre, and charcoal, which
when separate have no sensible effect, when mingled together in a due
proportion, and closely confined, yield a horrible crack. A more precise
description of gunpowder cannot be given with words: and yet a Jesuit,
*Barthol. Schwartz*, some ages afterwards, has had the honour of the
discovery. He likewise mentions a sort of inextinguishable fire,
prepared by art, which indicates he knew something of phosphorus. And
that he had a notion of the rarefaction of the air, and the structure of
the air-pump, is past contradiction. A chariot, he observes, might be
framed on the principle of mechanics, which, being sustained on very
large globes, specifically lighter than common air, would carry a man
aloft through the atmosphere; this proves that he likewise had a
competent idea of aerostation.

There are many curious speculations in this noble author, which will
raise the admiration of the reader: but none of them will affect him
with so much wonder, as to see a person of the most sublime merit fall a
sacrifice to the wanton zeal of infatuated bigots. See BOERHAAVE'S
*Chym*. p. 18.
