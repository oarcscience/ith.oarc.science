# The Magus

### by Francis Barrett

#### London, 1801

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Magus is one of the primary sources for the study of ceremonial
magic, and for a long time was one of the rarest and most sought after
of the 19th century grimoires. Barretts' magnum opus embodies deep
knowledge of Alchemy, Astrology, and the Kabbalah, and has been cited by
the Golden Dawn and other occult and esoteric movements as source
material. Written in 1801 in the middle of the 'Age of Reason',
sandwiched between Newton and Darwin, this was possibly the last epoch
that a work like this could be composed.

*BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE*: The Magus is broken down into two physical
volumes. The reference to three books on the title page may be
confusing. The third book is the biographical section and comprises part
of the second volume. The biographical section has been deprecated by
authorities such as Waite, and it's not even certain that it was written
by Barrett; it may have been added as filler by the printer.
