CHAP. XLIII.

OF THE IMAGES OF THE HEAD AND TAIL OF THE DRAGON OF THE MOON.

THEY made, also, the image of the head. and tail of the Dragon of the
Moon, namely, between an ærial and fiery circle, the likeness of a
serpent, with the head of a hawk, tied about them after the manner of
the great letter Theta; they made it when Jupiter, with the head,
obtained the mid heaven; which image they affirm to avail much for the
success of petitions, and would signify by this image a good and
fortunate genius, which they would represent by this image of the
serpent; for the Egyptians and Phoenicians do extol this creature above
all others, and say it is a divine creature, and hath a divine nature;
for in this is a more acute spirit, and a greater fire than in any
other, which thing is manifest both by his swift motion without feet,
hands,

or any other instruments; and also that it often renews its age with his
skin, and becomes young again; but they made the image of the tail like
as when the Moon was eclipsed in the tail, or ill affected by Saturn or
Mars, and they made it to introduce anguish, infirmity, and Misfortune:
we call it an evil genius.
