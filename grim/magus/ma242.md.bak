An INVOCATION *of the* GOOD SPIRITS.

IN the name of the blessed and Holy Trinity, I do desire thee, strong,
and mighty angels (*here name the spirits you would have appear*) that
if it be the divine will of him who is called Tetragrammaton, &c. the
holy God, the Father, that thou take upon thee some shape as best
becometh thy celestial nature, and appear to us visibly here in this
place, and answer our demands, in as far as we shall not transgress the
bounds of the divine mercy and goodness,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

by requesting unlawful knowledge; but that thou wilt graciously shew us
what things are most profitable for us to know and do to the glory and
honour of his divine Majesty who liveth and reigneth, world without end.
Amen.

Lord thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven--make clean our hearts
within us, and take not thy holy spirit from us. O Lord, by thy name we
have called them, suffer them to administer unto us.

And that all things may work together for thy honour and glory, to whom
with thee, the Son and blessed Spirit, be ascribed all might, majesty,
and dominion world without end. *Amen*.
