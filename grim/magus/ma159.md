CHAP. XXXVII.

FROM the operations of Jupiter they made, for prolongation of life, an
image in the hour of Jupiter, Jupiter being in his exaltation
fortunately ascending, in a clear and white stone; whose figure was a
man crowned

clothed with garments of a saffron colour, riding upon an eagle or
dragon, having in his right hand a dart, about, as it were, to strike it
into the head of the same eagle or dragon. They made, also, another
image of Jupiter, at the same convenient season, in a white and clear
stone, especially in crystal; and it was a naked man crowned, having
both his hands joined together and lifted up, as it were, deprecating
something sitting in a four-footed chair, which is carried by four
winged boys; and they affirm that this image increases felicity, riches,
honours, and confers benevolence and prosperity, and frees from enemies.
They made, also, another image of Jupiter, for a religious and glorious
life, and advancement of fortune; whose figure was a man having the head
of a lion or a ram, and eagle's feet, and clothed in saffron coloured
clothes.
