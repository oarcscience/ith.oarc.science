CHAP. XL.

OF THE IMAGES OF VENUS.

FROM the operations of Venus they made an image, which was available for

to obtain the love of women, in the lapis lazuli, at the hour of Venus,
*Venus* ascending in *Taurus*; the figure of which was a naked maid,
with her hair spread abroad, having a looking-glass in her hand, and a
chain tied about her neck--and near her a handsome young man, holding
her with his left hand by the chain, but with his right hand doing up
her hair, and both looking lovingly on one another--and about them is a
little winged boy, holding a sword or dart. They made another image of
Venus, the first face of *Taurus, Libra*, or *Pisces*, ascending with
Venus; the figure of which was a little maid, with her hair spread
abroad, clothed in long and white garments, holding a laurel apple, or
flowers, in her right hand, in her left a comb: it is said to make men
pleasant, jocund, strong, cheerful, and to give beauty.
