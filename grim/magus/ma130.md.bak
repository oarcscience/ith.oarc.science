CHAP. VIII.

OF THE SEALS AND CHARACTERS IMPRESSED BY CELESTIALS UPON NATURAL THINGS.

ALL stars have their peculiar natures, properties, and conditions, the
seals and characters whereof they produce through their rays even in
these inferior things, *viz.* in elements, in stones, in plants, in
animals, and their members; whence every thing receives from an
harmonious disposition, and from its star shining upon it, some
particular seal or character stamped upon it, which is the significator
of that star or harmony, containing in it a peculiar virtue, different
from other virtues of the same matter, both generically, specifically,
and numerically. Every thing, therefore, hath its *character* impressed
upon it by its *star* for some peculiar effect, especially by that star
which doth principally govern it; and these characters contain in them
the particular natures, virtues, and roots of their stars, and produce
the like operations upon other things on which they are reflected; and
stir up and help the influences of their stars, whether they be planets,
or fixed stars and figures, or celestial constellations, *viz.* as often
as they shall be made in a fit matter, and in their due and accustomed
times; which the ancient wise men (considering such as laboured much in
finding out occult properties of things) did set down, in writing, the
images of the stars, their figures, seals, marks, characters, such as
Nature herself did describe by the rays of the stars in these inferior
bodies: some in

stones, some in plants, some in joints and knots of trees and their
boughs, and some in various members of animals. For the bay-tree,
lote-tree, and marigold, are solary herbs, and their roots and knots
being cut, they show the characters of the sun; and in stones the
character and images of celestial things are often found. But there
being so great a diversity of things, there is only a traditional
knowledge of a few things which human understanding is able to reach;
therefore very few of those things are known to us, which the ancient
philosophers and chiromancers attained to, partly by reason and partly
by experience; and there yet lie hid many things in the treasury of
Nature, which the diligent student and wise searcher shall contemplate
and discover.
