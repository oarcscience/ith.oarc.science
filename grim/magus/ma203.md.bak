CHAP. II.

OF SYMPATHETIC MEDICINES.

IN the year 1639, a little book came forth, whose title was, 'The
Sympathetical Powder of Edricius Mohynus, of Eburo,' whereby wounds are
cured without application of the medicine unto the part afflicted, and
without superstition; it being sifted by the sieve of the reasons of
Galen and Aristotle; wherein it is Aristotetically, sufficiently,
proved, whatsoever the title of it promises; but it hath neglected the
*directive faculty*, or *virtue*, which may bring the virtues of the
sympathetical powder, received in the bloody towel or napkin, unto the
distant wound.

Truly, from a wound, the venal blood, or corrupt pus, or sanies, from an
ulcer, being received in the towel, do receive, indeed, a balsam from a
sanative or healing being; I say, from the power of the vitriol, a
medicinal power connected and limited in the aforesaid mean; but the
virtues of the balsam received are directed unto the wounded object, not
indeed by an influential virtue of the stars, and much less do they fly
forth of their own accord unto the object at a distance: therefore the
ideas of him that applieth the sympathetical remedy are connected in the
mean, and are made directresses of the balsam unto the object of his
desire: even as we have above also minded by injections concerning ideas
of the desire. Mohyns supposed that the power of sympathy depends upon
the stars, because it is an imitator of influences: but I draw it out of
a much nearer subject: to wit, out of directing ideas, begotten by their
mother Charity, or a desire of goodwill: for, from hence does that
sympathetic powder operate more successfully, being applied by the hand
of one than another: therefore I have always observed the best process
where the remedy is instituted by a desire of charity; but, that it doth
succeed, with small success, if the operator be a careless or drunken
person; and, from hence, I have more esteemed the stars of

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the mind, in sympathetical remedies, than the stars of heaven: but that
images, being conceived, are brought unto an object at a distance, a
pregnant woman is an example of, because she is she who presently
transfers all the ideas of her conception on her young, which dependeth
no otherwise on the mother than from a communion of universal
nourishment. Truly, seeing such a direction of desire is plainly
natural, it is no wonder that the evil spirit doth require the ideas of
the desires of his imps to be annexed unto a mean offered by him.
Indeed, the ideas of the desire are after the manner of the influences
of heaven cast into a proper object how locally remote soever; that is,
they are directed by the desire, especially pointing out an object for
itself, even as the sight of the basilisk, or touch of the torpedo, is
reflected on their willed object; for I have already shewn in its place,
that the devil doth not attribute so much as any thing in the directions
of things injected; but that he hath need of a free, directing, and
operative power or faculty. But I will not disgrace sympathetical
remedies because the devil operates something about things injected into
the body: for what have sympathetical remedies in common? Although Satan
doth co-operate in injections by wicked natural means required from his
bond slaves; for every thing shall be judged guilty, or good, from its
ends and intents: and it is sufficient that sympathetical remedies do
agree with things injected in natural means, or medicines.
