CHAP. XIX.

BY WHAT MEANS MAGICIANS AND NECROMANCERS CALL FORTH THE SOULS OF THE
DEAD.

BY the things which have been already spoken it is manifest, that souls
after death do as yet love their body which they left, as those souls do
whose bodies want due burial or have left their bodies by violent death,
and as yet wander about their carcasses in a troubled and moist spirit,
being, as it were, allured by something that hath an affinity with them,
the means being known, by which in times past, they were joined to their
bodies, they may be easily called forth

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and allured by the like vapours, liquors and savours, certain artificial
lights being also used, songs, sounds, and such like, which moves the
imaginative and spiritual harmony of the soul; and sacred invocations,
and such like, as belong to religion, ought not to be neglected by
reason of the portion of the rational soul which is above nature.

Necromancy has its name because it works on the bodies of the dead, and
gives answers by the ghosts and apparitions of the dead, and
subterraneous spirits, alluring them into the carcasses of the dead by
certain hellish charms, and infernal invocations, and by deadly
sacrifices and wicked oblations.

There are two kinds of necromancy: raising the carcasses, which is not
done without blood; the other sciomancy, in which the calling up of the
shadow only suffices. To conclude, it works all its experiments by the
carcasses of the slain and their bones and members, and what is from
them; for there is in these things a spiritual power friendly to them:
therefore they easily allure the flowing down of wicked spirits, by
reason of the similitude and property of every familiar, by whom the
necromancer, strengthened by their help, can do much in human and
terrestrial things, and kindle unlawful lusts, cause dreams, diseases,
hatred, and such like passions; to which also they can confer the powers
of the soul, which as yet being involved in a moist and turbid spirit,
wandering about their cast bodies, can do the same things that the
wicked spirits commit, seeing therefore they, experimentally find, that
the wicked and impure souls violently plucked from their bodies, and of
men not expiated, and wanting burial, do stray about carcasses, and are
drawn to them by affinity. The witches easily abuse them for effecting
witchcraft, alluring these unhappy souls, by the opposition of their
body, or by the taking of some parts thereof, and compelling them by
their devilish charms, by entreating them by the deformed carcasses
dispersed through the wide fields, and the wandering shadows of those
who want burials, and by the ghosts sent back from *Acheron*, and the
guests of hell, whom untimely death has precipitated into hell, and by
the horrible desires of the damned and proud devils, revengers of
wickedness. But he who

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

could restore the souls truly to their bodies, must first know what is
the proper nature of the soul from whence it went forth, with how many
and how great degrees of perfection it is replenished, with what
intelligence it is strengthened, by what means diffused into the body,
by what harmony it shall be compacted with it, what affinity it hath
with God, with the intelligences, with the heavens, elements, and all
other things, whose image and resemblance it holds, To conclude, by what
influences the body may be knit together again for the raising of the
dead, requires all these things which belong not to men, but to God
only, and to whom he will communicate them.
