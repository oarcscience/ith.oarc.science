CHAP. XVIII.

OF THE NUMBER THREE AND SCALE.

THE number Three, is an uncompounded number, a holy number, a number of
perfection, a most powerful number:--for there are three persons in God;
there are three theological virtues in religion. Hence it is that this
number conduceth to the ceremonies of God and religion, that by the
solemnity of which, prayers and sacrifices are thrice repeated; for
corporeal and spiritual things consist of three things, *viz.*
beginning, middle, and end. By three, as Trismegistus saith, the world
is perfected--harmony, necessity, and order, *i. e.* concurrence of
causes (which many call fate), and the execution of them to the fruit,
or increase, or a due distribution of the increase. The whole measure of
time is concluded in three, *viz.* past, present, and to come;--all
magnitude is contained in three--line, superfices, and body;--

every body consists of three intervals,--length, breadth, and thickness.
Harmony contains three consents in time--diapason, hemiolion,
diatesseron. There are also three kinds of souls--vegetative, sensitive,
and intellectual. And as such, saith the Prophet, God orders the world
by number, weight, and measure; and the number three is deputed to the
ideal forms thereof, as the number two is the procreating matter, and
unity to God the maker of it.--Magicians do constitute three Princes of
the world--Oromasis, Mithris, Araminis; *i. e.* God, the mind, and the
spirit. By the three-square or solid, the three numbers of nine, of
things produced, are distributed, *viz.* of the supercelestial into nine
orders of intelligences; of celestial, into nine orbs; of inferiors,
into nine kinds of generable and corruptible things. Lastly, into this
eternal orb, *viz.* twenty-seven, all musical proportions are included.,
as Plato and Proclus do at large discourse; and the number three hath,
in a harmony of five, the grace of the first voice. Also, in
intelligences, there are three hierarchies of angelical spirits. There
are three powers of intellectual creatures--memory, mind, and will.
There are three orders of the blessed, *viz.* martyrs, confessors, and
innocents. There are three quaternions of celestial signs, *viz.* of
fixed, moveable, and common; as also of houses, *viz.* centres,
succeeding, and falling. There are, also, three faces and heads in every
sign, and three Lords of each triplicity. There are three fortunes
amongst the planets. In the infernal crew, three judges, three furies,
three-headed Cerberus: we read, also, of a thrice-double Hecate. Three
months of the Virgin Diana. Three persons in the super-substantial
Divinity. Three times--of nature, law, and grace. Three theological
virtues--faith, hope, and charity. Jonah was three days in the whale's
belly; and so many was Christ in the grave.
