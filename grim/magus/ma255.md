HERMES, SURNAMED TRISMEGISTUS,

OR THE

THRICE GREATEST INTELLIGENCER.

HERMES Trismegistus, (who was the author of the divine Pymander and some
other books,) lived some time before Moses. He received the name of
Trismegistus, or Mercurius ter Maximus, *i. e.* thrice greatest
Intelligencer, because he was the first intelligencer who communicated
celestial and divine knowledge to mankind by writing.

He was reported to have been king of Egypt; without doubt he was an
Egyptian; nay, if you believe the Jews, even their Moses; and for the
justification of this they urge, 1st, His being well skilled in
*chemistry*; nay, the first who communicated that art to the sons of
men; 2dly, They urge the *philosophic work*, *viz*. of rendering gold
medicinal, or, finally, of the art of making *aurum potabile*; and,
thirdly, of teaching the *Cabala*, which they say was shewn him by God
on Mount Sinai: for all this is confessed to be originally written in
Hebrew, which he would not have done had he not been an Hebrew, but
rather in his vernacular tongue. But whether he was Moses or not <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md), it is certain he was an Egyptian, even as
Moses himself also was; and therefore for the age he lived in, we shall
not fall short of the time if we conclude he flourished much about the
time of Moses; and if he really was not the identical Moses, affirmed to
be so by many, it is more than probable that he was king of Egypt; for
being chief philosopher, he was, according

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

to the Egyptian custom, initiated into the mysteries of priesthood, and
from thence to the chief governor or king.

He was called Ter Maximus, as having a perfect knowledge of all things
contained in the world (as his *Aureus*, or *Golden Tractate*, and his
*Divine Pymander* shews) which things he divided into three kingdoms,
*viz.* animal, vegetable, and mineral; in the knowledge and
comprehension of which three he excelled and transmitted to posterity,
in *enigmas* and *symbols*, the profound secrets of nature; likewise a
true description of the *Philosopher's Quintessence*, or *Universal
Elixir*, which he made as the receptacle of all celestial and
terrestrial virtues. The *Great Secret* of the philosophers he
discoursed on, which was found engraven upon a Smaragdine table, in the
valley of Ebron.

Johannes Functius, in his Chronology says, he lived in the time of
Moses, twenty-one years before the law was given in the wilderness.
Suidas seems to confirm it by saying, "Credo Mercurium Trismegistum
sapientem Egyptium floruisse ante Pharaonem." But this of Suidas may be
applied to several ages, for that Pharaoh was the general name of their
kings; or possibly it might be intended before the name of Pharaoh was
given to their kings, which, if so <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md),
he makes Trismegistus to exist 400 years before Moses, yea, before
Abraham's descent into Egypt. There is no doubt but that he possessed
the great secret of the philosophic work; and if God ever appeared in
man, he appeared in him, as is evident both from his books and his
Pymander; in which works he has communicated the sum of the abyss, and
the divine knowledge to all posterity; by which he has demonstrated
himself to have been not only an inspired divine, but also a deep
philosopher, obtaining his wisdom from God and heavenly things, and not
from man.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[150:1](ma255.htm#fr_14.md) The Cabalists of the
Hebrews affirm that Moses was this Hermes; and although meek, yet was a
man possessed of the most serious gravity, and a profound speculator in
chemistry and divine magic; that he by divine inspiration on the mount,
became acquainted with the knowledge of all the natural and secret
operations of nature; that he taught the transmutation of metals *per
Cabala*, *i. e.* by oral tradition, to the Jews.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[151:1](ma255.htm#fr_15.md) According to the best
authorities to be taken, Hermes Trismegistus lived in the time of
Pharaoh, Israel's tyrant and oppressor, and was not the same with Moses
who opposed Jannes and Jambres.
