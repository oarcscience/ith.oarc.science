### TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

SINCE the Oriental transcript of this work was imperfect in many parts,
the translation of it had to be taken according to the great original
book, on account of the purity of its text, and, therefore, it won for
itself the advantage of understanding and completing the exercises with
serenity and confidence. The translator, in the meantime believes, that
no one, who feels honestly called to these things, can ever be made the
subject of ill-fortune, or be deceived by the wiles and deceptions of
the old serpent, the inevitable fate that will and must fall to his lot
under any other exorcisms, and that he may cheerfully and safely move
thence. because only the angels of God will perform the service required
by Him.
