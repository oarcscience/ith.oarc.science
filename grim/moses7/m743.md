### EXTRACT FROM THE TRUE CLAVICULA OF SOLOMON AND THE GIRDLE OF AARON

This was bequeathed as a testament to all the wise magicians, which all
the old Fathers possessed and employed, to have and fulfill all things
through the illustrious power of the mighty God Jehovah, as He, the
great Monarch, gave to His creatures, who worship Him day and night with
reverence and fear, who call loudly upon His name in secret, and sigh to
Him as their origin, as of Him and from Him existing reasonable beings,
as on the point of being involved with the pains of the elements, who
strive after the highest being to and with God. To these He has given
this, who will not forget Him in the pleasures of this world, who, still
bearing suffering without forgetting the reality, nor the perishing
lustre of the world.
