### LAWS OF ENTRANCE

1\. Before you can enter the temple of consecrated light, you must
purify your soul and body during thirteen days.

2\. As a brother and disciple of the new covenant, or as a Christian,
you must receive the Holy Sacrament for the glorification of the three
kings--Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar.

3\. Three holy masses must be read as often as you make use of this book
in your priestly service with your intention fixed upon the three
glorified kings.

4\. You must provide yourself with a ram's horn, wherewith to call
together the angels and spirits. This horn must be included in your
intentions of the holy mass.

5\. You must wear a breastplate of parchment, ten inches high and ten
inches wide, inscribed with the names of the twelve apostles with the
five-fold name of Schemhamforasch, in the same order that it is placed
on the last leaf.

6\. You must draw a circle around you upon white paper, or upon sky blue
silk. Its circumference shall be thirteen feet, and at the distance of
each foot, one of the following names must be written: Moseh, Messias,
Aaron, Jehova, Adoni, Jesus, Christus, Caspar, Melchior, Balthasar. AI.
AI. AI.

7\. Between each name you must place the holy symbol of Horet:

8\. The breastplate must be included in the intention of the holy mass.

9\. Through consecration with holy three king's water and with three
burning wax tapers, you must finally pronounce a benediction over this
book, the horn, the breastplate, and the circle, after reading a
well-selected mysterious ritual.

10\. You may enter alone, or begin this great work with two companions,
by day or night, but always from the first to the thirteenth of the
month, and during the thirteenth day, and through the whole night of the
new moon, and also during the full moon, when the three planets, Saturn,
Mars and Jupiter, are visible in the heavens on the day of exorcism,
either singly or together.

11\. You must always stand with your face toward Zion, or toward the
rising of the sun.

12\. He who refuses a copy of this book, or who suppresses it or steals
it, will be seized with eternal trembling like Cain, and the angels of
god will depart from him.
