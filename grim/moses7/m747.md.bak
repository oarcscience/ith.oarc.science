### The Vestibule of Entrance

The language and manuscript of this rare and eternal monument of light,
and of a higher wisdom, are borrowed from the Cuthans, a tribe of the
Samaritans, who were called Cuthim in the Chaldee dialect according to
the Talmud, and they were so called in a spirit of derision. They were
termed sorcerers because they taught in Cutha, their original place of
abode, and afterward in Samaria, the Kabala or Higher Magic (Book of
Kings). Caspar, Melchior and Balthazar, the chosen archpriests, are
shining lights among the Eastern magicians. They were kings and
teachers--the first priest-teachers of this glorious knowledge--and from
these Samaritans-Cuthans, who were called Nergal according to the
traditions of the Talmud, originated the Gypsies, who, through
degeneracy, lost the consecration of their primordial powers.
