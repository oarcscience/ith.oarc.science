### BREASTPLATE OF MOSES

![](img/06100.jpg)

The Hebrew inscriptions within the seal are pronounced as follows:

JEHOVA, ASER EHEJE CETHER ELEION EHEJE

Their meaning is as follows:

The Most High, whom no eye hath seen, nor tongue spoke; the Spirit which
did great acts and performed great wonders. The Words of the Breastplate
and the Helmet pronounced mean Holiness.
