# Extract from the Magical Kabala

The Citation-Formulas contained in this book must only be pronounced in
the Hebrew language, and in no other. In any other language they have no
power whatever, and the Master can never be sure of their effects. For
all these words and forms were thus pronounced by the Great Spirit, and
have power only in the Hebrew language.
