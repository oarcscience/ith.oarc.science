# THE MYSTERY OF THE FOURTH SEAL

Seal of the Ministering Cherubim and Seraphim with their Characteristics

CONJURATION.

I, N.N., a servant of God, call upon thee, desire and conjure thee, O
Spirit Anoch, by the wisdom of Solomon, by the obedience of Isaac, by
the blessing of Abraham, by the piety of Jacob and Noe, who did not sin
before God, by the serpents of Moses, and by the twelve tribes, and by
the most terrible words: Dallia, Dollia, Dollion, Corfuselas, Jazy,
Agzy, Ahub, Tilli, Stago, Adoth, Suna, Eoluth, Alos, Jaoth, Dilu, and by
all the words through which thou canst be compelled to appear before me
in a beautiful, human form, and give what I desire. (This the conjuror
must name.)

The most obliging ministering Cherubim and Seraphim of this Seal, are
the following with their Hebrew calling: Anoch, Sewachar, Chaylon, Esor,
Yaron, Oseny, Yagelor, Ehym, Maakyel, Echad, Yalyon, Yagar, Ragat,
Ymmat, Chabalym, Schadym.

The special secret of this Seal is that to carry this Seal upon the body
will save a person from all misery, and give the greatest fortune and
long life.
