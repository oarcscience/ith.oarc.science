# THE MYSTERY OF THE FIFTH SEAL

Seal of the Angels of Power

CONJURATION

I, N.N., a servant of God, call upon thee, desire and conjure thee,
Spirit Scheol, through the most holy appearance in the flesh of Jesus
Christ, by his most holy birth and circumcision, by his sweating of
blood in the Garden, by the lashes he bore, by his bitter sufferings and
death, by his Resurrection, Ascension and the sending of the Holy Spirit
as a comforter, and by the most dreadful words: Dai, Deorum, Ellas,
genio Sophiel, Zophiel, Canoei, Elmiach, Richol, Hoamiach, Jerazol,
Vohal, Daniel, Hasios, Tomaisch, Sannul, Damamlach, Sanul, Damabiath,
and by those words through which thou canst be conquered, that thou
appear before me in a beautiful, human form, and fulfil what I desire.
(This must be named by the conjuror.)

The most serviceable Angels of Power are the following: Schoel, Hael,
Sephiroth, Thamy, Schamayl, Yeehah, Holyl, Yomelo, Hadlam, Mazbaz,
Elohaym.

The special secret of this Seal is that if this Seal be laid upon the
sick in full, true faith, it will restore him, if he has not lived the
full number of his days. Therefore, it is called the Seal of Power.
