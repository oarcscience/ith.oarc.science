### THE INVOCATION OF THE KING.

O THOU great, powerful, and mighty KING AMAIMON, who bearest rule by the
power of the SUPREME GOD EL over all spirits both superior and inferior
of the Infernal Orders in the Dominion of the East; I do invocate and
command thee by the especial and true name Of GOD; and by that God that
Thou Worshippest; and by the Seal of thy creation; and by the most
mighty and powerful name Of GOD, IEHOVAH TETRAGRAMMATON who cast

thee out of heaven with all other infernal spirits; and by all the most
powerful and great names of GOD who created Heaven, and Earth, and Hell,
and all things in them contained; and by their power and virtue; and by
the name PRIMEUMATON who commandeth the whole host of Heaven; that thou
mayest cause, enforce, and compel the Spirit N. to come unto me here
before this Circle in a fair and comely shape, without harm unto me or
unto any other creature, to answer truly and faithfully unto all my
requests; so that I may accomplish my will and desire in knowing or
obtaining any matter or thing which by office thou knowest is proper for
him to perform or accomplish, through the power of GOD, EL, Who created
and doth dispose of all things both celestial, aërial, terrestrial, and
infernal.

AFTER thou shalt have invocated the King in this manner twice or thrice
over, then conjure the spirit thou wouldst call forth by the aforesaid
conjurations, rehearsing them several times together, and he will come
without doubt, if not at the first or second time of rehearsing. But if
he do not come, add the "Spirits' Chain" unto the end of the aforesaid
conjurations, and he will be forced to come, even if he be bound in
chains, for the chains must break off from him, and he will be at
liberty:
