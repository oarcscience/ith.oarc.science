### YE GRETER CURSE.

Hearken to me, O ye Heavens! O thou Spirit N. because thou art the
disobedient one who is wicked and appearest not, speaking the secrets of
truth according to the, living breath; I, exalted in the power of God,
the All powerful, the center of the circle, powerful God who liveth,
whose end cannot be., Iehevohe Tetragrammaton,, the only creator of
heaven, earth, and dwelling of darkness and, all that is in their
palaces; who disposeth in secret wisdom of all things in darkness and
light: Curse thee and cast thee down and destroy thy seat, joy and
power, and I bind thee in the depths of Abaddon, to remain until the day
of judgment whose end cannot be, I say, unto the seas of fire and
sulphur which I have prepared for the wicked spirits that obey not; the
sons of iniquity.

Let the company of heaven curse thee!

Let the sun, moon, all the stars curse thee!

Let the light and all the Holy Ones of Heaven curse thee unto the
burning flame that liveth for ever, and unto the torment unspeakable!

And even as thy name and seal, which I have put in this dwelling of
poison, shall be in torment among creatures of sulphur and bitter sting,
burning in fire of earth, in them Iehevohe and exalted in power in these
three names, Tetragrammaton Anaphaxeton, Primeumaton, I cast thee down,
O wicked spirit N. unto the seas of fire and sulphur which are prepared
for the wicked spirits that obey not, the sons of iniquity, to remain
until the day of judgment; let the Mercies of God forget thee; let the
face of God forget the face of N. who

will not see light: let God forget, I say that shall be the balance of
justice over the sons of living breath and death and the world, by fire.
