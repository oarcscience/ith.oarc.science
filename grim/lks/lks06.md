### OBSERVATIONS.

FIRST, thou shalt know and observe the Moon's Age for thy working. The
best days be when the Moon Luna is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days old,
as Solomon saith; and no other days be profitable. The Seals of the 72
Kings are to be made in Metals. The Chief Kings' in Sol (Gold);
Marquises' in Luna (Silver); Dukes' in Venus (Copper); Prelacies' in
Jupiter (Tin); Knights' in Saturn (Lead) Presidents' in Mercury
(Mercury); Earls' in Venus (Copper), and Luna (Silver), alike equal,
etc. THESE 72 Kings be under the Power of AMAYMON, CORSON, ZIMIMAY or
