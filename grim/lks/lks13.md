### THE VESSEL OF BRASS.

THIS is the Form of the Vessel of Brass wherein King Solomon did shut up
the Evil Spirits, etc. (*See Figures* 158 <span id="img_fig158"></span>
[![](tn/generic.jpg)](img/fig158.jpg.md) and 159 <span
id="img_fig159"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)](img/fig159.jpg)..md)
(Somewhat different forms are given in

the various codices. The seal in Figure 160 <span
id="img_fig160"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)](img/fig160.jpg.md) was made
in brass to cover this vessel with at the top. This history of the genii
shut up in the brazen vessel by King Solomon recalls the story of "The
Fisherman and the Jinni" in "The Arabian Nights." In this tale, however,
there was only one jinni shut up in a vessel of yellow brass the which
was covered at the top with a leaden seal. This jinni tells the
fisherman that his name is Sakhr, or Sacar.)

(Colour.--Bronze. Letters.--Black on a red band.)
