### YE GENERALL CURSE.

###### YCLEPT YE SPIRITS' CHAYNE, AGAINST ALL SPIRITS YT REBELLE.

O thou wicket spirit N. that obeyeth not, because I made a law and
invoked the names of the glorious

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

and ineffable God of Truth, the creator of all, and thou obeyest not the
mighty sounds that I make: therefore I curse thee in the depth of
Abaddon to remain until the day of judgment in torment in fire and in
sulphur without end, until thou appear before our will and obey my
power. Come, therefore, in the 24th of a moment, before the circle in
the triangle in this name and by this name of God, Adni, Tzabaoth,
Adonai, Amioran. Come! Come! for it is the Lord of Lords Adni, that
stirreth thee up.
