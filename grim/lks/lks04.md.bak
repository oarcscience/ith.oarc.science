# PRELIMINARY DEFINITION OF MAGIC.

LEMEGETON VEL CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS.

MAGIC is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of
Natural Philosophy, <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) advanced in its
works and wonderful operations by a right understanding of the inward
and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) being applied to proper Patients, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md) strange and admirable effects will thereby
be produced. Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into
Nature; they, because of their skill, know how to anticipate an
effort, <span id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_9.md) the which to the vulgar shall
seem to be a miracle.

Origen saith that the Magical Art doth not contain anything subsisting,
but although it should, yet that it must not be Evil, or subject to
contempt or scorn; and doth distinguish the *Natural Magic* from that
which is *Diabolical*.

Apollonius Tyannaeus only exercised the *Natural Magic*, by the which he
did perform wonderful things.

Philo Hebraeus saith that true Magic, by which we do arrive at the
understanding of the Secret Works of Nature, is so far from being
contemptible that the greatest Monarchs and Kings have studied it. Nay!
among the Persians none might reign unless he was skilful in this GREAT
ART.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

This Noble Science often degenerateth, from *Natural* becometh
*Diabolical*, and from *True Philosophy* turneth unto
*Nigromancy*. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) The which is wholly to
be charged upon its followers, who, abusing or not being capable of that
High and Mystical Knowledge do immediately hearken unto the temptations
of *Sathan*, and are misled by him into the Study of the *Black Art*.
Hence it is that Magic lieth under disgrace, and they who seek after it
are vulgarly esteemed *Sorcerers*.

The Fraternity of the Rosie Crusians thought it not fit to style
themselves Magicians, but rather Philosophers. And they be not ignorant
Empiricks, <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) but learned and
experienced Physicians, whose remedies be not only Lawful but Divine.

### THE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION.

(N.B. This is taken from several MS. Codices, of which the four
principal variations are here composed together in parallel columns as
an example of the close agreement of the various texts of the Lemegeton.

For in the whole work the differences in the wording of the various
Codices are not sufficient to require the constant giving of parallel
readings; but except in the more ancient examples there is much
deterioration in the Seals and Sigils, so that in this latter respect
the more recent exemplars are not entirely reliable.)

### CLAVICULA SALOMONIS REGIS,

which containeth all the Names, Offices, and Orders of all the Spirits
that ever he had converse with, with the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Seals and Characters to each Spirit and the
manner of calling them forth to visible appearance:

In 5 parts, viz.:

\(1\) THE FIRST PART is a Book of Evil Spirits, called GOETIA, showing
how he bound up those Spirits, and used them in general things, whereby
he obtained great fame.

\(2\) THE SECOND PART is a Book of Spirits, partly Evil and partly Good,
which is named THEURGIA-GOETIA, all Aërial Spirits, etc.

\(3\) THE THIRD PART is of Spirits governing the Planetary Hours, and
what Spirits belong to every degree, of the Signs, and Planets in the
Signs. Called the PAULINE ART, etc.

\(4\) THE FOURTH PART of this Book is called ALMADEL or SOLOMON, which
containeth those Spirits which govern the Four Altitudes, or the 360
Degrees of the Zodiac.

These two last Orders of Spirits are Good, and to be sought for by
Divine seeking, etc., and are called THEURGIA.

\(5\) THE FIFTH PART is a Book of Orations and Prayers that Wise Solomon
used upon the Altar in the Temple. The which is called ARS NOVA, which
was revealed unto Solomon by that Holy Angel of God called MICHAEL; and
he also received many brief Notes written with the Finger of God, which
were declared to him by the said Angel with Claps of Thunder; without
which Notes King Solomon had never obtained his great knowledge, for by
them in a short time he knew all Arts and Sciences both Good and Bad;
from these Notes it is called the NOTARY ART, etc.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

### THE WHOLE LEMEGETON OR CLAVICULA.

Now this Book containeth all the Names, Orders, and Offices of all the
Spirits with which Solomon ever conversed, the Seals and Characters
belonging to each Spirit, and the manner of calling them forth to
visible appearance:

he acquire great renown.

\(2\) THE SECOND BOOK is one which treateth of Spirits mingled of Good
and Evil Natures, the which is entitled THE THEURGIA-GOETIA, or the

OF SOLOMON, concerneth those Spirits which be set over the Quaternary of
the Altitudes.

These two last mentioned Books, the ART PAULINE and the ART ALMADEL, do

through seeking unto the Divine. These two Books be also classed
together under the Name of the First and Second Parts of the Book
THEURGIA OF SOLOMON.

be titles with several other Names of the Book, as THE BOOK HELISOL,
which is the very same with this last Book of Lemegeton called ARS NOVA
or ARS NOTARIA, etc.

These Books were first found in the Chaldee and Hebrew Tongues at
Jerusalem by a Jewish Rabbi; and by him put into the Greek language and
thence into the Latin, as it is said.
