### YE CONJOURATIOUN OF YE FYRE.

I stir thee up, O thou fire, in him who is thy Creator and of all
creatures. Torment, burn, destroy the spirit N. always whose end cannot
be, I judge thee in judgment and in extreme justice, O spirit N.,
because thou art he that obeyeth not my power and obeyeth not that law
which the Lord God made, and obeyeth not the Mighty Sounds and the
Living Breath which I invoke, which I send: Come forth, I, who am the
Servant of the game Most High governor Lord God powerful, Iehovohe, I
who am exalted in power and am mighty in his power above ye, O thou who
comest not giving obedience and faith to him that liveth and triumpheth.
Therefore I say the judgment: I curse thee and destroy the name N. and
the seal N., which I have placed in this dwelling of poison, and I burn
thee in fire whose end cannot be; and I cast thee down unto the seas of
torment, out of which thou shalt not rise until thou come to my eyes:
visit me in peace: be friendly before the circle in the △ in the 24th of
a moment in the likeness of a man not unto the terror of the sons of men
the creatures or all things on the face of the earth. Obey my power

like reasoning creatures; obey the living breath, the law which I speak.
