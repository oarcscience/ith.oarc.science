PRELIMINARY INVOCATION.

Thee I invoke, the Bornless one.  
Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens:  
Thee that didst create the Night and the Day.  
Thee that didst create the Darkness and the Light.  
Thou art Osorronophris: Whom no man has seen at any time.  
Thou art Jäbas  
Thou art Jäpôs:  
Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust.  
Thou didst make the Female and the Male.  
Thou didst produce the Seed and the Fruit.  
Thou didst form Men to love one another, and to hate one another.

I am Mosheh Thy Prophet, unto Whom Thou didst commit Thy Mysteries, the
Ceremonies of Ishrael:  
Thou didst produce the moist and the, dry, and that which nourisheth all
created Life.  
Hear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of Paphrô Osorronophris: this is Thy
True Name, handed down to the Prophets of Ishrael.

\*\*\*\*

Hear Me:--  
Ar: Thiao: Rheibet: Atheleberseth:  
A: Blatha: Abeu: Ebeu: Phi:  
Thitasoe: Ib: Thiao.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Hear Me, and make all Spirits subject unto Me: so that every Spirit of
the Firmament and of the Ether; upon the Earth and under the Earth: on
dry Land and in the Water: of Whirling Air, and of rushing Fire: and
every Spell and Scourge of God may be obedient unto Me.

\*\*\*\*

I invoke Thee, the Terrible and Invisible God: Who dwellest in the Void
Place of the Spirit:--  
Arogogorobraô: Sothou:

Hear Me: etc.

Hear me:--  
Roubriaô: Mariôdam: Balbnabaoth: Assalonai: Aphniaô: I: Thoteth:

Hear me: etc.

I invoke thee:--  
    Ma: Barraiô: Jôêl: Kotha:

Hear Me: etc.

Hear me!  
Aôth: Abaôth: Basum: Isak:  
Sabaoth: Iao:

This is the Lord of the Gods:  
This is the Lord of the Universe:  
This is He Whom the Winds fear.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

This is He, Who having made Voice by His Commandment, is Lord of All
Things; King, Ruler and Helper.  
Hear Me, etc.

Hear Me:--

Adonaie: Ede: Edu: Angelos ton Theon: Aniaia Lai: Gaia: Ape: Diathanna
Thorun.

I am He! the Bornless Spirit! having sight in the feet: Strong, and the
Immortal Fire!  
I am He! the Truth!  
I am He! Who hate that evil should be wrought in the, World!  
I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth.  
I am He, from Whom is the Shower of the Life of Earth:  
I am He, Whose mouth ever flameth:  
I am He, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light:  
I am He; the Grace of the World:

"The Heart Girt with a Serpent" is My Name!

Come Thou forth, and follow Me: and make all Spirits subject unto Me so
that every Spirit of the Firmament, and of the Ether: upon the Earth and
under the Earth: on dry Land, or in the Water: of whirling Air or of
rushing Fire: and every Spell and Scourge of God, may be obedient unto
Me!

Iao: Sabao:

Such are the Words!
