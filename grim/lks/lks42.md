### YE LICENSE TO YE SPIRIT Y<sup>T</sup> HE MAYE DEPART.

O thou Spirit N. because thou art the servant of fealty and obedience,
and because thou art he that obeyeth my power and thy creation;
therefore I say Descend unto thy dwelling, obey the law which I have
made, without terror to the sons of men, creatures, all things upon the
surface of the earth.

Descend therefore I say, and be thou as stewards of Time; come forth in
a moment, even as servants that hearken to the voice of the Lord; in the
moment in which I invoke thee and stir thee up and move thee in the,
mysteries of the secret wisdom of the Creator!

Descend unto thy dwelling place in pleasure: let there be the mercies of
God upon thee: be friendly in continuing; whose long continuance shall
be comforters unto all creatures. Amen.
