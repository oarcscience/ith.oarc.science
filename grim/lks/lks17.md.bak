### THE CONJURATION TO CALL FORTH ANY OF THE AFORESAID SPIRITS.

I DO invocate and conjure thee, O Spirit, N. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md); and being with power armed from the
SUPREME MAJESTY, I do strongly command thee, by BERALANENSIS,
BALDACHIENSIS, PAUMACHIA, and APOLOGIAE SEDES; by the most Powerful
Princes, Genii, Liachidæ, and Ministers of the Tartarean Abode; and by
the Chief Prince of the Seat of Apologia in the Ninth Legion, I do
invoke thee, and by invocating conjure thee. And being armed with power
from the SUPREME MAJESTY, I do strongly command thee, by Him Who spake
and it was done, and unto whom all creatures be obedient. Also I, being
made after the image of GOD, endued with power from GOD and created
according unto His will, do exorcise thee by that most mighty and
powerful name of GOD, EL, strong and wonderful; O thou Spirit N. And I
command thee and Him who spake the Word and His FIAT was accomplished,
and by all the names of God. Also by the names ADONAI, EL, ELOHIM,
ELOHI, EHYEH, ASHER EHYEH, ZABAOTH, ELION, IAH, TETRAGRAMMATON, SHADDAI,
LORD GOD MOST HIGH, I do exorcise thee and do powerfully command thee, O
thou Spirit N., that thou dost forthwith

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

appear unto me here before this Circle in a fair human shape, without
any deformity or tortuosity. And by this ineffable name, TETRAGRAMMATON
IEHOVAH, do I command thee, at the which being heard the elements are
overthrown, the air is shaken, the sea runneth back, the fire is
quenched, the earth trembleth, and all the hosts of the celestials,
terrestrials, and infernals, do tremble together, and are troubled and
confounded. Wherefore come thou, O Spirit N., forthwith, and without
delay, from any or all parts of the world wherever thou mayest be, and
make rational answers unto all things that I shall demand of thee. Come
thou peaceably, visibly, and affably, now, and without delay,
manifesting that which I shall desire. For thou art conjured by the name
of the LIVING and TRUE GOD, HELIOREN, wherefore fulfil thou my commands,
and persist thou therein unto the end, and according unto mine interest,
visibly and affably speaking unto me with a voice clear and intelligible
without any ambiguity.

REPEAT this conjuration as often as thou pleasest, and if the Spirit
come not yet, say as followeth:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_32"></span>[56:1](lks17.htm#fr_32.md) Here interpolate the
name of the Spirit desired to be invocated. In some of the Codices there
are faint variations in the form of wording of the conjurations, but not
sufficient to change the sense, e. g., "Tartarean abode" for "Tartarean
seat," etc.
