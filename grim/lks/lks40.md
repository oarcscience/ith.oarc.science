### YE ADDRESSE UNTO YE SPIRIT ON HYS COMING.

Behold! I confound thee as thou art he that obeys not! Behold the
mysteries of the seal of Solomon which I bring forth unto thy power and
presence! Behold the creator, the centre of the circle of the living
breath; he that is exalted in the power of God and shall not see unto
the terror: he that powerfully invoketh and stirreth thee up unto
visible appearance: he, the lord of thy governments whose Name is called
Octinomos.

Obey, therefore, my power as a reasoning creature -in the name of the
Lord.
