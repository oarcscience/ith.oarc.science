### THE GENERAL CURSE, CALLED THE SPIRITS' CHAIN, AGAINST ALL SPIRITS THAT REBEL.

O THOU wicked and disobedient spirit N., because thou hast rebelled, and
hast not obeyed nor regarded my words which I have rehearsed; they being
all glorious and incomprehensible names of the true GOD, the maker and

creator of thee and of me, and of all the world; I DO by the power of
these names the which no creature is able to resist, curse thee into the
depth of the Bottomless Abyss, there to remain unto the Day of Doom in
chains, and in fire and brimstone unquenchable, unless thou forthwith
appear here before this Circle, in this triangle to do my will. And,
therefore, come thou quickly and peaceably, in and by these names of
GOD, ADONAI, ZABAOTH, ADONAI, AMIORAN; come thou! come thou! for it is
the King of Kings, even ADONAI, who commandeth thee.

WHEN thou shalt have rehearsed thus far, but still be cometh not, then
write thou his seal on parchment and put thou it into a strong black
box; <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35) with brimstone, assafœtida, and
such like things that bear a stinking smell; and then bind the box up
round with an iron wire, and bang it upon the point of thy sword, and
hold it over the fire of charcoal; and say as followeth unto the fire
first, it being placed toward that quarter whence the Spirit is to come:

evidently be in metal or in something which does not take fire easily.
