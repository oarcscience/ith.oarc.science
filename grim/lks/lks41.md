### YE WELCOME UNTO Y<sup>E</sup> SPIRIT DYGNYTIE.

I am he that is looking with gladness upon thee, O thou spirit . . . N.
beautiful and praiseworthy! with gladness I say, because thou art called
in him who is creator of Heaven and earth and the dwelling of darkness,
and all things that are in their palaces, and because thou art the
servant of obedience. In these the power by which thou art obedient to
the living breath, I bind thee to remain visible to our eyes in power
and presence as the servant of fealty before the circle until I say
"Descend unto thy dwelling" until the living breath of the voice of the
Lord is according to the law which shall be given unto thee.

-------------

By the seal of the secret wisdom of Solomon thou art called!

Obey the mighty sounds! obey the living breath of the voice of the Lord!

Follows ye charge.
