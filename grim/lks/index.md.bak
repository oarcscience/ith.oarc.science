# The Lesser Key of Solomon

S.L. MacGregor Mathers and Aleister Crowley

## \[1904\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This edition of the Lesser Key of Solomon is based on manuscripts from
the British Museum, edited by two prominent occultists. Although Mathers
took lead on the body of the text, Crowley's literary fingerprints are
all over this book, such as the polite sniping at A.E. Waite, the
Preliminary Invocation, and the essay The Initiated Interpretation of
Ceremonial Magic, which is classic Crowley.

This is a considerably cleaned up and modernized version of the Lesser
Key, which is obviously intended to be used as a working document for
serious magicians, rather than a rigorous transcription of the source
manuscripts. However, the information presented here dovetails with the
other Goetic grimoires and this version is considered one of the best of
this literature.
