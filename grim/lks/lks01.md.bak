# PREFACE

This translation of the FIRST BOOK of the "*Lemegeton*" which is now for
the first time made accessible to students of TALISMANIC MAGIC was done,
after careful collation and edition, from numerous *Ancient Manuscripts*
in *Hebrew, Latin*, and *French*, by G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F., by the order
of the *Secret Chief* of the *Rosicrucian Order*. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) The G. H. Fra., having succumbed unhappily
to the assaults of the *Four Great Princes* (acting notably under
Martial influences), it seemed expedient that the work should be brought
to its conclusion by another hand. The investigation of a competent
Skryer into the house of our unhappy *Fra*., confirmed this divination;
neither our *Fra*. nor his *Hermetic Mul*. were there seen; but only the
terrible shapes of the evil *Adepts* S.V.A. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) and H., whose original bodies having

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

been sequestered by Justice, were no longer of use to them. On this we
stayed no longer Our Hand; but withdrawing Ourselves, and consulting the
Rota, and the Books M. and Q. did decide to ask Mr. Aleister Crowley, a
poet, and skilled student of *Magical Lore*, and an expert *Kabbalist*,
to complete openly that which had been begun in secret. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) This is that which is written: "His
Bishoprick let another take." And again: "*Oculi Tetragammaton*." This
is also that which is said: "Nomen Secundum refertur ad *Gebhurah*; qui
est Rex *Bittul* atque Corruptio *Achurajim Patris et Matris* hoc
indigitatur."

And so saying we wish you well.

Ex Deo Nascimur.  
In Jesu Morimur.  
Per S.S. Reviviscimus.

Given forth from our Mountain of A.,

this day of C.C. 1903 A. D.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[3:1](lks01.htm#fr_0.md) Mr. A. E. Waite writes
("Real History Of The Rosicrucians," p. 426): "I beg leave to warn my
readers that all persons who proclaim themselves to be Rosicrucians are
simply members of pseudo-fraternities, and that there is that difference
between their assertion and the fact of the case in which the essence of
a lie consists!" It is within the *Editor's* personal knowledge that Mr.
Waite was (and still is probably) a member of a society claiming to be
the R.C. fraternity As *Mr. Waite* constantly hints in his writing that
he is in touch with initiated centres, I think the *syllogism*, whose
premises are given above, is fair, if not quite formal.--ED.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[3:2](lks01.htm#fr_1.md) It was owing to our *Fra*.
receiving this S.V.A. as his Superior, and giving up the *Arcana* of our
*Fraternity* into so unhallowed a power, that We decided no longer to
leave Our dignity and authority in the hands of one who could be thus
easily imposed upon. (For by a childish and easy magical trick did
S.V.A. persuade D.D.C.F. of that lie.)

<span id="fn_2"></span>[4:1](lks01.htm#fr_2.md) He that is appointed to
complete in secret that which had been begun openly is R.R., and to be
heard of at the care of the Editor.
