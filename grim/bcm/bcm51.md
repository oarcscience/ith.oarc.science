# CHAPTER III

## Concerning the Descending Hierarchy

### § 1. The Names and Offices of Evil Spirits

IN all matters of ceremonial the inspiration of the Grimoires must be
sought in the *Key of Solomon* proper, but for the names and offices of
the demons it must be sought in the *Lesser Key*. The hierarchy,
according to the *Lemegeton*, with its accompanying evoking processes,
will be given in the fourth chapter, as there is no special reason for
separating it from the practical context. I shall therefore deal in this
place with the simpler though later summaries, which will prevent these
curious issues from being confused.

The *Book of True Black Magic*, like its prototype the original
*Clavicle*, gives no account of the nature of the Spirits with which it
professes to deal, and, as already seen, it breaks off abruptly at the
point where the conjuring formulae should follow to complete the work.
This *Secret of Secrets*, as the Grimoires term the methods for raising
and discharging spirits, being omitted, it may now be dismissed from
consideration till we come to the minor processes of Ceremonial Magic,
chiefly venereal and fantastic, which are grouped in the eighth chapter.

The *Grimoire of Honorius* mentions by name four kings, referred to the
cardinal points, and seven lesser spirits to be invoked on the days of
the week, but as will appear later on, there is no explicit notice of
the Descending Hierarchy. These

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

deficiencies are supplied by the *Grimorium Verum* and the *Grand
Grimoire*.

As regards spirits, says the former, some are superior and others
inferior. The three superior are Lucifer, Beelzebuth and Astaroth.
According to the latter, Lucifer is Emperor; Beelzebuth, Prince; and
Astaroth, Grand Duke. They must be invoked by means of the characters
which they themselves have made known, and these characters must be
written with the blood of the operator, or with that of a sea-tortoise.
Failing this, they may be engraved on an emerald or ruby, for both these
stones have great sympathy with spirits, especially with those of the
solar race, who are wiser,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

better and more friendly than the rest. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) The character must be worn upon the
person; in the case of a male, it should be placed in the right pocket,
but a female must carry it between the breasts, towards the left side,
like a reliquary. It should be graven or written on the day and in the
hour of Mars for both sexes, and apparently in the case of each of the
three spirits.

The lord commands the servants, so the Grimoire proceeds, and these
three spirits can do all things. But the operator is advised that he
shall obey those who obey him, because the exalted and powerful spirits
serve only their confidants and intimate friends. He is further grimly
warned to keep upon his guard lest any spirit should seize him unawares.
Each of the rulers has two chief officers, who announce to the subjects
all things which their lord hath commanded throughout the world, and
ordain all that is to be done. The inferiors of Lucifer are *Put
Satanachia* and *Agaliarept*; they inhabit Europe and Asia. Those of
Beelzebuth are *Tarchimache* and *Fleurety*; they dwell in Africa. Those
of Astaroth are *Sargatanas* and *Nebiros*, whose asylum is America, so
that this kind of Magic is presumably post-Columbian.

The *Grand Grimoire* does not distribute the six subordinate spirits
among three rulers, but enumerates them somewhat differently, together
with their dignities, as follows: <span
id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_159.md)--

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE.--Prime Minister.

SATANACHIA.--Commander-in-Chief.

AGALIAREPT.--Another Commander.

FLEURETY.--Lieutenant-General.

SARGATANAS.--Brigadier-Major.

NEBIROS.--Field-Marshal and Inspector-General.

It will be seen that the principalities of Infernus are chiefly
represented in the light of a standing army, yet their interference in
earthly matters is not of a military kind. LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE has the
control, with which Lucifer has invested him, over all the wealth and
treasures of the world. His subordinates are *Baal*, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) *Agares* <span
id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) and Marbas. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_162.md) The grand SATANACHIA has the power of
subjecting all wives and maidens to his wishes, and of doing with them
as he wills. His subordinates are *Pruslas*, *Aamon* <span
id="fr_164"></span>[4](#fn_163.md) and *Barbatos*. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[5](#fn_164.md) AGALIAREPT has the faculty of
discovering arcane secrets in all the courts and council-chambers of the
world; he also unveils the most sublime mysteries. He commands the
Second Legion of Spirits, and his subordinates are *Buer*, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[6](#fn_165.md) *Gusoyn* <span
id="fr_167"></span>[7](#fn_166.md) and *Botis*. <span
id="fr_168"></span>[8](#fn_167.md) FLEURETY has the power to perform any
labour during the night and to cause hailstones

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

in any required place. He controls a prodigious army of spirits, and has
*Bathsin* <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168) (or *Bathim*.md), *Pursan*
and *Eligor* <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_169.md) as his subordinates.
SARGATANAS has the power to make any person invisible, to transport him
anywhere, to open all locks, to reveal whatsoever is taking place in
private houses, to teach all the arts of the shepherds. He commands
several Brigades of Spirits, and has *Zoray*, *Valefar* and *Faraii* for
his immediate inferiors. NEBIROS has the power to inflict evil on
whomsoever he will; he discovers the Hand of Glory and reveals every
virtue of metals, minerals, vegetables, as also of all animals, both
pure and impure. He possesses the art of predicting things to come,
being one of the greatest Necromancers in all the Infernal Hierarchies;
he goes to and fro everywhere and inspects the hordes of perdition. His
immediate subordinates are *Ayperos*, *Naberrs* and *Glassyalabolas*.

It is added that there are millions of other spirits in subjection to
those which have been mentioned, but their enumeration serves no
purpose, as they are required only when it pleases the superiors to
employ them in their own place, for the latter make use of all the
inferior Intelligences like workmen or slaves.

The *Grimorium Verum*, however, mentions seventeen of the most important
subordinate spirits, who seem to correspond with the ministers of the
six great leaders mentioned above, but there is little unanimity among
makers of magical rituals, whether white or black.

CHARACTER OF HUICTIIGARA

HUICTIIGARA occasions sleep and waking in some, and afflicts others with
insomnia.

SATANACHIA and SATANICÆ govern forty-five, or, as some say, fifty-four
demons, four of whom are *Sergutthy, Heramael, Trimasel* and
*Sustugriel*. Two of these rank as chief. The rest are of no great
importance.

These are serviceable spirits, who act easily and quickly, provided that
they are content with the operator. *Sergutthy* has power over wives and
virgins, when the occasion is favourable. *Heramael* teaches the art of
medicine, gives absolute knowledge of all diseases, with their full and
radical cure, makes known all plants in general, the places where they
grow, the times of their gathering, their virtues also and their
composition for the attainment of a perfect cure. *Trimasel* teaches
chemistry and all sleight of hand. He imparts the

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

true secret for confecting the powder of projection which changes
imperfect metals--lead, iron, pewter, copper and quicksilver--into true
good silver and good gold, namely, Sun and Moon, according to the
ferment thereof. Only he must be satisfied with the operator, if the
operator would be satisfied with him. *Sustugriel* teaches magical art;
he gives familiar spirits for all things that can be desired, and
furnishes mandragores.

Agalierept and *Tarihimal* govern *Elelogap*, whose power is over water.
The two *Nebirots* rule *Hael* and *Sergulath*. *Hael* instructs in the
art of writing all kinds of letters, gives an immediate power of
speaking all kinds of tongues and explains the most secret things.
*Sergulath* furnishes every manner of speculation, teaches tactics and
the breaking of hostile ranks. They have eight powerful inferiors. 1.
*Proculo*, who gives sleep for twenty-four hours, with knowledge of the
spheres of sleep. 2. *Haristum*, who gives the power of passing unsinged
through the fire. 3. *Brulefer*, who makes one loved by women. 4.
*Pentagonony*, who renders invisible and also beloved by great lords. 5.
*Aglasis*, who transports through the whole world. 6. *Sidrargrosam*,
who makes girls dance stark naked, 7. *Minoson*, who insures winning in
all games. 8. *Bucon*, who has the power to excite hatred and jealousy
between the two sexes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_158"></span>[186:1](bcm51.htm#fr_159.md) The attribution is
somewhat confused; the ruby is a solar stone, but Albertus Parvus
attributes the emerald to the Moon, which would establish its connection
with evocation.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[186:2](bcm51.htm#fr_160.md) The Hierarchy
