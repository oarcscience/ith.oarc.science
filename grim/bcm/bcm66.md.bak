UNIVERSAL CONJURATION

I, N., do conjure thee, O Spirit N., by the living God., by the true
God., by the holy and all-ruling God, Who created from nothingness the
heaven, the earth, the sea and all things that are therein., in virtue
of the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, in the name of Jesus
Christ, and by the power of this same Almighty Son of God, Who for us
and for our redemption was crucified, suffered death and was buried; Who
rose again on the third day and is now seated on the right hand of the
Creator of the whole world. from whence He will come to judge the,
living and the dead; as also by the Precious love of the Holy Spirit,
Perfect Trinity. I conjure thee within the circle, accursed one, by thy
judgment, who didst dare to tempt God: I exorcise thee, Serpent, and I
command thee to appear forthwith under a beautiful and well-favoured
human form of soul and body, and to fulfil my behests without any deceit
whatsoever,

thee, Evil and Accursed Serpent, N., to appear at my will and pleasure,
in this place, before this circle, without tarrying, without companions,
without grievance, without noise, deformity or murmuring. I exorcise
thee by the ineffable Names of God, to wit, Gog and Magog, which I am
unworthy to pronounce: Come hither, Come hither, Come hither. Accomplish
my will and desire, without wile or falsehood. Otherwise St. Michael,
the invisible Archangel, shall presently blast thee in the utmost depths
of hell. Come, then, N., to do my will*.
