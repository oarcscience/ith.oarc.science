LII\. ALLOCEN, <span id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_234.md) a strong duke,
appears in the form of a soldier, mounted on a great horse, his face
like that of a lion, exceedingly red, his eyes flaming fire, his speech
hoarse and loud. He teaches astronomy and the liberal sciences, and
gives a good familiar.

LIII\. CAIM, a great president, appears in the form of a thrush, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_235.md) but afterwards in that of a man bearing
a sharp sword and seeming--as it is said fantastically--to answer in
burning ashes. He is a keen disputant; he imparts to men the
understanding of birds' songs, the lowing of cattle, the barking of dogs
and the voice of waters. He gives true answers concerning things to come
and was once of the Order of Angels.

LIV\. MURMUR, a great duke and earl, appears in the form of a soldier,
riding on a griffin and having a duke's crown on

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

his head. He is preceded by two ministers sounding trumpets. He teaches
philosophy perfectly; he constrains the souls of the dead to appear and
to answer questions. He was partly of the Order of Thrones and partly of
Angels.

LV\. OROBAS, a great prince, appears first like a horse but, when
commanded, in human form. He discovers past, present and future; he
gives good dignities and advancements, with the favour of friends and
foes; he will reply concerning the creation of the world and Divinity;
he is very faithful to the exorcist and defends him from temptation by
any spirit.

LVI\. GOMORY, a powerful duke, appears like a beautiful woman, wearing a
ducal crown. <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_236.md) He discovers past,
present and future, as also the whereabouts of hidden treasures; he
procures the love of women and especially of girls.

LVII\. OSE, a great president, appears at first like a leopard

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

and then in human shape. He gives skill in all liberal sciences and true
answers concerning divine and secret things. He can change men into any
shape that the exorcist may desire, and he that is changed will not know
it. <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_237.md)

THE SEAL OF AMY

LVIII\. AMY, a great president, comes first as a great flaming fire and
then as a man. He gives perfect knowledge of astrology and the liberal
sciences, with good familiars, and can betray treasures that are kept by
spirits. <span id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_238.md)

THE SEAL OF ORIAS

LIX\. ORIAS, a great marquis, appears in the form of a

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

lion bestriding a strong horse; he has a serpent's tail and holds two
enormous, hissing snakes in his right hand. He teaches the virtues of
the planets and the mansions thereof; he transforms men, gives
dignities, prelacies and confirmations, with the favour of friends and
foes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[212:2](bcm59.htm#fr_235.md) Otherwise, *Alloien*
and *Allocer*.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[212:3](bcm59.htm#fr_236.md) Or of a blackbird.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[213:1](bcm59.htm#fr_237.md) And riding on a camel
(Wierus).

<span id="fn_237"></span>[214:1](bcm59.htm#fr_238.md) He can also reduce
them to such a state of insanity that they will believe their identity
changed, that they are kings and so forth. The delusion, however, will
only endure for one hour (Wierus).

<span id="fn_238"></span>[214:2](bcm59.htm#fr_239.md) He is partly of the
Order of the Angels and partly of that of the Powers. He hopes to return
to the Seventh Thrones in 1200 years, which is incredible, says Wierus.
