# CHAPTER IV

## The Mysteries of Goëtic Theurgy according to the Lesser Key of Solomon the King

### §1 Concerning the Spirits of the Brazen Vessel, otherwise called the False Monarchy of Demons

THE Goëtic Art of Solomon <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_172) gives
instructions for the evocation of the seventy-two spirits whom the King
of Israel, according to a well-known legend, shut up in a brass vessel
and cast into a deep lake. When the vessel was discovered by the
Babylonians, it was supposed to contain a great treasure and was
accordingly broken open. The spirits who were thus set at liberty,
together with their legions, returned to their former places, Belial

people of the country in return for sacrifices and divine honours, by

inquiry, admits of reduction into a manageable compass by the omission
of tiresome and egregious particulars as to the number of spirits who
are subject to a particular Lord, Prince or Emperors and are liable to
appear in his company. It should be understood in a general way that
there are hundreds and thousands and millions, according to the dignity
of the hierarch; they must have been a source of considerable
inconvenience, and even of dismay, to the operator!
