### § 2. True Black Magic

The Grimoire entitled *True Black Magic* is simply an adapted version of
the *Key of Solomon*, with the same preambles, the same ritual, the same
talismans, and characters which are analogous when they are not
identical. With the moderately intelligible and religiously careful
presentation of Mr. Mathers it of course compares very badly; like the
*Grimorium Verum*, it is exceedingly confused, and is rendered almost
unmeaning by the omission of all the practical part. Its malicious or
diabolical element consists, however, more especially in its
introduction of the chapter upon works of hatred and' destruction,
which, as already seen, and as more fully established later on, should
undoubtedly be regarded as an integral portion of the original work.
