### § 2. Concerning the Genuine Sanctum Regnum, or the True Method of Making Pacts

There are two kinds of pacts, says the Grimorium Verum, the tacit and
the manifest; but know at the same time that among the several kinds of
spirits there are some which bind and some which do not bind, save only
in a very light manner. As to the first, they are those which require
something personally belonging to you whensoever a pact is agreed.
Against these you must be on your guard, because the guileful friend
becometh an open enemy. <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_250.md) The
Grimorium Verum does not,

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

however, entertain more largely the question of a compact with Satan or
his ministers, though it may perhaps be inferred from its pages that all
commerce with evil spirits is founded on a law of exchange. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) They can be bent to the intention of the
operator, but it is on the express understanding that they are satisfied
for their part, because, as we have seen, these kinds of creatures give
nothing for nothing.

With the author of the *Grand Grimoire*, the pact is a concession to the
poverty of the operator's resources. In Black Magic, as in some other
processes, the necessitous must be ready to sacrifice, and the sorcerer
who is insufficiently equipped must pay a higher price in the end. The
genuine *Sanctum Regnum* of the Grand Clavicle, otherwise termed the
*Pacta Conventa Dæmonum*, is explained by the *Grand Grimoire* for the
information of those who are desirous to bind spirits, but are devoid of
the requisite resources for composing the Blasting Rod and Kabalistic
circle. Such persons, it is affirmed, will never succeed in evoking
spirits unless they perform, point by point, all that is detailed
hereinafter concerning the manner of making pacts with any spirit
whatsoever, whether the object in view may be the possession of
treasures concealed in the earth, the enjoyment of women or girls, and
for obtaining any desired favour at their hands, whether for the
discovery of the most hidden secrets in all Courts and Cabinets of the
world, whether for the revelation of the most impenetrable mysteries,
whether for engaging a spirit to perform one's work in the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

night, whether to cause a fall of hail or a storm in any appointed
place, whether to open seals, to behold what is passing in private
houses and learn all the skill of the shepherds, whether to obtain the
Hand of Glory and discern all the qualities and virtues of metals,
minerals and vegetables, of animals both pure and impure, and "to
perform things so astounding that no person in existence can fail to be
in a condition of utter bewilderment on seeing that by means of a pact
with certain spirits one can discover the grandest secrets of Nature,
which are hidden from the eyes of all other men."

It is to the Clavicle of the great King Solomon, says the Grimoire, that
we owe the discovery of the genuine method of making pacts, which he
also made use of himself for the acquisition of his immense riches, for
the pleasure of such innumerable women and for the revelation of the
most impenetrable arcana of Nature, whereby every species of good and
evil may be accomplished.

With the highest potentates of Infernus, with Lucifer, Beelzebuth and
Astaroth, it does not seem possible to enter into a binding compact. The
sorcerer must be content with some one among the six governors, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) who will generally work by their agents.
An invariable covenant of the pact should bargain for service by one of
the three superiors among such special subordinates.

Having determined to make a pact, continues the *Grand Grimoire*, you
must begin on the previous evening by cutting with a new and unused
knife a rod of wild hazel, which has never borne fruit and shall be
similar to the Blasting Rod, as it has been previously described.

This must be done precisely at the moment when the sun appears upon our
horizon. The same being accomplished, arm

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

yourself with the stone called Ematille and with two blessed candles,
and proceed to select a place for the coming operation where you will be
wholly undisturbed; you may even make the pact in some isolated room, or
in some subterranean part of an old ruinous castle, for the spirit has
the power to transport the treasure--or, presumably, one of its
alternatives--to any required place.

This having been duly fulfilled, describe a triangle with the stone
called *Ematille*--which is exclusively needed on the first occasion of
making a pact.

Then set the two blessed candles in a parallel position on either side
of the Triangle of Pacts, inscribing the Holy Name of Jesus below, so
that no spirits can injure you after any manner. You may now take up
your position in the middle of the triangle, holding the mysterious rod,
together with the grand Conjuration of the Spirit, the Clavicle, the
written Requisition which you mean to make and the Discharge of the
Spirit.

Having exactly fulfilled what things soever have been above described,
begin by reciting the following Conjuration with decision and
hopefulness:--

GRAND CONJURATION OF SPIRITS WITH WHOM IT IS SOUGHT TO MAKE A PACT

Taken from the Grand Clavicle

Emperor Lucifer, Master of all the revolted Spirits, I entreat thee to
favour me in the adjuration which I address to thy mighty minister,
LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE*, being desirous to make a pact with him. I beg thee
also, O Prince Beelzebuth, to protect me in my undertaking. O Count
Astarôt! be propitious to me, and grant that to-night the great*
LUCIFUGE

may appear to me

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

under a human form, free from, evil smell, and that he may accord me, in
virtue of the pact which I propose to enter into, all the riches that I
need. O grand LUCIFUGE*, I pray thee to quit thy dwelling, wheresoever
it may be, and come hither to speak with me; otherwise will I compel
thee by the power of the strong living God, His beloved Son and the Holy
Spirit. Obey promptly, or thou shalt be eternally tormented by the Power
of the Potent words in the grand Clavicle of Solomon, wherewith he was
accustomed to compel the rebellious spirits to receive his compact. Then
straightway appear, or I will persistently torture thee by the virtue of
these great words in the Clavicle*.

AGLON, TETRAGRAM, VAYCHEON STIMULAMATON EZPHARES RETRAGRAMMATON OLYARAM
IRION ESYTION EXISTION ERYONA ONERA ORASYM MOZM MESSIAS SOTER EMANUEL
SABAOTH ADONAY, *te adoro, et te invoco*. AMEN.

You may rest assured that the recitation of these potent words will be
followed by the appearance of the spirit, who will say:--

Manifestation of the Spirit

Lo . I am here! What dost thou seek of me? Why dost thou disturb my
repose? Answer me.

LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE

Reply to the Spirit

It is my wish to make a Pact with thee, so as to obtain wealth at thy
hands immediately, failing which I will torment thee by the potent words
of the Clavicle.

The Spirit's Reply

I cannot comply with thy request except thou dost give thyself

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

over to me in twenty years, to do with thy body and soul as I please.

LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE

Thereupon throw him your pact, which must be written with your own hand
on a sheet of virgin parchment; it should be worded as follows, and
signed with your own blood:--*I Promise the grand* LUCIFUGE

to reward him in twenty years' time for all treasures that he may give
me. In witness whereof I have signed myself

N.N.

Reply of the Spirit

I cannot grant thy request.

LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE

In order to enforce his obedience, again recite the Supreme Appellation,
with the terrible words of the Clavicle, till the spirit reappears, and
thus addresses you:--

Of the Spirit's Second Manifestation

Why dost thou torment me further? Leave me to rest, and I will confer
upon thee the nearest treasure, on condition that thou dost set apart
for me one coin on the first Monday of each month, and dost not call me
oftener than once a week, to wit, between ten at night and two in the
morning. Take up thy pact; I have signed it. Fail in thy promise, and
thou shalt be, mine at the end of twenty years.

LUCIFUGE ROFOCALE

Reply to the Spirit

I agree to thy request, subject to the delivery of the nearest treasure
which I can at once carry away.

Follow the spirit without fear, cast your pact upon the hoard, touch it
with your rod, remove as much as you can, return into the triangle,
walking backwards, place the treasure

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

in front of you, and recite the Discharge of the Spirit, as given in the
preceding Rite.

It will be seen from the wording of the compact that it is designedly
evasive and the final response of the supposed spirit seems to recognise
that it can obtain only by neglect on the part of the sorcerer. But if
there are Courts of judgment in the nethermost world, the sorcerer might
find a certain difficulty in arguing such a case with the *advocatus
diaboli*. Lucifer and his deputies are accredited with an awkward skill
in getting possession of the defendant when the time of the pact
expires. There were apparently more binding contracts, and better ways
of over-riding them, for in the year 1678 the Abbé Eynatton published a
*Manual of Exorcisms* which contains the following formal process for
forcing the Demon to return any writing which constitutes an agreement
with him:--

EXORCISM

O most merciful God, Whose Power hath no limit, Whose dominion is
supreme over all beings, so that nothing can possibly be estreated from
Thy rule by apostasy; behold, we have sinned against Thee, we have
provoked Thy most just wrath, when we have failed to obey Thy commands,
above all when., forsaking Thy rule and Thy friendship, we have abjured
Thee and have consorted with the impious demons, nor yet contented with
Thy denial, have bound ourselves in writing to those demons,
surrendering the document of our voluntary obligation against Thee into
their custody. But Thy mercies aye without number, O Lord of
loving-kindness, and it is Thine to spare and to Pardon; look,
therefore, with compassion upon this Thy creature, who, having formerly
denied Thee and given himself in writing to the demons, but now, having
returned to himself by the help

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

of Thine infinite goodness, doth abhor his impiety, doth desire to be
restored unto Thee his true Lord, and to be received with contrite heart
into Thy favour. We know, O Lord, that a contrite and humble heart Thou
wilt not despise, nor can any writing be an impediment in the way of Thy
mercy; we beseech Thee, therefore, that, by the abundance of Thy
clemency, not only may the heinousness of this sin be blotted out with
the Blood of Thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ, but that the demon, by the
word of Thy Power, may be compelled to restore the deed and obligation
and delivery, lest he glory in his tyranny and Pretend to any right over
the man whom we pray to be delivered through Thy Son from his bonds.
Through the same Jesus Christ, Thy Son, our Lord, &c.

The propitiation of offended Deity is followed by a citation of the
demon who is required to disgorge his prey.

EXORCISM

I exorcise thee, O impious Satan, who, when thy power has passed away,
dost still pretend to impose a tyrant yoke on man. I exorcise thee by
Jesus Christ, Who came into this world for the salvation of sinners; I
conjure thee to remove thy yoke immediately from this creature, who,
deceived by thy wiles, formerly delivered himself unto thee. Abandoning
thee henceforth, he commits himself to the Divine mercy, seeking His
service unto Whom he alone is owing, Who also promises the reward of
eternal life to those who follow Him. I exorcise thee by the precious
Blood of Jesus Christ, by which the deed of judgment against us hath
been blotted out, so that when Jesus receiveth the sinner into His
favour, thou shalt dare not to advance anything against him, and shalt
not fail to restore the deed by which this creature bound himself unto
thee, the same being now cancelled by the Blood of Jesus Christ.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

Hear, therefore, accursed Satan, who art powerless over a servant of
God, when, encouraged by his true Lord, he turneth unto another service;
in vain dost thou boast of this deed; I command thee to restore it in
the name of the Lord, as a Proof before the whole world that when God
receiveth a sinner, thou hast no longer any Yule over his soul. I abjure
thee, by Him who expelled thee from thy stronghold, bereft thee of the
arms which thou didst trust in and distributed thy spoils. Return
therefore this deed, whereby this creature of God foolishly bound
himself to thy service; return it, I say, in His name by Whom thou art
overcome; when thy Power has come to nothing, presume not longer to
retain this useless document. By penitence already hath this creature of
God restored himself to his true Lord, spurning thy yoke, hoping in the
Divine mercy for defence against thine assaults, and assisted by the
Most Holy and Glorious Virgin Mary, Mother of God, through whose
intercession he shall obtain from Jesus Christ, His Son, that which he
himself is not worthy to expect. Through the same Christ our Lord.

Whether this process was supposed to insure the visible and material
return of the incriminating document, or, failing this, was held to
cancel it formally, does not certainly appear and will matter little;
for what with the subtleties of the sorcerer and the assistance of the
Church in the revocation of such acts and deeds, there was little chance
for Infernus, <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_253.md) and the reluctance
of Lucifuge Rofocale to enter into the tricky contract is, on the whole,
exceedingly intelligible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_250"></span>[254:1](bcm64.htm#fr_251.md) Catholic theologians
who have concerned themselves with the question of the pact have so
extended the sphere of its operation that it includes the mere process
of communicating with spirits. In his *Theological Dictionary* Bergier
defines the pact as an express or tacit agreement made with the demon in
the hope of accomplishing things which transcend the powers of Nature.
It is express and formal when the operator himself invokes and demands
the help of the demon, whether that personage really appears in
response, or the sorcerer believes that he beholds him, that is to say,
is hallucinated. It is also express and formal when the demon is invoked
by the mediation of some one supposed to be in relation with him; in
other words, the consultation of a sorcerer is equivalent to a compact
with Satan. The performance of any act with the expectation of a result
from the demon is another compact of this kind. The pact is tacit or
equivalent when an act is performed with a view to some effect which
cannot naturally follow, while the intervention of God is not to be
expected. There remains only the fiend. For example, should any one cure
a disease by uttering certain words, this could only take place by the
operation of the Infernal Spirit, because the words do not themselves
possess. the required virtue, and God is not likely to infuse it. Hence
all theologians conclude that not only every species of Magic, but every
kind of superstition involves at least a tacit and equivalent compact
with the demon. St. Augustine and St. Thomas are said to have taken this
view. It is by precisely such judgments as these that the theology of
the Middle Ages brought itself to a by-word, and it is also for this
reason that sorcery most flourished when such doctrines ruled, because a
power which condemns everything to the same penalty condemns nothing
effectually, and that which is over-judged is always vindicated in the
eyes of the people. We have come to see that horse-stealing is not
murder, and we no longer avenge it by the gallows; so also, with due
respect to the masters of Theology, the follies of a village maiden who
believes in a <span id="page_255">p. 255</span> soothsaying gipsy, and
the trickeries of a quack-doctor who is absurd enough to take
Abracadabra seriously, are not the crime of Faust. But the learned
Bishop of Hippo and the Angel of the Schools produced Goethe as their
ultimate antithesis; when the girl who draws lots for her lover is given
over to Satan, the apotheosis of Faust is certain. Behind the manifest
exaggerations of such definitions there lies, however, a hidden pearl of
truth, which concerns the temerity of opening the door to evil, and in
this sense even the heedless act or the act of folly carries all its
consequences and all to which it may lead like an implicit within it.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[255:1](bcm64.htm#fr_252.md) But Lucifer, in
ordinary cases, is contented with a cat, though it may be suggested that
it is held only as a kind of hostage.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[256:1](bcm64.htm#fr_253.md) See c. iii. sec. i.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[264:1](bcm64.htm#fr_254.md) But contracts with
Infernus could apparently be repudiated with even greater facility. "If
you are disposed to renounce the devil after having entered into a
compact with him," says the *Vocabulaire Infernal*, "spit three times on
the ground, and he will have no further power over you,"--in which case
Black Magic with all its grim theatricals is the Art of exploiting lost
Angels with impunity. But the lost angel within the operator would not
be exploited with impunity like this at the end.
