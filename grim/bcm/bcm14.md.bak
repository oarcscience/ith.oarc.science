### § 2. The Lesser Key of Solomon

The Lemegeton, or Lesser Key of Solomon, Rabbi and King, is a work of
far more exalted pretensions, which deploys all the hierarchies and
evokes spirits by milliards. About its antiquity there is no need for
serious dispute; it claims to be translated from the Hebrew, but its
earliest perfect examples are in French of the seventeenth century, and
no one has heard of the original. It must have existed, however, in a
much earlier form; it is the subject of continual reference by
demonologists like Wierus, under the style of the sorcerer's *Liber
Spirituum*, and it is from this source that the scornful sceptic who was
the pupil of Agrippa, derived his *Pseudomonarchia Dæmonum*, with,
however, significant variations from the known copies.

The *Lemegeton* is divided into four parts, which control the offices of
all spirits at the will of the operator, from whom the ordinary
conditions are exacted. <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) With the
exception of the first part, which gave materials to Wierus, this
curious, and in many respects memorable, work has never been printed,
although it has been taxed surreptitiously for contributions by most
makers of Rituals and Grimoires. It deals,. as I have said, with the
evocation of all classes of spirits, evil, indifferent and good; its
opening Rites are those of Lucifer, Bel, Astaroth and the whole cohort
of Infernus; it is entitled *Goëtia*, which sufficiently explains
itself, <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) and contains the forms of
conjuration

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

for seventy-two chief devils and their ministers, with an account of
their powers and offices. The second part, or *Theurgia Goëtia*, deals
with the spirits of the cardinal points and their inferiors. These are
mixed natures, some good and some evil. The third book is called the
*Pauline Art*, for the significance of which name I am unable to
account, it concerns the Angels of the Hours of the Day and Night and of
the Zodiacal Signs. The fourth part, or *Almadel*, enumerates four other
choirs of spirits in a somewhat obscure manner. There is one significant
point about the entire work--the powers resident in the offices of
Infernal Spirits are minutely set forth, but the Ritual is almost silent
as to the special benefits which may be expected from intercourse with
the higher classes of intelligence; it is, therefore, obvious to whom
the magician would have recourse if he had a definite end in view. It
is, indeed, by no means improbable that the first or Goëtic portion
constitutes the true *Lemegeton*, and that the other sections,
apparently unknown to Wierus, are additions of a later date. This
division, in either case, is not only expressly connected with Black
Magic, or rather exclusively devoted thereto, but it indubitably divides
with the so-called Greater Key the forbidding honour of having been the
chief inspiration of all the later handbooks of infernal ceremonial.
Devoid of any doctrinal part, it has nothing which calls for citation in
this place, but as no Grimoire can pretend to completeness without it,
all its hierarchic tabulations and all its evoking processes will be
given in the Second Part.

I should state in conclusion that the *Little Key* is ascribed sometimes
to Solomon the King and sometimes to a Rabbi of that name. It should be
distinguished, however, from the *Key of Rabbi Solomon* proper, which is
more especially concerned with

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

the composition, consecration and use of planetary talismans. It
pretends to deal only with "good Genies," but it includes the blood
sacrifice, and there is the usual anxiety in respect of the form and
aspect in which the intelligence may appear. It is, however, especially
provided that no seal, pentacle or character shall be applied to the
injury of another, and more especially a student of the art. The art, in
fine, does not involve any compact, "implicit or explicit." I suppose
that this production is later than others of the cycle.
