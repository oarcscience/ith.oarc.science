# The Book of Ceremonial Magic

## by Arthur Edward Waite

#### \[1913\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is the second edition of a work which in its first edition was
titled, more provocatively, The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts. This
book is an attempt to synthesize the procedures of all of the famous
Grimoires. It draws on the Key of Solomon, the Grimorium Verum, the
apocryphal Fourth Book of Cornelius Agrippa, and many others, including
the famous Black Pullet, or Poulet Noir. While Waite is careful in his
analysis of the various Grimoires, he treats the subject matter
skeptically. The result is an unparalleled look at the details of
ceremonial magic.
