THE SEAL OF MALPAS

XXXIX\. MALPAS, a powerful president, appears at first like a crow, but
afterwards, when so commanded, assumes a human form, speaking with a
hoarse voice. He brings artificers swiftly from all parts of the world,
destroys the desires and thoughts <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221)
of enemies, gives good familiars and receives a sacrifice kindly, but
will deceive him who offers it.

THE SEAL OF RAUM

XL\. RAUM, <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_222) a great earl, appears
in the form of a crow, but assumes human shape when bidden. He steals
treasure, even out of the King's house, and carries it where commanded;
he destroys cities and dignities; he discerns past, present and future;
he causes love between friends and foes. Finally, he is of the Order of
the Thrones.

XLI\. FOCALOR, a strong duke, appears in the form of a man with the
wings of a griffin. He drowns men, sinks warships

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

and has power over the winds and the sea, but he will not hurt any one
if commanded to forbear by the exorcist. He hopes to return to the
Seventh Thrones in 1050 years. <span id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_223)

XLII\. SABNACK, <span id="fr_225"></span>[2](#fn_224) a mighty marquis,
appears in the form of an armed soldier, having a lion's head and riding
on a pale-coloured horse. He builds towers, camps and cities, fortifies
the same, torments men with wounds and putrid sores swarming with
worms; <span id="fr_226"></span>[3](#fn_225) he also gives good
familiars.

XLIII\. VEPAR, <span id="fr_227"></span>[4](#fn_226) a great duke,
appears as a mermaid. He guides the waters and battleships; he occasions
storms at sea, when so commanded by the Magician. He also causes the sea
to seem full of ships; he occasions death in three days by means of
putrefying sores and worm-eaten wounds.

XLIV\. SHAX, <span id="fr_228"></span>[5](#fn_227) a great marquis,
comes in the form of a stockdove, <span id="fr_229"></span>[6](#fn_228)
speaking with a hoarse voice. He destroys the sight, hearing and
understanding of any man or woman at the will of the exorcist, steals
money from the king's exchequer

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

and returns it in 1200 years. He will transport anything, but must first
be commanded into the triangle; otherwise he will deceive the operator.
He discovers all hidden things which are not in the keeping of wicked
spirits and gives good [familiars](errata.htm#0). <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_229)

XLV\. VINE, a great king and earl, appears in a monstrous form, <span
id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_230) but assumes human shape when commanded.
He discerns things hidden, reveals witches and makes known the past,
present and future. At the command of the exorcist he will build towers,
demolish walls and make the waters stormy.

THE SEAL OF HAGENTI

afterwards assumes human form and speaks in the Egyptian tongue. He
procures the love of women, discerns

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

past, present and future, and excites friendship even between foes. He
was of the Order of the Powers.

XLVIII\. HAGENTI, a great president, appears in the shape of a gigantic
bull with the wings of a griffin, but will duly put on human form. He
gives wisdom, transmutes all metals into gold and turns wine into water.

THE SEAL OF PROCEL

XLIX\. PROCEL, <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_231) appears in the form
of an angel, and is a great and strong duke. He speaks mystically of
hidden things, teaches geometry and the liberal sciences, and at the
command of the operator will make a great commotion, like that of
running waters; he also warms waters and tempers baths. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_232) He was of the Order of the Powers before
his fall.

L. FURCAS, a great duke, appears in the form of a cruel old man, with
long beard and hoary hair. He is seated on a pale horse and has a sharp
spear in his hand. He teaches philosophy, rhetoric, astronomy, logic,
chiromancy and pyromancy--perfectly in all their parts.

LI\. BALAM, a terrible and powerful king, appears with three

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

heads, the first like that of a bull, the second like that of a man and
the third like a ram's. With the tail of a serpent and eyes flaming
fire, he rides upon a furious bear, carrying a goshawk on his wrist and
speaking with a hoarse voice. He gives true answers as to past, present
and future, makes men go invisible, and imparts wit. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_221"></span>[208:1](bcm58.htm#fr_222) The reading of Wierus
is preferable, *i.e.*, Temples and Towers. But the reference is to the
edifices of enemies. On his own part, he builds houses and high towers
wonderfully.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[208:2](bcm58.htm#fr_223) Or *Raym*.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[209:1](bcm58.htm#fr_224) He is deceived, says
Wierus, and so say other codices.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[209:2](bcm58.htm#fr_225) *Alias*, *Saburac*.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[209:3](bcm58.htm#fr_226) At the command of the
magician (Wierus).

<span id="fn_226"></span>[209:4](bcm58.htm#fr_227) Otherwise, *Separ*.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[209:5](bcm58.htm#fr_228) Also *Chax* or
*Scox*.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[209:6](bcm58.htm#fr_229) Otherwise, a stork.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[210:1](bcm58.htm#fr_230) He is also a
horse-stealer, when so desired by the exorcist.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[210:2](bcm58.htm#fr_231) Or as a lion seated
on a black horse and holding a viper in his hand.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[211:1](bcm58.htm#fr_232) Otherwise, *Pucel*.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[211:2](bcm58.htm#fr_233) *i.e.*, the thermal
springs frequented by sick people.

the Dominations.
