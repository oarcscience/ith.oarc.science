XVII\. Gives all talents and a profound knowledge of every art, so that
the possessor will outshine the toil-worn experts

though unqualified by scholarship. Hereof are the advantages of an art
which--speaking generally concerning it--is nothing except practical and
the quality of its claims is not strained. The talisman, which must be
carried on the person, should be of white satin embroidered with black
silk. The operative words are: RITAS, ONALUN, TERSORIT, OMBAS, SERPITAS,
QUITATHAR, ZAMARATH, specifying the art which it is desired to possess.

XVIII\. Gives good fortune in any lottery. The talisman is of
cerise-coloured satin embroidered with gold and silver. It should be
bound upon the left arm by means of a white ribbon, and the ring must be
on the little finger of the right hand. The words are: ROKES for a
winning number, PILATUS for an ambes-ace, ZOTOAS for a denary, TULITAS
for a quaternary,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

\[paragraph continues\] XATANITOS for a quinary, being careful to
pronounce all the words at the quine--an instruction which I do not
quite grasp, but if the art or science of the lottery is followed at
this day under the old laws, I commend the question to those who are
experts therein. This is one of the lesser mysteries of occultism. At
cards the same potent formula should be repeated when shuffling for self
or partner. Before beginning, touch your left arm with your right hand
in the neighbourhood of the talisman, and kiss the ring. These little
contrivances can be effected, says the honest Grimoire, without exciting
the notice of your opponent.
