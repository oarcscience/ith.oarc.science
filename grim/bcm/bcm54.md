I. BAAL, a king ruling in the East, who imparts invisibility and wisdom.

id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_173) but sometimes with all at once. He
speaks with a hoarse voice. <span id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_174)

II\. AGARES, a duke ruling in the East, who appears in the form of a
comely old man, ambling upon a crocodile and carrying a goshawk on his
wrist. He makes those who run stand still, brings back runaways, teaches
all languages, destroys spiritual and temporal dignities and causes
earthquakes. <span id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_175) He is of the Order of
the Virtues. <span id="fr_177"></span>[4](#fn_176)

ass, but afterwards in human shape. He speaks hoarsely, teaching the

and changes men into various shapes. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[5](#fn_181)

VII\. AMON, a strong and powerful marquis, who appears like a wolf with
a serpent's head <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_184) and vomiting
flame. When so ordered, he assumes a human shape, but with the teeth of
a dog. <span id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_185) He discerns past and
future, procures love and reconciles friends and foes.

id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_187) He appears like a crowned man seated on

roaring voice, teaches all arts, sciences and secrets, gives and
confirms dignities, makes men subject to the will of the Magician,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_173"></span>[196:1](bcm54.htm#fr_174) The cat is the
traditional domestic favourite, not only of those who diabolise, but of
the diabolical world itself, which shews that after all there is a
strong link with humanity in the cohorts of Lucifer. The reader will
remember that the cat falls on its feet, not by natural good luck, but
by the special dispensation of Mohammed, and that the favourite of the
Prophet is in Paradise, no doubt on the best terms with the dog of the
Seven Sleepers.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[196:2](bcm54.htm#fr_175) Another codex says
that he manifests with three beads-the first like a toad, the second
like a man and the third like a cat.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[196:3](bcm54.htm#fr_176) According to the
*Vocabulaire Infernal*, the special province of *Agares* is to put to
flight the enemies of those whom he protects.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[196:4](bcm54.htm#fr_177) That is, he belonged
to this choir during the first estate of the Fallen Angels.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[197:1](bcm54.htm#fr_178) This may account for
his invocation, especially in Ceremonial Crystallomancy, by the putative
adepts of White Magic--as the most dubious of all arts is called in the
scorn of its professors.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[197:2](bcm54.htm#fr_179) According to Wierus,
he summons into the presence of the exorcist the souls of drowned men
and of those detained in Purgatory, called magically *Cartagra*--that
is, the affliction of souls. They assume an aërial body, are visible to
sight and reply to questions. Another version says that *Gamygyn*
tarries with the exorcist till he has accomplished his desires.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[197:3](bcm54.htm#fr_180) Or *Barbas*.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[197:4](bcm54.htm#fr_181) At the request of the
operator (Wierus).

<span id="fn_181"></span>[197:5](bcm54.htm#fr_182) He is the third
spirit in the Hierarchy of Wierus.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[197:6](bcm54.htm#fr_183) Or *Malaphar*.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[197:7](bcm54.htm#fr_184) With the head of a
hunter or a thief, says Wierus. He shews friendship to his familiars
till they are caught in the trap.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[198:1](bcm54.htm#fr_185) *Cauda serpentis*,
says Wierus.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[198:2](bcm54.htm#fr_186) And, according to
another MS., "a great head like to a mighty raven."

<span id="fn_186"></span>[198:3](bcm54.htm#fr_187) He also understands
the songs of birds and the language of all other animals (Wierus).

<span id="fn_187"></span>[198:4](bcm54.htm#fr_188) A longer recension
says: By Lucifer is here to be understood he that was drowned in the
depths of his knowledge. He would needs be like God and for his pride
and arrogancy was thrown out into destruction. Of him it is said--Every
precious stone is thy covering. The last reference is to the panegyric
of the Prince of Tyre in Ezekiel: its occurrence in this place is most
remarkable.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[198:5](bcm54.htm#fr_189) It appears from
Wierus that the operator may fail to understand this spirit, in which
case he must stretch forth the character belonging to him and command
him to speak clearly.
