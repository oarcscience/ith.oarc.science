### § 2. Theosophia Pneumatica

In the year 1686, the *Arbatel* was translated into German, and in the
same year--possibly in the same volume-appeared, also in German, a work
entitled *The Little Keys of Solomon* or *Theosophia Pneumatica*. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) There are no examples of these editions in
the British Museum, and inquiry has failed to elicit any particulars
concerning them. Both are reprinted, together with other specimens of
Ancient Magical Literature, to illustrate the Faust legend, in the third
volume of Scheible's *Das Kloster*, <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)
The translation of the *Arbatel* makes no reference to the previous
edition in Latin, and *Theosophia Pneumatica* nowhere states that it is
an adaptation of the earlier work. The attribution to Solomon is, of
course, wholly contrary to

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the spirit of the Ritual, and betrays so far the hand of ignorance.

The adapter had, however, been subject to other occult influences
besides the *Arbatel*. He applies the term Talmid <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) to the magical aspirant, and this is not
used by the original. The adaptation has been well executed and makes
for additional clearness. The transcendental portions are slightly
accentuated; it is said in one place that the exaltation of prayer is
the end of the whole Mystery, and that such exaltation will never be
denied to the true seeker, who is recommended on no account to
undervalue his own prayers. This is a better presentation of the theory
than the corresponding passage in the *Arbatel* itself. There is also an
addendum on Transcendental Medicine, which, so far as can be known, is
original, and it is as curious as anything in the literature with which
we are dealing. <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md)

<span id="fn_24"></span>[36:1](bcm09.htm#fr_24.md) There is a curious
history attaching to this word, but it can he elucidated only by a
Hebrew scholar. It seems to be of late introduction, though it derives
from the verb *to learn*. It has been said to represent a stage of
initiation in certain occult societies of Islâm.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[36:2](bcm09.htm#fr_25.md) As it is unlikely that
*Theosophia Pneumatica* will ever be printed in English, it may be well
to give a summary of its appendix, that is to say, of the only section
of this work which differs generically from the *Arbatel*. Affirming
that all things are threefold, from the Divine Triad of Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, to man, who is composed of the fleshly body, the sensitive
soul and the rational spirit, it defines the human principles as
follows: The body is of earth; the sensitive soul is of the four
elements, but derives through the stars, and is the seat of
understanding and genius for arts and sciences; the rational spirit is
from God absolutely; the sphere of its activity is celestial and divine,
and divine inspiration and influence pass through it to the material
body. The body is a house wherein soul and spirit abide and perform
their functions, having been married therein by God. At the same time,
they strive daily with one another, till the spirit overcomes the soul,
and thus attains regeneration. There are two kinds of death--that which
results from the destruction of vital physical organs by disease or
injury, and that which results from the destruction of the sensitive
soul by envenomed astral influences. Physical disintegration and flight
of the divine spirit follow in either case. The spirit may also be
recalled by the direct action of the will of God, without disease or
injury. Man is therefore poised upon three pillars; if one of them fall
or break, the man dies. He should preserve and embalm his body against
infectious diseases, for the living organism can be embalmed better than
a corpse. He should also combat the venomous influences of baleful
stars, for Elohim has gifted men with the power to compose characters
that will destroy such influences. It is impossible, however, to cure
those diseases with which God in His unsearchable compassion may Himself
scourge mankind; vain are the best medicines and vain the highest
arcana, vain <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> is *p. ex. unicorn.*, vain
is the potent *aurum*, vain the *spiritus auri*, vain the *quinta
essenda*; *Azoth* itself is useless; the *lapis philosophorum* is made
void. The skilled physician will immediately discover such a case in a
patient. All other diseases, whether deriving from the planets, from the
natural corruption of the earth or from neglect, may be cured by natural
remedies--by herbs, balms, spices, oils, metals or preparations of
Alchemy. When natural diseases become incurable it is through the
ignorance or indocility of man. This Appendix of *Theosophia Pneumatica*
not only indicates the influence but reproduces the terminology of
Paracelsus.
