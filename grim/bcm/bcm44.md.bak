### § 3. Concerning the Rod and Staff of the Art

The great mystery of practical magic is supposed to be centred in the
Magic Rod, and Éliphas Lévi, who claims to have reconstructed the
primitive ceremonial, but seems rather to have over-edited his
materials, supplies a highly sensational account of its powers and an
elaborate method of its preparation. For him it is the sign of the
transmission of the magical priesthood, which has never ceased since the
darksome origin of pseudo-transcendent science. The operator is
overwhelmed with precautions concerning the secrecy which must be
maintained in regard to it and might well be dejected by the
difficulties of its consecration. In view of such imputed importance, it
is curious that De Abano and pseudo-Agrippa omit all mention of this
tremendous instrument, while the *Key of Solomon* dismisses it in a few
lines of easy instruction. It would appear, however, that a staff and
rod are both necessary, especially in Goëtic operations, though their
distinctive provinces are in no

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

case described. According to the Book of *True Black Magic*, the staff
should be of cane and the wand or rod of hazel, both virgin-that is,
having no branches or offshoots. <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md)
They must be cut and trimmed on the day and in the hour of the Sun,
while the following characters must be inscribed upon the staff, but on
the day and in the hour of Mercury:  <span

If engraved with the "sacred instrument," it will be so much the
better. <span id="fr_109"></span>[3](#fn_109.md) In either case, let the
following words be recited when the writing is finished:--O ADONAY,
*most Holy and most Powerful, vouchsafe to consecrate and bless this
Staff and this Rod, so that they may possess the required virtue, O most
Holy* ADONAY*, to whom be honour and glory for ever and over. Amen*.

Lastly, the two instruments should be asperged, fumigated and put away
in the silken cloth.

The *Grimorium Verum* directs the operator to make two wands of wood
which has never borne fruit. The first should be cut at a single stroke
from an elder-tree on the day and in the hour of Mercury. The second
should be of hazel, free from bud, and cut in the hour of the Sun. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[4](#fn_110.md) The magical characters which must be
engraved upon each have been omitted by the printer, but they are
supplied--or their substitutes--in

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

the modern Italian versions. They are, for the first, the seal or
character of *Frimost* and that of *Klippoth* for the second (see Chap.
III., Sec. 2). The prayer of consecration offers no variation of
importance from that of *True Black Magic*, and does not need to be
reproduced. Aspersion and fumigation are prescribed, as in the previous
case.

The Grand Grimoire devotes an entire chapter to the true composition of
the Mysterious Wand, otherwise the Destroying or Blasting Rod. It
mentions no other instrument, and ascribes to it all power in diabolical
evocations. It would seem to have supplied Éliphas Lévi with the first
hint of his still more potent *Verendum*, to which, however, an
allegorial significance may perhaps be attributed. On the eve of the
great enterprise, says this Ritual, you must go in search of a wand or
rod of wild hazel which has never borne fruit; its length should be
nineteen and a half inches. When you have met with a wand of the
required form, touch it not otherwise than with your eyes; let it stay
till the next morning, which is the day of operation; then must you cut
it absolutely at the moment when the sun rises; strip it of its leaves
and lesser branches, if any there be, using the knife of sacrifice
stained with the blood of the victim. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) Begin cutting it when the sun is first
rising over this hemisphere, and pronounce the following words:--*I
beseech Thee, O Grand* ADONAY, ELOIM, ARIEL *and* JEHOVAM*, to be
propitious unto me, and to endow this Wand which I am cutting with the
power and virtue of the rods of Jacob, of Hoses and of the mighty
Joshua! I also beseech Thee, O Grand* ADONAY, ELOIM, ARIEL *and*
JEHOVAM*, to infuse into this Rod the whole strength of Samson, the
righteous wrath of* EMANUEL *and the thunders of mighty Zariatnatmik,
who will avenge the names of men at the Day of judgment! Amen*.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

Having pronounced these "sublime and terrific words," and still keeping
your eyes turned towards the region of the rising sun, you may finish
cutting your rod, and may then carry it to your abode. You must next go
in search of a piece of ordinary wood, fashion the two ends like those
of the genuine rod and take it to an ironsmith, who shall weld the steel
blade of the sacrificial knife into two pointed caps and shall affix
them to the said ends. This done, you may again return home, and there,
with your own hands, affix the steel caps to the joints of the genuine
rod. Subsequently, you must obtain a piece of loadstone and magnetise
the steel ends, pronouncing the following words:--*By the grand* ADONAY,
ELOIM, ARIEL *and* JEHOVAM*, I bid thee join with and attract all
substances which I desire, by the power of the sublime* ADONAY, ELOIM,
ARIEL *and* JEHOVAM*. I command thee, by the opposition of fire and
water, to separate all substances, as they were separated on the day of
the worlds creation. Amen*.

Finally, you must rejoice in the honour and glory of the sublime Adonay,
being convinced that you are in possession of a most priceless Treasure
of the Light. <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_107"></span>[162:1](bcm44.htm#fr_107.md) The definition of
virgin wood differs in the *Key of Solomon*, which says: In all cases
the wood should be virgin--that is, of one years growth only.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[162:2](bcm44.htm#fr_108.md) According to the *Key
of Solomon*, both staff and rod should be cut on the day and in the hour
of Mercury at sunrise, which limits the operation to the few days of the
middle winter, when the sun rises about eight o'clock.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[162:3](bcm44.htm#fr_109.md) Presumably, with the
burin or graver.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[162:4](bcm44.htm#fr_110.md) This variation
appears to reconcile the Book of *True Black Magic* with the *Key of
Solomon*, and is probably the true reading.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[163:1](bcm44.htm#fr_111.md) See Chapter VI., Sec.
1.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[164:1](bcm44.htm#fr_112.md) Another method of
preparing a Magic Rod ordains that it shall be a branch of the
hazel-tree put forth during the year of operation. It must be cut on the
first Wednesday after the new moon, between 11 P.M. and midnight. The
knife must be new and the branch severed by a downward stroke. The rod
must then be blessed; at the stouter end must be written the word AGLA
✠, in the centre ON ✠, and towards the point TETRAGRAMMATON ✠. Lastly
say over it: *Conjuro te cito mihi obedire*--I conjure thee to obey me
forthwith.
