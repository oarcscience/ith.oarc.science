### § 3. The Unprinted Literature of Ceremonial Magic

For the purposes of the present, inquiry it will be convenient to
consider the Rituals under the three heads of Transcendental, Composite
and Black, subject, as regards the first, to some specific
qualifications which will appear in the second chapter, and subject, in
respect of all, to the perfect understanding that these three are one.
So far as may be possible, the antiquity of individual Rituals will be
determined in the course of their examination, but as this inquiry is
based, with a single exception of undeniable importance, upon the
printed literature, because it is that only which has exercised a real
influence, it may be well, as a conclusion to this introductory part, to
give some information regarding magical processes which have remained in
manuscript, and are to be found only, or can at least be consulted only,
in the public libraries of Europe. Almost without exception, the source
of their inspiration is the work mentioned in the preface, namely, *The
Key of Solomon*, and

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

they are consequently of later date. The Library of the Arsénal at Paris
has a reputation for being especially rich in Magical MSS., but there is
also a large collection in the British Museum which may be regarded as
typical. There is nothing of earlier date or more importance among the
French treasures, and, to determine the question of antiquity in a few
words, there is nothing among our own that is much anterior to the
beginning of the fourteenth century.

The numerical strength of the treatises, late and early combined, is in
itself considerable, but, setting aside the codices made use of by the
English editor of *The Key of Solomon*, the interest of which was
exhausted long since by the appearance of that work, there are only
three small classes or cycles to which an especial appeal attaches in
connection with the present inquiry. The first may be termed the group
of Honorius, comprising three MSS.; the second is that of the *Sepher
Raziel*, of which there are two forms; the third includes the English
codices of the *Lemegeton*. The chief MS. of the first group is also one
of the most ancient treatises dealing with Magic in the library. This is
Sloane 313, a Latin MS. on vellum, in a bad state of preservation. The
close writing and abbreviations make it somewhat difficult to read. It
is interesting, however, because it connects with the *Grimoire of
Honorius*, one of the most historical and notable Rituals of Black
Magic, being the work of some person bearing that name. It belongs to
the fourteenth century and has no title or other determinate name, but
it appears from the text that it was understood to be the *Sworn Book of
Honorius*. The introduction or prologue to the work is obscurely worded
in the initial pages, but it seems to account for the condemnation of
magic by the prelates of the Church on the ground that they have been
deceived by demons. The result is the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

convocation of all the "masters of Magic," to the number of 811, all of
whom seem to have come out of Naples, Athens and a place. entitled
Tholetus. Among these a species of spokesman was chosen, whose name was
Honorius, the son of Euclidus, Master of the Thebans. He was deputed to
work for the rest, and he entered into counsel with an angel called
*Hochmel* or *Hocroel*, (? *Hochmaël*), and thereafter wrote seven
volumes of Magical Art, "giving the kernel to us and the shells to
others." From these books he seems afterwards to have extracted
ninety-three chapters, containing a summary of the whole subject, and
made them into a volume which "we term the sacred or sworn book." In the
meantime, the princes and prelates, having burned "certain fables or
trifles," concluded that they had completely destroyed the art, and were
therefore pacified. The magicians, however, took an oath among
themselves to preserve the masterpiece of Honorius in the most secret
and careful manner, making three copies at the most, the possessor of
any example being bound over to bury it before his decease, or otherwise
insure its interment in his own grave, unless there were some trusty and
worthy person to whom it could be transmitted. It is interesting to note
that this is the Law of Transmission in respect of Alchemy. The
important point about the MS. itself is that it fixes the source of the
mendacious tradition which ascribes a Grimoire of Black Magic to a Pope
of the name of Honorius, as will be seen at length later on. The *Sworn
Book* is not, of course, the Grimoire, but the existence and reputed
authorship of the one will enable us to understand the attribution of
the other. Honorius the sorcerer was identified with Honorius the Pope,
firstly by the confused mind of magical legend, and secondly by
conscious imposture, much after the same manner that Raymond Lully, the
"illuminated doctor" of Majorca, was

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

identified with Lully the alchemist, by tradition at the inception, and
not long afterwards by the help of forged treatises. The *Sworn Book* is
in other respects remarkable, and has been unaccountably overlooked by
writers on Ceremonial Magic; it may be taken to indicate that an
association of magicians was most probably in corporate existence during
or before the fourteenth century. While it is clearly of Christian
origin, it derives from the supposed works of Solomon, and would appear
to indicate that the Solomonic cycle was at that time only in course of
formation, as also that the earliest elements approximate not to the
Grand Clavicle, but to the *Little Key*, otherwise, the *Lemegeton*. As
to the operations contained in the Sworn Book, they are those of White
and Black Magic, undiscriminated, without, however, any trace of the
conventional "dealing with the devil." The MS. under notice need not, of
course, be regarded as the original; as to this there is no means of
knowing. The British Museum possesses also a later transcript, belonging
to the sixteenth century, and a most valuable English translation,
written on vellum in beautiful Gothic characters. It is referred to the
fifteenth century.

The second group comprises two MSS., both in the Sloane collection, and
both containing, among other treatises, the important and curious work
attributed to Solomon under the title of *Sepher Raziel*. That numbered
3826 belongs to the sixteenth century. It is an English translation of a
Latin original which in this form is unknown to myself; the first line
of the original is usually given at the beginning of each section. It is
divided into seven books, and purports to have been sent to Solomon by a
prince of Babylon who was greater and more worshipful than all men of
his time, his name being Sameton, while the two wise men who brought it
were called Kamazan and Zazant. The Latin title of the treatise is said
to be

Angelus

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Magnus Secreti Creatoris*; it was the first
book after Adam, was written in the language of Chaldea and afterwards
was translated into Hebrew. It is a noticeable fact that in this work
the first section is entitled *Clavis*, and if we may regard the *Sepher
Raziel* as antedating the *Claviculæ*, it explains why a Key was
attributed to Solomon. The Clavis in question is, however, concerned
with the magical influences of the stars, "without which we can effect
nothing." The second book is called *Ala*; it treats of the virtues of
stones, herbs and beasts. The third is *Tractatus Thymiamalum*, the use
of which term connects it with the *Sworn Book* of Honorius; it treats
of suffumigations. The fourth sets out the times of the year, day and
night which are disposed to operation; the fifth embodies the laws
regarding lustrations and abstinence; while the sixth, called *Samaim*,
expounds the nature of the heavens, of the angels and of the operations
of each. The seventh and last book is concerned with the virtues of
names. A Latin version of the *Sepher Raziel* occurs in Sloane MS. 3853,
ascribed to the same period. It differs from the former in several
considerable respects, being also much shorter and full of rare magical
symbols.

The MSS. of the third group are all in English, and all of late date.

Sloane 2731 is a very neat MS., begun on January 10, 1676, and
containing the entire *Lemegeton*, or *Lesser Key of Solomon*, in
English. Some account of this celebrated work, which has so
unaccountably escaped publication, will be found in the third chapter of
this part. Sloane 3648 is another manuscript of the *Lemegeton*, also in
English, together with the *Ars Notoria*, a book of invocations and
prayers attributed to Solomon, of which there are many examples extant
in England and on the Continent. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) It is
a work which connects with Magic

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

without being itself Magical, and, in fact, stands in much the same
relation to the Key or Clavicle as the *Enchiridion of Pope Leo* to the
*Isagoge of the Arbatel*. Lastly, the same MS. contains the *Magical
Archidoxies* of Paracelsus, but the version seems to be quite distinct
from the treatise so entitled in the Geneva folio, containing the
collected writings of the German adept. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) In either case, it is not a work of
Ceremonial Magic, its title notwithstanding. Sloane 3805 is a quarto
MS., chiefly alchemical and medical, comprising a translation of the
forged epistles of Sendivogius, and towards the end the *Lemegeton*,
started by the writer apparently with the intention of transcribing all
the works attributed to Solomon under the heading of this angelic name.
It breaks off, however, at the end of the offices of the thirteenth
spirit belonging to the Infernal Hierarchy.

It should be added that the three groups contain materials which are
common to all. The independent treatises which follow the *Sepher
Raziel* in Sloane 3826 extract matter from the *Sworn Book*, while that
entitled *Liber Lunæ*, concerning the intelligences of the mansions of
the moon, the squares of the planets, their seals, rings and so
forth--which, by the way, seems in this form unknown to modern
critics--has given material to other and later collections.

The unprinted literature of Ceremonial Magic offers a considerable field
to research, though even in the historical or bibliographical interest
it is questionable whether it would repay the pains, unless research of
all kinds whatsoever is to be regarded as its own reward. Among the
miscellaneous MSS. in the British Museum, it is here only necessary to
notice two,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

as they contain materials connected with the present design. Sloane 3884
includes a process in Necromancy--how to call the ghost of a dead
body--the invocation of spirits into a crystal--the form for summoning
spirits within the circle--and a method of exorcism in the Tuscan
language,--all impudently attributed to the author of the *Nullity of
Magic*--that is to say, Roger Bacon. In the second part of my present
work a special chapter is devoted to Infernal Necromancy, and the MS.
here mentioned will be useful for purposes of reference. Sloane 3850 is
a MS. of the seventeenth century, which contains transcripts from the
fourth book of Cornelius Agrippa and from the *Heptameron* of Peter de
Abano in Latin. There is also a *Good and Proved Experiment* for
evocation, which uses the *Pater*, *Ave*, *Credo* and Litany of the
Saints as magical formulae. Finally, there are processes, mostly in
Latin, but some in English, for the discovery of things lost, the
recovery of things stolen, for the spirits of the dead who cannot rest
in their graves, and for persons possessed by evil spirits. The treatise
*De Novem Candariis Salomonis*, containing curious figures and sigils,
deserves particular mention, as this again seems unknown to students.
Its attribution notwithstanding, it is the work of a Catholic writer.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[21:1](bcm07.htm#fr_8.md) The printed English
translation of Robert Turner is well known to collectors.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[22:1](bcm07.htm#fr_9.md) The genuine *Archidoxies*
are concerned with the alchemical separation of elements, with
transcendental Medicine and the Quintessence, with Magisteries and
Elixirs. The first complete rendering is in *The Hermetic and Alchemical
Writings of Paracelsus*, edited by myself, 2 vols. 4to 1894.
