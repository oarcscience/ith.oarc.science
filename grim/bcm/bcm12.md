### § 5. Summary of Transcendental Magic

This concludes our examination of the Rituals of so-called
Transcendental Magic, comprising all those to which any currency has
been given. There are no doubt other treatises which exist only in
manuscript and possess no literary history, but they scarcely come
within the scope of the present inquiry. I do not believe that anything
has remained in obscurity which is more entitled to come into notice
than those which have been mentioned briefly in the first chapter. But
if I am wrong it signifies nothing, for there has been enough and to
spare already.

The general conclusion which must follow from the examination is
naturally of a foregone kind. As premised at the outset, the Rituals
with which we have been dealing are not worthy of the name
Transcendental, nor does it belong to them. We have, on the one hand, a
collection of prayers, falsely attributed and modern in their origin, to
which no occult significance can be reasonably attached. Devotionally,
they are innocent enough; applied after the manner of a charm, they are
offices of vain observance. On the other hand, we have a bald rite for
the Invocation of Olympic Spirits, which, despite the grandiloquent
claims of the unknown author, is rather childish than exalted, for it
may be assumed that no person is naïve enough at the present day to take
the angelical offices literally, and to believe, for example, that by
the evocation of *Aratron* the contents of his coal-cellar will be
transformed into real treasures. Transcendental Magic is, therefore,
hyperbolical in its promises, while these from the

mystical standpoint would be frivolous if they could be construed
literally. The occult student will derive no light from such processes,
but the subject is at the same time a very curious and fantastic branch
of bibliographical research, in which I have been able, moreover, to
clear up some doubtful points, and in this sense it has been worth
prosecuting. The conclusion, then, in respect of the Rituals of
Transcendental Magic is that there are no Transcendental Rituals, and
that the truth is not in them.
