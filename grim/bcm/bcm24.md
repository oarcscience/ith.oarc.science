### § 5. Minor and Spurious Rituals of Black Magic

To distinguish in a mass of forged literature certain books as more
spurious than others, seems at first sight a needless ingenuity of
criticism. There are, however, some Rituals of Black Magic which are
merely the knavish speculations of catchpenny booksellers, and there are
others, anterior to the period, and foreign to the centres, of
*colportage*, which have never exercised any influence, and are, in
fact, generally unknown. Both classes neither possess a history nor have
contributed anything to their subject. Yet it does not follow that they
offer no points of curiosity or interest, and some account of them must
be given in this place.

The *Verus Jesuitarum Libellus*, or "True Magical Work of the Jesuits,
containing most powerful conjurations for all evil spirits of whatever
state, condition and office they are, and a most powerful and approved
conjuration of the Spirit Uriel; <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) to
which is added Cyprian's Invocation of Angels, and his Conjuration of
the Spirits guarding Hidden Treasures, together with a form for their
dismissal,"--purports to have been published at Paris in the Latin
tongue, and in the year 1508. It was reprinted by Scheible at Stuttgart
in 1845, forming part of the curious collection of Faust documents
already mentioned. Finally, in the year 1875, the late Major Herbert
Irwin made, or procured privately, an English translation, which remains
in MS. The date placed on the title-page of the original edition at once
betrays the imposture. It will be almost needless to say that in the
first decade of

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

the sixteenth century there were no Jesuits; the Society originated with
St. Ignatius, who died in 1556, being two years after the confirmation
of the Society by Pope Paul III. The Conjurations are excessively
curious. The first is addressed to a spirit whose name is not indicated,
but he is, supposed to have been obedient to Abraham and Isaac, and is
directed to bring the magician, out of the depths of the sea, so many
millions--the number is not specified and depends upon the cupidity of
the operator--of the best Spanish gold; otherwise, says the Conjuration,
I will condemn thy body (*sic*) and thy soul. In the second. formula,
the spirit is cited by the knowledge and exorcising power of
Agrippa, <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) which again puts a definite
limit to the antiquity of the collection, were it otherwise necessary.
The third Invocation is addressed to the spirit *Zayariel*, who is
conjured by *Agla Scheffert* and the great *Jehova Podashocheia*. The
remainder, to the number of seven in all, are nearly identical in
character and precisely in purpose, the demon being invariably required
too bring that which is desired by the operator from the depths of the
sea, or from the abyss of the waters, or from the spiritual abyss. The
Discharge or Absolution which concludes the series is really an
additional conjuration.

The *Citation of St. Cyprian* is presumably an experiment in what is
distinguished as White Magic, seeing that it is addressed to an Angel
who was the guest of Lot and Abraham. The object being "help in need,"
and this in all simplicity, it is apparently appropriate for every
strait in life, and should be, therefore, noted for reference by those
who may think it worth while; it is too cumbrous and tedious for these
pages, A similar observation would apply only too truly to the *Process
for the Magical Acquisition of Hidden Treasures*, but it is

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

much more complete than the rest and has so much connection with the
*Summum Bonum*, the desire of the eyes of all Ceremonial Magic, that it
may be held necessary to give it. it is, however, an operation of
Necromancy and will be found in its proper place in the Second
Part. <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) The *Verus Jesuitarum
Libellus* closes with a fuliginous conjuration of the entire hierarchy
of Infernus, which continues for many pages and contains more
unintelligible words than several combined Grimoires. In the absence of
all knowledge of its original edition, it is impossible to throw any
light upon this singular imposture.

The *Praxis Magica Fausti* or "Magical Elements of Dr. John Faust,
Practitioner of Medicine," claims to have been printed from the original
MS. in the Municipal Library of Weimar and is dated 1571, at which
period it must be respectfully affirmed that there was no Municipal
Library in the birthplace of Goethe. Furthermore, the existing
collection does not include the MS. Whether the original edition was
antedated cannot be certainly affirmed, as it is exceedingly scarce, and
I am acquainted with it only in the reprint of Scheible and in an
unprinted transcript by Major Irwin. The work consists of a few curious
plates, in the manner of the seventeenth century, and a few
unintelligible conjurations, all exceedingly brief. The third of these
exhorts the Evil Spirit on the quaint ground that now it is the time of
the Great Name *Tetragrammaton*. The purpose of citation is not
indicated; the formulæ are Christian, broken up by innumerable crosses
and by names and terms which defy conjecture as to their significance.
The hierarchy of the spirit is determined by the closing words: "I
command thee, O Spirit *Rumoar*, even by Lucifer, thy mighty sovereign."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_61"></span>[110:1](bcm24.htm#fr_61.md) The modern reprint of
Scheible reads *Usiel* throughout, as does also the MS. English
translation. Supposing the latter to have followed the original edition,
it would seem conclusive that the blunder--for such it evidently
is--occurs also in that.
