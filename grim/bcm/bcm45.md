### § 4. Concerning the Pen and Ink of the Art

Preliminary magical ceremonial seems to have as its chief object the
personal consecration of every article, great or small, indispensable or
occasional, which is connected with the several processes. The pen and
ink with which characters and names

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

are written must both be specially prepared. Take a new quill, says the
*Grimorium Verum*; asperge and fumigate it after the manner of the other
instruments; when you hold it in your hand to shape it, say the
following words:--ABABALOY, SAMOY, ESCAVOR, ADONAY: *I have expelled all
illusion from this pen, that it may retain efficaciously within it the
virtue necessary for all things which are used in this Art, as well for
operations as for characters and conjurations. Amen*.

In like manner, a horn or ink-well must be bought on the day and in the
hour of Mercury, and in the same hour the following names of God must be
written about it:--JOD, HE, VAU, HE, METATRON, JOD, <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) CADOS, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) ELOYM, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md) SABAOTH. It must then be filled with
fresh ink which has been exorcised as follows --

EXORCISM OF THE INK

I exorcise thee, creature of Ink, by ANSTON, CERRETON, STIMULATOR, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_116.md) ADONAY*, and by the name of Him Whose
one Word created all and can achieve all, that so thou shall assist me
in my work, that my work may be accomplished by my will, and fulfilled
with the permission of God, Who ruleth in all things and through all
things, everywhere and for ever. Amen*.

BENEDICTION OF THE INK

Lord God Almighty, Who rulest all and reignest through all eternity, Who
dost fulfill great wonders in Thy creatures, grant unto us the grace of
Thy Holy Spirit by means of this pen. Bless it ✠*, sanctify it* ✠

and confer upon it a peculiar

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

virtue, so that whatsoever is said, whatsoever we desire to do and to
write herewith, may succeed through Thee, Most Holy Prince ADONAY*.
Amen*. <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117.md)

Then asperge, fumigate and exorcise.

The Book of True Black Magic, on the other hand, directs the operator to
pluck the third feather from the right wing of a male goose <span
id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) and to say when extracting it: ABRACHAY,
ARATON, SAMATOY, SCAVER, ADONAY! *Expel all evil from this feather, so
that it may possess full power to write whatsoever I will*.

Then shape it with the Knife of the Art, namely, that having a white
handle; incense also and asperge it. Lastly, take a new earthen cornicle
or inkhorn, made on the day and in the hour of Venus, and write about it
these names with the exorcised lancet of the Art: JOD, HE, VAU, HE,
MITATRON, JAE, <span id="fr_119"></span>[3](#fn_119.md) JAE, JAE, CADOS,
ELOYN, ZEVAO. <span id="fr_120"></span>[4](#fn_120.md) Then dip the pen
therein, pronouncing the following words:--*I exorcise thee, creature of
the feather kind, by* ETERETON, <span id="fr_121"></span>[5](#fn_121.md)
*by* STIMULATON <span id="fr_122"></span>[5](#fn_121.md) *and by the name*
ADONAY. *Do thou aid me in all my works*.

The instruction continues---As it is sometimes necessary to write with
coloured inks, have several horns containing white inks, in which infuse
thy colours for the pentacles and characters. The colours must be
diluted with the blessed water which we term exorcised, and with gum
arabic. Lastly, perfume them. Let this be done with all devotion,
humility and

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

faith, wanting which nothing can be accomplished, says the Grimoire.

The same work gives particulars concerning the extraction of the
sword-feather from the right wing of a swallow, preceding the action
with the words *Yin He*. It should then be made into a pen by means of
the Knife of the Art, and the name Anereton must be written on it with
the goose-quill, after which the Psalms *Ecce quam bonum et quam
jucundum* and *Laudate Dominum ommes gentes* <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) are to be recited over it, followed by
aspersion and fumigation.

It is not to be supposed that any ordinary ink could be suitable for so
serious a business as that of engrossing pacts. Even the consecrations
previously given are inadequate in such a case. It is understood that
the signature is written with the blood of the operator, but the deed
itself requires a special preparation, as follows:--Place river-water in
a new, varnished earthenware pot, together with the powder hereinafter
described. Then take sprigs of fern gathered on the Eve of St. John and
vine twigs cut in the full moon of March. Kindle this wood. by means of
virgin paper, and when the water boils the ink will be made. It must be
changed each time that there is occasion to write, that is to say,
whensoever the appellation of a spirit is undertaken.

Powder for Pact-Ink

|     |                                 |        |
|-----|---------------------------------|--------|
| ℞   | Gall-nuts                       | 10 Oz. |
|     | Roman Vitriol or Green Copperas | 3 Oz.  |
|     | Rock Alum or Gum Arabic         | 3 Oz.  |

 

Make an impalpable powder, and when you would compose the ink, use as
above described.

The authorities for this process are not the Grimoires proper

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

but the collections of Magical Secrets which are sometimes appended to
them but sometimes form independent works.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[165:1](bcm45.htm#fr_113.md) The *Key of Solomon*
substitutes the Divine Name, *Jah*, thrice repeated.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[165:2](bcm45.htm#fr_114.md) *i.e.*, *Kadosh*.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[165:3](bcm45.htm#fr_115.md) *i.e.*, *Elohim*.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[165:4](bcm45.htm#fr_116.md) The *Key of Solomon*
reads *Anaireton, Simulator*.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[166:1](bcm45.htm#fr_117.md) This prayer, like
many others in the Grimoires which derive from the Clavicle, is the
introduction of a Christian compiler. The *Key of Solomon* has no
Trinitarian references and no crosses.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[166:2](bcm45.htm#fr_118.md) This process is
identical with that of the Clavicle, the names only being mutilated.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[166:3](bcm45.htm#fr_119.md) *i.e.*, *Jah*.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[166:4](bcm45.htm#fr_120.md) *i.e.*, *Elohim
Tzabaoth*.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[166:5](bcm45.htm#fr_122.md) As before,
*Anaireton* and *Simulator*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[167:1](bcm45.htm#fr_123.md) Psalms cxxxii. and
cxvi. of the Vulgate.
