### § 7. Concerning the Victim of the Art

It is usually supposed that the offering of a bloody sacrifice is an
essential condition of success in Black Magic and that the embrutement
of the operator is the chief purpose of the ordination. It is true that
such an offering is in most cases enjoined, but its object is simple and
commonplace rather than diabolical or recondite, and the practice itself
is based on the so-called White Magic of the *Key of Solomon*. It offers

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

another instance that if this text be the head and fount of the Art, it
is also the root of its diabolism. The Art--I should explain--has its
victim, not because blood is required in the one case more than the
other, but because it was customary for pacts and pentacles to be
written on parchment or vellum, and, in view of that doctrine of
personal consecration already explained, the Black Magician had, as far
as possible, to dispense with outside labour, to be his own whitesmith,
his own penmaker, and hence also his own tanner. *Alterius non sit qui
suus esse potest* was the maxim of Paracelsus, and it was carried
further in Goëtia than mere intellectual independence. Make yourself
what you want; do not trust it to others; it will not only possess more
of your personal virtue, but you will be sure of the article--such might
be the commentary of the Grimoires upon the aphorism of the sage of
Hohenheim, and there is the more reason in the counsel because even the
accessible substances required by the operator had usually some awkward
conditions attached to them, which might remain unfulfilled unless he
himself was actively present in their preparation. A particular case in
point is the parchment used in the Art. The magician was required to
slay a lamb or kid with his own hands, not because there was any
symbolical importance attached to the act of destruction--the Grimoires
make no such ascription--not because the blood was used-for its use is
seldom prescribed--but to insure that the animal was one from which
virgin parchment or virgin vellum could be prepared.

That is called virgin, says the *Book of True Black Magic*, which is
made from animals that have never engendered, males above all, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130.md)--from which definition it is obvious
that recourse

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

to the professional tanner might jeopardise the entire injunction. But
seeing that every operation undertaken in the Art assumed a religious
aspect, the slaughter of the animal became a sacrifice <span
id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) and had its accompanying ceremonies,
prayers and invocations, each ritual possessing its own variants.

The preparation of the virgin parchment is given as follows in the
*Grimorium Verum*: <span id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_132.md)--

CONCERNING THE VICTIM OF THE ART <span id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_133.md)

Take your kid; place it on a block with the throat turned upward, so
that it may be easier for you to cut it; be ready with your knife, and
cut the throat at a single stroke, pronouncing the name of the Spirit
whom you wish to invoke. For example, say: *I slay thee, N, in the name
and to the honour of N*. . . . Have a care that two blows be not needed,
but let it die at the first; then skin it with the knife, and while
skinning it make the following

INVOCATION

ADIRAM, DALMAY, LAUDAY, TETRAGRAMMATON, ANERETON, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[4](#fn_134.md)

and all ye holy angels of God, be ye here and deign to impart

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

virtue unto this skin, that it may be properly conserved, and that all
things thereon written may attain their perfection.

After the skinning, take salt well pounded; stretch the skin; strew your
salt upon it so as to cover the whole surface. But first let the salt be
blest in the following manner:--

EXORCISM OF THE SALT

I exorcise thee, creature of salt, by the living, God, by the God of
gods and the Lord of lords, that all illusions may depart from thee, and
that so thou mayst serve to make the virgin chart.

BENEDICTION OF THE SALT

God of gods and Lord of lords, Who hast created all things out of
nothing, and hast especially designed salt for human health, bless ✠
*and sanctify this salt, and may I so use it that all things which are
in this circle may receive the required virtue for that effect which we
desire. Amen*.

This ended, place your salted skin in the rays of the sun for the space
of one day. Then prepare a vessel of glazed clay and write the
characters of Guland and Surgat (Chap. III. Sec. 2) about it with the
pen and ink of the Art. Set quicklime slaked with exorcised water in the
pot, and while it is liquid place your skin therein, and so leave it
till it peels of itself. When the hair is ready to fall at the touch of
a finger, take it from the pot and peel it with a knife of hazel-wood,
over which you have pronounced these words: *Host Holy* ABOEZRA*, be
pleased to impart such virtue unto this wood that I may cleanse this
skin therewith, through Thy Holy Name* AGASON*. Amen*.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

This done, and the skin being also cleansed, stretch the same upon a
board of new wood, and round about it set stones of the same length as
the sides of the skin. But first say over them the prayer which here
follows

PRAYER

O ADONAY, *most strong and powerful God, grant that these stones may
stretch this skin, and do Thou remove from them all illusion, so that by
Thy power they may possess the virtue which we desire. Amen*.

This done, the skin may be left to dry, but before quitting it recite
the following

PRAYER

JE, AGLA, JOD, HOI, HE, EMMANUEL, *be ye guardians of this parchment or
skin, so that no phantoms may possess it*.

This finished, leave it in the air until it be dried, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) taking care that the place is clean and
has been asperged while reciting the following holy words: *In the name
of the immortal God, may God asperge thee and cleanse thee from all
delusion and from all wickedness; so shall thou be whiter than snow.
Amen*.

When the skin is dry, take it from the board, bless it with aspersion
and fumigation, and preserve it for use. It must not be seen by women,
especially in their times, for it will lose its virtue, and whosoever
makes this parchment must be, in like manner, most pure and clean and
chaste. Let him say a Mass of the Nativity, whether it be the day of the
Feast or another

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

day, and note that all the instruments must be generally on the
Altar. <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)

The Book of True Black Magic reproduces with further variations the
process of the genuine Clavicle:--Secure the animal which is to furnish
the parchment in a secret place, where no one dwells or can behold it.
Then take a virgin rod; shape it into the form of a knife with the
white-handled Knife of the Art, paring it neatly of all branches. Over
this say: *I conjure thee, Rod, by the Creator of the Universe and the
King of Angels, Whose name is* HELSADAY! <span
id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) *Receive thou power and virtue to skin
this animal for the making of the parchment, that so all things which I
shall write thereon may prosper, by God Almighty, Who liveth and
reigneth for ever and ever. Amen*. When shaping this knife recite the
Psalm *Deus, judicium tuum Regi da*. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_138.md) Then write these words upon the Rod:
AGLA, ADONAY, ELOE, <span id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_139.md) *may the work
of this wooden Knife be accomplished by you!* Say also over it: CARA,
CHERNA, SITO, CIRNA. <span id="fr_141"></span>[5](#fn_140.md) Next, skin
the animal with the same wooden knife, saying: ADIRAM, DAHNAY, SADAY,
TETRAGRAMMATON, ANERETON, ANERETON, CURETON, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[6](#fn_141.md) *Holy Angels of God, be ye present and
give virtue to this parchment. May it be consecrated by you, and thus
may all things which shall be written therein acquire the virtue needful
for the attainment of the desired end*. . . .

When you have skinned it, take salt and say over it: *God of gods,
vouchsafe to bless and sanctify this salt, so that it may cleanse the
parchment which I am about to prepare therewith, and that both may
obtain virtue, power and effect*. . . . Salt the

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

skin and set it in the sun for fifteen days; next take a pot of glazed
clay and write these characters about it; place a large

 

<span id="img_17500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/17500.jpg.md)

 

piece of quicklime with some blessed water in this vessel, and when the
lime is slaked, steep the skin for the space of nine whole days therein,
after which it must be extracted and scraped with a wooden knife to
remove the hair. Let it dry for eight days in the shade, but when
setting it to dry, asperge it and say: *In the Name of the Great Eternal
God, I asperge thee. Be thou cleansed from all vice and iniquity*!
\[When dry\] perfume it with sweet-smelling herbs; wrap it in the silken
cloth with the other instruments of the Art; and take notice that if it
be seen by a woman in her times, it will lose all its virtue.

But if this kind of parchment be too difficult to prepare, <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) take virgin parchment of any animal;
exorcise it as before; place lighted coal in a new glazed pot; mix good
perfumes therewith; and hold your parchment above the vessel to receive
them. Before all, however, write these characters about the pot <span
id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_143.md)

 

<span id="img_17501"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/17501.jpg.md)

 

with the instruments of the Art. So long as the fumigation goes on, say:
*Angels of God, be my help, and by you be my work accomplished*! . . .
When it is finished, say: LAZAY, SALMAY, DALMAY, ANEPATON, CENDRION,
ANITOR, ENCHEION, <span id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_144.md)

Holy Angels of God, be ye present and

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

give virtue to this parchment, so that it may in turn acquire that of
all characters with which it shall be inscribed, by the help of the
pious and merciful God. . . . Recite the *Psalms Deus, judicium tuum
Regi da* and *Laudate Dominum omnes gentes*, adding the following

CONJURATION

I conjure thee, creature of parchment, by all the names of God, that
nothing which shall be written within thee may ever be blotted from
truth.

Lastly, asperge it and place it in the silken cloth, as above.

The *Grimorium Verum* indulges the weak pupil by a further
simplification, as follows:--If you are unable to prepare the parchment
yourself, buy a new one and conjure it; asperge also and fumigate it
three times. The sacrifice, with its delays and unpleasantness, is thus
abrogated, and the operator can proceed at once to the practical mystery
of the *Sanctum Regnum*. It would also appear that parchment or vellum
proper may be dispensed with in favour of:--(*a*.) The skin of some
other animal, which would, however, involve a like process; or (*b*.)
the caul of a new-born child, which would, of course, possess the
requisite virgin character, and was simply consecrated according to the
following instructions, as found in *True Black Magic*. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md)

When you have succeeded in obtaining the caul of a newborn child,
perfume the same with sweet odours and sprinkle it, after which say the
following Psalms: *Domine, exaudi oratiomem meam, and Domine, Deus meus,
respice in me*, with the conjuration hereunto attached:--BOSMELETIC,
JEYSMY, ETH,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

HODOMOS, BELUREOS. *O Lord, Who didst make all things in wisdom; Who
didst choose Abraham, Thy first believer, and his seed hath multiplied
like the stars of heaven; Who didst appear unto Moses, Thy servant,
surrounded with flaming fire, and didst make known to him Thy names,
which are* HEIE, ACER, HEIE <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](bcm49.htm#fn_146.md)*--that is to say, I am that I
am; Who didst also lead forth Thy people dry-shod over the Red Sea; Who
unto Moses, Thy servant, didst give the Law of Salvation on Mount Sinai;
Who unto Solomon didst impart wisdom above the measure of men: I humbly
adore Thy majesty and beseech Thy mercy, praying Thee to consecrate this
skin by Thy virtue, O Most Holy* ADONAY*, Whose reign endureth for ever.
Amen*.

Asperge the caul with the blessed water of the Art, place it in the
silken cloth, and when working the exorcisms, the requisitions made to
the spirits must be written on this skin, which should be fumigated with
stinking odours.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[170:1](bcm48.htm#fr_131.md) The *Key of Solomon*,
Book ii. c. 17, distinguishes between virgin parchment and unborn
parchment; the latter is obtained from an animal which has been taken
before its time from the womb of its mother.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[171:1](bcm48.htm#fr_132.md) It is fair to state
that there is a form of evocation given in the *Vocabulaire Infernal* in
which a sacrifice *per se* is prescribed. The source from which it is
derived is not cited. "Whosoever would evoke the devil must sacrifice to
him a dog, a cat and a hen; these animals must be the property of the
operator, who must also pledge himself to eternal fidelity and
obedience, and must receive a special mark upon his body impressed by
the devil himself. His recompense is an absolute control over three
infernal spirits, respectively of earth, water and air." Some obscure
demonologist is most likely the authority for this process, which is
unknown to the Grimoires. It should be added that the *Vocabulaire
Infernal* was compiled in the Catholic interest--though it looks as if
that interest had been in traffic with Satan.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[171:2](bcm48.htm#fr_133.md) This preparation
being one of the most important preliminaries of Goëtic Art, will be
given with all its variations as they are found in the four chief
Grimoires. For the sacrificial Portions of the *Grand Grimoire* and that
of Honorius, see Chapters VI. and VII.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[171:3](bcm48.htm#fr_134.md) The process in the
*Grimorium Verum* is an adaptation of that in the *Key of Solomon*.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[171:4](bcm48.htm#fr_135.md) The English edition
of the Clavicle reads, *Zohar, Zip, Talmaï, Adonai, Shaddai,
Tetragrammaton*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[173:1](bcm48.htm#fr_136.md) Which should be in
the space of three days, according to the Clavicle.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[174:1](bcm48.htm#fr_137.md) The *Grimorium Verum*
exhibits the transition of the Rituals from the purely Jewish elements
of the *Key of Solomon* to the purely Christian materials of the
Grimoire of Honorius.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[174:2](bcm48.htm#fr_138.md) *i.e.*, *El Shaddai*.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[174:3](bcm48.htm#fr_139.md) Psalm lxxi. of the
Vulgate.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[174:4](bcm48.htm#fr_140.md) *i.e.*, *Elohim*, or
*Eloah*.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[174:5](bcm48.htm#fr_141.md) These words are
peculiar to the Grimoire, and their significance is beyond conjecture.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[174:6](bcm48.htm#fr_142.md) See Note on [p.
171](#page_171.md).

<span id="fn_142"></span>[175:1](bcm48.htm#fr_143.md) The shorter process
is not so good, says the Clavicle.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[175:2](bcm48.htm#fr_144.md) The *Key of Salomon*
provides characters for the parchment but not for the pot. They are,
moreover, entirely different.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[175:3](bcm48.htm#fr_145.md) The *Key of Solomon*
reads: *Zazaii, Zalmaii, Dalmaï, Adonai, Anaphaxeton, Cedrion, Cripon,
Prion, Anaireton, Elion, Octinomon, Zevanion, Alazaion, Zideon, Agla,
On, Yod Be Vau He, Artor, Dinotor*.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[176:1](bcm48.htm#fr_146.md) The *Key of Solomon*
merely observes that the cauls of newly-born children, duly consecrated,
way be used instead of virgin parchment, and that paper, satin, or silk
may also be employed in operations of less importance.
