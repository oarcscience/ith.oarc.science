### § 4. The Grimoire of Honorius

Despite the iniquities of the *Pacta Conventa Dæmonum*, the *Grand
Grimoire* has failed, however, to invoke upon itself such severe
condemnation as the *Grimoire of Honorius the Great*, otherwise Honorius
the Third. It is scarcely too much to say that almost every accusation
preferred against this remarkable work is false generally and
specifically, the chief distinction between them being that some are the
misrepresentations of ignorance and others the false interpretations of
prejudgment. The French occultist, Papus, alone seems to take the middle
view, though he speaks with some vagueness when

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

he says that the sorcery of this Grimoire is more dangerous for weak
experimentalists than for the enemies of the sorcerer. Éliphas Lévi
observes that the work is not without importance for the students of
occult science. <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) At first sight it
seems to be nothing but a tissue of repulsive absurdities, but for those
who are initiated in the signs and secrets of the Kabalah, it is said
that it becomes a veritable monument of human perversity. There was
seldom a statement for which there was less foundation; there was never
a magical work which less connected with Kabalism; the relation in so
far as it exists, and it is confined to a few words which occur in the
Conjurations, is common to all Ceremonial Magic, and this is the one
Grimoire which is most permeated with Christian elements. Those,
however, who are well acquainted with the principles of interpretation
which obtain in the writings of Lévi, will not take a charge seriously
which depends upon the significance of Kabalistic words or signs, for it
is notorious that with the French occultist they meant many things
according to his humour, and that he did not know his subject. But
Éliphas Lévi was not contented with the general impeachment; in a later
work <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md) he elaborated a more particular
charge. In common with the *Key of Solomon*, and all the Grimoires, the
work of Honorius prescribes the sacrifice of a virgin kid, with the
object of ensuring the possession of a virgin parchment by the operator.
Now, Lévi affirms that when the "abominable author" mentions a kid, he
means really a human child. In this interpretation he has not even the
excuse of the humorous analogy which has been instituted in vulgar
English, for his acquaintance, had he any, with our language was
exceedingly slight. There is not a particle of foundation

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

for the charge; the sacrifice in the case of the *Grimoire of Honorius*
means, and can mean, no more than in the case of the *Key of Solomon*.
There was a defined purpose in connection with the slaughter of the
victim, which was the same in both instances.

So far concerning the misinterpretations of writers who pretend to some
first-hand acquaintance with the work under notice. Others who have
mentioned it within recent years have been content to follow the French
authority without examination. Thus it is that I find Mr. J. H. Slater,
in a paper read before the Bibliographical Society, and printed in its
Transactions, <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) describing this
Grimoire as an advocate of murder and all kinds of crimes. Furthermore,
he confuses it throughout with the *Grand Grimoire*.

Taking the work at first hand, the initial question concerning it is the
attribution of the authorship. From what we know of magical literature,
to say nothing of pontifical dignity, it is antecedently unlikely that
it is the work of a Roman bishop, more especially of such a bishop as
Honorius. Éliphas Lévi, who rightly sought to vindicate the Church of
his childhood, assailed, in the person of one of its sovereign pontiffs,
by an unintelligent accusation, but vindicated it badly as usual, took a
glance at the history of the time and discovered that during the
pontificate of Honorius there was an anti-pope set up by Henry IV. of
Germany, and that he was a man of evil life. He immediately conjectured
that this personage was the likely author of the objectionable Grimoire.
Again there is not a particle of evidence for such a surmise, and it is
*un bien vilain procédé*, as M. Papus might say, to increase, without
good reason, the responsibility resting upon the memory of the unhappy
prelate in question.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

If we come to the facts, they are these. The first edition of the
Grimoire is said to have appeared in 1629, and it is not likely that it
was forged much earlier than the end of the sixteenth century, being,
roughly, nine hundred years after the death of its supposed author. The
canonical Pope, it must be confessed, was a voluminous writer; his
sermons and his vast correspondence have appeared in two large volumes
at Paris, <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) under auspices which were
unlikely to admit even a contemptuous reference to the forged
constitution. There is none, accordingly, which is to be regretted from
the standpoint of bibliography. But the editor has further excluded with
the same silence another work much more reasonably attributed, and to
which no odium can attach. It is one also which is important to our
inquiry, and it is entitled *Honorii Papæ, adversus tenebrarum Principem
et ejus Angelos Conjurationes ex originale Romæ servato*, Rome, 1529.
The authenticity of this work is evidently questioned by its exclusion,
and it is impossible to speak certainly concerning it, as, on account of
its extreme rarity, few public libraries, none apparently in England,
possess an example. But it is evidently the formularies of exorcism, a
rite of the Church and possessing a considerable body of literature, to
which even a Pope of past ages might not inconceivably have contributed.
However this may be, the attribution in the one case will account for it
in the other. The book of Black Magic may be merely a perversion of the
orthodox conjurations, and if not that, is a reprisal; it is Sorcery
revenging herself on a Pope who cast out devils by representing him as
the prince of those who dealt with them.

Having said something to justify the Grimoire from groundless
condemnation, it is necessary now to add, on the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

authority of its own evidence, that it is a malicious and somewhat
clever imposture, which was undeniably calculated to deceive ignorant
persons of its period who may have been magically inclined, more
especially ignorant priests, since it pretends to convey the express
sanction of the Apostolical Seat for the operations of Infernal Magic
and Necromancy. The entire claim is set forth most curiously at the
beginning of the pseudo-constitution, and must be cited at considerable
length to convey its full force.

The Holy Apostolic Chair, unto which the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
were given by those words that Christ Jesus addressed to St. Peter: I
give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and unto thee alone
the Power of commanding the Prince of Darkness and his angels, who, as
slaves of their Master, do owe him honour, glory and obedience, by those
other words of Christ Jesus: Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
Him only shalt thou serve--hence by the Power of these Keys the Head of
the Church has been made the Lord of Hell. But seeing that until this
present the Sovereign Pontiffs have alone possessed the Power of using
invocations and commanding Spirits, His Holiness Honorius the Third,
being moved by his Pastoral care, has benignly desired to communicate
the methods and faculty of invoking and controlling Spirits to his
venerable Brethren in Jesus Christ, adding the Conjurations which must
be used in such case, the whole being contained in the Bull which here
follows.

HONORIUS,

Servant of the Servants of God, unto all and each of our venerable
Brethren of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops,
Abbots; unto all and each of our sons

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

in Jesus Christ, Priests, Deacons, Subdeacons, Acolytes, Exorcists,
Cantors, Pastors, Clerks both Secular and Regular, Health and Apostolic
Benediction. In those days when the Son of God, Saviour of the World,
generated in the fulness of time, and born, according to the flesh, of
the Race of David, did live on this earth, Whose Most Holy Name is
Jesus, before which the heavens., earth and hell do bend the knee; we
have seen with what Power He commanded demons, which Power was also
transmitted to St. Peter by that utterance: Upon this rock I will build
my Church, and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it. These
words were addressed to St. Peter as the Head and Foundation of the
Church. We then, who, by the mercy of God, and despite the Poverty of
our merit, have succeeded to the Sovereign Apostolate, and, as lawful
successor of St. Peter, have the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven committed
to our hands, desiring to communicate the Power of invoking and
commanding Spirits, which hath been reserved unto us alone, and our
Possessors did alone enjoy; wishing, I repeat, by Divine inspiration, to
share it with our venerable Brethren and dear sons in Jesus Christ, and
fearing lest in the exorcism of the Possessed, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)

they might otherwise be appalled at the frightful figures of those
rebellious angels who in sin were cast into the abyss, lest also they
should be insufficiently learned in those things which must be Performed
and observed, and that those who have been redeemed by the blood of
Jesus Christ may not be tormented by any witchcraft or possessed by the
demon, we have included in this Bull the manner of their invocation,
which same must be observed inviolably. And because it is meet that the
ministers of the Altar should have authority over the rebellious
Spirits, we hereby depute unto them all

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

powers which we possess, in virtue of the Holy Apostolic Chair, and we
require them, by our Apostolic authority, to observe what follows
inviolably, lest by some negligence unworthy of their character they
should draw down on themselves the wrath of the Most High.

The *Grimorium Verum* has once been reprinted in the French
language. <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) Of the Italian version
there have been two modern editions, both poorly produced. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) The book of *True Black Magic* is known
only by the edition of 1750. The *Grand Grimoire* reappeared at Nismes
in 1823 and is, moreover, in all respects identical with the work
entitled the *Red Dragon*, of which there are several examples. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60.md) The *Grimoire of Honorius* is exceedingly
rare in the original, but is better known by the reprints of 1660 and
1670, though these also are scarce. There is, finally, an edition dated
1760, and this even commands a high price among collectors. It remains
to state that the Abbé d'Artigny was presented about the middle of the
last century with an MS. copy of this Grimoire, which was much more
complete that the printed editions. He gives no satisfactory account of
it, nor can it be traced at this day. Possibly it represented the
transition of the *Sworn Book of Honorius* into the Spurious Papal
Constitution, which certainly reproduces the motive and moves in the
atmosphere of its prototype.
