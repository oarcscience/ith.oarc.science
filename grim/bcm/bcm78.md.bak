### § 8. Concerning the Three Rings of Solomon, Son of David

One more experiment, which is only incidentally connected with Black
Magic, may be cited here, as the complement of those given in the
preceding sections. It is scarcely a complete process and is not
intelligible as it stands in the *Grimorium Verum*, where the characters
on which it depends are omitted. The scheme presupposes that the
operator is in possession of a talisman inscribed with the Pentacles of
Solomon, <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) when it is open to him to
proceed in accordance with the following directions:--

Compose your circle, but before entering therein, perfume it with musk,
amber, aloes-wood and incense. When invoking, the perfume should be
incense only. Take care also that

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

you have fire whensoever you make invocation, and fumigate only in the
name of the Spirit whom you would call. When placing perfume on the
fire, say: *I burn this N. in the name and to the honour of N*. When
invoking, see that you hold the invocation in the left hand, having the
rod of elder <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_277.md) in your right, while
the ladle <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_278.md) and knife should be at
your feet. These things being arranged, place yourself within the
circle; if accompanied, your companions should hold each other by one
hand. When within, trace the circle with the Knife of the Art, and take
up the rods one after the other, saying the Fiftieth Psalm, namely,
*Miserere mei*. The circle being composed, perfume and sprinkle the same
with holy water. Then write the characters at the four corners; let the
Spirit be forbidden in formal terms to enter, after which begin the
invocations, which must be repeated seven successive times. When the
Spirit shall have appeared, cause him to sign the character which you
hold in your hands, promising to come always at your call. Ask for
whatsoever you deem suitable, and you shall be satisfied. Dismiss him
with these words: *Go in peace unto your places, and peace be with you
until you return at my call. In the name, &c. Amen*.
