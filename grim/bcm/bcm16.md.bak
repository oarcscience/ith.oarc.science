### § 4. The Almadel

I shall explain in the first place that this scheme of invocation
derives its title from the conventional talisman on which

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

the process depends. It is made of white wax, and is inscribed as
hereinafter appears.

This figure is used for the four chief angels whose government extends
over the four altitudes of the world, namely, East, West, North and
South. It serves also for their ministers and inferiors. As, however, a
different colour is attributed to the choir of each quarter, and as this
colour must dye the white wax, it follows that those who would traffic
with the entire hierarchy must compose four *Almadels*. Their labour,
moreover, will not end here, for each talisman must have four candles
made from the same wax and set apart thereto. Finally, there must be
provided a seal of gold or silver, on which must be engraved the names
HELION, HELLUJON, ADONAI. It serves for all the choirs. The candles are
provided

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

with waxen feet, and the Almadel rests thereon, being a four-square
figure measuring six inches every way. The colour for the Eastern choir
is lily white; the others are red, green, and apparently a darkling
green which approaches black, but only the first choir is allocated to
its distinct quarter of the heaven. The names of the Intelligences are
as follows:--

FIRST ALTITUDE: *Alimiel, Gabriel, Borachiel, Lebes, Hellison*. They
make all things fruitful in creation.

SECOND ALTITUDE: *Alphariza, Genon, Geron, Armon, Gereinon*. They have
power over goods and riches, and can make any man rich or poor. They
also cause decrease and barrenness.

THIRD ALTITUDE: *Eliphamasai, Gelomiros, Gedobonai, Saranana, Elomnia*.
Their offices are not stated.

FOURTH ALTITUDE: *Barchiel, Gediel, Gebiel, Deliel, Captiel*. In this
case also the offices are not stated.

When an Angel of the First Altitude responds to invocation, he carries a
banner emblazoned with a white cross, his body is clothed about with a
luminous cloud, and he is crowned with roses. He is fair of face, and at
his departure leaves a sweet perfume. An Angel of the Second Altitude
has the form of a young child in rose-coloured satin, with a crown of
red gillyflowers on his head. His face looks towards heaven, and shines
with the light of the sun. The perfume which he leaves endures for a
long time. An Angel of the Third Altitude appears in the form of a child
or little woman in green and silver colours, wearing a crown of bay
leaves beset with white flowers. This apparition also leaves sweet
perfume. An Angel of the Fourth Altitude appears in the form of a boy or
little man, in black or olive garments, crowned with ivy berries. His
perfume differs from the rest, but is not

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

less sweet: all the manifestations are beautiful, and, as it is said
that they must not be called for anything against God and His laws, it
is only the too certain company in which the *Almadel* appears that
renders its operations doubtful--I mean, in respect of their intention.

Invocation takes place on a Sunday in the day and hour of the sun. The
candles are placed in the candlesticks; the *Almadel* rests--as we have
seen--on the projecting feet of the candles, but so that there is a
clear space beneath it. There is a hole in each corner, and when the
intelligence is about to manifest, an earthen vessel is placed under the
talisman containing hot ashes and three grains of mastic in powder. The
smoke generated passes through the holes, and when it is smelt by the
Angel it is said that he begins to speak.

I should explain, however, that the furniture of the oratory and the
vestments worn by the operator must be of the same colour as the
*Almadel*. The candles are lighted at the inception, the golden seal is
placed in the middle of the talisman, and the Invocant kneels down,
holding the Prayer at Calling, which must be written on virgin
parchment. The apparition manifests over the *Almadel*, at first in the
form of a mist. This Clears gradually, and when the incense rises the
face of the Angel is turned towards the operator, who is asked in a low
voice why the Princes of the particular Choir or Altitude have been thus
called. The answer is: "I desire that all my requests may be granted and
that which I pray for accomplished, for it appears and is declared by
your office that the same is possible to you, if it please God." The
particulars are enumerated without fear and without disrespect.

It would seem on the surface of the text as if no preliminary invocation
were needed for this work, but that is the

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

confusion of the Ritual which relegates it to the end and to a distinct
part of the process.

THE PRAYER AT CALLING

Thou great, mighty and blessed angel of God N., who rulest as the chief
and first governing Angel in the first choir or altitude in the East,
under the great Prince of the East whom you obey, who also is set over
you as King by the Divine Power of God, ADONAI*,* HELOMI*,* PINE*, Who
is the disposer of all things in heaven, earth and hell: I, the servant
of that God,* ADONAI*,* HELOMI*,* PINE*, Whom you obey, do invoke,
conjure and entreat thee, N., that thou wilt appear forthwith. By the
virtue and power of the same God I do command thee from thine order or
place of abode to come unto me and skew thyself plainly here before me
in thine own proper shape and glory, speaking in a voice intelligible to
mine understanding. O thou mighty and blessed Angel N., I, the servant
of the same thy God, do entreat and humbly beseech thee to come and shew
unto me all things that I shall desire of thee, subject to the power of
thine office and the good Pleasure of the Lord our God. By the three
names of the true God,* ADONAI*,* HELOMI*,* PINE*, and by the name* ANA
BONA*, I beseech and constrain thee forthwith to appear visibly in thy
proper shape, speaking in my ears audibly, that I may have thy blessed,
angelical and glorious assistance, familiar friendship, constant
society, communication and instruction, now and at all times, herein and
in all truths which the Almighty God, King of Kings, Giver of all good
gifts, shall be graciously pleased to bestow on me. Therefore, O thou
blessed Angel N., be friendly unto me, do for me as God hath empowered
thee, whereunto I now adjure thee to appear it; power and presence, that
I may sing with His Holy Angels* O MAPPA LAMAN, HALLELUJAH. AMEN.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

When he appears, says the Ritual, *give him a kind entertainment; ask
what is lawful, possible and becoming to his office; and you shall
obtain it*. If, however, he should fail to appear, the four candles must
be marked with the gold or silver seal, which apparently will ensure
obedience.

There are, however, certain planetary considerations connected with this
process, on which its success depends. The two first Angels of the First
Altitude can only be called on the first and second Sunday in March; the
third and fourth on the Sundays in April; the fifth after the sun has
entered Gemini in May. And so of the rest in succession.
