### Footnotes

<span id="fn_189"></span>[199:1](bcm55.htm#fr_190.md) The seventh spirit of
the *Pseudo-Monarchia*. He is also an exponent of ethics.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[199:2](bcm55.htm#fr_191.md) Otherwise, *Gusayn*,
the eighth spirit of Wierus, and *Pirsoyn*, according to the variant of
another MS.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[199:3](bcm55.htm#fr_192.md) *Jussus secreta
libenter detegit feminarum, eas ridens ludificansque ut se luxorise
nudent*.--*Wierus*.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[199:4](bcm55.htm#fr_193.md) Otherwise, *Byleth*.
Some codices give considerable space to this demon and the precautions
to be taken concerning him.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[200:1](bcm55.htm#fr_194.md) He yet hopes to be
restored to the Seventh Thrones--"which is not altogether credible,"
according to one of the versions.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[200:2](bcm55.htm#fr_195.md) Alternatively, he
procures the favour of lords and knights.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[201:1](bcm55.htm#fr_196.md) The last statement is
on the authority of Wierus. According to another reading, *Zepar* makes
women barren.
