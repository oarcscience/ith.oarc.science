II\. Gives the love and complaisance of the entire female sex. It should
be embroidered in silver on black satin. The evoking words are NADES,
SURADIS, MANINER, pronounced with the ring-which should be on the middle
finger of the left hand-pressed against the lips. This conjuration
ensures the manifestation of a genius with rose-coloured wings, who, if
addressed with the words SADER, PROSTAS, SOLASTER, Will traverse all
space to transport you the lady of your heart, though she were the queen
of the Caliph's seraglio. At the words MAMMES, LAHER, she will be
removed by four slaves. It will be observed that this is occult
ribaldry.

*The characters should be graven on the inner side of the Ring*.

III\. Discovers all treasures and ensures their possession. The figure
of the talisman should be embroidered in gold upon green satin. The
words ONAÏM, PERANTÈS, RASONASTOS, will cause the appearance of seven
genii *au teint bazané*, each of whom will pour out golden ducats from
great bags of bide at the feet of the sorcerer, the operations of this
Grimoire being performed upon a huge scale. *Item*, a black hooded bird
will be perched upon the shoulder of each spirit.
