### § 6. Concerning the Silken Cloth <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)

When all the instruments belonging to the Art have been properly
consecrated and exorcised, they must be gathered into a costly cloth of
silk, as Solomon ordains-says the testament whereby they may be
preserved clean and pure and may thus be more efficacious. So it be not
black or brown, the colour is indifferent, but the following characters
must be written upon it in pigeon's blood with the male goose-quill
proper to the Art.

Add these names: ADONAY, AMMASTIUS, ANARETON, COSBOS, ELOYM. Then
fumigate and asperge, reciting subsequently the Psalms *Domine, Dominus
noster, Deus Judicium tuum Regi da and Ecce nunc dimittis*. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_129.md) Place, lastly, all the magical
instruments in this silken cloth. "So shalt thou use them at will and
shalt learn their effect," says the Magus, Iroë-Grego. But the pledge
has a savour of the salt which is called prudence.
