<P>The candles used in evocation or in other magical experiences, and the images required for bewitchment, must be composed of virgin wax or virgin earth--that is to say, the substances in question must not have been applied previously to another purpose.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Before operating the following words must be recited over the material:--ENTABOR, NATABOR, <I>Si tacibor</I>, ADONAY, AN, LAYAMON, TINARMES, EOS PHILODES.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>Angels Of God, be ye present! I invoke you in my work, that I may obtain virtue by your mediation and may be perfected very surely</I>. Then recite the Psalms <I>Domine, non est exaltatum cor meum and Domine, quis habitabit</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> adding these words: <I>I exorcise thee, creature of wax</I> [<I>or earth</I>], <I>and, by the Creator and God Almighty, Who created all things from nothing by His Most Holy Name, and by His angels, I ordain thee to receive virtue and benediction in His Name, that so thou mayst be sanctified and blessed, thus obtaining that virtue which we desire, by the Most Holy Name </I>ADONAY<I>, which is the life of all creatures, Amen</I>. Asperge the substance with the holy water of the Art, after which preserve it, to make use thereof when needed. So doing, says <I>True Black Magic</I>, thou shalt obtain a sure result in all which thou undertakest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></P>

<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="bcm46.htm#fr_125">168:2</A> The virginity of the wax and the earth is more perfectly ensured by the directions of the <I>Key of Solomon</I>, in accordance with which the operator must dig up the earth with his own hands and reduce it to a paste, using no instrument in case of defilement. The wax must be taken from bees who have made it for the first time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="bcm46.htm#fr_126">168:3</A> These names differ from those in the <I>Key of Solomon</I>, which, however, are, for the most part, equally unintelligible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_126"></A><A HREF="bcm46.htm#fr_127">168:4</A> Ps. cxxx. and Ps. xiv. in the Vulgate.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_127"></A><A HREF="bcm46.htm#fr_128">168:5</A> The <I>Key of Solomon</I> directs that the earth should be freshly dug up on each occasion that it is required.</P>
