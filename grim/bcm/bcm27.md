IV\. Discovers the most hidden secrets and enables its Possessor to
penetrate everywhere unseen. The talisman

should be of violet satin, with the figures embroidered in silver. It
must be held in the left hand, on which also the ring should be worn,
and should be placed close to the ear, pronouncing the words NITRÆ,
RADOU, SUNANDAM, when a distinct voice will utter the desired mystery.

V. Will make the most taciturn man unbosom himself to its possessor,
whose enemies will also be forced to confess all their machinations. The
talisman should be of gold-coloured satin with the figures embroidered
in gold. By placing the ring on the little finger of the left hand, the
talisman against the right ear, and by pronouncing the words NOCTAR,
RAIBAN, the most discreet man--as I have indicated--will be compelled to
unveil his utterly secret thoughts. The addition of the word

\[paragraph continues\] BRANTHER will force the enemies of the possessor
to declare their projects aloud.
