# CHAPTER II

## The Initial Rites and Ceremonies

### § 1. Concerning the Virtues of the Planets

THE *Key of Solomon the King* is the only ordinary Magical Ritual which
regulates the operations of Magical Art in accordance with a formal
attribution of certain hours in the day and night to the rule and
influence of certain planets, while the Book of *True Black Magic* is
the only Goëtic Grimoire which follows the Clavicle closely in this as
in other respects. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90) The directions
given are, however, exceedingly confused. The common attribution of the
seven days to the seven planets obtains in both cases, and is set out in
the Grimoire as follows: <span id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91)--

|        |           |     |              |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| Solday | = Saturn  | = ♄ | = Saturday.  |
| Zedex  | = Jupiter | = ♃ | = Thursday.  |
| Madime | = Mars    | = ♂ | = Tuesday.   |
| Zemen  | = Sol     | = ☉ | = Sunday.    |
| Hogos  | = Venus   | = ♀ | = Friday.    |
| Cocao  | = Mercury | = ☿ | = Wednesday. |
| Zeveac | = Moon    | = ☽ | = Monday.    |

 

But as there is inequality in the length of the days, says the
Grimoire--that is to say, the comparative duration of day

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

and night varies in accordance with the times of sunrise and sunset--so
also the hours of the planets are unequal. When the day is, say, fifteen
hours in length, to ascertain how many minutes compose an hour of the
planet, multiply the fifteen hours by five; the result is seventy-five,
and as many minutes will form the hour of the planet of that day. The
corresponding hours of the night are nine; these multiplied by five
produce forty-five, and as many minutes will form the hour of the planet
of the night. The same method may be followed through all seasons of the
year.

But in any given day of twenty-four hours the number of minutes is 1440,
as against 1530 in the above computation, and the method is therefore
absurd. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92) The attribution accepted by
all writers on Natural Magic, and corresponding with the angelical
succession in Peter de Abano, will be found in the following:--

It will be seen from this table that there is a recurring rule of the
planets in unbroken succession through the whole week, after which the
sequence recommences in the same order, each planet ruling the first and
the eighth of the day hours and the third and the tenth of the night
hours of the day referred to that planet. These constitute the planetary
hours.

The *Book of Black Magic*, still following and confusing the statements
of the Clavicle, <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93) lays down that the
hours of Saturn, Mars and Venus are good for communion with spirits; the
hour of Saturn serves for invoking souls in hell, and to have news of
those who have died naturally. The souls of those who have been slain
should be invoked in the hour and also on the day of Mars. It adds that
experiments made faithfully and with great diligence, observing all that
is laid down, will be invariably verified, but to fail over the smallest
part will void perfection in any.

The hours of Saturn and of Mars are also good for preparation, on those
days when they are in conjunction with the Moon, or indeed with one
another. <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94) In a contrary or quadrate
aspect

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

they are good for experiences of hatred, lawsuits, enmities, discords
and so forth. The hours of the Sun, Jupiter and Venus, especially their
planetary hour, are favourable both to ordinary and extraordinary
experiments not included in those already mentioned. Those of the Moon
are especially suited to the conjuration of spirits, works of
necromancy, and the finding of stolen goods; but the luminary must be
collocated and in a terrestrial sign-that is to say, (in conjunction)
with Mercury for love, favours and invisibility; for works of hatred and
discord in a sign belonging to the fiery triplicity--Aries, Leo,
Sagittarius; for extraordinary experiences in an aquatic sign--Cancer,
Scorpio, or Pisces. Should, however, the observation of these rules seem
over-difficult, "do this only"--see that the Moon waxing is in an equal
number of degrees with the Sun; it is then very good for the performance
of the above experiments. When the full Moon is in opposition to the
Sun, it is excellent for warlike, riotous and discordant experiments; in
its last quarter it favours works which deal directly with operations of
destruction and ruin. The best time for the experiences of death and
invisibility is when the Moon is almost deprived of light.

When the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun nothing must be undertaken,
because it is an unfortunate time and all things fail therein; but when
in its crescent period, acuated with light, any experiences may be
prepared and any writings and operations accomplished, especially for
conversing with spirits. It must, however, be the day of Mercury and in
the hour of that planet, the Moon being in an earthly or aërial sign, as
above said, and in a pair number with the Sun. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[150:1](bcm42.htm#fr_90) It should be observed.
however, that favourable days and hours are occasionally mentioned, but
there is no attempt at a systematic valuation of the times and seasons
suitable to different operations.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[150:2](bcm42.htm#fr_91) The apparently
barbarous names given in the table are corruptions of Hebrew words, and
the English editor of *The Key of Solomon* has restored their proper
orthography, as follows: *Shabbathai, Tzedek, Madim, Shemesh, Nogah,
Cochab, Lebanah*.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[151:1](bcm42.htm#fr_92) It offers no analogy
with the system set forth in the Clavicle, nor can it be definitely
traced to any magical authority within my knowledge.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[152:1](bcm42.htm#fr_93) In the version that
follows, which condenses and summarises the original, there is an
attempt to reduce them to order, and to make them consistent, if not
intelligible.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[152:2](bcm42.htm#fr_94) The *Key of Solomon*
says that the hours of Saturn and of Mars, and also the days in which
the Moon is in conjunction with these planets, are admirable for
experiments of hatred, enmity and discord. It will be seen in what sense
this farrago of villainous nonsense can be regarded as on God's side, as
its impossible English editor would doubtless wish us to believe.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[153:1](bcm42.htm#fr_95) The attribution in the
original is throughout this portion not only erroneous, but seems to
involve impossible positions. It has been corrected partially, in
accordance with the Clavicle.
