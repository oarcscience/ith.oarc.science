Very Powerful Conjuration for all days and hours of the Day or Night,
being for Treasures hidden by men or Spirits, that the same may be

I command you, O all ye demons dwelling in these Parts, or in what Part
of the world soever ye may be, by whatsoever Power may have been given
you by God and our holy Angels over this place, by the Powerful
Principality of the infernal abysses, as also by all your brethren, both
general and special demons, whether dwelling in the East, West, South or
North, or in any side of the earth, and, in like manner, by the power of
God the Father, by the wisdom of God the Son, by the virtue of the Holy
Ghost, by the authority I derive from our Saviour Jesus Christ, the only
Son of the Almighty and the Creator, Who made us and all creatures from
nothing, Who also ordains that you do hereby abdicate all Power to
guard, habit and abide in this Place; by Whom further I constrain and
command you, nolens volens

, without guile or deception, to declare me your names and to leave me
in peaceable possession and rule

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

over this Place, of whatsoever legion you be and of whatsoever part of
the world; by order of the Most Holy Trinity and by the merits of the
Most Holy and Blessed Virgin, as also of all the saints, I unbind you
all, spirits who abide in this place, and I drive you to the deepest
infernal abysses. Thus: Go, all Spirits accursed, who are condemned to
the flame eternal which is Prepared for you and your companions, if ye
be rebellious and disobedient. I conjure you by the same authority, I
exhort and call you, I constrain and command you, by all the Powers of
your superior demons, to come, obey and reply positively to what I
direct you, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Whence, if you or they do not
obey promptly and without tarrying, I will shortly increase your
torments for a thousand years in hell. I constrain you therefore to
appear here in comely human shape, by the Most High Names of God, HAIN,
LON, HILAY, SABAOTH, HELIM, RADISHA, LEDIEHA, ADONAY, JEHOVA, YAH,
TETRAGRAMMATON, SADAI, MESSIAS, AGIOS, ISCHYROS, EMMANUEL, AGLA*, Jesus
Who is* ALPHA *and* OMEGA*, the beginning and the end, that you be
justly established in the fire, having no Power to reside, habit or
abide in this Place henceforth; and I require your doom by the virtue of
the said Names, to wit, that St. Michael drive you to the uttermost of
the infernal abyss, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost. So be it*.

I conjure thee, Acham*, or whomsoever thou mayest be, by the Most Holy
Names of God, by* MALHAME, JAE, MAY, MABRON, JACOB, DASMEDIAS, ELOY,
ATERESTIN, JANASTARDY, FINIS, AGIOS, ISCHYROS, OTHEOS, ATHANATOS, AGLA,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

by the other Sacred Names of the most great Creator, which are or shall
hereafter be communicated to thee; hearken forthwith and immediately to
my words, observe them inviolably, as sentences of the last dreadful day
of judgment, which thou must obey inviolately, nor think to repulse me
because I am a sinner, for therein shall thou repulse the commands of
the Most High God. Knowest thou not that thou art bereft of thy powers
before thy Creator and ours? Think therefore what thou refusest, and
pledge therefore thine obedience, swearing by the said last dreadful day
of judgment and by Him Who hath created all things by His word, Whom all
creatures obey. P. per sedem Baldarey et per gratiam et diligentiam tuam
habuisti ab eo hanc nalatimanamilam*, as I command thee*. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[286:1](bcm70.htm#fr_266.md) This is in opposition
to the higher counsels of the averse art, which enjoins a certain
reverence in addressing the lost angels, presumably on account of what
they were.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[287:1](bcm70.htm#fr_267.md) Otherwise,
*Nambroth*.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[292:1](bcm70.htm#fr_268.md) Otherwise, *Nabam*.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[293:1](bcm70.htm#fr_269.md) Otherwise, *Aquiel*.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[296:1](bcm70.htm#fr_270.md) It is impossible to
restore the Latin so that it shall possess an intelligible and
constructive sense.
