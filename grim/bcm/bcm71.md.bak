# CHAPTER VIII

## Miscellaneous and Minor Processes

### § 1. Concerning Works of Hatred and Destruction

THE following process appears in several manuscript copies of the *Key
of Solomon*, but has been omitted by the English editor of that work, as
others are also omitted, presumably as a Goëtic interpolation. But we
have seen that a Goëtic process in a book like the *Key of Solomon* is
not necessarily an interpolation, while as regards this particular
instance it is very nearly evident that it is an integral portion of
that dubious collection. In the second chapter of the first book we are
told that the days and hours of Mars are suitable for overthrowing
enemies, while the hours of Saturn and Mars, and also the days on which
the Moon is in conjunction with those planets, are excellent for
experiments of hatred, enmity, quarrel and discord. In the first chapter
of the second book it is said:--As for operations of destruction and
desolation, we should put them into execution on the day of Saturn at
the first hour, or rather at the eighth or fifteenth of the day, and
from the first until the eighth hour of the night. . . . From these
statements it seems fair to infer that there must have been a section
containing directions as to the performance of such works. In this case,
the *Key of Solomon* is neither better nor worse than any other Grimoire
of Black Magic--as indeed we have reason to know by its admitted

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

sections. The apologists of the Clavicle--if there are any apart from
its English editor--will probably cite in defence of it a passage which
occurs in Book i. c. 8, in which the author proffers his secrets on the
express condition that they shall not be used to ruin and destroy one's
neighbour. But when every allowance has been made for this stipulation,
we shall do well to remember that similar warnings are not wanting in
purely Goëtic rituals. There is further another test by which the
authenticity of the following process may be largely determined, and
that is the manner of its wording, which corresponds closely with the
prevailing manner of the Clavicle. It is a loose and general wording,
covering several classes of experiment, and-if any one is sufficiently
ridiculous or sufficiently ultra-serious to desire that the question be
tested-it may be compared with Book I. c. xv., xvi., xvii., in which the
same characteristics will be found.

The process itself is as follows:--Experiments upon enemies may be
performed in several ways, but, whether with waxen images or some other
instrument, the particulars of each must be diligently and faithfully
observed. Should the day and hour fail thee, proceed as already laid
down, and prepare the image or instrument proper to this effect in the
order and manner thereof. Fumigate with the Proper perfumes, and if
writing be required on the image, let it be done with the needle or
stylet of the art, as aforesaid. Next recite the following words once
over the said image:--VSOR, DILAPIDATORE, TENTATORE, SOIGNATORE,
DEVORATORE, CONCITORE, ET SEDUCTORE. *O all ye ministers and companions,
I direct, conjure, constrain and command you to fulfil this behest
willingly, namely, straightway to consecrate this image, which is to be
done in the name of . . . . . . . . . that as the face of the one is
contrary to the other, so the same may never more look one upon
another*.

Deposit the image in some place perfumed with evil odours, especially
those of Mars, such as sulphur and *assafoetida*. Let it remain there
for one night, having duly asperged it, observing the proper hour and
time. Do likewise when the experiment is performed with characters and
names, by touching the lovers <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_270.md) with
words, or by whatsoever other manner. But when the experiment is made by
giving something to be eaten, the same must be performed on the day and
hour proper to this work. All things being prepared, place them before
you, and say: Where are ye, SOIGNATORE, USORE, DILAPIDATORE, and
DENTORE; CONCISORE, DIVORATORE, SEDUCTORE, and SEMINATORE? *Ye Who sow
discord, where are you? Ye who infuse hatred and propagate enmities, I
conjure you by Him who hath created you for this ministry, to fulfil
this work, in order that whensoever N.* \[*naming the person*\] *shall
eat of like things, or shall touch them, in whatsoever manner, never
shall he go in peace*.

Give then whatsoever you please to the person designated, but let it be
in the hour of Saturn or that of Mars, observing all things needful for
such experiments.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_270"></span>[299:1](bcm71.htm#fr_271.md) This means that the
experiment is for the occult consolation of a rival. It will be seen,
however, that there is a certain confusion, as the adjuration which
follows will exhibit.
