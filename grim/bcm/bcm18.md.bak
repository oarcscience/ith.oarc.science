### § 6. The Heptameron

The Fourth Book of Cornelius Agrippa was much too informal, and left too
much to the discretion of the operator, to be satisfactory for a science
so exact as that of Ceremonial Magic. A form of procedure which
bequeathed nothing to the imagination and asked no other skill than the
patient exactitude of the rule of thumb was necessary to the weakness of
the ordinary sorcerer. *The Heptameron*, or *Magical Elements* ascribed
to Peter de Abano is an attempt to supply the want and to offer to the
neophyte a complete wizard's cabinet. Cornelius Agrippa, says the
introduction, which might, ex hypothesi, be that of a later hand, seems
to have written for the learned, for the well-experienced in this art;
he does not treat specially of the ceremonies, but mentions them in a
general way. Those who have not "tasted magical superstitions" may here
find them ready to their hand. "In brief, in this book are kept the
principles of magical conveyances." It may be conceded at once that the
undertaking is scrupulously fulfilled; what the operator must do and how
he should perform it, so as to "draw spirits into discourse," are
matters set forth so plainly that the wayfaring man need not err
therein. Assuming the sacerdotal office of the operator, or a priest for
an accomplice, it is all so simple that failure could not well be
ascribed to a blunder on his part.

It would be invidious to suppose that the *Heptameron* is more authentic
as regards its attribution than the work to which it is professedly a
sequel; its real authorship is involved in much the same kind of
obscurity as that of pseudo-Agrippa. There are several grave reasons why
the pupil of Trithemius should not have written the spurious Fourth
Book, but Peter of Abano is not an unlikely personage to connect with
the

Magical

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Elements*, if it were not for a trifling
chronological disparity of about three hundred years. It is true that
Agrippa professedly wrote upon Magic, and the other upon Astrology and
Geomancy, unless his imputed works in these departments of occult
science are also forgeries; but the *Heptameron* was never heard of for
the space which I have mentioned after the death of its reputed author,
which occurred in 1316, and it is too obviously later in its tone, too
obviously a sequel <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) to a much more
recent work, for it to have been possibly a memorial of the fourteenth
century.

Peter of Abano, a town in the vicinity of Padua, was born in 1250 and
was a learned physician of his period, who attempted to conciliate the
different medical systems and is supposed to have been the first
European who quoted Averroes. He established himself at Paris, but at
the instigation of jealous professional brethren he was accused of
heresy and fled to his native place. At Padua a chair of medicine was
created for him, but the accusation followed its victim; by some he was
charged with denying the existence of demons, by others with obtaining
his knowledge from seven imps whom he kept in a bottle. However this may
be, the Inquisition instituted a process, but the designed sufferer was
delivered by death--as some say, on the eve of his execution. The
intervention infuriated the Tribunal, though the testament left behind
him by Peter of Abano affirmed his belief in the orthodox faith. The
magistrates of the city were ordered, on pain of excommunication, to
exhume his body, but it was removed by a faithful servant and buried
secretly in another church. The Inquisition clamoured for the punishment
of the offender but

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

was content in the end to burn the dead physician in effigy. As a
counterpoise, a century later his bust was placed in the town-hall of
Padua. His undoubted works, which are frankly unreadable, betray no
acquaintance with the occult sciences beyond a belief in astrology,
which in those days was catholic as Rome and powerful as the Holy
Tribunal. He remains, therefore, one of the moral martyrs of Magic,
*faussement accusé*, as Gabriel Naudé has it. His accusation and the
mode of its prosecution remain also among the lesser glories of the Holy
Office.

Accepting the *Heptameron* as a work belonging to the period of its
first publication, it is here placed among the Rituals of a composite
character, not because it professedly deals with devils, but because the
nature of its angels and spirits is indicated by the manner of their
conjuration; in a word, they are described as angels and threatened as
demons.

The procedure is divided into two parts--a general method for the
evocation of the Spirits of the Air, who are undoubtedly demons, and a
set of angelical conjurations proper to each day of the week. The second
section presumably belongs to the department of White Magic--if I may
adopt this glorious distinction in the ribaldry of a passing moment--as
the intelligences concerned are said to be good and great, though their
offices are mixed and confusing, including the discovery of treasures,
the detection of secrets, fomenting war, opening locks and bolts,
procuring the love of women, inclining men to luxury and sowing hatred
and evil thought. Obviously, White Magic of this kind is much blacker
than it is painted. Though the entire *Heptameron* appears under one
attribution, the first part only is ascribed in the text to Peter de
Abano. Therein the personal preparation of the operator corresponds to
that given in the Second Part of the present work, and the ceremonial
itself,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

which, if cited at all, would have to be printed *in extenso*, as it
contains no detachable portions, is much too elaborate to be inserted in
this place, more especially as that of the *Lemegeton* will provide
later on a fairly complete notion of the scope and purpose of the
Composite Rituals, taken in their broad aspect, and will illustrate the
fact that all conventional distinctions dissolve therein.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_42"></span>[90:1](bcm18.htm#fr_42.md) A sequel, moreover,
which contains several direct references, as, for example: "But after
what manner they appear has been described already in the former book of
magical ceremonies"--*The Conjuration of the Lord's Day*. This recurs
with slight variations throughout the *Heptameron*. It may be advisable
to add that Agrippa was of the sixteenth century.
