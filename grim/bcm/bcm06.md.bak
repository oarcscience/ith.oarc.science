### § 2. The Distinction between White and Black Magic <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

Having considered the possible standpoints from which the Rituals may be
regarded, we come now to the distinctions that are made between them,
and, first and foremost, to that which has been already mentioned and is
artificially instituted between White and Black Magic. The history of
this distinction

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

is exceedingly obscure, but there can be no question that in its main
aspect it is modern--that is to say, in so far as it depends upon a
sharp contrast between Good and Evil Spirits. In Egypt, in India and in
Greece, there was no dealing with devils in the Christian sense of the
expression; Typhon, Juggernaut and Hecate were not less divine than the
gods of the over-world, and the offices of Canidia were probably in
their way as sacred as the peaceful mysteries of Ceres.

Each of the occult sciences was, however, liable to that species of
abuse which is technically but fantastically known as Black Magic.
Astrology, or the appreciation of the celestial influences in their
operation upon the nature and life of man, could be perverted in the
composition of malefic talismans by means of those influences. Esoteric
Medicine, which consisted in the application of occult forces to the
healing of disease in man, and included a traditional knowledge of the
medicinal properties resident in some substances disregarded by ordinary
pharmacy, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) produced in its malpractice
the secret science of poisoning and the destruction of health, reason or
life by unseen forces. The transmutation of metals by Alchemy resulted
in their sophistication. In like manner, Divination, or the processes by
which lucidity was supposed to be induced, became debased into various
forms of witchcraft and Ceremonial Magic into dealing with devils. White
Ceremonial Magic is, by the terms of its definition, an attempt to
communicate with Good Spirits for a good, or at least an innocent,
purpose. Black Magic is the attempt to communicate with Evil Spirits for
an evil, or for any, purpose.

The contrasts here established seem on the surface perfectly

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

clear. When we come, however, to compare the ceremonial literature of
the two classes, we shall find that the distinction is by no means so
sharp as might be inferred from the definitions. In the first place,
so-called Theurgic Ceremonial, under the pretence of White Magic,
usually includes the Rites for the invocation of Evil Spirits. Supposing
that they are so invoked for the enforced performance of works contrary
to their nature, the issue becomes complicated at once, and White Magic
must then be defined as the attempt to communicate with Good or Evil
Spirits for a good, or at least for an innocent, purpose. This, of
course, still leaves a tolerably clear distinction, though not one that
I should admit, if I admitted the practical side of the entire subject
to anything but unconditional condemnation. Yet the alternative between
a good and an innocent object contains all the material for a further
confusion. It will be made clear as I proceed that the purposes and
ambitions of Magic are commonly very childish, so that we must
distinguish really between Black and White Magic, not as between the
essentially good and evil, but as between that which is certainly evil
and that which may only be foolish. Nor does this exhaust the
difficulty. As will also be made evident in proceeding, White Ceremonial
Magic seems to admit of a number of intentions which are objectionable,
as well as many that are frivolous. Hence it must be inferred that there
is no very sharp distinction between the two branches of the Art. It
cannot be said, even, that Black Magic is invariably and White Magic
occasionally evil. What is called Black Magic is by no means diabolical
invariably; it is almost as much concerned with preposterous and stupid
processes as the White variety with those of an accursed kind. Thus, the
most which can be stated is that the literature falls chiefly into two
classes, one of

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

which usually terms itself Black, but that they overlap one another.

In what perhaps it may be permissible to call the mind of Magic, as
distinct from the effects which are proposed by the Rituals, there has
been always a tolerable contrast between the two branches corresponding
to Magus and Sorcerer, and the fact that the ceremonial literature tends
to the confusion of the distinction may perhaps only stamp it as
garbled. But this is not to say that it has been tampered with in the
sense of having been perverted by editors. White Magic has not usually
been written down into Black; Goëtic Rituals have not been written up in
pseudo-celestial terms. They are, for the most part, naturally
composite, and it would be impossible to separate their elements without
modifying their structure.

Modern occultism has taken up the clear distinction and developed it
Appealing to the secret traditional knowledge behind the written word of
Magic--to that unmanifested science which it believes to exist behind
all science--and to the religion behind all religion, as if the two were
related or identical, it affirms that the advanced occult life has been
entered by two classes of adepts, who have been sometimes fantastically
distinguished as the Brothers of the Right and the Brothers of the Left,
transcendental good and transcendental evil being specified as their
respective ends, and in each case they are something altogether
different from what is understood conventionally by either White or
Black Magic. As might be expected, the literature of the subject does
not bear out this development, but, by the terms of the proposition,
this is scarcely to be regarded as an objection. For the rest, if many
rumours and a few questionable revelations must lead us to concede,
within certain limits, that there may have been some recrudescence of
diabolism in more than one country of Europe,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

some attempt at the present day to communicate formally with the Powers
of Darkness, it must be said that this attempt returns in its old
likeness and not invested with the sublimities and terrors of the modern
view. Parisian Diabolism, for example, in so far as it may be admitted
to exist, is the Black Magic of the Grimoire and not the sovereign
horror of the Brothers of the Left Hand Path, wearing their iniquity
like an aureole, and deathless in spiritual evil. These enigmatical
personages are, however, the creation of romance, as are also their
exalted, or at least purified, *confrères*. Between Rosicrucian
initiates of astral processes and the *amatores diaboli* there is
indubitably the bond of union which arises from one fact: *il n'y a pas
des gens plus embêtants que ces gens-là*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[13:1](bcm06.htm#fr_6.md) It should be understood
that this section contains what was said upon the subject, and seemed
then sufficient to say, in the original edition. It stands now
substantially as it then stood; the extensions are in the preface and in
the introductory part.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[14:1](bcm06.htm#fr_7.md) I am not suggesting that
the traditional knowledge was of value, but that, as a fact, it seems to
have existed.
