## CHAPTER XII

### HOW <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63) TO MAKE THE MAGIC GARTERS

TAKE enough of the skin of a stag to make two hollow tubular Garters,
but before stitching them up thou shalt write on the side of the skin
which was next the flesh the words and characters shown in *[Figure
8](kos25.htm#img_kos02)*, with the blood of a hare killed on the25th of
June, and having filled the said Garters with green mugwort gathered
also on the 25th of June before sunrise, thou shalt put in the two ends
of each the eye of the fish called barbel; and when thou shalt wish to
use them thou shalt get up before sunrise and wash them in a brook of
running water, and place them one on each leg above the knee. After this
thou shalt take a short rod of holm-oak cut on the same 25th of June,
turn in the direction thou wishest to go, write upon the ground the name
of the place, and commencing thy journey thou wilt find it accomplished
in a few days and without fatigue. When thou wishest to stop thou hast
only to say AMECH and beat the air with the aforesaid wand, and
incontinently thou shalt be on firm ground.
