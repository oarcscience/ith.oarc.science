PLATE XI.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 46.--The Third Pentacle of Mercury.--This and the following serve
to invoke the Spirits subject unto Mercury; and especially those who are
written in this Pentacle.

Editor's Note.--Mystical Characters of Mercury, and the Names of the
Angels: Kokaviel, Ghedoriah, Savaniah, and Chokmahiel.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 47.--The Fourth Pentacle of Mercury.--This is further proper to
acquire the understanding and Knowledge of all things created, and to
seek out and penetrate into hidden things; and to command those Spirits
which are called Allatori to perform embassies. They obey very readily.

Editor's Note.--In the centre is the Name of God, El. The Hebrew letters
inscribed about the dodecagram make the sentence, 'IHVH, fix Thou the
Volatile, and let there be unto the void restriction.' The versicle
is:--'Wisdom and virtue are in his house, and the Knowledge of all
things remaineth with him for ever.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Figure 48.--The Fifth and Last Pentacle of Mercury.--This commandeth the
Spirits of Mercury, and serveth to open doors in whatever way they may
be closed, and nothing it may encounter can resist it.

Editor's Note.--Within the Pentacle are the Names El Ab, and IHVH. The
versicle is from Psalm xxiv. 7:--'Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be
ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come in.'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### THE MOON.

Figure 49.--The First Pentacle of the Moon.--This and the following
serve to call forth and invoke the Spirits of the Moon; and it further
serveth to open doors, in whatever way they may be fastened.

Editor's Note.--The Pentacle is a species of hieroglyphic representation
of a door or gate. In the centre is written the Name IHVH. On the right
hand are the Names IHV, IHVH, AL, and IHH. On the left hand are the
Names of the Angels: Schioel, Vaol, Yashiel, and Vehiel. The versicle
above the Names on either side is from Psalm cvii. 16:--'He hath broken
the Gates of brass, and- smitten the bars of iron in sunder.'
