## CHAPTER XI

### OF THE WATER, AND OF THE HYSSOP

IF it be necessary to sprinkle with water anything required in the Art
it should be clone with a Sprinkler.

Prepare a Censer in the day and hour of Mercury, with the odoriferous
Spices of the Art. After this thou shalt take a vessel of brass, of lead
varnished within and without, or of earth, which thou shalt fill with
most clear spring water, and thou shalt have salt, and say these words
over the salt:--

TZABAOTHI MESSIACH, EMANUEL, ELOHIM GIBOR, YOD HE VAU HE; O God, Who art
the Truth and the Life, deign to bless and sanctify this Creature of
Salt, to serve unto us for help, protection, and assistance in this Art,
experiment, and operation, and may it be a succour unto us.

After this cast the salt into the vessel wherein is the Water, and say
the following Psalms: cii.; liv.; vi.; lxvii.

Thou shalt then make unto thyself a Sprinkler of vervain, fennel,
lavender, sage, valerian, mint, garden-basil, rosemary, and hyssop,
gathered in the day and hour of Mercury, the moon being in her increase.
Bind together these herbs with a thread spun by a young maiden, and
engrave upon the handle on the one side the characters shown in *[Figure
82](kos44.htm#img_kos14.md)*, and on the other side those given in *[Figure
83](kos44.htm#img_kos14.md)*.

After this thou wayest use the Water, using the Sprinkler whenever it is
necessary; and know that wheresoever thou shalt sprinkle this Water, it
will chase away all Phantoms, and they shall be unable to hinder or
annoy any. With this same Water thou shalt make all the preparations of
the Art.
