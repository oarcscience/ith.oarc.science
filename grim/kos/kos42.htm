<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER VI</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE GARMENTS AND SHOES OF THE ART</H3>
<P>THE exterior habiliments which the Master of the Art should wear ought to be of linen, as well as those which he weareth beneath them; and if he hath the means they should be of Silk. If they be of linen the thread of which they are made should have been spun by a young maiden.</P>
<P>The characters shown in <I><A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 55</A></I> should be embroidered on the breast with the needle of Art in red silk.</P>
<P>The shoes should also be White, upon the which the characters in <I><A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 56</A></I> should be traced in the same way.</P>
<P>The shoes or boots should be made of white leather, on the which should be marked the Signs and Characters of Art. These shoes should be made during the days of fast and abstinence, namely, during the nine days set apart before the beginning of the Operation, during which the necessary instruments also should be prepared, polished, brightened, and cleaned.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Master of the Art should have a Crown made of virgin paper, upon the which should be written these four Names: YOD, HE, VAU, HE, in front; ADONAI behind; EL on the right; and ELOHIM on the left. (<I>See <A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 57</A></I>.) These Names should be written with the ink and pen of the Art, whereof we shall speak in the proper Chapter. The Disciples should also each have a Crown of virgin paper whereon these Divine symbols should be marked in scarlet. (<I>See <A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos13">Figure 58</A></I>.)</P>
<P>Take heed also that in clothing thyself with these aforesaid habiliments, that thou recite these Psalms:--Psalms xv.; cxxxi.; cxxxvii.; cxvii.; lxvii.; lxviii.; and cxxvii.</P>
<P>After this perfume the vestments with the perfumes and suffumigations of the Art, and sprinkle them with the water and hyssop of the Art.</P>
<P>But when the Master and His Disciples shall commence to robe themselves after the first Psalm, and before continuing with the others, he should pronounce these words:--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></P>
<P>AMOR, AMATOR, AMIDES, IDECIDANIACH, PAMOR, PLAIOR, ANITOR; through the merits of these holy Angels will I robe and indue myself with the Vestments of Power, through which may I conduct unto the desired end those things which I ardently wish, through Thee, O Most Holy ADONAI, Whose Kingdom and Empire endureth for ever. Amen.</P>
<P>Take notice that if the linen garments were vestments of the Levites or of the Priests, and had been used for holy things, that they would be all the better.</P>
