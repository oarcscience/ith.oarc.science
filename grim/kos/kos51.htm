<P>TAKE the feather of a Swallow or of a Crow, and before plucking it thou shalt say:--</P>
<P>May Holy MICHAEL the Archangel of God, and MIDAEL and MIRAEL, the Chiefs and Captains of the Celestial Army, be my aid in the operation I am about to perform, so that I may write herewith all things which are necessary, and that all the experiments which I commence herewith may through you and through your Names be perfected by the power of the Most High Creator. Amen.</P>
<P>After this thou shalt point and complete the pen with the Knife of the Art, and with the pen and ink of the Art thou shalt write upon its side the Name, ANAIRETON (<I>see <A HREF="kos44.htm#img_kos14">Figure 86</A></I>), and thou shalt say over it the following Psalms: cxxxiii.; cxvii.</P>
