# THE KEY OF SOLOMON

# BOOK I

## CHAPTER I

## CONCERNING THE DIVINE LOVE WHICH OUGHT TO PRECEDE THE ACQUISITION OF THIS KNOWLEDGE

SOLOMON, the Son of David, King of Israel, hath said that the beginning
of our Key is to fear God, to adore Him, to honour Him with contrition
of heart, to invoke Him <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3) in all matters
which we wish to undertake, and to operate with very great devotion, for
thus God will lead us in the right way. When, therefore, thou shalt wish
to acquire the knowledge of Magical Arts and Sciences, it is necessary
to have prepared the order of hours and of days, and of the position of
the Moon, without the operation of which thou canst effect nothing; but
if thou observest them with diligence thou mayest easily and thoroughly
arrive at the effect and end which thou desirest to attain.
