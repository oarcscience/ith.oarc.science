## CHAPTER XI

### TO HINDER A SPORTSMAN FROM KILLING ANY GAME <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md)

TAKE a stick of green elder, from the two ends of which thou shalt clean
out the pith. In each end place a strip of parchment of hare-skin,
having written thereon with the blood of a black hen the following
character and word. (*See [Figure 7](kos25.htm#img_kos02)*..md) Having made
two of these slips, place one in each end of the stick and close the
apertures up with pith, afterwards on a Friday in the month of February
thou shalt fumigate the aforesaid stick with suitable incense thrice in
the air, and having taken it thence thou shalt bury it in the earth
under an elder-tree. Afterwards thou shalt expose it in the pathway by
which the sportsman will pass, and once he has passed by it, he need not
hope to kill any game during that day. If thou shalt wish a second time
to lay a spell upon him in like manner, thou needest but to expose the
stick again in his path; but take care to bury it again in the earth
under an elder-tree, so as to be able to take it from thence each time
that thou shalt have need of it; and to take it up each time as soon as
the sportsman shall have passed.
