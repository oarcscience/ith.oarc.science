## CHAPTER VIII

### CONCERNING THE MEDALS OR PENTACLES, AND THE MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING THEM

As we have already made mention of the Pentacles, it is necessary that
thou shouldest understand that the whole Science and understanding of
our Key dependeth upon the operation, Knowledge, and use of Pentacles.

He then who shall wish to perform any operation by the means of the
Medals, or Pentacles, and therein to render himself expert, must observe
what hath been hereinbefore ordained. Let him then, O my Son Roboam,
know and understand that in the aforesaid Pentacles he shall find those
Ineffable and Most Holy Names which were written by the finger of God in
the Tablets of Moses; and which I, Solomon, have received through the
Ministry of an Angel by Divine Revelation. These then have I collected
together, arranged, consecrated, and kept, for the benefit of the human
race, and the preservation of Body and of Soul.

The Pentacles should then be made in the days and hours of Mercury, when
the Moon is in an aerial <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)or
terrestrial sign; she should also be in her increase, and in equal
number of days with the Sun.

It is necessary to have a Chamber or Cabinet specially set apart and
newly cleaned, wherein thou canst remain without interruption, the which
having entered with thy Companions, thou shalt incense and perfume it
with the odours and perfumes of the Art. The sky should be clear and
serene. It is necessary that thou shouldest have one or more pieces of
virgin paper prepared and arranged ready, as we shall tell you more
fully later on, in its place.

Thou shalt commence the writing or construction of the Pentacles in the
hour aforesaid. Among other things, thou shalt chiefly use these
colours: Gold, Cinnabar or Vermilion Red, and celestial or brilliant
Azure Blue. Furthermore, thou shalt make these Medals or Pentacles with
exorcised pen and colours, as we shall hereafter show thee.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Whensoever thou constructest them, if thou canst complete them in the
hour wherein thou didst begin them, it is better. However, if it be
absolutely necessary to interrupt the work, thou shouldest await the
proper day and hour before re-commencing it.

The Pentacles being finished and completed, take a cloth of very fine
silk, as we shall hereafter ordain thee, in the which thou shalt wrap
the Pentacles. After which thou shalt take a large Vessel of Earth
filled with Charcoal, upon the which there must be put frankincense,
mastic, and aloes, all having been previously conjured and exorcised as
shall hereafter be told thee. Thou must also be thyself pure, clean, and
washed, as thou shalt find given in the proper place. Furthermore, thou
shouldest have the Sickle or Knife of Magical Art, with the which thou
shalt make a Circle, and trace within it an inner circle, and in the
space between the two thou shalt write the Names of God, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) which thou shalt think fit and proper. It
is necessary after this that thou shouldest have within the Circle a
vessel of earth with burning coals and odoriferous perfumes thereon;
with the which thou shalt fumigate the aforesaid Pentacles; and, having
turned thy face towards the East, thou shalt hold the said Pentacles
over the smoke of the Incense, and shalt repeat devoutly the following
Psalms of David my Father: Psalms viii., xxi., xxvii., xxix., xxxii.,
li., lxxii., cxxxiv. <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md)

(For a convenient form of Circle which may be used for preparing
Instruments and other things of the same kind, as well as for
consecrating the Pentacles, *see [Figure 3](kos00.htm#img_kos01)*..md)

After this thou shalt repeat the following Oration:--

### THE ORATION.

O ADONAI most powerful, EL most strong, AGLA most holy, ON Most
righteous, the ALEPH <span id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54.md) and the TAU,
the Beginning and the End; Thou Who hast established all things in Thy
Wisdom; Thou Who has chosen Abraham Thy faithful servant, and hast
promised that in his seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed,
which seed Thou hast multiplied as the Stars of Heaven; Thou Who hast
appeared unto Thy servant Moses in flame in the midst of the Burning
Bush, and hast made him walk with dry feet through the Red Sea; Thou Who
gavest the Law to him upon Mount Sinai; Thou Who hast granted unto
Solomon Thy Servant these Pentacles by Thy great Mercy, for the
preservation of Soul and of Body; we most humbly implore and supplicate
Thy Holy Majesty, that these Pentacles may be consecrated by Thy power,
and prepared in such manner that

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

they may obtain virtue and strength against all Spirits, through Thee, O
Most Holy ADONAI, Whose Kingdom, Empire, and principality remaineth and
endureth without end.

These words being said, thou shalt perfume the Pentacles with the same
sweet scents and perfumes, and afterwards having wrapped them in a piece
of prepared silk cloth, thou shalt put them in a place fit and clean,
which thou mayest open whenever it shall please thee, and close it
again, at thy pleasure and according unto thy will. We will hereafter
show thee the method and manner of preparing the aforesaid place, of
perfuming it with scents and sweet odours, and of sprinkling it with the
Water and Water-Sprinkler of Magical Art; for all these things contain
many good properties, and innumerable virtues, as experience will easily
teach thee.

We have already said sufficient regarding the Solemn Conjuration of
Spirits.

We have also spoken enough in our present Key, regarding the manner in
which it is necessary to attract the Spirits so as to make them speak.
Now, by Divine aid, I will teach thee how to perform certain experiments
with success.

Know, <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) O my Son Roboam, that all the
Divine Sigils, Characters, and Names (which are the most precious and
excellent things in Nature, whether Terrestrial or Celestial), should be
written by thee each separately,

when thou art in a state of grace and purity, upon virgin parchment,
with ordinary ink, in the beginning of the month <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) of August before sunrise, raising thine
eyes unto heaven, and turning towards the east. Thou shalt preserve them
to suspend from thy neck, whichever thou wilt, on the day and hour
wherein thou wast born, after which thou shalt take heed to name every
day ten times, the Name which is hung from thy neck, turning towards the
East, and thou mayest be assured that no enchantment or any other danger
shall have power to harm thee.

Furthermore thou shalt vanquish all adversities, and shalt be cherished
and loved by the Angels and Spirits, provided that thou hast made their
characters and that thou hast them upon thee; I assure thee that this is
the true way to succeed with ease in all thine operations, for being
fortified with a Divine Name, and the Letters, Characters, and Sigils,
applicable unto the operation, thou shalt discover with what
supernatural exactitude and very great promptitude, both Terrestrial and
Celestial things will be obedient unto thee. But all this will only be
true, when accompanied by the Pentacles which hereinafter follow, seeing
that the Seals, Characters, and Divine Names, serve only to fortify the
work, to preserve from unforeseen accidents, and to attract the
familiarity of the Angels and Spirits

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

which is one reason, my Son, that before making any experiment, I order
thee to read and re-read my Testament, not once only but many times, so
that being perfectly instructed In the several Ceremonies thou mayest in
no way fail, and that thus what shall have previously appeared to thee
difficult and lengthy, may become in process of time easy and of very
great use.

I am about to endow thee with many secrets, which I charge thee never to
employ for an evil purpose, for ACCURSED BE HE WHO TAKETH THE NAME
OFALMIGHTY GOD IN VAIN; but thou mayest without any other ceremonies
make use of them, provided that, as I have already said, thou hast only
the Glory of Eternal God for thine object. Thus, after having taught
thee all the Ceremonies which concern the manner of performing the
Operations, I am at length determined to make thee a partaker in the
secrets of which I have particular knowledge, unknown to this day unto
the generality of men; but, nevertheless, only on the condition that
thou attemptest not the ruin and destruction of thy neighbour, for his
blood will cry for vengeance unto God, and in the end thou and thine
shall feel the just wrath of an offended Deity. However, God not having
forbidden honest and lawful pleasures, thou mayest perform boldly the
Operations which follow, it being always especially necessary to
distinguish between the good and the evil, so as to choose the former
and avoid the latter, which is why I command thee to be attentive to all
that is contained in this my Testament.
