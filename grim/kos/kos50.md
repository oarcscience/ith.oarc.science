## CHAPTER XIV

### OF THE PEN, INK, AND COLOURS

ALL things employed for writing, etc., in this Art, should be prepared
in the following manner.

Thou shalt take a male gosling, from which thou shalt pluck the third
feather of the right wing, and in plucking it thou shalt say:--

ADRAI, HAHLII, TAMAH, TILONAS, ATHAMAS, ZIANOR, ADONAI, banish from this
pen all deceit and error, so that it may be of virtue and efficacy to
write all that I desire. Amen.

After this thou shalt sharpen it with the penknife of the Art, perfume
it, sprinkle it, and place it aside in a silken cloth.

Thou shalt have an Inkstand made of earth or any convenient matter, and
in the day and hour of Mercury thou shalt engrave thereon with the Burin
of Art these Names:--Yod, He, Vau, He, Metatron, Iah Iah Iah, Qadosch,
Elohim Tzabaoth (*see [Figure 85](kos44.htm#img_kos14)*.md); and in putting
the ink therein thou shalt say:--

I exorcise thee, O Creature of Ink, by ANAIRETON, by SIMULATOR, and by
the Name ADONAI, and by the Name of Him through Whom all things were
made, that thou be unto me an aid and succour in all things which I wish
to perform by thine aid.

As it sometimes happeneth that it is necessary to write with some noble
colour, it is well to have a new and clean box wherein to keep them. The
principal colours will be Yellow or Gold, Red, Celestial or Azure Blue,
Green, and Brown; and any other colours that may be requisite. Thou
shalt exorcise, perfume, and sprinkle them in the usual manner.
