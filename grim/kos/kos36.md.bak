# BOOK II

## PREFATORY NOTE <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)

THIS Work of Solomon is divided into two books. In the first thou mayest
see and know how to avoid errors in Experiments, Operations, and in the
Spirits themselves. In the second thou art taught in what manner Magical
Arts may be reduced to the proposed object and end.

It is for this reason that thou shouldest take great heed and care that
this Key of Secrets fall not into the hands of the foolish, the stupid,
and the ignorant. For he who is the possessor hereof, and who availeth
himself hereof according to the ordinances herein contained, will not
only be able to reduce the Magical Arts herein unto their proposed end,
but will, even if he findeth certain errors herein, be able to correct
them.

Any Art or Operation of this kind will not be able to attain its end,
unless the Master of the Art, or Exorcist, shall have this Work
completely in his power, that is to say, unless he thoroughly understand
it, for without this he will never attain the effect of any operation.

For this reason I earnestly pray and conjure the person into whose hands
this Key of Secrets may fall, neither to communicate it, nor to make any
one a partaker in this knowledge, if he be not faithful, nor capable of
keeping a secret, nor expert in the Arts. And I most humbly entreat the
possessor of this, by the Ineffable Name of God in four Letters, YOD,
HE, VAU, HE, and by the Name ADONAI, and by all the other Most High and
Holy Names of God, that he values this work as dearly as his own soul,
and that he makes no foolish or ignorant man a partaker therein.
