## CHAPTER VI

### STRONGER AND MORE POTENT CONJURATION

IF they then immediately appear, it is well; if not, let the Master
uncover the consecrated Pentacles which he should have made to constrain
and command the Spirits, and which he should wear fastened round his
neck, holding the Medals (or Pentacles) in his left hand, and the
consecrated Knife in his right; and encouraging his Companions, he shall
say with a loud voice:--

### ADDRESS.

Here be the Symbols of Secret things, the standards, the ensigns, and
the banners, of God the Conqueror; and the arms of the Almighty One, to
compel the Aerial Potencies. I command ye absolutely by their power and
virtue that ye come near unto us, into our presence, from whatsoever
part of the world ye may be in, and that ye delay not to obey us in all
things wherein we shall command ye by the virtue of God the Mighty One.
Come ye promptly, and delay not to appear, and answer us with humility.

If they appear at this time, show them the Pentacles, and receive them
with kindness, gentleness, and courtesy; reason and speak with them,
question them, and ask from them all things which thou hast proposed to
demand.

But if, on the contrary, they do not yet make their appearance, holding
the consecrated Knife in the right hand, and the Pentacles being
uncovered by the removal of their consecrated covering, strike and beat
the air with the Knife as if wishing to commence a combat, comfort and
exhort thy Companions, and then in a loud and stern voice repeat the
following Conjuration:--

### CONJURATION. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)

Here again I conjure ye and most urgently command ye; I force,
constrain, and exhort ye to the utmost, by the most mighty and powerful

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Name of God EL, strong and wonderful, and by God
the just and Upright, I exorcise ye and command ye that ye in no way
delay, but that ye come immediately and upon the instant hither before
us, without noise, deformity, or hideousness, but with all manner of
gentleness and mildness.

I exorcise ye anew, and powerfully conjure ye, commanding ye with
strength and violence by Him Who spake and it was done; and by all these
names: EL SHADDAI, ELOHIM, ELOHI, TZABAOTH, ELIM, ASHER EHEIEH, YAH,
TETRAGRAMMATON, SHADDAI, which signify God the High and Almighty, the
God of Israel, through Whom undertaking all our operations we shall
prosper in all the works of our hands, seeing that the Lord is now,
always, and for ever with us, in our heart and in our lips; and by His
Holy Names, and by the virtue of the Sovereign God, we shall accomplish
all our work.

Come ye at once without any hideousness or deformity before us, come ye
without monstrous appearance, in a gracious form or figure. Come ye, for
we exorcise ye with the utmost vehemence by the Name of IAH and ON,
which Adam spake and heard; by the Name EL, which Noah heard, and saved
himself with all his family from the Deluge; by the Name IOD, which Noah
heard, and knew God the Almighty One; by the Name AGLA which Jacob
heard, and saw the Ladder which touched Heaven, and the Angels who
ascended and descended upon it, whence he called that place the House of
God and the Gate of Heaven; and by the Name ELOHIM, and in the Name
ELOHIM, which Moses named, invoked, and heard in Horeb the Mount of God,
and he was found worthy to hear Him speak from the Burning Bush; and by
the Name AIN SOPH, which Aaron heard, and was at once made eloquent,
wise, and learned; and by the Name TZABAOTH, which Moses named and
invoked, and all the ponds and rivers were covered with blood throughout
the land of Egypt; <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) and by the Name
IOD, which Moses named and invoked, and striking upon the dust of the
earth both men and beasts were struck with disease; <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) and by the Name, and in the Name
PRIMEUMATON which Moses named and invoked, and there fell a great and
severe hail throughout all the land of Egypt, destroying the vines, the
trees, and the woods which were in that country; and by the Name IAPHAR,
which Moses heard and invoked, and immediately a great pestilence began
to appear through all the land of Egypt, striking and slaying the asses,
the oxen, and the sheep of the Egyptians, so that they all died; and by
the Name ABADDON which Moses invoked and sprinkled the dust towards
heaven, and immediately there fell so great rain upon the men, cattle,
and flocks, that they all died

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

throughout the land of Egypt; and by the Name ELION which Moses invoked,
and there fell so great hail as had never been seen from the beginning
of the world unto that time, so that all men, and herds, and everything
that was in the fields perished and died throughout all the land of
Egypt. And by the Name ADONAI, which Moses having invoked, there came so
great a quantity of locusts which appeared in the land of Egypt, that
they devoured and swallowed up all that the hail had spared; and by the
Name of PATHEON, <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) which having
invoked, there arose so thick, so awful, and so terrible darkness
throughout the land of Egypt, during the space of three days and three
nights, that almost all who were left alive died; and by the Name YESOD,
and in the Name YESOD, which Moses invoked, and at midnight all the
first-born, both of men and of animals, died; and by the Name Of
YESHIMON, which Moses named and invoked, and the Red Sea divided itself
and separated in two; and by the Name HESION, which Moses invoked, and
all the army of Pharaoh was drowned in the waters; and by the Name
ANABONA, which Moses having heard upon Mount Sinai, he was found worthy
to receive and obtain the tables of stone written with the finger of God
the Creator; and by the Name ERYGION, which Joshua having invoked when
he fought against the Moabites, he defeated them and gained the victory;
and by the Name HOA, and in the Name HOA, which David invoked, and he
was delivered from the hand of Goliath; and by the Name YOD, which
Solomon having named and invoked, he was found worthy to ask for and to
obtain in sleep the Ineffable Wisdom of God; and by the Name YIAI, which
Solomon having named and invoked, he was found worthy to have power over
all the Demons, Potencies, Powers, and Virtues of the Air.

By these, then, and by all the other Names of God Almighty, Holy,
Living, and True, we powerfully command ye, ye who by your own sin have
been cast down from the Empyreal Heaven, and from before His Throne; by
Him Who hath cast ye down unto the most profound of the Abysses of Hell,
we command ye boldly and resolutely; and by that terrible Day of the
Sovereign judgment of God, on which all the dry bones in the earth will
arise to hear and listen unto the Word of God with their Body, and will
present themselves before the face of God Almighty; and by that Last
Fire which shall consume all things; by the (Crystal) Sea which is known
unto us, which is before the Face of God; by the indicible and ineffable
virtue, force, and power of the Creator Himself, by His Almighty power,
and by the Light and Flame which emanate from His Countenance, and which
are before His Face; by the Angelical Powers which are in the Heavens,
and by the most great Wisdom of

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Almighty God; by the Seal of David, by the Ring
and Seal of Solomon, which was revealed unto him by the Most High and
Sovereign Creator; and by the Nine Medals or Pentacles, which we have
among our Symbols, which proceed and come from Heaven, and are among the
Mysteries of Mysteries or Secrets of Secrets, which you can also behold
in my hand, consecrated and exorcised with the due and requisite
Ceremonies. By these, then, and by all the Secrets which the Almighty
encloseth in the Treasures of the Sovereign and Highest Wisdom, by His
hand, and by His marvellous power; I conjure, force, and exorcise ye
that ye come without delay to perform in our presence that which we
shall command ye.

I conjure ye anew by that most Holy Name which the whole Universe fears,
respects, and reveres, which is written by these letters and characters,
IOD, HE, VAU, HE; and by the last and terrible judgment; by the Seat of
BALDACHIA; <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) and by this Holy Name,
YIAI, which Moses invoked, and there followed that great judgment of
God, when Dathan and Abiram were swallowed up in the centre of the
earth. Otherwise, if ye contravene and resist us by your disobedience
unto the virtue and power of this Name YIAI, we curse ye even unto the
Depth of the Great Abyss, into the which we shall cast, hurl, and bind
ye, if ye show yourselves rebellious against the Secret of Secrets, and
against the Mystery of Mysteries. AMEN, AMEN. FIAT, FIAT.

This Conjuration thou shalt say and perform, turning thyself unto the
East, and if they appear not, thou shalt repeat it unto the Spirits,
turning unto the South, the West, and the North, in succession, when
thou wilt have repeated it four times. And if they appear not even then,
thou shalt make the Sign of TAU <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) upon
the foreheads of thy companions, and thou shalt say:--

### CONJURATION.

Behold anew the Symbol and the Name of a Sovereign and Conquering God,
through which all the Universe fears, trembles, and shudders, and
through the most mysterious words of the Secret Mysteries and by their
Virtue, Strength, and Power.

I conjure ye anew, I constrain and command ye with the utmost vehemence
and power, by that most potent and powerful Name of God, EL, strong and
wonderful, by Him Who spake and it was done; and by the Name IAH, which
Moses heard, and spoke with God; and by the Name AGLA, which Joseph
invoked, and was delivered out of the hands of his brethren; and by the
Name VAU, which Abraham heard, and knew God the Almighty One; and by the
Name of Four Letters, TETRAGRAMMATON,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

which Joshua named and invoked, and he was rendered worthy and found
deserving to lead the Army of Israel into the Promised Land; and by the
Name ANABONA, by which God formed Man and the whole Universe; and by the
Name ARPHETON, <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) and in the Name
ARPHETON, by which the Angels who are destined to that end will summon
the Universe, in visible body and form, and will assemble (all people)
together by the sound of the Trumpet at that terrible and awful Day of
judgment, when the memory of the wicked and ungodly shall perish; and by
the Name ADONAI, by which God will judge all human flesh, at Whose voice
all men, both good and evil, will rise again, and all men and Angels
will assemble in the air before the Lord, Who will judge and condemn the
wicked; and by the Name ONEIPHETON, <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)
by which God will summon the dead, and raise them up again unto life;
and by the Name ELOHIM, and in the Name ELOHIM, by which God will
disturb and excite tempests throughout all the seas, so that they will
cast out the fish therefrom, and in one day the third part of men about
the sea and the rivers shall die; and by the Name ELOHI, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) and in the Name ELOHI, by which God will
dry up the sea and the rivers, so that men can go on foot through their
channels; and by the Name ON, and in the Name ON, by which God will
restore and replace the sea, the rivers, the streams, and the brooks, in
their previous state; and by the Name MESSIACH, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md) and in the Name MESSIACH, by which God
will make all animals combat together, so that they shall die in a
single day; and by the Name ARIEL, by which God will destroy in a single
day all buildings, so that there shall not be left one stone upon
another; and by the Name IAHT, <span id="fr_40"></span>[5](#fn_40.md) by
which God will cast one stone upon another, so that all people and
nations will fly from the sea-shore, and will say unto them cover us and
hide us; and by the Name EMANUEL, by which God will perform wonders, and
the winged creatures and birds of the air shall contend with one
another; and by the Name ANAEL, <span id="fr_41"></span>[6](#fn_41.md) and
in the Name ANAEL, by which God will cast down the mountains and fill up
the valleys, so that the surface of the earth shall be level in all
parts; and by the Name ZEDEREZA, <span id="fr_42"></span>[7](#fn_42.md) and
in the Name ZEDEREZA, by which God will cause the Sun and Moon to be
darkened, and the Stars of heaven to fall; and by the Name
SEPHERIEL, <span id="fr_43"></span>[8](#fn_43.md) by which God will come to
Universal judgment,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

like a Prince newly crowned entering in triumph into his capital city,
girded with a zone of gold, and preceded by Angels, and at His aspect
all climes and parts of the Universe shall be troubled and astonished,
and a fire shall go forth before Him, and flames and storms shall
surround Him; and by the Name Tau, <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)
by which God brought the Deluge, and the waters prevailed above the
mountains, and fifteen cubits above their summits; and by the Name
RUACHIAH, <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) by which God having purged
the Ages, He will make His Holy Spirit to descend upon the Universe, and
will cast ye, ye rebellious Spirits, and unclean beings, into the Depths
of the Lake of the Abyss, in misery, filth, and mire, and will place ye
in impure and foul dungeons bound with eternal chains of fire.

By these Names then, and by all the other Holy Names of God before Whom
no man can stand and live, and which Names the armies of the Demons
fear, tremble at, and shudder; we conjure ye, we potently exorcise and
command ye, conjuring ye in addition by the terrible and tremendous
PATHS <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md) of GOD and by His Holy
habitation wherein He reigneth and commandeth unto the eternal Ages.
Amen.

By the virtue of all these aforesaid, we command ye that ye remain not
in any place wherein ye are, but to come hither promptly without delay
to do that which we shall enjoin ye. But if ye be still contumacious,
we, by the Authority of a Sovereign and Potent God, deprive ye of all
quality, condition, degree, and place which ye now enjoy, and
precipitate ye into and relegate ye unto the Kingdom of Fire and of
Sulphur, to be there eternally tormented. Come ye then from all parts of
the earth, wheresoever ye may be, and behold the Symbols and Names of
that Triumphant Sovereign Whom all creatures obey, otherwise we shall
bind ye and conduct ye in spite of yourselves, into our presence bound
with chains of fire, because those effects which proceed and issue from
our Science and operation, are ardent with a fire which shall consume
and burn ye eternally, for by these the whole Universe trembleth, the
earth is moved, the stones thereof rush together, all creatures obey,
and the rebellious Spirits are tormented by the power of the Sovereign
Creator.

Then it is certain that they will come, even if they be bound with
chains of fire, unless prevented by affairs of the very greatest
importance, but in this latter case they will send ambassadors and
messengers by whom thou shalt easily and surely learn what occupies the
Spirits and what they are about. But if they appear not yet in answer to
the above Conjuration, and are still disobedient, then let the Master of
the Art or Exorciser arise and exhort his Companions to be of good cheer
and not to despair of the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

ultimate success of the operation; let him strike the air with the
Consecrated Knife towards the Four Quarters of the Universe; and then
let him kneel in the midst of the Circle, and the Companions also in
their several places, and let them say consecutively with him in a low
voice, turning in the direction of the East, the following

### ADDRESS TO THE ANGELS.

I conjure and pray ye, O ye Angels of God, and ye Celestial Spirits, to
come unto mine aid; come and behold the Signs of Heaven, and be my
witness before the Sovereign Lord, of the disobedience of these evil and
fallen Spirits who were at one time your companions.

This being done, let the Master arise, and constrain and force them by a
stronger conjuration, in manner following.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[29:1](kos11.htm#fr_30.md) This Conjuration is
almost identical with one given in the 'Lemegeton,' or Lesser Key, a
different work, also attributed to Solomon.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[30:1](kos11.htm#fr_31.md) Some MSS. add, 'et
furent purifiés.'

<span id="fn_32"></span>[30:2](kos11.htm#fr_32.md) Some MSS. substitute,
'les hommes furent reduits en cendre, comme aussi les bœufs, betail, et
troupeaux des Egyptiens.'

<span id="fn_33"></span>[31:1](kos11.htm#fr_33.md) This is often written
PATHTUMON in similar Conjurations, but the MSS. before me agree in
giving this form.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[32:1](kos11.htm#fr_34.md) Sometimes, but as I
think erroneously, written Bas-dathea. I imagine the word to mean 'Lord
of Life.'

<span id="fn_35"></span>[32:2](kos11.htm#fr_35.md) Or the Cross.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[33:1](kos11.htm#fr_36.md) Also written *Hipeton*;
and I believe sometimes replaced by *Anapheneton* or *Anaphaxeton*.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[33:2](kos11.htm#fr_37.md) This word is given
variously in the MSS., as *Oneypheon*, *Onayepheton*, and
*Donecepheron*, etc.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[33:3](kos11.htm#fr_38.md) Or *Elia*.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[33:4](kos11.htm#fr_39.md) What is said here refers
symbolically to the rooting out of the Evil Spirits, and Shells, from
the Universe by King Messiach, which is spoken of in the Qabalah. The
Qabalah sometimes expresses the Evil Spirits by the words animals, or
beasts, and creeping things.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[33:5](kos11.htm#fr_40.md) The oldest MSS. gives
the above form, in the others it is changed into *Iaphat*, *Taphat*, and
even *Japhet*. It is probably a corruption of *Achad* Unity.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[33:6](kos11.htm#fr_41.md) This is also the name of
the Angel of Venus.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[33:7](kos11.htm#fr_42.md) So written in the oldest
MS., the others give it as *Zedeesia*, *Zedeezia*, and *Zedezias*.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[33:8](kos11.htm#fr_43.md) Meaning 'emanating from
God.' It is corrupted into *Sephosiel*, etc., in the MSS.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[34:1](kos11.htm#fr_44.md) *Iaha*, in 10862 Add.
MSS.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[34:2](kos11.htm#fr_45.md) Meaning Spirit of Iah.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[34:3](kos11.htm#fr_46.md) That is, the hidden and
occult grades and links of emanation in the Sephiroth. The later MSS.
have put, by a mistake, *voix* for *voies*; the oldest Latin MS. gives
Semitis.
