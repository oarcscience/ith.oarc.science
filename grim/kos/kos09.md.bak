## CHAPTER IV

## THE CONFESSION TO BE MADE BY THE EXORCIST

### CONFESSION.

O LORD of Heaven and of Earth, before Thee do I confess my sins, and
lament them, cast down and humbled in Thy presence. For I have sinned
before Thee by pride, avarice, and boundless desire of honours and
riches; by idleness, gluttony, greed, debauchery, and drunkenness;
because I have offended Thee by all kinds of sins of the flesh,
adulteries, and pollutions, which I have committed myself, and consented
that others should commit; by sacrilege, thefts, rapine, violation, and
homicide; by the evil use I have made of my possessions, by my
prodigality, by the sins which I have committed against Hope and
Charity, by my evil advice, flatteries, bribes, and the ill distribution
which I have made of the goods of which I have been possessed; by
repulsing and maltreating the poor, in the distribution which I have
made of the goods committed to my charge, by afflicting those over whom
I have been set in authority, by not visiting the prisoners, by
depriving the dead of burial, by not receiving the poor, by neither
feeding the hungry nor giving drink to the thirsty, by never keeping the
Sabbath and the other feasts, by not living chastely and piously on
those days, by the easy consent which I have given to those who incited
me to evil deeds, by injuring instead of aiding those who demanded help
from me, by refusing to give ear unto the cry of the poor, by not
respecting the aged, by not keeping my word, by disobedience to my
parents, by ingratitude towards those from whom I have received
kindness, by indulgence in sensual pleasures, by irreverent behaviour in
the Temple of God, by unseemly gestures thereat, by entering therein
without reverence, by vain and unprofitable discourse when there, by
despising the sacred vessels of the temple, by turning the holy
Ceremonies into ridicule, by touching and eating the sacred bread with
impure lips and with profane hands, and by the neglect of my prayers and
adorations.

I detest also the crimes which I have committed by evil thoughts, vain
and impure meditations, false suspicions, and rash judgments; by

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

the evil consent which I have readily given unto the advice of the
wicked, by lust of impure and sensual pleasures; by my idle words, my
lies, and my deceit; by my false vows in various ways; and by my
continual slander and calumny.

I detest also the crimes which I have committed within; the treachery
and discord which I have incited; my curiosity, greed, false speaking,
violence, malediction, murmurs, blasphemies, vain words, insults,
dissimulations; my sins against God by the transgression of the ten
commandments, by neglect of my duties and obligations, and by want of
love towards God and towards my neighbour.

Furthermore, I hate the sins which I have committed in all my senses, by
sight, by hearing, by taste, by smell, and by touch, in every way that
human weakness can offend the Creator; by my carnal thoughts, deeds, and
meditations.

In which I humbly confess that I have sinned, and recognise myself as
being in the sight of God the most criminal of all men.

I accuse myself before Thee, O God, and I adore Thee with all humility.
O ye, Holy Angels, and ye, Children of God, in your presence I publish
my sins, so that mine Enemy may have no advantage over me, and may not
be able to reproach me at the last day; that he may not be able to say
that I have concealed my sins, and that 1 be not then accused in the
presence of the Lord; but, on the contrary, that on my account there may
be joy in Heaven, as over the just who have confessed their sins in thy
presence.

O Most Mighty and All Powerful Father, grant through Thine unbounded
Mercy that I may both see and know all the Spirits which I invoke, so
that by their means I may see my will and desire accomplished, by Thy
Sovereign grandeur, and by Thine Ineffable and Eternal Glory, Thou Who
art and Who wilt be for ever the Pure and Ineffable Father of All.

The Confession having been finished with great humility, and with the
inward feeling of the heart, the Master will recite the following
prayer:--

### PRAYER.

O Lord All Powerful, Eternal God and Father of all Creatures, shed upon
me the Divine Influence of Thy Mercy, for I am Thy Creature. I beseech
Thee to defend me from mine Enemies, and to confirm in me true and
steadfast faith.

O Lord, I commit my Body and my Soul unto Thee, seeing I put my trust in
none beside Thee; it is on Thee alone that I rely; O Lord my God aid me;
O Lord hear me in the day and hour wherein I shall invoke

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Thee. I pray Thee by Thy Mercy not to put me in
oblivion, nor to remove me from Thee. O Lord be Thou my succour, Thou
Who art the God of my salvation. O Lord make me a new heart according
unto Thy loving Kindness. These, O Lord, are the gifts which I await
from Thee, O my God and my Master, Thou Who livest and reignest unto the
Ages of the Ages. Amen.

O Lord God the All Powerful One, Who hast formed unto Thyself great and
Ineffable Wisdom, and Co-eternal with Thyself before the countless Ages;
Thou Who in the Birth of Time hast created the Heavens, and the Earth,
the Sea, and things that they contain; Thou Who hast vivified all things
by the Breath of Thy Mouth, I praise Thee, I bless Thee, I adore Thee,
and I glorify Thee. Be Thou propitious unto me who am but a miserable
sinner, and despise me not; save me and succour me) even me the work of
Thine hands. I conjure and entreat Thee by Thy Holy Name to banish from
my Spirit the darkness of Ignorance, and to enlighten me with the Fire
of Thy Wisdom; take away from me all evil desires, and let not my speech
be as that of the foolish. O Thou, God the Living One, Whose Glory,
Honour, and Kingdom shall extend unto the Ages of the Ages. Amen.
