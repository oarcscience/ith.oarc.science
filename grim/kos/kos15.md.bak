## CHAPTER X

### OF THE EXPERIMENT OF INVISIBILITY, AND HOW IT SHOULD BE PERFORMED

IF thou wishest to perform the Experiment of Invisibility, thou shalt
follow the instructions for the same. If it be necessary to observe the
day and the hour, thou shalt do as is said in their Chapters. But if
thou needest not observe the day and the hour as marked in the Chapter
thereon, thou shalt do as taught in the Chapter which precedeth it. If
in the course of the experiment it be necessary to write anything, it
should be done as is described in the Chapters pertaining thereto, with
the proper pen, paper, and ink, or blood. But if the matter is to be
accomplished by invocation, before thy conjurations, thou shalt say
devoutly in thine heart:--

SCEABOLES, ARBARON, ELOHI, ELIMIGITH, HERENOBULCULE, METHE, BALUTH,
TIMAYAL, VILLAQUIEL, TEVENI, YEVIE, FERETE, BACUHABA, GUVARIN; through
Him by Whom ye have empire and power over men, ye must accomplish this
work so that I may go and remain invisible.

And if it be necessary in this operation to trace a Circle, thou shalt
do as is ordained in the Chapter concerning Circles; and if it be
necessary to write characters, etc., thou shalt follow the instructions
given in the respective Chapters.

This operation being thus prepared, if there be an especial Conjuration
to perform, thou shalt repeat it in the proper manner; if not, thou
shalt say the general Conjuration, at the end of which thou shalt add
the following words:--

O thou ALMIRAS, Master of Invisibility, with thy Ministers CHEROG,
MAITOR, TANGEDEM, TRANSIDIM, SUVANTOS, ABELAIOS, BORED, BELAMITH,
CASTUMI, DABUEL; I conjure ye by Him Who maketh Earth and Heaven to
tremble, Who is seated upon the Throne of His Majesty, that this
operation may be perfectly accomplished according to my will, so that at
whatsoever time it may please me, I may be able to be invisible.

I conjure thee anew, O ALMIRAS, Chief of Invisibility, both thee and

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

thy Ministers, by Him through Whom all things have their being, and by
SATURIEL, HARCHIEL, DANIEL, BENIEL, ASSIMONEM, that thou immediately
comest hither with all thy Ministers, and achievest this operation, as
thou knowest it ought to be accomplished, and that by the same operation
thou render me invisible, so that none may be able to see me.

In order then to accomplish this aforesaid operation, thou must prepare
all things necessary with requisite care and diligence, and put them in
practice with all the general and particular ceremonies laid down for
these experiments; and with all the conditions contained in our first
and second Books. Thou shalt also in the same operations duly repeat the
appropriate Conjurations, with all the solcmnitie5 marked in the
respective Chapters. Thus shalt thou accomplish the experiment surely
and without hindrance, and thus shalt thou find it true.

But, on the contrary, if thou lettest any of these things escape thee,
or if thou despiseth them, never shalt thou be able to arrive at thy
proposed end; as, for example, we enter not easily into a fenced city
over its walls but through its gates.

### HOW <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) TO RENDER ONESELF INVISIBLE.

Make a small image of yellow wax, in the form of a man, in the month
January and in the day and hour of Saturn, and at that time write with a
needle above the crown of its head and upon its skull which thou shalt
have adroitly raised, the character following. (*See [Figure
5](kos00.htm#img_kos01)*..md) After which thou shalt replace the skull in
proper position. Thou shalt then write upon a small strip of the skin of
a frog or toad which thou shalt have killed, the following words and
characters. (*See [Figure 6](kos25.htm#img_kos02)*..md) Thou shalt then go
and suspend the said figure by one of thy hairs from the vault of a
cavern at the hour of midnight, and perfuming it with the proper incense
thou shalt say:--

METATRON, MELEKH, BEROTH, NOTH, VENIBBETH, MACH, and all ye, I conjure
thee, O Figure of wax, by the Living God, that by the virtue of these
Characters and words, thou render me invisible, wherever I may bear thee
with me. Amen.

And after having censed it anew, thou shalt bury it in the same place in
a small deal box, and every time that thou wishest to pass or enter into
any place without being seen, thou shalt say these words, bearing the
aforesaid figure in thy left pocket:--

Come unto me and never quit me whithersoever I shall go.

Afterwards thou shalt take it carefully back unto the before-mentioned
place and cover it with earth until thou shalt need it again.
