### THE TWENTIETH CHAPTER.

### HOW THE OPERATIONS SHOULD BE PERFORMED.

<span id="img_tinit"></span>

|--------------------|
| ![](img/tinit.jpg) |

HE aforesaid Operation being finished, it is necessary, in order to
render this instruction complete, to say how we should manage the
Operations which he who operateth wisheth to put into practice.

Firstly, then, having come unto the end, and having obtained all that is
necessary; you cannot sufficiently praise and honour God, and His Most
Holy Name, even although you had a thousand tongues; neither also can
you sufficiently magnify and thank your Holy Angel Guardian as he
meriteth. However, you ought to render thanks proportionate to your
estate and to the Great Treasure which you have received. It is
necessary also that you should fully understand how you ought to enjoy
these immense riches, so that they may not be in your hands unfruitful,
or even harmful. Because this Art is like a Sword in your hand, capable
of serving for all kinds of evil and for hurt unto your neighbour. But
in putting it into practice for that sole end for which it hath been
made, namely for vanquishing therewith the DEMON and Enemies, then shall
you be making a good use hereof. I wish also further to give you some
instruction upon certain necessary and principal points.

The Operation of the Spirits being finished, you shall continue a whole
week to praise God; and as regardeth yourself personally, you shall do
no servile work during the Seven Days, neither shall you make any
Convocation of the Spirits in general, nor of the Familiars; and
afterwards, when the Seven Days be passed, you shall commence to
exercise your power, as. shall be hereafter said:--

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

\(1\) Take heed before all things to perform no Magical Operation
soever, or Invocations of the Spirits on the Sabbath Day, during the
whole period of your life, seeing that that day is consecrated unto God,
and is the day on which you should repose and sanctify yourself, and you
should solemnise it by prayers.

\(2\) Keep yourself as you would from the Eternal Fire, from manifesting
unto any living being that which your Guardian Angel shall have confided
unto you; excepting unto him who hath given unto you the Operation, unto
whom you have as it were a greater obligation than unto your own father.

\(3\) As far as lieth in your power take heed in no way to make use of
this Art against your neighbour; except for a just Vengeance; although I
counsel you even in this particular to imitate God, who pardoneth even
you yourself, and there is not in the world a more meritorious action
than to pardon.

\(4\) In the case of your Angel dissuading you from some Operation, and
forbidding you to do the same, keep well from becoming obstinate
therein, for you would in such a case ever repent it.

\(5\) Fly all kinds of (Evil) Science, Magic, and Enchantments, because
they be all Diabolical Inventions; also put no trust in books which
teach them, though in appearance they may seem reliable to you, for
these be nets which the perfidious BELIAL stretcheth out to take you.

\(6\) In conversing with Spirits Good or Evil, never employ words which
you do not understand, because even so will you have shame and hurt.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

\(7\) You shall never demand of your Guardian Angel any Symbol wherewith
to operate for an Evil end, seeing that you would grieve him. You will
find only too many persons who will beseech you to do thus; see that you
do it not!

\(8\) Accustom yourself as much as possible to purity of body and
cleanliness of raiment, seeing that this is very necessary; for the
Spirits, both Good and Evil alike, love purity.

\(9\) As far as possible shun the employment of your Wisdom for others
in evil things; but first well consider him to whom you would render a
service; because it often happeneth, that in doing service unto another
one worketh evil for oneself.

\(10\) In no way attempt to procure the Operation of the Holy Angels
unless you have extreme need thereof, seeing that these Holy Angels be
so far above you that it is useless for you to wish to compare yourself
unto Them, you being nothing in comparison of Them Who are the Angels of
God.

\(11\) If the Operations can be performed by the Familiar Spirits, it is
not necessary to employ others therein.

\(12\) Though it should be an easy matter for you to employ your
Familiars to annoy your neighbour, seek to abstain therefrom, unless it
were to repress the insolence of such as might attempt aught against you
personally. Never keep the Familiar Spirits in idleness, and should you
wish to give one over unto any person, see that such person be
distinguished and meritorious, for they love not to serve those of base
and common condition. But should

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

such person unto i whom you give them have made some express Pact (with
Spirits) in such case the Familiar Spirits will fly in haste to serve
him.

\(13\) These three Books of this present Operation ought to be read and
re-read an infinitude of times; so that in the space of Six Months
before commencing, he who operateth should be fully instructed and
informed therein; and if he be not a Jew, he should further be
conversant with many of the customs and ceremonies which this Operation
demandeth, so as to become accustomed unto that retirement which is so
necessary and useful.

(14.) Should he who performeth this Operation during the Six Months or
Moons commit voluntarily any mortal sin prohibited by the Tables of the
Law, be certain that he will never receive this Wisdom.

\(15\) Sleep in the day-time is entirely forbidden, unless absolutely
requisite, owing to some infirmity, or to old age, or to debility of
constitution; for God is always willing to employ mercy <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) towards mankind, because of their
infirmities.

\(16\) If you have not the fixed intention of continuing the Operation,
I counsel you on no account to commence it; because the Lord doth not
care to be mocked, and He chastiseth with corporal maladies those who
make a mock of Him. Howbeit, he who is hindered from continuing through
some unforeseen accident, sinneth in no way.

\(17\) It is impossible for him who hath passed fifty years of age to
undertake this Operation. Thus also was

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

it the custom in the true and ancient Jewish Law concerning the
Priesthood. Also, he should not be less than twenty-five years of age.

\(18\) You shall not permit the Familiar Spirits to familiarise
themselves too much with you, through your disputing and arguing with
them; because they will propound so many affairs and things at once as
to confound and trouble the mind.

\(19\) With the Familiar Spirits you should not make use of the Symbols
of the Third Book, unless it be those of the Fifth Chapter
thereof; <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) but if you desire
anything, command them aloud to perform it. Never commence many
Operations at once and in the same time, but when you have finished one
then begin another, until you are perfect in the practice; for an
Apprentice Artist doth not become a Master suddenly, but little by
little.

\(20\) Without reasons of the very last importance, the Four
Princes <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) or the Eight
Sub-Princes <span id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_196.md), should never be
summoned, because we must make a great distinction between these and the
others (who are inferior to them).

\(21\) In operating, as rarely as possible insist upon the Spirits
appearing visibly; <span id="fr_197"></span>[4](#fn_197.md) and thus you
will work

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

all the better, for it should suffice you for them to say and do what
you wish.

\(22\) All Prayers, Orations, Invocations, and Conjurations, and in fact
everything you have to say, should be pronounced aloud and clearly,
without however shouting like a madman. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md) but speaking clearly and naturally, and
pronouncing distinctly.

\(23\) During the Six Moons, you shall sweep the Oratory every Sabbath
Eve, and keep it strictly clean, for it is a place dedicated unto the
Holy and Pure Angels.

\(24\) Take heed that you commence no Operation at night if it be
important, unless the need be very pressing.

\(25\) Your only object during your whole life should be to shun as far
as possible an ill-regulated life, and especially the vices of
debauchery, gluttony, and drunkenness. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md)

\(26\) Having completed the Operation, and being now the Possessor of
the True Wisdom, you shall fast three days before commencing to put it
in practice.

\(27\) Every year you should make a commemoration of the Signal benefit
which the Lord hath conferred upon you; at such time feasting, praying,
and honouring your Guardian Angel that day with your whole strength.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

\(28\) During the Three Days on which you constrain the Spirits you
shall fast, for this is essential, so that when you are working you may
find yourself freer and more tranquil both in body and mind.

\(29\) Note that the fasts are to be understood as commencing always
from the first nocturnal Star, and not otherwise.

\(30\) Keep as an indubitable precept never to give this Operation unto
a Monarch, <span id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) because Solomon was the
first who abused it; and if you should do the contrary, both you and
your successors would alike lose the Grace hereof. With regard to this
command, I myself having been sought by the Emperor Sigismond, gave him
willingly the best Familiar Spirit which I had; but I steadily refused
to give him the Operation; and it should not be given unto Emperors,
Kings, or other Sovereigns.

\(31\) You may assuredly give, but it is not permissible to sell, this
(Operation), for this would be to abuse the Grace of the Lord who hath
given it unto you, and should you act contrariwise unto this, you would
lose its control.

\(32\) Should you perform this Operation in a town, you should take a
house which is not at all overlooked by any one; seeing that in this
present day <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201.md) Curiosity is so strong
that you ought to be upon your guard; and there ought to be a garden
(adjoining the house) wherein you can take exercise.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

\(33\) Take well heed during the Six Moons or Months to lose no blood
from your body, except that which the expulsive Virtue in you may expel
naturally of its own accord.

\(34\) Finally, during that whole time, you shall touch no dead body of
any description soever.

\(35\) You shall eat during this whole period neither the flesh nor the
blood of any dead animal; and this you shall do for a certain particular
reason. <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md)

\(36\) You shall bind by an Oath him unto whom you shall give this
Operation, neither to give nor sell it unto any avowed Atheist or
Blasphemer of God.

\(37\) You shall fast for three days before giving the Operation unto
any; and he who shall receive it shall do likewise; and he also shall
hand over unto you at the same time the sum of Ten Golden Florins, or
their value, the which you should with your own hand distribute unto
poor persons whom you shall charge to repeat the Psalms, *Miserere Mei
Deus*, etc., "Have mercy upon me, O God and the *De Profundis*, etc.,
"Out of the Depths".

\(38\) It will be a good thing, and one which will facilitate the
Operation, for you to repeat all the Psalms of David, seeing that they
contain great power and virtue; and to say them at least twice in the
week.

Also you shall shun gaming as you would the plague; because it ever is
an occasion of Blasphemy.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Also during this time prayer, and the study of
the Sacred Books, should take the place of gaming with you. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)

All this advice, and much more which you would be certain to receive
from your Angel Guardian, I have here set down, so that by observing the
same perfectly, without failing in the slightest particular, you shall
at the end of the Operation find the value thereof. I am now, therefore,
about to give you distinct and sufficient information how to employ the
Symbols <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) and how to proceed if you
wish to acquire others.

You are then to understand that once he who operateth hath the power, it
is not necessary (in all cases <span id="fr_205"></span>[3](#fn_205).md) to
use written Symbols, but it may suffice to name aloud the Name of the
Spirit, and the form in which you wish him to appear visibly; because
once they <span id="fr_206"></span>[4](#fn_206.md) have taken Oath, this
sufficeth. These Symbols, then, be made for you to avail yourself of
them when you be in the company of other persons; also you must have
them upon you, so that in touching or handling them simply, they may
represent your wish. Immediately then he <span
id="fr_207"></span>[5](#fn_207.md) unto whom the Symbol appertaineth will
serve you punctually; but if you should desire something special which
is in no way connected with or named in the Symbol, it will be

By "jeu," here is evidently meant gaming or gambling, and not simple
recreation and amusement, which latter would be almost a necessity
during this period, to prevent the brain giving way from the intense
nervous strain.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

necessary to signify the same at least by showing your desire by two or
three words. And here it is well to observe, that if you use prudence,
you can often reason with those persons who be with you in such a manner
that the Spirits, having however been beforehand invoked by you, will
understand what they are to do; but it is necessary to discover your
intent unto them by words. For they be of such great intelligence, that
from a single word or a single motive, they can draw the construction of
the whole matter; and although they cannot penetrate into the inmost
parts of the human mind, yet nevertheless by their astuteness and
subtlety they be so adroit that they comprehend by perceptible signs the
wish of the person in question.

But when it is a grave and important matter, you should retire into a
secret place apart, provided it be appropriate, for any place is good to
invoke the Spirits proper unto the Operation. There give them their
commission regarding that which you wish them to perform, the which they
will either execute then or in the days following. But always give them
the signal by word of mouth, or in any other manner that may be pleasing
unto you, whenever you wish them to begin to operate. Thus did ABRAMELIN
in Egypt, JOSEPH in Paris, and as for myself, I have always acted in the
same manner. I have also made myself a very great man, and especially
one who hath been of service unto Princes and great Lords.

I will hereafter tell clearly what Operations belong unto this or unto
that Spirit, and how it is necessary to act.

Now will I teach you how all those (Symbols) which be in this Book, as
well as those which you will (hereafter) receive from the Spirits
(themselves), ought to be written down and acquired. For the number of
Operations is infinite, and it would be an impossibility to set them all
down in this work. If therefore you should

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

wish to perform certain fresh Operations by the use of a Symbol not set
down in any way in the Third Book \[I am speaking of good and
permissible Operations\], <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) you
shall make the demand thereof from your Guardian Angel in this manner:--

Fast the day before, and on the following morning you, being well
washed, shall enter into the Oratory, put on the White Tunic, illumine
the Lamp, and put the Perfume in the Censer. Then lay the Lamen of
Silver upon the Altar, whereof the two Angles shall be touched with the
Holy Anointing Oil; fall upon your knees and make your Orison unto the
Lord, rendering unto Him grace for the benefits which you have received
in general.

Then shall you supplicate Him to be willing to send unto you your Holy
Angel, that he may instruct you in your ignorance, and that he may deign
to grant your demand. After this, invoke your Holy Guardian Angel, and
pray him to favour you with his vision, and to instruct you how you
should design and prepare the Symbol of the Operation desired. Also you
shall remain in prayer until you shall see appear in the room the
Splendour of your Angel. Then wait to see if he shall expound or command
anything touching the form of the Symbol demanded. And when you have
finished your supplication, arise and go to the Plate of Silver, whereon
you shall find written as it were in drops of dew, like a sweat exuding
therefrom, the Symbol as you ought to make it, together with the Name of
the Spirit who should serve you for this Operation, or else that of his
Prince. And without touching or moving the Lamen, copy at once the
Symbol just as it appeareth, and leave the Plate of Metal upon the Altar
until the even; at the which time, after having made your ordinary
Orison, and returned your thanks, you shall put it away in a piece of
clean silk.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

The most convenient Day for procuring these Symbols is the Sabbath;
because by such an Operation, we do not in any way violate (its
sanctity), neither do we injure the same at all. Also we can prepare all
things necessary the day before. But if the Angel should not appear, and
should not in any way manifest unto you the Symbol, then may you be
certain that the pretended Operation, although it may appear good in
your eyes, is not so considered by God and by your Guardian Angel and in
such case you shall change your demands.

Now, as regardeth the Symbols for Evil Operations, these shall you
obtain more easily; seeing that after (putting on) the Perfume, there is
nothing else to do but to make your Orisons. Then being clad in your
White Tunic, you shall put on over it the Silken Vestment and the
Girdle, and after that the Crown, taking the Wand in your hand, and
placing yourself at the side of the Altar towards the Terrace. Then,
holding the Wand, conjure in the same manner as you did on the Second
Day. And when the Spirits shall have appeared, you shall command them in
no way to quit the place, until they shall have manifested unto you the
Symbol of the Operation which you desire, together with the Names of the
Spirits capable of putting the same into execution, together with their
Symbols. And then you shall see the Prince unto whom the Operation
appertaineth avow, write, and sign upon the Sand the Symbol, together
with the Name of the Spirit who is to serve for this Operation. Then
shall you take the Surety and Oath of the Prince upon the Symbol, and
also of his Ministers, as you will have previously done in accordance
with the (directions given in the) Fourteenth Chapter. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) And should several Symbols be given,
make them take Oath upon them all. This being done, you can dismiss them

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

in the manner we have already described, taking heed before this to copy
the Symbols which they shall have traced upon the Sand, because in
departing they will destroy the same. And when they have gone, take the
Censer and perfume the place, as before said.

I do not however write this, so that you may hereby, as well as by the
use of certain of the Symbols described in the Third Book, work Evil; I
have in no way written them down for such an end; but only that you may
understand the full perfection of this Art, and what we can herewith
perform. For the Evil Spirits be exceeding prompt and exceeding obedient
in the working of Evil; it is to be wished that they were as much so for
the Good. However, take heed that you be upon your guard.

And remember, that as there is a God to write these aforesaid Symbols,
there is no particular preparation necessary of Pens, of Ink, and of
Paper; nor yet of elections of particular Days, nor other things to be
observed, which the False Magicians and Enchanters of the Devil would
have you believe. It sufficeth that the Symbols should be clearly
written with any kind of Ink and Pen, provided that we may easily
discern unto what Operation each Sign appertaineth, the which also you
can easily do by means of a properly arranged and drawn up Register of
them. But the greatest part of the Symbols of the Third Book I counsel
you to make before commencing the Operation, keeping them until that
time in the interior of the Altar. And after that the Spirits shall have
taken Oath thereupon, you shall carefully keep (the Symbols) in a safe
place, where they can neither be seen nor touched by any other person,
because thus great harm might befal such person.

Now will we declare unto you what Symbols be manifested by the Good
Angels and what by the Evil, and unto what Prince each Operation is
subject, and lastly, what should be observed as regardeth each Symbol.
