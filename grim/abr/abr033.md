### THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER.

### CONCERNING THE CONVOCATION OF THE SPIRITS. <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md)

<span id="img_tinit"></span>

HOUGH the following advice may be scarcely necessary for the most part,
since I have already explained unto you all things necessary to be done;
and also seeing that your Guardian Angel will have sufficiently
instructed you in all that you should do; yet nevertheless I will here
declare plainly certain matters unto you, with the idea rather of making
the account of the Operation complete in this Book, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) and also to give you every opportunity
of possessing the matter thoroughly through reading these things many
times; so that having received the Vision of the Angel, you may find
yourself thoroughly instructed in all the essential points.

Having then reposed yourself during the night, you shall rise in the
morning before dawn, and shall enter into the Oratory; and having placed
the lighted Charcoal in the Censer, light the Lamp also. You shall then
robe yourself, taking first the White Vestment, and over this you shall
put on that <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md) of Silk and Gold, then
the Girdle, and upon your head you shall place the Crown, and you shall
lay the Wand upon the Altar. Then, having put the Perfume in the Censer
you shall fall upon your knees, and pray unto Almighty God to grant you
the Grace to finish your Operation unto the Praise and Glory of His Holy
Name, and for your own use and that of your neighbour. Also you shall
supplicate your Guardian

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Angel to aid you, and to govern your heart with
his counsel, and all your senses. After this you shall take the Wand in
your right hand, and pray unto God to give unto this Wand as much
virtue, force, and power as He gave unto those of MOSES, of AARON, of
ELIJAH, and of the other Prophets whose number is infinite.

Now place yourself beside the Altar looking towards the Door and the
open Terrace; or if you be in the Country place yourself at the
Western <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) side, and commence by
summoning the Chief Spirits and Princes.

But your Angel will already have instructed you how to convoke them, and
will have sufficiently impressed it on your heart.

And as well in this as in the Orison, we should never proceed and act by
the mouth only or by written Conjurations alone; but with a free heart
and intrepid courage because it is certain that there is more difficulty
in convoking the Evil Spirits <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md) than
the Good, which latter usually appear more readily when they are first
called if it be by persons of good intent; while the Evil Spirits flee
as much as possible all occasion of submitting themselves to man. This
is wherefore he who wisheth to constrain them should be upon his guard,
and follow out faithfully from point to point the instructions which his
Guardian Angel will have given him, and that he impresseth

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

them well upon his memory following them from point to point; seeing
that while no Spirit Good or Evil can know the secrets of your heart.
before you yourself bring the same to light, unless God Who alone
knoweth all things should manifest them; they (the Spirits) nevertheless
can penetrate into and understand that which you are thinking by means
of your actions and your words. <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)
This is the reason why he who wisheth properly to convoke and conjure
the Spirits, should first well consider the following Conjuration; and
afterward perform it with feeling and freely by heart; and not by
writing, because in using that composed by others, the Spirits thence
judge that we ourselves are ignorant, and render themselves straightway
more intractable and stubborn. <span id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) The
Evil Spirits be about you, though invisible, and they keenly examine
whether he who conjureth them is courageous or timid, whether he is
prudent, and whether he hath a true faith in God Who can perform all
things with ease. We can constrain them (the Spirits), and force them to
appear; but a few words ill pronounced by an ill-Intentioned person only
produce an effect against the person himself who ignorantly pronounceth
them; and an individual of such a character should in no way undertake
this Operation, for such would be the true way to make a mock of God and
to tempt Him.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

### OF THE CONJURATIONS.

I have many times repeated unto you that the Fear of God is the
principal subject of the instruction of your Guardian Angel, against
which you should never commit any fault, even if it be but slight.

Firstly: You should perform the Conjuration in your mother tongue, <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) or in a language that you well
understand, and conjure the Spirits by the authority of and their
obedience to the Holy Patriarchs, rehearsing unto them examples of their
ruin and fall, of the sentence which God hath pronounced against them,
and of their obligation unto servitude; and how on one side and on
another they have been vanquished by the Good Angels and by Wise Men;
all which points you will have had plenty of opportunity to study in the
Sacred Writings during the Six Moons (of preparation). Also you shall
menace them, in case they are unwilling to obey, with calling unto your
aid the Power of the Holy Angels over them. Your Guardian Angel will
also have instructed you to perform this Convocation with modesty, and
in no wise to be timid, but courageous, yet in moderation, however,
without too overbearing hardiness and bravery. And in case of their
being inclined to resist, and unwilling to obey you, you must not on
that account give way to anger, because thus you will only do injury to
yourself; and they will ask nothing better, it being exactly what they
would be endeavouring to do; but (on the contrary) with an intrepid
heart, and putting your whole trust in God, with a tranquil heart you
shall exhort them to yield, letting them see that you have put all your
confidence in the Living and Only God, reminding them how

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

powerful and potent He is; thus, therefore, govern yourself, using
prudence towards them.

And communicate unto them also the Form <span
id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) in the which you wish them to appear;
the which you can not determine, nor even themselves, but you ought the
evening before to have demanded this from your Guardian Angel, who
knoweth better than you your nature and constitution, and who
understandeth the forms which can terrify you, and those of which you
can support the sight. <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159.md)

And you must not think that this can he done otherwise, as certain
Accursed Persons write; that is to say, by means of Seals, and
Conjurations, and Superstitious Figures, and Pentacles, and other
Abominations, written by Diabolical Enchanters; <span
id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_160.md) for this would be the coin wherewith the
Hideous SATAN would buy you for his slave.

But let your whole trust be in the Arm, the Power, and the Force of God
Almighty; then shall you be in all safety, and the Guard of your Angel
will defend you from all dangers. This is why you should have good
courage, and have confidence that no adversity can happen unto you.
Observing then the doctrine that your Angel will have given unto you,
and persevering in placing all your trust in God, at length they will
appear in the form commanded upon the Terrace, upon the sand; when,
according to the advice and doctrine received from your

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Holy Angel, and as I will clearly teach you in
the following Chapter, you shall propound your demand, and you shall
receive from them their oath. <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md)

The Spirits which we should convoke on the first day are the Four
Superior Princes, <span id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md) whose Names will
be written in the Nineteenth Chapter, and this is the Conjuration of the
First Day.

### THE CONJURATION OF THE SECOND DAY.

On the following day, having performed the ordinary Orison, and the
aforesaid Ceremonies, you shall briefly repeat the aforesaid Conjuration
unto the said Spirits, bringing to their remembrance their promises and
Oaths made on the preceding day to send unto you the Eight
Sub-Princes; <span id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_163.md) and address the
Conjuration unto all the Twelve together, and in a little while they
will appear visibly, the Eight Sub-Princes in the form which hath been
commanded them; and they will promise and swear unto you (allegiance),
as will be more fully shown in the following Chapter.

The Names of the Eight Sub-Princes are described hereafter in the
Nineteenth <span id="fr_164"></span>[4](#fn_164.md) Chapter.

### THE CONJURATION OF THE THIRD DAY.

The Conjuration of the Third Day is the same as that of the Second Day,
seeing that we are then to remind the Eight Sub-Princes of their
Promises and Oaths (of Allegiance); and we are to call and convoke them
with all their adherents, and then they do appear once

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

more in visible forms, the whole particular cohorts of each will appear
also invisibly, surrounding the Eight Sub-Princes. But while invoking
God your Lord for strength and surety, and your Holy Angel for counsel
and assistance, never forget what the latter will have taught you, for
it is a necessary point.

Here followeth the Fifteenth Chapter which teacheth what we should
demand from the Spirits, who are divided into three classes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[86:1](abr033.htm#fr_150.md) *I.e.*, those of a
material force; many being evil, some few inclined to good, most of a
mixed nature somewhat good yet the evil predominating in their
dispositions.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[86:2](abr033.htm#fr_151.md) *I.e.*, this Second
Book of the three constituting the treatise.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[86:3](abr033.htm#fr_152.md) *I.e.*, the Red Robe,
or Mantle.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[87:1](abr033.htm#fr_153.md) "*Ou si vous estez en
Campagne mettes vous ducosté du ponant*." This word "*ponant*" is almost
obsolete in modern French, being only employed in a nautical sense, and
even then but rarely. It implies the "West," or rather the part of the
"Ocean towards the West". Even in the middle ages this expression was
not in wide use. The Occult student will remark here the idea of
"turning to the East to pray, and to the West to invoke". But usually in
Magic it is advisable to turn towards the quarter sympathetic in nature
with that of the Spirit you wish to summon.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[87:2](abr033.htm#fr_154.md) That is if you
convoke them to *serve you*. But all mediæval tradition implies that
they are ready enough to come if you are an evil-minded person wishing
to make a pact with them to obtain magical force, *i.e.* a Göetic
Magician as opposed to an Initiate Adept.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[88:1](abr033.htm#fr_155.md) This is why in
religious and magical writings such stress is laid on the importance of
controlling the *thoughts*; which are as it were our prototypical speech
and action in all matters of importance. Modern thought-reading would
alone suggest this to persons unskilled in Occultism.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[88:2](abr033.htm#fr_156.md) "*Les Esprits jugent
parla denostre ignoranse et serendent plus reveches et ostinez*." The
initiate knows the value of an invocation written by himself, in harmony
with and expressing exactly his will and idea. But this does not deny
the utility of many of the Conjurations handed down by tradition.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[89:1](abr033.htm#fr_157.md) Yet the advantage of
its being in a language which you do not immediately associate with the
things of every-day life is great, provided always that you understand
the words and repeat them and pronounce them correctly.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[90:1](abr033.htm#fr_158.md) This recalls the
phrase so frequent in Conjurations, in which the Spirits are commanded
to appear "in human form without any *deformity or tortuosity*".

<span id="fn_159"></span>[90:2](abr033.htm#fr_159.md) Because some of the
Demonic forms are so terrible that the shock of their sight might cause
a person of a nervous temperament to lose his reason.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[90:3](abr033.htm#fr_160.md) I must again repeat
that it is only evil and perverted symbols which come under this
denunciation of Abraham the Jew; for nearly all Pentacles and Seals are
the Symbols and Sigils of Divine and Angelic Names.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[91:1](abr033.htm#fr_161.md) *I.e.*, of allegiance
to you.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[91:2](abr033.htm#fr_162.md) The four Superior
Spirits and Princes are: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan, and Belial.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[91:3](abr033.htm#fr_163.md) The Eight Sub-Princes
are: Astaroth, Magoth, Asmodeus, Beelzebuth; Oriens, Païmon, Ariton, and
Amaymon.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[91:4](abr033.htm#fr_164.md) By a very evident
slip, "*Chapitre* IX." is written in the MS. instead of XIX.
