HE two first Moons being finished; the two second Moons follow, during
the which ye shall make your prayer, morning and evening at the hour
accustomed; but before entering into the Oratory ye shall wash your
hands and face thoroughly with pure water. And you shall prolong your
prayer with the greatest possible affection, devotion and submission;
humbly entreating the Lord God that He would deign to command His Holy

\[paragraph continues\] Angels to lead you in the True Way, and Wisdom,
and Knowledge, by studying the which assiduously in the Sacred Writings
there will arise more and more (Wisdom) in your heart.

The use of the rights of Marriage is permitted, but should scarcely if
at all be made use of (during this period).

You shall also wash your whole body every Sabbath Eve.

As to what regardeth commerce and manner of living, I have already given
unto you sufficient instruction.

Only it is absolutely necessary to retire from the world and seek
retreat; and ye shall lengthen your prayers to the utmost of your
ability.

As for eating, drinking and clothing, ye shall govern yourselves in
exactly the same manner as in the two first Moons; except that ye shall
fast (the Qabalistical fast) every Sabbath Eve.

NOTE WELL: The Sabbath is for the Jews, who are accustomed to observe
the same every Saturday, but for Christians the Sabbath is the Sunday,
and they <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) ought to consider the
Saturday as its Eve.
