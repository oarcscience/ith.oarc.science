### NOTES TO CHAPTER III.

(*a*) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angel or by
the Guardian Angel.

(*b*) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the operations hereof
by means of their common Ministers.

(*c*) The Familiar Spirits do not execute the Operations of this
Chapter.

(*d*) Take the Symbol in the hand, and name the Spirit desired, who will
appear in the form commanded.

(*e*) It will be noticed at once that of the four Symbols of this
Chapter, the first has the name of the Archangel Uriel, and the three
others those of three of the Chief Princes of the Demons,
*viz.*;--Lucifer, Leviathan, and Satan.

No. 1 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--URIEL from Hebrew AURIEL = Light of
God.--RAMIE from Hebrew RMIH = Deceit. IMIMI is either from IMM = the
Sea, or great waters, or from IMIM = Mules--EIMAR is probably from AMR
or IMR = To speak.--LEIRU is the reverse of URIEL, *i.e.*, Uriel written
backwards.--This formula seems to show that the Symbol should be
numbered 2 instead of 1.

No. 2 is an Acrostic of 49 Squares.--LUCIFER from Lucifer (Latin) =
Light bearer. This Square should probably be numbered 3.

No. 3 is an Acrostic of 64 Squares.--LEVIATAN from Hebrew,= the piercing
or twisting Serpent. This Square should probably be numbered 1.

No. 4 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--SATAN from Hebrew SHTN an
Adversary.--ADAMA from Hebrew ADMH reddish earth.
