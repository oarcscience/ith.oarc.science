### NOTES TO CHAPTER II.

(*a*) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested partly by the Angels,
and partly by the Evil Spirits.

(*b*) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Operations hereof
by the means of their common Ministers.

(*c*) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent execute the Operations of
this Chapter.

(*d*) Take the Symbol in your hand, and name what information you
require. (In the Second Book, the remarks given concerning this Chapter
are evidently far more applicable to the Third Chapter, and I have
therefore given them there instead of here.)

(*e*) No. 1 is an Acrostic of 25 Squares.--ALLUP from Hebrew ALUP = a
Doctor, Teacher, Leader, *i.e.*, a person who at the same time leads and
instructs his following. Hence also this word means a Bull as the Leader
of the herd.--URIEL, Hebrew AURIEL = Light of God, is the well-known
name of one of the Archangels. Pulla in Latin means both a fowl, and
also light friable earth; but is probably here derivable rather from the
Hebrew PLH, meaning to classify or arrange.

No. 2 is an Acrostic of 64 Squares.--MELAMMED is evidently from Hebrew
MLMD = a stimulus or spur to exertion.

No. 3 is an Acrostic of 49 Squares.--EKDILUN *may* be from the Greek
EKDEILON, which means, "not afraid of"; from EK in composition, and
DEILON, frightened, cowardly.
