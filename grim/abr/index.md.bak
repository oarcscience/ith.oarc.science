This remarkable grimoire was translated by S.L.M. Mathers from a 15th
century French mauscript. This text has had a huge influence on modern
ceremonial magic, and has been cited as a primary influence on Aleister
Crowley. Abraham of Würzburg, a cabalist and scholar of magic, describes
a quest for the secret teachings which culminated in Egypt, where he
encountered the magician Abramelin, who taught him his system in detail.
The procedure involves many months of purification, followed by the
invocation of good and evil spirits to accomplish some very worldly
goals, including acquisition of treasure and love, travel through the
air and under water, and raising armies out of thin air. It also tells
of raising the dead, transforming ones appearance, becoming invisible,
and starting storms. The key to this is a set of remarkable magic
squares, sigils consisting of mystical words which in most cases can be
read in several directions. Of course, these diagrams are said to have
no potency unless used in the appropriate ritual context by an initiate.
Mathers analyzed these words in an extensive set of notes and gives
possible derivations from Hebrew, Greek and other languages.
