Chapter XXII. (This Chapter is only for Evil, for with the Symbols

The Operations of the following Chapters can also (to a great extent) be
administered by the Familiar Spirits, namely:--

Chapter II. (Scientific Information.)

Chapter IV. (Visions.)

Chapter XII. (Secrets of other persons.)

Chapter XVIII. (Healing of Maladies.)

Chapter XIX. (Affection and Love.)

Chapter XXIII. (Demolishing Buildings.)

Chapter XXIV. (Discovery of Theft.

Chapter XXVII. (Causing Visions to appear.)

Chapter XXVIII. (Obtaining Money.)

Chapter XXX. (Visions of Operas, Comedies, etc.)

If at the beginning they excuse themselves from the performance, there
is probably some hindering cause, and in this case you should make use
of other Spirits; but otherwise they must obey you in and throughout
everything that you shall command them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_211"></span>[138:1](abr042.htm#fr_211.md) Here again I am
giving the headings of the Chapters of the Third Book at length; as by
so doing they form a species of Key to the character, nature and offices
of the Prince who governs their Operations.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[140:1](abr042.htm#fr_212.md) in addition to the
chapters here given, Magoth is said to rule the operations of Chapter
XIV. (Invisibility), in the special instructions of Abraham, the Jew,
concerning that chapter.
