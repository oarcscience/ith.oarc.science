N order to describe the aforesaid and other considerations in the best
possible manner; I will here make a general recapitulation; mentioning
also first what may bring hindrance unto the matter.

It is, then, necessary that such a man <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94) give himself up unto a tranquil life, and
that his habits be temperate; that he should love retirement; that he
should be given neither unto avarice nor usury (that he should be the
legitimate child of his parents is a good thing, but not as necessary as
for the Qabalah, unto which no man born of a clandestine marriage <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_95) can attain); his age ought not to be less
than twenty-five years nor more than fifty; he should have no hereditary
disease, such as virulent leprosy; whether he be free or married
importeth little; a valet, lackey, or other domestic servant, can with
difficulty arrive at the end required, being bound unto others and not
having the conveniences at disposal which are necessary, and which this
Operation demandeth. Among women, there be only Virgins who are
suitable; but I <span id="fr_96"></span>[3](#fn_96),

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

strongly advise that so important a matter should not be communicated to
them, because of the accidents that they might cause by their curiosity
and love of talk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_94"></span>[55:1](abr022.htm#fr_94) *I.e.*, he who intends
to undertake the Operation.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[55:2](abr022.htm#fr_95) I doubt this assertion
very much.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[55:3](abr022.htm#fr_96) Here comes another
touch of prejudice. In the present day many of the profoundest students
of the Qabalah are women, both married and single.
