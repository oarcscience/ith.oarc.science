<TABLE  ALIGN="LEFT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/tinit.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT"></TD></TR></TABLE>HE Wisdom of the Lord is an inexhaustible fountain, neither hath there ever been a man born who could penetrate its veritable origin and foundation. The Sages and Holy Fathers have drunk long draughts thereof, and have been fully satisfied therewith. But with all this, not one among them hath been able to comprehend or know the Radical Principles, because the Creator of all things reserveth that unto Himself; and, like a jealous God, He hath indeed wished that we should enjoy the fruit thereof, but He hath not wished to permit us to touch either the Tree or its Root. It is then not only proper, but further also we are compelled to conform ourselves unto the Will of the Lord, walking in that Path, by the which also our predecessors went, without seeking out through a vain curiosity how it is that God reigneth and governeth in His Divine Wisdom; because such would be a very great presumption and a bestial conceit. Let us then content ourselves with only knowing how many blessings He hath granted unto us Sinners, and what extent of power He hath given unto us mortals over all things, and in what way it is permitted unto us to use them. Let us then content ourselves with this, laying aside all other curiosity, observing without any comment that which shall be set down in this Book with fidelity. And if ye do follow my advice, ye shall be infallibly comforted thereby.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
