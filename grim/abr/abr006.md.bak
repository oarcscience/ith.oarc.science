LTHOUGH this First Book serveth rather for prologue than for the actual
rules to acquire this Divine and Sacred Magic nevertheless, O! Lamech,
my son, thou wilt therein find certain examples and other matters <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) which will be none the less useful and
profitable unto thee than the precepts and dogmas which I shall give
thee in the Second and Third Books. Wherefore thou shalt not neglect the
study of this First Book, which shall serve thee for an
introduction <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) unto the Veritable and
Sacred Magic, and unto the practice of that which I, ABRAHAM, THE SON OF
SIMON, have learned, in part from my father, and in part also from other
Wise and faithful Men, and which I have found true and real, having
submitted it unto proof and experiment. And having written this with
mine own hand, I have placed it within this casket, and locked it up, as
a most precious treasure; in order that when thou hast arrived at a
proper age thou mayest be able to admire, to consider, and to enjoy the
marvels of the Lord; as well as thine elder brother Joseph, who, as the
first-born, hath received from me the Holy Tradition of the
Qabalah. <span id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15.md)

circonstances*.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[3:3](abr006.htm#fr_15.md) I consider this a truer
orthography of the word than the usual rendering of "Cabala".
