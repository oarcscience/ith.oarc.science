### NOTES TO CHAPTER XXX.

(*a*) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Evil
Spirits.

(*b*) MAGOT performs the Operations hereof.

(*c*) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent perform the Operations of
this Chapter.

(*d*) No especial instructions are given by Abraham regarding this
Chapter.

(*e*) No. 1 consists of 18 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. NAGINAH
= "a stringed instrument".

No. 2 consists of a Gnomon of 13 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares.
MEKOLAH = "Singing".

No. 3 is a Gnomon of 13 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. NIGIGIN =
"musical instruments," probably.

No. 4 consists of 21 Squares from a Square of 49 Squares. MECASEF means
"enchantment".

 

This finishes the list of Symbols set down by Abraham the Jew, the which
I have given in their entirety; but I must of my own initiative warn any
who may endeavour to use these Signs, that unless animated by the purest
and best motives they will find them react terribly against them; and
that, if the preliminary period of Six Months' preparation advocated by
Abra-Melin be not observed, the Symbols will be practically worthless in
their hands; for, as will be observed, the Names in the Squares for the
most part are simply the statement of the ends desired to be
accomplished thereby.

Finally, I will quote the following passage from the "Key of Solomon the
King":--

"ACCURSED BE HE WHO TAKETH THE NAME OF GOD IN VAIN! ACCURSED BE HE WHO
USETH THIS KNOWLEDGE UNTO AN EVIL END. BE HE ACCURSED IN THIS WORLD AND
IN THE WORLD TO COME. AMEN. BE HE ACCURSED IN THE NAME WHICH HE HATH
BLASPHEMED!"
