<P>We are the many-born. We are the immortal. We have been known by many names throughout the ages, though few have understood the truth of our existence.</P>
<P>Endlessly, we die and are reborn, changed yet unchanging throughout the ages. We move from lifetime to lifetime, taking up bodies as garments.</P>
<P>We are watchers and we are wanderers.</P>
<P><BR>
We seek knowledge and understanding above all.</P>
<P>Long ago we strove the sunder the life of our body from our roving minds, for it grounded us. It held us back. It bound us to a single span of days. Through a ritual of death and rebirth, we severed our living ties and gained immortality.</P>
<P>Now we are freed of the life of the body, but we are irrevocably tied to the life we cut away. It sustains us and empowers us.</P>
<P>We thirst for life and we feed upon it.</P>
<P><BR>
It is our greatest weakness and our greatest prize.</P>
