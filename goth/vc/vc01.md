#### I. The Kheprian Charge

We are the many-born. We are the immortal. We have been known by many
names throughout the ages, though few have understood the truth of our
existence.

Endlessly, we die and are reborn, changed yet unchanging throughout the
ages. We move from lifetime to lifetime, taking up bodies as garments.

We are watchers and we are wanderers.

  
We seek knowledge and understanding above all.

Long ago we strove the sunder the life of our body from our roving
minds, for it grounded us. It held us back. It bound us to a single span
of days. Through a ritual of death and rebirth, we severed our living
ties and gained immortality.

Now we are freed of the life of the body, but we are irrevocably tied to
the life we cut away. It sustains us and empowers us.

We thirst for life and we feed upon it.

  
It is our greatest weakness and our greatest prize.
