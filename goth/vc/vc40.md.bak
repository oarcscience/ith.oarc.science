#### XLIII. Creating Filters

We are constantly pulling energy into ourselves. This function is
unconscious and often undiscerning. When you are among a group of
people, you will draw upon the ambient energy that is generated by that
group. Occasionally, there is a quality to the energy of a group that
you may not wish to take into yourself. This is especially true if many
of the individuals in the group are tainted in some way, as with
illness, intoxication, or drug-use.

Rather than shielding yourself and thus blocking yourself off from all
the energy in the room, you may set up a filter. Less rigid and opaque
than a true shield, a filter allows you to sort through all that you
take in and block certain elements of that energy out. A filter may
target certain emotions which you do not wish to vicariously experience
or they may filter out the taint of alcohol, drugs, or disease so you do
not draw these things into yourself during a general crowd feed.

Target the specific energy that you do not wish to take in. Visualize a
filter, like a porous shield, that will allow everything to pass through
except this particular energy. If you are actively drawing from the
crowd around you, simply be selective in what you pull into yourself
through nets or tendrils. Isolate the unwanted energy from everything
else and discard it before you actively pull the rest through. All this
requires is an awareness of yourself and your surroundings on the subtle
level.

A filter can also be used to take only a specific sort of energy in.
Simply isolate that element among the ambient energy, focus on it, then
draw upon it to the exclusion of all else. As the subtle and the
physical are intricately interwoven, this can work on chemicals present
in your target's system. Though physical contact facilitates this
technique, it can be done with effort from a distance. In this way, you
can focus on the drugs in someone's system and pull them away, thus
robbing them of their high. Treat the drugs as you would any intrusion
on the subtle level, grabbing onto them with your subtle body but not
pulling them into yourself.

If you grab onto the drugs or alcohol present in another's system in
this way and pull them into yourself, you will experience the effects of
the drugs vicariously. Sometimes this is desirable. Simply focus on
someone who is suitably intoxicated, focus on the element present in
their systems that is responsible for the intoxication, and draw it into
yourself. Once again, this is most efficiently done with person to
person physical contact, but can be effected in a group or long-distance
draw.

Because you have the ability to manipulate energy on such a level, you
can also consciously burn the resulting intoxication out of your system
whenever you choose. Simply extend your awareness within yourself, focus
on the intoxicant, gather it up and cast it away. This works to a
certain degree even it you have physically imbibed the intoxicant.
