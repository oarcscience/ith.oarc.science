#### XLVII. Cycles

We are the many-born. We are the immortal. Eternal, we wander the aeons,
moving to the rhythm of our own inner tides. We are active elements
moving through passive worlds.

We insure that energy is in constant motion. That which is static, we
cause to move. That which has grown stagnant, we tear away.

We separate the subtle from the dense, spirit from matter. We are agents
of the dynamic balance which keeps the universe in constant motion. We
separate the dual aspects of reality in order to reunite them. We seek
the union of opposites which transforms all things.

Ours is a journey toward understanding, and our charge is knowledge and
wisdom. We are the catalysts, and we must serve to awaken the slumbering
world to its deepest levels of reality.
