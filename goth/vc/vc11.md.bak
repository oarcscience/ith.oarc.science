#### XI. Separateness

Our strength and our weakness is life. We depend upon the vital force,
for lacking enough of it ourselves, we are forced to glean it from
others.

In this we are self-serving and self-preserving, though good and evil
cannot be applied to our state. We know what we need, and we know we
must take it, sometimes to the detriment of others. This is an
unavoidable fact of reality.

We are predators at heart, even though we are physically
indistinguishable from our prey. The spirit within us sets us apart. Our
perceptions, our passions, and our powers make us strangers among
ordinary men. Even if we refuse to act upon our more destructive
impulses, we keenly feel the difference between us and those who do not
share what we are. No matter how hard we try to blend in, we can never
truly belong.

This is a blessing and a curse. The lives we live are fuller and more
dynamic than anything most others might imagine. The levels of reality
we are privy to make the world a profound and wondrous place. Yet there
are few who can share our insights. Thus, we tend to be solitary,
feeding alone, rarely interacting with those who would not and could not
understand. Our utter separateness drives us to seek out companionship
among our own kind for it is here only that we find true acceptance and
understanding.

We may find friends and allies among the Awakened, but they can never
truly understand what we are and what that means within the context of
so many different lives. There are some experiences they can neither
accept nor share, and thus there is always something lacking when in
their company.

Thus we should always treasure those who are of our nature. They are our
companions throughout the many, many long years. Time and again, we will
find one another, for the bonds between us are never broken or worn
thin.

We can love and hate one another with great passion, yet we are forever
loyal to our own.
