#### XXVII. Priests

Those of our number who are most disconnected from the physical side of
the threshold have the greatest range of sensitivity and power at their
disposal, but they suffer the greatest weaknesses. They are few in
number and many have not survived the passing millennia as their
disconnectedness from the flesh can often lead them to reside purely in
spirit. The demands of the balance they struggle to maintain while in
the flesh are extreme, and over the years, it has taken its toll. These
individuals are our priests, and they often command the greatest respect
for the level of awareness they can attain.

The priest's physical body is inextricably linked to his psychical
well-being. If his power begins to wane and he approaches need, his
health will suffer, for he can no longer compensate for the lost energy
center in his subtle body. Need, especially deep need, can be physically
debilitating for one of this caste, and if left to go too long without
feeding, they can be reduced to invalids, hollow shells of what they
could be.

Priests are very sensitive to the changing cycles. Much of their power
wanes during the day, then waxes full with the approach of night. They
suffer the most under direct light and must take pains to avoid
sunstroke. Their systems are sensitive to most complex foods, especially
when in deep need. Of all our kind, their physical bodies are the most
concretely affected by their spiritual state. Thus, they are the most
likely of our number to be recognized for what they are for their nature
manifests itself in very physical ways.

The priest requires a greater quantity and a finer quality of energy
than any other of our number. He, more so than any other, is constantly
pulling energy into himself. This occurs on an unconscious, instinctive
level, and though it can be consciously dampened, it cannot be shut off
completely. However, even this constant draw will not sustain the priest
unless coupled with conscious feeding.

Priests are the only of our number that must feed deeply on a regular
basis. This entails feeding from the energy at the very core of another
rather than simply skimming energy from their surface. This is a draw
which encompasses all of the energy centers at once, and can leave the
partner burned (suffering extreme effects of energy loss) the next day.

Because they stand upon the threshold between matter and spirit, the
priests have access to the greatest range of powers inherent in our
kind. However, priests run the risk of being mentally or emotionally
unstable because of the strain such power puts on their systems. They
must develop strong egos and indomitable wills in order to bear up under
the burden of their power, but this may lead them to become domineering,
arrogant, and obsessed with control.

Moderation as well as control are the two rules a priest must live by.
With great power comes great responsibility, and those of the priestly
caste who do not understand or respect this doctrine will end up
bringing harm to both themselves and others. A priest must feed
carefully, always drawing away before feeling completely satisfied. He
must never give in to the urge to pull all of his partner into himself,
to devour for the sake of devouring. Priests hold the power of life and
death, sanity and madness over their partners, and they must recognize
this power and use it responsibly.

The priest's way must ever be the way of balance. He must sacrifice
satiation for the safety of the partner. He must accept physical
weakness and pain in exchange for the ability to manipulate the subtle
energies of all around him. He must accept the pull of his constant need
in exchange for the ability to feed upon his partners in so profound a
manner that he will come to grasp and understand their very essence.
