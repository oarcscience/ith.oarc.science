#### XIV. Assimilating Energy

When we feed, we must take the life energy of others. It cannot be
given. It can be offered freely, but still we must do the taking. This
is fundamental to the way in which we must process the energy for use
ourselves.

When we draw in energy from another, it is transformed through the
feeding process into energy we can assimilate and use. If another,
however well-meaning, seeks to force energy into us, it will do us
little good. The energy must be assimilated to match our own if we are
to benefit from it.

It is very difficult for us to assimilate any energy beyond that of
life. Others may draw their strength from the earth, the elements, even
the stars, but we are bound to life by our lack of it. Some of us are
more disconnected from life than others, and this is reflected in what
and how much we can feed from in order to sustain ourselves. Few of us
can feed from alternate sources, but when we can, it is a blessing which
should not be ignored.
