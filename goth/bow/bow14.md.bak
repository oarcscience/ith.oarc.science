# CHAPTER XIII.

### MARÉCHAL DE RETZ.--III. THE SENTENCE AND EXECUTION.

The adjourned Trial--The Marshal Confesses--The Case handed over to the
Ecclesiastical Tribunal--Prompt steps taken by the Bishop--The
Sentence--Ratified by the Secular Court--The Execution.

ON the 24th October the trial of the Maréchal de Retz was resumed. The
prisoner entered in a Carmelite habit, knelt and prayed in silence
before the examination began. Then he ran his eye over the court, and
the sight of the rack, windlass, and cords made a slight shudder run
through him.

"Messire Gilles de Laval," began the president; "you appear before me
now for the second time to answer to a certain requisition read by M. le
Lieutenant du Procureur de Nantes."

"I shall answer frankly, monseigneur," said the prisoner calmly; "but I
reserve the right of appeal to

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

the benign intervention of the very venerated majesty of the King of
France, of whom I am, or have been, chamberlain and marshal, as may be
proved by my letters patent duly enregistered in the parliament at
Paris--"

"This is no affair of the King of France," interrupted Pierre de
l'Hospital; "if you were chamberlain and marshal of his Majesty, you are
also vassal of his grace the Duke of Brittany."

"I do not deny it; but, on the contrary, I trust to his Grace of
Brittany to allow me to retire to a convent of Carmelites, there to
repent me of my sins."

"That is as may be; will you confess, or must I send you to the rack?"

"Torture me not!" exclaimed Gilles de Retz "I will confess all. Tell me
first, what have Henriet and Pontou said?"

"They have confessed. M. le Lieutenant du Procureur shall read you their
allegations."

"Not so," said the lieutenant, who continued to show favour to the
accused; "I pronounce them false, unless Messire de Retz confirms them
by oath, which God forbid!"

Pierre de l'Hospital made a motion of anger to check

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

this scandalous pleading in favour of the accused, and then nodded to
the clerk to read the evidence.

The Sire do Retz, on hearing that his servants had made such explicit
avowals of their acts, remained motionless, as though thunderstruck. He
saw that it was in vain for him to equivocate, and that he would have to
confess all.

"What have you to say?" asked the president, when the confessions of
Henriet and Pontou had been read.

"Say what befits you, my lord," interrupted the lieutenant du procureur,
as though to indicate to the accused the line he was to take: "are not
these abominable lies and calumnies trumped up to ruin you?"

"Alas, no!" replied the Sire do Retz; and his face was pale as death:
"Henriet and Pontou have spoken the truth. God has loosened their
tongues."

"My lord! relieve yourself of the burden of your crimes by acknowledging
them at once," said M. do l'Hospital earnestly.

"Messires!" said the prisoner, after a moment's silence: "it is quite
true that I have robbed mothers of their little ones; and that I have
killed their

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

children, or caused them to be killed, either by cutting their throats
with daggers or knives, or by chopping off their heads with cleavers; or
else I have had their skulls broken by hammers or sticks; sometimes I
had their limbs hewn off one after another; at other times I have ripped
them open, that I might examine their entrails and hearts; I have
occasionally strangled them or put them to a slow death; and when the
children were dead I had their bodies burned and reduced to ashes."

"When did you begin your execrable practices?" asked Pierre de
l'Hospital, staggered by the frankness of these horrible avowals: "the
evil one must have possessed you."

"It came to me from myself,--no doubt at the instigation of the devil:
but still these acts of cruelty afforded me incomparable delight. The
desire to commit these atrocities came upon me eight years ago. I left
court to go to Chantoncé, that I might claim the property of my
grandfather, deceased. In the library of the castle I found a Latin
book--*Suetonius*, I believe--full of accounts of the cruelties of the
Roman Emperors. I read the charming history of Tiberius, Caracalla, and
other Cæsars, and the pleasure they took in watching the agonies of
tortured children. Thereupon I resolved

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

to imitate and surpass these same Cæsars, and that very night I began to
do so. For some while I confided my secret to no one, but afterwards I
communicated it to my cousin, Gilles de Sillé, then to Master Roger de
Briqueville, next in succession to Henriet, Pontou, Rossignol, and
Robin." He then confirmed all the accounts given by his two servants. He
confessed to about one hundred and twenty murders in a single year.

"An average of eight hundred in less than seven years!" exclaimed Pierre
de l'Hospital, with a cry of pain: "Ah! messire, you were possessed! "

His confession was too explicit and circumstantial for the Lieutenant du
Procureur to say another word in his defence; but he pleaded that the
case should be made over to the ecclesiastical court, as there were
confessions of invocations of the devil and of witchcraft mixed up with
those of murder. Pierre de l'Hospital saw that the object of the
lieutenant was to gain time for Mme. de Retz to make a fresh attempt to
obtain a pardon; however he was unable to resist, so he consented that
the case should be transferred to the bishop's court.

But the bishop was not a man to let the matter

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

slip, and there and then a sergeant of the bishop summoned Gilles de
Laval, Sire do Retz, to appear forthwith before the ecclesiastical
tribunal. The marshal was staggered by this unexpected citation, and he
did not think of appealing against it to the president; he merely signed
his readiness to follow, and he was at once conducted into the
ecclesiastical court assembled hurriedly to try him.

This new trial lasted only a few hours.

The marshal, now thoroughly cowed, made no attempt to defend himself,
but he endeavoured to bribe the bishop into leniency, by promises of the
surrender of all his lands and goods to the Church, and begged to be
allowed to retire into the Carmelite monastery at Nantes.

His request was peremptorily refused, and sentence of death was
pronounced against him.

On the 25th October, the ecclesiastical court having pronounced
judgment, the sentence was transmitted to the secular court, which had
now no pretext upon which to withhold ratification.

There was some hesitation as to the kind of death the marshal was to
suffer. The members of the secular tribunal were not unanimous on this
point. The president

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

put it to the vote, and collected the votes himself; then he reseated
himself, covered his head, and said in a solemn voice:--

"The court, notwithstanding the quality, dignity, and nobility of the
accused, condemns him to be hung and burned. Wherefore I admonish you
who are condemned, to ask pardon of God, and grace to die well, in great
contrition for having committed the said crimes. And the said sentence
shall be carried into execution to-morrow morning between eleven and
twelve o'clock." A similar sentence was pronounced upon Henriet and
Pontou.

On the morrow, October 26th, at nine o'clock in the morning, a general
procession composed of half the people of Nantes, the clergy and the
bishop bearing the blessed Sacrament, left the cathedral and went round
the city visiting each of the principal churches, where masses were said
for the three under sentence.

At eleven the prisoners were conducted to the place of execution, which
was in the meadow of Biesse, on the further side of the Loire.

Three gibbets had been erected, one higher than the others, and beneath
each was a pile of faggots, tar, and brushwood.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

It was a glorious, breezy day, not a cloud was to be seen in the blue
heavens; the Loire rolled silently towards the sea its mighty volumes of
turbid water, seeming bright and blue as it reflected the brilliancy and
colour of the sky. The poplars shivered and whitened in the fresh air
with a pleasant rustle, and the willows flickered and wavered above the
stream.

A vast crowd had assembled round the gallows; it was with difficulty
that a way was made for the condemned, who came on chanting the *De
profundis*. The spectators of all ages took up the psalm and chanted it
with them, so that the surge of the old Gregorian tone might have been
heard by the duke and the bishop, who had shut themselves up in the
château of Nantes during the hour of execution.

After the close of the psalm, which was terminated by the *Requiem
æternam* instead of the *Gloria*, the Sire de Retz thanked those who had
conducted him, and then embraced Pontou and Henriet, before delivering
himself of the following address, or rather sermon:--

"My very dear friends and servants, be strong and courageous against the
assaults of the devil, and feel great displeasure and contrition for
your ill deeds, without despairing of God's mercy. Believe with me,

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

that there is no sin, however great, in the world, which God, in his
grace and loving kindness, will not pardon, when one asks it of Him with
contrition of heart. Remember that the Lord God is always more ready to
receive the sinner than is the sinner to ask of Him pardon. Moreover,
let us very humbly thank Him for his great love to us in letting us die
in full possession of our faculties, and not cutting us off suddenly in
the midst of our misdeeds. Let us conceive such a love of God, and such
repentance, that we shall not fear death, which is only a little pang,
without which we could not see God in his glory. Besides we must desire
to be freed from this world, in which is only misery, that we may go to
everlasting glory. Let us rejoice rather, for although we have sinned
grievously here below, yet we shall be united in Paradise, our souls
being parted from our bodies, and we shall be together for ever and
ever, if only we endure in our pious and honourable contrition to our
last sigh."\[1\] Then the marshal, who was to be executed first, left
his companions and placed himself in

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The case of the Sire de Retz is one to make us see the great danger
there is in trusting to feelings in matters of religion. "If thou wilt
enter into life, keep the commandments," said our Lord. How many hope to
go to heaven because they have pious emotions!\]

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

the hands of his executioners. He took off his cap, knelt, kissed a
crucifix, and made a pious oration to the crowd much in the style of his
address to his friends Pontou and Henriet.

Then he commenced reciting the prayers of the dying; the executioner
passed the cord round his neck, and adjusted the knot. He mounted a tall
stool, erected at the foot of the gallows as a last honour paid to the
nobility of the criminal. The pile of firewood was lighted before the
executioners had left him.

Pontou and Henriet, who were still on their knees, raised their eyes to
their master and cried to him, extending their arms,--

"At this last hour, monseigneur, be a good and valiant soldier of God,
and remember the passion of Jesus Christ which wrought our redemption.
Farewell, we hope soon to meet in Paradise!

The stool was cast down, and the Sire de Retz dropped. The fire roared
up, the flames leaped about him, and enveloped him as be swung.

Suddenly, mingling with the deep booming of the cathedral bell, swelled
up the wild unearthly wail of the *Dies iræ*.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

No sound among the crowd, only the growl of the fire, and the solemn
strain of the hymn

Lo, the Book, exactly worded,  
Wherein all hath been recorded;  
Thence shall judgment be awarded.

When the Judge his seat attaineth,  
And each hidden deed arraigneth,  
Nothing unavenged remaineth.

What shall I, frail man, be pleading?  
Who for me be interceding?  
When the just are mercy needing.

King of Majesty tremendous,  
Who dost free salvation send us,  
Fount of pity! then befriend us.

\*    \*    \*    \*

Low I kneel, with heart-submission;  
See, like ashes, my contrition--  
Help me in my last condition!

Ah I that day of tears and mourning!  
From the dust of earth returning,  
Man for judgment must prepare him!  
Spare, O, God, in mercy spare him!  
Lord, who didst our souls redeem,  
Grant a blessed requiem!

AMEN.

Six women, veiled, and robed in white, and six Carmelites advanced.
bearing a coffin.

It was whispered that one of the veiled women was

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

Madame de Retz, and that the others were members of the most illustrious
houses of Brittany.

The cord by which the marshal was hung was cut, and he fell into a
cradle of iron prepared to receive the corpse. The body was removed
before the fire had gained any mastery over it. It was placed in the
coffin., and the monks and the women transported it to the Carmelite
monastery of Nantes, according to the wishes of the deceased.

In the meantime, the sentence had been executed upon Pontou and Henriet;
they were hung and burned to dust. Their ashes were cast to the winds;
whilst in the Carmelite church of Our Lady were celebrated with pomp the
obsequies of the very high, very powerful, very illustrious Seigneur
Gilles de Laval, Sire de Retz, late Chamberlain of King Charles VII.,
and Marshal of France!
