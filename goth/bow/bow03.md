# CHAPTER II.

### LYCANTHROPY AMONG THE ANCIENTS.

Definition of Lycanthropy--Marcellus
Sidetes--Virgil--Herodotus--Ovid--Pliny--Agriopas--Story from
Petronius--Arcadian Legends--Explanation offered.

WHAT is Lycanthropy? The change of manor woman into the form of a wolf,
either through magical means, so as to enable him or her to gratify the
taste for human flesh, or through judgment of the gods in punishment for
some great offence.

This is the popular definition. Truly it consists in a form of madness,
such as may be found in most asylums.

Among the ancients this kind of insanity went by the names of
Lycanthropy, Kuanthropy, or Boanthropy, because those afflicted with it
believed themselves to be turned into wolves, dogs, or cows. But in the
North of Europe, as we shall see, the shape of a bear, and in

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Africa that of a hyæna, were often selected in preference. A mere matter
of taste! According to Marcellus Sidetes, of whose poem περὶ λυκανθρώπου
a fragment exists, men are attacked with this madness chiefly in the
beginning of the year, and become most furious in February; retiring for
the night to lone cemeteries, and living precisely in the manner of dogs
and wolves.

Virgil writes in his eighth Eclogue:--

Has herbas, atque hæc Ponto mihi lecta venena  
Ipse dedit Mœris; nascuntur plurima Ponto.  
His ego sæpe lupum fieri et se conducere sylvis  
Mœrim, sæpe animas imis excire sepulchris,  
Atque satas alio, vidi traducere messes.

And Herodotus:--"It seems that the Neuri are sorcerers, if one is to
believe the Scythians and the Greeks established in Scythia; for each
Neurian changes himself, once in the year, into the form of a wolf, and
he continues in that form for several days, after which he resumes his
former shape."--(Lib. iv. c. 105.)

See also Pomponius Mela (lib. ii. c. 1) "There is a fixed time for each
Neurian, at which they change, if they like, into wolves, and back again
into their former condition."

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

But the most remarkable story among the ancients is that related by Ovid
in his "Metamorphoses," of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, who, entertaining
Jupiter one day, set before him a hash of human flesh, to prove his
omniscience, whereupon the god transferred him into a wolf:--\[1\]

In vain he attempted to speak; from that very instant  
His jaws were bespluttered with foam, and only he thirsted  
For blood, as he raged amongst flocks and panted for slaughter.  
His vesture was changed into hair, his limbs became crooked;  
A wolf,--he retains yet large trace of his ancient expression,  
Hoary he is as afore, his countenance rabid,  
His eyes glitter savagely still, the picture of fury.

Pliny relates from Evanthes, that on the festival of Jupiter Lycæus, one
of the family of Antæus was selected by lot, and conducted to the brink
of the Arcadian lake. He then hung his clothes on a tree and plunged
into the water, whereupon he was transformed into a wolf. Nine years
after, if he had not tasted human flesh, he was at liberty to swim back
and resume his former shape, which had in the meantime become aged, as
though he had worn it for nine years.

Agriopas relates, that Demænetus, having assisted

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. OVID. Met. i. 237; PAUSANIAS, viii. 2, § 1; TZETZE *ad Lycoph.*
481; ERATOSTH. *Catas.* i. 8.\]

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

at an Arcadian human sacrifice to Jupiter Lycæus, ate of the flesh, and
was at once transformed into a wolf, in which shape he prowled about for
ten years, after which he recovered his human form, and took part in the
Olympic games.

The following story is from Petronius:--

"My master had gone to Capua to sell some old clothes. I seized the
opportunity, and persuaded our guest to bear me company about five miles
out of town; for he was a soldier, and as bold as death. We set out
about cockcrow, and the moon shone bright as day, when, coming among
some monuments. my man began to converse with the stars, whilst I jogged
along singing and counting them. Presently I looked back after him, and
saw him strip and lay his clothes by the side of the road. My heart was
in my mouth in an instant, I stood like a corpse; when, in a crack, he
was turned into a wolf. Don't think I'm joking: I would not tell you a
lie for the finest fortune in the world.

"But to continue: after he was turned into a wolf, he set up a howl and
made straight for the woods. At first I did not know whether I was on my
head or my heels; but at last going to take up his clothes, I found them
turned into stone. The sweat streamed

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

from me, and I never expected to get over it. Melissa began to wonder
why I walked so late. 'Had you come a little sooner,' she said, 'you
might at least have lent us a hand; for a wolf broke into the farm and
has butchered all our cattle; but though be got off, it was no laughing
matter for him, for a servant of ours ran him through with a pike.
Hearing this I could not close an eye; but as soon as it was daylight, I
ran home like a pedlar that has been eased of his pack. Coming to the
place where the clothes had been turned into stone, I saw nothing but a
pool of blood; and when I got home, I found my soldier lying in bed,
like an ox in a stall, and a surgeon dressing his neck. I saw at once
that he was a fellow who could change his skin (*versipellis*), and
never after could I eat bread with him, no, not if you would have killed
me. Those who would have taken a different view of the case are welcome
to their opinion; if I tell you a lie, may your genii confound me!"

As every one knows, Jupiter changed himself into a bull; Hecuba became a
bitch; Actæon a stag; the comrades of Ulysses were transformed into
swine; and the daughters of Prœtus fled through the fields believing
themselves to be cows, and would not allow any

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

one to come near them, lest they should be caught and yoked.

S. Augustine declared, in his *De Civitate Dei*, that he knew an old
woman who was said to turn men into asses by her enchantments.

Apuleius has left us his charming romance of the *Golden Ass*, in which
the hero, through injudicious use of a magical salve, is transformed
into that long-eared animal.

It is to be observed that the chief seat of Lycanthropy was Arcadia, and
it has been very plausibly suggested that the cause might he traced to
the following circumstance:--The natives were a pastoral people, and
would consequently suffer very severely from the attacks and
depredations of wolves. They would naturally institute a sacrifice to
obtain deliverance from this pest, and security for their flocks. This
sacrifice consisted in the offering of a child, and it was instituted by
Lycaon. From the circumstance of the sacrifice being human, and from the
peculiarity of the name of its originator, rose the myth.

But, on the other hand, the story is far too widely spread for us to
attribute it to an accidental origin, or to trace it to a local source.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

Half the world believes, or believed in, were-wolves, and they were
supposed to haunt the Norwegian forests by those who had never remotely
been connected with Arcadia: and the superstition had probably struck
deep its roots into the Scandinavian and Teutonic minds, ages before
Lycaon existed; and we have only to glance at Oriental literature, to
see it as firmly engrafted in the imagination of the Easterns.
