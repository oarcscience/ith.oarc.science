Gothic refers to a Romantic literary style which can include
supernatural aspects, particularly vampires. This is because many of
these stories are set in locales with Gothic architecture. This page
includes significant non-fiction and fiction books about vampires and
related subjects.

Why cover this subject at Intangible Textual Heritage? From Lord Byrons'
literary circle to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, vampires and their kin have
evolved into a modern mythology about the presence of
[evil](../evil/index.md) in a world governed by science. Gothic literature
is an outlet for the ancient fears of humanity in an [age of
reason](../aor/index.md). These texts allow us to trace the evolution of
this mythology.

Gothic literature shouldn't be confused with texts *in* the Gothic
language, the earliest written Germanic language, which includes the
Codex Argentius, a translation of parts of the New Testament. For more
information, we recommend [Database of the Gothic
Language](https://www.cs.tut.fi/~dla/gothic.html.md) \[External Site\].

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[The Vampire, his Kith and
Kin](vkk/index.md)</span>, by <span class="c_a">Montague Summers</span>.
\[<span class="c_d">1928</span>\]   <span class="c_b">Summers, a devout
and very literal Catholic, was apparently convinced of the reality of
the undead.</span> This work is a serious, often pedantic, academic
review of the literature. However, it is required reading for any
prospective vampire experts. (An Internet rumor has it that Buffy
Summers got her last name from this author; we welcome any comments on
whether there is any truth to this.) This etext was scanned at
Intangible Textual Heritage. </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[The Book of
Were-Wolves](bow/index.md)</span>, by <span class="c_a">Sabine
Baring-Gould</span>. \[<span class="c_d">1865</span>\]   <span
class="c_b">All killer, some filler.</span> One of the best known
studies of lycanthropy, written by the author of the hymn 'Onward
Christian Soldiers.' The first ten chapters are a pretty good review of
the shape-shifting literature, and then it takes a strange left turn
into the topic of psychopathy. This etext was scanned at Intangible
Textual Heritage. </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Frankenstein](frank/index.md)</span>
by <span class="c_a">Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span> \[<span
class="c_d">1831</span>\]   <span class="c_b">It's alive!</span>
Originaly published in 1818, this modern reworking of the Golem story is
a cautionary tale about science. Frankenstein just keeps getting more
relevant as we stumble forward into the 21st Century of clones, stem
cells and [genomics](../dna/index.md). Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, along
with her husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, was a member of Lord
Byron's circle; her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, wrote one of the key
feminist documents, [Vindication of the Rights Of
Woman](../wmn/vind.txt) (also at this site.md). </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[The
Vampyre](polidori/vampyr.md)</span>, by <span class="c_a">John
Polidori</span> \[<span class="c_d">1819</span>\]   <span
class="c_b">This short proto-gothic novel caused a sensation at the
time, and spawned a vampire craze.</span> Numerous books and plays based
on or imitating its story line. Originally spuriously attributed to Lord
Byron, this was actually written by Dr. John William Polidori, a
physician friend of Lord Byron. The main character of Ruthven is
reputedly based on Byron. For more information, refer to [Chapter V of
The Vampire, his Kith and Kin](vkk/vkk07.md). </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Dracula](drac/index.md)</span> by
<span class="c_a">Bram Stoker</span> \[<span class="c_d">1897</span>\]  
<span class="c_b">Dracula, not Ruthven, is the template for the modern
vampire craze.</span> This novel, in the form of fictional journals and
letters, was not the first or even the best 19th Century vampire tale,
but is today the best known, due to the endless number of movies based
on it. Today we know that Dracula had a medieval counterpart, Vlad the
Impaler, who lived in Wallachia (which is to the south of Transylvania),
today part of Romania. Although not an actual vampire, Vlad was said to
have spilled quite a bit of blood in his day. </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Lair of the White
Worm](lww/index.md)</span> by <span class="c_a">Bram Stoker</span> \[<span
class="c_d">1911</span>\]. <span class="c_b">An erotic thriller of
demonic possession, this time by a giant invertebrate.</span> Lair was
made into a dreadful movie by Ken Russell, which has become something of
a cult classic. *Note that there are racist terms and characterizations
in in this book, so be forewarned*. </span>

<span class="c_e"> <span class="c_t">[Vikram and The
Vampire](vav/index.md)</span>, translated by Sir <span class="c_a">Richard
R. Burton</span>. \[<span class="c_d">1870</span>\]   <span
class="c_b">The Vampire Scheherazade.</span> This collection of Hindu
fables, which has an Arabian Nights-style backstory with a legendary
Indian monarch playing Scheherazade to an undead being, doesn't have
much to do with vampires, but this seemed the best place to put it.
Burton, as it happens, also translated the [Arabian
Nights](../neu/index.htm#arabia.md). Links to other Burton material at
Intangible Textual Heritage (most not suitable for children) can be
found in the [Kama Sutra](../sex/index.htm#kamasutra.md) section. </span>
