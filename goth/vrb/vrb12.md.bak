### Chapter Ten:

### Other Prayers and Invocations

** **

A ritual does not have to be enacted by a group to be powerful or even
legitimate. Many of us are far more comfortable performing our ritual
work alone. While group rituals build community, private rites can be
very intense and potent. Many rites that are performed to work magick
are private rites enacted between only one or two people. The fewer the
number of people involved, the easier it is to get everyone focused
together on the purpose of the rite. When working solo, you don’t have
to content with anyone’s wandering attention. Some resources may be
limited if you are working just by yourself, but in certain cases, the
one-pointed focus that an individual can achieve makes it worth it.

     Solitary rituals, in addition to being more focused are also more
intimate and private. There are some ceremonies that have greater
meaning for us if no one witnesses them save ourselves and whatever
powers we may invoke. The following rites, which read more like prayers
(hence the title of this chapter) are solitary rituals that you can
perform by yourself wherever and whenever you feel they are appropriate.
While many may feel better if they have a specific part of their home
set aside for rituals, or if they perform their private rites at a
personal altar or shrine, there is no strict need for these things. As
we covered at the very beginning of this collection, sacred space,
ideally, is carried within, and therefore you can make any place your
temple or your altar.

 

**Sanguine Ankh Consecration**

* *

     Most vampire houses have a specific ankh that symbolizes the House
and its ideals. For many vampires, whether they belong to a House or
not, their ankh represents their dedication to pursuing their identity
as a vampire, with all that this entails. When a new ankh is obtained,
it should be consecrated before putting it on, so you reflect upon all
that it means to you. If you have an altar, keep the ankh on the altar
overnight. Then, after night has fallen the next day, take up the ankh
and say these words:

 

*This is the symbol of life.  
It is the symbol of my ancient heritage,  
A heritage I now proudly proclaim.*

*Life sustains me and makes me strong:  
Every breath and every sweet drop of blood  
Is a celebration of what I am.*

*Let this ankh be my constant reminder  
As I wear it each night above my heart  
Of the life that is so very precious  
And the darkness that encircles my soul*.

 

Kiss the ankh and place it over your heart. As an alternate Sanguine
rite, you can draw a drop of blood from your finger and consecrate the
ankh with this blood before saying the prayer. It’s a good idea to
reconsecrate your ankh on a yearly basis, to remind yourself of what it
means to wear this symbol.

# Prayer for Strength in the Face of Prejudice

** **

Copy this prayer down and carry it with you.  When you encounter a
person or situation where you are being judged or treated unfairly
because of who and what you are, take out this prayer and recite it to
yourself.  Whenever you feel weak or uncertain, read this prayer out
loud, or reflect upon it silently.  If you are hesitant about your own
worth and your own power, it should give you confidence and strength.

 

*I am true to myself, and still they judge me.  
I follow my heart, yet am condemned as a freak.  
They hate me and they revile me.  
They make no effort to understand.*

*Give me the strength to overcome their smallness.  
Give me the wisdom to rise above.  
Fear is the seed of their hatred.  
I must accept myself regardless of how others feel.*

*I will not let their misunderstanding daunt me.  
I will not let their prejudice keep me from who I am.  
I am stronger than all of their narrow opinions.  
Throughout all hardship, my soul will endure*.

 

What god are you invoking here?  No one but you.  You are praying to the
higher part of you that lies beyond such petty things as appearances and
prejudices.  You are calling upon that immortal part of yourself that
has been judged and tortured and even murdered for who you are and what
you can do.  This part of you has the strength to endure these things. 
This part is where your true wisdom lies.  This prayer helps you connect
with that a little better so you don't feel so weak or alone when faced
with the harsh realities of the world.

**The Kheprian Charge**

 

     Although the rites in this book are not intended to be strictly
Kheprian rites, many of them are based upon the rituals celebrated
within House Kheperu. To this end, most of the rites open with the
Charge. While you are encouraged to write a Charge or Opening Prayer
that encapsulates the spirit and beliefs of your own group, I have
included the Kheprian Charge here as a reference and for use, should you
wish to incorporate it into your own rituals:

 

*We are the many-born. We are the Immortal.  
Eternal we wander the aeons,  
Moving to the rhythm of our own inner tides.  
We are active elements moving through passive worlds*

*Endlessly we die and are reborn,  
Changed yet unchanging through the years.  
We move from lifetime to lifetime,  
Taking up bodies as garments.*

*Ours is a journey toward understanding,  
And our charge is knowledge and wisdom.  
We are the catalysts, and as we Awaken to ourselves,  
We serve to Awaken the very world*.

**The Family Prayer**

** **

In House Kheperu, the Family Prayer has several functions. It can be
recited alone as an affirmation of Family, and it can be recited
together as a group as a mini-gathering rite. Finally, we often close
rituals with the Family Prayer as a reminder of where we have come from,
who we are, and how we hope to relate in the future. Several rites
within this book have been concluded with a modified version of this
prayer. Below is the full version. Feel free to use this to conclude all
rituals, just as you use the Charge to open them:

 

*We have passed this way before  
And we will pass this way again.  
We have been many things to one another throughout the years:  
Brothers, Lovers, Friends, and Bitterest Enemies.  
But through it all, we have remained,  
Tied together, soul to soul,  
In this our Ancient Family.  
May we endure together peacefully.  
May we enjoy each new lifetime as it comes,  
May we strengthen each other as we strengthen ourselves,  
And may we always find one another  
In very time and in every place  
To share in this companionship  
And to celebrate this bond*.
