# CHAPTER XL.

## How Gudrun cast herself into the Sea, but was brought ashore again.

Gudrun had a daughter by Sigurd hight Swanhild; she was the fairest of
all women, eager-eyed as her father, so that few durst look under the
brows of her; and as far did she excel other woman-kind as the sun
excels the other lights of heaven.

But on a day went Gudrun down to the sea, and caught up stones in her
arms, and went out into the sea, for she had will to end her life. But
mighty billows drave her forth along the sea, and by means of their
upholding was she borne along till she came at the last to the burg of
King Jonakr, a mighty king, and lord of many folk. And he took Gudrun to
wife, and their children were Hamdir, and Sorli, and Erp; and there was
Swanhild nourished withal.
