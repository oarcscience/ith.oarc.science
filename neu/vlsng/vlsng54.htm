<DIR>

<P>Great deeds of bale<BR>
In the garth began,<BR>
At the sad dawning<BR>
The tide of Elves' sorrow<BR>
When day is a-waxing<BR>
And man's grief awaketh,<BR>
And the sorrow of each one<BR>
The early day quickeneth.<BR>
Not now, not now,<BR>
Nor yesterday,<BR>
But long ago<BR>
Has that day worn by,<BR>
That ancientest time,<BR>
The first time to tell of,<BR>
Then, whenas Gudrun,<BR>
Born of Giuki,<BR>
Whetter her sons<BR>
To Swanhild's avenging.<BR>
"Your sister's name<BR>
Was naught but Swanhild,<BR>
Whom Jormunrek<BR>
With horses has trodden!--<BR>
White horses and black<BR>
On the war-beaten way,<BR>
Grey horses that go<BR>
On the roads of the Goths.<BR>
"All alone am I now<BR>
As in holt is the aspen;<BR>
As the fir-tree of boughs,<BR>
So of kin am I bare;<BR>
As bare of things longed for<BR>
As the willow of leaves<BR>
When the bough-breaking wind<BR>
The warm day endeth.<BR>
"Few, sad, are ye left<BR>
O kings of my folk!<BR>
Yet alone living<BR>
Last shreds of my kin!<BR>
"Ah, naught are ye grown<BR>
As that Gunnar of old days;<BR>
Naught are your hearts<BR>
As the heart of Hogni!<BR>
Well would ye seek<BR>
Vengeance to win<BR>
If your hearts were in aught<BR>
As the hearts of my brethren!"<BR>
Then spake Hamdir The high-hearted:<BR>
"Nought hadst thou to praise<BR>
The doings of Hogni,<BR>
When they woke up Sigurd<BR>
From out of slumber,<BR>
And in bed thou sat'st up<BR>
'Mid the banes-men's laughter.<BR>
"Then when thy bed-gear,<BR>
Blue-white, well woven<BR>
By art of craftsmen<BR>
All swam with thy king's blood;<BR>
The Sigurd died,<BR>
O'er his dead corpse thou sattest,<BR>
Not heeding aught gladsome,<BR>
Since Gunnar so willed it.<BR>
"Great grief for Atli<BR>
Gatst thou by Erp's murder,<BR>
And the end of thine Eitil,<BR>
But worse grief for thyself.<BR>
Good to use sword<BR>
For the slaying of others<BR>
In such wise that its edge<BR>
Shall not turn on ourselves!"<BR>
Then well spake Sorli<BR>
From a heart full of wisdom:<BR>
"No words will I<BR>
Make with my mother,<BR>
Though both ye twain<BR>
Need words belike--<BR>
What askest thou, Gudrun,<BR>
To let thee go greeting?<BR>
"Weep for thy brethren,<BR>
Weep for thy sweet sons,<BR>
And thy nighest kinsfolk<BR>
Laid by the fight-side!<BR>
Yea, and thou Gudrun,<BR>
May'st greet for us twain<BR>
Sitting fey on our steeds<BR>
Doomed in far lands to die."<BR>
From the garth forth they went<BR>
With hearts full of fury,<BR>
Sorli and Hamdir,<BR>
The sons of Gudrun,<BR>
And they met on the way<BR>
The wise in all wiles:<BR>
"And thou little Erp,<BR>
What helping from thee?"<BR>
He of alien womb<BR>
Spake out in such wise:<BR>
"Good help for my kin,<BR>
Such as foot gives to foot,<BR>
Or flesh-covered hand<BR>
Gives unto hand!"<BR>
"What helping for foot<BR>
That help that foot giveth,<BR>
Or for flesh-covered hand<BR>
The helping of hand?"<BR>
Then spake Erp<BR>
Yet once again<BR>
Mock spake the prince<BR>
As he sat on his steed:<BR>
"Fool's deed to show<BR>
The way to a dastard!"<BR>
"Bold beyond measure,"<BR>
Quoth they, "is the base-born!"<BR>
Out from the sheath<BR>
Drew they the sheath-steel,<BR>
And the glaives' edges played<BR>
For the pleasure of hell;<BR>
By the third part they minished<BR>
The might that they had,<BR>
Their young kin they let lie<BR>
A-cold on the earth.<BR>
Then their fur-cloaks they shook<BR>
And bound fast their swords,<BR>
In webs goodly woven<BR>
Those great ones were clad;<BR>
Young they went o'er the fells<BR>
Where the dew was new-fallen<BR>
Swift, on steeds of the Huns,<BR>
Heavy vengeance to wreak.<BR>
Forth stretched the ways,<BR>
And an ill way they found,<BR>
Yea, their sister's son [1]<BR>
Hanging slain upon tree--<BR>
Wolf-trees by the wind made cold<BR>
At the town's westward<BR>
Loud with cranes' clatter--<BR>
Ill abiding there long!<BR>
Din in the king's hall<BR>
Of men merry with drink,<BR>
And none might hearken<BR>
The horses' tramping<BR>
Or ever the warders<BR>
Their great horn winded.<BR>
Then men went forth<BR>
To Jormunrek<BR>
To tell of the heeding<BR>
Of men under helm:<BR>
"Give ye good counsel!<BR>
Great ones are come hither,<BR>
For the wrong of men mighty<BR>
Was the may to death trodden."<BR>
"Loud Jormunrek laughed,<BR>
And laid hand to his beard,<BR>
Nor bade bring his byrny,<BR>
But with the wine fighting,<BR>
Shook his red locks,<BR>
On his white shield sat staring,<BR>
And in his hand<BR>
Swung the gold cup on high.<BR>
"Sweet sight for me<BR>
Those twain to set eyes on,<BR>
Sorli and Hamdir,<BR>
Here in my hall!<BR>
Then with bowstrings<BR>
Would I bind them,<BR>
And hang the good Giukings<BR>
Aloft on the gallows!"</P>
<P>Then spake Hrothglod<BR>
From off the high steps,<BR>
Spake the slim-fingered<BR>
Unto her son,--<BR>
For a threat was cast forth<BR>
Of what ne'er should fall--<BR>
"Shall two men alone<BR>
Two hundred Gothfolk<BR>
Bind or bear down<BR>
In the midst of their burg?"</P>
<P>Strife and din in the hall,<BR>
Cups smitten asunder<BR>
Men lay low in blood<BR>
From the breasts of Goths flowing.<BR>
Then spake Hamdir,<BR>
The high-hearted:<BR>
"Thou cravedst, O king,<BR>
From the coming of us,<BR>
The sons of one mother,<BR>
Amidmost thine hall--<BR>
Look on these hands of thine,<BR>
Look on these feet of thine,<BR>
Cast by us, Jormunrek,<BR>
On to the flame!"<BR>
Then cried aloud<BR>
The high Gods' kinsman [2]<BR>
Bold under byrny,--<BR>
Roared he as bears roar;<BR>
"Stones to the stout ones<BR>
That the spears bite not,<BR>
Nor the edges of steel,<BR>
These sons of Jonakr!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>QUOTH SORLI:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Bale, brother, wroughtst thou<BR>
By that bag's [3] opening,<BR>
Oft from that bag<BR>
Rede of bale cometh!<BR>
Heart hast thou, Hamdir,<BR>
If thou hadst heart's wisdom<BR>
Great lack in a man<BR>
Who lacks wisdom and lore!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HAMDIR SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Yes, off were the head<BR>
If Erp were alive yet,<BR>
Our brother the bold<BR>
Whom we slew by the way;<BR>
The far-famed through the world--<BR>
Ah, the fares drave me on,<BR>
And the man war made holy,<BR>
There must I slay!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>SORLI SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Unmeet we should do<BR>
As the doings of wolves are,<BR>
Raising wrong each 'gainst other<BR>
As the dogs of the Norns,<BR>
The greedy ones nourished<BR>
In waste steads of the world.<BR>
In strong wise have we fought,<BR>
On Goths' corpses we stand,<BR>
Beat down by our edges,<BR>
E'en as ernes on the bough.<BR>
Great fame our might winneth,<BR>
Die we now, or to-morrow,--<BR>
No man lives till eve<BR>
Whom the fates doom at morning."<BR>
At the hall's gable-end<BR>
Fell Sorli to earth,<BR>
But Hamdir lay low<BR>
At the back of the houses.</P></DIR>
