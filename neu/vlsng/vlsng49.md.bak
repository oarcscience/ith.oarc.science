# THE HELL-RIDE OF BRYNHILD.

After the death of Brynhild were made two bales, one for Sigurd, and
that was first burned; but Brynhild was burned on the other, and she was
in a chariot hung about with goodly hangings.

And so folk say that Brynhild drave in her chariot down along the way to
Hell, and passed by an abode where dwelt a certain giantess, and the
giantess spake:--

THE GIANT-WOMAN:

"Nay, with my goodwill  
Never goest thou  
Through this stone-pillared  
Stead of mine!  
More seemly for thee  
To sit sewing the cloth,  
Than to go look on  
The love of another.  
"What dost thou, going  
From the land of the Gauls,  
O restless head,  
To this mine house?  
Golden girl, hast thou not,  
If thou listest to hearken,  
In sweet wise from thy hands  
The blood of men washen?"

BRYNHILD:

"Nay, blame me naught,  
Bride of the rock-hall,  
Though I roved a warring  
In the days that were;  
The higher of us twain  
Shall I ever be holden  
When of our kind  
Men make account."

THE GIANT-WOMAN

"Thou, O Brynhild,  
Budli's daughter,  
Wert the worst ever born  
Into the world;  
For Giuki's children  
Death hast thou gotten,  
And turned to destruction  
Their goodly dwelling."

BRYNHILD:

"I shall tell thee  
True tale from my chariot,  
O thou who naught wottest,  
If thou listest to wot;  
How for me they have gotten  
Those heirs of Giuki,  
A loveless life,  
A life of lies.  
"Hild under helm,  
The Hlymdale people,  
E'en those who knew me,  
Ever would call me.  
"The changeful shapes  
Of us eight sisters,  
The wise king bade  
Under oak-tree to bear;  
Of twelve winters was I,  
If thou listest to wot,  
When I sware to the young lord  
Oaths of love.  
"Thereafter gat I  
Mid the folk of the Goths,  
For Helmgunnar the old,  
Swift journey to Hell,  
And gave to Aud's brother  
The young, gain and glory;  
Whereof overwrath  
Waxed Odin with me.  
"So he shut me in shield-wall  
In Skata grove,  
Red shields and white  
Close set around me;  
And bade him alone  
My slumber to break  
Who in no land  
Knew how to fear.  
"He set round my hall,  
Toward the south quarter,  
The Bane of all trees  
Burning aloft;  
And ruled that he only  
Thereover should ride  
Who should bring me the gold  
O'er which Fafnir brooded.  
"Then upon Grani rode  
The goodly gold-strewer  
To where my fosterer  
Ruled his fair dwelling.  
He who alone there  
Was deemed best of all,  
The War-lord of the Danes,  
Well worthy of men.  
"In peace did we sleep  
Soft in one bed,  
As though he had been  
Naught but my brother:  
There as we lay  
Through eight nights wearing,  
No hand in love  
On each other we laid.  
"Yet thence blamed me, Gudrun,  
Giuki's daughter,  
That I had slept  
In the arms of Sigurd;  
And then I wotted  
As I fain had not wotted,  
That they had bewrayed me  
In my betrothals.  
"Ah! For unrest  
All too long  
Are men and women  
Made alive!  
Yet we twain together  
Shall wear through the ages,  
Sigurd and I.--  
Sink adown, O giant-wife!"
