<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Of the Lamentation of Gudrun over Sigurd's dead, as it is told told in ancient Songs. [1]</H2><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Gudrun of old days<BR>
Drew near to dying<BR>
As she sat in sorrow<BR>
Over Sigurd;<BR>
Yet she sighed not<BR>
Nor smote hand on hand,<BR>
Nor wailed she aught<BR>
As other women.<BR>
Then went earls to her.<BR>
Full of all wisdom,<BR>
Fain help to deal<BR>
To her dreadful heart:<BR>
Hushed was Gudrun<BR>
Of wail, or greeting,<BR>
But with a heavy woe<BR>
Was her heart a-breaking.<BR>
Bright and fair<BR>
Sat the great earls' brides,<BR>
Gold arrayed<BR>
Before Gudrun;<BR>
Each told the tale<BR>
Of her great trouble,<BR>
The bitterest bale<BR>
She erst abode.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Giaflaug, Giuki's sister:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Lo upon earth<BR>
I live most loveless<BR>
Who of five mates<BR>
Must see the ending,<BR>
Of daughters twain<BR>
And three sisters,<BR>
Of brethren eight,<BR>
And abide behind lonely."<BR>
Naught gat Gudrun<BR>
Of wail and greeting,<BR>
So heavy was she<BR>
For her dead husband,<BR>
So dreadful-hearted<BR>
For the King laid dead there.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Herborg</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Queen of Hunland--<BR>
"Crueller tale<BR>
Have I to tell of,<BR>
Of my seven sons<BR>
Down in the Southlands,<BR>
And the eighth man, my mate,<BR>
Felled in the death-mead.<BR>
"Father and mother,<BR>
And four brothers,<BR>
On the wide sea<BR>
The winds and death played with;<BR>
The billows beat<BR>
On the bulwark boards.<BR>
"Alone must I sing o'er them,<BR>
Alone must I array them,<BR>
Alone must my hands deal with<BR>
Their departing;<BR>
And all this was<BR>
In one season's wearing,<BR>
And none was left<BR>
For love or solace.<BR>
"Then was I bound<BR>
A prey of the battle,<BR>
When that same season<BR>
Wore to its ending;<BR>
As a tiring may<BR>
Must I bind the shoon<BR>
Of the duke's high dame,<BR>
Every day at dawning.<BR>
"From her jealous hate<BR>
Gat I heavy mocking,<BR>
Cruel lashes<BR>
She laid upon me,<BR>
Never met I<BR>
Better master<BR>
Or mistress worser<BR>
In all the wide world."<BR>
Naught gat Gudrun<BR>
Of wail or greeting,<BR>
So heavy was she<BR>
For her dead husband,<BR>
So dreadful-hearted<BR>
For the King laid dead there.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Gullrond,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Giuki's daughter--<BR>
"O foster-mother,<BR>
Wise as thou mayst be,<BR>
Naught canst thou better<BR>
The young wife's bale."<BR>
And she bade uncover<BR>
The dead King's corpse.<BR>
She swept the sheet<BR>
Away from Sigurd,<BR>
And turned his cheek<BR>
Towards his wife's knees--<BR>
"Look on thy loved one<BR>
Lay lips to his lips,<BR>
E'en as thou wert clinging<BR>
To thy king alive yet!"<BR>
Once looked Gudrun--<BR>
One look only,<BR>
And saw her lord's locks<BR>
Lying all bloody,<BR>
The great man's eyes<BR>
Glazed and deadly,<BR>
And his heart's bulwark<BR>
Broken by sword-edge.<BR>
Back then sank Gudrun,<BR>
Back on the bolster,<BR>
Loosed was her head array,<BR>
Red did her cheeks grow,<BR>
And the rain-drops ran<BR>
Down over her knees.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then wept Gudrun,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Giuki's daughter,<BR>
So that the tears flowed<BR>
Through the pillow;<BR>
As the geese withal<BR>
That were in the homefield,<BR>
The fair fowls the may owned,<BR>
Fell a-screaming.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Gullrond,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Giuki's daughter--<BR>
"Surely knew I<BR>
No love like your love<BR>
Among all men,<BR>
On the mould abiding;<BR>
Naught wouldst thou joy in<BR>
Without or within doors,<BR>
O my sister,<BR>
Save beside Sigurd."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Gudrun,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Giuki's daughter--<BR>
"Such was my Sigurd<BR>
Among the sons of Giuki,<BR>
As is the king leek<BR>
O'er the low grass waxing,<BR>
Or a bright stone<BR>
Strung on band,<BR>
Or a pearl of price<BR>
On a prince's brow.<BR>
"Once was I counted<BR>
By the king's warriors<BR>
Higher than any<BR>
Of Herjan's mays;<BR>
Now am I as little<BR>
As the leaf may be,<BR>
Amid wind-swept wood<BR>
Now when dead he lieth.<BR>
I miss from my seat,<BR>
I miss from my bed,<BR>
My darling of sweet speech.<BR>
Wrought the sons of Giuki,<BR>
Wrought the sons of Giuki,<BR>
This sore sorrow,<BR>
Yea, for their sister,<BR>
Most sore sorrow.<BR>
"So may your lands<BR>
Lie waste on all sides,<BR>
As ye have broken<BR>
Your bounden oaths!<BR>
Ne'er shalt thou, Gunnar,<BR>
The gold have joy of;<BR>
The dear-bought rings<BR>
Shall drag thee to death,<BR>
Whereon thou swarest<BR>
Oath unto Sigurd.<BR>
Ah, in the days by-gone<BR>
Great mirth in the homefield<BR>
When my Sigurd<BR>
Set saddle on Grani,<BR>
And they went their ways<BR>
For the wooing of Brynhild!<BR>
An ill day, an ill woman,<BR>
And most ill hap!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Brynhild,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Budli's daughter--<BR>
"May the woman lack<BR>
Both love and children,<BR>
Who gained greeting<BR>
For thee, O Gudrun!<BR>
Who gave thee this morning<BR>
Many words!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Gullrond,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Giuki's daughter--<BR>
"Hold peace of such words<BR>
Thou hated of all folk!<BR>
The bane of brave men<BR>
Hast thou been ever,<BR>
All waves of ill<BR>
Wash over thy mind,<BR>
To seven great kings<BR>
Hast thou been a sore sorrow,<BR>
And the death of good will<BR>
To wives and women."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then spake Brynhild,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Budli's daughter--<BR>
"None but Atli<BR>
Brought bale upon us,<BR>
My very brother<BR>
Born of Budli.<BR>
When we saw in the hall<BR>
Of the Hunnish people<BR>
The gold a-gleaming<BR>
On the kingly Giukings;<BR>
I have paid for that faring<BR>
Oft and Full,<BR>
And for the sight<BR>
That then I saw."<BR>
By a pillar she stood<BR>
And strained its wood to her;<BR>
From the eyes of Brynhild,<BR>
Budli's daughter,<BR>
Flashed out fire,<BR>
And she snorted forth venom,<BR>
As the sore wounds she gazed on<BR>
Of the dead-slain Sigurd.</P></DIR>
