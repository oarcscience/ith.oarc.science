# CHAPTER XX.

## Of Sigurd's Meeting with Brynhild on the Mountain.

By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell,
and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before
him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even
unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield hung castle
before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went
Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he
takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but
a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it
had gown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then
the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth.
Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked--

"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny,
and draw me from my sleep?"

Even as sings the song \[1\]

"What bit on the byrny,  
Why breaks my sleep away,  
Who has turned from me  
My wan tormenting?"

"Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir's
helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?"

Then answered Sigurd--

"Sigmund's son  
With Sigurd's sword  
E'en now rent down  
The raven's wall."

"Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard
that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou
wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same."

Then Brynhild sang--

"Long have I slept  
And slumbered long,  
Many and long are the woes of mankind,  
By the might of Odin  
Must I bide helpless  
To shake from off me the spells of slumber.  
"Hail to the day come back!  
Hail, sons of the daylight!  
Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!  
Look with kind eyes a-down,  
On us sitting here lonely,  
And give unto us the gain that we long for.  
"Hail to the Aesir,  
And the sweet Asyniur! \[2\]  
Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!  
Fair words, wise hearts,  
Would we win from you,  
And healing hands while life we hold."

Then Brynhild speaks again and says, "Two kings fought, one hight Helm
Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised
the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi's brother, and so I
smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that
deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never again
have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but there
against I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the name of
fear."

Then said Sigurd, "Teach us the lore of mighty matters!"

She said, "Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I
teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that
will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that
are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods
give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame from
my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we
twain speak together."

Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the
drink of love, and spake--

"Beer bring I to thee,  
Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,  
Mixed is it mightily,  
Mingled with fame,  
Brimming with bright lays  
And pitiful runes,  
Wise words, sweet words,  
Speech of great game.  
"Runes of war know thou,  
If great thou wilt be!  
Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,  
Some on the brand's back,  
Some on its shining side,  
Twice name Tyr therein.  
"Sea-runes good at need,  
Learnt for ship's saving,  
For the good health of the swimming horse;  
On the stern cut them,  
Cut them on the rudder-blade  
And set flame to shaven oar:  
Howso big be the sea-hills,  
Howso blue beneath,  
Hail from the main then comest thou home.  
"Word-runes learn well  
If thou wilt that no man  
Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;  
Wind thou these,  
Weave thou these,  
Cast thou these all about thee,  
At the Thing,  
Where folk throng,  
Unto the full doom faring.  
"Of ale-runes know the wisdom  
If thou wilt that another's wife  
Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:  
Cut them on the mead-horn,  
On the back of each hand,  
And nick an N upon thy nail.  
"Ale have thou heed  
To sign from all harm  
Leek lay thou in the liquor,  
Then I know for sure  
Never cometh to thee,  
Mead with hurtful matters mingled.  
"Help-runes shalt thou gather  
If skill thou wouldst gain  
To loosen child from low-laid mother;  
Cut be they in hands hollow,  
Wrapped the joints round about;  
Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping.  
"Learn the bough-runes wisdom  
If leech-lore thou lovest;  
And wilt wot about wounds' searching  
On the bark be they scored;  
On the buds of trees  
Whose boughs look eastward ever.  
"Thought-runes shalt thou deal with  
If thou wilt be of all men  
Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,  
These areded  
These first cut  
These first took to heart high Hropt.  
"On the shield were they scored  
That stands before the shining God,  
On Early-waking's ear,  
On All-knowing's hoof,  
On the wheel which runneth  
Under Rognir's chariot;  
On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,  
On the sleigh's traces.  
"On the rough bear's paws,  
And on Bragi's tongue,  
On the wolfs claws,  
And on eagle's bill,  
On bloody wings,  
And bridge's end;  
On loosing palms,  
And pity's path:  
"On glass, and on gold,  
And on goodly silver,  
In wine and in wort,  
And the seat of the witch-wife;  
On Gungnir's point,  
And Grani's bosom;  
On the Norn's nail,  
And the neb of the night-owl.  
"All these so cut,  
Were shaven and sheared,  
And mingled in with holy mead,  
And sent upon wide ways enow;  
Some abide with the Elves,  
Some abide with the Aesir,  
Or with the wise Vanir,  
Some still hold the sons of mankind.  
"These be the book-runes,  
And the runes of good help,  
And all the ale-runes,  
And the runes of much might;  
To whomso they may avail,  
Unbewildered unspoilt;  
They are wholesome to have:  
Thrive thou with these then.  
When thou hast learnt their lore,  
Till the Gods end thy life-days.  
"Now shalt thou choose thee  
E'en as choice is bidden,  
Sharp steel's root and stem,  
Choose song or silence;  
See to each in thy heart,  
All hurt has been heeded."  
Then answered Sigurd--  
"Ne'er shall I flee,  
Though thou wottest me fey;  
Never was I born for blenching,  
Thy loved rede will I  
Hold aright in my heart Even as long as I may live."
