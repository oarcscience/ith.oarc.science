<DIR>

<P>Sigurd of yore,<BR>
Sought the dwelling of Giuki,<BR>
As he fared, the young Volsung,<BR>
After fight won;<BR>
Troth he took<BR>
From the two brethren;<BR>
Oath swore they betwixt them,<BR>
Those bold ones of deed.<BR>
A may they gave to him<BR>
And wealth manifold,<BR>
Gudrun the young,<BR>
Giuki's daughter:<BR>
They drank and gave doom<BR>
Many days together,<BR>
Sigurd the young,<BR>
And the sons of Giuki.<BR>
Until they wended<BR>
For Brynhild's wooing,<BR>
Sigurd a-riding<BR>
Amidst their rout;<BR>
The wise young Volsung<BR>
Who knew of all ways--<BR>
Ah! He had wed her,<BR>
Had fate so willed it.<BR>
Southlander Sigurd<BR>
A naked sword,<BR>
Bright, well grinded,<BR>
Laid betwixt them;<BR>
No kiss he won<BR>
From the fair woman,<BR>
Nor in arms of his<BR>
Did the Hun King hold her,<BR>
Since he gat the young maid<BR>
For the son of Giuki.<BR>
No lack in her life<BR>
She wotted of now,<BR>
And at her death-day<BR>
No dreadful thing<BR>
For a shame indeed<BR>
Or a shame in seeming;<BR>
But about and betwixt<BR>
Went baleful fate.<BR>
Alone, abroad,<BR>
She sat of an evening,<BR>
Of full many things<BR>
She fall a-talking:<BR>
"O for my Sigurd!<BR>
I shall have death,<BR>
Or my fair, my lovely,<BR>
Laid in mine arms.<BR>
"For the word once spoken,<BR>
I sorrow sorely--<BR>
His queen is Gudrun,<BR>
I am wed to Gunnar;<BR>
The dread Norns wrought for us<BR>
A long while of woe."<BR>
Oft with heart deep<BR>
In dreadful thoughts,<BR>
O'er ice-fields and ice-hills<BR>
She fared a-night time,<BR>
When he and Gudrun<BR>
Were gone to their fair bed,<BR>
And Sigurd wrapped<BR>
The bed-gear round her.<BR>
"Ah! Now the Hun King<BR>
His queen in arms holdeth,<BR>
While love I go lacking,<BR>
And all things longed for<BR>
With no delight<BR>
But in dreadful thought."<BR>
These dreadful things Thrust her toward murder:<BR>
"Listen, Gunnar,<BR>
For thou shalt lose<BR>
My wide lands,<BR>
Yea, me myself!<BR>
Never love I my life,<BR>
With thee for my lord--<BR>
"I will fare back thither<BR>
From whence I came,<BR>
To my nighest kin<BR>
And those that know me<BR>
There shall I sit<BR>
Sleeping my life away,<BR>
Unless thou slayest<BR>
Sigurd the Hun King,<BR>
Making thy might more<BR>
E'en than his might was!<BR>
"Yea, let the son fare<BR>
After the father,<BR>
And no young wolf<BR>
A long while nourish!<BR>
For on earth man lieth<BR>
Vengeance lighter,<BR>
And peace shall be surer<BR>
If the son live not."<BR>
Adrad was Gunnar,<BR>
Heavy-hearted was he,<BR>
And in doubtful mood<BR>
Day-long he sat.<BR>
For naught he wotted,<BR>
Nor might see clearly<BR>
What was the seemliest<BR>
Of deeds to set hand to;<BR>
What of all deeds<BR>
Was best to be done:<BR>
For he minded the vows<BR>
Sworn to the Volsung,<BR>
And the sore wrong<BR>
To be wrought against Sigurd.<BR>
Wavered his mind<BR>
A weary while,<BR>
No wont it was<BR>
Of those days worn by,<BR>
That queens should flee<BR>
From the realms of their kings.<BR>
"Brynhild to me<BR>
Is better than all,<BR>
The child of Budli<BR>
Is the best of women.<BR>
Yea, and my life<BR>
Will I lay down,<BR>
Ere I am twinned<BR>
From that woman's treasure."<BR>
He bade call Hogni<BR>
To the place where he bided;<BR>
With all the trust that might be,<BR>
Trowed he in him.<BR>
"Wilt thou bewray Sigurd<BR>
For his wealth's sake?<BR>
Good it is to rule<BR>
O'er the Rhine's metal;<BR>
And well content<BR>
Great wealth to wield,<BR>
Biding in peace<BR>
And blissful days."<BR>
One thing alone Hogni Had for an answer:<BR>
"Such doings for us<BR>
Are naught seemly to do;<BR>
To rend with sword<BR>
Oaths once sworn,<BR>
Oaths once sworn,<BR>
And troth once plighted.<BR>
"Nor know we on mould,<BR>
Men of happier days,<BR>
The while we four<BR>
Rule over the folk;<BR>
While the bold in battle,<BR>
The Hun King, bides living.<BR>
"And no nobler kin<BR>
Shall be known afield,<BR>
If our five sons<BR>
We long may foster;<BR>
Yea, a goodly stem<BR>
Shall surely wax.<BR>
But I clearly see<BR>
In what wise it standeth,<BR>
Brynhild's sore urging<BR>
O'ermuch on thee beareth.<BR>
"Guttorm shall we<BR>
Get for the slaying,<BR>
Our younger brother<BR>
Bare of wisdom;<BR>
For he was out of<BR>
All the oaths sworn,<BR>
All the oaths sworn,<BR>
And the plighted troth."<BR>
Easy to rouse him<BR>
Who of naught recketh!<BR>
Deep stood the sword<BR>
In the heart of Sigurd.<BR>
There, in the hall,<BR>
Gat the high-hearted vengeance;<BR>
For he can his sword<BR>
At the reckless slayer:<BR>
Out at Guttorm<BR>
Flew Gram the mighty,<BR>
The gleaming steel<BR>
From Sigurd's hand.<BR>
Down fell the slayer<BR>
Smitten asunder;<BR>
The heavy head<BR>
And the hands fell one way,<BR>
But the feet and such like<BR>
Aback where they stood.<BR>
Gudrun was sleeping<BR>
Soft in the bed,<BR>
Empty of sorrow<BR>
By the side of Sigurd:<BR>
When she awoke<BR>
With all pleasure gone,<BR>
Swimming in blood<BR>
Of Frey's beloved.<BR>
So sore her hands<BR>
She smote together,<BR>
That the great-hearted<BR>
Gat raised in bed;<BR>
"O Gudrun, weep not<BR>
So woefully,<BR>
Sweet lovely bride,<BR>
For thy brethren live for thee!<BR>
"A young child have I<BR>
For heritor;<BR>
Too young to win forth<BR>
From the house of his foes.--<BR>
Black deeds and ill<BR>
Have they been a-doing,<BR>
Evil rede<BR>
Have they wrought at last.<BR>
"Late, late, rideth with them<BR>
Unto the Thing,<BR>
Such sister's son,<BR>
Though seven thou bear,--<BR>
But well I wot<BR>
Which way all goeth;<BR>
Alone wrought Brynhild<BR>
This bale against us.<BR>
"That maiden loved me<BR>
Far before all men,<BR>
Yet wrong to Gunnar<BR>
I never wrought;<BR>
Brotherhood I heeded<BR>
And all bounden oaths,<BR>
That none should deem me<BR>
His queen's darling."<BR>
Weary sighed Gudrun,<BR>
As the king gat ending,<BR>
And so sore her hands<BR>
She smote together,<BR>
That the cups arow<BR>
Rang out therewith,<BR>
And the geese cried on high<BR>
That were in the homefield.<BR>
Then laughed Brynhild<BR>
Budli's daughter,<BR>
Once, once only,<BR>
From out her heart;<BR>
When to her bed<BR>
Was borne the sound<BR>
Of the sore greeting<BR>
Of Giuki's daughter.<BR>
Then, quoth Gunnar,<BR>
The king, the hawk-bearer,<BR>
"Whereas, thou laughest,<BR>
O hateful woman,<BR>
Glad on thy bed,<BR>
No good it betokeneth:<BR>
Why lackest thou else<BR>
Thy lovely hue?<BR>
Feeder of foul deeds,<BR>
Fey do I deem thee,<BR>
"Well worthy art thou<BR>
Before all women,<BR>
That thine eyes should see<BR>
Atli slain of us;<BR>
That thy brother's wounds<BR>
Thou shouldest see a-bleeding,<BR>
That his bloody hurts<BR>
Thine hands should bind."<BR>
"No man blameth thee, Gunnar,<BR>
Thou hast fulfilled death's measure<BR>
But naught Atli feareth<BR>
All thine ill will;<BR>
Life shall he lay down<BR>
Later than ye,<BR>
And still bear more might<BR>
Aloft than thy might.<BR>
"I shall tell thee, Gunnar,<BR>
Though well the tale thou knowest,<BR>
In what early days<BR>
Ye dealt abroad your wrong:<BR>
Young was I then,<BR>
Worn with no woe,<BR>
Good wealth I had<BR>
In the house of my brother!<BR>
"No mind had I<BR>
That a man should have me,<BR>
Or ever ye Giukings,<BR>
Rode into our garth;<BR>
There ye sat on your steeds<BR>
Three kings of the people--<BR>
Ah! That that faring<BR>
Had never befallen!<BR>
"Then spake Atli<BR>
To me apart,<BR>
And said that no wealth<BR>
He would give unto me,<BR>
Neither gold nor lands<BR>
If I would not be wedded;<BR>
Nay, and no part<BR>
Of the wealth apportioned,<BR>
Which in my first days<BR>
He gave me duly;<BR>
Which in my first days<BR>
He counted down.<BR>
"Wavered the mind<BR>
Within me then,<BR>
If to fight I should fall<BR>
And the felling of folk,<BR>
Bold in Byrny<BR>
Because of my brother;<BR>
A deed of fame<BR>
Had that been to all folk,<BR>
But to many a man<BR>
Sorrow of mind.<BR>
"So I let all sink<BR>
Into peace at the last:<BR>
More grew I minded<BR>
For the mighty treasure,<BR>
The red-shining rings<BR>
Of Sigmund's son;<BR>
For no man's wealth else<BR>
Would I take unto me.<BR>
"For myself had I given<BR>
To that great king<BR>
Who sat amid gold<BR>
On the back of Grani;<BR>
Nought were his eyes<BR>
Like to your eyen,<BR>
Nor in any wise<BR>
Went his visage with yours;<BR>
Though ye might deem you<BR>
Due kings of men.<BR>
"One I loved,<BR>
One, and none other,<BR>
The gold-decked may<BR>
Had no doubtful mind;<BR>
Thereof shall Atli<BR>
Wot full surely,<BR>
When he getteth to know<BR>
I am gone to the dead.<BR>
"Far be it from me,<BR>
Feeble and wavering,<BR>
Ever to love<BR>
Another's love--<BR>
Yes shall my woe<BR>
Be well avenged."<BR>
Up rose Gunnar,<BR>
The great men's leader,<BR>
And cast his arms<BR>
About the queen's neck;<BR>
And all went nigh<BR>
One after other,<BR>
With their whole hearts<BR>
Her heart to turn.<BR>
But then all these<BR>
From her neck she thrust,<BR>
Of her long journey<BR>
No man should let her.<BR>
Then called he Hogni<BR>
To have talk with him;<BR>
"Let all folk go<BR>
Forth into the hall,<BR>
Thine with mine--<BR>
O need sore and mighty!--<BR>
To wot if we yet<BR>
My wife's parting may stay.<BR>
Till with time's wearing<BR>
Some hindrance wax."<BR>
One answer Hogni<BR>
Had for all;<BR>
"Nay, let hard need<BR>
Have rule thereover,<BR>
And no man let her<BR>
Of her long journey!<BR>
Never born again,<BR>
May she come back thence!<BR>
"Luckless she came<BR>
To the lap of her mother,<BR>
Born into the world<BR>
For utter woe,<BR>
TO many a man<BR>
For heart-whole mourning."<BR>
Upraised he turned<BR>
From the talk and the trouble,<BR>
To where the gem-field<BR>
Dealt out goodly treasure;<BR>
As she looked and beheld<BR>
All the wealth that she had,<BR>
And the hungry bondmaids,<BR>
And maids of the hall.<BR>
With no good in her heart<BR>
She donned her gold byrny,<BR>
Ere she thrust the sword point<BR>
Through the midst of her body:<BR>
On the boister's far side<BR>
Sank she adown,<BR>
And, smitten with sword,<BR>
Still bethought her of redes.<BR>
"Let all come forth<BR>
Who are fain the red gold,<BR>
Or things less worthy<BR>
To win from my hands;<BR>
To each one I give<BR>
A necklace gilt over,<BR>
Wrought hangings and bed=gear,<BR>
And bright woven weed."<BR>
All they kept silence,<BR>
And thought what to speak,<BR>
Then all at once<BR>
Answer gave:<BR>
"Full enow are death-doomed,<BR>
Fain are we to live yet,<BR>
Maids of the hall<BR>
All meet work winning."<BR>
"From her wise heart at last<BR>
The linen-clad damsel,<BR>
The one of few years<BR>
Gave forth the word:<BR>
"I will that none driven<BR>
By hand or by word,<BR>
For our sake should lose<BR>
Well-loved life.<BR>
"Thou on the bones of you<BR>
Surely shall burn,<BR>
Less dear treasure<BR>
At your departing<BR>
Nor with Menia's Meal [1]<BR>
Shall ye come to see me."<BR>
"Sit thee down, Gunnar,<BR>
A word must I say to thee<BR>
Of the life's ruin<BR>
Of thy lightsome bride--<BR>
Nor shall thy ship<BR>
Swim soft and sweetly<BR>
For all that I<BR>
Lay life adown.<BR>
"Sooner than ye might deem<BR>
Shall ye make peace with Gudrun,<BR>
For the wise woman<BR>
Shall full in the young wife<BR>
The hard memory<BR>
Of her dead husband.<BR>
"There is a may born<BR>
Reared by her mother,<BR>
Whiter and brighter<BR>
Than is the bright day;<BR>
She shall be Swanhild,<BR>
She shall be Sunbeam.<BR>
"Thou shalt give Gudrun<BR>
Unto a great one,<BR>
Noble, well-praised<BR>
Of the world's folk;<BR>
Not with her goodwill,<BR>
Or love shalt thou give her;<BR>
Yet will Atli<BR>
Come to win her,<BR>
My very brother,<BR>
Born of Budli.<BR>
"Ah! Many a memory<BR>
Of how ye dealt with me,<BR>
How sorely, how evilly<BR>
Ye ever beguiled me,<BR>
How all pleasure left me<BR>
The while my life lasted!--<BR>
"Fain wilt thou be<BR>
Oddrun to win,<BR>
But thy good liking<BR>
Shall Atli let;<BR>
But in secret wise<BR>
Shall ye win together,<BR>
And she shall love thee<BR>
As I had loved thee,<BR>
If in such wise<BR>
Fare had willed it.<BR>
"But with all ill<BR>
Shall Atli sting thee,<BR>
Into the strait worm-close<BR>
Shall he cast thee.<BR>
"But no long space<BR>
Shall slip away<BR>
Ere Atli too<BR>
All life shall lose,<BR>
Yea, all his weal<BR>
With the life of his sons,<BR>
For a dreadful bed<BR>
Dights Gudrun for him,<BR>
From a heart sore laden,<BR>
With the sword's sharp edge.<BR>
"More seemly for Gudrun,<BR>
Your very sister,<BR>
In death to wend after<BR>
Her love first wed;<BR>
Had but good rede<BR>
To her been given,<BR>
Or if her heart<BR>
Had been like to my heart.<BR>
"Faint my speech groweth--<BR>
But for our sake<BR>
Ne'er shall she lose<BR>
Her life beloved;<BR>
The sea shall have her,<BR>
High billows bear her<BR>
Forth unto Jonakr's<BR>
Fair land of his fathers.<BR>
"There shall she bear sons,<BR>
Stays of a heritage,<BR>
Stays of a heritage,<BR>
Jonakr's sons;<BR>
And Swanhild shall she<BR>
Send from the land,<BR>
That may born of her,<BR>
The may born of Sigurd.<BR>
"Her shall bite<BR>
The rede of Bikki,<BR>
Whereas for no good<BR>
Wins Jormunrek life;<BR>
And so is clean perished<BR>
All the kin of Sigurd,<BR>
Yea, and more greeting,<BR>
And more for Gudrun.<BR>
"And now one prayer<BR>
Yet pray I of thee--<BR>
That last word of mine<BR>
Here in the world--<BR>
So broad on the field<BR>
Be the burg of the dead<BR>
That fair space may be left<BR>
For us all to lie down,<BR>
All those that died<BR>
At Sigurd's death!<BR>
"Hang round that burg<BR>
Fair hangings and shields,<BR>
Web by Gauls woven,<BR>
And folk of the Gauls:<BR>
There burn the Hun King<BR>
Lying beside me.<BR>
"But on the other side<BR>
Burn by the Hun King<BR>
Those who served me<BR>
Strewn with treasure;<BR>
Two at the head,<BR>
And two at the feet,<BR>
Two hounds therewith,<BR>
And two hawks moreover:<BR>
Then is all dealt<BR>
With even dealing.<BR>
"Lay there amidst us<BR>
The right-dight metal,<BR>
The sharp-edged steel,<BR>
That so lay erst;<BR>
When we both together<BR>
Into one bed went,<BR>
And were called by the name<BR>
Of man and wife.<BR>
"Never, then, belike<BR>
Shall clash behind him<BR>
Valhall's bright door<BR>
With rings bedight:<BR>
And if my fellowship<BR>
Followeth after,<BR>
In no wretched wise<BR>
Then shall we wend.<BR>
"For him shall follow<BR>
My five bondmaids,<BR>
My eight bondsmen,<BR>
No borel folk:<BR>
Yea, and my fosterer,<BR>
And my father's dower<BR>
That Budli of old days<BR>
Gave to his dear child.<BR>
"Much have I spoken,<BR>
More would I speak,<BR>
If the sword would give me<BR>
Space for speech;<BR>
But my words are waning,<BR>
My wounds are swelling--<BR>
Naught but truth have I told--<BR>
And now make I ending."</P></DIR>
