<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Of Sigurd's Meeting with Brynhild on the Mountain.</H2>
<P>By long roads rides Sigurd, till he comes at the last up on to Hindfell, and wends his way south to the land of the Franks; and he sees before him on the fell a great light, as of fire burning, and flaming up even unto the heavens; and when he came thereto, lo, a shield hung castle before him, and a banner on the topmost thereof: into the castle went Sigurd, and saw one lying there asleep, and all-armed. Therewith he takes the helm from off the head of him, and sees that it is no man, but a woman; and she was clad in a byrny as closely set on her as though it had gown to her flesh; so he rent it from the collar downwards; and then the sleeves thereof, and ever the sword bit on it as if it were cloth. Then said Sigurd that over-long had she lain asleep; but she asked--</P>
<P>"What thing of great might is it that has prevailed to rend my byrny, and draw me from my sleep?"</P>
<P>Even as sings the song [1]</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"What bit on the byrny,<BR>
Why breaks my sleep away,<BR>
Who has turned from me<BR>
My wan tormenting?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"Ah, is it so, that here is come Sigurd Sigmundson, bearing Fafnir's helm on his head and Fafnir's bane in his hand?"</P>
<P>Then answered Sigurd--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Sigmund's son<BR>
With Sigurd's sword<BR>
E'en now rent down<BR>
The raven's wall."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"Of the Volsung's kin is he who has done the deed; but now I have heard that thou art daughter of a mighty king, and folk have told us that thou wert lovely and full of lore, and now I will try the same."</P>
<P>Then Brynhild sang--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Long have I slept<BR>
And slumbered long,<BR>
Many and long are the woes of mankind,<BR>
By the might of Odin<BR>
Must I bide helpless<BR>
To shake from off me the spells of slumber.<BR>
"Hail to the day come back!<BR>
Hail, sons of the daylight!<BR>
Hail to thee, dark night, and thy daughter!<BR>
Look with kind eyes a-down,<BR>
On us sitting here lonely,<BR>
And give unto us the gain that we long for.<BR>
"Hail to the Aesir,<BR>
And the sweet Asyniur! [2]<BR>
Hail to the fair earth fulfilled of plenty!<BR>
Fair words, wise hearts,<BR>
Would we win from you,<BR>
And healing hands while life we hold."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Then Brynhild speaks again and says, "Two kings fought, one hight Helm Gunnar, an old man, and the greatest of warriors, and Odin had promised the victory unto him; but his foe was Agnar, or Audi's brother, and so I smote down Helm Gunnar in the fight; and Odin, in vengeance for that deed, stuck the sleep-thorn into me, and said that I should never again have the victory, but should be given away in marriage; but there against I vowed a vow, that never would I wed one who knew the name of fear."</P>
<P>Then said Sigurd, "Teach us the lore of mighty matters!"</P>
<P>She said, "Belike thou cannest more skill in all than I; yet will I teach thee; yea, and with thanks, if there be aught of my cunning that will in anywise pleasure thee, either of runes or of other matters that are the root of things; but now let us drink together, and may the Gods give to us twain a good day, that thou mayst win good help and fame from my wisdom, and that thou mayst hereafter mind thee of that which we twain speak together."</P>
<P>Then Brynhild filled a beaker and bore it to Sigurd, and gave him the drink of love, and spake--</P><DIR>

<P>"Beer bring I to thee,<BR>
Fair fruit of the byrnies' clash,<BR>
Mixed is it mightily,<BR>
Mingled with fame,<BR>
Brimming with bright lays<BR>
And pitiful runes,<BR>
Wise words, sweet words,<BR>
Speech of great game.<BR>
"Runes of war know thou,<BR>
If great thou wilt be!<BR>
Cut them on hilt of hardened sword,<BR>
Some on the brand's back,<BR>
Some on its shining side,<BR>
Twice name Tyr therein.<BR>
"Sea-runes good at need,<BR>
Learnt for ship's saving,<BR>
For the good health of the swimming horse;<BR>
On the stern cut them,<BR>
Cut them on the rudder-blade<BR>
And set flame to shaven oar:<BR>
Howso big be the sea-hills,<BR>
Howso blue beneath,<BR>
Hail from the main then comest thou home.<BR>
"Word-runes learn well<BR>
If thou wilt that no man<BR>
Pay back grief for the grief thou gavest;<BR>
Wind thou these,<BR>
Weave thou these,<BR>
Cast thou these all about thee,<BR>
At the Thing,<BR>
Where folk throng,<BR>
Unto the full doom faring.<BR>
"Of ale-runes know the wisdom<BR>
If thou wilt that another's wife<BR>
Should not bewray thine heart that trusteth:<BR>
Cut them on the mead-horn,<BR>
On the back of each hand,<BR>
And nick an N upon thy nail.<BR>
"Ale have thou heed<BR>
To sign from all harm<BR>
Leek lay thou in the liquor,<BR>
Then I know for sure<BR>
Never cometh to thee,<BR>
Mead with hurtful matters mingled.<BR>
"Help-runes shalt thou gather<BR>
If skill thou wouldst gain<BR>
To loosen child from low-laid mother;<BR>
Cut be they in hands hollow,<BR>
Wrapped the joints round about;<BR>
Call for the Good-folks' gainsome helping.<BR>
"Learn the bough-runes wisdom<BR>
If leech-lore thou lovest;<BR>
And wilt wot about wounds' searching<BR>
On the bark be they scored;<BR>
On the buds of trees<BR>
Whose boughs look eastward ever.<BR>
"Thought-runes shalt thou deal with<BR>
If thou wilt be of all men<BR>
Fairest-souled wight, and wisest,<BR>
These areded<BR>
These first cut<BR>
These first took to heart high Hropt.<BR>
"On the shield were they scored<BR>
That stands before the shining God,<BR>
On Early-waking's ear,<BR>
On All-knowing's hoof,<BR>
On the wheel which runneth<BR>
Under Rognir's chariot;<BR>
On Sleipnir's jaw-teeth,<BR>
On the sleigh's traces.<BR>
"On the rough bear's paws,<BR>
And on Bragi's tongue,<BR>
On the wolfs claws,<BR>
And on eagle's bill,<BR>
On bloody wings,<BR>
And bridge's end;<BR>
On loosing palms,<BR>
And pity's path:<BR>
"On glass, and on gold,<BR>
And on goodly silver,<BR>
In wine and in wort,<BR>
And the seat of the witch-wife;<BR>
On Gungnir's point,<BR>
And Grani's bosom;<BR>
On the Norn's nail,<BR>
And the neb of the night-owl.<BR>
"All these so cut,<BR>
Were shaven and sheared,<BR>
And mingled in with holy mead,<BR>
And sent upon wide ways enow;<BR>
Some abide with the Elves,<BR>
Some abide with the Aesir,<BR>
Or with the wise Vanir,<BR>
Some still hold the sons of mankind.<BR>
"These be the book-runes,<BR>
And the runes of good help,<BR>
And all the ale-runes,<BR>
And the runes of much might;<BR>
To whomso they may avail,<BR>
Unbewildered unspoilt;<BR>
They are wholesome to have:<BR>
Thrive thou with these then.<BR>
When thou hast learnt their lore,<BR>
Till the Gods end thy life-days.<BR>
"Now shalt thou choose thee<BR>
E'en as choice is bidden,<BR>
Sharp steel's root and stem,<BR>
Choose song or silence;<BR>
See to each in thy heart,<BR>
All hurt has been heeded."<BR>
Then answered Sigurd--<BR>
"Ne'er shall I flee,<BR>
Though thou wottest me fey;<BR>
Never was I born for blenching,<BR>
Thy loved rede will I<BR>
Hold aright in my heart Even as long as I may live."</P></DIR>
