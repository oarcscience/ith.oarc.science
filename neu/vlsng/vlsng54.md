# THE LAY OF HAMDIR

Great deeds of bale  
In the garth began,  
At the sad dawning  
The tide of Elves' sorrow  
When day is a-waxing  
And man's grief awaketh,  
And the sorrow of each one  
The early day quickeneth.  
Not now, not now,  
Nor yesterday,  
But long ago  
Has that day worn by,  
That ancientest time,  
The first time to tell of,  
Then, whenas Gudrun,  
Born of Giuki,  
Whetter her sons  
To Swanhild's avenging.  
"Your sister's name  
Was naught but Swanhild,  
Whom Jormunrek  
With horses has trodden!--  
White horses and black  
On the war-beaten way,  
Grey horses that go  
On the roads of the Goths.  
"All alone am I now  
As in holt is the aspen;  
As the fir-tree of boughs,  
So of kin am I bare;  
As bare of things longed for  
As the willow of leaves  
When the bough-breaking wind  
The warm day endeth.  
"Few, sad, are ye left  
O kings of my folk!  
Yet alone living  
Last shreds of my kin!  
"Ah, naught are ye grown  
As that Gunnar of old days;  
Naught are your hearts  
As the heart of Hogni!  
Well would ye seek  
Vengeance to win  
If your hearts were in aught  
As the hearts of my brethren!"  
Then spake Hamdir The high-hearted:  
"Nought hadst thou to praise  
The doings of Hogni,  
When they woke up Sigurd  
From out of slumber,  
And in bed thou sat'st up  
'Mid the banes-men's laughter.  
"Then when thy bed-gear,  
Blue-white, well woven  
By art of craftsmen  
All swam with thy king's blood;  
The Sigurd died,  
O'er his dead corpse thou sattest,  
Not heeding aught gladsome,  
Since Gunnar so willed it.  
"Great grief for Atli  
Gatst thou by Erp's murder,  
And the end of thine Eitil,  
But worse grief for thyself.  
Good to use sword  
For the slaying of others  
In such wise that its edge  
Shall not turn on ourselves!"  
Then well spake Sorli  
From a heart full of wisdom:  
"No words will I  
Make with my mother,  
Though both ye twain  
Need words belike--  
What askest thou, Gudrun,  
To let thee go greeting?  
"Weep for thy brethren,  
Weep for thy sweet sons,  
And thy nighest kinsfolk  
Laid by the fight-side!  
Yea, and thou Gudrun,  
May'st greet for us twain  
Sitting fey on our steeds  
Doomed in far lands to die."  
From the garth forth they went  
With hearts full of fury,  
Sorli and Hamdir,  
The sons of Gudrun,  
And they met on the way  
The wise in all wiles:  
"And thou little Erp,  
What helping from thee?"  
He of alien womb  
Spake out in such wise:  
"Good help for my kin,  
Such as foot gives to foot,  
Or flesh-covered hand  
Gives unto hand!"  
"What helping for foot  
That help that foot giveth,  
Or for flesh-covered hand  
The helping of hand?"  
Then spake Erp  
Yet once again  
Mock spake the prince  
As he sat on his steed:  
"Fool's deed to show  
The way to a dastard!"  
"Bold beyond measure,"  
Quoth they, "is the base-born!"  
Out from the sheath  
Drew they the sheath-steel,  
And the glaives' edges played  
For the pleasure of hell;  
By the third part they minished  
The might that they had,  
Their young kin they let lie  
A-cold on the earth.  
Then their fur-cloaks they shook  
And bound fast their swords,  
In webs goodly woven  
Those great ones were clad;  
Young they went o'er the fells  
Where the dew was new-fallen  
Swift, on steeds of the Huns,  
Heavy vengeance to wreak.  
Forth stretched the ways,  
And an ill way they found,  
Yea, their sister's son \[1\]  
Hanging slain upon tree--  
Wolf-trees by the wind made cold  
At the town's westward  
Loud with cranes' clatter--  
Ill abiding there long!  
Din in the king's hall  
Of men merry with drink,  
And none might hearken  
The horses' tramping  
Or ever the warders  
Their great horn winded.  
Then men went forth  
To Jormunrek  
To tell of the heeding  
Of men under helm:  
"Give ye good counsel!  
Great ones are come hither,  
For the wrong of men mighty  
Was the may to death trodden."  
"Loud Jormunrek laughed,  
And laid hand to his beard,  
Nor bade bring his byrny,  
But with the wine fighting,  
Shook his red locks,  
On his white shield sat staring,  
And in his hand  
Swung the gold cup on high.  
"Sweet sight for me  
Those twain to set eyes on,  
Sorli and Hamdir,  
Here in my hall!  
Then with bowstrings  
Would I bind them,  
And hang the good Giukings  
Aloft on the gallows!"

Then spake Hrothglod  
From off the high steps,  
Spake the slim-fingered  
Unto her son,--  
For a threat was cast forth  
Of what ne'er should fall--  
"Shall two men alone  
Two hundred Gothfolk  
Bind or bear down  
In the midst of their burg?"

Strife and din in the hall,  
Cups smitten asunder  
Men lay low in blood  
From the breasts of Goths flowing.  
Then spake Hamdir,  
The high-hearted:  
"Thou cravedst, O king,  
From the coming of us,  
The sons of one mother,  
Amidmost thine hall--  
Look on these hands of thine,  
Look on these feet of thine,  
Cast by us, Jormunrek,  
On to the flame!"  
Then cried aloud  
The high Gods' kinsman \[2\]  
Bold under byrny,--  
Roared he as bears roar;  
"Stones to the stout ones  
That the spears bite not,  
Nor the edges of steel,  
These sons of Jonakr!"

QUOTH SORLI:

"Bale, brother, wroughtst thou  
By that bag's \[3\] opening,  
Oft from that bag  
Rede of bale cometh!  
Heart hast thou, Hamdir,  
If thou hadst heart's wisdom  
Great lack in a man  
Who lacks wisdom and lore!"

HAMDIR SAID:

"Yes, off were the head  
If Erp were alive yet,  
Our brother the bold  
Whom we slew by the way;  
The far-famed through the world--  
Ah, the fares drave me on,  
And the man war made holy,  
There must I slay!"

SORLI SAID:

"Unmeet we should do  
As the doings of wolves are,  
Raising wrong each 'gainst other  
As the dogs of the Norns,  
The greedy ones nourished  
In waste steads of the world.  
In strong wise have we fought,  
On Goths' corpses we stand,  
Beat down by our edges,  
E'en as ernes on the bough.  
Great fame our might winneth,  
Die we now, or to-morrow,--  
No man lives till eve  
Whom the fates doom at morning."  
At the hall's gable-end  
Fell Sorli to earth,  
But Hamdir lay low  
At the back of the houses.

Now this is called the Ancient Lay of Hamdir.
