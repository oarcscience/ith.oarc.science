# CHAPTER XXV.

## Of the Dream of Gudrun, Giuki's daughter.

There was a king hight Giuki, who ruled a realm south of the Rhine;
three sons he had, thus named: Gunnar, Hogni, and Guttorm, and Gudrun
was the name of his daughter, the fairest of maidens; and all these
children were far before all other king's children in all prowess, and
in goodliness and growth withal; ever were his sons at the wars and
wrought many a deed of fame. But Giuki had wedded Grimhild the
Wise-wife.

Now Budli was the name of a king mightier than Giuki, mighty though they
both were: and Atli was the brother of Brynhild: Atli was a fierce man
and a grim, great and black to look on, yet noble of mien withal, and
the greatest of warriors. Grimhild was a fierce-heart woman.

Now the days of the Giukings bloomed fair, and chiefly because of those
children, so far before the sons of men.

On a day Gudrun says to her mays that she may have no joy of heart; then
a certain woman asked her wherefore her joy was departed.

She answered, "Grief came to me in my dreams, therefore is there sorrow
in my heart, since thou must needs ask thereof."

"Tell it me, then, thy dream," said the woman, "for dreams oft forecast
but the weather."

Gudrun answers, "Nay, nay, no weather is this; I dreamed that I had a
fair hawk on my wrist, feathered with feathers of gold."

Says the woman, "Many have heard tell of thy beauty, thy wisdom, and thy
courtesy; some king's son abides thee, then."

Gudrun answers, "I dreamed that naught was so dear to me as this hawk,
and all my wealth had I cast aside rather than him."

The woman said, "Well, then, the man thou shalt have will be of the
goodliest, and well shalt thou love him."

Gudrun answered, "It grieves me that I know not who he shall be; let us
go seek Brynhild, for she belike will wot thereof."

So they arrayed them in gold and many a fair thing, and she went with
her damsels till they came to the hall of Brynhild, and that hall was
dight with gold, and stood on a high hill; and whenas their goings were
seen, it was told Brynhild, that a company of women drove toward the
burg in gilded waggons.

"That shall be Gudrun, Giuki's daughter," says she: "I dreamed of her
last night; let us go meet her! No fairer woman may come to our house."

So they went abroad to meet them, and gave them good greeting, and they
went into the goodly hall together; fairly painted it was within, and
well adorned with silver vessel; cloths were spread under the feet of
them, and all folk served them, and in many wise they sported.

But Gudrun was somewhat silent.

Then said Brynhild, "Ill to abash folk of their mirth; prithee do not
so; let us talk together for our disport of mighty kings and their great
deeds."

"Good talk," says Gudrun, "let us do even so; what kings deemest thou to
have been the first of all men?"

Brynhild says, "The sons of Haki, and Hagbard withal; they brought to
pass many a deed of fame in the warfare."

Gudrun answers, "Great men certes, and of noble fame! Yet Sigar took
their one sister, and burned the other, house and all; and they may be
called slow to revenge the deed; why didst thou not name my brethren who
are held to be the first of men as at this time?"

Brynhild says, "Men of good hope are they surely though but little
proven hitherto; but one I know far before them, Sigurd, the son of
Sigmund the king; a youngling was he in the days when he slew the sons
of Hunding, and revenged his father, and Eylimi, his mother's father."

Said Gudrun, "By what token tellest thou that?"

Brynhild answered, "His mother went amid the dead and found Sigmund the
king sore wounded, and would bind up his hurts; but he said he grew over
old for war; and bade her lay this comfort to her heart, that she should
bear the most famed of sons; and wise was the wise man's word therein:
for after the death of King Sigmund, she went to King Alf, and there was
Sigurd nourished in great honour, and day by day he wrought some deed of
fame, and is the man most renowned of all the wide world."

Gudrun says, "From love hast thou gained these tidings of him; but for
this cause came I here, to tell thee dreams of mine which have brought
me great grief."

Says Brynhild, "Let not such matters sadden thee: abide with thy friends
who wish thee blithesome, all of them!"

"This I dreamed," said Gudrun, "that we went, a many of us in company,
from the bower, and we saw an exceeding great hart, that far excelled
all other deer ever seen, and the hair of him was golden; and this deer
we were all fain to take, but I alone got him; and he seemed to me
better than all things else; but sithence thou, Byrnhild, didst shoot
and slay my deer even at my very knees, and such grief was that to me
that scarce might I bear it; and then afterwards thou gavest me a
wolf-cub, which besprinkled me with the blood of my brethren."

Brynhild answers, "I will arede thy dream, even as things shall come to
pass hereafter; for Sigurd shall come to thee, even he whom I have
chosen for my well-beloved; and Grimhild shall give him mead mingled
with hurtful things, which shall cast us all into mighty strife. Him
shalt thou have, and him shalt thou quickly miss; and Atli the king
shalt thou wed; and thy brethren shalt thou lose, and slay Atli withal
in the end."

Dudrun answers, "Grief and woe to know that such things shall be!"

And therewith she and hers get them gone home to King Giuki.
