<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SONG OF ATLI.</H1>
<P>Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, avenger her brethren, as is told far and wide; first she slew the sons of Atli, and then Atli himself; and she burned the hall thereafter, and all the household with it: and about these matters is this song made:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>In days long gone<BR>
Sent Atli to Gunnar<BR>
A crafty one riding,<BR>
Knefrud men called him;<BR>
To Giuki's garth came he,<BR>
To the hall of Gunnar,<BR>
To the benches gay-dight,<BR>
And the gladsome drinking.<BR>
There drank the great folk<BR>
'Mid the guileful one's silence,<BR>
Drank wine in their fair hall:<BR>
The Huns' wrath they feared<BR>
When Knefrud cried<BR>
In his cold voice,<BR>
As he sat on the high seat,<BR>
That man of the Southland:<BR>
"Atli has sent me<BR>
Riding swift on his errands<BR>
On the bit-griping steed<BR>
Through dark woodways unbeaten,<BR>
To bid thee, King Gunnar,<BR>
Come to his fair bench<BR>
With helm well-adorned,<BR>
To the house of King Atli.<BR>
"Shield shall ye have there<BR>
And spears ashen-shafted,<BR>
Helms ruddy with gold,<BR>
And hosts of the Huns;<BR>
Saddle-gear silver gilt,<BR>
Shirts red as blood,<BR>
The hedge of the warwife,<BR>
And horses bit-griping.<BR>
"And he saith he will give you<BR>
Gnitaheath widespread,<BR>
And whistling spears<BR>
And prows well-gilded,<BR>
Might wealth<BR>
With the stead of Danpi,<BR>
And that noble wood<BR>
Men name the Murkwood."<BR>
Then Gunnar turned head<BR>
And spake unto Hogni:<BR>
"What rede from thee, high one,<BR>
Since such things we hear?<BR>
No gold know I<BR>
On Gnitaheath,<BR>
That we for our parts<BR>
Have not portion as great.<BR>
"Seven halls we have<BR>
Fulfilled of swords,<BR>
And hilts of gold<BR>
Each sword there has;<BR>
My horse is the best,<BR>
My blade is the keenest;<BR>
Fair my bow o'er the bench is,<BR>
Gleams my byrny with gold;<BR>
Brightest helm, brightest shield,<BR>
From Kiar's dwelling ere brought--<BR>
Better all things I have<BR>
Than all things of the Huns."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>HOGNI SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"What mind has our sister<BR>
That a ring she hath sent us<BR>
In weed of wolves clad?<BR>
Bids she not to be wary?<BR>
For a wolf's hair I found<BR>
The fair ring wreathed about;<BR>
Wolf beset shall the way be<BR>
If we wend on this errand."<BR>
No sons whetted Gunnar,<BR>
Nor none of his kin,<BR>
Nor learned men nor wise men,<BR>
Nor such as were mighty.<BR>
Then spake Gunnar<BR>
E'en as a king should speak,<BR>
Glorious in mead-hall<BR>
From great heart and high:<BR>
"Rise up now, Fiornir,<BR>
Forth down the benches<BR>
Let the gold-cups of great ones<BR>
Pass in hands of my good-men!<BR>
Well shall we drink wine,<BR>
Draughts dear to our hearts,<BR>
Though the last of all feasts<BR>
In our fair house this be!<BR>
"For the wolves shall rule<BR>
O'er the wealth of the Niblungs,<BR>
With the pine-woods' wardens<BR>
In Gunnar perish:<BR>
And the black-felled bears<BR>
With fierce teeth shall bite<BR>
For the glee of the dog kind,<BR>
If again comes not Gunnar."<BR>
Then good men never shamed,<BR>
Greeting aloud,<BR>
Led the great king of men<BR>
From the garth of his home;<BR>
And cried the fair son<BR>
Of Hogni the king:<BR>
"Fare happy, O Lords,<BR>
Whereso your hearts lead you!"<BR>
Then the bold knights<BR>
Let their bit-griping steeds<BR>
Wend swift o'er the fells,<BR>
Tread the murk-wood unknown,<BR>
All the Hunwood was shaking<BR>
As the hardy ones fared there;<BR>
O'er the green meads they urged<BR>
Their steeds shy of the goad.<BR>
Then Atli's land saw they;<BR>
Great towers and strong,<BR>
And the bold men of Bikki,<BR>
Aloft on the burg:<BR>
The Southland folks' hall<BR>
Set with benches about,<BR>
Dight with bucklers well bounden,<BR>
And bright white shining shields.<BR>
There drank Atli,<BR>
The awful Hun king,<BR>
Wine in his fair hall;<BR>
Without were the warders,<BR>
Gunnar's folk to have heed of,<BR>
Lest they had fared thither<BR>
With the whistling spear<BR>
War to wake 'gainst the king.<BR>
But first came their sister<BR>
As they came to the hall,<BR>
Both her brethren she met,<BR>
With beer little gladdened:<BR>
"Bewrayed art thou, Gunnar!<BR>
What dost thou great king<BR>
To deal war to the Huns?<BR>
Go thou swift from the hall!<BR>
Better, brother, hadst thou<BR>
Fared here in thy byrny<BR>
Than with helm gaily dight<BR>
Looked on Atli's great house:<BR>
Them hadst sat then in saddle<BR>
Through days bright with the sun<BR>
Fight to awaken<BR>
And fair fields to redden:<BR>
"O'er the folk fate makes pale<BR>
Should the Norn's tears have fallen,<BR>
The shield mays of the Huns<BR>
Should have known of all sorrow;<BR>
And King Atli himself<BR>
To worm-close should be brought;<BR>
But now is the worm-close<BR>
Kept but for thee."<BR>
Then spake Gunnar<BR>
Great 'mid the people:<BR>
"Over-late sister<BR>
The Niblungs to summon;<BR>
A long way to seek<BR>
The helping of warriors,<BR>
The high lord unshamed,<BR>
From the hills of the Rhine!"<BR>
Seven Hogni beat down<BR>
With his sword sharp-grinded,<BR>
And the eighth man he thrust<BR>
Amidst of the fire.<BR>
Ever so shall famed warrior<BR>
Fight with his foemen,<BR>
As Hogni fought<BR>
For the hand of Gunnar.<BR>
But on Gunnar they fell,<BR>
And set him in fetters,<BR>
And bound hard and fast<BR>
That friend of Burgundians;<BR>
Then the warrior they asked<BR>
If he would buy life,<BR>
But life with gold<BR>
That king of the Goths.<BR>
Nobly spake Gunnar,<BR>
Great lord of the Niblungs;<BR>
"Hogni's bleeding heart first<BR>
Shall lie in mine hand,<BR>
Cut from the breast<BR>
Of the bold-riding lord,<BR>
With bitter-sharp knife<BR>
From the son of the king."<BR>
With guile the great one<BR>
Would they beguile,<BR>
On the wailing thrall<BR>
Laid they hand unwares,<BR>
And cut the heart<BR>
From out of Hjalli,<BR>
Laid it bleeding on trencher<BR>
And bare it to Gunnar.<BR>
"Here have I the heart<BR>
Of Hjalli the trembler,<BR>
Little like the heart<BR>
Of Hogni the hardy:<BR>
As much as it trembleth<BR>
Laid on the trencher<BR>
By the half more it trembled<BR>
In the breast of him hidden."<BR>
Then laughed Hogni<BR>
When they cut the heart from him,<BR>
From the crest-smith yet quick,<BR>
Little thought he to quail.<BR>
The hard acorn of thought<BR>
From the high king they took,<BR>
Laid it bleeding on trencher<BR>
And bare it Gunnar.<BR>
"Here have I the heart<BR>
Of Hogni the hardy,<BR>
Little like to the heart<BR>
Of Hjalli the trembler.<BR>
Howso little it quaketh<BR>
Laid here on the dish,<BR>
Yet far less it quaked<BR>
In the breast of him laid.<BR>
"So far mayst thou bide<BR>
From men's eyen, O Atli,<BR>
As from that treasure<BR>
Thou shalt abide!<BR>
"Behold in my heart<BR>
Is hidden for ever<BR>
That hoard of the Niblungs,<BR>
Now Hogni is dead.<BR>
Doubt threw me two ways<BR>
While the twain of us lived,<BR>
But all that is gone<BR>
Now I live on alone.<BR>
"The great Rhine shall rule<BR>
O'er the hate-raising treasure,<BR>
That gold of the Niblungs,<BR>
The seed of the gods:<BR>
In the weltering water<BR>
Shall that wealth lie a-gleaming,<BR>
Or it shine on the hands<BR>
Of the children of Huns!"<BR>
Then cried Atli,<BR>
King of the Hun-folk,<BR>
"Drive forth your wains now<BR>
The slave is fast bounden."<BR>
And straightly thence<BR>
The bit-shaking steeds<BR>
Drew the hoard-warden,<BR>
The war-god to his death.<BR>
Atli the great king,<BR>
Rode upon Glaum,<BR>
With shields set round about,<BR>
And sharp thorns of battle:<BR>
Gudrun, bound by wedlock<BR>
To these, victory made gods of,<BR>
Held back her tears<BR>
As the hall she ran into.<BR>
"Let it fare with thee, Atli,<BR>
E'en after thine oaths sworn<BR>
To Gunnar fell often;<BR>
Yea, oaths sworn of old time,<BR>
By the sun sloping southward,<BR>
By the high burg of Sigry,<BR>
By the fair bed of rest,<BR>
By the red ring of Ull!"<BR>
Now a host of men<BR>
Cast the high king alive<BR>
Into a close<BR>
Crept o'er within<BR>
With most foul worms,<BR>
Fulfilled of all venom,<BR>
Ready grave to dig<BR>
In his doughty heart.<BR>
Wrathful-hearted he smote<BR>
The harp with his hand,<BR>
Gunnar laid there alone;<BR>
And loud rang the strings.--<BR>
In such wise ever<BR>
Should hardy ring-scatterer<BR>
Keep gold from all folk<BR>
In the garth of his foeman.<BR>
Then Atli would wend<BR>
About his wide land,<BR>
On his steed brazen shod,<BR>
Back from the murder.<BR>
Din there was in the garth,<BR>
All thronged with the horses;<BR>
High the weapon-song rose<BR>
From men come from the heath.<BR>
Out then went Gudrun,<BR>
'Gainst Atli returning,<BR>
With a cup gilded over,<BR>
To greet the land's ruler;<BR>
"Come, then, and take it,<BR>
King glad in thine hall,<BR>
From Gudrun's hands,<BR>
For the hell-farers groan not!"<BR>
Clashed the beakers of Atli,<BR>
Wine-laden on bench,<BR>
As in hall there a-gathered,<BR>
The Huns fell a-talking,<BR>
And the long-bearded eager ones<BR>
Entered therein,<BR>
From a murk den new-come,<BR>
From the murder of Gunnar.<BR>
Then hastened the sweet-faced<BR>
Delight of the shield-folk,<BR>
Bright in the fair hall,<BR>
Wine to bear to them:<BR>
The dreadful woman<BR>
Gave dainties withal<BR>
To the lords pale with fate,<BR>
Laid strange word upon Atli:<BR>
"The hearts of thy sons<BR>
Hast thou eaten, sword-dealer,<BR>
All bloody with death<BR>
And drenched with honey:<BR>
In most heavy mood<BR>
Brood o'er venison of men!<BR>
Drink rich draughts therewith,<BR>
Down the high benches send it!<BR>
"Never callest thou now<BR>
From henceforth to thy knee<BR>
Fair Erp or fair Eiril,<BR>
Bright-faced with the drink;<BR>
Never seest thou them now<BR>
Amidmost the seat,<BR>
Scattering the gold,<BR>
Or shafting of spears;<BR>
Manes trimming duly,<BR>
Or driving steeds forth!"<BR>
Din arose from the benches,<BR>
Dread song of men was there,<BR>
Noise 'mid the fair hangings,<BR>
As all Hun's children wept;<BR>
All saving Gudrun,<BR>
Who never gat greeting,<BR>
For her brethren bear-hardy<BR>
For her sweet sons and bright,<BR>
The young ones, the simple<BR>
Once gotten with Atli.</P>
<P>The seed of gold<BR>
Sowed the swan-bright woman,<BR>
Rings of red gold<BR>
She gave to the house-carls;<BR>
Fate let she wax,<BR>
Let the bright gold flow forth,<BR>
In naught spared that woman<BR>
The store-houses' wealth.<BR>
Atli unaware<BR>
Was a-weary with drink;<BR>
No weapon had he,<BR>
No heeding of Gudrun--<BR>
Ah, the pity would be better,<BR>
When in soft wise they twain<BR>
Would full often embrace<BR>
Before the great lords!<BR>
To the bed with sword-point<BR>
Blood gave she to drink<BR>
With a hand fain of death,<BR>
And she let the dogs loose:<BR>
Then in from the hall-door--<BR>
Up waked the house-carls--<BR>
Hot brands she cast,<BR>
Gat revenge for her brethren.<BR>
To the flame gave she all<BR>
Who therein might be found;<BR>
Fell adown the old timbers,<BR>
Reeked all treasure-houses;<BR>
There the shield-mays were burnt,<BR>
Their lives' span brought to naught;<BR>
In the fierce fire sank down<BR>
All the stead of the Budlungs.<BR>
Wide told of is this--<BR>
Ne'er sithence in the world,<BR>
Thus fared bride clad in byrny<BR>
For her brothers' avenging;<BR>
For behold, this fair woman<BR>
To three kings of the people,<BR>
Hath brought very death<BR>
Or ever she died!</P></DIR>
