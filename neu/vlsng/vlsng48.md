# THE LAY CALLED THE SHORT LAY OF SIGURD.

Sigurd of yore,  
Sought the dwelling of Giuki,  
As he fared, the young Volsung,  
After fight won;  
Troth he took  
From the two brethren;  
Oath swore they betwixt them,  
Those bold ones of deed.  
A may they gave to him  
And wealth manifold,  
Gudrun the young,  
Giuki's daughter:  
They drank and gave doom  
Many days together,  
Sigurd the young,  
And the sons of Giuki.  
Until they wended  
For Brynhild's wooing,  
Sigurd a-riding  
Amidst their rout;  
The wise young Volsung  
Who knew of all ways--  
Ah! He had wed her,  
Had fate so willed it.  
Southlander Sigurd  
A naked sword,  
Bright, well grinded,  
Laid betwixt them;  
No kiss he won  
From the fair woman,  
Nor in arms of his  
Did the Hun King hold her,  
Since he gat the young maid  
For the son of Giuki.  
No lack in her life  
She wotted of now,  
And at her death-day  
No dreadful thing  
For a shame indeed  
Or a shame in seeming;  
But about and betwixt  
Went baleful fate.  
Alone, abroad,  
She sat of an evening,  
Of full many things  
She fall a-talking:  
"O for my Sigurd!  
I shall have death,  
Or my fair, my lovely,  
Laid in mine arms.  
"For the word once spoken,  
I sorrow sorely--  
His queen is Gudrun,  
I am wed to Gunnar;  
The dread Norns wrought for us  
A long while of woe."  
Oft with heart deep  
In dreadful thoughts,  
O'er ice-fields and ice-hills  
She fared a-night time,  
When he and Gudrun  
Were gone to their fair bed,  
And Sigurd wrapped  
The bed-gear round her.  
"Ah! Now the Hun King  
His queen in arms holdeth,  
While love I go lacking,  
And all things longed for  
With no delight  
But in dreadful thought."  
These dreadful things Thrust her toward murder:  
"Listen, Gunnar,  
For thou shalt lose  
My wide lands,  
Yea, me myself!  
Never love I my life,  
With thee for my lord--  
"I will fare back thither  
From whence I came,  
To my nighest kin  
And those that know me  
There shall I sit  
Sleeping my life away,  
Unless thou slayest  
Sigurd the Hun King,  
Making thy might more  
E'en than his might was!  
"Yea, let the son fare  
After the father,  
And no young wolf  
A long while nourish!  
For on earth man lieth  
Vengeance lighter,  
And peace shall be surer  
If the son live not."  
Adrad was Gunnar,  
Heavy-hearted was he,  
And in doubtful mood  
Day-long he sat.  
For naught he wotted,  
Nor might see clearly  
What was the seemliest  
Of deeds to set hand to;  
What of all deeds  
Was best to be done:  
For he minded the vows  
Sworn to the Volsung,  
And the sore wrong  
To be wrought against Sigurd.  
Wavered his mind  
A weary while,  
No wont it was  
Of those days worn by,  
That queens should flee  
From the realms of their kings.  
"Brynhild to me  
Is better than all,  
The child of Budli  
Is the best of women.  
Yea, and my life  
Will I lay down,  
Ere I am twinned  
From that woman's treasure."  
He bade call Hogni  
To the place where he bided;  
With all the trust that might be,  
Trowed he in him.  
"Wilt thou bewray Sigurd  
For his wealth's sake?  
Good it is to rule  
O'er the Rhine's metal;  
And well content  
Great wealth to wield,  
Biding in peace  
And blissful days."  
One thing alone Hogni Had for an answer:  
"Such doings for us  
Are naught seemly to do;  
To rend with sword  
Oaths once sworn,  
Oaths once sworn,  
And troth once plighted.  
"Nor know we on mould,  
Men of happier days,  
The while we four  
Rule over the folk;  
While the bold in battle,  
The Hun King, bides living.  
"And no nobler kin  
Shall be known afield,  
If our five sons  
We long may foster;  
Yea, a goodly stem  
Shall surely wax.  
But I clearly see  
In what wise it standeth,  
Brynhild's sore urging  
O'ermuch on thee beareth.  
"Guttorm shall we  
Get for the slaying,  
Our younger brother  
Bare of wisdom;  
For he was out of  
All the oaths sworn,  
All the oaths sworn,  
And the plighted troth."  
Easy to rouse him  
Who of naught recketh!  
Deep stood the sword  
In the heart of Sigurd.  
There, in the hall,  
Gat the high-hearted vengeance;  
For he can his sword  
At the reckless slayer:  
Out at Guttorm  
Flew Gram the mighty,  
The gleaming steel  
From Sigurd's hand.  
Down fell the slayer  
Smitten asunder;  
The heavy head  
And the hands fell one way,  
But the feet and such like  
Aback where they stood.  
Gudrun was sleeping  
Soft in the bed,  
Empty of sorrow  
By the side of Sigurd:  
When she awoke  
With all pleasure gone,  
Swimming in blood  
Of Frey's beloved.  
So sore her hands  
She smote together,  
That the great-hearted  
Gat raised in bed;  
"O Gudrun, weep not  
So woefully,  
Sweet lovely bride,  
For thy brethren live for thee!  
"A young child have I  
For heritor;  
Too young to win forth  
From the house of his foes.--  
Black deeds and ill  
Have they been a-doing,  
Evil rede  
Have they wrought at last.  
"Late, late, rideth with them  
Unto the Thing,  
Such sister's son,  
Though seven thou bear,--  
But well I wot  
Which way all goeth;  
Alone wrought Brynhild  
This bale against us.  
"That maiden loved me  
Far before all men,  
Yet wrong to Gunnar  
I never wrought;  
Brotherhood I heeded  
And all bounden oaths,  
That none should deem me  
His queen's darling."  
Weary sighed Gudrun,  
As the king gat ending,  
And so sore her hands  
She smote together,  
That the cups arow  
Rang out therewith,  
And the geese cried on high  
That were in the homefield.  
Then laughed Brynhild  
Budli's daughter,  
Once, once only,  
From out her heart;  
When to her bed  
Was borne the sound  
Of the sore greeting  
Of Giuki's daughter.  
Then, quoth Gunnar,  
The king, the hawk-bearer,  
"Whereas, thou laughest,  
O hateful woman,  
Glad on thy bed,  
No good it betokeneth:  
Why lackest thou else  
Thy lovely hue?  
Feeder of foul deeds,  
Fey do I deem thee,  
"Well worthy art thou  
Before all women,  
That thine eyes should see  
Atli slain of us;  
That thy brother's wounds  
Thou shouldest see a-bleeding,  
That his bloody hurts  
Thine hands should bind."  
"No man blameth thee, Gunnar,  
Thou hast fulfilled death's measure  
But naught Atli feareth  
All thine ill will;  
Life shall he lay down  
Later than ye,  
And still bear more might  
Aloft than thy might.  
"I shall tell thee, Gunnar,  
Though well the tale thou knowest,  
In what early days  
Ye dealt abroad your wrong:  
Young was I then,  
Worn with no woe,  
Good wealth I had  
In the house of my brother!  
"No mind had I  
That a man should have me,  
Or ever ye Giukings,  
Rode into our garth;  
There ye sat on your steeds  
Three kings of the people--  
Ah! That that faring  
Had never befallen!  
"Then spake Atli  
To me apart,  
And said that no wealth  
He would give unto me,  
Neither gold nor lands  
If I would not be wedded;  
Nay, and no part  
Of the wealth apportioned,  
Which in my first days  
He gave me duly;  
Which in my first days  
He counted down.  
"Wavered the mind  
Within me then,  
If to fight I should fall  
And the felling of folk,  
Bold in Byrny  
Because of my brother;  
A deed of fame  
Had that been to all folk,  
But to many a man  
Sorrow of mind.  
"So I let all sink  
Into peace at the last:  
More grew I minded  
For the mighty treasure,  
The red-shining rings  
Of Sigmund's son;  
For no man's wealth else  
Would I take unto me.  
"For myself had I given  
To that great king  
Who sat amid gold  
On the back of Grani;  
Nought were his eyes  
Like to your eyen,  
Nor in any wise  
Went his visage with yours;  
Though ye might deem you  
Due kings of men.  
"One I loved,  
One, and none other,  
The gold-decked may  
Had no doubtful mind;  
Thereof shall Atli  
Wot full surely,  
When he getteth to know  
I am gone to the dead.  
"Far be it from me,  
Feeble and wavering,  
Ever to love  
Another's love--  
Yes shall my woe  
Be well avenged."  
Up rose Gunnar,  
The great men's leader,  
And cast his arms  
About the queen's neck;  
And all went nigh  
One after other,  
With their whole hearts  
Her heart to turn.  
But then all these  
From her neck she thrust,  
Of her long journey  
No man should let her.  
Then called he Hogni  
To have talk with him;  
"Let all folk go  
Forth into the hall,  
Thine with mine--  
O need sore and mighty!--  
To wot if we yet  
My wife's parting may stay.  
Till with time's wearing  
Some hindrance wax."  
One answer Hogni  
Had for all;  
"Nay, let hard need  
Have rule thereover,  
And no man let her  
Of her long journey!  
Never born again,  
May she come back thence!  
"Luckless she came  
To the lap of her mother,  
Born into the world  
For utter woe,  
TO many a man  
For heart-whole mourning."  
Upraised he turned  
From the talk and the trouble,  
To where the gem-field  
Dealt out goodly treasure;  
As she looked and beheld  
All the wealth that she had,  
And the hungry bondmaids,  
And maids of the hall.  
With no good in her heart  
She donned her gold byrny,  
Ere she thrust the sword point  
Through the midst of her body:  
On the boister's far side  
Sank she adown,  
And, smitten with sword,  
Still bethought her of redes.  
"Let all come forth  
Who are fain the red gold,  
Or things less worthy  
To win from my hands;  
To each one I give  
A necklace gilt over,  
Wrought hangings and bed=gear,  
And bright woven weed."  
All they kept silence,  
And thought what to speak,  
Then all at once  
Answer gave:  
"Full enow are death-doomed,  
Fain are we to live yet,  
Maids of the hall  
All meet work winning."  
"From her wise heart at last  
The linen-clad damsel,  
The one of few years  
Gave forth the word:  
"I will that none driven  
By hand or by word,  
For our sake should lose  
Well-loved life.  
"Thou on the bones of you  
Surely shall burn,  
Less dear treasure  
At your departing  
Nor with Menia's Meal \[1\]  
Shall ye come to see me."  
"Sit thee down, Gunnar,  
A word must I say to thee  
Of the life's ruin  
Of thy lightsome bride--  
Nor shall thy ship  
Swim soft and sweetly  
For all that I  
Lay life adown.  
"Sooner than ye might deem  
Shall ye make peace with Gudrun,  
For the wise woman  
Shall full in the young wife  
The hard memory  
Of her dead husband.  
"There is a may born  
Reared by her mother,  
Whiter and brighter  
Than is the bright day;  
She shall be Swanhild,  
She shall be Sunbeam.  
"Thou shalt give Gudrun  
Unto a great one,  
Noble, well-praised  
Of the world's folk;  
Not with her goodwill,  
Or love shalt thou give her;  
Yet will Atli  
Come to win her,  
My very brother,  
Born of Budli.  
"Ah! Many a memory  
Of how ye dealt with me,  
How sorely, how evilly  
Ye ever beguiled me,  
How all pleasure left me  
The while my life lasted!--  
"Fain wilt thou be  
Oddrun to win,  
But thy good liking  
Shall Atli let;  
But in secret wise  
Shall ye win together,  
And she shall love thee  
As I had loved thee,  
If in such wise  
Fare had willed it.  
"But with all ill  
Shall Atli sting thee,  
Into the strait worm-close  
Shall he cast thee.  
"But no long space  
Shall slip away  
Ere Atli too  
All life shall lose,  
Yea, all his weal  
With the life of his sons,  
For a dreadful bed  
Dights Gudrun for him,  
From a heart sore laden,  
With the sword's sharp edge.  
"More seemly for Gudrun,  
Your very sister,  
In death to wend after  
Her love first wed;  
Had but good rede  
To her been given,  
Or if her heart  
Had been like to my heart.  
"Faint my speech groweth--  
But for our sake  
Ne'er shall she lose  
Her life beloved;  
The sea shall have her,  
High billows bear her  
Forth unto Jonakr's  
Fair land of his fathers.  
"There shall she bear sons,  
Stays of a heritage,  
Stays of a heritage,  
Jonakr's sons;  
And Swanhild shall she  
Send from the land,  
That may born of her,  
The may born of Sigurd.  
"Her shall bite  
The rede of Bikki,  
Whereas for no good  
Wins Jormunrek life;  
And so is clean perished  
All the kin of Sigurd,  
Yea, and more greeting,  
And more for Gudrun.  
"And now one prayer  
Yet pray I of thee--  
That last word of mine  
Here in the world--  
So broad on the field  
Be the burg of the dead  
That fair space may be left  
For us all to lie down,  
All those that died  
At Sigurd's death!  
"Hang round that burg  
Fair hangings and shields,  
Web by Gauls woven,  
And folk of the Gauls:  
There burn the Hun King  
Lying beside me.  
"But on the other side  
Burn by the Hun King  
Those who served me  
Strewn with treasure;  
Two at the head,  
And two at the feet,  
Two hounds therewith,  
And two hawks moreover:  
Then is all dealt  
With even dealing.  
"Lay there amidst us  
The right-dight metal,  
The sharp-edged steel,  
That so lay erst;  
When we both together  
Into one bed went,  
And were called by the name  
Of man and wife.  
"Never, then, belike  
Shall clash behind him  
Valhall's bright door  
With rings bedight:  
And if my fellowship  
Followeth after,  
In no wretched wise  
Then shall we wend.  
"For him shall follow  
My five bondmaids,  
My eight bondsmen,  
No borel folk:  
Yea, and my fosterer,  
And my father's dower  
That Budli of old days  
Gave to his dear child.  
"Much have I spoken,  
More would I speak,  
If the sword would give me  
Space for speech;  
But my words are waning,  
My wounds are swelling--  
Naught but truth have I told--  
And now make I ending."
