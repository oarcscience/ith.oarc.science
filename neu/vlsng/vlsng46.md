#### EXCERPTS FROM THE POETIC EDDA.

## PART OF THE SECOND LAY OF HELGI HUNDINGS-BANE \[1\]

Helgi wedded Sigrun, and they begate sons together, but Helgi lived not
to be old; for Dag, \[2\] the son of Hogni, sacrificed to Odin, praying
that he might avenge his father. So Odin lent Dag his spear, and Dag met
Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place called Fetter-grove, and thrust
him through with that spear, and there fell Helgi dead; but Dag rode to
Sevafell, and told Sigrun of the news.

DAG:

Loth am I, sister  
Of sorrow to tell the,  
For by hard need driven  
Have I drawn on the greeting;  
This morning fell  
In Fetter-grove  
The king well deemed  
The best in the wide world,  
Yea, he who stood  
On the necks of the strong."

SIGRUN:

All oaths once sworn  
Shall bite thee sore,  
The oaths that to Helgi  
Once thou swarest  
At the bright white  
Water of Lightening, \[3\]  
And at the cold rock  
That the sea runneth over.  
May the ship sweep not on  
That should sweep at its swiftest,  
Though the wind desired  
Behind thee driveth!  
May the horse never run  
That should run at his most might  
When from thy foe's face  
Thou hast most need to flee!  
May the sword never bite  
That thou drawest from scabbard  
But and if round thine head  
In wrath it singeth!  
Then should meet price be paid  
For Helgi's slaying  
When a wolf thou wert  
Out in the wild-wood,  
Empty of good things  
Empty of gladness,  
With no meat for thy mouth  
But dead men's corpses!

DAG:

With mad words thou ravest,  
Thy wits are gone from thee,  
When thou for thy brother  
Such ill fate biddest;  
Odin alone  
Let all this bale loose,  
Casting the strife-runes  
'Twixt friends and kindred.  
Rings of red gold  
Will thy brother give thee,  
And the stead of Vandil  
And the lands of Vigdale;  
Have half of the land  
For thy sorrow's healing,  
O ring-arrayed sweetling  
For thee and thy sons!

SIGRUN:

No more sit I happy  
At Sevafell;  
At day-dawn, at night  
Naught love I my life  
Till broad o'er the people  
My lord's light breaketh;  
Till his war-horse runneth  
Beneath him hither,  
Well wont to the gold bit--  
Till my king I welcome.  
In such wise did Helgi  
Deal fear around  
To all his foes  
And all their friends  
As when the goat runneth  
Before the wolf's rage  
Filled with mad fear  
Down from the fell.  
As high above all lords  
Did Helgi beat him  
As the ash-tree's glory  
From the thorn ariseth,  
Or as the fawn  
With the dew-fell sprinkled  
Is far above  
All other wild things,  
As his horns go gleaming  
'Gainst the very heavens.

A barrow was raised above Helgi, but when he came in Valhall, then Odin
bade him be lord of all things there, even as he; so Helgi sang--

HELGI:

Now shalt thou, Hunding  
For the help of each man  
Get ready the foot-bath,  
And kindle the fire;  
The hounds shalt thou bind  
And give heed to the horses,  
Give wash to the swine  
Ere to sleep thou goest.

A bondmaid of Sigrun went in the evening-tide by Helgi's mound, and
there saw how Helgi rode toward it with a great company; then she sang--

BONDMAID:

It is vain things' beguilling  
That methinks I behold,  
Or the ending of all things,  
As ye ride, O ye dead men,  
Smiting with spurs  
Your horses' sides?  
Or may dead warriors  
Wend their ways homeward?

THE DEAD:

No vain things' beguiling  
Is that thou beholdest,  
Nor the ruin of all things;  
Though thou lookest upon us,  
Though we smite with spurs  
Our horses' sides;  
Rather dead warriors  
May wend their ways homeward.

Then went the bondmaid home, and told Sigrun, and sang--

BONDMAID:

Go out, Sigrun  
From Sevafell,  
If thou listest to look on  
The lord of thy people!  
For the mound is uncovered  
Thither is Helgi come,  
And his wounds are bleeding,  
But the king thee biddeth  
To come and stay  
That stream of sorrow.

So Sigrun went into the mound to Helgi, and sang--

SIGRUN:

Now am I as fain  
Of this fair meeting,  
As are the hungry  
Hawks of Odin,  
When they wot of the slaying  
Of the yet warm quarry,  
Or bright with dew  
See the day a-dawning.  
Ah, I will kiss  
My king laid lifeless,  
Ere thou castest by  
Thy blood-stained byrny.  
O Helgi, thy hair  
Is thick with death's rime,  
With the dew of the dead  
Is my love all dripping;  
Dead-cold are the hands  
Of the son of Hogni;  
How for thee, O my king,  
May I win healing?

HELGI:

Thou alone, Sigrun  
Of Sevafell,  
Hast so done that Helgi  
With grief's dew drippeth;  
O clad in gold  
Cruel tears thou weepest,  
Bright May of the Southlands,  
Or ever thou sleepest;  
Each tear in blood falleth  
On the breast of thy lord,  
Cold wet and bitter-sharp  
Swollen with sorrow.  
Ah, we shall drink  
Dear draughts and lovely,  
Though, we have lost  
Both life and lands;  
Neither shall any  
Sing song of sorrow,  
Though in my breast  
Be wounds wide to behold:  
For now are brides  
In the mound abiding;  
Kings' daughters sit  
By us departed.

Now Sigrun arrayed a bed in the mound, and sang--

SIGRUN:

Here, Helgi, for thee  
A bed have I dight,  
Kind without woe,  
O kin of the Ylfings!  
To thy bosom, O king,  
Will I come and sleep soft,  
As I was wont  
When my lord was living.

HELGI:

Now will I call  
Naught not to be hoped for  
Early or late  
At Sevafell,  
When thou in the arms  
Of a dead man art laid,  
White maiden of Hogni,  
Here in the mound:  
And thou yet quick,  
O King's daughter!  
Now needs must I ride  
On the reddening ways;  
My pale horse must tread  
The highway aloft;  
West must I go  
To Windhelm's bridge  
Ere the war-winning crowd  
Hall-crower \[4\] waketh.

So Helgi rode his ways: and the others gat them gone home to the house.
But the next night Sigrun bade the bondwoman have heed of the mound. So
at nightfall, thenas Sigrun came to the mound, she sang:

SIGRUN:

Here now would he come,  
If to come he were minded;  
Sigmund's offspring  
From the halls of Odin.  
O me the hope waneth  
Of Helgi's coming;  
For high on the ash-boughs  
Are the ernes abiding,  
And all folk drift  
Toward the Thing of the dreamland.

BONDMAID:

Be not foolish of heart,  
And fare all alone  
To the house of the dead,  
O Hero's daughter!  
For more strong and dreadful  
In the night season  
Are all dead warriors  
Than in the daylight.

But a little while lived Sigrun, because of her sorrow and trouble. But
in old time folk trowed that men should be born again, though their
troth be now deemed but an old wife's dotting. And so, as folk say,
Helgi and Sigrun were born again, and at that tide was he called Helgi
the Scathe of Hadding, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan; and she was
a Valkyrie, even as is said in the Lay of Kara.

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] Only that part of the song is given which completes the episodes
of Helgi Hunding's-bane; the earlier part of the song differs little
from the Saga.

\[2\] Hogni, the father of Dar and Sigrun, had been slain by Helgi in
battle, and Helgi had given peace to, and taken oaths of Dag.

\[3\] One of the rivers of the under-world.

\[4\] Hall-crower, "Salgofnir": lit. Hall-gaper, the cock of Valhall.
