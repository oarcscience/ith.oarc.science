<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">More Wise Words of Brynhild.</H2>
<P>Sigurd spake now, "Sure no wiser woman than thou art one may be found in the wide world; yea, yea, teach me more yet of thy wisdom!"</P>
<P>She answers, "Seemly is it that I do according to thy will, and show thee forth more redes of great avail, for thy prayer's sake and thy wisdom ;" and she spake withal--</P>
<P>"Be kindly to friend and kin, and reward not their trespasses against thee; bear and forbear, and win for thee thereby long enduring praise of men.</P>
<P>"Take good heed of evil things: a may's love, and a man's wife; full oft thereof doth ill befall!</P>
<P>"Let not thy mind be overmuch crossed by unwise men at thronged meetings of folk; for oft these speak worse than they wot of; lest thou be called a dastard, and art minded to think that thou art even as is said; slay such an one on another day, and so reward his ugly talk.</P>
<P>"If thou farest by the way whereas bide evil things, be well ware of thyself; take not harbour near the highway, though thou be benighted, for oft abide there ill wights for men's bewilderment.</P>
<P>"Let not fair women beguile thee, such as thou mayst meet at the feast, so that the thought thereof stand thee in stead of sleep, and a quiet mind; yea, draw them not to thee with kisses or other sweet things of love.</P>
<P>"If thou hearest the fool's word of a drunken man, strive not with him being drunk with drink and witless; many a grief, yea, and the very death, groweth from out such things.</P>
<P>"Fight thy foes in the field, nor be burnt in thine house.</P>
<P>'Never swear thou wrongsome oath; great and grim is the reward for the breaking of plighted troth.</P>
<P>"Give kind heed to dead men,--sick-dead, Sea-dead, or ~word-dead; deal heedfully with their dead corpses.</P>
<P>"Trow never in him for whom thou hast slain father, brother, or whatso near kin, yea, though young he be; 'for oft waxes wolf in youngling'.</P>
<P>"Look thou with good heed to the wiles of thy friends; but little skill is given to me, that I should foresee the ways of thy life; yet good it were that hate fell not on thee from those of thy wife's house."</P>
<P>Sigurd spake, "None among the sons of men can be found wiser than thou; and thereby swear I, that thee will I have as my own, for near to my heart thou liest."</P>
<P>She answers, "Thee would I fainest choose, though I had all men's sons to choose from."</P>
<P>And thereto they plighted troth both of them.</P>
