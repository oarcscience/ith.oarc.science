# THE WHETTING OF GUDRUN.

Gudrun went down unto the sea whenas she had slain Atli, and she cast
herself therein, for she was fain to end her life: but nowise might she
drown. She drave over the firths to the land of King Jonakr, and he
wedded her, and their sons were Sorli, and Erp, and Hamdir, and there
was Swanhild, Sigurd's daughter, nourished: and she was given to
Jormunrek the Mighty. Now Bikki was a man of his, and gave such counsel
to Randver, the king's son, as that he should take her; and with that
counsel were the young folk well content.

Then Bikki told the king, and the king let hang Randver, but bade
Swanhild be trodden under horses' feet. But when Gudrun heard thereof,
she spake to her sons--

Words of strife heard I,  
Huger than any,  
Woeful words spoken,  
Sprung from all sorrow,  
When Gudrun fierce-hearted  
With the grimmest of words  
Whetter her sons  
Unto the slaying.  
"Why are ye sitting here?  
Why sleep ye life away?  
Why doth it grieve you nought?  
Glad words to speak,  
Now when your sister--  
Young of years was she--  
Has Jormunrek trodden  
With the treading of horses?--  
"Black horses and white  
In the highway of warriors;  
Grey horses that know  
The roads of the Goths.--  
"Little like are ye grown  
To that Gunnar of old days!  
Nought are your hearts  
As the heart of Hogni!  
Well would ye seek  
Vengeance to win  
If your mood were in aught  
As the mood of my brethren,  
Or the hardy hearts  
Of the Kings of the Huns!"  
Then spake Hamdir,  
The high-hearted--  
"Little didst thou  
Praise Hogni's doings,  
When Sigurd woke  
From out of sleep,  
And the blue-white bed-gear  
Upon thy bed  
Grew red with man's blood--  
With the blood of thy mate!  
"Too baleful vengeance  
Wroughtest thou for thy brethren  
Most sore and evil  
When thy sons thou slewedst,  
Else all we together  
On Jormunrek  
Had wrought sore vengeance  
For that our sister.  
"Come, bring forth quickly  
The Hun kings' bright gear,  
Since thou has urged us  
Unto the sword-Thing!"  
Laughing went Gudrun  
To the bower of good gear,  
Kings' crested helms  
From chests she drew,  
And wide-wrought byrnies  
Bore to her sons:  
Then on their horses  
Load laid the heroes.  
Then spake Hamdir,  
The high-hearted--  
"Never cometh again  
His mother to see  
The spear-god laid low  
In the land of the Goths.  
That one arvel mayst thou  
For all of us drink,  
For sister Swanhild,  
And us thy sons."  
Greeted Gudrun  
Giuki's daughter;  
Sorrowing she went  
In the forecourt to sit,  
That she might tell,  
With cheeks tear-furrowed,  
Her weary wail  
In many a wise.  
"Three fires I knew,  
Three hearths I knew,  
To three husbands' houses  
Have I been carried;  
And better than all  
Had been Sigurd alone,  
He whom my brethren  
Brought to his bane.  
"Such sore grief as that  
Methought never should be,  
Yet more indeed  
Was left for my torment  
Then, when the great ones  
Gave me to Atli.  
"My fair bright boys  
I bade unto speech,  
Nor yet might I win  
Weregild for my bale,  
Ere I had hewn off  
Those Niblungs' heads.  
"To the sea-strand I went  
With the Norns sorely wroth,  
For I would thrust from me  
The storm of their torment;  
But the high billows  
Would not drown, but bore me  
Forth, till I stepped a-land  
Longer to live.  
"Then I went a-bed--  
Ah, better in the old days,  
This was the third time!--  
To a king of the people;  
Offspring I brought forth,  
Props of a fair house,  
Props of a fair house,  
Jonakr's fair sons.  
"But around Swanhild  
Bond-maidens sat,  
Her, that of all mine  
Most to my heart was;  
Such was my Swanhild,  
In my hall's midmost,  
As is the sunbeam  
Fair to beheld.  
"In gold I arrayed her,  
And goodly raiment,  
Or ever I gave her  
To the folk of the Goths.  
That was the hardest  
Of my heavy woes,  
When the bright hair,--  
O the bright hair of Swanhild!--  
In the mire was trodden  
By the treading of horses.  
"This was the sorest,  
When my love, my Sigurd,  
Reft of glory  
In his bed gat ending:  
But this the grimmest  
When glittering worms  
Tore their way  
Through the heart of Gunnar.  
"But this the keenest  
When they cut to the quick  
Of the hardy heart  
Of the unfeared Hogni.  
Of much of bale I mind me,  
Of many griefs I mind me;  
Why should I sit abiding  
Yet more bale and more?  
"Thy coal-black horse,  
O Sigurd, bridle,  
The swift on the highway!  
O let him speed hither!  
Here sitteth no longer  
Son or daughter,  
More good gifts  
To give to Gudrun!  
"Mindst thou not, Sigurd,  
Of the speech betwixt us,  
When on one bed  
We both sat together,  
O my great king--  
That thou wouldst come to me  
E'en from the hall of Hell,  
I to thee from the fair earth?  
"Pile high, O earls  
The oaken pile,  
Let it be the highest  
That ever queen had!  
Let the fire burn swift,  
My breast with woe laden,  
And thaw all my heart,  
Hard, heavy with sorrow!"  
Now may all earls  
Be bettered in mind,  
May the grief of all maidens  
Ever be minished,  
For this tale of sorrow  
So told to its ending.
