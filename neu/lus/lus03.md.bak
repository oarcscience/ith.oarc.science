### DISSERTATION ON THE LUSIAD, AND ON EPIC POETRY,

#### BY THE TRANSLATOR.

WHEN Voltaire was in England, previous to his publication of his
Henriade, he published in English an essay on the epic poetry of the
European nations. In this he both highly praised, and severely attacked,
the Lusiad. In his French editions of this essay, he has made various
alterations, at different times, in the article on Camoëns. It is not,
however, improper to premise, that some most amazing falsities will be
here detected; the gross misrepresentation of every objection refuted;
and demonstration brought, that when Voltaire wrote his English essay,
his knowledge of the Lusiad was entirely borrowed from the bold, harsh,
unpoetical version of Fanshaw.

"While Trissino," says Voltaire, "was clearing away the rubbish in
Italy, which barbarity and ignorance had heaped up for ten centuries in
the way of the arts and sciences, Camoëns, in Portugal, steered a new
course, and acquired a reputation which lasts still among his countrymen
who pay as much respect to his memory as the English to Milton."

Among other passages of the Lusiad which he criticises is that where
"Adamastor, the giant of the Cape of Storms, appears to them, walking in
the depth of the sea; his head reaches to the clouds; the storms, the
winds, the thunders, and the lightnings hang about him; his arms are
extended over the waves. It is the guardian of that foreign ocean,
unploughed before by any ship. He complains of being obliged to submit
to fate, and to the audacious undertaking of the Portuguese, and
foretells them all the misfortunes they must undergo in the Indies. I
believe

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

that such a fiction would be thought noble and proper in all ages, and
in all nations.

"There is another, which perhaps would have pleased the Italians as well
as the Portuguese, but no other nation besides: it is the enchanted
island, called the Island of Bliss, which the fleet finds in its way
home, just rising from the sea, for their comfort, and for their reward.
Camoëns describes that place, as Tasso some years after depicted his
island of Armida. There a supernatural power brings in all the beauties,
and presents all the pleasures which nature can afford, and the heart
may wish for; a goddess, enamoured with Vasco de Gama, carries him to
the top of a high mountain, from whence she shows him all the kingdoms
of the earth, and foretells the fate of Portugal.

"After Camoëns hath given loose to his fancy, in the description of the
pleasures which Gama and his crew enjoyed in the island, he takes care
to inform the reader that he ought to understand by this fiction nothing
but the satisfaction which the virtuous man feels, and the glory which
accrues to him, by the practice of virtue; but the best excuse for such
an invention is the charming style in which it is delivered (if we may
believe the Portuguese), for the beauty of the elocution sometimes makes
amends for the faults of the poet, as the colouring of Rubens makes some
defects in his figures pass unregarded.

"There is *another* kind of machinery continued throughout all the poem,
which nothing can excuse; that is, an injudicious mixture of the heathen
gods with our religion. Gama in a storm addresses his prayers to Christ,
but it is Venus who comes to his relief; the heroes are Christians, and
the poet heathen. The main design which the Portuguese are supposed to
have (next to promoting their trade) is to propagate Christianity; yet
Jupiter, Bacchus, and Venus, have in their hands all the management of
the voyage. So incongruous a machinery casts a blemish upon the whole
poem; yet it shows at the same time how prevailing are its beauties
since the Portuguese like it with all its faults."

The Lusiad, says Voltaire, contains "a sort of epic poetry unheard of
before. No heroes are wounded a thousand different ways; no woman
enticed away, and the world overturned for her cause." But the very want
of these, in place of supporting the objection intended by Voltaire,
points out the happy judgment and peculiar excellence of Camoëns. If
Homer has given us all the fire and hurry of battles, he has also given
us all the uninteresting, tiresome

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

detail. What reader but must be tired with the deaths of a thousand
heroes, who are never mentioned before, nor afterwards, in the poem.
Yet, in every battle we are wearied out with such *Gazette*-returns of
the slain and wounded as--

"Hector Priamides when Zeus him glory gave,  
Assæus first, Autonoüs, he slew;  
Ophites, Dolops, Klytis’ son beside;  
Opheltius also, Agelaüs too,  
Æsymnus, and the battle-bide  
Hippónoüs, chiefs on Danaian side,  
And then the multitude."  
   HOMER’S Iliad, bk. xi. 299, et seq.,  
                     (W. G. T. BARTER’S translation.)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And corresponding
to it is Virgil’s Æneid, bk. x. line 747, et seq.:--

"By Cædicus Alcathoüs was slain;  
Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;  
Orsès the strong to greater strength must yield,  
He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo killed.  
Then brave Messapus Ericetès slew,  
Who from Lycaón’s blood his lineage drew."  
                                             DRYDEN’S version.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With such
catalogues is every battle extended; and what can be more tiresome than
such uninteresting descriptions, and their imitations! If the idea of
the battle be raised by such enumeration, still the copy and original
are so near each other that they can never please in two separate poems.
Nor are the greater part of the battles of the Æneid much more distant
than those of the Iliad. Though Virgil with great art has introduced a
Camilla, a Pallas, and a Lausus, still, in many particulars, and in the
action upon the whole, there is such a sameness with the Iliad, that the
learned reader of the Æneid is deprived of the pleasure inspired by
originality. If the man of taste, however, will be pleased to mark how
the genius of a Virgil has managed a war after Homer, he will certainly
be tired with a dozen epic poems in the same style. Where the siege of a
town and battles are the subject of an epic, there will, of necessity,
in the characters and circumstances, be a resemblance to Homer; and such
poem must therefore want originality. Happily for Tasso, the variation
of manners, and his

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

masterly superiority over Homer in describing his duels, has given to
his Jerusalem an air of novelty. Yet, with all the difference between
Christian and pagan heroes, we have a Priam, an Agamemnon, an Achilles,
etc., armies slaughtered, and a city besieged. In a word, we have a
handsome copy of the Iliad in the Jerusalem Delivered. If some
imitations, however, have been successful, how many other epics of
ancient and modern times have hurried down the stream of oblivion! Some
of their authors had poetical merit, but the fault was in the choice of
their subjects. So fully is the strife of war exhausted by Homer, that
Virgil and Tasso could add to it but little novelty; no wonder,
therefore, that so many epics on battles and sieges have been suffered
to sink into utter neglect. Camoëns, perhaps, did not weigh these
circumstances, but the strength of his poetical genius directed him. He
could not but feel what it was to read Virgil after Homer; and the
original turn and force of his mind led him from the beaten track of
Helen’s and Lavinia’s, Achilles’s and Hector’s sieges and slaughters,
where the hero hews down, and drives to flight, whole armies with his
own sword. Camoëns was the first who wooed the modern Epic Muse, and she
gave him the wreath of a first lover: a sort of epic poetry unheard of
before; or, as Voltaire calls it, *une nouvelle espèce d’epopée*; and
the grandest subject it is (of profane history) which the world has ever
beheld. <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) A voyage esteemed too great
for man to dare; the adventures of this voyage through unknown oceans
deemed unnavigable; the eastern world happily discovered, and for ever
indissolubly joined and given to the western; the grand Portuguese
empire in the East founded; the humanization of mankind, and universal
commerce the consequence! What are the adventures of an old, fabulous
hero’s arrival in Britain, what are Greece and Latium in arms for a
woman compared to this! Troy is in ashes, and even the Roman empire is
no more. But

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

the effects of the voyage, adventures, and bravery of the hero of the
Lusiad will be felt and beheld, and perhaps increase in importance,
while the world shall remain.

Happy in his choice, happy also was the genius of Camoëns in the method
of pursuing his subject. He has not, like Tasso, given it a total
appearance of fiction; nor has he, like Lucan, excluded allegory and
poetical machinery. Whether he intended it or not (for his genius was
sufficient to suggest its propriety), the judicious precept of
Petronius <span id="fr_14"></span>[\*](#fn_14.md) is the model of the
Lusiad. That elegant writer proposes a poem on the civil war, and no
poem, ancient or modern, merits the character there sketched out in any
degree comparative to the Lusiad. A truth of history is preserved; yet,
what is improper for the historian, the ministry of Heaven is employed,
and the free spirit of poetry throws itself into fictions which makes
the whole appear as an effusion of prophetic fury, and not like a rigid
detail of facts, given under the sanction of witnesses. Contrary to
Lucan, who, in the above rules, drawn from the nature of poetry, is
severely condemned by Petronius, Camoëns conducts his poem *per ambages
Deorumque ministeria*. The apparition, which in the night hovers athwart
the fleet near the Cape of Good Hope, is the grandest fiction in human
composition; the invention his own! In the Island of Venus, the use of
which fiction in an epic poem is also his own, he has given the
completest assemblage of all the flowers which have ever adorned the
bowers of love. And, never was the *furentis animi vaticinatio* more
conspicuously displayed than in the prophetic song, the view of the
spheres, and the globe of the earth. Tasso’s imitation of the Island of
Venus is not equal to the original; and, though "Virgil’s myrtles <span
id="fr_15"></span>[†](#fn_15.md) dropping blood are nothing to Tasso’s
enchanted forest," what are all Ismeno’s enchantments to the grandeur
and horror of the appearance, prophecy, and vanishment of the spectre of
Camoëns! <span id="fr_16"></span>[‡](#fn_16.md) It has long been agreed
among critics, that the solemnity of religious observances gives great
dignity to the historical narrative of epic poetry. Camoëns, in the
embarkation of the fleet, and in several other places, is peculiarly
happy in the

<span id="page_xxx">p. xxx</span>

dignity of religion’s allusions. Manners and character are also required
in the epic poem. But all the epics which have appeared are, except two;
mere copies of the Iliad in these respects. Every one has its Agamemnon,
Achilles, Ajax, and Ulysses; its calm, furious, gross, and intelligent
hero. Camoëns and Milton happily left this beaten track, this exhausted
field, and have given us pictures of manners unknown in the Iliad, the
Æneid, and all those poems which may be classed with the Thebaid. The
Lusiad abounds with pictures of manners, from those of the highest
chivalry to those of the rudest, fiercest, and most innocent barbarism.
In the fifth, sixth, and ninth books, Leonardo and Veloso are painted in
stronger colours than any of the inferior characters in Virgil. But
*character*, indeed, is not the excellence of the Æneid. That of
Monzaida, the friend of Gama, is much superior to that of Achates. The
base, selfish, perfidious and cruel character of the Zamorim and the
Moors, are painted in the strongest colours; and the character of Gama
himself is that of the finished hero. His cool command of his passions,
his deep sagacity, his fixed intrepidity, his tenderness of heart, his
manly piety, and his high enthusiasm in the love of his country are all
displayed in the superlative degree. Let him who objects the want of
character to the Lusiad, beware lest he stumble upon its praise; lest he
only say, it wants an Achilles, a Hector, and a Priam. And, to the
novelty of the manners of the Lusiad let the novelty of fire-arms also
be added. It has been said that the buckler, the bow, and the spear,
must continue the arms of poetry. Yet, however unsuccessful others may
have been, Camoëns has proved that firearms may be introduced with the
greatest dignity, and the finest effect in the epic poem.

As the grand interest of commerce and of mankind forms the subject of
the Lusiad, so, with great propriety, as necessary accompaniments to the
voyage of his hero, the author has given poetical pictures of the four
parts of the world--in the third book a view of Europe; in the fifth, a
view of Africa; and in the tenth, a picture of Asia and America. Homer
and Virgil have been highly praised for their judgment in the choice of
subjects which interested their countrymen, and Statius has been as
severely condemned for his uninteresting choice. But, though the subject
of Camoëns be particularly interesting to his own countrymen, it has
also the peculiar happiness to be the poem of every trading nation. It
is the epic poem of the birth of commerce,

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

and, in a particular manner, the epic poem of whatever country has the
control and possession of the commerce of India. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[\*](#fn_17.md)

An unexhausted fertility and variety of poetical description, an
unexhausted elevation of sentiment, and a constant tenor of the grand
simplicity of diction, complete the character of the Lusiad of Camoëns:
a poem which, though it has hitherto received from the public most
unmerited neglect, and from the critics most flagrant injustice, was yet
better understood by the greatest poet of Italy. Tasso never did his
judgment more credit than when he confessed that he dreaded Camoëns as a
rival; or his generosity more honour than when he addressed the elegant
sonnet to the hero of the Lusiad, commencing--

Vasco, le cui felici, ardite antenne  
In contro al sol, the ne riporta il giorno."

It only remains to give some account of the version of the Lusiad which
is now offered to the public. Beside the translations mentioned in the
life of Camoëns, M. Duperron De Castera, in 1735, gave, in French prose,
a loose unpoetical paraphrase <span id="fr_18"></span>[†](#fn_18.md) of the
Lusiad. Nor does Sir Richard Fanshaw’s English version, published during
the usurpation of Cromwell, merit a better character. Though stanza be
rendered for stanza, though at first view it has the appearance of being
exceedingly literal, this version is nevertheless exceedingly
unfaithful. Uncountenanced by his original, Fanshaw--

"Teems with many a dead-born jest." <span id="fr_19"></span>[‡](#fn_19.md)

Nor had he the least idea of the dignity of the epic style, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[§](#fn_20.md) or of

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

the true spirit of poetical translation. For this, indeed, no definite
rule can be given. The translator’s feelings alone must direct him, for
the spirit of poetry is sure to evaporate in literal translation.

Indeed, literal translation of poetry is a solecism. You may construe
your author, indeed, but, if with some translators you boast that you
have left your author to speak for himself, that you have neither added
nor diminished, you have in reality grossly abused him, and deceived
yourself. Your literal translation can have no claim to the original
’felicities of expression; the energy, elegance, and fire of the
original poetry. It may bear, indeed, a resemblance; but such a one as a
corpse in the sepulchre bears to the former man when he moved in the
bloom and vigour of life.

*Nec verbum verbo curable reddere, fidus  
Interpres*,

was the taste of the Augustan age. None but a poet can translate a poet.
The freedom which this precept gives, will, therefore, in a poet’s
hands, not only infuse the energy, elegance, and fire of his author’s
poetry into his own version, but will give it also the spirit of an
original.

He who can construe may perform all that is claimed by the literal
translator. He who attempts the manner of translation prescribed by
Horace, ventures upon a task of genius. Yet, however daring the
undertaking, and however he may have failed in it, the translator
acknowledges, that in this spirit he has endeavoured to give the Lusiad
in English. Even farther liberties, in one or two instances, seemed to
him advantageous------But a minuteness <span
id="fr_21"></span>[\*](#fn_21.md) in

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

the mention of these will not appear with a good grace in this edition
of his work; and besides, the original is in the hands of the world.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[xxviii:\*](lus03.htm#fr_13.md) The drama and the
epopœia are in nothing so different as in this--the subjects of the
drama are inexhaustible, those of the epopœia are perhaps exhausted. He
who chooses war, and warlike characters, cannot appear as an original.
It was well for the memory of Pope that he did not write the epic poem
he intended. It would have been only a copy of Virgil. Camoëns and
Milton have been happy in the novelty of their subjects, and these they
have exhausted. There cannot possibly be so important a voyage as that
which gave the eastern world to the western. And, did even the story of
Columbus afford materials equal to that of Gama, the adventures of the
hero, and the view of the extent of his discoveries must now appear as
servile copies of the Lusiad.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[xxix:\*](lus03.htm#fr_14.md) See his
Satyricon.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[xxix:†](lus03.htm#fr_15.md) See letters on
Chivalry and Romance.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[xxix:‡](lus03.htm#fr_16.md) The Lusiad is also
rendered poetical by other fictions. The elegant satire on King
Sebastian, under the name of Acteon; and the prosopopœia of the populace
of Portugal venting their murmurs upon the beach when Gama sets sail,
display the richness of our author’s poetical genius, and are not
inferior to anything of the kind in the classics.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[xxxi:\*](lus03.htm#fr_17.md) Hence the great
interest which we as Britons either do, or ought to, feel in this noble
epic. We are the successors of the Portuguese in the possession and
government of India; and therefore what interested them must have for
us, as the actual possessors, a double interest.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[xxxi:†](lus03.htm#fr_18.md) Castera was every way
unequal to his task. He did not perceive his author’s beauties. He
either suppresses or lowers the most poetical passages, and substitutes
French tinsel and impertinence in their place.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[xxxi:‡](lus03.htm#fr_19.md) Pope, Odyss. xx.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[xxxi:§](lus03.htm#fr_20.md) Richard Fanshaw, Esq.,
afterwards Sir Richard, was English Ambassador both at Madrid and
Lisbon. He had a taste for literature, and translated from the Italian
several pieces which were of service in the refinement of our poetry.
Though his Lusiad, by the dedication of it to William, Earl of
Strafford, dated May 1, 1655, seems as if published by himself, we are
told by the editor of his Letters, that "during the unsettled times of
our anarchy, some of his MSS., falling by misfortune into unskilful
<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span> hands, were printed and published
without his knowledge or consent, and before he could give them his last
finishing strokes: such was his translation of the Lusiad." He can never
have enough of conceits, low allusions, and expressions. When gathering
of flowers is simply mentioned (C. 9, st. 24) he gives it, "gather’d
flowers by pecks;" and the Indian Regent is avaricious (C. 8, st. 95)--

*Meaning a better penny thence to get*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But enough of
these have already appeared in the notes. It may be necessary to add,
that the version of Fanshaw, though the Lusiad very particularly
requires them, was given to the public without one note.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[xxxii:\*](lus03.htm#fr_21.md) Some liberties of a
less poetical kind, however, require to be mentioned. In Homer and
Virgil’s lists of slain warriors, Dryden and Pope have omitted several
names which would have rendered English versification <span
id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span> dull and tiresome. Several allusions
to ancient history and fable have for this reason been abridged; e.g. in
the prayer of GAMA (Book 6) the mention of Paul, "thou who deliveredst
Paul and defendest him from quicksands and wild waves--

*Das scyrtes arenosas e ondas feas*--"

is omitted. However excellent in the original, the prayer in English
would lose both its dignity and ardour. Nor let the critic, if he find
the meaning of Camoëns in some instances altered, imagine that he has
found a blunder in the translator. He who chooses to see a slight
alteration of this kind will find an instance, which will give him an
idea of others, in Canto 8, st. 48, and another in Canto 7, st. 41. It
was not to gratify the dull few, whose greatest pleasure in reading a
translation is to see what the author exactly says; it was to give a
poem that might live in the English language, which was the ambition of
the translator. And, for the same reason, he has not confined himself to
the Portuguese or Spanish pronunciation of proper names. Regardless,
therefore, of Spanish pronunciation, the translator has accented
Granáda, Evóra, etc. in the manner which seemed to him to give most
dignity to English versification. In the word Sofala he has even
rejected the authority of Milton, and followed the more sonorous usage
of Fanshaw. Thus Sir Richard: "Against Sofála’s batter’d fort." Which is
the more sonorous there can be no dispute.
