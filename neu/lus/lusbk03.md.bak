### BOOK III.

#### THE ARGUMENT.

Gama, in reply to the King of Melinda, describes the various countries
of Europe; narrates the rise of the Portuguese nation. History of
Portugal. Battle of Guimaraens. Egas offers himself with his wife and
family for the honour of his country. Alonzo pardons him. Battle of
Ourique against the Moors; great slaughter of the Moors. Alonzo
proclaimed King of Portugal on the battle-field of Ourique. At Badajoz
he is wounded and taken prisoner: resigns the kingdom to his son, Don
Sancho. Hearing that thirteen Moorish kings, headed by the Emperor of
Morocco, were besieging Sancho in Santarem, he hastens to deliver his
son: gains a great battle, in which the Moorish Emperor is slain.
Victories of Sancho; capture of Sylves from [the](errata.htm#2.md) Moors,
and of Tui from the King of Leon. Conquest of Alcazar do Sul by Alfonso
II. Deposition of Sancho II. Is succeeded by Alphonso III., the
conqueror of Algarve; succeeded by Dionysius, founder of the University
of Coimbra. His son, Alfonso the Brave. Affecting story of the fair
Inez, who is crowned Queen of Portugal after her assassination. Don
Pedro, her husband, rendered desperate by the loss of his mistress, is
succeeded by the weak and effeminate Ferdinand. His wife Eleonora, torn
from the arms of her lawful husband, dishonours his reign.

OH now, Calliope, thy potent aid!  
What to the king th’ illustrious GAMA said  
Clothe in immortal verse. With sacred fire  
My breast, if e’er it loved thy lore, inspire:  
So may the patron <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) of the healing
art,  
The god of day to thee consign his heart;

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

From thee, the mother of his darling son, <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_175.md)  
May never wand’ring thought to Daphne run:  
May never Clytia, nor Leucothoë’s pride  
Henceforth with thee his changeful love divide.  
Then aid, O fairest nymph, my fond desire,  
And give my verse the Lusian warlike fire:  
Fir’d by the song, the list’ning world shall know  
That Aganippe’s streams from Tagus flow.  
Oh, let no more the flowers of Pindus shine  
On thy fair breast, or round thy temples twine:  
On Tago’s banks a richer chaplet blows,  
And with the tuneful god my bosom glows:  
I feel, I feel the mighty power infuse,  
And bathe my spirit in Aonian <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_176.md)
dews!

  Now silence woo’d the illustrious chief’s reply,  
And keen attention watch’d on every eye;  
When slowly turning with a modest grace,  
The noble VASCO rais’d his manly face;  
O mighty king (he cries), at thy <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_177.md)
command  
The martial story of my native land  
I tell; but more my doubtful heart had joy’d  
Had other wars my praiseful lips employ’d.  
When men the honours of their race commend,  
The doubts of strangers on the tale attend:  
Yet, though reluctance falter on my tongue,  
Though day would sail a narrative so long,  
Yet, well assur’d no fiction’s glare can raise,  
Or give my country’s fame a brighter praise;

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Though less, far less, whate’er my lips can say,  
Than truth must give it, I thy will obey.

  Between that zone where endless winter reigns  
And that where flaming beat consumes the plains;  
Array’d in green, beneath indulgent skies,  
The queen of arts and arms, fair Europe lies.  
Around her northern and her western shores,  
Throng’d with the finny race old ocean roars;  
The midland sea, <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_178.md) where tide ne’er
swell’d the waves,  
Her richest lawns, the southern border, laves.  
Against the rising morn, the northmost bound  
The whirling Tanais <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_179.md) parts from
Asian ground,  
As tumbling from the Scythian mountains cold  
Their crooked way the rapid waters hold  
To dull Mæotis’ <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_180.md) lake. Her eastern
line  
More to the south, the Phrygian waves confine:  
Those waves, which, black with many a navy, bore  
The Grecian heroes to the Dardan shore;  
Where now the seaman, rapt in mournful joy,  
Explores in vain the sad remains of Troy.  
Wide to the north beneath ’the pole she spreads;  
Here piles of mountains rear their rugged heads,  
Here winds on winds in endless tempests roll,  
The valleys sigh, the length’ning echoes howl.  
On the rude cliffs, with frosty spangles grey,  
Weak as the twilight, gleams the solar ray;  
Each mountain’s breast with snows eternal shines,  
The streams and seas eternal frost confines.  
Here dwelt the num’rous Scythian tribes of old,  
A dreadful race! by victor ne’er controll’d,  
Whose pride maintain’d that theirs the sacred earth,  
Not that of Nile, which first gave man his birth.  
Here dismal Lapland spreads a dreary wild,  
Here Norway’s wastes, where harvest never smil’d,  
Whose groves of fir in gloomy horror frown,  
Nod o’er the rocks, and to the tempest groan.  
Here Scandia’s clime her rugged shores extends,  
And, far projected, through the ocean bends;

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Whose sons’ dread footsteps yet Ansonia <span
id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_181.md) wears,  
And yet proud Rome in mournful ruin bears.  
When summer bursts stern winter’s icy chain,  
Here the bold Swede, the Prussian, and the Dane  
Hoist the white sail and plough the foamy way,  
Cheer’d by whole months of one continual day:  
Between these shores and Tanais’ <span id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_182.md)
rushing tide  
Livonia’s sons and Russia’s hordes reside.  
Stern as their clime the tribes, whose sires of yore  
The name, far dreaded, of Sarmatians bore.  
Where, fam’d of old, th’ Hercynian <span id="fr_185"></span>[3](#fn_183.md)
forest lower’d,  
Oft seen in arms the Polish troops are pour’d  
Wide foraging the downs. The Saxon race,  
The Hungar dext’rous in the wild-boar chase,  
The various nations whom the Rhine’s cold wave  
The Elbe, Amasis, and the Danube lave,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

Of various tongues, for various princes known,  
Their mighty lord the German emperor own.  
Between the Danube and the lucid tide  
Where hapless Helle left her name, <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_185.md)
and died:  
The dreadful god of battles’ kindred race,  
Degenerate now, possess the hills of Thrace.  
Mount Hæmus <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_186.md) here, and Rhodope
renown’d,  
And proud Byzantium, <span id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_187.md) long with
empire crown’d;  
Their ancient pride, their ancient virtue fled,  
Low to the Turk now bend the servile head.  
Here spread the fields of warlike Macedon,  
And here those happy lands where genius shone  
In all the arts, in all the Muses’ charms,  
In all the pride of elegance and arms,  
Which to the heavens resounded Grecia’s name,  
And left in every age a deathless fame.  
The stern Dalmatians till the neighb’ring ground;  
And where Antenor anchor’d in the sound  
Proud Venice, as a queen, majestic towers,  
And o’er the trembling waves her thunder pours.  
For learning glorious, glorious for the sword,  
While Rome’s proud monarch reign’d the world’s dread lord,  
Here Italy her beauteous landscapes shows;  
Around her sides his arms old ocean throws;  
The dashing waves the ramparts aid supply;  
The hoary Alps high tow’ring to the sky,  
From shore to shore a rugged barrier spread,  
And lower destruction on the hostile tread.  
But now no more her hostile spirit burns,  
There now the saint, in humble vespers mourns  
To Heaven more grateful than the pride of war,  
And all the triumphs of the victor’s car.  
Onward fair Gallia opens to the view  
Her groves of olive, and her vineyards blue:  
Wide spread her harvests o’er the scenes renown’d,  
Where Julius <span id="fr_190"></span>[4](#fn_188.md) proudly strode with
laurel crown’d.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

Here Seine, how fair when glist’ning to the moon!  
Rolls his white wave, and here the cold Garcon;  
Here the deep Rhine the flow’ry margin laves,  
And here the rapid Rhone impervious raves.  
Here the gruff mountains, faithless to the vows  
Of lost Pyrene <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_189.md) rear their cloudy
brows;  
Whence, when of old the flames their woods devour’d,  
Streams of red gold and melted silver pour’d.  
And now, as head of all the lordly train  
Of Europe’s realms, appears illustrious Spain.  
Alas, what various fortunes has she known!  
Yet ever did her sons her wrongs atone;  
Short was the triumph of her haughty foes,  
And still with fairer bloom her honours rose.  
Where, lock’d with land, the struggling currents boil  
Fam’d for the godlike Theban’s latest toil, <span
id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_190.md)  
Against one coast the Punic strand extends,  
Around her breast the midland ocean bends,  
Around her shores two various oceans swell,  
And various nations in her bosom dwell.  
Such deeds of valour dignify their names,  
Each the imperial right of honour claims.  
Proud Aragon, who twice her standard rear’d  
In conquer’d Naples; and for art rever’d,  
Galicia’s prudent sons; the fierce Navarre,  
And he far dreaded in the Moorish war,  
The bold Asturian; nor Sevilia’s race,  
Nor thine, Granada, claim the second place.  
Here too the heroes who command the plain  
By Betis <span id="fr_193"></span>[3](#fn_191.md) water’d; here the pride
of Spain,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

The brave Castilian pauses o’er his sword,  
His country’s dread deliverer and lord.  
Proud o’er the rest, with splendid wealth array’d,  
As crown to this wide empire, Europe’s head,  
Fair Lusitania smiles, the western bound,  
Whose verdant breast the rolling waves surround,  
Where gentle evening pours her lambent ray,  
The last pale gleaming of departing day;  
This, this, O mighty king, the sacred earth,  
This the loved parent-soil that gave me birth.  
And oh, would bounteous Heaven my prayer regard,  
And fair success my perilous toils reward,  
May that dear land my latest breath receive,  
And give my weary bones a peaceful grave.

  Sublime the honours of my native land,  
And high in Heaven’s regard her heroes stand;  
By Heaven’s decree ’twas theirs the first to quell  
The Moorish tyrants, and from Spain expel;  
Nor could their burning wilds conceal their flight,  
Their burning wilds confess’d the Lusian might.  
From Lusus famed, whose honour’d name we bear,  
(The son of Bacchus or the bold compeer),  
The glorious name of Lusitania rose,  
A name tremendous to the Roman foes,  
When her bold troops the valiant shepherd <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) led,  
And foul with rout the Roman eagles fled;  
When haughty Rome achiev’d the treach’rous blow,  
That own’d her terror of the matchless foe. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_193.md)  
But, when no more her Viriatus fought,  
Age after age her deeper thraldom brought;  
Her broken sons by ruthless tyrants spurn’d,  
Her vineyards languish’d, and her pastures mourn’d;  
Till time revolving rais’d her drooping head,  
And o’er the wond’ring world her conquests spread.  
Thus rose her power: the lands of lordly Spain  
Were now the brave Alonzo’s wide domain;  
Great were his honours in the bloody fight,  
And Fame proclaim’d him champion of the right.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

And oft the groaning Saracen’s <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_194.md)
proud crest  
And shatter’d mail his awful force confess’d.  
From Calpe’s summits to the Caspian shore  
Loud-tongued renown his godlike actions bore.  
And many a chief from distant regions <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) came  
To share the laurels of Alonzo’s fame;  
Yet, more for holy Faith’s unspotted cause  
Their spears they wielded, than for Fame’s applause.  
Great were the deeds their thund’ring arms display’d,  
And still their foremost swords the battle sway’d.  
And now to honour with distinguish’d meed  
Each hero’s worth the gen’rous king decreed.  
The first and bravest of the foreign bands  
Hungaria’s younger son, brave Henry <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_196.md) stands.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

To him are given the fields where Tagus flows,  
And the glad king his daughter’s hand bestows;  
The fair Teresa shines his blooming bride,  
And owns her father’s love, and Henry’s pride.  
With her, besides, the sire confirms in dower  
Whate’er his sword might rescue from the Moor;  
And soon on Hagar’s race <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) the hero
pours  
His warlike fury--soon the vanquish’d Moors  
To him far round the neighb’ring lands resign,  
And Heaven rewards him with a glorious line.  
To him is born, Heaven’s gift, a gallant son,  
The glorious founder of the Lusian throne.  
Nor Spain’s wide lands alone his deeds attest,  
Deliver’d Judah Henry’s might <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_198.md)
confess’d  
On Jordan’s bank the victor-hero strode,  
Whose hallow’d waters bath’d the Saviour-God;  
And Salem’s <span id="fr_201"></span>[3](#fn_199.md) gate her open folds
display’d,  
When Godfrey <span id="fr_202"></span>[4](#fn_200.md) conquer’d by the
hero’s aid.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

But now no more in tented fields oppos’d,  
By Tagus’ stream his honour’d age lie clos’d;  
Yet still his dauntless worth, his virtue lived,  
And all the father in the son survived.  
And soon his worth was prov’d, the parent dame  
Avow’d a second hymeneal flame. <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_201.md)  
The low-born spouse assumes the monarch’s place,  
And from the throne expels the orphan race.  
But young Alphonso, like his sires of yore  
(His grandsire’s virtues, as his name, he bore),  
Arms for the fight, his ravish’d throne to win;  
And the lac’d helmet grasps his beardless chin.  
Her fiercest firebrands Civil Discord wav’d,  
Before her troops the lustful mother rav’d;  
Lost to maternal love, and lost to shame,  
Unaw’d she saw Heaven’s awful vengeance flame;  
The brother’s sword the brother’s bosom tore,  
And sad Guimaria’s <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_202.md) meadows blush’d
with gore;  
With Lusian gore the peasant’s cot was stain’d,  
And kindred blood the sacred shrine profan’d.

  Here, cruel Progne, here, O Jason’s wife,  
Yet reeking with your children’s purple life,  
Here glut your eyes with deeper guilt than yours;  
Here fiercer rage her fiercer rancour pours.  
Your crime was vengeance on the faithless sires,  
But here ambition with foul lust conspires.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

’Twas rage of love, O Scylla, urged the knife <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)  
That robb’d thy father of his fated life;  
Here grosser rage the mother’s breast inflames,  
And at her guiltless son the vengeance aims,  
But aims in vain; her slaughter’d forces yield,  
And the brave youth rides victor o’er the field.  
No more his subjects lift the thirsty sword,  
And the glad realm proclaims the youthful lord.  
But ah, how wild the noblest tempers run!  
His filial duty now forsakes the son;  
Secluded from the day, in clanking chains  
His rage the parent’s agèd limbs constrains.  
Heaven frown’d--Dark vengeance lowering on his brows,  
And sheath’d in brass, the proud Castilian rose,  
Resolv’d the rigour to his daughter shown  
The battle should avenge, and blood atone.  
A numerous host against the prince he sped,  
The valiant prince his little army led:  
Dire was the shock; the deep-riven helms resound,  
And foes with foes lie grappling on the ground.  
Yet, though around the stripling’s sacred head  
By angel hands etherial shields were spread;  
Though glorious triumph on his valour smiled,  
Soon on his van the baffled foe recoil’d:  
With bands more num’rous to the field he came,  
His proud heart burning with the rage of shame.  
And now in turn Guimaria’s <span id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) lofty
wall,  
That saw his triumph, saw the hero fall;  
Within the town immured, distress’d he lay,  
To stern Castilia’s sword a certain prey.  
When now the guardian of his infant years,  
The valiant Egas, as a god appears;  
To proud Castile the suppliant noble bows,  
And faithful homage for his prince he vows.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

The proud Castile accepts his honour’d faith,  
And peace succeeds the dreadful scenes of death.  
Yet well, alas, the generous Egas knew  
His high-soul’d prince to man would never sue:  
Would never stoop to brook the servile stain,  
To hold a borrow’d, a dependent reign.  
And now with gloomy aspect rose the day,  
Decreed the plighted servile rights to pay;  
When Egas, to redeem his faith’s disgrace,  
Devotes himself, his spouse, and infant race.  
In gowns of white, as sentenced felons clad,  
When to the stake the sons of guilt are led,  
With feet unshod they slowly moved along,  
And from their necks the knotted halters hung.  
"And now, O king," the kneeling Egas cries,  
"Behold my perjured honour’s sacrifice:  
If such mean victims can atone thine ire,  
Here let my wife, my babes, myself expire.  
If gen’rous bosoms such revenge can take,  
Here let them perish for the father’s sake:  
The guilty tongue, the guilty hands are these,  
Nor let a common death thy wrath appease;  
For us let all the rage of torture burn,  
But to my prince, thy son, in friendship turn."

  He spoke, and bow’d his prostrate body low,  
As one who waits the lifted sabre’s blow;  
When o’er the block his languid arms are spread,  
And death, foretasted, whelms the heart with dread:  
So great a leader thus in humbled state,  
So firm his loyalty, his zeal so great,  
The brave Alonzo’s kindled ire subdu’d,  
And, lost in silent joy, the monarch stood;  
Then gave the hand, and sheath’d the hostile sword,  
And, to such honour honour’d peace <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_205.md)
restor’d.

  Oh Lusian faith! oh zeal beyond compare!  
What greater danger could the Persian dare,

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

Whose prince in tears, to view his mangled woe,  
Forgot the joy for Babylon’s <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_206.md)
o’erthrow.  
And now the youthful hero shines in arms,  
The banks of Tagus echo war’s alarms:  
O’er Ourique’s wide campaign his ensigns wave,  
And the proud Saracen to combat brave.  
Though prudence might arraign his fiery rage  
That dar’d with one, each hundred spears engage,  
In Heaven’s protecting care his courage lies,  
And Heaven, his friend, superior force supplies.  
Five Moorish kings against him march along,  
Ismar the noblest of the armèd throng;  
Yet each brave monarch claim’d the soldier’s name,  
And far o’er many a land was known to fame.  
In all the beauteous glow of blooming years <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_207.md)  
Beside each king a warrior nymph appears;  
Each with her sword her valiant lover guards,  
With smiles inspires him, and with smiles rewards.  
Such was the valour of the beauteous maid, <span
id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_208.md)  
Whose warlike arm proud Ilion’s <span id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_209.md)
fate delay’d.  
Such in the field the virgin warriors <span
id="fr_212"></span>[5](#fn_210.md) shone,  
Who drank the limpid wave of Thermodon. <span
id="fr_213"></span>[6](#fn_211.md)

  ’Twas morn’s still hour, before the dawning grey  
The stars’ bright twinkling radiance died away,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

When lo, resplendent in the heaven serene,  
High o’er the prince the sacred cross was seen;  
The godlike prince with Faith’s warm glow inflam’d,  
"Oh, not to me, my bounteous God!" exclaim’d,  
"Oh, not to me, who well thy grandeur know,  
But to the pagan herd thy wonders show."

  The Lusian host, enraptur’d, mark’d the sign  
That witness’d to their chief the aid divine:  
Right on the foe they shake the beamy lance,  
And with firm strides, and heaving breasts, advance;  
Then burst the silence, "Hail, O king!" they cry;  
"Our king, our king!" the echoing dales reply:  
Fir’d at the sound, with fiercer ardour glows  
The Heaven-made monarch; on the wareless foes  
Rushing, he speeds his ardent bands along:  
So, when the chase excites the rustic throng,  
Rous’d to fierce madness by their mingled cries,  
On the wild bull the red-eyed mastiff flies.  
The stern-brow’d tyrant roars and tears the ground  
His watchful horns portend the deathful wound.  
The nimble mastiff springing on the foe,  
Avoids the furious sharpness of the blow;  
Now by the neck, now by the gory sides  
Hangs fierce, and all his bellowing rage derides:  
In vain his eye-balls burn with living fire,  
In vain his nostrils clouds of smoke respire,  
His gorge torn down, down falls the furious prize  
With hollow thund’ring sound, and raging dies: <span
id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Thus, on the Moors the hero rush’d along,  
Th’ astonish’d Moors in wild confusion throng;  
They snatch their arms, the hasty trumpet sounds,  
With horrid yell the dread alarm rebounds;  
The warlike tumult maddens o’er the plain,  
As when the flame devours the bearded grain:  
The nightly flames the whistling winds inspire,  
Fierce through the braky thicket pours the fire:  
Rous’d by the crackling of the mounting blaze  
From sleep the shepherds start in wild amaze;  
They snatch their clothes with many a woeful cry,  
And, scatter’d, devious to the mountains fly:  
Such sudden dread the trembling Moors alarms,  
Wild and confused, they snatch the nearest arms;  
Yet flight they scorn, and, eager to engage,  
They spur their foamy steeds, and trust their furious rage:  
Amidst the horror of the headlong shock,  
With foot unshaken as the living rock  
Stands the bold Lusian firm; the purple wounds  
Gush horrible; deep, groaning rage resounds;  
Reeking behind the Moorish backs appear  
The shining point of many a Lusian spear;  
The mailcoats, hauberks, <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) and the
harness steel’d,  
Bruis’d, hack’d, and torn, lie scatter’d o’er the field;  
Beneath the Lusian sweepy force o’erthrown,  
Crush’d by their batter’d mails the wounded groan;  
Burning with thirst they draw their panting breath,  
And curse their prophet <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_214.md) as they
writhe in death.  
Arms sever’d from the trunks still grasp the steel, <span
id="fr_217"></span>[3](#fn_215.md)  
Heads gasping roll; the fighting squadrons reel;  
Fainty and weak with languid arms they close,  
And stagg’ring, grapple with the stagg’ring foes.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

So, when an oak falls headlong on the lake,  
The troubled waters slowly settling shake:  
So faints the languid combat on the plain,  
And settling, staggers o’er the heaps of slain.  
Again the Lusian fury wakes its fires,  
The terror of the Moors new strength inspires:  
The scatter’d few in wild confusion fly,  
And total rout resounds the yelling cry.  
Defil’d with one wide sheet of reeking gore,  
The verdure of the lawn appears no more:  
In bubbling streams the lazy currents run,  
And shoot red flames beneath the evening sun.  
With spoils enrich’d, with glorious trophies <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_216.md) crown’d,  
The Heaven-made sov’reign on the battle ground

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

Three days encamp’d, to rest his weary train,  
Whose dauntless valour drove the Moors from Spain.  
And now, in honour of the glorious day,  
When five proud monarchs fell, his vanquish’d prey,  
On his broad buckler, unadorn’d before,  
Placed as a cross, five azure shields he wore,  
In grateful memory of the heav’nly sign,  
The pledge of conquest by the aid divine.

  Nor long his falchion in the scabbard slept,  
His warlike arm increasing laurels reap’d:  
From Leyra’s walls the baffled Ismar flies,  
And strong Arroncha falls his conquer’d prize;  
That honour’d town, through whose Elysian groves  
Thy smooth and limpid wave, O Tagus, roves.  
Th’ illustrious Santarene confess’d his power,  
And vanquish’d Mafra yields her proudest tower.  
The Lunar mountains saw his troops display  
Their marching banners and their brave array:  
To him submits fair Cintra’s cold domain,  
The soothing refuge of the Naiad train.  
When Love’s sweet snares the pining nymphs would shun:  
Alas, in vain, from warmer climes they run:  
The cooling shades awake the young desires,  
And the cold fountains cherish love’s soft fires.  
And thou, famed Lisbon, whose embattled wall  
Rose by the hand that wrought proud Ilion’s <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) fall; <span
id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_218.md)  
Thou queen of cities, whom the seas obey,  
Thy dreaded ramparts own’d the hero’s sway.  
Far from the north a warlike navy bore  
From Elbe, from Rhine, and Albion’s misty <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_219.md) shore;

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

To rescue Salem’s <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) long-polluted
shrine  
Their force to great Alonzo’s force they joie:  
Before Ulysses’ walls the navy rides,  
The joyful Tagus laves their pitchy sides.  
Five times the moon her empty horns conceal’d,  
Five times her broad effulgence shone reveal’d,  
When, wrapt in clouds of dust, her mural pride  
Falls thund’ring,--black the smoking breach yawns wide.  
As, when th’ imprison’d waters burst the mounds,  
And roar, wide sweeping, o’er the cultur’d grounds;  
Nor cot nor fold withstand their furious course;  
So, headlong rush’d along the hero’s force.  
The thirst of vengeance the assailants fires,  
The madness of despair the Moors inspires;  
Each lane, each street resounds the conflict’s roar,  
And every threshold reeks with tepid gore.

  Thus fell the city, whose unconquer’d <span
id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_221.md) towers  
Defied of old the banded Gothic powers,  
Whose harden’d nerves in rig’rous climates train’d  
The savage courage of their souls sustain’d:  
Before whose sword the sons of Ebro fled,  
And Tagus trembled in his oozy bed;  
Aw’d by whose arms the lawns of Betis’ shore  
The name Vandalia from the Vandals bore.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

When Lisbon’s towers before the Lusian fell,  
What fort, what rampart might his arms repel!  
Estremadura’s region owns him lord,  
And Torres-vedras bends beneath his sword;  
Obidos humbles, and Alamquer yields,  
Alamquer famous for her verdant fields,  
Whose murm’ring riv’lets cheer the traveller’s way,  
As the chill waters o’er the pebbles stray.  
Elva the green, and Moura’s fertile dales,  
Fair Serpa’s tillage, and Alcazar’s vales  
Not for himself the Moorish peasant sows;  
For Lusian hands the yellow harvest glows:  
And you, fair lawns, beyond the Tagus’ wave,  
Your golden burdens for Alonzo save;  
Soon shall his thund’ring might your wealth reclaim,  
And your glad valleys hail their monarch’s name.

  Nor sleep his captains while the sov’reign wars;  
The brave Giraldo’s sword in conquest shares,  
Evora’s frowning walls, the castled hold  
Of that proud Roman chief, and rebel bold,  
Sertorious dread, whose labours still remain; <span
id="fr_224"></span>[1](#fn_222.md)  
Two hundred arches, stretch’d in length, sustain  
The marble duct, where, glist’ning to the sun,  
Of silver hue the shining waters run.  
Evora’s frowning walls now shake with fear,  
And yield, obedient to Giraldo’s spear.  
Nor rests the monarch while his servants toil,  
Around him still increasing trophies smile,  
And deathless fame repays the hapless fate  
That gives to human life so short a date.  
Proud Beja’s castled walls his fury storms,  
And one red slaughter every lane deforms.  
The ghosts, whose mangled limbs, yet scarcely cold,  
Heap’d, sad Trancoso’s streets in carnage roll’d,  
Appeas’d, the vengeance of their slaughter see,  
And hail th’ indignant king’s severe decree.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Palmela trembles on her mountain’s height,  
And sea-laved Zambra owns the hero’s might.  
Nor these alone confess’d his happy star,  
Their fated doom produc’d a nobler war.  
Badaja’s <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) king, a haughty Moor,
beheld  
His towns besieg’d, and hasted to the field.  
Four thousand coursers in his army neigh’d,  
Unnumber’d spears his infantry display’d;  
Proudly they march’d, and glorious to behold,  
In silver belts they shone, and plates of gold.  
Along a mountain’s side secure they trod,  
Steep on each hand, and rugged was the road;  
When, as a bull, whose lustful veins betray  
The madd’ning tumult of inspiring May;  
If, when his rage with fiercest ardour glows,  
When in the shade the fragrant heifer lows,  
If then, perchance, his jealous burning eye  
Behold a careless traveller wander by,  
With dreadful bellowing on the wretch he flies,  
The wretch defenceless, torn and trampled dies.  
So rush’d Alonzo on the gaudy train,  
And pour’d victorious o’er the mangled slain;  
The royal Moor precipitates in flight,  
The mountain echoes with the wild affright  
Of flying squadrons; down their arms they throw,  
And dash from rock to rock to shun the foe.  
The foe! what wonders may not virtue dare!  
But sixty horsemen wag’d the conqu’ring war. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_224.md)  
The warlike monarch still his toil renews,  
New conquest still each victory pursues.  
To him Badaja’s lofty gates expand,  
And the wide region owns his dread command.  
When, now enraged, proud Leon’s king beheld  
Those walls subdued, which saw his troops expell’d;  
Enrag’d he saw them own the victor’s sway,  
And hems them round with battailous array.  
With gen’rous ire the brave Alonzo glows;  
By Heaven unguarded, on the num’rous foes

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

He rushes, glorying in his wonted force,  
And spurs, with headlong rage, his furious horse;  
The combat burns, the snorting courser bounds,  
And paws impetuous by the iron mounds:  
O’er gasping foes and sounding bucklers trod  
The raging steed, and headlong as he rode  
Dash’d the fierce monarch on a rampire bar--  
Low grovelling in the dust, the pride of war,  
The great Alonzo lies. The captive’s fate  
Succeeds, alas, the pomp of regal state.  
"Let iron dash his limbs," his mother cried,  
"And steel revenge my chains:" she spoke, and died;  
And Heaven assented--Now the hour was come,  
And the dire curse was fallen Alonzo’s doom. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_225.md)

  No more, O Pompey, of thy fate complain,  
No more with sorrow view thy glory’s stain;  
Though thy tall standards tower’d with lordly pride  
Where northern Phasis <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_226.md) rolls his
icy tide;  
Though hot Syene, <span id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_227.md) where the sun’s
fierce ray  
Begets no shadow, own’d thy conqu’ring sway;  
Though from the tribes that shiver in the gleam  
Of cold Boötes’ wat’ry glist’ning team;  
To those who parch’d beneath the burning line,  
In fragrant shades their feeble limbs recline,  
The various languages proclaim’d thy fame,  
And trembling, own’d the terrors of thy name;

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

Though rich Arabia, and Sarmatia bold,  
And Colchis, <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_228.md)famous for the fleece
of gold;  
Though Judah’s land, whose sacred rites implor’d  
The One true God, and, as he taught, ador’d;  
Though Cappadocia’s realm thy mandate sway’d,  
And base Sophenia’s sons thy nod obey’d;  
Though vex’d Cilicia’s pirates wore thy bands,  
And those who cultur’d fair Armenia’s lands,  
Where from the sacred mount two rivers flow,  
And what was Eden to the pilgrim show;  
Though from the vast Atlantic’s bounding wave  
To where the northern tempests howl and rave  
Round Taurus’ lofty brows: though vast and wide  
The various climes that bended to thy pride;  
No more with pining anguish of regret  
Bewail the horrors of Pharsalia’s fate:  
For great Alonzo, whose superior name  
Unequall’d victories consign to fame,  
The great Alonzo fell--like thine his woe;  
From nuptial kindred came the fatal blow.

  When now the hero, humbled in the dust,  
His crime aton’d, confess’d that Heaven was just,  
Again in splendour he the throne ascends:  
Again his bow the Moorish chieftain bends.  
Wide round th’ embattl’d gates of Santareen  
Their shining spears and banner’d moons are seen.  
But holy rites the pious king preferr’d;  
The martyr’s bones on Vincent’s Cape interr’d  
(His sainted name the Cape shall ever bear), <span
id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_229.md)  
To Lisbon’s walls he brought with votive care.  
And now the monarch, old and feeble grown,  
Resigns the falchion to his valiant son.  
O’er Tagus’ waves the youthful hero pass’d,  
And bleeding hosts before him shrunk aghast.  
Chok’d with the slain, with Moorish carnage dy’d,  
Sevilia’s river roll’d the purple tide.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

Burning for victory, the warlike boy  
Spares not a day to thoughtless rest or joy.  
Nor long his wish unsatisfied remains:  
With the besiegers’ gore he dyes the plains  
That circle Beja’s wall: yet still untam’d,  
With all the fierceness of despair inflam’d,  
The raging Moor collects his distant might;  
Wide from the shores of Atlas’ starry height,  
From Amphelusia’s cape, and Tingia’s <span
id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_230.md) bay,  
Where stern Antæus held his brutal sway,  
The Mauritanian trumpet sounds to arms;  
And Juba’s realm returns the hoarse alarms;  
The swarthy tribes in burnish’d armour shine,  
Their warlike march Abyla’s shepherds join.  
The great Miramolin <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) on Tagus’
shores  
Far o’er the coast his banner’d thousands pours;  
Twelve kings and one beneath his ensigns stand,  
And wield their sabres at his dread command.  
The plund’ring bands far round the region haste,  
The mournful region lies a naked waste.  
And now, enclos’d in Santareen’s high towers,  
The brave Don Sancho shuns th’ unequal powers;  
A thousand arts the furious Moor pursues,  
And ceaseless, still the fierce assault renews.  
Huge clefts of rock, from horrid engines whirl’d,  
In smould’ring volleys on the town are hurl’d;  
The brazen rams the lofty turrets shake,  
And, mined beneath, the deep foundations quake;  
But brave Alonzo’s son, as danger grows,  
His pride inflam’d, with rising courage glows;  
Each coming storm of missile darts he wards,  
Each nodding turret, and each port he guards.  
In that fair city, round whose verdant meads  
The branching river of Mondego <span id="fr_234"></span>[3](#fn_232.md)
spreads,  
Long worn with warlike toils, and bent with years,  
The king reposed, when Sancho’s fate he hears.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

His limbs forget the feeble steps of age,  
And the hoar warrior burns with youthful rage.  
His daring vet’rans, long to conquest train’d,  
He leads--the ground with Moorish blood is stain’d;  
Turbans, and robes of various colours wrought,  
And shiver’d spears in streaming carnage float.  
In harness gay lies many a welt’ring steed,  
And, low in dust, the groaning masters bleed.  
As proud Miramolin <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_233.md) in horror
fled,  
Don Sancho’s javelin stretch’d him with the dead.  
In wild dismay, and torn with gushing wounds,  
The rout, wide scatter’d, fly the Lusian bounds.  
Their hands to heaven the joyful victors raise,  
And every voice resounds the song of praise;  
"Nor was it stumbling chance, nor human might;  
"’Twas guardian Heaven," they sung, "that ruled the fight."

  This blissful day Alonzo’s glories crown’d;  
But pale disease now gave the secret wound;  
Her icy hand his feeble limbs invades,  
And pining languor through his vitals spreads.  
The glorious monarch to the tomb descends,  
A nation’s grief the funeral torch attends.  
Each winding shore for thee, Alonzo, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_234.md) mourns,  
Alonzo’s name each woeful bay returns;  
For thee the rivers sigh their groves among,  
And funeral murmurs wailing, roll along;  
Their swelling tears o’erflow the wide campaign;  
With floating heads, for thee, the yellow grain,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

For thee the willow-bowers and copses weep,  
As their tall boughs lie trembling on the deep;  
Adown the streams the tangled vine-leaves flow,  
And all the landscape wears the look of woe.  
Thus, o’er the wond’ring world thy glories spread,  
And thus thy mournful people bow the head;  
While still, at eve, each’ dale Alonzo sighs,  
And, oh, Alonzo! every hill replies;  
And still the mountain-echoes trill the lay,  
Till blushing morn brings on the noiseful day.

  The youthful Sancho to the throne succeeds,  
Already far renown’d for val’rous deeds;  
Let Betis’, <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_235.md) ting’d with blood, his
prowess tell,  
And Beja’s lawns, where boastful Afric fell.  
Nor less when king his martial ardour glows,  
Proud Sylves’ royal walls his troops enclose!  
Fair Sylves’ lawns the Moorish peasant plough’d,  
Her vineyards cultur’d, and her valleys sow’d;  
But Lisbon’s monarch reap’d. The winds of heaven <span
id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_236.md)  
Roar’d high--and headlong by the tempest driven,  
In Tagus’ breast a gallant navy sought  
The shelt’ring port, and glad assistance brought.  
The warlike crew, by Frederic the Red, <span
id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_237.md)  
To rescue Judah’s prostrate land were led;  
When Guido’s troops, by burning thirst subdu’d,  
To Saladin, the foe, for mercy su’d.  
Their vows were holy, and the cause the same,  
To blot from Europe’s shores the Moorish name.  
In Sancho’s cause the gallant navy joins,  
And royal Sylves to their force resigns.  
Thus, sent by Heaven, a foreign naval band  
Gave Lisbon’s ramparts to the sire’s command.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

  Nor Moorish trophies did alone adorn  
The hero’s name; in warlike camps though born,  
Though fenc’d with mountains, Leon’s martial race  
Smile at the battle-sign, yet foul disgrace  
To Leon’s haughty sons his sword achiev’d:  
Proud Tui’s neck his servile yoke receiv’d;  
And, far around, falls many a wealthy town,  
O valiant Sancho, humbled to thy frown.

  While thus his laurels flourish’d wide and fair  
He dies: Alonzo reigns, his much-lov’d heir.  
Alcazar lately conquer’d from the Moor,  
Reconquer’d, streams with the defenders’ gore.

  Alonzo dead, another Sancho reigns:  
Alas, with many a sigh the land complains!  
Unlike his sire, a vain unthinking boy,  
His servants now a jarring sway enjoy.  
As his the power, his were the crimes of those  
Whom to dispense that sacred power he chose.  
By various counsels waver’d, and confus’d  
By seeming friends, by various arts, abus’d;  
Long undetermin’d, blindly rash at last,  
Enrag’d, unmann’d, untutor’d by the past.  
Yet, not like Nero, cruel and unjust,  
The slave capricious of unnatural lust.  
Nor had he smil’d had flames consum’d his Troy;  
Nor could his people’s groans afford him joy;  
Nor did his woes from female manners spring,  
Unlike the Syrian, <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_238.md) or Sicilia’s
king.  
No hundred cooks his costly meal prepar’d,  
As heap’d the board when Rome’s proud tyrant far’d. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_239.md)  
Nor dar’d the artist hope his ear to <span
id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_240.md) gain,  
By new-form’d arts to point the stings of pain.  
But, proud and high the Lusian spirit soar’d,  
And ask’d a godlike hero for their lord.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

To none accustom’d but a hero’s sway,  
Great must he be whom that bold race obey.

  Complaint, loud murmur’d, every city fills,  
Complaint, loud echo’d, murmurs through the hills.  
Alarm’d, Bolonia’s warlike Earl <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_241.md)
awakes,  
And from his listless brother’s minions takes  
The awful sceptre.--Soon was joy restor’d,  
And soon, by just succession, Lisbon’s lord  
Beloved, Alonzo, nam’d the Bold, he reigns;  
Nor may the limits of his sire’s domains  
Confine his mounting spirit. When he led  
His smiling consort to the bridal bed,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

"Algarbia’s realm," he said, "shall prove thy dower,"  
And, soon Algarbia, conquer’d, own’d his power.  
The vanquish’d Moor with total rout expell’d,  
All Lusus’ shores his might unrivall’d held.  
And now brave Diniz reigns, whose noble fire  
Bespoke the genuine lineage of his sire.  
Now, heavenly peace wide wav’d her olive bough,  
Each vale display’d the labours of the plough,  
And smil’d with joy: the rocks on every shore  
Resound the dashing of the merchant-oar.  
Wise laws are form’d, and constitutions weigh’d,  
And the deep-rooted base of Empire laid.  
Not Ammon’s son <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_242.md) with larger heart
bestow’d,  
Nor such the grace to him the Muses owed.  
From Helicon the Muses wing their way,  
Mondego’s <span id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) flow’ry banks invite
their stay.  
Now Coimbra shines Minerva’s proud abode;  
And fir’d with joy, Parnassus’ bloomy god  
Beholds another dear-lov’d Athens rise,  
And spread her laurels in indulgent skies;  
Her wreath of laurels, ever green, he twines  
With threads of gold, and baccaris <span id="fr_246"></span>[3](#fn_244.md)
adjoins.  
Here castle walls in warlike grandeur lower,  
Here cities swell, and lofty temples tower:  
In wealth and grandeur each with other vies:  
When old and lov’d the parent-monarch dies.  
His son, alas, remiss in filial deeds,  
But wise in peace, and bold in fight, succeeds,  
The fourth Alonzo: Ever arm’d for war  
He views the stern Castile with watchful care.  
Yet, when the Libyan nations cross’d the main,  
And spread their thousands o’er the fields of Spain,  
The brave Alonzo drew his awful steel,  
And sprung to battle for the proud Castile.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

  When Babel’s haughty queen’ unsheath’d the sword,  
And o’er Hydaspes <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_245.md) lawns her
legions pour’d;  
When dreadful Attila, <span id="fr_248"></span>[2](#fn_246.md) to whom was
given  
That fearful name, "the Scourge of angry Heaven,"  
The fields of trembling Italy o’erran  
With many a Gothic tribe, and northern clan;  
Not such unnumber’d banners then were seen,  
As now in fair Tartesia’s dales convene;  
Numidia’s bow, and Mauritania’s spear,  
And all the might of Hagar’s race was here;  
Granada’s mongrels join their num’rous host,  
To those who dar’d the seas from Libya’s coast.  
Aw’d by the fury of such pond’rous force  
The proud Castilian tries each hop’d resource;  
Yet, not by terror for himself inspir’d,  
For Spain he trembl’d, and for Spain was fir’d.  
His much-lov’d bride, <span id="fr_249"></span>[3](#fn_247.md) his
messenger, he sends,  
And, to the hostile Lusian lowly bends.  
The much-lov’d daughter of the king implor’d,  
Now sues her father for her wedded lord.  
The beauteous dame approach’d the palace gate,  
Where her great sire was thron’d in regal state:  
On her fair face deep-settled grief appears,  
And her mild eyes are bath’d in glist’ning tears;  
Her careless ringlets, as a mourner’s, flow  
Adown her shoulders, and her breasts of snow:  
A secret transport through the father ran,  
While thus, in sighs, the royal bride began:--

  "And know’st thou not, O warlike king," she cried,  
"That furious Afric pours her peopled tide--  
Her barb’rous nations, o’er the fields of Spain?  
Morocco’s lord commands the dreadful train.  
Ne’er since the surges bath’d the circling coast,  
Beneath one standard march’d so dread a host:

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Such the dire fierceness of their brutal rage,  
Pale are our bravest youth as palsied age.  
By night our fathers shades confess their fear, <span
id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_248.md)  
Their shrieks of terror from the tombs we hear:  
To stem the rage of these unnumber’d bands,  
Alone, O sire, my gallant husband stands;  
His little host alone their breasts oppose  
To the barb’d darts of Spain’s innum’rous foes:  
Then haste, O monarch, thou whose conqu’ring spear  
Has chill’d Malucca’s <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) sultry waves
with fear:  
Haste to the rescue of distress’d Castile,  
(Oh! be that smile thy dear affection’s seal!)  
And speed, my father, ere my husband’s fate  
Be fix’d, and I, deprived of regal state,  
Be left in captive solitude forlorn,  
My spouse, my kingdom, and my birth to mourn."

  In tears, and trembling, spoke the filial queen.  
So, lost in grief, was lovely Venus <span
id="fr_252"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) seen,  
When Jove, her sire, the beauteous mourner pray’d  
To grant her wand’ring son the promis’d aid.  
Great Jove was mov’d to hear the fair deplore,  
Gave all she ask’d, and griev’d she ask’d no more.  
So griev’d Alonzo’s noble heart. And now  
The warrior binds in steel his awful brow;  
The glitt’ring squadrons march in proud array,  
On burnish’d shields the trembling sunbeams play:  
The blaze of arms the warlike rage inspires,  
And wakes from slothful peace the hero’s fires.  
With trampling hoofs Evora’s plains rebound,  
And sprightly neighings echo far around;

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Far on each side the clouds of dust arise,  
The drum’s rough rattling rolls along the skies;  
The trumpet’s shrilly clangor sounds alarms,  
And each heart burns, and ardent, pants for arms.  
Where their bright blaze the royal ensigns pour’d,  
High o’er the rest the great Alonzo tower’d;  
High o’er the rest was his bold front admir’d,  
And his keen eyes new warmth, new force inspir’d.  
Proudly he march’d, and now, in Tarif’s plain  
The two Alonzos join their martial train:  
Right to the foe, in battle-rank updrawn,  
They pause--the mountain and the wide-spread lawn  
Afford not foot-room for the crowded foe:  
Aw’d with the horrors of the lifted blow  
Pale look’d our bravest heroes. Swell’d with pride,  
The foes already conquer’d Spain divide,  
And, lordly o’er the field the .promis’d victors stride.  
So, strode in Elah’s vale the tow’ring height  
Of Gath’s proud champion; <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_251.md) so, with
pale affright,  
The Hebrews trembled, while with impious pride  
The huge-limb’d foe the shepherd boy <span
id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_252.md) defied:  
The valiant boy advancing, fits the string,  
And round his head he whirls the sounding sling;  
The monster staggers with the forceful wound,  
And his huge bulk lies groaning on the ground.  
Such impious scorn the Moor’s proud bosom swell’d,  
When our thin squadrons took the battle-field;  
Unconscious of the Power who led us on,  
That Power whose nod confounds th’ eternal throne;  
Led by that Power, the brave Castilian bar’d  
The shining blade, and proud Morocco dar’d  
His conqu’ring brand the Lusian hero drew,  
And on Granada’s sons resistless flew;  
The spear-staffs crash, the splinters hiss around,  
And the broad bucklers rattle on the ground:  
With piercing shrieks the Moors their prophet’s name,  
And ours, their guardian saint, aloud acclaim.  
Wounds gush on wounds, and blows resound to blows  
A. lake of blood the level plain o’erflows;

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

The wounded, gasping in the purple tide,  
Now find the death the sword but half supplied.  
Though wove <span id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_253.md) and quilted by their
ladies’ hands,  
Vain were the mail-plates of Granada’s bands.  
With such dread force the Lusian rush’d along,  
Steep’d in red carnage lay the boastful throng.  
Yet now, disdainful of so light a prize,  
Fierce o’er the field the thund’ring hero flies;  
And his bold arm the brave Castilian joins  
In dreadful conflict with the Moorish lines.

  The parting sun now pour’d the ruddy blaze,  
And twinkling Vesper shot his silv’ry rays  
Athwart the gloom, and clos’d the glorious day,  
When, low in dust, the strength of Afric lay.  
Such dreadful slaughter of the boastful Moor  
Never on battle-field was heap’d before;  
Not he whose childhood vow’d <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_254.md)
eternal hate  
And desp’rate war against the Roman state:  
Though three strong coursers bent beneath the weight  
Of rings of gold (by many a Roman knight,  
Erewhile, the badge of rank distinguish’d, worn),  
From their cold hands at Cannæ’s <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_255.md)
slaughter torn;  
Not his dread sword bespread the reeking plain  
With such wide streams of gore, and hills of slain;  
Nor thine, O Titus, swept from Salem’s land  
Such floods of ghosts, rolled down to death’s dark strand;  
Though, ages ere she fell, the prophets old  
The dreadful scene of Salem’s fall foretold,  
In words that breathe wild horror: nor the shore,  
When carnage chok’d the stream, so smok’d with gore,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

When Marius’ fainting legions drank the flood,  
Yet warm, and purpled with Ambronian <span
id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_256.md) blood;  
Not such the heaps as now the plains of Tarif strew’d.

  While glory, thus, Alonzo’s name adorn’d,  
To Lisbon’s shores the happy chief return’d,  
In glorious peace and well-deserv’d repose,  
His course of fame, and honour’d age to close.  
When now, O king, a damsel’s fate <span id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_257.md)
severe,  
A fate which ever claims the woeful tear,  
Disgraced his honours------On the nymph’s ’lorn head  
Relentless rage its bitterest rancour shed:  
Yet, such the zeal her princely lover bore,  
Her breathless corse the crown of Lisbon wore.  
’Twas thou, O Love, whose dreaded shafts control  
The hind’s rude heart, and tear the hero’s soul;  
Thou, ruthless power, with bloodshed never cloy’d,  
’Twas thou thy lovely votary destroy’d.  
Thy thirst still burning for a deeper woe,  
In vain to thee the tears of beauty flow;

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

The breast that feels thy purest flames divine,  
With spouting gore must bathe thy cruel shrine.  
Such thy dire triumphs!--Thou, O nymph, the while,  
Prophetic of the god’s unpitying guile,  
In tender scenes by love-sick fancy wrought,  
By fear oft shifted, as by fancy brought,  
In sweet Mondego’s ever-verdant bowers,  
Languish’d away the slow and lonely hours:  
While now, as terror wak’d thy boding fears,  
The conscious stream receiv’d thy pearly tears;  
And now, as hope reviv’d the brighter flame,  
Each echo sigh’d thy princely lover’s name.  
Nor less could absence from thy prince remove  
The dear remembrance of his distant love:  
Thy looks, thy smiles, before him ever glow,  
And o’er his melting heart endearing flow:  
By night his slumbers bring thee to his arms,  
By day his thoughts still wander o’er thy charms:  
By night, by day, each thought thy loves employ,  
Each thought the memory, or the hope, of joy.  
Though fairest princely dames invok’d his love,  
No princely dame his constant faith could move:  
For thee, alone, his constant passion burn’d,  
For thee the proffer’d royal maids he scorn’d.  
Ah, hope of bliss too high--the princely dames  
Refus’d, dread rage the father’s breast inflames;  
He, with an old man’s wintry eye, surveys  
The youth’s fond love, and coldly with it weighs  
The people’s murmurs of his son’s delay  
To bless the nation with his nuptial day.  
(Alas, the nuptial day was past unknown,  
Which, but when crown’d, the prince could dare to own.)  
And, with the fair one’s blood, the vengeful sire  
Resolves to quench his Pedro’s faithful fire.  
Oh, thou dread sword, oft stain’d with heroes’ gore,  
Thou awful terror of the prostrate Moor,  
What rage could aim thee at a female breast,  
Unarm’d, by softness and by love possess’d!

  Dragg’d from her bower, by murd’rous ruffian hands,  
Before the frowning king fair Inez stands;

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

Her tears of artless innocence, her air  
So mild, so lovely, and her face so fair,  
Mov’d the stern. monarch; when, with eager zeal,  
Her fierce destroyers urg’d the public weal;  
Dread rage again the tyrant’s soul possess’d,  
And his dark brow his cruel thoughts confess’d;  
O’er her fair face a sudden paleness spread,  
Her throbbing heart with gen’rous anguish bled,  
Anguish to view her lover’s hopeless woes,  
And all the mother in her bosom rose.  
Her beauteous eyes, in trembling tear-drops drown’d,  
To heaven she lifted (for her hands were bound); <span
id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_258.md)  
Then, on her infants turn’d the piteous glance,  
The look of bleeding woe; the babes advance,  
Smiling in innocence of infant age,  
Unaw’d, unconscious of their grandsire’s rage;  
To whom, as bursting sorrow gave the flow,  
The native heart-sprung eloquence of woe,  
The lovely captive thus:--"O monarch, hear,  
If e’er to thee the name of man was dear,  
If prowling tigers, or the wolf’s wild brood  
(Inspir’d by nature with the lust of blood),  
Have yet been mov’d the weeping babe to spare,  
Nor left, but tended with a nurse’s care,  
As Rome’s great founders <span id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_259.md) to the
world were given;  
Shalt thou, who wear’st the sacred stamp of Heaven,  
The human form divine, shalt thou deny  
That aid, that pity, which e’en beasts supply!  
Oh, that thy heart were, as thy looks declare,  
Of human mould, superfluous were my prayer;  
Thou couldst not, then, a helpless damsel slay,  
Whose sole offence in fond affection lay,  
In faith to him who first his love confess’d,  
’Who first to love allur’d her virgin breast.  
In these my babes shalt thou thine image see,  
And, still tremendous, hurl thy rage on me?

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

Me, for their sakes, if yet thou wilt not spare,  
Oh, let these infants prove thy pious care! <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_260.md)  
Yet, Pity’s lenient current ever flows  
From that brave breast where genuine valour glows;  
That thou art brave, let vanquish’d Afric tell,  
Then let thy pity o’er mine anguish swell;  
Ah, let my woes, unconscious of a crime,  
Procure mine exile to some barb’rous clime:  
Give me to wander o’er the burning plains  
Of Libya’s deserts, or the wild domains  
Of Scythia’s snow-clad rocks, and frozen shore;  
There let me, hopeless of return, deplore:  
Where ghastly horror fills the dreary vale,  
Where shrieks and howlings die on every gale,  
The lion’s roaring, and the tiger’s yell,  
There, with mine infant race, consign’d to dwell,  
There let me try that piety to find,  
In vain by me implor’d from human kind:  
There, in some dreary cavern’s rocky womb,  
Amid the horrors of sepulchral gloom,  
For him whose love I mourn, my love shall glow,  
The sigh shall murmur, and the tear shall flow:  
All my fond wish, and all my hope, to rear  
These infant pledges of a love so dear,  
Amidst my griefs a soothing glad employ,  
Amidst my fears a woeful, hopeless joy."

  In tears she utter’d--as the frozen snow  
Touch’d by the spring’s mild ray, begins to flow,

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

So, just began to melt his stubborn soul,  
As mild-ray’d Pity o’er the tyrant stole;  
But destiny forbade: with eager zeal  
(Again pretended for the public weal),  
Her fierce accusers urg’d her speedy doom;  
Again, dark rage diffus’d its horrid gloom  
O’er stern Alonzo’s brow: swift at the sign,  
Their swords, unsheath’d, around her brandish’d shine.  
O foul disgrace, of knighthood lasting stain,  
By men of arms a helpless lady <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_261.md)
slain!

  Thus Pyrrhus, <span id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) burning with
unmanly ire,  
Fulfilled the mandate of his furious sire;  
Disdainful of the frantic matron’s <span id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_263.md)
prayer,  
On fair Polyxena, her last fond care,  
He rush’d, his blade yet warm with Priam’s gore,  
And dash’d the daughter on the sacred floor;  
While mildly she her raving mother eyed,  
Resign’d her bosom to the sword, and died.  
Thus Inez, while her eyes to heaven appeal,  
Resigns her bosom to the murd’ring steel:

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

That snowy neck, whose matchless form sustain’d  
The loveliest face where all the graces reign’d,  
Whose charms so long the gallant prince enflam’d,  
That her pale corse was Lisbon’s queen <span
id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_264.md) proclaim’d,  
That snowy neck was stain’d with spouting gore,  
Another sword her lovely bosom tore.  
The flowers that glisten’d with her tears bedew’d,  
Now shrunk and languish’d with her blood embru’d.  
As when a rose, ere-while of bloom so gay,  
Thrown from the careless virgin’s breast away,  
Lies faded on the plain, the living red,  
The snowy white, and all its fragrance fled;  
So from her cheeks the roses died away,  
And pale in death the beauteous Inez lay:  
With dreadful smiles, and crimson’d with her blood,  
Round the wan victim the stern murd’rers stood,  
Unmindful of the sure, though future hour,  
Sacred to vengeance and her lover’s power.

  O Sun, couldst thou so foul a crime behold,  
Nor veil thine head in darkness, as of old <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_265.md)  
A sudden night unwonted horror cast  
O’er that dire banquet, where the sire’s repast  
The son’s torn limbs supplied!--Yet you, ye vales!  
Ye distant forests, and ye flow’ry dales!  
When pale and sinking to the dreadful fall,  
You heard her quiv’ring lips on Pedro call;  
Your faithful echoes caught the parting sound,  
And Pedro! Pedro! mournful, sigh’d around.  
Nor less the wood-nymphs of Mondego’s groves  
Bewail’d the memory of her hapless loves:  
Her griefs they wept, and, to a plaintive rill  
Transform’d their tears, which weeps and murmurs still.  
To give immortal pity to her woe  
They taught the riv’let through her bowers to flow,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

And still, through violet-beds, the fountain pours  
Its plaintive wailing, and is named Amours. <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_266.md)  
Nor long her blood for vengeance cried in vain:  
Her gallant lord begins his awful reign,  
In vain her murd’rers for refuge fly,  
Spain’s wildest hills no place of rest supply.  
The injur’d lover’s and the monarch’s ire,  
And stern-brow’d Justice in their doom conspire:  
In hissing flames they die, and yield their souls in fire. <span
id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_267.md)

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

  Nor this alone his stedfast soul display’d:  
Wide o’er the land he wav’d the awful blade  
Of red-arm’d Justice. From the shades of night  
He dragg’d the foul adulterer to light:  
The robber from his dark retreat was led,  
And he who spilt the blood of murder, bled.  
Unmov’d he heard the proudest noble plead;  
Where Justice aim’d her sword, with stubborn speed  
Fell the dire stroke. Nor cruelty inspir’d,  
Noblest humanity his bosom fir’d.  
The caitiff, starting at his thoughts, repress’d  
The seeds of murder springing in his breast.  
His outstretch’d arm the lurking thief withheld,  
For fix’d as fate he knew his doom was seal’d.  
Safe in his monarch’s care the ploughman reap’d,  
And proud oppression coward distance kept.  
Pedro the Just <span id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) the peopled towns
proclaim,  
And every field resounds her monarch’s name.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

  Of this brave prince the soft degen’rate son,  
Fernando the Remiss, ascends the throne.  
With arm unnerv’d the listless soldier lay  
And own’d the influence of a nerveless sway:  
The stern Castilian drew the vengeful brand,  
And strode proud victor o’er the trembling land.  
How dread the hour, when injur’d heaven, in rage,  
Thunders its vengeance on a guilty age!  
Unmanly sloth the king, the nation stain’d;  
And lewdness, foster’d by the monarch, reign’d:  
The monarch own’d that first of crimes unjust,  
The wanton revels of adult’rous lust:  
Such was his rage for beauteous <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_269.md)
Leonore,  
Her from her husband’s widow’d arms he tore:  
Then with unbless’d, unhallow’d nuptials stain’d  
The sacred altar, and its rites profan’d.  
Alas! the splendour of a crown, how vain,  
From Heaven’s dread eye to veil the dimmest stain!  
To conqu’ring Greece, to ruin’d Troy, what woes,  
What ills on ills, from Helen’s rape arose!  
Let Appius own, let banish’d Tarquin tell  
On their hot rage what heavy vengeance fell.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

One female, ravish’d, Gibeah’s streets <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_270.md) beheld,  
O’er Gibeah’s streets the blood of thousands swell’d  
In vengeance of the crime; and streams of blood  
The guilt of Zion’s sacred bard <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_271.md)
pursued.  
  Yet Love, full oft, with wild delirium blinds,  
And fans his basest fires in noblest minds;  
The female garb the great Alcides <span id="fr_274"></span>[3](#fn_272.md)
wore,  
And for his Omphăle the distaff <span id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_273.md)
bore.  
For Cleopatra’s frown the world was lost:  
The Roman terror, and the Punic boast,  
Cannæ’s great victor, <span id="fr_276"></span>[5](#fn_274.md) for a
harlot’s smile,  
Resign’d the harvest of his glorious toil.  
And who can boast he never felt the fires,  
The trembling throbbings of the young desires,  
When he beheld the breathing roses glow,  
And the soft heavings of the living snow;  
The waving ringlets of the auburn hair,  
And all the rapt’rous graces of the fair!  
Oh! what defence, if fix’d on him, he spy  
The languid sweetness of the stedfast eye!  
Ye who have felt the dear, luxurious smart,  
When angel-charms oppress the powerless heart,  
In pity here relent the brow severe,  
And o’er Fernando’s weakness drop the tear. <span

fallen into the common error of little poets, who on every occasion
bewail the outrage which the Goths and Vandals did to the arts and
sciences. A complaint founded on ignorance. The Southern nations of
Europe were sunk into the most contemptible degeneracy. The sciences,
with every branch of manly literature, were almost unknown. For near two
centuries no poet of note had adorned the Roman empire. Those arts only,
the abuse of which have a certain and fatal tendency to enervate the
mind, the arts of music and cookery, were passionately cultivated in all
the refinements of effeminate abuse. The art of war was too laborious
for their delicacy, and the generous warmth of heroism and patriotism
was incompatible with their effeminacy. On these despicable
Sybarites <span id="fr_186"></span>[\*](#fn_184.md) the North poured her
brave and hardy sons, who, though ignorant of polite literature, were
possessed of all the manly virtues in a high degree. Under their
conquests Europe wore a new face, which, however rude, was infinitely
preferable to that which it had lately worn. And, however ignorance may
talk of their barbarity, it is to them that England owes her
constitution, which, as Montesquieu observes, they brought from the
woods of Saxony.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[67:2](lusbk03.htm#fr_197.md) Don Alonzo, king of
Spain, apprehensive of the superior number of the Moors, with whom he
was at war, demanded assistance from Philip I. of France, and the Duke
of Burgundy. According to the military spirit of the nobility of that
age, no sooner was his desire known than numerous bodies of troops
thronged to his standard. These, in the course of a few years, having
shown signal proofs of their courage, the king distinguished the leaders
with different marks of his regard. To Henry, a younger son of the Duke
of Burgundy, he gave his daughter Teresa in marriage, with the
sovereignty of the countries to the south of Galicia, commissioning him
to enlarge his boundaries by the expulsion of the Moors. Under the
government of this great man, who reigned by the title of Count, his
dominion was greatly enlarged, and became more rich and populous than
before. The two provinces of Entre Minho e Douro, and Tras os Montes,
were subdued, with that part of Beira which was held by the Moorish king
of Lamego, whom he constrained to pay tribute. Many thousands of
Christians, who had either lived in miserable subjection to the Moors,
or in desolate independency in the mountains, took shelter under the
protection of Count Henry. Great multitudes of the Moors also chose
rather to submit, than be exposed to the severities and the continual
feuds and seditions of their own governors. These advantages, added to
the great fertility of the soil of Henry’s dominions, will account for
the numerous armies, and the frequent wars of the first sovereigns of
Portugal.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[67:3](lusbk03.htm#fr_198.md) Camoëns, in making
the founder of the Portuguese monarchy a younger son of the King of
Hungary, has followed the old chronologist Galvan. The Spanish and
Portuguese historians differ widely in their accounts of the parentage
of this gallant stranger. Some bring him from Constantinople, and others
from the house of Lorraine. But the <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>
clearest and most probable account of him is in the chronicle of Fleury,
wherein is preserved a fragment of French history, written by a
Benedictine monk in the beginning of the twelfth century, and in the
time of Count Henry. By this it appears, that he was a younger son of
Henry, the only son of Robert, the first duke of Burgundy, who was a
younger brother of Henry I. of France. Fanshaw having an eye to this
history, has taken the unwarrantable liberty to alter the fact as
mentioned by his author.

*Amongst these Henry, saith the history,  
A younger son of France, and a brave prince,  
Had Portugal in lot. ----------  
And the same king did his own daughter tie  
To him in wedlock, to infer from thence  
His firmer love*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nor are the
historians agreed on the birth of Donna Teresa, the spouse of Count
Henry. Brandam, and other Portuguese historians, are at great pains to
prove she was the legitimate daughter of Alonzo and the beautiful Ximena
de Guzman. But it appears from the more authentic chronicle of Fleury,
that Ximena was only his concubine. And it is evident from all the
historians, that Donna Urraca, the heiress of her father’s kingdom, was
younger than her half-sister, the wife of Count Henry.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[69:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_203.md) Don Alonzo Enriquez,
son of Count Henry, had only entered into his third year when his father
died. His mother assumed the reins of government, and appointed Don
Fernando Perez de Traba to be her minister. When the young prince was in
his eighteenth year, some of the nobility, who either envied the power
of Don Perez, or suspected his intention to marry the queen, and exclude
the lawful heir, easily persuaded the young Count to take arms, and
assume the sovereignty. A battle ensued, in which the prince was
victorious. Teresa, it is said, retired into the castle of Legonaso,
where she was taken prisoner by her son, who condemned her to perpetual
imprisonment, and ordered chains to be put upon her legs. That Don
Alonso made war against his mother, vanquished her party, and that she
died in prison about two years after, A.D. 1130, are certain. But the
cause of the war, that his mother was married to, or intended to marry,
Don Perez, and that she was put in chains, are uncertain.

fall was changed into a lark.

in Xenophon, upon which perhaps Camoëns had his eye. Επεὶ δέ ἒληξεν ἡ
μάχη, παρῆν ἰδεἱν την μέν γῆν αἵματι πεφυρμένην, &c. "When the battle
was over, one might behold through the whole extent of the field the
ground purpled with blood; the bodies of friends and enemies stretched
over each other, the shields pierced, the spears broken, and the drawn
swords, some scattered on the earth, some plunged in the bosoms of the
slain, and some yet grasped in the hands of the dead soldiers."

<span id="fn_216"></span>[75:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_218.md) This memorable
battle was fought in the plains of *Ourique*, in 1139. The engagement
lasted six hours; the Moors were totally routed with incredible
slaughter. On the field of battle Alonzo was proclaimed King of
Portugal. The Portuguese writers have given many fabulous accounts of
this victory. Some affirm that the Moorish army amounted to 380,000,
others, 480,000, and others swell it to 600,000, whereas Don Alonzo’s
did not exceed 13,000. Miracles must also be added. Alonzo, they tell
us, being in great perplexity, sat down to comfort his mind by the
perusal of the Holy Scriptures. Having read the story of Gideon, he sunk
into a deep sleep, in which he saw a very old man in a remarkable dress
come into his tent, and assure him of victory. His chamberlain coming
in, awoke him, and told him there was an old man very importunate to
speak with him. Don Alonzo ordered him to be brought in, and no sooner
saw him than he knew him to be the old man whom he had seen in his
dream. This venerable person acquainted him that he was a fisherman, and
had led a life of penance for sixty years on an adjacent rock, where it
had been revealed to him, that if the count marched his army the next
morning, as soon as he heard a certain bell ring, he should receive the
strongest assurance of victory. Accordingly, at the ringing of the bell,
the count put his army in motion, and suddenly beheld in the eastern sky
the figure of the cross, and Christ upon it, who promised him a complete
victory, and commanded him to accept the title of king, if it were
offered him by the army. The same writers add, that as a standing
memorial of this miraculous event, Don Alonzo changed the arms which his
father had given, of a cross azure in a field argent, for five
escutcheons, each charged with five bezants, in memory of the wounds of
Christ. Others assert, that he gave, in a field argent, five escutcheons
azure in the form of a cross, each charged with five  bezants argent,
placed saltierwise, with a point sable, in memory of five wounds he
himself received, and of five Moorish kings slain in the battle. There
is an old record, said to be written by Don Alonzo, in <span
id="page_76">p. 76</span> which the story of the vision is related upon
his majesty’s oath. The Spanish critics, however, have discovered many
inconsistencies in it. They find the language intermixed with phrases
not then in use: and it bears the date of the year of our Lord, at a
time when that era had not been introduced into Spain.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[76:2](lusbk03.htm#fr_220.md) The tradition, that
Lisbon was built by Ulysses, and thence called *Olyssipolis*, is as

landed a colony of Trojans in England, and gave the name of Britannia to
the island.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[76:3](lusbk03.htm#fr_221.md) The conquest of
Lisbon was of the utmost importance to the <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> infant monarchy. It is one of the finest ports in the world,
and before the invention of cannon, was of great strength. The old
Moorish wall was flanked by seventy-seven towers, was about six miles in
length, and fourteen in circumference. When besieged by Don Alonzo,
according to some, it was garrisoned by an army of 200,000 men. This is
highly incredible. However, that it was strong and well garrisoned is
certain, as also that Alonzo owed the conquest of it to a fleet of
adventurers, who were going to the Holy Land, the greater part of whom
were English. One Udal op Rhys, in his tour through Portugal, says, that
Alonzo gave them Almada, on the side of the Tagus opposite to Lisbon,
and that Villa Franca was peopled by them, which they called Cornualla,
either in honour of their native country, or from the rich meadows in
its neighbourhood, where immense herds of cattle are kept, as in the
English Cornwall.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[80:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_227.md) As already observed,
there is no authentic proof that Don Alonzo used such severity to his
mother as to put her in chains. Brandan says it was reported that Don
Alonzo was born with both his legs growing together, and that he was
cured by the prayers of his tutor, Egas Nunio. Legendary as this may
appear, this however is deducible from it, that from his birth there was
something amiss about his legs. When he was prisoner to his son-in-law,
Don Fernando, king of Leon, he recovered his liberty ere his leg, which
was fractured in the battle, was restored, on condition that as soon as
he was able to mount on horseback, he should come to Leon, and in person
do homage for his dominions. This condition, so contrary to his
coronation agreement, he found means to avoid. He ever after affected to
drive in a calash, and would never mount on horseback more. The
superstitious of those days ascribed this infirmity to the curses of his
mother.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[86:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_243.md) Camoëns, who was
quite an enthusiast for the honour of his country, has in this instance
disguised the truth of history. Don Sancho was by no means the weak
prince here represented, nor did the miseries of his reign proceed from
himself. The clergy were the sole authors of his, and the public,
calamities. The Roman See was then in the height of its power, which it
exerted in the most tyrannical manner. The ecclesiastical courts had
long claimed the sole right to try an ecclesiastic: and, to prohibit a
priest to say mass for a twelve-month, was by the brethren, his judges,
esteemed a sufficient punishment for murder, or any other capital crime.
Alonzo II., the father of Don Sancho, attempted to establish the
authority of the king’s courts of justice over the offending clergy. For
this the Archbishop of Braga excommunicated Gonzalo Mendez, the
chancellor; and Honorius, the pope, excommunicated the king, and put his
dominions under an interdict. The exterior offices of religion were
suspended, the people fell into the utmost dissoluteness of manners;
Mohammedanism made great advances, and public confusion everywhere
prevailed. By this policy the Church constrained the nobility to urge
the king to a full submission to the papal chair. While a negotiation
for this purpose was on foot Alonzo died, and left his son to struggle
with an enraged and powerful clergy. Don Sancho was just, affable,
brave, and an enamoured husband. On this last virtue faction first fixed
its envenomed fangs. The queen was accused of arbitrary influence over
her husband; and, according to the superstition of that age, she was
believed to have disturbed his senses by an enchanted draught. Such of
the nobility as declared in the king’s favour were stigmatized, and
rendered odious, as the creatures of the queen. The confusions which
ensued were fomented by Alonso, Earl of Bologna, the king’s brother, by
whom the king was accused as the author of them. In short, by the
assistance of the clergy and Pope Innocent IV., Sancho was deposed, and
soon after died at Toledo. The beautiful queen, Donna Mencia, was seized
upon, and conveyed away by one Raymond Portocarrero, and was never heard
of more. Such are the triumphs of faction!

their graves on the approach of so terrible an army. The French
translator, contrary to the original, ascribes this terror to the ghost
of only one prince, by which this stroke of Camoëns, in the spirit of
Shakespeare, is reduced to a piece of unmeaning frippery.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[92:2](lusbk03.htm#fr_259.md) This unfortunate
lady, Donna Inez de Castro, was the daughter of a Castilian gentleman,
who had taken refuge in the court of Portugal. Her beauty and
accomplishments attracted the regard of Don Pedro, the king’s eldest
son, a prince of a brave and noble disposition. La Neufville, Le Clede,
and other historians, assert that she was privately married to the
prince ere she had any share in his bed. Nor was his conjugal fidelity
less remarkable than the ardour of his passion. Afraid, however, of his
father’s resentment, the severity of whose temper he knew, his
intercourse with Donna Inez passed at the court as an intrigue of
gallantry. On the accession of Don Pedro the Cruel to the throne of
Castile many of the disgusted nobility were kindly received by Don
Pedro, through the interest of his beloved Inez. The favour shown to
these Castilians gave great uneasiness to the politicians. A thousand
evils were foreseen from the prince’s attachment to his Castilian
mistress: even the murder of his children by his deceased spouse, the
princess Constantia, was surmised; and the enemies of Donna Inez,
finding the king willing to listen, omitted no opportunity to increase
his resentment against the unfortunate lady. The prince was about his
twenty-eighth year when his amour with his beloved Inez commenced.

by some critics, that Milton on every occasion is fond of expressing his
admiration of music, particularly of the song of the nightingale, and
the full woodland choir. If in the same manner we are to judge of the
favourite taste of Homer, we shall find it of a less delicate kind. He
is continually describing the feast, the huge chine, the savoury viands
on the glowing coals, and the foaming bowl. The ruling passion of
Camoëns is also strongly marked in his writings. One may venture to
affirm, that there is no poem of equal length that abounds with so many
impassioned encomiums on the fair sex as the Lusiad. The genius of
Camoëns seems never so pleased as when he is painting the variety of
female charms; he feels all the magic of their allurements, and riots in
his descriptions of the happiness and miseries attendant on the passion
of love. As he wrote from his feelings, these parts of his works have
been particularly honoured with the attention of the world.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[96:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_263.md) To give the
character of Alphonso IV. will throw light on this inhuman transaction.
He was an undutiful son, an unnatural brother, and a cruel father, a
great and fortunate warrior, diligent in the execution of the laws, and
a Macchiavellian politician. His maxim was that of the Jesuits; so that
a contemplated good might be attained, he cared not how villainous might
be the means employed. When the enemies of Inez had persuaded him that
her death was necessary to the welfare of the state, he took a journey
to Coimbra, that he might see the lady, when the prince, his son, was
absent on a hunting party. Donna Inez, with her children, threw herself
at his feet. The king was moved with the distress of the beautiful
suppliant, when his three counsellors, Alvaro Gonsalez, Diego Lopez
Pacheco, and Pedro Coello, reproaching him for his disregard to the
state, he relapsed to his former resolution. She was then dragged from
his presence, and brutally murdered by the hands of his three
counsellors, who immediately returned to the king with their daggers
reeking with the innocent blood of his daughter-in-law. Alonzo, says La
Neufville, avowed the horrid assassination, as if be had done nothing of
which he ought to be ashamed.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[98:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_268.md) At an old royal
castle near Mondego, there is a rivulet called the fountain of Amours.
According to tradition, it was here that Don Pedro resided with his
beloved Inez. The fiction of Camoëns, founded on the popular name of the
rivulet, is in the spirit of Homer.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[98:2](lusbk03.htm#fr_269.md) When the prince was
informed of the death of his beloved Inez, he was transported into the
most violent fury. He took arms against his father. The country between
the rivers Minho and Doura was laid desolate: but, by the interposition
of the queen and the Archbishop of Braga, the prince relented, and the
further horrors of a civil war were prevented. Don Alonzo was not only
reconciled to his son, but laboured by every means to oblige him, and to
efface from his memory the injury and insult he had received. The
prince, however, still continued to discover the strongest marks of
affection and grief. When he succeeded to the crown, one of his first
acts was a treaty with the King of Castile, whereby each monarch engaged
to give up such malcontents as should take refuge in each other’s
dominions. In consequence of this, Pedro Coello and Alvaro Gonsalez,
who, on the death of Alonzo had fled to Castile, were sent prisoners to
Don Pedro. Diego Pacheco, the third murderer, made his escape. The other
two were put to death with the most exquisite tortures, and most justly
merited, if torture is in any instance to be allowed. After this tire
king, Don Pedro, summoned an assembly of the states at Cantanedes. Here,
in the presence of the Pope’s nuncio, Ire solemnly swore on the holy
Gospels, that having obtained a dispensation from Rome, he had secretly,
at Braganza, espoused the Lady Inez de Castro, in the presence of the
Bishop of Guarda, and of his master of the wardrobe; both of whom
confirmed the truth of the oath. The Pope’s Bull, containing the
dispensation, was published; the body of Inez was lifted from the grave,
was placed on a magnificent throne, and with the proper regalia, crowned
Queen of Portugal. The nobility did homage to her skeleton, and kissed
the bones of her hand. The corpse was then interred at the royal
monastery of Alcobaca, with a pomp before unknown in Portugal, and with
all the honours due to a queen. Her monument is still extant, where her
statue is adorned with the diadem and the royal robe. This, with the
legitimation of her children, and the care he took of all who had been
in her service, consoled Trim in some degree, and rendered him more
conversable than he had hitherto been; but the cloud which the death of
Inez brought <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> over the natural
cheerfulness of his temper, was never totally dispersed.--A circumstance
strongly characteristic of the rage of his resentment must not be
omitted. When the murderers were brought before him, he was so
transported with indignation, that he struck Pedro Coello several blows
on the face with the shaft of his whip.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[99:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_270.md) *Pedro the
Just*.--History cannot afford an instance of any prince who has a more
eminent claim to the title of ,just than Pedro I. His diligence to
correct every abuse was indefatigable, and when guilt was proved his
justice was inexorable. He was dreadful to the evil, and beloved by the
good, for he respected no persons, and his inflexible severity never
digressed from the line of strict justice. An anecdote or two will throw
some light on his character. A priest having killed a mason, the king
dissembled his knowledge of the crime, and left the issue to the
ecclesiastical court, where the priest was punished by one year’s
suspension from saying mass. The king on this privately ordered the
mason’s son to revenge the murder of his father. The young man obeyed,
was apprehended, and condemned to death. When his sentence was to be
confirmed by the king, Pedro enquired, what was the young man’s trade.
He was answered, that he followed his father’s. "Well then," said the
king, I shall commute his punishment, and interdict him from meddling
with stone or mortar for a twelve-month." After this he fully
established the authority of the king’s courts over the clergy, whom he
punished with death when their crimes were capital. When solicited to
refer the causes of such criminals to a higher tribunal, he would answer
very calmly, "That is what I intend to do: I will send them to the
highest of all tribunals, to that of their Maker and mine." Against
adulterers he was <span id="page_100">p. 100</span> particularly severe,
often declaring it as his opinion, that conjugal infidelity was the
source of the greatest evils, and that therefore to restrain it was the
interest and duty of the sovereign. Though the fate of his beloved Inez
chagrined and soured his temper, he was so far from being naturally
sullen or passionate, that he was rather of a gay and sprightly
disposition; he was affable and easy of access; delighted in music and
dancing; was a lover of learning, a man of letters, and an elegant
poet.--Vide Le Clede, Mariana, Faria.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[100:1](lusbk03.htm#fr_271.md) This lady, named
Leonora de Tellez, was the wife of Don Juan Lorenzo Acugna, a nobleman
of one of the most distinguished families in Portugal. After a sham
process this marriage was dissolved, and the king privately espoused to
her, though, at this time, he was publicly married by proxy to Donna
Leonora of Arragon. A dangerous insurrection, headed by one Velasquez, a
tailor, drove the king and his adulterous bride from Lisbon. Soon after,
he caused his marriage to be publicly celebrated in the province of
Entre Douro e Minho. Henry, king of Castile, being informed of the
general discontent that reigned in Portugal, marched a formidable army
into that kingdom, to revenge the injury offered to some of his
subjects, whose ships had been unjustly seized at Lisbon. The desolation
hinted at by Camoëns ensued. After the subjects of both kingdoms had
severely suffered, the two kings ended the war, much to their mutual
satisfaction, by an intermarriage of their illegitimate children.

notes on this book, it may not be unnecessary to observe that Camoëns,
in this episode, has happily adhered to a principal rule of the Epopea.
To paint the manners and characters of the age in which the action is
placed, is as requisite in the epic poem as it is to preserve the unity
of the character of an individual. That gallantry of bravery and
romantic cast of the military adventures, which characterised the
Spaniards and Portuguese during the Moorish wars, is happily supported
by Camoëns in its most just and striking colours. In storming the
citadel of Arzila, the Count de Marialva, a brave old officer, lost his
life. The king, leading his only son, the Prince Don Juan, to the body
of the count, while the blood yet streamed from his wounds: "Behold," he
cried, "that great man! May God grant you, my son, to imitate his
virtues. May your honour, like his, be complete!"
