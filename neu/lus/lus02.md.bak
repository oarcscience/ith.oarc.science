### THE LIFE OF CAMOËNS,

#### BY WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.

WHEN the glory of the arms of Portugal had reached its meridian
splendour, Nature, as if in pity of the literary rudeness of that
nation, produced a great poet to record the numberless actions of high
spirit performed by his countrymen. Except Osorius, the historians of
Portugal are little better than dry journalists. But it is not their
inelegance which rendered the poet necessary. It is the peculiar nature
of poetry to give a colouring to heroic actions, and to express
indignation against breaches of honour, in a spirit which at once seizes
the heart of the man of feeling, and carries with it instantaneous
conviction. The brilliant actions of the Portuguese form the great hinge
which opened the door to the most important alterations in the civil
history of mankind. And to place these actions in the light and
enthusiasm of poetry--that enthusiasm which particularly assimilates the
youthful breast to its own fires--was Luis de Camoëns, the poet of
Portugal, born.

Different cities have claimed the honour of his birth. But according to
N. Antonio, and Manuel Correa, his intimate friend, this event happened
at Lisbon in 1517. <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) His family was of
considerable note, and originally Spanish. In 1370 Vasco Perez de
Caamans, disgusted at the court of Castile, fled to that of Lisbon,
where King Ferdinand immediately admitted him into his council, and gave
him the lordships of Sardoal, Punnete, Marano, Amendo, and other
considerable lands; a certain proof of the eminence of his rank and
abilities. In the war for the succession, which broke

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

out on the death of Ferdinand, Caamans sided with the King of Castile,
and was killed in the battle of Aljabarrota. But though John I., the
victor, seized a great part of his estate, his widow, the daughter of
Gonsalo Tereyro, grand master of the Order of Christ, and general of the
Portuguese army, was not reduced beneath her rank. She had three sons,
who took the name of Camoëns. The family of the eldest intermarried with
the first nobility of Portugal, and even, according to Castera, with the
blood royal. But the family of the second brother, whose fortune was
slender, had the superior honour to produce the author of the Lusiad.

Early in life the misfortunes of the poet began. In his infancy, Simon
Vaz de Camoëns, his father, commander of a vessel, was shipwrecked at
Goa, where, with his life, the greatest part of his fortune was lost.
His mother, however, Anne de Macedo of Santarem, provided for the
education of her son Luis, at the University of Coimbra. What he
acquired there his works discover; an intimacy with the classics, equal
to that of a Scaliger, but directed by the taste of a Milton or a Pope.

When he left the university he appeared at court. He was a polished
scholar and very handsome, <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md) possessing
a most engaging mien and address, with the finest complexion, which,
added to the natural ardour and gay vivacity of his disposition,
rendered him an accomplished gentleman. Courts are the scenes of
intrigue, and intrigue was fashionable at Lisbon. But the particulars of
the amours of Camoëns rest unknown. This only appears: he hard aspired
above his rank, for he was banished from the court; and in several of
his sonnets he ascribes this misfortune to love.

He now retired to his mother’s friends at Santarem. Here he renewed his
studies, and began his poem on the discovery of India. John III. at this
time prepared an armament against Africa. Camoëns, tired of his
inactive, obscure life, went to Ceuta in this expedition, and greatly
distinguished his valour in several *rencontres*. In a naval engagement
with the Moors in the Straits of Gibraltar, Camoëns, in the conflict of
boarding, where he was

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

among the foremost, lost his right eye. Yet neither the hurry of actual
service, nor the dissipation of the camp, could stifle his genius. He
continued his *Lusiadas*; and several of his most beautiful sonnets were
written in Africa, while, as he expresses it,

"One hand the pen, and one the sword employ’d."

The fame of his valour had now reached the Court, and he obtained
permission to return to Lisbon. But while he solicited an establishment
which he had merited in the ranks of battle, the malignity of evil
tongues (as he calls it in one of his letters) was injuriously poured
upon him. Though the bloom of his early youth was effaced by several
years’ residence under the scorching sky of Africa, and though altered
by the loss of an eye, his presence gave uneasiness to the gentlemen of
some families of the first rank where he had formerly visited. Jealousy
is the characteristic of the Spanish and Portuguese; its resentment
knows no bounds, and Camoëns now found it prudent to banish himself from
his native country. Accordingly, in 1553 he sailed for India, with a
resolution never to return. As the ship left the Tagus he exclaimed, in
the words of the sepulchral monument of Scipio Africanus, "*Ingrata
patria, non possidebis ossa mea*!" (Ungrateful country, thou shalt not
possess my bones!) But he knew not what evils in the East would awaken
the remembrance of his native fields.

When Camoëns arrived in India, an expedition was ready to sail to
revenge the King of Cochin on the King of Pimenta. Without any rest on
shore after his long voyage, he joined this armament, and, in the
conquest of the Alagada Islands, displayed his usual bravery. But his
modesty, perhaps, is his greatest praise. In a sonnet he mentions this
expedition: "We went to punish the King of Pimenta," says he, "*e
succedeones bem*" (and we succeeded well). When it is considered that
the poet bore no inconsiderable share in the victory, no ode can
conclude more elegantly, more happily than this.

In the year following, he attended Manuel de Vasconcello in an
expedition to the Red Sea. Here, says Faria, as Camoëns had no use for
his sword, he employed his pen. Nor was his activity confined to the
fleet or camp. He visited Mount Felix, and the adjacent inhospitable
regions of Africa, which he so strongly pictures in the Lusiad, and in
one of his little pieces, where he laments the absence of his mistress.

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

When he returned to Goa, he enjoyed a tranquility which enabled him to
bestow his attention on his epic poem. But this serenity was
interrupted, perhaps by his own imprudence. He wrote some satires which
gave offence, and by order of the viceroy, Francisco Barreto, he was
banished to China.

Men of poor abilities are more conscious of their embarrassment and
errors than is commonly believed. When men of this kind are in power,
they affect great solemnity; and every expression of the most distant
tendency to lessen their dignity is held as the greatest of crimes.
Conscious, also, how severely the man of genius can hurt their interest,
they bear an instinctive antipathy against him, are uneasy even in his
company, and, on the slightest pretence, are happy to drive him from
them. Camoëns was thus situated at Goa; and never was there a fairer
field for satire than the rulers of India at that time afforded. Yet,
whatever esteem the prudence of Camoëns may lose in our idea, the
nobleness of his disposition will doubly gain. And, so conscious was he
of his real integrity and innocence, that in one of his sonnets he
wishes no other revenge on Barreto than that the cruelty of his exile
should ever be remembered. <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

The accomplishments and manners of Camoëns soon found him friends,
though under the disgrace of banishment. He was appointed Commissary of
the estates of deceased persons, in the island of Macao, a Portuguese
settlement on the coast of China. Here he continued his Lusiad; and
here, also, after five years residence, he acquired a fortune, though
small, yet equal to his wishes. Don Constantine de Braganza was now
Viceroy of India; and Camoëns, desirous to return to Goa, resigned his
charge. In a ship, freighted by himself, he set sail, but was
shipwrecked in the gulf near the mouth of the river Meekhaun, in Cochin
China. All he had acquired was lost in the waves: his poems, which he
held in one hand, while he swam with the other, were all he found
himself possessed of when he stood friendless on the unknown shore. But
the natives gave him a most humane reception; this he has immortalized

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

in the prophetic song in the tenth Lusiad; <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) and in the

seventh he tells us that here he lost the wealth which satisfied his
wishes.

*Agora da esperança ja adquirida*, etc.

"Now blest with all the wealth fond hope could crave,  
Soon I beheld that wealth beneath the wave  
For ever lost;--  
My life like Judah’s Heaven-doom’d king of yore  
By miracle prolong’d."

On the banks of the Meekhaun, he wrote his beautiful paraphrase of the
137th Psalm, where the Jews, in the finest strain of poetry, are
represented as hanging their harps on the willows by the rivers of
Babylon, and weeping their exile from their native country. Here Camoëns
continued some time, till an opportunity offered to carry him to Goa.
When he arrived at that city, Don Constantine de Braganza, the viceroy,
whose characteristic was politeness, admitted him into intimate
friendship, and Camoëns was happy till Count Redondo assumed the
government. Those who had formerly procured the banishment of the
satirist were silent while Constantine was in power. But now they
exerted all their arts against him. Redondo, when he entered on office,
pretended to be the friend of Camoëns; yet, with the most unfeeling
indifference, he suffered the innocent man to be thrown into the common
prison. After all the delay of bringing witnesses, Camoëns, in a public
trial, fully refuted every accusation against his conduct while
commissary at Macao, and his enemies were loaded with ignominy and
reproach. But Camoëns had some creditors; and these detained him in
prison a considerable time, till the gentlemen of Goa began to be
ashamed that a man of his singular merit should experience such
treatment among them. He was set at liberty; and again he assumed the
profession of arms, and received the allowance of a gentleman-volunteer,

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

a character at that time common in Portuguese India.

Soon after, Pedro Barreto (appointed governor of the fort of Sofála), by
high promises, allured the poet to attend him thither. The governor of a
distant fort, in a barbarous country, shares in some measure the fate of
an exile. Yet, though the only motive of Barreto was, in this unpleasant
situation, to retain the conversation of Camoëns at his table, it was
his least care to render the life of his guest . agreeable. Chagrined
with his treatment, and a considerable time having elapsed in vain
dependence upon Barreto, Camoëns resolved to return to his native
country. A ship, on the homeward voyage, at this time touched at Sofála,
and several gentlemen <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) who were on
board were desirous that Camoëns should accompany them. But this the
governor ungenerously endeavoured to prevent, and charged him with a
debt for board. Anthony de Cabral, however, and Hector de Sylveyra, paid
the demand, and Camoëns, says Faria, and the honour of Barreto were sold
together.

After an absence of sixteen years, Camoëns, in 1569, returned to Lisbon,
unhappy even in his arrival, for the pestilence then raged in that city,
and prevented his publishing for three years. At last, in 1572, he
printed his Lusiad, which, in the opening of the first book, in a most
elegant turn of compliment, he addressed to his prince, King Sebastian,
then in his eighteenth year. The king, says the French translator, was
so pleased with his merit, that he gave the author a pension of 4000
reals, on condition that he should reside at court. But this salary,
says the same writer, was withdrawn by Cardinal Henry, who succeeded to
the crown of Portugal, lost by Sebastian at the battle of Alcazar.

But this story of the pension is very doubtful. Correa and other
contemporary authors do not mention it, though some late writers have
given credit to it. If Camoëns, however, had a pension, it is highly
probable that Henry deprived him of it. While Sebastian was devoted to
the chase, his grand-uncle, the cardinal, presided at the council board,
and Camoëns, in his address to the king, which closes the Lusiad,
advises him to exclude the clergy from State affairs. It was easy to see
that the cardinal was here intended. And Henry, besides, was one of
those statesmen

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

who can perceive no benefit resulting to the public from elegant
literature. But it ought also to be added in completion of his
character, that under the narrow views and weak hands of this Henry, the
kingdom of Portugal fell into utter ruin; and on his death, which closed
a short inglorious reign, the crown of Lisbon, after a faint struggle,
was annexed to that of Spain. Such was the degeneracy of the Portuguese,
a degeneracy lamented in vain by Camoëns, whose observation of it was
imputed to him as a crime.

Though the great <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) patron of
theological literature--a species the reverse of that of
Camoëns--certain it is, that the author of the Lusiad was utterly
neglected by Henry, under whose inglorious reign he died in all the
misery of poverty. By some,

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

it is said, he died in an almshouse. It appears, however, that he had
not even the certainty of subsistence which these houses provide. He had
a black servant, who had grown old with him, and who had long
experienced his master’s humanity. This grateful dependant, a native of
Java, who, according to some writers, saved his master’s life in the
unhappy shipwreck where he lost his effects, begged in the streets of
Lisbon for the only man in Portugal on whom God had bestowed those
talents which have a tendency to erect the spirit of a downward age. To
the eye of a careful observer, the fate of Camoëns throws great light on
that of his country, and will appear strictly connected with it. The
same ignorance, the same degenerate spirit, which suffered Camoëns to
depend on his share of the alms begged in the streets by his old hoary
servant--the same spirit which caused this, sank the kingdom of Portugal
into the most abject vassalage ever experienced by a conquered nation.
While the grandees of Portugal were blind to the ruin which impended
over them, Camoëns beheld it with a pungency of grief which hastened his
end. In one of his letters he has these remarkable words, "*Em fim
accaberey à vida, e verràm todos que fuy afeiçoada a minho patria*,"
etc.--"I am ending the course of my life, the world will witness how I
have loved my country. I have returned, not only to die in her bosom,
but to die with her." In another letter, written a little before his
death, he thus, yet with dignity, complains, "Who has seen on so small a
theatre as my poor bed, such a representation of the disappointments of
Fortune. And I, as if she could not herself subdue me, I have yielded
and become of her party; for it were wild audacity to hope to surmount
such accumulated evils."

In this unhappy situation, in 1579, in his sixty-second year, the year
after the fatal defeat of Don Sebastian, died Luis de Camoëns, the
greatest literary genius ever produced by Portugal; in martial courage
and spirit of honour nothing inferior to her greatest heroes. And in a
manner suitable to the poverty in which he died was he buried. Soon
after, however, many epitaphs honoured his memory; the greatness of his
merit was universally confessed, and his Lusiad was translated into
various languages. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) Nor ought it to
be omitted, that the man so

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

miserably neglected by the weak king Henry, was earnestly enquired after
by Philip of Spain when he assumed the crown of Lisbon. When Philip
heard that Camoëns was dead, both his words and his countenance
expressed his disappointment and grief.

From the whole tenor of his life, and from that spirit which glows
throughout the Lusiad, it evidently appears that the courage and manners
of Camoëns flowed from true greatness and dignity of soul. Though his
polished conversation was often courted by the great, he appears so
distant from servility that his imprudence in this respect is by some
highly blamed. Yet the instances of it by no means deserve that severity
of censure with which some writers have condemned him. Unconscious of
the feelings of a Camoëns, they knew not that a carelessness in securing
the smiles of fortune, and an open honesty of indignation, are almost
inseparable from the enthusiasm of fine imagination. The truth is, the
man possessed of true genius feels his greatest happiness in the
pursuits and excursions of the mind, and therefore makes an estimate of
things very different from that of him whose unremitting attention is
devoted to his external interest. The profusion of Camoëns is also
censured. Had he dissipated the wealth he acquired at Macao, his
profusion indeed had been criminal; but it does not appear that he ever
enjoyed any other opportunity of acquiring independence. But Camoëns was
unfortunate, and the unfortunate man is viewed--

          "Through the dim shade his fate casts o’er him:  
A shade that spreads its evening darkness o’er  
His brightest virtues, while it shows his foibles  
Crowding and obvious as the midnight stars,  
Which, in the sunshine of prosperity  
Never had been descried."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yet, after the
strictest discussion, when all the causes are weighed together, the
misfortunes of Camoëns will appear the fault and disgrace of his age and
country, and not of the man. His talents

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

would have secured him an apartment in the palace of Augustus, but such
talents are a curse to their possessor in an illiterate nation. In a
beautiful, digressive exclamation at the end of the Lusiad, he affords
us a striking view of the neglect which he experienced. Having mentioned
how the greatest heroes of antiquity revered and cherished the muse, he
thus characterizes the nobility of his own age and country.

"Alas! on Tago’s hapless shore alone  
The muse is slighted, and her charms unknown;  
For this, no Virgil here attunes the lyre,  
No Homer here awakes the hero’s fire;  
Unheard, in vain their native poet sings,  
And cold neglect weighs down the muse’s wings."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In such an age,
and among such a barbarous nobility, what but wretched neglect could be
the fate of a Camoëns! After all, however, if he was imprudent on his
first appearance at the court of John III.; if the honesty of his
indignation led him into great imprudence, as certainly it did, when at
Goa he satirised the viceroy and the first persons in power; yet let it
also be remembered, that "The gifts of imagination bring the heaviest
task upon the vigilance of reason; and to bear those faculties with
unerring rectitude, or invariable propriety, requires a degree of
firmness and of cool attention, which doth not always attend the higher
gifts of the mind. Yet, difficult as nature herself seems to have
rendered the task of regularity to genius, it is the supreme consolation
of dullness and of folly to point with Gothic triumph to those excesses
which are the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed. Perfectly
unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity for the
consistency of their conduct, they plume themselves on an imaginary
virtue which has its origin in what is really their disgrace.--Let such,
if such dare approach the shrine of Camoëns, withdraw to a respectful
distance; and should they behold the ruins of genius, or the weakness of
an exalted mind, let them be taught to lament that nature has left the
noblest of her works imperfect." <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[xiv:\*](lus02.htm#fr_5.md) A document in the
archives of the Portuguese India House, on which Lord Strangford relies,
places it in 1524, or the following year.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[xvi:\*](lus02.htm#fr_6.md) The French translator
gives us so fine a description of the person of Camoëns, that it seems
borrowed from the Fairy Tales. It is universally agreed, however, that
he was handsome, and had a most engaging mien and address. He is thus
described by Nicolas Antonio, "*Mediocri statura fuit, et carne plena,
capillis usque ad croci colorem flavescentibus, maxime in juventute.
Eminebat ei frons, et medius nasus, cætera longus, et in fine
crassiusculus*."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[xviii:\*](lus02.htm#fr_7.md) Castera tells us,
"that posterity by no means enters into the resentment of our poet, and
that the Portuguese historians make glorious mention of Barreto, who was
a man of true merit." The Portuguese historians, however, knew not what
true merit was. The brutal, uncommercial wars of Sampayo are by them
mentioned as much more glorious than the less bloody campaigns of a
Nunio, which established commerce and empire.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[xix:\*](lus02.htm#fr_8.md) Having named the Mecon,
or Meekhaun, a river of Cochin China, he says

*Este recebera placido, e brando,  
No seu regaço o Canto, que molhado*, etc.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Literally thus:
"On his gentle hospitable bosom (*sic* brando *poeticé*) shall he
receive the song, wet from woful unhappy shipwreck, escaped from
destroying tempests, from ravenous dangers, the effect of the unjust
sentence upon him, whose lyre shall be more renowned than enriched."
When Camoëns was commissary, he visited the islands of Ternate, Timor,
etc., described in the Lusiad.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[xx:\*](lus02.htm#fr_9.md) According to the
Portuguese Life of Camoëns, prefixed to Gedron’s, the best edition of
his works, Diogo de Couto, the historian, one of the company in this
homeward voyage, wrote annotations upon the Lusiad, under the eye of its
author. But these, unhappily, have never appeared in public.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[xxi:\*](lus02.htm#fr_10.md) Cardinal Henry’s
patronage of learning and learned men is mentioned with cordial esteem
by the Portuguese writers. Happily they also tell us what that learning
was. It was to him the Romish Friars of the East transmitted their
childish forgeries of inscriptions and miracles. He corresponded with
them, directed their labours, and received the first accounts of their
success. Under his patronage it was discovered, that St. Thomas ordered
the Indians to worship the cross; and that the Moorish tradition of
Perimal (who, having embraced Mohammedanism, divided his kingdom among
his officers, whom he rendered tributary to the Zamorim) was a malicious
misrepresentation, for that Perimal, having turned Christian, resigned
his kingdom and became a monk. Such was the learning patronized by
Henry, under whose auspices that horrid tribunal, the Inquisition, was
erected at Lisbon, where he himself long presided as Inquisitor-General.
Nor was he content with this: he established an Inquisition, also, at
Goa, and sent a whole apparatus of holy fathers to form a court of
inquisitors, to suppress the Jews and reduce the native Christians to
the see of Rome. Nor must the treatment experienced by Buchanan at
Lisbon be here omitted. John III., earnest to promote the cultivation of
polite literature among his subjects, engaged Buchanan, the most elegant
Latinist, perhaps, of modern times, to teach philosophy and the *belles
lettres* at Lisbon. But the design of the monarch was soon frustrated by
the clergy, at the head of whom was Henry, afterwards king. Buchanan was
committed to prison, because it was alleged that he had eaten flesh in
Lent, and because in his early youth, at St. Andrew’s in Scotland, he
had written a satire against the Franciscans; for which, however, ere he
would venture to Lisbon, John had promised absolute indemnity. John,
with much difficulty, procured his release from a loathsome jail, but
could not effect his restoration as a teacher. No, he only changed his
prison, for Buchanan was sent to a monastery "to be instructed by the
monks," of the men of letters patronized by Henry. These are thus
characterized by their pupil Buchanan,--*nec inhumanis, nec malis, sed
omnis religions ignaris:* "Not uncivilized, not flagitious, but ignorant
of every religion."

<span id="fn_11"></span>[xxii:\*](lus02.htm#fr_11.md) According to Gedron,
a second edition of the Lusiad appeared in the same year with the first.
There are two Italian and four Spanish translations <span
id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span> of it. A hundred years before Castera’s
version it appeared in French. Thomas de Faria, Bp. of Targa in Africa,
translated it into Latin. Le P. Niceron says there were two other Latin
translations. It is translated, also, into Hebrew, with great elegance
and spirit, by one Luzzatto, a learned and ingenious Jew, author of
several poems in that language, who died in the Holy Land.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[xxiv:\*](lus02.htm#fr_12.md) This passage in
inverted commas is cited, with the alteration of the name only, from
Langhorne’s account of the life of William Collins.
