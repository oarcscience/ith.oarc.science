### MICKLE’S INTRODUCTION TO THE LUSIAD.

IF a concatenation of events centred in one great action--events which
gave birth to the present commercial system of the world--if these be of
the first importance in the civil history of mankind, then the Lusiad,
of all other poems, challenges the attention of the philosopher, the
politician, and the gentleman.

In contradistinction to the Iliad and the Æneid, the Paradise Lost has
been called the Epic Poem of Religion. In the same manner may the Lusiad
be named the Epic Poem of Commerce. The happy completion of the most
important designs of Henry, Duke of Viseo, prince of Portugal, to whom
Europe owes both Gama and Columbus, both the eastern and the western
worlds, constitutes the subject of this celebrated epic poem. But before
we proceed to the historical introduction necessary to elucidate a poem
founded on such an important period of history, some attention is due to
the opinion of those theorists in political philosophy who lament that
India was ever discovered, and who assert that increase of trade is only
the parent of degeneracy, and the nurse of every vice.

Much, indeed, may be urged on this side of the question; but much, also,
may be urged against every institution relative to man. Imperfection, if
not necessary to humanity, is at least the certain attendant on
everything human. Though some part of the traffic with many countries
resemble Solomon’s importation of apes and peacocks; though the
superfluities of life, the baubles of the opulent, and even the luxuries
which enervate the irresolute and administer disease, are introduced by
the intercourse of navigation, yet the extent of the benefits which
attend it are also to be considered

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

before the man of cool reason will venture to pronounce that the world
is injured, and rendered less virtuous and happy by the increase of
commerce.

If a view of the state of mankind, where commerce opens no intercourse
between nation and nation be neglected, unjust conclusions will
certainly follow. Where the state of barbarians, and of countries under
different degrees of civilization are candidly weighed, we may
reasonably expect a just decision. As evidently as the appointment of
nature gives pasture to the herds, so evidently is man born for society.
As every other animal is in its natural state when in the situation
which its instinct requires, so man, when his reason is cultivated, is
then, and only then, in the state proper to his nature. The life of the
naked savage, who feeds on acorns and sleeps like a beast in his den, is
commonly called the natural state of man; but, if there be any propriety
in this assertion, his rational faculties compose no part of his nature,
and were given not to be used. If the savage, therefore, live in a state
contrary to the appointment of nature, it must follow that he is not so
happy as nature intended him to be. And a view of his true character
will confirm this conclusion. The reveries, the fairy dreams of a
Rousseau, may figure the paradisaical life of a Hottentot, but it is
only in such dreams that the superior happiness of the barbarian exists.
The savage, it is true, is reluctant to leave his manner of life; but,
unless we allow that he is a proper judge of the modes of living, his
attachment to his own by no means proves that he is happier than he
might otherwise have been. His attachment only exemplifies the amazing
power of habit in reconciling the human breast to the most uncomfortable
situations. If the intercourse of mankind in some instances be
introductive of vice, the want of it as certainly excludes the exertion
of the noblest virtues; and, if the seeds of virtue are indeed in the
heart, they often lie dormant, and even unknown to the savage possessor.
The most beautiful description of a tribe of savages (which we may be
assured is from real life) occurs in these words: <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md) And the five spies of Dan "came to Laish,
and saw the people that were there, how they dwelt careless, after the
manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate
in the land, that might put them to shame in anything . . . ." And the
spies said to their brethren, "Arise, that we may go up against them;
for we have

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

seen the land, and, behold, it is very good. . . . And they came unto
Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them
with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire. And there was
no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business
with any man." However the happy simplicity of this society may please
the man of fine imagination, the true philosopher will view the men of
Laish with other eyes. However virtuous he may suppose one generation,
it requires an alteration of human nature to preserve the children of
the next in the same generous estrangement from the selfish
passions--from those passions which are the parents of the acts of
injustice. When his wants are easily supplied, the manners of the savage
will be simple, and often humane, for the human heart is not vicious
without objects of temptation. But these will soon occur; he that
gathers the greatest quantity of fruit will be envied by the less
industrious. The uninformed mind seems insensible of the idea of the
right of possession which the labour of acquirement gives. When want is
pressing, and the supply at hand, the only consideration with such minds
is the danger of seizing it; and where there is no magistrate to put to
shame in anything, depredation will soon display all its horrors. Let it
even be admitted that the innocence of the men of Laish could secure
them from the consequences of their own unrestrained desires, could even
this impossibility be surmounted, still are they a wretched prey to the
first invaders, and because they have no business with any man, they
will find no deliverer. While human nature is the same, the fate of
Laish will always be the fate of the weak and defenceless; and thus the
most amiable description of savage life raises in our minds the
strongest imagery of the misery and impossible continuance of such a
state. But if the view of these innocent people terminate in horror,
with what contemplation shall we behold the wilds of Africa and America?
The tribes of America, it is true, have degrees of policy greatly
superior to anything understood by the men of Laish. Great masters of
martial oratory, their popular assemblies are schools open to all their
youth. In these they not only learn the history of their nation, and
what they have to fear from the strength and designs of their enemies,
but they also imbibe the most ardent spirit of war. The arts of
stratagem are their study, and the most athletic exercises of the field
their employment and delight; and, what is their greatest praise, they
have magistrates "to put them

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

to shame. "They inflict no corporeal punishment on their countrymen, it
is true; but a reprimand from an elder, delivered in the assembly, is
esteemed by them a deeper degradation and severer punishment than any of
those too often most impolitically adopted by civilized nations. Yet,
though possessed of this advantage--an advantage impossible to exist in
a large commercial empire--and though masters of great martial policy,
their condition, upon the whole, is big with the most striking
demonstration of the misery and unnatural state of such very imperfect
civilization. "Multiply and replenish the earth" is an injunction of the
best political philosophy ever given to man. Nature has appointed man to
cultivate the earth, to increase in number by the food which its culture
gives, and by this increase of brethren to remove some, and to mitigate
all, the natural miseries of human life. But in direct opposition to
this is the political state of the wild aborigines of America. Their
lands, luxuriant in climate, are often desolate wastes, where thousands
of miles hardly support a few hundreds of savage hunters. Attachment to
their own tribe constitutes their highest idea of virtue; but this
virtue includes the most brutal depravity, makes them esteem the man of
every other tribe as an enemy, as one with whom nature had placed them
in a state of war, and had commanded to destroy. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[\*](#fn_23.md) And to this principle their customs and
ideas of honour serve as rituals and ministers. The cruelties practised
by the American savages on their prisoners of war (and war is their
chief employment) convey every idea expressed by the word diabolical,
and give a most shocking view of the degradation of human nature. But
what peculiarly completes the character of the savage is his horrible
superstition. In the most distant nations the savage is, in this
respect, the same. The terror of evil spirits continually haunts him;
his God is beheld as a relentless tyrant, and is worshipped often with
cruel rites, always with a heart full of horror and fear. In all the
numerous accounts of savage worship, one trace of filial dependence is
not to be found. The very reverse of that happy idea is the

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

hell of the ignorant mind. Nor is this barbarism confined alone to those
ignorant tribes whom we call savages. The vulgar of every country
possess it in certain degrees, proportionated to their opportunities of
conversation with the more enlightened. Sordid disposition and base
ferocity, together with the most unhappy superstition, are everywhere
the proportionate attendants of ignorance and severe want. And ignorance
and want are only removed by intercourse and the offices of society. So
self-evident are these positions, that it requires an apology for
insisting upon them; but the apology is at hand. He who has read knows
how many eminent writers, <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md) and he
who has conversed knows how many respectable names, connect the idea of
innocence and happiness with the life of the savage and the unimproved
rustic. To fix the character of the savage is therefore necessary, ere
we examine the assertion, that "it had been happy for both the old and
the new worlds if the East and West Indies had never been discovered."
The bloodshed and the attendant miseries which the unparalleled rapine
and cruelties of the Spaniards spread over the new world, indeed
disgrace human nature. The great and flourishing empires of Mexico and
Peru, steeped in the blood of forty millions of their sons, present a
melancholy prospect, which must

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

excite the indignation of every good heart. Yet such desolation is not
the certain consequence of discovery. And, even should we allow that the
depravity of human nature is so great that the avarice of the merchant
and rapacity of the soldier will overwhelm with misery every
new-discovered country, still, are there other, more comprehensive
views, to be taken, ere we decide against the intercourse introduced by
navigation. When we weigh the happiness of Europe in the scale of
political philosophy, we are not to confine our eye to the dreadful
ravages of Attila the Hun, or of Alaric the Goth. If the waters of a
stagnated lake are disturbed by the spade when led into new channels, we
ought not to inveigh against the alteration because the waters are
fouled at the first; we are to wait to see the streamlets refine and
spread beauty and utility through a thousand vales which they never
visited before. Such were the conquests of Alexander, temporary evils,
but civilization and happiness followed in the bloody track. And, though
disgraced with every barbarity, happiness has also followed the
conquests of the Spaniards in the other hemisphere. Though the villainy
of the Jesuits defeated their schemes of civilization in many countries,
the labours of that society have been crowned with a success in Paraguay
and in Canada, which reflects upon their industry the greatest honour.
The customs and cruelties of many American tribes still disgrace human
nature, but in Paraguay and Canada the natives have been brought to
relish the blessings of society, and the arts of virtuous and civil
life. If Mexico is not so populous as it once was, neither is it so
barbarous; <span id="fr_25"></span>[\*](#fn_25.md) the

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

shrieks of the human victim do not now resound from temple to temple,
nor does the human heart, held up reeking to the sun, imprecate the
vengeance of Heaven on the guilty empire. And, however impolitically
despotic the Spanish governments may be, still do these colonies enjoy
the opportunities of improvement, which in every age arise from the
knowledge of commerce and of letters--opportunities which were never
enjoyed in South America under the reigns of Montezuma and Atabalipa.
But if from Spanish, we turn our eyes to British America, what a
glorious prospect! Here, formerly, on the wild lawn, perhaps twice in
the year, a few savage hunters kindled their evening fire, kindled it
more to protect them from evil spirits and beasts of prey, than from the
cold, and with their feet pointed to it, slept on the ground. Here, now,
population spreads her thousands, and society appears in all its
blessings of mutual help, and the mutual lights of intellectual
improvement. "What work of art, or power, or public utility, has ever
equalled the glory of having peopled a continent, without guilt or
bloodshed, with a multitude of free and happy commonwealths; to have
given them the best arts of life and government!" To have given a savage
continent an image of the British Constitution is, indeed, the greatest
glory of the British crown, "a greater than any other nation ever
acquired;" and from the consequences of the genius of Henry, Duke of
Viseo, did the British American empire arise, an empire which, unless
retarded by the illiberal and inhuman spirit of religious fanaticism,
will in a few centuries, perhaps, be the glory of the world.

Stubborn indeed must be the theorist who will deny the improvement,

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

virtue, and happiness which, in the result, the voyage of Columbus has
spread over the western world. The happiness which Europe and Asia have
received from the intercourse with each other, cannot hitherto, it must
be owned, be compared either with the possession of it, or the source of
its increase established in America. Yet, let the man of the most
melancholy views estimate all the wars and depredations which are
charged upon the Portuguese and other European nations, still will the
eastern world appear considerably advantaged by the voyage of Gama. If
seas of blood have been shed by the Portuguese, nothing new was
introduced into India. War and depredation were no unheard-of strangers
on the banks of the Ganges, nor could the nature of the civil
establishments of the eastern nations secure a lasting peace. The
ambition of their native princes was only diverted into new channels,
into channels which, in the natural course of human affairs, will
certainly lead to permanent governments, established on improved laws
and just dominion. Yet, even ere such governments are formed, is Asia no
loser by the arrival of Europeans. The horrid massacres and unbounded
rapine which, according to their own annals, followed the victories of
their Asian conquerors were never equalled by the worst of their
European vanquishers. Nor is the establishment of improved governments
in the East the dream of theory. The superiority of the civil and
military arts of the British, notwithstanding the hateful character of
some individuals, is at this day beheld in India with all the
astonishment of admiration; and admiration is always followed, though
often with retarded steps, by the strong desire of similar improvement.
Long after the fall of the Roman empire the Roman laws were adopted by
nations which ancient Rome esteemed as barbarous. And thus, in the
course of’ ages, the British laws, according to every test of
probability, will have a most important effect, will fulfil the prophecy
of Camoëns, and transfer to the British the high compliment he pays to
his countrymen--

"Beneath their sway majestic, wise, and mild,  
Proud of her victor’s laws thrice happier India smiled."

In former ages, and within these few years, the fertile empire of India
has exhibited every scene of human misery, under the undistinguishing
ravages of their Mohammedan and native princes;

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

ravages only equalled in European history by those committed under
Attila, surnamed "the scourge of God," and "the destroyer of nations."
The ideas of patriotism and of honour were seldom known in the cabinets
of the eastern princes till the arrival of the Europeans. Every species
of assassination was the policy of their courts, and every act of
unrestrained rapine and massacre followed the path of victory. But some
of the Portuguese governors, and many of the English officers, have
taught them that humanity to the conquered is the best, the truest
policy. The brutal ferocity of their own conquerors is now the object of
their greatest dread; and the superiority of the British in war has
convinced their princes, <span id="fr_26"></span>[\*](#fn_26.md) that an
alliance with the British is the surest guarantee of their national
peace and prosperity. While the English East India Company are possessed
of their present greatness, it is in their power to diffuse over the
East every blessing which flows from the wisest and most humane policy.
Long ere the Europeans arrived, a failure of the crop of rice, the
principal food of India, had spread the devastations of famine over the
populous plains of Bengal. And never, from the seven years’ famine of
ancient Egypt to the present day, was there a natural scarcity in any
country which did not enrich the proprietors of the granaries. The
Mohammedan princes, and Moorish traders have often added all the horrors
of an artificial, to a natural, famine. But, however some Portuguese or
other governors may stand accused, much was left for the humanity of the
more exalted policy of an Albuquerque, or a Castro. And under such
European governors as these, the distresses of the East have often been
alleviated by a generosity of conduct, and a train of resources formerly
unknown in Asia. Absurd and impracticable were that scheme which would
introduce the British laws into India without the deepest regard to the
manners and circumstances peculiar to the people. But that spirit of
liberty upon which they are founded, and that security of property which
is their leading principle, must in time have a wide and stupendous
effect. The abject spirit of Asiatic submission will be taught to see,
and to claim, those rights of nature, of which the dispirited and
passive Hindus could, till lately, hardly form an idea. From this, as
naturally as the noon

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

succeeds the dawn, must the other blessings of civilization arise. For,
though the four great castes of India are almost inaccessible to the
introduction of other manners, and of other literature than their own,
happily there is in human nature a propensity to change. Nor may the
political philosopher be deemed an enthusiast who would boldly prophesy,
that unless the British be driven from India the general superiority
which they bear will, ere many generations shall have passed, induce the
most intelligent of India to break the shackles of their absurd
superstitions, <span id="fr_27"></span>[\*](#fn_27.md) and lead them to
partake of those advantages which arise from the free scope and due
cultivation of the rational powers. In almost every instance the Indian
institutions are contrary to the feelings and wishes of nature. And
ignorance and bigotry, their two chief pillars, can never secure
unalterable duration. We have certain proof that the horrid custom of
burning the wives along with the body of the deceased husband has
continued for upwards of fifteen hundred years; we are also certain that
within these twenty years it has begun to fall into disuse. Together
with the alteration of this most striking feature of Indian manners,
other assimilations to European sentiments have already taken place. Nor
can the obstinacy even of the conceited Chinese always resist the desire
of imitating the Europeans, a people who in arts and arms are so greatly
superior to themselves. The use of the twenty-four letters, by which we
can express every language, appeared at first as miraculous to the
Chinese. Prejudice cannot always deprive that people, who are not
deficient in selfish cunning, of the ease and expedition of an alphabet;
and it is easy to foresee that, in the course of a few centuries, some
alphabet will certainly take the place of the 60,000 arbitrary marks
which now render the cultivation of the Chinese literature not only a
labour of the utmost difficulty, but even the attainment impossible
beyond a very limited degree. And from the introduction of an alphabet,
what improvements may not be expected from the laborious industry of the
Chinese! Though most obstinately attached to their old customs, yet
there is a tide in the manners of nations which is sudden and rapid, and
which acts with a kind of instinctive fury against ancient prejudice and
absurdity. It was that nation of merchants, the Phœnicians, which
diffused the

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

use of letters through the ancient, and commerce will undoubtedly
diffuse the same blessings through the modern, world.

To this view of the political happiness which is sure to be introduced
in proportion to civilization, let the divine add what may be reasonably
expected from such opportunity of the increase of religion. A factory of
merchants, indeed, has seldom been found to be a school of piety; yet,
when the general manners of a people become assimilated to those of a
more rational worship, something more than ever was produced by an
infant mission, or the neighbourhood of an infant colony, may then be
reasonably expected, and even foretold.

In estimating the political happiness of a people, nothing is of greater
importance than their capacity of, and tendency to, improvement. As a
dead lake, to continue our former illustration, will remain in the same
state for ages and ages, so would the bigotry and superstitions of the
East continue the same. But if the lake is begun to be opened into a
thousand rivulets, who knows over what unnumbered fields, barren before,
they may diffuse the blessings of fertility, and turn a dreary
wilderness into a land of society and joy.

In contrast to this, let the Gold Coast and other immense regions of
Africa be contemplated--

"Afric behold; alas, what altered view!  
Her lands uncultured, and her sons untrue;  
Ungraced with all that sweetens human life,  
Savage and fierce they roam in brutal strife;  
Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields,  
Yet naked roam their own neglected fields. . . .  
Unnumber’d tribes as bestial grazers stray,  
By laws unform’d, unform’d by Reason’s sway.  
Far inward stretch the mournful sterile dales,  
Where on the parch’d hill-side pale famine wails."  
                                                     LUSIAD X.

Let us consider how many millions of these unhappy savages are dragged
from their native fields, and cut off for ever from all the hopes and
all the rights to which human birth entitled them. And who would
hesitate to pronounce that negro the greatest of patriots, who, by
teaching his countrymen the arts of society, should teach them to defend
themselves in the possession of their fields, their families, and their
own personal liberties?

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

Evident, however, as it is, that the voyages of Gama and Columbus have
already carried a superior degree of happiness, and the promise of
infinitely more, to the eastern and western worlds; yet the advantages
to Europe from the discovery of these regions may perhaps be denied. But
let us view what Europe was, ere the genius of Don Henry gave birth to
the spirit of modern discovery.

Several ages before this period the feudal system had degenerated into
the most absolute tyranny. The barons exercised the most despotic
authority over their vassals, and every scheme of public utility was
rendered impracticable by their continual petty wars with each other; to
which they led their dependents as dogs to the chase. Unable to read, or
to write his own name, the chieftain was entirely possessed by the most
romantic opinion of military glory, and the song of his domestic
minstrel constituted his highest idea of fame. The classic authors slept
on the shelves of the monasteries, their dark but happy asylum, while
the life of the monks resembled that of the fattened beeves which loaded
their tables. Real abilities were indeed possessed by a Duns Scotus and
a few others; but these were lost in the most trifling subtleties of a
sophistry which they dignified with the name of casuistical divinity.
Whether Adam and Eve were created with navels? and How many thousand
angels might at the same instant dance upon the point of the finest
needle without one jostling another? were two of the several topics of
like importance which excited the acumen and engaged the controversies
of the learned. While every branch of philosophical, of rational
investigation, was thus unpursued and unknown, commerce, which is
incompatible with the feudal system, was equally neglected and
unimproved. Where the mind is enlarged and enlightened by learning,
plans of commerce will rise into action, and these, in return, will from
every part of the world bring new acquirements to philosophy and
science. The birth of learning and commerce may be different, but their
growth is mutual and dependent upon each other. They not only assist
each other, but the same enlargement of mind which is necessary for
perfection in the one is also necessary for perfection in the other; and
the same causes impede, and are alike destructive of, both. The
INTERCOURSE of mankind is the parent of each. According to the
confinement or extent of intercourse, barbarity or civilization
proportionately prevail. In the dark, monkish ages, the intercourse of
the learned was as much impeded

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

and confined as that of the merchant. A few unwieldy vessels coasted the
shores of Europe, and mendicant friars and ignorant pilgrims carried a
miserable account of what was passing in the world from monastery to
monastery. What doctor had last disputed on the peripatetic philosophy
at some university, or what new heresy had last appeared, not only
comprised the whole of their literary intelligence, but was delivered
with little accuracy, and received with as little attention. While this
thick cloud of mental darkness overspread the western world, was Don
Henry, prince of Portugal, born; born to set mankind free from the
feudal system, and to give to the whole world every advantage, every
light that may possibly be diffused by the intercourse of unlimited
commerce:--

"For then from ancient gloom emerg’d  
The rising world of trade: the genius, then,  
Of navigation, that in hopeless sloth  
Had slumber’d on the vast Atlantic deep  
For idle ages, starting heard at last  
The Lusitanian prince, who, Heaven-inspir’d,  
To love of useful glory rous’d mankind,  
And in unbounded commerce mix’d the world."  
                                               THOMSON.

In contrast to this melancholy view of human nature, sunk in barbarism
and benighted with ignorance, let the present state of Europe be
impartially estimated. Yet, though the great increase of opulence and
learning cannot be denied, there are some who assert that virtue and
happiness have as greatly declined. And the immense overflow of riches,
from the East in particular, has been pronounced big with destruction to
the British empire. Everything human, it is true, has its dark as well
as its bright side; but let these popular complaints be examined, and it
will be found that modern Europe, and the British empire in a very
particular manner, have received the greatest and most solid advantages
from the modern, enlarged system of commerce. The magic of the old
romances, which could make the most withered, deformed hag, appear as
the most beautiful virgin, is every day verified in popular declamation.
Ancient days are there painted in the most amiable simplicity, and the
modern in the most odious colours. Yet, what man of fortune in England
lives in that stupendous gross luxury which every day was exhibited in
the Gothic castles of the old chieftains! Four or five hundred knights

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

and squires in the domestic retinue of a warlike earl was not uncommon,
nor was the pomp of embroidery inferior to the profuse waste of their
tables; in both instances unequalled by all the mad excesses of the
present age.

While the baron thus lived in all the wild glare of Gothic luxury,
agriculture was almost totally neglected, and his meaner vassals fared
harder, infinitely less comfortably, than the meanest industrious
labourers of England do now; where the lands are uncultivated, the
peasants, ill-clothed, ill-lodged, and poorly fed, pass their miserable
days in sloth and filth, totally ignorant of every advantage, of every
comfort which nature lays at their feet. He who passes from the trading
towns and cultured fields of England to those remote villages of
Scotland or Ireland which claim this description, is astonished at the
comparative wretchedness of their destitute inhabitants; but few
consider that these villages only exhibit a view of what Europe was ere
the spirit of commerce diffused the blessings which naturally flow from
her improvements. In the Hebrides the failure of a harvest almost
depopulates an island. Having little or no traffic to purchase grain,
numbers of the young and hale betake themselves to the continent in
quest of employment and food, leaving a few, less adventurous, behind,
to beget a new race, the heir of the same fortune. Yet from the same
cause, from the want of traffic, the kingdom of England has often felt
more dreadful effects than these. Even in the days when her Henries and
Edwards plumed themselves with the trophies of France, how often has
famine spread all her horrors over city and village? Our modern
histories neglect this characteristic feature of ancient days; but the
rude chronicles of these ages inform us, that three or four times in
almost every reign was England thus visited. The failure of the crop was
then severely felt, and two bad harvests in succession were almost
insupportable. But commerce has now opened another scene, has armed
government with the happiest power that can be exerted by the rulers of
a nation--the power to prevent every extremity <span
id="fr_28"></span>[\*](#fn_28.md) which may possibly arise from bad
harvests; extremities, which, in former ages, were esteemed more
dreadful visitations of the wrath of Heaven than the pestilence itself.
Yet modern London is not so certainly defended against the latter, its
ancient visitor, than the

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

commonwealth by the means of commerce, under a just and humane
government, is secured against the ravages of the former. If, from these
great outlines of the happiness enjoyed by a commercial over an
uncommercial nation, we turn our eyes to the manners, the advantages
will be found no less in favour of the civilized.

Whoever is inclined to declaim at the vices of the present age, let him
read, and be convinced, that the Gothic ages were less virtuous. If the
spirit of chivalry prevented effeminacy, it was the foster-father of a
ferocity of manners now happily unknown. Rapacity, avarice, and
effeminacy are the vices ascribed to the increase of commerce; and in
some degree, it must be confessed, they follow her steps. Yet infinitely
more dreadful, as every palatinate in Europe often felt, were the
effects of the two first under the feudal lords than can possibly be
experienced under any system of trade. The virtues and vices of human
nature are the same in every age: they only receive different
modifications, and are dormant, or awakened into action, under different
circumstances. The feudal lord had it infinitely more in his power to be
rapacious than the merchant. And whatever avarice may attend the trader,
his intercourse with the rest of mankind lifts him greatly above that
brutish ferocity which actuates the savage, often the rustic, and in
general characterizes the ignorant part of mankind. The abolition of the
feudal system, a system of absolute slavery, and that equality of
mankind which affords the protection of property, and every other
incitement to industry, are the glorious gifts which the spirit of
commerce, awakened by Prince Henry of Portugal, has bestowed upon Europe
in general; and, as if directed by the manes of his mother, a daughter
of England, upon the British empire in particular. In the vice of
effeminacy alone, perhaps, do we exceed our ancestors; yet, even here we
have infinitely the advantage over them. The brutal ferocity of former
ages is now lost, and the general mind is humanized. The savage breast
is the native soil of revenge; a vice, of all others, peculiarly stamped
with the character of hell. But the mention of this was reserved for the
character of the savages of Europe. The savage of every country is
implacable when injured; but among some, revenge has its measure. When
an American Indian is murdered his kindred pursue the murderer; and, as
soon as blood has atoned for blood, the wilds of America hear the
hostile parties join in their mutual. lamentations over the dead, whom,
as an oblivion of malice, they

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

bury together. But the measure of revenge, never to be full, was left
for the demi-savages of Europe. The vassals of the feudal lord entered
into his quarrels with the most inexorable rage. Just or unjust was no
consideration of theirs. It was a family feud; no farther inquiry was
made; and from age to age, the parties, who never injured each other,
breathed nothing but mutual rancour and revenge. And actions, suitable
to this horrid spirit, everywhere confessed its virulent influence. Such
were the late days of Europe, admired by the ignorant for the innocence
of manners. Resentment of injury, indeed, is natural; and there is a
degree which is honest, and though warm, far from inhuman. But if it is
the hard task of humanized virtue to preserve the feeling of an injury
unmixed with the slightest criminal wish of revenge, how impossible is
it for the savage to attain the dignity of forgiveness, the greatest
ornament of human nature. As in individuals, a virtue will rise into a
vice, generosity into blind profusion, and even mercy into criminal
lenity, so civilized manners will lead the opulent into effeminacy. But
let it be considered, this consequence is by no means the certain result
of civilization. Civilization, on the contrary, provides the most
effectual preventive of this evil. Where classical literature prevails
the ’manly spirit which it breathes must be diffused: whenever
frivolousness predominates, when refinement degenerates into whatever
enervates the mind, literary ignorance is sure to complete the
effeminate character. A mediocrity of virtues and of talents is the lot
of the great majority of mankind; and even this mediocrity, if
cultivated by a liberal education, will infallibly secure its possessor
against those excesses of effeminacy which are really culpable. To be of
plain manners it is not necessary to be a clown, or to wear coarse
clothes; nor is it necessary to lie on the ground and feed like the
savage to be truly manly. The beggar who, behind the hedge, divides his
offals with his dog has often more of the real sensualist than he who
dines at an elegant table. Nor need we hesitate to assert, that he who,
unable to preserve a manly elegance of manners, degenerates into the
*petit maitre*, would have been, in any age or condition, equally
insignificant and worthless. Some, when they talk of the debauchery of
the present age, seem to think that the former ages were all innocence.
But this is ignorance of human nature. The debauchery of a barbarous age
is gross and brutal; that of a gloomy, superstitious one, secret,
excessive, and murderous; that of a more polished one, much happier

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

for the fair sex, <span id="fr_29"></span>[\*](#fn_29.md) and certainly in
no sense so big with political unhappiness. If one disease has been
imported from America, <span id="fr_30"></span>[†](#fn_30.md) the most
valuable medicines have likewise been brought from these regions; and
distempers, which were thought invincible by our forefathers, are now
cured. If the luxuries of the Indies usher disease to our tables the
consequence is not unknown; the wise and the temperate receive no
injury, and intemperance has been the destroyer of mankind in every age.
The opulence of ancient Rome produced a luxury of manners which proved
fatal to that mighty empire. But the effeminate sensualists of those
ages were not men of intellectual cultivation. The enlarged ideas, the
generous and manly feelings inspired by a liberal education, were
utterly unknown to them. Unformed by that wisdom which arises from
science and true philosophy, they were gross barbarians, dressed in the
mere outward tinsel of civilization. <span id="fr_31"></span>[‡](#fn_31.md)
Where the enthusiasm of military honour characterizes the rank of
gentlemen that nation will rise into empire. But no sooner does conquest
give a continued security than the mere soldier degenerates; and the old
veterans are soon succeeded by a new generation, illiterate as their
fathers, but destitute of their virtues and experience. Polite
literature not only humanizes the heart, but also wonderfully
strengthens and enlarges the mind. Moral and political philosophy are
its peculiar provinces, and are never happily cultivated without its
assistance. But, where ignorance characterizes the body of the nobility,
the most insipid dissipation and the very

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

idleness and effeminacy of luxury are sure to follow. Titles and family
are then the only merit, and the few men of business who surround the
throne have it then in their power to aggrandize themselves by riveting
the chains of slavery. A stately grandeur is preserved, but it is only
outward; all is decayed within, and on the first storm the weak fabric
falls to the dust. Thus rose and thus fell the empire of Rome, and the
much wider one of Portugal. Though the increase of wealth did, indeed,
contribute to that corruption of manners which unnerved the Portuguese,
certain it is the wisdom of legislature might certainly have prevented
every evil which Spain and Portugal have experienced from their
acquisitions in the two Indies. <span id="fr_32"></span>[\*](#fn_32.md)
Every evil which they have suffered from their acquirements arose, as
shall be hereafter demonstrated, from their general ignorance, which
rendered them unable to investigate or apprehend even the first
principles of civil and commercial philosophy. And what other than the
total eclipse of their glory could be expected from a nobility, rude and
unlettered as those of Portugal are described by the author of the
Lusiad--a court and nobility who sealed the truth of all his complaints
against them by suffering that great man, the light of their age, to die
in an almshouse! What but the fall of their state could be expected from
barbarians like these! Nor can the annals of mankind produce one
instance of the fall of empire where the character of the nobles was
other than that ascribed to his countrymen by Camoëns.

27, 28.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[xxxvii:\*](lus04.htm#fr_23.md) This ferocity of
savage manners affords a philosophical account how the most distant and
inhospitable climes were first peopled. When a Romulus erects a monarchy
and makes war on his neighbours, some naturally fly to the wilds. As
their families increase, the stronger commit depredations on the weaker;
and thus from generation to generation, they who either dread just
punishment or unjust oppression, fly farther and farther in search of
that protection which is only to be found in civilized society.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[xxxviii:\*](lus04.htm#fr_24.md) The author of that
voluminous work, *Histoire Philosophique et Politique des Etablissements
et du Commerce des Européens dans les deux Indes*, is one of the many
who assert that savage life is happier than civil. His reasons are thus
abridged: The savage has no care or fear for the future; his hunting and
fishing give him a certain subsistence. He sleeps sound, and knows not
the diseases of cities. He cannot want what he does not desire, nor
desire that which he does not know, and vexation or grief do not enter
his soul. He is not under the control of a superior in his actions; in a
word, says our author, the savage only suffers the evils of nature.

If the civilized, he adds, enjoy the elegancies of life, have better
food, and are more comfortably defended against the change of seasons,
it is use which makes these things necessary, and they are purchased by
the painful labours of the multitude who are the basis of society. To
what outrages is not the man of civil life exposed? If he has property,
it is in danger; and government or authority is, according to our
author, the greatest of all evils. If there is a famine in North
America, the savage, led by the wind and the sun, can go to a better
clime; but in the horrors of famine, war, or pestilence, the ports and
barriers of civilized states place the subjects in a prison, where they
must perish. There still remains an infinite difference between the lot
of the civilized and the savage; a difference, all entirely to the
disadvantage of society, that injustice which reigns in the inequality
of fortunes and conditions.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[xxxix:\*](lus04.htm#fr_25.md) The innocent
simplicity of the Americans in their conferences with the Spaniards, and
the horrid cruelties they suffered from them, divert our view from their
complete character. Almost everything was horrid in their civil customs
and religious rites. In some tribes, to cohabit with their mothers,
sisters, and daughters was esteemed the means of domestic peace. In
others, catamites were maintained in every village; they went from house
to house as they pleased, and it was unlawful to refuse them what
victuals they chose. In every tribe, the captives taken in war were
murdered with the most wanton cruelty, and afterwards devoured by the
victors. Their religious rites were, if possible, still more horrid. The
abominations of ancient Moloch were here outnumbered; children, virgins,
slaves, and captives bled on different altars, to appease their various
gods. If there was a scarcity of human victims, the priests announced
that the gods were dying of thirst for human blood. And, to prevent a
threatened famine, the kings of Mexico were obliged to make war on the
neighbouring states. The prisoners of either side died by the hand of
the priest. But the number of the Mexican sacrifices so greatly exceeded
those of other <span id="page_xl">p. xl</span> nations, that the
Tlascalans, who were hunted down for this purpose, readily joined Cortez
with about 200,000 men, and enabled him to make one great sacrifice of
the Mexican nation. Who that views Mexico, steeped in her own blood, can
restrain the emotion which whispers to him, This is the hand of
Heaven!--By the number of these sacred butcheries, one would think that
cruelty was the greatest amusement of Mexico. At the dedication of the
temple of Vitzliputzli, A.D. 1486, no less than 64,080 human victims
were sacrificed in four days. And, according to the best accounts, the
annual sacrifices of Mexico required several thousands. The skulls of
the victims sometimes were hung on strings which reached from tree to
tree around their temples, and sometimes were built up in towers and
cemented with lime. In some of these towers Andrew de Tapia one day
counted 136,000 skulls. During the war with Cortez they increased their
usual sacrifices, till priest and people were tired of their bloody
religion.--See, for ample justification of these statements, the
*Histories of the Conquest of Mexico and Peru*, by Prescott.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[xlii:\*](lus04.htm#fr_26.md) Mahommed Ali Khan,
Nawab of the Carnatic, declared, "I met the British with that freedom of
openness which they love, and I esteem it my honour as well as security
to be the ally of such a nation of princes."

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xliii:\*](lus04.htm#fr_27.md) Every man must
follow his father’s trade, and must marry a daughter of the same
occupation. Innumerable are their other barbarous restrictions of genius
and inclination.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[xlvii:\*](lus04.htm#fr_28.md) Extremity; for it
were both highly unjust and impolitic in government to allow importation
in such a degree as might be destructive of domestic agriculture.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[l:\*](lus04.htm#fr_29.md) Even that warm admirer
of savage happiness, the author of *Histoire Philosophique et Politique
des Etablissements*, confesses that the wild Americans seem destitute of
the feeling of love. When the heat of passion, says he, is gratified,
they lose all affection and attachment for their women, whom they
degrade to the most servile offices.--A tender remembrance of the first
endearments, a generous participation of care and hope, the
compassionate sentiments of honour; all these delicate feelings, which
arise into affection, and bind attachment, are indeed, incompatible with
the ferocious and gross sensations of barbarians.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[l:†](lus04.htm#fr_30.md) It is a question still
debated among medical writers, and by no means yet decided, whether the
disease referred to is of American origin. We do not read, it is true,
of any such disease in the pages of the ancient classic writers; it has
hence been inferred that it was unknown to them.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[l:‡](lus04.htm#fr_31.md) The degeneracy of the
Roman literature preceded the fate of the state, and the reason is
obvious. The men of fortune grew frivolous, and superficial in every
branch of knowledge, and were therefore unable to hold the reigns of
empire. The degeneracy of literary taste is, therefore, the surest proof
of the general ignorance.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[li:\*](lus04.htm#fr_32.md) The soldiers and
navigators were the only considerable gainers by their acquirements in
the Indies. Agriculture and manufactures are the natural strength of a
nation; these received little or no increase in Spain and Portugal by
the great acquisitions of these crowns.
