# CHAP. XXIV.

Of the Slaying of Gunnar, and Grettir's strife with Earl Svein.

NOW Gunnar was in the town, and lay in wait for Grettir always and
everywhere. It happened on a day that Grettir-sat in a booth a-drinking,
for he would not throw himself in Gunnar's way. But, when be wotted of
it the least, the door was driven at so that it brake asunder, four men
all-armed burst in, and there was Gunnar and his fellows.

They set on Grettir; but he caught up his weapons which hung over him,
and then drew aback into the corner, whence he defended himself, having
before him the shield, but dealing blows with the short-sword, nor did
they have speedy luck with him. Now he smote at one of Gunnar's fellows,
and more he needed not, then he advanced forth on the floor, and
therewith they were driven doorward through the booth, and there fell
another man of Gunnar's; then were Gunnar and his fellows fain of
flight; one of them got to the door, struck his foot against the
threshold and lay there grovelling and was slow in getting to his feet.
Gunnar had his shield before him, and gave back before Grettir, but he
set on him fiercely and leaped up on the cross-beam by the door. Now the
hands of Gunnar and the shield were within the door, but Grettir dealt a
blow down amidst Gunnar and the shield and cut off both his hands by

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

the wrist, and he fell aback out of the door; then Grettir dealt him his
death-blow.

But in this nick of time got to his feet Gunnar's man, who had lain
fallen awhile, and he ran straightway to see the Earl, and to tell him
these tidings.

Earl Svein was wondrous wroth at this tale, and forthwith summoned a
Thing in the town. But when Thorfinn and Thorstein Dromond knew this,
they brought together their kin and friends and came thronging to the
Thing. Very cross-grained was the Earl, and it was no easy matter to
come to speech with him. Thorfinn went up first before the Earl and
said, "For this cause am I come hither, to offer thee peace and honour
for these man-slayings that Grettir has wrought; thou alone shalt shape
and settle all, if the man hath respite of his life."

The Earl answered sore wroth: "Late wilt thou be loth to ask respite for
Grettir; but in my mind it is that thou hast no good cause in court; he
has now slain three brothers, one at the heels of the other, who were
men so brave that they would none bear the other to purse. Now it will
not avail thee, Thorfinn, to pray for Grettir, for I will not thus bring
wrongs into the land so as to take boot for such unmeasured misdeeds."

Then came forward Bessi, Skald-Torfa's son, and prayed the Earl to take
the offered settlement. "Thereto," be said, "I will give up my goods,
for Grettir is a man of great kin and a good friend of mine; thou mayst
well see, Lord, that it is better to respite one man's life and to have
therefor the thanks of many, thyself alone dooming the fines, than to
break down thine own honour, and risk whether thou canst seize the man
or not."

The Earl answered, "Thou farest well herein, Bessi, and showest at all
times that thou art a high-minded man;

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

still I am loth thus to break the laws of the land, giving respite to
men of foredoomed lives."

Then stepped forth Thorstein Dromond and greeted the Earl, and made
offers on Grettir's behalf, and laid thereto many fair words. The Earl
asked for what cause he made offers for this man. Thorstein said that
they were brothers. The Earl said that he had not known it before: "Now
it is but the part of a man for thee to help him, but because we have
made up our mind not to take money for these manslayings, we shall make
all men of equal worth here, and Grettir's life will we have, whatsoever
it shall cost and whensoever chance shall serve."

Thereat the Earl sprang up, and would listen in nowise to the offered
atonements.

Now Thorfinn and his folk went home to Thorstein's court and made ready.
But when the Earl saw this he bade all his men take weapons, and then he
went thither with his folk in array. But before he came up Thorfinn and
his men ordered themselves for defence before the gate of the court.
Foremost stood Thorfinn and Thorstein and Grettir, and then Bessi, and
each of them had a large following of men with him.

The Earl bade them to give up Grettir, nor to bring themselves into an
evil strait; they made the very same offer as before. The Earl would not
hearken thereto. Then Thorfinn and Thorstein said that the Earl should
have more ado yet for the getting of Grettir's life, "For one fate shall
befall us all, and it will be said thou workest hard for one man's life,
if all we have to be laid on earth therefor."

The Earl said he should spare none of them, and now they were at the
very point to fight.

Then went to the Earl many men of good-will, and

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

prayed him not to push matters on to such great evils, and said they
would have to pay heavily before all these were slain. The Earl found
this rede to be wholesome, and became somewhat softened thereat.

Thereafter they drew up an agreement to which Thorstein and Thorfinn
were willing enough, now that Grettir should have respite of his life.
The Earl spake: "Know ye," quoth he, "that though I deal by way of mean
words with these manslayings at this time, yet I call this no
settlement, but I am loth to fight against my own folk; though I see
that ye make little of me in this matter."

Then said Thorfinn, "This is a greater honour for thee, Lord, for that
thou alone wilt doom the weregild."

Then the Earl said that Grettir should go in peace, as for him, out to
Iceland, when ships fared out, if so they would; they said that they
would take this. They paid the Earl fines to his mind, and parted from
him with little friendship. Grettir went with Thorfinn; he and his
brother Thorstein parted fondly.

Thorfinn got great fame for the aid he had given Grettir against such
overwhelming power as he had to deal with: none of the men who had
helped Grettir were ever after well loved of the Earl, save Bessi.

So quoth Grettir--

To our helping came  
The great of name;  
Thorfinn was there  
Born rule to bear;  
When all bolts fell  
Into locks, and hell  
Cried out for my life  
In the Tunsberg strife.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

The Dromund fair <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md)  
Of red seas was there,  
The stone of the bane  
Of steel-gods vain  
From Bylest's kin  
My life to win,  
Above all men  
He laboured then.

Then the king's folk  
Would strike no stroke  
To win my head;  
So great grew dread;  
For the leopard came  
With byrni's flame,  
And on thoughts-burg wall  
Should that bright fire fall."

Grettir went back north with Thorfinn, and was with him till he gat him
to ship with chapmen who were bound out to Iceland : he gave him many
fair gifts of raiment, and a fair-stained saddle and a bridle withal.
They parted in friendship, and Thorfinn bade him come to him whensoever
he should come back to Norway.
