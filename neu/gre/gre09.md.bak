# CHAP. IV.

THERE were two vikings called Vigbiod and Vestmar; they were
South-islanders, and lay out both winter and summer; they had thirteen
ships, and harried mostly in Ireland, and did many an ill deed there
till Eyvind the Eastman took the land-wardship; thereafter they got them
gone to the South-isles, and harried there and all about the firths of
Scotland: against these went Thrand and Onund, and heard that they had
sailed to that island, which is called Bute. Now Onund and his folk came
there with five ships; and when the vikings see their ships and know how
many they are, they deem they have enough strength gathered there, and
take their weapons and lay their ships in the midst betwixt two cliffs,
where was a great and deep sound; only on one side could they be set on,
and that with but five ships at once. Now Onund was the wisest of men,
and bade lay five ships up into the sound, so

that he and his might have back way when they would, for there was
plenty of sea-room astern. On one board of them too was a certain
island, and under the lee thereof he let one ship lie, and his men
brought many great stones forth on to the sheer cliffs above, yet might
not be seen withal from the ships.

Now the vikings laid their ships boldly enough for the attack, and
thought that the others quailed; and Vigbiod asked who they were that
were in such jeopardy. Thrand said that he was the brother of Eyvind the
Eastman, "and here beside me is Onund Treefoot my fellow."

Then laughed the vikings, and shouted--

Treefoot, Treefoot, foot of tree,  
Trolls take thee and thy company.

"Yea, a sight it is seldom seen of us, that such men should go into
battle as have no might over themselves."

Onund said that they could know nought thereof ere it were tried; and
withal they laid their ships alongside one of the other, and there began
a great fight, and either side did boldly. But when they came to handy
blows, Onund gave back toward the cliff, and when the vikings saw this,
they deemed he was minded to flee, and made towards his ship, and came
as nigh to the cliff as they might. But in that very point of time those
came forth on to the edge of the cliff who were appointed so to do, and
sent at the vikings so great a flight of stones that they might not
withstand it.

Then fell many of the viking-folk, and others were hurt so that they
might not bear weapon; and withal they were fain to draw back, and might
not, because their ships were even then come into the narrowest of the
sound, and they were huddled together both by the ships and the

stream; but Onund and his men set on fiercely, whereas Vigbiod was, but
Thrand set on Vestmar, and won little thereby; so, when the folk were
thinned on Vigbiod's ship, Onund's men and Onund himself got ready to
board her: that Vigbiod saw, and cheered on his men without stint: then
he turned to meet Onund, and the more part fled before him; but Onund
bade his men mark how it went between them; for he was of huge strength.
Now they set a log of wood under Onund's knee, so that he stood firmly
enow; the viking fought his way forward along the ship till he reached
Onund, and he smote at him with his sword, and the stroke took the
shield, and sheared off all it met and then the sword drove into the log
that Onund had under his knee, and stuck fast therein; and Vigbiod
stooped in drawing it out, and even therewith Onund smote at his
shoulder in such wise, that he cut the arm from off him, and then was
the viking unmeet for battle.

But when Vestmar knew that his fellow was fallen, he leaped into the
furthermost ship and fled with all those who might reach her. Thereafter
they ransacked the fallen men; and by then was Vigbiod nigh to his
death: Onund went up to him, and sang-

Yea, seest thou thy wide wounds bleed?  
What of shrinking didst thou heed  
In the one-foot sling of gold?  
What scratch here dost thou behold?  
And in e'en such wise as this  
Many an axe-breaker there is  
Strong of tongue and weak of hand  
Tried thou wert, and mighest not stand."

So there they took much spoil and sailed back to Barra in the autumn.
