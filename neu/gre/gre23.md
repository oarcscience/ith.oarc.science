# CHAP. XVIII.

Of Grettir at Haramsey and his dealings with Karr the Old.

NOW the lord who dwelt in the island was called Thorfinn; he was the son
of Karr the Old, who had dwelt there long; and Thorfinn was a great
chief.

But when day was fully come men saw from the island that the chapmen
were brought to great straits. This was made known to Thorfinn, and he
quickly bestirred himself, and had a large bark of his launched, rowed
by sixteen men, on this bark were nigh thirty men in all; they came up
speedily and saved the chapmen's wares; but the ship settled down, and
much goods were lost there. Thorfinn brought all men from the ship home
to himself, and they abode there a week and dried their wares. Then the
chapmen went south into the land, and are now out of the tale.

Grettir was left behind with Thorfinn, and little he stirred, and was at
most times mighty short of speech. Thorfinn bade give him meals, but
otherwise paid small heed to him; Grettir was loth to follow him, and
would not go out with him in the day; this Thorfinn tool, ill, but had
not the heart to have food withheld from him.

Now Thorfinn was fond of stately housekeeping, and was a man of great
joyance, and would fain have other men merry too: but Grettir would walk
about from house to house, and often went into other farms about the
island.

There was a man called Audun who dwelt at Windham; thither Grettir went
every day, and he made friends with Audun, and there he was wont to sit
till far on in the day. Now one night very late, as Grettir made ready
to go home,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

he saw a great fire burst out on a ness to the north of Audun's farm.
Grettir asked what new thing this might be. Audun said that he need be
in no haste to know that.

"It would be said," quoth Grettir, "if that were seen in our land, that
the flame burned above hid treasure."

The farmer said, "That fire I deem to be ruled over by one into whose
matters it avails little to pry."

"Yet fain would I know thereof," said Grettir.

"On that ness," said Audun, "stands a barrow, great and strong, wherein
was laid Karr the Old, Thorfinn's father; at first father and son had
but one farm in the island; but since Karr died he has so haunted this
place that he has swept away all farmers who owned lands here, so that
now Thorfinn holds the whole island; but whatsoever man Thorfinn holds
his hand over, gets no scathe."

Grettir said that he had told his tale well: "And," says he, "I shall
come here to-morrow, and then thou shalt have digging-tools ready."

"Now, I pray thee," says Audun, "to do nought herein, for I know that
Thorfinn will cast his hatred on thee therefor."

Grettir said he would risk that.

So the night went by, and Grettir came early on the morrow and the
digging-tools were ready; the farmer goes with him to the barrow, and
Grettir brake it open, and was rough-handed enough thereat, and did not
leave off till he came to the rafters, and by then the day was spent;
then he tore away the rafters, and now Audun prayed him hard not to go
into the barrow; Grettir bade him guard the rope, "but I shall espy what
dwells within here."

Then Grettir entered into the barrow, and right dark it was, and a smell
there was therein none of the sweetest. Now he groped about to see how
things were below; first

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

he found horse-bones, and then he stumbled against the arm of a
high-chair, and in that chair found a man sitting; great treasures of
gold and silver were heaped together there, and a small chest was set
under the feet of him full of silver, all these riches Grettir carried
together to the rope; but as he went out through the barrow he was
griped at right strongly; thereon he let go the treasure and rushed
against the barrow-dweller, and now they set on one another unsparingly
enough.

Everything in their way was kicked out of place, the barrow-wight
setting on with hideous eagerness; Grettir gave back before him for a
long time, till at last it came to this, that he saw it would not do to
hoard his strength any more; now neither spared the other, and they were
brought to where the horse-bones were, and thereabout they wrestled
long. And now one, now the other, fell on his knee; but the end of the
strife was, that the barrow-dweller fell over on his back with huge din.
Then ran Audun from the holding of the rope, and deemed Grettir dead.
But Grettir drew the sword, 'Jokul's gift,' and drave it at the neck of
the barrow-bider so that it took off his head, and Grettir laid it at
the thigh of him. <span id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) Then he went to the
rope with the treasure, and lo, Audun was clean gone, so he had to get
up the rope by his hands; he had tied a line to the treasure, and
therewith he now haled it up.

Grettir had got very stiff with his dealings with Karr, and now he went
back to Thorfinn's house with the treasures, whenas all folk had set
them down to table. Thorfinn gave Grettir a sharp look when he came into
the drinking-hall, and asked him what work he had on hand so needful to
do

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

that he might not keep times of meals with other men. Grettir answers,
"Many little matters will hap on late eves," and therewith he cast down
on the table all the treasure he had taken in the barrow; but one matter
there was thereof, on which he must needs keep his eyes; this was a
short sword, so good a weapon, that a better, he said, he had never
seen; and this he gave up the last of all. Thorfinn was blithe to see
that sword, for it was an heirloom of his house, and had never yet gone
out of his kin.

"Whence came these treasures to thine hand?" said Thorfinn.

Grettir sang--

"Lessener of the flame of sea,  
My strong hope was true to me,  
When I deemed that treasure lay  
In the barrow; from to-day  
Folk shall know that I was right;  
The begetters of the fight  
Small joy now shall have therein,  
Seeking dragon's-lair to win."

Thorfinn answered, "Blood will seldom seem blood to thine eyes; no man
before thee has had will to break open the barrow; but, because I know
that what wealth soever is hid in earth or borne into barrow is wrongly
placed, I shall not hold thee blameworthy for thy deed as thou hast
brought it all to me; yea, or whence didst thou get the good sword?"

Grettir answered and sang--

"Lessener of waves flashing flame,  
To my lucky hand this came <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
In the barrow where that thing  
Through the dark fell clattering  
If that helm-fire I should gain,  
Made so fair to be the bane  
Of the breakers of the bow,  
Ne'er from my hand should it go."

Thorfinn said, "Well hast thou prayed for it, but thou must show some
deed of fame before I give thee that sword, for never could I get it of
my father while he lived."

Said Grettir, "Who knows to whom most gain will come of it in the end?"

So Thorfinn took the treasures and kept the sword at his bed-head, and
the winter wore on toward Yule, so that little else fell out to be told
of.
