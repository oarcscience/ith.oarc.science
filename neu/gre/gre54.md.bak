# CHAP. XLIX.

The gathering to avenge Thorbiorn Oxmain.

THOROD Drapa-stump sought tidings of this who might have slain Thorbiorn
and his son, and when he came to Reeks, it was told him that Grettir had
been

there and given out the slayings as from his hand. Now, Thorod deemed he
saw how things had come to pass; so he went to Biarg, and there found
many folk, but he asked if Grettir were there.

The goodwife said he had ridden away, and that she would not slip him
into hiding-places if he were there.

"Now ye will be well pleased that matters have so been wrought; nor was
the slaying of Atli over-avenged, though this was paid for it. Ye asked
not then what grief of heart I had; and now, too, it is well that things
are even so."

Therewith they rode home, and found it not easy to do aught therein.

Now that spear-head which Grettir lost was not found till within the
memory of men living now; it was found in the latter days of Sturla
Thordson the lawman, and in that marsh where Thorbiorn fell, which is
now called Spearmead; and that sign men have to show that Thorbiorn was
slain there, though in some places it is said that he was slain on
Midfit.

Thorod and his kin heard that Grettir abode at Liarskogar; then they
gathered men, and were minded to go thither; but when Gamli of Meals was
ware thereof, he made Thorstein and Grettir sure of the farings of the
Ramfirthers; and when Thorstein knew it, he sent Grettir in to Tongue to
Snorri Godi, for then there was no strife between them, and Thorstein
gave that counsel to Grettir that he should pray Snorri the Godi for his
watch and ward; but if he would not grant it, he made Grettir go west to
Reekknolls to Thorgils Arison, "and he will take thee to him through
this winter, and keep within the Westfirths till these matters are
settled."

Grettir said he would take good heed to his counsels

then he rode into Tongue, and found Snorri the Godi, and talked with
him, and prayed him to take him in.

Snorri answered, "I grow an old man now, and loth am I to harbour
outlawed men if no need drive me thereto. What has come to pass that the
elder put thee off from him?"

Grettir said that Thorstein had often done well to him; "But more shall
I need than him alone, if things are to go well."

Said Snorri, "My good word I shall put in for thee if that may avail
thee aught, but in some other place than with me must thou seek a
dwelling."

With these words they parted, and Grettir turned west to Reekness; the
Ramfirthers with their band got as far as Samstead, and there they heard
that Grettir had departed from Liarskogar, and thereat they went back
home.
