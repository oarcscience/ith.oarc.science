# CHAP. LXIV.

Of the ill haps at Sand-heaps, and how Guest came to the Goodwife there.

THERE was a priest called Stein, who dwelt at Isledale-river, in
Bard-dale; he was good at husbandry and rich in beasts; his son was
Kiartan, a brisk man and a well-grown. Thorstein the White was the name
of him who dwelt at Sand-heaps, south of Isledale-river; his wife was
called Steinvor, a young woman and merry-hearted, and children they had,
who were young in those days. But that place men deemed much haunted by
the goings of trolls.

Now it befell two winters before Grettir came into the north country
that Steinvor the goodwife of Sand-heaps fared at Yule-tide to the stead
of Isledale-river according to her wont, but the goodman abode at home.
Men lay down to sleep in the evening, but in the night they heard a huge
crashing about the bonder's bed; none durst arise and see thereto, for
very few folk were there. In the morning the goodwife came home, but the
goodman was gone, and none knew what had become of him.

Now the next year wears through its seasons, but the winter after the
goodwife would fain go to worship, and bade her house-carle abide behind
at home; thereto was he loth, but said nathless that she must rule; so
all went the same way and the house-carle vanished; and marvellous men
deemed it; but folk saw certain stains of blood about the outer door;
therefore they deemed it sure that an evil wight had taken them both.

Now that was heard of wide through the country-side, and Grettir withal
was told thereof; so he took his way to Bard-dale, and came to
Sand-heaps at Yule-eve, and made stay there, and called himself Guest.
The goodwife saw that he was marvellous great of growth, but the
homefolk were exceeding afeard of him; he prayed for guesting there; the
mistress said that there was meat ready for him, "but as to thy safety
see to that thyself."

He said that so he should do: "Here will I abide, but thou shalt go to
worship if thou wilt."

She answered, "Meseems thou art a brave man if thou durst abide at home
here."

"*For one thing alone will I not be known*," said he.

She said, "I have no will to abide at home, but I may not cross the
river."

"I will go with thee," says Guest.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Then she made her ready for worship, and her little daughter with her.
It thawed fast abroad, and the river was in flood, and therein was the
drift of ice great: then said the goodwife,

"No way across is there either for man or horse."

"Nay, there will be fords there," said Guest, "be not afeard."

"Carry over the little maiden first," said the goodwife; "she is the
lightest."

"I am loth to make two journeys of it," said Guest, "I will bear thee in
my arms."

She crossed herself, and said, "This will not serve what wilt thou do
with the maiden?"

"A rede I see for that," said he, and therewith caught them both up, and
laid the little one in her mother's lap, and set both of them thus on
his left arm, but had his right free; and so he took the ford withal,
nor durst they cry out, so afeard were they.

Now the river took him up to his breast forthwith, and a great ice-floe
drave against him, but he put forth the hand that was free and thrust it
from him; then it grew so deep, that the stream broke over his shoulder;
but he waded through it stoutly, till he came to the further shore, and
there cast them a-land: then he turned back, and it was twilight already
by then he came home to Sand-heaps, and called for his meat.

So when he was fulfilled, he bade the home-folk go into the chamber;
then he took boards and loose timber, and dragged it athwart the
chamber, and made a great bar, so that none of the home-folk might come
thereover: none durst say aught against him, nor would any of them make
the least sound. The entrance was through the side-wall of the chamber
by the gable-end, along which there was a

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

dais athwart the room; there Guest lay down, but did not put off his
clothes, and light burned in the chamber over against the door: and thus
Guest lay till far on in the night.

The goodwife came to Isledale-river at church-time, and men marvelled
how she had crossed the river; and she said she knew not whether a man
or a troll had brought her over.

The priest said he was surely a man, though a match for few; "But let us
hold our peace hereon," he said; "maybe he is chosen for the bettering
of thy troubles." So the goodwife was there through the night.
