# CHAP. V.

THE summer after this they made ready to fare west to Ireland. But at
that time Balk and Hallvard betook themselves from the lands west over
the Sea, and went out to Iceland, for from thence came tales of land
good to choose. Balk settled land in Ramfirth and dwelt at either
Balkstead; Hallvard settled Sweepingsfirth, and Hallwick out to the
Stair, and dwelt there.

Now Thrand and Onund met Eyvind the Eastman, and he received his brother
well; but when he knew that Onund was come with him, then he waxed
wroth, and would fain set on him. Thrand bade him do it not, and said
that it was not for him to wage war against Northmen, and least of all
such men as fared peaceably. Eyvind said that he fared otherwise before,
and had broken the peace of Kiarval the King, and that he should now pay
for all. Many words the brothers had over this, till Thrand said at last
that one fate should befall both him and Onund; and then Eyvind let
himself be appeased.

So they dwelt there long that summer, and went on warfare with Eyvind,
who found Onund to be the bravest of men. In the autumn they fared to
the South-isles, and Eyvind gave to Thrand to take all the heritage of
their father, if Biorn should die before Thrand.

Now were the twain in the South-isles until they wedded their wives, and
some winters after withal.
