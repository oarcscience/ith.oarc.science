# CHAP. LIV.

Grettir meets Hallmund on the Keel.

NOW Grettir fared from Tongue up to Hawkdale, and thence north upon the
Keel, and kept about there long that summer; nor was there trust of him
that he would not take men's goods from them, as they went from or to
the north over the Keel, because he was hard put to it to get wares.

Now on a day, when as Grettir would keep about the

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

north at Doveness-path, he saw a man riding from the north over the
Keel; he was huge to behold on horseback, and had a good horse, and an
embossed bridle well wrought; another horse he had in tow and bags
thereon; this man had withal a slouched hat on his head, nor could his
face be clearly seen.

Now Grettir looked hard at the horse and the goods thereon, and went to
meet the man, and greeting him asked his name, but he said he was called
Air. "I wot well what thou art called," said he, "for thou shalt be
Grettir the Strong, the son of Asmund. Whither art thou bound?"

"As to the place I have not named it yet," said Grettir; "but as to my
errand, it is to know if thou wilt lay down some of the goods thou
farest with."

Said Air, "Why should I give thee mine own, or what wilt thou give me
therefor?"

Grettir answers, "Hast thou not heard that I take, and give no money
again? and yet it seems to most men that I get what I will."

Said Air, "Give such choice as this to those who deem it good, but not
thus will I give up what I have; let each of us go his own way."

And therewithal he rode forth past Grettir and spurred his horse.

"Nay, we part not so hastily," said Grettir. and laid hold of the reins
of Air's horse in front of his hands, and held on with both hands.

Said Air, "Go thy ways, nought thou hast of me if I may hold mine own."

"That will now be proven," said Grettir.

Now Air stretched his hands down the head-gear and laid hold of the
reins betwixt Grettir's hands and the snaffle-rings and dragged at them
so hard that Grettir's hands were

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

drawn down along the reins, till Air dragged all the bridle from him.

Grettir looked into the hollow of his hands, and saw that this man must
have strength in claws rather than not, and he looked after him, and
said, "Whither art thou minded to fare?"

Air answered and sang--

"To the Kettle's side  
Now will I ride,  
Where the waters fall  
From the great ice-wall;  
If thou hast mind  
There mayest thou find  
With little stone <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md)  
Fist's land alone."

Grettir said, "It is of no avail to seek after thine abode if thou
tellest of it no clearer than this."

Then Air spake and sang--

"I would not hide  
Where I abide,  
If thou art fain  
To see me again;  
From that lone weald,  
Over Burgfirth field,  
That ye men name  
Balljokul, I came."

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

Thereat they parted, and Grettir sees that he has no strength against
this man; and therewithal he sang a stave--

"Too far on this luckless day,  
Atli, good at weapon-play,  
Brisk Illugi were from me;  
Such-like oft I shall not be  
As I was, when I must stand  
With the reins drawn through my hand  
By the unflinching losel Air.  
Maids weep when they know I fear."

Thereafter Grettir went to the south from the Keel; and rode to Hjalli
and found Skapti, and prayed for watch and ward from him.

Skapti said, "It is told me that thou farest somewhat lawlessly, and
layest hand on other men's goods; and this beseems thee ill, great of
kin as thou art. Now all would make a better tale, if thou didst not rob
and reive; but whereas I have to bear the name of lawman in the land,
folk would not abide that I should take outlawed men to me, and break
the laws thereby. I will that thou seek some place wherein thou wilt not
have need to take men's goods from them."

Grettir said he would do even so, yet withal that he might scarcely be
alone because he so feared the dark.

Skapti said that of that one thing then, which he deemed the best, be
might not avail himself; "But put not such trust in any as to fare as
thou didst in the Westfirths; it has been many a man's bane that he has
been too trustful."

Grettir thanked him for his wholesome redes, and so turned back to
Burgfirth in the autumn, and found Grim

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Thorhallson, his friend, and told him of Skapti's counsels; so Grim bade
him fare north to Fishwater lakes on Ernewaterheath; and thus did he.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[161:\*](gre59.htm#fr_16.md) Hall, a stone: mund, a
hand, and by periphrasis, 'land of a fist'; so that Hallmund is meant by
this couplet, and that was the real name of "Air," who is not a mere
man, but a friendly spirit of the mountains.
