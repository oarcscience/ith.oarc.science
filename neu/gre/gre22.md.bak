# CHAP. XVII.

Of Grettir's Voyage out.

THERE was a man called Haflidi, who dwelt at Reydarfell in
Whiteriverside, he was a seafaring man

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

and had a sailing ship, which lay up Whiteriver: there was a man on
board his ship hight Bard, who had a wife with him young and fair.
Asmund sent a man to Haflidi, praying him to take Grettir and look after
him; Haflidi said that he had heard that the man was ill ruled of mood;
yet for the sake of the friendship between him and Asmund he took
Grettir to himself, and made ready for sailing abroad.

Asmund would give to his son no faring-goods but victuals for the voyage
and a little wadmall. Grettir prayed him for some weapon, but Asmund
answered, "Thou hast not been obedient to me, nor do I know how far thou
art likely to work with weapons things that may be of any gain; and no
weapon shalt thou have of me."

"*No deed no reward*," says Grettir. Then father and son parted with
little love. Many there were who bade Grettir farewell, but few bade him
come back.

But his mother brought him on his road, and before they parted she spoke
thus, "Thou art not fitted out from home, son, as I fain would thou
wert, a man so well born as thou; but, meseems, the greatest shortcoming
herein is that thou hast no weapons of any avail, and my mind misgives
me that thou wilt perchance need them sorely."

With that she took out from under her cloak a sword well wrought, and a
fair thing it was, and then she said, "This sword was owned by Jokul, my
father's father, and the earlier Waterdale men, and it gained them many
a day; now I give thee the sword, and may it stand thee in good stead."

Grettir thanked her well for this gift, and said he deemed it better
than things of more worth; then he went on his way, and Asdis wished him
all good hap.

Now Grettir rode south over the heath, and made no stay till he came to
the ship. Haflidi gave him a good

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

welcome and asked him for his faring-goods, then Grettir sang-

Rider of wind-driven steed,  
Little gat I to my need,  
When I left my fair birth-stead,  
From the snatchers of worm's bed;  
But this man's-bane hanging here,  
Gift of woman good of cheer,  
Proves the old saw said not ill,  
*Best to bairn is mother still*."

Haflidi said it was easily seen that she thought the most of him. But
now they put to sea when they were ready, and had wind at will; but when
they had got out over all shallows they hoisted sail.

Now Grettir made a den for himself under the boat, from whence he would
move for nought, neither for baling, nor to do aught at the sail, nor to
work at what he was bound to work at in the ship in even shares with the
other men, neither would he buy himself off from the work.

Now they sailed south by Reekness and then south from the land; and when
they lost land they got much heavy sea; the ship was somewhat leaky, and
scarce seaworthy in heavy weather, therefore they had it wet enough. Now
Grettir let fly his biting rhymes, whereat the men got sore wroth. One
day, when it so happened that the weather was both squally and cold, the
men called out to Grettir, and bade him now do manfully: "For," said
they, "now our claws grow right cold." Grettir looked up and said--

Good luck, scurvy starvelings, if I should behold  
Each finger ye have doubled up with the cold."

And no work they got out of him, and now it misliked

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

them of their lot as much again as before, and they said that he should
pay with his skin for his rhymes and the lawlessness which he did. "Thou
art more fain," said they, "of playing with Bard the mate's wife than
doing thy duty on board ship, and this is a thing not to be borne at
all."

The gale grew greater steadily, and now they stood baling for days and
nights together, and all swore to kill Grettir. But when Haflidi heard
this, he went up to where Grettir lay, and said, "Methinks the bargain
between thee and the chapmen is scarcely fair; first thou dost by them
unlawfully, and thereafter thou castest thy rhymes at them; and now they
swear that they will throw thee overboard, and this is unseemly work to
go on."

"Why should they not be free to do as they will?" says Grettir; "but I
well would that one or two of them tarry here behind with me, or ever I
go overboard."

Haflidi says, "Such deeds are not to be done, and we shall never thrive
if ye rush into such madness; but I shall give thee good rede."

"What is that?" says Grettir.

"They blame thee for singing ill things of them; now, therefore, I would
that thou sing some scurvy rhyme to me, for then it might be that they
would bear with thee the easier."

"To thee I never sing but good," says Grettir: "I am not going to make
thee like these starvelings."

"One may sing so," says Haflidi, "that the lampoon be not so foul when
it is searched into, though at first sight it be not over fair."

"I have ever plenty of that skill in me," says Grettir.

Then Haflidi went to the men where they were baling, and said, "Great is
your toil, and no wonder that ye have taken ill liking to Grettir."

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

"But his lampoons we deem worse than all the rest together," they said.

Haflidi said in a loud voice, "He will surely fare ill for it in the
end."

But when Grettir heard Haflidi speak blamefully of him, he sang

"Otherwise would matters be,  
When this shouting Haflidi  
Ate in house at Reydarfell  
Curdled milk, and deemed it well  
He who decks the reindeer's side  
That 'twixt ness and ness doth glide,  
Twice in one day had his fill  
Of the feast of dart shower shrill."  <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

The shipmen thought this foul enough, and said he should not put shame
on Skipper Haflidi for nought.

Then said Haflidi, "Grettir is plentifully worthy that ye should do him
some shame, but I will not have my honour staked against his ill-will
and recklessness; nor is it good for us to wreak vengeance for this
forthwith while we have this danger hanging over us; but be ye mindful
of it when ye land, if so it seem good to you."

"Well," they said, "why should we not fare even as thou farest? for why
should his vile word bite us more than thee?"

And in that mind Haflidi bade them abide; and thenceforward the chapmen
made far less noise about Grettir's rhymes than before.

Now a long and a hard voyage they had, and the leak

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

gained on the ship, and men began to be exceeding worn with toil. The
young wife of the mate was wont to sew from Grettir's hands, and much
would the crew mock him therefor; but Haflidi went up to where Grettir
lay and sang--

"Grettir, stand up from thy grave,  
In the trough of the grey wave  
The keel labours, tell my say  
Now unto thy merry may;  
From thy hands the linen-clad  
Fill of sewing now has had,  
Till we make the land will she  
Deem that labour fitteth thee."

Then Grettir stood up and sang--

"Stand we up, for neath us now  
Rides the black ship high enow;  
This fair wife will like it ill  
If my limbs are laid here still  
Certes, the white trothful one  
Will not deem the deed well done,  
If the work that I should share  
Other folk must ever bear."

Then he ran aft to where they were baling, and asked what they would he
should do; they said he would do mighty little good.

"Well," said he, "*ye may yet be apaid of a man's aid*."

Haflidi bade them not set aside his help, "For it may be he shall deem
his hands freed if he offers his aid."

At that time pumping was not used in ships that fared

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

over the main; the manner of baling they used men called tub or cask
baling, and a wet work it was and a wearisome; two balers were used, and
one went down while the other came up. Now the chapmen bade Grettir have
the job of sinking the balers, and said that now it should be tried what
he could do; he said that the less it was tried the better it would be.
But he goes down and sinks the balers, and now two were got to bale
against him; they held out but a little while before they were overcome
with weariness, and then four came forward and soon fared in likewise,
and, so say some, that eight baled against him before the baling was
done and the ship was made dry. Thenceforth the manner of the chapmen's
words to Grettir was much changed, for they saw what strength he had to
fall back upon; and from that time he was the stoutest and readiest to
help, wheresoever need was.

Now they bore off cast into the main, and much thick weather they had,
and one night unawares they ran suddenly on a rock, so that the nether
part of the ship went from under her; then the boat was run down, and
women and all the loose goods were brought off: nearby was a little holm
whither they brought their matters as they best could in the night; but
when it began to dawn they had a talk as to where they were come; then
they who had fared between lands before knew the land for Southmere in
Norway; there was an island hardby called Haramsey; many folk dwelt
there, and therein too was the manor of a lord.
