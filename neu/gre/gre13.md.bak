# CHAP. VIII.

NOW Onund and Asmund sailed into the sea when they were ready, and held
company together; then sang Onund this stave--

Meet was I in days agone  
For storm, wherein the Sweeping One,  
Midst rain of swords, and the darts' breath,  
Blew o'er all a gale of death.  
Now a maimed, one-footed man  
On rollers' steed through waters wan  
Out to Iceland must I go;  
Ah, the skald is sinking low."

They had a hard voyage of it and much of baffling gales from the south,
and drove north into the main; but they made Iceland, and were by then
come to the north off Longness when they found where they were: so
little space there was betwixt them that they spake together; and Asmund
said that they had best sail to Islefirth, and thereto they both agreed;
then they beat up toward the land, and a south-east wind sprang up; but
when Onund and his folk laid the ship close to the wind, the yard was
sprung; then they took in sail, and therewith were driven off to sea;
but Asmund got under the lee of Brakeisle, and there lay till a fair
wind brought him into Islefirth; Helgi the Lean gave him all
Kræklings'-lithe, and he dwelt at South Glass-river; Asgrim his brother
came out some winters later and abode at North Glass-river; he was the
father of Ellida-Grim, the father of Asgrim Ellida-Grimson.
