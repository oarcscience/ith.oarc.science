# CHAP. XCV.

How Thorstein Dromund and Spes fared to Rowe and died there.

NOW they went their ways till they came to Rome-town; and so when they
came before him, who was appointed to hear the shrifts of men, they told
him well and truly all things even as they had happed, and with what
cunning and craft they had joined together in wedlock; therewithal they
gave themselves up with great humility to such penance for the amending
of their lives as he should lay on them; but because that they
themselves had turned their minds to the atoning of their faults,
without any urging or anger from the rulers of the church, they were
eased of all fines as much as might be, but were bidden gently that they
should now and henceforth concern themselves reasonably for their souls'
health, and from this time forward live in chastity, since they had
gotten them release from all their guilt; and herewith they were deemed
to have fared well and wisely.

Then said Spes, "Now, meseems, our matters have gone well and are come
to an end, and no unlucky life have we had together; yet maybe fools
will do after the pattern of our former life; now therefore let us make
such an end to all, that good men also may follow after us and do the
like: so let us go bargain with those who are deft in stone-craft; that
they make for each of us a cell of stone, that we may thereby atone for
what we have done against God."

So Thorstein laid down money for the making of a stone cell for each of
them, and for such-like other things as they might need, and might not
be without for the keeping of

their lives; and then, when the stone work was done, and the time was
meet therefor and all things were ready, they departed their worldly
fellowship of their own free will, that they might the more enjoy a holy
fellowship in another world. And there they abode both in their stone
cells, and lived as long as God would have it, and so ended their lives.
And most men say that Thorstein Dromund and Spes his wife may be deemed
to be folk of the greatest good luck, all things being accounted of; but
neither his children or any of his issue have come to Iceland for a tale
to be made of them.

Now Sturla the Lawman says so much as that he deems no outlawed man ever
to have been so mighty as Grettir the Strong; and thereto he puts forth
three reasons--

And first in that he was the wisest of them all; for the longest in
outlawry he was of any man, and was never won whiles he was hale.

And again, in that he was the strongest in all the land among men of a
like age; and more fitted to lay ghosts and do away with hauntings than
any other.

And thirdly, in that he was avenged out in Micklegarth, even as no other
man of Iceland has been; and this withal, that Thorstein Dromund, who
avenged him, was so lucky a man in his last days.

So here ends the story of Grettir Asmundson, our fellow-countryman.
Thank have they who listened thereto; but thank little enow to him who
scribbled out the tale.

GOOD PEOPLE, HERE THE WORK HATH END: MAY ALL FOLK TO THE GOOD GOD WEND!
