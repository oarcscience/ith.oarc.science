# CHAP. IX.

NOW it is to be told of Onund Treefoot that he drave out to sea for
certain days, but at last the wind got round to the north, and they
sailed for land: then those knew who had been there before that they had
come west off the Skagi; then they sailed into Strand-Bay, and near to
the South-Strands, and there rowed toward them six men in a ten-oared
boat, who bailed the big ship, and asked who was their captain; Onund
named himself, and asked whence they came; they said they were
house-carles of Thorvald, from Drangar; Onund asked if all land through
the Strands had been settled; they said there was little unsettled in
the inner Strands, and none north thereof. Then

Onund asked his shipmates, whether they would make for the west country,
or take such as they had been told of; they chose to view the land
first. So they sailed in up the bay, and brought to in a creek off
Arness, then put forth a boat and rowed to land. There dwelt a rich man,
Eric Snare, who had taken land betwixt Ingolfs-firth, and Wayless in
Fishless; but when Eric knew that Onund was come there, he bade him take
of his hands whatso he would, but said that there was little that had
not been settled before. Onund said he would first see what there was;
so they went landward south past some firths, till they came to Wayless;
then said Eric, "Here is what there is to look to; all from here is
unsettled, and right in to the settlements of Bjorn." Now a great
mountain went down the eastern side of the firth, and snow had fallen
thereon, Onund looked on that mountain, and sang--

"Brand-whetter's life awry doth go.  
Fair lands and wide full well I know;  
Past house, and field, and fold of man,  
The swift steed of the rollers ran:  
My lands, and kin, I left behind,  
That I this latter day might find,  
Coldback for sunny meads to have;  
Hard fate a bitter bargain drave."

Eric answered, "Many have lost so much in Norway, that it may not be
bettered: and I think withal that most lands in the main-settlements are
already settled, and therefore I urge thee not to go from hence; but I
shall hold to what I spake, that thou mayst have whatso of my lands
seems meet to thee." Onund said, that he would take that offer, and so
he settled land out from Wayless over the three

creeks, Byrgis-Creek, Kolbein's-Creek, and Coldback-Creek, up to
Coldback-Cleft. Thereafter Eric gave him all Fishless, and Reekfirth,
and all Reekness, out on that side of the firth; but as to drifts there
was nought set forth, for they were then so plentiful that every man had
of them what he would. Now Onund set up a household at Coldback, and had
many men about him; but when his goods began to grow great he had
another stead in Reekfirth. Kolbein dwelt at Kolbein's-Creek. So Onund
abode in peace for certain winters.
