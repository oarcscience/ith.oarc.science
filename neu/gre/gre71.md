# CHAP. LXVI.

Of the Dweller in the Cave under the Force.

NOW it is to be told of Grettir that he set a stone in a bight of the
rope and let it sink down into the water.

"In what wise hast thou mind to go?" said the priest.

"I will not go bound into the force," said Grettir; "such things doth my
heart forebode."

With that he got ready for his journey, and was lightly clad, and girt
with the short-sword, and had no weapon more. Then he leapt off the
cliff into the force; the priest saw the soles of his feet, and knew not
afterwards what was become of him. But Grettir dived under the force,
and hard work it was, because the whirlpool was strong, and he had to
dive down to the bottom, before he might come up under the force. But
thereby was a rock jutting out, and thereon he gat; a great cave was
under the force, and the river fell over it from the sheer rocks. He
went up into the cave, and there was a great fire flaming from amidst of
brands; and there he saw a giant sitting withal, marvellously great and
dreadful to look on. But when Grettir came anigh, the giant leapt up and
caught up a glaive and smote at the newcomer, for with that glaive might
a man both cut and thrust; a wooden shaft it had, and that fashion of
weapon men called then, heft-sax. Grettir hewed back against him with
the short-sword, and smote the shaft so that he struck it asunder; then
was the giant fain to stretch aback for a sword that hung up there in
the cave; but therewithal. Grettir smote him afore into the breast, and
smote off well-nigh all the breast-bone

and the belly, so that the bowels tumbled out of him and fell into the
river, and were driven down along the stream; and as the priest sat by
the rope, he saw certain fibres all covered with blood swept down the
swirls of the stream; then he grew unsteady in his place, and thought
for sure that Grettir was dead, so he ran from the holding of the rope
and gat him home. Thither he came in the evening and said, as one who
knew it well, that Grettir was dead, and that great scathe was it of
such a man.

Now of Grettir must it be told that he let little space go betwixt his
blows or ever the giant was dead; then he went up the cave, and kindled
a light and espied the cave. The story tells not how much he got
therein, but men deem that it must have been something great. But there
he abode on into the night; and he found there the bones of two men, and
bore them together in a bag; then he made off from the cave and swain to
the rope and shook it, and thought that the priest would be there yet;
but when he knew that the priest had gone home, then must be draw
himself up by strength of hand, and thus he came up out on to the cliff.

Then he fared home to Isledale-river, and brought into the church-porch
the bag with the bones, and therewithal a rune-staff whereon this song
was marvellous well cut--

"There into gloomy gulf I passed,  
O'er which from the rock's threat it cast  
The swirling rush of waters wan,  
To meet the sword-player feared of man,  
By giant's hall the strong stream pressed  
Cold hands against the singer's breast;  
Huge weight upon him there did hurl  
The swallower of the changing whirl."

And this other one withal--

"The dreadful dweller of the cave  
Great strokes and many 'gainst me drave  
Full hard he had to strive for it,  
But toiling long he wan no whit  
For from its mighty shaft of tree  
The heft-sax smote I speedily;  
And dulled the flashing war-flame fair  
In the black breast that met me there."

Herein was it said how that Grettir had brought those bones from the
cave; but when the priest came to the church in the morning he found the
staff and that which went with it, but Grettir was gone home to
Sand-heaps.
