# CHAP. X.

NOW Onund was so brisk a man, that few, even of whole men, could cope
with him; and his name withal was well known throughout the land,
because of his forefathers. After these things, befell that strife
betwixt Ufeigh Grettir and Thorbiorn Earls'-champion, which had such
ending, that Ufeigh fell before Thorbiorn in Grettir's-Gill, near Heel.
There were many drawn together to the sons of Ufeigh concerning the
blood-suit, and Onund Treefoot was sent for, and rode south in the
spring, and guested at Hvamm, with Aud the Deep-minded, and she gave him
exceeding good welcome, because he had been with her west over the Sea.
In those days Olaf Feilan, her son's son, was a man full grown, and Aud
was by then worn with great eld; she bade Onund know that she would have
Olaf, her kinsman, married; and was fain that he should woo Aldis of
Barra, who was cousin to Asa, whom Onund had to wife. Onund deemed the
matter hopeful, and Olaf rode south with him. So when Onund met his
friends and kin-in-law

they bade him abide with them: then was the suit talked over, and was
laid to Kialarnes Thing, for as then the Althing was not yet set up. So
the case was settled by umpiredom, and heavy weregild came for the
slayings, and Thorbiorn Earls'-champion was outlawed. His son was
Solmund, the father of Kari the Singed; father and son dwelt abroad a
long time afterwards.

Thrand bade Onund and Olaf to his house, and so did Thormod Shaft, and
they backed Olaf's wooing, which was settled with ease, because men knew
how mighty a woman Aud was. So the bargain was made, and, so much being
done, Onund rode home, and Aud thanked him well for his help to Olaf.
That autumn Olaf Feilan wedded Aldis of Barra; and then died Aud the
Deep-minded, as is told in the story of the Laxdale men.
