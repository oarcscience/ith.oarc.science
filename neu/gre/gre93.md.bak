# CHAP. LXXXVIII.

Thorbiorn Angle goes to Norway, and thence to Micklegarth.

THORBIORN Angle took ship at Goose-ere, with whatso of his goods he
might take with him; but Hialti his brother took to him his lands, and
Angle gave him Drangey withal. Hialti became a great chief in
aftertimes, but he has nought more to do with this tale.

So Angle fared out to Norway; he yet made much of himself, for he deemed
he had wrought a great deed in the slaying of Grettir, and so thought
many others, who knew not how all had come to pass, for many knew how
renowned a man Grettir had been; withal Angle told just so much of their
dealings together as might do him honour, and let such of the tale he
quiet as was of lesser glory.

Now this tale came in the autumn-tide east to Tunsberg,

and when Thorstein Dromund heard of the slayings he grew all silent,
because it was told him that Angle was a mighty man and a hardy; and he
called to mind the words which he had spoken when he and Grettir talked
together, long time agone, concerning the fashion of their arms.

So Thorstein put out spies on Angle's goings; they were both in Norway
through the winter, but Thorbiorn was in the north-country, and
Thorstein in Tunsberg, nor had either seen other; yet was Angle ware
that Grettir had a brother in Norway, and thought it hard to keep guard
of himself in an unknown land, wherefore he sought counsel as to where
he should betake himself. Now in those days many Northmen went out to
Micklegarth, and took war-pay there; so Thorbiorn deemed it would be
good to go thither and get to him thereby both fee and fame, nor to
abide in the Northlands because of the kin of Grettir. So he made ready
to go from Norway, and get him gone from out the land, and made no stay
till he came to Micklegarth, and there took war-hire.
