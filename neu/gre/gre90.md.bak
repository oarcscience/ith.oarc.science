# CHAP. LXXXV.

How Thorbiorn Angle claimed Grettir's Head-money.

"A GREAT champion have we laid to earth here," said Thorbiorn; "now
shall we bring the head aland with us, for I will not lose the money
which has been laid thereon; nor may they then feign that they know not
if I have slain Grettir."

They bade him do his will, but had few words to say hereon, for to all
the deed seemed a deed of little prowess.

Then Angle fell to speaking with Illugi,

"Great scathe it is of such a brave man as thou art, that thou hast
fallen to such folly, as to betake thee to ill deeds

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

with this outlaw here, and must needs lie slain and unatoned therefor."

Illugi answered, "Then first when the Althing is over this summer, wilt
thou know who are outlaws; but neither thou nor the carline, thy
foster-mother, will judge in this matter, because that your sorcery and
craft of old days have slain Grettir, though thou didst, indeed, bear
steel against him, as he lay at death's door, and wrought that so great
coward's deed there, over and above thy sorcery."

Then said Angle, "In manly wise speakest thou, but not thus will it be;
and I will show thee that I think great scathe in thy death, for thy
life will I give thee if thou wilt swear an oath for us here, to avenge
thyself on none of those who have been in this journey."

Illugi said, "That might I have deemed a thing to talk about, if Grettir
had been suffered to defend himself, and ye had won him with manliness
and hardihood; but now nowise is it to be thought, that I will do so
much for the keeping of my life, as to become base, even as thou art:
and here I tell thee, once for all, that no one of men shall be of less
gain to thee than I, if I live; for long will it be or ever I forget how
ye have prevailed against Grettir.--Yea, much rather do I choose to
die."

Then Thorbiorn Angle held talk with his fellows, whether they should let
Illugi live or not; they said that, whereas he had ruled the journey,
so, should he rule the deeds; so Angle said that he knew not how to have
that man hanging over his head, who would neither give troth, nor
promise aught.

But when Illugi knew that they were fully minded to slay him, he
laughed, and spake thus,

"Yea, now have your counsels sped, even as my heart would."

So at the dawning of the day they brought him to the eastern end of the
island, and there slaughtered him; but all men praised his great heart,
and deemed him unlike to any of his age.

They laid both the brothers in cairn on the island there; and thereafter
took Grettir's head, and bore it away with them, and whatso goods there
were in weapons or clothes; but the good short-sword Angle would not put
into the things to be shared, and he bare it himself long afterwards.
Noise they took with them, and he bore himself as ill as might be.

At nightfall the gale abated, and they rowed aland in the morning. Angle
took land at the handiest place, and sent the craft out to Biorn; but by
then they were come hard by Oyce-land, Noise began to bear himself so
ill, that they were loth to fare any longer with him, so there they slew
him, and long and loud he greeted or ever he was cut down.

Thorbiorn Angle went home to Woodwick, and deemed he had done in manly
wise in this journey; but Grettir's head they laid in salt in the
out-bower at Woodwick, which was called therefrom Grettir's-bower; and
there it lay the winter long. But Angle was exceeding ill thought of for
this work of his, as soon as folk knew that Grettir had been overcome by
sorcery.

Thorbiorn Angle sat quiet till past Yule; then he rode to meet Thorir of
Garth, and told him of these slayings; and this withal, that he deemed
that money his due which had been put on Grettir's head. Thorir said
that he might not hide that he had brought about Grettir's outlawry,

"Yea, and oft have I dealt hardly with him, yet so much for the taking
of his life I would not have done, as to make me a misdoer, a man of
evil craft, even as thou hast done;

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

and the less shall I lay down that money for thee, in that I deem thee
surely to be a man of forfeit life because of thy sorcery and
wizard-craft."

Thorbiorn Angle answers, "Me seems thou art urged hereto more by
closefistedness and a poor mind, than by any heed of how Grettir was
won."

Thorir said that a short way they might make of it, in that they should
abide the Althing, and take whatso the Lawman might deem most rightful:
and in such wise they parted that there was no little ill-will betwixt
Thorir and Thorbiorn Angle.
