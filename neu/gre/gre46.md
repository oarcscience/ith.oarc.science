# CHAP. XLI.

Of Thorstein Dromond's Arms, and what he deemed they might do.

NOW Grettir was with Thorstein for the rest of the winter and on into
the spring; and it befell one morning, as those brothers, Thorstein and
Grettir, lay in their sleeping-loft, that Grettir had laid his arms
outside the bedclothes; and Thorstein was awake and saw it. Now Grettir
woke up a little after, and then spake Thorstein:

"I have seen thine arms, kinsman," said he, "and I deem it nowise
wonderful, though thy strokes fall heavy on many, for no man's arms have
I seen like thine."

"Thou mayst know well enough," said Grettir, "that I should not have
brought such things to pass as I have wrought, if I were not well knit."

"Better should I deem it," said Thorstein, "if they were slenderer and
somewhat luckier withal."

Grettir said, "True it is, as folk say, *No man makes himself*; but let
me see thine arms," said he.

Thorstein did so; he was the longest and gauntest of men; and Grettir
laughed, and said,

"No need to look at that longer; hooked together are the ribs in thee;
nor, methinks, have I ever seen such tongs as thou bearest about, and I
deem thee to be scarce of a woman's strength."

"That may be," said Thorstein; "yet shalt thou know that these same thin
arms shall avenge thee, else shalt thou never be avenged; who may know
what shall be, when all is over and done?"

No more is told of their talk together; the spring wore on, and Grettir
took ship in the summer. The brothers parted in friendship, and saw each
other never after.
