# CHAP. LXXXI.

Of the Carline's evil Gift to Grettir.

NOW wore away the time of autumn till it wanted but three weeks of
winter; then the carline bade bear her to the sea-shore. Thorbiorn asked
what she would there.

"Little is my errand, yet maybe," she says, "it is a foreboding of
greater tidings."

Now was it done as she bade, and when she came down to the strand, she
went limping along by the sea, as if she were led thereto, unto a place
where lay before her an uprooted tree, as big as a man might bear on his
shoulder. She looked at the tree and bade them turn it over before her
eyes, and on one side it was as if singed and rubbed; so there whereas
it was rubbed she let cut a little flat space; and then she took her
knife and cut runes on the root, and made them red with her blood, and
sang witch-words over

them; then she went backwards and widdershins round about the tree, and
cast over it many a strong spell; thereafter she let thrust the tree
forth into the sea, and spake in such wise over it, that it should drive
out to Drangey, and that Grettir should have all hurt therefrom that
might be. Thereafter she went back home to Woodwick; and Thorbiorn said
that he knew not if that would come to aught; but the carline answered
that he should wot better anon.

Now the wind blew landward up the firth, yet the carline's root went in
the teeth of the wind, and belike it sailed swifter than might have been
looked for of it.

Grettir abode in Drangey with his fellows as is aforesaid, and in good
case they were; but the day after the carline had wrought her
witch-craft on the tree the brothers went down below the cliffs
searching for firewood, so when they came to the west of the island,
there they found that tree

drifted ashore.

Then said Illugi, "A big log of firewood, kinsman, let us bear it home."

Grettir kicked it with his foot and said, "An evil tree from evil sent;
other firewood than this shall we have."

Therewithal he cast it out into the sea, and bade Illugi beware of
bearing it home, "For it is sent us for our ill-hap." And therewith they
went unto their abode, and said nought about it to the thrall. But the
next day they found the tree again, and it was nigher to the ladders
than heretofore, Grettir drave it out to sea, and said that it should
never be borne home.

Now the days wore on into summer, and a gale came on with much wet, and
the brothers were loth to be abroad, and bade Noise go search for
firewood.

He took it ill, and said he was ill served in that he had to drudge and
labour abroad in all the foulest weather; but

withal he went down to the beach before the ladders and found the
carline's tree there, and deemed things had gone well because of it; so
he took it up and bore it to the hut, and cast it down thereby with a
mighty thump.

Grettir heard it and said, "Noise has got something, so I shall go out
and see what it is."

Therewithal. he took up a wood-axe, and went out, and straightway Noise
said, "Split it up in as good wise as I have brought it home, then."

Grettir grew short of temper with the thrall, and smote the axe with
both hands at the log, nor heeded what tree it was; but as soon as ever
the axe touched the wood, it turned flatlings and glanced off therefrom
into Grettir's right leg above the knee, in such wise that it stood in
the bone, and a great wound was that. Then he looked at the tree and
said,

"Now has evil heart prevailed, nor will this hap go alone, since that
same tree has now come back to us that I have cast out to sea on these
two days. But for thee, Noise, two slips hast thou had, first, when thou
must needs let the fire be slaked, and now this bearing home of that
tree of ill-hap; but if a third thou hast, thy bane will it be, and the
bane of us all."

With that came Illugi and bound up Grettir's hurt, and it bled little,
and Grettir slept well that night; and so three nights slipped by in
such wise that no pain came of the wound, and when they loosed the
swathings, the lips of the wound were come together so that it was
well-nigh grown over again. Then said Illugi,

"Belike thou wilt have no long hurt of this wound."

"Well were it then," said Grettir, "but marvellously has this befallen,
whatso may come of it; and my mind misgives me of the way things will
take."
