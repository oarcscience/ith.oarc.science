# CHAPTER LXII.

Of the Death of Hallmund, Grettir's Friend.

A LITTLE after Grettir had gone from Ernewater heath, there came a man
thither, Grim by name, the son of the widow at Kropp. He had slain the
son of Eid Skeggison of the Ridge, and had been outlawed therefor; he
abode whereas Grettir had dwelt afore, and got much fish from the water.
Hallmund took it ill that he had come in Grettir's stead, and was minded
that he should have little good hap how much fish soever he caught.

So it chanced on a day that Grim had caught a hundred fish, and he bore
them to his hut and hung them up outside, but the next morning when he
came thereto they were all gone; that he deemed marvellous, and went to
the water; and now he caught two hundred fish, went home and stored them
up; and all went the same way, for they were all gone in the morning;
and now he thought it hard to trace all to one spring. But the third day
he caught three hundred fish, brought them home and watched over them
from his shed, looking out through a hole in the door to see if aught
might come anigh. Thus wore the night somewhat,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

and when the third part of the night was gone by, he heard one going
along outside with heavy footfalls; and when he was ware thereof, he
took an axe that he had, the sharpest of weapons, for he was fain to
know what this one was about; and he saw that the new-comer had a great
basket on his back. Now he set it down, and peered about, and saw no man
abroad; he gropes about to the fishes, and deems he has got a good
handful, and into the basket he scoops them one and all; then is the
basket full, but the fishes were so big that Grim, thought that no horse
might bear more. Now he takes them up and puts himself under the load,
and at that very point of time, when he was about to stand upright, Grim
ran out, and with both hands smote at his neck, so that the axe sank
into the shoulder; thereat he turned off sharp, and set off running with
the basket south over the mountain.

Grim turned off after him, and was fain to know if he had got enough.
They went south all the way to Balljokul, and there this man went into a
cave; a bright fire burnt in the cave, and thereby sat a woman, great of
growth, but shapely withal. Grim heard how she welcomed her father, and
called him Hallmund. He cast down his burden heavily, and groaned aloud;
she asked him why he was all covered with blood, but he answered and
sang--

"Now know I aright,  
That in man's might,  
And in man s bliss,  
No trust there is;  
On the day of bale  
Shall all things fall;  
Courage is o'er,  
Luck mocks no more."

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

She asked him closely of their dealings, but he told her all even as it
had befallen.

"Now shalt thou hearken," said he, "for I shall tell of my deeds and
sing a song thereon, and thou shalt cut it on a staff as I give it out."

So she did, and he sung Hallmund's song withal, wherein is this--

"When I drew adown  
The bridle brown  
Grettir's hard hold,  
Men deemed me bold;  
Long while looked then  
The brave of men  
In his hollow hands,  
The harm of lands.

"Then came the day  
Of Thorir's play  
On Ernelake-heath,  
When we from death  
Our life must gain;  
Alone we twain  
With eighty men  
Must needs play then.

"Good craft enow  
Did Grettir show  
On many a shield  
In that same field;  
Natheless I hear  
That my marks were  
The deepest still;  
The worst to fill.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

"Those who were fain  
His back to gain  
Lost head and hand,  
Till of the band,  
From the Well-wharf-side,  
Must there abide  
Eighteen behind  
That none can find.

"With the giant's kin  
Have I oft raised din  
To the rock folk  
Have I dealt out stroke;  
Ill things could tell  
That I smote full well;  
The half-trolls know  
My baneful blow.

"Small gain in me  
Did the elf-folk see,  
Or the evil wights  
Who ride anights."

   \*     \*     \*

Many other deeds of his did Hallmund sing in that song, for he had fared
through all the land.

Then spake his daughter, "A man of no slippery hand was that; nor was it
unlike that this should hap, for in evil wise didst thou begin with him:
and now what man will avenge thee?"

Hallmund answered, "It is not so sure to know how that may be; but,
methinks, I know that Grettir would avenge me if he might come thereto;
but no easy matter will it be

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

to go against the luck of this man, for much greatness lies stored up
for him."

Thereafter so much did Hallmund's might wane as the song wore, that
well-nigh at one while it befell that the song was done and Hallmund
dead; then she grew very sad and wept right sore. Then came Grim forth
and bade her be of better cheer, "*For all must fare when they are
fetched*. This has been brought about by his own deed, for I could
scarce look on while he robbed me."

She said he had much to say for it, "*For ill deed gains ill hap*."

Now as they talked she grew of better cheer, and Grim abode many nights
in the cave, and got the song by heart, and things went smoothly betwixt
them.

Grim abode at Ernewaterheath all the winter after Hallmund's death, and
thereafter came Thorkel Eyulfson to meet him on the Heath, and they
fought together; but such was the end of their play that Grim might have
his will of Thorkel's life, and slew him not. So Thorkel took him to
him, and got him sent abroad and gave him many goods; and therein either
was deemed to have done well to the other. Grim betook himself to
seafaring, and a great tale is told of him.
