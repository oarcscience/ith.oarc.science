#### THE STORY OF

# GRETTIR THE STRONG.

This First Part tells of the forefathers of Grettir in Norway, and how
they fled away before Harald Fairhair, and settled in Iceland; and of
their deeds in Iceland before Grettir was born.

## CHAP. I.

THERE was a man named Onund, who was the son of Ufeigh Clubfoot, the son
of Ivar the Smiter; Onund was brother of Gudbiorg, the mother of
Gudbrand Ball, the father of Asta, the mother of King Olaf the Saint.
Onund was an Uplander by the kin of his mother; but the kin of his
father dwelt chiefly about Rogaland and Hordaland. He was a great
viking, and went harrying west over the Sea. <span

him herein, and Orm the Wealthy withal, and Hallvard was the name of the
third of them. They had five ships, all well manned, and therewith they
harried in the South-isles; <span id="fr_4"></span>[+](#fn_4.md) and when
they came to Barra, they found there a king, called Kiarval, and he,
too, had five ships. They gave him battle, and a hard fray there was.
The men of Onund were of the eagerest, and on either side many fell; but
the

end of it was that the king fled with only one ship. So there the men of
Onund took both ships and much wealth, and abode there through the
winter. For three summers they harried throughout Ireland and Scotland,
and thereafter went to Norway.
