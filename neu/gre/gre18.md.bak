# CHAP. XIII.

NOW after this the brothers Thorgrim and Thorgeir shared their
possessions. Thorgrim took the chattels and Thorgeir the land; Thorgrim
betook himself to Midfirth and bought land at Biarg by the counsel of
Skeggi; he had to wife Thordis, daughter of Asmund of Asmund's-peak, who
had settled the Thingere lands: Thorgrim and Thordis had a son who was
called Asmund; he was a big man and a strong, wise withal, and the
fairest-haired of men, but his head grew grey early, wherefore he was
called Asmund the Greyhaired. Thorgrim grew to be a man very busy about
his household, and kept all his men

well to their work. Asmund would do but little work, so the father and
son had small fellowship together; and so things fared till Asmund had
grown of age; then he asked his father for travelling money; Thorgrim
said he should have little enough, but gave him somewhat of huckstering
wares.

Then Asmund went abroad, and his goods soon grew great; he sailed to
sundry lands, and became the greatest of merchants, and very rich; he
was a man well beloved and trusty, and many kinsmen he had in Norway of
great birth.

One autumn he guested east in the Wick with a great man who was called
Thorstein; he was an Uplander of kin, and had a sister called Ranveig,
one to be chosen before all women; her Asmund wooed, and gained her by
the help of Thorstein her brother; and there Asmund dwelt a while and
was held in good esteem: he had of Ranveig a son hight Thorstein,
strong, and the fairest of men, and great of voice; a man tall of growth
he was, but somewhat slow in his mien, and therefore was he called
Dromund. Now when Thorstein was nigh grown up, his mother fell sick and
died, and thereafter Asmund had no joy in Norway; the kin of Thorstein's
mother took his goods, and him withal to foster; but Asmund betook
himself once more to sea-faring, and became a man of great renown. Now
he brought his ship into Huna-water, and in those days was Thorkel
Krafla chief over the Waterdale folk; and he heard of Asmund's coming
out, and rode to the ship and bade Asmund to his house; and he dwelt at
Marstead in Waterdale; so Asmund went to be guest there. This Thorkel
was the son of Thorgrim the Godi of Corn-river, and was a very wise man.

Now this was after the coming out of Bishop Frederick,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

and Thorvald Kodran's son, and they dwelt at the Brooksmeet, when these
things came to pass: they were the first to preach the law of Christ in
the north country; Thorkel let himself be signed with the cross and many
men with him, and things enow betid betwixt the bishop and the
north-country folk which come not into this tale.

Now at Thorkel's was a woman brought up, Asdis by name, who was the
daughter of Bard, the son of Jokul, the son of Ingimund the Old, the son
of Thorstein, the son of Ketil the Huge: the mother of Asdis was Aldis
the daughter of Ufeigh Grettir, as is aforesaid; Asdis was as yet
unwedded, and was deemed the best match among women, both for her kin
and her possessions; Asmund was grown weary of seafaring, and was fain
to take up his abode in Iceland; so he took up the word, and wooed this
woman. Thorkel knew well all his ways, that he was a rich man and of
good counsel to hold his wealth; so that came about, that Asmund got
Asdis to wife; he became a bosom friend of Thorkel, and a great dealer
in matters of farming, cunning in the law, and far-reaching. And now a
little after this Thorgrim Greypate died at Biarg, and Asmund took the
heritage after him and dwelt there.
