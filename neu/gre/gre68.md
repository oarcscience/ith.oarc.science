# CHAP. LXIII.

How Grettir beguiled Thorir of Garth when he was nigh taking him.

NOW the story is to be taken up where Grettir came from the firths of
the east-country; and now he fared with hidden-head for that he would
not meet Thorir, and lay

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

out that summer on Madderdale-heath and in sundry places, and at whiles
he was at Reekheath.

Thorir heard that Grettir was at Reekheath, so he gathered men and rode
to the heath, and was well minded that Grettir should not escape this
time.

Now Grettir was scarce aware of them before they were on him; he was
just by a mountain-dairy that stood back a little from the wayside, and
another man there was with him, and when he saw their band, speedy
counsel must he take so he bade that they should fell the horses and
drag them into the dairy shed, and so it was done.

Then Thorir rode north over the heath by the dairy, and *missed friend
from stead*, for he found nought, and so turned back withal.

But when his band had ridden away west, then said Grettir, "They will
not deem their journey good if we be not found; so now shalt thou watch
our horses while I go meet them, a fair play would be shown them if they
knew me not."

His fellow strove to let him herein, yet he went nonetheless, and did on
him other attire, with a slouched hat over his face and a staff in his
hand, then be went in the way before them. They greeted him and asked if
he had seen any men riding over the heath.

"Those men that ye seek have I seen; but little was wanting e'ennow but
that ye found them, for there they were, on the south of yon bogs to the
left."

Now when they heard that, off they galloped out on to the bogs, but so
great a mire was there that nohow could they get on, and had to drag
their horses out, and were wallowing there the more part of the day;
and. they gave to the devil withal the wandering churl who had so
befooled them.

But Grettir turned back speedily to meet his fellow, and when they met
he sang this stave--

"Now make I no battle-field  
With the searching stems of shield.  
Rife with danger is my day,  
And alone I go my way:  
Nor shall I go meet, this tide,  
Odin's storm, but rather bide  
Whatso fate I next may have;  
Scarce, then, shalt thou deem me brave.

Thence where Thorir's company  
Thronging ride, I needs must flee;  
If with them I raised the din,  
Little thereby should I win;  
Brave men's clashing swords I shun,  
Woods must hide the hunted one;  
For through all things, good and ill,  
Unto life shall I hold still."

Now they ride at their swiftest west over the heath and forth by the
homestead at Garth, before ever Thorir came from the wilderness with his
band; and when they drew nigh to the homestead a man fell in with them
who knew them not.

Then saw they how a woman, young and grand of attire, stood without, so
Grettir asked who that woman would be. The new-comer said that she was
Thorir's daughter. Then Grettir sang this stave--

"O wise sun of golden stall,  
When thy sire comes back to hall,  
Thou mayst tell him without sin  
This, though little lies therein, <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>  
That thou saw'st me ride hereby,  
With but two in company,  
Past the door of Skeggi's son,  
Nigh his hearth, O glittering one."

Hereby the new-comer thought be knew who this would be, and he rode to
peopled parts and told how Grettir had ridden by.

So when Thorir came home, many deemed that Grettir had done the bed well
over their heads. But Thorir set spies on Grettir's ways, whereso he
might be. Grettir fell on such rede that he sent his fellow to the west
country with his horses; but he went up to the mountains and was in
disguised attire, and fared about north there in the early winter, so
that he was not known.

But all men deemed that Thorir had got a worse part than before in their
dealings together.
