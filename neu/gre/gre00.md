A life scarce worth the living, a poor fame  
Scarce worth the winning, in a wretched land,  
Where fear and pain go upon either hand,  
As toward the end men fare without an aim  
Unto the dull grey dark from whence they came:  
Let them alone, the unshadowed sheer rocks stand  
Over the twilight graves of that poor band,  
Who count so little in the great world's game!

Nay, with the dead I deal not; this man lives,  
And that which carried him through good and ill,  
Stem against fate while his voice echoed still  
From rock to rock, now he lies silent, strives  
With wasting time, and through its long lapse gives  
Another friend to me, life's void to fill.

WILLIAM MORRIS.
