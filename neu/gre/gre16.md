# CHAP. XI.

ONUND and Asa had two sons; the elder was called Thorgeir, the younger
Ufeigh Grettir; but Asa soon died. Thereafter Onund got to wife a woman
called Thordis, the daughter of Thorgrim, from Gnup in Midfirth, and
akin to Midfirth Skeggi. Of her Onund had a son called Thorgrim; he was
early a big man, and a strong, wise, and good withal in matters of
husbandry. Onund dwelt on at Coldback till he was old, then he died in
his bed, and is buried in Treefoot's barrow; he was the briskest and
lithest of one-footed men who have ever lived in Iceland.

Now Thorgrim took the lead among the sons of Onund, though others of
them were older than he; but when he was twenty-five years old he grew
grey-haired, and therefore

was he bynamed Greypate; Thordis, his mother, was afterwards wedded
north in Willowdale, to Audun Skokul, and their son was Asgeir, of
Asgeir's-River. Thorgrim Greypate and his brothers had great possessions
in common, nor did they divide the goods between them. Now Erie, who
farmed at Arness, as is aforesaid, had to wife Alof, daughter of Ingolf,
of Ingolfs-firth; and Flosi was the name of their son, a hopeful man,
and of many friends. In those days three brothers came out hither,
Ingolf, Ufeigh, and Eyvind, and settled those three firths that are
known by their names, and there dwelt afterwards. Olaf was the name of
Eyvind's son, he first dwelt at Eyvind's-firth, and after at Drangar,
and was a man to hold his own well.

Now there was no strife betwixt these men while their elders were alive;
but when Eric died, it seemed to Flosi, that those of Coldback had no
lawful title to the lands which Erie had given to Onund; and from this
befell much ill-blood betwixt them; but Thorgrim and his kin still held
their lands as before, but they might not risk having sports together.
Now Thorgeir was head-man of the household of those brothers in
Reekfirth, and would ever be rowing out a-fishing, because in those days
were the firths full of fish; so those in the Creek made up their plot;
a man there was, a house-carle of Flosi in Arness, called Thorfin, him
Flosi sent for Thorgeir's head, and he went and hid himself in the
boat-stand; that morning, Thorgeir got ready to row out to sea, and two
men with him, one called Hamund, the other Brand. Thorgeir went first,
and had on his back a leather bottle and drink therein. It was very
dark, and as he walked down from the boat-stand Thorfin ran at him, and
smote him with an axe betwixt the shoulders, and the axe sank in, and
the bottle squeaked, but he let go the axe, for he deemed that there
would be little need of binding

up, and would save himself as swiftly as might be; and it is to be told
of him that he ran off to Arness, and came there before broad day, and
told of Thorgeir's slaying, and said that he should have need of Flosi's
shelter, and that the only thing to be done was to offer atonement, "for
that of all things," said he, "is like to better our strait, great as it
has now grown."

Flosi said that he would first hear tidings; "and I am minded to think
that thou art afraid after thy big deed."

Now it is to be said of Thorgeir, that he turned from the blow as the
axe smote the bottle, nor had he any wound; they made no search for the
man because of the dark, so they rowed past the firths to Coldback, and
told tidings of what had happed; thereat folk made much mocking, and
called Thorgeir, Bottleback, and that was his by-name ever after.

And this was sung withal--

The brave men of days of old,  
Whereof many a tale is told,  
Bathed the whiting of the shield,  
In wounds' house on battle-field  
But the honour-missing fool,  
Both sides of his slaying tool,  
Since faint heart his hand made vain,  
With but curdled milk must stain."
