# CHAP. LVII.

How Thorir of Garth set on Grettir on Ernewaterheath.

AT the Althing Thorir of Garth heard of the slaying of Thorir Redbeard,
and now he thought he saw that he had no light task to deal with; but
such rede he took that he rode west over the lower heathlands from the
Thing with well-nigh eighty men, and was minded to go and take Grettir's
life: but when Grim Thorhallson knew thereof he sent Grettir word and
bade him beware of himself, so Grettir ever took heed to the goings of
men. But one day he saw many men riding who took the way to his abode;
so he ran into a rift in the rocks, nor would he flee because he had not
seen all the strength of those folk.

Then up came Thorir and all his men, and bade them smite Grettir's head
from his body, and said that the ill-doer's life would be had cheaply
now.

Grettir answered, "*Though the spoon has taken it up, yet the mouth has
had no sup*. From afar have ye come, and marks of the game shall some
have ere we part."

Then Thorir egged on his men busily to set on him; but the pass was
narrow, and he could defend it well from one side; yet hereat he
marvelled, that howsoever they went round to the back of him, yet no
hurt he got thereby; some fell of Thorir's company, and some were
wounded, but nothing might they do.

Then said Thorir, "Oft have I heard that Grettir is a man of marvel
before all others for prowess and good heart, but never knew I that he
was so wise a wizard as now I behold him; for half as many again fall at
his back as fall before him; lo, now we have to do with trolls and no
men."

So he bid them turn away and they did so. Grettir marvelled how that
might be, for withal he was utterly foredone.

Thorir and his men turn away and ride toward the north country, and men
deemed their journey to be of the shamefullest; eighteen men had they
left there and many were wounded withal.

Now Grettir went up into the pass, and found there one great of growth,
who sat leaning against the rock and was sore wounded. Grettir asked him
of his name, and he said he was hight Hallmund.

"And this I will tell thee to know me by, that thou didst deem me to
have a good hold of the reins that summer when we met on the Keel; now,
methinks, I have paid thee back therefor."

"Yea, in sooth," said Grettir, "I deem that thou hast shown great
manliness toward me; whenso I may, I will reward thee."

Hallmund said, "But now I will that thou come to my abode, for thou must
e'en think time drags heavily here on the heaths."

Grettir said he was fain thereof; and now they fare both together south
under Balljokul, and there had Hallmund a huge cave, and a daughter
great of growth and of high mind; there they did well to Grettir, and
the woman healed the wounds of both of them, and Grettir dwelt long
there that summer, and a lay he made on Hallmund, wherein is this--

"Wide and high doth Hallmund stride  
In the hollow mountain side."

And this stave also is therein--

"At Ernewater, one by one,  
Stole the swords forth in the sun, <span id="page_170">p. 170</span>  
Eager for the road of death  
Swept athwart by sharp spears' breath  
Many a dead Wellwharfer's lands  
That day gave to other hands.  
Hallmund, dweller in the cave,  
Grettir's life that day did save."

Men say that Grettir slew six men in that meeting, but Hallmund twelve.

Now as the summer wore Grettir yearned for the peopled country, to see
his friends and kin; Hallmund bade him visit him when he came to the
south country again, and Grettir promised him so to do; then he went
west to Burgfirth, and thence to the Broadfirth Dales, and sought
counsel of Thorstein Kuggson as to where he should now seek for
protection, but Thorstein said that his foes were now so many that few
would harbour him; "But thou mightest fare south to the Marshes and see
what fate abides thee there."

So in the autumn Grettir went south to the Marshes.
