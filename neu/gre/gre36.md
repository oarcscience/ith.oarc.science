# CHAP. XXXI.

How Grettir met Bardi, the Son of Gudmund, as he came back from the
Heath-slayings.

BARDI, the son of Gudmund, and his brothers, rode home to Asbiornsness
after their parting with Grettir.

They were the sons of Gudmund, the son of Sœmund. The mother of Sœmund
was Thorlaug, the daughter of Sœmund, the South-Island man, the
foster-brother of Ingimund the Old, and Bardi was a very noble man.

Now soon he rode to find Thorarin the Wise, his foster-father. He
welcomed Bardi well, and asked what gain he had got of followers and
aid, for they had before taken counsel over Bardi's journey. Bardi
answered that he had got the aid of that man to his fellow, whose aid he
deemed better than that of any other twain. Thorarin got silent thereat,
and then said,

"That man will be Grettir Asmundson."

"*Sooth is the sage's guess*," said Bardi; "that is the very man,
foster-father."

Thorarin answered, "True it is, that Grettir is much before any other
man of those who are to choose in our land, and late will he be won with
weapons, if he be hale, yet it misdoubts me how far he will bring thee
luck; but of thy following all must not be luckless, and enough ye will
do, though he fare not with thee: nowise shall he go if I may have my
will."

"This I could not have deemed, foster-father," said he, "that thou
wouldst grudge me the aid of the bravest of men, if my need should be
hard. A man cannot foresee all things when he is driven on as methinks I
am."

"Thou wilt do well," said Thorarin; "though thou abidest by my
foresight."

Now thus must things be, even as Thorarin would, that no word more was
sent to Grettir, but Bardi fared south to Burgfirth, and then befell the
Heath-slayings.

Grettir was at Biarg when he heard that Bardi had ridden south; he
started up in anger for that no word had been sent to him, and said that
not thus should they part. He had news of them when they were looked for
coming from the south, and thereat he rode down to Thorey's-peak, for
the waylaying of Bardi's folk as they came back from the south: he fared
from the homestead up on to the hillside, and abode there. That same day
rode Bardi and his men north over Twodaysway, from the Heath-slayings;
they were six in all, and every man sore wounded; and when they came
forth by the homestead, then said Bardi--

"A man there is up on the hill-side; a big man, armed. What man do ye
take him to be?"

They said that they wotted not who he was.

Bardi said, "Methinks there," quoth he, "is Grettir Asmundson; and if so
it is, there will he meet us. I deem that it has misliked him that be
fared not with us, but methinks

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

we are not in good case, if he be bent on doing us harm. I now shall
send after men to Thoreys-peak, and stake nought on the chance of his
ill-will."

They said this was a good rede, and so was it done.

Thereafter Bardi and his folk rode on their way. Grettir saw where they
fared, and went in the way before them, and when they met, either
greeted other.

Grettir asked for tidings, but Bardi told them fearlessly, even as they
were. Grettir asked what men were in that journey with him. Bardi said
that there were his brothers, and Eyulf his brother-in-law.

"Thou hast now cleared thyself from all blame," said Grettir; "but now
is it best that we try between us who is of most might here."

Said Bardi, "Too nigh to my garth have deeds of hard need been, than
that I should fight with thee without a cause, and well methinks have I
thrust these from me."

"Thou growest soft, methinks, Bardi," said Grettir, "since thou durst
not fight with me."

"Call that what thou wilt," said Bardi; "but in some other stead would I
that thou wreak thine high-handedness than here on me; and that is like
enough, for now does thy rashness pass all bounds."

Grettir thought ill of his spaedom, and now doubted within himself
whether he should set on one or other of them; but it seemed rash to
him, as they were six and he one: and in that nick of time came up the
men from Thoreys-peak to the aid of Bardi and his folk; then Grettir
drew off from them, and turned aside to his horse. But Bardi and his
fellows went on their way, nor were there farewells between them at
parting.

No further dealings between Bardi and Grettir are told of after these
things betid.

Now so has Grettir said that he deemed himself well matched to fight
with most men, though they were three together, but he would have no
mind to flee before four, without trying it; but against more would he
fight only if he must needs defend his hand, as is said in this stave--

"My life trust I 'gainst three  
Skilled in Mist's mystery;  
Whatso in Hilda's weather  
Shall bring the swords together;  
If over four they are  
My wayfaring that bar  
No gale of swords will I  
Wake with them willingly."

After his parting with Bardi, Grettir fared to Biarg, and very ill he it
thought that he might nowhere try his strength, and searched all about
if anywhere might be somewhat wherewith he might contend.
