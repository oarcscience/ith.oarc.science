# CHAP. LXI.

How Grettir left Fairwoodfell, and of his abiding in Thorir's-dale.

BUT Grettir and his men took horse and rode up to the fell, for they
were all wounded, and when they came to Fairwood there was Eyolf left;
the farmer's daughter was out of doors, and asked for tidings; Grettir
told all as clearly as might be, and sang a stave withal--

"O thou warder of horn's wave,  
Not on this side of the grave  
Will Steinulf s head be whole again;  
Many more there gat their bane;  
Little hope of Thorgils now  
After that bone-breaking blow;}  
Eight Gold-scatterers more they say,  
Dead along the river lay."

Thereafter Grettir went to his lair and sat there through the winter;
but when he and Biorn met, Biorn said to him, that he deemed that much
had been done; "and no peace thou wilt have here in the long run: now
hast thou slain both kin and friends of mine, yet shall I not cast aside
what I have promised thee whiles thou art here."

Grettir said he must needs defend his hands and life, but ill it is if
thou mislikest it."

Biorn said that things must needs be as they were.

A little after came men to Biorn who had lost kinsmen at Grettir's
hands, and bade him not to suffer that riotous man to abide there longer
in their despite; and Biorn said

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

that it should be as they would as soon as the winter was over.

Now Thrand, the son of Thorarin of Acres, was healed; a stout man be
was, and had to wife Steinun, daughter of Rut of Combeness; Thorleif of
Lavadale, the father of Steinulf, was a very mighty man, and from him
are come the men of Lavadale.

Now nought more is told of the dealings of Grettir with the Marsh-men
while he was on the mountain; Biorn still kept up his friendship with
him, though his friends grew somewhat the fewer for that he let Grettir
abide there, because men took it ill that their kin should fall
unatoned.

At the time of the Thing, Grettir departed from the Marsh-country, and
went to Burg-firth and found Grim Thorhallson, and sought counsel of
him, as to what to do now. Grim said he had no strength to keep him,
therefore fared Grettir to find Hallmund his friend, and dwelt there
that summer till it wore to its latter end.

In the autumn Grettir went to Goatland, and waited there till bright
weather came on; then he went up to Goatland Jokul, and made for the
south-cast, and had with him a kettle, and tools to strike fire withal.
But men deem that he went there by the counsel of Hallmund, for far and
wide was the land known of him.

So Grettir went on till he found a dale in the Jokul, long and somewhat
narrow, locked up by Jokuls all about, in such wise that they overhung
the dale. He came down somehow, and then he saw fair hill-sides
grass-grown and set with bushes. Hot springs there were therein, and it
seemed to him that it was by reason of earth-fires that the ice-cliffs
did not close up over the vale.

A little river ran along down the dale, with level shores on either side
thereof. There the sun came but seldom,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

but he deemed he might scarcely tell over the sheep that were in that
valley, so many they were; and far better and fatter than any he had
ever seen.

Now Grettir abode there, and made himself a hut of such wood as he could
come by. He took of the sheep for his meat, and there was more on one of
them than on two elsewhere: one ewe there was, brown with a polled head,
with her lamb, that he deemed the greatest beauty for her goodly growth.
He was fain to take the lamb, and so he did, and thereafter slaughtered
it: three stone of suet there was in it, but the whole carcase was even
better. But when Brownhead missed her lamb, she went up on Grettir's hut
every night, and bleated in suchwise that he might not sleep anight, so
that it misliked him above all things that he had slaughtered the lamb,
because of her troubling.

But every evening at twilight he heard some one hoot up in the valley,
and then all the sheep ran together to one fold every evening.

So Grettir says, that a half-troll ruled over the valley, a giant hight
Thorir, and in trust of his keeping did Grettir abide there; by him did
Grettir name the valley, calling it Thorir's-dale. He said withal that
Thorir had daughters, with whom he himself had good game, and that they
took it well, for not many were the newcomers thereto; but when fasting
time was, Grettir made this change therein, that fat and livers should
be eaten in Lent.

Now nought happed to be told of through the winter. At last Grettir
found it so dreary there, that he might abide there no longer: then he
gat him gone from the valley, and went south across the jokul, and came
from the north, right against the midst of Shieldbroadfell.

He raised up a flat stone and bored a hole therein, and said that whoso
put his eye to the hole in that stone should

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

straightway behold the gulf of the pass that leads from Thorir's-vale.

So he fared south through the land, and thence to the Eastfirths; and in
this journey he was that summer long, and the winter, and met all the
great men there, but somewhat ever thrust him aside that nowhere got he
harbouring or abode; then he went back by the north, and dwelt at sundry
places.
