# CHAP. XXII.

Of the Slaying of Biorn.

IN the spring Grettir went north to Vogar with chapmen. He and Thorkel
parted in friendship; but Biorn went west to England, and was the master
of Thorkel's ship that went thither. Biorn dwelt thereabout that summer
and bought such things for Thorkel as he had given him word to get; but
as the autumn wore on he sailed from the west. Grettir was at Vogar till
the fleet broke up; then he sailed from the north with some chapmen
until they came to a harbour at an island before the mouth of
Drontheim-firth, called Gartar, where they pitched their tents. Now when
they were housed, a ship came sailing havenward from the south along the
land; they soon saw that it was an England farer; she took the strand
further out, and her crew went

ashore; Grettir and his fellows went to meet them. But when they met,
Grettir saw that Biorn was among those men, and spake--

"It is well that we have met here; now we may well take up our ancient
quarrel, and now I will try which of us twain may do the most."

Biorn said that was an old tale to him, "but if there has been aught of
such things between us, I will boot for it, so that thou mayst think
thyself well holden thereof."

Then Grettir sang--

"In hard strife I slew the bear,  
Thereof many a man doth hear;  
Then the cloak I oft had worn,  
By the beast to rags was torn  
Thou, O braggart ring-bearer,  
Wrought that jest upon me there,  
Now thou payest for thy jest,  
Not in words am I the best."

Biorn said, that oft had greater matters than these been atoned for.

Grettir said, "That few had chosen hitherto to strive to trip him up
with spite and envy, nor ever had he taken fee for such, and still must
matters fare in likewise. Know thou that we shall not both of us go
hence whole men if I may have my will, and a coward's name will I lay on
thy back, if thou darest not to fight."

Now Biorn saw that it would avail nought to try to talk himself free; so
he took his weapons and went a-land.

Then they ran one at the other and fought, but not long before Biorn got
sore wounded, and presently fell dead to earth. But when Biorn's fellows
saw that, they went to

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

their ship, and made off north along the land to meet Thorkel and told
him of this hap: he said it had not come to pass ere it might have been
looked for.

Soon after this Thorkel went south to Drontheim, and met there Earl
Svein. Grettir went south to Mere after the slaying of Biorn, and found
his friend Thorfinn, and told him what had befallen. Thorfinn gave him
good welcome, and said--

"It is well now that thou art in need of a friend, with me shalt thou
abide until these matters have come to an end."

Grettir thanked him for his offer, and said he would take it now.

Earl Svein was dwelling in Drontheim, at Steinker, when he heard of
Biorn's slaying; at that time there was with him Hiarandi, the brother
of Biorn, and he was the Earl's man; he was exceeding wroth when he
heard of the slaying of Biorn, and begged the Earl's aid in the matter,
and the Earl gave his word thereto.

Then he sent men to Thorfinn and summoned to him both him and Grettir.
Thorfinn and Grettir made ready at once at the Earl's bidding to go
north to Drontheim to meet him. Now the Earl held a council on the
matter, and bade Hiarandi to be thereat; Hiarandi said he would not
bring his brother to purse; "and I shall either fare in a like wise with
him, or else wreak vengeance for him." Now when the matter was looked
into, the Earl found that Biorn had been guilty towards Grettir in many
ways; and Thorfinn offered weregild, such as the Earl deemed might be
befitting for Biorn's kin to take; and thereon he had much to say on the
freedom which Grettir had wrought for men north there in the land, when
he slew the bearserks, as has been afore said.

The Earl answered, "With much truth thou sayest this, Thorfinn, that was
the greatest land-ridding, and good it seems to us to take weregild
because of thy words; and withal Grettir is a man well renowned because
of his strength and prowess."

Hiarandi would not take the settlement, and they broke up the meeting.
Thorfinn got his kinsman Arnbiorn to go about with Grettir day by day,
for he knew that Hiarandi lay in wait for his life.
