# CHAP. XLVI.

Grettir outlawed at the Thing at the Suit of Thorir of Garth.

THIS summer, whereof the tale was telling e'en now, a ship came out to
Goose-ere before the Thing. Then

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

was the news told of Grettir's travels, and therewithal men spake of
that house-burning; and at that story was Thorir of Garth mad wroth, and
deemed that there whereas Grettir was he had to look for vengeance for
his sons. He rode with many men and set forth at the Thing the case for
the burning, but men deemed they knew nought to say therein, while there
was none to answer.

Thorir said that he would have nought, but that Grettir should be made
an outlaw throughout the land for such misdeeds.

Then answered Skapti the Lawman, "Surely an ill deed it is, if things
are as is said; but a tale is half told if one man tells it, for most
folk are readiest to bring their stories to the worser side when there
are two ways of telling them; now, therefore, I shall not give my word
that Grettir be made guilty for this that has been done."

Now Thorir was a man of might in his district and a great chief, and
well befriended of many great men; and he pushed on matters so hard that
nought could avail to acquit Grettir; and so this Thorir made Grettir an
outlaw throughout all the land, and was ever thenceforth the heaviest of
all his foes, as things would oft show.

Now he put a price on his head, as was wont to be done with other
wood-folk, and thereafter rode home.

Many men got saying that this was done rather by the high hand than
according to law; but so it stood as it was done; and now nought else
happed to tell of till past midsummer.
