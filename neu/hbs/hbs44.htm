<H2 ALIGN="center">MUYO AND ALIYA</H2>

M<SMALL>UYO</SMALL> and &Aacute;liya were brothers, and nobly did they live;<BR>

Their very steeds and armor to each other would they give.<BR>

They came unto a turbid lake, and a duck went swimming by,<BR>

With golden wings; and Muyo let his gray falcon fly,<BR>

And &Aacute;liya a tame lanneret. Them happed the duck to slay.<BR>

Said Muyo: &#8220;The falcon took it.&#8221; But &Aacute;liya said, &#8220;Nay,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8217;Twas the lanneret.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Then was Muyo sore cast down in that place.</TD></TR></TABLE>

They seated them &#8217;neath a green fir to drink the wine apace,<BR>

And sleep and the wine o&#8217;ercame them. They were seen of three vilas<A NAME="page_254_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_254_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> white;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Then said the oldest:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Here be now two noble heroes of fight.</TD></TR></TABLE>

I will give an hundred sequins to whomsoever of you<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Shall make the heroes quarrel.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Then forth the youngest flew</TD></TR></TABLE>

On her white wings, and settled on the ground by Muyo&#8217;s head;<BR>

And over face and forehead the bitter tears she shed.<BR>

Burned Muyo&#8217;s face; as he were mad, he leaped at his brother&#8217;s side.<BR>

When he looked, he saw the damsel; to his brother then he cried:<BR>

&#8220;Arise now, &Aacute;liya, my brother! Let us hasten home away.&#8221;<BR>

Up leaped the Turk: &#8220;Nay, brother, now may a plague thee slay!<BR>

Now hast thou got two damsels, but there is none for me.&#8221;<A NAME="page_255_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_255_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A><BR>

&#8195;Muyo was grieved; forth from his belt he wrenched the dagger free,<BR>

And there smote &Aacute;liya to the heart. He fell on the green grass;<BR>

But Muyo seized the milk-white steed, and threw behind the lass;<BR>

And unto his own homestead o&#8217;er the mountain did he ride.<BR>

Neighed the black steed of &Aacute;liya, and the wounded hero cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O Muyo, brother and kinsman! turn back upon the way;<BR>

Take the black steed, lest masterless on the mountain side it neigh&#8212;<BR>

But thy fame shall be forever, as though thou hadst blinded thine eyes.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Muyo turned back unto him, and took the steed likewise,<BR>

And threw the girl thereon. Across the mountains did they pass;<BR>

And when about the middle of the journey home he was,<BR>

He came upon a raven with the right wing gone from the side;<BR>

And unto the black raven he raised his voice and cried:<BR>

&#8220;Ho, raven! Without the black right wing, prithee how dost thou fare?&#8221;<BR>

And with a wail the raven gave answer to him there:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Without my wing is it with me as without a brother to be;<BR>

As without &Aacute;liya, Muyo, is it even now with thee.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said the Turk to himself: &#8220;Ah, Muyo, alas for thy might this day!<BR>

If even the birds reproach me, what will my brethren say?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said the vila to him: &#8220;Muyo, return on thy track again.<BR>

Perchance I might heal thy brother; I was once a healer of men.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Muyo turned back upon the track. When at the lake they were,<BR>

He looked behind at the black steed, but the maiden was not there.<BR>

By his friend he knelt, but the spirit had hasted to depart;<BR>

When he saw, he drew his dagger and thrust it through his heart.<BR>
