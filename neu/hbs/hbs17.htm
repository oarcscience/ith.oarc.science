<H2 ALIGN="center">THE MAID OF K&Oacute;SOVO</H2>

U<SMALL>P</SMALL> rose the Maid of K&oacute;sovo before the break of day,<BR>

On a Sunday morn, ere the bright sun had risen on his way.<BR>

Unto her milk-white elbows she drew the white sleeves up;<BR>

She bore three loaves in a basket, and in either hand a cup;<BR>

Two beakers very beautiful, of hammered gold and fine;<BR>

The one held silver water, and the other ruddy wine.<BR>

She came to level K&oacute;sovo in pity and in ruth,<BR>

And weeping walked along the place of the battle of the youth,<BR>

The places of the slaughter, where the good Tsar Lazar stood;<BR>

And with her hands she lifted up the heroes in their blood.<BR>

The gallant lads she found alive, she washed with water fine.<BR>

She gave them of the milk-white loaves, and cheered them with ruddy wine.<BR>

To Pavle &Oacute;rlovich she came, the ensign of his lord:<BR>

As yet he was alive, although sore smitten by the sword;<BR>

But by a shred of flesh his arm at the red shoulder hung,<BR>

And the wound showed his shattered rib and the white ghastly lung.<BR>

She moved him from the pool of blood, she washed him with water fine;<BR>

She gave him of the milk-white loaves and of the ruddy wine.<BR>

Gasping for breath he leaned to her, and tremblingly he said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My sister, wherefore turnest thou the bodies of the dead?<BR>

What hard doom is upon thee, thou Maid of K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

That thou liftest up the heroes whose crests are fallen low?<BR>

Seekest thou then for some young man, whose last good day is done?<BR>

For thy father, or thy brother, or thy dear brother&#8217;s son?&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Answered the Maid of K&oacute;sovo:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;O champion unknown!</TD></TR></TABLE>

I seek not father, nor nephew, nor a brother of mine own.<BR>

Knowest thou, O my brother, how the good Tsar Lazar went<BR>

With the squadrons of the army to take the sacrament?<BR>

By the fair church in Samodrezha the thirty mass-priests stood<BR>

For three weeks, with the offering of Christ his flesh and blood.<BR>

Thereby there came three captains, that to communion passed,<BR>

Milosh and Ivan K&oacute;sanchich, and Milan T&oacute;plitsa last.<BR>

Milosh, the hero of the earth, through the gate before me strode;<BR>

The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<BR>

His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<BR>

His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<BR>

And forth and round about him his eyes went wanderingly,<BR>

Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<BR>

He doffed the spotted mantle; aloud to me did he cry:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Take now the spotted mantle, to remember me thereby.<BR>

Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<BR>

Pray for me, now, belov&egrave;d, that I ride back from the war,<BR>

Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<BR>

Pray now for me, belov&egrave;d, that the good hap may come.<BR>

To Milan, my brother sworn to me by God and by St. John,<BR>

I will give thee to plight thy troth, when the good morn comes on;<BR>

To my brother, my sworn comrade, of the living and the dead,<BR>

<P>

For I shall be his groomsman whene&#8217;er he shall be wed.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;After him Ivan, the hero of the earth, before me strode;<BR>

The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<BR>

His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<BR>

His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<BR>

On his hand he wore a golden ring, and his eyes went wanderingly,<BR>

Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<BR>

He took the ring from his finger; aloud to me did he cry:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Take, maiden, now the golden ring, to remember me thereby.<BR>

Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<BR>

Pray for me now, belov&egrave;d, that I ride back from the war,<BR>

Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<BR>

Pray now for me, belov&egrave;d, that the good hap may come.<BR>

To Milan, my brother sworn to me by God and by St. John,<BR>

I will give thee in marriage, when the good morn comes on.<BR>

It is my right in all men&#8217;s sight before the priest to stand,<BR>

<P>

And like a brother give thee for a bride into his hand.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;After him Milan, the hero of the earth, before me strode;<BR>

The clanking saber at his side rattled along the road;<BR>

His silver plume flashed on his cap, of silk was his raiment fair;<BR>

His scarf and his spotted mantle, likewise of silk they were.<BR>

On his shoulders was a golden cloak, and his eyes went wanderingly,<BR>

Glancing in pride from side to side, until they fell on me.<BR>

He took the cloak from his shoulders, and aloud to me did he cry:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Take, maiden, now the golden cloak, to remember me thereby.<BR>

Lo, I go to perish, dearest, in the leaguer of the tsar!<BR>

Pray for me now, belov&egrave;d, that I ride back from the war,<BR>

Returning from the battle with a great victory home.<BR>

Pray now for me, belov&egrave;d, that the good hap may come&#8212;<BR>

A fair and lovely fortune in the season when I shall ride<BR>

Hither again from the slaughter and the battle to my bride.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;They went out of the city and the altars where they kneeled,<BR>

And through the broken battle I seek them o&#8217;er the field.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Quoth Pavle to the maiden:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Sister, incline thine ear!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Seest thou yonder, sister, the splendor of that spear.<BR>

To the stirrups of the stallion, the brave blood flowed thereby,<BR>

And the horses of the heroes were drench&egrave;d bridle-high;<BR>

Stained was the shining armor, their girdles and their greaves.<BR>

They are dead, sister. In their blood dip not thy milk-white sleeves,<BR>

But get thee from the battle to thy home of the white hall.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And the maid heard, and with a cry upon her love did call.<BR>

She came unto her white-walled home, weeping and wild and pale,<BR>

And there she mourned her loss alone, with moaning and with wail:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Ah miserable! If I reach forth to touch the good green pine,<BR>

So will the green bough wither in this sad hand of mine.&#8221;<BR>
