<H2 ALIGN="center">THE HEAD OF TSAR LAZAR</H2>

W<SMALL>HEN</SMALL> the Turks smote off Tsar Lazar&#8217;s head in K&oacute;sovo, the fair,<BR>

No Serb came forth to find it, but a young Turk found it there;<BR>

He was a Turk that a Servian slave to a Moslem master bore.<BR>

And the young soldier thereupon he spoke his friends before:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Brethren, most shameful would it be before God who is One,<BR>

That this lord&#8217;s head should the eagles tear, and the steeds trample thereon,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And the legions of the heroes.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>In the skirt of his spotted cloak</TD></TR></TABLE>

He bore Saint Lazar&#8217;s head where forth a spring of water broke.<BR>

Into the spring of water he lowered the holy head,<BR>

And there it lay in the cool spring till forty years were sped.<BR>

But the fair body at K&oacute;sovo, that was so white and wan,<BR>

The eagles did not tear it, nor the steeds trample thereon,<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Nor the legions of the heroes.&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>Now praise to the Lord God&#8217;s might!</TD></TR></TABLE>

There were young carters that went forth from the town of Skupi the white;<BR>

To Nissa and to Vidin had they set out to go<BR>

With Greeks and Bulgars; and they camped one night at K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

The carters ate their dinner, and thirsty they became;<BR>

And the candle of their lantern they lighted at the flame;<BR>

Over K&oacute;sovo up and down a water-spring they sought,<BR>

And them their fortune at that hour to the spring of water brought.<BR>

One of them spake: &#8220;A shining moon behold in the water fair!&#8221;<BR>

And the second answered: &#8220;Brother, no shining moon is there.&#8221;<BR>

The third was silent and nothing said, but he turned his eyes abroad<BR>

To the east, and called on Saint Nicholas, and on the very God:<BR>

&#8220;O God and Father Nicholas, succor me now!&#8221; he said,<BR>

And he stepped into the spring therewith, and forth he drew the head<BR>

Of Lazar the Saint of Servia, and threw it on the grass;<BR>

Then he drank the water in a cup, for a thirsty man he was.<BR>

&#8195;Before the thirsty lads had drunk, they looked where the head had been<BR>

On the black earth, but no head at all on the green grass was seen.<BR>

Forth went the sacred head alone, on the way across the plain,<BR>

Till it came to the holy body and was one with it again.<BR>

And when was risen the morning that broke so free and fair,<BR>

To the priests their tidings the carters bore, and many priests came there.<BR>

There were full three hundred ancient priests and twelve great bishops more,<BR>

And likewise at that season there came the patriarchs four;<BR>

In Pech<A NAME="page_107_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> the one was ruler, and one of Ts&aacute;rigrad,<A NAME="page_107_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_107_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A><BR>

One in Jerusalem, and the last the earth for his province had.<BR>

And they put on the sacred robes with monks&#8217; hats for the head,<BR>

And with them took the holy book, and mighty prayers they said.<BR>

And three days that great vigil and three nights did they keep;<BR>

They sat not down, nor rested, nor laid them down to sleep,<BR>

But aye they prayed Saint Lazar, that he would grant them to know<BR>

What church he loved: Would he rest in Krush&eacute;dol or &Oacute;povo,<BR>

Besh&eacute;novo, or Yasak, or perchance he fain would lie<BR>

In Sh&iacute;shatovats or R&aacute;kovats, Kuv&eacute;zhdin, or Jifsha thereby,<BR>

Or haply in Macedonia? He will have no churching there;<BR>

He will go to the church that he founded, Rav&aacute;nitsa, the fair.<BR>

Under Kuchay he stablished it, the mountain sheer and dread;<BR>

He built it here among us with his treasure and his bread;<BR>

And because of it no wretched tears by the fatherless were shed.<BR>
