<H2 ALIGN="center">HOW MILOSH &Oacute;BILICH SLEW THE SULTAN MURAD</H2>

T<SMALL>SAR</SMALL> M<SMALL>URAD</SMALL> sat beneath his tent with the pashas of his power<BR>

And his viziers, and counsel took what way to smite the Giaour<BR>

And win with least disaster; when lo there came from afar<BR>

The vizier Osman running to claim reward of the tsar.<BR>

He kissed the hand and the garment, himself to the earth he bowed,<BR>

And thus to Murad, the Turkish tsar, the vizier spake aloud:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Murad, the Sun of all the East, holy Mahomet&#8217;s heir!<BR>

Rejoice! the Servian empire thou hast conquered everywhere!<BR>

Here come three Servian vo&#253;vodas that have chiefly made us fear;<BR>

They come hither to surrender, for down have they turned the spear.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;It pleased the Sultan Murad; it was pleasant in his ears;<BR>

Woes plagued him not. He spake unto the pashas and viziers:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Brave pashas, glorious viziers, my captains of command,<BR>

Shall I reach to the Wallachians my foot or my white hand?&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 82------------------------>

<A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;Said the viziers: &#8220;O glorious lord, put not thy hand to shame;<BR>

Shame were it to reach out to one of the Wallachian name!<BR>

Stretch out thy foot unto them, and let them kiss it sweet,<BR>

And let them be forever at all times &#8217;neath thy feet.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Outspake Vizier Usht&uacute;gliya: &#8220;Tsar Murad, our crown of gold,<BR>

shall we go out before them?&#8221; Then answered Murad the bold:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Go out to the field before them, and three great cloths unfold;<BR>

Stretch one of red, the second of white, the third green glorious.<BR>

When the slaves drive on their horses, if they come to fight with us,<BR>

All three of the cloths beneath their feet will they trample under here.<BR>

If they bring me the keys of the cities and the taxes for seven year,<BR>

On the red cloth will they trample, the red and the white beside,<BR>

But the green will they lift on their lances and thereunder will they ride.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the tsar&#8217;s troopers heard it, before the three they flew;<BR>

Before the Servian vo&#253;vodas the three great cloths they drew.<BR>

When the vo&#253;vodas drove on the steeds, they trampled the cloths all three;<BR>

<P>

And when Usht&uacute;gliya saw it, to Murad the tsar said he:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Lo, tsar, the servants of Lazar have trampled every cloth!<BR>

Under foot have they trampled them, for a sign that they are wroth,<BR>

And desire to-day their quarrel to undertake with thee,<BR>

Tsar Murad; they bring not bither of any city the key.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;The bold Tsar Murad answered:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Not so, my children brave!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Had they been eager to quarrel, long since had they drawn the glaive;<BR>

Drunk are the Giaours, and in drunkenness have trampled the cloth amain.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Meanwhile with his brethren was Milosh come, on his steed, the Crane.<BR>

Down he got from the charger, and out the tsar&#8217;s grooms flew<BR>

To hold the Crane for Milosh; no rein to them he threw,<BR>

He gave him to Ivan K&oacute;sanchich. To the tent of Murad the strong<BR>

Forthwith Milosh the vo&#253;voda went hastily along.<BR>

Murad stretched out his foot to him over the tapestries,<BR>

And spoke, for he deemed that Milosh desired his face to kiss:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Now fair and soft, now soft and fair, O Lazar&#8217;s follower;<BR>

<P>

</P>

Trample not on my garment&#8217;s edge, but kiss my boot and spur.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Milosh flashed like a living fire, like a wolf on Murad he sprang;<BR>

Over him like a hayduk the biting blade he swang;<BR>

From the midriff to the milk-white throat the tsar alive he rent.<BR>

Murad gaped wordless on the ground; and underneath the tent<BR>

Flashing like lightning hither and yon the blade of Milosh went.<BR>

He slaughtered all the tsar&#8217;s viziers, Usht&uacute;gliya he slew;<BR>

He smote the tsar&#8217;s twelve guardsmen and the tent ropes clove in two.<BR>

The bodyguard from Yedren, all of them had he slain;<BR>

Seventy heads had he smitten off ere he mounted his steed, the Crane.<BR>

&#8195;Then mounted the three sworn brethren and charged through K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

Dear God, their onslaught on the Turk was no cheap overthrow!<BR>

When blood began a-flowing, &#8217;twas good nearby to stand<BR>

And see how the Turkish heads split wide beneath the Servian brand.<BR>

Fierce slashed the Servian vo&#253;vodas, they slashed the Turks like grass:<BR>

Whither went Milan T&oacute;plitsa, was room for a wain to pass;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 85------------------------>

</P>

Whither went Ivan K&oacute;sanchich, lightly had two moved on;<BR>

Whither went Milosh &Oacute;bilich, abreast could three have gone.<BR>

The whole of the Turkish host boiled up, rushing to bar their track;<BR>

The vo&#253;vodas trampled the army like the earth hard and black.<BR>

Shame to the Turks not to have ta&#8217;en their vengeance for the tsar!<BR>

&#8217;Neath the standard of Mahomet the whole host came in war;<BR>

The pashas and fierce warriors, they flew into the fight<BR>

Upon their fa&euml;ry chargers, the heroes good to smite.<BR>

But Milosh and his comrades with the keen blade cut their way.<BR>

A saber cuts not a mountain down in the swift course of a day,<BR>

Nor the vo&#253;vodas all the army&#8212;and Milan T&oacute;plitsa cried:<BR>

&#8220;Avenge me, Milosh! At K&oacute;sovo have I failed to-day at thy side.&#8221;<BR>

But Milosh answered softly: &#8220;I forgive thee readily,<BR>

My brother Milan; quickly shall I lie there by thee.&#8221;<BR>

Furiously the Turks set on, till Ivan K&oacute;sanchich cried:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Farewell, Milosh! At K&oacute;sovo have I perished at thy side.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 86------------------------>

<A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A>

</P>

Avenge me, Milosh, who swarest my brother sworn to be!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But Milosh the good vo&#253;voda, O softly answered he!<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My brother, Ivan, for this gift I hope in perfect faith,<BR>

For never yet was gallant man but yearned for a gallant death.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And the fa&euml;ry steed he goaded, the battle-charger, the Crane;<BR>

He maddened on the maddened steed and smote the Turks again.<BR>

Like a dragon over K&oacute;sovo the vo&#253;voda did pass,<BR>

With the hot blood of the curs&egrave;d Turks he reddened all the grass.<BR>

Furious and shamefaced was the host, yet unavenged for the tsar<BR>

&#8217;Neath the standard of Mahomet the whole host came in war<BR>

On Milosh the weary hero. Of wounds he got no lack;<BR>

They beat him from his steed and bound his hands behind his back.<BR>

And unto the Tsar Murad, Milosh they led along:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Here is Milosh the vo&#253;voda for thee, Tsar Murad the strong!<BR>

Do thou tell us, Lord Glorious, in what wise we shall him slay.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Murad still lived; unto them in a soft voice did he say:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Be ye not angry with him, and do not strike him down<BR>

<P>

</P>

For that he slew me; fortune of battle brought it on<BR>

That a good hero slew me. Now draw up the host to war,<BR>

And smite the Giaour! Let not his power outlive the Servian tsar!&#8221;<BR>
