<H2 ALIGN="center">PRINCE MARKO&#8217;S PLOWING</H2>

W<SMALL>ITH</SMALL> his mother, Y&eacute;vrosima, his thirst did Marko slake<BR>

On the red wine. When they had drunk, to him his mother spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O thou, Prince Marko, prithee cease from the ravage and the raid;<BR>

Never on earth is evil with a good deed repaid.<BR>

Weary is thy mother of washing from thy shirts the crimson stain.<BR>

But do thou now yoke ox to plow, and plow the hill and the plain.<BR>

Sow thou the white wheat, little son, that thou and I may sup.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Marko harkened his mother, and he yoked the oxen up;<BR>

He plows not the hill, nor the valley; but he plows the tsar&#8217;s highway.<BR>

Some janissaries came thereby; three packs of gold had they:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Plow not the tsar his highway, Prince Marko,&#8221; said they then.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Ye Turks, mar not my plowing!&#8221; he answered them again.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Plow not the tsar his highway, Prince Marko,&#8221; they said anew.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Ye Turks, mar not my plowing!&#8221; he answered thereunto.<BR>

&#8195;But Marko was vext; in anger he lifted ox and plow,<BR>

And the Turkish janissaries he slew thero at a blow,<BR>

And their three packs of treasure to his mother he bore away:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Lo, mother, what my plowing hath won for thee to-day!&#8221;<BR>
