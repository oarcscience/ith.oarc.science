<H2 align=center>BAN STRAHIN</H2>

S<SMALL>TRAHIN</SMALL> was ban of Banska that by K&oacute;sovo doth stand;<BR>

And such another falcon there is not in the land.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>He rose up in the morning:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Ho, all my knaves, give heed!</TD></TR></TABLE>

Get ye down to the stables and saddle me my steed.<BR>

Deck him out fair and seemly, and gird him with the girth;<BR>

For hark and hear me, gallants, I go roving o&#8217;er the earth.<BR>

Weary shall be the milk-white steed, before I shall alight<BR>

Where dwell my wife&#8217;s good kindred in Kr&uacute;shevats the white&#8212;<BR>

Her brave old father Yug Bogdan and her good brothers nine,<BR>

Her gallant kin shall take me in and cheer me with the wine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Then forthwith all the servants unto the ban gave heed,<BR>

And from the lordly stable led the white falcon steed.<BR>

And then the brave Ban Strahin himself the steed arrayed;<BR>

He set on him a saddle of velvet and brocade,<BR>

Redder than sunset water, more shining than the sun!<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 33------------------------>

<A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A>

</P>

So the good ban put on the steed that rich caparison.<BR>

So rode he forth that morning, nor ever did alight<BR>

Till he came in to his wife&#8217;s kin in Kr&uacute;shevats the white,<BR>

Where late the realm men stablished. And him Yug Bogdan saw,<BR>

And with his nine gray hawks came on to greet his son-in-law.<BR>

They waited little for him, but clasped him one and all;<BR>

And while the servants took the steed, they brought the ban to hall.<BR>

Down sat they at the ready board, and spake fair words and fine;<BR>

And man and maid came in apace to serve or pour the wine.<BR>

Then all those goodly Christians their thirst began to quench;<BR>

Yug Bogdan set Ban Strahin beside him on the bench;<BR>

Upon his right he set him, his sons on the other hand;<BR>

But the remnant of his people at the table-foot must stand.<BR>

The servants served before them. Nine daughters had that lord,<BR>

And each fair daughter in her turn served deftly at the board.<BR>

They served before their father; they served their lords that tide;<BR>

<P>

But most of all Ban Strahin, for their sister was his bride.<BR>

One servant stood before them to serve the red wine up;<BR>

In a gold cup he measured it&#8212;nine measures held that cup.<BR>

Much courtesy was there to see and guests from near and far;<BR>

Brothers as many came as to a banquet of the tsar.<BR>

Long was Ban Strahin&#8217;s tarrying; long, long did he abide,<BR>

Dwelling among his wife her kin in pleasure and in pride.<BR>

&#8195;The guests that were in Kr&uacute;shevats a bitter cry they made,<BR>

And came to old Yug Bogdan and unto him they prayed:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;We kiss thy silken garments, thou art our lord and chief;<BR>

We therefore pray thy kindness to do us this relief.<BR>

Bring Strahin thy good son-in-law to our castles and our courts,<BR>

That we may do him honor as with his worth consorts.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Before that mirth was over was long enough, I trow.<BR>

Long the ban tarried, ere came forth the tidings of his woe.<BR>

But lo, in the fair morning, when the warm sun beat down,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 35------------------------>

A lad bore a white letter from Banska, the little town,&#8212;<BR>

Tidings from his old mother! He set it on his knee;<BR>

Therein was many a bitter and dreadful thing to see,<BR>

For there her curse is written most plain in Strahin&#8217;s sight:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Where art thou, son? Foul fall the wine in Kr&uacute;shevats the white!<BR>

Evil is the wine and full of shame for thee and thy wife&#8217;s kin.<BR>

Behold what woes against thee are written down herein!<BR>

From Yedren<A NAME="page_35_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_35_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> with an army is come the Turkish tsar<BR>

To K&oacute;sovo, and his viziers are with him in the war;<BR>

And he hath taken K&oacute;sovo with his accurst viziers.<BR>

The whole strength hath he brought along of all the Turkish spears;<BR>

Along the land of K&oacute;sovo hath he ta&#8217;en either flood&#8212;<BR>

Lab and S&iacute;tnitsa onward from the marble to the wood,<BR>

From the maple dry to S&aacute;zliya bridged over by the arch,<BR>

Through Zvechan and Chechan to the wood round K&oacute;sovo they march,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 36------------------------>

<A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A>

</P>

The valley of their capture; thereto they haste along.<BR>

And the tsar hath one army an hundred thousand strong,<BR>

That one lone lord hath lent him who hath a fief of the tsar.<BR>

Many lords eat of the tsars bread, and ride his steeds of war.<BR>

Few arms those chieftains carry; nay, but a single blade!<BR>

And yet another army is for the tsar arrayed&#8212;<BR>

The Turks and janissaries in Yedren&#8217;s milk-white tower;<BR>

And yet an hundred thousand they say are in that power.<BR>

Tuk and Manjuk an army for the tsar lead as well,<BR>

And death is in their onslaught and slaughter in their yell.<BR>

But yet there is one army of all from far and near&#8212;<BR>

Vlah &Aacute;liya&#8217;s, that feareth not for sultan nor vizier,<BR>

Nor all within the armies save as ants upon the hill.<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Such is the Turkish battle, nor departs he without ill.<BR>

He smote on little Banska; by the left-hand way he came;<BR>

He stormed the hold of Banska, and burned it with the flame.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 37------------------------>

<A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A>

</P>

He hath o&#8217;erturned the lowest stone; thy servants fled perforce;<BR>

And o&#8217;er thy mother&#8217;s body hath he ridden on his horse;<BR>

With thy wife upon his saddlebow through K&oacute;sovo he went,<BR>

And he kisses thy belov&egrave;d in the shadow of his tent.<BR>

And I above burned ruins bewail this fate of mine,<BR>

While thou drink&#8217;st wine in Kr&uacute;shevats. God send &#8217;tis Death his wine!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;When the ban read the letter, Grief took him in her grip;<BR>

Down drooped upon his shoulder the black beard of his lip;<BR>

He ground his teeth together, and was very nigh to weep;<BR>

And old Yug Bogdan saw him, as he rose up from his sleep.<BR>

Yug&#8217;s voice flashed up like fire; he spake after this wise:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;God help my son! and wherefore dost thou so soon arise?<BR>

And wherefore art thou troubled, good son-in-law of mine?<BR>

Have thy brave brothers laughed at thee or mocked thee at the wine?<BR>

Have not thy sisters served thee? Is there evil among thy kin?<BR>

Tell me, my son, and straightway: what shame is found herein?&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 38------------------------>

<A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;The ban flashed up before him and to his father said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Father, I find no fault at all in the kin of her I wed,<BR>

And my good brothers with me deal pleasantly withal;<BR>

The noble ladies speak me fair and serve me in the hall:<BR>

Among my wife&#8217;s good kindred no fault at all doth stand.<BR>

My mother out of Banska sends this letter to my hand.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;He tells unto his father in the fair morning-tide<BR>

How all of his possession is wasted far and wide;<BR>

How that the Turks have scattered his servants, knight and knave,<BR>

And trampled on his mother, and his wife ta&#8217;en for a slave:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;And O thou old Yug Bogdan, if she be dear to me,<BR>

Also she is thy daughter and shame to me and thee!<BR>

And if thou ever thoughtest a gift to me to give,<BR>

Give it not after I am dead, but now while yet I live.<BR>

I pray thee and I kiss thy hand: give me thy children nine,<BR>

And we will go to K&oacute;sovo to seek this foe of mine&#8212;<BR>

Yea, this red traitor to the tsar, that hath enslaved my wife.<BR>

Be not afraid, my father, nor sorrow for their life;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 39------------------------>

<A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A>

</P>

They shall wear Turkish raiment, turbans as white as milk<BR>

And good green mantles, and also broad trousers wrought of silk.<BR>

And at the belt long sabers as flashing as a flame.<BR>

And I will call my servants, and order them by name,<BR>

To saddle up the horses and draw the saddlebelts,<BR>

And cover o&#8217;er the horses with the strong black bear-pelts.<BR>

Strong janissaries shall they be; my counsel shall they know,<BR>

What time through the tsar&#8217;s army we ride in K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

And I will be their captain, who have their sister wed,<BR>

That they may heed my counsel, and have it still in dread.<BR>

And if a soldier of the tsar shall challenge us in speech,<BR>

Turkish, mayhap, or Arabic; why, I can speak in each,<BR>

And Manov too, and Arnaut, enough to serve that tide.<BR>

To seek my foe through K&oacute;sovo, so lightly will we ride&#8212;<BR>

This Turk Vlah &Aacute;liya that enslaved my love by might and main.<BR>

For though alone among the Turks I might perish or be ta&#8217;en,<BR>

My brethren and I, we shall not die nor be smitten down in vain!&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 40------------------------>

<A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;When old Yug Bogdan heard this, he flashed like living fire;<BR>

He spake unto Ban Strahin in words of wrath and ire:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;O thou, my son Ban Strahin, witless art thou and rash!<BR>

Wilt thou lead my sons to K&oacute;sovo for these same Turks to slash?<BR>

Say nothing more, my son-in-law! My sons shall not be slain,<BR>

Though thy fair wife, my daughter, come never home again.<BR>

Nay, nevermore, Ban Strahin, unloose thy wrath at me,<BR>

For wit thou well, my son-in-law&#8212;may the plague light on thee!&#8212;<BR>

If she have been his paramour but one night in the tent,<BR>

So may she be no longer the bride of thy content;<BR>

God hath slain her forever; accurs&egrave;d shall she be!<BR>

And a worse thing, Ban Strahin, him she prefers to thee.<BR>

Go to! The Devil take her! And for this love of thine<BR>

I will give thee a better, and with thee drink the wine.<BR>

I will be thy friend forever, but my children shall not go<BR>

Riding amain across the plain with thee to K&oacute;sovo!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But when Ban Strahin heard it, he flashed like living fire;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 41------------------------>

<A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A>

</P>

Answered the ban to the old man in agony and ire.<BR>

He will not call a servant; for a groom he takes not heed,<BR>

But goeth himself to the stable to saddle the white steed.<BR>

How royally he saddled him! how girded him thereto!<BR>

How over flashing ear and crest the bit and bridle drew!<BR>

Before the gateway of the court he led him forth alone,<BR>

And held him by the bridle near the white stepping-stone.<BR>

And he caught the steed by the shoulder and mounted with a bound,<BR>

And looked upon his brethren, but they looked upon the ground.<BR>

Upon his sister&#8217;s husband Ban Strahin turned his eyes,<BR>

But N&eacute;manyich looked downward at the black dust likewise.<BR>

They had drunken wine and brandy enough to make one nod,<BR>

And boasted that they were heroes, and sworn by the name of God:<BR>

&#8220;We love thee, thou Ban Strahin, more than the tsar&#8217;s whole land.&#8221;<BR>

But woe! the ban has never a man this day his friend to stand.<BR>

It is no easy labor to K&oacute;sovo to wend;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 42------------------------>

<A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A>

</P>

And the ban looked about him and saw he had no friend.<BR>

He rode down through white Kr&uacute;shevats, but aye he looked behind<BR>

To see if his brave brethren would alter in their mind,<BR>

And pity his affliction. No friend came to the ban.<BR>

And thereupon he minded him of the hound K&aacute;raman,<A NAME="page_42_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_42_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A><BR>

Whom he loves better than the steed, and holds of richer worth,<BR>

And loudly from the strong white throat the hound-call thunders forth.<BR>

The hound lay in the stable, but harkened and gave heed,<BR>

And swiftly in the field he ran, till he overtook the steed.<BR>

And gay beside the milk-white steed the hound rejoicing springs,<BR>

And on his neck the collar of corded goldwork rings.<BR>

A pleasant thing it was; the ban rode glad on the stallion&#8217;s back,<BR>

And took by weald and mount and field to K&oacute;sovo the track.<BR>

When he saw the host at K&oacute;sovo his heart was touched by fear,<BR>

But he remembered the true God, and to the Turks drew near.<BR>

Over the field of K&oacute;sovo on all four sides he went,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 43------------------------>

<A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A>

</P>

Seeking the strong Vlah &Aacute;liyah, but he could not find his tent.<BR>

&#8195;By the waters of the S&iacute;tnitsa a marvel there was seen,<BR>

By the shore of the S&iacute;tnitsa was pitched a tent of green.<BR>

The tent of green was very fair; it hid the grassy lawn,<BR>

The golden apple on the pole shone brighter than the dawn.<BR>

A spear is set before the door, and by the spear a steed,<BR>

With his head deep in the nose-bag upon the oats to feed.<BR>

The steed pawed fierce upon the ground with the off hoof and the near,<BR>

And the ban thought unto himself: &#8220;Vlah &Aacute;liya&#8217;s tent is here.&#8221;<BR>

And forward rode the hero upon the milk-white steed;<BR>

He took his spear from shoulder, all ready to his need.<BR>

He threw the tent door open, and looked within the tent;<BR>

But it was not Vlah &Aacute;liya, the strong and insolent;<BR>

But a dervish, to whose girdle the white beard sweeps from the chin,<BR>

Lies in the shadow of the tent, and no one else therein.<BR>

A luckless dervish is the Turk, but he drinks wine in a cup;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 44------------------------>

<A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A>

</P>

He pours the wine out for himself and forthwith drinks it up.<BR>

Ban Strahin looked on the dervish that was bloody to the eyes,<BR>

And made salam unto him, after the Turkish wise.<BR>

The drunken Turk looked on him, and spoke a word of woe:<BR>

&#8220;Hail to thee, brave Ban Strahin of Banska by K&oacute;sovo!&#8221;<BR>

Now flashed up the Ban Strahin, and answered him in dread;<BR>

In the fair-spoken Turkish a bitter word he said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Foul fall thy mother, thou dervish, that drinkest here this hour!<BR>

Thou art so drunk thou canst not tell a Moslem from a Giaour.<BR>

Wherefore dost thou speak of him? for here is found no ban;<BR>

There is none here but I, and I am the tsar&#8217;s true fighting man.<BR>

All of the tsar&#8217;s good horses are scattered near and far,<BR>

And the warriors run quickly to catch them for the tsar.<BR>

If I go with this thy insult to the tsar and the vizier,<BR>

Know well, thou sorry dervish, thy words shall cost thee dear.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;Laughed the dervish:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Thou a Turk, Strahin? Good fortune go with thee!</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>

<!------------------------page 45------------------------>

<A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A>

</P>

Were I upon Mount Golech, and should haply chance to see<BR>

Thee afar in the host of the tsar, well I should know thee, ban&#8212;<BR>

Thee and that milk-white steed of thine, and the hound K&aacute;raman,<BR>

Whom aye thou lovest better than the strong stallion white.<BR>

And know, thou ban of Banska, I read thy brow aright.<BR>

And I know the eyes thereunder and the black beard of thy lip.<BR>

Know, ban&#8212;and may good fortune be of thy fellowship!&#8212;<BR>

That when thy guardsmen took me and made of me a slave,<BR>

To thee in Suhara of the mount me miserable they gave.<BR>

To the bottom of that prison didst thou cast me at that tide,<BR>

And there a slave to thine and thee nine years did I abide.<BR>

Nine fearful years past over, yea! and the tenth began,<BR>

When filled with deep compassion thou thoughtest on me, ban.<BR>

Thou badest Rado, the jailer, unbar the doors withal,<BR>

And forthwith bring me upward a captive to the hall.<BR>

And dost thou know, Ban Strahin, what words thy fierce lips said:<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 46------------------------>

<A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;Slave! Turkish snake! Now would that thou within my hold wert dead!<BR>

Canst thou then, like a hero, redeem thee with a fee?&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;So ran thy question to me, and I told the truth to thee:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;&#8201;&#8216;My life now could I ransom, could I come to my hall,<BR>

To my father&#8217;s land and my birthplace and my fiefs one and all&#8212;<BR>

My many farms and freeholds, the price of liberty.<BR>

But thither to go, too well I know, hardly thou trustest me.<BR>

I will give thee a good bondsman, even God who does not feign,<BR>

And another bondsman, his good faith, that I bring that ransom again.&#8217;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Thou gavest thy trust to me that tide to go to my white hall,<BR>

To my father&#8217;s land and my birthplace, and my fiefs one and all.<BR>

I came to my sad birthplace; no more I knew good luck;<BR>

On my houses and my birthplace the pestilence had struck.<BR>

It smote the men and women; in my houses none had stayed,<BR>

And my whole house had perished and my whole possession strayed.<BR>

Fast-barred was all my sire&#8217;s estate, and bolted was the door.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 47------------------------>

<A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A>

</P>

The Turks took farm and freehold for their own forevermore.<BR>

And when I saw my houses all closed against me stand,<BR>

That I had neither friend nor goods, then a good plan I planned.<BR>

I rode post unto Yedren, to the vizier and the tsar,<BR>

And the vizier boasted me for a hero in the war.<BR>

The tsar&#8217;s vizier clothed me and gave a tent to me,<BR>

And the great raven charger and shining panoply.<BR>

For the tsar&#8217;s man forever in his book my name they set,<BR>

And thou hast come to me to-day to claim of me thy debt.<BR>

But, ban, I have not a penny; and woe is on thee this day,<BR>

That thou comest to die in folly amidst the tsar&#8217;s array.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The ban looked on the dervish. Forthwith the man he knew;<BR>

From the steed he vaulted, and clasped him, and to his bosom drew:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Brother in God, old dervish, no debt is due to me.<BR>

I seek no money, brother, nor any ransom fee.<BR>

I seek the strong Vlah &Aacute;liya, who hath overthrown my hall,<BR>

And hath taken my belov&egrave;d to be his bounden thrall.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 48------------------------>

<A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A>

</P>

Tell me of him, thou dervish, and do not me betray<BR>

Unto the Turkish army, who are yearning me to slay.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;By God,&#8221; then said the dervish, &#8220;thou ban, thou falcon-one,<BR>

The strength of this my faith to thee is firmer than the stone.<BR>

Shouldst thou with the sword&#8217;s edges smite half the army dead,<BR>

Yet would I not betray thee, nor trample on thy bread.<BR>

Though I ate of it in prison, thou gavest me store of wine;<BR>

Thou gavest the milk-white loaves to me that I might freely dine;<BR>

Oft in the sun&#8217;s light glorious I warmed me in the morn;<BR>

Thou didst set me free upon my word, wherein I am forsworn.<BR>

I could not keep my word to thee, returning to thy hall:<BR>

Faith it was hard for me to keep without the wherewithal!<BR>

And for the Turk, Ban Strahin, Vlah &Aacute;liya insolent&#8212;<BR>

On the high mount of Golech he pitches now his tent.<BR>

But, Strahin, go from K&oacute;sovo, or a fool&#8217;s death diest thou here;<BR>

Trust not thy hand, nor the sharp brand, nor the venom of the spear.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 49------------------------>

<A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A>

</P>

To pass that Turk in the mountain, it is a hero&#8217;s deed;<BR>

In his arms alive will he take thee, thy weapons and thy steed.<BR>

He will break thine arms asunder; he will blind thee living, O ban.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Laughed Strahin: &#8220;Dervish, pity me not because of any man,<BR>

But to the Turkish army betray me not this tide.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;And thereupon the dervish unto the ban replied:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My faith is firmer than the stone, and plighted thee indeed.<BR>

For even shouldst thou madden the anger of thy steed,<BR>

And riding on the army the half thereof shouldst slay,<BR>

Yet I will not at any time thee to the Turks betray.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The ban spoke and departed, but he turned on the stallion white:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dervish, thou waterest thy steed at daybreak and at night<BR>

In the waters of S&iacute;tnitsa. Say where the fords are found&#8212;<BR>

The fords in the cool water&#8212;that my horse may not be drowned.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Said the dervish: &#8220;Thou Servian falcon, a ford shalt thou find indeed,<BR>

Where&#8217;er thou enterest the water, for thy valor and thy steed.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The ban forded that water; on the milk-white steed he sped<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 50------------------------>

<A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A>

</P>

Over the mount of Golech with the great sun overhead.<BR>

It warms all things beneath it, both the near and the far,<BR>

And it shines down on K&oacute;sovo and the army of the tsar.<BR>

&#8195;And now behold Vlah &Aacute;liya, the strong and insolent,<BR>

Ban Strahin&#8217;s bride that kisses in the shadow of the tent.<BR>

He hath an evil custom, for ever does he fall<BR>

In slumber of a morning, when the sun beats over all.<BR>

He dreamed a dream upon that tide, and heavy lay his head<BR>

On the breast of the belov&egrave;d that Str&aacute;hinya had wed.<BR>

At the tent door she fondled him, but her eyes went to and fro<BR>

Over the Turkish army on the field of K&oacute;sovo.<BR>

She sees what manner are the tents, what steeds the heroes ride,<BR>

And by mischance towards Golech she turned her eyes aside.<BR>

She slapped the Turk on the right cheek; and, &#8220;Master,&#8221; did she cry,<BR>

&#8220;Rise up, Vlah &Aacute;liya! stir thyself! or forthwith mayst thou die!<BR>

Now belt thou on thy war-belt and thy fair mail likewise!<BR>

Ban Strahin comes that will cut off thine head, or blind thine eyes.&#8221;<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 51------------------------>

<A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A>

</P>

&#8195;Vlah &Aacute;liya wakened from his dream and flashed up like the fire;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>His eye was proud, he laughed aloud:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Thou Str&aacute;hinya&#8217;s desire,</TD></TR></TABLE>

Thou art afraid, Wallachian maid; thou fearest him eachwhere!<BR>

When I bear thee unto Yedren, yet wilt thou see him there!<BR>

&#8220;Yon captain is not Strahin; a tsar&#8217;s man rideth here:<BR>

Either the tsar hath sent him, or Mehmet, the vizier.<BR>

He bids that I submit me, nor smite the host of the tsar.<BR>

Tsar and vizier, mayhap they fear to feel my scimitar.<BR>

Fear not, what time I smite him with the keen, shining sword<BR>

That no more captains of the tsar come hither for their lord.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But the ban&#8217;s bride spake unto him:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My master, prithee see!</TD></TR></TABLE>

That is no Turkish captain&#8212;a blindness light on thee!&#8212;<BR>

Nay, but my master Strahin, that did my body clip.<BR>

Do I not know both eye and brow and the black beard of his lip?<BR>

Do I not know his milk-white horse with the spot of brown and tan,<BR>

<P>

And the tawny hound beside him, the good hound K&aacute;raman?<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Jest not with life, my gallant lord.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>But when Vlah &Aacute;liya heard,</TD></TR></TABLE>

The wrathful Turk leaped to his feet and straight began to gird:<BR>

His girdle with the poniards and the scimitar thereto.<BR>

And he giveth heed to the black steed, while the ban nearer drew.<BR>

The ban is very careful, but he cursed him, nor bowed his head<BR>

After the Turkish fashion; and unto him he said:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Art thou then there, thou dastard&#8212;thou traitor to the tsar?<BR>

Whose women hast thou taken that round thy camp-fires are?<BR>

And whose belov&egrave;d hast thou kist in the shadow of the tent?<BR>

Come out to battle against me, thou strong and insolent.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;The Turk was very angry. He sprang with might and main<BR>

Unto the shoulder of the horse, and caught the bridle-rein.<BR>

The ban bode not his coming, but straight against him drove;<BR>

He lifted the iron spear on high, and hurled it from above.<BR>

And the strong Turk, Vlah &Aacute;liya, reached out and caught the spear,<BR>

<P>

<TABLE><TR><TD>And he spake unto Strahin:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Dastard, what dost thou here?</TD></TR></TABLE>

Here are no maids of Sh&uacute;madin to scatter with a cry,<BR>

But who fears not vizier or tsar, Vlah &Aacute;liya am I!<BR>

And I dread not any hero in the army of the tsar;<BR>

To me as ants upon the grass all in that army are.<BR>

And thou thinkest in the lists this tide to battle with me here!&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;He spake and very suddenly he cast the battle-spear,<BR>

Eager to wound. But the good God aided Ban Strahin well.<BR>

His white steed, when the spear flew by, down on his knees he fell.<BR>

High overhead the great spear flashed, and broke on a stone in three.<BR>

Up to the boss that guards the hand was it broken utterly.<BR>

Now when the spears were broken, each champion drew his mace;<BR>

Vlah &Aacute;liya smote on Strahin and beat him from his place,<BR>

Forward from out of the saddle on the white neck of the steed.<BR>

Now the good God aided Strahin in the moment of his need.<BR>

Nor Turk, nor Serb a steed doth curb of half that worth to-day.<BR>

The beast swung head and shoulder in the middle of the fray,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 54------------------------>

</P>

And his lord out of that danger to the saddletree threw back;<BR>

And upon that Turkish devil the ban made his attack.<BR>

But the Turk out of the saddle would neither fall nor flee,<BR>

Though &#8217;neath the blows his horse had sunk in the black dust to the knee.<BR>

The spiky maces in their hands were shattered left and right,<BR>

And forth they drew the sabers, and anew they fought the fight.<BR>

But lo, the great Ban Strahin at his belt had such a blade<BR>

That a pair of smiths must forge it with three men there to aid!<BR>

From Sunday unto Sunday till the steel was waxen cold<BR>

Had those same craftsmen cooled it within the earthen mold;<BR>

And thereafter had they sharpened it by laying on the sledge.<BR>

Smote the Turk, but Strahin waited edge against saber-edge,<BR>

Till he smote hard against it, and the Turk&#8217;s blade broke in half.<BR>

This saw the ban and in he ran, and in his heart did laugh<BR>

As he prest in upon him, smiting on either hand,<BR>

To strike his head from his shoulders with the edges of the brand.<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 55------------------------>

<A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A>

</P>

Hero smote against hero; the Turk good ward he made,<BR>

He kept his head and shoulders with the truncheon of the blade.<BR>

With the remnant of his weapon he beat the saber back;<BR>

And bit by bit as he smote on it to pieces did he hack<BR>

The saber of Ban Strahin. Two blades in fragments lay.<BR>

&#8195;Then leaped they from the horses, and hurled the hilts away.<BR>

They gripped each other by the throat like dragons at that tide;<BR>

All day till noon they wrestled upon the mountain side;<BR>

Till on the Turk&#8217;s pale lips the foam like snow new-fallen stood,<BR>

And the white foam on Strahin&#8217;s lip was flecked with drops of blood;<BR>

The blood upon his garments and on his jack-boots ran.<BR>

But when the pain had gripped him, at last out spake the ban:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My love, God&#8217;s curse upon thee! What travail dost thou see?<BR>

Take up a splinter of the sword, and strike the Turk or me.<BR>

Think which of us, belov&egrave;d, is dearer unto thee.&#8221;<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>&#8195;But thereto the Turk spake fiercely:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;Belov&egrave;d of the ban,</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>

<!------------------------page 56------------------------>

<A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A>

</P>

Strike him, for thou shalt never more be dear unto the man;<BR>

But aye his sharp reproaches against thee shall be bent,<BR>

Because thou once wast with me in the shadow of the tent.<BR>

But I will love thee always, nor ever thee disdain.<BR>

In Yedren thirty serving-maids shall bear thy sleeves and train;<BR>

Sugar and honey ever more shall be set for thee to eat;<BR>

With ducats will I deck thee from thy head unto thy feet:<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>Strike now the ban.&#8221;&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>All womankind are lightly led astray.</TD></TR></TABLE>

She leaped and grasped a splinter of the sword-blade where it lay.<BR>

She wrapped it in a napkin, lest it should wound her hand,<BR>

And she sought to smite her wedded lord with the fragment of the brand,<BR>

And guard Vlah &Aacute;liya&#8217;s head. She cut the silver plume in twain;<BR>

She clove the milk-white turban that guarded him in vain;<BR>

The blood flowed down the hero&#8217;s face, and was like to blind his eyes,<BR>

And the ban dreaded sore that tide to die in foolish wise.<BR>

But suddenly within him the thoughts together ran,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 57------------------------>

<A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A>

And out of his white throat he called on the hound K&aacute;raman&#8212;<BR>

A hound trained to the hunting. He called the hound by name,<BR>

And with a bound the tawny hound to help his master came,<BR>

And bit the ban&#8217;s belov&egrave;d. A dog all women fear;<BR>

She threw the blade upon the ground, and cuffed the hound on the ear.<BR>

Screaming she fled across the mount; afar they heard her cry;<BR>

But the strong Turk looked after to see where she did fly.<BR>

And new strength burst upon the ban, and courage great and new,<BR>

And hither and yon he drove the Turk, and wrestling overthrew.<BR>

Howe&#8217;er so hard the Turk might guard, he struck from underneath,<BR>

And, leaping in under the chin, he fastened with his teeth,<BR>

As the wolf throttling a lamb. Then he leaped up from the ground,<BR>

And with a mighty voice he called after the tawny hound,<BR>

That the beast should cease pursuing the maid the ban had wed;<BR>

And swift along the mountain to the Turkish host she fled.<BR>

But the ban would not let her; he caught her by the hand;<BR>

<P>

He brought her back unto the place where the dappled steed did stand.<BR>

He took the horse by the shoulders; he threw her on behind;<BR>

Then rode he deviously along, the homeward way to find.<BR>

Away from the tsar&#8217;s army he turned the bridle-rein,<BR>

Till he came in to his wife&#8217;s kin at Kr&uacute;shevats on the plain,<BR>

And old Yug Bogdan and his sons rose, when they saw him come;<BR>

They took him to their bosoms, and gave him welcome home.<BR>

But when Yug Bogdan saw his plight his tears ran down amain:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Now fair be all thy fortune, that thou art home again.<BR>

Strong are the Turkish heroes, the soldiers of the tsar;<BR>

A fighting man to wound the ban they must have sought afar.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;But the nine brothers feared him, till the ban to them spake:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Dread nothing, my good brethren, nor be troubled for my sake.<BR>

With the tsar there was no hero to conquer me in fight.<BR>

Would ye then hear who wounded me, and whose hand did me smite?<BR>

When with the Turk I battled, O thou good father mine,<BR>

<P>

<!------------------------page 59------------------------>

<A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A>

</P>

Then my belov&egrave;d smote me&#8212;this dearest child of thine;<BR>

She set aside my love that tide, and to the Turk gave aid.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Yug flashed up like a living fire, and to his sons he said:<BR>

&#8220;Slash the she-wolf in pieces with the nine blades of the brands!&#8221;<BR>

The strong sons heard their father, and upon her set their hands.<BR>

But Strahin will not let them. He speaketh to them apace:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;My nine good brethren, wherefore do ye yourselves disgrace?<BR>

Why are your knives unscabbarded? Heroes ye are, I know!<BR>

But why were not your sabers with me at K&oacute;sovo,<BR>

To do great deeds against the Turk when danger ran most high?<BR>

And harken this, my brethren; your sister shall not die.<BR>

Without your aid already, all I wished, she had been slain.<BR>

Yet, should I slaughter all her kin, no comrade then would drain,<BR>

Reveling with me deliciously, the cool cups of the wine.<BR>

So now have I given my pardon unto this bride of mine.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;There are not many on earth to match him, man to man,<BR>

And scanty are the heroes as gallant as the ban.<BR>
