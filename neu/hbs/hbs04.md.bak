## INTRODUCTION

 The ballads of Servia occupy a high position, perhaps the highest
position, in the ballad literature of Europe. Of them Jacob Grimm wrote:
“They would, if well known, astonish Europe,” and “in them breathes a
clear and inborn poetry such as can scarcely be found among any other
modern people.”<span id="page_1_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_1_note_1.md) The
origin of this popular literature goes back to a period of which no
written record exists; its known history dates from the fourteenth
century, since which time it is absolutely continuous. And in Servia,
unlike England and Spain, ballads still survive as an important part of
the nation’s intellectual life; they are still sung, and still composed,
by peasant poets who have received their training from oral tradition
instead of from the printed page.

 According to their subjects the Servian ballads may be divided into two
very unequal divisions, the first, and by far the larger, being based on
the national history, while the second lacks any such historical
foundation. Yet the line between the two groups cannot be strictly
drawn; well-known folk-lore motives or mere popular jests are <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> continually attached to historical heroes. Such
ballads as *Prince Marko’s Plowing* and *Marko Drinks Wine in Ramazán*
called “historical” only in the most ultra-catholic interpretation of
the term.

 The historical ballads may again be divided into more or less definite
cycles. First in order of time come those dealing with the kings of the
Némanich dynasty (1168-1367). This royal line made less impression on
the popular mind by its heroic exploits than by its piety in founding
churches and monasteries (cf. p. 28). The surviving ballads of the
cycle, which are few in number, are represented in this volume by *Urosh
and the Sons of Marnyáva*<span
id="page_2_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_2_note_1.md) and *The Building of
Skadar*. After the death of the great tsar Stepan Dushan in 1356, his
son, the weak Urosh, came to the throne, but was unable to preserve his
authority intact. The leader of the revolting chieftains was King
Vukáshin, who defeated his lawful superior and caused him to be slain.
Of the rivalry of the two men the ballad *Urosh and the Sons of
Marnyáva* preserves a distant echo; to the historic brothers Vukáshin
and Úglyesha it adds a third, Goyko, unknown outside of folk-lore.
Another glimpse, still more legendary, of the three brothers is
preserved in *The Building of Skadar*.

 The cycle of the battle of Kósovo forms the classic center of the
Servian ballads. After the death of Vukáshin, being hard pressed by the
<span id="page_3">p. 3</span> Turks, the Servians in 1371 elected as
their tsar, Lazar, a leader who had served under Dushan and was
connected with him by marriage. His efforts to save the country were
vain; on June 15 (St. Vitus’ day), 1389, his armies were crushed by
those of Murad I. Both rulers fell on the battlefield, Murad being
killed by a Servian to whom one of the contemporary accounts gives the
title of “a faithful servant of Lazar, by name Milosh.” About 1431
Constantine the Philosopher, a Servian biographer, states that the
“great noble” who killed Murad was “slandered to his lord by envious
tongues as wishing to betray him.” An anonymous Italian writer (about
1500) tells how on the eve of battle Lazar reproached Milosh with
wishing to betray him, and how Milosh replied that the event would prove
his truth or treason; the same source states that on the battlefield
there was a report of the treachery of a voývoda<span
id="page_3_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_3_note_1.md) named Drágoslav Príbishich.
Finally Mauro Orbini in his *Regno de gli Slavi* (1601) for the first
time ascribes the betrayal of Lazar to his son-in-law Vuk Bránkovich,
whose fair fame is thus wrongfully besmirched. Orbini makes Milosh, like
Vuk, the son-in-law of Lazar, and tells of the origin of the enmity of
the two men in a quarrel between their wives Mara and Vúkosava; in other
words, he gives the Kósovo legend in practically its complete form, as
it is found in the ballads here printed.<span
id="page_3_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_3_note_2.md) It is, however, probably the
product of popular <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> tradition, not of
Orbini and his predecessors.

 Upon this Kósovo legend many episodes are grafted, such as those of Ban
Strahin, Musich Stevan, and the Maid of Kósovo. The ballads often
represent varying traditions; thus the accounts of Lazar’s church in
*The Battle of Kósovo* and *The Building of Ravánitsa* are not perfectly
consistent with each other. They depart widely from historical truth,
making Vukáshin, for example, who died in 1871, and Ertseg Stepan, who
belongs to a later period, both take part in the battle of Kósovo.<span
id="page_4_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_4_note_1.md)

 These Kósovo songs are emphatically not fragments of a primitive epic,
but ballads dealing with detached episodes. The attempts that have been
made to stitch them together into a connected whole result in damaging
splendid ballads without constructing an epic worthy of the name. They
furnish an argument of some weight against the Homeric theories of
Lachmann and his school.

 If the Kósovo cycle be the most elevated, dignified, epic portion of
the Servian popular poetry, the ballads of Marko Krályevich (Prince
Marko) are of more dramatic interest, combining tragic pathos with
almost ribald comedy in a fashion worthy of an Elizabethan playwright.
Unlike Strahin and Milosh, who, to borrow a phrase from Dryden, are
“patterns of exact virtue,” radiant as their garments, Marko is a burly
spoiled child, strong, self-willed, capricious, at times cruel, but
<span id="page_5">p. 5</span> always brave, always kind to the weak and
friendless, whether they be fair maidens or mere birds of prey, and,
above all, always a devoted son to his old mother Yévrosima. The
historic Marko, the son of King Vukáshin, was not of great importance.
After his father’s death he ruled over a portion of Macedonia, with
Prilip as his capital; in 1385 he submitted to Turkish sovereignty; and
in 1394 he perished, fighting for the Sultan Bajazet against the Voývoda
Mircha of Wallachia. But he must have endeared himself to the nation by
his personal qualities, for he became by far the best known and the best
beloved hero of the ballads. In one respect, at least, the ballads about
him are true to history. Although Marko is associated with Milosh as his
sworn brother, and although he visits the field of Kósovo after the
defeat of the Servians (see pp. 130-32), he is assigned no part in the
battle itself; as to the cause of his absence from the fray the ballads
are silent.

 From the great days of heroic conflict with the Turks to the dark ages
of oppression, the ballads of *The Maiden Márgita and Rayko the
Voývoda*, with its lament over fallen champions, forms a natural
transition. The time of Turkish rule lacked great exploits and great
personalities; its heroes were the hayduks, or robber outlaws, of whom
the most famous was Starína Novak, who with his band of followers,
including his sworn brother, the bold Rádivoye, lived in Bosnia late in
the sixteenth century. Though they use muskets instead of bows, these
worthies, as they appear <span id="page_6">p. 6</span> in the ballads,
are own cousins of Robin Hood and Little John.

 “After Herzegovina was subdued by the Turks (1482), many of the
inhabitants fled to Dalmatia and Klis \[near Salona\], and after the
fall of Klis (1537) they went to Zengg \[Senye in the ballads\] on the
Croatian seacoast, in order, as hired soldiers of the emperor, to defend
the country from Turkish marauding bands: these are the
*fugitives*.”<span id="page_6_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_6_note_1.md) A special
cycle of ballads glorifies these “fugitives,” of whom Ivo of Senye, who
lived about 1600, is the chief hero. With this cycle may be grouped the
ballads of the “seacoast heroes,” who, however, are not in the strict
sense “fugitives.” They are not from Zengg, but from Kotári, in northern
Dalmatia, and are of a later date, the middle and end of the seventeenth
century. Among them is Stoyan Yánkovich, who in 1689 contributed to the
fall of Údbina and the freeing of Lika and Kríbava from the Turks. The
ballads that deal with him have little connection with his actual
exploits.

 Of ballads more recent in subject-matter this volume contains but one
specimen, *The War of the Montenegrins with Mahmud Pasha* (1796), which
represents the cycle of the freeing of Montenegro. Unlike their
predecessors, the ballads of this group are better history than poetry.
“Short and simple, generally without poetic descriptions or long
conversations, almost entirely without the vila or raven motives, they
sing in a realistic fashion <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> the wars of
the Montenegrins with the Turks; they celebrate only real persons, and
when they mention even unimportant actors, always preserve the
topography of their doings accurately and consistently. In them women
play no part.”<span id="page_7_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_7_note_1.md)

 The ballads lacking historical foundation are of the most varied sort.
Thus *The Serpent Bridegroom* and *Sister and Brother* are versified
fairy tales, dealing with familiar folk-lore motives. *Predrag and
Nenad* is ostensibly a hayduk story, but its plot is not purely Servian;
it is known to English readers from Malory’s tale of *Balin and Balan*,
or Tennyson’s modern version of it. *St. Nicholas* is a naïve popular
legend, while *Muyo and Áliya* tells of the misdeeds of an unusually
wicked vila, or mountain nymph. On the other hand, *The Wife of Hasan
Aga* is a simple, powerful tragedy of domestic life.

 The Servian heroic ballads are now all composed in one measure, an
unrimed line of ten syllables, with a cæsura after the fourth syllable.
There is no regular arrangement of accents; but, as no Servian word
(except of course monosyllables) is accented on the ultima, the effect
of the verse, when read or recited, is of an irregular trochaic rhythm.

When the ballads are *sung*, the prose accents are set aside, and the
lines become regular trochaic pentameter.<span
id="page_7_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_7_note_2.md)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

 Previous English translations have imitated more or less closely this
Servian meter. To the translators of the present volume it seemed better
to cast aside entirely the native measure, as one essentially foreign to
the genius of the English language, and to adopt a verse modeled on that
which, in *Sigurd the Volsung*, William Morris has made classic by his
handling of a subject that is spiritually akin to the Kósovo ballads. At
this point it may be well to forestall a possible cavil. Metrists will
note that the translators, while in the main employing the measure of
six and a half feet or *thirteener*, have liberally interspersed the
seven-foot line or *fourteener*. Lovers of the glorious measure of
*Sigurd the Volsung* may perhaps resent this variation, but the citation
of a precedent from Macaulay should be sufficient to establish the
dignity of the practice:

 The Servian ballads are ordinarily recited or chanted to the
accompaniment of the *gusle*, a crude, one-stringed instrument, in
appearance somewhat like a mandolin, but played with a bow. The tones of
the gusle come in only at the close of the verses. On their distribution
Karájich wrote thus in 1823: “The heroic songs are now sung most often
and with most zest in Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, and the southern,
mountainous regions of <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> Servia. In these
places even to-day almost every house has its gusle, and it is hard to
find a man who does not know how to play it, and many women and girls
know how.”<span id="page_9_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_9_note_1.md) In the lower
regions the gusle grows less common, until it finally becomes the
peculiar possession of blind beggars, who sing the songs at fairs and
church festivals.

 The anonymous authorship of these songs may excite surprise among a
people of bookish training and habits like ourselves. It will be readily
understood that a singer knowing some fifty of the ballads by heart can
without great difficulty compose new songs on any passing event of
village life, even as a cultivated gentleman, well versed in even one of
Shakespeare’s plays, can find fitting quotations for an after-dinner
speech on any imaginable topic. Karájich gives an example of such a
jesting song composed upon a village wedding. Ballads of this type have
no value in themselves, and disappear from memory along with the
trifling event that occasioned them. But “just as waggish old men and
youths compose these jocose songs, so others compose serious ballads of
battles and other notable events. It is not strange that one cannot
learn who first composed even the most recent of the ballads, to say
nothing of the older ones; but it is strange that among the common
people nobody regards it as an art or a thing to be proud of to compose
a new ballad; and, not to speak of boasting of doing so, everyone, even
the real author, refuses to acknowledge the ballad, and <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> says that he has heard it from another. This
is true of the most recent ballads, of which it is known that they were
not brought from elsewhere, but arose on the spot from an event of a few
days ago; but when even a year has passed since the event and the
ballad, or when a ballad is heard of an event of yesterday, but of a
distant locality, no one even thinks of asking about its origin.”<span
id="page_10_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_10_note_1.md)

 

 A few words are due the memory of the great collector of the Servian
national songs, Vuk Stefánovich Karájich (1787-1864), from whose work
all but one of the ballads in the present volume have been
translated.<span id="page_10_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_10_note_2.md) Born of a
peasant family, under Turkish rule, Vuk early learned to read and write,
and while still a boy served as a scribe to Black George, the leader of
the Servian revolt. Owing to an illness he became a cripple and was
restricted to a bookish career. In 1813 he became acquainted in Vienna
with the Slavic scholar Kopitar, whose attention he attracted by an
article written in the living Servian language instead of the artificial
ecclesiastical dialect then current in Servian literature, and who
encouraged him to <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> undertake the
gathering of popular songs and ballads. In 1814-15 he published the
first fruits of his labors, a small collection in two volumes; a second,
enlarged edition appeared in four volumes, 1824-33; and a third edition,
with still further additions, followed in 1841-66, in six volumes, of
which the last two were printed posthumously. Finally the Servian
government has reissued the great work, with additions from Karájich’s
manuscripts, in nine volumes, 1891-1902, containing, besides two volumes
of folk-songs, nearly five hundred ballads.

 Karájich also published a collection of popular tales and one of
proverbs. But his activity as a folk-lorist was only one side of his
labors. In 1814 he published the first edition of his *Servian Grammar*,
and in 1818 he published the first edition of his *Servian Dictionary*,
with translations in German and Latin, which, in a revised form, is
still a standard work. He prepared a translation of the New Testament
into the living speech of the people. Finally, not to speak of his less
important writings, he revised on a phonetic basis the alphabet and
spelling of his native language, and his system, after years of
persecution, partly owing to his introduction of the letter *j* from the
hated “Catholic” Latin alphabet, has long since been adopted as the
Servian official orthography. Few writers of books have had so great an
influence, or an influence so purely beneficent, on the life of their
nation as had Vuk Stefánovich Karájich.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

 Some explanation is needed of the pronunciation of the Servian proper
names. No simple transliteration can correctly indicate the native
pronunciation; that here adopted seems open to as few objections as any
other. The vowels and diphthongs should be given their regular
“continental” values: roughly, *f*a*ther*, *caf*é, *mach*i*ne* *n*o*te*,
*r*u*le*, ay*e*, *b*ey, *b*oy. *I* never forms a diphthong with a
preceding vowel: *Vó-in*, *Vá-i-sti-na*. *Y* is always either a
consonant or the second element of a diphthong; a consonant followed by
*y* plus a vowel forms one syllable with them: *Né-ma-nya*. The
consonants and consonantal digraphs have their ordinary English sounds;
the following are apparently all in regard to which there could be
ambiguity. *G* is always “hard,” as in *gift*; *j* is pronounced as in
*jelly*, the *j* of the Servian alphabet being here rendered by *y*
(*Yug*); *s* is always surd, as in *soft*, *passing*; *z* and *ch* are
pronounced as in *zebra* and *church*, not with their German sounds;
*zh* represents the sound of *s* in *pleasure*. *Ch* and *j*, it should
be added, each transliterate two Servian sounds, only one of which
corresponds to the English value of the letter used for it. The Servian
“vocalic *r*,” as in *Srja*, has been rendered by *ri*, *Srija*. *C* has
not been used in the transliteration; thus, *Tsétinye* (Cetinje). The
accent of words of two syllable is always on the first syllable; on
words of three or more syllables the accent is always marked. No attempt
has been made to indicate the quantities of the Servian vowels or the
secondary accents.
