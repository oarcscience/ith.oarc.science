## THE WIFE OF HASAN AGA<span id="page_271_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_271_note_1)

W<span class="small">HAT</span> shows white in the wood? A flock of
swans or a bank of snow?  
Swans would have flown and a snow bank would have melted long ago.  
It is not snow, nor a milk-white swan, but Hasan Aga’s tent;  
Sore wounded was he. His mother and sister to him went;  
For very shame his wife came not.<span

healed aright,

|                                       |                          |

| He charged his faithful wife withal:  |                          |
|                                       | “Come not into my sight; |

Await me never, woman, my fair white house within;  
Nor yet do thou abide me in the houses of my kin.”  
 When the faithful woman heard it, sad was her heart indeed.  
Suddenly from the house she heard the trampling of the steed.  
To the window she ran, to break her neck by leaping down from the
tower;  
But the daughters of Hasan Aga pursued her in that hour:  
 “Return to us, dear mother! Our father comes not,” said they;  
“It is thy brother, our uncle, Pintórovich the Bey.”  
 The wife of Hasan Aga, to her brother’s breast she came:  
“Ah, brother, from my children five doth he send me! It is shame!”  
 Naught said the bey; in his silken pouch forthwith his hand he thrust  
For a bill of divorce that granted her her dower held in trust,<span
id="page_272_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_272_note_1)  
And bade her go to her mother. When the purport thereof she wist,  

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

Forthwith upon the forehead her two fair sons she kissed,  
And on their rosy cheeks she kissed her little daughters twain.  
But the little son in the cradle she could not leave for pain.  
Her brother took the lady’s hand; and hard it was to lead  
That wretched woman from her babe, but he threw her on the steed;  
He brought her unto the white house, and there he took her in.  
A little while, but scarce a week, she stayed among her kin.  
Good is the matron’s parentage, men seek her in marriage withal;  
But the great Cadi of Imoski desires her most of all.  
 “So should I not desire it,” imploringly she said.  
“Brother, I prithee, give me not to any to be wed,  
That my heart break not with looking on my children motherless.”  
 But the bey no whit he cared at all because of her distress;  
To the great Cadi of Imoski he will give her to be wed.  
Still the matron with her brother most miserably she pled,  
That he a milk-white letter to the cadi should prepare,  

|                                   |                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| And send it to the cadi:          |                                                                                    |
|                                   |                                                                                    |
| <span id="page_274">p. 274</span> |                                                                                    |
|                                   | “The matron<span id="page_274_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_274_note_1) greets thee fair, |

And implores thee: when that thou hast brought the wooers from every
side,  
And when thou comest to her white house,<span
id="page_274_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_274_note_2) do thou bring a veil for
the bride,  
That she see not by the aga’s house her children motherless.”  
 When the letter came to the cadi, with pomp and lordliness  
He gathered many wooers; ah, nobly did they come!  
And splendidly the wooers they brought the fair bride home!  
But when they were by the aga’s house, forth looked her daughters
fair,  
And her two sons came before her, and spoke to their mother there:  
“Return with us, dear mother, to eat with us again!”  
When the wife of Hasan Aga heard, she spake to the groomsman then:  
 “Brother in God, my groomsman, stop the steeds, of gentleness,  
By my house, that I may give fair gifts to my children motherless.”  
 They checked the steeds at the house for her. She gave her children
gifts;  
To either son a gilded knife, to her daughters fair long shifts,  

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

To her babe in the cradle a garment in a bit of linen tied.<span
id="page_275_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_275_note_1)  
When Hasan Aga saw it, to his two sons he cried:  
 “Hither, my children motherless! and from her stand apart!  
Pity and mercy hath she none within her stony heart!”  
 She heard. Her face smote on the ground in the deep of her distress,  
And her soul departed as she saw her children motherless.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_271">p. 271</span>

<span id="page_271_note_1"></span>[1](#page_271_fr_1) This poem is based
on the life of the Mohammedan Serbs. It is noteworthy not only from its
own literary merit, but from being the first of the Servian ballads to
become known to western Europe, and, above all, from the magnificent
translation of it by Goethe. It was first printed by the Abate Alberto
Fortis, in his *Viaggio in Dalmazia*, Venice, 1774, with an accompanying
Italian translation. Fortis probably derived the ballad from a
manuscript that is still preserved. In the next year, 1775, there
appeared a German translation of a portion of Fortis’s work (including
this ballad) *Die Sitten der Morlacken aus dem Italienischen übersetzt*,
Bern, 1765. Goethe based his own work, which was probably executed in
this same year, 1775, on this German translation, but apparently also
referred to Fortis’s original work, with its edition of the original
text. His poem was first printed in Herder’s *Volkslieder*, in 1778.
Karájich reprinted this ballad from the text of Fortis, but with a
changed orthography and several conjectural emendations. Finally, the
manuscript to which Fortis was indebted was published by Miklosich in
1883, at Vienna, along with a full discussion of the different questions
connected with the poem (*Sitzungsberichte der phil.-histor. Classe der
kaiserl. Akad, d. W.*, ciii, 413-490).

<span id="page_271_note_2"></span>[2](#page_271_fr_2) “The wife could
not even in this case overcome her dread of meeting a man. A girl is
praised in a folksong as ‘having never seen a male being.’ ” Miklosich,
p. 438.

<span id="page_272_note_1"></span>[1](#page_272_fr_1) By the Turkish law
a sum of money is promised to a woman at her marriage before the cadi;
this she may receive in case she is divorced by her husband.

<span id="page_274_note_1"></span>[1](#page_274_fr_1) “Maiden” in the
original!

<span id="page_274_note_2"></span>[2](#page_274_fr_2) This phrase was
inserted by Karájich.

up, to be saved, for a later time, when he is grown up. But the sense of
this line and the preceding is very doubtful. See Jagich, in *Archiv für
Slavische Philologie*, x, 659, 660.
