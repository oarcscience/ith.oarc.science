## PRINCE MARKO AND THE DAUGHTER OF THE MOORISH KING

|                                                           |                        |

| H<span class="small">IS</span> mother asks Prince Marko:  |                        |
|                                                           | “Marko, my little son, |

So many monasteries wherefore hast thou begun?  
Hast thou sinned before God? Or by good hap hast thou won the gold
abroad?”  

|                             |                                  |

|  Marko of Prilip answered:  |                                  |
|                             | “I will tell in the name of God. |

Once, when I was in the Moorish land, at dawn to a cistern fair  
I went, that Dapple might drink thereof; and behold, at the water
there,  
Were twelve Moors. Out of my due time I wished to water the steed;  
The twelve Moors would not let me, and a battle did we breed.  
Thereat I drew the heavy mace, and smote a black Moor down.  
We smote against each other, eleven against one.  
Two I smote down, and ten of them came furiously at me.  
Then nine of them must I abide, for I had stricken three.  
The fourth fell; eight were the champions against me that did drive.  
But I struck again; on the red ground lay ruddy corpses five.

I slew the sixth, but was taken by the six that were left alive.  
They bound me, and they bore me to the Moorish king along;  
And the king of the Moors threw me into the dungeon strong.  
Seven years was I in it: when summer was at hand  
I knew not, nor when winter had come across the land;  
Except that, when in winter the girls the snowballs cast,  
Then would they toss a snowball into the dungeon fast;  
And then I knew it was winter, as I lay within the tower.  
In the summer, they would throw me a sprig of basil flower,  
And I knew it was summer. The eighth year in prison that I was,  
I wearied not of prison, but of a Moorish lass.  
Unto the Moorish Sultan the daughter dear was she;  
Night and morn to the window of the tower she summoned me:  
 “ ‘Marko, poor lad, in the dungeon I prithee rot not here,  
But give true pledge thou wilt take me to be thy true love dear,  
If I free thee from the dungeon, and thy Dapple from the hold.  
Marko, unto thy heart’s desire will I gather ducats of gold.’  

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

 “When I saw that might was against me, and strength compelling me,  
I took my cap from off my head, and swore to it on my knee,  

|                                    |                           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| A firm pledge to the cap I swore:  |                           |
|                                    | ‘Thee I will never leave; |

A firm pledge, and moreover, ne’er will I thee deceive.  
E’en the sun is false; he warms not winter as summertide—  
Never will I renounce the pledge; thereby will I abide.’  
 “Then thought the Moorish maiden that unto her I swore.  
One night, at fall of darkness, she opened the dungeon door  
And led me out of the dungeon, and Dapple from the hold,  
And a better horse for herself. On both were holsters full of gold;  
She brought a silver-hilted sword. On the horses we laid hand,  
And forthwith galloped onward over the Moorish land.  
When the dawn shone, my mother, I sat me down to rest;  
And the Moorish maid, with her black arms she clasped me to her
breast.  
When I looked on her, my mother, she was black and her teeth were
white,  

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

And it was a thing unpleasing and dreadful in my sight.  
The silver-hilted saber forth from the sheath I drew;  
I smote her under her silken belt; the blade cut through and through.  
I seized on Dapple; still the head of the Moorish maid spake on:  
‘My brother Marko, wretched lad, leave me not here alone.’  
Then, mother, I sinned in the sight of God, but gained much gold and
gear,  
Whereby the monasteries and churches fair I rear.”
