<H2 ALIGN="center">STAR&Iacute;NA NOVAK AND THE BOLD R&Aacute;DIVOYE</H2>

S<SMALL>TAR&Iacute;NA</SMALL> N<SMALL>OVAK</SMALL> drank the wine on Rom&aacute;niya the green hill,<BR>

And R&aacute;divoye, his brother, drank with him with a will;<BR>

And Gr&uacute;itsa, St&aacute;rina&#8217;s son, R&aacute;divoye sat before;<BR>

With Gr&uacute;itsa was T&aacute;tomir and thirty hayduks more.<BR>

When the hayduks in good fellowship had drunk the liquor cold,<BR>

Then spake unto his brother R&aacute;divoye, called the bold:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;Hearest thou, brother Novak? I will leave thee behind me now.<BR>

Thou canst not go a-raiding; too grievous old art thou.<BR>

Thou dost not love to gallop on the highway any more,<BR>

To lie in wait for traders that come from the seashore.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;So spake bold R&aacute;divoye. He leaped from the ground to his feet,<BR>

He seized on Breshka by the waist; the thirty followed fleet.<BR>

Rado<A NAME="page_195_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_195_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> went over the black mount; &#8217;neath a green fir Novak lay,<BR>

With his two young sons. Brave Rado came to a crossing in the way.<BR>

A wretched chance befell him, for Mehmed the Moor rode there;<BR>

With thirty heroes and three great packs of treasure the Turks did fare.<BR>

When Mehmed saw the hayduks, he shouted to his men.<BR>

The champions drew their sabers and rushed on the outlaws then.<BR>

They had no chance in that short time their muskets to let drive.<BR>

The Turks smote thirty heads off, and Rado seized alive;<BR>

They bound his hands behind him; they led him o&#8217;er the hill,<BR>

With insult, but bold Rado sang to them with a will:<BR>

&#8195;&#8220;God slay thee, Mount Rom&aacute;niya! Dost thou breed no hawk in thee?<BR>

Flew a flock of doves with a raven before their company;<BR>

A white swan led they, and treasure beneath their wings had they.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;Child Gr&uacute;itsa heard Rado as he sang on the highway.<BR>

<TABLE><TR><TD>He spake to Star&iacute;na Novak:&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD></TD><TD>&#8220;My father, harken thou,</TD></TR></TABLE>

For out on the broad highway is some one singing now,<BR>

And speaks of Mount Rom&aacute;niya and the mountain-falcon gray.<BR>

It is like our Uncle Rado. He has gained a treasure this day,<BR>

Or else he has fallen on evil. Let us go to give him aid.&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;He seized on his Damascus gun and went to the ambuscade<BR>

On the tsar&#8217;s highway, and after him young T&aacute;tomir lightly ran;<BR>

And after the children followed Novak the ancient man.<BR>

On the highway in the ambuscade, there Novak took his ground;<BR>

And beside him his two children. O&#8217;er the mountain came a sound,<BR>

And presently thirty champions before them did appear,<BR>

And every champion carried a hayduk&#8217;s head on his spear.<BR>

And Mehmed the Moor before him drove the bound Rado still,<BR>

And likewise three loads of treasure on the high road over the hill,<BR>

Till into the ambuscade he marched with the squadron of his might.<BR>

Novak shouted to his children. They fired the muskets light;<BR>

Mehmed the Moor they hit in the belt. He did not yell one yell&#8212;<BR>

Dead was Mehmed the mighty Moor, ere to the ground he fell.<BR>

The Moor fell there on the green grass. St&aacute;rina Novak sped,<BR>

And swung his saber in the air, and straight cut off his head,<BR>

And then he rushed to Rado; from his hand he cut the cord<BR>

And gave him the saber of a Moor. Now glory to God the Lord!<BR>

They made a rush upon the Turks, they cut them into bands,<BR>

And pursued them hither and yonder. Who &#8217;scaped from Rado&#8217;s hands<BR>

Young T&aacute;tomir awaited. From him who got away,<BR>

Them awaited child Gr&uacute;itsa in eagerness to slay;<BR>

And them who &#8217;scaped from Gr&uacute;itsa old Novak waited for.<BR>

They slew the thirty champions, and spoiled the Turks in war;<BR>

They won in that same hour three packs of treasure fine.<BR>

Then sat they down together to drink the yellow wine.<BR>

&#8195;Said Novak: &#8220;Tell me truly, Rado, my brother bold,<BR>

Which is better&#8212;thirty hayduks, or Star&iacute;na Novak the old?&#8221;<BR>

&#8195;To him said Rado: &#8220;My brother, the thirty better were they&#8212;<BR>

The good friends; but thy fortune they had it not this day.&#8221;<BR>

&nbsp;<BR>

&#8195;It is ill for the hero who hears not what his elders have to say.<BR>
