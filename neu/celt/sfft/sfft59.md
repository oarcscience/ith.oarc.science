### THE MERMAID OF KNOCKDOLION. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)

THE old house of Knockdolion stood near the water of Girvan, with a
black stone at the end of it. A mermaid used to come from the water at
night, and taking her seat upon this stone, would sing for hours, at the
same time combing her long yellow hair. The lady of Knockdolion found
that this serenade was an annoyance to her baby, and she thought proper
to attempt getting quit of it, by causing the stone to be broken by her
servants. The mermaid, coming next night, and finding her favourite seat
gone, sang thus--

Ye may think on your cradle--I'll think on my stane;  
And there'll never be an heir to Knockdolion again."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soon after, the
cradle was found overturned, and the baby dead under it. It is added
that the family soon after became extinct.
