### LAIRD HARRY GILLES. <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md)

THE Laird Harry Gilles of Littledean was extremely fond of hunting. One
day, as his dogs were chasing a hare, they suddenly stopped, and gave up
the pursuit, which enraged him so much that he swore the animal they had
been hunting must be one of the witches of Maxton. No sooner had he
uttered the word than hares appeared all round him, so close that they
even sprang over the saddle before his eyes, but still none of his
hounds would give them chase. In a fit of anger he jumped off his horse
and killed the dogs on the spot, all but one black hound, who at that
moment turned to pursue the largest hare. Remounting his horse, he
followed the chase, and saw the black hound turn the hare and drive it
directly towards him. The hare made a spring as if to clear his horse's
neck, but the laird dexterously caught hold of one of her fore-paws,
drew out his hunting-knife, and cut it off; after which the hares, which
had been so numerous, all disappeared. Next morning Laird Harry heard
that a woman of Maxton had lost her arm in some unaccountable manner; so
he went straight to her house, pulled out the hare's foot (which

had changed in his pocket to a woman's hand and arm), and applied it to
the stump. It fitted exactly. She confessed her crime, and was drowned
for witchcraft the same day in the well, by the young men of Maxton.
