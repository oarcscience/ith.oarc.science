### THE LAIRD O' CO'. <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)

IN the days of yore, the proprietors of Colzean, in Ayrshire, were known
in that county by the title of *Lairds o' Co'*, a name bestowed on
Colzean from some co's (or coves) in the rock underneath the castle.

One morning, a very little boy, carrying a small wooden can, addressed
the laird near the castle gate, begging for a little ale for his mother,
who was sick: the laird directed him to go to the butler and get his can
filled; so away he went as ordered. The butler had a barrel of ale on
tap, but about half full, out of

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

which he proceeded to fill the boy's can; but, to his extreme surprise,
he emptied the cask, and still the little can was not nearly full. The
butler was unwilling to broach another barrel; but the little fellow
insisted on the fulfilment of the laird's order, and a reference was
made to him by the butler, who stated the miraculously large capacity of
the tiny can, and received instant orders to fill it if all the ale in
the cellar would suffice. Obedient to this command, he broached another
cask, but had scarcely drawn a drop, when the can was full, and the
dwarf departed with expressions of gratitude.

Some years afterwards, the laird, being at the wars in Flanders, was
taken prisoner, and for some reason or other (probably as a spy)
condemned to die a felon's death. The night prior to the day appointed
for his execution, being confined in a dungeon strongly barricaded, the
doors suddenly flew open, and the dwarf reappeared, saying--

"Laird o' Co',  
Rise an' go"--

a summons too welcome to require repetition.

On emerging from prison, the boy caused him to mount on his shoulders,
and in a short time set him down at his own gate, on the very spot where
they had first met, saying--

"Ae guid turn deserves anither--  
Tak ye that for bein' sae kind to my auld mither,"

and vanished.
