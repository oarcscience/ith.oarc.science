### THE MERMAID WIFE. <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md)

A STORY is told of an inhabitant of Unst, who, in walking on the sandy
margin of a voe, <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89.md) saw a number of
mermen and mermaids dancing by moonlight, and several seal-skins strewed
beside them on the ground. At his approach they immediately fled to
secure their garbs, and, taking upon themselves the form of seals,
plunged immediately into the sea. But as the Shetlander perceived that
one skin lay close to his feet, he snatched it up, bore it swiftly away,
and placed it in concealment. On returning to the shore he met the
fairest damsel that was ever gazed upon by mortal eyes, lamenting the
robbery, by which she had become an exile from her submarine friends,
and a tenant of the upper world. Vainly she implored the restitution of
her property; the man had drunk

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

deeply of love, and was inexorable; but he offered her protection
beneath his roof as his betrothed spouse. The merlady, perceiving that
she must become an inhabitant of the earth, found that she could not do
better than accept of the offer. This strange attachment subsisted for
many years, and the couple had several children. The Shetlander's love
for his merwife was unbounded, but his affection was coldly returned.
The lady would often steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal
being given, a large seal would make his appearance, with whom she would
hold, in an unknown tongue, an anxious conference. Years had thus glided
away, when it happened that one of the children, in the course of his
play, found concealed beneath a stack of corn a seal's skin; and,
delighted with the prize, he ran with it to his mother. Her eyes
glistened with rapture--she gazed upon it as her own--as the means by
which she could pass through the ocean that led to her native home. She
burst forth into an ecstasy of joy, which was only moderated when she
beheld her children, whom she was now about to leave; and, after hastily
embracing them, she fled with all speed towards the seaside. The husband
immediately returned, learned the discovery that had taken place, ran to
overtake his wife, but only arrived in time to see her transformation of
shape completed--to see her, in the form of a seal, bound from the ledge
of a rock into the sea. The large animal of the same kind with whom she
had held a secret converse soon appeared, and evidently congratulated
her, in the most

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

tender manner, on her escape. But before she dived to unknown depths,
she cast a parting glance at the wretched Shetlander, whose despairing
looks excited in her breast a few transient feelings of commiseration.

"Farewell!" said she to him, "and may all good attend you. I loved you
very well when I resided upon earth, but I always loved my first husband
much better."
