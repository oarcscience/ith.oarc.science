### THE EAGLE AND THE WREN. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)

THE Eagle and the Wren once tried who could fly highest, and the victor
was to be king of the birds. So the Wren flew straight up, and the Eagle
flew in great circles, and when the Wren was tired he settled on the
Eagle's back. When the Eagle was tired he stopped, and--

"Where art thou, Wren?" said the Eagle.

"I am here above thee," said the Wren.

And so the Wren won the match.
