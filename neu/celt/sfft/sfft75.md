# COMIC TALES.

### THE WEE BUNNOCK. <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115)

Some tell about their sweethearts, how they tirled them to the
winnock, <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116)  
But I'll tell you a bonny tale about a guid aitmeal bunnock."

THERE lived an auld man and an auld wife at the side o' a burn. They had
twa kye, five hens and a cock, a cat and twa kittlins. The auld man
lookit after the kye, and the auld wife span on the tow-rock. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117) The kittlins aft grippit at the auld
wife's spindle, as it tussled owre the hearth-stane. "Sho, sho," she wad
say; "gae wa'," and so it tussled about.

Ae day, after parritch-time, she thought she would ha'e a bunnock. Sae
she bakit twa aitmeal bunnocks, and set them to the fire to harden.
After a while, the auld man came in, and sat down aside the fire, and
takes ane o' the bunnocks, and snappit it through the middle. When the
tither ane sees this, it rins aff as fast as it could, and the auld wife
after't, wi' the spindle in the tae hand and the tow-rock in

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

the tither. But the wee bunnock wan awa', and out o' sight, and ran till
it came to a guid muckle thack house, <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118) and ben <span
id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119) it ran boldly to the fireside; and there
were three tailors sitting on a muckle table. When they saw the wee
bunnock come ben, they jumpit up, and gat in ahint the guidwife, that
was cardin' tow ayont the fire. "Hout," quo' she, "be na fleyt; <span
id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_120) it's but a wee bunnock. Grip it, and
I'll gie ye a soup milk till't." Up she gets wi' the tow-cards, and the
tailor wi' the goose, and the twa 'prentices, the ane wi' the muckle
shears, and the tither wi' the lawbrod; <span
id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_121) but it jinkit <span
id="fr_122"></span>[5](#fn_122) them, and ran round about the fire; and
ane o' the 'prentices, thinking to snap it wi' the shears, fell i' the
ase-pit. The tailor cuist <span id="fr_123"></span>[6](#fn_123) the
goose, and the guidwife the tow-cards; but a' wadna do. The bunnock wan
awa', and ran till it came to a wee house at the roadside; and in it
rins, and there was a weaver sittin' on the loom, and the wife winnin' a
clue o' yarn.

"Tibby," quo' he, "what's tat?" "Oh," quo' she, "it's a wee bunnock."
"It's weel come," quo' he, "for our sowens <span
id="fr_124"></span>[7](#fn_124) were but thin the day. Grip it, my
woman; grip it." "Ay," quo' she; "what reeks! That's a clever bunnock.
Kep, <span id="fr_125"></span>[8](#fn_125) Willie; kep, man." "Hout,"
quo' Willie; "cast the clue at it." But the bunnock whipit round about,
and but the floor, <span id="fr_126"></span>[9](#fn_126) and aff it
gaed, and owre the knowe, <span id="fr_127"></span>[10](#fn_127) like a
new-tarred

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

sheep or a daft yell cow. <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128) And
forrit it runs to the neist house, and ben to the fireside. And there
was the guidwife kirnin'. <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_129) "Come
awa', wee bunnock," quo' she; "I'se hae ream <span
id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_130) and bread the day." But the wee bunnock
whipit round about the kirn, and the wife after't, and i' the hurry she
had near-hand coupit the kirn. <span id="fr_131"></span>[4](#fn_131) And
afore she got it set right again, the wee bunnock was aff, and down the
brae to the mill. And in it ran.

The miller was siftin' meal i' the trough; but, looking up, "Ay," quo'
he, "it's a sign o' plenty when ye're rinnin' about, and naebody to look
after ye. But I like a bunnock and cheese. Come your wa's ben, and I'll
gie ye a night's quarters." But the bunnock wadna trust itsel' wi' the
miller and his cheese. Sae it turned and ran its wa's out; but the
miller didna fash his head wi't. <span id="fr_132"></span>[5](#fn_132)
So it toddled awa', and ran till it came to the smithy. And in it rins,
and up to the studdy. <span id="fr_133"></span>[6](#fn_133) The smith
was making horse-nails. Quo' he, "I like a bicker o' guid yill <span
id="fr_134"></span>[7](#fn_134) and a weel-toastit bunnock. Come your
wa's in by here." But the bunnock was frightened when it heard about the
yill, and turned and aff as hard as it could, and the smith after't, and
cuist the hammer. But it whirlt awa', and out o' sight in a crack, and
ran till it came to a farm-house wi' a guid muckle peat-stack at the end
o't. Ben it rins to the fireside. The

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

guidman was clovin' line, <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135) and the
guidwife hecklin'. <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136) "Oh, Janet,"
quo' he, "there's a wee bunnock; I'se ha'e the hauf o't." "Weel, John,
I'se ha'e the tither hauf. Hit it owre the back wi' the clove." But the
bunnock playt jink-about. <span id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_137) "Hout
tout," quo' the wife, and gart the heckle flee at it. <span
id="fr_138"></span>[4](#fn_138) But it was owre clever for her.

And aff and up the burn it ran to the neist house, and whirlt its wa's
ben to the fireside. The guidwife was stirrin' the sowens, and the
guidman plettin' spret-binnings for the kye. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[5](#fn_139) "Ho, Jock," quo' the guidwife, "come
here. Thou's aye crying about a wee bunnock. Here's ane. Come in, haste
ye, and I'll help thee to grip it." "Ay, mither, whaur is't?" "See
there. Rin owre o' that side." But the bunnock ran in ahint the
guidman's chair. Jock fell among the sprits. The guidman cuist a
binning, and the guidwife the spurtle. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[6](#fn_140) But it was owre clever for Jock and her
baith. It was aff and out o' sight in a crack, and through among the
whins, <span id="fr_141"></span>[7](#fn_141) and down the road to the
neist house, and in, and ben to the fireside. The folk were just sittin'
down to their sowens, and the guidwife scartin' the pat. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[8](#fn_142) "Losh," quo' she, "there's a wee bunnock
come in to warm itsel' at our fireside." "Steek <span
id="fr_143"></span>[9](#fn_143) the door," quo' the guidman, "and we'll
try to get a grip o't." When the bunnock

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

heard that, it ran but the house, and they after't wi' their spunes, and
the guidman cuist his bunnat. <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144) But
it whirlt awa', and ran, and better ran, till it came to another house.
And when it gaed ben, the folk were just gaun to their beds. The guidman
was castin' aff his breeks, and the guidwife rakin' the fire. "What's
tat?" quo' he. "Oh," quo' she, "it's a wee bunnock." Quo' he, "I could
eat the hauf o't, for a' the brose I hae suppit." "Grip it," quo' the
wife, "and I'll hae a bit too." "Cast your breeks at it--kep--kep!" The
guidman cuist the breeks, and had near-hand smoor't <span
id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145) it. But it warsl't <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146) out, and ran, and the guidman after't,
wanting the breeks. And there was a clean chase owre the craft <span
id="fr_147"></span>[4](#fn_147) park, and up the wunyerd, and in amang
the whins. And the guidman lost it, and had to come his wa's trottin
hame hauf nakit. But now it was grown dark, and the' wee bunnock couldna
see; but it gaed into the side o a muckle whin bush, and into a tod's
hole. <span id="fr_148"></span>[5](#fn_148) The tod had gotten nae meat
for twa days. "Oh, welcome, welcome," quo' the tod, and snappit it in
twa i' the middle. And that was the end o' the wee bunnock,

Now, be ye lords or commoners,  
Ye needna laugh nor sneer,  
For ye'll be a' i' the tod's hole  
In less than a hunner year."
