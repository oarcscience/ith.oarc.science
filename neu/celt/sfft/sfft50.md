# THE BROWNIE, THE BOGLE, THE KELPY, MERMEN, DEMONS.

### THE SCOTTISH BROWNIE. <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78)

THE Scottish Brownie formed a class of beings distinct in habit and
disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves. He was meagre,
shaggy, and wild in his appearance.

In the daytime he lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which he
delighted to haunt; and in the night sedulously employed himself in
discharging any laborious task which he thought might be acceptable to
the family to whose service he had devoted himself. But the Brownie does
not drudge from the hope of recompense. On the contrary, so delicate is
his attachment that the offer of reward, but particularly of food,
infallibly occasions his disappearance for ever. It is told of a
Brownie, who haunted a Border family now extinct, that the lady having
fallen unexpectedly in labour, and the servant, who was ordered to ride
to Jedburgh for the *sage-femme*, showing no great alertness in setting
out, the familiar spirit slipt on the great-coat of the lingering
domestic,

rode to the town on the laird's best horse, and returned with the
midwife *en croupe*. During the short space of his absence, the Tweed,
which they must necessarily ford, rose to a dangerous height. Brownie,
who transported his charge with all rapidity, was not to be stopped by
this obstacle. He plunged in with the terrified old lady, and landed her
in safety where her services were wanted. Having put the horse into the
stable (where it was afterwards found in a woful plight), he proceeded
to the room of the servant whose duty he had discharged, and, finding
him just in the act of drawing on his boots, administered to him a most
merciless drubbing with his own horsewhip. Such an important service
excited the gratitude of the laird, who, understanding that Brownie had
been heard to express a wish to have a green coat, ordered a vestment of
that colour to be made and left in his haunts. Brownie took away the
green coat, but was never seen more. We may suppose that, tired of his
domestic drudgery, he went in his new livery to join the fairies.
