### THE DOOMED RIDER. <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

"Tim Conan is as bonny a river as we hae in a' the north country.
There's mony a sweet sunny spot on its banks, an' mony a time an' aft
hae I waded through its shallows, whan a boy, to set my little
scauting-line for the trouts an' the eels, or to gather the big
pearl-mussels that lie sae thick in the fords. But its bonny wooded
banks are places for enjoying the day in--no for passing the nicht. I
kenna how it is; it's nane ol your wild streams that wander desolate
through a desert country, like the Avon, or that come rushing down in
foam and thunder, ower broken rocks, like the Foyers, or that wallow in
darkness, deep, deep in the bowels o' the earth, like the fearfu'
Auldgraunt; an' yet no ane o' these rivers

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

has mair or frightfuller stories connected wi' it than the Conan. Ane
can hardly saunter ower half-a-mile in its course, frae where it leaves
Contin till where it enters the sea, without passing ower the scene o'
some frightful auld legend o' the kelpie or the water-wraith. And ane o'
the most frightful looking o' these places is to be found among the
woods of Conan House. Ye enter a swampy meadow that waves wi' flags an'
rushes like a cornfield in harvest, an' see a hillock covered wi'
willows rising like an island in the midst. There are thick mirk-woods
on ilka side; the river, dark an' awesome, an' whirling round an' round
in mossy eddies, sweeps away behind it; an' there is an auld
burying-ground, wi' the broken ruins o' an auld Papist kirk, on the tap.
Ane can see amang the rougher stanes the rose-wrought mullions of an
arched window, an' the trough that ance held the holy water. About twa
hunder years ago--a wee mair maybe, or a wee less, for ane canna be very
sure o' the date o' thae old stories--the building was entire; an' a
spot near it, whar the wood now grows thickest, was laid out in a
corn-field. The marks o' the furrows may still be seen amang the trees.

"A party o' Highlanders were busily engaged, ae day in harvest, in
cutting down the corn o' that field.; an' just aboot noon, when the sun
shone brightest an' they were busiest in the work, they heard a voice
frae the river exclaim, 'The hour but not the man has come.' Sure
enough, on looking round, there was the kelpie stan'in' in what they ca'
a fause ford, just fornent the auld kirk. There is a deep black

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

pool baith aboon an' below, but i' the ford there's a bonny ripple, that
shows, as ane might think, but little depth ol water; an' just i' the
middle o' that, in a place where a horse might swim, stood the kelpie.
An' it again repeated its words, 'The hour but not the man has come,'
an' then flashing through the water like a drake, it disappeared in the
lower pool. When the folk stood wondering what the creature might mean,
they saw a man on horseback come spurring down the hill in hot haste,
making straight for the fause ford. They could then understand her words
at ance; an' four o' the stoutest o' them sprang oot frae amang the corn
to warn him o' his danger, an' keep him back. An' sae they tauld him
what they had seen an' heard, an' urged him either to turn back an' tak'
anither road, or stay for an hour or sae where he was. But he just wadna
hear them, for he was baith unbelieving an' in haste, an' wauld hae taen
the ford for a' they could say, hadna the Highlanders, determined on
saving him whether he would or no, gathered round him an' pulled him
frae his horse, an' then, to mak' sure of him, locked him up in the auld
kirk. Weel, when the hour had gone by--the fatal hour o' the
kelpie--they flung open the door, an' cried to him that he might noo
gang on his journey. Ah I but there was nae answer, though; an' sae they
cried a second time, an' there was nae answer still; and then they went
in, an' found him lying stiff an' cauld on the floor, wi' his face
buried in the water o' the very stone trough that we may still see amang
the ruins. His hour had come. an' he had

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

fallen in a fit, as 'twould seem, head-foremost amang the water o' the
trough, where he had been smothered,--an' sae ye see, the prophecy o'
the kelpie availed naething."
