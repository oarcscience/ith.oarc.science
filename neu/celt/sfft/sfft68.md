### THE MILLER OF HOLDEAN. <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md)

WHILE the miller of Holdean, in Berwickshire, was drying a melder <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) of oats, belonging to a neighbouring
farmer, tired with the fatigues of the day, he threw himself down upon
some straw in the kiln-barn, and soon fell fast asleep. After a time he
was awakened by a confused noise, as if the killogee <span
id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103.md) were full of people, all speaking
together; on which he pulled

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

aside the straw from the banks of the kiln, and, looking down, observed
a number of feet and legs paddling among the ashes, as if enjoying the
warmth from the scarcely extinguished fires. As he listened, he
distinctly heard the words, "What think ye o' my feeties?"--a second
voice answering, "An' what think ye o' mine?" Nothing daunted, though
much astonished, the stout-hearted miller took up his "beer mell," a
large wooden hammer, and threw it down among them, so that the ashes
flew about; while he cried out with a loud voice, "What think ye o' my
meikle mell amang a' thae legs o' yourn?" A hideous rout at once emerged
from the kiln amid yells and cries, which passed into wild laughter; and
finally these words reached the miller's ears, sung in a mocking tone--

Mount and fly for Rhymer's tower,  
                    Ha, ha, ha, ha!  
The pawky <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) miller hath beguiled
us  
Or we wud hae stown <span id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105.md) his luck  
For this seven years to come,  
And mickle water wud hae run  
             While the miller slept."
