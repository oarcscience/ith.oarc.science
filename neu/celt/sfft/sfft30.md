### SIR GODFREY MACCULLOCH. <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md)

THE Scottish Fairies, in like manner, sometimes reside in subterranean
abodes, in the vicinity of human habitations, or, according to the
popular phrase, under the "door-stane," or threshold; in which situation
they sometimes establish an intercourse with men, by borrowing and
lending, and other kindly offices. In this capacity they are termed "the
good neighbours," from supplying privately the wants of their friends,
and assisting them in all their transactions, while their favours are
concealed. Of this the traditionary story of Sir Godfrey Macculloch
forms a curious example.

As this Gallovidian gentleman was taking the air on horseback, near his
own house he was suddenly accosted by a little old man arrayed in green,
and mounted upon a white palfrey. After mutual salutation, the old man
gave Sir Godfrey to understand that he resided under his habitation, and
that he had great reason to complain of the direction of a drain, or
common sewer, which emptied itself directly into his chamber of
daïs <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md). Sir Godfrey Macculloch was

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

a good deal startled at this extraordinary complaint; but, guessing the
nature of the being he had to deal with, he assured the old man, with
great courtesy, that the direction of the drain should be altered; and
caused it to be done accordingly. Many years afterwards Sir Godfrey had
the misfortune to kill, in a fray, a gentleman of the neighbourhood. He
was apprehended, tried, and condemned. The scaffold upon which his head
was to be struck off was erected on the Castle Hill of Edinburgh; but
hardly had he reached the fatal spot when the old man, upon his white
palfrey, pressed through the crowd with the rapidity of lightning. Sir
Godfrey, at his command, sprung on behind him; the "good neighbour"
spurred his horse down the steep bank, and neither he nor the criminal
was ever again seen.
