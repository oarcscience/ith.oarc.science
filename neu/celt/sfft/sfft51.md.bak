### THE BROWNIE OF BODSBECK. <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

Tim brownie of the farmhouse of Bodsbeek, in Moffatdale, left his
employment upwards of a century ago, on a similar account. He had
exerted himself so much in the f arm labour, both in and out of

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

doors, that Bodsbeek became the most prosperous farm in the district. He
always took his meat as it pleased himself, usually in very moderate
quantities, and of the most humble description. During a time of very
hard labour, perhaps harvest, when a little better fare than ordinary
might have been judged acceptable, the goodman took the liberty of
leaving out a mess of bread and milk, thinking it but fair that at a
time when some improvement, both in quantity and quality, was made upon
the fare of the human servants, the useful brownie should obtain a share
in the blessing. He, however, found his error, for the result was that
the brownie left the house for ever, exclaiming--

"Ca', brownie, ca'  
A' the luck o' Bodsbeck away to Leithenha'."

The luck of Bodsbeek accordingly departed with its brownie, and settled
in the neighbouring farmhouse, called Leithenhall, whither the brownie
transferred his friendship and services.
