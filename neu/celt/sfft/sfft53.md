### THE BOGLE. <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81)

THIS is a freakish spirit, who delights rather to perplex and frighten
mankind than either to serve or seriously to hurt them. *Shellycoat*, a
spirit who resides in the waters, and has given his name to many a rock
and stone the Scottish coast, belongs to the class of bogles. When he
appeared, he seemed to be decked with marine productions, and in
particular with shells, whose clattering announced his approach. From
this circumstance he derived his name. One of his pranks is thus
narrated:--Two men, on a very dark night, approaching the banks of the
Ettrick, heard a doleful voice from its waves repeatedly exclaim, "Lost!
Lost!" They followed the sound, which seemed to be the voice of a
drowning person, and, to their infinite astonishment, they found that it
ascended the river. Still they continued, during

a long and tempestuous night, to follow the cry of the malicious sprite;
and arriving, before morning's dawn, at the very sources of the river,
the voice was now heard descending the opposite side of the mountain in
which they arise. The fatigued and deluded travellers now relinquished
the pursuit, and had no sooner done so than they heard Shellycoat
applauding, in loud bursts of laughter, his successful roguery. The
spirit was supposed particularly to haunt the old house of Gorinberry,
situated on the river Hermitage, in Liddesdale.
