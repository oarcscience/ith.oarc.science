### THE TWO SHEPHERDS. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)

THERE, were out between Lochaber and Baideanach two shepherds who were
neighbours to each

other) and the one would often be going to see the other. One was on the
east side of a river, and another on the west. The one who was on the
west side of the river came to the house of the one who was on the east
of it on an evening visit. He stayed till it was pretty late, and then
he wished to go home. "It is time to go home," said he. "It is not that
which thou shalt do, but thou shalt stay to-night," said the other,
"since it is so long in the night." "I will not stay at all events; if I
were over the river I don't care more." The houseman had a pretty strong
son, and he said, "I will go with thee, and I will set thee over the
river, but thou hadst better stay." "I will not stay at all events." "If
thou wilt not stay I will go with thee." The son of the houseman called
a dog which he had herding. The dog went with him. When he set the man
on the other side of the river, the man said to him, "Be returning now;
I am far in thy debt." The strong lad returned, and the dog with him.
When he reached the river as he was returning back home, he was thinking
whether he should take the stepping-stones, or put off his foot-clothes
and take below. He put off his foot-clothes for fear of taking the
stepping-stones, and when he was over there in the river the dog that
was with him leaped at the back of his head. He threw her off him; she
leaped again; he did the same thing. When he was on the other side of
the river he put his hand on his head, and there was not a bit of a
bonnet on it. He was saying, whether should he return to seek the
bonnet, or should he go home without it. "It's

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

disgusting for me to return home without my bonnet; I will return over
yet to the place where I put my foot-clothes off me; I doubt it is there
that I left it." So he returned to the other side of the river. He saw a
right big man seated where he had been, and his own bonnet in his hand.
He caught hold of the bonnet, and he took it from him. "What business
hast thou there with that?--It is mine, and thou hadst no business to
take it from me, though thou hast got it." Over the river then they
went, without a word for each other, fiercely, hatingly. When they went
over, then, on the river, the big man put his hand under the arm of the
shepherd, and he began to drag the lad down to a loch that was there,
against his will and against his strength. They stood front to front,
bravely, firmly on either side. In spite of the strength of the
shepherd's son, the big man was about to conquer. It was so that the
shepherd's son thought of putting his hand about an oak tree that was in
the place. The big man was striving to take him with him, and the tree
was bending and twisting. At last the tree was loosening in the earth.
She loosened all but one of her roots. At the time when the last root of
the tree slipped, the cocks that were about the wood crowed. The
shepherd's son understood when he heard the cocks crowing that it was on
the short side of day. When they heard between them the cocks crowing,
the big man said, "Thou hast stood well, and thou hadst need, or thy
bonnet had been dear for thee." The big man left him, and they never
more noticed a thing near the river.
