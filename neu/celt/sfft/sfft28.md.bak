# FAIRY TALES.

### THE FAIRIES OF SCOTLAND. <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md)

THE Fairies of Scotland are represented as a diminutive race of beings,
of a mixed, or rather dubious nature, capricious in their dispositions,
and mischievous in their resentment. They inhabit the interior of green
hills, chiefly those of a conical form, in Gaelic termed Sighan, on
which they lead their dances by moonlight; impressing upon the surface
the marks of circles, which sometimes appear yellow and blasted,
sometimes of a deep green hue; and within which it is dangerous to
sleep, or to be found after sunset. The removal of those large portions
of turf, which thunder-bolts sometimes scoop out of the ground with
singular regularity, is also ascribed to their agency. Cattle, which are
suddenly seized with the cramp, or some similar disorder, are said to be
elf-shot, and the approved cure is, to chafe the parts affected with a
blue bonnet, which, it may be readily believed, often restores the
circulation. The triangular flints, frequently found in Scotland, with
which the ancient inhabitants probably barbed their shafts,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

are supposed to be the weapons of Fairy resentment, and are termed elf
arrow-heads. The rude brazen battle-axes of the ancients, commonly
called celts, are also ascribed to their manufacture. But, like the
Gothic duergar, their skill is not confined to the fabrication of arms;
for they are heard sedulously hammering in linns, precipices, and rocky
or cavernous situations, where, like the dwarfs of the mines, mentioned
by Georg. Agricola, they busy themselves in imitating the actions and
the various employments of men. The Brook of Beaumont, for example,
which passes, in its course, by numerous linns and caverns, is notorious
for being haunted by the Fairies, and the perforated and rounded stones
which are formed by trituration in its channel are termed, by the
vulgar, fairy cups and dishes.

It is sometimes accounted unlucky to pass such places, without
performing some ceremony to avert the displeasure of the elves. There
is, upon the top of Minchmuir, a mountain in Peeblesshire, a spring
called the Cheese Well, because, anciently, those who passed that way
were wont to throw into it a piece of cheese, as an offering to the
Fairies, to whom it--was consecrated.

The usual dress of the Fairies is green; though. on the moors they have
been sometimes observed in heath-brown, or in weeds dyed with the
stoneraw, or lichen. They often ride in invisible procession, when their
presence is discovered by the shrill ringing of their bridles. On these
occasions they sometimes borrow mortal steeds; and when such are found
at morning,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

panting and fatigued in their stalls, with their manes and tails
dishevelled and entangled, the grooms, I presume, often find this a
convenient excuse for their situation; as the common belief of the elves
quaffing the choicest liquors in the cellars of the rich might
occasionally cloak the delinquencies of an unfaithful butler.
