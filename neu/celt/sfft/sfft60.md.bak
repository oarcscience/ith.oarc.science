### THE YOUNG LAIRD OF LORNTIE. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md)

THE young Laird of Lorntie, in Forfarshire, was one evening returning
from a hunting excursion, attended by a single servant and two
greyhounds, when, in passing a solitary lake, which lies about three
miles south from Lorntie, and was in those times closely surrounded with
natural wood, his ears were suddenly assailed by the shrieks of a female
apparently drowning. Being of a fearless character, he instantly spurred
his horse forward to the side of the lake, and there saw a beautiful
female struggling with the water, and, as it seemed to him, just in the
act of sinking. "Help, help, Lorntie!" she exclaimed. "Help,
Lorntie-----help, Lor-----," and the waters seemed to choke the last
sounds of her voice as they gurgled in her throat. The laird, unable to
resist the impulse of humanity, rushed into the lake, and was about to
grasp the long yellow locks of the lady, which lay like hanks of gold
upon the water, when he was suddenly seized behind, and forced out of
the lake by his servant, who, farther-sighted than his master, perceived
the whole affair to be the feint of a water-spirit. "Bide, Lorntie--bide
a blink!" cried the faithful creature, as the laird was about to

dash him to the earth; "that wauling madam was nae other, God sauf us!
than the mermaid." Lorntie instantly acknowledged the truth of this
asseveration, which, as he prepared to mount his horse, was confirmed by
the mermaid raising herself half out of the water, and exclaiming, in a
voice of fiendish disappointment and ferocity,--

Lorntie, Lorntie,  
Were it na your man,  
I had got your heart's bluid  
Skirl <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) in my pan."
