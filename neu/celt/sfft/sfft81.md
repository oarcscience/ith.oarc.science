### ELPHIN IRVING. <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md)

### THE FAIRIES' CUPBEARER.

THE romantic vale of Corriewater, in Annandale, is regarded by the
inhabitants, a pastoral and unmingled

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

people, as the last Border refuge of those beautiful and capricious
beings, the fairies. Many old people yet living imagine they have had
intercourse of good words and good deeds with the "good folk"; and
continue to tell that in the ancient of days the fairies danced on the
hill, and revelled in the glen, and showed themselves, like the
mysterious children of the deity of old, among the sons and daughters of
men. Their visits to the earth were periods of joy and mirth to mankind,
rather than of sorrow and apprehension. They played on musical
instruments of wonderful sweetness and variety of note, spread
unexpected feasts, the supernatural flavour of which overpowered on many
occasions the religious scruples of the Presbyterian shepherds,
performed wonderful deeds of horsemanship, and marched in midnight
processions, when the sound of their elfin minstrelsy charmed youths and
maidens into love for their persons and pursuits; and more than one
family of Corriewater have the fame of augmenting the numbers of the
elfin chivalry. Faces of friends and relatives, long since doomed to the
battle-trench or the deep sea, have been recognised by those who dared
to gaze on the fairy march. The maid has seen her lost lover and the
mother her stolen child; and the courage to plan and achieve their
deliverance has been possessed by at least one Border maiden. In the
legends of the people of Corrievale there is a singular mixture of elfin
and human adventure, and the traditional story of the Cupbearer to the
Queen of the Fairies appeals alike to our domestic feelings and
imagination.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

In one of the little green loops, or bends, on the banks of Corriewater,
mouldered walls, and a few stunted wild plum-trees and vagrant roses,
still point out the site of a cottage and garden. A well of pure
spring-water leaps out from an old tree-root before the door; and here
the shepherds, shading themselves in summer from the influence of the
sun, tell to their children the wild tale of Elphin Irving and his
sister Phemie; and, singular as the story seems, it has gained full
credence among the people where the scene is laid.

When Elphin Irving and his sister Phemie were in their sixteenth year,
for tradition says they were twins, their father was drowned in
Corriewater, attempting to save his sheep from a sudden swell, to which
all mountain streams are liable; and their mother, on the day of her
husband's burial, laid down her head on the pillow, from which, on the
seventh day, it was lifted to be dressed for the same grave. The
inheritance left to the orphans may be briefly described: seventeen
acres of plough and pasture land, seven milk cows, and seven pot sheep
(many old people take delight in odd numbers); and to this may be added
seven bonnet-pieces of Scottish gold, and a broadsword and spear, which
their ancestor had wielded with such strength and courage in the battle
of Dryfe Sands, that the minstrel who sang of that deed of arms ranked
him only second to the Scotts and Johnstones.

The youth and his sister grow in stature and in beauty. The brent bright
brow, the clear blue eye,

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

and frank and blithe deportment of the former gave him some influence
among the young women of the valley; while the latter was no less the
admiration of the young men, and at fair and dance, and at bridal, happy
was he who touched but her hand or received the benediction of her eye.
Like all other Scottish beauties, she was the theme of many a song; and
while tradition is yet busy with the singular history of her brother,
song has taken all the care that rustic minstrelsy can of the gentleness
of her spirit and the charms of her person.

But minstrel skill and true love tale seemed to want their usual
influence when they sought to win her attention; she was only observed
to pay most respect to those youths who were most beloved by her
brother; and the same hour that brought these twins to the world seemed
to have breathed through them a sweetness and an affection of heart and
mind, which nothing could divide. If, like the virgin queen of the
immortal poet, she walked "in maiden meditation fancy free," her brother
Elphin seemed alike untouched with the charms of the fairest virgins in
Corrie. He ploughed his field, he reaped his grain, he leaped, he ran,
and wrestled, and danced, and sang, with more skill and life and grace
than all other youths of the district; but he had no twilight and stolen
interviews; when all other young men had their loves by their side, he
was single, though not unsought, and his joy seemed never perfect save
when his sister was near him. If he loved to share his time with her,
she loved to share her time with him alone,

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

or with the beasts of the field, or the birds of the air. She watched
her little flock late, and she tended it early; not for the sordid love
of the fleece, unless it was to make mantles for her brother, but with
the look of one who had joy in its company. The very wild creatures, the
deer and the hares, seldom sought to shun her approach, and the bird
forsook not its nest, nor stinted its song, when she drew nigh; such is
the confidence which maiden innocence and beauty inspire.

It happened one summer, about three years after they became orphans,
that rain had been for awhile withheld from the earth, the hillsides
began to parch, the grass in the vales to wither, and the stream of
Corrie was diminished between its banks to the size of an ordinary rill.
The shepherds drove their flocks to moorlands, and marsh and tarn had
their reeds invaded by the scythe to supply the cattle with food. The
sheep of his sister were Elphin's constant care; he drove them to the
moistest pastures during the day, and he often watched them at midnight,
when flocks, tempted by the sweet dewy grass, are known to browse
eagerly, that he might guard them from the fox, and lead them to the
choicest herbage. In these nocturnal watchings he sometimes drove his
little flock over the water of Corrie, for the fords were hardly
ankle-deep; or permitted his sheep to cool themselves in the stream, and
taste the grass which grew along the brink. All this time not a drop of
rain fell, nor did a cloud appear in the sky.

One evening, during her brother's absence with the

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

flock, Phemie sat at her cottage door, listening to the bleatings of the
distant folds and the lessened murmur of the water of Corrie, now
scarcely audible beyond its banks. Her eyes, weary with watching along
the accustomed line of road for the return of Elphin, were turned on the
pool beside her, in which the stars were glimmering fitful and faint. As
she looked she imagined the water grew brighter and brighter; a wild
illumination presently shone upon the pool, and leaped from bank to
bank, and suddenly changing into a human form, ascended the margin, and,
passing her, glided swiftly into the cottage. The visionary form was so
like her brother in shape and air, that, starting up, she flew into the
house, with the hope of finding him in his customary seat. She found him
not, and, impressed with the terror which a wraith or apparition seldom
fails to inspire, she uttered a shriek so loud and so piercing as to be
heard at Johnstone Bank, on the other side of the vale of Corrie.

It is hardly known how long Phemie Irving continued in a state of
insensibility. The morning was far advanced, when a neighbouring maiden
found her seated in an old chair, as white as monumental marble; her
hair, about which she had always been solicitous, loosened from its
curls, and hanging disordered over her neck and bosom, her hands and
forehead. The maiden touched the one, and kissed the other; they were as
cold as snow; and her eyes, wide open, were fixed on her brother's empty
chair, with the intensity of gaze of one who had witnessed the
appearance

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

of a spirit. She seemed insensible of any one's presence, and sat fixed
and still and motionless. The maiden, alarmed at her looks, thus
addressed her:--"Phemie, lass, Phemie Irving! Dear me, but this be
awful! I have come to tell ye that seven of your pet sheep have escaped
drowning in the water; for Corrie, sae quiet and sae gentle yestreen, is
rolling and dashing frae bank to bank this morning. Dear me, woman,
dinna let the loss of the world's gear bereave ye of your senses. I
would rather make ye a present of a dozen mug-ewes of the Tinwald brood
myself; and now I think on't, if ye'll send over Elphin, I will help him
hame with them in the gloaming myself. So, Phemie woman, be comforted."

At the mention of her brother's name she cried out, "Where is he? Oh,
where is he?" gazed wildly round, and, shuddering from head to foot,
fell senseless on the floor. Other inhabitants of the valley, alarmed by
the sudden swell of the river, which had augmented to a torrent, deep
and impassable, now came in to inquire if any loss had been sustained,
for numbers of sheep and teds of hay had been observed floating down
about the dawn of the morning. They assisted in reclaiming the unhappy
maiden from her swoon; but insensibility was joy compared to the sorrow
to which she awakened. "They have ta'en him away, they have ta'en him
away," she chanted, in a tone of delirious pathos; "him that was whiter
and fairer than the lily on Lyddal Lee. They have long sought, and they
have long sued, and they had the power to prevail against my prayers at
last. They

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

have ta'en him away; the flower is plucked from among the weeds, and the
dove is slain amid a flock of ravens. They came with shout, and they
came with song, and they spread the charm, and they placed the spell,
and the baptised brow has been bowed down to the unbaptised hand. They
have ta'en him away, they have ta'en him away; he was too lovely, and
too good, and too noble, to bless us with his continuance on earth; for
what are the sons of men compared to him?--the light of the moonbeam to
the morning sun, the glow-worm to the eastern star. They have ta'en him
away, the invisible dwellers of the earth. I saw them come on him with
shouting and with singing, and they charmed him where he sat, and away
they bore him; and the horse he rode was never shod with iron, nor owned
before the mastery of human hand. They have ta'en him away over the
water, and over the wood, and over the hill. I got but ae look of his
bonnie blue ee, but ae, ae look. But as I have endured what never maiden
endured, so will I undertake what never maiden undertook; I will win him
from them all. I know the invisible ones of the earth; I have heard
their wild and wondrous music in the wild woods, and there shall a
christened maiden seek him, and achieve his deliverance." She paused,
and glancing around a circle of condoling faces, down which the tears
were dropping like rain, said, in a calm and altered but still delirious
tone: "Why do you weep, Mary Halliday? and why do you weep, John Graeme?
Ye think that Elphin Irving--oh, it's a

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

bonnie, bonnie name, and dear to many a maiden's heart as well as
mine-ye think he is drowned in Corrie, and ye will seek in the deep,
deep pools for the bonnie, bonnie corse, that ye may weep over it, as it
lies in its last linen, and lay it, amid weeping and wailing, in the
dowie kirkyard. Ye may seek, but ye shall never find; so leave me to
trim up my hair, and prepare my dwelling, and make myself ready to watch
for the hour of his return to upper earth." And she resumed her
household labours with an alacrity which lessened not the sorrow of her
friends.

Meanwhile the rumour flew over the vale that Elphin Irving was drowned
in Corriewater. Matron and maid, old man and young, collected suddenly
along the banks of the river, which now began to subside to its natural
summer limits, and commenced their search; interrupted every now and
then by calling from side to side, and from pool to pool, and by
exclamations of sorrow for this misfortune. The search was fruitless:
five sheep, pertaining to the flock which he conducted to pasture, wore
found drowned in one of the deep eddies; but the river was still too
brown, from the soil of its moorland sources, to enable them to see what
its deep shelves, its pools, and its overhanging and hazely banks
concealed. They remitted further search till the stream should become
pure; and old man taking old man aside, began to whisper about the
mystery of the youth's disappearance; old women laid their lips to the
ears of their coevals, and talked of Elphin Irving's fairy

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

parentage, and his having been dropped by an unearthly hand into a
Christian cradle. The young men and maids conversed on other themes;
they grieved for the loss of the friend and the lover, and while the
former thought that a heart so kind and true was not left in the vale,
the latter thought, as maidens will, on his handsome person, gentle
manners, and merry blue eye, and speculated with a sigh on the time when
they might have hoped a return for their love. They were soon joined by
others who had heard the wild and delirious language of his sister: the
old belief was added to the new assurance, and both again commented upon
by minds full of superstitious feeling, and hearts full of supernatural
fears, till the youths and maidens of Corrievale held no more love
trystes for seven days and nights, lest, like Elphin Irving, they should
be carried away to augment the ranks of the unchristened chivalry.

It was curious to listen to the speculations of the peasantry. "For my
part," said a youth, "if I were sure that poor Elphin escaped from that
perilous water, I would not give the fairies a pound of hiplock wool for
their chance of him. There has not been a fairy seen in the land since
Donald Cargil, the Cameronian, conjured them into the Solway for playing
on their pipes during one of his nocturnal preachings on the hip of the
Burnswick hill."

"Preserve me, bairn," said an old woman, justly exasperated at the
incredulity of her nephew, "if ye winna believe what I both heard and
saw at the moonlight end of Craigyburnwood on a summer night,

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

rank after rank of the fairy folk, ye'll at least believe a douce man
and a ghostly professor, even the late minister of Tinwaldkirk. His only
son--I mind the lad weel, with his long yellow locks and his bonnie blue
eyes--when I was but a gilpie of a lassie, *he* was stolen away from off
the horse at his father's elbow, as they crossed that false and fearsome
water, even Locherbriggflow, on the night of the Midsummer fair of
Dumfries. Ay, ay--who can doubt the truth of that? Have not the godly
inhabitants of Almsfieldtown and Tinwaldkirk seen the sweet youth riding
at midnight, in the midst of the unhallowed troop, to the sound of flute
and of dulcimer, and though meikle they prayed, naebody tried to achieve
his deliverance?"

"I have heard it said by douce folk and sponsible," interrupted another,
"that every seven years the elves and fairies pay kane, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) or make an offering of one of their
children, to the grand enemy of salvation, and that they are permitted
to purloin one of the children of men to present to the fiend--a more
acceptable offering, I'll warrant, than one of their own infernal brood
that are Satan's sib allies, and drink a drop of the deil's blood every
May morning. And touching this lost lad, ye all ken his mother was a
hawk of an uncannie nest, a second cousin of Kate Kimmer, of Barfloshan,
as rank a witch as ever rode on ragwort. Ay, sirs,--what's bred in the
bone is ill to come out of the flesh."

On these and similar topics, which a peasantry

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

full of ancient tradition and enthusiasm and superstition readily
associate with the commonest occurrences of life, the people of
Corrievale continued to converse till the fall of evening, when each,
seeking their home, renewed again the wondrous subject, and illustrated
it with all that popular belief and poetic imagination could so
abundantly supply.

The night which followed this melancholy day was wild with wind and
rain; the river came down broader and deeper than before, and the
lightning, flashing by fits over the green woods of Corrie, showed the
ungovernable and perilous flood sweeping above its banks. It happened
that a farmer, returning from one of the Border fairs, encountered the
full swing of the storm; but mounted on an excellent horse, and mantled
from chin to heel in a good grey plaid, beneath which he had the further
security of a thick great-coat, he sat dry in his saddle, and proceeded
in the anticipated joy of a subsided tempest and a glowing morning sun.
As he entered the long grove, or rather remains of the old Galwegian
forest, which lines for some space the banks of the Corriewater, the
storm began to abate, the wind sighed milder and milder among the trees;
and here and there a star, twinkling momentarily through the sudden rack
of the clouds, showed the river raging from bank to brae. As he shook
the moisture from his clothes, he was not without a wish that the day
would dawn, and that he might be preserved on a road which his
imagination beset with greater perils than the raging river; for his
superstitious feeling let loose

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

upon his path elf and goblin, and the current traditions of the district
supplied very largely to his apprehension the ready materials of fear.

Just as he emerged from the wood, where a fine sloping bank, covered
with short greensward, skirts the limit of the forest, his horse made a
full pause, snorted, trembled, and started from side to side, stooped
his head, erected his ears, and seemed to scrutinise every tree and
bush. The rider, too, it may be imagined, gazed round and round, and
peered warily into every suspicious-looking place. His dread of a
supernatural visitation was not much allayed when he observed a female
shape seated on the ground at the root of a huge old oak-tree, which
stood in the centre of one of those patches of verdant sward, known by
the name of "fairy-rings," and avoided by all peasants who wish to
prosper. A long thin gleam of eastern daylight enabled him to examine
accurately the being who, in this wild place and unusual hour, gave
additional terror to this haunted spot. She was dressed in white from
the neck to the knees; her arms, long and round and white, were
perfectly bare; her head, uncovered, allowed her long hair to descend in
ringlet succeeding ringlet, till the half of her person was nearly
concealed in the fleece. Amidst the whole, her hands were constantly
busy in shedding aside the tresses which interposed between her steady
and uninterrupted gaze down a line of old road which winded among the
hills to an ancient burial-ground.

As the traveller continued to gaze, the figure suddenly

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

rose, and, wringing the rain from her long locks, paced round and round
the tree, chanting in a wild and melancholy manner an equally wild and
delirious song.

THE FAIRY OAK OF CORRIEWATER.

The small bird's head is under its wing,  
  The deer sleeps on the grass;  
The moon comes out, and the stars shine down,  
  The dew gleams like the glass:  
There is no sound in the world so wide,  
  Save the sound of the smitten brass,  
With the merry cittern and the pipe  
  Of the fairies as they pass.  
But oh! the fire maun burn and burn,  
And the hour is gone, and will never return.

The green hill cleaves, and forth, with a bound,  
  Comes elf and elfin steed;  
The moon dives down in a golden cloud,  
  The stars grow dim with dread;  
But a light is running along the earth,  
  So of heaven's they have no need:  
O'er moor and moss with a shout they pass,  
  And the word is spur and speed--  
But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,  
And the hour is gone that will never come back.

And when they came to Craigyburnwood,  
  The Queen of the Fairies spoke:  
Come, bind your steeds to the rushes so green,  
  And dance by the haunted oak:  
I found the acorn on Heshbon Hill,  
  In the nook of a palmer's poke,  
A thousand years since; here it grows!"  
  And they danced till the greenwood shook: <span id="page_332">p.
332</span>  
But oh ! the fire, the burning fire,  
The longer it burns, it but blazes the higher.

"I have won me a youth," the Elf Queen said,  
  "The fairest that earth may see;  
This night I have won young Elph Irving  
  My cupbearer to be.  
His service lasts but for seven sweet years,  
  And his wage is a kiss of me."  
And merrily, merrily, laughed the wild elves  
  Round Corrie's greenwood tree.  
But oh! the fire it glows in my brain,  
And the hour is gone, and comes not again.

The Queen she has whispered a secret word,  
  "Come hither, my Elphin sweet,  
And bring that cup of the charméd wine,  
  Thy lips and mine to meet."  
But a brown elf shouted a loud, loud shout,  
  "Come, leap on your coursers fleet,  
For here comes the smell of of some baptised flesh  
  And the sound of baptised feet."  
But oh! the fire that burns, and maun burn;  
For the time that is gone will never return.

On a steed as white as the new-milked milk,  
  The Elf Queen leaped with a bound,  
And young Elphin a steed like December snow  
  'Neath him at the word he found.  
But a maiden came, and her christened arms  
  She linked her brother around,  
And called on God, and the steed with a snort  
  Sank into the gaping ground.  
But the fire maun burn, and I maun quake,  
And the time that is gone will no more come back.

And she held her brother, and lo! he grow  
  A wild bull waked in ire;  
And she held her brother, and lo! he changed  
  To a river roaring higher; <span id="page_333">p. 333</span>  
And she held her brother, and he became  
  A flood of the raging fire;  
She shrieked and sank, and the wild elves laughed  
  Till the mountain rang and mire.  
But oh I the fire yet burns in my brain,  
And the hour is gone, and comes not again.

"O maiden, why waxed thy faith so faint,  
  Thy spirit so slack and slaw?  
Thy courage kept good till the flame waxed wud, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md)  
  Then thy might began to thaw;  
Had ye kissed him with thy christened lip,  
  Ye had wan him frae 'mang us a'.  
Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,  
  That made thee faint and fa';  
Now bless the fire, the elfin fire,  
The longer it burns it blazes the higher."

At the close of this unusual strain the figure sat down on the grass,
and proceeded to bind up her long and disordered tresses, gazing along
the old and unfrequented road. "Now God be my helper," said the
traveller, who happened to be the laird of Johnstone Bank, "can this be
a trick of the fiend, or can it be bonnie Phemie Irving who chants this
dolorous sang? Something sad has befallen, that makes her seek her seat
in this eerie nook amid the darkness and tempest: through might from
aboon I will go on and see." And the horse, feeling something of the
owner's reviving spirit in the application of spur-steel, bore him at
once to the foot of the tree. The poor delirious maiden uttered a yell
of piercing joy as she beheld him, and, with the swiftness of a creature
winged, linked her arms round the rider's waist, and

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

shrieked till the woods rang. "Oh, I have ye now, Elphin, I have ye
now," and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp. "What
ails ye, my bonnie lass?" said the laird of Johnstone Bank, his fears of
the supernatural vanishing when he beheld her sad and bewildered look.
She raised her eyes at the sound, and, seeing a strange face, her arms
slipped their hold, and she dropped with a groan on the ground.

The morning had now fairly broke: the flocks shook the rain from their
sides, the shepherds hastened to inspect their charges, and a thin blue
smoke began to stream from the cottages of the valley into the
brightening air. The laird carried Phemie Irving in his arms, till he
observed two shepherds ascending from one of the loops of Corriewater,
bearing the lifeless body of her brother. They had found him whirling
round and round in one of the numerous eddies, and his bands, clutched
and filled with wool, showed that he had lost his life in attempting to
save the flock of his sister. A plaid was laid over the body, which,
along with the unhappy maiden in a half-lifeless state, was carried into
a cottage, and laid in that apartment distinguished among the peasantry
by the name of the chamber. While the peasant's wife was left to take
care of Phemie, old man and matron and maid had collected around the
drowned youth, and each began to relate the circumstances of his death,
when the door suddenly opened, and his sister, advancing to the corpse
with a look of delirious serenity, broke--out into a wild laugh and

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

said: "Oh, it is wonderful, it's truly wonderful! That bare and
death-cold body, dragged from the darkest pool of Corrie, with its hands
filled with fine wool, wears the perfect similitude of my own Elphin!
I'll tell ye--the spiritual dwellers of the earth, the fairy-folk of our
evening tale, have stolen the living body, and fashioned this cold and
inanimate clod to mislead your pursuit. In common eyes this seems all
that Elphin Irving would be, had he sunk in Corriewater; but so it seems
not to me. Ye have sought the living soul, and ye have found only its
garment. But oh, if ye had beheld him, as I beheld him tonight, riding
among the elfin troop, the fairest of them all; had you clasped him in
your arms, and wrestled for him with spirits and terrible shapes from
the other world, till your heart quailed and your flesh was subdued,
then would ye yield no credit to the semblance which this cold and
apparent flesh bears to my brother. But hearken! On Hallowmass Eve, when
the spiritual people are let loose on earth for a season, I will take my
stand in the burial-ground of Corrie; and when my Elphin and his
unchristened troop come past, with the sound of all their minstrelsy, I
will leap on him and win him, or perish for ever."

All gazed aghast on the delirious maiden, and many of her auditors gave
more credence to her distempered speech than to the visible evidence
before them. As she turned to depart, she looked round, and suddenly
sunk upon the body, with tears streaming from her eyes, and sobbed out,
"My brother! oh, my

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

brother!" She was carried out insensible, and again recovered; but
relapsed into her ordinary delirium, in which she continued till the
Hallow Eve after her brother's burial. She was found seated in the
ancient burial-ground, her back against a broken gravestone, her locks
white with frost-rime, watching with intensity of look the road to the
kirkyard; but the spirit which gave life to the fairest form of all the
maids of Annandale was fled for ever.

Such is the singular story which the peasants know by the name of
"Elphin Irving, the Fairies' Cupbearer;" and the title, in its fullest
and most supernatural sense, still obtains credence among the
industrious and virtuous dames of the romantic vale of Corrie.
