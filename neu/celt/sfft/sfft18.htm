<p>A FOX one day met a cock, and they began talking.</p>  
<p>"How many tricks canst thou do?" said the fox.</p>  
<p>"Well," said the cock, "I could do three; how many canst thou do thyself?"</p>  
<p>"I could do three score and thirteen," said the fox.</p>  
<p>What tricks canst thou do?" said the cock.</p>  
<p>"Well," said the fox, "my grandfather used to shut one eye and give a great shout."</p>  
<p>"I could do that myself," said the cock.</p>  
<p>"Do it," said the fox. And the cock shut one eye and crowed as loud as ever he could, but he shut the eye that was next the fox, and the fox gripped him by the neck and ran away with him. But the wife to whom the cock belonged saw him and cried out,</p>  
<p>"Let go the cock; he's mine."</p>  
<p>"Say thou, SE MO CHOILEACH FHEIN A TH' ANN" (it is my own cock), said the cock to the fox.</p>  
<p>Then the fox opened his mouth to say as the cock did, and he dropped the cock, and he sprung up on the top of a house, and shut one eye and gave a loud crow; and that's all there is of that sgeulachd.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
