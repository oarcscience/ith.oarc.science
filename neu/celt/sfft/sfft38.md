in pulling heather upon Peatlaw, a hill in Selkirkshire, had tired of
his labour, and laid him down to sleep upon a fairy ring. When he
awakened, he was amazed to find himself in the midst of a populous city,
to which, as well as to the means of his transportation, he was an utter
stranger. His coat was left upon the Peatlaw; and his bonnet, which had
fallen off in the course of his aërial journey, was afterwards found
hanging upon the steeple of the church of Lanark. The distress of the
poor man was, in some degree, relieved by meeting a carrier, whom he had
formerly known, and who conducted him back to Selkirk, by a slower
conveyance than had whirled him to Glasgow. That he had been carried off
by the fairies was implicitly believed by all who did not reflect that a
man may have private reasons for leaving his own country, and for
disguising his having intentionally done so.
