### THE FISHERMAN AND THE MERMAN. <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)

OF mermen and merwomen many strange stories are told in the Shetland
Isles. Beneath the depths of the ocean, according to these stories, an
atmosphere exists adapted to the respiratory organs of certain beings,
resembling in form the human race, possessed of surpassing beauty, of
limited supernatural powers, and liable to the incident of death. They
dwell in a wide territory of the globe, far below the region of fishes,
over which the sea, like the cloudy canopy of our sky, loftily rolls,
and they possess habitations constructed of the pearl and coral
productions of the ocean. Having lungs not adapted to a watery medium,
but to the nature of atmospheric air, it would be impossible for them to
pass through the volume of waters that intervenes between the submarine
and supramarine world, if it were not for the extraordinary power they
inherit of entering the skin of some animal capable of existing in the
sea, which they are enabled to occupy by a sort of demoniacal
possession. One shape they put on is that of an animal human above the
waist, yet terminating below in the tail and fins of a fish, but the
most favourite form is that of the larger seal or Haaf-fish; for, in
possessing an amphibious nature, they are enabled not only to exist in
the ocean, but to land on some rock, where they frequently lighten
themselves of their sea-dress, resume their proper shape, and with much
curiosity

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

examine the nature of the upper world belonging to the human race.
Unfortunately, however, each merman or merwoman possesses but one skin,
enabling the individual to ascend the seas, and if, on visiting the
abode of man, the garb be lost, the hapless being must unavoidably
become an inhabitant of the earth.

A story is told of a boat's crew who landed for the purpose of attacking
the seals lying in the hollows of the crags at one of the stacks. The
men stunned a number of the animals, and while they were in this state
stripped them of their skins, with the fat attached to them. Leaving the
carcases on the rock, the crew were about to set off for the shore of
Papa Stour, when such a tremendous swell arose that every one flew
quickly to the boat. All succeeded in entering it except one man, who
had imprudently lingered behind. The crew were unwilling to leave a
companion to perish on the skerries, <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)
but the surge increased so fast that after many unsuccessful attempts to
bring the boat close in to the stack the unfortunate wight was left to
his fate. A stormy night came on, and the deserted Shetlander saw no
prospect before him but that of perishing from cold and hunger, or of
being washed into the sea by the breakers which threatened to dash over
the rocks. At length he perceived many of the seals, who in their flight
had escaped the attack of the boatmen, approach the skerry, disrobe
themselves of their amphibious hides, and resume the shape of the sons
and daughters of the ocean. Their first object was to assist in the
recovery

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

of their friends, who, having been stunned by clubs, had, while in that
state, been deprived of their skins. When the flayed animals had
regained their sensibility, they assumed their proper form of mermen or
merwomen, and began to lament in a mournful lay, wildly accompanied by
the storm that was raging around, the loss of their sea-dress, which
would prevent them from again enjoying their native azure atmosphere and
coral mansions that lay below the deep waters of the Atlantic. But their
chief lamentation was for Ollavitinus, the son of Gioga, who, having
been stripped of his seal's skin, would be for ever parted from his
mates, and condemned to become an outcast inhabitant of the upper world.
Their song was at length broken off by observing one of their enemies
viewing, with shivering limbs and looks of comfortless despair, the wild
waves that dashed over the stack. Gioga immediately conceived the idea
of rendering subservient to the advantage of her son the perilous
situation of the man. She addressed him with mildness, proposing to
carry him safe on her back across the sea to Papa Stour, on condition of
receiving the seal-skin of Ollavitinus. A bargain was struck, and Gioga
clad herself in her amphibious garb; but the Shetlander, alarmed at the
sight of the stormy main that he was to ride through, prudently begged
leave of the matron, for his better preservation, that he might be
allowed to cut a few holes in her shoulders and flanks, in order to
procure, between the skin and the flesh, a better, fastening for his
hands and feet. The request being complied

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

with, the man grasped the neck of the seal, and committing himself to
her care, she landed him safely at Acres Gio in Papa Stour; from which
place he immediately repaired to a skeo <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) at Hamna Voe, where the skin was
deposited, and honourably fulfilled his part of the contract by
affording Gioga the means whereby her son could again revisit the
ethereal space over which the sea spread its green mantle.
