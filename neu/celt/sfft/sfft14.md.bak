### THE FOX TROUBLED WITH FLEAS.

The fox is much troubled by fleas, and this is the way in which he gets
rid of them. He hunts about till he finds a lock of wool, and then he
takes it to the river, and holds it in his mouth, and so puts the end of
his brush into the water, and down he goes slowly. The fleas run away
from the water, and at last they all run over the fox's nose into the
wool, and then the fox dips his nose under and lets the wool go off with
the stream. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)
