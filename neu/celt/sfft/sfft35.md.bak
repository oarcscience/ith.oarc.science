### SANNTRAIGH. <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md)

THERE was a herd's wife in the island of Sanntraigh, and she had a
kettle. A woman of peace would come every day to seek the kettle. She
would not say a word when she came, but she would catch hold of the
kettle. When she would catch the kettle, the woman of the house would
say--

"A smith is able to make  
Cold iron hot with coal.  
The due of a kettle is bones,  
And to bring it back again whole."

The woman of peace would come back every day with the kettle, and flesh
and bones in it. On a day that was there, the housewife was for going
over the ferry to Baile a Chaisteil, and she said to her man, "if thou
wilt say to the woman of peace as I say, I will go to Baile Castle."
"Oo! I will say it. Surely it's I that will say it." He was spinning a
heather rope to

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

be set on the house. He saw a woman coming and a shadow from her feet,
and he took fear of her. He shut the door. He stopped his work. When she
came to the door she did not find the door open, and he did not open it
for her. She went above a bole that was in the house. The kettle gave
two jumps, and at the third leap it went out at the ridge of the house.
The night came, and the kettle came not. The wife came back over the
ferry, and she did not see a bit of the kettle within, and she asked,
"Where was the kettle?" "Well, then, I don't care where it is," said the
man; "I never took such a fright as I took at it. I shut the door, and
she did not come any more with it." "Good-for-nothing wretch, what didst
thou do? There are two that will be ill off--thyself and I." "She will
come to-morrow with it." "She will not come."

She hasted herself and she went away. She reached the knoll, and there
was no man within. It was after dinner, and they were out in the mouth
of the night. She went in. She saw the kettle, and she lifted it with
her. It was heavy for her with the remnants that they left in it. When
the old carle that was within saw her going out, he said--

Silent wife, silent wife,  
That came on us from the land of chase,  
Thou man on the surface of the 'Bruth,'  
Loose the black, and slip the Fierce."

The two dogs were let loose; and she was not long away when she heard
the clatter of the dogs coming.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> She kept the
remnant that was in the kettle, so that if she could get it with her,
well, and if the dogs should come that she might throw it at them. She
perceived the dogs coming. She put her hand in the kettle. She took the
board out of it, and she threw at them a quarter of what was in it. They
noticed it there for a while. She perceived them again, and she threw
another piece at them when they closed upon her. She went away walking
as well as she might; when she came near the farm, she threw the mouth
of the pot downwards, and there she left them all that was in it. The
dogs of the town struck up a barking when they saw the dogs of peace
stopping. The woman of peace never came more to seek the kettle.
