### DEVONSHIRE.

The same is true of Devonshire. In May 1860 I was told that many of the
farmers "are so superstitious as to believe in PISKIES;" they are "never
seen, but they are often heard laughing at people in the dark, and they
lead them away." My informant said that when he was young he used to
hear so many stories about piskies from the old women about the
fireside, that he used to be frightened to go out at night.

"When the young colts are out running wild, their manes get rough and
hang down on both sides, and get tangled with the wind like; not like
manes of horses that are well kept (here the speaker pointed with his
whip at the sleek pair which he was driving); and when the farmers find
stirrups like in the hair of the mane, they say the piskies has been a
ridin' of them."
