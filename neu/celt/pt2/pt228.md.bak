### XXXVI.

#### MAGHACH COLGAR.

From Alexander MacNeill, Barra.

FIONN, the son of Cumal. FIONN MAC CUMHAIL was in Eirinn, and the king
of Lochlann in Lochlann. The king of Lochlann sent MAGHACH COLGAR to
Fionn to be taught. The king of the SEALG sent to him his own son, whom
they called INNSRIDH MACRIGH NAN SEALG. They were of age, six years
(and) ten. Then they were in Erin with Fionn, and Fionn taught Maghach,
son of the king of Lochlann, every learning he had.

There came a message from the king of Lochlann, that he was in the
sickness of death for leaving the world; and that the Maghach must go
home to be ready for his crowning. Maghach went away, and the chase
failed with the FEINN, and they did not know what they should do.

Maghach wrote a letter to Fionn from Lochlann to Eirinn: "I heard that
the chase failed with you in Eirinn. I have burghs on sea, and I have
burghs on shore: I have food for a day and a year in every burgh of
these--the meat thou thinkest not of, and the drink thou thinkest not
of; come thou hither thyself and thy set of FIANTACHAN. The keep of a
day and a year is on thy head."

Fionn got the letter, and he opened it: "He is

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

pitiable who would not do a good thing in the beginning of youth; he
might get a good share of it again in the beginning of his age. Here is
a letter came from my foster-son from Lochlann that he has burghs on sea
and burghs on shore, food for a day and a year in every one of them--the
drink that we can think of, and the drink that we do not think of; the
meat we can think of, and the meat that we do not think of--and it is
best for us to be going."

"Whom shall we leave," said FIACHERE MACFHINN (the trier son of Fionn)
his son, "to keep the darlings and little sons of Eireann."

"I will stay," said FIACHERE MACFHINN.

"I will stay," said DIARMID O'DUIBHNE, his sister's son.

"I will stay," said INNSRIDH MACRIGH NAN SEALG, his foster-son.

"I will stay," said CATH CONAN MAC MHIC CON.

"We will stay now," said they--the four.

"Thou art going, my father," said Fiachere, "and it is as well for thee
to stay; how then shall we get word how it befalls thee in Lochlainn?"

"I will strike the ORD FIANNT (hammer of Fiant) in Lochlainn, and it
will be known by the blow I strike in Lochlainn, or in Eirinn, how we
shall be."

Fionn and his company went, they reached Lochlainn. Maghach Colgar, son
of the king of Lochlainn, went before to meet them.

"Hail to thee, my foster father," said Maghach.

"Hail to thyself, my foster-son," said Fionn.

"There is the business I had with thee; I heard that the chase had
failed in Eirinn, and it was not well with me to let you die without
meat. I have burghs on sea and burghs on shore, and food for a day and

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

year in every one of them, and which kind wouldst thou rather choose?"

"It is on shore I used to always be, and it is not on sea; and I will
take some on shore," said Fionn.

They went into one of them. There was a door opposite to every day in
the year on the house; every sort of drink and meat within it. They sat
on chairs; they caught every man hold of a fork and of a knife, They
gave a glance from them, and what should they see in the "araich" (great
half-ruined building), but not a hole open but frozen rime. They gave
themselves that lift to rise. The chairs stuck to the earth. They
themselves stuck to the chairs. Their hands stuck to the knives, and
there was no way of rising out of that.

It was day about that Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg
were going to keep the chase, and Diarmid O'Duibhne and Conan were going
on the other day. On their returning back, what should they hear but a
blow of the hammer of Fionn being struck in Lochlainn.

"If he has wandered the universe and the world, my foster-father is in
pledge of his body and soul."

Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went from Eirinn, and
they reached Lochlainn.

"Who is that without on the burgh?"

"I am," said Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg.

"Who is there on the place of combat?"

"There are two hundred score of the GREUGACHAIBH (Greeks) come out and
great IALL at their head coming to seek my head to be his at his great
meal to morrow."

Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went and they reached
the place of combat.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

"Where are ye going? " said Fiachaire MacFhinn.

"We are going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail to be ours at our great
meal to-morrow."

"It is often that man's head might be sought and be on my own breast at
early morning."

"Close up," said Iall, "and leave way for the people."

"There is a small delay on that," said Fiachaire.

Fiachaire, son of Fhinn, pressed out on the one end of them. Innsridh,
son of the king of the Sealg, began in the other end, till the two
glaves clashed against each other. They returned, and they reached the
burgh.

said Fionn.

"With me," said Fiachaire, "and with the son of the king of the Sealg."

"How was my foster-son off there?"

"Man upon man," said Fiachaire. "And if he had not another man, he had
lacked none."

"Over the field, to my foster-son," said Fionn; "and his bones but soft
yet! but mind the place of combat. Yonder are three hundred score of the
Greeks coming out seeking my head to be theirs at their great meal
tomorrow."

Fiachaire MacFhinn, and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went, and they
reached the place of combat.

"Where are you going?" said Fiachaire MacFhinn.

"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail to be ours at our great meal
to-morrow."

"It's often that very man's head might be sought, and be on my own
breast at early morning."

"Close up and leave way for the people."

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

"There is still a small delay on that."

Fiachaire began in the one end of the company, and Innsridh MacRigh nan
Sealg in the other, till the two glaves clashed on each other. They
returned to the burgh.

"Who is that?" said Fionn.

"I am Fiachaire, thy son, and Innsridh, son of the king of the Sealg,
thy foster son,

With whom was the hideous fight  
That was on the battle place (battle ford)  
                   To-day.

\[paragraph continues\] It was with me and with three hundred score of
Greeks."

"Mind the place of battle; there are four hundred score of the Greeks,
and a great warrior at their head coming to seek my head to be theirs at
their great meal to-morrow."

They went and they reached the place of battle.

"Where are you going?" said Fiachaire MacFhinn to the Greeks.

"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail, to be ours at our great meal
to-morrow."

"It's often that man's head might be sought, and be on my own breast at
early morning."

"Close up from the way, and leave way for the people."

"There is a small delay on that yet."

He himself and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg began at them till they had
killed every man of them, and till the two glaves clashed on each other.
They returned home, and they reached the burgh.

"Who's that without?" said Fionn.

"I am Fiachaire, thy son, and Innsridh, son of the king of the Sealg,
thy foster-son,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

With whom was the hideous fight  
That was at the battle place (ford)  
                   To-day."

"It was with me and so many of the Greeks."

"How was my foster-son off there?"

"Man upon man, and if there had been no one besides, he had lacked
none."

"Mind the place of battle. There are twice as many as came out, a good
and heedless warrior at their head, coming to seek my head, to be theirs
at their great meal to-morrow."

They reached the place of battle; and when they reached it, there came
not a man of the people.

"I won't believe," said Fiachaire MacFhinn, "that there are not remnants
of meat in a place whence such bands are coming. Hunger is on myself,
and that we ate but a morsel since we ate it in Eirinn. And come thou,
Innsridh, and reach the place where they were. They will not know man
from another man, and try if thou canst get scraps of bread, and of
cheese, and of flesh, that thou wilt bring to us; and I myself will stay
to keep the people, in case that they should come unawares."

"Well, then, I know not the place. I know not the way," said Innsridh,
son of the king of Sealg, "but go thyself and I will stay."

Fiachaire went, and Innsridh staid, and what should they do but come
unawares.

"Where are ye going," said Innsridh?

"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail, to be ours at our great meal
to-morrow."

"It is often that man's head might be sought, and be on my own breast at
early morning."

"Close up, and leave way for the people

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

"There is a small delay on that yet." Innsridh began at them, and he
left not one alone.

"What good did it do thee to slay the people, and that I will kill
thee," said the great warrior at their head.

"If I had come out, from my meat and from my warmth, from my warmth and
from my fire, thou shouldst not kill me." He and the warrior began at
each other. They would make a bog of the crag, and a crag of the bog, in
the place where the least they would sink they would sink to the knees,
in the place that the most they would sink they would sink to the eyes.
The great warrior gave a sweep with his glave, and he cut the head off
Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg.

Fiachaire came. The warrior met him, and with him was the head of
Innsridh.

Said Fiachaire to the great warrior, "What thing hast thou there?"

"I have here the head of Mhic Cumhail."

"Hand it to me."

He reached him the head. Fiachaire gave a kiss to the mouth, and a kiss
to the back of the head.

"Dost thou know to whom thou gavest it?" said Fiachaire to the warrior.

"I do not," said he. "It well became the body on which it was before."

He went and he drew back the head, and strikes it on the warrior's head
while he was speaking, and makes one head of the two. He went and he
reached (the place) where Fionn was again.

"Who is that without?" said Fionn.

"I am Fiachaire, thy son,

With whom was the hideous fight  
That was at the battle place  
                  To-day."

 

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

"It was with Innsridh, thy foster-son, and with the Greeks."

"How is my foster-son from that?"

"He is dead without a soul. Thy foster-son killed the Greeks first, and
the great Greek killed him afterwards, and then I killed the great
Greek."

"Mind the place of combat. There is Maghach, son of the king of
Lochlann, and every one that was in the Greek burgh with him."

He went and he reached the place of combat.

"Thou art there, Fiachaire?" said Maghach Colgar.

"I am."

"Let hither thy father's head, and I will give thee a free bridge in
Lochlainn."

"My father gave thee school and teaching, and every kind of DRAOCHD
(Magic) he had, and though he taught that, thou wouldst take the head
off him now, and with that thou shalt not get my father's head, until
thou gettest my own head first."

Fiachaire began at the people, and he killed every man of the people.

"Thou has killed the people," said Maghach, "and I will kill thee."

They began at each other.

They would make a bog of the crag, and a crag of the bog, in the place
where the least they would sink they would sink to the knees; in the
place where the most they would sink, they would sink to the eyes. On a
time of the times the spear of Mhaghach struck Fiachaire, and he gave a
roar. What time should he give the roar but when Diarmid was turning
step from the chase in Eirinn.

"If he has travelled the universe and the world,"

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

said Diarmid, "the spear of the Maghach is endured by Fiachaire."

"Wailing be on thee," said Conan. "Cast thy spear and hit thy foe."

"If I cast my spear, I know not but I may kill my own man."

"If it were a yellow-haired woman, well wouldst thou aim at her."

"Wailing be on thee now; urge me no longer."

He shook the spear, and struck under the shield (chromastaich).

"Who would come on me from behind in the evening, that would not come on
me from the front in the morning?" said Maghach.

"’Tis I would come on thee," said Diarmid, "early and late, and at
noon."

"What good is that to thee," said Maghach, "and that I will take the
head off Fiachaire before thou comest."

"If thou takest the head off him," said Diarmid, "I will take off thy
head when I reach thee."

Diarmid reached Lochlann. Maghach took the head off Fiachaire. Diarmid
took the head off the Maghach. Diarmid reached Fionn.

"Who's that without?" said Fionn.

"It is I, Diarmid,

With whom was the hideous fight  
That was on the battle place  
                   To-day."

"It was with so many of the Greeks, and with [the](errata.htm#1.md)
Maghach, son of the king of Lochlann, and with Fiachaire, thy son;
Fiachaire killed all the Greeks, Maghach killed Fiachaire, and then I
killed Maghach."

"Though Maghach killed Fiachaire, why didst thou

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

kill Maghach, and not let him have his life? But mind the place of
combat, and all that are in the burghs of the Greeks coming out
together."

"Whether wouldst thou rather, Cath Conan, go with me or stay here?"

"I would rather go with thee."

They went, and when they reached the place of combat, no man met them.
They reached where they were; they sat there, and what should Cath Conan
do but fall asleep, they were so long coming out. It was not long after
that till they began to come, and the doors to open. There was a door
before every day in the year on every burgh, so that they burst forth
all together about the head of Diarmid. Diarmid began at them, and with
the sound of the glaves and return of the men, Cath Conan awoke, and he
began thrusting his sword in the middle of the leg of Diarmid. Then
Diarmid felt a tickling in the middle of his leg. He cast a glance from
him, and what should he see but Cath Conan working with his own sword.

"Wailing be on thee, Cath Conan," said Diarmid; "pass by thy own man and
hit thy foe, for it is as well for thee to thrust it into yonder
bundle <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) as to be cramming it into my
leg. Do not thou plague me now till I hit my foe!"

They killed every man of the people.

They thought of those who were in the burgh, and they without food; each
one of them took with him the full of his napkin, and his breast, and
his pouches.

"Who's that without?" said Fionn.

"I am Diarmid, thy sister's son."

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

"How are the Greeks?"

"Every man of them is dead, without a soul."

"Oh, come and bring hither to me a deliverance of food."

"Though I should give thee food, how shouldst thou eat it, and thou
there and thee bound?"

He had no way of giving them food, but to make a hole in the burgh above
them, and let the food down to them.

"What is there to loose thee from that said Diarmid.

"Well, that is hard to get," said Fionn; "and it is not every man that
will get it; and it is not to be got at all."

"Tell thou me," said Diarmid, "and I will get it."

"I know that thou wilt subdue the world till thou gettest it; and my
healing is not to be got, nor my loosing from this, but with the one
thing."

"What thing is it that thou shouldst not tell it to me, and that I might
get it?"

"The three daughters of a king, whom they call King Gil; the daughters
are in a castle in the midst of an anchorage, without maid, without
sgalag (servant), without a living man but themselves. To get them, and
to wring every drop of blood that is in them out on plates and in cups;
to take every drop of blood out of them, and to leave them as white as
linen."

Diarmid went, and he was going till there were holes in his shoes and
black on his soles, the white clouds of day going, and the black clouds
of night coming, without finding a place to stay or rest in. He reached
the anchorage, and he put the small end of his spear under his chest,
and he cut a leap, and he was in the castle that night. On the morrow he
returned, and he took

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

with him two on the one shoulder and one on the other shoulder; he put
the small end of his spear under his chest, and at the first spring he
was on shore. He reached Fionn; he took the girls to him; he wrung every
drop of blood that was in every one of them out at the finger ends of
her feet and bands; he put a black cloth above them, and he began to
spill the blood on those who were within, and every one as he spilt the
blood on him, he would rise and go. The blood failed, and every one was
loosed but one, whom they called Conan.

"Art thou about to leave me here, oh Diarmid."

"Wailing be on thee; the blood has failed."

"If I were a fine yellow-haired woman, its well thou wouldst aim at me?"

"If thy skin stick to thyself, or thy bones to thy flesh, I will take
thee out."

He caught him by the hand and he got him loose, but that his skin stuck
to the seat, and the skin of his soles to the earth. "It were well now,"
said they, "if the children of the good king were alive, but they should
be buried under the earth." They went where they were, and they found
them laughing and fondling each other, and alive. Diarmid went, and took
them with him on the shower top of his shoulder, and he left them in the
castle as they were before, and they all came home to EIRINN.

Got this tale from Alexander MacNeill, fisherman, then Tangval, Barra;
says he learnt it from his father, and that he

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

heard it recited by him and others ever since he remembers; says it has
been handed down orally from one person to another from time immemorial.
MacNeill is about sixty years of age, and can neither read, write, nor
speak English. His father died twenty years ago, aged eighty years.

     Barra, July 1859.

 

I know nothing like this anywhere out of the Highlands, but I have heard
similar wild rambling stories there all my life.

The heroes are the heroes of Ossian, with the characters always assigned
to them in Gaelic story. Fionn, the head of the band, but not the most
successful; Diarmaid, the brown-haired admirer of the fair sex; Conan,
the wicked, mischievous character, who would be the clown in a
pantomime, or Loki in Norse mythology. They are enchanted in a BRUGH,
which I have translated burgh, on the authority of Armstrong; and they
fight crowds of Greeks on a place, if it be A for AITE; or at a ford, if
it be ATH, which is pronounced in the same way. Greeks, GREUGACHIBH, may
possibly be GRUAGACH-ibh, the long-haired people mentioned in the first
story, changed into Greeks in modern times; or "GRUAGACH" may be a
corruption from "Greugach," and this story compounded by some old bard
from all the knowledge he had gathered, including Greeks, just as the
fore-word to the Edda is compounded of Tyrkland, and Troja, and Odin,
and Thor, the Asia men and the Asa, and all that the writer knew. The
story as told is extravagant. Men in Eirinn and in Lochlainn, Ireland,
and Scandinavia, converse and throw spears at each other. The hammer of
Fionn is heard in Ireland when struck in Lochlan. But one of the
manuscripts in the Advocates' Library throws some light on this part of
the tale. If the scene were an island in the Shannon, men might converse
and fight in the ford well enough. The MS. is a quarto on paper, with no
date, containing five tales in prose, a vocabulary, and poems, and is
attributed to the twelfth century. "Keating considers the subject of
Tale 2, which contains forty-two pages, as authentic history." One of
the people mentioned is Aol or Æul, a son of Donald, king of Scotland,
who is probably "Great Iall," unless Iall is Iarl, an Earl. Tale 3 sends
Cuchullin first to Scotland to learn feats of agility from Doiream,
daughter of King Donald, thence to Scythia, where a seminary is crowded
with pupils from Asia,

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Africa, and Europe. He beats them all, goes
through wonderful adventures, goes to Greece, returns with certain Irish
chiefs, arrives in Ireland, and is followed by his son, a half Scythian,
whom be kills at a ford. No. 4, the story of the children of Lir,
changed into swans, is very curious.

No. 5 is called the rebellion Of MIODACH, son of COLGAR, against Fingal,
and seems to resemble Maghach Colgar.

Colgar, king of Lochlin, proposes to assume the title of Sovereign of
the Isles, and to subjugate Ireland. He is beaten by Fingal, who gives
him a residence *in an island in the Shannon*. After eighteen years he
comes to propose riddles to Fingal, and invites him to an entertainment.
They, the Fingalians, go, and *are enchanted*, sing their own dirge, are
overheard by a friend sent by Ossian. *Some Greek Earls* (Gaelic, Iarla)
appear, and there is a great deal of fighting. Ossian dispatches DIARMAD
O DUIBHNE and FATHACH CANNACH, who *guard a ford* and perform feats.
Oscar, son of Ossian, performs prodigies of valour, and kills Sinnsir.

This abstract of an abstract, lent me by Mr. Skene, is sufficient to
shew that this old manuscript tale still exists in fragments, as
tradition, amongst the people of the Isles.

The transcriber who copied it into the Roman hand in 1813, considers the
MS. to be written in very pure Gaelic. It is referred to the twelfth or
thirteenth century, is characterized by exuberant diction, groups of
poetical adjectives, each beginning with the same letter as the
substantive. In short, Tale 5 seems to be a much longer, better, and
older [version](errata.htm#2.md) of the tale of Maghach Colgar. The
transcriber makes a kind of apology for the want of truth in these tales
at the end of his abstract. He was probably impressed with the idea that
Ossian and his heroes sang and fought in Scotland, and that Uirsgeul
meant a *new* tale or novel, unworthy of notice. My opinion is that the
prose tales and the poems, and this especially, are alike old
compositions, founded on old traditions common to all Celts, and perhaps
to all Indo-European races, but altered and ornamented, and twisted into
compositions by bards and reciters of all ages, and every branch of the
race; altered to suit the time and place--adorned with any ornament that
the bard or reciter had at his disposal; and now a mere remnant of the
past.

It is a great pity that these MSS. in the Advocates' Library

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

are still unpublished. They could not fail to throw light on the period
when they were written.

It is remarkable that the so-called Greeks in this story seem to want
the head of Fionn for dinner.
