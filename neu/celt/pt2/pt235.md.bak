### XLIII.

### THE SHARP GREY SHEEP.

From John Dewar, labourer, Glendaruail, Cowal.

THERE was a king and a queen, and they had a daughter, and the queen
found death, and the king married another. And the last queen was bad to
the daughter of the first queen, and she used to beat her and put her
out of the door. She sent her to herd the sheep, and was not giving her
what should suffice her. And there was a sharp (horned) grey sheep in
the flock that was coming with meat to her.

The queen was taking wonder that she was keeping alive and that she was
not getting meat enough from herself, and she told it to the henwife.
The henwife thought that she would send her own daughter to watch how
she was getting meat, and Ni Mhaol Charach, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) the henwife's daughter, went to herd the
sheep with the queen's daughter. The sheep would not come to her so long
as Ni Mhaol Charach wag there, and Ni Mhaol Charach was staying all the
day with her. The queen's daughter was longing for her meat, and she
said--"Set thy head on my knee and I will dress thy hair." <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) And Ni Mhaol Charach set her head on the
knee of the queen's daughter, and she slept.

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

The sheep came with meat to the queen's daughter, but the eye that was
in the back of the head of the bald black-skinned girl, the henwife's
daughter, was open, and she saw all that went on, and when she awoke she
went home and told it to her mother, and the henwife told it to the
queen, and when the queen understood how the girl was getting meat,
nothing at all would serve her but that the sheep should be killed.

The sheep came to the queen's daughter and said to her--

"They are going to kill me, but steal thou my skin and gather my bones
and roll them in my skin, and I will come alive again, and I will come
to thee again."

The sheep was killed, and the queen's daughter stole her skin, and she
gathered her bones and her hoofs and she rolled them in the skin; but
she forgot the little hoofs. The sheep came alive again, but she was
lame. She came to the king's daughter with a halting step, and she said,
"Thou didst as I desired thee, but thou hast forgotten the little
hoofs."

And she was keeping her in meat after that.

There was a young prince who was hunting and coming often past her, and
he saw how pretty she was, and he asked, "Who's she?" And they told him,
and he took love for her, and he was often coming the way; but the bald
black-skinned girl, the henwife's daughter, took notice of him, and she
told it to her mother, and the henwife told it to the queen.

The queen was wishful to get knowledge what man it was, and the henwife
sought till she found out who he (was), and she told the queen. When the
queen heard who it was she was wishful to send her own daughter in his
way, and she brought in the first queen's daughter, and she sent her own
daughter to herd in her

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

place, and she was making the daughter of the first queen do the cooking
and every service about the house.

The first queen's daughter was out a turn, and the prince met her, and
he gave her a pair of golden shoes. And he was wishful to see her at the
sermon, but her muime would not let her go there.

But when the rest would go she would make ready, and she would go after
them, and she would sit where he might see her, but she would rise and
go before the people would scatter, and she would be at the house and
everything in order before her muime would come. But the third time she
was there the prince was wishful to go with her, and he sat near to the
door, and when she went he was keeping an eye on her, and he rose and
went after her. She was running home, and she lost one of her shoes in
the mud; and he got the shoe, and because he could not see her he said
that the one who had the foot that would fit the shoe was the wife that
would be his.

The queen was wishful that the shoe would fit her own daughter, and she
put the daughter of the first queen in hiding, so that she should not be
seen till she should try if the shoe should fit her own daughter.

When the prince came to try the shoe on her, her foot was too big, but
she was very anxious that the shoe should fit her, and she spoke to the
henwife about it. The henwife cut the points of her toes off that the
shoe might fit her, and the shoe went on her when the points of the toes
were cut.

When the wedding-day came the daughter of the first queen was set in
hiding in a nook that was behind the fire.

When the people were all gathered together, a bird came to the window,
and he cried--

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

"The blood's in the shoe, and the pretty foot's in the nook at the back
of the fire." <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

One of them said, "What is that creature saying?"

And the queen said--"It's no matter what that creature is saying; it is
but a nasty, beaky, lying creature." The bird came again to the window;
and the third time he came, the prince said--"We will go and see what he
is saying."

And he rose and he went out, and the bird cried--

"The blood's in the shoe, and the pretty foot's in the nook that is at
the back of the fire."

He returned in, and he ordered the nook at the back of the fire to be
searched. And they searched it, and they found the first queen's
daughter there, and the golden shoe on the one foot. They cleaned the
blood out of the other shoe, and they tried it on her, and the shoe
fitted her, and its like was on the other foot. The prince left the
daughter of the last queen, and he married the daughter of the first
queen, and he took her from them with him, and she was rich and lucky
after that.

"He has an eye in the back of his head," is a common saying for some one
preternaturally sharp.

This story has some resemblance to Argus, who had a hundred eyes, and
slept with two at a time; and was set by Juno (a queen) to watch Io, a
human being changed into a heifer.

The sheep that came alive and was lame, is like Norse mythology
(*Edda*--Dasent's translation, p. 51). "Thorr took his he goats and
killed them both, and after that they were flain and borne to the
kettle. . . . Then laid Thorr the goatskins away from the fire, and told
the husband and his household they should cast the bones into the
goatskins. . . . Thor . . hallowed the goatskins, then stood up the
goats, and one of them was halt in one of his hind feet."

One of the people had broken the thigh for the marrow.

I know nothing in any story quite like the first part, but it is like
Cinderella (Grimm, English, p. 81), where the birds and the shoe appear;
but with a wholly different set of incidents. It is like One Eye, Two
Eyes, and Three Eyes (p. 387); but in that story the church and the
golden shoe do not appear.

See Grimm, vol. iii., p. 34, for numerous references to versions of
Cinderella in books of all ages.

It has some resemblance to Bellin the Ram of the Countess Daulnoy.

The second part is closer to the Norse versions of Cinderella than to
the English story, and may be compared with part of Katie Woodencloak,
where the birds and the shoe appear; and where there is a going to
church.

I have many Gaelic versions of the incidents, all of which resemble each
other; the golden shoe is sometimes transferred to a man, which I take
to be some confusion in the memory of the person who tells the story.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[303:1](pt235.htm#fr_27.md) The words in Gaelic
have a sound that might be an imitation of the note of a singing bird;
the vowel sounds are *ui* and *oi*, and there are many soft consonants.
