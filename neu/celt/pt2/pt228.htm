<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">MAGHACH COLGAR.</H4>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">From Alexander MacNeill, Barra.</P>
<P>FIONN, the son of Cumal. FIONN MAC CUMHAIL was in Eirinn, and the king of Lochlann in Lochlann. The king of Lochlann sent MAGHACH COLGAR to Fionn to be taught. The king of the SEALG sent to him his own son, whom they called INNSRIDH MACRIGH NAN SEALG. They were of age, six years (and) ten. Then they were in Erin with Fionn, and Fionn taught Maghach, son of the king of Lochlann, every learning he had.</P>
<P>There came a message from the king of Lochlann, that he was in the sickness of death for leaving the world; and that the Maghach must go home to be ready for his crowning. Maghach went away, and the chase failed with the FEINN, and they did not know what they should do.</P>
<P>Maghach wrote a letter to Fionn from Lochlann to Eirinn: "I heard that the chase failed with you in Eirinn. I have burghs on sea, and I have burghs on shore: I have food for a day and a year in every burgh of these--the meat thou thinkest not of, and the drink thou thinkest not of; come thou hither thyself and thy set of FIANTACHAN. The keep of a day and a year is on thy head."</P>
<P>Fionn got the letter, and he opened it: "He is</P>
<P><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></P>
<P>pitiable who would not do a good thing in the beginning of youth; he might get a good share of it again in the beginning of his age. Here is a letter came from my foster-son from Lochlann that he has burghs on sea and burghs on shore, food for a day and a year in every one of them--the drink that we can think of, and the drink that we do not think of; the meat we can think of, and the meat that we do not think of--and it is best for us to be going."</P>
<P>"Whom shall we leave," said FIACHERE MACFHINN (the trier son of Fionn) his son, "to keep the darlings and little sons of Eireann."</P>
<P>"I will stay," said FIACHERE MACFHINN.</P>
<P>"I will stay," said DIARMID O'DUIBHNE, his sister's son.</P>
<P>"I will stay," said INNSRIDH MACRIGH NAN SEALG, his foster-son.</P>
<P>"I will stay," said CATH CONAN MAC MHIC CON.</P>
<P>"We will stay now," said they--the four.</P>
<P>"Thou art going, my father," said Fiachere, "and it is as well for thee to stay; how then shall we get word how it befalls thee in Lochlainn?"</P>
<P>"I will strike the ORD FIANNT (hammer of Fiant) in Lochlainn, and it will be known by the blow I strike in Lochlainn, or in Eirinn, how we shall be."</P>
<P>Fionn and his company went, they reached Lochlainn. Maghach Colgar, son of the king of Lochlainn, went before to meet them.</P>
<P>"Hail to thee, my foster father," said Maghach.</P>
<P>"Hail to thyself, my foster-son," said Fionn.</P>
<P>"There is the business I had with thee; I heard that the chase had failed in Eirinn, and it was not well with me to let you die without meat. I have burghs on sea and burghs on shore, and food for a day and</P>
<P><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></P>
<P>year in every one of them, and which kind wouldst thou rather choose?"</P>
<P>"It is on shore I used to always be, and it is not on sea; and I will take some on shore," said Fionn.</P>
<P>They went into one of them. There was a door opposite to every day in the year on the house; every sort of drink and meat within it. They sat on chairs; they caught every man hold of a fork and of a knife, They gave a glance from them, and what should they see in the "araich" (great half-ruined building), but not a hole open but frozen rime. They gave themselves that lift to rise. The chairs stuck to the earth. They themselves stuck to the chairs. Their hands stuck to the knives, and there was no way of rising out of that.</P>
<P>It was day about that Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg were going to keep the chase, and Diarmid O'Duibhne and Conan were going on the other day. On their returning back, what should they hear but a blow of the hammer of Fionn being struck in Lochlainn.</P>
<P>"If he has wandered the universe and the world, my foster-father is in pledge of his body and soul."</P>
<P>Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went from Eirinn, and they reached Lochlainn.</P>
<P>"Who is that without on the burgh?"</P>
<P>"I am," said Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg.</P>
<P>"Who is there on the place of combat?"</P>
<P>"There are two hundred score of the GREUGACHAIBH (Greeks) come out and great IALL at their head coming to seek my head to be his at his great meal to morrow."</P>
<P>Fiachaire MacFhinn and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went and they reached the place of combat.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A></P>
<P>"Where are ye going? " said Fiachaire MacFhinn.</P>
<P>"We are going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail to be ours at our great meal to-morrow."</P>
<P>"It is often that man's head might be sought and be on my own breast at early morning."</P>
<P>"Close up," said Iall, "and leave way for the people."</P>
<P>"There is a small delay on that," said Fiachaire.</P>
<P>Fiachaire, son of Fhinn, pressed out on the one end of them. Innsridh, son of the king of the Sealg, began in the other end, till the two glaves clashed against each other. They returned, and they reached the burgh.</P>

<P>"With me," said Fiachaire, "and with the son of the king of the Sealg."</P>
<P>"How was my foster-son off there?"</P>
<P>"Man upon man," said Fiachaire. "And if he had not another man, he had lacked none."</P>
<P>"Over the field, to my foster-son," said Fionn; "and his bones but soft yet! but mind the place of combat. Yonder are three hundred score of the Greeks coming out seeking my head to be theirs at their great meal tomorrow."</P>
<P>Fiachaire MacFhinn, and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg went, and they reached the place of combat.</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" said Fiachaire MacFhinn.</P>
<P>"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail to be ours at our great meal to-morrow."</P>

<P>"Close up and leave way for the people."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A></P>
<P>"There is still a small delay on that."</P>
<P>Fiachaire began in the one end of the company, and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg in the other, till the two glaves clashed on each other. They returned to the burgh.</P>
<P>"Who is that?" said Fionn.</P>

<P>"Mind the place of battle; there are four hundred score of the Greeks, and a great warrior at their head coming to seek my head to be theirs at their great meal to-morrow."</P>
<P>They went and they reached the place of battle.</P>
<P>"Where are you going?" said Fiachaire MacFhinn to the Greeks.</P>
<P>"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail, to be ours at our great meal to-morrow."</P>
<P>"It's often that man's head might be sought, and be on my own breast at early morning."</P>
<P>"Close up from the way, and leave way for the people."</P>
<P>"There is a small delay on that yet."</P>
<P>He himself and Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg began at them till they had killed every man of them, and till the two glaves clashed on each other. They returned home, and they reached the burgh.</P>

</DIR>

<P>"It was with me and so many of the Greeks."</P>
<P>"How was my foster-son off there?"</P>
<P>"Man upon man, and if there had been no one besides, he had lacked none."</P>
<P>"Mind the place of battle. There are twice as many as came out, a good and heedless warrior at their head, coming to seek my head, to be theirs at their great meal to-morrow."</P>
<P>They reached the place of battle; and when they reached it, there came not a man of the people.</P>
<P>"I won't believe," said Fiachaire MacFhinn, "that there are not remnants of meat in a place whence such bands are coming. Hunger is on myself, and that we ate but a morsel since we ate it in Eirinn. And come thou, Innsridh, and reach the place where they were. They will not know man from another man, and try if thou canst get scraps of bread, and of cheese, and of flesh, that thou wilt bring to us; and I myself will stay to keep the people, in case that they should come unawares."</P>
<P>"Well, then, I know not the place. I know not the way," said Innsridh, son of the king of Sealg, "but go thyself and I will stay."</P>
<P>Fiachaire went, and Innsridh staid, and what should they do but come unawares.</P>
<P>"Where are ye going," said Innsridh?</P>
<P>"Going to seek the head of Mhic Cumhail, to be ours at our great meal to-morrow."</P>
<P>"It is often that man's head might be sought, and be on my own breast at early morning."</P>
<P>"Close up, and leave way for the people</P>
<P><A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A></P>
<P>"There is a small delay on that yet." Innsridh began at them, and he left not one alone.</P>
<P>"What good did it do thee to slay the people, and that I will kill thee," said the great warrior at their head.</P>
<P>"If I had come out, from my meat and from my warmth, from my warmth and from my fire, thou shouldst not kill me." He and the warrior began at each other. They would make a bog of the crag, and a crag of the bog, in the place where the least they would sink they would sink to the knees, in the place that the most they would sink they would sink to the eyes. The great warrior gave a sweep with his glave, and he cut the head off Innsridh MacRigh nan Sealg.</P>
<P>Fiachaire came. The warrior met him, and with him was the head of Innsridh.</P>
<P>Said Fiachaire to the great warrior, "What thing hast thou there?"</P>
<P>"I have here the head of Mhic Cumhail."</P>
<P>"Hand it to me."</P>
<P>He reached him the head. Fiachaire gave a kiss to the mouth, and a kiss to the back of the head.</P>
<P>"Dost thou know to whom thou gavest it?" said Fiachaire to the warrior.</P>
<P>"I do not," said he. "It well became the body on which it was before."</P>
<P>He went and he drew back the head, and strikes it on the warrior's head while he was speaking, and makes one head of the two. He went and he reached (the place) where Fionn was again.</P>
<P>"Who is that without?" said Fionn.</P>
<P>"I am Fiachaire, thy son,</P><DIR>

<P>With whom was the hideous fight<BR>

<P>"It was with Innsridh, thy foster-son, and with the Greeks."</P>
<P>"How is my foster-son from that?"</P>
<P>"He is dead without a soul. Thy foster-son killed the Greeks first, and the great Greek killed him afterwards, and then I killed the great Greek."</P>
<P>"Mind the place of combat. There is Maghach, son of the king of Lochlann, and every one that was in the Greek burgh with him."</P>
<P>He went and he reached the place of combat.</P>
<P>"Thou art there, Fiachaire?" said Maghach Colgar.</P>
<P>"I am."</P>
<P>"Let hither thy father's head, and I will give thee a free bridge in Lochlainn."</P>
<P>"My father gave thee school and teaching, and every kind of DRAOCHD (Magic) he had, and though he taught that, thou wouldst take the head off him now, and with that thou shalt not get my father's head, until thou gettest my own head first."</P>
<P>Fiachaire began at the people, and he killed every man of the people.</P>
<P>"Thou has killed the people," said Maghach, "and I will kill thee."</P>
<P>They began at each other.</P>
<P>They would make a bog of the crag, and a crag of the bog, in the place where the least they would sink they would sink to the knees; in the place where the most they would sink, they would sink to the eyes. On a time of the times the spear of Mhaghach struck Fiachaire, and he gave a roar. What time should he give the roar but when Diarmid was turning step from the chase in Eirinn.</P>
<P>"If he has travelled the universe and the world,"</P>
<P><A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></P>
<P>said Diarmid, "the spear of the Maghach is endured by Fiachaire."</P>
<P>"Wailing be on thee," said Conan. "Cast thy spear and hit thy foe."</P>
<P>"If I cast my spear, I know not but I may kill my own man."</P>
<P>"If it were a yellow-haired woman, well wouldst thou aim at her."</P>
<P>"Wailing be on thee now; urge me no longer."</P>
<P>He shook the spear, and struck under the shield (chromastaich).</P>
<P>"Who would come on me from behind in the evening, that would not come on me from the front in the morning?" said Maghach.</P>
<P>"&#146;Tis I would come on thee," said Diarmid, "early and late, and at noon."</P>
<P>"What good is that to thee," said Maghach, "and that I will take the head off Fiachaire before thou comest."</P>
<P>"If thou takest the head off him," said Diarmid, "I will take off thy head when I reach thee."</P>
<P>Diarmid reached Lochlann. Maghach took the head off Fiachaire. Diarmid took the head off the Maghach. Diarmid reached Fionn.</P>
<P>"Who's that without?" said Fionn.</P>
<P>"It is I, Diarmid,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With whom was the hideous fight<BR>
That was on the battle place<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"It was with so many of the Greeks, and with <A HREF="errata.htm#1">the</A> Maghach, son of the king of Lochlann, and with Fiachaire, thy son; Fiachaire killed all the Greeks, Maghach killed Fiachaire, and then I killed Maghach."</P>
<P>"Though Maghach killed Fiachaire, why didst thou</P>
<P><A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A></P>
<P>kill Maghach, and not let him have his life? But mind the place of combat, and all that are in the burghs of the Greeks coming out together."</P>
<P>"Whether wouldst thou rather, Cath Conan, go with me or stay here?"</P>
<P>"I would rather go with thee."</P>
<P>They went, and when they reached the place of combat, no man met them. They reached where they were; they sat there, and what should Cath Conan do but fall asleep, they were so long coming out. It was not long after that till they began to come, and the doors to open. There was a door before every day in the year on every burgh, so that they burst forth all together about the head of Diarmid. Diarmid began at them, and with the sound of the glaves and return of the men, Cath Conan awoke, and he began thrusting his sword in the middle of the leg of Diarmid. Then Diarmid felt a tickling in the middle of his leg. He cast a glance from him, and what should he see but Cath Conan working with his own sword.</P>
<P>"Wailing be on thee, Cath Conan," said Diarmid; "pass by thy own man and hit thy foe, for it is as well for thee to thrust it into yonder bundle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as to be cramming it into my leg. Do not thou plague me now till I hit my foe!"</P>
<P>They killed every man of the people.</P>
<P>They thought of those who were in the burgh, and they without food; each one of them took with him the full of his napkin, and his breast, and his pouches.</P>
<P>"Who's that without?" said Fionn.</P>
<P>"I am Diarmid, thy sister's son."</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A></P>
<P>"How are the Greeks?"</P>
<P>"Every man of them is dead, without a soul."</P>
<P>"Oh, come and bring hither to me a deliverance of food."</P>
<P>"Though I should give thee food, how shouldst thou eat it, and thou there and thee bound?"</P>
<P>He had no way of giving them food, but to make a hole in the burgh above them, and let the food down to them.</P>
<P>"What is there to loose thee from that said Diarmid.</P>
<P>"Well, that is hard to get," said Fionn; "and it is not every man that will get it; and it is not to be got at all."</P>
<P>"Tell thou me," said Diarmid, "and I will get it."</P>
<P>"I know that thou wilt subdue the world till thou gettest it; and my healing is not to be got, nor my loosing from this, but with the one thing."</P>
<P>"What thing is it that thou shouldst not tell it to me, and that I might get it?"</P>
<P>"The three daughters of a king, whom they call King Gil; the daughters are in a castle in the midst of an anchorage, without maid, without sgalag (servant), without a living man but themselves. To get them, and to wring every drop of blood that is in them out on plates and in cups; to take every drop of blood out of them, and to leave them as white as linen."</P>
<P>Diarmid went, and he was going till there were holes in his shoes and black on his soles, the white clouds of day going, and the black clouds of night coming, without finding a place to stay or rest in. He reached the anchorage, and he put the small end of his spear under his chest, and he cut a leap, and he was in the castle that night. On the morrow he returned, and he took</P>
<P><A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A></P>
<P>with him two on the one shoulder and one on the other shoulder; he put the small end of his spear under his chest, and at the first spring he was on shore. He reached Fionn; he took the girls to him; he wrung every drop of blood that was in every one of them out at the finger ends of her feet and bands; he put a black cloth above them, and he began to spill the blood on those who were within, and every one as he spilt the blood on him, he would rise and go. The blood failed, and every one was loosed but one, whom they called Conan.</P>
<P>"Art thou about to leave me here, oh Diarmid."</P>
<P>"Wailing be on thee; the blood has failed."</P>
<P>"If I were a fine yellow-haired woman, its well thou wouldst aim at me?"</P>
<P>"If thy skin stick to thyself, or thy bones to thy flesh, I will take thee out."</P>
<P>He caught him by the hand and he got him loose, but that his skin stuck to the seat, and the skin of his soles to the earth. "It were well now," said they, "if the children of the good king were alive, but they should be buried under the earth." They went where they were, and they found them laughing and fondling each other, and alive. Diarmid went, and took them with him on the shower top of his shoulder, and he left them in the castle as they were before, and they all came home to EIRINN.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE="-1">heard it recited by him and others ever since he remembers; says it has been handed down orally from one person to another from time immemorial. MacNeill is about sixty years of age, and can neither read, write, nor speak English. His father died twenty years ago, aged eighty years.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barra, July 1859.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I know nothing like this anywhere out of the Highlands, but I have heard similar wild rambling stories there all my life.</P>
<P>The heroes are the heroes of Ossian, with the characters always assigned to them in Gaelic story. Fionn, the head of the band, but not the most successful; Diarmaid, the brown-haired admirer of the fair sex; Conan, the wicked, mischievous character, who would be the clown in a pantomime, or Loki in Norse mythology. They are enchanted in a BRUGH, which I have translated burgh, on the authority of Armstrong; and they fight crowds of Greeks on a place, if it be A for AITE; or at a ford, if it be ATH, which is pronounced in the same way. Greeks, GREUGACHIBH, may possibly be GRUAGACH-ibh, the long-haired people mentioned in the first story, changed into Greeks in modern times; or "GRUAGACH" may be a corruption from "Greugach," and this story compounded by some old bard from all the knowledge he had gathered, including Greeks, just as the fore-word to the Edda is compounded of Tyrkland, and Troja, and Odin, and Thor, the Asia men and the Asa, and all that the writer knew. The story as told is extravagant. Men in Eirinn and in Lochlainn, Ireland, and Scandinavia, converse and throw spears at each other. The hammer of Fionn is heard in Ireland when struck in Lochlan. But one of the manuscripts in the Advocates' Library throws some light on this part of the tale. If the scene were an island in the Shannon, men might converse and fight in the ford well enough. The MS. is a quarto on paper, with no date, containing five tales in prose, a vocabulary, and poems, and is attributed to the twelfth century. "Keating considers the subject of Tale 2, which contains forty-two pages, as authentic history." One of the people mentioned is Aol or &AElig;ul, a son of Donald, king of Scotland, who is probably "Great Iall," unless Iall is Iarl, an Earl. Tale 3 sends Cuchullin first to Scotland to learn feats of agility from Doiream, daughter of King Donald, thence to Scythia, where a seminary is crowded with pupils from Asia,</FONT></P>
<P><A NAME="page_201"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">Africa, and Europe. He beats them all, goes through wonderful adventures, goes to Greece, returns with certain Irish chiefs, arrives in Ireland, and is followed by his son, a half Scythian, whom be kills at a ford. No. 4, the story of the children of Lir, changed into swans, is very curious.</P>
<P>No. 5 is called the rebellion Of MIODACH, son of COLGAR, against Fingal, and seems to resemble Maghach Colgar.</P>
<P>Colgar, king of Lochlin, proposes to assume the title of Sovereign of the Isles, and to subjugate Ireland. He is beaten by Fingal, who gives him a residence <I>in an island in the Shannon</I>. After eighteen years he comes to propose riddles to Fingal, and invites him to an entertainment. They, the Fingalians, go, and <I>are enchanted</I>, sing their own dirge, are overheard by a friend sent by Ossian. <I>Some Greek Earls</I> (Gaelic, Iarla) appear, and there is a great deal of fighting. Ossian dispatches DIARMAD O DUIBHNE and FATHACH CANNACH, who <I>guard a ford</I> and perform feats. Oscar, son of Ossian, performs prodigies of valour, and kills Sinnsir.</P>
<P>This abstract of an abstract, lent me by Mr. Skene, is sufficient to shew that this old manuscript tale still exists in fragments, as tradition, amongst the people of the Isles.</P>
<P>The transcriber who copied it into the Roman hand in 1813, considers the MS. to be written in very pure Gaelic. It is referred to the twelfth or thirteenth century, is characterized by exuberant diction, groups of poetical adjectives, each beginning with the same letter as the substantive. In short, Tale 5 seems to be a much longer, better, and older <A HREF="errata.htm#2">version</A> of the tale of Maghach Colgar. The transcriber makes a kind of apology for the want of truth in these tales at the end of his abstract. He was probably impressed with the idea that Ossian and his heroes sang and fought in Scotland, and that Uirsgeul meant a <I>new</I> tale or novel, unworthy of notice. My opinion is that the prose tales and the poems, and this especially, are alike old compositions, founded on old traditions common to all Celts, and perhaps to all Indo-European races, but altered and ornamented, and twisted into compositions by bards and reciters of all ages, and every branch of the race; altered to suit the time and place--adorned with any ornament that the bard or reciter had at his disposal; and now a mere remnant of the past.</P>
<P>It is a great pity that these MSS. in the Advocates' Library</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">are still unpublished. They could not fail to throw light on the period when they were written.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the so-called Greeks in this story seem to want the head of Fionn for dinner.</FONT></P>
