### L.

### THE THREE QUESTIONS.

From the Brothers MacCraw, North Uist, 1859.

THERE was once, long ago, a scholar; and when he had done learning, his
master said that he must now answer three questions, or have his head
taken off. The scholar was to have time to make ready, and being in a
great fright, he went to a miller who was the master's brother, and
asked his aid.

The miller disguised himself and went instead of the scholar, and the
first question put to him was this:--"How many ladders would reach the
sky?"

"Now," said the narrator, "can *you* answer that?"

"One, if it were long enough."

"That's right." The second was:--

"Where is the middle of the world?"

So the miller laid down a rod, and he said:--"Here, set a hoop about the
world, and thou will find the middle here."

The third was:--"What is the world's worth?"

"Well," said the miller, "the Saviour was sold for thirty pieces of
silver, I am sure the world is worth no more."

"Oh," said the brother who was riding beside us, "that's not the way I
have heard it. The second was,"

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

"How long will it take to go round the world?" And the miller said:--

"If I were as swift as the sun and moon, I would run it in twenty-four
hours."

And the third was:--

"What is my thought?"

And the miller answered:--

"I can tell: Thou thinkest that I am thy scholar, but I am thy brother,
the miller."

This was told to me September 1, 1859, in North Uist, as I walked along
the road. There are a great many similar wise saws current which are
generally fathered on George Buchanan, the tutor of James VI.

The following are a few riddles of the same kind, collected at Gairloch,
for Osgood Mackenzie, Esq., by Mr. Donald MacDonald:

1\. Whether is older, the man or the beard?

The beard is the older, for the work of creation was all finished before
the man, and the beard was on the goat before the man was.

2\. What is the wood that is not bent nor straight?

Sawdust. It is neither bent nor straight.

This riddle forms part of a very long and curious story which I heard
told at Inverary, at Easter, 1859, and which is written down.

3\. What is the thing which the Creator never saw, and that kings see
but seldom, and that I see every day?

There is but one Creator, for that he never saw his like. Kings are but
scarce, for that they see each other but rarely; but I see my own like
every day that I get up,--other sinners like myself.

The riddle is very well known; but this is another view of it.

4\. There were three soldiers coming home on furlough, and their three
wives with them; they came to a river over which there was a ferry, but
the boat would take with it but two together. The question is, how did
they make the passage, for no one of them would trust his wife with
another man, unless he was himself beside her?

Two women went over first, one went on shore, and the other came back
with the boat, and she took the third with her, one of them went back
and she stood beside her own husband, and the two husbands of the women
who were over went back with the boat; one of them went on shore, and
the wife of the man who was in the boat went into her along with him,
and they went to the other side. His wife went on shore, and the man who
was yonder came in the boat; then the two men went over; then there were
three men over, and a woman; this woman took over the other women by the
way of one and one; and there seem to be more solutions than one for the
problem.

This puzzle, in various shapes, is well known, *e.g.* the Fox, the
Goose, and the Bag of Corn.

I see to me, over the fall,  
A little curly hasty one;

Chi mi thugam thar an eas
