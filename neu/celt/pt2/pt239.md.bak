### XLVII.

### FEARACHUR LEIGH.

From Sutherland.

NOW Farquhar was one time a drover in the Reay country, and he went from
Glen Gollich to England (some say Falkirk), to sell cattle; and the
staff that he had in his hand was hazel (caltuinn). One day a doctor met
him. "What's that," said he, "that ye have got in y'r hand?" "It is a
staff of hazel." "And where did ye cut that?" "In Glen Gollig: north, in
Lord Reay's country." "Do ye mind the place and the tree?" "That do I."
"Could ye get the tree?" "Easy." "Well, I will give ye gold more than ye
can lift, if ye will go back there and bring me a wand of that hazel
tree; and take this bottle and bring me something more, and I will give
you as much gold again. Watch at the hole at the foot, and put the
bottle to it; let the six serpents go that come out first, and put the
seventh one into the bottle, and tell no man, but come back straight
with it here."

So Farquhar went back to the hazel glen, and when he had cut some boughs
off the tree he looked about for the hole that the doctor had spoken of.
And what should come out but six serpents, brown and barred like adders.
These he let go, and clapped the bottle to the hole's mouth, to see
would any more come out. By and by a white snake came rolling through.
Farquhar

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

had him in the bottle in a minute, tied him down, and hurried back to
England with him.

The doctor gave him siller enough to buy the Reay country, but asked him
to stay and help him with the white snake. They lit a fire with the
hazel sticks, and put the snake into a pot to boil. The doctor bid
Farquhar watch it, and not let any one touch it, and not to let the
steam escape, "for fear," he said, "folk might know what they were at."

He wrapped up paper round the pot lid, but he had not made all straight
when the water began to boil, and the steam began to come out at one
place.

Well, Farquhar saw this, and thought he would push the paper down round
the thing; so he put his finger to the bit, and then his finger into his
mouth, for it was wet with the bree.

Lo! he knew everything, and the eyes of his mind were opened. "I will
keep it quiet though," said he to himself.

Presently the doctor came back, and took the pot from the fire. He
lifted the lid, and dipping his finger in the steam drops he sucked it;
but the virtue had gone out of it, and it was no more than water to him.

"Who has done this!" he cried, and he saw in Farquhar's face that it was
he. "Since you have taken the bree of it, take the flesh too," he said
in a rage, and threw the pot at him--(ma dh' ol thu 'n sugh ith an
fheoil). Now Farquhar had become allwise, and he set up as a doctor.
\[The collector who took this down, grammar and all, here remarks, that
Michael Scott got his knowledge by serpent's bree (brigh); and the
wisdom of the mouth is said to have belonged to Fingal, who began life
as a herd boy on the Shin. Some giants came to him one day and bade him
roast a fish for them,

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

threatening to kill him if he burnt it. He did so, all but one small
spot. On this spot he quickly put his finger, and as quickly transferred
the hot finger to his mouth, putting it under his teeth: a gift of
omniscience was the result, and this became the foundation of his future
greatness.

The very same incident with a dragon's heart is in the Volsung tale, see
Dasent's introduction, p. 65. It is told in Chambers' Nursery Songs, of
some laird in Scotland. Mrs. MacTavish tells it, and I have heard it in
the west in various shapes ever since I can remember. Grimm found it in
Germany in the story of the White, Snake; and there are varieties of the
same incident scattered throughout Grimm; for instance in the TWO
BROTHERS, where children eat the heart and liver of a golden bird, and
find gold under their pillows; and this story has a relation in Gaelic
also. But to return to Farquhar Leech.\]

He set up as a doctor, and there was no secret bid from him, and nothing
that be could not cure.

He went from place to place and healed men, and so they called him
Farquhar Leigheach (the healer). Now he heard that the king was sick,
and he went to the city of the king to know what would ail him. "It was
his knee," said all the folk, "and he has many doctors, and pays them
all greatly; and whiles they can give him relief, but not for long, and
then it is worse than ever with him, and you may hear him roar and cry
with the pain that is in his knee, in the bones of it." One day Farquhar
walked up and down before the king's house. And he cried--

"An daol dubh ris a chnamh gheal."  
The black beetle to the white bone.

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

And the people looked at him, and said that the strange man from the
Reay country was through-other.

The next day Farquhar stood at the gate and cried, "The black beetle to
the white bone!" and the king sent to know who it was that cried
outside, and what was his business. The man, they said, was a stranger,
and men called him the Physician. So the king, who was wild with pain,
called him in; and Farquhar stood before the king, and aye "The black
beetle to the white bone!" said he. And so it was proved. The doctors,
to keep the king ill, and get their money, put at whiles a black beetle
into the wound in the knee, and the beast was eating the bone and his
flesh, and made him cry day and night. Then the doctors took it out
again, for fear he should die; and when he was better they put it back
again. This Farquhar knew by the serpent's wisdom that he had, when he
laid his finger under his teeth; and the king was cured, and had all his
doctors hung.

Then the king said that he would give Farquhar lands or gold, or
whatever he asked. Then Farquhar asked to have the king's daughter, and
all the isles that the sea runs round, from point of Storr to Stromness
in the Orkneys; so the king gave him a grant of all the isles. But
Farquhar the physician never came to be Farquhar the king, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) for he had an ill-wisher that poisoned
him, and he died.

I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Cosmo Innes for the following note,
which joins a legend to an historical fact.

The names given are a curious instance of old Gaelic spelling. They are
evidently spelt by ear, and so spelt as to be easily understood; but
they are not spelt according to modern rule.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

It is not often we can connect these wild legends with record or
charter, but Farchar Leech receives a local habitation from authentic
writs.

The "Reay country" of the legend is Strathnaver. One race of Mackays who
inhabit it are called by their countrymen clan vie Farquhar--from what
Farquhar, was unknown to Sir Robert Gordon and the local historians. The
legend points to the man. In 1379 Farquhar, the King's physician
(*medicus Regis*) had a grant from the Prince Alexander Stuart (the wolf
of Badenoch) of the lands of Mellenes and hope in that district; and in
1386 King Robert II. granted to the same person, styled Ferchard Leech,
in heritage, the islands of Jura (now Alderney), Calwa Sanda (*Handa*),
Elangawne, Elanewillighe, Elanerone, Elanehoga, between
Rowestorenastynghe (*i.e., the Rowe or point of Store, in Assynt*), and
Rowearmadale (*i.e., Armidale Head in Farr*).

The writer of the old statistical account of the parish, speaking of
these grants from hearsay or tradition, names the grantee "Ferchard
Beton, a native of Isla, and a famous physician." Perhaps he was misled
by the celebrity of the Isla Betons, several generations of whom were
"mediciners," famous through all the Islands and West Highlands.

Whether Farchar Leech died by poison or otherwise, he seems to have left
descendants who inherited his lands; for, so late as 1511, Donald
M'Donacy M'Corrochie described as "descendit frae Farquhar Leiche;"
resigned Melness, Hope, and all his lands of Strathnaver in favour of
the chief family of the Mackays.

The marriage with the King's daughter, as well as the black beetle, want
confirmation.

There is a west country version of this story which I have known all my
life in part; and which agrees with the account of the writer who spoke
from tradition long ago.

Mrs. MacTavish writes:--

 

2\. The OLLADH ILEACH (Islay Doctor).

There were three brothers of the name of Beaton, natives of Islay, famed
for their skill in medicine. One of the brothers, called John, went to
Mull, and was known as the *Olladh Muilleach*, or Mull doctor. His tomb
is to be seen in Iona., Another called Fergus remained in Islay, and was
known as the OLLADH ILEACH. The third, GILLEADHA, was in the end the

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

most famed of the [three](errata.htm#15.md); he was the herbalist, and
employed by his brother Fergus to gather herbs and prepare them for use.

When boiling a cauldron of herbs, in which a white snake had been put,
in stirring, it bubbled up and spattered on his hand, this he licked
off, and at once he got such a view of his profession as to make him
unrivalled. He was summoned to attend one of the Scotch Kings, who was
cured by him; but through the jealousy of other doctors, he never
returned to Islay, having been poisoned.

(So far the Islay tradition very nearly accords with the Sutherland
account of Farquhar Leech). He was called to see a young lady, daughter
of Mackay of Kilmahumaig, near Crinan. When approaching the house,
attended by a servant, the latter remarked a sweet female voice which he
heard singing a song:--

"’S binn an guth cinn sin" ars’ an gilleadh.  
"’S binn" ars’ an t-Olladh, "air uachdar Losguin."

"Sweet is that head's voice," said the lad;  
"Sweet," said the doctor, "above a Toad."

The poor young woman had an enormous appetite, which could not be
satisfied, but she was reduced to a skeleton. The doctor, on hearing her
voice, knew what her disease was, and ordered a sheep to be killed and
roasted.

The lady was prevented from getting any food, from which she was in
great agony.

She was made to sit by the sheep while it was being roasted, and the
flavour of the meat tempted the toad she had swallowed to come up her
throat and out of her mouth, when she was completely cured. The reptile
she had swallowed was called LON CRAOIS.

Now, something very like this part was told me in Norway as a fact by a
Norwegian, the travelling interpreter of an English companion. My old
friend Juil has since become a flourishing contractor. He had seen a
young woman on board a steamer going with her friends to Christiania for
advice. She had been reaping, and had fallen asleep on a sheaf of corn
in the field. She slept with her mouth open, and a serpent had run down
her throat. She had been in a state of terror and horror ever since, and
they were taking her to the capital. "I saw her myself," said my
informant; "I heard that the doctors could not cure her

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

at Christiania, and that she went to Copenhagen. There all the great
doctors were beat; but a young doctor made them put her in a dark room,
lying on her side on the floor, with a saucer of milk before her.
'Serpents are very fond of milk you see.' The first time they opened the
door the serpent had only put his head up, and he drew it in again when
he heard the noise. The second time they moved the saucer a little
further away, and he came out altogether, and the young doctor killed
the serpent and shewed it to the young 'womans,'" and thus she got quite
well. "And that is quite true."

Every word of it might be true, if we suppose a clever man and a woman
possessed with an idea which had to be coaxed out of her; but the
question is, when did that clever man live, and where?--in
Copenhagen--in the West Highlands--or in Africa, where the creature
swallowed was a baboon, and the bait a banana skilfully administered by
a doctor to Anansi (Dasent, Norse Tales, p. 502); or in London, where a
clever doctor tempted a serpent out of a patient with a mutton chop,
according to a story told to a friend of mine in his childhood; or have
there been many doctors and patients who have gone through the same
adventure? But to go on with the west country wise men.

"The wife of a man who was suffering from rheumatism consulted the
Olladh Muileach. He went to see him, bringing a birch rod, and having
got his patient out of bed, ordered his wife to lay the birch rod
smartly on his back, and chase him till the doctor would say it was
enough. He would not allow her to cease till the poor man perspired
freely and became supple, and free from pain."

This again might be true, every word; but when did the doctor live, and
where? Was it in the country of King Voonan?

A learned doctor in the Arabian Nights, the sage Dooban, makes King
Voonan play at ball till he perspires and absorbs some medicaments from
the handle of the "Golfstick."

"Another man went to him for a cure for sore eyes. The doctor examined
his eyes, but told him he was likely to suffer in a more serious manner
from horns that would soon appear on his knees. The-man seemed much
alarmed, and asked if there was any way in which he could prevent such a
calamity. 'No way,' said the doctor, 'but by keeping your hands on your
knees for three weeks. At the end of that period come to me, that I may

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

see how you get on.' The man did as he was advised, and went to the
doctor."

"Well," said the doctor, "have the horns made their appearance?" "No,"
said the man.

"Have you attended to my advice?" said the doctor. "Oh, yes," said the
patient, "I have kept my hands continually, night and day, on my knees."

"How are your eyes?" said the doctor. "My eyes are quite well," said the
man. "Very well," said the doctor, "go home and keep your mind easy
about the horns, and don't rub your eyes."

"The descendants of both Fergus and Gilleadh are still in Islay."

The name of Malcolm Bethune is written on a curious old manuscript in
the Advocates' Library. It is described at page 295 of the report of the
Highland Society on the poems of Ossian, 1805, with this note on the
name:--"He was one of a family eminent for learning that supplied the
Western Isles for many ages with physicians, whose diligence and skill
are gratefully remembered in the traditionary record of their country."

It seems, then, that fifty-five years have not obliterated the popular
tales clustered about the name of Bethune or Beaton, stored in the mind
of one lady who may well remember the publication of the report, and to
whose excellent memory this collection of stories owes so much.

Is the whole of this a remnant of Serpent worship and supposed
possession by the god? In the Highlands now, as else. where, and from
the earliest of times, serpents have something to do with healing. From
the brazen serpent in the wilderness, to Æsculapius, and from Æsculapius
to Farquhar Leech and Dr. Beaton, is a long stretch of time and space;
but snakes are still associated with healing amongst Spartan shepherds,
as well as Highland peasants, as the following extract from my journal
will show:--

"1852, May 10.--Having turned some Indian corn out of a loft, took up
our quarters for the night at a half-ruined house not far from Sparta.
At the door were a lot of fellows in shaggy capotes drinking sour wine
and making a row. One of them, dressed in a kind of sheepskin cloak,
with a long crook in his hand, astonished me by pulling out a serpent a
yard long, which he handled with perfect coolness.

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

I rattled down the ladder, to the risk of my neck, and found that he had
a bag full. There might have been half a dozen. I made him turn them all
out, and set the Greeks to catch them again. My friend ended by
producing a number of white powders, which made the swallower
independent of snake bites. I bought a dozen, and proceeded to test them
in the candle. They were vegetable, and I suspect flour."

In Ceylon, according to Sir Emerson Torment (page 193), it is the same.

"There is a rare variety (of snakes) which the natives fancifully
designate the King of the Cobras. It has the head and the anterior half
of the body of so light a colour that at a distance it seems like a
silvery white." . . . "Raja or King."

In the same page it appears that the snake charmers use a certain
*stone* to cure snake bites, and that they also use a certain *root*. I
do not know the word for snake, but Raja is not unlike RIGH, King. Snake
charmers are also common in Northern Africa.

The serpent creed then is very widely spread, and the belief in the
Highlands is worth illustration.

Widow Mary Calder (in Sutherland) tells, that "The great white snake is
not uncommon in Sutherland, and has been sometimes, but not often,
killed. It never rests by day or by night, and besides running along the
ground, has a revolving motion peculiar to itself, turning over and over
through an ivory ring which is loose on its body. This is formed from
its own slime, and sometimes slips off, in which case the snake makes
another, and the finder of the ring is safe against all diseases and
enchantments,"--Vide adder beads in the Gallovidian Encyclopædia.

"Another great serpent has been seen by the natives. The last was nine
feet long, and covered with hair; it had a mane, and was a bodily
manifestation of the evil one."

It was a common belief in the West that "snakes' eggs" were lucky. I
once owned one, but lost it. It was a bead of various colours, blue and
white, apparently of glass, very like those figured in Wilson's
Prehistoric Annals of Scotland, page 304. These are commonly found in
tumuli, and are the adder stones of the Lowlands, and Druid's glass in
Ireland. They are supposed by Mr. Wilson to have been worn as charms by
women of that unknown prehistoric race which once inhabited Scotland. At
all events, the idea that they were produced by snakes is common.

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mr. Wilson suggests "the probable means of
accounting for their introduction into Britain is by the Phœnicians, or
by traders in direct communication with that people." If so, the same
people may have brought the belief and the tales from the East, where a
serpent has had to do with mythology from the earliest of times. (See
Rawlinson's Herodotus, under the head Serpent). But besides this white
king of snakes, who has a brother Raja in Ceylon, there is the great eel
which is always appearing in lakes and in the sea, and which is firmly
believed to exist. It has no peculiarity that I know of but enormous
size. A keeper used to tell me that he saw it repeatedly in a small but
very deep lake. "It was as big as a saik" (sack). I am quite sure the
man believed what he said, though I believe his eyes had but realized an
old legend.

Mrs. MacTavish writes:--"An old man in Lorn used to tell that he went
one summer morning to fish on a rock; he was not long there when he saw
the head of an eel pass. He continued fishing for an hour, and the eel
was still passing. He went home, worked in the field all day, and having
returned to the same rock in the evening, the eel was still passing, and
about dusk he saw her tail disappearing behind the rock on which he
stood fishing." The old man was nicknamed Donul n' ro; Donald of the
reef.

That eel was a bouncer, but not so big as the sea-serpent of the Edda,
which went round the world.

A gentleman, in whose house I dined at Tromsoe, near the Arctic circle,
told me that "the fishermen often saw the sea-worm in Salten Fjord." All
the world have heard of Capt. MacQuae's sea-snake. I have a drawing of
him done by a gentleman who was a midshipman on board the Dœdulus and
saw him. I lately saw a master of a merchant vessel at Liverpool, who
calmly and deliberately assured a royal commission that he had seen a
large serpent "in the sea about the same place." He said nothing about
it in the papers, for no one would believe him; but he had no doubt
about it--he saw the sea-snake.

I have no doubt that these men all believed what they said to be true.
It is hard to believe that they were all mistaken. Few of them can have
heard of Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen; but his book gives pictures of
the sea-snake, and tells how it was seen and shot at in Norwegian Fjords
in his day. There surely are some such creatures in the sea. Highland
stories are full of sea monsters which are called Uille bheist and
Draygan, and which have numerous heads. Surely there must be some
foundation

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

for so many fictions. St. George killed a Dragon; Perseus a sea monster;
Bellerophon the Chimera; Hercules the Hydra; Apollo killed Pytho; Fraoch
killed, and was killed by, a Behir (great snake); Vishnoo killed a
serpent in India. "Sin, the giant Aphophis, as 'the great serpent,'
often with a human head," was represented pierced by the spear of Horns
or of Atmoo (as Re the Sun) in Egypt. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) In short, I believe that the Gaelic
serpent stories, and the Highland beliefs concerning them, are old
myths, a part of the history of the oldest feud in the world; the feud
with the serpent who was "more subtle than any beast of the field that
the Lord had made," for the leading idea seems always to be that the
holy, healing power overcomes the subtle destroyer. Thus Mrs. M'Tavish
tells that St. Patrick coaxed the last Irish snake into a chest by the
promise that he would let him out "to-morrow," and then he put him into
Lough Neagh, and there he is still. The serpent is always asking, "is it
tomorrow?" but a "to-morrow" is never come; and no serpents are to be
found on any place belonging to Ireland to this day.

The same belief extends to numerous small islands on the coast of
Scotland, and old ruined chapels with sculptured grave-stones are
generally to be found in them. I know one such island where some boys
(as I was told) once took a living serpent, and it died. It is named
Texa, and this legend is attached to it:--"It is a portion of Ireland
which a giant's wife took a fancy to carry across the Channel in her
apron. From a rent in the apron, Tarsgier fell through, and the rent
getting larger, Texa fell from her, and so by degrees did all the other
rocks and islets between Texa, and the point of Ardmore, where she left
Eillan a chuirn, which she did not think worth taking any further, being
so much annoyed at having lost the rest. Certain it is that neither
serpents nor toads are found in these islands, though both are numerous
in Islay. It is said that neither can live in any place which St.
Columba blessed, or where he built chapels and monasteries, such as in
Eillach a Naomh and Iona."

So then, in the West Highlands now, the holy power overcomes the snake,
as in mythology over great part of the world, and as seems to me the
belief may perhaps be traced to holy writ.
