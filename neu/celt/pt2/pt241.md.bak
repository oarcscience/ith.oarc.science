### XLIX.

### THE CAT AND THE MOUSE. <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md)

From Hector MacLean, Islay.

1\.

THUIRT an luch bheag 's i 'san toll,  
"Dé 'm fonn a th' air a' chat ghlas?"  
"Fonn math is deagh shaod  
Gum faodadh thusa tighinn a mach."

2\.

"’S mor m' eagal romh na dubhain chrom,  
A th' agad ann am bonn do chas  
Mharbh thu mo phiuthrag an dé  
'S fhuair mi fein air eigin as."

3\.

Cha mhis' a bha 'sin ach cat mhic Iain Ruaigh  
A b' àbhaist a bhi ruagadh chearc,  
Ghoid i 'n caise 'bha 's a' chliabh,  
'S dh'ith i 'n t-iasg a bha 's a' phreas."

TRANSLATION.

1\.

Said the mousie in the hole,  
"What is that purr of the grey cat?"  
"A good purr and a pleasant mood,  
That thou mightest come out of that."

2\.

"Great is my fear for the crooked hooks  
That thou hast got in the sole of thy feet;  
Thou killedst my sister yesterday,  
And I myself got hardly quit."

3\.

"That was not me, but John Roy's cat,  
That used to be the hen's distress:  
She stole the cheese that was in the creel,  
And ate the fish that was in the press."

This old rhyme has become proverbial. A part of it was sent as a proverb
from Inverary.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[404:1](pt241.htm#fr_56.md) You speak of Nursery
Rhymes. The following is a very trifling one, which I remember myself,
and have never been able to forget. HECTOR MACLEAN, Islay.
