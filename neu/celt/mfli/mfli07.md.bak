# The Three Daughters of the King of the East and the Son of a King in Erin

THERE was once a king in Erin, and he had an only son. While this son
was a little child his mother died.

After a time the king married and had a second son.

The two boys grew up together and as the elder was far handsomer and
better than the younger, the queen became jealous, and was for banishing
him out of her sight.

The king's castle stood near the shore of Loch Erne, and three swans
came every day to be in the water and swim in the lake. The elder
brother used to go fishing; and once when he sat at the side of the
water, the three swans made young women of themselves, came to where he
sat, and talked to the king's son.

The queen had a boy minding cows in the place, and when he went home
that night he told about what he had seen, - that there were three young
women at the lake, and the king's son was talking to the three that day.
Next morning the queen called the cowboy to her, and said: "Here is a
pin of slumber; and do you stick it in the clothes of the king's son
before the young women come, and when they go away, take out the pin and
bring it back to me."

That day when the cowboy saw the three young women coming, he went near
and threw the pin, which stuck in the clothes of the king's son. That
instant he fell asleep on the ground.

When the young women came, one of them took a towel, dipped it in the
cold water of the lake, and rubbed his face; but she could not rouse
him. When their time came to go, they were crying and lamenting because
the young man was asleep; and one of the three put a gold pin in his
bosom, so that when he woke up he would find it and keep her in mind.

After they had gone a couple of hours, the cowboy came up, took out the
sleeping-pin, and hurried off. The king's son woke up without delay; and
finding the gold pin in his bosom, he knew the young woman had come to
see him.

Next day he fished and waited again. When the cowboy saw the young women
coming out of the lake, he stole tip a second time, and threw the pin,
which stuck in his clothes, and that moment he was drowsy and fell
asleep. When the young women came he was lying on the ground asleep. One
of them rubbed him with a towel dipped in the water of the lake; but no
matter what she did, he slept on, and when they had to go, she put a
gold ring in his bosom. When the sisters were leaving the lake, and had
put on their swan-skins and become swans, they all flew around him and
flapped their wings in his face to know could they rouse him; but there
was no use in trying.

After they had gone, the cowboy came and took out the sleeping-pin. When
the king's son was awake he put his hand in his bosom, found the
keepsake, and knew that the sisters had come to him.

When he went fishing the third day, he called up the cowboy and said: "I
fall asleep every day. I know something is done to me. Now do you tell
me all. In time I'll reward you well I know my stepmother sends
something by you that takes my senses away.

"I would tell," said the cowboy, " but I'm in dread my mistress might
kill or banish me."

"She will not, for I'll put you in the way she'll not harm you. You see
my fishing-bag here? Now throw the pin, which I know you have, towards
me, and hit the bag."

The cowboy did as he was told, and threw the pin into the fishing-bag,
where it remained without harm to any one. The cowboy went back to his
cattle, and the prince fished on as before. The three swans were out in
the middle of the lake swimming around for themselves in the water, and
the prince moved on, fishing, till he came to a bend in the shore. On
one side of him a tongue of land ran out into the lake. The swans came
to the shore, leaving the piece of land between themselves and the
prince. Then they took off their swan-skins, were young women, and
bathed in the lake.

After that they came out, put on the dress of young women, and went to
where the king's son was fishing.

He spoke to them, and asked where were they from, in what place were
they born, and why were they swans.

They said: "We are three sisters, daughters of the king of the East, and
we have two brothers. Our mother died, and our father married again, and
had two other daughters; and these two are not so good looking nor so
well favoured as we, and their mother was in dread they wouldn't get
such fine husbands as we, so she enchanted us, and now we are going
about the world from lake to lake in the form of swans."

Then the eldest of the three sisters said to the king's son: "What kind
are you, and where were you born?"

"I was born in Erin," said he; "and when I was a little boy my mother
died, my father married again and had a second son, and that son wasn't
to the eye what I was, and my stepmother was for banishing me from my
father's house because she thought her own son was not so good as I was,
and I am fishing here every day by the lake to keep out of her sight."

"Well," said the eldest sister, "I thought you were a king's son, and so
I came to you in my own form to know could we go on in the world
together."

"I don't know yet what to do," said the king's son.

"Well, be sure of your mind to-morrow, for that will be the last day for
me here."

When the cowboy was going home, the king's son gave him the sleeping-pin
for the stepmother. When he had driven in the cattle, the cowboy told
the queen that the young man had fallen asleep as on the two other days.

But there was an old witch in the place who was wandering about the lake
that day. She saw everything, went to the queen, and told her how the
three swans had made young women of themselves, and talked with her
stepson.

When the queen heard the old witch, she fell into a terrible rage at the
cowboy for telling her a lie, and banished him out of her sight forever.
Then she got another cowboy, and sent him off with the sleeping-pin next
day. When he came near the lake, the king's son tried to drive him off;
but the cowboy threw the sleeping-pin into his clothes, and he fell down
near the edge of the water without sight or sense.

The three sisters came, and found him sleeping. They rubbed him, and
threw water on his face, but they could not wake him. And the three were
lamenting sorely, for they had brought a swan's skin with them that day,
so the king's son might make a swan of himself and fly away with them,
for this was their last day at that place; but they could do nothing
now, for he lay there dead asleep on the ground before them.

The eldest sister pulled out her handkerchief, and the falling tears
dropped on it. Then she took a knife, and cut one of the nipples from
her breast, The second sister wrote on the handkerchief: "Keep this in
mind till you get more account from us." They put it in his bosom and
went away.

As soon as the sisters had gone, the cowboy came, drew out the pin, and
hurried away. The stepmother was always trying to banish the king's son,
hoping that something might happen to him, and her own son be the heir.
So now he went off and wandered away through Erin, always inquiring for
the eldest sister, but never could find her.

At the end of seven years he came home, and was fishing at the side of
Loch Erne again, when a swan flew up to him and said: " Your love is
lying on her death-bed, unless you go to save her. She is bleeding from
the breast, and you must go to her now. Go straight to the East!"

The king's son went straight to the East, and on the way there rose up
storm and fog against him; but they did not stop him. He was going on
always, and when he was three weeks' journey from his father's castle he
stumbled one dark, misty day and fell over a ditch. When he rose up
there stood on the other side of the ditch before him a little horse,
all bridled and saddled, with a whip on the saddle. The horse spoke up
and said: "If you are the king's son, I was sent here to meet you, and
carry you to the castle of the king of the East. There is a young woman
at the castle who thinks it long till she sees you. Now ask me no
questions, for I'm not at liberty to talk to you till I bring you to the
East."

"I suppose we are to be a long time going?" said the king's son.

"Don't trouble yourself about the going; I'll take you safely. Sit on my
back now, and be sure you 're a good rider, and you 'II not be long on
the road. This is my last word."

They went on, and were going always; and as he travelled, the prince met
the wind that was before him, and the wind that blew behind could not
come up with him. When he was hungry the pommel of the saddle opened,
and he found the best of eating inside.

They went on sweeping over the world for two weeks, and when they were
near the East the horse said: " Get down from my back now, for it's
tired I am."

"How far are we from the castle? " asked the king's son.

"Five days' journey," answered the horse. "When you come to the castle,
don't stop a moment till you ask where the young woman is lying; and
tell them to be sure to give good stabling and food to the horse. Come
and see me yourself every day. If you don't, there will be nothing for
me but fasting; and that's what I don't like."

When the king's son came to the castle it was evening. The two younger
sisters welcomed him. (These were two of the swans at the lake in Erin,
and now at home by the enchantment of their stepmother. They were swans
in the daytime, and women only at night, so as not to be under the eye
of young men when these came to see the stepmother's own daughters.)
They said: " Our sister is on an island, and we'll go to her." They got
a boat for the young man, and went with him to where their sister was
lying. They said to her:

"The son of the king of Erin is here."

"Let him come in, that I may look at him," said she.

The king's son went in, and when she saw him she was glad. " Have you
anything that belongs to me?" asked she.

"I have."

"Then throw it on my breast."

He threw the handkerchief on her breast and went away. Next day she rose
from the bed as well as ever. On the third day after his arrival, the
son of the king of Erin married the eldest daughter of the king of the
East, and the stepmother's enchantment was destroyed; and there was the
grandest wedding that ever was seen in that kingdom.

The king's son, thinking only of his bride, forgot all about the horse
that had brought him over the long road. When at last he went to see
him, the stable was empty; the horse had gone. And neither his father in
Erin nor the stepmother came to his mind, he was living so pleasantly in
the East.

But after he had been there a long time, and a son and a daughter had
been born to him, he remembered his father. Then he made up his mind not
to let the stepmother's son be heir to the kingdom in place of himself.
So taking his wife and children, he left the East and travelled to Erin.
He stopped on the road, and sent word to the father that he was coming.

When the stepmother heard the news, a great weakness came on her. She
fell into a fit and died.

The king's son waited in a convenient place till the funeral was over,
and then he came to the castle and lived with his father. He was not
long in the place when he sent messengers to know could they find the
cowboy that the stepmother banished for telling about the sleeping-pin.
They brought the cowboy to the castle, and the king made him his
coachman.

The cowboy was not twelve months in his new place before he married.
Then the king's son gave him a fine piece of land to live on, with six
cows and four horses. There was not a happier man in the kingdom than
the cowboy. When the father died, the king's son became king in Erin
himself.
