\[*Under the following numbers I have grouped together a few traditions,
etc., relating to the Campbell legend of Diarmaid and the boar*.\]

### LIX.

### FIONN'S QUESTIONS.

From Donald MacPhie (smith), Breubhaig, Barra, 1860.

Fionn would not marry any lady but one who could answer all his
questions, and it appears that this was rather difficult to find.
Graidhne, daughter of the King of the fifth of Ullin, answered them all,
and proved herself the wisest as well as the handsomest of women. Fionn
married Graidhne because she answered the questions. The reciter told me
that there were a great many more, but that these were all that he could
remember at the time."

H. MACLEAN, October 20, 1860.

CEISDEAN MINN.

\[Seo na ceisdean.

*Graidhne*. Tha 'n druichd; bidh moran bhoineachan deth air aon ghas
feoir.\]

Fionn. What is more plenteous than the grass?

What is a ship for every cargo?

holding, but looking on him.

\[Dé 's deirge na fuil?  
Gnuis duine choir nuair thigeadh coigrich an rathad 's gun bhiadh aige
'bheireadh e dhaibh.\]

What is redder than blood?

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

\[Dé 's fearr do bhiadh?

beathachaidh e leanabh beag a's seanduine.\]

What is the best of food?

\[Dé 'n gniomh a's fhearr do ghniomhabh?  
Gniomh ard a's uaill iseal.\]

What deed is the best of deeds?  
A high deed and low conceit.

From this then it appears that Graidhne represents, quick wit and
beauty, and her name seems to mean Gràdh--love.

Fionn always represents wisdom.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

Mature wisdom marries young love, and in the stories which follow, love
runs away with young valour.

They followed the track which had been assigned to the Celtic race. They
are married in Eirinn, and in the next story, the course of their
wanderings is pointed out.
