### LXXXI.

### THE LAY OF OSGAR.

From Donald MacPhie, Smith, Breubhaig, Barra; and others.

IT was said at that time that Eirinn was the better chase than Albainn;
that there were many great beamed deer in it, rather than in this
Albainn. It was this which used to cause the Fhinn to be so often in
Eirinn; but true Albanian Gaul (Scotch highlanders) they were.

The red-haired Cairbre came in as king over the fifth part of Eirinn, at
the southern end. The Fhinn were now over in Eirinn, and Fionn had
dwelling-houses in every place in which it was most usual for them to
stay.

The ord Fhiann (hammer of Fionn) was a bell. It was not to be struck but
in time of great rejoicing, and in time of bard straits, and it could be
heard in the five-fifths of Eirinn.

They had a house on the land of the red-haired Cairbre, and they came on
the northern side of Eirinn to bunt.

Padruig was asking Oisean--

"Would their set of arms be on them when they went to hunt?"

Oisean said to him--

"Without our armour and our arms;  
We should not go to hunt like that.  
There would be arms, and stout headgear,  
And in each man's grasp were two great spears."

When the Fhinn went to hunt to the northward, they left Osgar to keep
the house, and three hundred of the old warriors with him, for they were
heavy for walking. Said Oisean, when he was going to tell the old story
to Padruig ( [346-a](pt335.htm#xref_346-a).md).

### LAOIDH OSGAIR.

Bha e air a radh 'san am ud gu 'm b'e Eirinn a b' fhearr sealg na
Albainn; gu 'n robh moran de dh' fheidh chabrach mhor innte seach an
Albainn seo. 'Se sin a bhiodh a' toirt do 'n Fhinn gu 'm biodh iad cho
tric an Eirinn; ach 'se fior Ghaidheil Albannach a bha annta.

Thainig an Cairbre ruadh a stigh 'na righ air a' choigeamh cuid de dh'
Eirinn air a' cheann deas. Bha 'n Fhinn 'san am seo thall an Eirinn, 's
bha tighean comhnuidh aig Fionn anns a' h-uile h-àite a bu tric leo a
bhith stad ann.

Clag a bha anns an ord Fhiannta. Cha robh e ri 'bhualadh ach an am
toil-inntinn mhoir, 'san am eigin chruaidh 's chluinnt' ann an coig
choigeamh na h-Eirionn e.

Bha tigh aca air fearann a' Chairbre ruaidh, 's thainig iad air an taobh
mu thuath de dh' Eirinn a shealgaireachd.

Bha Padruig a foighneachd de dh' Oisean,

"Am biodh an cuid arm orr' uile nuair a rachadh iad a shealgaireachd?"

Thuirt Oisean ris,

"Gun ar n-eideadh, 's gun ar n-airm,  
Cha rachamaid a shealg mar siud;  
Bhiodh airm, agus ceannabheart chorr,  
’S da shleagh mhor an dorn gach fir."

Nuair a chaidh an Fhinn a shealgaireachd do'n taobh tuath dh' fhag iad
Osgar a' gleidheadh an tighe 's tri cheud de na seann laoich comhla ris,
o bha iad trom gu coiseachd.

Thuirt Oisean nuair a bha e 'dol a dh' innseadh an t-seanachais do
Phadruig. ( [346-a](pt335.htm#xref_346-a).md)

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

1--OISEAN.

"I will not style my strain, 'my Prince,'  
How sad is Oisean to-night,  
Osgar and the Cairbre stalwart  
Ebb away in strife of corses. ( [344-1](pt335.htm#xref_344-1).md)

2

"The venomous spear in the hand of Cairbre,  
In anger's hour, how baneful was it;  
The raven would utter with fear,  
That with it should be slain the Osgar."

3--RAVEN.

"It is worse," to himself he'd say  
That black raven in his craze,  
"These five to be washing about a trough,  
Than blood of men to be gorging us."

4--OSGAR.

    .        .        .        .        .        .  
"Why should our own blood choke us?  
What weakness is on our eyelids?  
That we for such small cause should weep."

5--WASHERWOMAN.

"The raven will croak to-morrow early  
Upon thy cheek in the field of battle;  
From the socket thine eye shall be forced;  
Out of this thus much will come."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Said one of the old warriors, as she saw the hue of the blood on the
water that she had washing the clothes of Osgar.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

1--OISEAN.

"Cha 'n abair mi, mo thriath, ri m' cheol,  
Cia b' oil le Oisean e nochd;  
Osgar agus Cairbre calma,  
Traghar iad ann an cath cairbhre.( [344-1](pt335.htm#xref_344-1).md)

2

"An t-sleagh nimhe, 's i 'n laimh Chairbre,  
Gu'n craidhteach i ri uair feirge;  
Theireadh am fitheach ri 'ghiomh,  
Gur h-ann leatha 'mharbht' an t-Osgar."

3--FITHEACH.

"’S miosa theireadh e ris fhein,--  
Am fitheach dubh 'na mhi-cheill;  
A' choigear a' taiseadh mu ( [346-b](pt335.htm#xref_346-b).md) 'n chlar,  
Ach fuil fir a bhith 'gar tacadh.

4

"Com' an tacadh ar fuil fhein,  
De ghiamh a th' air ar rasgabh;  
Nuair a chaoineamaid chaol reachdaibh.

5--BEAN NIGHIDH.

"Gairidh am fitheach, moch a maireach,  
Air do ghruaidh-sa anns an araich.  
Cuireader do shuil a gluchd;  
As an sin a thig na h-uiread."

Arsa fear de na sean ii laoich, 's e 'faicinn dath na fala air an uisge
a bh' aice a' nigheadh aodach Osgair. ( [344-2](pt335.htm#xref_344-2).md)

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

"Surely it is a shroud thou washest  
Red is the look that is upon it,  
But until this day had come,  
That shroud's spaeing was not evil."

7---OSGAR.

"Thou witch there thy clothes that washest,  
Make for us a sure soothsaying;  
By us shall a man of them fall,  
Ere that we all go to nothing?"

8--SHE.

"Five hundred by thee shall die;  
Wounded by thee the king's self;  
Thus much, and a man of law (cut) off,  
Off the world all that came ( [346-c](pt335.htm#xref_346-c).md)."

9--OSGAR.

"Let him not hear thee, Rasg MacRuaidh,  
Nor one that belongs to his people;  
Let not the Een hear thee this night,  
Lest we be spiritless all."

10--OISEAN.

"Heard ye of the raid of Een,  
The time he wended to Eirinn;  
There came the fierce Carbre of spears,  
And grasped all Eirinn under sway.

11

"Away went we with eager hurry,  
As many Feen as were of us;  
We laid our army and our people  
On the northern side of Eirinn.

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

"’S dearbh gur n-aobh sin tha thu nigheadh,  
’S dearg an t-aogasg a tha orra;  
Ach gus an d' thainig an diugh  
An aobh sin cha b' olc a h-inneal.

7--OSGAR.

"A bhaobh sin, a nigheas t' aodach,  
Dean-sa dhuinne faisneachd chinnteach;  
An tuit aon duine dhiu leinn  
Ma'n d' theid sinn uile do neo-ni?

8--ISE.

"Marbhar leatsa coig ceud,  
A's gonar leat an righ fhein;  
Mar sin a's fear Lagha dheth ( [344-2](pt335.htm#xref_344-2).md)  
Bhar saoghail uile gu 'n d' thainig. ( [344-3](pt335.htm#xref_344-3).md)

9--OSGAR.

"Na cluinneadh e thu, Rasg MacRuaidh,  
Na duine 'bheanas dh' a shluagh;  
Na cluinneadh an Fhinn thu nochd,  
Ma 'm bi sinn uile gun mhisneach. ( [344-4](pt335.htm#xref_344-4).md)

10--OISEAN.

"An cuala sibhse turas Fhinn  
An uair a ghluais e gu h-Eirinn?  
Thainig an Cairbre sleaghach, garg,  
A's ghlac e Eirinn fo aon smachd.

11

"Dh' fhalbh sinne le than damhair,--( [344-5](pt335.htm#xref_344-5).md)  
A lion de'n Fhinn 's a bha dhinn;  
Leagadh leinn ar feachd, 's ar sluagh,  
Air an taobh mu thuath de dh' Eirinn.

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

12

"There was sent down by Cairbre  
Word for Feene's hardy Osgar,  
To go down to the Feen's carousal,  
And he would get his cess according.

13

"He rose who never baulked a foeman,  
The beauteous Osgar to the king's hearth,  
Three hundred stalwart men with him,  
To answer his will and need.

14

"We found honour, we found food,  
As we ever before had found;  
We were merrily within,  
With Cairbre in the house of the king."

15--CAIRBRE.

"Upon the last drinking day,"  
Said the Cairbre with a voice so high,  
"An exchange of spear-shafts I'd like from thee,  
Thou brown Osgar of the Alba."

16--OSGAR.

"What shaft's exchange wouldst thou wish,  
Thou red-haired Cairbre of the ports of ships?  
Oft were my spear and myself with thee,  
In the day of battle and combat (free)."

17--CAIRBRE.

"I'd need no less than cess and kain  
From any warrior your shores within,  
And I'd need no less for my life's term,  
Than to get as I ask for it every arm."

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

12

"Chuireadh le Cairbre 'nuas  
Fios air Osgar cruaidh na Finne,  
A dhol a dh' ionnsuidh fleadh na Finne,  
’S gu'm faigheadh e cis a reir sin.

13

"Dh' eirich, o nach d' ob e namhaid.  
An t-Osgar aluinn gu Leac Righ;  
Tri cheud fear treun dh' imich leis  
A fhreasdal dh' a thoil 's dh' a fheum.

14

"Fhuair sinn onair, fhuair sinn biadh,  
Mar a fhuair sinn roimhe riamh;  
Bha sinn gu subhach a steach  
Maille ri Cairbre 'san Teamraidh." ( [344-6](pt335.htm#xref_344-6).md)

15--CAIRBRE.

"An latha mu dheireadh dh' an ol"  
Thuirt an Cairbre le guth mor.  
"Iomlaid croinn sleagh b' aill leam uait  
Osgair dhuinn na h-Albann."

16--OSGAR.

"Gu de an iomlaid croinn a bhiodh ort,  
A Chairbre ruaidh nan long-phort?  
A's tric 'bu leat mi fhein 's mo shleagh  
An latha cath agus comhraig."

17--CAIRBRE.

"Cha b' uilear leamsa cis a's cain  
Bhar aon seoid a bhiodh 'nar tir;  
’S cha b' uilear leam ri m' linn a bhos,  
Gach seud a dh' iarrainn gu 'm faighinn."

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

18--OSGAR.

"In sooth, there's nor gold nor precious thing,  
That might be asked from us by the king,  
Without dishonour or disgrace,  
That were not thine, oh Tjeearnai's."

19

"But exchange of shafts without head's exchange,  
That were unjust to demand from us  
The reason thou hast asked it is,  
That I am without Een and father."

20--CAIRBRE.

"Although the Feene and thy father  
Were as good as they were ever;  
I'd need no less for my life's term,  
Than to get as I ask for it every arm."

21--OSGAR.

Were but the Feene and my father  
As well in life as they were ever  
That thou scarcely shouldest win  
Thy dwelling's breadth in Eirinn."

22--OISEAN.

"Coldness fell on the warrior's keen,  
At hearing the skirmishing;  
There were rough vows bandied there,  
Between the Cairbre and the Osgar."

23--CAIRBRE.

I will give a lasting vow,"  
So would say the red-haired Cairbre,  
That he'd plant the seven-edged spear ( [346-d](pt335.htm#xref_346-d).md)  
Between his reins and his navel.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

18--OSGAR.

"Cha n-'eil or, na earras, gu flor,  
A dh' iarradh oirnn an righ,  
Gun tair, na tailceas dhuinn e,  
Nach bu leatsa 'thighearnais." ( [344-7](pt335.htm#xref_344-7).md)

19

"Ach malairt croinn, gun mhalairt cinn,  
B' eucorach siad iarraidh oirnn;  
’S e'm fath mu 'n iarradh tu oirnn e  
Mise bhith gun Fhinn, gun athair."

20--CAIRBRE.

"Ged a bhiodh an Fhinn a's t' athair  
Co math 's a bha iad riamh 'nam beatha,  
Cha b' uilear leamsa ri m' linn,  
Gach seud a dh' iarrainn gu'm faighainn."

21--OSGAR.

"Na 'm biodh an Fhinn agus m' athair  
Cha math 's bha iad riamh 'nam beatha,  
’S teann air am faigheadh tu sin,--  
Leud do thaigh ann an Eirinn."

22--OISEAN.

"Lion fuarrachd na laoch loin  
Ri claistinn na h-iomarbhaidh:--  
Bha briathrin garbha, leith mar leith,  
Eadar an Cairbre 's an t-Osgar."

23--CAIRBRE.

"Bheireamsa briathar buan"  
’S e 'theireadh an Cairbre ruadh;  
Gu'n cuireadh e sleagh nan seachd seang
( [346-d](pt335.htm#xref_346-d).md)  
Eadar 'airnean agus 'imleag.

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

24

"Another vow against that,"  
So would say the Osgar valiant,  
That he'd plant the nine-edged spear  
About the shaping of face and hair.

RECITER.

The Cairbre had a place made in a pillar of rock, and there would not be
a bit of him out but his face.

25

"That lasting vow, then; that lasting vow,"  
So would say the red-haired Cairbre,  
That he would bring chase and sorrow  
To Albainn upon the morrow.

26

"Another vow against that,"  
So would say the Osgar valiant,  
That he'd plant the nine-edged spear  
About the shaping of face and hair.

27

"That night we were without aid,  
Hither and thither about the river  
There was an isthmus in the midst; ( [347-f](pt335.htm#xref_347-f).md)  
There was a great isthmus betwixt us.

28

"An olla was heard with a soft voice,  
On a sweet-toned harp, bewailing death  
Up rose Osgar in heavy wrath,  
And seized his arms in his mighty grasp.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

24

"Briathar eile 'n aghaidh sin,"  
’S e 'theireadh an t-Osgar calma;  
Gu'n cuireadh e sleagh nan naoi seang  
Mu chumadh fhuilt agus aodainn.

AM FEAR-AITHRIS.

Bha hit aig a' Chairbre, air a dheanadh ann an carragh creige, 's cha
bhiodh mir a mach deth ach an t-aodann.

25

"Briathar buan sin,--briathar buan,"  
’Se 'theireadh an Cairbre ruadh;  
Gu 'n d' thugadh e sealg agus creach,  
Do dh' Albainn an la'r na mhaireach.

26

"Briathir eile 'n aghaidh sin,"  
’Se 'theireadh an t-Osgar calma;  
Gu 'n cuireadh e sleagh nan naoi seang,  
Mu chumadh fhuilt agus aodainn.

27

"An oidhche sin duinne gun chobhair  
Thall agus a bhos mu 'n amhainn;  
Bha doirlinn leith mar leith, ( [347-f](pt335.htm#xref_347-f).md)  
Bha doirlinn mhor eadaruinn.

28

"Chualas Olla, le guth tim,  
Air chlarsaich bhinn a' tuireadh bàis.  
Dh' eirich Osgar ann am feirg,-  
’S ghlac e 'airm 'na dhornaibh aidh.

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

29

"Uprose we upon the morrow,  
The whole of our people, as many as we were;  
We raised a raid upon Sliabh Goill,  
So swiftly, actively, strongly.

30

"When we arrived there within  
The pass of combat of the narrow glen,  
Then warmed the Cairbre high,  
Brandishing, and coming to meet us.

31

"Five score of Gaidheal fierce,  
That came to land in time of storm;  
These fell yonder by the hand of Osgar,  
’Tis a rousing for the King of Eirinn.

32

"Five score of men and bows  
That came to Cairbre's succour;  
These fell yonder by the hand of Osgar,  
’Tis a rousing for the King of Eirinn.

33

"Seven score of men of war,  
That came from the snowy shore;  
These fell yonder by the hand of Osgar,  
The shame is for the king of Eirinn.

34

"Seven score men of gray glaives,  
That never went backwards a single pace,  
There fell yonder, by the hand of Osgar,  
The shame is for the King of Eirinn.

29

"Dh eirich sinn an la'r na mhaireach,--  
Ar sluagh uile,--sin na 'bha dhinn,  
Thog sinn creach air Sliabh Goill  
Gu luath, lasgarra, lughar.

30

"Nuair a rainig sinn ann,--  
Bealach comhraig nan caol ghleann,  
’S ann a bhlath an Cairbre ard,  
A' lannaireachd a' tighinn 'nar comhdail.

"Five score of a royal breed,  
Whose birthright was valour and great deeds,

"Mangan MacSeirc, ( [344-11](pt335.htm#xref_344-11).md) who was a foe  
That could combat a hundred gray glaives,  
That one fell yonder, by the hand of Osgar--  
The shame is for the King of Eirinn.

38

"The five who were nearest the king  
Of great valour and deeds,  
These fell yonder, by the hand of Osgar--  
The shame is for the King of Eirinn.

39,

"When the red-haired Cairbre saw  
Osgar a-hewing the people,  
The envenom'd dart in his hand  
He let it off to meet him.

40

"Osgar fell on his right knee,  
And the deadly spear through his waist;  
He gave another cast thither,  
And the King of Eirinn was slain by him.

41--CAIRBRE.

"Arise Art, and grasp thy glaive,  
And stand in the place of my father;  
And if thou get'st thy due of the world,  
I'll. think that thou art a king's son."

42--OISEAN.

"He gave another cast aloft,  
Its height appeared to us sufficient;  
There fell by him, by his aim's greatness,  
Art MacCairbre at the next spear cast."

RECITER.

The Cairbre was dead, and Osgar was upon his knees, and the spear
through him. Cairbre had a ceap made against the rock, and they put the
ceap (helmet) on the crag, so that Osgar might think he was alive.

43--OISEAN.

"They set about the king his ceap,  
Cairbre's people, rough in fight,  
That they might reap the fruit of the field,  
When they saw that Osgar was wounded.

44

"He lifted a slab from a hard plain,  
From off the earth of the ruddy side;  
He broke the pillar on which was the ceap,  
The last deed of my worthy son."

45--OSGAR.

"Raise me now with you, Eanna,  
Never before have you lifted me;  
Take me now to a clear mound,  
That you may strip off me my armour."

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

41--CAIRBRE.

"Eirich Art a's glac do chlaidheamh,  
A's seas ann an àite t' athar;  
’S ma gleibh thu do dhiol saoghail,  
Saoilidh mi gur mac righ thu."

42

"Thug c urchair eile 'n airde;--  
Air leinne gu 'm bu leoir a h-airde,  
Leagadh leis, aig mend a chuimse,  
Art MacChairbre air an ath urchair."

AM FEAR-AITHRIS.

Bha Cairbre marbh, 's bha Osgar air a ghluinean. ’san t-sleagh roimhe.
Bha *ceap* aig Cairbre air a dheanadh ris o' chreig, 's chuir iad an
ceap air a chreig, air dhoigh 's gu 'n saoileadh Osgar gu 'n robh esan
beo.

43

"There was heard at the northern strand,

Our warriors suddenly started,  
Before that Osgar was yet dead."

"Death's shrouds be about thee, thou victory's son,  
A second time will thou lie to us;  
These are my grandsire's ships,

"We all gave blessing to Fionn  
What though he saluted not us  
Until we reached the hillock of tears,  
Where was Osgar of the keen arms."

Fionn could heal any wound that might be on any being in the Een, unless
there should be poison in it.

"Worse, my son, wert thou for it,  
The battle-day of Bein Eidinn;  
The sickles might float through thy waist,  
It was my hand that made thy healing."

"That was the time that Fionn went  
Up to the mound above him;  
The tears streamed down from his eyelids,  
And he turned his back to us."

"My own calf, thou calf of my calf,

"The whining of the hounds by my side,  
And the wailing of the ancient warriors,

These were the things that pierced my heart-strings.

"So it was that I ever thought  
No fleshly heart was in my breast;  
But a heart of the holly spikes,

"Although it had been thou that fell  
In the battle of Corses, not scarce in deeds;  
Alas! in the east or the west ward,  
Groaning for thee would not be Osgar."

61--OISEAN.

"We raised with us lovely Osgar,  
On shoulders and on lofty spear-shafts;  
We had a glorious carrying  
Until we reached the house of Fionn.

"No wife would weep her own son,  
No man bewail his brother kind;  
As many as we were around the house,  
We were all bewailing Osgar."

Where in thy time was ever seen,  
One so hardy behind a blade."

(<span id="xref_344-7">344-7</span>) Tighearn, a lord, or proprietor of

in the same sense as majesty. Tighearn was evidently synonymous with
Righ, king, at one time, and is no doubt the same word as the Greek,
turannos, a king. H. M‘L.

(<span id="xref_345-19">345-19</span>) These lines are put in the mouth
of Oscar by some reciters, and in the version published by MacCallum,
which would imply that Oscar's fortitude gave way from the pain of his
wounds; but this is altogether inconsistent with the character ascribed
to Oscar in all Fenian tales and poems, while, on the contrary, when
uttered by Fionn, the loftiest heroism that can be conceived is
represented; the steel-encased holly heart overpowered by deep feeling;
the stern, indomitable old captain completely subdued by the tears of
warm and generous affection. H. M‘L.

Part of this poem was recited to me by Patrick Smith, South Boisdale,
South Uist, September 17, 1860. The whole of it as written here,
excepting a few lines peculiar to Smith's version, was got from Donald
MacPhie, smith, Breubhaigh, Barra, October 1, 1860. It seems to be a
fragment of a much larger poem, some peculiar ancient drama. The
commencement is rather obscure, and it is not easy to make sense of some
of the lines. H. M‘L.

(<span id="xref_345-20">345-20</span>) This abrupt termination seems to
indicate more to follow, or a repetition of the first line, which seems
to be the usual termination of these poems. J. F. C.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

(<span id="xref_346-a">346-a</span>) This introduction is curious. The
Irish tradition is, that Scotland was the hunting ground of Fionn. The
lay is part of a dialogue between the old poet and St. Patrick, which
savours of Irish extraction; but Barra is a Roman Catholic district.

(<span id="xref_346-b">346-b</span>) Moistening, Taiseadh. This seems to
refer to some ancient method of soothsaying connected with washing
clothes. In broad Scotch it is mentioned in an old song, which I quote
from memory-

My droukit sark sleeve I was waulking,  
His likeness cam ben the house stalkin',  
        The verra grey breeks o' Tam Glen."

\[paragraph continues\] In [Brittany](errata.htm#12.md) (Foyer Breton, vol.
i., 144), the night washerwomen (kannérez-noz) were a troop of ghosts,
which appeared on a certain night in November. They washed, they dried,
and they sewed the shroud of the dead who yet walk and talk, singing,--

"Till there come Christians' saviour,  
We must bleach our shrouds,  
Under the snow and the wind."

\[paragraph continues\] They asked passengers to help to wring the wet
sheets, and if a man turned the clothes with them it was well, if he
turned against them he was crushed, and died.

Taisbean, s.m., means a vision, an apparition.

Taisbein, v.a., to reveal.

Taisgeal, s.m., the finding of something lost, and I have heard "an
Taistear" used as a term of opprobrium. The collector is unable to
explain the passage, but this seems to be an imperfect explanation of
it. The raven has been a soothsayer time out of mind.

(<span id="xref_346-c">346-c</span>) This 8th stanza seems imperfect,
and it is very hard to make any sense of it as it stands, but supposing
that I am right in my explanation, this might be an exclamation of the
mystic washerwomen previous to their disappearance. See note (2), page
[344](#page_344.md).

(<span id="xref_346-d">346-d</span>) ’Seang probably refers to the
slender, sharp, tough, qualities of a spear. Three slender points and
three thin edges make a barbed head, and a tough springy shaft makes a
spear of seven "seang," add to that a couple of slender cords for
throwing the weapon, of which there are traces in Irish stories; and we
have

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

a spear of nine "seang," Blenders, and a phrase similar to the "binding
of the three smalls."

(<span id="xref_347-f">347-f</span>) This line is given in Armstrong's
dictionary under the word doirlinn.

(<span id="xref_347-g">347-g</span>) The geese might float. This, taken
literally, is absurd, and is at variance with the spirit of the rest of
the poem. I suspect, therefore, that the word which now means geese, and
nothing else must have had some other meaning, as the word which means
herons in verse 49 also means any crooked cutting instrument. It might
be gaoithe, winds, and suggest the idea of the breath escaping from the
wound.
