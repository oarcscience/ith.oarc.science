### LX.

### DIARMAID AND GRAINNE. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1)

From Hector MacLean, July 6th, 1859. Told by an old man in Bowmore,
Islay, Alexander Macalister.

FIONN was going to marry Grainne, the daughter of the king of Carmag in
Eirinn. The nobles and great gentles of the Feinne were gathered to the
wedding. A great feast was made, and the feast lasted seven days and
seven nights; and when the feast was past, their own feast was made for
the hounds. Diarmaid was a truly fine man, and there was, BALL SEIRC, a
love spot, on his face, and he used to keep his cap always down on the
beauty spot; for any woman that might chance to see the ball seirce, she
would be in love with him. The dogs fell out roughly, and the heroes of
the Feinn went to drive them from each other, and when Diarmaid was
driving the dogs apart, he gave a lift to the cap, and Grainne saw the
ball seirc and she was in heavy love for Diarmaid.

She told it to Diarmaid, and she said to him, "Thou shalt run away with
me."

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

"I will not do that," said Diarmaid.

"I am leaving it on thee as a wish; and as spells that thou go with me."

"I will not go with thee; I will not take thee in softness, and I will
not take thee in hardness I will not take thee without, and I will not
take thee within; I will not take thee on horseback, and I will not take
thee on foot," said he; and he went away in displeasure, and he went to
a place apart, and he put up a house there, and he took his dwelling in
it.

On a morning that there was, who cried out in the door but Grainne, "Art
thou within, Diarmaid?"

"I am."

"Come out and go with me now."

"Did I not say to thee already that I would not take thee on thy feet,
and that I would not take thee on a horse, that I would not take thee
without, and that I would not take thee within, and that I would not
have anything to do with thee."

She was between the two sides of the door, on a buck goat. "I am not
without, I am not within, I am not on foot, and I am not on a horse; and
thou must go with me," said she. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2)

"There is no place to which we may go that Fionn will not find us out
when he puts his hand under his tooth of knowledge, and he will kill me
for going with thee!"

"We will go to Carraig (a crag, Carrick?) and there

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

are so many Carraigs that he will not know in which we may be."

They went to Carraig an Daimh (the stag's crag).

Fionn took great wrath when he perceived that his wife had gone away,
and he went to search for her. They went over to Ceantire, and no stop
went on their foot, nor stay on their step, till they reached Carraig an
Daimh in Ceantire, near to Cille Charmaig, Diarmaid was a good
carpenter, and he used to be at making dishes, and at fishing, and
Grainne used to be going about selling the dishes, and they had beds
apart.

On a day that there was there came a great sprawling old man the way,
who was called Ciofach Mae a Ghoill, <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3)
and he sat, and he was playing at DINNSIREAN (wedges. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4)) Grainne took a liking for the old earl, and
they laid a scheme together that they would kill Diarmaid. Diarmaid was
working at dishes. The old man laid hands on him, and he turned against
the old man, and they went into each other's grips. The old man was
pretty strong, but at last Diarmaid put him under. She caught hold of
the, GEARRASGIAN, knife, and she put it into the thigh of Diarmaid.
Diarmaid left them, and he was going from hole to hole, and he was but
just alive, and he was gone under hair and under beard. He came the way
of the Carraig and a fish with him, and he asked leave to roast it. He
got a cogie of water in which he might dip his fingers, while he was
roasting it. Now there would be the taste of honey or anything which
Diarmaid might touch with his finger, and he was dipping his fingers

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

into the cogie. Grainne took a morsel out of the fish <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5) and she perceived the taste of honey upon
it. To attack Diarmaid went Ciofach, and they were in each other's grips
for a turn of a while, but at last Diarmaid killed Ciofach, and away he
went, and he fled, and he went over Loch a Chaisteil.

When Grainne saw that Ciofach was dead she followed Diarmaid, and about
the break of day, she came to the strand, and there was a heron
screaming. Diarmaid was up in the face of the mountain, and said
Grainne--

"It is early the heron cries,  
On the heap above Sliabh gaoil,  
Oh Diarmaid O Duibhne to whom love I gave,  
What is the cause of the heron's cry?

"Oh Ghrainne, daughter of Carmaig of Steeds,  
That never took a step aright,  
It seems that before she gave the cry.  
Her foot had stuck to a frozen slab. <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6)

"Wouldst thou eat bread and flesh, Diarmaid

"Needful were I of it if I had it."

"Here I will give it to thee; where is a knife will cut it?"

"Search the sheath in which thou didst put it last," said Diarmaid.

The knife was in Diarmaid ever since she had put it into him, and he
would not take it out. Grainne drew out the knife, and that was the
greatest shame that she ever took, drawing the knife out of Diarmaid.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

Fear was on Diarmaid that the Fheinn would find them out, and they went
on forwards to Gleann Eilg.

They went up the side of a burn that was there, and took their dwelling
there, and they had beds apart. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)

Diarmaid was making dishes, and the shavings which he was making were
going down with the burn to the strand.

The Fiantan were hunting along the foot of the strand, and they were on
the track of a venomous boar that was discomfiting them. Fionn took
notice of the shavings at the foot of the burn.

"These," said he, "are the shaving of Diarmaid."

"They are not; he is not alive," said they.

"Indeed," said Fionn, "they are. We will shout Foghaid? a hunting cry,
and in any one place in which he may be, he is sworn to it that he must
answer."

Diarmaid heard the Foghaid.

"That is the Foghaid of the Fiantan; I must answer."

"Answer not the cry, oh Diarmaid,  
It is but a lying cry." <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8)

Diarmaid answered the shout, and he went down to the strand. It was set
before Diarmaid to hunt the boar. Diarmaid roused the boar from Bein
Eidin to Bein Tuirc. <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9)

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

While drawing down the long mountain,  
The brute was bringing Diarmaid to straits.  
His tempered blades were twisted  
Like withered rushy plaits.

Diarmaid gave a draw at the slasher that Lon Mac Liobhain <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10) made, and he put it in under the armpit
and he killed the boar.

This was no revenge for Fionn yet over Diarmaid. There was a mole on the
sole of the foot of Diarmaid, and if one of the bristles should go into
it, it would bring his death.

Said Fionn--

"Oh Diarmaid, measure the boar,  
How many feet from his snout to his heel?

Diarmaid measured the boar.

"Sixteen feet of measure true."

Measure the boar against the hair."

He measured the boar against the hair, one of the bristles went into the
mole and he fell.

Fionn took sorrow for him when he fell. "What would make thee better,
Diarmaid

"If I could get a draught of water from the palms of Fionn I would be
better."

Fionn went for the water, and when he thought on Grainne he would spill
the water, and when he would think of Diarmid, he would take sorrow, and
he would take it with him; but Diarmaid was dead before Fionn
returned. <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11)

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

They walked up the side of the burn till they came to where Grainne was;
they went in; they saw two beds, and they understood that Diarmaid was
guiltless. The Fein were exceedingly sorrowful about what had befallen.
They burned

Grainne, daughter of Carmaig of steeds  
That never took a step aright,  
In a faggot of grey oak.

This story then, under a very rough exterior, embodies the main
incidents and some lines of the poem which follows.

The last story, No. LIX., got in Barra, started the heroine in Ireland.
This, got in Islay, starts her in Ireland and brings her through
Ceantire into Lorn and to Glen Elg, opposite to Skye.

The next, the Lay of Diarmaid, got from several people in Uist and
Barra, seems to leave the place of the catastrophe uncertain, but
Bein-Gulban is the haunt of the heroes, and Irish writers say that
Bein-Gulban is Bein-Boolban in Sligo.

In the manuscript histories of the Argyll family, Diarmaid's sons are
made to possess Carrick.

The only points in which the tale and poem published by Dr. Smith agree
are those of the death of Diarmaid. It is so long since I read Dr.
Smith's Sean Dana that I have but a faint recollection of the poem. The
tale would seem to me to be partly a parody on the poem. These old
people are sometimes confused in reciting these tales, probably much is
lost, and from confusion of memory some may be altered. At times they
cannot recite

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

at all. Shaw, from whom I got Murchadh Mac Brian, died a few days ago,
and, so far as I can ascertain, there is none in Islay, Jura, or
Colonsay, that can recite the same tale now.

H. MACLEAN.

Ballygrant, July 6th, 1859.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[49:1](pt305.htm#fr_1) The name is so spelt in
this MS., and it is so spelt in Irish books.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[50:1](pt305.htm#fr_2) This incident may be
compared with a German story Die-kluge Baueren-tochter. Grimm, No. 94.
See vol. iii., p. 170, for numerous references to versions of the story
in a great many languages. I have had two versions of the story in
Gaelic--one from Mr. MacLauchlan, the other from an old man in Barra.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[51:1](pt305.htm#fr_3) Ciofach, the son of the
stranger. This personage, who plays this part in another version, is
called "Cuitheach."

<span id="fn_4"></span>[51:2](pt305.htm#fr_4) Or DISNEAN, dice?

<span id="fn_5"></span>[52:1](pt305.htm#fr_5) There seems to be
something mythical about this fish, for he appears in various shapes in
the legend.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[52:2](pt305.htm#fr_6) There seems to be a hidden
meaning in the reply.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[53:1](pt305.htm#fr_7) Glen Elg, opposite the
narrows between Skye and the mainland. There are two "Pictish towers" in
a glen which would answer to the description, and there are many legends
of the Feinn localised about that spot.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[53:2](pt305.htm#fr_8) This is a line of the poem
which follows, given as a sentence in a prose tale; and other lines
occur which I have written as poetry when I thought I could recogmise
them.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[53:3](pt305.htm#fr_9) Two well known Scotch
mountains.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[54:1](pt305.htm#fr_10) This sword maker is
known by this name in the Isle of Man, and is there called the dark
smith of Drontheim.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[54:2](pt305.htm#fr_11) In Dr. Smith's Sean
Dana, page 3 (1787), is this note on the Poem of Diarmaid. "A long
dialogue concerning Cuach Fhinn, or the medicinal cup of Fingal, often
repeated here, is rejected as the spurious interpolation of some later
bard."

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span> The scene is often laid on the ridge
between Oban and Loch Awe, and I well remember to have heard how Fionn
held his palms to Diarmaid filled with water from a spring which is
still shewn, and how a draught from the hollow palms would have healed
the dying warrior; but Fionn thought on Graidhne and opened his hands
and let the water drain away, as he held his hands to Diarmaid's mouth,
and Diarmaid died. J. F. C.
