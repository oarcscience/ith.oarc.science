### FABLES.

I am told on good authority, that stories in which beasts play a chief
part are perhaps the most interesting of all in a scientific point of
view. I accordingly give a few here, which should belong to No. XVII. in
Vol. I. They will serve as a contrast to the heroic traditions with
which I had intended to fill this third volume. Their value consists in
their close resemblance to well-known stories, found elsewhere amongst
peasants, and published in modern times, and in their possessing traits
of their own, which seem to indicate that they are parallel traditions
derived from a common source; not stories derived from others, and
following in their wake.

For example, the whole of the incidents in the story of the Fox and the
Wolf are to be found in Grimm; but they are separated. Some of the
incidents are also in the Norse tales; but the Gaelic tale fits Highland
ways of life exactly, and the story is so

widely spread in the Highlands, and can be traced so far back, that it
seems almost impossible that the unlettered men who tell it to their
children should have got it from modern books which they could neither
read nor understand.
