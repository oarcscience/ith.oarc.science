### LXVII.

### CAOL REIDHINN.

#### WHY THE NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT.

From Mr. Alex. Carmichael, (excise officer), Islay.

ON a certain time, when the Feinn had come home from the chase to the
house of Farabhuil, at the foot of Farabhein in Ardnamurchan, they were
much astonished to find their wives so lusty, fair, and comely; for the
chase was very scarce at the time with the Feinn.

The Feinn determined that they would know what their wives were getting
to make them thus; and when they went away again to the chase, they left
Conan, one of themselves, at the house, so that he might find this out.

Conan kept a watch, and the meat that they had was

the hazel top boiled, and they were drinking the bree. It is said
besides that they used to wash themselves with this.

The women understood that it was to watch them that Conan had been left
at the house, and they were in a great fury.

In the night when Conan laid down to sleep, they tied his hair to two
stakes which they drove into the earth on either side of his head. Then
the women went out to the front of the house, and they struck their
palms with a great lament, till they awoke Conan.

Conan sprang on foot with great haste, but he left part of his hair and
of the hide of his head fast to the stakes.

When Conan got the women within, he set fire to heather and faggots in
front of the house, so that he might kill the women with the smoke.

The Feinn were at this time opposite to the house of Farabheil on the
other side of Caol Readhin (Kyle Ray), and when they saw the fire and
the smoke rising up, they cried out loudly, striking their left hands on
the front of their faces, with their eyes on the sky.

Then they ran to succour their set of wives, but the strait was between
them; but with their blades they leaped the strait, (all) but one Mac an
Reaidhinn (Ramsay). Mac an Reaidhinn fell in the strait and he was
drowned; and since then to this day's day, (the name of) Reaidhinn's
Strait has stuck to the narrows.

Valour so swiftly for wives of the Feinn,  
And each one sprang on the point of his spear;  
And they left Mac an Reaidhinn in the strait.

By good fortune the women all came through it but one or two of them,
for the Feinn made mighty running

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

to succour them. The Feinn were in great fury against Conan for what be
had done, and they seized him to put him to death. Conan asked as a
favour that the head should be taken off him with MAC AN LUINNE that
would not leave a shred behind, the sword of Fionn MacDhuil (MacDuguld),
and that his own son Garbh should smite him on the thigh of Fionn.

With earnest entreaty I would; ask it  
And my soul's privation to seek it;  
The son of Luinne to reap my soul  
Upon the thigh of the sense of the Feinn.

This was allowed him, but first seven gray hides and seven faggots of
firewood, and seven "*tiruin*" of gray bark were laid about the thigh of
Fionn.

Then the head of Conan was laid on that, and GARBH, his son, struck the
head off him with MAC AN LUINNE--

And folds in the palm were not more plenteous  
Than severed thews in the thigh of Fionn.

Then GARBH asked them where were the Feinn, for he had gone mad; and
they said to him that they were below beneath him. Then he went down
till he reached the sea, and he slashed at it till he drowned himself.
