### LXXII.

### THE HOODIE AND THE FOX.

THE hoodie and the fox were good at early rising, and they laid a wager
with each other, for which should soonest get up in the morning. The
hoodie went into a tree top, and she slept; and the fox staid at the
foot of the tree, looking aloft (to see) when the day would come. As
soon as he perceived the day he cried,

"Sê-n-lAbAn-ê." It is bright day.

The hoodie had never stirred all the night, and then she awoke with the
cry, and she answered, "SAd-o-bê-ê, SAd-o-bê-ê." It's long since it was.
Then the fox lost the wager and the hoodie won.
