### LXXVIII.

### THE MASTER AND HIS MAN.

From John Dewar.

THERE were at some time ere now bad times, and there were many servants
seeking places, and there were not many places for them.

There was a farmer there, and he would not take any servant but one who
would stay with him till the end of seven years, and who would not ask
for wages, but what he could catch in his mouth of the seed corn, when
he should be thrashing corn in the barn.

None were taking (service) with him. At last he said that he would let
them plant their seed in the best ground that he might have, and they
should get his own horses and plough to make the thraive, and his own
horses to harrow it.

There was a young lad there, and he said, "I will take wages with thee,"
and the farmer set wages on that lad, and the bargain that they made was
that the wages which the lad was to have were to be as many grains of
seed as he could catch in his mouth when they were beating sheaves in
the barn, and he was to get (leave) to plant that seed in the best land
that the farmer had, and he was to keep as much as grew on that seed,
and to put with it what seed soever he might catch in his mouth when he
was thrashing the corn, and to plant that in the best land which the
farmer had on the next year. He was to have horses, and plough, or any
other "gairios" <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) he might want for
planting or reaping from

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

his master, and so on to the end of the seven years. That he should have
seen winters in the barn thrashing, seven springs to plant, seven
summers of growth for the crop, and seven autumns of reaping, and
whatsoever were the outcoming that might be in the lad's seed, that was
the wage that he was to have when he should go away.

The lad went home to his master, and always when he was thrashing in the
barn his master was thrashing with him, and he caught but three grains
of seed in his mouth on that winter; and he kept these carefully till
the spring came, and he planted them in the best land the carle had.

There grew out of these three ears, and there were on each ear
threescore good grains of seed.

The lad kept these carefully, and what grains soever he caught be put
them together with them.

He planted these again in the spring, and in the autumn again he had as
good as he had the year before that.

The lad put his seed bye carefully, and anything he caught in his mouth
when he was thrashing in the next winter he put it with the other lot;
and so with the lad from year to year, till at last, to make a long
story short, the lad planted on the last year every (bit of) ploughing
land that the carle had, and he had more seed to set, and the carle was
almost harried. He had to pay rent to the farmer who was nearest to him,
for land in which the lad might set the excess of seed which he had, and
to sell part of his cattle for want of ground on which they might
browse, and he would not make a bargain in the same way with a servant
for ever after.

This story only wants a moral to be a regular fable, and the meaning is
so clear that to express it by a moral would be waste of words.
Scotchmen, all over, the world, are noted for frugality, and here is the
lesson taught by a Celtic peasant to his son. I suspect there has been a
numerical puzzle upon the numbers 3, 7, and 20, which is lost. Words
relating to agriculture are interesting, and this gives a number of
them. I subjoin an attempt at phonetic spelling.

Siol, *sheel*; seed, the young of fish, oats, etc. etc.

Crann, *kr*A*n*; a tree, a plough, a mast, etc., etc.

Cliathadh, *Klee*A*ug*; harrowing, from cliath, basket work of any kind,
a bush harrow, from which it follows that ploughs and harrows were made
of wood.

Treabh, *Treo*; to till, plough, probably from troimh, through a
thraive, a furrow. Sanscrit root, TRA, [an](errata.htm#11.md) instrument of
any kind, a plough.

Biceannan, Beeganan; grains, beating, small, diminutive, Bigan.

Bualadh, BooAlug; thrashing beating, striking, hitting.

Sabhal, *SAvul* or *SA-ul*; a barn.

Arbhar, *Ar*A*r*; corn as reaped, standing corn. Sanscrit root, AR, to
plough, to cut open; to plough the sea. Gaelic, Eithir, a boat.

Ire, *Eere*; land, also produce. Sanscrit, IRA, earth.

Earrach, *Yarach*; spring, caring time.

Cur, *Coor*; to plant, to put, to set.

Cinneas, *Keenyas*; growth, also kin.
