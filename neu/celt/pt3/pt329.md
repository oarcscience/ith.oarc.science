### STORY OF THE KING OF SPAIN.

Said he--"My name is Garna Sgiathlais Righ na Iospainde (Garna
Skeelance, king of Spain.) <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md) Let me
tell you the hardest strait in which I ever was.\]

|          |
|----------|
| MacNair. |

I was once a warrior, and the deeds of a warrior were on my hand well
enough, and I was on my way to the dun of the king of Laidheann to take
out Breast of Light with right strong hand; and I saw Mac a-Mor, son of
the king of the Sorcha, and the most beauteous drop of blood that I ever
saw upon his shoulder. I never saw a woman that I would rather wish to
have for

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

myself than that woman. I was working with my own sword at him as high
as the band of his kilt. He had but the one duan (song) for me--'Wilt
thou not cease, and wilt thou not stop?' but I gave no heed to
him. <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md)\]

|           |
|-----------|
| MacNeill. |

He fell upon me, and he bound me, and fettered me, and set me on the
horse before him, and he took me to the top of a rock. The rock was
high, and he threw me down the rock, and if I had fallen to the bottom I
had gone to little morsels, but so it was that I fell into the nest of a
dreagan. <span id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105.md) When I came to myself I
looked about me, and I saw three great birds in the nest, and I held my
hands and my feet to them, as they were bound, until they loosed them;
the monsters! that they might tear me asunder.\]

|            |
|------------|
| MacGilvray |

I saw a cave at the back of the nest, and I dragged myself into the
cave, and when the old dreagon would come and leave food for the young
ones, I would stay till the old dreagan would go, and then I would come
out and I'd take the food from the young dreagans; that was all I had to
keep alive upon. But at last the young dreagans found death for want of
food. The old dreagan understood that something was eating their food,
and she ransacked all about the nest, and she went into the cave. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_106.md)\]

|          |
|----------|
| MacNair. |

She seized me then in her talons; she sailed to the back of the ocean
with me; and she sprang to the clouds with me, and I was a while that I
did not know which

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

was heaven or earth for me, nor whether she would let me fall in the
drowning sea, or on rocks of hardness, or on cairns of stones;\]

|          |
|----------|
| MacNair. |

she was lifting me and letting me down, till she saw that I was soon
dead, on the breast of the sea. Though I was not heavy, when I took the
brine I was heavy indeed; and when she was lifting me she was spent. She
lifted me with her from the surface of the sea as I was dead, and she
sailed with me to an island, and the sun was so hot; and she put me
myself on the sun side of the island. Sleep came upon herself, and she
slept. The sun was enlivening me pretty well though I was dead.\]

|          |
|----------|
| MacNeill |

She had come down at the side of a well, and when she awoke she began at
working herself about in the well. I understood that there was
iocshlaint, healing in the well, because of how the side of me that was
nearest to the well was healing with the splashes of water that the
dreagan was putting from her. And I moved the other side of me towards
the well, till that side was healed also. Then I felt for my sword; my
sword had always stuck by me; <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md) and
I got it, and I rose up and I crept softly (eallaidh mi) to the back of
the dreagan, and with the sword I struck off her head. But it was but
simple to strike off her head, by keeping it off. The balsam that was in
the well was so strong that though the head should be struck off her, it
would spring on again, till at last I got the sword held between the
head and neck, till the hag's-marrow froze, and then I got the head and
neck driven asunder.\]

|          |
|----------|
| MacNair. |

I did not leave a thong of her uncut, and that is the death that went
nearest to me, till the blood dried throughout the island,\]

|           |
|-----------|
| MacNeill. |

and when the blood

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

dried I put the dreagan into the well, and I went and I washed myself in
it; and so it was that it seemed to myself that I grew stronger and more
active than I had ever been before. And the first exploit (gaisge) that
I tried to do after that, was to try to contend against the King of
Lochlann; and it would have gone with me hadst thou not been here. And
my being cast into the nest of the dreagan, and what I bore before I got
out, is a harder strait and a worse extremity, in my esteem, than to be
under the board of the King of Lochlann and thine."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[251:1](pt329.htm#fr_103.md) It is not easy to put
a meaning on these names; there are two Gaelic words which are like
Sgiathlais, and which have appropriate meanings; one means winging
about, the other storytelling. MacNeill gives neither name nor country.
It might mean "Cut of the tale-telling," because the episode cuts the
story in two. Old MacPhie did not give it.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[252:1](pt329.htm#fr_104.md) MacNair mounts him on
a horse. Macgilvray makes him the king of the universe.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[252:2](pt329.htm#fr_105.md) MacNeill says, Cro
mhineach, which is a vast bird like an eagle to be found in stories all
over the world. Macgilvray says Ghri Mhineach greeveen-each, and I have
no doubt the word is the same as Griffin.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[252:3](pt329.htm#fr_106.md) The other version is
the same, less the cave, and there was but one chick.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[253:1](pt329.htm#fr_107.md) Claidheamh beag chorr
na sgeithe, the little sword of the crook of the shield, according to
MacNeill.
