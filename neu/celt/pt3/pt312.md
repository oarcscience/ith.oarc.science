### LXII.

### HOW THE FOX TOOK A TURN OUT OF THE GOAT.

From Hector Boyd, Barra.

THERE was a gray goat and she had kids, and if she had, the fox went on
a day around them, and he caught them, and he killed them, and he ate
them. Then the goat came home, and she was black melancholy and
miserable when she came and was without them before her. She took on her
way and she reached the house of the russet dog, and she went up on the
top of the house, and the fox cried out--

"Who is that on top of my bothy, maiden my deary,  
That will not leave my caldrons to boil,  
That will not leave my bonnachs to bake,  
And that will not let my little one go to the well?"

GOAT.

"There is me gray goat, harried out,  
Seeking the three kindly kidlings,  
And the gray-bellied buck,  
And the buck lad."

FOX.

"Well then; by the earth that is beneath,  
By the aether over head,  
By the sun that is gone down,  
That I have never seen thy set of kids."

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

There was no bird in the flock that she did not go to and she returned
home and she did not get them.

This story is known to that section of the poorer Gaelic population,
which is, and which has been young; but though everybody knows it,
nobody will tell it. I persuaded an old woman on the banks of Loch
Hourn, to tell it to me in part, and so far as it went her version was
better.

Chaidh a gbobhar ghlas don traigh  
Agus, bhrisd strabh a cas.

The gray goat went to the strand, and a straw broke her leg, and when
she came home there were

Na tri minneana mine-glas  
Taraigna taraghlas  
Driomana driomaghlas  
Agus am boc ceannaglas.

The three kindly kidlings-gray,  
With bellies gray bellied,  
And with backs gray back-ed,  
And the buck gray-head.

And the ram (something, which I forget); and a whole party besides, whom
my informant would not name; all gone away. And she went to the fox, and
his clearing oath was:--

Air an draigheann air an dreas  
Air an talamh fo mo chois  
Air a ghrian seachad siar  
Cha 'n fhaca, mise riamh  
Do chuid meann.

By the blackthorn and the briar,  
By the earth beneath my foot, <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>  
By the sun that has gone West,  
I have never never seen  
    Thy set of kids.

It is manifest that there is a great deal more of this, but I have not
got it. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[105:1](pt312.htm#fr_16.md) May 1861.--I have
received a much better version from Mr. Alexander Carmichael, from
Carbost in Skye. The fox, disguised as the goat, after several trials
gets in, and eats the kids. The goat goes to the houses of the gull,
hoodie, and sheep, and at last to the fox. He lets her in, eats up a
caldron of food, gives her none, and makes her scratch his paunch. The
goat rips him up, out come the kids, and they go home. The rhymes are
curious and whole very original.
