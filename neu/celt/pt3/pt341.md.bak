### DUAN NA CEARDACH, ETC.

From Malcolm MacPhail, Scanlistle, aged eighty years. Learnt it from
Alexander MacQueen, Persabas, sixty years ago. MacQueen was past eighty
years of age at that time.

2\.

Chunnacas a teachd ar coir,  
Fear mor agus air aona chois;  
Le a mhantal dubh ciardhubh craicinn;  
Le 'ionnar lachduinn 's le ruadh bheairt.

2-New verse.

Aon suil mholach an clar aodainn  
’Se sior dheanadh air MacChumhail,  
"Co thu fhein?" arsa MacChumhail;  
Na cia as duit?"

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

3--GOBHA. New.

"Thainig mis' 'ur cur fo gheasaibh,--  
Seisear de mhaithibh na Feinne,  
A bhith 'gam ruith gun easraich  
Siar gu dorus mo cheardach."

4-New,

Thug e as mar ghaoth an earraich  
Mach ri beannaibh dubha 'n t-sleibhe.

10

Cha d' thugadh e ach an aona cheum.  
Thar gach aon ghleann fuarraidh, fasaidh;  
’S cha 'n fhaiceadh tu ach air eigin  
Cearb d' a eideadh thar a mhasan.

FIONN RI CAOILTE.

"Freagair agus sin do chasan,  
’S gabh sgeula de 'n rugha." <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207.md)

11

A' tearnadh aig Alltan a' chuimir,  
Fosgladh gu 'n d' thug an gobha,  
"Na druid romhan," arsa Doorghlas.

7

CAOILTE.

"A rugha cait am bheil do cheardach?  
Na 'm b' fheairde sinne g' a faicinn?"

GOBHA.

"Mo cheardach cha 'n 'eil ri fhaotainn,  
’S ma dh' fhaodas mise cha'n fhaic sibh."

14

Labhair gobha de na goibhnean,  
Le curam mor agus le gruaim;  
"A righ co 'm fear caol gun tioma, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_208.md)  
A shineas an sineadh cruadhach?"

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

15--FIONN.

A righ gu meal thu t' ainm a Chaoilte  
Cha bhi Daorghlas ort o'n uair seo."

New.

A' Chruaidh Chosgarrach lann Osgair,  
An Leadarnach mhor lann Chaoilte,  
Mac an Luin aig Fionn MacChumhail,  
Nach fag fuigheall de dh' fheoil dhaoine.

2--Various.

There was seen nearing us  
A big man upon one foot,  
With his black dusky black skin mantle,  
With his hammering tools, and his "steel lathe."

New verse--follows the 3d.

One shaggy eye in his forehead,  
Making ever for MacChumhail,  
"Who is thyself," said MacChumhail,  
"Or whence art thou?"

New verse--follows the 4th.

"I came to lay you under enchantments,  
Six of the chiefs of the Feinne,  
To be chasing me without hurry,  
West to the door of my workshop."

7--Half new verse; follows 7th.

He set off like the wind of the spring time,  
Out to the dark mountains of the high grounds.

10

He would take but a single step,  
O'er each single cold glen of the desert  
Thou could'st have seen but hardly  
A tuck of his clothing o'er his hurdies.

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

FIONN TO CAOILTE. New--follows 10.

Answer and stretch thy legs,  
And take a tale of the blacksmith.

Rugha is a smith according to the reciter. Raute is a Lapp nickname for
a smith, as I learned on the Tana, where I took the sketch of the
skin-clad smith, whose portrait I give as an illustration. (*See
Frontispiece*.)

Here the old man forgot his poem, but remembered a bit of his story.

"When Caoilte was at full speed, thou might'st see three heads on him.
His two shoulders would be rising aloft, as though there were two heads,
and his head would be crouching down, he would be going as it seems half
bent." At vol. ii., 425, this occurs in the tale of the white chief, and
this explains what I did not understand.

Then he went on with a few lines of verse.

11

Descending by the streamlet of the Shaper,  
    .       .       .       .       .       .  
At the opening that the smith made,  
"Shut not before me," said Daorghlas.

7--CAOILTE.

"Oh, Rugha, where is thy workshop,  
Or should we profit to see it?"

SMITH.

"My smithy is not to be found out;  
And if I may, see it you shall not."

14--Various.

Out spoke a smith of the blacksmiths,  
With great care and a grim frown,  
"King! who is the slender fearless man,  
That will stretch the tempered bar."

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

15--FIONN.

King! mayst thou snatch the name,  
Thou shalt not be Daorghlas from this hour."

19--Partly new; follows 19.

"Victorious hardness," Osgar's blade,  
"The big slasher," the blade of Caoilte,  
"Mac-an-Luin" was Fionn MacChumhail's,  
That never left a shred of the flesh of man.

Here this poem ends, so far as this old man is concerned; but enough
remains to prove that he did not borrow from Gillies or MacCallum, for
there are several lines and some verses which are not to be found in the
books.

It is also manifest that there is a great deal missing. In the Lay of
Diarmaid, he says that he was one of the party; his sword is mentioned
here, but he is not.

MacLean writes:--"At the end of this verse. MacPhail relates that the
arms required to be tempered in the blood of a living person; that the
smith's daughter took a fancy to Fionn, who had a love spot (which was
Diarmaid's property), and that she told him, unless he killed her father
with the sword, that her father would kill him. This Fionn accordingly
did. This is different from the usual story, according to which the
sword is tempered in the blood of the old woman, the smith's mother.
Probably the variation may be owing to forgetfulness on the part of
MacPhail, caused by old age and by having had a paralytic stroke last
winter."

"This was when they got the arms; they had before but 'Tunnachan,' they
were sticks with sharp ends made on them, and these ends burned and
hardened in the fire. They used to throw them from them, and

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

they could aim exceedingly with them, and they could drive them through
a man. They used to have a bundle with them on their shoulders, and a
bundle in their oxters. I myself have seen one of them that was found in
a moss, that was as though it had been hardened in the fire."

This then gives the popular notion of the heroes, and throws them back
beyond the iron period.

"There was a great day of battle between themselves and the Lochlanners,
which was called Latha nan Tunnachan, the day of the stakes. I have
heard old men speaking of it, and it was down thereabouts, about Chnoc
angail that they gave it. They had a great day there."

This then fixes the period; at the time of the wars with Lochlann in
Islay.

"It was in the side of a knoll at Alltan a chuirin that the fairy smith
had his smithy."

"There was a great carlin once in Lochlann. It is Muirearteach maol
ruadh that. they used to say to her. She came from Lochlann, and she
brought a smithy and the smith (ceardach agus an Gobha) with her on her
back to sharpen the spears; she was but a witch, but the Fheinn slew
her. Said the King of Lochlann when he heard this"--here comes in verse
23 of the poem given already, page [144](pt323.htm#page_144.md), with the
English word sink introduced, and a few variations; and this joins the
lay of the witch to the lay of the smithy.

"The Lochlanners were difficult (that is, cross and fierce); and they
had so much iodramanach and witchcraft that it is thus they used to do
much of their valour."

"Goll was the strongest man that was in the Fheinn, and he could eat
seven stags at his dinner. Fionn was

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

a patient worthy man, and they used always to take his counsel. Fionn
and Osgar, Goll and Oisean, four 'postaichean' of the Feinne, the high
law people, Luchd ladh."

This would seem to explain how three generations fill such a large space
in Celtic popular tradition. If the names of the original warriors
became the names of offices or officers they may have been Celtic gods
at first and commanders of Irish, Scotch Scandinavian, and British
Feinne afterwards, in the third century and in the twelfth. There were
many Osgars at the battle of Gaura, and Fionn, who is killed in one
century, is all alive the next.

"Fionn was not a king over land, he was but a chief over the men."

"Was there any other name said to him but Righ na Feinne, king of the
Fane?"

"There was not."

"It is Conan who was the weakest man that was in the Fheinn, because
they used to keep him maol (cropped). He had but the strength of a man,
but if the hair should get leave to grow there was the strength of a man
in him for every hair that was in his head; but he was so cross that if
the hair should grow be would kill them all. He was so short-tempered
(ath-ghoirid) that he used to be always fighting with them."

So all accounts agree; and Kai, Arthur's attendant, was of the same
disposition.

"When Goll would be in great rage the one eye would come 'dorn gulban'
out, and the other eye would go 'dorn gulban' in. I think myself that
his appearance would not be beautiful then."

Neither narrator, scribe, nor translator knows what "dord gulban" means,
but Conall *Gulban* struck *dorn* a fist on a man, and knocked his eye
out on his cheek.

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

"Did you ever hear," what Righ Mhor bheinn (king of Morven, of great
hills), said to Fionn?

"I have heard it," (chual). This was put as an experiment to try the
effect of a leading question, and it produced a contradiction; but he
might have heard the name and have forgotten it till reminded.

"They would be always staying over at Fas Laigheann, at Goirtean taoid,
when they were in this island (Islay), and the place for the caldron is
there yet, and they say that the caldron is buried there. It is Eas
Laigheann nan sruth seimh that they used to call it--lin of Laigheann of
the still streams--they were so fond of it. They had no house at all
there."

This joins Gaelic to Welsh and Irish traditions, for this caldron is
often mentioned, and it upsets Scotch and Irish topography altogether.

"There came a woman on them there once from the westward, and they said
to her--

Tha sinne 'cur mar choran 's mar gheasan ort,  
Gu 'n innis thu, co thu fhein na co do mhuinntir?  
'S mise nighean righ na Sorchann,  
Sgiath an airm;  
'S gur h-e 's ainm dha 'm Baoidhre borb;  
'S gu 'n d' thoir e mise leis,  
Cia mor bhur treis as an Fhéinn.  
Cia b' fhada 'n oidhche gu latha,  
Cha bu ghna leinn 'bhith gun cheol.

We lay it as a circuit and as spells on thee.  
That thou tell us who thou art, or thy people.  
I am the daughter of the king of Sorchann, <span
id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) <span id="page_416">p. 416</span>  
Shield of armies,  
And that his name is Baoidhre borb,  
And that be will take me with him.  
Though great our time from the Fane,  
Though long be the night to day,  
It was not our wont to be without music.

"They were is such a great (iomagain) trouble about the man who was
coming that they did not set up any music."

"'We will rise out in the morning,' said they, 'to see who is coming
upon us.'"

Chunnucas a' teachd ar coir fear mor air steud chiar-dhubh,
rionna-gheal, a' coiseachd air an fhairge, staigh as an aird an iar.

Cuireamaid ar combairle ri cheile,  
Feuch co 'ghabhas sgeula de 'n oigear.  
Labhair Goll le curam mor as le gruaim,  
Co 'theid fo m' sgéith-sa chumail diom nam buillean cruadhach.

Bhuail am fear a thainig beum sgéithe 's dh' iarr e comhrag coig ceud
laoch. Leum an deo as a' mhnaoi an an taobh eile dhiu leis an eagal.

"There was seen coming near us a great man on his dun black,
white-haired steed, walking on the sea, in from the western airt.

'Let us lay our counsel together,  
See who will take a tale from the youth,'  
Spoke Goll, with great care and a frown,  
'Who will go under my shield to ward off the tempered strokes.'

"The man who came struck a shield blow, and he asked for a battle of
five hundred heroes. The life leaped out of the women on the other side
of them for fear.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

"They killed him at last.

Thiodhlaicear aig braigh an eas,  
Fear mor bu mhor meas agus miadh;  
Chuir Fionn MacCumhail fainn oir,  
Air gach meur aig an onair an righ.

They buried at the top of the lin  
The great man of great honour and esteem.  
Fionn MacChumail put a golden ring  
On each of his fingers in honour of the king.

"I saw a man in Goirtean taoid (in Islay), and he found one of the rings
on the point of his sock when he was ploughing--Murchadh MacNeacail. It
was one of the old Highland ploughs he had. There were great long beaks
on them. The carle got much money for the ring."

Now this is the story of the well-known poem of Fainesoluis, localized
in Islay, and the finding of a gold ring assumed to be proof positive of
its exact truth by the old man who tells it. I also have a gold ring
which was found in Islay with a lot of others. It is said that the
finder made handles for a chest of drawers of these gold rings, and that
a pedlar gave him a fine new brass set in exchange for the old ones,
which he carried off and sold. Some of them are said to be in the museum
at Glasgow, one I have, and the rest were probably melted. I know of
several discoveries of gold rings, chains, etc., made in Islay. Now it
is possible that this tradition of the Feinne may be true. The story is
in Dean MacGregor's MS. as a poem of 161 lines, attributed to Ossian in
1530. It is claimed by Irish writers as Moira Borb, 1789, in vol. v. of
the Ossianic Society's transactions, 1860.

I have three traditionary versions as poems, one

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

written down in September 1860, in Barra, called MacOighre Righ na
lor-smàil; eighty-four lines from Donald MacPhie, Breubhaig, who says he
learned it from Hector MacLaine (smith), an uncle of his who could
neither read nor write, and who died aged about eighty some twenty years
ago. In this, Padruig and Oisean, and Fionn, and Fionn's four sons, and
Osgar, and the daughter of the king under the waves, and a big man who
comes in a ship, are the actors. The language is curious, and the poetry
good. I regret extremely that I have no room for it.

The other is from Patrick Smith, South Boisdale, South Uist; an old man
who learned it in his youth from Roderick MacVicar, North Uist,
seventy-three lines, Macabh Mor Mae-Righ na Sorcha. The story is the
same, but Padruig does not appear. The burial of the hero at the top of
a lin with rings on his fingers is given, which is in the Dean's
version. The last line,

Tha sgeul beag agum air Fionn,

is the first and last line in the Dean's, and generally my version and
this fragment and the Dean's might be fused so as to make a more
complete story, and a longer and perfectly genuine poem in Scotch
Gaelic. The third version is called Dan na H-ighean, and has eighty-four
lines, written by Mr. Torrie in Benbecula, from the dictation of Donald
Macintyre, who learned it some fifty years ago from an old man who
afterwards went to America, John MacInnes or Iain og MacFhionlai. This
joins Scotch and Irish traditions, MacPherson's Ossian, with genuine
traditions and old MSS., and joins poetry to prose tales.

"There was a young lad in the Fheinn, who was called Coireall, and he
used always to be in the house

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

of the women, because he had not come to the age of a man. It is Goll
that had Mir mora na Feinne, the great morsel of the Fane, that was
every bit of marrow that was in every bone to be gathered together and
brought to him. Coireall came in, and he took with him some of the
marrow, and he and Goll fell out (went over each other). The law that
Fionn made, was, that they should drive bones through the wattled rods
that were dividing the house, and the one with whom the bone should go,
the marrow to be his."

This is the common partition in Highland cottages, rods woven into a
kind of rude basket-work, and plastered with clay. Rob Roy's house at
the head of Glenshira, near Inverary, is so divided.

They did that, and Goll dragged Coireall through the wattled rods with
the bone.

After that they went to try each other to the strand (cladach), and
Coireall won of Goll, and he left the woman's house."

Cluiche ri cluiche nan soc,  
Cluiche nan corcan 's nam bian;  
A' chulaidh chomhraig a bh' aig an dis  
Cha 'n fhaca mi roimhe riamh.

Each game to the game of the ends,  
The game of the whittles and skins,  
The battle array that these two had,  
I never before have seen.

This then paints the dwellings of the heroes as very rude, and gives the
clue to another poem which I have: sixty lines of very good popular
poetry, describing how Goll slew Coireall at a merrymaking, and how
Fionn lamented over his son, and why he hated Goll thenceforth. I have
not found this in any book as yet.

"It must be that the Feinn were strong?"

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

"Hoo! They were as strong as the horses. There was one who was called
Mileach Mor, and he sent word for them at once, and the chase fallen
short. When they arrived, they were put into a long house there, and
they were without anything. A big black girl came in, and she asked a
battle of warriors from them."

"Let me get to her," said Conan.

Conan went, and she seized him, and she floored him, and she plucked
three of her hairs, and she bound his three smalls. Then she went out,
and they loosed Conan. She came in again, and she sought a battle of
warriors, "Let me get at her," said Conan.

"What canst thou do?" said they to him. They let him go, and she floored
him, and this time she did something else to him, and then she went out.

They killed the Mileach Mor, and they had the keep of a day and a year
there.

This joins an Islay tradition to one published by Mr. Simpson in 1857,
as current in Mayo (see pages 235 and 242), and it also joins in with a
great many other stories which I have in manuscript, and with Magach
Colgar, No. xxxvi., and so to ancient MSS. now in the Advocate's
Library. And thus one old Highlander with a failing memory, but who can
still remember some scraps of what he learned in his youth, and could
remember in his manhood, forms one mesh in a net-work of tradition, and
manuscript and print; history and mythology, prose and poetry, which
joins the whole Gaelic family together, extends over three centuries,
and may be found to join them to the earliest records of the Pagan
world. This is no solitary case. The man is a specimen of a class which
survives in far-away corners, but which must soon vanish before modern
ways, together with the Gaelic language.
