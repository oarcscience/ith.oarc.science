<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HOODIE AND THE FOX.</H3>
<P>THE hoodie and the fox were good at early rising, and they laid a wager with each other, for which should soonest get up in the morning. The hoodie went into a tree top, and she slept; and the fox staid at the foot of the tree, looking aloft (to see) when the day would come. As soon as he perceived the day he cried,</P>
<P>"S&ecirc;-n-lAbAn-&ecirc;." It is bright day.</P>
<P>The hoodie had never stirred all the night, and then she awoke with the cry, and she answered, "SAd-o-b&ecirc;-&ecirc;, SAd-o-b&ecirc;-&ecirc;." It's long since it was. Then the fox lost the wager and the hoodie won.</P>
