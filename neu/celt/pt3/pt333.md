### LXXIX.

### THE PRAISE OF GOLL.

From Donald MacPhie, Breubhaig, Barra.

There came a stranger the way of the Finne, and he asked what sort of
man Goll was, and Fionn said--

1 High mind of Goll, Fionn's man of war,

2 Broad, burly hero, dauntless and hardy;

3 Fair generous hero, of sweetest speech.

4 His mildness mild, harmless his grace.

5 Of brightest mood, teacher of schools.

6 King-like is Goll, hide it not Fionn.

7 Might of the waves, by valour bright.

8 Lion like hind, valiant in deed.

9 Powerful his hand, choice of the kings.

10 Man friendly kind, forsakes not his friend.

11 In strife of kings, not slack his hand.

12 Crushing his shout, hound-like his might.

13 Youthful and soft, warlike and great.

From Donald MacPhie, Breubhaig, Barra, who says he learnt it from his
uncle, Hector MacLaine, Breubhaig, Barra. October I, 1860.--H. M‘L.

This is a traditional fragment of the poem given at page 29 of the
selections from the Dean of Lismore's MSS. 1530. Of the thirteen lines
here given, nine are almost identical with the Gaelic, as given by Mr.
MacLauchlan. There are seventy-one lines in the oldest version. The
corresponding numbers are here placed opposite to the lines for
reference. Another version is printed in Gillies' collection, 1784. Page
34, there are eighteen lines, of which thirteen appear here slightly
modified, and in a different order. There are considerable variations in
several of the lines, for example, damhail, friendly, is deud-gheal,
white-toothed. A fourth version, eighteen lines, was published by
MacCallum, 1816, and has five lines which I have not.
