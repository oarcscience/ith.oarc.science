NOTES ON TRANSCRIPTION: In the original book all titles and subheadings
were left aligned. I have centered these in the etext. Also, none of the
paragraphs were indented, which makes cross-page paragraph continuations
between sentences difficult to recognize. Thus, only intra-sentence
paragraph continuations have been marked.--JBH
