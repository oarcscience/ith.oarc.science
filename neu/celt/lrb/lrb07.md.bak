# CHAPTER IV: SPRITES AND DEMONS OF BRITTANY

THE idea of the evil spirit, malicious and revengeful, is common to all
primitive peoples, and Brittany has its full share of demonology.
Wherever, in fact, a primitive and illiterate peasantry is found the
demon is its inevitable accompaniment. But we shall not find these
Breton devils so very different from the fiends of other lands.

### The Nain

The nain is a figure fearsomely Celtic in its hideousness, resembling
the gargoyles which peer down upon the traveller from the carven
'top-hamper' of so many Breton churches. Black and menacing of
countenance, these demon-folk are armed with feline claws, and their
feet end in hoofs like those of a satyr. Their dark elflocks, small,
gleaming eyes, red as carbuncles, and harsh, cracked voices are all
dilated upon with fear by those who have met them upon lonely heaths or
unfrequented roads. They haunt the ancient dolmens built by a vanished
race, and at night, by the pale star-light, they dance around these
ruined tombs to the music of a primitive refrain:

"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  
Thursday and Friday."

Saturday and Sunday they dare not mention as being days sacred from
fairy influence. We all remember that in the old tale of Tom Thumb the
elves among whom the hero fell sang such a refrain. But wherefore? It
would indeed be difficult to say. Deities, credited and

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

discredited, have often a connexion with the calendar, and we may have
here some calendric reference, or again the chant may be merely a
nonsense rhyme. Bad luck attached itself to the human who chanced to
behold the midnight revels of the nains, and if he entered the charmed
circle and danced along with them his death was certain to ensue before
the year was out. Wednesday was the nains' high-day, or rather night,
and their great *nuit festale* was the first Wednesday in May. That they
should have possessed a fixed festival at such a period, full of
religious significance for most primitive peoples, would seem to show
that they must at one time have been held in considerable esteem.

But although the nains while away their time in such simple fashion as
dancing to the repetition of the names of the days of the week, they
have a less innocent side to their characters, for they are forgers of
false money, which they fabricate in the recesses of caverns. We all
recall stories of fairy gold and its perishable nature. A simple youth
sells something on market day to a fairy, and later on turning over in
his pocket the money he has received he finds that it has been
transformed into beans. The housewife receives gold from a fairy for
services rendered, and carefully places it in a drawer. A day when she
requires it arrives, but, alas! when she opens the cabinet to take it
out she finds nothing but a small heap of withered leaves. It is such
money that the nains manufacture in their subterranean mints--coin which
bears the fairy impress of glamourie for a space, but on later
examination proves to be merely dross.

The nains are also regarded as the originators of a cabalistic alphabet,
the letters of which are engraved

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

on several of the megalithic monuments of Morbihan, and especially those
of Gavr’inis. He who is able to decipher this magic script, says
tradition, will be able to tell where hidden treasure is to be found in
any part of the country. Lest any needy folk be of a mind to fare to
Brittany to try their luck in this respect it is only right to warn them
that in all probability they will find the treasure formula in ogham
characters or serpentine markings, and that as the first has long ago
been deciphered and the second is pure symbolism they will waste their
time and money in any event.

Sorcery hangs about the nain like a garment. Here he is a prophet and a
diviner as well as an enchanter, and as much of his magic power is
employed for ill, small wonder that the Breton peasant shudders and
frowns when the name of the fearsome tribe is spoken and gives the
dolmens they are supposed to haunt the widest of wide berths *au clair
de la lune*.

### Crions, Courils, and Gorics

Brittany has a species of dwarfs or gnomes peculiar to itself which in
various parts of the country are known as crions, courils, or gorics. It
will at once be seen how greatly the last word resembles Korrigan, and
as all of them perhaps proceed from a root meaning 'spirit' the nominal
resemblance is not surprising. Like the nains, these smaller beings
inhabit abandoned Druidical monuments or dwell beneath the foundations
of ancient castles. Carnac is sometimes alluded to in Breton as 'Ty
C’harriquet,' 'the House of the Gorics,' the country-folk in this
district holding the belief that its megalithic monuments were reared by
these manikins, whom they describe as between two and three feet high,
but

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

exceedingly strong, just as the Scottish peasantry speak of the Picts of
folk-lore-'wee fouk but unco’ strang.' Every night the gorics dance in
circles round the stones of Carnac, and should a mortal interrupt their
frolic he is forced to join in the dance, until, breathless and
exhausted, he falls prone to the earth amid peals of mocking laughter.
Like the nains, the gorics are the guardians of hidden treasure, for the
tale goes that beneath one of the menhirs of Carnac lies a golden hoard,
and that all the other stones have been set up the better to conceal it,
and so mystify those who would discover its resting-place. A
calculation, the key to which is to be found in the Tower of London,
will alone indicate the spot where the treasure lies. And here it may be
of interest to state that the ancient national fortalice of England
occurs frequently in Breton and in Celtic romance. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) Some of the immigrant Britons into
Armorica probably came from the settlement which was later to grow into
London, and may have carried tales of its ancient British fortress into
their new home. The courils are peculiar to the ruins of Tresmalouen.
Like the gorics, they are fond of dancing, and they are quite as
malignantly inclined toward the unhappy stranger who may stumble into
their ring. The castle of Morlaix, too, is haunted by gorics not more
than a foot high, who dwell beneath it in holes in the ground. They
possess treasures as great as those of the gnomes of Norway or Germany,
and these they will sometimes bestow on lucky mortals, who are
permitted,, however, to take but one handful. If a person should attempt
to seize more the whole of the money vanishes, and the offender's ears
are soundly boxed by invisible hands.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

The night-washers (*eur tunnerez noz*) are evil spirits who appear at
night on the banks of streams and call on the passers-by to assist them
to wash the linen of the dead. If they are refused, they seize upon the
person who denies them, drag him into the water, and break his arms.
These beings are obviously the same as the Bean Nighe, 'the Washing
Woman' of the Scottish Highlands, who is seen in lonely places beside a
pool or stream, washing the linen of those who will shortly die. In Skye
she is said to be short of stature. If any one catches her she tells all
that will befall him in after life. In Perthshire she is represented as
"small and round and dressed in pretty green."

### The Teurst

In the district of Morlaix the peasants are terribly afraid of beings
they call teursts. These are large, black, and fearsome, like the
Highland ourisk, who haunted desert moors and glens. The *teursta
poulict* appears in the likeness of some domestic animal. In the
district of Vannes is encountered a colossal spirit called Teus or
Bugelnoz, who appears clothed in white between midnight and two in the
morning. His office is to rescue victims from the devil, and should he
spread his mouth over them they are secure from the Father of Evil. The
Dusii of Gaul are mentioned by St Augustine, who regarded them as
*incubi*, and by Isidore of Seville, and in the name we may perhaps
discover the origin of our expression 'the deuce!'

### The Nicole

The Nicole is a spirit of modern creation who torments the honest
fishermen of the Bay of Saint-Brieuc and

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Saint-Malo. just as they are about to draw in
their nets this mischievous spirit leaps around them, freeing the fish,
or he will loosen a boat's anchor so that it will drift on to a
sand-bank. He may divide the cable which holds the anchor to the vessel
and cause endless trouble. This spirit received its name from an officer
who commanded a battalion of fishermen conscripts, and who from his
intense severity and general reputation as a martinet obtained a bad
reputation among the seafaring population.

### The Mourioche

The Mourioche is a malicious demon of bestial nature, able, it would
seem, to transform himself into any animal shape he chooses. In general
appearance he is like a year-old foal. He is especially dangerous to
children, and Breton babies are often chided when noisy or mischievous
with the words: "Be good, now, the Mourioche is coming!" Of one who
appears to have received a shock, also, it is said: "He has seen the
Mourioche." Unlucky is the person who gets in his way; but doubly so the
unfortunate who attempts to mount him in the belief that he is an
ordinary steed, for after a fiery gallop he will be precipitated into an
abyss and break his neck.

### The Ankou

Perhaps there is no spirit of evil which is so much dreaded by the
Breton peasantry as the Ankou, who travels the duchy in a cart, picking
up souls. In the dead of night a creaking axle-tree can be heard passing
down the silent lanes. It halts at a door; the summons has been given, a
soul quits the doomed house, and the

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

wagon of the Ankou passes on. The Ankou herself--for the dread
death-spirit of Brittany is probably female--is usually represented as a
skeleton. M. Anatole le Braz has elaborated a study of the whole
question in his book on the legend of death in Brittany, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) and it is probable that the Ankou is a
survival of the death-goddess of the prehistoric dolmen-builders of
Brittany. MacCulloch <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) considers the
Ankou to be a reminiscence of the Celtic god of death, who watches over
all things beyond the grave and carries off the dead to his kingdom, but
greatly influenced by medieval ideas of 'Death the skeleton.' In some
Breton churches a little model or statuette of the Ankou is to be seen,
and this is nothing more nor less than a cleverly fashioned skeleton.
The peasant origin of the belief can be found in the substitution of a
cart or wagon for the more ambitious coach and four of other lands.

### The Youdic

Dark and gloomy are many of the Breton legends, of evil things, gloomy
as the depths of the forests in which doubtless many of them were
conceived. Most folktales are tinged with melancholy, and it is rarely
in Breton story that we discover a vein of the joyous.

Among the peaks of the Montagnes d’Arrée lies a vast and dismal peat bog
known as the Yeun, which has long been regarded by the Breton folk as
the portal to the infernal regions. This Stygian locality has brought
forth many legends. It is, indeed, a remarkable territory. In summer it
seems a vast moor carpeted by, glowing purple heather, which one can
traverse up to a

THE DEMON-DOG  

 

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

certain point, but woe betide him who would advance farther, for,
surrounded by what seems solid ground, lies a treacherous quagmire
declared by the people of the neighbourhood to be unfathomable. This
part of the bog, whose victims have been many, is known as the Youdic.
As one leans over it its waters may sometimes be seen to simmer and
boil, and the peasants of the country-side devoutly believe that when
this occurs infernal forces are working beneath, madly revelling, and
that it is only the near presence of St Michael, whose mount is hard by,
which restrains them from doing active harm to those who may have to
cross the Yeun.

Countless stories are afloat concerning this weird maelstrom of mud and
bubbling water. At one time it was the custom to hurl animals suspected
of being evil spirits into its black depths. Malevolent fiends, it was
thought, were wont to materialize in the form of great black dogs, and
unfortunate animals of this type, if they evinced such peculiarities as
were likely to place them under suspicion, were taken forthwith to the
Youdic by a member of the enlightened priesthood of the district, and
were cast into its seething depths with all the ceremonies suitable to
such an occasion.

A story typical of those told about the place is that of one Job Ann
Drez, who seems to have acted as sexton and assisted the parish priest
in his dealings with the supernatural. Along with the priest, job
repaired one evening after sunset to the gloomy waters of the Youdic,
dragging behind him a large black dog of the species most likely to
excite distrust in the priestly mind. The priest showed considerable
anxiety lest the animal should break loose.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

If he should get away," he said nervously, "both of us are lost."

"I will wager he does not," replied Job, tying the cord by which the
brute was led securely to his wrist.

"Forward, then," said the priest, and he walked boldly in front, until
they came to the foot of the mountain on the summit of which lies the
Youdic.

The priest turned warningly to Job. "You must be circumspect in this
place," he said very gravely. "Whatever you may hear, be sure not to
turn your head. Your life in this world and your salvation in the next
depend absolutely on this. You understand me?" "Yes, sir, I understand."

A vast desolation surrounded them. So dark was the night that it seemed
to envelop them like a velvet curtain. Beneath their feet they heard the
hissing and moaning of the bog, awaiting its prey like a restless and
voracious wild beast. Through the dense black ness they could see the
iridescent waters writhing and gleaming below.

"Surely," said Job half to himself, "this must be the gateway to hell!"

At that word the dog uttered a frightful howl-such a howl as froze job's
blood in his veins. It tugged and strained at the cord which held it
with the strength of a demon, striving to turn on job and rend him.

"Hold on!" cried the priest in mortal terror, keeping at a safe
distance, however. "Hold on, I entreat you, or else we are undone!"

Job held on to the demon-dog with all his strength. Indeed, it was
necessary to exert every thew and sinew if the animal were to be
prevented from tearing him to pieces. Its howls were sufficient to
strike terror to the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

stoutest heart. "Iou! Iou!" it yelled again and again. But Job held on
desperately, although the cord cut his hands and blood ran from the
scarified palms. Inch by inch he dragged the brute toward the Youdic.
The creature in a last desperate effort turned and was about to spring
on him open-mouthed, when all at once the priest, darting forward, threw
his cloak over its head. It uttered a shriek which sounded through the
night like the cry of a lost soul.

"Quick!" cried the priest. "Lie flat on the earth and put your face on
the ground!"

Scarcely had the two men done so than a frightful tumult ensued. First
there was the sound of a body leaping into the morass, then such an
uproar as could only proceed from the mouth of the infernal regions.
Shrieks, cries, hissings, explosions followed in quick succession for
upward of half an hour; then gradually they died away and a horrible
stillness took their place. The two men rose trembling and unnerved, and
slowly took their way through the darkness, groping and stumbling until
they had left the awful vicinity of the Yeun behind them.
