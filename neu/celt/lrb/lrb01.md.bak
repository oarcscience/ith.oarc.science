# PREFACE

ALTHOUGH the folk-tales and legends of Brittany have received ample
attention from native scholars and collectors, they have not as yet been
presented in a popular manner to English-speaking readers. The probable
reasons for what would appear to be an otherwise incomprehensible
omission on the part of those British writers who make a popular use of
legendary material are that many Breton folk-tales strikingly resemble
those of other countries, that from a variety of considerations some of
them are unsuitable for presentation in an English dress, and that most
of the folk-tales proper certainly possess a strong family likeness to
one another.

But it is not the folk-tale alone which goes to make up the romantic
literary output of a people; their ballads; the heroic tales which they
have woven around passages in their national history, their legends
(employing the term in its proper sense), along with the more literary
attempts of their romance-weavers, their beliefs regarding the
supernatural, the tales which cluster around their ancient homes and
castles--all of these, although capable of separate classification, are
akin to folk-lore, and I have not, therefore, hesitated to use what in
my discretion I consider the best out of immense stores of material as
being much more suited to supply British readers with a comprehensive
view of Breton story. Thus, I have included chapters on the lore which
cleaves to the ancient stone monuments of the country, along with some
account of the monuments themselves. The Arthurian matter especially

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

connected with Brittany I have relegated to a separate chapter, and I
have considered it only fitting to include such of the *lais* of that
rare and human songstress Marie de France as deal with the Breton land.
The legends of those sainted men to whom Brittany owes so much will be
found in a separate chapter, in collecting the matter for which I have
obtained the kindest assistance from Miss Helen Macleod Scott, who has
the preservation of the Celtic spirit so much at heart. I have also
included chapters on the interesting theme of the black art in Brittany,
as well as on the several species of fays and demons which haunt its
moors and forests; nor will the heroic tales of its great warriors and
champions be found wanting. To assist the reader to obtain the
atmosphere of Brittany and in order that he may read these tales without
feeling that he is perusing matter relating to a race of which he is
otherwise ignorant, I have afforded him a slight sketch of the Breton
environment and historical development, and in an attempt to lighten his
passage through the volume I have here and there told a tale in verse,
sometimes translated, sometimes original.

As regards the folk-tales proper, by which I mean stories collected from
the peasantry, I have made a selection from the works of Gaidoz,
Sébillot, and Luzel. In no sense are these translations; they are rather
adaptations. The profound inequality between Breton folk-tales is, of
course, very marked in a collection of any magnitude, but as this volume
is not intended to be exhaustive I have had no difficulty in selecting
material of real interest. Most of these tales were collected by Breton
folk-lorists in the eighties of the last century, and the native
shrewdness and common sense which

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

characterize much of the editors' comments upon the stories so carefully
gathered from peasants and fishermen make them deeply interesting. It is
with a sense of shortcoming that I offer the reader this volume on a
great subject, but should it succeed in stimulating interest in Breton
story, and in directing students to a field in which their research is
certain to be richly rewarded, I shall not regret the labour and time
which I have devoted to my task.
