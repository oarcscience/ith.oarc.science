# Legends and Romances of Brittany

## by Lewis Spence

#### \[1917\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a popularized treatment of the folklore of Brittany, the Celtic
region on the north-western coast of France, Spence, who wrote a number
of other books in this series, recounts tales of knights, kings and
saints, some more or less historical in nature, others set in the
timeless land of the fairy-tales. Brittany also has extensive lore of
fairy-folk, including several unique species, such as the Korrigan,
Nain, Goric, and the dread Ankou, a female spirit of death. In addition,
Brittany is the setting (and possibly the origin) of some of the
Arthurian tales, particularly those of Tristram and Percival. One of the
rarer of Spence's books, Legends and Romances of Brittany is an
enjoyable read in spite of the sometimes grim subject matter.
