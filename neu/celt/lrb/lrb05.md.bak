# CHAPTER II: MENHIRS AND DOLMENS

IN the mind of the general reader Brittany is unalterably associated
with the prehistoric stone monuments which are so closely identified
with its folk-lore and national life. In other parts of the world
similar monuments are encountered in Great Britain and Ireland,
Scandinavia, the Crimea, Algeria, and India, but nowhere are they found
in such abundance as in Brittany, nor are these rivalled in other lands,
either as regards their character or the space they occupy.

To speculate as to the race which built the primitive stone monuments of
Brittany is almost as futile as it would be to theorize upon the date of
their erection. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) A generation ago it
was usual to refer all European megalithic monuments to a 'Celtic'
origin, but European ethnological problems have become too complicated
of late years to permit such a theory to pass unchallenged, especially
now that the term 'Celt' is itself matter for fierce controversy. In the
immediate neighbourhood of certain of these monuments objects of the
Iron Age are recovered from the soil, while near others the finds are of
Bronze Age character, so that it is probably correct to surmise that
their construction continued throughout a prolonged period.

### What Menhirs and Dolmens are

Regarding the nomenclature of the several species of megalithic
monuments met with in Brittany some

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

definitions are necessary. A menhir is a rude monolith set up on end, a
great single stone, the base of which is buried deep in the soil. A
dolmen is a large, table-shaped stone, supported by three, four, or even
five other stones, the bases of which are sunk in the earth. In Britain
the term 'cromlech' is synonymous with that of 'dolmen,' but in France
and on the Continent generally it is exclusively applied to that class
of monument for which British scientists have no other name than 'stone
circles.' The derivation of the words from Celtic and their precise
meaning in that tongue may assist the reader to arrive at their exact
significance. Thus 'menhir' seems to be derived from the Welsh or
Brythonic *maen*, 'a stone,' and *hir*, 'long,' and 'dolmen' from Breton
*taol*, 'table,' and *men*, 'a stone.' <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)
'Cromlech' is also of Welsh or Brythonic origin, and is derived from
*crom*, 'bending' or 'bowed' (hence 'laid across'), and *llech*, 'a flat
stone.' The *allée couverte* is a dolmen on a large scale.

### The Nature of the Monuments

The nature of these monuments and the purpose for which they were
erected were questions which powerfully exercised the minds of the
antiquaries of a century ago, who fiercely contended for their use as
altars, open-air temples, and places of rendezvous for the discussion of
tribal affairs. The cooler archæologists of a later day have discarded
the majority of such theories as untenable in the light of hard facts.
The dolmens, they say, are highly unsuitable for the purpose of altars,
and as it has been proved that this class of monument

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

was invariably covered in prehistoric times by an earthen tumulus its
ritualistic use is thereby rendered improbable. Moreover, if we chance
upon any rude carving or incised work on dolmens we observe that it is
invariably executed on the *lower* surface of the table stone, the upper
surface being nearly always rough, unhewn, often naturally rounded, and
as unlike the surface of an altar as possible.

Recent research has established the much more reasonable theory that
these monuments are sepulchral in character, and that they mark the last
resting-places of persons of tribal importance, chiefs, priests, or
celebrated warriors. Occasionally legend assists us to prove the
mortuary character of menhir and dolmen. But, without insisting any
further for the present upon the purpose of these monuments, let us
glance at the more widely known of Brittany's prehistoric structures,
not so much in the manner of the archæologist as in that of the
observant traveller who is satisfied to view them as interesting relics
of human handiwork bequeathed from a darker age, rather than as objects
to satisfy the archæological taste for discussion.

For this purpose we shall select the best known groups of Breton
prehistoric structures, and shall begin our excursion at the
north-eastern extremity of Brittany, following the coast-line, on which
most of the principal prehistoric centres are situated, and, as occasion
offers, journeying into the interior in search of famous or interesting
examples.

### Dol

Dol is situated in the north of the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, not
far from the sea-coast. Near it, in a

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

field called the Champ Dolent ('Field of Woe'), stands a gigantic
menhir, about thirty feet high and said to measure fifteen more
underground. It is composed of grey granite, and is surmounted by a
cross. The early Christian missionaries, finding it impossible to wean
the people from frequenting pagan neighbourhoods, surmounted the
standing stones with the symbol of their faith, and this in time brought
about the result desired. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

### The Legend of Dol

A strange legend is connected with this rude menhir. On a day in the
dark, uncharted past of Brittany a fierce battle was fought in the Champ
Dolent. Blood ran in streams, sufficient, says the tale, to turn a
millwheel in the neighbourhood of the battle-field. When the combat was
at its height two brothers met and grappled in fratricidal strife. But
ere they could harm one another the great granite shaft which now looms
above the field rose up between them and separated them.

There appears to be some historical basis for the tale. Here, or in the
neighbourhood, A.D. 560, met Clotaire, King of the Franks, and his son,
the rebel Chramne. The rebellious son was signally defeated. He had
placed his wife and two little daughters in a dwelling hard by, and as
he made his way thence to convey them from the field he was captured. He
was instantly strangled, by order of his brutal father, in the sight of
his wife and little ones, who were then burned alive in the house where
they had taken refuge. The Champ Dolent does not belie its name, and
even thirteen

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

centuries and a half have failed to obliterate the memory of a savage
and unnatural crime, which, its remoteness notwithstanding, fills the
soul with loathing against its perpetrators and with deep pity for the
hapless and innocent victims.

### A Subterranean Dolmen Chapel

At Plouaret, in the department of Côtes-du-Nord, is a curious
subterranean chapel incorporating a dolmen. The dolmen was formerly
partially embedded in a tumulus, and the chapel, erected in 1702, was so
constructed that the great table-stone of the dolmen has become the
chapel roof, and the supporting stones form two of its sides. The crypt
is reached by a flight of steps, and here may be seen an altar to the
Seven Sleepers, represented by seven dolls of varying size. The Bretons
have a legend that this structure dates from the creation of the world,
and they have embodied this belief in a ballad, in which it is piously
affirmed that the shrine was built by the hand of the Almighty at the
time when the world was in process of formation.

### Camaret

Camaret, on the coast of Finistère, is the site of no less than
forty-one standing stones of quartz, which outline a rectangular space
600 yards in length at its base. Many stones have been removed, so that
the remaining sides are incomplete. None of these monoliths is of any
considerable size, however, and the site is not considered to be of much
importance, save as regards its isolated character. At Penmarch, in the
southern extremity of Finistère, there is an 'alignment' of some two
hundred small stones, and a dolmen

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

of some importance is situated at Trégunc, but it is at Carnac, on the
coast of Morbihan, that we arrive at,' the most important archæological
district in Brittany.

### Carnac

The Carnac district teems with prehistoric monuments, the most
celebrated of which are those of Plouharnel, Concarneau, Concurrus,
Locmariaquer, Kermario, Kerlescant, Erdeven, and Sainte-Barbe. All these
places are situated within a few miles of one another, and a good centre
from which excursions can be made to each is the little town of Auray,
with its quaint medieval market-house and shrine of St Roch.
Archæologists, both Breton and foreign, appear to be agreed that the
groups of stones at Ménéac, Kermario, and Kerlescant are portions of one
original and continuous series of alignments which extended for nearly
two miles in one direction from south-west to north-east. The monolithic
avenue commences quite near the village of Ménéac, stretching away in
eleven rows, and here the large stones are situated, these at first
rising to a height of from 10 to 13 feet, and becoming gradually
smaller, until they attain only 3 or 4 feet. In all there are 116
menhirs at Ménéac. For more than three hundred yards there is a gap in
the series, which passed, we come to the Kermario avenue, which consists
of ten rows of monoliths of much the same size as those of Ménéac, and
1120 in number.

Passing on to Kerlescant, with its thirteen rows of menhirs made up of
570 individual stones, we come to the end of the avenue and gaze
backward upon the plain covered with these indestructible symbols of a
forgotten past.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Carnac! There is something vast, Egyptian, in the name! There is,
indeed, a Karnak in Egypt, celebrated for its Avenue of Sphinxes and its
pillared temple raised to the goddess Mut by King Amenophis III. Here,
in the Breton Carnac, are no evidences of architectural skill. These
sombre stones, unworked, rude as they came from cliff or seashore, are
not embellished by man's handiwork like the rich temples of the Nile.
But there is about this stone-littered moor a mystery, an atmosphere no
less intense than that surrounding the most solemn ruins of antiquity.
Deeper even than the depths of Egypt must we sound if we are to discover
the secret of Carnac. What mean these stones? What means faith? What
signifies belief? What is the answer to the Riddle of Man? In the words
of Cayot Délandre, a Breton poet:

Tout cela eut un sens, et traduisit  
Une pensée; mais clé de ce mystère,  
Où est elle? et qui pourrait dire aujourd'hui  
Si jamais elle se retrouvera? <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

### A Vision

Over this wild, heathy track, covered with the blue flowers of the dwarf
gentian, steals a subtle change. Nor air nor heath has altered. The
lichen-covered grey stones are the same. Suddenly there arises the
burden of a low, fierce chant. A swarm of skin-clad figures appears,
clustering around a gigantic object

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

which they are painfully dragging toward a deep pit situated at the end
of one of the enormous alleys of monoliths. On rudely shaped rollers
rests a huge stone some twenty feet in length, and this they drag across
the rough moor by ropes of hide, lightening their labours by the chant,
which relates the exploits of the warrior-chief who has lately been
entombed in this vast pantheon of Carnac. The menhir shall serve for his
headstone. It has been vowed to him by the warriors of his tribe, his
henchmen, who have fought and hunted beside him, and who revere his
memory. This stone shall render his fame immortal.

And now the task of placing the huge monolith in position begins. Ropes
are attached to one extremity, and while a line of brawny savages
strains to raise this, others guide that end of the monolith destined
for enclosure in the earth toward the pit which has been dug for its
reception. Higher and higher rises the stone, until at last it sinks
slowly into its earthy bed. It is held in an upright position while the
soil is packed around it and it is made secure. Then the barbarians
stand back a space and gaze at it from beneath their low brows, well
pleased with their handiwork. He whom they honoured in life rests not
unrecognized in death.

### The Legend of Carnac

The legend of Carnac which explains these avenues of monoliths bears a
resemblance to the Cornish story of 'the Hurlers,' who were turned into
stone for playing at hurling on the Lord's Day, or to that other English
example from Cumberland of 'Long Meg' and her daughters. St Cornely, we
are told, pursued by an

 

<span id="img_04400"></span>

[![RAISING A MENHIR](tn/04400.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/04400.jpg.md)  
RAISING A MENHIR  

 

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

army of pagans, fled toward the sea. Finding no boat at hand, and on the
point of being taken, he transformed his pursuers into stones, the
present monoliths. The Saint had made his flight to the coast in a
bullock-cart, and perhaps for this reason he is now regarded as the
patron of cattle. Should a bullock fall sick, his owner purchases an
image of St Cornely and hangs it up in the stable until the animal
recovers. The church at Carnac contains a  series of fresco paintings
which outline events in the life of the Saint, and in the churchyard
there is a representation of the holy man between two bullocks. The head
of St Cornely is said to be preserved within the edifice as a relic. On
the 13th of September is held at Carnac the festival of the 'Benediction
of the Beasts,' which is celebrated in honour of St Cornely. The cattle
of the district are brought to the vicinity of the church and blessed by
the priests-should sufficient monetary encouragement be forthcoming.

### Mont-Saint-Michel

In the neighbourhood is Mont-Saint-Michel, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) a great tumulus with a sepulchral dolmen,
first excavated in 1862, when late Stone Age implements, jade celts, and
burnt bones were unearthed. Later M. Zacharie Le Rouzic, the well-known
Breton archæologist, tunnelled into the tumulus, and discovered a
mortuary chamber, in which were the incinerated remains of two oxen. To
this tumulus each pilgrim added a stone or small quantity of earth, as
has been the custom in Celtic countries from time immemorial, and so the
funerary mound in the course of countless generations grew into

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

quite a respectable hill, on which a chapel was built, dedicated to St
Michael, from the doorway of which a splendid prospect of the great
stone alignments can be had, with, for background, the Morbihan and the
long, dreary peninsula of Quiberon, bleak, treeless, and deserted.

### Rocenaud

Near Carnac is the great dolmen of Rocenaud, the 'cup-and-ring' markings
on which are thought by the surrounding peasantry to have been made by
the knees and elbows of St Roch, who fell upon this stone when he landed
from Ireland. When the natives desire a wind they knock upon the
depressions with their knuckles, murmuring spells the while, just as in
Scotland in the seventeenth century a tempest was raised by dipping a
rag in water and beating it on a stone thrice in the name of Satan.

### Cup-and-Ring Markings

What do these cup-and-ring markings so commonly discovered upon the
monuments, of Brittany portend? The question is one well worth examining
at some length, as it appears to be almost at the foundations of
Neolithic religion. Recent discoveries in New Caledonia have proved the
existence in these far-off islands, as in Brittany, Scotland, and
Ireland, of these strange symbols, coupled with the concentric and
spiral designs which are usually associated with the genius of Celtic
art. In the neighbourhood of Glasgow, and in the south-west of Scotland
generally, stones inscribed with designs closely resembling those on the
New Caledonian rocks have been found in abundance, as at Auchentorlie

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

and Cockno, Shewalton Sands, and in the Milton of Colquhoun district,
where the famous 'cup-and-ring altar' was discovered. At Shewalton Sands
in particular, in 1904, a number of stones were found bearing crosses
like those discovered in Portugal by Father José Brenha and Father
Rodriguez. These symbols have a strong resemblance to certain markings
on the Breton rocks, and are thought to possess an alphabetic or magical
significance. In Scotland spirals are commonly found on stones marked
with ogham inscriptions, and it is remarkable that they should occur in
New Caledonia in connexion with a dot 'alphabet.' The New Caledonian
crosses, however, approximate more to the later crosses of Celtic art,
while the spirals resemble those met with in the earlier examples of
Celtic work. But the closest parallel to the New Caledonian
stone-markings to be found in Scotland is supplied by the examples at
Cockno, in Dumbartonshire, where the wheel symbol is associated with the
cup-and-ring markings.

The cup-and-ring stones used to be considered the peculiar product of a
race of 'Brythonic' or British origin, and it is likely that the stones
so carved were utilized in the ritual of rain-worship or rain-making by
sympathetic magic. The grooves in the stone were probably filled with
water to typify a country partially covered with rain-water. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

From these analogies, then, we can glean the purpose of the cup-and-ring
markings upon the dolmens of Brittany, and may conclude, if our
considerations are

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

well founded, that they were magical in purpose and origin. Do the
cup-shaped depressions represent water, or are they receptacles for
rain, and do the spiral symbols typify the whirling winds?

### The Gallery of Gavr’inis

Nowhere are these mysterious markings so well exemplified as in the
wonderful tumulus of Gavr’inis. This ancient place of sepulture, the
name of which means 'Goat Island,' lies in the Morbihan, or 'Little
Sea,' an inland sea which gives its name to a department in the south of
Brittany. The tumulus is 25 feet high, and covers a fine gallery 40 feet
long, the stones of which bear the markings alluded to. Whorls and
circles abound in the ornamentation, serpent-like figures, and the
representation of an axe, similar to those to be seen in some of the
Grottes aux Fées, or on the Dol des Marchands. The sculptures appear to
have been executed with metal tools. The passage ends in a square
sepulchral chamber, the supports of which are eight menhirs of grained
granite, a stone not found on the island. Such of the menhirs as are
carved were obviously so treated before they were placed *in situ*, as
the design passes round the edges.

### The Ile aux Moines

The Ile aux Moines ('Monks' Island') is also situated in the Morbihan,
and has many prehistoric monuments, the most extensive of which are the
circle of stones at Kergonan and the dolmen of Penhapp. On the Ile
d'Arz, too, are megalithic monuments, perhaps the best example of which
is the cromlech or circle at Penraz.

The folk-beliefs attached to the megalithic monuments

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of Brittany are numerous, but nearly all of them bear a strong
resemblance to each other. Many of the monuments are called Grottes aux
Fées or Roches aux Fées, in the belief that the fairies either built
them or used them as dwelling-places, and variants of these names are to
be found in the Maison des Follets ('House of the Goblins') at Cancoet,
in Morbihan, and the Château des Paulpiquets, in Questembert, in the
same district. Ty en Corygannt ('The House of the Korrigans') is
situated in the same department, while near Penmarch, in Finistère, at
the other end of the province, we find Ty C’harriquet ('The House of the
Gorics' or 'Nains'). Other mythical personages are also credited with
their erection, most frequently either the devil or Gargantua being held
responsible for their miraculous creation. The phenomenon, well known to
students of folk-lore, that an unlettered people speedily forgets the
origin of monuments that its predecessors may have raised in times past
is well exemplified in Brittany, whose peasant-folk are usually
surprised, if not amused, at the question "Who built the dolmens?" Close
familiarity with and contiguity to uncommon objects not infrequently
dulls the sense of wonder they should otherwise naturally excite. But
lest we feel tempted to sneer at these poor folk for their incurious
attitude toward the visible antiquities of their land, let us ask
ourselves how many of us take that interest in the antiquities of our
own country or our own especial locality that they demand. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

### Fairy Builders

For the most part, then, the megaliths, in the opinion of the Breton
peasant, are not the handiwork of man. He would rather refer their
origin to spirits, giants, or, fiends. If he makes any exception to this
supernatural attribution, it is in favour of the saints he reverences so
profoundly. The fairies, he says, harnessed their oxen to the mighty
stones, selected a site, and dragged them thither to form a dwelling, or
perhaps a cradle for the infant fays they were so fond of exchanging,,
for human children. Thus the Roches aux Fées near Saint-Didier, in
Ille-et-Vilaine, were raised by fairy hands, the elves collecting "all
the big stones in the country" and carrying them thither in their
aprons. These architectural sprites then mounted on each other's
shoulders in order that they might reach high, enough to place the
mighty monoliths securely in position. This practice they also followed
in building the dolmen near the wood of Rocher, on the road from Dinan
to Dol, say the people of that country-side. But the actual purpose of
the megaliths has not been neglected by tradition, for a venerable
farmer at Rouvray stated that the fairies were wont to honour after
their death those who had made good use of their lives and built the
dolmens to contain their ashes. The presence of such a shrine in a
country-side was a guarantee of abundance and prosperity therein, as a
subtle and indefinable charm spread from the saintly remnants and
communicated itself to everything in the neighbourhood. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) The fairy builders, says tradition, went
about their work in no haphazard manner. Those

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

among them who possessed a talent for design drew the plans of the
proposed structure, the less gifted acting as carriers, labourers, and
masons. Apron-carrying was not their only method of porterage, for some
bore the stones on their heads, or one under each arm, as when they
raised the Roche aux Fées in Retiers, or the dolmen in La Lande
Marie. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) The space of a night was
usually sufficient in which to raise a dolmen. But though 'run up' with
more than Transatlantic dispatch, in view of the time these structures
have endured for, any charge of jerry-building against their elfin
architects must fall to the ground. Daylight, too, frequently surprised
the fairy builders, so that they could not finish their task, as many a
'roofless' dolmen shows.

There are many Celtic parallels to this belief. For example, it is said
that the Picts, or perhaps the fairies, built the original church of
Corstorphine, near Edinburgh, and stood in a row handing the stones on,
one to another, from Ravelston Quarry, on the adjacent hill of
Corstorphine. Such is the local folktale; and it has its congeners in
Celtic and even in Hindu myth. Thus in the Highland tale of Kennedy and
the *claistig*, or fairy, whom he captured, and whom he compelled to
build him a house in one night, we read that she set her people to work
speedily:

And they brought flags and stones  
From the shores of Cliamig waterfall,  
Reaching them from hand to hand. <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md)

Again, the Round Tower of Ardmore, in Ireland, was

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

built with stones brought from Slieve Grian, a mountain some four or
five miles distant, "without horse or wheel," the blocks being passed
from hand to hand from the quarry to the site of the building. The same
tradition applied to the Round Tower of Abernethy, in Perthshire, only
it is in this case demonstrated that the stone of which the tower is
composed was actually taken from the traditional quarry, even the very
spot being geologically identified. <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)
In like manner, too, was Rama's bridge built by the monkey host in Hindu
myth, as recounted in the *Mahābhārata* and the *Rāmāyana*.

Tales, as apart from beliefs, are not often encountered, in connexion
with the monuments. Indeed, Sébillot, in the course of his researches,
found only some dozen of these all told. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) They are very brief, and appear for the
most part to deal with fairies who have been shut up by the power of
magic in a dolmen. Tales of spirits enclosed in trees, and even in
pillars, are not uncommon, and lately I have heard a peculiarly fearsome
ghost story which comes from Belgium, in which it is related how certain
spirits had become enclosed in a pillar in an ancient abbey, for the
saintly occupants of which they made it particularly uncomfortable. Mr
George Henderson, in one of the most masterly and suggestive studies of
Celtic survivals ever published, states that stones in the Highlands of
Scotland were formerly believed to have souls, and that those too large
to be moved "were held to be in intimate connexion with spirits."
Pillared stones are not employed in building dwellings in the Highlands,
ill luck, it is believed, being

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

sure to follow their use in this manner, while to 'meddle' with stones
which tradition connects with Druidism is to court fatality. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

### Stones that Travel

M. Salomon Reinach tells us of the Breton belief that certain sacred
stones go once a year or once a century to, 'wash' themselves in the sea
or in a river, returning to their ancient seats after their
ablutions. <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) The stones in the dolmen
of Essé are thought to change their places continually, like those of
Callernish and Lewis, and, like the Roman Penates, to have the gift of
coming and going if removed from their habitual site.

The megalithic monuments of Brittany are undoubtedly the most remarkable
relics of that epoch of prehistoric activity which is now regarded as
the immediate forerunner of civilization. Can it be that they were
miraculously preserved by isolation from the remote beginnings of that
epoch, or is it more probable that they were constructed at a relatively
late period? These are questions of profound difficulty, and it is
likely that both theories contain a certain amount of truth. Whatever
may have been the origin of her megaliths, Brittany must ever be
regarded as a great prehistoric museum, a unique link with a past of
hoary antiquity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[37:1](lrb05.htm#fr_5.md) That it was Neolithic
seems undoubted, and in all probability Alpine--*i.e.* the same race as
presently inhabits Brittany. See Dottin, *Anciens Peuples de l'Europe*
(Paris, 1916).

<span id="fn_6"></span>[38:1](lrb05.htm#fr_6.md) But *tolmen* in Cornish
meant 'pole of stone.'

<span id="fn_7"></span>[20:1](lrb05.htm#fr_7.md) Ostensibly, at least; but
see the remarks upon modern pagan survivals in Chapter IX, [p.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[43:1](lrb05.htm#fr_8.md) Which might be rendered:

All here is symbol; these grey stones translate  
A thought ineffable, but where the key?  
Say, shall it be recovered soon or late,  
To ope the temple of this mystery?

<span id="fn_9"></span>[45:1](lrb05.htm#fr_9.md) Not to be confused, of
course, with the well-known island mount of the same name.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[47:1](lrb05.htm#fr_10.md) A Scottish
sixteenth-century magical verse was chanted over such a stone:

I knock this rag wpone this stone,  
And ask the divell for rain thereon."

 

<span id="fn_11"></span>[49:1](lrb05.htm#fr_11.md) The writer's experience
is that unlettered British folk often possess much better information
concerning the antiquities of a district than its 'educated'
inhabitants. If this information is not scientific it is full and
displays deep personal interest.
