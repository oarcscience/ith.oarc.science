### THE VOICE OF GORSEDD.

THIS is the Voice of Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, in
which may be seen the Privileges and Usages of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain, as originally exercised and confirmed. With them also are the
Triads of the Bards of the Chair of Glamorgan,, and other matters
intended for Bardic instruction.

The Cymry first came into the Isle of Britain with Prydain, son of
Aeddan the Great. And when they were safely settled in the country,
there arose among them three men, whose names were Plennydd, Alawn, and
Gwron, each of them having Awen from God, and who consequently were
Bards. These were the first who devised the Privileges and Usages of the
Bards of the Isle of Britain, which they appointed for instruction,
custom, and law in the Isle of Britain; nor were there any Bards
previous to these men. The Bards maintained these usages, and improved
them by means of Awen from God, so that the Bardism of the Bards of the
Isle of Britain became the supreme learning and wisdom; and many of the
wise men of distant countries desired to learn it, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) but they impaired and corrupted it by means
of

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Awen which was not
from God, until at last there was no pure Bardism in any country or
place in the world, but among the Bards of the Isle of Britain, who were
of the nation of the Cymry. The following treats of the Privileges and
Usages, which the Bards of the Isle of Britain ought to preserve by
means of the memorial of vocal song, and to recite with the Voice of
Gorsedd: that is to say;--

1\. The principal usages of the Bards of the Isle of Britain are to
'maintain the memory and teaching of peace, truth, and justice in a
country, and to bestow praise upon the good, and dispraise upon the bad;
and all this by means of Awen from God.

2\. They are not to bear a naked weapon in the presence of, or against
any one; and it is not lawful for any one to bear a naked weapon where
there is a Bard.

3\. There are three kinds of Primitive Bards. The Bard positive, of
original appointment, or a Poet, in virtue of discipleship, whose duty
it is to preserve order and rule, in respect of the Privilege, Usage,
and Voice of Gorsedd, so that Bardism be not lost, but be maintained and
preserved, in right of original usage, uncorrupt and unchanged. And it
is incumbent upon a Poet to sing praise and dispraise, according to what
is just and requisite, and, by means of song and oration, to preserve
the memory of the Privileges and Usages of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain, and their appurtenances. A Poet is adjudged to be one of
presidency after three Chairs, that is, when he shall have gained the
privilege of three Chairs; and every office and employment, in respect
of song and Bardism, are free to him in virtue of his Chair; and he may
exercise the function of Poet, Ovate, and Druid, as he pleases, in
virtue of occasion, without a degree, without a grant. In this
particular he is the chief of the Bards, and no one can be made master
of song who is not a presiding Bard. His dress is to be of serene sky
blue, and unicoloured, for unicolour is of the same hue as truth, and
the serene sky blue is of the same hue as peace, a Poet, or a privileged
Bard, being a man of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

peace and truth;--he is also called a Licensed Bard, a privileged
Licentiate, and Primitive Bard positive. Nor is it lawful for him to
bear arms, nor for any one to bear a weapon, where he may be in his
unicoloured vestment, by which he is to be distinguished. The second of
the primitive Bards is the Ovate, and it is incumbent upon him to be
acquainted with literature, that is, to read and write, and to know the
kinds of arts which may be beneficial to Bards and to the world, and to
exhibit them in their authenticity before a Gorsedd or Chair, or a Bard
of presidency. It is incumbent upon him, also, to collect and to search
for knowledge, and to impart instruction in it, after it shall have
obtained the judgment and privilege of Gorsedd; he is not bound to do
more, except in virtue of a degree and grant. The dress of an Ovate is
to be green, being of the same colour as knowledge and learning, which
grow like the green vegetation of spring; and in the attainment of
knowledge the Ovate is the chief of the Bards. The third of the
primitive Bards is the Druid, and it is incumbent [upon](errata.htm#0.md)
him to teach, according to reason, nature, obligation, and choice, what
he sees to be true, of the original learning, usages, and judgment of
the Poets, as preserved in the memory and by the voice of Gorsedd, and
of the learning, art, and attainment of the Ovate-bard. And his
principal function is to teach divine knowledge, and justice, truth, and
peace; and in respect of learning and knowledge, according to reason,
nature, and obligation, the chief of the Bards is the Druid. From
knowing how to sing and exhibit a song of his own composition before a
Gorsedd, which shall confer upon it the privilege of a Chair, he will be
entitled to the privilege of a Poet, that is, a Bard of privilege,
without either a degree or a grant. The dress of a Druid is to be of
unicoloured white, being thus of the same colour positively as the sun
and light, and consequently of the same colour as holiness of life,
purity of godliness, and sanctity. If he cannot com- pose a song, a
Druid has nothing to do with the function of a Bard of Privilege, except
by grant and courtesy; but he

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

is privileged, without either a degree or a grant, to perform what may
be necessary, and what may seem good to him, in the employment and
office of an Ovate. Should a Druid be an original Bard of Privilege, he
has no need of either a degree or a grant, but will act according to
privilege. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

4\. Discipleship is the instruction of a master, who is a presiding
Bard; that is, he who desires to receive instruction and privilege in
respect of song and Bardism, must apply to a presiding master, and put
himself under his charge, and must attend every Gorsedd of song with his
master. Those who seek instruction and privilege in respect of song are
called Aspirants, Disciples, privileged Licentiates, and Protected,
because protection will be afforded to them, that they should bear no
arms, and that none should bear arms where they are. Aspirants have no
more privileges, until they obtain a degree in right of a Gorsedd; and
no degree can be conferred upon an Aspirant until the end of three years
of discipleship, though in right of an Ovate he may have a degree
sooner, where there is a presiding Bard, who will aver on his word and
conscience that the candidate is competent to be a Bard. No man can be
admitted into discipleship, who knows not his right hand, how to count a
hundred, the names of the months of the year, and the four parts of the
world, namely, south, east, north, and west, and who knows not his
mother's tongue in such a way as it may be easy to understand him. When
he shall have been a disciple for three years, he is privileged to
become a candidate for the degree of a Primitive Bard Positive, if he
has a beard; if he has no beard, let him wait until he has, or let him
seek the degree of an Ovate. And when he obtains a beard, he is
privileged to become a candidate for the degree of a Primitive Bard, if
he has been a disciple for three years, or is an Ovate; and if he cannot
at that time answer poetically and judiciously, according to the
instruction of Privilege and Usage, a degree must be forbidden to him,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

unless he is better acquainted with his necessity, his feat, and his
employment, in which case he is privileged to obtain a degree.

An Ovate is to be graduated, as before mentioned, in virtue of a
presiding Bard, who shall aver on his word and conscience, that the
candidate is competent to become a Bard, or according to the judgment of
a Gorsedd, to which application has been made, or from having been a
disciple for less than three years, if he can answer the questions put
to him by an Ovate. An Ovate of privilege is a Bard of privilege, or a
Druid, who exercises the vocation of an Ovate, or verifies the claim of
an Ovate candidate, or an original Ovate; and there is no need to a Bard
of privilege, or a Druid, of a degree or grant, since they are entitled
by privilege to assume the office of an Ovate.

The privilege of grant, or privilege by the courtesy of Gorsedd, is
that, when a Bard must needs exercise a function, which is not his by
privilege and degree, as when an Ovate, or original Druid, in case of
necessity, exercises the vocation of a Primitive Bard Positive, where
that person is wanting; or when an Ovate, in case of need, exercises the
vocation of a Druid. Some say, that an Aspirant of three years, can, in
right of courtesy, and of the grant of usage, engage in the office of a
Primitive Bard Positive, where there is none, or a sufficient number of
such already; and in the same manner, engage also in the offices of an
Ovate and a Druid. It is not lawful for any one to assume the office of
degree and gorsedd, in right of the gift of courtesy, except where there
is a deficiency of presiding Bards, or of Bards of institutional degree
and privilege.

A person may share in the privilege of grant and courtesy, by giving
notice of a year and a day; and unless an institutional Bard enters his
protest against it before the expiration of that time, then all, who
have enjoyed grant and courtesy, are entitled to the privilege of usage;
this is the privilege of necessity, lest Bardism should be lost.

Where there are three presiding Bards, there is the privilege

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

of an institutional Gorsedd. Where there are not three, there can be no
institutional privilege, but the privilege of grant, or the privilege of
courtesy, in virtue of a year and a day, when it becomes institutional,
in case the claim has not been negatived.

Positive privilege takes place where there is only one presiding Bard,
such being ordained lest Bardism should become lost. That is to say, the
presiding Bard is empowered to confer the privilege of degree and
gorsedd upon three persons, if he pleases, for the sake of holding a
Gorsedd, which takes place at the end of an institutional year and a
day; after that, they become presiding in right of three Chairs, or
three Gorsedds.

Where there is not one presiding Bard, or chief of song, and hence there
is a prospect of Bardism being lost, let those, who know the usages and
privileges of the Bards of the Isle of Britain from the lips and voice
of country, or from Book and Coelbren, or from a very old song, give
public notice of a year and a day throughout the country, in the name of
the Bards of the Isle of Britain, who are adjudged to be always living.
And when the year and a day are expired, it is lawful for them to hold a
Gorsedd, according to what is institutional, as indicated by the memory
and voice of country, and the memorial of Book and Coelbren. And at the
end of a year and a day after that they will be Bards of privilege and
usage, according to claim and acknowledgment, and unless they are
protested against before the end of a year and a day after that by an
institutional Bard of Gorsedd, under the privilege of the primitive
Bards of the Isle of Britain, then they will be privileged and
institutional, as well as their Gorsedd, since they will now be Bards
according to privilege and usage in virtue of the same notice, grant,
and courtesy, which first of all conferred privilege and usage upon the
Bards of the Isle of Britain, that is, the privilege of necessity.
