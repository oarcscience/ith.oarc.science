### CHAPTER XXII.

# THE STATE OF THE DEAD.

AMONG all the problems with which man has busied himself, none so
appeals to his hopes and fears as that of the future life. Is there a
farther shore, and if so, shall we reach it? Few races, if any, have
doubted the existence of a future state, but their conceptions of it
have differed greatly. But of all the races of antiquity, outside Egypt,
the Celts seem to have cherished the most ardent belief in the world
beyond the grave, and to have been preoccupied with its joys. Their
belief, so far as we know it, was extremely vivid, and its chief
characteristic was life in the body after death, in another
region. <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1](#fn_1152.md) This, coupled with the
fact that it was taught as a doctrine by the Druids, made it the
admiration of classical onlookers. But besides this belief there was
another, derived from the ideas of a distant past, that the dead lived
on in the grave--the two conceptions being connected. And there may also
have been a certain degree of belief in transmigration. Although the
Celts believed that the soul could exist apart from the body, there
seems to be no evidence that they believed in a future existence of the
soul as a shade. This belief is certainly found in some late Welsh
poems, where the ghosts are described as wandering in the Caledonian
forest, but these can hardly be made use of as evidence for the old
pagan doctrine. The evidence for the latter may be gathered

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

from classical observers, from archaeology and from Irish texts.

Cæsar writes: "The Druids in particular wish to impress this on them
that souls do not perish, but pass from one to another (*ab aliis ... ad
alios*) after death, and by this chiefly they think to incite men to
valour, the fear of death being overlooked." Later he adds, that at
funerals all things which had been dear to the dead man, even living
creatures, were thrown on the funeral pyre, and shortly before his time
slaves and beloved clients were also consumed. <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1153.md) Diodorus says: "Among them the
doctrine of Pythagoras prevailed that the souls of men were immortal,
and after completing their term of existence they live again, the soul
passing into another body. Hence at the burial of the dead some threw
letters addressed to dead relatives on the funeral pile, believing that
the dead would read them in the next world." <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1154.md) Valerius Maximus writes: "They would
fain make us believe that the souls of men are immortal. I would be
tempted to call these breeches-wearing folk fools, if their doctrine
were not the same as that of the mantle-clad Pythagoras." He also speaks
of money lent which would be repaid in the next world, because men's
souls are immortal. <span id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1155.md) These
passages are generally taken to mean that the Celts believed simply in
transmigration of the Pythagorean type. Possibly all these writers cite
one common original, but Cæsar makes no reference to Pythagoras. A
comparison with the Pythagorean doctrine shows that the Celtic belief
differed materially from it. According to the former, men's souls
entered new bodies, even those of animals, in this world, and as an
expiation. There is nothing of this in the Celtic doctrine. The new body
is not a prison-house of the soul in which it must expiate its former
sins, and the soul receives it not in this world but in another. The
real point of

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

connection was the insistence of both upon immortality, the Druids
teaching that it was bodily immortality. Their doctrine no more taught
transmigration than does the Christian doctrine of the resurrection.
Roman writers, aware that Pythagoras taught immortality via a series of
transmigrations, and that the Druids taught a doctrine of bodily
immortality, may have thought that the receiving of a new body meant
transmigration. Themselves sceptical of a future life or believing in a
traditional gloomy Hades, they were bound to be struck with the vigour
of the Celtic doctrine and its effects upon conduct. The only thing like
it of which they knew was the Pythagorean doctrine. Looked at in this
light, Cæsar's words need not convey the idea of transmigration, and it
is possible that he mistranslated some Greek original. Had these writers
meant that the Druids taught transmigration, they could hardly have
added the passages regarding debts being paid in the other world, or
letters conveyed there by the dead, or human sacrifices to benefit the
dead there. These also preclude the idea of a mere immortality of the
soul. The dead Celt continued to be the person he had been, and it may
have been that not a new body, but the old body glorified, was tenanted
by his soul beyond the grave. This bodily immortality in a region where
life went on as on this earth, but under happier conditions, would then
be like the Vedic teaching that the soul, after the burning of the body,
went to the heaven of Yama, and there received its body complete and
glorified. The two conceptions, Hindu and Celtic, may have sprung from
early "Aryan" belief.

This Celtic doctrine appears more clearly from what Lucan says of the
Druidic teaching. "From you we learn that the bourne of man's existence
is not the silent halls of Erebus, in another world (or region, *in orbe
alio*) the spirit animates the members. Death, if your lore be true, is
but the centre of a

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

long life." For this reason, he adds, the Celtic warrior had no fear of
death. <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1](#fn_1156.md) Thus Lucan conceived the
Druidic doctrine to be one of bodily immortality in another region. That
region was not a gloomy state; rather it resembled the Egyptian Aalu
with its rich and varied existence. Classical writers, of course, may
have known of what appears to have been a sporadic Celtic idea, derived
from old beliefs, that the soul might take the form of an animal, but
this was not the Druidic teaching. Again, if the Gauls, like the Irish,
had myths telling of the rebirth of gods or semi-divine beings, these
may have been misinterpreted by those writers and regarded as
eschatological. But such myths do not concern mortals. Other writers,
Timagenes, Strabo, and Mela, <span id="fr_1159"></span>[2](#fn_1157.md)
speak only of the immortality of the soul, but their testimony is
probably not at variance with that of Lucan, since Mela appears to copy
Cæsar, and speaks of accounts and debts being passed on to the next
world.

This theory of a bodily immortality is supported by the Irish sagas, in
which ghosts, in our sense of the word, do not exist. The dead who
return are not spectres, but are fully clothed upon with a body. Thus,
when Cúchulainn returns at the command of S. Patrick, he is described
exactly as if he were still in the flesh. "His hair was thick and black
... in his head his eye gleamed swift and grey.... Blacker than the side
of a cooking spit each of his two brows, redder than ruby his lips." His
clothes and weapons are fully described, while his chariot and horses
are equally corporeal. <span id="fr_1160"></span>[3](#fn_1158.md) Similar
descriptions of the dead who return are not infrequent, *e.g.* that of
Caoilte in the story of Mongan, whom every one believes to be a living
warrior, and that of Fergus mac Roich, who reappeared in a beautiful
form, adorned with brown hair and

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

clad in his former splendour, and recited the lost story of the
*Táin*. <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1159.md) Thus the Irish Celts
believed that in another world the spirit animated the members. This
bodily existence is also suggested in Celtic versions of the "Dead
Debtor" folktale cycle. Generally an animal in whose shape a dead man
helps his benefactor is found in other European versions, but in the
Celtic stories not an animal but the dead man himself appears as a
living person in corporeal form. <span id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1160.md)
Equally substantial and corporeal, eating, drinking, lovemaking, and
fighting are the divine folk of the *síd* or of Elysium, or the gods as
they are represented in the texts. To the Celts, gods, *síde*, and the
dead, all alike had a bodily form, which, however, might become
[invisible](errata.htm#6.md), and in other ways differed from the earthly
body.

The archæological evidence of burial customs among the Celts also bears
witness to this belief. Over the whole Celtic area a rich profusion of
grave-goods has been found, consisting of weapons, armour, chariots,
utensils, ornaments, and coins. <span id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1161.md)
Some of the interments undoubtedly point to sacrifice of wife, children,
or slaves at the grave. Male and female skeletons are often in close
proximity, in one case the arm of the male encircling the neck of the
female. In other cases the remains of children are found with these. Or
while the lower interment is richly provided with grave-goods, above it
lie irregularly several skeletons, without grave-goods, and often with
head separated from the body, pointing to decapitation, while in one
case the arms had been tied behind the back. <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1162.md) All this

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

suggests, taken in connection with classical evidence regarding burial
customs, that the future life was life in the body, and that it was a
replica of this life, with the same affections, needs, and energies.
Certain passages in Irish texts also describe burials, and tell how the
dead were interred with ornaments and weapons, while it was a common
custom to bury the dead warrior in his armour, fully armed, and facing
the region whence enemies might be expected. Thus he was a perpetual
menace to them and prevented their attack. <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1](#fn_1163.md) Possibly this belief may account for
the elevated position of many tumuli. Animals were also sacrificed.
Hostages were buried alive with Fiachra, according to one text, and the
wives of heroes sometimes express their desire to be buried along with
their dead husbands. <span id="fr_1166"></span>[2](#fn_1164.md)

The idea that the body as well as the soul was immortal was probably
linked on to a very primitive belief regarding the dead, and one shared
by many peoples, that they lived on in the grave. This conception was
never forgotten, even in regions where the theory of a distant land of
the dead was evolved, or where the body was consumed by fire before
burial. It appears from such practices as binding the dead with cords,
or laying heavy stones or a mound of earth on the grave, probably to
prevent their egress, or feeding the dead with sacrificial food at the
grave, or from the belief that the dead come forth not as spirits, but
in the body from the grave. This primitive conception, of which the
belief in a subterranean world of the dead is an extension, long
survived among various

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

races, *e.g.* the Scandinavians, who believed in the barrow as the
abiding place of the dead, while they also had their conception of Hel
and Valhalla, or among the Slavs, side by side with Christian
conceptions. <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1](#fn_1165.md) It also survived
among the Celts, though another belief in the *orbis alius* had arisen.
This can be shown from modern and ancient folk-belief and custom.

In numerous Celtic folk-tales the dead rise in the body, not as ghosts,
from the grave, which is sometimes described as a house in which they
live. They perform their ordinary occupations in house or field; they
eat with the living, or avenge themselves upon them; if scourged, blood
is drawn from their bodies; and, in one curious Breton tale, a dead
husband visits his wife in bed and she then has a child by him, because,
as he said, "sa compte d'enfants" was not yet complete. <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[2](#fn_1166.md) In other stories a corpse becomes
animated and speaks or acts in presence of the living, or from the tomb
itself when it is disturbed. <span id="fr_1169"></span>[3](#fn_1167.md) The
earliest literary example of such a tale is the tenth century
"Adventures of Nera," based on older sources. In this Nera goes to tie a
withy to the foot of a man who has been hung. The corpse begs a drink,
and then forces Nera to carry him to a house, where he kills two
sleepers. <span id="fr_1170"></span>[4](#fn_1168.md) All such stories,
showing as they do that a corpse is really living, must in essence be of
great antiquity. Another common belief, found over the Celtic area, is
that the dead rise from the grave, not as ghosts, when they will, and
that they appear en masse on the night of All Saints, and join the
living. <span id="fr_1171"></span>[5](#fn_1169.md)

As a result of such beliefs, various customs are found in

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

use, apparently to permit of the corpse having freedom of movement,
contrary to the older custom of preventing its egress from the grave. In
the west of Ireland the feet of the corpse are left free, and the nails
are drawn from the coffin at the grave. In the Hebrides the threads of
the shroud are cut or the bindings of feet, hands, and face are raised
when the body is placed in the coffin, and in Brittany the arms and feet
are left free when the corpse is dressed. <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1170.md) The reason is said to be that the
spirit may have less trouble in getting to the spirit world, but it is
obvious that a more material view preceded and still underlies this
later gloss. Many stories are told illustrating these customs, and the
earlier belief, Christianised, appears in the tale of a woman who
haunted her friends because they had made her grave-clothes so short
that the fires of Purgatory burnt her knees. <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[2](#fn_1171.md)

Earlier customs recorded among the Celts also point to the existence of
this primitive belief influencing actual custom. Nicander says that the
Celts went by night to the tombs of great men to obtain oracles, so much
did they believe that they were still living there. <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[3](#fn_1172.md) In Ireland, oracles were also sought
by sleeping on funeral cairns, and it was to the grave of Fergus that
two bards resorted in order to obtain from him the lost story of the
*Táin*. We have also seen how, in Ireland, armed heroes exerted a
sinister influence upon enemies from their graves, which may thus have
been regarded as their homes--a belief also underlying the Welsh story
of Bran's head.

Where was the world of the dead situated? M. Reinach has shown, by a
careful comparison of the different uses of the

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

word *orbis*, that Lucan's words do not necessarily mean "another
world," but "another region," *i.e.* of this world. <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1](#fn_1173.md) If the Celts cherished so firmly the
belief that the dead lived on in the grave, a belief in an underworld of
the dead was bound in course of time to have been evolved as part of
their creed. To it all graves and tumuli would give access. Classical
observers apparently held that the Celtic future state was like their
own in being an underworld region, since they speak of the dead Celts as
*inferi*, or as going *ad Manes*, and Plutarch makes Camma speak of
descending to her dead husband. <span id="fr_1176"></span>[2](#fn_1174.md)
What differentiated it from their own gloomy underworld was its
exuberant life and immortality. This aspect of a subterranean land
presented no difficulty to the Celt, who had many tales of an underworld
or under-water region more beautiful and blissful than anything on
earth. Such a subterranean world must have been that of the Celtic
Dispater, a god of fertility and growth, the roots of things being
nourished from his kingdom. From him men had descended, <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[3](#fn_1175.md) probably a myth of their coming forth
from his subterranean kingdom, and to him they returned after death to a
blissful life.

Several writers, notably M. D'Arbois, assume that the *orbis alius* of
the dead was the Celtic island Elysium. But that Elysium *never* appears
in the tales as a land of the dead. It is a land of gods and deathless
folk who are not those who have passed from this world by death. Mortals
may reach it by favour, but only while still in life. It might be argued
that Elysium was regarded in pagan times as the land of the dead, but
after Christian eschatological views prevailed, it became a kind of
fairyland. But the existing tales give no hint of this, and, after being
carefully examined, they show that Elysium

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

had always been a place distinct from that of the departed, though there
may have arisen a tendency to confuse the two.

If there was a genuine Celtic belief in an island of the dead, it could
have been no more than a local one, else Cæsar would not have spoken as
he does of the Celtic Dispater. Such a local belief now exists on the
Breton coast, but it is mainly concerned with the souls of the
drowned. <span id="fr_1178"></span>[1](#fn_1176.md) A similar local belief
may explain the story told by Procopius, who says that Brittia
(Britain), an island lying off the mouth of the Rhine, is divided from
north to south by a wall beyond which is a noxious region. This is a
distorted reminiscence of the Roman wall, which would appear to run in
this direction if Ptolemy's map, in which Scotland lies at right angles
to England, had been consulted. Thither fishermen from the opposite
coast are compelled to ferry over at dead of night the shades of the
dead, unseen to them, but marshalled by a mysterious leader. <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[2](#fn_1177.md) Procopius may have mingled some local
belief with the current tradition that Ulysses' island of the shades lay
in the north, or in the west. <span id="fr_1180"></span>[3](#fn_1178.md) In
any case his story makes of the gloomy land of the shades a very
different region from the blissful Elysium of the Celts and from their
joyous *orbis alius*, nor is it certain that he is referring to a Celtic
people.

Traces of the idea of an underworld of the dead exist in Breton
folk-belief. The dead must travel across a subterranean ocean, and
though there is scarcely any tradition regarding what happens on
landing, M. Sébillot thinks that formerly "there existed in the
subterranean world a sort of centralisation of the different states of
the dead." If so, this must have been founded on pagan belief. The
interior of the earth is

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

also believed to be the abode of fabulous beings, of giants, and of
fantastic animals, and there is also a subterranean fairy world. In all
this we may see a survival of the older belief, modified by Christian
teaching, since the Bretons suppose that purgatory and hell are beneath
the earth and accessible from its surface. <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[1](#fn_1179.md)

Some British folk-lore brought to Greece by Demetrius and reported by
Plutarch might seem to suggest that certain persons--the mighty
dead--were privileged to pass to the island Elysium. Some islands near
Britain were called after gods and heroes, and the inhabitants of one of
these were regarded as sacrosanct by the Britons, like the priestesses
of Sena. They were visited by Demetrius, who was told that the storms
which arose during his visit were caused by the passing away of some of
the "mighty" or of the "great souls." It may have been meant that such
mighty ones passed to the more distant islands, but this is certainly
not stated. In another island, Kronos was imprisoned, watched over by
Briareus, and guarded by demons. <span id="fr_1182"></span>[2](#fn_1180.md)
Plutarch refers to these islands in another work, repeating the story of
Kronos, and saying that his island is mild and fragrant, that people
live there waiting on the god who sometimes appears to them and prevents
their departing. Meanwhile they are happy and know no care, spending
their time in sacrificing and hymn-singing or in studying legends and
philosophy.

Plutarch has obviously mingled Celtic Elysium beliefs with the classical
conception of the Druids. <span id="fr_1183"></span>[3](#fn_1181.md) In
Elysium there is

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

no care, and favoured mortals who pass there are generally prevented
from returning to earth. The reference to Kronos may also be based
partly on myths of Celtic gods of Elysium, partly on tales of heroes who
departed to mysterious islands or to the hollow hills where they lie
asleep, but whence they will one day return to benefit their people. So
Arthur passed to Avalon, but in other tales be and his warriors are
asleep beneath Craig-y-Ddinas, just as Fionn and his men rest within
this or that hill in the Highlands. Similar legends are told of other
Celtic heroes, and they witness to the belief that great men who had
died would return in the hour of their people's need. In time they were
thought not to have died at all, but to be merely sleeping and waiting
for their hour. <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1](#fn_1182.md) The belief is
based on the idea that the dead are alive in grave or barrow, or in a
spacious land below the earth, or that dead warriors can menace their
foes from the tomb.

Thus neither in old sagas, nor in *Märchen*, nor in popular tradition,
is the island Elysium a world of the dead. For the most part the pagan
eschatology has been merged in that of Christianity, while the Elysium
belief has remained intact and still survives it a whole series of
beautiful tales.

The world of the dead was in all respects a *replica* of this world, but
it was happier. In existing Breton and Irish belief--a survival of the
older conception of the bodily state of the dead--they resume their
tools, crafts, and occupations, and they preserve their old feelings.
Hence, when they appear on earth, it is in bodily form and in their
customary dress. Like

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

the pagan Gauls, the Breton remembers unpaid debts, and cannot rest till
they are paid, and in Brittany, Ireland, and the Highlands the food and
clothes given to the poor after a death, feed and clothe the dead in the
other world. <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1183.md) If the world of the
dead was subterranean,--a theory supported by current folk-belief, <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[2](#fn_1184.md)--the Earth-goddess or the Earth-god,
who had been first the earth itself, then a being living below its
surface and causing fertility, could not have become the divinity of the
dead until the multitude of single graves or barrows, in each of which
the dead lived, had become a wide subterranean region of the dead. This
divinity was the source of life and growth; hence he or she was regarded
as the progenitor of mankind, who had come forth from the underworld and
would return there at death. It is not impossible that the Breton
conception of Ankou, death personified, is a reminiscence of the Celtic
Dispater. He watches over all things beyond the grave, and carries off
the dead to his kingdom. But if so he has been altered for the worse by
mediæval ideas of "Death the skeleton" <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[3](#fn_1185.md) He is a grisly god of death, whereas
the Celtic Dis was a beneficent god of the dead who enjoyed a happy
immortality. They were not cold phantasms, but alive and endowed with
corporeal form and able to enjoy the things of a better existence, and
clad in the beautiful raiment and gaudy ornaments which were loved so
much on earth. Hence Celtic warriors did not fear death, and suicide was
extremely common, while Spanish Celts sang hymns in praise of death, and
others celebrated the birth of men with mourning, but their deaths with
joy. <span id="fr_1188"></span>[4](#fn_1186.md) Lucan's words are thus the
truest expression of Celtic eschatology--"In another

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

region the spirit animates the members; death, if your lore be true, is
but the passage to enduring life."

There is no decisive evidence pointing to any theory of moral
retribution beyond the grave among the pagan Celts. Perhaps, since the
hope of immortality made warriors face death without a tremor, it may
have been held, as many other races have believed, that cowards would
miss the bliss of the future state. Again, in some of the Irish
Christian visions of the other-world and in existing folk-belief,
certain characteristics of hell may not be derived from Christian
eschatology, *e.g.* the sufferings of the dead from cold. <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[1](#fn_1187.md) This might point to an old belief in a
cold realm whither some of the dead were banished. In the Adventures of
S. Columba's Clerics, hell is reached by a bridge over a glen of
fire, <span id="fr_1190"></span>[2](#fn_1188.md) and a narrow bridge
leading to the other world is a common feature in most mythologies. But
here it may be borrowed from Scandinavian sources, or from such
Christian writings as the Dialogues of S. Gregory the Great. <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[3](#fn_1189.md) It might be contended that the
Christian doctrine of hell has absorbed an earlier pagan theory of
retribution, but of this there is now no trace in the sagas or in
classical references to the Celtic belief in the future life. Nor is
there any reference to a day of judgment, for the passage in which
Loegaire speaks of the dead buried with their weapons till "the day of
Erdathe," though glossed "the day of judgment of the Lord," does not
refer to such a judgment. <span id="fr_1192"></span>[4](#fn_1190.md) If an
ethical blindness be attributed to the Celts for their apparent lack of
any theory of retribution, it should

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

be remembered that we must not judge a people's ethics wholly by their
views of future punishment. Scandinavians, Greeks, and Semites up to a
certain stage were as unethical as the Celts in this respect, and the
Christian hell, as conceived by many theologians, is far from suggesting
an ethical Deity.

the Mighty" (Loth, i. 69, *et passim*). To the storm incident and the
passing of the mighty, there is a curious parallel in Fijian belief. A
clap of thunder was explained as "the noise of a spirit, we being near
the place in which spirits plunge to enter the other world, and a chief
in the neighbourhood having just died" (Williams, *Fiji*, i. 204).

the presence of these heroes, who awoke. If the visitor had the courage
to tell them that the hour had not yet come, they fell asleep again, and
he escaped. In Brittany, rocky clefts are believed to be the entrance to
the world of the dead, like the cave of Lough Dearg. Similar stories
were probably told of these in pagan times, though they are now adapted
to Christian beliefs in purgatory or hell.
