### CHAPTER X.

# THE CULT OF THE DEAD.

THE custom of burying grave-goods with the dead, or slaying wife or
slaves on the tomb, does not necessarily point to a cult of the dead,
yet when such practices survive over a long period they assume the form
of a cult. These customs flourished among the Celts, and, taken in
connection with the reverence for the sepulchres of the dead, they point
to a worship of ancestral spirits as well as of great departed heroes.
Heads of the slain were offered to the "strong shades"--the ghosts of
tribal heroes whose praises were sung by bards. <span
id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_530.md) When such heads were placed on houses,
they may have been devoted to the family ghosts. The honour in which
mythic or real heroes were held may point to an actual cult, the hero
being worshipped when dead, while he still continued his guardianship of
the tribe. We know also that the tomb of King Cottius in the Alps was a
sacred place, that Irish kings were often inaugurated on ancestral
burial cairns, and that Irish gods were associated with barrows of the
dead. <span id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_531.md)

The cult of the dead culminated at the family hearth, around which the
dead were even buried, as among the Aeduii; this latter custom may have
been general. <span id="fr_533"></span>[3](#fn_532.md) In any case the
belief in the presence of ancestral ghosts around the hearth was
widespread, as existing superstitions show. In

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Brittany the dead seek warmth at the hearth by
night, and a feast is spread for them on All Souls' eve, or crumbs are
left for them after a family gathering. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_533.md) But generally the family ghost has
become a brownie, lutin, or pooka, haunting the hearth and doing the
household work. <span id="fr_535"></span>[2](#fn_534.md) Fairy corresponds
in all respects to old ancestral ghost, and the one has succeeded to the
place of the other, while the fairy is even said to be the ghost of a
dead person. <span id="fr_536"></span>[3](#fn_535.md) Certain archæological
remains have also a connection with this ancient cult. Among Celtic
remains in Gaul are found andirons of clay, ornamented with a ram's
head. M. Dechelette sees in this "the symbol of sacrifice offered to the
souls of ancestors on the altar of the hearth." <span
id="fr_537"></span>[4](#fn_536.md) The ram was already associated as a
sacrificial animal with the cult of fire on the hearth, and by an easy
transition it was connected with the cult of the dead there. It is found
as an emblem on ancient tombs, and the domestic Lar was purified by the
immolation of a ram. <span id="fr_538"></span>[5](#fn_537.md) Figurines of
a ram have been found in Gaulish tombs, and it is associated with the
god of the underworld. <span id="fr_539"></span>[6](#fn_538.md) The ram of
the andirons was thus a permanent representative of the victim offered
in the cult of the dead. A mutilated inscription on one of them may
stand for *Laribus augustis*, and certain markings on others may
represent the garlands twined round the victim. <span
id="fr_540"></span>[7](#fn_539.md) Serpents with rams' heads occur on the
monuments of the underworld god. The serpent was a chthonian god or the

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

emblem of such a god, and it may have been thought appropriate to give
it the head of an animal associated with the cult of the dead.

The dead were also fed at the grave or in the house. Thus cups were
placed in the recess of a well in the churchyard of Kilranelagh by those
interring a child under five, and the ghost of the child was supposed to
supply the other spirits with water from these cups. <span
id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_540.md) In Ireland, after a death, food is
placed out for the spirits, or, at a burial, nuts are placed in the
coffin. <span id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_541.md) In some parts of France,
milk is poured out on the grave, and both in Brittany and in Scotland
the dead are supposed to partake of the funeral feast. <span
id="fr_543"></span>[3](#fn_542.md) These are survivals from pagan times and
correspond to the rites in use among those who still worship ancestors.
In Celtic districts a cairn or a cross is placed over the spot where a
violent or accidental death has occurred, the purpose being to appease
the ghost, and a stone is often added to the cairn by all
passers-by. <span id="fr_544"></span>[4](#fn_543.md)

Festivals were held in Ireland on the anniversaries of the death of
kings or chiefs, and these were also utilised for purposes of trade,
pleasure, or politics. They sometimes occurred on the great festivals,
*e.g.* Lugnasad and Samhain, and were occasionally held at the great
burial-places. <span id="fr_545"></span>[5](#fn_544.md) Thus the gathering
at Taillti on Lugnasad was said to have been founded by Lug in memory of
his foster-mother, Tailtiu, and the Leinstermen met at Carman on the
same day to commemorate King Garman, or in a variant account, a woman
called Carman. She and her sons had tried to blight the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

corn of the Tuatha Dé Danann, but the sons were driven off and she died
of grief, begging that a fair should always be held in her name, and
promising abundance of milk, fruit, and fish for its observance. <span
id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_545.md) These may be ætiological myths
explaining the origin of these festivals on the analogy of funeral
festivals, but more likely, since Lugnasad was a harvest festival, they
are connected with the custom of slaying a representative of the
corn-spirit. The festival would become a commemoration of all such
victims, but when the custom itself had ceased it would be associated
with one particular personage, the corn-goddess regarded as a mortal.

This would be the case where the victim was a woman, but where a male
was slain, the analogy of the slaying of the divine king or his
*succedaneum* would lead to the festivals being regarded as
commemorative of a king, *e.g.* Garman. This agrees with the statement
that observance of the festival produced plenty; non-observance, dearth.
The victims were slain to obtain plenty, and the festival would also
commemorate those who had died for this good cause, while it would also
appease their ghosts should these be angry at their violent deaths.
Certain of the dead were thus commemorated at Lugnasad, a festival of
fertility. Both the corn-spirit or divinity slain in the reaping of the
corn, and the human victims, were appeased by its observance. <span
id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_546.md) The legend of Carman makes her hostile
to the corn--a curious way of regarding a corn-goddess. But we have
already seen that gods of fertility were sometimes thought of as causing
blight, and in folk-belief the corn-spirit is occasionally believed to
be dangerous. Such inversions occur wherever revolutions in religion
take place.

The great commemoration of the dead was held on

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Samhain eve, a festival intended to aid the
dying powers of vegetation, whose life, however, was still manifested in
evergreen shrubs, in the mistletoe, in the sheaf of corn from last
harvest--the abode of the corn-spirit. <span
id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_547.md) Probably, also, human representatives of
the vegetation or corn-spirit were slain, and this may have suggested
the belief in the presence of their ghosts at this festival. Or the
festival being held at the time of the death of vegetation, the dead
would naturally be commemorated then. Or, as in Scandinavia, they may
have been held to have an influence on fertility, as an extension of the
belief that certain slain persons represented spirits of fertility, or
because trees and plants growing on the barrows of the dead were thought
to be tenanted by their spirits. <span id="fr_549"></span>[2](#fn_548.md)
In Scandinavia, the dead were associated with female spirits or
*fylgjur*, identified with the *disir*, a kind of earth-goddesses,
living in hollow hills. <span id="fr_550"></span>[3](#fn_549.md) The
nearest Celtic analogy to these is the *Matres*, goddesses of fertility.
Bede says that Christmas eve was called *Modranicht*, "Mothers'
Night," <span id="fr_551"></span>[4](#fn_550.md) and as many of the rites
of Samhain were transferred to Yule, the former date of *Modranicht* may
have been Samhain, just as the Scandinavian *Disablot*, held in
November, was a festival of the disir and of the dead. <span
id="fr_552"></span>[5](#fn_551.md) It has been seen that the Celtic
Earth-god was lord of the dead, and that he probably took the place of
an Earth-goddess or goddesses, to whom the *Matres* certainly
correspond. Hence the connection of the dead with female Earth-spirits
would be explained. Mother Earth had received the dead before her place
was taken by the Celtic Dispater. Hence the time of Earth's

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

decay was the season when the dead, her children, would be commemorated.
Whatever be the reason, Celts, Teutons, and others have commemorated the
dead at the beginning of winter, which was the beginning of a new year,
while a similar festival of the dead at New Year is held in many other
lands.

Both in Ireland and in Brittany, on November eve food is laid out for
the dead who come to visit the houses and to warm themselves at the fire
in the stillness of the night, and in Brittany a huge log burns on the
hearth. We have here returned to the cult of the dead at the
hearth. <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_552.md) Possibly the Yule log was
once a log burned on the hearth--the place of the family ghosts--at
Samhain, when new fire was kindled in each house. On it libations were
poured, which would then have been meant for the dead. The Yule log and
the log of the Breton peasants would thus be the domestic aspect of the
fire ritual, which had its public aspect in the Samhain bonfires.

All this has been in part affected by the Christian feast of All Souls.
Dr. Frazer thinks that the feast of All Saints (November 1st) was
intended to take the place of the pagan cult of the dead. As it failed
to do this, All Souls, a festival of all the dead, was added on November
2nd. <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_553.md) To some extent, but not
entirely, it has neutralised the pagan rites, for the old ideas
connected with Samhain still survive here and there. It is also to be
noted that in some cases the friendly aspect of the dead has been lost
sight of, and, like the *síd*-folk, they are popularly connected with
evil powers which are in the ascendant on Samhain eve.
