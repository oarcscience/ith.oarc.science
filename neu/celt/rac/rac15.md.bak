### CHAPTER XII.

# RIVER AND WELL WORSHIP.

AMONG the Celts the testimony of contemporary witnesses, inscriptions,
votive offerings, and survivals, shows the importance of the cult of
waters and of water divinities. Mr. Gomme argues that Celtic
water-worship was derived from the pre-Celtic aborigines, <span
id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_595.md) but if so, the Celts must have had a
peculiar aptitude for it, since they were so enthusiastic in its
observance. What probably happened was that the Celts, already
worshippers of the waters, freely adopted local cults of water wherever
they came. Some rivers or river-goddesses in Celtic regions seem to
posses pre-Celtic names. <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_596.md)

Treasures were flung into a sacred lake near Toulouse to cause a
pestilence to cease. Caepion, who afterwards fished up this treasure,
fell soon after in battle--a punishment for cupidity, and *aurum
Tolosanum* now became an expression for goods dishonestly
acquired. <span id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_597.md) A yearly festival,
lasting three days, took place at Lake Gévaudan. Garments, food, and wax
were thrown into the waters, and animals were sacrificed. On the fourth
day, it is said, there never failed to spring up a tempest of rain,
thunder, and lightning--a strange reward for this worship of the
lake. <span id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_598.md) S. Columba routed the
spirits of a Scottish fountain which was worshipped as a god, and

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

the well now became sacred, perhaps to the saint himself, who washed in
it and blessed it so that it cured diseases. <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_599.md)

On inscriptions a river name is prefixed by some divine epithet--*dea*,
*augusta*, and the worshipper records his gratitude for benefits
received from the divinity or the river itself. Bormanus, Bormo or
Borvo, Danuvius (the Danube), and Luxovius are found on inscriptions as
names of river or fountain gods, but goddesses are more
numerous--Acionna, Aventia, Bormana, Brixia, Carpundia, Clutoida,
Divona, Sirona, Ura--well-nymphs; and Icauna (the Yonne), Matrona, and
Sequana (the Seine)--river-goddesses. <span
id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_600.md) No inscription to the goddess of a lake
has yet been found. Some personal names like Dubrogenos (son of the
Dubron), Enigenus (son of the Aenus), and the belief of Virdumarus that
one of his ancestors was the Rhine, <span
id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_601.md) point to the idea that river-divinities
might have amours with mortals and beget progeny called by their names.
In Ireland, Conchobar was so named from the river whence his mother
Nessa drew water, perhaps because he was a child of the river-god. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_602.md)

The name of the water-divinity was sometimes given to the place of his
or her cult, or to the towns which sprang up on the banks of rivers-the
divinity thus becoming a tutelary god. Many towns (*e.g.* Divonne or
Dyonne, etc.) have names derived from a common Celtic river name Deuona,
"divine." This name in various forms is found all over the Celtic
area, <span id="fr_604"></span>[5](#fn_603.md) and there is little doubt
that the Celts, in their onward progress, named river after river by the
name of the same

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

divinity, believing that each new river was a part of his or her
kingdom. The name was probably first an appellative, then a personal
name, the divine river becoming a divinity. Deus Nemausus occurs on
votive tablets at Nimes, the name Nemausus being that of the clear and
abundant spring there whence flowed the river of the same name. A
similar name occurs in other regions--Nemesa, a tributary of the
Moselle; Nemh, the source of the Tara and the former name of the
Blackwater; and Nimis, a Spanish river mentioned by Appian. Another
group includes the Matrona (Marne), the Moder, the Madder, the Maronne
and Maronna, and others, probably derived from a word signifying
"mother." <span id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_604.md) The mother-river was
that which watered a whole region, just as in the Hindu sacred books the
waters are mothers, sources of fertility. The Celtic mother-rivers were
probably goddesses, akin to the *Matres*, givers of plenty and
fertility. In Gaul, Sirona, a river-goddess, is represented like the
*Matres*. She was associated with Grannos, perhaps as his mother, and
Professor Rhŷs equates the pair with the Welsh Modron and Mabon; Modron
is probably connected with Matrona. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_605.md) In any case the Celts regarded rivers as
bestowers of life, health, and plenty, and offered them rich gifts and
sacrifices. <span id="fr_607"></span>[3](#fn_606.md)

Gods like Grannos, Borvo, and others, equated with Apollo, presided over
healing springs, and they are usually associated with goddesses, as
their husbands or sons. But as the goddesses are more numerous, and as
most Celtic river names are feminine, female divinities of rivers and
springs doubtless had the earlier and foremost place, especially as

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

their cult was connected with fertility. The gods, fewer in number, were
all equated with Apollo, but the goddesses were not merged by the Romans
into the personality of one goddess, since they themselves had their
groups of river-goddesses, Nymphs and Naiads. Before the Roman conquest
the cult of water-divinities, friends of mankind, must have formed a
large part of the popular religion of Gaul, and their names may be
counted by hundreds. Thermal springs had also their genii, and they were
appropriated by the Romans, so that the local gods now shared their
healing powers with Apollo, Æsculapius, and the Nymphs. Thus every
spring, every woodland brook, every river in glen or valley, the roaring
cataract, and the lake were haunted by divine beings, mainly thought of
as beautiful females with whom the *Matres* were undoubtedly associated.
There they revealed themselves to their worshippers, and when paganism
had passed away, they remained as *fées* or fairies haunting spring, or
well, or river. <span id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_607.md) Scores of fairy
wells still exist, and by them mediæval knights had many a fabled amour
with those beautiful beings still seen by the "ignorant" but romantic
peasant.

Sanctuaries were erected at these springs by grateful worshippers, and
at some of them festivals were held, or they were the resort of
pilgrims. As sources of fertility they had a place in the ritual of the
great festivals, and sacred wells were visited on Midsummer day, when
also the river-gods claimed their human victims. Some of the goddesses
were represented by statues or busts in Gallo-Roman times, if not
earlier, and other images of them which have been found were of the
nature of *ex-votos*, presented by worshippers in gratitude

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

for the goddess's healing gifts. Money, ingots of gold or silver, and
models of limbs or other parts of the body which had been or were
desired to be healed, were also presented. Gregory of Tours says of the
Gauls that they "represent in wood or bronze the members in which they
suffer, and whose healing they desire, and place them in a
temple." <span id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_608.md) Contact of the model with
the divinity brought healing to the actual limbs on the principle of
sympathetic magic. Many such models have been discovered. Thus in the
shrine of Dea Sequana was found a vase with over a hundred; another
contained over eight hundred. Inscriptions were engraved on plaques
which were fastened to the walls of temples, or placed in springs. <span
id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_609.md) Leaden tablets with inscriptions were
placed in springs by those who desired healing or when the waters were
low, and on some the actual waters are hardly discriminated from the
divinities. The latter are asked to heal or flow or swell--words which
apply more to the waters than to them, while the tablets, with their
frank animism, also show that, in some cases, there were many elemental
spirits of a well, only some of whom were rising to the rank of a
goddess. They are called collectively *Niskas*--the Nixies of later
tradition, but some have personal names--Lerano, Dibona, Dea--showing
that they were tending to become separate divine personalities. The
Peisgi are also appealed to, perhaps the later Piskies, unless the word
is a corrupt form of a Celtic *peiskos*, or the Latin *piscus*,
"fish." <span id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_610.md) This is unlikely, as fish
could not exist in a warm sulphurous spring, though the Celts believed
in the sacred fish of wells or streams. The fairies now associated with
wells or with a

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

water-world beneath them, are usually nameless, and only in a few cases
have a definite name. They, like the older spirits of the wells, have
generally a beneficent character. <span id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_611.md)
Thus in the fountains of Logres dwelt damsels who fed the wayfarer with
meat and bread, until grievous wrong was done them, when they
disappeared and the land became waste. <span
id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_612.md) Occasionally, however, they have a more
malevolent character. <span id="fr_614"></span>[3](#fn_613.md)

The spirit of the waters was often embodied in an animal, usually a
fish. Even now in Brittany the fairy dweller in a spring has the form of
an eel, while in the seventeenth century Highland wells contained fish
so sacred that no one dared to catch them. <span
id="fr_615"></span>[4](#fn_614.md) In Wales S. Cybi's well contained a huge
eel in whose virtues the villagers believed, and terror prevailed when
any one dared to take it from the water. Two sacred fish still exist in
a holy well at Nant Peris, and are replaced by others when they die, the
dead fish being buried. <span id="fr_616"></span>[5](#fn_615.md) This
latter act, solemnly performed, is a true sign of the divine or sacred
character of the animal. Many wells with sacred fish exist in Ireland,
and the fish have usually some supernatural quality--they never alter in
size, they become invisible, or they take the form of beautiful
women. <span id="fr_617"></span>[6](#fn_616.md) Any one destroying such
fish was regarded as a sacrilegious person, and sometimes a hostile
tribe killed and ate the sacred fish of a district invaded by them, just
as Egyptians of one nome insulted those of another by killing their
sacred animals. <span id="fr_618"></span>[7](#fn_617.md) In old Irish
beliefs the salmon was the fish of knowledge. Thus whoever ate the
salmon of Connla's

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

well was dowered with the wisdom which had come to them through eating
nuts from the hazels of knowledge around the well. In this case the
sacred fish was eaten, but probably by certain persons only--those who
had the right to do so. Sinend, who went to seek inspiration from the
well, probably by eating one of its salmon, was overwhelmed by its
waters. The legend of the salmon is perhaps based on old ritual
practices of the occasional eating of a divine animal. In other cases,
legends of a miraculous supply of fish from sacred wells are perhaps
later Christian traditions of former pagan beliefs or customs concerning
magical methods of increasing a sacred or totem animal species, like
those used in Central Australia and New Guinea. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_618.md) The frog is sometimes the sacred animal,
and this recalls the *Märchen* of the Frog Bridegroom living in a well,
who insisted on marrying the girl who drew its waters. Though this tale
is not peculiar to the Celts, it is not improbable that the divine
animal guardian of a well may have become the hero of a folk-tale,
especially as such wells were sometimes tabu to women. <span
id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_619.md) A fly was the guardian spirit of S.
Michael's well in Banffshire. Auguries regarding health were drawn from
its movements, and it was believed that the fly, when it grew old,
transmigrated into another. <span id="fr_621"></span>[3](#fn_620.md)

Such beliefs were not peculiarly Celtic. They are found in all European
folk-lore, and they are still alive among savages--the animal being
itself divine or the personification of a divinity. A huge sacred eel
was worshipped by the Fijians; in North America and elsewhere there were
serpent guardians of the waters; and the Semites worshipped the fish of
sacred wells as incarnations or, symbols of a god.

Later Celtic folk-belief associated monstrous and malevolent

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

beings with rivers and lakes. These may be the older divinities to whom
a demoniac form has been given, but even in pagan times such monstrous
beings may have been believed in, or they may be survivals of the more
primitive monstrous guardians of the waters. The last were dragons or
serpents, conventional forms of the reptiles which once dwelt in watery
places, attacking all who came near. This old idea certainly survived in
Irish and Highland belief, for the Fians conquered huge dragons or
serpents in lochs, or saints chained them to the bottom of the waters.
Hence the common place-name of Loch na piast, "Loch of the Monster." In
other tales they emerge and devour the impious or feast on the
dead. <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_621.md) The *Dracs* of French
superstition--river monsters who assume human form and drag down victims
to the depths, where they devour them--resemble these.

The *Each Uisge*, or "Water-horse," a horse with staring eyes, webbed
feet, and a slimy coat, is still dreaded. He assumes different forms and
lures the unwary to destruction, or he makes love in human shape to
women, some of whom discover his true nature by seeing a piece of
water-weed in his hair, and only escape with difficulty. Such a
water-horse was forced to drag the chariot of S. Fechin of Fore, and
under his influence became "gentler than any other horse." <span
id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_622.md) Many Highland lochs are still haunted by
this dreaded being, and he is also known in Ireland and France, where,
however, he has more of a tricky and less of a demoniac nature. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_623.md) His horse form is perhaps

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

connected with the similar form ascribed to Celtic water-divinities.
Manannan's horses were the waves, and he was invariably associated with
a horse. Epona, the horse-goddess, was perhaps originally goddess of a
spring, and, like the *Matres*, she is sometimes connected with the
waters. <span id="fr_625"></span>[1](#fn_624.md) Horses were also
sacrificed to river-divinities. <span id="fr_626"></span>[2](#fn_625.md)
But the beneficent water-divinities in their horse form have undergone a
curious distortion, perhaps as the result of later Christian influences.
The name of one branch of the Fomorians, the Goborchinn, means the
"Horse-headed," and one of their kings was Eochaid Echchenn, or
"Horse-head." <span id="fr_627"></span>[3](#fn_626.md) Whether these have
any connection with the water-horse is uncertain.

The foaming waters may have suggested another animal personification,
since the name of the Boyne in Ptolemy, βουούινδα, is derived from a
primitive *bóu-s*, "ox," and *vindo-s*, "white," in Irish *bó find*,
"white cow." <span id="fr_628"></span>[4](#fn_627.md) But it is not certain
that this or the Celtic cult of the bull was connected with the belief
in the *Tarbh Uisge*, or "Water-bull," which had no ears and could
assume other shapes. It dwells in lochs and is generally friendly to
man, occasionally emerging to mate with ordinary cows. In the Isle of
Man the *Tarroo Ushtey*, however, begets monsters. <span
id="fr_629"></span>[5](#fn_628.md) These Celtic water-monsters have a
curious resemblance to the Australian *Bunyip*.

The *Uruisg*, often confused with the brownie, haunts lonely places and
waterfalls, and, according to his mood, helps or harms the wayfarer. His
appearance is that of a man with

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

shaggy hair and beard. <span id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_629.md) In Wales
the *afanc* is a water-monster, though the word first meant "dwarf,"
then "water-dwarf," of whom many kinds existed. They correspond to the
Irish water-dwarfs, the *Luchorpáin*, descended with the Fomorians and
Goborchinn from Ham. <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_630.md)

In other cases the old water beings have a more pleasing form, like the
syrens and other fairy beings who haunt French rivers, or the mermaids
of Irish estuaries. <span id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_631.md) In Celtic
France and Britain lake fairies are connected with a water-world like
that of Elysium tales, the region of earlier divinities. <span
id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_632.md) They unite with mortals, who, as in the
Swan-maiden tales, lose their fairy brides through breaking a tabu. In
many Welsh tales the bride is obtained by throwing bread and cheese on
the waters, when she appears with an old man who has all the strength of
youth. He presents his daughter and a number of fairy animals to the
mortal. When she disappears into the waters after the breaking of the
tabu, the lake is sometimes drained in order to recover her; the father
then appears and threatens to submerge the whole district. Father and
daughters are earlier lake divinities, and in the bread and cheese we
may see a relic of the offerings to these. <span
id="fr_634"></span>[5](#fn_633.md)

Human sacrifice to water-divinities is suggested by the belief that
water-monsters devour human beings, and by the tradition that a river
claims its toll of victims every year. In popular rhymes the annual
character of the sacrifice is

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

hinted at, and Welsh legend tells of a voice heard once a year from
rivers or lakes, crying, "The hour is come, but the man is not." <span
id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_634.md) Here there is the trace of an abandoned
custom of sacrifice and of the traditional idea of the anger of the
divinity at being neglected. Such spirits or gods, like the
water-monsters, would be ever on the watch to capture those who
trespassed on their domain. In some cases the victim is supposed to be
claimed on Midsummer eve, the time of the sacrifice in the pagan
period. <span id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_635.md) The spirits of wells had
also a harmful aspect to those, at least, who showed irreverence in
approaching them. This is seen in legends about the danger of looking
rashly into a well or neglecting to cover it, or in the belief that one
must not look back after visiting the well. Spirits of wells were also
besought to do harm to enemies.

Legends telling of the danger of removing or altering a well, or of the
well moving elsewhere because a woman washed her hands in it, point to
old tabus concerning wells. Boand, wife of Nechtain, went to the fairy
well which he and his cup-bearers alone might visit, and when she showed
her contempt for it, the waters rose and destroyed her. They now flow as
the river Boyne. Sinend met with a similar fate for intruding on
Connla's well, in this case the pursuing waters became the
Shannon. <span id="fr_637"></span>[3](#fn_636.md) These are variants of a
story

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

which might be used to explain the origin of any river, but the legends
suggest that certain wells were tabu to women because certain branches
of knowledge, taught by the well, must be reserved for men. <span
id="fr_638"></span>[1](#fn_637.md) The legends said in effect, "See what
came of women obtruding beyond their proper sphere." Savage "mysteries"
are usually tabu to women, who also exclude men from their sacred rites.
On the other hand, as all tribal lore was once in the hands of the wise
woman, such tabus and legends may have arisen when men began to claim
such lore. In other legends women are connected with wells, as the
guardians who must keep them locked up save when water was drawn. When
the woman neglected to replace the cover, the waters burst forth,
overwhelming her, and formed a loch. <span
id="fr_639"></span>[2](#fn_638.md) The woman is the priestess of the well
who, neglecting part of its ritual, is punished. Even in recent times we
find sacred wells in charge of a woman who instructs the visitors in the
due ritual to be performed. <span id="fr_640"></span>[3](#fn_639.md) If
such legends and survivals thus point to former Celtic Priestesses of
wells, these are paralleled by the Norse Horgabrudar, guardians of
wells, now elves living in the waters. <span
id="fr_641"></span>[4](#fn_640.md) That such legends are based on the
ritual of well-worship is suggested by Boand's walking three times
*widdershins* round the well, instead of the

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

customary *deiseil*. The due ritual must be observed, and the stories
are a warning against its neglect.

In spite of twenty centuries of Christianity and the anathemas of saints
and councils, the old pagan practices at healing wells have survived--a
striking instance of human conservatism. S. Patrick found the pagans of
his day worshipping a well called *Slán*, "health-giving," and offering
sacrifices to it, <span id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_641.md) and the Irish
peasant to-day has no doubt that there is something divine about his
holy wells. The Celts brought the belief in the divinity of springs and
wells with them, but would naturally adopt local cults wherever they
found them. Afterwards the Church placed the old pagan wells under the
protection of saints, but part of the ritual often remained unchanged.
Hence many wells have been venerated for ages by different races and
through changes in religion and polity. Thus at the thermal springs of
Vicarello offerings have been found which show that their cult has
continued from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age, to the days of
Roman civilisation, and so into modern times; nor is this a solitary
instance. <span id="fr_643"></span>[2](#fn_642.md) But it serves to show
that all races, high and low, preserve the great outlines of primitive
nature religion unchanged. In all probability the ritual of the healing
wells has also remained in great part unaltered, and wherever it is
found it follows the same general type. The patient perambulated the
well three times *deiseil* or sun-wise, taking care not to utter a word.
Then he knelt at the well and prayed to the divinity for his healing. In
modern times the saint, but occasionally the well itself, is prayed
to. <span id="fr_644"></span>[3](#fn_643.md) Then he drank of the waters,
bathed in them, or laved his limbs or sores, probably attended

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

by the priestess of the well. Having paid her dues, he made an offering
to the divinity of the well, and affixed the bandage or part of his
clothing to the well or a tree near by, that through it he might be in
continuous *rapport* with the healing influences. Ritual formulæ
probably accompanied these acts, but otherwise no word was spoken, and
the patient must not look back on leaving the well. Special times,
Beltane, Midsummer, or August 1st, were favourable for such
visits, <span id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_644.md) and where a patient was
too ill to present himself at the well, another might perform the ritual
for him. <span id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_645.md)

The rag, or clothing hung on the tree seems to connect the spirit of the
tree with that of the well, and tree and well are often found together.
But sometimes it is thrown into the well, just as the Gaulish villagers
of S. Gregory's day threw offerings of cloth and wool into a sacred
lake. <span id="fr_647"></span>[3](#fn_646.md) The rag is even now regarded
in the light of an offering, and such offerings, varying from valuable
articles of clothing to mere rags, are still hung on sacred trees by the
folk. It thus probably has always had a sacrificial aspect in the ritual
of the well, but as magic and religion constantly blend, it had also its
magical aspect. The rag, once in contact with the patient, transferred
his disease to the tree, or, being still subtly connected with him,
through it the healing properties passed over to him.

The offering thrown into the well--a pin, coin, etc., may also have this
double aspect. The sore is often pricked or rubbed with the pin as if to
transfer the disease to the well, and if picked up by another person,
the disease may pass to

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

him. This is also true of the coin. <span
id="fr_648"></span>[1](#fn_647.md) But other examples show the sacrificial
nature of the pin or other trifle, which is probably symbolic or a
survival of a more costly offering. In some cases it is thought that
those who do not leave it at the well from which they have drunk will
die of thirst, and where a coin is offered it is often supposed to
disappear, being taken by the spirit of the well. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[2](#fn_648.md) The coin has clearly the nature of an
offering, and sometimes it must be of gold or silver, while the
antiquity of the custom on Celtic ground is seen by the classical
descriptions of the coins glittering in the pool of Clitumnus and of the
"gold of Toulouse" hid in sacred tanks. <span
id="fr_650"></span>[3](#fn_649.md) It is also an old and widespread belief
that all water belongs to some divine or monstrous guardian, who will
not part with any of it without a *quid pro quo*. In many cases the two
rites of rag and pin are not both used, and this may show that
originally they had the same purpose--magical or sacrificial, or perhaps
both. Other sacrifices were also made--an animal, food, or an ex voto,
the last occurring even in late survivals as at S. Thenew's Well,
Glasgow, where even in the eighteenth century tin cut to represent the
diseased member was placed on the tree, or at S. Winifred's Well in
Wales, where crutches were left.

Certain waters had the power of ejecting the demon of madness. Besides
drinking, the patient was thrown into the waters, the shock being
intended to drive the demon away, as elsewhere demons are exorcised by
flagellation or beating. The divinity of the waters aided the process,
and an offering was usually made to him. In other cases the sacred
waters were supposed to ward off disease from the district or from those

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

who drank of them. Or, again, they had the power of conferring
fertility. Women made pilgrimages to wells, drank or bathed in the
waters, implored the spirit or saint to grant them offspring, and made a
due offering. <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_650.md) Spirit or saint, by
a transfer of his power, produced fruitfulness, but the idea was in
harmony with the recognised power of water to purify, strengthen, and
heal. Women, for a similar reason, drank or washed in the waters or wore
some articles dipped in them, in order to have an easy delivery or
abundance of milk. <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_651.md)

The waters also gave oracles, their method of flowing the amount of
water in the well, the appearance or non-appearance of bubbles at the
surface when an offering was thrown in, the sinking or floating of
various articles, all indicating whether a cure was likely to occur,
whether fortune or misfortune awaited the inquirer, or, in the case of
girls, whether their lovers would be faithful. The movements of the
animal guardian of the well were also ominous to the visitor. <span
id="fr_653"></span>[3](#fn_652.md) Rivers or river divinities were also
appealed to. In cases of suspected fidelity the Celts dwelling by the
Rhine placed the newly-born child in a shield on the waters. If it
floated the mother was innocent; if it sank it was allowed to drown, and
she was put to death. <span id="fr_654"></span>[4](#fn_653.md) Girls whose
purity was suspected were similarly tested, and S. Gregory of Tours
tells how a woman accused of adultery was proved by being thrown into
the Saône. <span id="fr_655"></span>[5](#fn_654.md) The

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

mediæval witch ordeal by water is connected with this custom, which is,
however, widespread. <span id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_655.md)

The malevolent aspect of the spirit of the well is seen in the "cursing
wells" of which it was thought that when some article inscribed with an
enemy's name was thrown into them with the accompaniment of a curse, the
spirit of the well would cause his death. In some cases the curse was
inscribed on a leaden tablet thrown into the waters, just as, in other
cases, a prayer for the offerer's benefit was engraved on it. Or, again,
objects over which a charm had been said were placed in a well that the
victim who drew water might be injured. An excellent instance of a
cursing-well is that of Fynnon Elian in Denbigh, which must once have
had a guardian priestess, for in 1815 an old woman who had charge of it
presided at the ceremony. She wrote the name of the victim in a book,
receiving a gift at the same time. A pin was dropped into the well in
the name of the victim, and through it and through knowledge of his
name, the spirit of the well acted upon him to his hurt. <span

magic and religion mingle, are not purely Celtic, but it is of interest
to note their existence in Celtic lands and among Celtic folk.

Greek Nereus and the Nereids, the Slavonic Water-king, and the Japanese
god Ocean-Possessor (Ralston, *Songs of the Russian People*, 148;

well are given in Sébillot, ii. 192; Rees, 520, 623. An Irish lake no
longer healed after a hunter swam his mangy hounds through it (Joyce,
*PN* ii. 90). A similar legend occurs with the Votiaks, one of whose
sacred lakes was removed to its present position because a woman washed
dirty clothes in it (*L'Anthropologie*, xv. 107).

below the waves--the town of Is in Armorica, (Le Braz, i. p. xxxix), or
the towers under Lough Neagh. In some Welsh instances a man is the
culprit (Rhŷs, *CFL* i. 379). In the case of Lough Neagh the keeper of
the well was Liban, who lived on in the waters as a mermaid. Later she
was caught and received the baptismal name of Muirghenn, "sea-birth."
Here the myth of a water-goddess, said to have been baptized, is
attached to the legend of the careless guardian of a spring, with whom
she is identified (O'Grady, ii. 184, 265).
