### CHAPTER XX.

# THE DRUIDS.

PLINY thought that the name "Druid" was a Greek appellation derived from
the Druidic cult of the oak (δρυς). <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[1](#fn_1000.md) The word, however, is purely Celtic,
and its meaning probably implies that, like the sorcerer and
medicine-man everywhere, the Druid was regarded as "the knowing one." It
is composed of two parts--*dru*-, regarded by M. D'Arbois as an
intensive, and *vids*, from *vid*, "to know," or "see." <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[2](#fn_1001.md) Hence the Druid was "the very knowing
or wise one." It is possible, however, that *dru*- is connected with the
root which gives the word "oak" in Celtic. speech--Gaulish *deruo*,
Irish *dair*, Welsh *derw*--and that the oak, occupying a place in the
cult, was thus brought into relation with the name of the priesthood.
The Gaulish form of the name was probably *druis*, the Old Irish was
*drai*. The modern forms in Irish and Scots Gaelic, *drui* and *draoi*,
mean "sorcerer."

M. D'Arbois and others, accepting Cæsar's dictum that "the system (of
Druidism) is thought to have been devised in Britain, and brought thence
into Gaul," maintain that the Druids were priests of the Goidels in
Britain, who imposed themselves upon the Gaulish conquerors of the
Goidels, and that Druidism then passed over into Gaul about 200
B.C. <span id="fr_1004"></span>[3](#fn_1002.md) But it is hardly

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

likely that, even if the Druids were accepted as priests by conquering
Gauls in Britain, they should have affected the Gauls of Gaul who were
outside the reflex influence of the conquered Goidels, and should have
there obtained that power which they possessed. Goidels and Gauls were
allied by race and language and religion, and it would be strange if
they did not both possess a similar priesthood. Moreover, the Goidels
had been a continental people, and Druidism was presumably flourishing
among them then. Why did it not influence kindred Celtic tribes without
Druids, *ex hypothesi*, at that time? Further, if we accept Professor
Meyer's theory that no Goidel set foot in Britain until the second
century A.D., the Gauls could not have received the Druidic priesthood
from the Goidels.

Cæsar merely says, "it is thought (*existimatur*) that Druidism came to
Gaul from Britain." <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_1003.md) It was a
pious opinion, perhaps his own, or one based on the fact that those who
wished to perfect themselves in Druidic art went to Britain. This may
have been because Britain had been less open to foreign influences than
Gaul, and its Druids, unaffected by these, were thought to be more
powerful than those of Gaul. Pliny, on the other hand, seems to think
that Druidism passed over into Britain from Gaul. <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1004.md)

Other writers--Sir John Rhŷs, Sir G. L. Gomme, and M. Reinach-support on
different grounds the theory that the Druids were a pre-Celtic
priesthood, accepted by the Celtic conquerors. Sir John Rhŷs thinks that
the Druidism of the aborigines of Gaul and Britain made terms with the
Celtic conquerors. It was accepted by the Goidels, but not by the
Brythons. Hence in Britain there were Brythons without Druids,
aborigines under the sway of Druidism, and Goidels who combined Aryan
polytheism with Druidism. Druidism

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

was also the religion of the aborigines from the Baltic to Gibraltar,
and was accepted by the Gauls. <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1005.md)
But if so, it is difficult to see why the Brythons, akin to them, did
not accept it. Our knowledge of Brythonic religion is too scanty for us
to prove that the Druids had or had not sway over them, but the
presumption is that they had. Nor is there any historical evidence to
show that the Druids were originally a non-Celtic priesthood. Everywhere
they appear as the supreme and dominant priesthood of the Celts, and the
priests of a conquered people could hardly have obtained such power over
the conquerors. The relation of the Celts to the Druids is quite
different from that of conquerors, who occasionally resort to the
medicine-men of the conquered folk because they have stronger magic or
greater influence with the autochthonous gods. The Celts did not resort
to the Druids occasionally; *ex hypothesi* they accepted them
completely, were dominated by them in every department of life, while
their own priests, if they had any, accepted this order of things
without a murmur. All this is incredible. The picture drawn by Cæsar,
Strabo, and others of the Druids and their position among the Celts as
judges, choosers of tribal chiefs and kings, teachers, as well as
ministers of religion, suggests rather that they were a native Celtic
priesthood, long established among the people.

Sir G. L. Gomme supports the theory that the Druids were a pre-Celtic
priesthood, because, in his opinion, much of their belief in magic as
well as their use of human sacrifice and the redemption of one life by
another, is opposed to "Aryan sentiment." Equally opposed to this are
their functions of settling controversies, judging, settling the
succession to property, and arranging boundaries. These views are
supported by a comparison of the position of the Druids relatively to
the Celts

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

with that of non-Aryan persons in India who render occasional priestly
services to Hindu village communities. <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md) Whether this comparison of occasional
Hindu custom with Celtic usage two thousand years ago is just, may be
questioned. As already seen, it was no mere occasional service which the
Druids rendered to the Celts, and it is this which makes it difficult to
credit this theory. Had the Celtic house-father been priest and judge in
his own clan, would he so readily have surrendered his rights to a
foreign and conquered priesthood? On the other hand, kings and chiefs
among the Celts probably retained some priestly functions, derived from
the time when the offices of the priest-king had not been
differentiated. Cæsar's evidence certainly does not support the idea
that "it is only among the rudest of the so-called Celtic tribes that we
find this superimposing of an apparently official priesthood." According
to him, the power of the Druids was universal in Gaul, and had their
position really corresponded to that of the pariah priests of India,
occasional priests of Hindu villages, the determined hostility of the
Roman power to them because they wielded such an enormous influence over
Celtic thought and life, is inexplainable. If, further, Aryan sentiment
was so opposed to Druidic customs, why did Aryan Celts so readily accept
the Druids? In this case the receiver is as bad as the thief. Sir G. L.
Gomme clings to the belief that the Aryans were people of a
comparatively high civilisation, who had discarded, if they ever
possessed, a savage "past." But old beliefs and customs still survive
through growing civilisation, and if the views of Professor Sergi and
others are correct, the Aryans were even less civilised than the peoples
whom they conquered. <span id="fr_1009"></span>[2](#fn_1007.md)
Shape-shifting, magic, human sacrifice, priestly domination, were as
much Aryan as non-Aryan, and if the

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Celts had a comparatively pure religion, why did
they so soon allow it to be defiled by the puerile superstitions of the
Druids?

M. Reinach, as we have seen, thinks that the Celts had no images,
because these were prohibited by their priests. This prohibition was
pre-Celtic in Gaul, since there are no Neolithic images, though there
are great megalithic structures, suggesting the existence of a great
religious aristocracy. This aristocracy imposed itself on the
Celts. <span id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1008.md) We have seen that there
is no reason for believing that the Celts had no images, hence this
argument is valueless. M. Reinach then argues that the Celts accepted
Druidism *en bloc*, as the Romans accepted Oriental cults and the Greeks
the native Pelasgic cults. But neither Romans nor Greeks abandoned their
own faith. Were the Celts a people without priests and without religion?
We know that they must have accepted many local cults, but that they
adopted the whole aboriginal faith and its priests *en bloc* is not
credible. M. Reinach also holds that when the Celts appear in history
Druidism was in its decline; the Celt, or at least the military caste
among the Celts, was reasserting itself. But the Druids do not appear as
a declining body in the pages of Cæsar, and their power was still
supreme, to judge by the hostility of the Roman Government to them. If
the military caste rebelled against them, this does not prove that they
were a foreign body. Such a strife is seen wherever priest and soldier
form separate castes, each desiring to rule, as in Egypt.

Other writers argue that we do not find Druids existing in the Danube
region, in Cisalpine territory, nor in Transalpine Gaul, "outside the
limits of the region occupied by the Celtæ." <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[2](#fn_1009.md) This could only have weight if any of
the classical

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

writers had composed a formal treatise on the Druids, showing exactly
the regions where they existed. They merely describe Druidism as a
general Celtic institution, or as they knew it in Gaul or Britain, and
few of them have any personal knowledge of it. There is no reason to
believe that Druids did not exist wherever there were Celts. The Druids
and Semnotheoi of the Celts and Galatæ, referred to c. 200 B.C. were
apparently priests of other Celts than those of Gaul, and Celtic groups
of Cisalpine Gaul had priests, though these are not formally styled
Druids. <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1](#fn_1010.md) The argument *ex
silentio* is here of little value, since the references to the Druids
are so brief, and it tells equally against their non-Celtic origin,
since we do not hear of Druids in Aquitania, a non-Celtic region. <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[2](#fn_1011.md)

The theory of the non-Celtic origin of the Druids assumes that the Celts
had no priests, or that these were effaced by the Druids. The Celts had
priests called *gutuatri* attached to certain temples, their name
perhaps meaning "the speakers," those who spoke to the gods. <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[3](#fn_1012.md) The functions of the Druids were much
more general, according to this theory, hence M. D'Arbois supposes that,
before their intrusion, the Celts had no other priests than the
*gutuatri*. <span id="fr_1015"></span>[4](#fn_1013.md) But the probability
is that they were a Druidic class, ministers of local sanctuaries, and
related to the Druids as the Levites were to the priests of Israel,
since the Druids were a composite priesthood with a variety of
functions. If the priests and servants of Belenos, described by Ausonius
and called by him *ædituus Beleni*, were *gutuatri*, then the latter
must have been connected with the

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Druids, since he says they were of Druidic
stock. <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1014.md) Lucan's "priest of the
grove" may have been a *gutuatros*, and the priests (*sacerdotes*) and
other ministers (*antistites*) of the Boii may have been Druids properly
so called and *gutuatri*. <span id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1015.md)
Another class of temple servants may have existed. Names beginning with
the name of a god and ending in *gnatos*, "accustomed to," "beloved of,"
occur in inscriptions, and may denote persons consecrated from their
youth to the service of a grove or temple. On the other hand, the names
may mean no more than that those bearing them were devoted to the cult
of one particular god.

Our supposition that the *gutuatri* were a class of Druids is supported
by classical evidence, which tends to show that the Druids were a great
inclusive priesthood with different classes possessing different
functions--priestly, prophetic, magical, medical, legal, and poetical.
Cæsar attributes these to the Druids as a whole, but in other writers
they are in part at least in the hands of different classes. Diodorus
refers to the Celtic philosophers and theologians (Druids), diviners,
and bards, as do also Strabo and Timagenes, Strabo giving the Greek form
of the native name for the diviners, οὐάτεις, the Celtic form being
probably *vâtis* (Irish, *fáith*). <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[3](#fn_1016.md) These may have been also poets, since
*vâtis* means both singer and poet; but in all three writers the bards
are a fairly distinct class, who sing the deeds of famous men (so
Timagenes). Druid and diviner were also closely connected, since the
Druids studied nature and moral philosophy, and the diviners were also
students of nature, according to Strabo and Timagenes. No sacrifice was
complete without a Druid, say Diodorus and Strabo, but both speak of the
diviners as concerned with sacrifice. Druids also prophesied as well as
diviners, according

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

to Cicero and Tacitus. <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1](#fn_1017.md) Finally,
Lucan mentions only Druids and bards. <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[2](#fn_1018.md) Diviners were thus probably a Druidic
sub-class, standing midway between the Druids proper and the bards, and
partaking of some of the functions of both. Pliny speaks of "Druids and
this race of prophets and doctors," <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[3](#fn_1019.md) and this suggests that some were
priests, some diviners, while some practised an empiric medical science.

On the whole this agrees with what is met with in Ireland, where the
Druids, though appearing in the texts mainly as magicians, were also
priests and teachers. Side by side with them were the *Filid*, "learned
poets," <span id="fr_1022"></span>[4](#fn_1020.md) composing according to
strict rules of art, and higher than the third class, the Bards. The
*Filid*, who may also have been known as *Fáthi*, "prophets," <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[5](#fn_1021.md) were also diviners according to strict
rules of augury, while some of these auguries implied a sacrifice. The
Druids were also diviners and prophets. When the Druids were overthrown
at the coming of Christianity, the *Filid* remained as a learned class,
probably because they had abandoned all pagan practices, while the Bards
were reduced to a comparatively low status. M. D'Arbois supposes that
there was rivalry between the Druids and the *Filid*, who made common
cause with the Christian missionaries, but this is not supported by
evidence. The three classes in Gaul--Druids, *Vates*, and Bards--thus
correspond to the three classes in Ireland--Druids, *Fáthi* or *Filid*,
and Bards. <span id="fr_1024"></span>[6](#fn_1022.md)

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

We may thus conclude that the Druids were a purely Celtic priesthood,
belonging both to the Goidelic and Gaulish branches of the Celts. The
idea that they were not Celtic is sometimes connected with the
supposition that Druidism was something superadded to Celtic religion
from without, or that Celtic polytheism was not part of the creed of the
Druids, but sanctioned by them, while they had a definite theological
system with only a few gods. <span id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1023.md)
These are the ideas of writers who see in the Druids an occult and
esoteric priesthood. The Druids had grown up *pari passu* with the
growth of the native religion and magic. Where they had become more
civilised, as in the south of Gaul, they may have given up many magical
practices, but as a class they were addicted to magic, and must have
taken part in local cults as well as in those of the greater gods. That
they were a philosophic priesthood advocating a pure religion among
polytheists is a baseless theory. Druidism was not a formal system
outside Celtic religion. It covered the whole ground of Celtic religion;
in other words, it was that religion itself.

The Druids are first referred to by pseudo-Aristotle and Sotion in the
second century B.C., the reference being preserved by Diogenes Laertius:
"There are among the Celtæ and Galatæ those called Druids and
Semnotheoi." <span id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1024.md) The two words may
be synonymous, or they may describe two classes of priests, or, again,
the Druids may have been Celtic, and the Semnotheoi Galatic (? Galatian)
priests. Cæsar's account comes next in time. Later writers gives the
Druids a lofty place and speak vaguely of the Druidic philosophy and
science. Cæsar also refers to their science, but both he and Strabo

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

speak of their human sacrifices. Suetonius describes their religion as
cruel and savage, and Mela, who speaks of their learning, regards their
human sacrifices as savagery. <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1](#fn_1025.md)
Pliny says nothing of the Druids as philosophers, but hints at their
priestly functions, and connects them with magico-medical rites. <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[2](#fn_1026.md) These divergent opinions are difficult
to account for. But as the Romans gained closer acquaintance with the
Druids, they found less philosophy and more superstition among them. For
their cruel rites and hostility to Rome, they sought to suppress them,
but this they never would have done had the Druids been esoteric
philosophers. It has been thought that Pliny's phrase, "Druids and that
race of prophets and doctors," signifies that, through Roman
persecution, the Druids were reduced to a kind of medicine-men. <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[3](#fn_1027.md) But the phrase rather describes the
varied functions of the Druids, as has been seen, nor does it refer to
the state to which the repressive edict reduced them, but to that in
which it found them. Pliny's information was also limited.

The vague idea that the Druids were philosophers was repeated
parrot-like by writer after writer, who regarded barbaric races as
Rousseau and his school looked upon the "noble savage." Roman writers,
sceptical of a future life, were fascinated by the idea of a barbaric
priesthood teaching the doctrine of immortality in the wilds of Gaul.
For this teaching the poet Lucan sang their praises. The Druids probably
first impressed Greek and Latin observers by their magic, their
organisation, and the fact that, like many barbaric priesthoods, but
unlike those of Greece and Rome, they taught certain doctrines. Their
knowledge was divinely conveyed to them; "they speak the language of the
gods;" <span id="fr_1030"></span>[4](#fn_1028.md) hence it was easy to read
anything into this teaching. Thus the Druidic legend

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

rapidly grew. On the other hand, modern writers have perhaps exaggerated
the force of the classical evidence. When we read of Druidic
associations we need not regard these as higher than the organised
priesthoods of barbarians. Their doctrine of metempsychosis, if it was
really taught, involved no ethical content as in Pythagoreanism. Their
astronomy was probably astrological <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1029.md); their knowledge of nature a series of
cosmogonic myths and speculations. If a true Druidic philosophy and
science had existed, it is strange that it is always mentioned vaguely
and that it exerted no influence upon the thought of the time.

Classical sentiment also found a connection between the Druidic and
Pythagorean systems, the Druids being regarded as conforming to the
doctrines and rules of the Greek philosopher. <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[2](#fn_1030.md) It is not improbable that some
Pythagorean doctrines may have reached Gaul, but when we examine the
point at which the two systems were supposed to meet, namely, the
doctrine of metempsychosis and immortality, upon which the whole idea of
this relationship was founded, there is no real resemblance. There are
Celtic myths regarding the rebirth of gods and heroes, but the
eschatological teaching was apparently this, that the soul was clothed
with a body in the other-world. There was no doctrine of a series of
rebirths on this earth as a punishment for sin. The Druidic teaching of
a bodily immortality was mistakenly assumed to be the same as the
Pythagorean doctrine of the soul reincarnated in body after body. Other
points of resemblance were then discovered. The organisation of the
Druids was assumed by Ammianus to be a kind of corporate
life--*sodaliciis adstricti consortiis*--while the Druidic mind was
always searching into lofty things, <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[3](#fn_1031.md) but

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

those who wrote most fully of the Druids knew nothing of this.

The Druids, like the priests of all religions, doubtless sought after
such knowledge as was open to them, but this does not imply that they
possessed a recondite philosophy or a secret theology. They were
governed by the ideas current among all barbaric communities, and they
were at once priests, magicians, doctors, and teachers. They would not
allow their sacred hymns to be written down, but taught them in
secret, <span id="fr_1034"></span>[1](#fn_1032.md) as is usual wherever the
success of hymn or prayer depends upon the right use of the words and
the secrecy observed in imparting them to others. Their ritual, as far
as is known to us, differs but little from that of other barbarian folk,
and it included human sacrifice and divination with the victim's body.
They excluded the guilty from a share in the cult--the usual punishment
meted out to the tabu-breaker in all primitive societies.

The idea that -the Druids taught a secret doctrine--monotheism,
pantheism, or the like--is unsupported by evidence. Doubtless they
communicated secrets to the initiated, as is done in barbaric mysteries
everywhere, but these secrets consist of magic and mythic formulæ, the
exhibition of *Sacra*, and some teaching about the gods or about moral
duties. These are kept secret, not because they are abstract doctrines,
but because they would lose their value and because the gods would be
angry if they were made too common. If the Druids taught religious and
moral matters secretly, these were probably no more than an extension of
the threefold maxim inculcated by them according to Diogenes Laertius:
"To worship the gods, to do no evil, and to exercise courage." <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[2](#fn_1033.md)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

\[paragraph continues\] To this would be added cosmogonic myths and
speculations, and magic and religious formulæ. This will become more
evident as we examine the position and power of the Druids.

In Gaul, and to some extent in Ireland, the Druids formed a priestly
corporation--a fact which helped classical observers to suppose that
they lived together like the Pythagorean communities. While the words of
Ammianus--*sodaliciis adstricti consortiis*--may imply no more than some
kind of priestly organisation, M. Bertrand founds on them a theory that
the Druids were a kind of monks living a community life, and that Irish
monasticism was a transformation of this system. <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[1](#fn_1034.md) This is purely imaginative. Irish
Druids had wives and children, and the Druid Diviciacus was a family
man, while Cæsar says not a word of community life among the Druids. The
hostility of Christianity to the Druids would have prevented any copying
of their system, and Irish monasticism was modelled on that of the
Continent. Druidic organisation probably denoted no more than that the
Druids were bound by certain ties, that they were graded in different
ranks or according to their functions, and that they practised a series
of common cults. In Gaul one chief Druid had authority over the others,
the position being an elective one. <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[2](#fn_1035.md) The insular Druids may have been
similarly organised, since we hear of a chief Druid, *primus magus*,
while the *Filid* had an *Ard-file*, or chief, elected to his
office. <span id="fr_1038"></span>[3](#fn_1036.md) The priesthood was not a
caste, but was open to those who showed aptitude for it. There was a
long novitiate, extending even to twenty years, just as, in Ireland, the
novitiate of the *File* lasted from seven to twelve years. <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[4](#fn_1037.md)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

The Druids of Gaul assembled annually in a central spot, and there
settled disputes, because they were regarded as the most just of
men. <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1](#fn_1038.md) Individual Druids also
decided disputes or sat as judges in cases of murder. How far it was
obligatory to bring causes before them is unknown, but those who did not
submit to a decision were interdicted from the sacrifices, and all
shunned them. In other words, they were tabued. A magico-religious
sanction thus enforced the judgments of the Druids. In Galatia the
twelve tetrarchs had a council of three hundred men, and met in a place
called Drunemeton to try cases of murder. <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[2](#fn_1039.md) Whether it is philologically
permissible to connect *Dru*- with the corresponding syllable in "Druid"
or not, the likeness to the Gaulish assembly at a "consecrated place,"
perhaps a grove (*nemeton*), is obvious. We do not know that Irish
Druids were judges, but the *Filid* exercised judgments, and this may be
a relic of their connection with the Druids. <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[3](#fn_1040.md)

Diodorus describes the Druids exhorting combatants to peace, and taming
them like wild beasts by enchantment. <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[4](#fn_1041.md) This suggests interference to prevent
the devastating power of the blood-feud or of tribal wars. They also
appear to have exercised authority in the election of rulers.
Convictolitanis was elected to the magistracy by the priests in Gaul,
"according to the custom of the State." <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[5](#fn_1042.md) In Ireland, after partaking of the
flesh of a white bull, probably a sacrificial animal, a man lay down to
sleep, while four Druids chanted over him "to render his witness
truthful." He then saw in a vision the person who should be elected
king, and what he was doing at the moment. <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[6](#fn_1043.md) Possibly the

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Druids used hypnotic suggestion; the medium was
apparently clairvoyant.

Dio Chrysostom alleges that kings were ministers of the Druids, and
could do nothing without them. <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1](#fn_1044.md)
This agrees on the whole with the witness of Irish texts. Druids always
accompany the king, and have great influence over him. According to a
passage in the *Táin*, "the men of Ulster must not speak before the
king, the king must not speak before his Druid," and even Conchobar was
silent until the Druid Cathbad had spoken. <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[2](#fn_1045.md) This power, resembling that of many
other priesthoods, must have helped to balance that of the warrior
class, and it is the more credible when we recall the fact that the
Druids claimed to have made the universe. <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[3](#fn_1046.md) The priest-kingship may have been an
old Celtic institution, and this would explain why, once the offices
were separated, priests had or claimed so much political power.

That political power must have been enhanced by their position as
teachers, and it is safe to say that submission to their powers was
inculcated by them. Both in Gaul and in Ireland they taught others than
those who intended to become Druids. <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[4](#fn_1047.md) As has been seen, their teachings were
not written down, but transmitted orally. They taught immortality,
believing that thus men would be roused to valour, buttressing
patriotism with dogma. They also imparted "many things regarding the
stars and their motions, the extent of the universe and the earth, the
nature of things, and the power and might of the immortal gods." Strabo
also speaks of their teaching in moral science. <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[5](#fn_1048.md) As

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

has been seen, it is easy to exaggerate all this. Their astronomy was
probably of a humble kind and mingled with astrology; their natural
philosophy a mass of cosmogonic myths and speculations; their theology
was rather mythology; their moral philosophy a series of maxims such as
are found in all barbaric communities. Their medical lore, to judge from
what Pliny says, was largely magical. Some Druids, *e.g.* in the south
of Gaul, may have had access to classical learning, and Cæsar speaks of
the use of Greek characters among them. This could hardly have been
general, and in any case must have superseded the use of a native
script, to which the use of ogams in Ireland, and perhaps also in Gaul,
was supplementary. The Irish Druids may have had written books, for King
Loegaire desired that S. Patrick's books and those of the Druids should
be submitted to the ordeal by water as a test of their owners'
claims. <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1](#fn_1049.md)

In religious affairs the Druids were supreme, since they alone "knew the
gods and divinities of heaven." <span id="fr_1052"></span>[2](#fn_1050.md)
They superintended and arranged all rites and attended to "public and
private sacrifices," and " no sacrifice was complete without the
intervention of a Druid." <span id="fr_1053"></span>[3](#fn_1051.md) The
dark and cruel rites of the Druids struck the Romans with horror, and
they form a curious contrast to their alleged "philosophy." They used
divination and had regular formulæ of incantation as well as ritual acts
by which they looked into the future. <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[4](#fn_1052.md) Before all matters of importance,
especially before warlike expeditions, their advice was sought because
they could scan the future.

Name-giving and a species of baptism were performed by the Druids or on
their initiative. Many examples of this

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

occur in Irish texts, thus of Conall Cernach it is said, "Druids came to
baptize the child into heathenism, and they sang the heathen baptism
(*baithis geintlídhe*) over the little child," and of Ailill that he was
"baptized in Druidic streams." <span id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1053.md)
In Welsh story we read that Gwri was "baptized with the baptism which
was usual at that time." <span id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1054.md) Similar
illustrations are common at name-giving among many races, <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1055.md) and it is probable that the custom in
the Hebrides of the midwife dropping three drops of water on the child
*in Nomine* and giving it a temporary name, is a survival of this
practice. The regular baptism takes place later, but this preliminary
rite keeps off fairies and ensures burial in consecrated ground, just as
the pagan rite was protective and admitted to the tribal
privileges. <span id="fr_1058"></span>[4](#fn_1056.md)

In the burial rites, which in Ireland consisted of a lament, sacrifices,
and raising a stone inscribed with ogams over the grave, Druids took
part. The Druid Dergdamsa pronounced a discourse over the Ossianic hero
Mag-neid, buried him with his arms, and chanted a rune. The ogam
inscription would also be of Druidic composition, and as no sacrifice
was complete without the intervention of Druids, they must also have
assisted at the lavish sacrifices which occurred at Celtic funerals.

Pliny's words, "the Druids and that race of prophets and doctors,"
suggest that the medical art may have been in the hands of a special
class of Druids, though all may have had a smattering of it. It was
mainly concerned with the use of herbs, and was mixed up with magical
rites, which may have

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

been regarded as of more importance than the actual medicines
used. <span id="fr_1059"></span>[1](#fn_1057.md) In Ireland Druids also
practised the healing art. Thus when Cúchulainn was ill, Emer said, "If
it had been Fergus, Cúchulainn would have taken no rest till he had
found a Druid able to discover the cause of that illness." <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[2](#fn_1058.md) But other persons, not referred to as
Druids, are mentioned as healers, one of them a woman, perhaps a
reminiscence of the time when the art was practised by women. <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[3](#fn_1059.md) These healers may, however, have been
attached to the Druidic corporation in much the same way as were the
bards.

Still more important were the magical powers of the Druids--giving or
withholding sunshine or rain, causing storms, making women and cattle
fruitful, using spells, rhyming to death, exercising shape-shifting and
invisibility, and producing a magic sleep, possibly hypnotic. They were
also in request as poisoners. <span id="fr_1062"></span>[4](#fn_1060.md)
Since the Gauls went to Britain to perfect themselves in Druidic
science, it is possible that the insular Druids were more devoted to
magic than those of Gaul, but since the latter are said to have "tamed
the people as wild beasts are tamed," it is obvious that this refers to
their powers as magicians rather than to any recondite philosophy
possessed by them. Yet they were clear-sighted enough to use every means
by which they might gain political power, and some of them may have been
open to the influence of classical learning even before the Roman
invasion. In the next chapter the magic of the Druids will be described
in detail.

The Druids, both in Gaul (at the mistletoe rite) and in Ireland, were
dressed in white, but Strabo speaks of their scarlet and gold
embroidered robes, their golden necklets and bracelets. <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[5](#fn_1061.md) Again, the chief Druid of the king of
Erin wore

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

a coloured cloak and had earrings of gold, and in another instance a
Druid wears a bull's hide and a white-speckled bird headpiece with
fluttering wings. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[1](#fn_1062.md) There was also
some special tonsure used by the Druids, <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[2](#fn_1063.md) which may have denoted servitude to
the gods, as it was customary for a warrior to vow his hair to a
divinity if victory was granted him. Similarly the Druid's hair would be
presented to the gods, and the tonsure would mark their minister.

Some writers have tried to draw a distinction between the Druids of Gaul
and of Ireland, especially in the matter of their priestly
functions. <span id="fr_1066"></span>[3](#fn_1064.md) But, while a few
passages in Irish texts do suggest that the Irish Druids were priests
taking part in sacrifices, etc., nearly all passages relating to cult or
ritual seem to have been deliberately suppressed. Hence the Druids
appear rather as magicians--a natural result, since, once the people
became Christian, the priestly character of the Druids would tend to be
lost sight of. Like the Druids of Gaul, they were teachers and took part
in political affairs, and this shows that they were more than mere
magicians. In Irish texts the word "Druid" is somewhat loosely used and
is applied to kings and poets, perhaps because they had been pupils of
the Druids. But it is impossible to doubt that the Druids in Ireland
fulfilled functions of a public priesthood. They appear in connection
with all the colonies which came to Erin, the annalists regarding the
priests or medicine-men of different races as Druids, through lack of
historic perspective. But one fact shows that they were priests of the
Celtic religion in Ireland. The euhemerised Tuatha Dé Danann are masters
of Druidic

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

lore. Thus both the gods and the priests who served them were confused
by later writers. The opposition of Christian missionaries to the Druids
shows that they were priests; if they were not, it remains to be
discovered what body of men did exercise priestly functions in pagan
Ireland. In Ireland their judicial functions may have been less
important than in Gaul, and they may not have been so strictly
organised; but here we are in the region of conjecture. They were exempt
from military service in Gaul, and many joined their ranks on this
account, but in Ireland they were "bonny fechters," just as in Gaul they
occasionally fought like mediæval bishops. <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1065.md) In both countries they were present on
the field of battle to perform the necessary religious or magical rites.

Since the Druids were an organised priesthood, with powers of teaching
and of magic implicitly believed in by the folk, possessing the key of
the other-world, and dominating the whole field of religion, it is easy
to see how much veneration must have been paid them. Connoting this with
the influence of the Roman Church in Celtic regions and the power of the
Protestant minister in the Highlands and in Wales, some have thought
that there is an innate tendency in the Celt to be priest-ridden. If
this be true, we can only say, "the people wish to have it so, and the
priests--pagan, papist, or protestant--bear rule through their means!"

Thus a close examination of the position and functions of the Druids
explains away two popular misconceptions. They were not possessed of any
recondite and esoteric wisdom. And the culling of mistletoe instead of
being the most important, was but a subordinate part of their functions.

In Gaul the Roman power broke the sway of the Druids, aided perhaps by
the spread of Christianity, but it was Christianity alone which routed
them in Ireland and in Britain

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

outside the Roman pale. The Druidic organisation, their power in
politics and in the administration of justice, their patriotism, and
also their use of human sacrifice and magic, were all obnoxious to the
Roman Government, which opposed them mainly on political grounds. Magic
and human sacrifice were suppressed because they were contrary to Roman
manners. The first attack was in the reign of Augustus, who prohibited
Roman citizens from taking part in the religion of the Druids. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[1](#fn_1066.md) Tiberius next interdicted the Druids,
but this was probably aimed at their human sacrifices, for the Druids
were not suppressed, since they existed still in the reign of Claudius,
who is said to have abolished *Druidarum religionem dirae
immanitatis*. <span id="fr_1069"></span>[2](#fn_1067.md) The earlier
legislation was ineffective; that of Claudius was more thorough, but it,
too, was probably aimed mainly at human sacrifice and magic, since
Aurelius Victor limits it to the "notorious superstitions" of the
Druids. <span id="fr_1070"></span>[3](#fn_1068.md) It did not abolish the
native religion, as is proved by the numerous inscriptions to Celtic
gods, and by the fact that, as Mela informs us, human victims were still
offered symbolically, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[4](#fn_1069.md) while the
Druids were still active some years later. A parallel is found in the
British abolition of Sāti in India, while permitting the native religion
to flourish.

Probably more effective was the policy begun by Augustus. Magistrates
were inaugurated and acted as judges, thus ousting the Druids, and
native deities and native ritual were assimilated to those of Rome.
Celtic religion was Romanised, and if the Druids retained priestly
functions, it could only be by their becoming Romanised also. Perhaps
the new State religion in Gaul simply ignored them. The annual assembly
of deputies at Lugudunum round the altar of Rome and

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Augustus had a religious character, and was
intended to rival and to supersede the annual gathering of the
Druids. <span id="fr_1072"></span>[1](#fn_1070.md) The deputies elected a
flamen of the province who had surveillance of the cult, and there were
also flamens for each city. Thus the power of the Druids in politics,
law, and religion was quietly undermined, while Rome also struck a blow
at their position as teachers by establishing schools throughout
Gaul. <span id="fr_1073"></span>[2](#fn_1071.md)

M. D'Arbois maintains that, as a result of persecution, the Druids
retired to the depths of the forests, and continued to teach there in
secret those who despised the new learning of Rome, basing his opinion
on passages of Lucan and Mela, both writing a little after the
promulgation of the laws. <span id="fr_1074"></span>[3](#fn_1072.md) But
neither Lucan nor Mela refer to an existing state of things, and do not
intend their readers to suppose that the Druids fled to woods and
caverns. Lucan speaks of them dwelling in woods, *i.e.* their sacred
groves, and resuming their rites after Cæsar's conquest not after the
later edicts, and he does not speak of the Druids teaching there. <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[4](#fn_1073.md) Mela seems to be echoing Cæsar's
account of the twenty years' novitiate, but adds to it that the teaching
was given in secret confusing it, however, with that given to others
than candidates for the priesthood. Thus he says: "Docent multa
nobilissimos gentis clam et diu vicenis annis aut in specu aut in
abditis saltibus," <span id="fr_1076"></span>[5](#fn_1074.md) but there is
not the slightest evidence that this secrecy was the result of the
edicts. Moreover, the attenuated sacrificial rites which he describes
were evidently practised

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

quite openly. Probably some Druids continued their teaching in their
secret and sacred haunts, but it is unlikely that noble Gauls would
resort to them when Greco-Roman culture was now open to them in the
schools, where they are found receiving instruction in 21 A.D. <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[1](#fn_1075.md) Most of the Druids probably succumbed
to the new order of things. Some continued the old rites in a modified
manner as long as they could obtain worshippers. Others, more fanatical,
would suffer from the law when they could not evade its grasp. Some of
these revolted against Rome after Nero's death, and it was perhaps to
this class that those Druids belonged who prophesied the world-empire of
the Celts in 70 A.D. <span id="fr_1078"></span>[2](#fn_1076.md) The fact
that Druids existed at this date shows that the proscription had not
been complete. But the complete Romanising of Gaul took away their
occupation, though even in the fourth century men still boasted of their
Druidic descent. <span id="fr_1079"></span>[3](#fn_1077.md)

The insular Druids opposed the legions in Southern Britain, and in Mona
in 62 A.D. they made a last stand with the warriors against the Romans,
gesticulating and praying to the gods. But with the establishment of
Roman power in Britain their fate must have resembled that of the Druids
of Gaul. A recrudescence of Druidism is found, however, in the presence
of magi (Druids) with Vortigern after the Roman withdrawal. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[4](#fn_1078.md) Outside the Roman pale the Druids were
still rampant and practised their rites as before, according to
Pliny. <span id="fr_1081"></span>[5](#fn_1079.md) Much later, in the sixth
century, they opposed Christian missionaries in Scotland, just as in
Ireland they opposed S. Patrick and his monks, who combated "the
hardhearted Druids." Finally, Christianity was victorious and the

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

powers of the Druids passed in large measure to the Christian clergy or
remained to some extent with the *Filid*. <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[1](#fn_1080.md) In popular belief the clerics had
prevailed less by the persuasive power of the gospel, than by
successfully rivalling the magic of the Druids.

Classical writers speak of *Dryades* or "Druidesses" in the third
century. One of them predicted his approaching death to Alexander
Severus, another promised the empire to Diocletian, others were
consulted by Aurelian. <span id="fr_1083"></span>[2](#fn_1081.md) Thus they
were divineresses, rather than priestesses, and their name may be the
result of misconception, unless they assumed it when Druids no longer
existed as a class. In Ireland there were divineresses--*ban-filid* or
*ban-fáthi*, probably a distinct class with prophetic powers. Kings are
warned against "pythonesses" as well as Druids, and Dr. Joyce thinks
these were Druidesses. <span id="fr_1084"></span>[3](#fn_1082.md) S.
Patrick also armed himself against "the spells of women" and of
Druids. <span id="fr_1085"></span>[4](#fn_1083.md) Women in Ireland had a
knowledge of futurity, according to Solinus, and the women who took part
with the Druids like furies at Mona, may have been divineresses. <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[5](#fn_1084.md) In Ireland it is possible that such
women were called "Druidesses," since the word *ban-drui* is met with,
the women so called being also styled *ban-fili*, while the fact that
they belonged to the class of the *Filid* brings them into connection
with the Druids. <span id="fr_1087"></span>[6](#fn_1085.md) But *ban-drui*
may have been applied to women with priestly functions, such as
certainly existed in Ireland--*e.g.* the virgin guardians of

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

sacred fires, to whose functions Christian nuns succeeded. <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[1](#fn_1086.md) We know also that the British queen
Boudicca exercised priestly functions, and such priestesses, apart from
the Dryades, existed among the continental Celts. Inscriptions at Arles
speak of an *antistita deae*, and at Le Prugnon of a *flaminica
sacerdos* of the goddess Thucolis. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[2](#fn_1087.md) These were servants of a goddess like
the priestess of the Celtic Artemis in Galatia, in whose family the
priesthood was hereditary. <span id="fr_1090"></span>[3](#fn_1088.md) The
virgins called Gallizenæ, who practised divinition and magic in the isle
of Sena, were priestesses of a Gaulish god, and some of the women who
were "possessed by Dionysus" and practised an orgiastic cult on an
island in the Loire, were probably of the same kind. <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[4](#fn_1089.md) They were priestesses of some
magico-religious cult practised by women, like the guardians of the
sacred fire in Ireland, which was tabu to men. M. Reinach regards the
accounts of these island priestesses as fictions based on the story of
Circe's isle, but even if they are garbled, they seem to be based on
actual observation and are paralleled from other regions. <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[5](#fn_1090.md)

The existence of such priestesses and divineresses over the Celtic area
is to be explained by our hypothesis that many Celtic divinities were at
first female and served by women, who were possessed of the tribal lore.
Later, men assumed their functions, and hence arose the great
priesthoods, but conservatism sporadically retained such female cults
and priestesses, some goddesses being still served by women--the
Galatian Artemis, or the goddesses of Gaul, with their female

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

servants. Time also brought its revenges, for when paganism passed away,
much of its folk-ritual and magic remained, practised by wise women or
witches, who for generations had as much power over ignorant minds as
the Christian priesthood. The fact that Cæsar and Tacitus speak of
Germanic but not of Celtic priestesses, can hardly, in face of these
scattered notices, be taken as a proof that women had no priestly *rôle*
in Celtic religion. If they had not, that religion would be unique in
the world's history.

practised the old rites in secret. The late word *derwydd* was probably
