### CHAPTER XIV.

# ANIMAL WORSHIP.

ANIMAL worship pure and simple had declined among the Celts of historic
times, and animals were now regarded mainly as symbols or attributes of
divinities. The older cult had been connected with the pastoral stage in
which the animals were divine, or with the agricultural stage in which
they represented the corn-spirit, and perhaps with totemism. We shall
study here (1) traces of the older animal cults; (2) the transformation
of animal gods into symbols; and (3) traces of totemism.

### 1.

The presence of a bull with three cranes (Tarvos Trigaranos) on the
Paris altar, along with the gods Esus, Juppiter, and Vulcan, suggests
that it was a divine animal, or the subject of a divine myth. As has
been seen, this bull may be the bull of the *Táin bó Cuailgne*. Both it
and its opponent were reincarnations of the swine-herds of two gods. In
the Irish sagas reincarnation is only attributed to gods or heroes, and
this may point to the divinity of the bulls. We have seen that this and
another altar may depict some myth in which the bull was the incarnation
of a tree or vegetation spirit. The divine nature of the bull is
attested by its presence on Gaulish coins as a religious symbol, and by
images of the animal with

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

three horns--an obvious symbol of divinity. <span
id="fr_695"></span>[1](#fn_694.md) On such an image in bronze the Cimbri,
Celticised Germans, swore. The images are pre-Roman, since they are
found at Hallstadt and La Tène. Personal names like Donnotaurus (the
equivalent of the *Donn Taruos* of the *Táin*) or Deiotaros ("divine
bull"), show that men were called after the divine animal. <span
id="fr_696"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) Similarly many place-names in which the
word *taruos* occurs, in Northern Italy, the Pyrenees, Scotland,
Ireland, and elsewhere, suggest that the places bearing these names were
sites of a bull cult or that some myth, like that elaborated in the
*Táin*, had been there localised. <span id="fr_697"></span>[3](#fn_696.md)
But, as possibly in the case of Cúchulainn and the bull, the animal
tended to become the symbol of a god, a tendency perhaps aided by the
spread of Mithraism with its symbolic bull. A god Medros leaning on a
bull is represented at Haguenau, possibly a form of Mider or of Meduris,
a surname of Toutatis, unless Medros is simply Mithras. <span
id="fr_698"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) Echoes of the cult of the bull or cow
are heard in Irish tales of these animals brought from the *síd*, or of
magic bulls or of cows which produced enormous supplies of milk, or in
saintly legends of oxen leading a saint to the site of his future
church. <span id="fr_699"></span>[5](#fn_698.md) These legends are also
told of the swine, <span id="fr_700"></span>[6](#fn_699.md) and they
perhaps arose when a Christian church took the place of the site of a
local animal cult, legend fusing the old and the new cult by making the
once divine animal point out the site of the church. A late relic of a
bull cult may be found in the carnival procession of the *Bœuf Gras* at
Paris.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

A cult of a swine-god Moccus has been referred to. The boar was a divine
symbol on standards, coins, and altars, and many bronze images of the
animal have been found. These were temple treasures, and in one case the
boar is three-horned. <span id="fr_701"></span>[1](#fn_700.md) But it was
becoming the symbol of a goddess, as is seen by the altars on which it
accompanies a goddess, perhaps of fertility, and by a bronze image of a
goddess seated on a boar. The altars occur in Britain, of which the
animal may be the emblem--the "Caledonian monster" of Claudian's
poem. <span id="fr_702"></span>[2](#fn_701.md) The Galatian Celts abstained
from eating the swine, and there has always been a prejudice against its
flesh in the Highlands. This has a totemic appearance. <span
id="fr_703"></span>[3](#fn_702.md) But the swine is esteemed in Ireland,
and in the texts monstrous swine are the staple article of famous
feasts. <span id="fr_704"></span>[4](#fn_703.md) These may have been
legendary forms of old swine-gods, the feasts recalling sacrificial
feasts on their flesh. Magic swine were also the immortal food of the
gods. But the boar was tabu to certain persons, *e.g.* Diarmaid, though
whether this is the attenuated memory of a clan totem restriction is
uncertain. In Welsh story the swine comes from Elysium--a myth
explaining the origin of its domestication, while domestication
certainly implies an earlier cult of the animal. When animals come to be
domesticated, the old cult restrictions, *e.g.* against eating them,
usually pass away. For this reason, perhaps, the Gauls, who worshipped
an anthropomorphic swine-god, trafficked in the animal and may have
eaten it. <span id="fr_705"></span>[5](#fn_704.md) Welsh story also tells
of the magic boar, the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Twrch Trwyth*, hunted by Arthur, possibly a
folk-tale reminiscence of a boar divinity. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_705.md) Place-names also point to a cult of the
swine, and a recollection of its divinity may underlie the numerous
Irish tales of magical swine. <span id="fr_707"></span>[2](#fn_706.md) The
magic swine which issued from the cave of Cruachan and destroyed the
young crops are suggestive of the theriomorphic corn-spirit in its
occasional destructive aspect. <span id="fr_708"></span>[3](#fn_707.md)
Bones of the swine, sometimes cremated, have been found in Celtic graves
in Britain and at Hallstadt, and in one case the animal was buried alone
in a tumulus at Hallstadt, just as sacred animals were buried in Egypt,
Greece, and elsewhere. <span id="fr_709"></span>[4](#fn_708.md) When the
animal was buried with the dead, it may have been as a sacrifice to the
ghost or to the god of the underworld.

The divinity of the serpent is proved by the occurrence of a horned
serpent with twelve Roman gods on a Gallo-Roman altar. <span
id="fr_710"></span>[5](#fn_709.md) In other cases a horned or ram's-headed
serpent appears as the attribute of a god, and we have seen that the
ram's-headed serpent may be a fusion of the serpent as a chthonian
animal with the ram, sacrificed to the dead. In Greece Dionysus had the
form both of a bull and a horned serpent, the horn being perhaps derived
from the bull symbol. M. Reinach claims that the primitive elements of
the Orphic myth of the Thracian Dionysos-Zagreus--divine serpents
producing an egg whence came the horned snake Zagreus, occur in
dislocated form in Gaul. There enlacing serpents were believed to
produce a magic egg, and there a horned

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

serpent was worshipped, but was not connected with the egg. But they may
once have been connected, and if so, there may be a common foundation
both for the Greek and the Celtic conceptions in a Celtic element in
Thrace. <span id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_710.md) The resemblances, however,
may be mere coincidences, and horned serpents are known in other
mythologies--the horn being perhaps a symbol of divinity. The horned
serpent sometimes accompanies a god who has horns, possibly Cernunnos,
the underworld god, in accordance with the chthonian character of the
serpent. <span id="fr_712"></span>[2](#fn_711.md) In the Cúchulainn cycle
Loeg on his visit to the Other-world saw two-headed serpents--perhaps a
further hint of this aspect of the animal. <span
id="fr_713"></span>[3](#fn_712.md)

In all these instances of animal cults examples of the tendency to make
the divine animal anthropomorphic have been seen. We have now to
consider some instances of the complete anthropomorphic process.

### 2.

An old bear cult gave place to the cult of a bear goddess and probably
of a god. At Berne--an old Celtic place-name meaning "bear"--was found a
bronze group of a goddess holding a patera with fruit, and a bear
approaching her as if to be fed. The inscription runs, *Deae Artioni
Licinia Sabinilla*. <span id="fr_714"></span>[4](#fn_713.md) A local
bear-cult had once existed at Berne, and is still recalled in the
presence of the famous bears there, but the divine bear had given place
to a goddess whose name and symbol were ursine. From an old Celtic
*Artos*, fem. *Arta*, "bear," were derived various divine names. Of
these *Dea Artio*(*n*)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

means "bear goddess," and *Artaios*, equated with Mercury, is perhaps a
bear god. <span id="fr_715"></span>[1](#fn_714.md) Another bear goddess,
Andarta, was honoured at Die (Drôme), the word perhaps meaning "strong
bear"--*And*- being an augmentive. <span id="fr_716"></span>[2](#fn_715.md)
Numerous place-names derived from *Artos* perhaps witness to a
widespread cult of the bear, and the word also occurs in Welsh, and
Irish personal names--Arthmael, Arthbiu, and possibly Arthur, and the
numerous Arts of Irish texts. Descent from the divine bear is also
signified in names like Welsh *Arthgen*, Irish *Artigan*, from
*Artigenos*, "son of the bear." Another Celtic name for "bear" was the
Gaulish *matu* Irish *math*, found in *Matugenos*, "son of the bear,"
and in MacMahon, which is a corrupt form of *Mac-math-ghamhain*, "son of
the bear's son," or "of the bear." <span id="fr_717"></span>[3](#fn_716.md)

Similarly a cult of the stag seems to have given place to that of a god
with stag's horns, represented on many bas-reliefs, and probably
connected with the underworld. <span id="fr_718"></span>[4](#fn_717.md) The
stag, as a grain-eater, may have been regarded as the embodiment of the
corn-spirit, and then associated with the under-earth region whence the
corn sprang, by one of those inversions of thought so common in the
stage of transition from animal gods to gods with animal symbols. The
elk may have been worshipped in Ireland, and a three antlered stag is
the subject of a story in the Fionn saga. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[5](#fn_718.md) Its third antler, like the third horn of
bull or boar, may be a sign of divinity.

The horse had also been worshipped, but a goddess Epona (Gaul. *epo-s*,
"horse"), protectress of horses and asses, took its place, and had a
far-spread cult. She rides a horse or mare

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

with its foal, or is seated among horses, or feeds horses. A
representation of a mare suckling a foal--a design analogous to those in
which Epona feeds foals--shows that her primitive equine nature had not
been forgotten. <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_719.md) The Gauls were
horse-rearers, and Epona was the goddess of the craft; but, as in other
cases, a cult of the horse must have preceded its domestication, and its
flesh may not have been eaten, or, if so, only sacramentally. <span
id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_720.md) Finally, the divine horse became the
anthropomorphic horse-goddess. Her images were placed in stables, and
several inscriptions and statuettes have been found in such buildings or
in cavalry barracks. <span id="fr_722"></span>[3](#fn_721.md) The remains
of the cult have been found in the Danube and Rhine valleys, in Eastern
Gaul, and in Northern Italy, all Celtic regions, but it was carried
everywhere by Roman cavalry recruited from the Celtic tribes. <span
id="fr_723"></span>[4](#fn_722.md) Epona is associated with, and often has,
the symbols of the *Matres*, and one inscription reads *Eponabus*, as if
there were a group of goddesses called Epona. <span
id="fr_724"></span>[5](#fn_723.md) A goddess who promoted the fertility of
mares would easily be associated with goddesses of fertility. Epona may
also have been confused with a river-goddess conceived of as a spirited
steed. Water-spirits took that shape, and the *Matres* were also
river-goddesses.

A statuette of a horse, with a dedication to a god Rudiobus, otherwise
unknown, may have been carried processionally, while a mule has a
dedication to Segomo, equated elsewhere with Mars. A mule god Mullo,
also equated with Mars, is mentioned on several inscriptions. <span
id="fr_725"></span>[6](#fn_724.md) The connection with Mars

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

may have been found in the fact that the October horse was sacrificed to
him for fertility, while the horse was probably associated with
fertility among the Celts. The horse was sacrificed both by Celts and
Teutons at the Midsummer festival, undoubtedly as a divine animal.
Traces of the Celtic custom survive in local legends, and may be
interpreted in the fuller light of the Teutonic accounts. In Ireland a
man wearing a horse's head rushed through the fire, and was supposed to
represent all cattle; in other words, he was a surrogate for them. The
legend of Each Labra, a horse which lived in a mound and issued from it
every Midsummer eve to give oracles for the coming year, is probably
connected with the Midsummer sacrifice of the horse. <span
id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_725.md) Among the Teutons the horse was a divine
sacrificial animal, and was also sacred to Freyr, the god of fertility,
while in Teutonic survivals a horse's head was placed in the Midsummer
fire. <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_726.md) The horse was sporadically
the representative of the corn-spirit, and at Rome the October horse was
sacrificed in that capacity and for fertility. <span
id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_727.md) Among the Celts, the horse sacrificed at
Midsummer may have represented the vegetation-spirit and benefited all
domestic animals--the old rite surviving in an attenuated form, as
described above.

Perhaps the goddess Damona was an animal divinity, if her name is
derived from *damatos*, "sheep," cognate to Welsh *dafad*, "sheep," and
Gaelic *damh*, "ox." Other divine animals, as has been seen, were
associated with the waters, and the use of beasts and birds in
divination doubtless points to their divine character. A cult of
bird-gods may lurk behind the divine name Bran, "raven," and the
reference to the magic birds of Rhiannon in the *Triads*.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

### 3.

Animal worship is connected with totemism, and certain things point to
its existence among the Celts, or to the existence of conditions out of
which totemism was elsewhere developed. These are descent from animals,
animal tabus, the sacramental eating of an animal, and exogamy.

\(1\) *Descent from animals*.--Celtic names implying descent from
animals or plants are of two classes, clan and personal names. If the
latter are totemistic, they must be derived from the former, since
totemism is an affair of the clan, while the so-called "personal totem,"
exemplified by the American Indian *manitou*, is the guardian but never
the ancestor of a man. Some clan names have already been referred to.
Others are the Bibroci of south-east Britain, probably a beaver clan
(*bebros*), and the Eburones, a yew-tree clan (*eburos*). <span
id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_728.md) Irish clans bore animal names: some
groups were called "calves," others "griffins," others "red deer," and a
plant name is seen in *Fir Bile*, "men of the tree." <span
id="fr_730"></span>[2](#fn_729.md) Such clan totemism perhaps underlies the
stories of the "descendants of the wolf" at Ossory, who became wolves
for a time as the result of a saintly curse. Other instances of
lycanthropy were associated with certain families. <span
id="fr_731"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) The belief in lycanthropy might easily
attach itself to existing wolf-clans, the transformation being then
explained as the result of a curse. <span
id="fr_732"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) The stories of Cormac mac Art, suckled
by a she-wolf, of Lughaid mac Con, "son of a wolf-dog," suckled by that
animal, and of Oisin, whose mother was a fawn, and who would not eat
venison, are perhaps totemistic,

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

while to totemism or to a cult of animals may be ascribed what early
travellers in Ireland say of the people taking wolves as god-fathers and
praying to them to do them no ill. <span id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_731.md)
In Wales bands of warriors at the battle of Cattraeth are described in
Oneurin's *Gododin* as dogs, wolves, bears, and ravens, while Owein's
band of ravens which fought against Arthur, may have been a raven clan,
later misunderstood as actual ravens. <span
id="fr_734"></span>[2](#fn_732.md) Certain groups of Dalriad Scots bore
animal names--Cinel Gabran, "Little goat clan," and Cinel Loarn, "Fox
clan." Possibly the custom of denoting Highland clans by animal or plant
badges may be connected with a belief in descent from plants or animals.
On many coins an animal is represented on horseback, perhaps leading a
clan, as birds led the Celts to the Danube area, and these may depict
myths telling how the clan totem animal led the clan to its present
territory. <span id="fr_735"></span>[3](#fn_733.md) Such myths may survive
in legends relating how an animal led a saint to the site of his
church. <span id="fr_736"></span>[4](#fn_734.md) Celtic warriors wore
helmets with horns, and Irish story speaks of men with cat, dog, or goat
heads. <span id="fr_737"></span>[5](#fn_735.md) These may have been men
wearing a head-gear formed of the skin or head of the clan totem, hence
remembered at a later time as monstrous beings, while the horned helmets
would be related to the same custom. Solinus describes the Britons as
wearing animal skins before going into battle. <span
id="fr_738"></span>[6](#fn_736.md) Were these skins of totem animals under
whose protection they thus placed themselves? The "forms of beasts,
birds, and fishes" which the Cruithne or Picts tattooed on their bodies
may have been totem marks, while the painting of their bodies with woad
among the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

southern Britons may have been of the same character, though Cæsar's
words hardly denote this. Certain marks on faces figured on Gaulish
coins seem to be tattoo marks. <span id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_737.md)

It is not impossible that an early wolf-totem may have been associated,
because of the animal's nocturnal wanderings in forests, with the
underworld whence, according to Celtic belief, men sprang and whither
they returned, and whence all vegetation came forth. The Gallo-Roman
Silvanus, probably an underworld god, wears a wolf-skin, and may thus be
a wolf-god. There were various types of underworld gods, and this
wolf-type--perhaps a local wolf-totem ancestor assimilated to a local
"Dispater"--may have been the god of a clan who imposed its mythic wolf
origin on other clans. Some Celtic bronzes show a wolf swallowing a man
who offers no resistance, probably because he is dead. The wolf is much
bigger than the man, and hence may be a god. <span
id="fr_740"></span>[2](#fn_738.md) These bronzes would thus represent a
belief setting forth the return of men to their totem ancestor after
death, or to the underworld god connected with the totem ancestor, by
saying that he devoured the dead, like certain Polynesian divinities and
the Greek Eurynomos.

In many individual names the first part is the name of an animal or
plant, the second is usually *genos*, "born from," or "son of," *e.g.*
Artigenos, Matugenos, "son of the bear" (*artos*, *matu*-); Urogenos,
occurring as Urogenertos, "he who has the strength of the son of the
urus"; Brannogenos, "son of the raven"; Cunogenos, "son of the
dog." <span id="fr_741"></span>[3](#fn_739.md) These names may be derived
from clan totem names, but they date back to a time when animals, trees,
and men were on a common footing,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

and the possibility of human descent from a tree or an animal was
believed in. Professor Rhŷs has argued from the frequency of personal
names in Ireland, like Cúrói, "Hound of Roi," Cú Corb, "Corb's Hound,"
Mac Con, "Hound's Son," and Maelchon, "Hound's Slave," that there
existed a dog totem or god, not of the Celts, but of a pre-Celtic
race. <span id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_740.md) This assumes that totemism
was non-Celtic, an assumption based on preconceived notions of what
Celtic institutions ought to have been. The names, it should be
observed, are personal, not clan names.

\(2\) *Animal tabus*.--Besides the dislike of swine's flesh already
noted among certain Celtic groups, the killing and eating of the hare,
hen, and goose were forbidden among the Britons. Cæsar says they bred
these animals for amusement, but this reason assigned by him is drawn
from his knowledge of the breeding of rare animals by rich Romans as a
pastime, since he had no knowledge of the breeding of sacred animals
which were not eaten--a common totemic or animal cult custom. <span
id="fr_743"></span>[2](#fn_741.md) The hare was used for divination by
Boudicca, <span id="fr_744"></span>[3](#fn_742.md) doubtless as a sacred
animal, and it has been found that a sacred character still attaches to
these animals in Wales. A cock or hen was ceremonially killed and eaten
on Shrove Tuesday, either as a former totemic animal, or, less likely,
as a representative of the corn-spirit. The hare is not killed in
certain districts, but occasionally it is ceremonially hunted and slain
annually, while at yearly fairs the goose is sold exclusively and
eaten. <span id="fr_745"></span>[4](#fn_743.md) Elsewhere, *e.g.* in Devon,
a ram or lamb is ceremonially slain and eaten, the eating being believed
to confer

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

luck. <span id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_744.md) The ill-luck supposed to
follow the killing of certain animals may also be reminiscent of totemic
tabus. Fish were not eaten by the Pictish Meatæ and Caledonii, and a
dislike of eating certain fresh-water fish was observed among certain
eighteenth century Highlanders. <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_745.md) It
has been already seen that certain fish living in sacred wells were
tabu, and were believed to give oracles. Heron's flesh was disliked in
Ireland, and it was considered unlucky to kill a swan in the
Hebrides. <span id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_746.md) Fatal results following
upon the killing or eating of an animal with which the eater was
connected by name or descent are found in the Irish sagas. Conaire was
son of a woman and a bird which could take human shape, and it was
forbidden to him to hunt birds. On one occasion he did so, and for this
as well as the breaking of other tabus, he lost his life. <span
id="fr_749"></span>[4](#fn_747.md) It was tabu to Cúchulainn, "the hound of
Culann," to eat dog's flesh, and, having been persuaded to do this, his
strength went from him, and he perished. Diarmaid, having been forbidden
to hunt a boar with which his life was connected, was induced by Fionn
to break this tabu, and in consequence he lost his life by one of the
boar's bristles entering his foot, or (in a variant) by the boar's
killing him. Another instance is found in a tale of certain men
transformed to badgers. They were slain by Cormac, and brought to his
father Tadg to eat. Tadg unaccountably loathed them, because they were
transformed men and his cousins. <span id="fr_750"></span>[5](#fn_748.md)
In this tale, which may contain the *débris* of totemic usage, the
loathing arises from the fact that the badgers are men--a common form of
myths explanatory of misunderstood totemic customs, but the old idea of
the relation between a man and

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

his totem is not lost sight of. The other tales may also be reminiscent
of a clan totem tabu, later centred in a mythic hero. Perhaps the belief
in lucky or unlucky animals, or in omens drawn from their appearance,
may be based on old totem beliefs or in beliefs in the divinity of the
animals.

\(3\) *Sacramental eating of an animal*.--The custom of "hunting the
wren," found over the whole Celtic area, is connected with animal
worship and may be totemistic in origin. In spite of its small size, the
wren was known as the king of birds, and in the Isle of Man it was
hunted and killed on Christmas or S. Stephen's day. The bird was carried
in procession from door to door, to the accompaniment of a chant, and
was then solemnly buried, dirges being sung. In some cases a feather was
left at each house and carefully treasured, and there are traces of a
custom of boiling and eating the bird. <span
id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_749.md) In Ireland, the hunt and procession were
followed by a feast, the materials of which were collected from house to
house, and a similar usage obtained in France, where the youth who
killed the bird was called "king." <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_750.md)
In most of these districts it was considered unlucky or dangerous to
kill the bird at any other time, yet it might be ceremonially killed
once a year, the dead animal conferred luck, and was solemnly eaten or
buried with signs of mourning. Similar customs with animals which are
actually worshipped are found elsewhere, <span
id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_751.md) and they lend support to the idea that
the Celts regarded the wren as a divine animal, or perhaps a totem
animal, that it was necessary to slay it ritually, and to carry it round
the houses of the community to obtain its divine influence, to eat it
sacramentally or to bury it.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Probably like customs were followed in the case
of other animals, <span id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_752.md) and these may
have given rise to such stories as that of the eating of MacDatho's
wonderful boar, as well as to myths which regarded certain animals,
*e.g.* the swine, as the immortal food of the gods. Other examples of
ritual survivals of such sacramental eating have already been noted, and
it is not improbable that the eating of a sacred pastoral animal
occurred at Samhain.

\(4\) *Exogamy*.--Exogamy and the counting of descent through the mother
are closely connected with totemism, and some traces of both are found
among the Celts. Among the Picts, who were, perhaps, a Celtic group of
the Brythonic stock, these customs survived in the royal house. The
kingship passed to a brother of the king by the same mother, or to a
sister's son, while the king's father was never king and was frequently
a "foreigner." Similar rules of succession prevailed in early Aryan
royal houses--Greek and Roman,--and may, as Dr. Stokes thought, have
existed at Tara in Ireland, while in a Fian tale of Oisin he marries the
daughter of the king of Tír na n-Og, and succeeds him as king partly for
that reason, and partly because he had beaten him in the annual race for
the kingship. <span id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_753.md) Such an athletic
contest for the kingship was known in early Greece, and this tale may
support the theory of the Celtic priest-kingship, the holder of the
office retaining it as long as he was not defeated or slain. Traces of
succession through a sister's son are found in the *Mabinogion*, and
Livy describes how the mythic Celtic king Ambicatus sent not his own but
his sister's sons to found new kingdoms. <span
id="fr_756"></span>[3](#fn_754.md) Irish and Welsh divine and heroic groups

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

are named after the mother, not the father--the children of Danu and of
Don, and the men of Domnu. Anu is mother of the gods, Buanann of heroes.
The eponymous ancestor of the Scots is a woman, Scota, and the earliest
colonisers of Ireland are women, not men. In the sagas gods and heroes
have frequently a matronymic, and the father's name is omitted--Lug mac
Ethnend, Conchobar mac Nessa, Indech, son of De Domnann, Corpre, son of
Etain, and others. Perhaps parallel to this is the custom of calling men
after their wives--*e.g.* the son of Fergus is Fer Tlachtga, Tlachtga's
husband. <span id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_755.md) In the sagas, females
(goddesses and heroines) have a high place accorded to them, and
frequently choose their own lovers or husbands--customs suggestive of
the matriarchate. Thus what was once a general practice was later
confined to the royal house or told of divine or heroic personages.
Possibly certain cases of incest may really be exaggerated accounts of
misunderstood unions once permissible by totemic law. Cæsar speaks of
British polyandry, brothers, sons, and fathers sharing a wife in
common. <span id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_756.md) Strabo speaks of Irish
unions with mothers and sisters, perhaps referring not to actual
practice but to reports of saga tales of incest. <span
id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_757.md) Dio Cassius speaks of community of wives
among the Caledonians and Meatæ, and Jerome says much the same of the
Scoti and Atecotti. <span id="fr_760"></span>[4](#fn_758.md) These notices,
with the exception of Cæsar's, are vague, yet they refer to marriage
customs different from those known to their reporters. In Irish sagas
incest legends circle round the descendants of Etain--fathers unite with
daughters, a son with his mother, a woman has a son by her three
brothers (just as Ecne was son of Brian, Iuchar, and

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

Iucharba), and is also mother of Crimthan by that son. <span
id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_759.md) Brother and sister unions occur both in
Irish and Welsh story. <span id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_760.md)

In these cases incest with a mother cannot be explained by totemic
usage, but the cases may be distorted reminiscences of what might occur
under totemism, namely, a son taking the wives of his father other than
his own mother, when those were of a different totem from his own. Under
totemism, brothers and sisters by different mothers having different
totems, might possibly unite, and such unions are found in many
mythologies. Later, when totemism passed away, the unions, regarded with
horror, would be supposed to take place between children by the same
mother. According to totem law, a father might unite with his daughter,
since she was of her mother's totem, but in practice this was frowned
upon. Polygamy also may co-exist with totemism, and of course involves
the counting of descent through the mother as a rule. If, as is
suggested by the "debility" of the Ultonians, and by other evidence, the
couvade was a Celtic institution, this would also point to the existence
of the matriarchate with the Celts. To explain all this as pre-Aryan, or
to say that the classical notices refer to non-Aryan tribes and that the
evidence in the Irish sagas only shows that the Celts had been
influenced by the customs of aboriginal tribes among whom they
lived <span id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_761.md) is to neglect the fact that
the customs are closely bound up with Celtic life, while it leaves
unexplained the influence of such customs upon a people whose own
customs, according to this theory,

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

were so totally different. The evidence, taken as a whole, points to the
existence of totemism among the early Celts, or, at all events, of the
elements which elsewhere compose it.

 

Celtic animal worship dates back to the primitive hunting and pastoral
period, when men worshipped the animals which they hunted or reared.
They may have apologised to the animal hunted and slain--a form of
worship, or, where animals were not hunted or were reared and
worshipped, one of them may have been slain annually and eaten to obtain
its divine power. Care was taken to preserve certain sacred animals
which were not hunted, and this led to domestication, the abstinence of
earlier generations leading to an increased food supply at a later time,
when domesticated animals were freely slain. But the earlier sacramental
slaying of such animals survived in the religious aspect of their
slaughter at the beginning of winter. <span
id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_762.md) The cult of animals was also connected
with totemic usage, though at a later stage this cult was replaced by
that of anthropomorphic divinities, with the older divine animals as
their symbols, sacrificial victims, and the like. This evolution now led
to the removal of restrictions upon slaying and eating the animals. On
the other hand, the more primitive animal cults may have remained here
and there. Animal cults were, perhaps, largely confined to men. With the
rise of agriculture mainly as an art in the hands of women, and the
consequent cult of the Earth-mother, of fertility and corn-spirits
probably regarded as female, the sacramental eating of the divine animal
may have led to the slaying and eating of a human or animal victim
supposed to embody such a spirit. Later the two cults were bound to
coalesce, and the divine animal and the animal embodiment of the
vegetation

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

spirit would not be differentiated. On the other hand, when men began to
take part in women's fertility cults, the fact that such spirits were
female or were perhaps coming to be regarded as goddesses, may have led
men to envisage certain of the anthropomorphic animal divinities as
goddesses, since some of these, *e.g.* Epona and Damona, are female. But
with the increasing participation of men in agriculture, the spirits or
goddesses of fertility would tend to become male, or the consorts or
mothers of gods of fertility, though the earlier aspect was never lost
sight of, witness the Corn-Mother. The evolution of divine priest-kings
would cause them to take the place of the earlier priestesses of these
cults, one of whom may have been the divine victim. Yet in local
survivals certain cults were still confined to women, and still had
their priestesses. <span id="fr_765"></span>[1](#fn_763.md)
