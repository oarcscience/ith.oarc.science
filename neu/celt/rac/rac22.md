### CHAPTER XIX.

# ACCESSORIES OF CULT.

### TEMPLES.

IN primitive religion the place of worship is seldom a temple made with
hands, but rather an enclosed space in which the symbol or image of the
god stands. The sacredness of the god makes the place of his cult
sacred. Often an open space in the forest is the scene of the regular
cult. There the priests perform the sacred rites; none may enter it but
themselves; and the trembling worshipper approaches it with awe lest the
god should slay him if he came too near.

The earliest temples of the Gauls were sacred groves, one of which, near
Massilia, is described by Lucan. No bird built in it, no animal lurked
near, the leaves constantly shivered when no breeze stirred them. Altars
stood in its midst, and the images of the gods were misshapen trunks of
trees. Every tree was stained with sacrificial blood. The poet then
describes marvels heard or seen in the grove--the earth groaning, dead
yews reviving, trees surrounded with flame yet not consumed, and huge
serpents twining round the oaks. The people feared to approach the
grove, and even the priest would not walk there at midday or midnight
lest he should then meet its divine guardian. <span
id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_951.md) Dio speaks of human sacrifices offered
to Andrasta in a British grove, and in 61 A.D. the woods of Mona,
devoted to strange rites, were cut down by

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Roman soldiers. <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_952.md) The sacred *Dru-nemeton* of the Galatian
Celts may have been a grove. <span id="fr_955"></span>[2](#fn_953.md)
Place-names also point to the widespread existence of such groves, since
the word *nemeton*, "grove," occurs in many of them, showing that the
places so called had been sites of a cult. In Ireland, *fid-nemed* stood
for "sacred grove." <span id="fr_956"></span>[3](#fn_954.md) The ancient
groves were still the objects of veneration in Christian times, though
fines were levied against those who still clung to the old ways. <span
id="fr_957"></span>[4](#fn_955.md)

Sacred groves were still used in Gallo-Roman times, and the Druids may
have had a preference for them, a preference which may underlie the
words of the scholiast on Lucan, that "the Druids worship the gods
without temples in woods." But probably more elaborate temples, great
tribal sanctuaries, existed side by side with these local groves,
especially in Cisalpine Gaul, where the Boii had a temple in which were
stored the spoils of war, while the Insubri had a similar temple. <span
id="fr_958"></span>[5](#fn_956.md) These were certainly buildings. The
"consecrated place" in Transalpine Gaul, which Cæsar mentions, and where
at fixed periods judgments were given, might be either a grove or a
temple. Cæsar uses the same phrase for sacred places where the spoils of
war were heaped; these may have been groves, but Diodorus speaks of
treasure collected in "temples and sacred places" (ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς καὶ
τεμένεσιν), and Plutarch speaks of the "temple" where the Arverni hung
Cæsar's sword. <span id="fr_959"></span>[6](#fn_957.md) The "temple" of the
Namnite women, unroofed and re-roofed in a day, must have been a
building. There is no evidence that the insular Celts had temples. In

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Gallo-Roman times, elaborate temples, perhaps
occupying sites of earlier groves or temples, sprang up over the
Romano-Celtic area. They were built on Roman models, many of them were
of great size, and they were dedicated to Roman or Gallo-Roman
divinities. <span id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_958.md) Smaller shrines were
built by grateful worshippers at sacred springs to their presiding
divinity, as many inscriptions show. In the temples stood images of the
gods, and here were stored sacred vessels, sometimes made of the skulls
of enemies, spoils of war dedicated to the gods, money collected for
sacred purposes, and war standards, especially those which bore divine
symbols.

The old idea that stone circles were Druidic temples, that human
sacrifices were offered on the "altar-stone," and libations of blood
poured into the cup-markings, must be given up, along with much of the
astronomical lore associated with the circles. Stonehenge dates from the
close of the Neolithic Age, and most of the smaller circles belong to
the early Bronze Age, and are probably pre-Celtic. In any case they were
primarily places of sepulture. As such they would be the scene of
ancestor worship, but yet not temples in the strict sense of the word.
The larger circles, burial-places of great chiefs or kings, would become
central places for the recurring rites of ghost-worship, possibly also
rallying places of the tribe on stated occasions. But whether this
ghost-worship was ever transmuted into the cult of a god at the circles
is uncertain and, indeed, unlikely. The Celts would naturally regard
these places as sacred, since the ghosts of the dead, even those of a
vanquished people, are always dangerous, and they also took over the
myths and legends <span id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_959.md) associated with

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

them, such, *e.g.*, as regarded the stones themselves, or trees growing
within the circles, as embodiments of the dead, while they may also have
used them as occasional places of secondary interment. Whether they were
ever led to copy such circles themselves is uncertain, since their own
methods of interment seem to have been different. We have seen that the
gods may in some cases have been worshipped at tumuli, and that Lugnasad
was, at some centres, connected with commemorative cults at
burial-places (mounds, not circles). But the reasons for this are
obscure, nor is there any hint that other Celtic festivals were held
near burial mounds. Probably such commemorative rites at places of
sepulture during Lugnasad were only part of a wider series occurring
elsewhere, and we cannot assume from such vague notices that stone
circles were Druidic temples where worship of an Oriental nature was
carried on.

Professor Rhŷs is disposed to accept the old idea that Stonehenge was
the temple of Apollo in the island of the Hyperboreans, mentioned by
Diodorus, where the sun-god was worshipped. <span
id="fr_962"></span>[1](#fn_960.md) But though that temple was circular, it
had walls adorned with votive offerings. Nor does the temple unroofed
yearly by the Namnite women imply a stone circle, for there is not the
slightest particle of evidence that the circles were ever roofed in any
way. <span id="fr_963"></span>[2](#fn_961.md) Stone circles with mystic
trees growing in them, one of them with a well by which entrance was
gained to *Tír fa Tonn*, are mentioned in Irish tales. They were
connected with magic rites, but are not spoken of as temples. <span
id="fr_964"></span>[3](#fn_962.md)

### ALTARS.

Lucan describes realistically the awful sacrifices of the Gauls on cruel
altars not a whit milder than those of Diana,

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

and he speaks of "altars piled with offerings" in the sacred grove at
Marseilles. <span id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_963.md) Cicero says that human
victims were sacrificed on altars, and Tacitus describes the altars of
Mona smeared with human blood. <span id="fr_966"></span>[2](#fn_964.md)
"Druids' altars" are mentioned in the Irish "Expedition of Dathi," and
Cormac speaks of *indelba*, or altars adorned with emblems. <span
id="fr_967"></span>[3](#fn_965.md) Probably many of these altars were mere
heaps of stone like the Norse *horg*, or a great block of stone. Some
sacrifices, however, were too extensive to be offered on an altar, but
in such cases the blood would be sprinkled upon it. Under Roman
influence, Celtic altars took the form of those of the conquerors, with
inscriptions containing names of native or Roman gods and bas-reliefs
depicting some of these. The old idea that dolmens were Celtic altars is
now abandoned. They were places of sepulture of the Neolithic or early
Bronze Age, and were originally covered with a mound of earth. During
the era of Celtic paganism they were therefore hidden from sight, and it
is only in later times that the earth has been removed and the massive
stones, arranged so as to form a species of chamber, have been laid
bare.

### IMAGES.

The Gauls, according to Cæsar, possessed *plurima simulacra* of the
native Mercury, but he does not refer to images of other gods. We need
not infer from this that the Celts had a prejudice against images, for
among the Irish Celts images are often mentioned, and in Gaul under
Roman rule many images existed.

The existence of images among the Celts as among other

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

peoples, may owe something to the cult of trees and of stones set up
over the dead. The stone, associated with the dead man's spirit, became
an image of himself, perhaps rudely fashioned in his likeness. A
rough-hewn tree trunk became an image of the spirit or god of trees. On
the other hand, some anthropomorphic images, like the palæolithic or
Mycenæan figurines, may have been fashioned without the intermediary of
tree-trunk or stone pillar. Maximus of Tyre says that the Celtic image
of Zeus was a lofty oak, perhaps a rough-hewn trunk rather than a
growing tree, and such roughly carved tree-trunks, images of gods, are
referred to by Lucan in his description of the Massilian grove. <span
id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_966.md) Pillar stones set up over the graves of
the dead are often mentioned in Irish texts. These would certainly be
associated with the dead; indeed, existing legends show that they were
believed to be tenanted by the ghosts and to have the power of motion.
This suggests that they had been regarded as images of the dead. Other
stones honoured in Ireland were the *cloch labrais*, an oracular stone;
the *lia fail*, or coronation stone, which shouted when a king of the
Milesian race seated himself upon it; and the *lia adrada*, or stone of
adoration, apparently a boundary stone. <span
id="fr_969"></span>[2](#fn_967.md) The *plurima simulacra* of the Gaulish
Mercury may have been boundary stones like those dedicated to Mercury or
Hermes among the Romans and Greeks. Did Cæsar conclude, or was it
actually the case, that the Gauls dedicated such stones to a god of
boundaries who might be equated with Mercury? Many such standing stones
still exist in France, and their number must have been greater in
Cæsar's time. Seeing them the objects of superstitious observances, he
may have concluded that they were simulacra of a god. Other Romans
besides himself had been struck by

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

the resemblance of these stones to their Hermai, and perhaps the Gauls,
if they did not already regard them as symbols of a god, acquiesced in
the resemblance. Thus, on the menhir of Kervadel are sculptured four
figures, one being that of Mercury, dating from Gallo-Roman times.
Beneath another, near Peronne, a bronze statuette of Mercury was
discovered. <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_968.md) This would seem to
show that the Gauls had a cult of pillar stones associated with a god of
boundaries. Cæsar probably uses the word *simulacrum* in the sense of
"symbol" rather than "image," though he may have meant native images not
fully carved in human shape, like the Irish *cérmand cerstach*,
ornamented with gold and silver, the "chief idol" of north Ireland, or
like the similarly ornamented "images" of Cromm Cruaich and his
satellites. <span id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_969.md) The adoration of
sacred stones continued into Christian times and was much opposed by the
Church. <span id="fr_972"></span>[3](#fn_970.md) S. Samson of Dol (sixth
century) found men dancing round a *simulacrum abominabile*, which seems
to have been a kind of standing stone, and having besought them to
desist, he carved a cross upon it. <span id="fr_973"></span>[4](#fn_971.md)
Several *menhirion* in France are now similarly ornamented. <span
id="fr_974"></span>[5](#fn_972.md)

The number of existing Gallo-Roman images shows that the Celts had not
adopted a custom which was foreign to them, and they must have already
possessed rude native images. The disappearance of these would be
explained if they were made of perishable material. Wooden images of the
*Matres* have been occasionally found, and these may be pre-Roman. Some
of the images of the three-headed and crouching gods show no sign of
Roman influences in their modelling, and they may have been copied from
earlier images of wood. We also find

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

divine figures on pre-Roman coins. <span id="fr_975"></span>[1](#fn_973.md)
Certain passages in classical writings point to the existence of native
images. A statue of a goddess existed in a temple at Marseilles,
according to Justin, and the Galatian Celts had images of the native
Juppiter and Artemis, while the conquering Celts who entered Rome bowed
to the seated senators as to statues of the gods. <span
id="fr_976"></span>[2](#fn_974.md) The Gauls placed rich ornaments on the
images of the gods, and presumably these were native "idols."

"Idols" are frequently mentioned in Irish texts, and there is no doubt
that these mean images. <span id="fr_977"></span>[3](#fn_975.md) Cormac mac
Art refused to worship "idols," and was punished by the Druids. <span
id="fr_978"></span>[4](#fn_976.md) The idols of Cromm Cruaich and his
satellites, referred to in the *Dindsenchas*, were carved to represent
the human form; the chief one was of gold, the others of stone. These
were miraculously overthrown by S. Patrick; but in the account of the
miracle the chief idol was of stone adorned with gold and silver, the
others, numbering twelve, were ornamented with bronze. <span
id="fr_979"></span>[5](#fn_977.md) They stood in Mag Slecht, and similar
sacred places with groups of images evidently existed elsewhere, *e.g.*
at Rath Archaill, "where the Druid's altars and images are." <span
id="fr_980"></span>[6](#fn_978.md) The lady Cessair, before coming to
Ireland, is said to have taken advice of her *laimh-dhia*, or "hand
gods," perhaps small images used for divination. <span
id="fr_981"></span>[7](#fn_979.md)

For the British Celts the evidence is slender, but idolatry in the sense
of "image-worship" is frequently mentioned in the lives of early
saints. <span id="fr_982"></span>[8](#fn_980.md) Gildas also speaks of
images

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "mouldering away within and without the deserted
temples, with stiff and deformed features." <span
id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_981.md) This pathetic picture of the forsaken
shrines of forgotten gods may refer to Romano-Celtic images, but the
"stiff and deformed features" suggest rather native art, the art of a
people unskilful at reproducing the human form, however artistic they
may have been in other directions.

If the native Celts of Ireland had images, there is no reason to
suppose, especially considering the evidence just adduced, that the
Gauls, or at least the Druids, were antagonistic to images. This last is
M. Reinach's theory, part of a wider hypothesis that the Druids were
pre-Celtic, but became the priests of the Celts, who till then had no
priests. The Druids prohibited image-worship, and this prohibition
existed in Gaul, *ex hypothesi*, from the end of palæolithic times.
Pythagoras and his school were opposed to image-worship, and the
classical writers claimed a connection between the Pythagoreans and the
Druids. M. Reinach thinks there must have been some analogy between
them, and that was hostility to anthropomorphism. But the analogy is
distinctly stated to have lain in the doctrine of immortality or
metempsychosis. Had the Druids been opposed to image-worship, classical
observers could not have failed to notice the fact. M. Reinach then
argues that the Druids caused the erection of the megalithic monuments
in Gaul, symbols not images. They are thus Druidic, though not Celtic.
The monuments argue a powerful priesthood; the Druids were a powerful
priesthood; therefore the Druids caused the monuments to be built. This
is not a powerful argument! <span id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_982.md)

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

As has been seen, some purely Celtic images existed in Gaul. The Gauls,
who used nothing but wood for their houses, probably knew little of the
art of carving stone. They would therefore make most of their images of
wood--a perishable material. The insular Celts had images, and if, as
Cæsar maintained, the Druids came from Britain to Gaul, this points at
least to a similarity of cult in the two regions. Youthful Gauls who
aspired to Druidic knowledge went to Britain to obtain it. Would the
Druids of Gaul have permitted this, had they been iconoclasts? No single
text shows that the Druids had any antipathy to images, while the Gauls
certainly had images of worshipful animals. Further, even if the Druids
were priests of a pre-Celtic folk, they must have permitted the making
of images, since many "menhir-statues" exist on French soil, at Aveyron,
Tarn, and elsewhere. <span id="fr_985"></span>[1](#fn_983.md) The Celts
were in constant contact with image-worshipping peoples, and could
hardly have failed to be influenced by them, even if such a priestly
prohibition existed, just as Israel succumbed to images in spite of
divine commands. That they would have been thus influenced is seen from
the number of images of all kinds dating from the period after the Roman
conquest.

Incidental proofs of the fondness of the Celts for images are found in
ecclesiastical writings and in late survivals. The procession of the
image of Berecynthia has already been described, and such processions
were common in Gaul, and imply a regular folk-custom. S. Martin of Tours
stopped a funeral procession believing it to be such a pagan rite. <span
id="fr_986"></span>[2](#fn_984.md) Councils and edicts prohibited these
processions in Gaul, but a more effectual way was to Christianise them.
The Rogation

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

tide processions with crucifix and Madonna, and the carrying of S.
John's image at the Midsummer festivals, were a direct continuation of
the older practices. Images were often broken by Christian saints in
Gaul, as they had been overturned by S. Patrick in Ireland. "Stiff and
deformed" many of them must have been, if one may judge from the
*Groahgoard*, or "Venus of Quinipily," for centuries the object of
superstitious rites in Brittany. <span id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_985.md)
With it may be compared the fetich-stone or image of which an old woman
in the island of Inniskea, the guardian of a sacred well, had charge. It
was kept wrapped up to hide it from profane eyes, but at certain periods
it was brought out for adoration. <span id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_986.md)

The images and bas-reliefs of the Gallo-Roman period fall mainly into
two classes. In the first class are those representing native
divinities, like Esus, Tarvos Trigaranos, Smertullos, Cernunnos, the
horned and crouching gods, the god with the hammer, and the god with the
wheel. Busts and statues of some water-goddesses exist, but more
numerous are the representations of Epona. One of these is provided with
a box pedestal in which offerings might be placed. The *Matres* are
frequently figured, usually as three seated figures with baskets of
fruit or flowers, or with one or more infants, like the Madonna. Images
of triple-headed gods, supposed to be Cernunnos, have been found, but
are difficult to place in any category. <span
id="fr_989"></span>[3](#fn_987.md)

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

To the images of the second class is usually attached the Roman name of
a god, but generally the native Celtic name is added, but the images
themselves are of the traditional Roman type. Among statues and
statuettes of bronze, that of Mercury occurs most often. This may point
to the fact that Cæsar's *simulacra* of the native Mercury were images,
and that the old preference for representing this god continued in Roman
times. Small figures of divinities in white clay have been found in
large numbers, and may have been *ex votos* or images of household
*lararia*. <span id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_988.md)

### SYMBOLS.

Images of the gods in Gaul can be classified by means of their
symbols--the mallet and cup (a symbol of plenty) borne by the god with
the hammer, the wheel of the sun-god, the cornucopia and torque carried
by Cernunnos. Other symbols occur on images, altars, monuments, and
coins. These are the swastika and triskele, probably symbols of the
sun; <span id="fr_991"></span>[2](#fn_989.md) single or concentric circles,
sometimes with rays; <span id="fr_992"></span>[3](#fn_990.md) crosses; and
a curious **S** figure. The triskele and the circles are sometimes found
on faces figured on coins. They may therefore have been tattoo markings
of a symbolic character. The circle and cross are often incised on
bronze images of Dispater. Much speculation has been aroused by the
**S** figure, which occurs on coins, while nine models of this symbol
hang from a ring carried by the god with the wheel, but the most
probable is that which sees in it a thunderbolt. <span
id="fr_993"></span>[4](#fn_991.md) But lacking any old text interpreting

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

these various symbols, all explanations of them must be conjectural.
Some of them are not purely Celtic, but are of worldwide occurrence.

### CULT OF WEAPONS.

Here some reference may be made to the Celtic cult of weapons. As has
been seen, a hammer is the symbol of one god, and it is not unlikely
that a cult of the hammer had preceded that of the god to whom the
hammer was given as a symbol. Esus is also represented with an axe. We
need not repeat what has already been said regarding the primitive and
universal cult of hammer or axe, <span id="fr_994"></span>[1](#fn_992.md)
but it is interesting to notice, in connection with other evidence for a
Celtic cult of weapons, that there is every reason to believe that the
phrase *sub ascia dedicare*, which occurs in inscriptions on tombs from
Gallia Lugdunensis, usually with the figure of an axe incised on the
stone, points to the cult of the axe, or of a god whose symbol the axe
was. <span id="fr_995"></span>[2](#fn_993.md) In Irish texts the power of
speech is attributed to weapons, but, according to the Christian scribe,
this was because demons spoke from them, for the people worshipped arms
in those days. <span id="fr_996"></span>[3](#fn_994.md) Thus it may have
been believed that spirits tenanted weapons, or that weapons had souls.
Evidence of the cult itself is found in the fact that on Gaulish coins a
sword is figured, stuck in the ground, or driving a chariot, or with a
warrior dancing before it, or held in the hand of a dancing
warrior. <span id="fr_997"></span>[4](#fn_995.md) The latter are ritual
acts, and resemble that described by Spenser as performed by Irish
warriors in his day, who said prayers or incantations before a sword
stuck in the earth. <span id="fr_998"></span>[5](#fn_996.md) Swords were
also addressed in songs composed

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

by Irish bards, and traditional remains of such songs are found in
Brittany. <span id="fr_999"></span>[1](#fn_997.md) They represent the
chants of the ancient cult. Oaths were taken by weapons, and the weapons
were believed to turn against those who lied. <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[2](#fn_998.md) The magical power of weapons,
especially of those over which incantations had been said, is frequently
referred to in traditional tales and Irish texts. <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[3](#fn_999.md) A reminiscence of the cult or of the
magical power of weapons may be found in the wonderful "glaives of
light" of Celtic folk-tales, and the similar mystical weapon of the
Arthurian romances.

argument see Reinach, *RC* xiii. 189 f. Bertrand, *Rev. Arch.* xv. 345,
supports a similar theory, and, according to both writers, Gallo-Roman

image bears part of an inscription. . . . LIT . . ., and it has been
thought that this read ILITHYIA originally. The name is in keeping with
the rites still in use before the image. This would make it, date from
Roman times. if so, it is a poor specimen of the art of the period. But
it may be an old native image to which later the name of the Roman
goddess was given.
