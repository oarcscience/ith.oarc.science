### CHAPTER VII.

# THE CÚCHULAINN CYCLE.

THE events of the Cúchulainn cycle are supposed to date from the
beginning of the Christian era--King Conchobar's death synchronising
with the crucifixion. But though some personages who are mentioned in
the Annals figure in the tales, on the whole they deal with persons who
never existed. They belong to a world of romance and myth, and embody
the ideals of Celtic paganism, modified by Christian influences and
those of classical tales and romantic sagas of other regions, mainly
Scandinavian. The present form of the tales as they exist in the *Book
of the Dun Cow* and the *Book of Leinster* must have been given them in
the seventh or eighth century, but they embody materials of a far older
date. At an early time the saga may have had a more or less definite
form, but new tales were being constantly added to it, and some of the
longer tales are composed of incidents which once had no connection with
each other.

Cúchulainn is the central figure of the cycle, and its central episode
is that of the *Táin bó Cuailgne*, or "Cattle Spoil of Cooley." Other
personages are Conchobar and Dechtire, Ailill and Medb, Fergus, Conall
Cernach, Cúroi, Deirdre, and the sons of Usnach. Some of these are of
divine descent, some are perhaps euhemerised divinities; Conchobar is
called *día talmaide*, "a terrestrial god," and Dechtire a goddess. The
cycle opens with the birth of

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Conchobar, son of Cathbad and of Nessa, daughter
of one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, though in an older rescension of the
tale he is Nessa's son by the god Lug. During Conchobar's reign over
Ulster Cúchulainn was born. He was son of Dechtire, either by Sualtaim,
or by her brother Conchobar, or by the god Lug, of whom he may also be a
reincarnation. <span id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) Like other heroes
of saga, he possesses great strength and skill at a tender age, and,
setting out for Conchobar's court, overpowers the king's "boy corps,"
and then becomes their chief. His next adventure is the slaying of the
watch-dog of Culann the smith, and his appeasing the anger of its owner
by offering to act as his watch-dog. Cathbad now announced that his name
would henceforth be Cú Chulainn, "Culann's hound." <span
id="fr_453"></span>[2](#fn_452.md) At the mature age of seven he obtained
Conchobar's spears, sword, shield, and chariot, and with these he
overcame three mighty champions, returning in the distortion of his
"battle-fury" to Emania. To prevent mischief from his rage, the women
went forth naked to meet him. He modestly covered his eyes, for it was
one of his *geasa* not to look on a woman's breast. Thus taken unawares,
he was plunged into three successive vats of cold water until his
natural appearance was restored to him, although the water boiled and
hissed from his heat. <span id="fr_454"></span>[3](#fn_453.md)

As Cúchulainn grew up, his strength, skill, wisdom, and beauty were
unsurpassed All women fell in love with him, and to forestall a series
of *bonnes fortunes*, the men of Ulster sought a wife for him. But the
hero's heart was set on Emer, daughter of Forgall,, whom he wooed in a
strange language which none but she could understand. At last she
consented to be his

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

wife if he would slay a number of warriors. Forgall was opposed to the
match, and with a view to Cúchulainn's destruction suggested that he
should go to Donall in Alba to increase his skill, and to Scathach if he
would excel all other warriors. He agreed, provided that Forgall would
give him whatever he asked for on his return. Arrived in Alba, he
refused the love of Donall's daughter, Dornolla, who swore to be
avenged. Thence he went to Scathach, overcoming all the dangers of the
way, leaping in safety the gulf surrounding her island, after essaying
in vain to cross a narrow, swinging bridge. From Scathach he learned
supreme skill in arms, and overcame her Amazonian rival Aife. He begat a
son by Aife, and. instructed her to call him Conla, to give him his
father's ring, to send him to seek Cúchulainn, and to forbid him to
reveal his name. In the sequel, Cúchulainn, unaware that Conla was his
son, slew him in single combat, too late discovering his identity from
the ring which he wore. This is the well-known saga formula of Sohrab
and Rustum, of Theseus and Hippolytus. On his return from Scathach's
isle Cúchulainn destroyed Forgall's *rath* with many of its inmates,
including Forgall, and carried off Emer. To the ten years which
followed, during which he was the great champion of Ulster, belong many
tales in which he figures prominently. One of these is *The Debility of
the Ultonians*. This was caused by Macha, who, during her pregnancy,
was, forced to run a race with Conchobar's horses. She outran them, but
gave birth immediately to twins, and, in her pangs, cursed the men of
Ulster, with a curse that, in time of oppression, they would be overcome
with the weakness of childbirth. From this Cúchulainn was exempt, for he
was not of Ulster, but a son of Lug. <span
id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_454.md) Various attempts have been

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

made to explain this "debility." It may be a myth explaining a Celtic
use of the "couvade," though no example of a simultaneous tribal couvade
is known, unless we have here an instance of Westermarck's "human
pairing season in primitive times," with its consequent simultaneous
birth-period for women and couvade for men. <span
id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_455.md) Others, with less likelihood, explain it
as a period of tabu, with cessation from work and warfare, at a funeral
or festival. <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_456.md) In any case Macha's
curse is a myth explanatory of the origin of some existing custom, the
duration of which is much exaggerated by the narrator. To this period
belong also the tale of Cúchulainn's visit to Elysium, and others to be
referred to later. Another story describes his attack upon Morrigan
because she would neither yield up the cows which she was driving away
nor tell her true name--an instance of the well-known name tabu.
Morrigan took the form of a bird, and was then recognised by Cúchulainn,
who poured scorn upon her, while she promised to oppose him during the
fight of the *Táin* in the forms of an eel, a wolf, and a cow, all of
which he vowed to destroy. <span id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_457.md) Like
many others in the saga, this story is introductory to the main episode
of the *Táin*. To this we now turn.

Medb had been wife of Conchobar, but, leaving him, had married in
succession two chiefs called Ailill, the second of whom had a bull,
Findbennach, the White-horned, which she resolved to match by one in
every way its equal. Having been refused the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, she
summoned all her forces to invade Ulster. The moment was inauspicious
for Ulster, for all its men were suffering from their "debility."
Cúchulainn, therefore, went out to encounter the host, and forced Medb
to agree that a succession of her warriors should

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

engage him in single combat. Among these was his old friend Ferdia, and
nothing is so touching as his reluctance to fight him, or so pathetic as
his grief when Ferdia falls. The reluctance is primarily due to the tie
of blood-brotherhood existing between them. Finally, the Ulstermen rose
in force and defeated Medb, but not before she had already captured the
bull and sent it into her own land. There it was fought by the
Findbennach and slew it, rushing back to Ulster with the mangled body on
its horns. But in its frenzy a rock seemed to be another bull, which it
charged; its brains were dashed out, and it fell dead.

The Morrigan had warned the bull of the approach of Medb's army, and she
had also appeared in the form of a beautiful woman to Cúchulainn
offering him her love, only to be repulsed. Hence she turned against
him, and described how she would oppose him as an eel, a wolf, and a red
heifer--an incident which is probably a variant of that already
described. <span id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_458.md) In each of these shapes
she was conquered and wounded by the hero, and knowing that none whom he
hurt could be healed save by himself, she appeared to him as an old
crone milking a cow. At each draught of the milk which he received from
her he blessed her with "the blessing of gods and not-gods," and so her
wounds were healed. <span id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_459.md) For this, at a
later time, she tried to ward off his death, but unsuccessfully. During
the progress of the *Táin*, one of Cúchulainn's "fairy kinsmen," namely,
Lug, who announced himself as his father, appeared to aid him, while
others of the Tuatha Dea threw "herbs of healing" into the streams in
which his wounds were washed. <span id="fr_461"></span>[3](#fn_460.md)

During the *Táin*, Cúchulainn slaughtered the wizard Calatin and his
daughters. But Calatin's wife bore three

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

posthumous sons and three daughters, and through their means the hero
was at last slain. Everything was done to keep him back from the host
which now advanced against Ulster, but finally one of Calatin's
daughters took the form of Niamh and bade him go forth. As he passed to
the fight, Calatin's daughters persuaded him to eat the flesh of a
dog--a fatal deed, for it was one of his *geasa* never to eat dog's
flesh. So it was that in the fight he was slain by Lugaid, <span
id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_461.md) and his soul appeared to the thrice
fifty queens who had loved him, chanting a mystic song of the coming of
Christ and the day of doom--an interesting example of a phantasm
coincidental with death. <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_462.md) This and
other Christian touches show that the Christian redactors of the saga
felt tenderly towards the old pagan hero. This is even more marked in
the story in which he appears to King Loegaire and S. Patrick, begging
the former to believe in God and the saint, and praying Patrick to
"bring me with thy faithful ones unto the land of the living." <span
id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_463.md) A similar Christianising appears in the
story of Conchobar's death, the result of his mad frenzy on bearing from
his Druid that an earthquake is the result of the shameful crucifixion
of Christ. <span id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_464.md)

In the saga, Cúchulainn appears as the ideal Celtic warrior, but, like
other ideal warriors, he is a "magnified, non-natural man," many of his
deeds being merely exaggerations of those common among barbaric folk.
Even his "distortion" or battle frenzy is but a magnifying of the wild
frenzy of all wild fighters. To the person of this ideal warrior, some
of whose traits may have been derived from traditional stories of actual
heroes, *Märchen* and saga episodes attached themselves. Of every ideal
hero, Celtic, Greek, Babylonian, or

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Polynesian, certain things are told--his
phenomenal strength as a child; his victory over enormous forces; his
visits to the Other-world; his amours with a goddess; his divine
descent. These belong to the common stock of folk-tale episodes, and
accumulate round every great name. Hence, save in the colouring given to
them or the use made of them by any race, they do not afford a key to
the mythic character of the hero. Such deeds are ascribed to Cúchulainn,
as they doubtless were to the ideal heroes of the "undivided Aryans,"
but though parallels may be found between him and the Greek Heracles,
they might just as easily be found in non-Aryan regions, *e.g.* in
Polynesia. Thus the parallels between Cúchulainn and Heracles throw
little light on the personality of the former, though here and there in
such parallels we observe a peculiarly Celtic touch. Thus, while the
Greek hero rescues Hesione from a dragon, it is from three Fomorians
that Cúchulainn rescues Devorgilla, namely, from beings to whom actual
human sacrifice was paid. Thus a *Märchen* formula of world-wide
existence has been moulded by Celtic religious belief and ritual
practice. <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_465.md)

It was inevitable that the " mythological school " should regard
Cúchulainn as a solar hero. Thus "he reaches his full development at an
unusually early age," as the sun does, <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_466.md) but also as do many other heroes of saga
and *Märchen* who are not solar. The three colours of Cúchulainn's hair,
dark near the skin, red in the middle, golden near the top, are claimed
to be a description of the sun's rays, or of the three parts into which
the Celts divided the day. <span id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_467.md)
Elsewhere his tresses are yellow, like Prince Charlie's in fact and in
song, yet be was not a solar hero. Again, the seven pupils of his eyes
perhaps

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

referred to the days of the week." <span id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_468.md)
Blindness befell all women who loved him, a reference to the difficulty
of gazing at the sun. <span id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_469.md) This is
prosaic! The blindness was a compliment paid to Cúchulainn the blind, by
women who made themselves blind while talking to him, just as Conall
Cernach's mistresses squinted as he did. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_470.md) Cúchulainn's blindness arose from his
habit of sinking one eye into his head and protruding the other--a
well-known solar trait! His "distortion," during which, besides this
"blindness," blood shot upwards from his head and formed a magic mist,
and his anger caused showers of sparks to mount above him, points to
dawn or sunset, <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_471.md) though the setting
sun would rather suggest a hero sinking calmly to rest than a mad giant
setting out to slaughter friend and foe. The "distortion," as already
pointed out, is the exaggerated description of the mad warrior rage,
just as the fear which produced death to those who saw him brandish his
weapons, was also produced by Maori warrior methods. <span
id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_472.md) Lug, who may be a sun-god, has no such
"distortion." The cooling of the hero in three vats, the waters of which
boil over, and his emergence from them pinky red in colour, symbolise
the sun sinking into the waters and reappearing at dawn. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[6](#fn_473.md) Might it not describe in an exaggerated
way the refreshing bath taken by frenzied warriors, the water being
supposed to grow warm from the heat of their bodies? <span
id="fr_475"></span>[7](#fn_474.md) One of the hero's *geasa* was not to see
Manannan's horses, the waves; which, being interpreted, means that the
sun is near its death as it approaches the sea. Yet Lug, a sun-god,
rides

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

the steed Enbarr, a personification of the waves, while Cúchulainn
himself often crossed the sea, and also lived with the sea-god's wife,
Fand, without coming to grief. Again, the magic horses which he drives,
black and grey in colour, are "symbols of day and night," <span
id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) though it is not obvious why a grey
horse should symbolise day, which is not always grey even in the isles
of the west. Unlike a solar hero, too, Cúchulainn is most active in
winter, and rests for a brief space from slaughtering at midday--the
time of the sun's greatest activity both in summer and winter.

Another theory is that every visit of the hero to a strange land
signifies a descent to Hades, suggested by the sun sinking in the west.
Scathach's island may be Hades, but it is more probably Elysium with
some traits borrowed from the Christian idea of hell. But Emer's land,
also visited by Cúchulainn, suggests neither Hades nor Elysium. Emer
calls herself *ingen rig richis garta*, translated by Professor Rhŷs as
"daughter of the coal-faced king," *i.e.* she is daughter of darkness.
Hence she is a dawn-maiden and becomes the sun-hero's wife. <span
id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) There is nothing in the story to
corroborate this theory, apart from the fact that it is not clear, even
to the hypothetical primitive mind, why dawn and sun should be a divine
pair. Emer's words probably mean that she is "daughter of a king" and "a
flame of hospitality" (*richis garta*). <span
id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_477.md) Cúchulainn, in visiting her, went from
west to east, contrary to the apparent course of the sun. The
extravagance of the solar theory is further seen in the hypothesis that
because Cúchulainn has other wives, the sun-god made love to as many
dawn-maidens as there are days in the year, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[4](#fn_478.md) like

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the king in Louys' romance with his 366 wives, one for each day of the
year, leap-year included.

Further examples of the solar theory need not be cited. It is enough to
see in Cúchulainn the ideal warrior, whose traits are bombastic and
obscure exaggerations of actual custom and warfare, or are borrowed from
folk-tale *motifs* not exclusively Celtic. Possibly he may have been a
war-god, since he is associated with Badb <span
id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_479.md) and also with Morrigan. But he has also
some traits of a culture hero. He claims superiority in wisdom, in law,
in politics, in the art of the *Filid*, and in Druidism, while he brings
various things from the world of the gods. <span
id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_480.md) In any case the Celts paid divine
honours to heroes, living or dead, <span id="fr_482"></span>[3](#fn_481.md)
and Cúchulainn, god or ideal hero, may have been the subject of a cult.
This lends point to the theory of M. D'Arbois that Cúchulainn and Conall
Cernach are the equivalents of Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, said by
Diodorus to be worshipped among the Celts near the Ocean. <span
id="fr_483"></span>[4](#fn_482.md) Cúchulainn, like Pollux, was son of a
god, and was nursed, according to some accounts, by Findchoém, mother of
Conall, <span id="fr_484"></span>[5](#fn_483.md) just as Leda was mother of
Castor as well as of Pollux. But, on the other hand, Cúchulainn, unlike
Pollux, was mortal. M. D'Arbois then identifies the two pairs of heroes
with certain figures on an altar at Cluny. These are Castor and Pollux;
Cernunnos and Smertullos. He equates Castor with Cernunnos, and Pollux
with Smertullos. Smertullos is Cúchulainn, and the name is explained
from an incident in the *Táin*, in which the hero, reproached for his
youth, puts on a false beard before attacking Morrigan in her form as an
eel. This is expressed by *smérthain*, "to attach," and is thus
connected with and gave rise to the name Smertullos. On the altar
Smertullos is attacking an eel or serpent. Hence Pollux is

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Smertullos-Cúchulainn. <span
id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_484.md) Again, the name Cernunnos signifies "the
horned one," from *cernu*, "horn," a word found in Conall's epithet
Cernach. But this was not given him because he was horned, but because
of the angular shape of his head, the angle (*cern*) being the result of
a blow. <span id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_485.md) The epithet may mean
"victorious." <span id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_486.md) On the whole, the
theory is more ingenious than convincing, and we have no proof that the
figures of Castor and Pollux on the altar were duplicates of the Celtic
pair. Cernunnos was an underworld god, and Conall has no trace of such a
character.

M. D'Arbois also traces the saga in Gaul in the fact that on the menhir
of Kervadel Mercury is figured with a child, Mercury, in his opinion,
being Lug, and the child Cúchulainn. <span
id="fr_488"></span>[4](#fn_487) On another altar are depicted (1.md) a
woodman, Esus, cutting down a tree, and (2) a bull on which are perched
three birds--Tarvos Trigaranos. The two subjects, as M. Reinach points
out, are combined on another altar at Trèves, on which a woodman is
cutting down a tree in which are perched three birds, while a bull's
bead appears in the branches. <span id="fr_489"></span>[5](#fn_488.md)
These represent, according to M. D'Arbois, incidents of the *Táin*--the
cutting down of trees by Cúchulainn and placing them in the way of his
enemies, and the warning of the bull by Morrigan in the bird form which
she shared with her sisters Badb and Macha. <span
id="fr_490"></span>[6](#fn_489.md) Why, then, is Cúchulainn called Esus?
"Esus" comes from a root which gives words meaning "rapid motion,"
"anger," "strength"--all shown by the hero. <span
id="fr_491"></span>[7](#fn_490.md) The altars were found in the land of the
Belgic Treveri, and some Belgic tribes may have passed into Britain and
Ireland carrying the Esus-Cúchulainn legend there in the second century

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

\[paragraph continues\] B.C., *e.g.* the Setantii, dwelling by the
Mersey, and bearing a name similar to that of the hero in his
childhood--Setanta (*Setantios*), as well as the Menapii and Brigantes,
located in Ireland by Ptolemy. <span id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) In
other words, the divine Esus, with his surname Smertullos, was called in
Ireland Setanta, after the Setantii, and at a later date, Cúchulainn.
The princely name Donnotaurus resembles *Dond tarb*, the "Brown Bull" of
the saga, and also suggests its presence in Gaul, while the name
Δηιόταρος, perhaps the equivalent of *Deûio-taruos*, "Divine Bull," is
found in Galatia. <span id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_492.md) Thus the main
elements of the saga may have been known to the continental Celts before
it was localised in Ireland, <span id="fr_494"></span>[3](#fn_493.md) and,
it may be added, if it was brought there by Gallo-British tribes, this
might account for the greater popularity of the native, possibly
pre-Celtic, Fionn saga among the folk, as well as for the finer literary
quality of the Cúchulainn saga. But the identification of Esus with
Cúchulainn rests on slight grounds; the names Esus and Smertullos are
not found in Ireland, and the Gaulish Esus, worshipped with human
sacrifice, has little affinity with the hero, unless his deeds of
slaughter are reminiscent of' such rites. It is possible, however, that
the episode of the *Táin* came from a myth explaining ritual acts. This
myth may have been the subject of the bas-reliefs, carried to Ireland,
and there worked into the saga.

The folk-versions of the saga, though resembling the literary versions,
are less elaborate and generally wilder, and perhaps represent its
primitive form. <span id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_494.md) The greatest
differences are found in versions of the *Táin* and of Cúchulainn's
death,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

which, separate in the saga, are parts of one folk-tale, the death
occurring during the fighting over the bull. The bull is his property,
and Medb sends Garbh mac Stairn to take it from him. He pretends to be a
child, goes to bed, and tricks Garbh, who goes off to get the bull.
Cúchulainn arrives before him and personates the herdsman. Each seizes a
horn, and the bull is torn in two. <span id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_495.md)
Does this represent the primitive form of the *Táin*, and, further, were
the bull and Cúchulainn once one and the same--a bull, the incarnation
of a god or vegetation spirit, being later made anthropomorphic--a
hero-god whose property or symbol was a bull? Instances of this process
are not unknown among the Celts. <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_496.md)
In India, Indra was a bull and a divine youth, in Greece there was the
bull-Dionysos, and among the Celts the name of the divine bull was borne
by kings. <span id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_497.md) In the saga Morrigan is
friendly to the bull, but fights for Medb; but she is now friendly, now
hostile to Cúchulainn, finally, however, trying to avert his doom. If he
had once been the bull, her friendliness would not be quite forgotten,
once he became human and separate from the bull. When she first met
Cúchulainn she had a cow on whom the Brown Bull was to beget a calf, and
she told the hero that "So long as the calf which is in this cow's body
is a yearling, it is up to that time that thou art in life; and it is
this that will lead to the *Táin*." <span
id="fr_499"></span>[4](#fn_498.md) This suggests that the hero was to die
in the battle, but it shows that the Brown Bull's calf is bound up with
his life. The Bull was a reincarnation of a divine swineherd,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

and if, as in the case of Cúchulainn, "his rebirth could only be of
himself," <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_499.md) the calf was simply a
duplicate of the bull, and, as it was bound up with the hero's life,
bull and hero may well have been one. The life or soul was in the calf,
and, as in all such cases, the owner of the soul and that in which it is
hidden are practically identical. Cúchulainn's "distortion" might then
be explained as representing the bull's fury in fight, and the
folk-tales would be popular forms of an old myth explaining ritual in
which a bull, the incarnation of a tree or vegetation spirit, was slain,
and the sacred tree cut down and consumed, as in Celtic agricultural
ritual. This would be the myth represented on the bas-reliefs, and in
the ritual the bull would be slain, rent, and eaten by his worshippers.
Why, then, should Cúchulainn rend the bull? In the later stages of such
rites the animal was slain, not so much as a divine incarnation as a
sacrifice to the god once incarnated in him. And when a god was thus
separated from his animal form, myths often arose telling how be himself
had slain the animal. <span id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_500.md) In the case
of Cúchulainn and the bull, the god represented by the bull became
separate from it, became anthropomorphic, and in that form was
associated with or actually was the hero Cúchulainn. Bull sacrifices
were common among the Celts with whom the bull had been a divine
animal. <span id="fr_502"></span>[3](#fn_501.md) Possibly a further echo of
this myth and ritual is to be found in the folk-belief that S. Martin
was cut up and eaten in the form of an ox--the god incarnate in the
animal being associated with a saint. <span
id="fr_503"></span>[4](#fn_502.md) Thus the literary versions of the
*Táin*, departing from the hypothetical primitive versions, kept the
bull as the central figure, but introduced a rival bull, and described
its death differently, while both bulls are said to be reincarnations of
divine swine-herds. <span id="fr_504"></span>[5](#fn_503.md) The idea of a
fight

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

for a bull is borrowed from actual custom, and thus the old form of the
story was further distorted.

The Cúchulainn saga is more coherent than the Fionn saga, because it
possesses one central incident. The "canon" of the saga was closed at an
early date, while that of Fionn has practically never been closed,
mainly because it has been more a saga of the folk than that of
Cúchulainn. In some respects the two may have been rivals, for if the
Cúchulainn saga was introduced by conquerors from Britain or Gaul, it
would not be looked on with favour by the folk. Or if it is the saga of
Ulster as opposed to that of Leinster, rivalry would again ensue. The
Fionn saga lives more in the hearts of the people, though it sometimes
borrows from the other. This borrowing, however, is less than some
critics, *e.g.* Zimmer, maintain. Many of the likenesses are the result
of the fact that wherever a hero exists a common stock of incidents
becomes his. Hence there is much similarity in all sagas wherever found.

This, with the epithets applied to heroes in the *Triads*,
"bull-phantom," "prince bull of combat" (Loth, ii. 232, 243), may be an
appellative denoting great strength.
