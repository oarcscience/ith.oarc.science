### CHAPTER IV.

# THE IRISH MYTHOLOGICAL CYCLE.

THREE divine and heroic cycles of myths are known in Ireland, one
telling of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the others of Cúchulainn and of the
Fians. They are distinct in character and contents, but the gods of the
first cycle often help the heroes of the other groups, as the gods of
Greece and India assisted the heroes of the epics. We shall see that
some of the personages of these cycles may have been known in Gaul; they
are remembered in Wales, but, in the Highlands, where stories of
Cúchulainn and Fionn are still told, the Tuatha Dé Danann are less known
now than in 1567, when Bishop Carsewell lamented the love of the
Highlanders for "idle, turbulent, lying, worldly stories concerning the
Tuatha Dédanans." <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md)

As the new Achæan religion in Greece and the Vedic sacred books of India
regarded the aboriginal gods and heroes as demons and goblins, so did
Christianity in Ireland sometimes speak of the older gods there. On the
other hand, it was mainly Christian scribes who changed the old
mythology into history, and made the gods and heroes kings. Doubtless
myths already existed, telling of the descent of rulers and people from
divinities, just as the Gauls spoke of their

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

descent from Dispater, or as the Incas of Peru, the Mikados of Japan,
and the kings of Uganda considered themselves offspring of the gods.
This is a universal practice, and made it the more easy for Christian
chroniclers to transmute myth into history. In Ireland, as elsewhere,
myth doubtless told of monstrous races inhabiting the land in earlier
days, of the strife of the aborigines and incomers, and of their gods,
though the aboriginal gods may in some cases have been identified with
Celtic gods, or worshipped in their own persons. Many mythical elements
may therefore be looked for in the euhemerised chronicles of ancient
Ireland. But the chroniclers themselves were but the continuers of a
process which must have been at work as soon as the influence of
Christianity began to be felt. <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md)
Their passion, however, was to show the descent of the Irish and the
older peoples from the old Biblical personages, a process dear to the
modern Anglo-Israelite, some of whose arguments are based on the wild
romancing of the chroniclers.

Various stories were told of the first peopling of Ireland. Banba, with
two other daughters of Cain, arrived with fifty women and three men,
only to die of the plague. Three fishermen next discovered Ireland, and
"of the island of Banba of Fair Women with hardihood they took
possession." Having gone to fetch their wives, they perished in the
deluge at Tuath Inba. <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md) A more
popular account was that of the coming of Cessair, Noah's granddaughter,
with her father, husband, a third man, Ladru, "the first dead man of
Erin," and fifty damsels. Her coming was the result of the advice of a
*laimh-dhia*, or "hand-god," but their ship was wrecked, and all save
her husband, Finntain, who survived for centuries, perished

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

in the flood. <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md) Cessair's ship was
less serviceable than her grandparent's! Followed the race of Partholan,
"no wiser one than the other," who increased on the land until plague
swept them away, with the exception of Tuan mac Caraill, who, after many
transformations, told the story of Ireland to S. Finnen centuries
after. <span id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) The survival of Finntain
and Tuan, doubles of each other, was an invention of the chroniclers, to
explain the survival of the history of colonists who had all perished.
Keating, on the other hand, rejecting the sole survivor theory as
contradictory to Scripture, suggests that "aerial demons," followers of
the invaders, revealed all to the chroniclers, unless indeed they found
it engraved with "an iron pen and lead in the rocks." <span
id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md)

Two hundred years before Partholan's coming, the Fomorians had
arrived, <span id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_158.md) and they and their chief
Cichol Gricenchos fought Partholan at Mag Itha, where they were
defeated. Cichol was footless, and some of his host had but one arm and
one leg. <span id="fr_159"></span>[5](#fn_159.md) They were demons,
according to the chroniclers, and descendants of the luckless Ham.
Nennius makes Partholan and his men the first Scots who came from Spain
to Ireland. The next arrivals were the people of Nemed who returned to
Spain, whence they came (Nennius), or died to a man (Tuan). They also
were descendants of the inevitable Noah, and their sojourn in Ireland
was much disturbed by the Fomorians who had recovered from their defeat,
and finally overpowered the Nemedians after the death of Nemed. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[6](#fn_160.md) From Tory Island the Fomorians ruled
Ireland, and forced the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Nemedians to pay them annually on the eve of
Samhain (Nov. 1st) two-thirds of their corn and milk and of the children
born during the year. If the Fomorians are gods of darkness, or,
preferably, aboriginal deities, the tribute must be explained as a dim
memory of sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter when the powers
of darkness and blight are in the ascendant. The Fomorians had a tower
of glass in Tory Island. This was one day seen by the Milesians, to whom
appeared on its battlements what seemed to be men. A year after they
attacked the tower and were overwhelmed in the sea. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) From the survivors of a previously
wrecked vessel of their fleet are descended the Irish. Another version
makes the Nemedians the assailants. Thirty of them survived their
defeat, some of them going to Scotland or Man (the Britons), some to
Greece (to return as the Firbolgs), some to the north, where they
learned magic and returned as the Tuatha Dé Danann. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md) The Firbolgs, "men of bags," resenting
their ignominious treatment by the Greeks, escaped to Ireland. They
included the Firbolgs proper, the Fir-Domnann, and the Galioin. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_163.md) The Fomorians are called their gods, and
this, with the contemptuous epithets bestowed on them, may point to the
fact that the Firbolgs were the pre-Celtic folk of Ireland and the
Fomorians their divinities, hostile to the gods of the Celts or regarded
as dark deities. The Firbolgs are vassals of Ailill and Medb, and with
the Fir Domnann and Galioin are hostile to Cúchulainn and his men, <span
id="fr_164"></span>[4](#fn_164.md) just as Fomorians were to the Tuatha Dé
Danann. The strifes of races and of their gods are inextricably
confused.

The Tuatha Dé Danann arrived from heaven--an idea in keeping with their
character as beneficent gods, but later legend told how they came from
the north. They reached

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ireland on Beltane, shrouded in a magic mist,
and finally, after one or, in other accounts, two battles, defeated the
Firbolgs and Fomorians at Magtured. The older story of one battle may be
regarded as a euhemerised account of the seeming conflict of nature
powers. <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) The first battle is
described in a fifteenth to sixteenth century MS., <span
id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_166.md) and is referred to in a fifteenth
century account of the second battle, full of archaic reminiscences, and
composed from various earlier documents. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_167.md) The Firbolgs, defeated in the first
battle, join the Fomorians, after great losses. Meanwhile Nuada, leader
of the Tuatha Dé Danann, lost his hand, and as no king with a blemish
could sit on the throne, the crown was given to Bres, son of the
Fomorian Elatha and his sister Eri, a woman of the Tuatha Dé Danann. One
day Eri espied a silver boat speeding to her across the sea. From it
stepped forth a magnificent hero, and without delay the pair, like the
lovers in Theocritus, "rejoiced in their wedlock." The hero, Elatha,
foretold the birth of Eri's son, so beautiful that he would be a
standard by which to try all beautiful things. He gave her his ring, but
she was to part with it only to one whose finger it should fit. This was
her child Bres, and by this token he was later, as an exile, recognised
by his father, and obtained his help against the Tuatha Dé Danann. Like
other wonderful children, Bres grew twice as quickly as any other child
until he was seven. <span id="fr_168"></span>[4](#fn_168.md) Though Elatha
and Eri are brother and sister, she is among the Tuatha Dé Danann. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[5](#fn_169.md) There is the usual inconsistency of myth
here and in other accounts of Fomorian and Tuatha Dé Danann unions. The
latter had just landed, but already had united in marriage with the
Fomorians. This inconsistency

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

escaped the chroniclers, but it points to the fact that both were divine
not human, and that, though in conflict, they united in marriage as
members of hostile tribes often do.

The second battle took place twenty-seven years after the first, on
Samhain. It was fought like the first on the plain of Mag-tured, though
later accounts made one battle take place at Mag-tured in Mayo, the
other at Mag-tured in Sligo. <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md)
Inconsistently, the conquering Tuatha Dé Danann in the interval, while
Bres is their king, must pay tribute imposed by the Fomorians. Obviously
in older accounts this tribute must have been imposed before the first
battle and have been its cause. But why should gods, like the Tuatha Dé
Danann, ever have been in subjection? This remains to be seen, but the
answer probably lies in parallel myths of the subjection or death of
divinities like Ishtar, Adonis, Persephone, and Osiris. Bres having
exacted a tribute of the milk of all hornless dun cows, the cows of
Ireland were passed through fire and smeared with ashes--a myth based
perhaps on the Beltane fire ritual. <span
id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) The avaricious Bres was satirised, and
"nought but decay was on him from that hour" <span
id="fr_172"></span>[3](#fn_172.md) and when Nuada, having recovered,
claimed the throne, he went to collect an army of the Fomorians, who
assembled against the Tuatha Dé Danann. In the battle Indech wounded
Ogma, and Balor slew Nuada, but was mortally wounded by Lug. Thereupon
the Fomorians fled to their own region.

The Tuatha Dé Danann remained masters of Ireland until the coming of the
Milesians, so named from an eponymous Mile, son of Bile. Ith, having
been sent to reconnoitre, was slain, and the Milesians now invaded
Ireland in force. In spite of a mist raised by the Druids, they landed,
and, having met the three princes who slew Ith, demanded instant battle
or surrender of the land. The princes agreed to abide by

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

the decision of the Milesian poet Amairgen, who bade his friends
re-embark and retire for the distance of nine waves. If they could then
effect a landing, Ireland was theirs. A magic storm was raised, which
wrecked many of their ships, but Amairgen recited verses, fragments,
perhaps, of some old ritual, and overcame the dangers. After their
defeat the survivors of the Tuatha Dé Danann retired into the hills to
become a fairy folk, and the Milesians (the Goidels or Scots) became
ancestors of the Irish.

Throughout the long story of the conquests of Ireland there are many
reduplications, the same incidents being often ascribed to different
personages. <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) Different versions of
similar occurrences, based on older myths and traditions, may already
have been in existence, and ritual practices, dimly remembered, required
explanation. In the hands of the chroniclers, writing history with a
purpose and combining their information with little regard to
consistency, all this was reduced to a more or less connected narrative.
At the hands of the prosaic chroniclers divinity passed from the gods,
though traces of it still linger.

"Ye are gods, and, behold, ye shall die, and the waves be upon you at
last.  
In the darkness of time, in the deeps of the years, in the changes of
things,  
Ye shall sleep as a slain man sleeps, and the world shall forget you for
kings."

From the annalistic point of view the Fomorians are sea demons or
pirates, their name being derived from *muir*, "sea," while they are
descended along with other monstrous beings from them. Professor Rhŷs,
while connecting the name with Welsh *foawr*, "giant" (Gaelic
*famhair*), derives the name

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

from *fo*, "under," and *muir*, and regards them as submarine
beings. <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) Dr. MacBain connected them
with the fierce powers of the western sea personified, like the
*Muireartach*, a kind of sea hag, of a Fionn ballad. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_175.md) But this association of the Fomorians
with the ocean may be the result of a late folk-etymology, which wrongly
derived their name from *muir*. The Celtic experience of the Lochlanners
or Norsemen, with whom the Fomorians are associated, <span
id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_176.md) would aid the conception of them as
sea-pirates of a more or less demoniacal character. Dr. Stokes connects
the second syllable *mor* with mare in "nightmare," from *moro*, and
regards them as subterranean as well as submarine. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[4](#fn_177.md) But the more probable derivation is that
of Zimmer and D'Arbois, from *fo* and *morio* (*mor*, "great "), <span
id="fr_178"></span>[5](#fn_178.md) which would thus agree with the
tradition which regarded them as giants. They were probably beneficent
gods of the aborigines, whom the Celtic conquerors regarded as generally
evil, perhaps equating them with the dark powers already known to them.
They were still remembered as gods, and are called "champions of the
*síd*," like the Tuatha Dé Danann. <span id="fr_179"></span>[6](#fn_179.md)
Thus King Bres sought to save his life by promising that the kine of
Ireland would always be in milk, then that the men of Ireland would reap
every quarter, and finally by revealing the lucky days for ploughing,
sowing, and reaping. <span id="fr_180"></span>[7](#fn_180.md) Only an
autochthonous god could know this, and the story is suggestive of the
true nature of the Fomorians. The hostile character attributed to them
is seen from the fact that they destroyed corn, milk, and fruit. But in
Ireland, as elsewhere, this destructive power was deprecated by begging
them not to destroy "corn nor milk in Erin beyond their fair
tribute." <span id="fr_181"></span>[8](#fn_181.md) Tribute was also paid to
them on Samhain, the time when

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the powers of blight feared by men are in the ascendant. Again, the
kingdom of Balor, their chief, is still described as the kingdom of
cold. <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) But when we remember that a
similar "tribute" was paid to Cromm Cruaich, a god of fertility, and
that after the conquest of the Tuatha Dé Danann they also were regarded
as hostile to agriculture, <span id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) we
realise that the Fomorians must have been aboriginal gods of fertility
whom the conquering Celts regarded as hostile to them and their gods.
Similarly, in folk-belief the beneficent corn-spirit has sometimes a
sinister and destructive aspect. <span id="fr_184"></span>[3](#fn_184.md)
Thus the stories of "tribute" would be distorted reminiscences of the
ritual of gods of the soil, differing little in character from that of
the similar Celtic divinities. What makes it certain that the Fomorians
were aboriginal gods is that they are found in Ireland before the coming
of the early colonist Partholan. They were the gods of the pre-Celtic
folk--Firbolgs, Fir Domnann, and Galioin <span
id="fr_185"></span>[4](#fn_185.md)--all of them in Ireland before the
Tuatha Dé [Danann](errata.htm#1.md) arrived, and all of them regarded as
slaves, spoken of with the utmost contempt. Another possibility,
however, ought to be considered. As the Celtic gods were local in
character, and as groups of tribes would frequently be hostile to other
groups, the Fomorians may have been local gods of a group at enmity with
another group, worshipping the Tuatha Dé [Danann](errata.htm#2.md).

The strife of Fomorians and Tuatha Dé Danann suggests the dualism of all
nature religions. Demons or giants or monsters strive with gods in
Hindu, Greek, and Teutonic

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

mythology, and in Persia the primitive dualism of beneficent and hurtful
powers of nature became an ethical dualism--the eternal opposition of
good and evil. The sun is vanquished by cloud and storm, but shines
forth again in vigour. Vegetation dies, but undergoes a yearly renewal.
So in myth the immortal gods are wounded and slain in strife. But we
must not push too far the analogy of the apparent strife of the elements
and the wars of the gods. The one suggested the other, especially where
the gods were elemental powers. But myth-making man easily developed the
suggestion; gods were like men and "could never get eneuch o' fechtin'."
The Celts knew of divine combats before their arrival in Ireland, and
their own hostile powers were easily assimilated to the hostile gods of
the aborigines.

The principal Fomorians are described as kings. Elatha was son of Nét,
described by Cormac as "a battle god of the heathen Gael," *i.e.* he is
one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, and has as wives two war-goddesses, Badb
and Nemaind. <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) Thus he resembles the
Fomorian Tethra whose wife is a *badb* or "battle-crow," preying on the
slain. <span id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187.md) Elatha's name, connected
with words meaning "knowledge," suggests that he was an aboriginal
culture-god. <span id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_188.md) In the genealogies,
Fomorians and Tuatha Dé Danann are inextricably mingled. Bres's
temporary position as king of the Tuatha Déa may reflect some myth of
the occasional supremacy of the powers of blight. Want and niggardliness
characterise his reign, and after his defeat a better state of things
prevails. Bres's consort was Brigit, and their son Ruadan, sent to spy
on the Tuatha Dé Danann, was slain. His mother's wailing for him was the
first mourning wail ever heard in Erin. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[4](#fn_189.md) Another god, Indech,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

was son of Déa Domnu, a Fomorian goddess of the deep, *i.e.* of the
underworld and probably also of fertility, who may hold a position among
the Fomorians similar to that of Danu among the Tuatha Dé Danann. Indech
was slain by Ogma, who himself died of wounds received from his
adversary.

Balor had a consort Cethlenn, whose venom killed Dagda. His one eye had
become evil by contact with the poisonous fumes of a concoction which
his father's Druids were preparing. The eyelid required four men to
raise it, when his evil eye destroyed all on whom its glance fell. In
this way Balor would have slain Lug at Mag-tured, but the god at once
struck the eye with a sling-stone and slew him. <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_190.md) Balor, like the Greek Medusa, is perhaps
a personification of the evil eye, so much feared by the Celts.
Healthful influences and magical charms avert it; hence Lug, a
beneficent god, destroys Balor's maleficence.

Tethra, with Balor and Elatha, ruled over Erin at the coming of the
Tuatha Dé Danann. From a phrase used in the story of Connla's visit to
Elysium, "Thou art a hero of the men of Tethra," M. D'Arbois assumes
that Tethra was ruler of Elysium, which he makes one with the land of
the dead. The passage, however, bears a different interpretation, and
though a Fomorian, Tethra, a god of war, might be regarded as lord of
all warriors. <span id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_191.md) Elysium was not the
land of the dead, and when M. D'Arbois equates Tethra with Kronos, who
after his defeat became ruler of a land of dead heroes, the analogy,
like other analogies with Greek mythology, is misleading. He also
equates Bres, as temporary king of the Tuatha Dé Danann, with Kronos,
king of heaven in the age of gold. Kronos, again, slain by Zeus, is
parallel to Balor slain by his grandson Lug Tethra, Bres, and Balor are
thus separate fragments of one god equivalent to Kronos. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[3](#fn_192.md) Yet their

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

personalities are quite distinct. Each race works out its mythology for
itself, and, while parallels are inevitable, we should not allow these
to override the actual myths as they have come down to us.

Professor Rhŷs makes Bile, ancestor of the Milesians who came from
Spain, a Goidelic counterpart of the Gaulish Dispater, lord of the dead,
from whom the Gauls claimed descent. But Bile, neither a Fomorian nor of
the Tuatha Dé Danann, is an imaginary and shadowy creation. Bile is next
equated with a Brythonic Beli, assumed to be consort of Dôn, whose
family are equivalent to the Tuatha Dé Danann. <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) Beli was a mythic king whose reign was a
kind of golden age, and if he was father of Dôn's children, which is
doubtful, Bile would then be father of the Tuatha Dé Danann. But he is
ancestor of the Milesians, their opponents according to the annalists.
Beli is also equated with Elatha, and since Dôn, reputed consort of
Beli, was grandmother of Llew, equated with Irish Lug, grandson of
Balor, Balor is equivalent to Beli, whose name is regarded by Professor
Rhŷs as related etymologically to Balor's. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[2](#fn_194.md) Bile, Balor, and Elatha are thus
Goidelic equivalents of the shadowy Beli. But they also are quite
distinct personalities, nor are they ever hinted at as ancestral gods of
the Celts, or gods of a gloomy underworld. In Celtic belief the
underworld was probably a fertile region and a place of light, nor were
its gods harmful and evil, as Balor was.

On the whole, the Fomorians came to be regarded as the powers of nature
in its hostile aspect. They personified blight, winter, darkness, and
death, before which men trembled, yet were not wholly cast down, since
the immortal gods of growth and light, rulers of the bright other-world,
were on their side, and fought against their enemies. Year by year the
gods suffered deadly harm, but returned as conquerors to renew

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the struggle once more. Myth spoke of this as having happened once for
all, but it went on continuously. <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md)
Gods were immortal and only seemed to die. The strife was represented in
ritual, since men believe that they can aid the gods by magic, rite, or
prayer. Why, then, do hostile Fomorians and Tuatha Dé Danann intermarry?
This happens in all mythologies, and it probably reflects, in the divine
sphere, what takes place among men. Hostile peoples carry off each the
other's women, or they have periods of friendliness and consequent
intermarriage. Man makes his gods in his own image, and the problem is
best explained by facts like these, exaggerated no doubt by the Irish
annalists.

The Tuatha Dé Danann, in spite of their euhemerisation, are more than
human. In the north where they learned magic, they dwelt in four cities,
from each of which they brought a magical treasure--the stone of Fal,
which "roared under every king," Lug's unconquerable spear, Nuada's
irresistible sword, the Dagda's inexhaustible cauldron. But they are
more than wizards or Druids. They are re-born as mortals; they have a
divine world of their own, they interfere in and influence human
affairs. The euhemerists did not go far enough, and more than once their
divinity is practically acknowledged. When the Fian Caoilte and a woman
of the Tuatha Dé Danann appear before S. Patrick, he asks, "Why is she
youthful and beautiful, while you are old and wrinkled?" And Caoilte
replies, "She is of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who are unfading and whose
duration is perennial. I am of the sons of Milesius, that are perishable
and fade away." <span id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_196.md)

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

After their conversion, the Celts, sons of Milesius, thought that the
gods still existed in the hollow hills, their former dwellings and
sanctuaries, or in far-off islands, still caring for their former
worshippers. This tradition had its place with that which made them a
race of men conquered by the Milesians--the victory of Christianity over
paganism and its gods having been transmuted into a strife of races by
the euhemerists. The new faith, not the people, conquered the old gods.
The Tuatha Dé Danann became the *Daoine-sidhe*, a fairy folk, still
occasionally called by their old name, just as individual fairy kings or
queens bear the names of the ancient gods. The euhemerists gave the
Fomorians a monstrous and demoniac character, which they did not always
give to the Tuatha Dé Danann; in this continuing the old tradition that
Fomorians were hostile and the Tuatha Dé Danann beneficent and mild.

The mythological cycle is not a complete "body of divinity"; its
apparent completeness results from the chronological order of the
annalists. Fragments of other myths are found in the *Dindsenchas*;
others exist as romantic tales, and we have no reason to believe that
all the old myths have been preserved. But enough remains to show the
true nature of the Tuatha Dé Danann--their supernatural character, their
powers, their divine and unfailing food and drink, their mysterious and
beautiful abode. In their contents, their personages, in the actions
that are described in them, the materials of the "mythological cycle,"
show how widely it differs from the Cúchulainn and Fionn cycles. <span
id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) "The white radiance of eternity"
suffuses it; the heroic cycles, magical and romantic as they are, belong
far more to earth and time.

Keating abuses Giraldus for equating Roanus with Finntain in his "lying

which he, "the guide bull of the herd," is followed by others.

Domna," a goddess (Rhŷs, *HL* 597), or a god (D'Arbois, ii. 130).
"Domna" is connected with Irish words meaning "deep" (Windisch, *IT* i.
498; Stokes, *US* 153). Domna, or Domnu, may therefore have been a
goddess of the deep, not the sea so much as the underworld, and so
perhaps an Earth-mother from whom the Fir Domnann traced their descent.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[61:1](rac07.htm#fr_195.md) Whatever the
signification of the battle of Mag-tured may be, the place at which it
was localised is crowded with Neolithic megaliths, dolmens, etc. To
later fancy these were the graves of warriors slain in a great battle
fought there, and that battle became the fight between Fomorians and
Tuatha Dé Dananns. Mag-tured may have been the scene of a battle between
their respective worshippers.

that, as in the Vedas, the Odyssey, the Japanese *Ko-ji-ki*, as well as
in barbaric and savage mythologies, *Märchen* formulæ abound in the
Irish mythological cycle.
