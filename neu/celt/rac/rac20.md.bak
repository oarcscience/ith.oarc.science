### CHAPTER XVII.

# TABU.

THE Irish *geis*, pl. *geasa*, which may be rendered by Tabu, had two
senses. It meant something which must not be done for fear of disastrous
consequences, and also an obligation to do something commanded by
another.

As a tabu the *geis* had a large place in Irish life, and was probably
known to other branches of the Celts. <span
id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_879.md) It followed the general course of tabu
wherever found. Sometimes it was imposed before birth, or it was
hereditary, or connected with totemism. Legends, however, often arose
giving a different explanation to *geasa*, long after the customs in
which they originated had been forgotten. It was one of Diarmaid's
*geasa* not to hunt the boar of Ben Gulban, and this was probably
totemic in origin. But legend told how his father killed a child, the
corpse being changed into a boar by the child's father, who said its
span of life would be the same as Diarmaid's, and that he would be slain
by it. Oengus put *geasa* on Diarmaid not to hunt it, but at Fionn's
desire he broke these, and was killed. <span
id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_880.md) Other *geasa*--those of Cúchulainn not
to eat dog's flesh, and of Conaire never to chase birds--also point to
totemism.

In some cases *geasa* were based on ideas of right and

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

wrong, honour or dishonour, or were intended to cause avoidance of
unlucky days. Others are unintelligible to us. The largest number of
*geasa* concerned kings and chiefs, and are described, along with their
corresponding privileges, in the *Book of Rights*. Some of the *geasa*
of the king of Connaught were not to go to an assembly of women at
Leaghair, not to sit in autumn on the sepulchral mound of the wife of
Maine, not to go in a grey-speckled garment on a grey-speckled horse to
the heath of Cruachan, and the like. <span
id="fr_883"></span>[1](#fn_881.md) The meaning of these is obscure, but
other examples are more obvious and show that all alike corresponded to
the tabus applying to kings in primitive societies, who are often
magicians, priests, or even divine representatives. On them the welfare
of the tribe and the making of rain or sunshine, and the processes of
growth depend. They must therefore be careful of their actions, and
hence they are hedged about with tabus which, however unmeaning, have a
direct connection with their powers. Out of such conceptions the Irish
kingly *geasa* arose. Their observance made the earth fruitful, produced
abundance and prosperity, and kept both the king and his land from
misfortune. In later times these were supposed to be dependent on the
"goodness" or the reverse of the king, but this was a departure from the
older idea, which is clearly stated in the *Book of Rights*. <span
id="fr_884"></span>[2](#fn_882.md) The kings were divinities on whom
depended fruitfulness and plenty, and who must therefore submit to obey
their *geasa*. Some of their prerogatives seem also to be connected with
this state of things. Thus they might eat of certain foods or go to
certain places on particular days. <span id="fr_885"></span>[3](#fn_883.md)
In primitive societies kings and priests often prohibit ordinary mortals
from eating things which they desire for themselves by making them
*tabu*, and

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

in other cases the fruits of the earth can only be eaten after king or
priest has partaken of them ceremonially. This may have been the case in
Ireland. The privilege relating to places may have meant that these were
sacred and only to be entered by the king at certain times and in his
sacred capacity.

As a reflection from this state of things, the heroes of the sagas,
Cúchulainn and Fionn, had numerous *geasa* applicable to themselves,
some of them religious, some magical, others based on primitive ideas of
honour, others perhaps the invention of the narrators. <span
id="fr_886"></span>[1](#fn_884.md)

Geasa, whether in the sense of tabus or of obligations, could be imposed
by any one, and must be obeyed, for disobedience produced disastrous
effects. Probably the obligation was framed as an incantation or spell,
and the power of the spell being fully believed in, obedience would
follow as a matter of course. <span id="fr_887"></span>[2](#fn_885.md)
Examples of such *geasa* are numerous in Irish literature. Cúchulainn's
father-in-law put *geasa* on him that he should know no rest until he
found out the cause of the exile of the sons of Doel. And Grainne put
*geasa* on Diarmaid that he should elope with her, and this he did,
though the act was repugnant to him.

Among savages the punishment which is supposed to follow tabu-breaking
is often produced through auto-suggestion when a tabu has been
unconsciously infringed and this has afterwards been discovered. Fear
produces the result which is feared. The result is believed, however, to
be the working of divine vengeance. In the case of Irish *geasa*,
destruction and death usually followed their infringement, as in the
case of Diarmaid and Cúchulainn. But the best instance is found in the
tale of *The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel*, in which

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

the *síd*-folk avenge themselves for Eochaid's action by causing the
destruction of his descendant Conaire, who is forced to break his
*geasa*. These are first minutely detailed; then it is shown how, almost
in spite of himself, Conaire was led on to break them, and how, in the
sequel, his tragic death occurred. <span id="fr_888"></span>[1](#fn_886.md)
Viewed in this light as the working of divine vengeance to a remote
descendant of the offender by forcing him to break his tabus, the story
is one of the most terrible in the whole range of Irish literature.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[252:1](rac20.htm#fr_881.md) The religious
interdictions mentioned by Cæsar (vi. 13) may be regarded as tabus,
while the spoils of war placed in a consecrated place (vi. 18), and
certain animals among the Britons (v. 12), were clearly under tabu.
