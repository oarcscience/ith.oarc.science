### CHAPTER II.

# THE CELTIC PEOPLE.

SCRUTINY reveals the fact that Celtic-speaking peoples are of differing
types--short and dark as well as tall and fairer Highlanders or
Welshmen, short, broad-headed Bretons, various types of Irishmen. Men
with Norse names and Norse aspect "have the Gaelic." But all alike have
the same character and temperament, a striking witness to the influence
which the character as well as the language of the Celts, whoever they
were, made on all with whom they mingled. Ethnologically there may not
be a Celtic race, but something was handed down from the days of
comparative Celtic purity which welded different social elements into a
common type, found often where no Celtic tongue is now spoken. It
emerges where we least expect it, and the stolid Anglo-Saxon may
suddenly awaken to something in himself due to a forgotten Celtic strain
in his ancestry.

Two main theories of Celtic origins now hold the field:

\(1\) The Celts are identified with the progenitors of the short,
brachycephalic "Alpine race" of Central Europe, existing there in
Neolithic times, after their migrations from Africa and Asia. The type
is found among the Slavs, in parts of Germany and Scandinavia, and in
modern France in the region of Cæsar's "Celtæ," among the Auvergnats,
the Bretons, and in Lozère and Jura. Representatives. of the type have
been a

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

found in Belgian and French Neolithic graves. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) Professor Sergi calls this the "Eurasiatic
race," and, contrary to general opinion, identifies it with the Aryans,
a savage people, inferior to the dolichocephalic Mediterranean race,
whose language they Aryanised. <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md)
Professor Keane thinks that they were themselves an Aryanised folk
before reaching Europe, who in turn gave their acquired Celtic and
Slavic speech to the preceding masses. Later came the Belgæ, Aryans, who
acquired the Celtic speech of the people they conquered. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md)

Broca assumed that the dark, brachycephalic people whom he identified
with Cæsar's "Celtæ," differed from the Belgæ, were conquered by them,
and acquired the language of their conquerors, hence wrongly called
Celtic by philologists. The Belgæ were tall and fair, and overran Gaul,
except Aquitaine, mixing generally with the Celtæ, who in Cæsar's time
had thus an infusion of Belgic blood. <span id="fr_8"></span>[4](#fn_8.md)
But before this conquest, the Celtæ had already mingled with the
aboriginal dolichocephalic folk of Gaul, Iberians, or Mediterraneans of
Professor Sergi. The latter had apparently remained comparatively pure
from admixture in Aquitaine, and are probably the Aquitani of
Cæsar. <span id="fr_9"></span>[5](#fn_9.md)

But were the short, brachycephalic, folk Celts? Cæsar says the people
who call themselves "Celtæ" were called Gauls by the Romans, and Gauls,
according to classical writers, were tall and fair. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[6](#fn_10.md) Hence the Celtæ were not a short, dark
race,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

and Cæsar himself says that Gauls (including Celtæ) looked with contempt
on the short Romans. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) Strabo also
says that Celtæ and Belgæ had the same Gaulish appearance, *i.e.* tall
and fair. Cæsar's statement that Aquitani, Galli, and Belgæ differ in
language, institutions, and laws is vague and unsupported by evidence,
and may mean as to language no more than a difference in dialects. This
is also suggested by Strabo's words, Celtæ and Belgæ "differ a little"
in language. <span id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) No classical writer
describes the Celts as short and dark, but the reverse. Short, dark
people would have been called Iberians, without respect to skulls.
Classical observers were not craniologists. The short, brachycephalic
type is now prominent in France, because it has always been so,
eliminating the tall, fair Celtic type. Conquering Celts, fewer in
number than the broad and narrow-headed aborigines, intermarried or made
less lasting alliances with them. In course of time the type of the more
numerous race was bound to prevail. Even in Cæsar's day the latter
probably outnumbered the tall and fair Celts, who had, however,
Celticised them. But classical writers, who knew the true Celt as tall
and fair, saw that type only, just as every one, on first visiting
France or Germany, sees his generalised type of Frenchman or German
everywhere. Later, he modifies his opinion, but this the classical
observers did not do. Cæsar's campaigns must have drained Gaul of many
tall and fair Celts. This, with the tendency of dark types to outnumber
fair types in South and Central Europe, may help to explain the growing
prominence of the dark type, though the tall, fair type is far from
uncommon. <span id="fr_13"></span>[3](#fn_13.md)

\(2\) The second theory, already anticipated, sees in Gauls and Belgæ a
tall, fair Celtic folk, speaking a Celtic language,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and belonging to the race which stretched from Ireland to Asia Minor,
from North Germany to the Po, and were masters of Teutonic tribes till
they were driven by them from the region between Elbe and Rhine. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Some Belgic tribes claimed a Germanic
ancestry, <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) but "German" was a word
seldom used with precision, and in this case may not mean Teutonic. The
fair hair of this people has made many suppose that they were akin to
the Teutons. But fairness is relative, and the dark Romans may have
called brown hair fair, while they occasionally distinguished between
the "fair" Gauls and fairer Germans. Their institutions and their
religions (*pace* Professor Rhŷs) differed, and though they were so long
in contact the names of their gods and priests are unlike. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) Their languages, again, though of "Aryan"
stock, differ more from each other than does Celtic from Italic,
pointing to a long period of Italo-Celtic unity, before Italiotes and
Celts separated, and Celts came in contact with Teutons. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17.md) The typical German differs in mental and
moral qualities from the typical Celt. Contrast an east country Scot,
descendant of Teutonic stock, with a West Highlander, and the difference
leaps to the eyes. Celts and Germans of history differ, then, in
relative fairness, character, religion, and language.

The tall, blonde Teutonic type of the Row graves is dolichocephalic. Was
the Celtic type (assuming that Broca's "Celts" were not true Celts)
dolicho or brachy? Broca thinks the Belgæ or "Kymri" were
dolichocephalic, but all must agree with him that the skulls are too few
to generalise from. Celtic iron-age skulls in Britain are
dolichocephalic, perhaps a

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

recrudescence of the aboriginal type. Broca's "Kymric" skulls are
mesocephalic; this he attributes to crossing with the short round-heads.
The evidence is too scanty for generalisation, while the Walloons,
perhaps descendants of the Belgæ, have a high index, and some Gauls of
classical art are broad-headed. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)

Skulls of the British round barrows (early Celtic Bronze Age) are mainly
broad, the best specimens showing affinity to Neolithic brachycephalic
skulls from Grenelle (though their owners were 5 inches shorter),
Sclaigneaux, and Borreby. <span id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md) Dr. Beddoe
thinks that the narrow-skulled Belgæ on the whole reinforced the meso-
or brachycephalic round barrow folk in Britain. Dr. Thurnam identifies
the latter with the Belgæ (Broca's Kymri), and thinks that Gaulish
skulls were round, with beetling brows. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_20.md) Professors Ripley and Sergi, disregarding
their difference in stature and higher cephalic index, identify them
with the short Alpine race (Broca's Celts). This is negatived by Mr.
Keane. <span id="fr_21"></span>[4](#fn_21.md) Might not both, however, have
originally sprung from a common stock and reached Europe at different
times? <span id="fr_22"></span>[5](#fn_22.md)

But do a few hundred skulls justify these far-reaching conclusions
regarding races enduring for thousands of years? At some very remote
period there may have been a Celtic type, as at some further period
there may have been an Aryan type. But the Celts, as we know them, must
have mingled with the aborigines of Europe and become a mixed race,
though preserving and endowing others with their racial and mental
characteristics. Some Gauls or Belgæ were dolichocephalic,

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

to judge by their skulls, others were brachycephalic, while their
fairness was a relative term. Classical observers probably generalised
from the higher classes, of a purer type; they tell us nothing of the
people. But the higher classes may have had varying skulls, as well as
stature and colour of hair, <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) and
Irish texts tell of a tall, fair, blue-eyed stock, and a short, dark,
dark-eyed stock, in Ireland. Even in those distant ages we must consider
the people on whom the Celts impressed their characteristics, as well as
the Celts themselves. What happened on the Eurasian steppe, the
hypothetical cradle of the "Aryans," whence the Celts came "stepping
westwards," seems clear to some, but in truth is a book sealed with
seven seals. The men whose Aryan speech was to dominate far and wide may
already have possessed different types of skull, and that age was far
from "the very beginning."

Thus the Celts before setting out on their *Wanderjahre* may already
have been a mixed race, even if their leaders were of purer stock. But
they had the bond of common speech, institutions, and religion, and they
formed a common Celtic type in Central and Western Europe. Intermarriage
with the already mixed Neolithic folk of Central Europe produced further
removal from the unmixed Celtic racial type; but though both reacted on
each other as far as language, custom, and belief were concerned, on the
whole the Celtic elements predominated in these respects. The Celtic
migration into Gaul produced further racial mingling with descendants of
the old palæolithic stock, dolichocephalic Iberians and Ligurians, and
brachycephalic swarthy folk (Broca's Celts). Thus even the first Celtic
arrivals in Britain, the Goidels, were a people of mixed race, though
probably relatively purer than the late coming Brythons, the latest of
whom had probably mingled with the Teutons. Hence among Celtic-speaking
folk or their

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

descendants--short, dark, broad-headed Bretons, tall, fair or rufous
Highlanders, tall chestnut-haired Welshmen or Irishmen, Highlanders of
Norse descent, short, dark, narrow-headed Highlanders, Irishmen, and
Welshmen--there is a common Celtic *facies*, the result of old Celtic
characteristics powerful enough so to impress themselves on such varied
peoples in spite of what they gave to the Celtic incomers. These peoples
became Celtic, and Celtic in speech and character they have remained,
even where ancestral physical types are reasserting themselves. The folk
of a Celtic type, whether pre-Celtic, Celtic, or Norse, have all spoken
a Celtic language and exhibit the same old Celtic
characteristics--vanity, loquacity, excitability, fickleness,
imagination, love of the romantic, fidelity, attachment to family ties,
sentimental love of their country, religiosity passing over easily to
superstition, and a comparatively high degree of sexual morality. Some
of these traits were already noted by classical observers.

Celtic speech had early lost the initial *p* of old Indo-European
speech, except in words beginning with *pt* and, perhaps, *ps*. Celtic
*pare* (Lat. *prae*) became *are*, met with in *Aremorici*, "the
dwellers by the sea," *Arecluta*, "by the Clyde," the region watered by
the Clyde. Irish *athair*, Manx *ayr*, and Irish *iasg*, represent
respectively Latin *pater* and *piscis*. *P* occurring between vowels
was also lost, *e.g.* Irish *caora*, "sheep," is from *kaperax*; for,
"upon" (Lat. *super*), from *uper*. This change took place before the
Goidelic Celts broke away and invaded Britain in the tenth century B.C.,
but while Celts and Teutons were still in contact, since Teutons
borrowed words with initial *p*, *e.g.* Gothic *fairguni*, "mountain,"
from Celtic *percunion*, later *Ercunio*, the Hercynian forest. The loss
must have occurred before 1000 B.C. But after the separation of the
Goidelic group a further change took place. Goidels preserved the sound
represented by *qu*, or more simply by *c* or *ch*, but this

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

was changed into *p* by the remaining continental Celts, who carried
with them into Gaul, Spain, Italy, and Britain (the Brythons) words in
which *q* became *p*. The British *Epidii* is from Gaulish *epos*,
"horse," which is in Old Irish *ech* (Lat. *equus*). The Parisii take
their name from *Qarisii*, the Pictones or Pictavi of Poictiers from
*Pictos* (which in the plural *Picti* gives us "Picts"), derived from
*quicto*-. This change took place after the Goidelic invasion of Britain
in the tenth century B.C. On the other hand, some continental Celts may
later have regained the power of pronouncing *q*. In Gaul the *q* of
*Sequana* (Seine) was not changed to *p*, and a tribe dwelling on its
banks was called the Sequani. This assumes that Sequana was a pre-Celtic
word, possibly Ligurian. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) Professor
Rhŷs thinks, however, that Goidelic tribes, identified by him with
Cæsar's Celtæ, existed in Gaul and Spain before the coming of the Galli,
and had preserved *q* in their speech. To them we owe Sequana, as well
as certain names with *q* in Spain. <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md)
This at least is certain, that Goidelic Celts of the *q* group occupied
Gaul and Spain before reaching Britain and Ireland. Irish tradition and
archæological data confirm this. <span id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26.md) But
whether their descendants were represented by Cæsar's "Celtæ" must be
uncertain. Celtæ and Galli, according to Cæsar, were one and the
same, <span id="fr_27"></span>[4](#fn_27.md) and must have had the same
general form of speech.

The dialects of Goidelic speech-Irish, Manx, Gaelic, and that of the
continental Goidels--preserved the *q* sound; those of Gallo-Brythonic
speech-Gaulish, Breton, Welsh, Cornish--changed *q* into *p*. The speech
of the Picts, perhaps connected with the Pictones of Gaul, also had this
*p* sound. Who, then,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

were the Picts? According to Professor Rhŷs they were pre-Aryans, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) but they must have been under the
influence of Brythonic Celts. Dr. Skene regarded them as Goidels
speaking a Goidelic dialect with Brythonic forms. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md) Mr. Nicholson thinks they were Goidels who
had preserved the Indo-European *p*. <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md)
But might they not be descendants of a Brythonic group, arriving early
in Britain and driven northwards by newcomers

Professor Windisch and Dr. Stokes regard them as Celts, allied to the
Brythons rather than to the Goidels, the phonetics of their speech
resembling those of Welsh rather than Irish. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31.md)

The theory of an early Goidelic occupation of Britain has been contested
by Professor Meyer, <span id="fr_32"></span>[5](#fn_32.md) who holds that
the first Goidels reached Britain from Ireland in the second century,
while Dr. MacBain <span id="fr_33"></span>[6](#fn_33.md), was of the
opinion that England, apart from Wales and Cornwall, knew no Goidels,
the place-names being Brythonic. But unless all Goidels reached Ireland
from Gaul or Spain, as some did, Britain was more easily reached than
Ireland by migrating Goidels from the Continent. Prominent Goidelic
place-names would become Brythonic, but insignificant places would
retain their Goidelic form, and to these we must look for decisive
evidence. <span id="fr_34"></span>[7](#fn_34.md) A Goidelic occupation by
the ninth century B.C. is suggested by the name "Cassiterides" (a word
of the *q* group) applied to Britain. If the Goidels occupied Britain
first, they may have called their land *Qretanis* or *Qritanis*, which
Pictish invaders would change to *Pretanis*, found in Welsh "Ynys
Pridain," Pridain's Isle, or Isle of the Picts, "pointing to the
original underlying the Greek Πρετανικαῖ Ηῆσοι

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

or Pictish Isles," <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) though the change
may be due to continental *p* Celts trading with *q* Celts in Britain.
With the Pictish occupation would agree the fact that Irish Goidels
called the Picts who came to Ireland *Cruithne* = *Qritani* = *Pretani*.
In Ireland they almost certainly adopted Goidelic speech.

Whether or not all the Pictish invaders of Britain were called
"Pictavi," this word or Picti, perhaps from *quicto* (Irish *cicht*,
engraver"), <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md) became a general name
for this people. *Q* had been changed into *p* on the Continent; hence
"Pictavi" or "Pictones," "the tattooed men," those who "engraved"
figures on their bodies, as the Picts certainly did. Dispossessed and
driven north by incoming Brythons and Belgæ, they later became the
virulent enemies of Rome. In 306 Eumenius describes all the northern
tribes as "Caledonii and other Picts," while some of the tribes
mentioned by Ptolemy have Brythonic names or names with Gaulish
cognates. Place-names in the Pictish area, personal names in the Pictish
chronicle, and Pictish names like "Peanfahel", <span
id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md) have Brythonic affinities. If the Picts
spoke a Brythonic dialect, S. Columba's need of an interpreter when
preaching to them would be explained. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38.md) Later the Picts were conquered by Irish
Goidels, the Scotti. The Picts, however, must already have mingled with
aboriginal peoples and with Goidels, if these were already in Britain,
and they may have adopted their supposed non-Aryan customs from the
aborigines. On the other hand, the matriarchate seems at one time to
have been Celtic, and it may have been no more than a conservative
survival in the Pictish royal house, as it was elsewhere. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[5](#fn_39.md) Britons, as well as Caledonii, had wives
in common. <span id="fr_40"></span>[6](#fn_40.md) As to tattooing, it was
practised by the Scotti ("the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

scarred and painted men"?), and the Britons dyed themselves with woad,
while what seem to be tattoo marks appear on faces on Gaulish
coins. <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) Tattooing, painting, and
scarifying the body are varieties of one general custom, and little
stress can be laid on Pictish tattooing as indicating a racial
difference. Its purpose may have been ornamental, or possibly to impart
an aspect of fierceness, or the figures may have been totem marks, as
they are elsewhere. Finally, the description of the Caledonii, a Pictish
people, possessing flaming hair and mighty limbs, shows that they
differed from the short, dark pre-Celtic folk. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)

The Pictish problem must remain obscure, a welcome puzzle to
antiquaries, philologists, and ethnologists. Our knowledge of Pictish
religion is too scanty for the interpretation of Celtic religion to be
affected by it. But we know that the Picts offered sacrifice before
war--a Celtic custom, and had Druids, as also had the Celts.

The earliest Celtic "kingdom" was in the region between the upper waters
of the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube, where probably in Neolithic
times the formation of their Celtic speech as a distinctive language
began. Here they first became known to the Greeks, probably as a
semi-mythical people, the Hyperboreans--the folk dwelling beyond the
Ripœan mountains whence Boreas blew--with whom Hecatæus in the fourth
century identifies them. But they were now known as Celts, and their
territory as Celtica, while "Galatæ" was used as a synonym of "Celtæ,"
in the third century B.C. <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) The name
generally applied by the Romans to the Celts was

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Galli," a term finally confined by them to the
people of Gaul. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) Successive bands of
Celts went forth from this comparatively restricted territory, until the
Celtic "empire" for some centuries before 300 B.C. included the British
Isles, parts of the Iberian peninsula, Gaul, North Italy, Belgium,
Holland, great part of Germany, and Austria. When the German tribes
revolted, Celtic bands appeared in Asia Minor, and remained there as the
Galatian Celts. Archaeological discoveries with a Celtic *facies* have
been made in most of these lands, but even more striking is the witness
of place-names. Celtic *dunon*, a fort or castle (the Gaelic *dun*), is
found in compound names from Ireland to Southern Russia. Magos, "a
field," is met with in Britain, France, Switzerland, Prussia, Italy, and
Austria. River and mountain names familiar in [Britain](errata.htm#0.md)
occur on the Continent. The Pennine range of Cumberland has the same
name as the Appenines. Rivers named for their inherent divinity,
*devos*, are found in Britain and on the Continent--Dee, Deva, etc.

Besides this linguistic, had the Celts also a political unity over their
great "empire," under one bead? Such a unity certainly did not prevail
from Ireland to the Balkan peninsula, but it prevailed over a large part
of the Celtic area. Livy, following Timagenes, who perhaps cited a lost
Celtic epos, speaks of king Ambicatus ruling over the Celts from Spain
to Germany, and sending his sister's sons, Bellovesus and Segovesus,
with many followers, to found new colonies in Italy and the Hercynian
forest. <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) Mythical as this may be, it
suggests the hegemony of one tribe or one chief over other tribes and
chiefs, for Livy says that the sovereign power rested with the Bituriges
who appointed the king of Celticum,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

viz. Ambicatus. Some such unity is necessary to explain Celtic power in
the ancient world, and it was made possible by unity of race or at least
of the congeries of Celticised peoples, by religious solidarity, and
probably by regular gatherings of all the kings or chiefs. If the Druids
were a Celtic priesthood at this time, or already formed a corporation
as they did later in Gaul, they must have endeavoured to form and
preserve such a unity. And if it was never so compact as Livy's words
suggest, it must have been regarded as an ideal by the Celts or by their
poets, Ambicatus serving as a central figure round which the ideas of
empire crystallised. The hegemony existed in Gaul, where the Arverni and
their king claimed power over the other tribes, and where the Romans
tried to weaken the Celtic unity by opposing to them the Aedui. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) In Belgium the hegemony was in the hands
of the Suessiones, to whose king Belgic tribes in Britain
submitted. <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) In Ireland the "high
king" was supreme over other smaller kings, and in Galatia the unity of
the tribes was preserved by a council with regular assemblies. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md)

The diffusion of the Ambicatus legend would help to preserve unity by
recalling the mythic greatness of the past. The Boii and Insubri
appealed to transalpine Gauls for aid by reminding them of the deeds of
their ancestors. <span id="fr_49"></span>[4](#fn_49.md) Nor would the
Druids omit to infuse into their pupils' minds the sentiment of national
greatness. For this and for other reasons, the Romans, to whom "the
sovereignity of all Gaul " was an obnoxious watchword, endeavoured to
suppress them. <span id="fr_50"></span>[5](#fn_50.md) But the Celts were
too widely scattered ever to form a compact empire. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[6](#fn_51.md) The Roman empire extended itself gradually
in the consciousness of

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

its power; the cohesion of the Celts in an empire or under one king was
made impossible by their migrations and diffusion. Their unity, such as
it was, was broken by the revolt of the Teutonic tribes, and their
subjugation was completed by Rome. The dreams of wide empire remained
dreams. For the Celts, in spite of their vigour, have been a race of
dreamers, their conquests in later times, those of the spirit rather
than of the mailed fist. Their superiority has consisted in imparting to
others their characteristics; organised unity and a vast empire could
never be theirs.

*qelo*, "to raise," it may mean "the lofty," just as many savages call
themselves "the men," *par excellence*. Rhŷs derives it from *qel*, "to
slay," and gives it the sense of "warriors." See Holder, *s.v.* Stokes,
*US* 83. *Galatæ* is from *gala* (Irish *gal*), "bravery." Hence perhaps
warriors."

<span id="fn_44"></span>[19:1](rac05.htm#fr_44.md) 'Galli' may be connected
with "Galatæ," but D'Arbois denies this. For all these titles see his
