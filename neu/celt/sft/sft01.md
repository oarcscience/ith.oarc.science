Authors Preface

> THE chief object of this volume is to exhibit, in a manner acceptable
> to readers who are not specialists, the application of the principles
> and methods which guide investigations into popular traditions to a
> few of the most remarkable stories embodying the Fairy superstitions
> of the Celtic and Teutonic peoples. Some of the subjects discussed
> have already been dealt with by more competent inquirers. But even in
> these cases I have sometimes been able to supply additional
> illustrations of the conclusions previously arrived at, and
> occasionally, I hope, to carry the argument a step or two further than
> had been done before. I have thus tried to rend the following pages
> not wholly valueless to students.

> A portion of the book incorporates the substance of some articles
> which I contributed to "The Archaeological Review " and "Folk-Lore."
> But these have been to a considerable extent re-written; and it is
> hoped that in the process wider and more accurate generalizations have
> been attained.

> My hearty thanks are due to the various friends whose generous
> assistance has been recorded in the footnotes, and especially to
> Professor Dr. George Stephens, the veteran antiquary of the North, and
> Mr. W. G. Fretton, who have not measured their pains on behalf of one
> whose only claim on them was a common desire to pry into the recesses
> of the past. I am under still deeper obligations to Mr. G. L. Gomme,
> F.S.A., who has so readily acceded to my request that he would read
> the proof-sheets, and whose suggestions have repeatedly been of the
> greatest value; and to Mr. Havelock Ellis for the counsel and
> suggestions which his experience has more than once enabled him to
> give as the book was passing through the press.

> I have been anxious to enable the reader who cares to do so to verify
> every statement made; but some of them no doubt have escaped
> reference. Many books are cited again and again, and in similar cases
> the reader's time is frequently wasted in searching for the first
> mention of a book, so as to ascertain its title and other particulars.
> To avoid the trouble I have so many times experienced in this way, I
> have put together in an Appendix a list of the principal authorities
> made use of, indicating them by the short title by which they are
> cited in the footnotes, and giving sufficient bibliographical details
> to enable them to be identified. Classics and works which are in every
> one's hands I have not thought it necessary to include in the list.
