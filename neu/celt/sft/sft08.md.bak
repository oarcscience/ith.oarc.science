> IN previous chapters we have seen that human beings are sometimes
> taken by fairies into Fairyland, and that they are there kept for a
> longer or shorter period, or, it may be, are never permitted to return
> to earth at all. We have noted cases in which they are led down for
> temporary purposes and, if they are prudent, are enabled to return
> when those purposes are accomplished. We have noted other cases in
> which babes or grown women have been stolen and retained until their
> kindred have compelled restoration. The story cited in the last
> chapter from Giraldus describes a seduction of a different kind. There
> the visit to Fairyland was of a more voluntary character, and the hero
> was able to go to and fro as he pleased. We have also met with tales
> in which the temptation of food, or more usually of drink, has been
> held out to the wayfarer; and we have learned that the result of
> yielding would be to give himself wholly into the fairies' hands. I
> propose now to examine instances in which temptation of one kind or
> other has been successful, or in which a spell has been cast over man
> or woman, not merely preventing the bewitched person from regaining
> his home and human society, but also rendering him, while under the
> spell, impervious to the attacks of time and unconscious of its
> flight.

> These stories are of many types. The first type comes, so far as I
> know, only from Celtic sources. It is very widely known in Wales, and
> we may call it, from its best-known example, the "Rhys and Llewelyn
> type." A story obtained between sixty and seventy years ago in the
> Vale of Neath relates that Rhys and Llewelyn were fellow-servants to a
> farmer; and they had been engaged one day in carrying lime for their
> master. As they were going home, driving their mountain ponies before
> them in the twilight, Rhys suddenly called to his companion to stop
> and listen to the music. It was a tune, he said, to which he had
> danced a hundred times, and he must go and have a dance now. So he
> told his companion to go on with the horses and he would soon overtake
> him.. Llewelyn could hear nothing, and began to remonstrate; but away
> sprang Rhys, and he called after him in vain. Accordingly he went
> home, put up the ponies, ate his supper and went to bed, thinking that
> Rhys had only made a pretext for going to the alehouse. But when
> morning came, and still no sign of Rhys, he told his master what had
> occurred. Search proving fruitless, suspicion fell on Llewelyn of
> having murdered his fellow-servant, and he was accordingly imprisoned.
> A farmer in the neighbourhood, skilled in fairy matters, guessing how
> things might have been, proposed that himself and some others,
> including the narrator of the story, should accompany Llewelyn to the
> place where he parted with Rhys. On coming to it, "Hush!" cried
> Llewelyn, "I hear music, I hear sweet harps." All listened, but could
> hear nothing. But Llewelyn's foot was on the outward edge of the
> fairy-ring. "Put your

> foot on mine, David," he said to the narrator. The latter did so, and
> so did each of the party, one after the other, and then heard the
> sound of many harps, and saw within a circle, about twenty feet
> across, great numbers of little people dancing round and round. Among
> them was Rhys, whom Llewelyn caught by the smock-frock, as he came by
> him, and pulled him out of the circle. "Where are the horses? where
> are the horses? "cried he. "Horses, indeed!" said Llewelyn. Rhys urged
> him to go home and let him finish his dance, in which he averred he
> had not been engaged more than five minutes. It was only by main force
> they got him away; and the sequel was that he could not be persuaded
> of the time that had passed in the dance: he became melancholy, took
> to his bed, and soon after died. \[a\]

> Variants of this tale are found all over Wales. At Pwllheli, Professor
> Rhys was told of two youths who went out to fetch cattle and came at
> dusk upon a party of fairies dancing. One was drawn into the circle;
> and the other was suspected of murdering him, until, at a wizard's
> suggestion, he went again to the same spot at the end of a year and a
> day. There he found his friend dancing, and managed to get him out,
> reduced to a mere skeleton. The first question put by the rescued man
> was as to the cattle he was driving. Again, at Trefriw, Professor Rhys
> found a belief that when a young man got into a fairy-ring the fairy
> damsels took him away; but he could be got out unharmed at the end of
> a year and a day, when he would be found dancing with them in the same
> ring. The mode of recovery was to touch him with a piece of iron and
> to drag him out at once. We shall consider hereafter the reason for
> touching the captive with iron. In this way was recovered, after the
> expiration of a year and a day, a youth who had wandered into a
> fairy-ring. He had new shoes on at the time he was, lost; and he could
> not be made to understand that he had been there more than five
> minutes until he was asked to look at his new shoes, which were by
> that time in pieces. Near Aberystwyth, Professor Rhys was told of a
> servant-maid who was lost while looking for some calves. Her
> fellow-servant, a man, was taken into custody on a charge of murdering
> her. A "wise man," however, found out that she was with the fairies;
> and by his directions the servant-man was successful at the end of the
> usual period of twelve months and a day in drawing her out of the
> fairy-ring at the place where she was lost. As soon as she was
> released and saw her fellow-servant (who was carefully dressed in the
> same clothes as he had on when she left him), she asked about the
> calves. On their way home she told her master, the servant-man, and
> the others, that she would stay with them until her master should
> strike her with iron, One day, therefore, when she was helping her
> master to harness a horse the bit touched her, and she disappeared
> instantly and was never seen from that time forth. In another case,
> said to have happened in Anglesea, a girl got into a fairy-circle
> while looking, with her father, for a lost cow. By a "wise man's"
> advice, however, he rescued her by pulling her out of the circle the
> very hour of the night of the anniversary of his loss. The first
> inquiry she then made was after the cow, for she had not the slightest
> recollection of the time she had spent with the fairies. \[b\]

> A ghastly sequel, more frequently found in a type of the story
> considered later on, sometimes occurs. In Carmarthenshire it is said
> that a farmer going out one morning very early was lost; nor were any
> tidings heard of him for more than twelve months afterwards, until one
> day a man passing by a lonely spot saw him dancing, and spoke to him.
> This broke the spell; and the farmer, as if waking out of a dream,
> exclaimed: "Oh dear! where are my horses?" Stepping out of the magical
> circle, he fell down and mingled his dust with the earth. In North
> Wales a story was generally current a couple of generations since of
> two men travelling together who were benighted in a wood. One of them
> slept, but the other fell into the hands of the fairies. With the help
> of a wizard's advice, some of his relatives rescued him at the end of
> a year. They went to the place where his companion had missed him,
> there found him dancing with the fairies and dragged him out of the
> ring. The unfortunate man, imagining it was the same night and that he
> was with his companion, immediately asked if it were not better to go
> home. He was offered some food, which he began to eat; but he had no
> sooner done so than he mouldered away. A similar tradition attaches to
> a certain yew-tree near Mathafarn in the parish of Llanwrin. One of
> two farm-servants was lost at that spot, and found again, a year
> after, dancing in a fairy-circle. On being dragged out he was asked if
> he did not feel hungry. "No," he replied, "and if I did, have I not
> here in my wallet the remains of my dinner that I had before I fell
> asleep?" He did not know that a year had passed by. His look was like
> a skeleton; and as soon as he had tasted food be too mouldered away.
> \[c\]

> In Scotland the story is told without this terrible end. For example,
> in Sutherlandshire we learn that a man who had been with a friend to
> the town of Lairg to enter his first child's birth in the
> session-books, and to buy a keg of whisky against the christening, sat
> down to rest at the foot of the hill of Durchâ, near a large hole from
> which they soon heard a sound of piping and dancing. Feeling curious,
> he entered the cavern, and disappeared. His friend was accused of
> murder, but being allowed a year and a day to vindicate himself, he
> used to repair at dusk to the fatal spot and call and pray. One day
> before the term ran out, he sat, as usual, in the gloaming by the
> cavern, when, what seemed his friend's shadow passed within it. It was
> his friend himself, tripping merrily with the fairies. The accused man
> succeeded in catching him by the sleeve and pulling him out. "Why
> could you not let me finish my reel, Sandy?" asked the bewitched man.
> "Bless me!" rejoined Sandy, "have you not had enough of reeling this
> last twelvemonth?" But the other would not believe in this lapse of
> time until he found his wife sitting by the door with a yearling child
> in her arms. In Kirkcudbrightshire, one night about Hallowe'en two
> young ploughmen, returning from an errand, passed by an old ruined
> mill and heard within music and dancing. One of them went in; and
> nothing was seen of him again until a year after, when his companion
> went to the same place, Bible in hand, and delivered him from the evil
> beings into whose power he had fallen. \[d\]

> The captive, however, does not always require to be sought for: he is
> sometimes released voluntarily by his captors. A man who lived at
> Ystradgynlais, in Brecknockshire, going out one day to look after his
> cattle and sheep on the mountain, disappeared. In about three weeks,
> after search had been made in vain for him and his wife had given him
> up for dead, he came home. His wife asked him where he had been for
> the past three weeks. "Three weeks! Is it three weeks you call three
> hours?" said he. Pressed to say where he had been, he told her he had
> been playing on his flute (which he usually took with him on the
> mountain) at the Llorfa, a spot near the Van Pool, when he was
> surrounded at a distance by little beings like men, who closed nearer
> and nearer to him until they became a very small circle. They sang and
> danced, and so affected him that he quite lost himself. They offered
> him some small cakes to eat, of which he partook; and he had never
> enjoyed himself so well in his life. Near Bridgend is a place where a.
> woman is said to have lived who was absent ten years with the fairies,
> and thought she was not out of the house more than ten minutes. With a
> woman's proverbial persistency, she would not believe her husband's
> assurances that it was ten years since she disappeared; and the
> serious disagreement between them which ensued was so notorious that
> it gave a name to the place where they lived. A happier result is
> believed to have attended an adventure that foreboded much worse to a
> man at Dornoch, in Sutherlandshire. He was present at a funeral in the
> churchyard on New Year's Day, and was so piqued at not being invited,
> as all the others were, to some of the New Year's festivities, that in
> his vexation, happening to see a skull lying at his feet, he struck it
> with his staff and said: "Thou seemest to be forsaken and uncared-for,
> like myself. I have been bidden by none; neither have I invited' any:
> I now invite thee!" That night as he and his wife were sitting down
> alone to supper, a venerable old man entered the room in silence and
> took his share of the delicacies provided. In those days the New
> Year's feast was kept up for eleven days together; and the stranger's
> visit was repeated in the same absolute silence for six nights. At
> last the host, alarmed and uneasy, sought the priest's advice as to
> how he was to get rid of his unwelcome guest. The reverend father bade
> him, in laying the bannocks in the basket for the seventh day's
> supper, reverse the last-baked one. This, he declared, would induce
> the old man to speak. It did; and the speech was an invitation--nay,
> rather a command--to spend the remainder of the festival with him in
> the churchyard. The priest, again consulted, advised compliance; and
> the man went trembling to the tryst. He found in the churchyard a
> great house, brilliantly illuminated, where he enjoyed himself,
> eating, drinking, piping and dancing. After what seemed the lapse of a
> few hours, the grey master of the house came to him, and bade him
> hasten home, or his wife would be married to another; and in parting
> he advised him always to respect the remains of the dead. Scarcely had
> he done speaking when the grey old man himself, the guests, the house,
> and all that it contained, vanished, leaving the man to crawl home
> alone in the moonlight as best he might after so long a debauch. For
> he had been absent a year and a day; and when he got home he found his
> wife in a bride's dress, and the whole house gay with a bridal party.
> His entrance broke in upon the mirth: his wife swooned, and the new
> bridegroom scrambled up the chimney. But when she got over her fright,
> and her husband had recovered from the fatigue of his year-long dance,
> they made it up, and lived happily ever after. \[e\]

> A story of this type has been elaborated by a Welsh writer who is
> known as " Glasynys" into a little romance, in which the hero is a
> shepherd lad, and the heroine a fairy maiden whom he weds and brings
> home with him. 'This need not detain us; but a more authentic story
> from the Vale of Neath may be mentioned. It concerns a boy called
> Gitto Bach, or Little Griffith, a farmer's son, who disappeared.
> During two whole years nothing was heard of him; but at length one
> morning when his mother, who had long and bitterly mourned for him as
> dead, opened the door, whom should she see sitting on the threshold
> but Gitto with a bundle under his arm. He was dressed and looked
> exactly as when she last saw him, for he had not grown a bit. "Where
> have you been all this time?" asked his mother. "Why, it was only
> yesterday I went away," he replied; and opening the bundle, he showed
> her a dress the "little children," as he called them, had given him
> for dancing with them. The dress was of white paper without seam. With
> maternal caution she put it into the fire. \[f\]

> I am not aware of many foreign examples of this type; but among the
> Siberian Tartars their extravagant heroes sometimes feast overlong
> with friends as mythical as themselves. On one occasion

> They caroused, they feasted.  
> That a month had flown  
> They knew not;  
> That a year had gone by  
> They knew not.  
> As a year went by  
> It seemed like a day;  
> As two years went by  
> It seemed like two days:  
> As three years went by  
> It seemed like three days."

> Again, when a hero was married the time very naturally passed rapidly.
> "One day he thought he had lived here--he had lived a month; two days
> he believed he had lived--he had lived two months; three days he
> believed he had lived--he had lived three months." And he was much
> surprised to learn from his bride how long it really was, though time
> seems always to have gone wrong with him. For after he was born it is
> recorded that in one day he became a year old, in two days two years,
> and in seven days seven years old; after which he performed some
> heroic feats, ate fourteen sheep and three cows, and then lying down
> slept for seven days and seven nights--in other words, until he was
> fourteen years old. In a Breton tale a girl who goes down underground,
> to become godmother to a fairy child, thinks, when she returns, that
> she has been away but two days, though in the meantime her god-child
> has grown big: she has been in fact ten years. In a Hessian legend the
> time of absence is seven years. \[g\]

> Turning away from this type, in which pleasure, and especially the
> pleasure of music and dancing, is the motive, let us look at what seem
> to be some specially German and Slavonic types of the tale. In the
> latter it is rather an act of service (sometimes under compulsion),
> curiosity or greed, which leads the mortal into the mysterious regions
> where time has so little power. At Eldena, in Pomerania, are the ruins
> of a monastery and church, formerly very wealthy, under which are said
> to be some remarkable chambers. Two Capuchin monks came from Rome many
> years ago, and inquired of the head of the police after a hidden door
> which led under the ruins. He lent them his servant-boy, who, under
> their direction, removed the rubbish and found the door. It opened at
> the touch of the monks, and they entered with the servant. Passing
> through several rooms they reached one in which many persons were
> sitting and writing. Here they were courteously received; and after a
> good deal of secret conference between the monks and their hosts, they
> were dismissed. When the servant came back to the upper air, he found
> he had been absent three whole years. Blanik is the name of a mountain
> in Bohemia, beneath which are lofty halls whose walls are entirely
> fashioned of rock-crystal. In these halls the Bohemian hero, the holy
> King Wenzel, sleeps with a chosen band of his knights, until some day
> the utmost need of his country shall summon him and them to her aid. A
> smith, who dwelt near the mountain, was once mowing his meadow, when a
> stranger came and bade him follow him. The stranger led him into the
> mountain, where he beheld the sleeping knights, each one upon his
> horse, his head bent down upon the horse's neck. His guide then
> brought him tools that he might shoe the horses, but told him to
> beware in his work of knocking against any of the knights. The smith
> skilfully performed his work, but as he was shoeing the last horse he
> accidentally touched the rider, who started up, crying out "Is it
> time?" "Not yet," replied he who had brought the smith thither,
> motioning the latter to keep quiet. When the task was done, the smith
> received the old shoes by way of reward. On returning home he was
> astonished to find two mowers at work in his meadow, whereas he had
> only left one there. From them he learned that he had been away a
> whole year; and when he opened his bag, behold the old horse-shoes
> were all of solid gold! On Easter Sunday, during mass, the grey horse
> belonging to another peasant living at the foot of the Blanik
> disappeared. While in quest of him the owner found the mountain open,
> and, entering, arrived in the hail Where the knights sat round a large
> table of stone and slept. Each of them wore black armour, save their
> chief, who shone in gold and bore three herons' feathers in his helm.
> Ever and anon one or other of the knights would look up and ask: "Is
> it time?" But on their chief shaking his head he would sink again to
> rest. While the peasant was in the midst of his astonishment he heard
> a neighing behind him; and turning round he left the cavern. His horse
> was quietly grazing outside; but when he got home every one shrank in
> fright away from him. His wife sat at the table in deep mourning. On
> seeing him she shrieked and asked: "Where have you been for a whole
> year?" He thought he had only been absent a single hour. A servant-man
> driving two horses over the Blanik heard the trampling of steeds and a
> battle-march played. It was the knights returning from their mimic
> combat; and the horses he was driving were so excited that he was
> compelled to follow with them into the mountain, which then closed
> upon them. Nor did he reach home until ten years had passed away,
> though he thought it had only been as many days.\[h\]

> We shall have occasion to return to Blanik and its knights. Parallel
> traditions attach, as is well known, to the Kyffhäuser, a mountain in
> Thuringia, where Frederick Barbarossa sleeps. A peasant going with
> corn to market at Nordhausen, drove by the Kyffhauser, where he was
> met by a little grey man, who asked him whither he was going, and
> offered to reward him if he would accompany him instead. The little
> grey man led him through a great gateway into the mountain till they
> came at last to a castle. There he took from the peasant his waggon
> and horses, and led him into a hail gorgeously illuminated and filled
> with people, where he was well entertained. At last the little grey
> man told him it was now time he went home, and rewarding him
> bountifully he led him forth. His waggon and horses were given to him
> again, and he trudged homeward well pleased. Arrived there, however,
> his wife opened her eyes wide to see him, for he had been absent a
> year, and she had long accounted him dead. It fared not quite so well
> with a journeyman joiner from Nordhausen, by name Thiele, who found
> the mountain open, as it is every seven years, and went in. There he
> saw the Marquis John (whoever he may have been), with his beard
> spreading over the table and his nails grown through it. Around the
> walls lay great wine-vats, whose hoops and wood had alike rolled away;
> but the wine had formed its own shell and was blood-red. A little drop
> remained in the wine-glass which stood before the Marquis John. The
> joiner made bold to drain it off, and thereupon fell asleep. When he
> awoke again he had slept for seven years in the mountain. \[i\]

> Curiosity and greed caused this man to lose seven years of his life.
> This is a motive often met with in these stories. A young girl during
> the midday rest left a hayfield in the Lavantthal, Carinthia, to climb
> the Schönofen, whence there is a fine view over the valley. As she
> reached the top she became aware of an open door in the rock. She
> entered, and found herself in a cellar-like room. Two fine black
> steeds stood at the fodder-trough and fed off the finest oats.
> Marvelling how they got there, she put a few handfuls of the oats into
> her pocket, and passed on into a second chamber. A chest stood there,
> and on the chest lay a black dog. Near him was a loaf of bread, in
> which a knife was stuck. With ready wit she divined, or recollected,
> the purpose of the bread; and cutting a good slice she threw it to the
> dog. While he was busy devouring it she filled her apron from the
> treasure contained in the chest. But meantime the door closed, and
> there was nothing for it but to lie down and sleep. She awoke to find
> the door wide open, and at once made the best of her way home, But she
> was not a little astounded to learn that she had been gone for a whole
> year. \[j\]

> A Lapp tale presents this mysterious lapse of time as the sequel of an
> adventure similar to that of Ulysses with Polyphemus. An old Lapp,
> having lost his way while hunting, came to a cottage. The door was
> open; and he entered to remain there the night, and began to cook in a
> pot he carried with him the game he had caught that day. Suddenly a
> witch entered, and asked him: "What is your name?" "Myself," answered
> the Lapp; and taking a spoonful of the boiling liquid he flung it in
> her face. She cried out: "Myself has burnt me! Myself has burnt me!"
> "If you have burnt yourself you ought to suffer," answered her
> companion from the neighbouring mountain. The hunter was thus
> delivered for the moment from the witch, who, however, as she went
> away, exclaimed: "Self has burnt me; Self shall sleep till the new
> year!" When the Lapp had finished his repast he lay down to repose. On
> awaking he rummaged in his provision-sack: he found its contents
> mouldy and putrid. Nor could he understand this before he got home and
> learned that he had been missing for six months. \[k\]

> This story is unlike the previous ones, inasmuch as it represents the
> six months' disappearance as in no way due to any enticements, either
> of supernatural beings or of the hero's own passions. Neither music,
> nor dancing, neither greed nor curiosity, led him astray. The
> aboriginal inhabitants of Japan in like manner tell of a certain man
> who went out in his boat to fish and was carried off by a storm to an
> unknown land. The chief, an old man of divine aspect, begged him to
> stay there for the night, promising to send him home to his own
> country on the morrow. The promise was fulfilled by his being sent
> with some of the old chief's subjects who were going thither; but the
> man was enjoined to lie down in the boat and cover up his head. When
> he reached his native place the sailors threw him into the water; and
> ere he came to himself sailors and boat had disappeared. He had been
> away for a whole year; and the chief appeared to him shortly
> afterwards in a dream, revealing himself as no human being, but the
> chief of the salmon, the divine fish; and he required the man
> thenceforth to worship him. Curiously similar to the Japanese tale is
> a tale told to M. Sébillot by a cabin-boy of Saint Cast in Brittany. A
> fisherman caught one day the king of the fishes, in the shape of a
> small gilded fish, but was persuaded to let him go under promise to
> send (such is the popular belief in the unselfishness of kings) at all
> times as many of his subjects as the fisherman wanted into his nets.
> The promise was royally fulfilled. More than this, when the
> fisherman's boat was once capsized by a storm the king of the fishes
> appeared, gave its drowning owner to drink from a bottle he had
> brought for the purpose, and conveyed him under the water to his
> capital,--a beautiful city whose streets, surpassing those of London
> in the traditions of English peasant children, were paved not only
> with gold but with diamonds and other gems. The fisherman promptly
> filled his pockets with these paving-stones; and then the king
> politely told him: "When you are tired of being with us, you have only
> to say so." There is a limit to hospitality; so the fisherman took the
> hint, and told the king how delighted he should be to remain there
> always, but that he had a wife and children at home who would think he
> was drowned. The king called a tunny and commanded him to take the
> fisherman on his back and deposit him on a rock near the shore, where
> the other fishers could see and rescue him. Then, with the parting
> gift of an inexhaustible purse, he dismissed his guest. When the
> fisherman got back to his village he found he had been away more than
> six months. In the chapter on Changelings I had occasion to refer to
> some instances of women being carried off at a critical time in their
> lives. One more such instance may be added here. Among the Bohemians a
> mythical female called Polednice is believed to be dangerous to women
> who have recently added to the population; and such women are
> accordingly warned to keep within doors, especially at noon and after
> the angelus in the evening. On one occasion a woman, who scorned the
> warnings she had received, was carried off by Polednice in the form of
> a whirlwind, as she sat jn the harvest-field chatting with the
> reapers, to whom she had brought their dinner. Only after a year and a
> day was she permitted to return. \[l\]

> In some of the German and Bohemian tales a curious incident occurs.
> Beneath the Rollberg, near Niemes, in Bohemia, is a treasure-vault,
> the door of which stands open for a short time every Palm Sunday. A
> woman once found it open thus and entered with her child, There she
> saw a number of Knights Templars sitting round a table, gambling. They
> did not notice her; so she helped herself from a pile of gold lying
> near them, having first set down her child. Beside the gold lay a
> black dog, which barked from time to time. The woman knew that the
> third time it barked the door would close wherefore she hastened out.
> When she bethought her. self of the child it was too late: she had
> left it behind in her haste, and the vault was closed. The following
> year she returned at the hour when the door was open, and found the
> little one safe and sound, in either hand a fair red apple. Frequently
> in these tales a beautiful lady comes and ministers to the child
> during its mother's absence; at other times, a man. The treasure of
> King Darius is believed to be buried beneath the Sattelburg in
> Transylvania. A Wallachian woman, with her yearling babe in her arms,
> once found the door open and went in. There sat an old, long-bearded
> man, and about him stood chests full of silver and gold. She asked him
> if she might, take some of this treasure for herself. "Oh, yes,"
> answered he, "as much as you like." She put down the child and filled
> her skirts with gold, put the gold outside and re-entered. Having
> obtained permission, she filled and emptied her skirts a second time.
> But when she turned to enter a third time the door banged-to, and she
> was left outside. She cried out for her child, and wept--in vain. Then
> she made her way to the priest and laid her case before him. He
> advised her to pray daily for a whole year, and she would then get her
> child again. She carried out his injunction; and the following year
> she went again to the Sattelburg. The door was open, and she found the
> babe still seated in the chest where she had put it down. It was
> playing with a golden apple, which it held up to her, crying: "Look,
> mother, look!" The mother was astonished to hear it speak, and asked:
> "Whence hast thou that beautiful apple?" "From the old man, who has
> given me to eat too." The man was, however, no longer to be seen; and
> as the mother took her child and left the place, the door closed
> behind her. \[m\]

> But the most numerous, and assuredly the most weird and interesting,

> should go home now." Wang Chih accordingly proceeded to pick up his
> axe, but found that its handle had mouldered into dust; and on
> reaching home he became aware that not hours, nor days, but centuries
> had passed since he left it, and that no vestige of his kinsfolk
> remained. Another legend tells of a horseman who, riding over the
> hills, sees several old men playing a game with rushes. He ties his
> horse to a tree while he looks on at them. In a few minutes, as it
> seems to him, he turns to depart; but his horse is already a skeleton,

> Feasts in Fairyland occupy an unconscionable length of time. Walter

> spotted fawn-skin adorned his breast, but the lower part of his body
> was exposed and shaggy, and his legs degenerated into goat's feet.
> This queer little fellow declared himself very near akin to Herla,
> foretold that the king of the Franks was about to send ambassadors
> offering his daughter as wife to the king of the Britons, and invited
> himself to the wedding. He proposed a pact between them, that when he

> train of courtiers and servants, and numbers of precious gifts. The

> contain seven cities; and the adventurer was appointed by the king of

> asleep. When he came to himself again he was on board a homeward-bound

> reached Lisbon, but no one knew him. His ancestral mansion was
> occupied by others: none of his name had dwelt in it for many a year,
> He hurried to his betrothed, only to fling himself, not, as he
> thought, at her feet, but at the feet of his great-granddaughter. In
> cases like this the supernatural lapse of time may be conceived as
> taking place during the enchanted sleep, rather than during the
> festivities. According to a Coptic Christian romance, Abimelek, the.
> youthful favourite of King Zedekiah, preserved the prophet Jeremiah's
> life when he was thrown into prison, and afterwards persuaded his
> master to give him charge of the prophet, and to permit him to release

> captivity, and yet that he should not die. The sun should take care of
> him, the atmosphere nourish him; the earth on which he slept should
> give him repose, and he should taste of joy for seventy years until he
> should again see Jerusalem in its glory, flourishing as before.
> Accordingly, going out one day, as his custom was, into the royal
> garden to gather grapes and figs, God caused him to rest and fall
> asleep beneath the shadow of a rock. There he lay peacefully
> slumbering while the city was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar, and during
> the horrors of its capture and the whole of the seventy sad years that
> followed. When he awoke, it was to meet the prophet Jeremiah returning
> from the captivity, and he entered the restored city with him in
> triumph. But the seventy years had seemed to him but a few hours; nor

> was desolate, and saying: "How will God revive this after its death?"
> And God made him die for a hundred years. Then He raised him and
> asked: "How long hast thou tarried?" Said the man: "I have tarried a

> Here, perhaps, is a fitting place to mention the Happy Islands of
> Everlasting Life as known to Japanese tradition, though the story can
> hardly be said to belong to the type we have just discussed,--perhaps
> not strictly to any of the foregoing types. A Japanese hero, the wise

> returning to bring sure tidings of them. For, like St. Brendan's Isle
> in western lore, these islands may be visible for a moment and afar
> off to the seafarer, but a mortal foot has hardly ever trodden them.
> Vasobiove, however, in his boat alone, set sail from Nagasaki, and, in
> spite of wind and waves, landed on the green shore of Horaisan. Two
> hundred years he sojourned there; yet wist he not how long the period
> was, there where everything remained the same, where there was neither
> birth nor death, where none heeded the flight of time. With dance and
> music, in intercourse with wise men and lovely women, his days passed
> away. But at length he grew weary of this sweet round of existence: he
> longed for death--an impossible wish in a land where death was
> unknown. No poison, no deadly weapons were to be found To tumble down
> a chasm, or to fling oneself on sharp rocks was no more than a fall
> upon a soft cushion. If he would drown himself in the sea, the water
> refused its office, and bore him like a cork. Weary to death the poor
> Vasobiove could find no help. In this need a thought struck him: he
> caught and tamed a giant stork and taught him to carry him. On the
> back of this bird he returned over sea and land to his beloved Japan,
> bringing the news of the realm of Horaisan. His story took hold of the
> hearts of his fellow-countrymen; and that the story-tellers might
> never forget it, it has been emblazoned by the painters in a thousand
> ways. Nor can the stranger go anywhere in Japan without seeing the
> old, old man depicted on his stork and being reminded of his voyage to
> the Happy Islands. \[y\]
