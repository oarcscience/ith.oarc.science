> WE have in the preceding pages examined some of the principal groups
> of tales and superstitions relating to Fairies proper,--that is to
> say, the Elves and Fays of Celtic and Teutonic tradition.

> Dealing in the first instance with the sagas found in this country, or
> in Germany, our investigations have by no means ended there; for in
> order to understand these sagas, we have found occasion to refer again
> and again to the *märchen*, as well as the sagas, of other European
> nations,--nay, to the traditions of races as wide apart from our own
> in geographical position and culture, as the South Sea Islanders, the
> Amos, and the Aborigines of America. And we have found among peoples
> in the most distant parts of the globe similar stories and
> superstitions, Incidentally, too, we have learned something of the
> details of archaic practices, and have found the two great divisions
> of Tradition,--belief and practice,--inseparably interwoven,

> I do not pretend to have touched upon all the myths referring to
> Fairies, as thus strictly defined; and the Kobolds and Puck, the
> Household Spirits and Mischievous Demons, have scarcely been so much
> as mentioned. Want of space forbids our going further. It is hoped,
> however, that enough has been said, not merely to give the readers an
> idea of the Fairy Mythology correct as far as it goes, but, beyond
> that, to vindicate the method pursued in the investigation, as laid
> down in our second chapter, by demonstrating the essential identity of
> human imagination all over the world, and by tracing the stories with
> which we have been dealing to a more barbarous state of society and a
> more archaic plane of thought. It now remains, therefore, to recall
> what we have ascertained concerning the nature and origin of the
> Fairies, and briefly to consider two rival theories.

> We started from some of the ascertained facts of savage thought and
> savage life. The doctrine of Spirits formed our first proposition.
> This we defined to be the belief held by savages that man consists of
> body and spirit; that it is possible for the spirit to quit the body
> and roam at will in different shapes about the world, returning to the
> body as to its natural home; that in the, spirit's absence the body
> sleeps, and that it dies if the spirit return not; further, that the
> universe swarms with spirits embodied and disembodied, because
> everything in the world has a spirit, and all these spirits are
> analogues of the human spirit, having the same will and acting from
> the same motives; and that if by chance any of these spirits be
> ejected from its body, it may continue to exist without a body, or it
> may find and enter a new body, not necessarily such an one as it
> occupied before, but one quite different. The doctrine of
> Transformation was another of our premises: that is to say, the belief
> held by savages in the possibility of a change of form while
> preserving the same identity. A third premise was the belief in
> Witchcraft, or the power of certain persons to cause the
> transformations just mentioned, and to perform by means of spells, or
> symbolic actions and mystical words, various other feats beyond
> ordinary human power. And there were others to which I need not now
> refer, all of which were assumed to be expressed in the tales and
> songs, and in the social and political institutions, of savages. Along
> with these, we assumed the hypothesis of the evolution of civilization
> from savagery. By this I mean that just as the higher orders of animal
> and vegetable life have been developed from germs which appeared on
> this planet incalculable ages ago; so during a past of unknown length
> the civilization of the highest races of men has been gradually
> evolving through the various stages of savagery and barbarism up to
> what we know it to-day; and so every nation, no matter how barbarous,
> has arisen from a lower stage than that -. in which it is found, and
> is on its way, if left to its natural processes, to something higher
> and better. This is an hypothesis which does not, of course, exclude
> the possibility of temporary and partial relapses, such as we know
> have taken place in the history of every civilized country, any more
> than it excludes the possibility of the decay and death of empires;
> but upon the whole it claims that progress and not retrogression is
> the law of human society. The different stages of this progress have
> everywhere left their mark on the tales and songs, the sayings and
> superstitions, the social, religious and political institutions--in
> other words, on the belief and practice--of mankind.

> Starting from these premises, we have examined five groups, or cycles,
> of tales concerning the Fairy Mythology. We have found Fairyland very
> human in its organization. Its inhabitants marry, sometimes among
> themselves, sometimes into mankind. They have children born to them;
> and they require at such times female assistance. They steal children
> from men, and leave their own miserable brats in exchange; they steal
> women, and sometimes leave in their stead blocks of wood, animated by
> magical art, or sometimes one ol themselves. In the former case the
> animation does not usually last very long, and the women is then
> supposed to die. Their females sometimes in turn become captive to
> men. Unions thus formed are, however, not lasting, until the husband
> has followed the wife to her own home, and conquered his right to her
> afresh by some great adventure. This is not always in the story:
> presumably, therefore, not always possible. On the other hand, he who
> enters Fairyland and partakes of fairy food is spell-bound: he cannot
> return--at least for many years, perhaps for ever--to the land of men.
> Fairies are grateful to men for benefits conferred, and resentful for
> injuries. They never fail to reward those who do them a kindness; but
> their gifts usually have conditions attached, which detract from their
> value and sometimes become a source of loss and misery. Nor do they
> forget to revenge themselves on those who offend them; and to watch
> them, when they do not desire to be manifested, is a mortal offence.
> Their chief distinction from men is in their unbounded magical powers,
> whereof we have had several illustrations. They make things seem other
> than they are; they appear and disappear at will; they make long time
> seem short, or short time long; they change their own forms; they cast
> spells over mortals, and keep them spell-bound for ages.

> All these customs and all these powers are asserted of the Fairies
> properly so called. And when we look at the superstitions of other
> races than the Celts and Teutons, to which our inquiries have been
> primarily directed, we find the same things asserted of all sorts of
> creatures. Deities, ancestors, witches, ghosts, as well as animals of
> every kind, are endowed by the belief of nations all over the world
> with powers precisely similar to those of the Fairies, and with
> natures and social organizations corresponding with those of men.
> These beliefs can only be referred to the same origin as the fairy
> superstitions and all arise out of the doctrine of spirits, the
> doctrine of transformations, and the belief in witchcraft, held by
> savage tribes.

> But here I must, at the risk of some few repetitions, notice a theory
> on the subject of the Swan-maiden myth enunciated by Liebrecht. That
> distinguished writer, in his book on Folklore, devotes a section to
> the consideration of the group which has occupied us in the last two
> chapters, and maintains, with his accustomed wealth of allusion and
> his accustomed ingenuity, that some at least of the Swan-maidens are
> nothing more nor less than ghosts of the departed, rescued from the
> kingdom of darkness for a while, but bound to return thither after a
> short respite here with those wham they love. Now it is clear that if
> Swan-maiden tales are to be resolved into ghost stories, all other
> supernatural beings, gods and devils as well as fairies and ghosts,
> will turn out to be nothing but spectres of the dead. A summary of his
> argument, and of the reasons for rejecting it, will, therefore, not
> only fill up any serious gaps in our discussion of the main incidents
> of the myth in question; but it will take a wider sweep, and include
> the whole subject of the present volume.

> His argument, as I understand it, is based, first, on the terms of the
> taboo. The object of the taboo, he thinks, is to avoid any remark
> being made, any question being asked, any object being presented,
> which would remind these spirits of their proper home, and awaken a
> longing they cannot withstand to return. There is an old Teutonic
> legend of a knight who came in a little boat drawn by a swan to
> succour and wed a distressed lady, on whom he laid a charge never to
> ask whence he came, or in what country he was born. When she breaks
> this commandment the swan reappears and fetches him away. So the
> nightmare-wife, as we have seen, in one of the tales vanishes on being
> asked how she became a nightmare. Again, the fay of Argouges
> disappears on the name of Death being mentioned in her presence. A
> fair maiden in an Indian tale, who is found by the hero in the
> neighbourhood of a fountain, and bears the name of Bheki (Frog),
> forbids her husband ever to let her see water. When she is thirsty and
> begs him for water, the doom is fulfilled on his bringing it to her. A
> similar tale may be added from Ireland, though Liebrecht does not
> mention it. A man who lived near Lough Sheelin, in County Meath, was
> annoyed by having his corn eaten night after night. So he sat up -to
> watch; and to his astonishment a number of horses came up out of the
> lake driven by a most beautiful woman, whom he seized and induced to
> marry him. She made the stipulation that she was never to be allowed
> to see the lake again; and for over twenty years she lived happily
> with him, till one day she strolled out to look at the haymakers, and
> caught sight of the distant water. With a loud cry she flew straight
> to it, and vanished beneath the surface. \[a\]

> Liebrecht's next reason is based upon the place where the maiden is
> found,--a forest, or a house in the forest. In this connection he
> refers to the tavern, or drinking-shop, on the borders of the forest,
> where Wild Edric found his bride, and points to a variant of the
> story, also given by Walter Map, in which she is said, in so many
> words, to have been snatched from the dead. \[b\] The forest, he
> fancies, is the place of the dead, the underworld. Lastly, he gives
> numerous legends of the Middle Ages,--some of which found their way
> into the "Decameron," that great storehouse of floating tales, and
> other literary works of imagination, as well as into chronicles,--and
> instances from more modern folklore, wherein a mistress or wife dies,
> or seems to die, and is buried, yet is afterwards recovered from the
> tomb, and lives to wed, if a maiden, and to bear children. lie
> supports these by references to the vampire superstitions, and to the
> case of Osiris, who returned after death to Isis and became the father
> of Horus. And, following Uhland, he compares the sleepthorn, with
> which Odin pricked the Valkyrie, Brynhild, and so put her into a magic
> slumber, to the stake which was driven into the corpse suspected of
> being a vampire, to prevent its rising any more from the grave and
> troubling the living.

> Now it may be admitted that there is much that is plausible, much even
> that is true, in this theory. It might be urged in its behalf that (as
> we have had more than one occasion in the course of this work to know)
> Fairyland is frequently not to be distinguished from the world of the
> dead. Time is not known there; and the same consequences of permanent
> abode follow upon eating the food of the dead and the food of the
> fairies. Further, when living persons are stolen by fairies, mere dead
> images are sometimes left in their place. These arguments, and such as
> these, might well be added to Liebrecht's; and it would be hard to say
> that a formidable case was not made out. And yet the theory fails to
> take account of some rather important considerations. Perhaps the
> strongest point made--a point insisted on with great power--is that of
> the taboo. The case of the lady of Argouges is certainly very
> striking, though, taken by itself, it is far from conclusive. It might
> very well be that a supernatural being, in remaining here, would be
> obliged to submit to mortality, contrary perhaps to its nature; and to
> remind it of this might fill it with an irresistible impulse to fly
> from so horrible a fate. I do not say this is the explanation, but it
> is as feasible as the other. In the Spanish story it was not the
> utterance of the name of Death, but of a holy name--the name of
> Mary--which compelled the wife to leave her husband. Here she was
> unquestionably regarded by Spanish orthodoxy, not as a spirit of the
> dead, but as a foul fiend, able to assume what bodily form it would,
> but bound to none. The prohibition of inquiry as to the bride's former
> home may arise not so much from a desire to avoid the recollection, as
> from the resentment of impertinent curiosity, which we have seen
> arouses excessive annoyance in supernatural bosoms. The resentment of
> equally impertinent reproaches, or a reminiscence of savage etiquette
> that avoids the direct name, may account at least as well for other
> forms of the taboo. Liebrecht suggests most ingeniously that assault
> and battery must strike the unhappy elf still more strongly than
> reproaches, as a difference between her present and former condition,
> and remind her still more importunately of her earlier home, and that
> this explains the prohibition of the "three causeless blows." It may
> be. so, though there is no hint of this in the stories; and yet her
> former condition need not have been that of a ghost of the dead, nor
> her earlier home the tomb. By far the greater number of these stories
> represent the maiden as a water-nymph; but it is the depths of the
> earth rather than the water which are commonly regarded as the
> dwelling-place of the departed. Moreover, the correspondence I have
> tried to point out between the etiquette of various peoples and the
> taboo,--such, for instance, as the ban upon a husband's breaking into
> his wife's seclusion at a delicate moment in his family
> history,--would remain, on Liebrecht's theory, purely accidental. Nor
> would the theory account for the absence of a taboo in the lower
> savagery, nor for the totemistic character of the lady, nor, least of
> all, for the peltry which is the most picturesque, if not the most
> important, incident in this group of tales.

> In fact, the only direct evidence for Liebricht's contention is the
> variant of Wild Edric's legend alluded to by Map. His words are,
> speaking of Alnoth, Edric's son, a great benefactor of the see of
> Hereford: "The man whose mother vanished into air openly in the sight
> of many persons, being indignant at her husband's reproaching her that
> he had carried her off by force from among the dead (*quod eam a
> mortuis rapuisset*)." Upon this it is to be observed that the
> expression here made use of cannot be regarded as one which had
> accidentally dropped out of the narrative previously given; but it is
> an allusion to an independent and inconsistent version, given in
> forgetfulness that the writer had already in another part of his work
> related the story at large and with comments. There he had explicitly
> called Alnoth--the heir and offspring of a devil (*daemon*), and had
> expressed his wonder that such a person should have given up his whole
> inheritance (namely, the manor of Ledbury North, which he made over to
> the see of Hereford in gratitude for the miraculous cure of his palsy)
> to Christ in return for his restored health, and spent the rest of his
> life as a pilgrim. Medieval writers (especially ecclesiastics) were in
> a difficulty in describing fairies. They looked upon them as having an
> objective existence; and yet they knew not bow to classify them.
> Fairies were certainly neither departed saints nor holy angels. Beside
> these two kinds of spirits, the only choice left was between devils
> and ghosts of the wicked dead, or, at most, of the dead who had no
> claims to extraordinary goodness. They did not believe in any other
> creatures which could be identified with these mysterious elves. It is
> no wonder, therefore, if they were occasionally perplexed,
> occasionally inconsistent, sometimes denouncing them as devils, at
> other times dismissing them as ghosts. \[c\]

> This is what seems to have happened to Map. In the two chapters
> immediately preceding, he has given two legends illustrating each horn
> of the dilemma. One of these relates the marriage of Henno
> With-the-Teeth, who found a lovely maiden in a grove on the coast of
> Normandy. She was sitting alone, apparelled in royal silk, and
> weeping. Her beauty and her tears attracted the gallant knight, to

> about her father having brought her, all unwilling as she was, by sea
> to be married to the King of France; but having been driven by a storm
> on the shore, she said she had landed, and then her father had taken
> advantage of a sudden change of wind to sail away, leaving her to her
> fate. Henno was an easy conquest: he took her home and married her.
> Unluckily, however, he had a mother who had her suspicions. She
> noticed that her fair daughter-in-law, though she went often to
> church, always upon some trumpery excuse came late, so as to avoid
> being sprinkled with holy water, and as regularly left before the
> consecration of the elements. So this virtuous old vixen determined to
> watch one Sunday morning; and she discovered that after Henno had gone

> time upon his wife and her servant, and sprinkled them with holy
> water. Mistress and maid thereupon with a great yell bounded out
> through the roof and disappeared.

> Clearly these ladies were devils: no other creatures with self-respect

> is by no means the same plot as that of the stories recounted by
> Liebrecht in which the wife or the betrothed is rescued from the
> grave. Those stories, at least in warm climates where burials are
> hurried, and in rude ages when medical skill is comparatively
> undeveloped, are all within the bounds of possibility. There does not

> supernatural; and he would be a bold man who would deny that a
> substratum of fact may not underlie some of them. To establish their
> relationship with the group we are now considering, links of a much

> whatever his expression from the dead may point, is inconsistent with
> either the one or the other. Rather she was stolen from her own
> kindred, to become the wife of him who had won her by his own right
> arm.

> But a single instance, and that instance either inconsistent with the
> analogous traditions, or unable to supply a cogent or consistent
> explanation of them, is not a a very safe basis for a theory. What is
> it worth when it is inconsistent even with the theory itself? Indeed,
> if it were consistent with the theory, we might match it with another
> instance wholly irreconcilable. Mikáilo Ivanovitch in the Russian
> ballad marries a Swan-maiden, who, unlike some of the ladies just
> mentioned, insists upon being first baptized into the Christian faith.
> She makes the stipulation that when the one of them dies the other
> shall go living into the grave with the dead, and there abide for
> three months. She herself dies. Mikáilo enters the grave with her, and
> there conquers a dragon which comes to feast on the dead bodies. The
> dragon is compelled to fetch the waters of life and death, by means of
> which the hero brings his dead love back to life. Marya, the White
> Swan, however, proved herself so ungrateful that after awhile she took
> another husband, and twice she acted the part of Delilah to Mikáilo.
> The third time she tried it he was compelled in self-defence to put an
> end to her wiles by cutting off her head. This is honest, downright
> death. There is no mistaking it. But then it is impossible that Marya,
> the 'White Swan, was a mere ghost filched from the dead and eager to
> return. Yet the story of Marya is equally a Swan-maiden story, and is
> just as good to build a theory on as Map's variant of Wild Edric.
> \[d\]

> In replying, however, to the arguments of so learned and acute a
> writer as Liebrecht, it is not enough to point out these distinctions
> and inconsistencies: it is not enough to show that the terms of the
> taboo do not warrant the construction he has put upon them, nor that
> he has failed to account for very significant incidents. If he has
> mistaken the meaning of the legends, we should be able to make clear
> the source of his error. It arises, I hold, from an imperfect
> apprehension of the archaic philosophy underlying the narratives.
> Liebrecht's comparisons are, with one exception, limited to European
> variants. His premises were thus too narrow to admit of his making
> valid deductions. Perhaps even yet we are hardly in a position to do
> this; but at all events the sources of possible error are diminished
> by the wider area we are able to survey, and from the evidence of
> which we reason. We have compared the stories, both medieval and
> modern, mentioned by Liebrecht, with *märchen* and sagas told among
> nations outside European influence in various degrees of civilization,
> down to the savagery of Kaffirs and Dyaks. We have succeeded in
> classifying their differences, and in spite of them we have found all
> the tales in substantial agreement. They are all built on the same
> general plan; the same backbone of thought runs through them; and
> between them all there is no greater divergence than that which in the
> physical realm separates mammal from bird, or bird from reptile. It is
> inevitable to conclude that even the most recently discovered folktale
> of them has come to us from a distant period when our forefathers were
> in the same rude state as Dyaks and South Sea Islanders. No actual
> adventure of Wild Edric or Raymond of Lusignan gave rise to these
> stories. English patriot and Burgundian Count were only the names
> whereon they fastened,--the mountains which towered above the plain
> and gathered about their heads the vapours already floating in the
> atmosphere. We must therefore go back far beyond. the Middle Ages to
> learn in what manner we are to understand these stories,--back to the
> state of savagery whence the inhabitants of Europe had long emerged
> when Map and Gervase wrote, but of which the relics linger among us
> even yet.

> The necessarily meagre exposition of some of the most salient
> characteristics of savage thought with which we started has been
> illustrated and its outlines filled in to some extent in the course of
> the subsequent discussions. I need not, therefore, do more than draw
> attention as briefly as possible to those characteristics that are
> relevant here. First and foremost, we have found some of the
> Swan-maiden tales boldly professing to account for the worship of
> totems; and so thoroughly does totemism appear to be ingrained in the
> myth that there is some reason for thinking that here we have a clue
> to the myth's origin and meaning. But the intellect to which totemism
> is a credible theory draws no line of demarcation between humanity and
> the life and consciousness it recognizes in the whole encircling
> universe. To it, accordingly, a story of union between a man and a
> fish, a swan or a serpent, involves no difficulty. When advancing
> knowledge, and with knowledge repulsion from such a story, begins to
> threaten it, another belief, advances to its defence. For nothing is
> easier to creatures as clever as the lower animals than a change of
> form. They can, whenever they please, assume the appearance of man or
> woman: it is as natural to them as the shape under which they are
> usually seen. Again, the life that swarms about the savage philosopher
> does not always manifest itself visibly. It is often unseen. The world
> is filled with spirits, of whom some have inhabited human bodies,
> others have not. To the savage they are all alike; for those who have
> not hitherto inhabited human bodies may do so at will, or may inhabit
> other bodies, either animal or vegetable, and those who have once done
> so may do so again.

> All these--Totemism, the equality and essential identity of nature
> between man and all other objects in the universe, the doctrine of
> Transformation, the doctrine of Spirits--are phases of savage thought,
> every one. of which has been incorporated in the myth of the
> Swan-maidens, and every one of which, except one special and very
> limited development of the doctrine of Spirits, is ignored in
> Liebrecht's theory. The theory is, indeed, an admirable illustration
> of the danger of reasoning without a sufficiently wide area of
> induction. Liebrecht's mistake on the present occasion was twofold: he
> only dealt with one or, at most, two types of the myth; and he Ignored
> the savage variants. Had he taken into consideration other types--such
> as Hasan, the Marquis of the Sun, the Star's Daughter;--had he been
> aware of the savage variants all over the world, he would not have
> formed a theory so inconsistent with the facts, and so little fitted
> to solve the problems propounded, not merely by the phenomena of the
> Swan-maiden group, but by those of other tales in which supernatural
> beings intervene.

> In reasoning by induction, the greater the number of facts taken into
> account, the greater the probability of sound reasoning; and therefore
> the greater the number of facts a theory will explain, the more likely
> it is to be true. Had Liebrecht's theory touched only the Swan-maiden
> group, it would have .been more convenient to discuss it in the last
> chapter. But inasmuch as its truth would involve much wider issues, it
> seemed better to reserve it to be dealt with here. For if the theory
> be valid for Melusina, the Lady of the Van Pool, and other
> water-nymphs, it is valid also for the "water-woman" who, in a
> Transylvanian story, dwelt in a lake in the forest between Mehburg and
> Reps. She had two sons, whose father was a man, and the younger of
> whom became king of that land. But when the Saxon immigration took
> place the incomers cut down the wood; the lake dried up, and as it
> dried up, the lives of the water-spirit and her son gradually sank
> lower and lower, and at last were extinguished with the extinction of
> the lake. \[e\] Now I will venture to say that this story is to be
> explained satisfactorily on no theory yet broached, unless it be the
> theory that we have in it a survival of the savage doctrine of
> Spirits. Least of all it is to be explained by any adaptation of what
> I may call the Ghost theory,--namely, that the water-spirit and her
> son were already the spirits of dead human beings.

> Leaving this one example of the value of Liebrecht's theory, as
> applied to water-spirits, to stand for all, I turn to another order of
> beings with supernatural powers referred to several times in the
> foregoing pages: I mean Witches. I adduced in Chapter X. a Tirolese
> tale, a variant of the Melusina type, wherein the wife was a witch. It
> will have been obvious to every reader that the tale is simply that of
> Cupid and Psyche with the parts reversed; and I might urge that Cupid
> and the witch were beings of precisely the same nature. Waiving this
> for the moment, however, no one will deny that the witch takes the
> place of the Swan-maiden, or fairy, in other stories of the group. But
> perhaps it may be suggested that the name *witch* (*Angana, Hexe*) has
> got into the story by accident; and that not a witch in our sense of
> the word, but a ghost from the dead, is really meant. There might be
> something to be said for this if there were any substantial
> distinction to be made between ghosts and witches and fairies. In the
> tales and superstitions discussed in the present volume we have found
> no distinction. Whether it be child-stealing, transformation, midnight
> meetings, possession and gift of enchanted objects, spell-binding, or
> whatever function, or habit, or power be predicted of one, it will be
> found to be common\~ to the three. I conclude, therefore, that they
> are all three of the same nature. This is what a consideration of the
> superstitions of savages would lead me to expect. The belief in
> fairies, ghosts, and witches is a survival of those superstitions. It
> is, of course, not found in equal coherence, equal strength of all its
> parts, equal logic (if I may so express it) everywhere. We must not be
> surprised if, as it is gradually penetrated by the growing forces of
> civilization, it becomes fragmentary, and the attributes of these
> various orders of supernatural beings begin to be differentiated. They
> are never completely so; and the proof of this is that what is at one
> place, at one time, or by one people, ascribed to one order, is at
> another place, at another time, or by another people, ascribed to
> another order. The nature of the classical deities was identical too;
> and hence Cupid and the witch of the Tirolese tale are the masculine
> and feminine counterparts of the same conception.

> Lastly, a few words must be expended on a totally different theory
> lately put forward by Mr. MacRitchie. This theory is not altogether a
> new one; it has been before the world for many years. But Mr.
> MacRitchie has, first in "The Archaeological Review," and since then
> more elaborately in a separate book, entitled "The Testimony of
> Tradition," worked it out and fortified it with an array of arguments
> philological, historical, topographical, and traditional. He claims to
> have established that the fairies of the Celtic and Teutonic races are
> neither more nor less than the prehistoric tribes whom they conquered
> and drove back, and whose lands they now possess. He identifies these

> over in the form of seals, casting aside their sealskins when they
> landed. In this connection he relates how the Finn women were captured
> by taking possession of their sealskins, without which they could not
> get away from their captors. He also shows that illimitable riches and
> magical powers were ascribed to the Picts and to the Finns, and that
> the Lapps were pre-eminent in witchcraft.

> Gold Coast and among the Dyaks of Borneo. But Mr. MacRitchie ought to
> be very much astonished; for he can hardly show that the historical
> Finns were known in these out-of-the-way places. It seems to me
> natural to find that in Scotland and Ireland fairies dwelt in barrows,
> and in Annam and Arabia in hills and rocks; and that both in this
> country and in the far East they inveigled unhappy mortals into their
> dwellings and kept them for generations--nay, for centuries. That the
> Shoshone of California should dread their infants being changed by the
> Ninumbees, or dwarfs, in the same way as the Celts of the British
> Islands, and the Teutons too, dreaded their infants being changed,
> does not seem at all incredible to me. That to eat the food of the
> dead in New Zealand prevents a living man from returning to the land
> of the living, just as Persephone was retained in Hades by partaking
> of the pomegranate, and just as to eat the food of fairies hinders the
> Manx or the Hebrew adventurer from rejoining his friends on the
> surface of the earth, is in no way perplexing to me. But all these
> things, and they might be multiplied indefinitely, must be very
> perplexing to Mr. MacRitchie, if he be not prepared to prove that
> Annamites and Arabs, Hebrews and Shoshone, New Zealanders and
> classical Greeks alike, were acquainted with the Picts and the Finns,
> and alike celebrated them in their traditions.

> The truth Mr. MacRitchie does not reckon with is, that no theory will

> ingenious, his guesses, however amusing his philology, however

> Here then we must pause. Obvious are the differences between the,
> nations of mankind: differences of physical conformation,--that is to
> say, of race; divergences of mental and moral development,--that is to
> say, of civilization. Hitherto the task attempted by folklore has been

> and institutions and the equally absurd and impossible stories and
> beliefs found imbedded in the civilization of the more advanced
> nations are explicable, and explicable only, as relics of the phases
> where through those nations have passed from the depths of savagery.

> If it be admitted in general terms that the evidence collected and
