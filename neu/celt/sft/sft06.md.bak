> Changelings--a belief which I propose to examine in the present
> chapter. \[a\]

> By the belief in changelings I mean a belief that fairies and other
> imaginary beings are on the watch for young children, or (as we shall
> see hereafter) sometimes even for adults, that they may, if they can
> find them unguarded, seize and carry them off; leaving in their place
> one of themselves, or a block of wood animated by their enchantments
> and made to resemble the stolen person. Wise mothers take precautions
> against such thefts. These precautions are tolerably simple, and for
> the most part display the same general character. First and foremost
> among them is the rite of baptism, whereby the little one is admitted
> into the Christian Church. Faith in the efficacy of baptism as a
> protection from the powers hostile to man is not less strong among
> communities nominally Protestant than among Roman Catholics, and has
> doubtless operated to bring many children within the pale of the
> visible Church who might otherwise have been long in reaching that
> sacred enclosure. Examples of the belief in the power of baptism
> against the depredations of fairies could easily be cited from all
> Protestant countries. Without doing this, we may just pause to note
> that baptism was also reckoned a remedy for disease. This is doubtless
> a relic of the old creed which refers all human ailments to witchcraft
> and other spiritualistic origins. Mr. Henderson, speaking of the
> notion prevalent in the north of England that sickly infants never
> thrive until they are christened, relates a story communicated to him
> by a clergyman, within whose personal knowledge it had happened. He
> says: "The infant child of a chimney-sweeper at Thorne, in the West
> Riding of Yorkshire, was in a very weak state of health, and appeared
> to be pining away. A neighbour looked in, and inquired if the child
> had been baptized. On an answer being given in the negative, she
> gravely said, 'I would try having it christened.' The counsel was
> taken, and I believe with success." The same belief is found both in
> North and South Wales. It is also testified to by a Scottish
> clergyman, who moreover adduces the following conversation as
> illustrative of it and of "an undefinable sort of awe about unbaptized
> infants, as well as an idea of uncanniness in having them without
> baptism in the house," which is entertained among the labouring
> classes in the north-east of Scotland. "Oh, sir," said the wife of a
> working man to the minister, on asking him to baptize her child along
> with others, whose mothers were present, "this registration's the
> warst thing the queentry ever saw; it sud be deen awa' wee
> athegeethir!" "Why?" asked the minister, in astonishment at the
> woman's words and earnestness of manner. "It'll pit oot kirsnin
> athegeethir. Ye see the craitirs gets their names, an we jist think
> that aneuch, an' we're in nae hurry sennin for you." How far, as this
> anecdote dimly suggests, it was the giving of a name which was
> supposed to protect a child, I cannot say: more probably it was the
> dedication to God involved in baptism. This is countenanced by the
> precaution said to have been observed in Nithsdale when a pretty child
> was born to consecrate it to God, and sue for its protection by
> "taking the Beuk" and other acts of prayer and devotion. \[b\]

> Putting aside such ceremonies as these which may be supposed
> distinctly Christian, there were other charms looked upon as
> efficacious. Thus in Scotland it was deemed highly judicious to keep
> an open Bible always near a child, and even to place the holy volume
> beneath the head of a woman in labour. In some parts of Germany it is
> enough to lay a single leaf out of a Bible or prayer-book in the
> cradle, until by the baptism of the infant the danger of robbery
> passes away; and a prayer-book is also placed under the pillow of the
> newly-made mother, who is at that time specially liable to fall under
> the power of the underground folk. Indeed a prayer-book, or the mere
> repetition of a Paternoster, is equally valuable with a Bible for
> these purposes; and if, by the neglect of any of these precautions, an
> opportunity be given to the foe, the child may yet be saved by the
> utterance of the name of Jesus Christ at the moment when the change is
> being effected. Holy water and the sign of the cross, in Ireland, or a
> rosary blessed by a priest, in Picardy, enjoy a similar reputation.
> \[c\]

> All these means of prevention are veneered with some sort of
> Christianity; but there are others which display Heathenism naked and
> unblushing. While a child in Mecklenburg remains unbaptized it is
> necessary to burn a light in the chamber. Nor is the superstition
> confined to one district: it is common all over Germany and Denmark;
> it was once common in England; it is found in Ireland; it is found
> among the Lithuanians on the shores of the Baltic; it was practised by
> the ancient Romans, and appears to be a relic of the sacred character
> anciently imputed to fire. In the island of Lewis fire used to be
> carried round women before they were churched and children before they
> were christened, both night and morning; and this was held effectual
> to preserve both mother and infant from evil spirits, and (in the case
> of the infant) from being changed. The Sad Dar, one of the sacred
> books of the Parsees, contains directions to keep a continual fire in
> the house during a woman's pregnancy, and after the child is born to
> burn a lamp for three nights and days--a fire, indeed, is declared to
> be better--"so that the demons and fiends may not be able to do any
> damage and harm." By way of enforcing this precept we are told that
> when Zoroaster was born, a demon came at the head of a hundred and
> fifty other demons, every night for three nights, to slay him, but
> they were put to flight by seeing the fire, and were consequently
> unable to hurt him. \[d\]

> Iron or steel, in the shape of needles, a key, a knife, a pair of
> tongs, an open pair of scissors, or in any other shape, if placed in
> the cradle, secured the desired end. In Bulgaria a reaping-hook is
> placed in a corner of the room for the same purpose. I shall not stay
> now to discuss the reason why supernatural beings dread and dislike
> iron. The open pair of scissors, however, it should be observed, has
> double power; for it is not only of the abhorred metal,--it is also in
> form a cross. The use of the cross in baptism was probably one of the
> reasons for the efficacy of that rite against felonious fairies. At
> all events, over a very wide area the cross is thought a potent
> protection; nor is the belief by any means confined to Christian
> lands. Mr. MitchellInnes tells us that the fear of changelings exists
> in China. "To avert the calamity of nursing a demon, dried banana-skin
> is burnt to ashes, which are then mixed with water. Into this the
> mother dips her finger and paints a cross upon the sleeping babe's
> forehead. In a short time the demon soul returns--for the soul wanders
> from the body during sleep and is free--but, failing to recognize the
> body thus disguised, flies off. The true soul, which has been waiting
> for an opportunity, now approaches the dormant body, and, if the mark
> has been washed off in time, takes possession of it; but if not, it,
> like the demon, failing to recognize the body, departs, and the child
> dies in its sleep." \[e\] How to hit the exact moment between the
> flight of the demon and the advent of the true soul doubtless puzzles
> many a Chinese mother fully as much as the cross puzzles the two
> competing souls. But when she is successful she baffles the evil
> spirit by deceit, of which the cross is made the instrument; though we
> may well believe that the child is not disguised in this way without
> reference to the cross's inherent sanctity; for it is a religious
> symbol among nations who never heard the gospel of the Crucified.

> Spirits whose baleful influences are feared by man are happily easily
> tricked. To this guilelessness on their part must be attributed
> another strange method of defeating their evil designs on children. It
> appears to be enough to lay over the infant, or on the bed beside the
> mother, a portion of the father's clothes. A shepherd's wife living
> near Selkirk was lying in bed one day with her new-born boy at her
> side, when she heard a sound of talking and laughter in the room.
> Suspecting what turned out to be the case, she seized in great alarm
> her husband's waistcoat, which was lying at the foot of the bed, and
> flung it over herself and the child. The fairies, for it was they who
> were the cause of the noise, set up a loud scream, crying out: "Auld
> Luckie has cheated us o' our bairnie!" Soon afterwards the woman heard
> something fall down the chimney, and looking out she saw a waxen
> effigy of her baby, stuck full of pins, lying on the hearth. The
> would-be thieves had meant to substitute this for the child. When her
> husband came home he made up a large fire and threw the doll upon it;
> but, instead of burning, the thing flew up the chimney amid shouts of
> laughter from the unseen visitors. The suggestion seems to be that the
> sight of the father's clothes leads "the good people" to think that he
> himself is present watching over his offspring. Some articles of
> clothing, however, seem to have special virtue, such as a right
> shirt-sleeve or a left stocking, though wherefore is not very clear;
> and in China, about Canton, a fisherman's net is employed with as
> little apparent reason. In Sweden the babe is wrapped in red cloth,
> which we may be allowed to conjecture is intended to cozen the fairies
> by simulating fire. \[f\]

> Moreover, certain plants are credited with a similar gift. In Germany
> orant (whatever that may be), blue marjoram, and black cumin; and in
> Denmark garlic--nasty enough surely to keep any beings off--and bread
> are used. The Danes, too, place salt in the cradle or over the door.
> The Italians fear not only fairies who rob them of their children, but
> also witches who tear the faces of unbaptized infants. These are both
> old superstitions, dating in one form or other from classic times. To
> baulk the witches of their prey it is in some places customary to keep
> a light burning in the chamber at night, and to affix at the door of
> the house the image of a saint, hanging to it a rosary and an
> unravelled napkin; while behind the door are put a jar full of salt
> and a brush. A two-fold defence is thus built up; for the witch,
> beholding the image of the saint and the rosary, will straightway
> retire; or if these fail to warn her off she will on entering be
> compelled to count the grains of salt, the broken threads of the
> napkin, and the twigs of the brush--a task that will keep her occupied
> from midnight, when at the earliest she can dare appear, until dawn,
> when she must slink away without having been able to attain her
> object. Among the Greeks witches are believed to have great power.
> They seek new born babes to suck their blood or to prick them to death
> with sharp instruments. Often they inflict such injuries that a child
> remains for ever a cripple or an invalid. The Nereids of the fountains
> and springs are also on the watch "to exchange one of their own
> fractious offspring for a mortal babe." Constant watchfulness, and
> baptism as soon as the Church permits it, are therefore necessary. In
> England it seems to have been held in former days that witches stole
> children from their cradles before baptism to make an oil or unguent
> by boiling them to a jelly. A part of this jelly they used to drink,
> and with the remainder they rubbed their bodies. This was the orthodox
> means of acquiring magical powers. It is a Sicilian belief that the
> hands of unbaptized children are used by witches in their sorceries.
> \[g\]

> As we might expect, the reason why unbaptized babes are held to be so
> liable to these attacks is that until the initiatory rite has been
> performed they are looked upon as heathen, and therefore peculiarly
> under the dominion of evil spirits. In Sicily and in Spain an infant
> until baptism is called by the opprobrious epithets of Pagan, Turk,
> Moor, Jew. Even women will not kiss it, for to kiss a Moor, at all
> events in Spain, is sin; though, on the other hand, to kiss an
> unbaptized child, if no one else have kissed it, is sovereign against
> toothache. By the Greeks these little innocents are regarded not
> merely as not Christians, but as really less human than demoniac in
> their nature. This is said, indeed, to be the teaching of the Church.
> The lower classes, at least (and, presumably therefore, not long ago
> the upper classes) believe it firmly; so that an unbaptized babe is
> called Drakos (feminine, Drakoula), that is to say, serpent or dragon.
> This is the same opprobrious title that we found Gervase of Tilbury
> applying to the evil spirits infesting the waters of the Rhone; and we
> cannot doubt that it is intended to convey an imputation of Satanic
> nature. \[h\] The extent of this superstition would form an
> interesting subject of inquiry. If it could be established as existing
> now or formerly among other Christian nations (and the superstitions
> of Sicily and Spain just cited point to this) it would help to clear
> up much of the difficulty surrounding the subject of changelings,
> especially the motives actuating both fairies and witches in their
> depredations. And, as infant baptism is by no means exclusively a
> Christian rite, research among heathen nations would be equally
> pertinent.

> Meanwhile the motive usually assigned to fairies in northern stories
> is that of preserving and improving their race, on the one hand by
> carrying off human children to be brought up among the elves and to
> become united with them, and on the other hand by obtaining the milk
> and fostering care of--human mothers for their own offspring. Doubts
> have been expressed by the German poet and mythologist, Karl Simrock,
> whether this was the primitive motive. He suggests that originally
> these spirits were looked upon as wholly beneficent\~ and even the
> theft of children was dictated by their care for the best interests of
> mankind. Nor does he hesitate to lay it down that the selfish designs
> just mentioned were first attributed to them when with growing
> enlightenment the feeling manifested itself that the kindly beings
> were falling into decay. \[i\]

> It might be sufficient to reply that no spiritual existences imagined
> by men in a state of civilization such as surrounded our Celtic and
> Teutonic forefathers were ever regarded as unswervingly benevolent:
> caprice and vindictiveness, if not cruelty, are always elements of
> their character. Beyond this general consideration, however, there is
> a further and conclusive answer in the fact that there is no warrant
> in tradition for the supposition that could we penetrate to the oldest
> strata of mythical belief we should not discover selfish designs
> imputed to "the good people." The distinguished commentator himself is
> bound to admit that the belief in their need of human help is entwined
> in the very roots of the Teutonic myths. It is, indeed, nothing but
> the medieval and Teutonic form of tenets common to all the nations
> upon earth. The changeling superstition and the classic stories of
> children and adults beloved by gods of high and low degree are
> consistent with this belief, and inseparable from it. The motive is so
> far comprehensible: what is wanted is to know whether any special
> relations, such as are pointed at by the Greek epithet *Drakos*, were
> held to exist between the mysterious world and newly-born babes which
> would render the latter more obnoxious to attack than elder children
> or adults; or whether, as I have put it at the beginning of this
> chapter, their helplessness alone suggested their exceeding danger. To
> solve the riddle we must wait for a larger accumulation of documents.

> But in the best regulated families it is not always possible to
> prevent the abduction from being attempted, and sometimes
> accomplished, in spite of every precaution. One night a Welsh woman,
> waking in a fright in her husband's absence, missed her baby. She
> sought for it and caught it upon the boards above the bed: the fairies

> proceedings of two *laumes*, or elves. They stealthily fetch out of
> the bedroom the new-born babe and swathe it in swaddling clothes of
> their own, while they wrap in its clothes the oven-broom. Then they
> began to quarrel which of them should carry the broom thus rolled up
> into the bedroom; and as they were unable to agree they resolved to
> carry it together. No sooner had they disappeared into the inner
> apartment than the boy leaped out of bed, picked up his mistress'
> child and took it into his own bed. When the laumes returned the
> infant was not to be found. They were both very angry and began to
> scold one another: "It's your fault." "No, it's your fault; didn't I
> say, You carry it, while I stay here and keep watch? I said it would
> be stolen! " While they wrangled thus, kakary ku! crew the cock, and,
> foiled and enraged, they had to make off. The boy had great difficulty

> dream that a stock of wood had been placed on her breast so that she
> could hardly breathe. He told her what had happened, but she would not
> believe it until she saw that she had *two* children--one to which she
> had given birth, the other fashioned out of the oven-broom. \[l\]

> Prayer and the utterance of a holy name are to the full as effectual

> were left without further molestation. A curious tale is told of two
> Strathspey smugglers who were one night laying in a stock of whiskey
> at Glenlivat when they heard the child in the cradle give a piercing
> cry, just as if it had been shot. The mother, of course, blessed it;
> and the Strathspey lads took no further notice, and soon afterwards
> went their way with their goods. Before they had gone far they found a
> fine healthy child lying all alone on the roadside, and recognized it
> as their friend's. They saw at once how the affair stood. The fairies
> had taken away the real infant and left a stock; but owing to the
> pious ejaculation of the mother, they had been forced to drop it. As
> the urgency of their business did not admit of their return they took
> the child with them, and kept it until they went to Glenlivat again.
> On their arrival here they said nothing about the child, which they
> kept concealed. In the course of conversation the woman remarked that
> the disease which had attacked the little one the last time they were
> there had never left it, and she had now scarce any hope of its
> recovery. As if to confirm her statement, it continued uttering most
> piercing cries. The smugglers thereupon produced the real babe healthy
> and hearty, and told her how they had found it. The mother was, of
> course, pleased to recover it; and the next thing was to dispose of
> the changeling. For this purpose the Strathspey lads got an old creel
> to put him in and some straw to light under it. Seeing the serious
> turn matters were likely to take he resolved not to await the trial,
> but flew up the smoke-hole and cried out from the top that but for the
> guests events would have gone very differently. \[m\]

> Two pixies of Dartmoor, in the shape of large bundles of rags, led
> away one of two children who were following their mother homeward. It
> was eventually found, on a search being made by the neighbours with
> lanterns, under a certain large oak tree known to be pixy-haunted.
> This is hardly a changeling story, as no attempt was made to foist a
> false child on the parent. A tale from the Isle of Man contains two
> similar incidents of attempted robbery without replacing the stolen
> child by one of superhuman birth. The fairies there adopted artifices
> like those of the North German dwarfs above mentioned. A few nights
> after a woman had been delivered of her first child a cry of fire was
> raised, and every one ran out of the house to see whence it proceeded,
> leaving the helpless mother alone with her babe. On returning they
> found the infant lying on the threshold of the house. The following
> year, when another little stranger had presented itself, a noise was
> heard in an out-house among the cattle. Again everybody that was
> stirring, including the nurse, hurried forth to learn what was the
> matter, believing that the cattle had got loose. But finding all safe,
> they came back, only to discover that the new-born babe had been taken
> out of bed, as the former had been, and on their coming dropped in the
> middle of the entry. It might have been supposed that these two
> warnings would have been enough; but a third time the trick was
> played, and then more successfully. Forgetting what had previously
> happened, all who were in the house ran out one night on hearing a
> noise in the cow-house--all, that is, except the mother, who could not
> move, and the nurse, who was sleeping off the effects of alcohol. The
> former was lying broad awake and saw her child lifted from the bed by
> invisible hands and carried clean away. She shrieked at once to the
> nurse, but failed to arouse her; and when her husband returned, an
> infant was indeed lying beside her, but a poor, lean, withered,
> deformed creature, very different from her own. It lay quite naked,
> though the clothes of the true child had been considerately left for
> it by the ravishers. \[n\]

> One of the difficulties experienced by the fairies on two of the three
> occasions here narrated in making off with the little one occurred at
> the door of the house. That they should have tried, repeatedly at all
> events, to pass out that way is almost as remarkable as that they
> should have been permitted more than once to attempt the theft. For
> the threshold is a part of the dwelling which from of old has been
> held sacred, and is generally avoided by uncanny beings. Wiser, though
> still doomed to failure, were those Irish elves who lifted up a window
> and handed the infant out. For, it happened that a neighbour who was
> coming to pay a visit that moment stopped before the house, and
> exclaimed: "God keep all here from harm!" No sooner had-she uttered
> the words than she saw the child put forth, how, or by whom, she did
> not know; and without hesitation she went up and took it away home
> with her. The next morning when she called to see how her friend fared
> great was the moan made to her over the behaviour of the child--so
> different from what it had ever been before--crying all the night and
> keeping awake its mother, who could not quiet it by any means. "I'll
> tell you what you'll do with the brat," she replied; "whip it well
> first, and then bring it to the cross-roads, and leave the fairy in
> the ditch there for any one to take that pleases; for I have your
> child at home safe and sound as he was handed out of the window last
> night to me." When the mother heard this, she just stepped out to get
> a rod; but before she returned the changeling had vanished, and no one
> either saw or heard of it again. \[o\]

> Fairies, however, when bent upon mischief, are not always baulked so
> easily. They effect the exchange, sometimes in the house, and
> sometimes when the parent is at work in the fields and incautiously
> puts her offspring down the while. In these circumstances, grievous as
> may be the suspicion arising from the changed conduct of the nursling,
> it is not always easy to be sure of what has taken place. Tests,
> therefore, have to be applied. Often the appearance is enough. A
> "mighty big head," or an abnormally thick head and neck, is in Germany
> deemed sufficient credentials from Fairyland; while in a case from
> Lapland, where the hand and foot grew so rapidly as to become speedily
> nearly half an ell in length and the child was unable to learn to
> speak, whereas she readily understood what was said to her, these
> deviations from the course of nature were looked upon as conclusive
> evidence. \[p\] A reputed changeling shown to Waldron in the Isle of
> Man early in the last century is thus described: "Nothing under heaven
> could have a more beautiful face; but though between five and six
> years old, and seemingly healthy, he was so far from being able to
> walk, or stand, that he could not so much as move any one joint; his
> limbs were vastly long for his age, but smaller than an infant's of
> six months; his complexion was perfectly delicate, and he had the
> finest hair in the world; be never spoke, nor cried, eat scarce
> anything, and was very seldom seen to smile, but if any one called him
> a fairy-elf, he would frown and fix his eyes so earnestly on those who
> said it, as if he would look them through. His mother, or at least his
> supposed mother, being very poor, frequently went out a-charing, and
> left him a whole day together. The neighbours, out of curiosity, have
> often looked in at the window to see how he behaved when alone, which,
> whenever they did, they were sure to find him laughing and in the
> utmost delight. This made them judge that he was not without company
> more pleasing to him than any mortal's could be; and what made this
> conjecture seem the more reasonable was, that if he were left ever so
> dirty, the woman at her return saw him with a clean face, and his hair
> combed with the utmost exactness and nicety." \[q\] Luther tells us
> that he saw and touched at Dessau a changed child which was twelve
> years of age. The account he gives of the child is that "he had his
> eyes and all members like another child; he did nothing but feed, and
> would eat as much as two clowns or threshers were able to eat. When
> one touched it, then it cried out. When any evil happened in the
> house, then it laughed and was joyful; but when all went well, then it
> cried and was very sad." So much for the Reformer's testimony of what
> he saw and was told. His theories and generalizations are in their way
> not less interesting than his testimony: as might have been expected,
> they are an adaptation of the ordinary superstitions to his own grim
> scheme of things. "Such changelings and killcrops," he goes on to say,
> "*supponit Satan in locum verorum filiorum*; for the devil hath this
> power, that he changeth children, and instead thereof layeth devils in
> the cradles, which thrive not, only they feed and suck: but such
> changelings live not above eighteen or nineteen years. It sometimes
> falleth out that the children of women in child-bed are thus changed,
> and Devils laid in their stead, one of which more fouleth itself than
> ten other children do, so that the parents are much therewith
> disquieted; and the mothers in such sort are sucked out, that
> afterwards they are able to give suck no more." \[r\]

> Making allowance for the influence of imagination, there can be no
> doubt, on comparison of these passages, that the children to whom the
> character of changelings was ascribed were invariably deformed or
> diseased. The delightful author of the "Popular Romances of the West
> of England" says that some thirty or forty years before the date of
> writing he had seen several reputed changelings. And his evidence is
> express that "in every case they have been sad examples of the
> influence of mesenteric disease." After describing their external
> symptoms, he adds: "The wasted frame, with sometimes strumous
> swellings, and the unnatural abdominal enlargement which accompanies
> disease of mesenteric glands, gives a very sad, and often a most
> unnatural, appearance to the sufferer." Professor Rhys' description of
> a reputed changeling, one Ellis Bach, of Nant Gwrtheyrn, in
> Carnarvonshire, is instructive as showing the kind of being accredited
> among the Welsh with fairy nature. The professor is repeating the
> account given to him of this poor creature, who died nearly half a

> who had been imprisoned as a suspect under the then latest Coercion
> Act. When this patriot was a boy he had been stolen by the fairies,
> one of themselves having been left in his place The parish priest,
> however, interfered; and by a miracle he caused the elf for a moment
> to disappear, and the boy to return to tell him the conditions on
> which his captivity might be ended. The information given, the goblin
> again replaced the true son; but the good priest was now able to deal
> effectually with the matter. The imp was accordingly dipped thrice in
> Lough Lane (a small lake in the eastern part of Westmeath), when "a
> curl came on the water, and up from the deep came the naked form of
> the boy, who walked on the water to meet his father on shore. The
> father wrapped his overcoat about his son, and commenced his homeward

> and almost dead. More usually the story relates that a piece of wood
> is carved in the likeness of the lady and laid in her place, the

> whom he had been tenderly attached. One morning he declared to the
> minister that she had appeared to him the previous night, stating that
> she was a captive in Fairyland, and begged him to attempt her
> deliverance. The mode she prescribed was to bring the minister and
> certain others to her grave at midnight to dig up her body, and recite
> certain prayers, after which the corpse would become animated and flee
> from him. It was to be pursued by the swiftest runner in the parish,
> and if he could catch it before it had encircled the church thrice,
> the rest were to come to his help and hold it notwithstanding its
> struggles, and the shapes into which it might be transformed. In this
