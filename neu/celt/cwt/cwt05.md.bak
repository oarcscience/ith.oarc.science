How the Son of The Gobhaun Saor Shortened the Road

<span id="img_16"></span> ![](img/16.jpg)

  
<span id="img_25"></span> ![](img/25.jpg)NE day the Son of the Gobhaun
Saor was sitting outside in the sunshine, cutting a little reed into a
pipe to make music with. He was so busy that he never saw three
stranger-men coming till they were close to him. He looked up then and
saw three thrawn-faced churls wrapped in long cloaks. "Good morrow to
you," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor. "Good morrow," said they. "We
have come to say a word to the Son of the Gobhaun Saor." "He is before
you," said the Son. "We have come," said the most thrawn-faced of the
three, "from the King of the Land Under Wave to ask you to help him; he
has a piece of work that none of his own people can do, and you have the
cleverness of the Three Worlds in your fingers." "'Tis my father has
that," said the Son of the Gobhaun Saor. "Well," said the other, "bring
your father with you to the Land Under Wave and your fortune's made."

The Son of the Gobhaun Saor set off at that to find his father. "I have
the news of the world for you and your share of fortune out of it," he
said. "What news? " said the Gobhaun. "The King of the Land Under Wave
has sent for me; if you come with me your fortune is made." "Did he send
you a token?" "No token at all, but do you think I would not know his
messengers? " "O, 'tis you has the cleverness!" said the Gobhaun Saor.

They set out next morning, and as they were going along, the Gobhaun
Saor said: "Son, shorten the way for me." "How could I do that? " said
the Son, "if your own two feet can't shorten it." "Now, do you think,"
said the father, "that you'll make my fortune and your own too when you
can't do a little thing like that!" and he went back to the house.

The Son sat down on a stone with his head on his hands to think how he
could shorten the road, but the more he thought of it the harder it
seemed, and after a while he gave up thinking and began to look round
him. He saw a wide stretch of green grass and an old man spreading out
locks of wool on it. The old man was frail and bent, and he moved slowly
spreading out the wool. The Son of the Gobhaun Saor thought it hard to
see the old man working, and went to help him, but when he came nearer a
little wind caught the wool and it lifted and drifted, and he saw it
wasn't wool at all but white foam of the sea. The old man straightened
himself, and the Son of the Gobhaun Saor knew it was Mananaun the
Sea-God, and he stood with his eyes on the sea-foam and had nothing to
say. "You came to help me," said Mananaun. "I did," said the Son of the
Gobhaun Saor, "but you need no help from me." "The outstretched hand,"
said Mananaun, "is the hand that is filled the fullest; stoop now and
take a lock of my wool, it will help you when you need help." The Son of
the Gobhaun Saor stooped to the sea-foam; the wind was blowing it, and
under the foam he saw the blue of the sea clear as crystal, and under
that a field of red flowers bending with the wind. He took a handful of
foam. It became a lock of wool, and when he raised himself Mananaun was
gone, and there was nothing before him but the greenness of grass and
the sun shining on it.

He went home then and showed the lock of wool to his wife and told her
the sorrow he was in because he couldn't shorten the road for his
father. " Don't be in sorrow for that," said she, "sure every one knows
that storytelling is the way to shorten a road." "May wisdom grow with
you like the tree that has the nuts of knowledge! " said he. "I'll take
your advice, and maybe to-morrow my father won't turn back on the road."

They set out next day and the Gobhaun Saor said--" Son, be shortening
the road." At that the Son began the story of Angus Oge and how he won a
house for himself from the Dagda Mor: it was a long story, and he made
it last till they came to the White Strand.

When they got there they saw a clumsy ill-made boat waiting for them,
with ugly dark-looking men to row it.

"Since when," said the Gobhaun Saor, "did the King of the Land Under
Wave get Fomorians to be his rowers, and when did he borrow a boat from
them?" The Son had no word to answer him, but the ugliest of the
ill-made lot came up to them with two cloaks in his hand that shone like
the sea when the Sun strikes lights out of it. "These cloaks," said he,
"are from the Land Under Wave; put one about your head, Gobhaun Saor,
and you won't think the boat ugly or the journey long." "What did I tell
you? " said the Son when he saw the cloaks. "You have your own asking of
a token, and if you turn back now in spite of the way I shortened the
road for you, I'll go myself and I'll have luck with me." "I'll go with
you," said the Gobhaun Saor; he took the cloaks and they stepped into
the boat. He put one round his head the way he wouldn't see the ugly
oarsmen, and the Son took the other.

As they were coming near land the Gobhaun Saor looked out from the
cloak, and when he saw the place he pulled the cloak from his Son's head
and said: "Look at the land we are coming to." It was a dark, dreary,
death-looking country without grass or trees or sun in the sky. "I'm
thinking it won't take long to spend the fortune you'll make here," said
the Gobhaun Saor, "for this is not the Land Under Wave but the country
of Balor of the Evil Eye, the King of the Fomorians." He stood up then
and called to the chief of the oarsmen: "You trapped us with lies and
with cloaks stolen from the Land Under Wave, but you'll trap no one else
with the cloaks," and he flung them into the sea. They sank at once as
if hands pulled them down. "Let them go back to their owners," said the
Gobhaun Saor.

The Fomorians ground their teeth and cursed with rage, but they were
afraid to touch the Gobhaun or his Son because Balor wanted them; so
they guarded them carefully and brought them to the King. He was a big
mis-shapen giant with a terrible eye that blasted everything, and he
lived in a great dun made of glass as smooth and cold as ice. "You are a
fire-smith and a wonder-smith, and your Son is a wise man," he said to
the Gobhaun. "I have brought the two of you here to put fire under a pot
for me." "That is no hard task," said the Gobhaun. "Show me the pot." "I
will," said Balor, and he brought them to a walled-in place that was
guarded all round by warriors. Inside was the largest pot the Gobhaun
Saor had ever laid eyes on; it was made of red bronze riveted together,
and it shone like the Sun. "I want you to light a fire under that pot,"
said Balor." "None of my own people can light a fire under it, and every
fire over which it is hung goes out. Your choice of good fortune to you
if you put fire under the pot, and clouds of misfortune to you if you
fail, for then neither yourself nor your Son will leave the place
alive."

"Let every one go out of the enclosure but my Son and myself," said the
Gobhaun Saor, "until we see what power we have." They went Out, and when
the Gobhaun Saor got the place to himself he said to the Son: "Go round
the pot from East to West, and I will go round from West to East, and
see what wisdom comes to us." They went round nine times, and then the
Gobhaun Saor said: "Son, what wisdom came to you? " "I think," said the
Son, "this pot belongs to the Dagda Mor." "There is truth on your
tongue," said the Gobhaun, "for it is the Cauldron of Plenty that used
to feed all the men of Ireland at one time, when the Dagda had it, and
every one got out of it the food he liked best. It was by stealth and
treachery the Fomorians got it, and that is why they cannot put fire
under it." With that he let a shout to the Fomorians: "Come in now, for
I have wisdom on me." "Are you going to light the fire," said the Son,
"for the robbers that have destroyed Ireland?" "Whist," said the Gobhaun
Saor; "who said I was going to light the fire? " "Tell Balor," he said
to the Fomorians that came running in, "that I must have nine kinds of
wood freshly gathered to put under the pot and two stones to strike fire
from. Get me boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine
tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the
hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn, and a branch of bog
myrtle; and bring me a white stone from the door step of a Brugh-fer,
and a black stone from the door step of a poet that has the nine golden
songs, and I will put *fire* under the pot."

They ran to Balor with the news, and he grew black with rage when he
heard it. "Where am I to get boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash,
boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the
blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the
white-thorn and a branch of bog myrtle in a country as barren as the
grave? " said he. "What poet of mine knows any songs that are not
satires or maledictions, and what Brugh-fer have I who never gave a
meal's meat to a stranger all my life? Let him tell us," said Balor,
"how the things are to be got?" They went back to the Gobhaun Saor then
and asked how the things were to be got. " It is hard," said the
Gobhaun, "to do anything in a country like this, but since you have none
of the things, you must go to the Land of the De Danaans for them. Let
Balor's Son and his Sister's Son go to my house in Ireland and ask the
woman of the house for the things."

Balor's Son set out and the Son of Balor's Sister with him. Balor's
Druids sent a wind behind them that swept them into the country of the
De Danaans like a blast of winter. They came to the house of the Gobhaun
Saor, and the wife of the Son came out to them. "O Woman of the House,"
said they, "we have a message from the Gobhaun Saor." He is to light a
fire for Balor, and he sent us to ask you for boughs of the oak, boughs
of the ash, boughs of the pine tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of
the blackthorn, boughs of the hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the
whitethorn and a branch ot bog myrtle. "You are to give us," he said, "a
white stone from the door step of a Brugh-fer, and a black stone from
the door step of a poet that has the nine golden songs."

"A good asking," said the woman, "and welcome before you!" "Let the Son
of Balor come into the secret chamber of the house." He came in, and she
said: "Show me the token my man gave you." Now, Balor's Son had no
token, but he wouldn't own to that, so he brought out a ring and said:
"Here is the token." The woman took it in her hand, and when she touched
it she knew that it belonged to Balor's Son, and she went out of the
room from him and locked the door on him with seven locks that no one
could open but herself.

She went to the other Fomorian then and said: " Go to Balor and tell him
I have his Son, and he will not get him back till I get back the two
that went from me, and if he wants the things you ask for he must send a
token from my own people before I give them."

Balor was neither to hold nor to bind when he got this news. "Man for
man," he said; "she kept one and she'll get back one, but I'll have my
will of the other. The Gobhaun Saor will pay dear for sending my Son on
a fool's errand." He called to his warriors and said:

"Shut the Gobhaun Saor and his Son in my strongest dun and guard it well
through the night. To-morrow I'll send the Son to Ireland and get back
my own Son, and to-morrow I'll have the blood of the Gobhaun Saor."

The Gobhaun Saor and his Son were left in the dun without light, without
food, and without companions. Outside they could hear the heavy-footed
Fomorians, and the night seemed long to them. "My sorrow," said the Son,
"that ever I brought you here to seek a fortune, but put a good thought
on me now, father, for we have come to the end of it all." " I needn't
blame your wit," said the father, "that had as little myself. Why did I
send only two messengers? Why didn't I send a lucky number like three?
Then she could have kept two and send one back. Troth, from this out
every fool will know there's luck in odd numbers!"

"If we had light itself," said the Son, "it wouldn't be so hard, or if I
had a little pipe to play a tune on." He thought of the little reed pipe
he was making the day the three Fomorians came to him, and he began to
search in the folds of his belt for it. His hand came on the lock of
wool he got from Mananaun, arid he drew it out. "O the fool that I was,"
he said, "not to think of this sooner! " "What have you there? "said the
Gobhaun. "I have a lock of wool from the Sea-God, and it will help me
now when I need help." He drew it through his fingers and said: "Give me
light!" and all the dun was full of light. He divided the wool into two
parts and said: "Be cloaks of darkness and invisibility!" and he had two
cloaks in his hand coloured like the sea where the shadow is deepest.
"Put one about you," he said to the Gobhaun, and he drew the other round
himself. They went to the door, it flew open before them, a sleep of
enchantment came on the guards and they went out free. "Now," said the
Son of the Gobhaun Saor, "let a small light go before us; and a small
light went before them on the road, for there were no stars in Balor's
sky. When they came to the Dark Strand the Son struck the waters with
his cloak and a boat came to him. It had neither oars nor sails; it was
pure crystal, and it was shining like the big white star that is in the
sky before sunrise. "It is the Ocean-Sweeper," said the Gobhaun.
"Mananaun has sent us his own boat! " " My thousand welcomes before it,"
said the Son, "and good fortune and honour to Mananaun while there is
one wave to run after another in the sea! "

They stepped into the boat, and no sooner had they stepped into it than
they were at the White Strand, for the Ocean-Sweeper goes as fast as a
thought goes, and takes the people she carries at once to the place they
have their hearts on.

It is a good sight our own land is! " said the Gobhaun when his feet
touched Ireland. "It is," said the Son, "and may we live long to see
it!" There was no stopping after that till they reached the house of the
Gobhaun, and right glad was the Woman of the House to see them. They
told her all their story, and she told them how she had seven locks on
Balor's Son. "Let him out now," said the Gobhaun, "and ask the men of
Ireland to a feast and let the Fomorian take back a good account of the
treatment he got."

Well, there was the feast of the world that night. The biggest pot in
the Gobhaun's house was hung up, and the Gobhaun himself put fire under
it. He took boughs of the oak, boughs of the ash, boughs of the pine
tree, boughs of the quicken, boughs of the blackthorn, boughs of the
hazel, boughs of the yew, boughs of the whitethorn, and a branch of
bog-myrtle. He got a white stone from the door-step of a Brugh-fer, and
a black stone from the door-step of a poet that had nine golden songs.
He struck fire from the stones and the flames leaped up under the pot,
red blue and scarlet and every colour of the rainbow.

It is not dark or silent Gobhaun's house was that night, and if all the
champions on the golden crested ridge of the world had come into it with
the hunger of seven years on them they could have lost it without
trouble at Gobhaun's feast.
