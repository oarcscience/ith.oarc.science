Inisfail

<span id="img_29"></span> ![](img/29.jpg)

  
<span id="img_55"></span> ![](img/55.jpg)\[I\]T was on the First of May
that the Milesians came into Ireland. They came with their wives and
their children and all their treasures. There were many of them. They
came in ships, and it is said by some that they came from a land beyond
the utmost blueness of the sky and that their ships left the track among
the stars that can still be seen on winter nights.

When they were come to Ireland they drew up their ships. They put the
fastening of a year and a day on them and set foot on the Sacred Land.
Amergin was the first to set foot on the Land, and he made this rann in
honour of it. He chanted the rann because he was the chief poet and
druid among the Milesians.

THE RANN.

I am The Wind That Blows Over The Sea,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Wave 0f The Sea,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Sound The Sea Makes,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Ox Of The Seven Combats,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Vulture Upon The Rock,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Ray Of The Sun,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Fairest Of Plants,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Wild Boar,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Salmon in The Water,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Lake In The Plain,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Word 0f Knowledge,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The Spear-Point Of Battle,  
Ah-ro-he!  
I am The God Who Kindles Fire In The Head,  
Ah-ro-he!  
Who makes wise the company on the mountain?  
Who makes known the ages of the moon?  
Who knows the secret resting-place of the sun?  
Ah-ro-he!

The Milesians gave a victory-shout at the end of the rann, and Amergin
said:

"We will go forward now, and when we reach the place where it seems good
to rest we will light a fire and put Three Names of Power on the Land so
that it may belong to us for ever."

They went forward then and they saw no one till Brigit took the shape of
a woman that has known hardship, and came to try them. She wrapped
herself in the cloak of Sorrow and sat by the roadside. She made a great
keening.

"O woman," said Amergin, "why is there such heavy sorrow on you, and why
do you make such a shrill keening?"

"I am keening lost possessions, and lost queen-ship, and a name cried
down the wind of change and forgotten."

"Whose name is cried down the wind?"

"The name of Banba that was queen of this land."

"Her name shall not be whirled into forgetfulness. I will put it on this
land: it shall be called Banba."

"My blessing on you, Stag with Golden Horns, and may the name-giving
bring you luck!"

So Amergin gave away the First Name. They went on from that place, and
Brigit took the shape of a fierce beautiful queen that has lost a
battle, and came again to try them.

"O Queen," said Amergin, "may all the roads of the world be pleasant to
you!"

"O King," said Brigit, "all the roads of the world are hard when those
who were wont to go in chariots walk barefoot on them."

"O Queen," said Amergin, "I would fain better your fortune."

"Grant me then a queen's asking."

"Name your asking."

"I am Eriu, wife of Mac Grian, Son of the Sun, and I would have my name
fastened on this land for ever."

"I will put your name on this land: it shall be called Eriu."

"My blessing on you, Sun-Crested Eagle, and may the name-giving bring
you luck!"

So Amergin gave away the Second Name. They went on from that place, and
Brigit took the form of an old wrinkled crone bent double with age, and
came again to try them. She was gathering sticks, and the bundle was
heavy.

"O woman," said Amergin, "it is hard to see you lifting a bundle when
age has bent you so low already. I would fain better your fortune."

Brigit raised herself, and said:--

"Though I am an old crone now, bent and withered, yet I was once a great
queen, and I will take nothing less than a queen's asking from you."

"What is your asking? "

"Let my name be on this land: I am Fiola."

"I will put your name on this land: it shall be called Fiola."

"My blessing on you, Silver-Spotted Salmon of Knowledge, and may the
name-giving bring you luck!"

So Amergin gave away the Third Name. It was after that they made a fire
for themselves, and when the smoke of it rose against the sky, Ogma,
Nuada, and the Dagda, came to try them.

"What people are you? " asked Nuada, "and from what country have you
come?"

"We are the sons of Milesius," they answered; "he himself is the son of
a god--even of Beltu, the Haughty Father. We are come from Moy More, the
Great Plain that is beyond the horizon of the world."

"How got you knowledge of Ireland?" asked Ogma.

"O Champion," answered Amergin, "from the centre of the Great Plain
there rises a tower of crystal. Its top pierces the heavens, and from
the ramparts of it the wisest one among us got sight of this land. When
he saw it his heart was filled with longing, and when he told us of it
our hearts too were filled with longing. Therefore we set out to seek
that land, and behold we have come to it. We have come to Inisfail, the
Island of Destiny."

"And ye have come to it," said the Dagda, "like thieves in the night;
without proclamation; without weapon-challenge. Ye have lighted a fire
here, as if this were a no-man's land. Judge ye if this be hero
conduct."

"Your words have the bitterness of truth in them," said Amergin. "Say
now what you would have us do."

"You are a druid and a leader among your people," said Nuada. "Give
judgment, therefore, between yourselves and us."

"I will give judgment," said Amergin "I judge it right that we should
return to our ships and go out the distance of nine waves from the land.
Use all your power against us, and we will use all our power against
you. We will take the Island of Destiny by the strength of our hands, or
die fighting for it!"

"It is a good judgment," said Ogma, "Get back to your ships! We will
gather our battle-chiefs for the fight."

Ogma, Nuada, and the Dagda, went away then from the Milesians.

The Milesians began to put out the fire they. had kindled, and as they
were quenching the embers, Brigit threw her mantle of power about her
and came to the Milesians in her own shape. When Amergin saw her he knew
that she was the Mighty Mother, and he cried out:

"O Ashless Flame, put a blessing on us now, that our luck may not be
extinguished with these embers."

"O Druid," said Brigit, "if you had wisdom you would know that before
the First Fire is extinguished the name-blessing should be pronounced
over it."

"O Mother of All Wisdom, I know it, but the name-blessing is gone from
me. I met three queens as I came hither, and each one asked the
name-gift of me. They were queens discrowned: I could not put refusal on
them."

Brigit began to laugh then, and she cried:

"O Amergin, you are not counted a fool, yet it seems to me that if you
had much wit you would know the eyes of Brigit under any cloak in the
world. It was I, myself, who asked the name-gift from you three times,
and got it Do not ask a fourth blessing from me now, for I have blessed
you three times already."

She stooped and lifted a half-quenched ember from the fire. She blew on
it till it became a golden flame--till it became a star. She tossed it
from one hand to the other as a child tosses a ball. She went away
laughing.

The Milesians went back to their ships. They put the distance of nine
waves between themselves and the land. The Tuatha De Danaan loosed the
Fomor on them, and a mighty tempest broke about their ships. Great waves
leaped over them and huge abysses of water engulped them. The utmost
power of the Milesians could not bring the ships a hair's breadth nearer
to the shore. A terrible wind beat on them. Ireland disappeared. Then
Amergin cried out:

"O Land, that has drawn us hither, help us! Show us the noble fellowship
of thy trees: we will be comrades to them. Show us the shining companies
of thy rivers: we will put a blessing on every fish that swims in them.
Show us thy hero-hearted mountains: we will light fires of rejoicing for
them. O Land, help us! help us! help us!"

Ireland heard him, and sent help. The darkness cleared away and the wind
was stilled.

Then Amergin said:

"O Sea, help us! O mighty fruitful Sea! I call on every wave that ever
touched the land. O Sea, help us!"

The sea heard him, and the three waves that go round Ireland--the wave
of Thoth, the wave of Rury and the long slow white foaming wave of
Cleena. The three waves came and lifted the ships to the shore. The
Milesians landed. The Tuatha De Danaan came down to make trial of their
battle-strength. Hard was the contest between them. The Milesians held
their own against the gods. When they saw that the Milesians could hold
their own, the Tuatha De Danaan drew themselves out of the fight. They
laughed and cried to the Milesians:

"Good heroes are ye, and worthy to win the earth: we put our blessing on
you."

Nuada shook the bell-branch, and the glory that the Tuatha De Danaan had
in Tir-na-Moe before they ever set themselves to the shaping of the
earth--that glory--came back to them. They had such splendour that the
Milesians veiled their eyes before them.

"Do not veil your eyes!" said Nuada, "we will draw the Cloak of
invisibility, the Faed Feea, about us. We give you Ireland: but, since
our hands have fashioned it, we will not utterly leave the country. We
will be in the white mist that clings to the mountains; we will be the
quiet that broods on the lakes; we will be the joy-shout of the rivers;
we will be the secret wisdom of the woods. Long after your descendants
have forgotten us, they will hear our music on sunny raths and see our
great white horses lift their heads from the mountain-tarns and shake
the night-dew from their crested manes: in the end they will know that
all the beauty in the world comes back to us, and their battles are only
echoes of ours. Lift up your faces, Children of Milesius, Children of
Beltu the Haughty Father, and greet the land that belongs to you!"

The Milesians lifted up their heads. No glory blinded them, for the
Tuatha De Danaan had drawn the Faed Feea about themselves. They saw the
sunlight on the grass like emerald fire; they saw the blueness of the
sky and the solemn darkness of the pine trees; they heard the myriad
sound of shaken branches and running water, and behind it echoed the
laughter of Brigit.
