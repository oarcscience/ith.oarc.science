PEAT is the fuel of the Highlands and Islands. Where wood is not
obtainable the fire is kept in during the night. The process by which
this is accomplished is called in Gaelic smaladh; in Scottish, smooring;
and in English, smothering, or more correctly, subduing. The ceremony of
smooring the fire is artistic and symbolic, and is performed with loving
care. The embers are evenly spread on the hearth--which is generally in
the middle of the floor--and formed into a circle. This circle is then
divided into three equal sections, a small boss being left in the
middle. A peat is laid between each section, each peat touching the
boss, which forms a common centre. The first peat is laid down in name
of the God of Life, the second in name of the God of Peace, the third in
name of the God of Grace. The circle is then covered over with ashes
sufficient to subdue but not to extinguish <span id="page_235">p.
235</span> the fire, in name of the Three of Light. The heap slightly
raised in the centre is called 'Tula nan Tri,' the Hearth of the Three.
When the smooring operation is complete the woman closes her eyes,
stretches her hand, and softly intones one of the many formulae current
for these occasions.

Another way of keeping embers for morning use is to place them in a pit
at night. The pit consists of a hole in the clay floor, generally under
the dresser. The pit may be from half a foot to a foot in depth and
diameter, with a flag fixed in the floor over the top. In the centre of
this flag there is a hole by which the embers are put in and taken out.
Another flag covers the hole to extinguish the fire at night, and to
guard against accidents during the day. This extinguishing fire-pit is
called 'slochd guail,' coke or coal-pit. This coke or charcoal is
serviceable in kindling the fire.
