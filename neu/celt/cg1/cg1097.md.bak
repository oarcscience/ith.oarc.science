THE day the people began to reap the corn was a day of commotion and
ceremonial in the townland. The whole family repaired to the field
dressed in their best attire to hail the God of the harvest.

Laying his bonnet on the ground, the father of the family took up his
sickle, and facing the sun, he cut a handful of corn. Putting the
handful of corn three times sunwise round his head, the man raised the
'Iolach Buana,' reaping salutation. The whole family took up the strain
and praised the God of the harvest, who gave them <span id="page_247">p.
247</span> corn and bread, food and flocks, wool and clothing, health
and strength, and peace and plenty.

When the reaping was finished the people had a trial called 'cur nan
corran,' casting the sickles, and 'deuchain chorran,' trial of hooks.
This consisted, among other things, of throwing the sickles high up in
the air, and observing how they came down, how each struck the earth,
and how it lay on the ground. From these observations the people augured
who was to remain single and who was to be married, who was to be sick
and who was to die, before the next reaping came round.
