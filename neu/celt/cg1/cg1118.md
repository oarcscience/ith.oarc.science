<span class="small">DURING the winter months the women of Highland
households are up late and early at 'calanas'--this comprehensive term
embracing the whole process of wool-working from the raw material to the
finished cloth. The process is an important factor in the internal
economy of a Highland family. The industry of these women is wonderful,
performed lovingly, uncomplainingly, day after day, year after year,
till the sands of life run down. The life in a Highland home of the
crofter class is well described in the following lines:--</span>

'Calanas' is an interesting process. The wool is carefully sorted and
the coarser parts put aside. It is then washed and laid out to dry, and
again examined and teased, and all lumps and refuse taken out.

If the wool is meant to be made into very fine cloth, it is drawn on
combs of specially long teeth; if into ordinary cloth, it is carded on
the cards without going through the combs. After carding, the wool is
made into 'rolagan,' rowans, and spun into thread, which is arranged
into hanks. At this stage the thread is generally dyed, although
occasionally the wool is dyed after the teasing process and before being
carded. The work of dyeing requires much care and knowledge and
practical skill. It is done with native plants gathered with patient
care from the rocks and hills, moors and fields and lakes, and with
certain earths. When it is considered that a thorough knowledge of <span
id="page_295">p. 295</span> plants is necessary, their locality, their
colouring properties, whether of root, stem, or leaf, and the stage of
growth or decay, it will be understood that those who use them need much
intelligence All Highland women are practical dyers, some more skilful
than others. From infancy they are trained in 'calanas,' and in plants
and dyeing; the whole clothing, including the blankets, of the household
being dependent upon their skill and industry. Are there any other women
in any class who can show such widespread skill and intelligence as
these Highland women show in wool-working and dyeing operations?
Home-made tartans and other fabrics, made many generations, sometimes
centuries, ago, are not only wonderfully fine in texture, but all the
different colours are remarkably bright and beautiful.

The Celts must have had an eye for colour in very early times. The Book
of Kells is said by experts to be the most beautiful illuminated
manuscript in the world. It is believed to have been written in the
Columban monastery of Iona, and to have escaped the Norse destruction of
mss. and been carried to the Columban monastery of Kells. Not only are
the forms of the initial letters in the mss. marvellously intricate and
artistic, but the different pigments used in colouring are still bright
and beautiful and fresh, while the colouring of copies made during this
century is already sickly and faded.

The pattern of the tartan or other cloth to be woven is first designed
on a small piece of wood, the thread being placed on the wood according
to the design proposed. This is called 'suidheachadh,' setting. It is a
work that requires patient care and skill in order to bring out the
pattern correctly. The Chant of the Warping is feelingly intoned by the
women in warping the web. When a word or a phrase has struck their
minds, they stop singing in order to emphasise the sentiment in a word
or a phrase of their own, beseeching Mary's beloved Son to give them
strength to observe His laws. These pious interjections and momentary
stoppages may not add to the beauty of the singing, but they do to the
picturesqueness.
