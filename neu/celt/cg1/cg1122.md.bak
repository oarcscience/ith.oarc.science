### COISRIGEADH AN AODAICH \[113\]

 

FORMERLY throughout the Highlands and Islands the cloth for the family
was made at home. At present home-made clothing is chiefly made in the
Islands, and even there to a lesser extent than formerly.

After the web of cloth is woven it is waulked, to thicken and strengthen
and brighten it. The frame on which the cloth is waulked is a board some
twelve to twenty-four feet long and about two feet broad, grooved
lengthwise along its surface. The frame is called 'cleith,' wattle, and,
'cleith-luaidh,' waulking-wattle, probably from its having been
originally constructed of wattle-work. The waulking-frame is raised upon
trestles, while the waulking-women are ranged on seats on either side,
about two feet of space being allowed to each woman. The web is unrolled
and laid along the board. It is then saturated with ammonia, warm water,
and soap-suds, and the women work it vigorously from side to side across
the grooves of the frame, slowly moving it lengthwise also, that each
part of the cloth may receive due attention. The lateral movement of the
cloth is sunwise. Occasionally the waulking-board is laid on the ground
instead of on trestles, and the women work the cloth with their feet
instead of with their hands.

Generally the waulking-women are young maidens, a few married women of
good voice being distributed among them. They sing as they work, one
singing the song, the others the chorus. Their songs are varied, lively,
and adapted to the class of work. Most of them are love-songs, with an
occasional impromptu song on some passing event--perhaps on the casual
stranger who has looked in, perhaps a wit combat between two of the
girls about the real or supposed merits or demerits of their respective
lovers. These wit combats are much enjoyed, being often clever, caustic,
and apt.

A favourite subject at these waulkings is Prince Charlie, and a
favourite song is 'Morag'--little Marion--the endearing term under which
the Prince is veiled. The words of the song are vigorous and passionate,
and the air stirring, while the subject is one to fire the hearts and
imaginations of the people even at this distance of time, and
notwithstanding the spoliations, oppressions, and butcheries inflicted
on their fathers through their adherence to 'Morag.'

The song begins as follows:--

<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>And ho ro Mòrag,<br />
Ho ro na ho ro darling,<br />
And ho ro Mòrag,</p>
<p>Beauteous Morag of the clustering locks<br />
To sing of thee is my intent.</p></td>

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>Ma dh’ imich thu null thar chuan<br />

<p>Cuimhnich thoir leat bannal ghruagach,<br />

<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>If thou art gone beyond the sea,<br />
Prithee hasten home to me.</p>
<p>Remember, bring a band of maidens,<br />
Who will waulk the red cloth firmly.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

 

When the women have waulked the cloth, they roll up the web and place it
on end in the centre of the frame. They then turn it slowly and
deliberately sunwise along the frame, saying with each turn of the web:

 

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Chan ath-aodach seo.<br />
Chan fhaoigh seo.<br />
Cha chuid cleir no sagairt seo.'</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>This is not second clothing.<br />
This cloth is not thigged.<br />
This is not the property of cleric or priest.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

 

Another form is:--

 

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Roinn a h-aon, roinn a dha, roinn a<br />
tri, roinn a ceithir, roinn a coig, roinn a<br />
sia, roinn a seachd, roinn a seachd.</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>Division one, division two, division<br />
three, division four, division five, division<br />
six, division seven, division seven.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td data-valign="top"><p>'Chan aodach seo do shagairt no chleir,<br />
Ach ’s aodach e do mo Dhomh’lan caomhach fein,<br />
Do m’ chombanach graidh ’s do Iain an aigh,<br />
’S do Mhuiril is aillidh sgeimh.'</p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p> </p></td>
<td data-valign="top"><p>This is not cloth for priest or cleric,<br />
But it is cloth for my own little Donald of love,<br />
For my companion beloved, for John of joy,<br />
And for Muriel of loveliest hue.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

 

Each member of the household for whom the cloth is intended is mentioned
by name in the consecration. The cloth is then spat upon, and slowly
reversed end by end in the name of Father and of Son and of Spirit till
it stands again in the centre of the frame. The ceremony of consecrating
the cloth is usually intoned, the women, hitherto gay and vivacious, now
solemn and subdued, singing in unison. The woman who leads in the
consecration is called 'coisreagan,' consecrator or celebrant. After the
cloth is waulked and washed it is rolled up. This is called
'coilleachadh'--stretching,--'coillcachadh an aodaich'--stretching the
cloth,--a process done with great care in order to secure equal tension
throughout the web.

The operation of waulking is a singularly striking scene, and one which
Highlanders cherish wherever situated.
