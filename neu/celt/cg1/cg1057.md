THIS little prayer is said by old men and women in the islands of Barra.
When they first see the new moon they make their obeisance to it as to a
great chief. The women curtsey gracefully and the men bow low, raising
their bonnets reverently. The bow of the men is peculiar, partaking
somewhat of the curtsey of the women, the left knee being bent and the
right drawn forward towards the middle of the left leg in a curious but
not inelegant manner.

The fragment of moon-worship is now a matter of custom rather than of
belief, although it exists over the whole British Isles. <span

In Cornwall the people nod to the new moon and turn silver in their
pockets. In Edinburgh cultured men and women turn the rings on their
fingers and make their wishes. A young English lady told the writer that
she had always been in the habit of bowing to the new moon, till she had
been bribed out of it by her father, a clergyman, putting money in her
pocket lest her lunar worship should compromise him with his bishop. She
naively confessed, however, that among the free mountains of Loch Etive
she reverted to the good customs of her fathers, from which she derived
great satisfaction!
