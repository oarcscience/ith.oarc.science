THIS poem was taken down in 1866 from Mary Macrae, Harris. She came from
Kintail when young, with Alexander Macrae, whose mother was one of the
celebrated ten daughters of Macleod of Rararsay, mentioned by Johnson
and Boswell. Mary Macrae was rather under than over middle height, but
strongly and symmetrically formed. She often walked with companions,
after the work of the day was done, distances of ten and fifteen miles
to a dance, and after dancing all night walked back again to the work of
the morning fresh and vigorous as if nothing unusual had occurred. She
was a faithful servant and an admirable worker, and danced at her
leisure and carolled at her work like 'Fosgag Moire,' Our Lady's lark,
above her.

The people of Harris had been greatly given to <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> old lore and to the old ways of their fathers, reciting and
singing, dancing and merry-making; but a reaction occurred, and Mary
Macrae's old-world ways were abjured and condemned.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'The bigots of an iron time  
Had called her simple art a crime.'

</div>

But Mary Macrae heeded not, and went on in her own way, singing her
songs and ballads, intoning her hymns and incantations, and chanting her
own 'port-a-bial,' mouth music, and dancing to her own shadow when
nothing better was available.

I love to think of this brave kindly woman, with her strong Highland
characteristics and her proud Highland spirit. She was a true type of a
grand people gone never to return.
