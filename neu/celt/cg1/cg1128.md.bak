### BEANNACHADH CUAIN \[118\]

SEA prayers and sea hymns were common amongst the seafarers of the
Western Islands. Probably these originated with the early Celtic
missionaries, who constantly traversed in their frail skin coracles the
storm-swept, strongly tidal seas of those Hebrid Isles, oft and oft
sealing their devotion with their lives.

Before embarking on a journey the voyagers stood round their boat and
prayed to the God of the elements for a peaceful voyage over the stormy
sea. The steersman led the appeal, while the swish of the waves below,
the sough of the sea beyond, and the sound of the wind around blended
with the voices of the suppliants and lent dignity and solemnity to the
scene.

There are many small oratories round the West Coast where chiefs and
clansmen were wont to pray before and after voyaging. An interesting
example of these is in the island of Grimisey, North Uist. The place is
called Ceallan, cells, from 'ceall,' a cell. There were two oratories
within two hundred yards of one another. One of the two has wholly
disappeared, the other nearly. The ruin stands on a ridge near the end
of the island looking out on the open bay of Ceallan and over the stormy
Minch to the distant mountains of Mull and Morven. The oratory is known
as 'Teampull Mhicheil,' the temple of St Michael. The structure was
simple but beautiful, while the remains are interesting and touching
from their historical associations. Tradition says that the oratory was
built by 'Eibhric'--Euphemia or Amie, sole daughter and heiress of
Ruaraidh, the son of Alan, High Chief of Lorn.

Amie, the daughter of Ruaraidh, married in 1337 John of Islay, Lord of
the Isles. The two being related, they were granted a dispensation by
Pope Benedict XII. The Lady Amie had three sons.

About the year 1358 John of Islay discarded Amie, and married Margaret,
daughter of Robert Steward, and granddaughter of Robert Bruce. When the
Lord of the Isles came south to celebrate his marriage with the Lady
Margaret, one hundred and eight ships full of kinsmen and clansmen,
chiefs and chieftains, came in his train. Such a sight had never been
seen in Scotland before, and people came to the Clyde from long
distances to see this large fleet. The power and influence indicated by
this enormous retinue created much comment and envy among the nobles of
the south and even at the Court.

The Lord of the Isles retained possession of the extensive territories
of the Lady Amie, disposing of them afterwards to his several sons. The
discarded lady took to a religions life, building and restoring
oratories, churches, nunneries, monasteries, and castles throughout her
ancestral lands. Saint Michael's Temple at Ceallan was one of these. In
this little sanctuary built for the purpose the Lady Amie offered
prayers and thanks before and after voyages to her kindred in Lorn.

John, Lord of the Isles, was a man of much munificence, like all those
princely Macdonalds. He gave largely to the Church, earning for himself
from the

priests of the period the name of 'The Good John of Islay.' He was
buried in Iona in the year 1386, in splendour and magnificence never
surpassed, if ever equalled, in the case of the many kings of the five
nationalities buried there.

About two years after his father's death, Ranald, the eldest surviving
son of the Lady Amie, handed over the lordship of the Isles to Donald,
eldest son of the Lady Margaret, who afterwards fought the battle of
Harlaw. The ceremony of installing a Lord of the Isles usually took
place at Loch Finlaggan in Islay, the principal seat of the Macdonalds,
where the ruins of their castle, chapel, and other buildings are still
to be seen, as well as the stone with the footmarks cut in it upon which
the chief stood when, before the 'gentlemen of the Islands' and
Highlands, he was proclaimed 'Macdonald' and 'High-prince of the seed of
Conn.' But it was at Kildonan in the island of Eigg that, Ranald gave
the sceptre into the hand of Donald, who thus became eighth Lord of the
Isles. The account given of the ceremony by Hugh Macdonald, the Seanchie
of Sleat, is interesting as representing the usual manner of installing
a king, chief, or other dignitary among the Celts:--'At this the Bishop
of Argyll, the Bishop of the Isles, and seven priests were sometimes
present, but a Bishop was always present, with the chieftains of all the
principal families and a Ruler of the Isles. There was a square stone
seven or eight feet long, and the tract of a man's foot cut thereon,
upon which he stood, denoting that he should walk in the footsteps and
uprightness of his predecessors, and that he was installed by right in
his possessions. He was clothed in a white habit to show his innocence
and integrity of heart, that he would be a light to his people and
maintain the true religion. The white apparel did afterwards belong to
the poet by right. Then he was to receive a white rod in his hand
intimating that he had power to rule, not with tyranny and partiality,
but with discretion and sincerity. Then he received his forefathers'
sword, or some other sword, signifying that his duty was to protect and
defend them from their enemies in peace or war, as the obligations and
customs of his predecessors were. The ceremony being over, mass was said
after the blessing of the Bishop and seven priests, the people pouring
their prayers for the success and prosperity of their new-created lord.
When they were dismissed, the Lord of the Isles feasted them for a week
thereafter, and gave liberally to the monks, poets, bards, and
musicians. You may judge that they spent liberally without any exception
of persons.' Other accounts differ but slightly from the above, as when
Martin says that the young chief stood upon a cairn of stones, while his
followers stood round him in a circle, his elevation signifying his
authority over them, and their standing below their subjection to hint,
also that immediately after the proclamation the chief druid or bard
performed a rhetorical panegyric setting forth the ancient pedigree,
valour, and liberality of the family as incentives to the young
chieftain and fit for his imitation.' Martin speaks of this ceremony of
installing a chief as prevalent in the eighteenth century.
