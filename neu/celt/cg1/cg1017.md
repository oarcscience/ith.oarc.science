THE reciter said that this poem was composed by a woman in Harris. She
was afflicted with leprosy, and was removed from the community on the
upland to dwell alone on the sea-shore, where she lived on the plants of
the plains and on the shell-fish of the strand. The woman bathed herself
in the liquid in which she had boiled the plants and shell-fish. All her
sores became healed and her flesh became new--probably as the result of
the action of the plants and shell-fish. Leprosy was common everywhere
in mediæval times. In Shetland the disease continued till towards the
end of last century. Communities erected lazar-houses to safeguard
themselves from persons afflicted with leprosy. Liberton, now a suburb
of Edinburgh, derives its name from a lazaretto having been established
there.

The shrine of St James of Compostello in Spain was famous for the cure
of leprosy. Crowds of leper pilgrims from the whole of Christendom
resorted to this shrine, and many of them were healed to the glory of
the Saint and the enrichment of his shrine. In their gratitude, pilgrims
offered costly oblations of silks and satins, of raiments and vestments,
of silver and gold, of pearls and precious stones, till the shrine of St
James of Compostello became famous throughout the world. The bay of
Compostello was famed for fish and shell-fish, and the leper pilgrims
who came to pray at the altar of the Saint and to bestow gifts at his
shrine were fed on those and were healed--according to the belief of the
period, by the miraculous intervention of the Saint. As the palm was the
badge of the pilgrims to Jerusalem, the scallop-shell was the badge of
the pilgrims to Compostello:--

'My sandal shoon and scallop-shell.'
