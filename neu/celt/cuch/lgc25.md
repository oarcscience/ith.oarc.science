# NOTES

THE Irish text, from which the greater number of the stories in this
book have been taken, has been published either in *Irische Texte* or
the *Revue Celtique*, or by O'Curry in *Atlantis* and elsewhere, and I
have worked from this text, comparing it with the translations that have
been already made. In some cases, as in the greater part of "The War for
the Bull of Cuailgne," a very small part of the Irish text has as yet
been printed, and I have had to work by comparing and piecing together
various translations.

I have had to put a connecting sentence of my own here and there, and I
have condensed many passages, and I have sometimes tried to give the
meaning of a formula that has lost its old meaning. Thus I have
exchanged for the grotesque accounts of Cuchulain's distortion--which no
doubt merely meant that in time of great strain or anger he had more
than human strength--the more simple formula that his appearance changed
to the appearance of a god. In the same way, I have left out Levarcham's
distortion, which was the recognised way of saying she was a swift
messenger.

As to the date of the stories, I cannot do better than quote from Mr
Alfred Nutt's "Cuchulain, the Irish Achilles":--

"It suffices to say that we possess a MS. literature of which Cuchulain
and his contemporaries are the subject, the extent of which may be
roughly reckoned at 2000 8vo pages. The great bulk of this is contained
in MSS. which are older than the twelfth century, or which demonstrably
are copied from pre-twelfth century MSS.; where post-twelfth-century
versions alone remain, the story itself is nearly always known from
earlier sources; in fact, there is hardly a single scene or incident in
the whole cycle which has reached us only in MSS. of the thirteenth and
following centuries. At the same time a not inconsiderable portion of
the cycle comes before us altered in language, and to some extent in
content, style of narrative, and characterisation, showing that

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

the saga as a whole remained a living element of Irish culture and
participated in the accidents of its evolution.

"The great bulk of this literature is, as I have said, certainly older
than the twelfth century; but we can carry it back much farther, apart
from any considerations based upon the subject matter. Arguments of a
nature purely philological, based upon the language of the texts, or
critical, based upon the relations of the various MSS. to each other,
not only allow, but compel us to date the *redaction* of the principal
Cuchulain stories, substantially in the form under which they have
survived, back to the seventh to ninth centuries. Whether or no they are
older yet, is a question that cannot be answered without preliminary
examination of the subject-matter. In the meantime it is something to
know that the Cuchulain stories were put into permanent literary form at
about the same date as Beowulf, some 100 to 250 years before the
Scandinavian mythology crystallised into its present form, at least 200
years before the oldest Charlemagne romances, and probably 300 years
before the earliest draft of the Nibelungenlied. Irish is the most
ancient *vernacular* literature of modem Europe, a fact which of itself
commends it to the attention of the student."

A critical account of this and the other Irish cycles is also given in
Dr Douglas Hyde's "Literary History of Ireland."

 

The Tuatha de Danaan, or the Sidhe, so often mentioned, were the divine
race, the people of the Gods of Dana, who conquered the Fomor, the
powers of darkness and their helpers the Firbolgs, in the battle of Magh
Tuireadh, and possessed Ireland until they were in their turn conquered
by the children of the Gael, under the leadership of the Sons of Miled.
Then they became invisible, and made their homes in hills and raths.

The Morrigu was their goddess of battle, and Angus Og, Son of the Dagda,
their god of youth and love, and Lugh, the Master of many Arts, their
Hermes, their Apollo, and Manannan, Son of Lir, their Sea-God, or, as
some say, the sea itself.

 

The spelling of Irish names for English readers is always a difficulty.
I have not gone by any fixed rule but have taken the spelling of names
from various good authorities. As to pronunciation, the modem is
generally used, but we know so little what the ancient pronunciation
was, that we are left some freedom, and some words have taken a shape
from English-speaking generations, that it is hard to change. Teamhair,
for instance, has become Tara through a mistaken use of the genitive;
Muirthemne is called by

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Irish speakers
"Mur-hev-na," but others call it Muir’them-mé and I am inclined to
prefer this for the charm of its sound, and I do not see any stronger
reason against using it than against sounding as we do the "s" in Paris.
After all, it has not been definitely settled whether Trafalgar is to be
spoken in the Spanish or the English way; English poets have given it
one or the other emphasis.

This is the approximate pronunciation of some of the more difficult
names:--

The following is a list of the authorities I have been chiefly helped by
in putting these stories together. But I cannot make it quite accurate,
for I have sometimes transferred a mere phrase, sometimes a whole
passage from one story to another, where it seemed to fit better. I have
occasionally used Scottish Gaelic versions, as in the account of
Deirdre's birth, and the manner of her death, and in a part of "The Only
Son of Aoife." "O'Curry" stands for his two books, "The Manners and
Customs of Ancient Ireland," and "MS. Materials for Ancient Irish
History," and his contributions to *Atlantis*.

We must be grateful to all these scholars, workers, or compilers, those
who have passed away, and those who are living. And I am personally
grateful to my friend Douglas Hyde for patient answering of many
questions; and to my friend and critic, W. B. Yeats, for his kindness
and for his severity.

A. G.
