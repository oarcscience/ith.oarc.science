### THE DISCIPLINE OF BARDISM.

THE CREATION.

Disciple. With what material did God make all corporal things, endued
with life?

Master. With the particles of light, which are the smallest of all small
things; and yet one particle of light is the greatest of all great
things, being no less than material for all materiality that can be
understood and perceived as within the grasp of the power of God. And in
every particle there is a place wholly commensurate with God, for there
is not, and cannot be less than God in every particle of light, and God
in every particle; nevertheless, God is only one in number. On that
account, every light is one, and nothing is one in perfect co-existence
but what cannot be two, either in or out of itself.

D. How long was God in making all corporal things?

M. The twinkling of an eye; when existence and life, light and vision
occurred, that is to say, God and all goodness in the act of contemning
evil. <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_261.md)

THE CREATION.

Question. Of what materials did God make the worlds?

Answer. Of Himself, for existence having a beginning does not otherwise
take place.

THE CREATION.

Question. How were animation and life obtained?

Answer. From God, and in God were they found, that is, from the
fundamental and absolute life, that is, from God uniting Himself to the
dead, or earthliness--hence motion and mind, that is, soul. And every
animation and soul are from God, and their existence is in God, both
their pre-existence, and derived existence; for there is no
pre-existence except in God, no co-existence except in God, and no
derived existence except in God, and from God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_261"></span>[257:1](bim1105.htm#fr_263.md) <span
id="page_256">p. 256</span> This fragment, in connection with the fact
that His is one of the Names of God, throws wonderful light upon the
language of Rhys Brydydd, whilst that also bears testimony to the
existence in his days, namely, between 1450 and 1490, of the curious
doctrine of the text:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Bychanaf or bychenyd*,  
Yw Hu Gadarn, fe’i barn byd;  
A *mwyaf*, a Naf i ni,  
Da coeliwn, a’n Duw Celi,  
Ysgafn ei daith, ac esgud,  
*Mymryn tes*, gloewyn ei glud,  
A *mawr* ar dir a moroedd,  
A *mwyaf* a gaf ar goedd;  
*Mwy no’r bydoedd*, ’marbedwn  
Amarch gwael i’r mawr hael hwn.

The smallest of the small  
Is Hu the Mighty, as the world judges;  
And the greatest, and a Lord to us,  
Let us well believe, and our mysterious God;  
Light His course and active,  
An atom of glowing heat is His car;  
Great on land and on the seas,  
The greatest that I manifestly can have,  
Greater than the worlds--Let us beware  
Of mean indignity to him who deals in bounty.  
               See Dr. Pughe's Diet. v. *mymryn*.

</div>

It would have been utterly impossible to explain the allusions,
contained in this poetical passage, without the key which the Bardic
Catechism offers to us.
