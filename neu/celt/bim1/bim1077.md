### THE HERALD-BARD.

The sciences of a Herald-bard have been lost, except what is preserved
in the art of armory. In primitive times the sciences of heraldry were
honourable, and every innate Cymro bore the signs of his lineage, his
privileges, and his praiseworthy deeds, and of the praiseworthy deeds of
his ancestors; and on that account the bearing of lineage and gentility
was called a coat of arms. And when Ovatism was appointed, the sciences
of Letter, and the memorial of Coelbren, were improved, and the sciences
of heraldry wore abolished, being sufficiently included in the art of a
Primitive Bard, namely, Vocal Song, the voice of Gorsedd, and the

sciences of Letter, Coelbren, and Coelvaen, and after that, the Roll of
writing. That, namely, the Roll of writing, <span

introduced the faith in Christ into this island; that is, it was at that
time that the art of elucidating sciences on plagawd skins, in preserved
Rolls, became general in the country and among the nation of the Cymry.
