### THE STANZA OF THE GORSEDD CHAIR OF THE WINTER SOLSTICE.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the country of Gwrthenin, <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_333.md)
shall bewail a stratagem,  
To the notches <span id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_334.md) of rods shall the
secluded populace repair;  
Blessed the lips that shall easily, and in confidential secrecy,  
Pronounce three words of the ancient and primitive language.  
                        Composed by Merddin Emrys. <span
id="fr_337"></span>[4](#fn_335.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_333"></span>[367:2](bim1125.htm#fr_335.md) <span
id="page_366">p. 366</span> This is probably a corrupt reading of
"Gwarthefin;" unless we take it as meaning "Gwrthenau," the cognomen of
Gwrtheyrn, one of "the three arrant traitors of the Isle of Britain." In
that case, the "stratagem" referred to would undoubtedly be the
treacherous plot of the long knives on Caer Caradog, of which he was the
promoter.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[367:3](bim1125.htm#fr_336.md) "Ysgyr," the plural
of *ysgor*, which, according to Llywelyn Sion, is used for a letter,
i.e. a notch, or opening, from *ys*, and *gor*, an opening, or aperture.
There is here clearly a reference to the Coelbren or Peithynen of the
Bards, to <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> the use of which, under
certain national troubles, the people would have to recur, as was the
case in the time of Dwain Glyndwr.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[367:4](bim1125.htm#fr_337.md) Merddin Emrys was
the Bard of Emrys Wledig, or Ambrosius, in the 5th century.
