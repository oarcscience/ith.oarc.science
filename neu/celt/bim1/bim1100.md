### THE THREE STATES.

1\. According to the three principal qualities of man shall be his
migration in Abred: from indolence and mental blindness he shall fall to
Annwn; from dissolute wantonness he shall traverse the circle of Abred,
according to his necessity; and from his love for goodness he shall
ascend to the circle of Gwynvyd. As one or the other of the principal
qualities of man predominates, shall the state

of the man be; hence his three states, Annwn, Abred, <span

2\. The three states of living beings: Annwn, whence the beginning;
Abred, in which is the increase of knowledge, and hence goodness; and
Gwynvyd, in which is the plenitude of all goodness, knowledge, truth,
love, and endless life.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_252"></span>[243:1](bim1100.htm#fr_254) <span
id="page_242">p. 242</span> As it is now generally admitted that the
Hyperboreans, spoken of by ancient authors, were the same as the
primitive inhabitants of Britain, or the Cymry, it is very probable that
their priest *Abaris*, who, according to Herodotus, (I. iv. 36.) carried
an arrow *round the whole earth* fasting, referred mystically to the
circle of Abred. He is said to have presented his arrow to Pythagoras,
by which we are probably to understand that the philosopher received the
doctrine of the metempsychosis from the Druids.

According to Stephanus of Bysantium, (*De Urb*.,) the Cimbri or Cimmerii
were called also *Abroi*, perhaps *Abredolion*.
