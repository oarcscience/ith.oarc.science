### THE TRIADS OF BARDISM, CALLED THE TRIADS OF IONABWY.

THE ELEMENTS.

1\. There are three original principles, which are the three primary
elements: the first, calas, hence all hardness, and it hardens every
other thing, that comes in conjunction with it, and from this comes all
corporeity; the second, fluidity, <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_343.md)
and hence all freshness and softness, and it freshens and softens every
thing that is commingled with it, and all moisture and all corporal
change; the third, nwyvre, and hence all life, for whatever it mixes
with becomes alive, as far as its species and capability permit.

Other teachers and wise men say thus:

2\. There are five elements: calas; water; air; fire; and nev. <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_344.md)

And others say thus:

3\. There are five elements: earth, which is calas; fluidity, which is
water and freshness; air, and hence all breathing, every voice and
speech; fire, and hence all heat and light; and nwyvre, whence proceed
all life, intelligence, knowledge, and power from will and desire.

Another of a similar kind:--

4\. The three materials of every thing: earth; water; and nwyvre. Others
say: earth; water; and nev. Others say: calas; fluidity; and nwyvre.

Another of the same kind:

5\. There are five particular elements: calas; fluidity; firmament;
uvel; and nwyvre.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span> <span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

Another:--

6\. There are three elements of matter, of original kind and condition:
calas, from which comes all corporeity that has form and measure;
fluidity, from which comes all progress capable of rest and motion; and
nwyvre, whence all life and understanding.

It is as follows in another Book, according to other teachers:--

7\. There are five elements, namely:, earth; water; air; fire; and nev;
and it is in nev that God exists, as well as every soul, which is also
from Him.

Others say thus:--

8\. The five concurrences of every thing: earth; water; air; fire; and
soul, the soul being God, from Whom proceeds all life; in the earth are
the body and form; in the water is the conjunction; in the air are the
breath and motion; in the fire is the feeling, that is, the corporal
senses; in the soul are the life, and the senses of perception, namely,
understanding, sciences, awen, reason, and affection. And in these five
all things concur and have their origin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_343"></span>[377:2](bim1129.htm#fr_345.md) <span
id="page_376">p. 376</span> Al. "water."

<span id="fn_344"></span>[377:3](bim1129.htm#fr_346.md) This word is used
now simply to denote *heaven*. It seems to be the same as <span

ψυκη κοσμου, that pervaded and animated the whole world.
