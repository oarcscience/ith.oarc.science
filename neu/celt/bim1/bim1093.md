### BARDIC APHORISMS.

Thus says the Bard:--

There is no advantage but what can in no ways be dispensed with, that
is, God;  
There is no want but the want of God;  
There is no enjoyment but the enjoyment of God;  
There is no loss but the loss of God;  
There is no sufficiency but God;  
There is nothing immeasurable but God;  
There is nothing knowing but God;  
There is nothing in every place but God;  
There is nothing powerful but God;  
There is nothing in every thing but God;  
There is no whole but God;  
There is no God but what is whole.
