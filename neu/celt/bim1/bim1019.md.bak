### THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF LETTERS.--THE NAME OF GOD.--THE BARDIC SECRET.

Pray, my skilful and discreet teacher, if it be fair to ask, how was the
knowledge of letters first obtained?

I will exhibit the information of men of wisdom and pro-found knowledge,
thus;--When God pronounced His name, with the word sprang the light and
the life; for previously there was no life except God Himself. And the
mode in which it was spoken was of God's direction. His name was
pronounced, and with the utterance was the springing of light and
vitality, and man, and every other living thing; that is to say, each
and all sprang together. And Menw <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md)
the Aged, son of Menwyd, <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) beheld the
springing of the light, and its form and appearance, not otherwise than
thus, <span id="img_01700"></span> ![](img/01700.jpg), in three columns;
and in the rays of light the vocalization--for one were the hearing and
seeing, one unitedly the form and sound; and one unitedly with the form
and sound was life, and one unitedly with these three was power, which
power was God the Father. And since each of these was one unitedly, he
understood that every voice, and hearing, and living, and being, and
sight, and seeing, were one unitedly with God; nor is the least thing
other than God. And by seeing the form, and in it hearing the voice--not
otherwise--he knew what form and appearance voice should have. And
having obtained earth under him coinstantaneously with the light, he
drew the form of the voice and light

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span> <span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

on the earth. And it was on hearing the sound of the voice, which had in
it the kind and utterance of three notes, that he obtained the three
letters, and knew the sign that was suitable to one and other of them.
Thus he made in form and sign the Name of God, after the semblance of
rays of light, and perceived that they were the figure and form and sign
of life; one also with them was life, and in life was God, that is to
say, God is one with life, and there is no life but God, and there is no
God but life.

It was from the understanding thus obtained in respect of this voice,
that he was able to assimilate mutually every other voice as to kind,
quality, and reason, and could make a letter suitable to the utterance
of every sound and voice. Thus were obtained the Cymraeg, and every
other language. And it was from the three primary letters that were
constructed every other letter,--which is the principal secret of the
Bards of the Isle of Britain; and from this secret comes every knowledge
of letters that is possible.

Thus was the voice, that was heard, placed on record in the symbol, and
meaning attached to each of the three notes:--the sense of O was given
to the first column, the sense of I to the second or middle column, and
the sense of V to the third; whence the word OIV. That is to say, it was
by means of this word that God declared His existence, life, knowledge,
power, eternity, and universality. And in the declaration was His love,
that is, coinstantaneously with it sprang like lightening all the
universe into life and existence, co-vocally and co jubilantly with the
uttered Name of God, in one united song of exultation and joy--then all
the worlds to the extremities of Annwn. It was thus, then, that God made
the worlds, namely, He declared His Name and existence <span
id="img_01900"></span> ![](img/01900.jpg).

Why is it not right that a man should commit the Name of God to
vocalization, and the sound of language and tongue

Because it cannot be done without misnaming God, for

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

no man ever heard the vocalization of His Name, and no one knows how to
pronounce it; but it is represented by letters, that it may be known
what is meant, and for Whom it stands. Formerly signs were employed,
namely, the three elements of vocal letters. However, to prevent
disrespect and dishonour to God, a Bard is forbidden to name Him, except
inwardly and in thought.

Pray, my beloved and discreet teacher, show me the signs that stand for
the Name of God, and the manner in which they are made.

Thus are they made;--the first of the signs is a small cutting or line
inclining with the sun at eventide, thus, <span id="img_02100"></span>
![](img/02100.jpg); the second is another cutting, in the form of a
perpendicular, upright post, thus, <span id="img_02101"></span>
![](img/02101.jpg); and the third is a cutting of the same amount of
inclination as the first, but in an opposite direction, that is, against
the sun, thus <span id="img_02102"></span> ![](img/02102.jpg); and the
three placed together, thus, <span id="img_02103"></span>
![](img/02103.jpg). But instead of, and as substitutes for these, are
placed the three letters O I W. And it was in this manner that the Bard
inserted this name in his stanza, thus,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Eternal, Origin, Self-existent, Distributor,--holy be the lips  
That canonically pronounce them;  
Another name, in full word,  
Is O. I. and W--OIW <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) the word.--Ieuan
Rudd sang it. <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_48.md)

</div>

This name God gave to Himself, to show that He is in existence, and that
there is no one but Himself, except by gift and permission; for truly
all of us men, and other living beings, are and exist only by the gift
and permission

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

of God. It is considered presumptuous to utter this name in the hearing
of any man in the world. Nevertheless, every thing calls Him inwardly by
this name--the sea and land, earth and air, and all the visibles and
invisibles of the world, whether on the earth or in the sky--all the
worlds of all the celestials and terrestrials--every intellectual being
and existence--every thing animate and inanimate; wherefore none that
honours God, will call Him by this name, except inwardly.

The three mystic letters signify the three attributes of God, namely,
love, knowledge, and truth; and it is out of these three that justice
springs, and without one of the three there can be no justice. Which one
so ever of the three stands up, the other two will incline towards it;
and every two of them whatsoever will yield precedency and pre-eminence
to the third, whichever of the three it may be. It was according to this
order and principle that three degrees were conferred upon the Bards of
the Isle of Britain, and each of the three was invested with privilege,
precedency, and pre-eminence, in respect of the particularity of
necessity, over the other two, whichsoever they might be. Out of the
three attributes of God spring every power and will and law.

It was out of the knowledge and understanding of the vocalization of
language and speech, by reason of the three principal letters, that
sixteen letters were formed, constructed from the primary columns,
namely, the three principal letters in the form of rays of light. And it
was thus that form and appearance could be imparted to every
vocalization of language and speech, and to every primary sound, and
symbolic forms of memory be made visible on wood and stone. Accordingly
the memory of seeing could thus take place simultaneously with the
memory of hearing; and, by means of signs, every sound of voice could be
rendered visible to the eye, as far as the ear could hear what the
tongue spoke, and what awen from God was capable of. Then when sixteen
letters were constructed out of the principal

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

columns, namely these <span id="img_02500"></span>
![](img/02500.jpg)--since no letter can be found on the Coelbren, or in
the Secret of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, that has not its
elements and modifications derived from one or other of the three
principal columns--and because these signs were cut on wood, they were
called *llythyrau*. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) And when every
one of the letters was cut on wood, each of them received a name and
meaning in respect of sound and voice, warranted and systematized; that
is to say, each had its own peculiar vocalization, confirmed by art.
Thus were obtained the signs and rudiments of war-ranted speech, which
is called Abic, <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) but others call it
Abcedilros. <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_51.md) Thus was ocular and
manual art applied to speech and thought, whence arose ocular memorials
and the materials of knowledge. Then wise men and aspirants engaged
themselves in improving sciences and language and speech, and in
discriminating vocalization and the variety of sound with greater skill
and minuteness; and they elaborated them, until they were able to make
two more letters, so that the Alphabet consisted of eighteen letters.
After that the need of two more was observed, until they became
twenty; <span id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_52.md) then twenty-two; and to
complete the work, twenty-four principal letters; nor are there more in
the Alphabet of the Coelbren that are simple, that is to say, of primary
sound. Nevertheless, there are others that are compound letters,
significative of the mutation of voice, and of the accentuation of
letters, of which, according to highly skilful teachers, there are
sixteen in number, whilst others will have them to be eighteen. Some of
them cannot have authority or warrant, at least they cannot have
necessity, in virtue of indispensable reason; nevertheless it is not
allowable to forbid the improvement of sciences, whilst every awen and
art are free, provided they do not injure, obscure, or confound laudable
sciences.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> <span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

It is by means of letters that sciences and history are committed to
rational memory. The three foundations of sciences are memory,
understanding, and reason, and without the memory little is the utility
of memory, understanding, and reason. After the discovery of the
knowledge of letters it was that every understanding, and consideration,
and every meditation of awen were committed to the memorial of letters;
and from long acquaintance therewith room was seen for improving,
amplifying, and varying the order and system of language and speech, and
the art of letters, that letters might be warranted, which should be
suitable to every circumstance of language and speech, and for the
purpose of showing visibly every sound and utterance of word, voice, and
speech, that they might harmonize with the ratiocination of the art of
language and letters, and that speech might agree with speech between
man and man, in respect of the sound and meaning of a sentence, the
effort of language, and the encounter of the art and sciences of
language and letters. Hence easy and warranted became the understanding,
and understanding arose from understanding, and all men became of one
judgment in respect of the meaning of word and sentence, and in respect
of the sense, accent, and signification of letters. And hence fixed
confirmation was bestowed upon the sciences of letters, and upon all
sciences that were committed to the memory and under the auspices of
letters; and it became easy, also, to learn and understand what was thus
arranged systematically and with a fixed meaning; and it was easy for
all men to be of one judgment, and of one sense in respect of such. That
is to say, from the long co-reasoning of wise men and aspirants, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) and men of art, improvement and fixedness
of meaning and system, are obtained, in respect of all sciences, and in
respect of every one of them. After letters had been improved and
amplified, as occasion required, in respect of meaning and number, there
were exhibited twenty-four primaries--in the opinion of others, the
three nines, that is to say, twenty-seven; nor is there any need or
occasion

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span> <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

for more primaries, for, say they, there cannot be symbols of every
sound of word and speech in the Cymraeg under twenty-seven letters--but
they formed secondaries and two primary letters.

Pray, my far knowing teacher, why is it said that only a Bard of
thorough secrecy knows how the Name of God is to be spoken audibly, that
is to say, by means of the three principal columns of letters?

Because only a Bard of secrecy knows properly the old system of letters,
and their meaning, accent, and powers, in respect of their stability in
the system of the eighteen letters; for when the system of the eighteen
was established, new letters were employed for the Name of God, namely O
I U, but previously, during the era of the sixteen, no letters stood for
the Name of God, other than the three columns of primary letters, that
is <span id="img_02900"></span> ![](img/02900.jpg), which was called the
system of God and light, and only a Bard of thorough secrecy now knows
properly either the one or the other of the two old systems, which I
have mentioned.

Why is not that secret <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) committed to
letter and audible speech, that it may be known of all?

Because it is misjudged by him who would have credence from another for
more than he knows, and it is the wicked man, with the view of pillaging
belief from the ignorant, that does so, and that bestows unjust
imaginations upon a letter, and its meaning, accent, pronunciation, and
sound, rather than the true and just. It is by such men that divine
sciences are and have been corrupted, therefore the secret ought not to
be divulged to other than to him who, in the judgment and sight of man,
is warranted as having awen from God. Nor is there any other who knows
the vocalization of the Name of God, without telling a falsehood, and
the greatest falsehood is to falsify God and His Name.

Why is it not free from falsehood to commit the Name of God to speech
and the hearing of the ear?

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span> <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Because that cannot be done without its being falsely spoken, by any man
or living being and existence possessed of soul and intellect, but by
God Himself;--to exhibit and pronounce it in speech otherwise is
falsehood, and the devastation and spoliation of God, for there is no
being but God and in God, and whoso says otherwise speaks falsehood,
which is falsehood against God, and depredatory usurpation over Him. But
he who possesses awen from God will perceive the secret, and will know
it, and wherever a man may have awen from God, warranted in respect of
reason and conduct, it is not unjust to divulge to him the secret, but
it is not just to do so to any other, lest the Name of God be spoken
erroneously, falsely, and through unjust and vain imagination, and
thereby be mocked, disparaged, and dishonoured. There is also another
cause, namely, to induce a man to excercise his understanding and reason
upon just and firm meditation; for he who does so, will understand the
character and meaning of the primitive system of sixteen letters, and
the subsequent system of eighteen, and hence will perceive and
understand the Name of God, and the just reverence due to Him; for he
who does truth will do justice.

When the system of letters was improved in respect of number and
pronunciation, <span id="img_03100"></span> ![](img/03100.jpg) was
employed where there could be no proper vocalization of <span
id="img_03101"></span> ![](img/03101.jpg), and Ll as producing L, or
<span id="img_03102"></span> ![](img/03102.jpg) as producing <span
id="img_03103"></span> ![](img/03103.jpg); and by observing kind and
quality, one could well perceive the priority of Ll, that is, <span
id="img_03104"></span> ![](img/03104.jpg), inasmuch as that letter is
the root, and a primary word, which cannot be the case with <span
id="img_03105"></span> ![](img/03105.jpg), according to the fixedness
given to the Cymraeg by wise and clear sighted teachers. And where the
Cymraeg stands on the eighteen, the three vocal letters OIV, written
variously by some thus <span id="img_03106"></span> ![](img/03106.jpg),
were fixedly and authoritatively arranged; and, without the violation of
secrecy, there cannot be another system arising from the improvement of
the three letters, and their accent and meaning.

It was from these three things that they began to exhibit sciences in
Triads, that is to say;--

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span> <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

The three principal signs of sciences, namely,--the three rays of light,
for from them were obtained appearance and colour and form--the three
voices of light, and from them were obtained hearing and speech and
vocal song--and the three symbolic letters, and from them were obtained
the memory of sight, and the form of voice, visibly, and.. mental
understanding in regard to what can have no colour, or form, or voice.
And it was from these three that fixedness and authority were obtained
for sciences and art.
