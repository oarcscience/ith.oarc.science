*The Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol. I.*, ed. by J. Williams Ab Ithel,
\[1862\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### IAU. <span id="fr_231"></span>[5](#fn_230)

Disciple and his Master.

Disciple. Why is Iau (yoke) given as a name for God?

Master. Because the yoke is the measuring rod <span
id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_231) of country and nation in virtue of the
authority of law, and is in the possession of every head of family under
the mark of the lord of the territory, and whoever violates it is liable
to a penalty. Now, God is the measuring rod of all truth, all justice,
and all goodness, therefore He is a yoke on all, and all are under it,
and woe to him who shall violate it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[221:5](bim1095.htm#fr_231) <span
id="page_220">p. 220</span> "A yoke." It would appear, rather, that the
*iau*, or yoke, being the badge of power on the part of him who imposed
it, was so designated from <span id="img_22000"></span>
![](img/22000.jpg), <span id="page_221">p. 221</span> a combination of
Bardic symbols, which indicates preservation, creation, and destruction,
and which was one of the earliest forms of the Divine Name. Iolo
Morganwg interprets "Iau" as meaning "the recent, or last manifestation
of the Deity--Mithras, Mithra;" from the adjective, which literally
signifies *younger*.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[221:6](bim1095.htm#fr_232) The yoke, as a
measuring rod, is mentioned in the Welsh Laws; it follows, therefore,
that this catechetical fragment must have been composed when those laws
were in force.
