39\. The three privileges of Gwynvyd: the complete predominance of love
over hatred; complete power, under

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span> <span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

the privilege of right and bliss, derived from universal knowledge; and
complete satisfaction with every thing, since every opposition and
Cythraul have ceased.

40\. Three things that are endless: fire, that is, light; life, that is,
God; and understanding, that is, truth.

41\. The three necessities of all animations: vocation; awen; and
privilege; and there is nothing else in the primary nature of these that
is thoroughly one with it.

42\. The three necessities prior to perfect knowledge: to see; to
suffer; and to remember every thing, in every state of life.

43\. Three things which man knows not what they are: God; nonentity; and
infinitude.

44\. The three sources of knowledge: reason; nature; and impulse.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_325"></span>[357:2](bim1121.htm#fr_327) <span
id="page_356">p. 356</span> These follow the preceding, in Iolo's
manuscript, without any heading, except, "\*These marks refer to the
printed copy. After 38," which seems to indicate that they belong to the
"Triads of Bardism," which are published in the "Lyric Poems."
