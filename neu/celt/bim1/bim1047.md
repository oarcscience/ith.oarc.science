### THE PILLARS OF MEMORY.--THE SYMBOLS.

The three pillars of memory and history: vocal song; letter; and symbol.
A symbol is a form that is understood, and, being understood, shews at
sight that that really exists which would require many letters, or much
of vocal song, or speech and oration, before it could be properly
understood.

There are three symbols: the symbol of number; the symbol of sound or
tone, from which is justly shown the voice and tone of harmony; and the
symbol of hieroglyphics, which is the form and sign that is understood
by its formation; and the blazonry of the arms of nobility, and the arms
of nation. The man who knows this art, and will show it authoritatively,
is called a herald-bard, and his office and art is to represent history
in hieroglyphics, even as the times of the moon are shewn by its visible
delineations, and the number of year, month, and day.
