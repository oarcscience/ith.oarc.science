### THE INVENTION OF LETTERS BY EINIGAN AND MENW.--THE SECRET OF BARDISM.

Einigan the Giant beheld three pillars of light, having in them all
demonstrable sciences that ever were, or ever will be. And he took three
rods of the quicken tree, and placed on them the forms and signs of all
sciences, so as to be remembered; and exhibited them. But those who saw
them misunderstood, and falsely apprehended them, and taught illusive
sciences, regarding the rods as a God, whereas they only bore His Name.
When Einigan saw this, he was greatly annoyed, and in the intensity of
his grief he broke the three rods, nor were others found that contained
accurate sciences. He was so distressed on that account that from the
intensity he burst asunder, and with his \[parting\] breath he prayed
God that there should be accurate sciences among men in the flesh, and
there should be a correct understanding for the proper discernment
thereof. And at the end of a year and a day, after the decease of
Einigan, Menw, son

of the Three Shouts, beheld three rods growing out of the mouth of
Einigan, which exhibited the sciences of the Ten Letters, and the mode
in which all the sciences of language and speech were arranged by them,
and in language and speech all distinguishable sciences. He then took
the rods, and taught from them the sciences--all, except the Name of
God, which he made a secret, lest the Name should be falsely discerned;
and hence arose the Secret of the Bardism of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain. And God imparted His protection to this secret, and gave Menw a
very discreet understanding of sciences under this His protection, which
understanding is called Awen from God; and blessed for ever is he who
shall obtain it. Amen, so be it.

From the mouth of Adam, like blessed trees, three crosses, &c.  
Rods of fine growth were obtained, being trees from the mouth of
Adam. <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](bim1025.htm#fn_75.md)
