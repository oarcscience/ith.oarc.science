### DRUIDISM.

Disciple and Teacher.

This is the Druidism of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, with their
opinion respecting God and all living beings, of whatsoever grade or
kind they may be. It is rudimentally taught as follows:--

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span> <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

1\. Question. What is God?

Answer. What cannot be otherwise.

Q. Why cannot it be otherwise?

A. Could it be otherwise, we should have no knowledge of any animation,
being, existence, or futurity, in respect of any thing now known to us.

Q. What is God?

A. Complete and perfect life, and the total annihilation of every thing
inanimate and death, nor can any species of mortality concur with Him.
And God is life, full, entire, imperishable, and without end.

2\. God is perfect life, which cannot be limited <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_214.md) or confined, and, in virtue of His
proper essence, is possessed of perfect knowledge, in respect of sight,
sufferance, and intention, having His origin in Himself, without
communion with any thing else whatsoever, and wholly free from all
participation in evil.

3\. God is absolute good, in that He totally annihilates all evil, and
there cannot be in Him the least particle of the nature of evil.

4\. God is absolute power, in that He totally annihilates inability, nor
can power and will in Him be restrained, since He is almighty, and
allgood.

5\. God is absolute wisdom and knowledge, in that He totally annihilates
ignorance, and folly; and therefore no event can by any chance happen,
which He knows not of. And in view of these qualities and
properties <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_215.md) no being or animation
can be conceived or contemplated other than coming from God, except
natural evil, which annihilates all life and goodness.

6\. What would utterly annihilate and reject God and life, and therein
all goodness, is absolute and natural evil; which is thus in complete
opposition, and of a contrary nature, and essence, to God, life, and
goodness.

7\. And by means of this direction, may be seen two things existing of
necessity, namely: the living and dead;

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span> <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

good and evil; God and Cythraul, and darkness in darkness, and powerless
inability.

8\. Cythraul is destitute of life and intention--a thing of necessity,
not of will, without being or life, in respect of existence and
personality; but vacant in reference to what is vacant, dead in
reference to what is dead, and nothing in reference to what is nothing.
Whereas God is good with reference to what is good, is fulness in
reference to fulness, life in life, all in all, and light in light.

9\. And from what has been said, it may be seen that there can be no
existence of original nature but God and Cythraul, the dead and living,
nothing and occurrence, issue from what is issueless, and existence from
mutual union.

10\. God mercifully, out of love and pity, uniting Himself with the
lifeless, that is, the evil, with the intention of subduing it unto
life, imparted the existence of vitality to animated and living beings,
and thus did life lay hold of the dead, whence intellectual animations
and vitality first sprang. And intellectual existences and animations
began in the depth of Annwn, for there is the lowest and least grade,
and it cannot but be that there and in that state intellectual life
first began, for it cannot be otherwise than that the least and lowest
grade of every thing should be the original and primordial one. The
greatest cannot exist in an intellectual existence before the least;
there can be no intellectual existence without gradation, and in respect
of gradation there cannot but be a beginning, a middle, and an end or
extremity,--first, augmentation, and ultimate or conclusion. Thus may be
seen that there is to every intellectual existence a necessary
gradation, which necessarily begins at the lowest grade, progressing
from thence incessantly along every addition, intervention, increase,
growth in age, and completion, unto conclusion and extremity, where it
rests for ever from pure necessity, for there can not be any thing
further or higher or better in respect of gradation and Abred.

11\. All intellectual existences partake of good and

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span> <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

evil, and that, more or less, according to their degree in Abred, from
the dead in the depth of Annwn, to the living in the extremity of
goodness and power, even so far as would not be at all possible for God
to conduct them further.

12\. Animations in Annwn are partakers of life and goodness in the
lowest possible degree, and of death and evil in the highest degree that
is possibly compatible with life and personal identity. Therefore, they
are necessarily evil, because of the preponderance of evil over the
good; and scarcely do they live and exist; and their duration and life
are necessarily short, whilst by means of dissolution and death they are
removed gradually to a higher degree, where they receive an accumulation
of life and goodness, and thus they progress from grade to grade, nearer
and nearer to the extremity of life and goodness, God, of His merciful
affection for animated beings, preparing the ways along Abred, out of
pure love to them, until they arrive at the state and point of human
existence, where goodness and evil equiponderate, neither weighing down
the other. From this spring liberty and choice and elective power in
man, so that he can perform which ever he likes of any two things, as of
good and evil; and thus is it seen that the state of humanity is a state
of probation and instruction, where the good and evil equiponderate, and
animated beings are left to their own will and pleasure.

13\. In every state and point of Abred that is below humanity, all
living beings are necessarily evil, and necessarily bound to evil, from
utter want of will and power, notwithstanding all the exertion and power
put forth, which vary according as they are situate in Abred, whether
the point be high or low. On this account God does not hate or punish
them, but loves and cherishes them, because they cannot be otherwise,
and because they are under obligation, and have no will and choice, and
whatever the amount of evil may be, they cannot help it, because it is
from obligation, and not willingly, that they are in this condition.

14\. After having arrived at the point of humanity in

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Abred, where evil
and good equiponderate, man is free from all obligation, because
goodness and wickedness do not press one upon the other, nor does either
of them preponderate over the other. Therefore, the state of man is a
state of will and freedom and ability, where every act is one of project
and selection, consent and choice, and not of obligation and dislike,
necessity and inability. On this account man is a living being capable
of judgment, and judgment will be given upon him and his acts, for he
will be good or bad according to his works, since whatever he does he
could do differently; therefore it is right that he should receive
punishment or reward, as his works require.
