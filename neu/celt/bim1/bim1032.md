### THE BARDIC SECRET.

O I W are the three letters, and in very old books O I U, because U was
used instead of W, in the olden times. It is the secret word of the
primitive Bards, which it is not lawful to speak or utter audibly to any
man in the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span> <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

world, except to a Bard who is under the vow of an oath. The letters may
be shown to any one in the world we like, without uttering the
vocalization, which, under the protection of secrecy, is due to them,
though he be not under an oath; but should he utter them in speech
audibly, he violates his protection, and he cannot be a Bard, nor will
it be lawful to shew him any more of the secret, either in this world
that perishes, or in the other world that will not perish for ever and
ever. <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) Sion Bradford. <span

Nid addwyn i ddyn didduw  
A dwng gan *afrinaw* Duw  
Ei fyned i deg faenol  
Draw ’n y nef heb ei droi ’n ol.

It is not meet for a godless man,  
Who will swear, divulging God,  
To go into the fair manor,  
Yonder in heaven, without being turned back.
