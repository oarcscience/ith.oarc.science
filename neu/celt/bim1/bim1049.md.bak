### THE FIVE AGES OF LETTERS.

The five Ages of Letters. The first was the age of the three letters,
which above all represented the Name of God and goodness, and which were
a sign of goodness and truth, and understanding and equity, of
whatsoever kind they might be. Other things were exhibited under the
sign of blazonry in respect of the art of a herald-bard. This is the
mode in which they numbered ten according to the three letters, namely,
<span id="img_09500"></span> ![](img/09500.jpg), <span
id="img_09501"></span> ![](img/09501.jpg) being put for ten, and after
that <span id="img_09502"></span> ![](img/09502.jpg) for the second
tenth, that is, a hundred, and <span id="img_09503"></span>
![](img/09503.jpg) for the third tenth, that is, a thousand, and <span
id="img_09504"></span> ![](img/09504.jpg) for the fourth tenth, that is,
a myriad, and for a million <span id="img_09505"></span>
![](img/09505.jpg), and for buna <span id="img_09506"></span>
![](img/09506.jpg), and so on to three <span id="img_09507"></span>
![](img/09507.jpg), or four or more. According to this arrangement <span
id="img_09508"></span> ![](img/09508.jpg) stood for A, that is, the
first letter, <span id="img_09509"></span> ![](img/09509.jpg) for B,
that is, the second, <span id="img_09510"></span> ![](img/09510.jpg),
the third, <span id="img_09511"></span> ![](img/09511.jpg), the fourth,
<span id="img_09512"></span> ![](img/09512.jpg), <span
id="img_09513"></span> ![](img/09513.jpg), <span id="img_09514"></span>
![](img/09514.jpg), <span id="img_09515"></span> ![](img/09515.jpg),
<span id="img_09516"></span> ![](img/09516.jpg), and <span
id="img_09517"></span> ![](img/09517.jpg), the tenth letter, <span
id="img_09518"></span> ![](img/09518.jpg), <span id="img_09519"></span>
![](img/09519.jpg) the twelfth. This is the first age.

 

In the second age sixteen letters were arranged, whence literature
became more clear. After that, In the third age there were eighteen
letters, for the improvement of literature; that is, <span
id="img_09520"></span> ![](img/09520.jpg) was put for the second

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

sound of B; and then the three letters of God's Name were made into
<span id="img_09700"></span> ![](img/09700.jpg); and the eighteenth
letter was <span id="img_09701"></span> ![](img/09701.jpg), or,
according to another form, <span id="img_09702"></span>
![](img/09702.jpg).

In the fourth age there were twenty-four letters; and the Name of God,
according to the arrangement of the third age, was a secret.

The fifth age was, as it is now, that is, there were thirty-eight
letters; and the Name of God, according to the arrangement of the third
age, was kept a secret.
