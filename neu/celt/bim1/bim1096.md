### HU THE MIGHTY.

Hu <span id="fr_233"></span>[7](#fn_232) the Mighty,--Jesus the Son of
God,--the least in respect of His worldly greatness whilst in the flesh,
and the greatest in heaven of all visible majesties. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[\*](#fn_233)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_232"></span>[221:7](bim1096.htm#fr_233) <span
id="page_221">p. 221</span>The meaning of "Hu," is *that which is apt to
pervade*, or *to spread over*. It is used as an epithet of the Deity, in
reference to His omniscience, and is not <span id="page_222">p.
222</span> unfrequently to be met with as such in the works of the
Bards; thus Taliesin, describing the resurrection of our Lord,
observes,--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Trydedydd bu  
Dadebriad Hu.

On the third day was  
The resuscitation of Hu.  
          Llath Foesen. MS.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And Cynddelw,--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oedran Iesu Hu hoywdeg  
Yn wir Dduw un cant ar ddeg.

The age of Jesus, the fair and energetic Hu,  
In God's truth was eleven hundred.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rhys Goch Eryri,
also, in his "Cywydd Cyfrinach," speaks of "Pont Hu," the bridge of Hu,
in reference to the subject of the Incarnation; *pont* being a term used
bardically to denote a teacher that conveys his disciples over the bog
of ignorance. Hence the adage--"A fo ben bid bont." He who is head let
him be a bridge.

Derived from HU is the word HUON, used also as a Divine appellation;
e.g.,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gwae wynt ddydd brawd ger bron HUON. <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

Woe to them on the judgment day in the presence of HUON.  
                                   Geraint Vardd Glas, A.D. 900.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It also occurs in
the list of "the Names of God" by Sion Cent;--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

HUON, Ion, goreu i ddoniau.

HUON, and Ion, of best gifts.  
             Iolo MSS. p. 285.

</div>

Both Hu and HUON were no doubt originally identical with the HEUS of
Lactantius, and the HESUS of Lucan, described as gods of the Gauls. The
similarity of the last name to IESU is obvious and striking.

Hu the Mighty is, moreover, described in the Triads as a Historical
personage; that is, as the one who first established the Cymry in a
civil community, taught them agriculture, with other useful arts, and
conducted them over into the island of Britain. See Triad, 3rd Series,
Ap. Myv. Arch. vol. ii.

Beirdd Ynys Prydain."
