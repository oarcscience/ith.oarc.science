### THE TWELVE PRIMARY NEGATIVES. <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_223.md)

The twelve primary Negatives, called in some books the Lesson of the
Gwyddoniaid, but in other books the Lesson of Tydain.

There is nothing sought after but what is precious;  
There is nothing precious but what is beneficial;  
There is nothing beneficial but possession;  
There is no possession but Gwynvyd;  
There is no Gwynvyd but knowledge;  
There is no knowledge but what is new;  
There is nothing new but what changes;

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span> <span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

There is no change but what is advantageous;  
There is no advantage but what is beautiful;  
There is nothing beautiful but what is just;  
There is nothing just but love;  
There is no love but God.

And thus it ends.

Tydain the Father of Awen sang it, says the Book of Sion Cent.
