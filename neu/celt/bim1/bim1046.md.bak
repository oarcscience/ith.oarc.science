### THE SYMBOLS OF LITERARY SCIENCES.--IMPROVEMENT OF THE COELBREN.--METRICAL CANONS.--DISSOLUTION OF THE MONASTERY OF PEN RHYS.

There are three series of symbols of literary sciences: the symbols of
Coelbren; <span id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_122.md) the symbols of
music; <span id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_123.md) and the symbols of number.

The symbols of Coelbren are the most ancient of all, and were known to
the Gwyddoniaid from their first arrival in the island of Britain. The
primaries were ten, and were under the secret of the Bards. After that,
ten others were added, and the form and appearance of each of the
sixteen were totally altered from those of the ten primaries, so that
the secret could not be known. The sixteen were divulged in the time of
Dyvnwal Moelmud; and in the time of Beli the Great, son of Manogan, they
were included in the domestic instruction and sciences, and came under
the office and art of the domestic teacher, who was a Chaired Bard, that
is to say, a Druid; for the domestic Bards were called Druids in the
early times of the occupation of the island of Britain; it being
incumbent upon the nation of the Cymry to keep up the sciences of symbol
and literature. In the time of Arthur the symbols of Coelbren were
eighteen notches in number; and in the time of Geraint, the Blue Bard,
twenty; nor are there more than twenty of the primaries. After that,
mixed symbols were devised; that is to say, by means of a notch was made
the sign of sighing or breathing; and these were improved from time to
time until the time of Ieuan, son of the Dewless, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_124.md) the time when Robert, earl of
Gloucester, was prince of Glamorgan; and

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

from thence to the time of the last Clare but one, prince of Glamorgan.
It was the monks of Pen Rhys in the vale of Rhondde that arranged them
as they are at present, when Gwilym, son of Howel the Savage, called
Gwilym Tew, bore the Chair of vocal song there in right of the primary
Bards of the nation of the ancient Cymry. No other improvement of the
symbols of Coelbren ever took place, nor did what was done there obtain
the efficient judgment of active Chairs, as far as the third, or, if it
might be obtained, as far as the ninth, but where nine cannot be had, as
far as the seventh, and if seven cannot be had, as far as the fifth, and
where five cannot be had, as far as the third, and when there are not
three, as far as the one that there is; for individuals ought to be
unequal in number in order to have the judgment of a majority, that is,
the number that is above half, which cannot be the case, of irrevocable
fixedness, but where individuals are of unequal number, when they are
divided into two parts. Others of the ancient teachers say that a
majority may be obtained where the individuals are of equal numbers, by
conferring it as a privilege upon the first of the two halves that is
counted, under the condition of giving and taking the same as a claim,
before it is put to the verdict, and not otherwise. And it is in this
manner that the judgment of Chairs has been had upon the number of the
cut symbols of Coelbren,--that is, no judgment as far as the efficiency
of nine active Chairs, has been obtained upon the last improvement of
the cut symbols, and their number; nevertheless, the improvement has the
privilege of time beyond the memory of the ninth generation, and it
cannot be opposed. About the same time, namely, the time when Owain
Glyndwr was opposing the king of London, that is, in the time of King
Henry the Fifth, there was an Eisteddvod Chair in the monastery of Pen
Rhys, where the canons of the metres of vocal song were settled, among
which that of Gwilym Tew was adjudged the best, namely, the Ode which he
composed to Mary of Pen Rhys. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)
After that he improved the number and arrangement

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

of the metres and consonancies. It was in it (the Ode) that, by
privilege of Chair, parallel rhymes were first used. That Ode was
exhibited in the first Eisteddvod Chair of Caermarthen, under the
patronage of Gruffydd, son of Nicholas, <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) and under the privilege of leave and
license from Saint Henry the King, of Windsor, that is the fourth of the
name; and it continued under the privilege of Chair and Country until
the time of the second Eisteddvod there, where the canon of Davydd, son
of Edmund, <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_127.md) was pronounced the
best, in the time of Henry, the fifth of the name. When the year of
Christ was one thousand, four hundred, and fourteen, the monastery of
Pen Rhys was dispossessed, and its property sold, because it sided with
Owain Glyndwr.

extremely popular throughout the principality. He latterly joined the
Yorkists, in whose cause he fought, and was fatally wounded at the
battle of Mortimer's Cross, in 1461.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[93:2](bim1046.htm#fr_128.md) Davydd, son of
Edmund, was a native of Hanmer, in Flintshire, and is celebrated as the
reformer of Welsh Prosody, having compiled the twenty-four <span

by the Bards of North Wales, though they have been protested against by
those of Gwent and Morganwg as innovations.
