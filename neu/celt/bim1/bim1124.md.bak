### THE PREDICTION OF PEREDUR, THE BARD OF PRYDAIN. <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_330.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the sovereign <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_331.md) country shall
bewail a stratagem,  
And sorrow and dispersion happen to the secluded populace,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Blessed the lips that shall easily, and in confidential secrecy,  
Pronounce three words <span id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_332.md) of the
ancient and primitive language.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_330"></span>[365:1](bim1124.htm#fr_332.md) <span
id="page_364">p. 364</span> It is not quite clear whether "Bardd
Prydain," means here the Bard of Britain, that is, the Isle of Britain,
or the Bard of Prydain, the son of Aedd the Great. Among the
Gwyddoniaid, which was the name by which the priests and public teachers
were known previous to the reformation of Bardism under Prydain, we meet
with a son of Peredur Wrawn; and if this Gwrawn was the same as Gwron,
one of "the three primary Bards of the Isle of Britain," Peredur, in
point of time at least, might well be called the Bard of Prydain. There
were two others of the same name, who lived some time after the
Christian era; Peredur, the son of Eliver Gosgorddvawr, who lived about
the close of the fifth century, and Peredur, the son of Evrawg, a
chieftain who flourished in the early part of the sixth century, and is
mentioned by Aneurin as having fallen in the battle of Cattraeth.
Neither of these, however, is represented as of the Bardic order. We may
remark here, that, whenever the island of Britain is mentioned in old
documents, <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> it is almost invariably
described as Ynys Prydain, a circumstance which gives force to the
supposition that Peredur, in the heading of the above Prediction, was
meant for the Bard of the son of Aedd the Great.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[365:2](bim1124.htm#fr_333.md) "Gwarthefin " is
also one of the Names of the Deity, and is derived from *gwarthaf*, a
summit, or a surface.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[367:1](bim1124.htm#fr_334.md) <span
id="page_366">p. 366</span> These are the three primitive letters, <span
id="img_36600"></span> ![](img/36600.jpg), the secret of which was known
only to the Bards.
