### CHRONOLOGY.

Before the coming of Christ in the flesh, the Bards solemnized times
according to the years of memorial and computation, namely, from the
time of Prydain, the son of Aedd the Great, who was famous five hundred
and sixty-six years before the birth of Christ in the flesh; and from
that time it is usual with the Bards to celebrate the memorial and
computation of time in accordance with the years of Christ. Prydain, the
son of Aedd the Great, as far as memorial and knowledge go, lived the
time mentioned before the birth of Christ, and, according to the
conjecture of wise men, and well informed herald-bards, six hundred and
fifty years subsequently to the first arrival of the Cymry in the island
of Britain. It was thus, one thousand two hundred and six-teen years
before the birth of Christ that the nation of the Cymry first came into
the island of Britain, and this was called Brut time, because the years
of memory and computation were in old times conjecturally reckoned from
the time of Brut, <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_389.md) which was about
a thousand years after the demolition of the tower of Nimrod the Giant,
and about two thousand and eight hundred years after the expulsion of
Adam and Eve from the garden of Paradise, which occurred five <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_390.md) hundred years after God had made this
world.
