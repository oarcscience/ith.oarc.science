### PRIMARY CUTTINGS.--IMPROVEMENT OF THE COELBREN.--ITS RESTORATION.

In the early times of the nation of the Cymry letters were called
cuttings; and it was after the time of Beli, son of Manogan, that they
were called letters. Previously, there were no letters but the primary
cuttings, which had been a secret from the age of ages among the Bards
of the Isle of Britain, for the preservation of the memorials of country
and nation. Beli the Great made them into sixteen, and divulged that
arrangement, and appointed that there should never after be a
concealment of the sciences of letters, in respect of the arrangement
which he made; but he left the ten cuttings a secret.

After the coming of the faith in Christ, they were made eighteen; and
after that twenty, <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) and such they
were kept until the time of Geraint the Blue Bard, who made them
twenty-four.

They continued such for long ages, even until the time of king Henry the
Fifth, <span id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_89.md) who forbade schools, books,
and the materials of books for the Cymry. On that account the Cymry were
obliged to betake themselves in a body to the Coelbren of the Bards, and
to cut and blacken letters on wood

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span> <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

and rods; and every owner of a house and family, that wished to know the
sciences of letters and reading, took Bards into his house. And from
this was appointed the endowment of land, and tilth, and fold for the
Bards. And the Bards became numerous in Cymru, and the knowledge of
letters was greater than before the prohibition; where-fore Llawdden the
Bard <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) sang:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Beware of being wrong; see and observe--the throw  
And course of every privation;  
And the adage of this world,  
"That is not evil which produces good."</span>

</div>

That is to say, where there was no school to be had, but an English one,
and no teacher but a Saxon, the Cymry would study their own language and
sciences more than ever, and they improved and augmented the number of
letters and cuttings, until they completed the number, of which they now
consist.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[59:2](bim1029.htm#fr_89.md) <span id="page_58">p.
58</span> It may be remarked here that according to one version of the
Poem by Taliesin, in which the expression "Saith ugain Ogrfen y sydd yn
Awen," occurs, (See Antea [p. 48](bim1023.htm#page_48).md) the word "iaith"
is used instead of "Saith," which makes the meaning to be--"the language
of twenty letters is in Awen,"--a statement that in some measure bears
out that of the text.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[59:3](bim1029.htm#fr_90.md) <span id="page_59">p.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[61:1](bim1029.htm#fr_91.md) <span id="page_60">p.
