### THE MATERIAL OF THE WORLD.

Question. What material did God use in the formation of the world,
namely, the heaven and the earth, and other things known and conceived?

Answer. The manred, that is, the smallest of all the small, so that a
smaller could not be, which flowed <span id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_265.md)
in one sea through all the Ceugant--God being its life, and pervading
each atom, and God moving in it, and changing the condition of the
manred, without undergoing a change in

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span> <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Himself. For life
is unchangeable in all its motions, but the condition of that which is
moved is not one and the same. Therefore, because God is in every
motion, (ymmod,) one of God's Names is MODUR, <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) and the condition that is moved is
called *Moduransawdd*. <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_267.md)
