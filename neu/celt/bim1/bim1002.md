### ADVERTISEMENT,

IN preparing the present work for the press, it has been deemed
advisable to place the Welsh and English on opposite pages, as an
arrangement more convenient for the scholar, who may wish to test the
accuracy of the translation by a reference to the original.

Except to supply some of the headings, no liberty whatever has been
taken with the text. Even obvious and glaring errors, whether in the
orthography or punctuation, have been transferred to our pages exactly
as they were found in the manuscript.

The translation has been rendered as literal as possible, short of
becoming obscure. This was considered expedient, not only with the view
of exhibiting the style and idiom of the original, but in order to guard
against any misapprehension of the sense, which a free construction is
too apt to produce.

Notes, historical and explanatory, have been added, which, without being
cumbersome, it is to be hoped, will prove of considerable service to the
reader.

Our thanks are especially due to the Right Honourable Lord and Lady
Llanover for their kindness in allowing us free access to the MSS. of
Iolo Morganwg, from which the present Collection has been for the most
part made.
