### THE MODE OF TAKING FOOD AND DRINK. <span id="fr_328"></span>[\*](#fn_326)

When thou takest thy food, think of Him who gives it, namely, God, and
whilst thinking of His Name, with the word put the first morsel in thy
mouth, thank God for it, and entreat His grace and blessing upon it,
that it may be for the health of thy body and mind; then thy drink in
the same manner. And upon any other thing or quantity, which thou canst
not take with the Name of God in thy mind, entreat His grace and
blessing, lest it should prove an injury and a curse to thee. Whilst
thou art masticating thy food in the name of God, chew it small and
delicately, then swallow, drinking whilst thou swallowest. And whilst
thou art drinking in slow and spare draughts, conduct thyself towards
God, as at thy food; and let the voice of heart and conscience be
manifested in thee, and not heard by any other being than God.

My beloved teacher, prithee, tell me the meaning of the small and
delicate mastication of food, and the spare swallowing of drink?

Teacher. The small and delicate mastication involves a

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span> <span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

deep meaning, namely, that there should be no belief in, and reception
of judgment, or chronicle, or report, or marvel, or opinion, or concern,
or faith, or unbelief, without, as it were, chewing, turning, and
agitating it small and delicately, scattered and scrutinized, before it
be swallowed by the understanding and reason; that inquiry as to what is
necessary be made of him who knows about it, in respect of species, and
quality, and in respect of what is true or false in it; and that whilst
all this takes place, the unutterable Name of God, how it is to be
spoken by the mind of man, should be brought to memory and mind. Then
what thou hast taken into thy memory and mind, thy reason and
understanding, will be to thee a grace and a blessing, good for thyself,
and good for all men, and the grace of God's chief blessing will dwell
upon thee.
