### Footnotes

<span id="fn_327"></span>[361:1](bim1123.htm#fr_329.md) <span
id="page_360">p. 360</span> Trahaiarn Brydydd Mawr, or the Great Poet,
flourished from about 1290 to 1350. He presided at the Glamorgan Gorsedd
in 1300. Two of his poems are printed in the Myvyrian Archaiology. He is
also supposed to have been the same person as the one who distinguished
himself under the assumed name of Casnodyn, which is subscribed to five
other poems in the same collection.--Williams' Eminent Welshmen.
