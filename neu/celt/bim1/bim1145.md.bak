### PARTICULAR TRIADS.

1\. There are three Persons in heaven: the Father; the Son; and the Holy
Ghost.

2\. There are three particular ones: the one true element, the necessary
deluge; the one element, from which all men proceed, namely, the earth;
and the one element of life, namely God.

3\. There are three particular twos: the two particular stars, namely,
the sun and moon; and the two elements, into which all men will go,
namely, the heaven and the earth. <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_357.md)

4\. There are three particular threes, namely: the three days that Adam
and Eve were taken from. <span id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_358.md)

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span> <span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

5\. There are three particular fours: the four materials of man, namely,
fire, air, water, and earth.

6\. There are three particular fives: the five senses of man; the five
books of Moses; and the five zones of the earth. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_359.md)

7\. There are three particular sixes, namely: the six ages of the world;
the six stone vessels, the water in which Jesus turned into wine, at the
marriage feast of John the Evangelist; <span
id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_360.md) and the six perceptions of man.

8\. The three particular sevens: the seven sacraments of the Church; the
seven petitions of Pater Noster; and the seven days of the week.

9\. The three particular eights: the eight deadly sins; the eight that
went with Noah into the ark; and the eight winds.

10\. The three particular nines: the nine waves of the ocean; the nine
graces of heaven; and the nine months of gestation.

11\. Three particular tens: the ten commandments; the ten lengths of
numeration; <span id="fr_363"></span>[3](#fn_361.md) and the ten degrees of
God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_357"></span>[395:1](bim1145.htm#fr_359.md) <span
id="page_394">p. 394</span> It will be observed that this and the two
following Triads are imperfect.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[395:2](bim1145.htm#fr_360.md) The meaning of this
statement is not very clear. We are not sure whether it is intended that
our first parents were expelled from Paradise within three days of their
creation, or whether they were deprived of the holy enjoyment of three
days, or portions of days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, that closed the
first week of time. Or are we to understand that Adam and Eve were
formed out of the constituents or elements of three days? The first
notion would not be consistent with the opinion that generally prevailed
in the middle ages, which represents them as having continued but seven
hours in their state of <span id="page_395">p. 395</span> innocency. "
Et ut tradunt historiagraphi eos fuisse in Paradiso per vii. horas et
non ultra et statim ejecti sunt." Eulog. Hist. c. viii.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[397:2](bim1145.htm#fr_362.md) Though, according
to the ancients, St. John always led a single life, many of the middle
writers of the Church, assert that he was married, and that it was his
marriage which our Lord was at in Cana of Galilee. Bed. Prœf. in Ioan.
Rupert. Tuit. Comm. in Ioan. lib. ii. in fin. Cyr. in Ioan, cap. 2, et
alii.
