The Barddas of Iolo Morganwg is a collection of writings, largely
forged, about ancient Welsh Bardic and Druidic beliefs. Although the
author of this work is cited as J. Williams Ab Ithel, he was actually
the editor, who pieced it together from manuscripts written by Iolo
Morganwg. Iolo Morganwg (1747-1826), itinerant poet and scholar, was a
key figure in the Druid revival of the 19th century. He was personally
responsible for reviving the Welsh national poetry contest, the Gorsedd.
On June 21st, 1792, Midsummer evening, Iolo and a dozen other Welsh
poets gathered on Primrose Hill in London and held the first Gorsedd in
hundreds of years. Iolo was a Welsh patriot and held revolutionary
views; he was a personal friend of [Tom
Paine](../../../aor/paine/index), and George Washington subscribed to
his first volume of poetry. He is said to have influenced both William
Blake's poetry and Robert Grave's [White
Goddess](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374504938/internetsacredte).
He revived the concept that the Welsh explorer Madoc discovered America.
This led to an expedition to Mandan territory in the Great Plains, which
found no trace of the Welsh, but was one of the inspirations for Thomas
Jefferson's Lewis and Clarke expedition.

Iolo Morganwg's contributions to world culture are still with us today;
there is an extensive neo-Druid movement; and the Gorsedd (and Welsh
nationalism) are still going strong. The Gorsedd is held annually during
the Eisteddfod in Wales, a festival of Welsh culture. Two other Celtic
regions, Cornwall and Brittany, have also adopted the Gorsedd.

Iolo Morganwg, born Edward Williams, a native speaker of both English
and Welsh, spent his entire life collecting and transcribing mediaeval
Welsh documents, as well as writing poetry under his own byline. He was
also a first-rate literary forger of ancient Welsh; some have commented
that his forgeries were as good or better than the real thing.
Furthermore, he wrote much of the Barddas under the influence of
laudanum (an opium-based medication which he took for asthma). Scholars
have spent two centuries trying to establish which parts of his
extensive writings purporting to be based on ancient manuscripts are
genuine, and which he wrote personally. Our understanding is still very
murky. For these reasons, Iolo's writings are considered highly
controversial.

Because Druidic beliefs were exclusively transmitted orally, we have no
primary accounts of it, so there is practically nothing to compare this
text with. What we do know is summarized neatly in the Preface to this
work, and consists of a few excerpts from classical authors. The longest
account is from Julius Caesar, who was more interested in exterminating
Druids, so he was hardly a disinterested observer.

However, this is one of those *visionary* texts which is worth reading
for its own merits, irrespective of whether it is 'genuine' or not.
Taken at face value, the Barddas remains a fascinating text. It has
resonances with the [Upanishads](../../../hin/upan/index),
[Kabbalah](../../../jud/index.htm#kabbalah), and
[Freemasonry](../../../mas/index). The Bardic alphabet presented in the
'Symbol' section is completely invented, based on Runic and Ogham, and
has utility as a magical alphabet. However it is about as genuine as the
alphabets of [J.R.R. Tolkien](../../../ring/index). The 'Theology'
section appears to be based on Iolo's peculiar Christian views (he
described himself as a Unitarian Quaker). 'Theology' also contains a
great number of Triads, some of which may be from authentic ancient
Bardic lore. The 'Wisdom' section has a great deal of mythopoetic
information, some of which is authentic, some not. The Barddas is great
reading if you are at all interested in the ancient Druids, as long as
you keep in mind the background of its creation.

Production notes: I have omitted the Welsh text of this book, which was
printed on the even numbered pages, but retained all page numbers. The
English footnotes often started on the facing (preceding) page and
occasionally continue on for several pages, so I have taken care to
document page numbers in footnotes. I have omitted sporadic footnotes
which were only relevant to the Welsh text, except in a few cases where
they also impact the understanding of the English translation. These
footnotes use asterisks instead of numbers.
