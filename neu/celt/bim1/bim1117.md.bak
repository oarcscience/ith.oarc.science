### THE TRIADS OF ST. PAUL. <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_274.md)

1\. The three principal duties of a Christian: belief in Christ; hope in
God; and love to man.

2\. The three dispositions of an unchristian man: pride; cruelty; and
falsehood.

3\. The three signs of a Christian: to love truth, however great may be
the loss; to love one's country, however great may be the suffering; and
to love an enemy, however great may be his treachery.

4\. Three things without which a man cannot be a Christian: holiness of
life; divine counsels; and suffering without complaint.

5\. The three friends of every true Christian: reason; patience; and
conscience.

6\. The three joys of a Christian: the love of God; the happiness of
man; and the success of truth.

7\. Three things which every good man will be: industrious; pacific; and
benevolent.

8\. Three things which God has given for the instruction of man: natural
reason; the judgment of conscience; and the Gospel of Christ.

9\. From three words will be one word of God:. love; truth; and justice;
and these three words are one word with God, and there can be no other
word from God than love.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

10\. Three questions that were put to Christ: the first, "What is
truth?" and He said, "Love;" the second, "What is justice?" and He said,
Love;" and the third, "What is love?" and He said, "God."

11\. God consists of three things: the most powerful of all that can be
comprehended; the most just of all that can be comprehended; and the
most merciful of all that can be comprehended.

12\. There are three things belonging to God, the magnitude of which
cannot be comprehended: His power; His justice; and His mercy.

13\. There are three things, which, in virtue of the attributes and
nature of God, cannot but exist: all justice; all love; and all beauty.

14\. Three things without which nothing can be well known: the nature
that ought to be; the reason of what is possible; and the commandments
of God beyond every one of the two, and yet not opposed to them.

15\. There are three views of God: what is greatest of all things; what
is best of all things; and what is most beautiful of all things.

16\. The three co-destinies of all men: the same beginning; the same
course; and the same end.

17\. The three excellences of God: being the first of all things; the
chief of all things; and the most complete of all things.

18\. There are three ways in which God can be seen: in Himself, in
power; in Christ, by sight; and in the soul of man, as to His Holy
Spirit.

19\. There are three sufficiencies, from which will ensue life
everlasting: sufficiency of truth; sufficiency of knowledge; and
sufficiency of love.

20\. From three sufficiencies there is every insufficiency: sufficiency
of worldly riches; sufficiency of bodily strength; <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_275.md) and sufficiency of idleness. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_276.md)

21\. The three words of advice, which Jesus Christ gave above all other
advices: first, love thy God with all thy

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span> <span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

soul; secondly, love thy neighbour with all thy heart; and, thirdly,
love thy own reputation with all thy wisdom; and no one can ask more of
thee.

22\. Three men that will please God: he who loves every living being
with all his heart; he who accomplishes every thing that is handsome
with all his strength; and he who seeks every knowledge with all his
understanding.

23\. A conscientious man will be three things: wise; amiable; and merry.

24\. The three marks of non-conscientiousness: to be unwise; timid; and
petulant.

25\. Three things, it is not known which of them is the worst: the
devil; a perjured man; and an unmerciful man.

26\. There are three things of God: to desire existence to what can be
the best of all things; to believe that there is existence to what is
the best possible of all things; and to conduct one's self in the best
way possible in every thing.

27\. Three things spoken to Paul from heaven: love thy God above all
things; love thy truth as thy own soul; and love thy neighbour as
thyself.

28\. The three marks of a neighbour, by which he may be known wherever
he is: to be poor; to be a stranger; and to be in the image of a man.

29\. There are three duties towards God, without which there can be no
godliness, or the attainment of heavenliness: belief; fear; and love.

30\. Three things which the godly shall enjoy: union with God; perfect
gwynvyd; and complete knowledge;--the whole for ever, without cessation,
without end.

31\. The three organs of the intellect: thought; word; and deed; and
they are called the three faculties. <span
id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_277.md)

32\. The three exercises of the faculties, or the three organs,
commanded by Christ, namely: do good with all thy energies wherever, and
in whatever there may be cause and requirement; <span
id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_278.md) and be patient unto death, without
repining, in behalf of goodness, whenever, and on what occasion so ever
there may be need and requirement;--and all this

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span> <span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

with all thy power, with all thy affection, and with all thy
understanding.

33\. The three paths towards truth: to understand it; to love it; and to
desire it. <span id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_279.md)

34\. Three things, by the performance of which, all relating to
godliness will be accomplished: to avoid the world; <span
id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_280.md) to deny the flesh; and to resist the
Cythraul.

35\. The three foundations of wisdom: understanding; love; and justice.

36\. The three measuring rods of justice: what is adjudged right in
another; what fears the opposition of what is not right <span
id="fr_283"></span>[3](#fn_281.md) from another; and what is sought,
according to desire, in respect of what is adjudged right in another.

37\. The three corroborations of justice: what is found right by
experience, exercise, and understanding; what is taught as right, in
respect of acquirement, judgment, and conscience, to another; and what
is desired, in virtue of what has been acquired, judged, and learned,
from another. What will oppose these primary characteristics can have no
claim or privilege.

38\. The three measuring rods of the understanding: the judgment of
another; poise and counterpoise; and the guidance of meditation
with <span id="fr_284"></span>[4](#fn_282.md) affection; and, according as
these things are, will be the extent and nature of the understanding.

39\. The three marks of a godly man: to seek after truth; to perform
justice; and to exercise mercy.

40\. There are three things that are one whole, as to primary and
original derivation: justice; truth; and love; for from one, namely,
love, the whole proceeds as one right from God, inasmuch as there is
only one right of the whole in being and existence.

41\. For three reasons ought a man to renounce life, where <span
id="fr_285"></span>[5](#fn_283.md) there is occasion: seeking after truth;
cleaving to justice; and performing mercy.

42\. Three things that corrupt the world: pride; extravagance; and
indolence.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span> <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

43\. The three principal qualities of godliness: to speak the truth in
spite of him who may withstand <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_284.md) it;
to love all that is comely and good; and to suffer heartily in behalf of
the truth and every thing that is good.

44\. Three things which cannot be finite: God; expanse; and time.

45\. Three things that make a sinner: fear; covetousness; and ignorance.

46\. Three things that corrupt the world: pride; extravagance; and
indolence. <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_285.md)

47\. The three principal qualities of godliness: consideration; justice;
and love.

48\. In three things will a godly man be one with God: in knowing every
thing; in loving every thing; and in freeing himself from every thing.

49\. Three littles that will cause much evil: a little deceit; a little
anger; and a little ignorance.

50\. The three principal things <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_286.md)
which God requires reflection; justice; and love. <span
id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_287.md)

51\. Three things which, being disregarded, will draw down vengeance:
the advice of a seer; rational judgment and the complaint of the poor.

52\. The three unions that support every thing: the union of love with
justice; the union of truth with imagination; and the union of God with
contingency.

53\. The three marks of godliness: to do justice; to be fond of mercy;
and to behave obediently under every circumstance.

54\. There are <span id="fr_290"></span>[5](#fn_288.md) three things, God
does not love those who love to see them: to see fighting; to see a
monster and to see the pomp of pride.

55\. The three principal manifestations of God: His works; His word; and
His Spirit.

56\. In respect of three things will a man have his object in unison
with the will of God, namely: when he believes only his own senses; when
he imagines only with his own

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span> <span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

consideration; and when he has to do only with his own conscience.

57\. Three men who will speak differently, according to their nature and
disposition: a man of God, who will speak the best part of the truth,
for the sake of peace, advantage, and concord; a man of man, who will
speak the whole of the truth, be it good, be it evil, come what will,
whatever may ensue in consequence; a man of the devil, who will speak
the worst part of the truth, in order to harm and cause misfortune--a
ready devil will speak an assiduous falsehood for the sake of mischief
and ruin.

58\. Three things, wherever they are, there can be no godliness:
revelling; pride; and covetousness.

59\. The three marks of godliness: disinterested love; courageous
obedience; and affectionate silence.

60\. Three men who stand in the relation of brothers and sisters: an
orphan; a widow; and a stranger.

61\. The three blessed ones of God: the gentle; the peaceable; and the
merciful.

62\. The three characteristics of the children of God: a pure
conscience; unostentatious demeanour; and voluntary suffering in the
cause of truth and love.

63\. The three principal commandments of God: love; justice; and
obedience.

64\. The three signs of a just man: to love truth; to love peace; and to
love an enemy.

65\. The three principal delights of a godly man: justice; mercy; and
gentleness.

66\. The three encouragements of mischief: voluptuousness; fighting; and
inconstancy.

67\. The three counsels, <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_289.md) which
Jesus Christ gave to His followers, namely, He counselled: first,
perpetual poverty; because thereby all violence, usurpation, extortion,
and covetousness, will cease, and consequently perfect justice will be
obtained; secondly, voluntary obedience, for the sake of such as may
demand it in every thing that is sin-less, and consequently there will
be an end to all quarrelling,

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span> <span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

contention, and pride, and perfect peace and tranquillity will be
obtained; thirdly, pure and perfect love, in the exercise of all
affection, kindness, mercy, charity, mutual defence, and civility,
towards such as may deserve them, and of all kindness, peace, quietness,
and almsgiving, towards such as do not deserve, and in the endeavour to
rectify whatever is not right, in respect of man, system, or usage,
leaving to God what in his judgment he concludes to be just. From
following these three counsels will the three special felicities be
attained, which three felicities are: first, no goodness can be
commanded, which will not be performed, kept, and completed; secondly,
there can be no just and merciful deed, which will not be performed;
thirdly, there can be no debt which will not be paid, and discharged, no
request which will not be obtained, and no deficiency which will not be
supplied. Thus also will be obtained the three deliverances, namely:
there will be no transgression <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_290.md)
which will not be set right; no displeasure which will not be forgiven;
and no anger which will not be pacified. And thence will be obtained the
three excellences: first, there will be nothing ill-favoured, which
shall not be adorned; secondly, there will be no evil, which shall not
be removed; <span id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_291.md) thirdly, there will be
no desire, which shall not be attained. And from reaching this mark: in
the first place, there can be nothing, which shall not be known; there
can be no loss of anything beloved, which shall not be regained;
thirdly, there can be no end to the gwynvyd which shall be attained. And
it is not necessary that there should be in understanding might and love
other than these things, with the careful performance of what is
possible.

68\. There are three men of different dispositions and qualities: <span
id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_292.md) a man of God, who does good for evil; a
man of man, who does good for good, and evil for evil; and a man of the
devil, who does evil for good.

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span> <span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

69\. There are three men, who will get what they seek from God: he who
seeks to become better in his heart; he who seeks to know the truth; and
he who seeks the benefit and good of his neighbour. <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_293.md)

70\. The three counsels of Lazarus: <span
id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_294.md) believe thy God, for He made thee: love
thy God, for He redeemed thee; and fear thy God, for He will judge thee.

71\. Three things, if borne in mind, will keep one from sinning: the
commandments of God; the joy of heaven; and the punishment of sin.

and beauty.

riches out of love for man; to lose fame out of love for civilization;
and to lose life out of love for the truth.

75\. The three losses of the body that will bring gain to the soul: the
loss of health; the loss of wealth; and the loss of hatred.

76\. There are three kinds of falsehood: the falsehood of word and
saying; the falsehood of deed; and the falsehood of demeanour. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[5](#fn_297.md)

77\. From three blessings will the blessing of God be obtained: the
blessing of father and mother; the blessing of the poor and sick; <span
id="fr_300"></span>[6](#fn_298.md) and the blessing of the distressed
stranger. <span id="fr_301"></span>[7](#fn_299.md)

78\. The three manifestations of God: Fatherhood creating the world;
Sonship teaching the world; and Spirituality supporting and governing
the world.

teach it; and to fear it.

80\. For three reasons ought a man to part with <span
id="fr_302"></span>[8](#fn_300.md) life, if

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span> <span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

it be required: seeking after truth; cleaving to justice; and performing
mercy.

81\. The three supports of a godly man: God and His gift of grace;
conscience itself; and the praise of every wise and good man.

82\. The three counsels of Lazarus: obey God Who made thee; love God Who
redeemed thee; and fear God Who will call thee to judgment for thy
works.

83\. Three things that concur in will and tendency with all goodness:
God in His power and favour; a wakeful conscience; and the judgment of
wise and godly men.

and seeking.

understands its intent--and of doing which goodness he would not repent
during life, such as practising justice, mercy, generosity, and
forbearance, unrepented of, and with full disposition and love towards
those good things, and towards what he does in their behalf; the second
is the goodness which he produces of his free will and endeavour for a
particular purpose, being thereby the cause, which produces the said
goodness, such as rearing children, and teaching them to be godly, and
workers of good, with a just information and understanding of the good
that ought to be performed, to the utmost ability of the man who seeks
to do it; the third is the goodness which he would do of the free will
and desire of his heart, were it possible for him, if he had the means,
time, ability, and knowledge, and which good things he would not undo by
word, deed, demeanour, or wish, ever after of his own accord, in that he

would be the effect of

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span> <span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

his act towards those things. And these goodnesses are adjudged and
privileged by God, according to the amount of power, affection,

active goodnesses, which would do so, in that they had the power,
affection, means, place, and time.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span> <span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

that he may do justice and almsgiving; to benefit man in every

to justice in every thing.

150\. There are three special duties incumbent on man: to support
himself and family through industry and uprightness; to benefit his
fellow-men in every undertaking and employment, in which be may be
engaged; and to impart

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span> <span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

instruction in divine morality to every man, wherever he goes.

151\. Three things which a man shall have from early rising: worldly
riches; bodily health; and spiritual joy.

152\. Three things which do not become a godly man: to look with one
eye; to listen with one ear; and to help with one hand.

153\. The three measuring rods of every man: his God; his devil; and his
indifference.

154\. The three foundations of piety: active justice;
[perceptive](errata.htm#3.md) truth; and energetic love.

155\. The three necessaries of goodness: knowledge; consideration; and
lovingness.

156\. There are three principal qualities, out of which spring all the
other good qualities: mercy, and its characteristic is to give alms,
protection, sustenance, and instruction, as occasion is seen; obedience
proceeding from humility, and its characteristic is to receive alms,
protection, and ad-vice, with manly decency, and peacefulness; justice,
and its characteristic sign is to do what is right, according to
conscience and understanding, in defiance of the man who may oppose him,
and to suffer bravely in behalf of what he may judge as right, whatever
it may be, and every hardship and oppression soever, which may ensue,
even if he had to die for what he did and judged.

157\. There are three gifts of charity: food; protection; and
instruction in the way of advice and demonstration.

158\. Three things that will remind man of his duty towards God and man:
alms; fasting; and prayer.

159\. Three things that will effect just godliness: to love God; love
towards all living beings; and to love all that is gentle and just.

160\. The three counsels that Jesus Christ gave to His servants: love
thy God above all, and obey Him in all things; love thy neighbour as
thou lovest thyself, and do for him what thou wouldest he should do for
thee; seek praiseworthy sciences, because from them thou wilt rightly

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span> <span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

understand what thou shouldest love, obey, and do homage to, and what
thou shouldest do for me and for him. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_308.md)

161\. The three counter-forces of all knowledge, art, and wisdom: lack
of seeking; excessive seeking; and blind seeking.

162\. The three fences of wisdom: truth; love; and prudence. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_309.md)

163\. Three things that will close against wisdom: avarice; inordinate
desire; and over-hastiness.

164\. The three principal concerns of the world: godliness; praiseworthy
sciences; and industry, to prevent waste.

165\. The three gains that will turn out a loss in the end: to gain fame
for an injurious feat or act; to gain wealth by injustice; and to gain
the mastery in evil contention.

166\. Three things that will turn out a great gain in the end: to lose
the world's goods by giving alms; to lose the praise and regard of the
world for a blessed act and disposition; and to lose one's life in the
cause of truth and justice.

167\. The three qualities of just knowledge: love for what is best,
desiring to know it; seeking judiciously for what is best, that it might
be known and recognised; <span id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_310.md) and
choosing with judgment and prudence what is found to be the best, and
cleaving to it. That is, the three qualities are, love, judgment, and
choice.

168\. In three ways may the will of God be known: in resigning one's
self to His will and commandments; in judging rightly and thoroughly
what is possible to God, in respect to His godliness, and what is
derived from God; and in judging what is due to God, in respect of His
justice, power, and love. By reviewing these things may the will of God
be understood and seen.

169\. From three things will God and His will be comprehended and known:
from doing what God would do, as became Him, in respect of His divinity
and necessary attributes;

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span> <span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

from loving what God would love, in virtue of His divine and perfect
love, for what is perfect cannot love what is imperfect; and from
judging what God would judge, in virtue of His great power, justice, and
love. As far as possible, by means of this wise provision may be known
the will and purpose of God; and hereby will Awen from God be obtained.

170\. The three dispositions of the mind, which can prognosticate the
future, and the means of knowing what will hereafter happen to man,
country, and nation: the first, obedience to God, performing what ought
to be; the second, Awen from God, judging what is due from God, for God
will not do anything but what ought to be, as required by His love,
justice, and power; hence may be known what will take place, for what is
due from God will inevitably occur, in virtue of His nature and
attributes. And nothing but what God requires should be, can take place;
and what ought to be cannot but be, in respect of the power and justice
of God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_274"></span>[291:1](bim1117.htm#fr_276.md) <span
id="page_290">p. 290</span> Iolo Morganwg, whose transcript we have
adopted on the present occasion, observes of St. Paul's Triads, that
they are found in MSS. of a date anterior to the Reformation. We embody
them in our Collection, because some of them, as Series the Third, not
only associate Bardism with their Pauline Title, but also contain
unmistakable traces of pre-Christian doctrines. It would seem, as in the
case of the Ten Commandments, that the early Christians of Britain held
the memory of the Great Apostle of the Gentiles likewise in peculiar
veneration. Besides "Trioedd Pawl," or the Triads of St. Paul, allusion
is frequently made to "Pregeth Pawl," or St. Paul's Sermon, and
"Deifregwawd Pawl," St. Paul's distichs or verses. These, with "Efengyl
Ieuan," or the Gospel of St. John, seem to have constituted the only
Cymric writings, which, in the infancy of the Church, contained the
doctrines of Christianity. It is probable that the attachment of the
Cymry to the name of St. Paul had some reference to the supposed share
he had in the foundation of their Church. It is not necessary, in order
to establish their claim to authenticity, that the Triads in question
should have been actually composed by the Apostle himself; though it is
quite possible that he might have dictated their substance to Bran the
Blessed, who happened to be at Rome at the same time with St. Paul.
Bran, being a Bard, would naturally <span id="page_291">p. 291</span>
throw them into the Triadic form, as that which was best calculated at
the time to impress them on the public memory. Or perhaps they were
composed by the Bards, and received the sanction of the Gorsedd, after
these had in general become converts to Christianity--the name of St.
Paul being associated with then, because they were either derived from
his writings, or supposed to be in unison with his doctrine. There is
reason, indeed, to suppose that some of them were derived immediately
from some Apocryphal Scriptures, such as those which refer to the
Counsels of Lazarus. Though a Bardic tone runs through the whole, yet,
as already hinted, it is more observable in the Third Series than in
either of the other two. But whether that formed a part of the original
compilation--afterwards separated from it as being of a too Druidic
character, or whether it is altogether a distinct document, the work of
a different school of Bards, we have no means of ascertaining.
