### THE ORIGIN OF LETTERS, ROLL, AND PAPER.--THE VIRTUE OF LETTERS.

MAY it please your information, my beloved teacher; pray, tell me who
was the first that made a Letter?

Einiged the Giant, son of Huon, son of Alser, <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) son of Javan, <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) son of Japheth, son of Noah the Aged,
after the death of his father, for the purpose of preserving a memorial
of what he did, and of his praiseworthy actions, warranted in respect of
credibility and information. And because it was on wood (pren) that such
belief was first placed, both the letters, and what they were inscribed
on, were called *Coelbren*. <span id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span> <span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Who was the first that made a Roll <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)
in connection with letters?

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span> <span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Bran the Blessed, <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) son of Llyr of
Defective Speech, learned that mode at Rome, and brought it with him to
Britain, where he taught it to the Cymry, as well as the manner of
dressing the skins of kids and goats, so as to be suitable for written
letters. And that mode became customary, so that the Bards alone
practised, as it were by bare rescue, the old style of inscribing
letters on wood, for the purpose of preserving the memorials of the old
and primitive sciences of the nation of the Cymry; thence it came to be
called *Coelbren of the Bards*. At present there are only the Bards that
keep it in memory, by engraving their songs and records on wood,
according to the ancient art, with the view of preserving in reliable
memory the primitive sciences of the nation of the Cymry.

Who was the first that made paper?

A man from Constantinople, named Moran; he ground flax, which on its
being thinly spread out, became paper.

What is the virtue of letters?

They are mute organs that speak--a body without a soul, and without
life, guiding thought--dead ones, knowing more than the living--a hand
speaking better than the tongue--an eye hearing better than the ear,
without either noise or sound--speech without a tongue--hearing without
an ear--

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span> <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

language without words--form of voice--a messenger uttering the truth,
without knowing it--the dead teaching the living--memory with no one
guiding it--the understanding of the dead--the principal skill of the
art of the living--the preservation of all arts and sciences--and the
demonstration of all that is demonstrable.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[11:1](bim1018.htm#fr_41.md) <span id="page_10">p.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[11:2](bim1018.htm#fr_42.md) It is remarkable that,
contrary to the popular notion which represents Gomer as the progenitor
of the Cymry, Nennius, the Genealogy of Gruffydd ab Cynan, in the 2nd
volume of the Myvyrian Archaiology--and other Pedigrees registered by
Lewis Dwnn, all support the view of the text as to the descent of that
people from Javan. Nennius, indeed, asserts positively that his
information was derived "ex traditione veterum, qui incolæ in primo
fuerunt Britanniæ."

<span id="fn_43"></span>[11:3](bim1018.htm#fr_43.md) That is, *wood of
credibility*. The ancient mode of cutting letters on wood is frequently
alluded to in the poems of the Bards, both early and medieval. Thus;

The eulogistic book of a purblind bard,  
It is difficult to rightly understand it,

</div>

A long string of similar quotations might be adduced, but the foregoing
are sufficient to show that the practice in question was known to the
Bards from the 6th down to the 17th century.

It may be observed that several words in the Cymric language, which
relate to knowledge or literature, have a primary reference to wood.
Thus; *arwydd*, a sign; *cyfarwydd*, skilful; *cyfarwyddyd*,
information; *cywydd*, a species of versification, also revelation;
*dedwydd*, having recovered knowledge, happy; *derwydd*, a Druid;
*egwyddawr*, a rudiment, an alphabet; *gwgddawr*, a rudiment; *gwyddon*,
a man of science; *gwynwyddigion*, men of sacred knowledge.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[13:1](bim1018.htm#fr_44.md) Though Roll, as in the
text, primarily refers to the schedule that was turned up with the hand
in the form of a pipe, it came also to denote a system, or arrangement,
as in the phraseologies, *Rhol y Crythor*, *Rhol y Telynor*, *Rhol y
Mesurau*, *Rhol Iolo Goch*, *Rhol Achau*, *Rhol Cof a Chyfrif*, and
*Rhol y Beirdd*. It is alluded to by many of the Bards; thus--

DAVYDD AB GWILYM, 1300-1368.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Bydd yr un *Rhol* ag Iolo  
Ddefod hardd, hen fardd y fro.

He will be of the same *Roll* as Iolo,  
Fair usage--the old Bard of the district.

celebrated Caractacus. Bran is said to have remained at Rome for seven
years as hostage for his son. (Tr. 35. Third Series). It was then that
be acquired the information imputed to him in the text.
