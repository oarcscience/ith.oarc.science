### CHRONOLOGY.

Prydain, the son of Aedd Mawr, was born on the morning of Alban Eilir,
that is, the ninth day of March, according to the computation of the
Romans; therefore the beginning of the year was fixed on his day, as a
day of feast and institution, as it is still to this day. In old times
it was called the first day of Cyntevin, <span
id="fr_386"></span>[10](#fn_384.md) the end of Cyntevin being the feast of
Alban Hevin <span id="fr_387"></span>[11](#fn_385.md) From thence to Alban
Elved <span id="fr_388"></span>[12](#fn_386.md) it was called Summer, and
also Harvest; from Alban Elved to Alban Arthan <span
id="fr_389"></span>[13](#fn_387.md) it was called Autumn; and from thence
to Alban Eilir, <span id="fr_390"></span>[14](#fn_388.md) Winter.

According to the computation of the Church and the Courts of Law, Alban
Eilir was said to be the tenth of March, but in the chronology of the
Cymry and the Romans it was said to be the ninth of March.

Before the time of Prydain, the son of Aedd the Great, the beginning of
the year was fixed upon the day of Alban Arthan, which was the ninth of
the month of December, according to the chronology of the Cymry. (See
John Jones's Almanack, 1752.)
