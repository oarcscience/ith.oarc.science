### YEARS OF THE SUN AND MOON.

There are two calculations of years: one is the year of the sun,
consisting of 365 days; the other is the year of the moon, having 354
days. The days which are over and above the number of the lunar year are
called days of days, and they are thus distributed among the Albans,
that is to say;--two days of days to Alban Arthan, three to Alban Eilir,
three to Alban Hevin, and three to Alban Elved. They are free days, and
let any one come from any place he may, he will be free, and exposed to
no weapon or stroke, since there can be no court and law of country on
those days. <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_418)
