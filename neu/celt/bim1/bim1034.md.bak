### THE PRIMARY LETTERS.--IMPROVEMENT OF THE ALPHABET.

Before the faith in Christ was obtained, no other than twelve letters
were used, namely, a, e, i, o, b, d, g, l, m, n, r, s. After the coming
of the faith, sixteen were put in use, then the art of the twelve
letters was lost, nor is there at present any one that knows it, except
from conjecture. After the coining of Taliesin eighteen letters were
used; and it was according to the art of the system of eighteen that O I
