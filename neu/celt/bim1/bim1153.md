### MEMORIAL AND COMPUTATION.

Chronological memorial and computation were reckoned from the time of
Prydain, son of Aedd the Great, who lived four hundred and eighty years
before the time when Christ came in the flesh. When Bran the Blessed,
the son of Llyr, had exhibited the faith in Christ to the nation of the
Cymry, and made them believers in the island of Britain, they began to
compute time according to the years of Christ. Some maintain that every
cry of country and Gorsedd ought to be dated from the time of Prydain,
that is, according to the custom of the ancient Cymry; others maintain
that such

should be done in conjunction with the years of Christ; whilst others
will have only the years of Christ.

(Sion Bradford.)
