### CUTTINGS.--FOUNDATIONS OF AWEN.

<span id="img_05100"></span> ![](img/05100.jpg). It was from the three
signs that Einigan the Giant obtained so good an understanding of
letters, which he cut on staves. He devised the mode, and made
twelve <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_76) principal letters, if the
books of the wise are true, which are called the ten radicals. As to
what they are, and what their forms, it is a secret in the mystery of
the Bards of the nation of the Cymry, namely, the Gwyddoniaid, who are
called the primary Bards. They are three of the primary radicals, that
is, the three cuttings; and they are called cuttings, because they are
cut out of the dark into three rays; and for the same reason we say, the
break of dawn, <span id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_77) to cut a field, to
cut or break out. The third break out was the voice of a song of
triumph, that is, the first voice was a voice of triumph.

The three foundations of Awen from God: to understand the truth; to love

the question is the degree of Chair obtained or refused. The answer is
between the aspirant and his conscience, and between his conscience and
God, not between him and his teacher.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_75"></span>[51:1](bim1024.htm#fr_76) <span id="page_50">p.
50</span> This line is from the works of William Lleyn, 1540-1587.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[51:2](bim1025.htm#fr_77) Al. "ten."

<span id="fn_77"></span>[51:3](bim1025.htm#fr_78) The sameness of the
word is better kept in the original, "torri" meaning both *to cut* and
*to break*.
