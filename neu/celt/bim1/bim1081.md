### THEOLOGICAL TRIADS.

The Triads of Bardism, that is, the Triads of godly sciences, and of
wisdom through Awen from God, which was given through the Holy Spirit to
the primitive Bards of the Isle of Britain from the age of ages,
according to the system and instruction of the three primary Bards and
teachers of the Isle of Britain and the nation of the Cymry. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) And this instruction is adjudged as
authorized by the memorials and voice of the Gorsedd of the Bards of the
Isle of Britain, in right of the nation of the Cymry, and according to
the privilege and usage of the Bards of the Isle of Britain.

1\. There are three immeasurable unities: place; time; and life; <span
id="fr_211"></span>[3](#fn_210.md) that is, neither one nor other of them
has either a beginning or an end.

2\. There are three primary unities, and more than one of each cannot
exist: one God; one truth; and one point of liberty, and that is, where
all things, and all opposites, equiponderate.

3\. Three things spring from the three primary unities: all life; all
goodness; and all power.

4\. The three attributes of God, being of primary co-existence: the
greatest of all things in respect of life; and the greatest of all
things in respect of might and power. Others say thus:

5\. God is of three necessities, that is: the greatest in respect of
life; the greatest in respect of knowledge; and the greatest in respect
of might and power; and there can only be one greatest of any thing.

6\. Three things which God cannot but be: what perfect goodness ought to
be; what perfect goodness would desire-to be; and what perfect goodness
can be.

7\. The three primaries of all things: materiality; motion; and
vitality.

8\. The three characteristics of existence: time; place; and action.

9\. The three stabilities of existence: nature; individuality; and
continuance.

10\. The three discriminations of existence: size; form; and operation.
