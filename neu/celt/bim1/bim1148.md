### THE STARS.

There are three kinds of stars: fixed stars, which keep their places,
and are also called stationary stars; erratic stars, which are called
planets, and are fifteen in number, seven <span
id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) being always visible, and eight
invisible, except very seldom, because they revolve within and beyond
the Galaxy; and the third are irregular stars, which are called comets,
and nothing is known of their place, number, and time, nor are they
themselves known, except on occasions of chance, and in the course of
ages.

From Bardism--Fragments about the months and other things.
