### PEITHYN <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164) COELBREN.--PALM COELBREN.

The Peithyn Coelbren consists of staves placed regularly together in a
frame.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

The palm Coelbren consists of small squares of wood of the shape and
size of dice, each containing a letter, and a small hole, through which
a string is passed. There are as many strings as there are letters; that
is, <span id="img_15900"></span> ![](img/15900.jpg) is lettered on one
string, <span id="img_15901"></span> ![](img/15901.jpg) on another
string, and in the same way with every string, each string having its
own letter. And where knowledge is mutually communicated in secret, one
man takes from his string what is necessary, and the other answers him
back in the same manner; and thus from palm to palm as long as is
required. This is called the palm Coelbren, and the palm speech, and the
palm alphabet; and frequently has vocal song been lettered in this way,
that is, the first verse on its own string, the second accordingly, and
all the following verses to the end of the song. And between word and
word, in order that each word might be distinctly evident, a round piece
of wood is inserted. This is called the dumb Coelbren, and the dumb
alphabet; and it is called the imparting of secrets, for it can be done
in sight of all the world, without any body knowing it, except the privy
friends alone.
