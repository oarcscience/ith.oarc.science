### THE MEMORIAL OF COMPUTATION.--THE MEMORIAL OF COUNTRY.

This is the mode in which the ancient Teachers used to denote the
memorial of times; that is, from the arrival of the Cymry in this
island, it was the conjecture and memory of country and nation, because
there was no privilege attached to the science of memorial and
computation before the time of Prydain, the son of Aedd, who was called
Dyvnvarth Prydain, Dyvnvarth being his original name. His epoch was
about seven hundred years after the arrival of the Cymry in this island;
and from his time to the advent of Christ in the flesh there were five
hundred and fifty-three years, as told in the memorials of computation
and tradition, warranted by the sanction of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain, under the penalty of losing privilege and office, and the
freedom of plough, and gifts, and of all chattels due in respect of song
and poetry. Before the coining of the Cymry into this island, there was
hardly anything else remembered and preserved by country and nation.
This knowledge is called the memorial of computation, and others call it
memorial and computation; thus it is said, that it was in the year of
memorial and computation, five hundred and fifty-three, Christ came in
the flesh; and this has been kept in practice down to the time. <span
