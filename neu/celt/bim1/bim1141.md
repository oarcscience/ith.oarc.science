### THE SEVEN PRIMARY MATERIALS OF THE WORLD.

1\. The first, earth, from which are every corporeity and hardness, and
every firm foundation;

2\. The second, water, from which are all humour and freshness;

3\. The third, air, from which are all respiration and motion;

4\. The fourth, sun, from which are all heat and light;

5\. The fifth, nwyvre, from which are all feeling, affection, and
wantonness;

6\. The sixth, the Holy Ghost, from Whom are all understanding, reason,
awen, and sciences;

7\. The seventh, God, from Whom are all life, strength, and support, for
ever and ever.

And from these seven primary materials are every existence and
animation; and may the whole be under God's regulation. Amen.

The Blue Bard of the Chair has said it.
