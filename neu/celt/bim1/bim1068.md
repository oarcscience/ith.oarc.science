### SECRET COELBREN.--SECRET COELVAIN.--COELVAIN OF HISTORY.

The mysteries of the Bards, that is to say, the secret Coelbrens, are
small ebillion, a finger long, having notches <span
id="fr_164"></span>[\*](#fn_163.md), so that they may be used by two
persons or more, who are confidants. It is by placing and joining them
together, with reference to what is secret, that words and phrases are
formed; and by bundling them into words, according to secrecy, missive
epistles and secret books are constructed, the meaning of which no one
knows but confidants; nor is it right, according to usage and troth, to
divulge the same. They are called the Charms of the Bards, or Bardic
Mystery.

Secret Coelvains are similar, made of small stones bearing the marks of
mystery; and it is by disposing them, according to the arrangement and
art of the Secret, that necessary sciences are demonstrated. And where
such Coelbrens exhibit the number of the letters of the Historical
Coelbren, let them be made secret by changing one letter for another, so
that it be not ascertained except from the necessity and declination of
the same letter twice in the same meaning and power.

The Coelvain of History will be, in respect of the historical letters,
according to their authorized and fixed order; that is, instead of
pillwydd there will be a Peithynen of slate, having on it the reading,
inscribed with a steel spike, or a sharp flint.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[155:\*](bim1068.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="page_154">p. 154</span> The virtue or charm attributed to letters,
as here explained, accounts very clearly for the etymology of rhint, (a
rhin,) a notch.
