*The Barddas of Iolo Morganwg, Vol. I.*, ed. by J. Williams Ab Ithel,
\[1862\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THE THREE WREATHED BARDS.

The three wreathed Bards of the Isle of Britain: Tydai, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) the Bard of Huon, <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_146.md) who was the first that arranged the mode
of dwelling according to clans for the nation of the Cymry; and
Rhuvawn <span id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_147.md) the Bard, who conferred
system and privilege upon the co-aration of a township; and
Melgin; <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_148.md) son of Einigan the Giant,
who was the first that made a symbol for language and speech. And a
wreath was given to each around his head, that is, of the air-growing
misletoe. (From various Triads, collected out of different manuscripts
in Glamorgan.)
