### ORIGIN OF LETTERS.

Einigain, Einigair, or Einiger, the Giant, was the first that made a
letter to be a sign of the first vocalization that was ever heard,
namely, the Name of God. That is to say, God pronounced His Name, and
with the word all the world and its appurtenances, and all the universe
leaped together into existence and life, with the triumph of a song of
joy. <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_62.md) The same song was the first
poem <span id="fr_64"></span>[3](#fn_63.md) that was ever heard, and the
sound of the song travelled as far as God and His existence are, and the
way in which every other existence, springing in unity with Him, has
travelled for ever and ever. And it sprang from inopportune nothing;
that is to say, so sweetly and melodiously did God declare His Name,
that life vibrated through all existence, and through every existing
materiality. And the blessed in heaven shall hear it for ever and ever,
and where it is heard, there cannot be other than the might of being and
life for ever and ever. It was from the hearing, and from him who heard
it, that sciences and knowledge and under-

standing and awen from God, were obtained. The symbol of God's Name from
the beginning was <span id="img_04100"></span> ![](img/04100.jpg),
afterwards <span id="img_04101"></span> ![](img/04101.jpg), and now OIW;
and from the quality of this symbol proceed every form and sign of
voice, and sound, and name, and condition.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_62"></span>[39:2](bim1021.htm#fr_63.md) There was some such
tradition about the Creation in Job's time, as we infer from Chap.
xxxviii. 7 of his Book. "When the morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy?"

There is an allusion to the creative melody in the poetic compositions
of the Bards. Thus in a version of the "Englynion y Coronog Faban"
attributed to Aneurin, about A.D. 550.--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Coronog Faban y dydd cynta  
A *gant ganon* yn y gwenydfa  
Ag awen gogoniant o’r uchelfa  
Gan *floedd bydoedd* a byw Adda.

The crowned Babe, on the first day,  
*Sang a chant* in the region of bliss,  
And the awen of glory came from the high place,  
With the *shout of the worlds*, and Adam lived.

</div>

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And William Cynwal
(1560-1600)--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yr awen o’r dechreuad  
Gwedi’r *Ton* oedd gyda’r Tad.

The awen from the beginning,  
After the *tone*, was with the Father.

</div>

<span id="fn_63"></span>[39:3](bim1021.htm#fr_64.md) Cymrice *cerdd*,
which, though now universally meaning a poem, or a song, seems to have
originally denoted *a going* or *a walk*. We have thus the reason why it
received its secondary meaning, i.e. because the melody of the divine
vocalization *a gerddodd*, walked through, or pervaded all creation.
