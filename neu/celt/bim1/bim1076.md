### THE THREE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS OF KNOWLEDGE.

The three principal materials of knowledge of the Bards of the Isle of
Britain: wood, that is Coelbren; and Coelvain; which two existed before
the faith in Christ was obtained; and when that was obtained, knowledge
and understanding was had of the third, namely Plagawd, that is, the
dressed skin of a beast, which is called parchment. (Grawen. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_169) There are two grawens: one of wood, the
other of a beast.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_169"></span>[163:1](bim1076.htm#fr_170) It is not very
clear whether this word is the same or not with *crawen*, a crust,
having here the meaning of rind or skin.
