### Footnotes

<span id="fn_392"></span>[411:1](bim1155.htm#fr_394) <span
id="page_410">p. 410</span> Gwyn-mer; in reference to either frost or
snow.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[411:2](bim1155.htm#fr_395) Gwyn-hy-mer.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[411:3](bim1155.htm#fr_396) Gwyn-wy-bar; ice.
Gwenhwyvar is also used as a proper name, three of Arthur's wives being
so called.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[411:4](bim1155.htm#fr_397) Gwyn-myr; *myr*
being the aggregate plural of *mor*, a sea.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[411:5](bim1155.htm#fr_398) Gwyn-hy-bar, or
gwyn-y-bar. From *bar* comes *barug*, the term in popular use for
hoar-frost,

<span id="fn_397"></span>[411:6](bim1155.htm#fr_400) Probably in
reference to the penitential season of Lent.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[411:7](bim1155.htm#fr_401) Cyn-nodd-awr.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[411:8](bim1155.htm#fr_402) Daronwy is one of
the epithets of the Deity. It was also the name of a person who is
considered as one of the three molestations of the isle of Anglesey.
(Tr. 81; first Series.) There is a historical poem by Taliesin,
preserved in the <span id="page_411">p. 411</span> 1st vol. of the Myv.
Arch, entitled "Cerdd Daronwy," or Daronwy's Song. Probably this name is
given to the month of March, not from any idea that thunder happens in
it oftener than in other months, but because it is a powerful month--the
lord of months, as regards the severity of the weather, even as it is
called Mawrth, March = Mars, the god of war.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[413:1](bim1155.htm#fr_403) <span
id="page_412">p. 412</span> "Cynhewin," from *cyn*, and *haw*, ripe. It
may, however, be but another form of *Cyntefin*.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[413:2](bim1155.htm#fr_404) "Canowin," from
*cenaw*, an offspring; a graft. It may refer to the sprouts of trees, as
well as to the young of animals. We say *cenawon cyll*, the catkins of
hazel, and *cenawon llewod*, lion whelps.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[413:3](bim1155.htm#fr_405) Cenaw-tardd.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[413:4](bim1155.htm#fr_406) Probably because
the pear trees now begin to blossom.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[413:5](bim1155.htm#fr_407) Also " May;" and is
the name still in use.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[413:6](bim1155.htm#fr_408) "Cogerddan,"
(cog-cerdd.) It may signify also the departure of the cuckoo.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[413:7](bim1155.htm#fr_409) "Gwerthefin " is
likewise an epithet for the Deity, and signifies what is supreme, from
*gwarthaf*, the upper part, or summit. We have above derived it from
gwarth and *hefin*.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[413:8](bim1155.htm#fr_410) Gorhïan, i.e.
gor-huan.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[415:1](bim1155.htm#fr_411) <span
id="page_414">p. 414</span> This clearly indicates that vineyards were
formerly cultivated in Britain.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[415:2](bim1155.htm#fr_412) "Gwynollydd," or
"gwynyllydd," probably from *gwyntyll*. Many of the above names are,
however, now so obsolete, and their roots so obscure, that we do not
vouch for accuracy of translation in every case.
