### TRIADS OF BARDISM.

THE ELEMENTS.

1\. The three materials of every being and existence: calas, and hence
every motionless body and solidity, and

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span> <span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

every hardness and concretion; fluidity, and hence every cessation,
migration, and return; and nwyvre, <span id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_338)
hence every animation and life, and every strength, understanding, and
knowledge, and the same is God, without Whom there can be no life and
vitality.

Others say:--

There are three materials of every thing, namely: calas, and hence every
corporeity; fluidity, and hence every colour and form, and every course
and return; and nwyvre, and hence every life, being God, from Whom
proceed every soul, animation, strength, and understanding, for where He
is not, neither one nor another of these things can exist.

Others say:--

There are three primary elements: calas, hence every hardness and
solidity, and it is dead; fluidity, and hence every progress and
mutation, and every alteration, colour, and form, and every
discrimination, and every concurrence, and it is dead; and nwyvre, which
is God, from Whom proceed every life, strength, and intellect, and every
perception and sense.

Thus, according to other wise men and teachers, as may be seen in the
old account:--

There are five elements: earth; water; air; fire; and nyv; <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_339) and the nyv is God, from Whom are all
life and orderly motion.

Others say:--

Calas, or earth, water, breath, uvel, <span
id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_340) and nwyvre, and every one of them is
dead, except the nwyvre, which is God, from Whom comes all life.

According to another mode, as other teachers say from an old account:

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span> <span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

Earth, water, firmament, fire, and nyv; and the nyv is God, and life,
and intellect. From the first four are all death and mortality; and from
the fifth are all life and animation, all power, knowledge, and motion.

2\. The three constituents of life: motion; knowledge; and awen.

3\. The three constituents of knowledge: original awen; facile reason;
and inevitable necessity.

4\. The three constituents of art: instruction from a master, who knows
it; innate understanding that will comprehend it; and the exercise of
congenial awen.

5\. Three principles: innate understanding; vigorous <span
id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_341) affection; and the rises of natural
temperament.

6\. The three concurrences of life: body; soul; and privilege.

7\. The three constituents of awen: knowledge, or understanding;
vigorous affection; and devotion.

8\. The three concurrences of art: correct system; firm justice; and
discreet skill in practising it.

9\. The three elevations of art: information from him who knows it;
genial understanding to comprehend it; and needful occasion to practise
it.

10\. Three privileges which ought to be conferred upon him who teaches
and demonstrates any good art that was not previously known: the
privilege of innate nobility as a Cymro; the privilege of honorary art;
and the protection of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, namely, that he
should not, except of his free will, bear weapons of offence, or en-gage
in war and battle.

11\. The three principal adornments of every thing: time; place; and
quality. Others say: The three principal elements.

.12. The three principal elements of knowledge: Awen from God; the
exercise of the understanding; and the demonstration of a master.

13\. The three principal elements of Awen from God: innate justice;
habitual kindness; and natural understanding.

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span> <span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

14\. Three things that will confirm and honour Awen from God: energetic
industry; correct meditation; and courteous affection.

15\. Three things <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_342).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_338"></span>[373:1](bim1128.htm#fr_340) <span
id="page_372">p. 372</span> Dr. Pughe gives the following meanings to
this word,--"the ethereal sphere; the firmament, the atmosphere," and in
support thereof quotes from Taliesin and Llywarch Hen:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Addwyn haul yn ewybr yn *nwyfre*.

Glorious is the sun moving in the *firmament*.--Tal.

Gorddyar adar, gwlyb traeth,  
Eglur *nwyfre*, ehelaeth ton;  
Gwyw calon rhag hiraeth.

Clamorous are the birds, the strand is wet,  
Clear is the welkin, ample the wave;  
The heart is palsied with longing,--Ll. Hen.

</div>

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

It is compounded of *nwyf* and *rhe*, *nwyf* signifying "a subtil
pervading element; a fine ethereal fluid;" and *rhe*, "a swift motion."

<span id="fn_339"></span>[373:2](bim1128.htm#fr_341) "Nyf " seems to be
but another form of *nwyf*, and *nwf*, and has the same signification.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[373:3](bim1128.htm#fr_342) "Ufel," according
to Dr. Pughe, is "elementary fire; a spark of fire."

<span id="fn_341"></span>[375:1](bim1128.htm#fr_343) <span
id="page_374">p. 374</span> Al. "natural."

<span id="fn_342"></span>[377:1](bim1128.htm#fr_344) <span
id="page_376">p. 376</span> The rest are wanting.
