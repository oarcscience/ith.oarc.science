### THE BARDS' ENIGMA. <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_218.md)

There is nothing truly hidden <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_219.md) but
what is not conceivable; <span id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_220.md)  
There is nothing not conceivable but what is immeasurable;  
There is nothing immeasurable but God;  
There is no God but that which is not conceivable;  
There is nothing not conceivable but that which is truly hidden;  
There is nothing truly hidden but God.

In some Books the Bards' enigma is as follows:--

There is no God but what cannot be comprehended;  
There is nothing that cannot be comprehended but what is not
conceivable;  
There is nothing not conceivable but what is immeasurable;  
There is nothing immeasurable but God;  
There is no God but what is not conceivable.

Here is the ancient Bards' enigma:--

There is no God but what is not conceivable;  
There is nothing not conceivable but God;  
There is no God but what is immeasurable;  
There is nothing immeasurable but God.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span> <span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

Here is another form of it.

There is nothing immeasurable but what is not conceivable;  
There is nothing immeasurable but God;  
There is nothing immeasurable but the greatest of all;  
There can be no two of the greatest of all in any thing.

Here is a solution of the enigma.

What is not conceivable is the greatest of all, and the immeasurable of
what is not in place;  
God is the greatest of all, and the immeasurable of intelligence;  
And there can be no existence to any thing but from intelligence;  
And the non-existence of all things comes from what is not in place.

As the Bard says:

What is not conceivable is the greatest, and the immeasurable of all
that is not in place; <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221.md)  
God is the greatest, and the immeasurable of all that are together in
place. <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_222.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_218"></span>[215:1](bim1091.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> These aphorisms are sometimes ascribed to
Cattwg the Wise, in the sixth century.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[215:2](bim1091.htm#fr_220.md) "Dirgel" is
compounded of "dir," true, and "cel," concealment.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[215:3](bim1091.htm#fr_221.md) It is very
difficult to render the exact meaning of "dim" in this place, which is
evidently not *nothing* in the popular use of the term. The translation,
which we have adopted, was suggested by the late Archdeacon Williams in
his *Gomer*, p. 136, and is in fact the "nihil cogitabile," as
distinguished from the "nihil purum," in Sir William Hamilton's analysis
of negative thought.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[217:1](bim1091.htm#fr_222.md) <span
id="page_216">p. 216</span> "Difant," from "di," non, and "man," a
place.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[217:2](bim1091.htm#fr_223.md) "Cymmant," from
"cyd," with, or together, and "man," a place. Al. "that is restored in
place"--"that is in place all around "--"intellectual
place"--"elementation."
