### ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF LETTERS.--EINIGAN THE GIANT.--THE GWYDDONIAID.--SYSTEMS OF LETTERS.

a\. e. i. o.--b. c. t. l. s. r. p.

It was Einigan the Giant that first understood letters; and he made the
principal cuttings, which were eleven, that is, the four vowels, and the
seven consonants. And he inscribed on wood the memorial of every object
he beheld, every story he heard, and every honour he understood. Others
considering the things that Einigan did, concluded that he was a devil,
and banished him. Upon this he came to his father's kindred in the Isle
of Britain, and exhibited his art, and they adjudged him to be the
wisest of the wise, and called him Einigan the Gwyddon, and all, who
learned the art of letters, they called Gwyddoniaid, which Gwyddoniaid
were the principal sages of the Isle of Britain, before Bards were
systematically distinguished in respect of privilege and usage. When
Bards and Bardism were arranged, they were required to keep the memorial
of the eleven cuttings. After this the art was improved, and sixteen
cuttings were obtained, which were called the sixteen letters;
subsequently, eighteen, and thence until twenty-four, to which were
added the fourteen secondary letters, as they are now seen. This is
preserved in the memorial of voice and letters, and the usage of the
Bards of the Isle of Britain. The system of eleven is called the system
of Einigan; the one of sixteen, the system of Edric; the one of
eighteen, the system of Alawn <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) "and
the system of the Bards;" <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_79.md) the one of
twenty-four is called the system of Arthavael; and

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span> <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

the one now in use is called the new system, and the system of Idnerth
the Artist. It was in the time when Gruffudd, son of Llywelyn, son of
Seisyllt, exercised prerogative over Cymru universal, that this Idner
lived. <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) Thus are shown the origin of
letters and the sciences of books in the memorials of the Bards of the
Isle of Britain.
