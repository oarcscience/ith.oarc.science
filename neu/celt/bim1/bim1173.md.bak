### DAYS OF DAYS.

Days of days are the days that are over and above the lunar year, and
are thus distributed according to their number; two days of days are
given to Alban Arthan, three to Eilir, three to Hevin, and three to
Elved. They are free days, and let any one come from where he may, he
will be free, without a weapon against him, since there can be no court
and law of country on those days.
