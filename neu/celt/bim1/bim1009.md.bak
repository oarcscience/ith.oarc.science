### POMPONIUS MELA, A.D. 45.

His description is as follows:--

<span class="small">"They \[the Gauls\] have an eloquence of their own,
and their Druids as masters of wisdom. These profess to know the
magnitude and form of the earth and the world, the motions of the heaven
and the stars, and the will of the gods. They teach the most noble of
the nation many things privately, and for a long time, even for twenty
years, in a cave, or in inaccessible woods. One of their precepts has
become public, namely, that they should act bravely in war, that souls
are immortal, and that there is another life after death. Therefore
along with the dead, they burn and bury things which belonged to them
while living. Their debtor and creditor accounts were transferred</span>

<span id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span>

<span class="small">below. Some even went so far as to ascend the
funeral pyres of their friends of their own accord, as though about to
live with them." <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)</span>

Mela agrees with Cæsar as to the knowledge which the Druids were said to
possess concerning the universe, and as to their being in the habit of
training their disciples for the long space of twenty years. live may
conclude from the only specimen of their precepts, which he succeeded in
obtaining, that they were inculcated in the Triadic form:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To act bravely in war;  
That souls are immortal;  
And that there is another life after death."</span>

</div>

1\. *Interment*. The remains discovered in ancient sepulchres
sufficiently prove that the Cymry in former times buried with their
princes and great men those things to which in their life-time they had
been particularly attached, such as their steeds and arms.

2\. *The debt of the deceased*. Undoubtedly this is a remnant of the
ancient doctrine of the metempsychosis, according to which the man,
after his fall in Abred through death, was regarded as suffering
punishment, or paying the debt which he had contracted in his life-time.

3\. *Voluntary death*. It is, likewise, very probable that there is some
connection between the custom, which some of the people in Gaul adopted,
of throwing themselves on the funeral pyres of their relatives, and the
doctrine of *eneidvaddeu*, already spoken of.
