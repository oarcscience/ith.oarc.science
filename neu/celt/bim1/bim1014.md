### Druids and Bards

We have entered upon this subject at some length, because the supposed
antagonism between Classical Druidism and British Bardism, is one of the
principal grounds on which our literary sceptics found their denial of
the genuineness of our traditions, and hence it becomes our strict duty
to examine how far their position in this respect is really tenable. It
is to be hoped that our comparative analysis will convince every
unprejudiced person that, whilst the apparent discrepancy, which existed
between the two systems,

<span id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span>

precludes the idea of one being considered as a mere copy of the other,
taken in recent times, there is sufficient identity of principle
observable in them both, subject to the qualifying character of the
Gaulish tradition, to suggest a common origin. On this account, then,
the tenets and usages of Bardism, as given in our pages, may well be
considered as the genuine remains of Druidic lore; that is, if we have
further reason for believing that they were effectually preserved and
handed down through the different ages, which followed the introduction
and establishment of Christianity.

The machinery principally adopted by the Bards for this purpose was,
"the voice of Gorsedd," which is amply explained and described in these
volumes. Under favourable circumstances, indeed, it might be considered
as highly efficient; but such circumstances, we all know, did not at all
times exist. Under the Roman domination, we may be assured, that the
ancient institute of the country, opposed as it was, both in spirit and
practice, to all foreign usurpation, would not be allowed to give public
expression to its views. The Bards could not meet in Gorsedd without
incurring great personal danger. Consequently, they would have recourse
to "cyvail," which was the second "assembly of the Bards," and created
especially to meet the requirements of the case; that is, a *cyvail* was
a group of three persons, who met "where and when they could, for fear
of the assault of depredation and lawlessness." By this means the old
traditions might be preserved, though they would not be known out of the
circle of the fraternity. That there were Bards and Bardism during this
period,

<span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span>

is undoubted. All the Bardic privileges and immunities were recognized
by law until the reign of Lucius, A.D. 173-189. Gorwg, son of Eirchion,
two generations later, is described not only as "a very wise and
religious king," but also as " a good Bard." <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) And it is supposed that Bardism formed the
principal ingredient in the Pelagian heresy, which spread so rapidly and
extensively among the people, towards the end of the fourth century.

About A.D. 383, when the Roman power was fast declining in the island,
Macsen Wledig, (Maximus,) with the view of resuscitating the ancient
system, submitted it to the verdict of country and nation, as in the
time of Prydain, "lest the primitive Bardism should be lost and
forgotten; when it was found in its integrity, and in accordance with
the primary privileges and usages. And thus it was submitted to the
judgment and verdict of country and nation, and the ancient privileges
and usages, the ancient meaning and learning, and the ancient sciences
and memorials were confirmed, lest they should fail, become lost and
forgotten; and this was done without contradiction or opposition." <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md)

In the reign of Gwrtheyrn Gwrthenau, however, about a century later,
Bardism was greatly corrupted, owing to "the divulging of the Name of
God, introducing falsehood into vocal song, and distorting the sciences
of Bardism." To remedy this state of things, king Arthur, in the sixth
century, established the system of the Round Table, which was "an
arrangement of the arts, sciences, usages, and privileges of the

<span id="page_lxxii">p. lxxii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bards and men of
vocal song; and improved, and committed to memory, where there was
occasion, every thing commendable in what was old, and authorized every
thing new that was adjudged to be an augmentation and an amplification
of desirable sciences, with a view to the wisdom and requirement of
country and nation." The two Merddins, Taliesin, St. Mabon, and others,
presided at this Chair.

Upon the death of Arthur, the Chair of the Round Table was removed to
the court of Urien Rheged, at Aberllychwr, where it went sometimes by
the name of Taliesin's Chair, and sometimes by that of the Chair of
Baptism. "Under the privilege of the institute of the Round Table,
Gildas the prophet, and Cattwg the Wise from Llancarvan, were Bards, and
also Llywarch the Aged, son of Elidyr Lydanwyn, Ystudvach the Bard, and
Ystyffan the Bard of Teilo." <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

It remained at Aberllychwr about two hundred years; after that, it was
transferred to Caerwynt, <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) where it
continued for more than a hundred years. It was then removed to Maes
Mawr, by Einion, the son of Collwyn; and afterwards by Iestyn, the son
of Gwrgant, to the court of Caerleon-upon-Usk, which was held at Cardiff
Castle. Here it was shortly disturbed, owing to the war that broke out
between Iestyn and Rhys, the son of Tewdwr; nor was it again restored
until the time of Robert, earl of Gloucester, grandson of the latter,
"who endowed this Chair with privilege and maintenance in Maes Mawr in
Morganwg, and gave the name of *Tir Iarll*, or the

<span id="page_lxxiii">p. lxxiii</span>

earl's land, to the portion which he conferred upon the Bards for their
maintenance, whilst he gave the other portion for the maintenance of the
Monks.......The Chair of Tir Iarll was enjoined to investigate the
ancient sciences of Bardism; and after the search, recovery, and
confirmation, the primitive Chair, Gorsedd, sciences, privileges, and
usages of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, were restored thoroughly and
altogether." <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)

Geraint, the Blue Bard, had, in the beginning of the tenth century,
established a Chair at Llandaff, different to the one of the Round
Table. It afterwards went by the name of the Chair of Morganwg, and
enbosomed that of Tir Iarll, itself being enbosomed by (*ynghesail*) the
Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of Britain.

This Chair, whether we call it the Chair of Tir Iarll, or the Chair of
Morganwg, was well protected as long as the lords of Glamorgan retained
sovereign authority over that territory; and the rights and immunities
of the Bards were renewed from time to time, but always on condition
that they should investigate and preserve the sciences of Bardism.

Llywelyn, the son of Gruffydd, was slain Dec. 11, 1282, and with him
fell the ancient independence of Cymru, which henceforth became subject
to the kings of England. In consequence of the opposition, which the
Bards offered to the claims of Edward, they were rigorously persecuted
by that monarch, and of course were prevented from meeting publicly in
Gorsedd. Neither did they any longer enjoy the *trwydded* or

<span id="page_lxxiv">p. lxxiv</span>

maintenance, which had been conferred upon them by their own native
princes. Nevertheless, they kept up the old system, and from A.D. 1300,
at least, down to Iolo Morganwg's time, they managed to hold a Gorsedd
occasionally for Morganwg, as the following "Bardic Succession," or list
of the Bards of the Chair of Glamorgan, and the order in which they were

John Bradford, <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) will shew. The dates

However, as their meetings were not always regular, and as the number of
members was continually dwindling, there was danger that the traditions
of the institution would suffer loss in consequence. Hence such of the
Bards as were anxious for their preservation, began, more than before,
to make collections of them in Books. We say more than before, because
some few, like Geraint the Blue Bard, had previously

<span id="page_lxxvii">p. lxxvii</span>

committed to writing many things concerning the Bards and their system.
With a view to consolidate those collections, several Gorsedds were held
from the beginning of the fifteenth century, under the sanction of Sir
Richard Neville and others. One was held for that purpose in 1570, under
the auspices of William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, the great patron of
Welsh literature, and the founder of the celebrated Library of Welsh
MSS. at Rhaglan Castle, which was afterwards destroyed by Oliver
Cromwell. What was done at those meetings received considerable
improvement at one held by Sir Edward Lewis of the Van, about 1580, from
the arrangement of the venerable Llywelyn Sion of Llangewydd; and
lastly, a complete revisal of the former collections was made by Edward
Davydd of Margam, which received the sanction of a Gorsedd, held at
Bewpyr, in the year 1681, under the authority of Sir Richard Basset;
when that collection was pronounced to be in every respect the fullest
illustration of Bardism. <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)

Part of the said collection, namely, "Cyfrinach Beirdd Ynys Prydain,"
which is a most excellent treatise on the Ancient Versification of the
Cymry, was published in the original by Iolo Morganwg, A.D. 1829. What
is now offered to the public, it is but reasonable to infer, constitutes
the remainder, or, at any rate, a great portion of the remainder, for
many of the documents profess to have been taken out of the Books of
Trahaiarn Brydydd Mawr, Hywel Swrdwal, Ieuan ab Hywel Swrdwal, Llawdden,
Gwilym Tew, Rhys Brydydd, Rhys Brychan, Lewys Morganwg,

<span id="page_lxxviii">p. lxxviii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Davydd Benwyn,
Davydd Liwyd Mathew, Sion Philip, Antoni Pywel, and principally Llywelyn
Sion, Bards who flourished from the 14th to the 17th century. Llywelyn
Sion tells us that he made his collection out of the Books of Taliesin,
Ionas Mynyw, Edeyrn Davod Aur, Cwtta Cyvarwydd, Einion Offeiriad, Davydd
Ddu Hiraddug, Sion Cent, Rhys Goch, and others in the Library of
Rhaglan, by permission of the lord William Herbert.

There is no doubt that these Bards viewed the traditions of the Gorsedd
as the genuine remains of Ancient Druidism; and there is every reason to
believe that in their main features they were so. The variations
observable in minor points would indicate in what direction, and to what
extent, they suffered in their passage from the Christian era downwards.

But a question offers itself,--Did the Christian Bards receive and
believe these traditions as articles of faith; or did they preserve them
merely as curious relics, or specimens of the primitive theology and
wisdom of the Cymry? We think that to act on the former theory was
impossible, in the face of two facts. First, they were members of the
Chair of Baptism, in which "no one had the privilege of a teacher, who
was not baptized and devoted to the faith in Christ." For, be it
observed, it was this Chair alone that enjoined its members to preserve
the ancient traditions; and it was for that reason that we omitted all
mention of other Chairs, such as those of Powys and Gwynedd. Secondly,
several individuals of distinguished orthodoxy, piety, and position in
the Church, were admitted members of Bardism from time to time. It is
said that Arthur, when he was

<span id="page_lxxix">p. lxxix</span>

about to institute the Chair of the Round Table, summoned to his aid
three prelates, two of whom are mentioned by name, that is, Dyvrig,
archbishop of Llandaff, afterwards of Caerleon-upon-Usk, and Cyndeyrn,
bishop of Llanelwy, "lest he and his knights should do any thing
contrary to the Holy Scripture and the faith in Christ........And Arthur
enjoined St. Teilo to baptize the three Bards," Taliesin, Merddin Emrys,
and Merddin Wyllt, who arranged its discipline and usages on the
occasion. St. Teilo, Cattwg the Wise, and St. Pryderi, were members of
the Bardic College, being "the three blessed Bards of Arthur's court."
St. David, the patron saint of Wales, Padarn, the bishop of Llanbadarn,
Deiniol Wyn, the first bishop of Bangor, and Gildas, were also Bards. So
also were Geraint, the Blue Bard, supposed by some to be the same person
as Asser Menevensis, about 900, Einion the Aged, domestic chaplain to
Sir Rhys the Aged, of Abermarlais, 1300-1350, Sion Cent, priest,
1380-1420, Meurig Davydd, 1560, Thomas Roberts, priest, 1680, S. Jones,
Bryn Llywarch, priest, 1680, and Bishop Burgess, who was graduated Druid
by Iolo Morganwg.

We cannot conceive that these men, some of whom were ornaments to the
Christian religion, should yet believe in tenets that were inconsistent
with that religion. We may mention St. David in particular, as one who
took a very active part in suppressing the Pelagian heresy, which in
many respects exhibited the lineaments of Druidism. Padarn subscribed
the decrees of the Council of Paris, which was held in the year 557, and
is commended both as

<span id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span>

an abbot and a bishop in the writings of Venantius Fortunatus, a Latin
poet of Gaul, who was his contemporary; sure proofs that he also was
sound in the faith. These considerations force us to conclude that the
Bards in Christian times preserved and handed down the traditions of
their institutes, merely as curious speculations, illustrative of the
religion and philosophy of the primitive inhabitants of the island.

It may be remarked in addition that some of the Bardic Chairs were
occasionally held in churches and religious houses. The Chair of Tir
Iarll was at one time held alternately in the Church of Bettws and the
Church of Llangynwyd. The Chair of Morganwg was held at Easter in one of
the chapter houses of Llandaff, Margam, Glyn Nedd, or in the Church of
Llanilltyd; at Whitsuntide, among other places, in the Church of
Pentyrch; on St. John the Baptist's day in the Church of Llancarvan, and
in the Monastery of Penrhys. Surely, the ecclesiastical authorities
would never have allowed the inculcation of heresy to desecrate places
that were pre-eminently dedicated to the service of the Christian
religion. Bardism, then, was not regarded as constituting the faith of
all who professed to know it.

We doubt riot, however, that individuals would be found now and then to
cherish the traditions of the Bards as saving truths, just as in our own
days there are persons, who entertain strange and erroneous doctrines,
and yet have no mind to abandon their Christian profession. Llyr Myrini
endeavoured to reconcile Bardism with Christianity, and to mould them
into one system, but his efforts resulted in Pelagianism; and there are
traces in our volumes of other developments

<span id="page_lxxxi">p. lxxxi</span>

of a similar nature in respect of the Incarnation, which, however, took
a Sabellian direction. It is not meant that the principles of Bardism
were incompatible with the Christian religion; but that heresies, having
arisen from the attempt to harmonize them, prove the attempt to have
been made by individuals without the aid or sanction of the great body
of Bards, who were, we may presume, good and honest Christians. In our
opinion, the following Triad seems to express the judgment of Gorsedd on
the comparative merits of the Bardic and Gospel dispensations:--

<span class="small">"There are three special doctrines that have been
obtained by the nation of the Cymry: the first, from the age of ages,
was that of the Gwyddoniaid, prior to the time of Prydain, son of Aedd
the Great; the second was Bardism, as taught by the Bards, after they
had been instituted; the third was the Faith in Christ, being THE BEST
OF THE THREE."</span>

The Bards believed that all things were tending to perfection; when,
therefore, they embraced Christianity, they must on their own principles
have viewed it as a stage in advance of their former creed. The more
advanced in religious knowledge would, doubt-less, recognize it in its
true character, as the fulfilment of Druidism, that is, as far as the
latter was identical with the patriarchal religion of Noah--as "the
mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is
made manifest to his saints; to whom God would make known what is the
riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles." The Gospel of
Christ is "the truth"--the realization of types and shadows; it is the
"Truth against the world," which Bardism was continually

<span id="page_lxxxii">p. lxxxii</span>

searching for. We, therefore, not only in virtue of our clerical office,
but also as a Bard according to the privilege and usage of the Bards of
the Isle of Britain, under the privilege of the Chair of Morganwg,
embosoming the Chair of Baptism, beg to enter our most energetic protest
(*gwrthneu*) against all attempts to impose upon any one as articles of
belief the tenets of Bardism, where they are inconsistent with
Christianity, as found in the Sacred Scriptures, and defined in the
creeds of "the Holy Church throughout the world."
