### THE PRIMARY LETTERS.--IMPROVEMENT OF THE ALPHABET.

Before the time of Beli the Great, <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_84)
son of Manogan, there were only ten letters, which were called the ten
signs, namely, a, p, c, e, t, i, l, r, o, s. After that m, and n, were
invented; and after that four others, and they were made into sixteen by
the divulgation, and under the proclamation of country and nation. After
the coming of the faith in Christ, two other letters, namely u and d. In
the time of king Arthur <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_85) there were
introduced twenty primary letters, as at present, by the counsel of
Taliesin, the chief of Bards, and domestic Bard of Urien Rheged. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[4](#fn_86) Under the system of the eighteen were
arranged O. I. U. which is the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span> <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

unutterable Name of God; whereas previous to that arrangement it was O.
I. O. according to the sixteen. Of the principal signs there are not, to
this day, more than twenty letters, or twenty signs. Geraint the Blue
Bard appointed twenty-four letters, as it is at present; but the four
are auxiliaries. After that, through the argumentative consideration of
Bards, and Teachers who were chair Bards, there were brought into use
and privilege, by the improvement of the Coelbren, thirty-eight letters
on wood; but there are in black and white <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87) only the twenty-four signs.
