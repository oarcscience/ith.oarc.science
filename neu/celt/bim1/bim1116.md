### THE RUDIMENTS OF THEOLOGY.

1\. Keep thy eyes upon God, worship Him, and do no dishonour to Him in
His presence.

2\. Justice and love, with peace and truth, are the materials of
immortal life.

3\. Avoid adultery and the violation of marriage.

4\. Commit no [depredation](errata.htm#2) and pillage.

5\. There is nothing just for any one, except what will suffice him in
the face of death.

6\. Impart the knowledge of God to all, and the instruction of man to
such as will receive it.

7\. Insert ........ <span id="fr_275"></span>[\*](#fn_273) and the order
of time in the memorials of theological sciences.

8\. Do thy best, to the extent of reason and power, and leave the
impossible excess to God, and His will.

9\. Give of thy wealth and property an oblation to God and his poor,
that thou mayest not be accursed, and that thou mayest not pine away;
for God will have his own.

10\. There is nothing which has not been made by God; there is nothing
which does not belong to God, and not to another. Leave to God what He
wills.

And thus end the Ten Commandments of St Paul, which he received from the
mouth of Jesus Christ, the Son of grace.
