### PEITHYNVAIN.

Another mode for booking sciences were the Peithynvain, <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) that is, they wrote with a steel pencil
on both surfaces of the stones, and then put them on a strong cord, or
on an iron or brass rod, which passed through the top of every
Peithynvaen. These stones were called Coelvain. Another method was that
of Howel the Good, devised by Blegywryd, his Clerk, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166.md) which was this;--they faced the hall of
the Prince's court with stones, one side and another of the hall, and on
the stones wrote in order, with a strong pencil, the laws which Howel
imposed upon the country and nation of the Cymry, an open entrance being
left for every man that needed, whatever man he might be, whether a
native or a stranger, to proceed into the hall, and to read the law, or
to have it read to him. Hence it became customary to inscribe

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

a vocal song, a Roll, a poem, the memorial of praiseworthy deeds, and
the narration of wisdom, on Peithynvain, and to place them on the face
of walls and partitions, or on strings, or iron rods. It was from this
also that the practice arose of giving the name of Coelvain to all
sciences, of whatsoever kind they were, and to whatsoever things that
were inscribed thereon.

King Arthur placed the system of the Round Table, and the praiseworthy
deeds of its knights, on plates of brass and tin, in his three principal
courts, namely, Caerleon-upon-Usk, Celliwig, <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) and Penrhyn Rhionydd, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_168.md) written with a steel pencil.
