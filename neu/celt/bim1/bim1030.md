### RECOVERY OF THE OLD CYMRAEG.

It was in the time of Owain, son of Maxen Wledig, that the nation of the
Cymry recovered their privilege and crown. They took to their primitive
mother tongue instead of the Latin, which had well nigh overran the Isle
of Britain; and in the Cymraeg they kept the memorials and history and
systems of country and nation, restoring to memory the ancient Cymraeg,
with its original words and expressions. Because the ancient orthography
of the ten primary letters was forgotten and misunderstood, they became
lost, and thus arose a disagreement respecting several old words, that
is, the putting of two letters, where only one was required, as *caan*,
*braan*, *glaan*, instead of *cân*, *brân*, and *glân*, and *digerth*
instead of *dierth*, and *phlegid* instead of *phlaid*, with many
others; also putting *t* for *dd*, and *i* instead of *e*, and instead
of *y*, and *u* instead of *e*. It is not necessary to show the whole,
but this much is given in memory of him who made the amendment, namely,
Talhaiarn

the Bard, <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) of Caerleon-upon-Usk,
under the protection of the Round Table. After him Taliesin, Chief of
Bards, arranged the Cymraeg, from a right understanding of the meaning
and merit of the ten primary letters, and their modes, and changes, and
proper inflections; and from this the ancient Cymraeg was restored and
recovered.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[63:1](bim1030.htm#fr_92.md) <span id="page_62">p.

established at Caer Gwyroswydd, or Ystum Llwynarth. He composed a
prayer, which has always been the formula used in the Gorsedd Morganwg,
or Bardic Sessions of Glamorgan. He was also domestic chaplain to Emrys
Wledig, or Ambrosius Aurelianus. Taliesin in his Poems alludes to
Talhaiarn,--

Trwy ieith Talhayarn  
Bedydd bu ddydd farn.

According to the language of Talhaiarn,  
There will be baptism at the day of judgment.
