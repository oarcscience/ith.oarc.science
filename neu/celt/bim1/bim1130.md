### BARDISM, &c. THE ELEMENTS.

There are three primary elements, out of which proceed every other
corporal substance, and living existence: the first is the calas, from
which are all corporeity and hardness, that is to say, calas is the air,
out of which, by compression, are derived every corporeity, colour, and
form; the second is the fire, out of which proceed every motion and
change; the third is the nwyvre, from which are God, and all life,
understanding, and knowledge. Others say: Galas; uvel, and nwyvre, which
is God. Others say: there are five special elements: earth, water,
firmament, fire, and nwyvre. From the calas proceed every hardness,

heat and light, and all hue, and all motion and sensation; from the
nwyvre are all life, and God, and soul, understanding, knowledge, and
all affection and awen. And neither number, weight, or measure, can be
applied to one or other of these three, where they are not mutually
mixed together--nor knowledge, motion, hue, or form.
