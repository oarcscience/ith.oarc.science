### TRIADS OF BARDISM AND USAGES. <span id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_317.md)

1\. The three foundations of Bardism: peace; utility; and justice.
Others say: peace; love; and justice.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span> <span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

2\. The three supports of poetry and Bardism, that is to say: privilege
in right of usage, for there ought to be nothing that is not according
to usage; usage in right of privilege, for there ought to be no usage
that is not privileged, nor any usage without privilege; and privilege
and usage according to reason, nature, and obligation, for there ought
to be nothing that is not so--the same resting on the three foundations,
namely: truth; love; and justice. Others say: truth; peace; and just
utility.

3\. Three incidental conditions happen to song and poetry: corruption;
improvement; and restoration <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_318.md) from
corruption and loss. And under each of the three contingencies, in order
to obviate non usage, they ought to be submitted to the verdict of
country, and the judgment of Gorsedd. That is to say, when they are
corrupted, they ought to be submitted so, that they may be improved; and
when they are lost, or when they become dormant, they ought to be
submitted so, that they may be resuscitated, restored, and brought to
memory, as they were formerly. Then they ought to conform to the three
supports, namely: usage in right of privilege; and privilege in right of
usage; that is to say, nothing should be done, in right of any thing,
except what is customary, nor as usage, except what is according to
reason, nature, and obligation, with a view to truth, peace, love, and
just utility.

4\. The three principal qualities of vitality: thought; power; and will;
and they cannot be complete and entire except in God.

5\. The three excellences of Bardism: to be fond of meditation; to
extend learning; and to popularize manners and customs.

6\. From three things does truth obtain credence: from believing every
thing; from disbelieving every thing; and from believing it matters not
what.

Three godly qualities in man: to consider; to love; and to suffer. (St.
Paul.)

7\. For three reasons ought a man to hazard his life, and

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span> <span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

to lose it, if there be occasion: in seeking after truth; in clinging to
justice; and in performing mercy. (St. Paul.)

8\. There are three principal kinds of animations: aqueous; aerial; and
celestial; that is to say, the aqueous were the primordials of life,
being the first that existed, namely, in the seas, before there was dry
land; the aerials then calve into being, and they live on dry land,
deriving breath from the air; and the celestials are those which
attained the circle of Gwynvyd, being the highest of all that are not
subject to death.

9\. The three conditions of animations: the being in Abred; in liberty;
and in Gwynvyd.

10\. Three things which are impossible: that God should be evil and
unmerciful; that there should be evil, which will do no good; and that
there should be good, which will not prevail in the end.

11\. The three burstings of the Lake of Llion: <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_319.md) the first, when the world and all living
beings were drowned, except Dwyvan and Dwyvach, their children, and
grand-children, from whom the world was again peopled--and it was from
that bursting that seas were formed; the second was, when the sea went
amidst the lands, without either wind or tide; the third was, when the
earth burst asunder by means of the powerful agitation, so that the
water spouted forth even to the vault of the sky, and all of the nation
of the Cymry were drowned, except seventy persons, and the Isle of
Britain was parted from Ireland, and from the land of Gaul and Armorica.

12\. The three administrations of knowledge, which the nation of the
Cymry obtained: the first was the instruction of Hu the Mighty, before
they came into the island of Britain,

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span> <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

who first taught the cultivation of the earth, <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_320.md) and the art of metallurgy; the second
was the system of Bards and Bardism, being instruction by means of the
memorials and voice of Gorsedd; and the third was the faith in Christ,
which was the best of all, and blessed be it for ever.

13\. For three reasons may living beings be deprived of life, namely:
when one kills a man intentionally and purposely; when one kills a man
accidentally, or indirectly, as when it destroys fruit and vegetables,
which are for the food and sustenance of the life of man; and when it
will be better for the one that is slain that it should be slain than
otherwise, with the view of releasing it from extreme pain, or of
bettering its condition in Abred, as in the case of a man, who gives
himself <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_321.md) an eneidvaddeu for some
punishable evil, where he cannot render any other satisfaction and
payment for what he has done, than by submitting voluntarily, at the
demand of justice, to the punishment due. <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_322.md)

14\. In three ways a man happens to become eneidvaddeu: one is
punishment due, by the verdict of country and law, for an injurious
evil--an injurious evil being killing and burning, murder and waylaying,
and the betraying of country and nation. That is to say, he who commits
those evils ought to be executed; and every execution takes place either
by the judgment of a court of law, or in war by the verdict of country
and nation. The second is the man, who surrenders himself, at the demand
of justice which he feels in his conscience, to execution, for an
injurious and punishable

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span> <span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

evil, which he confesses to have committed, and where he cannot render
compensation and  satisfaction for the injury he has done, otherwise
than by submitting voluntarily to the punishment due for what he has
done. The third is the man, who undergoes the danger and chance of
execution in behalf of truth and justice, at the call of peace and
mercy, and is slain. Such a man is adjudged to be slain for the good,
which he has done; and on that account he ascends to the circle of
Gwynvyd. In any other than these three ways, a man cannot be adjudged as
eneidvaddeu by man, for it is God alone who knows how to judge what is
otherwise. The first of them will remain in Abred, in the state and
nature of man, without falling lower; and the other two will ascend to
the circle of Gwynvyd.

15\. The three accelerations of the end of Abred: diseases; fighting;
and becoming eneidvaddeu, justly, reasonably, and necessarily, from
doing good; for without them there would be no release from Abred, but
at a much later period. Herein is seen that it was for the benefit of,
and mercy to, living beings, God ordained the mutual fighting and mutual
slaughter, which take place among them.

16\. The three states of animations: the state of Annwn and Abred, where
evil predominates over the good, and hence there is essential evil--and
in Annwn are every beginning and progression towards what is better in
Abred; the state of humanity, where evil and good equiponderate, hence
ensues liberty, and in liberty is power to choose, and consequently
improvement; the state of Gwynvyd, where good predominates over evil,
and there is success in love, since nothing is loved there of necessity
but the good, though it be also loved of choice, and hence there is
every completion of goodness, and an end to every evil.

17\. The three necessities of the occupants of Abred: the predominance
of opposition and Cythraul over prosperity and amendment; necessary
lawlessness; and death, ensuing from the mastery of Cythraul, and from
the system

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span> <span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

of deliverance, which is according to the love and mercy of God.

18\. The three necessities of mankind: liberty, for there is no
necessary good or evil, inasmuch as both equiponderate, and hence either
may be chosen according to judgment and consideration; power, for free
choice may be made; and judgment, because there is understanding derived
from power, and because what is capable of being otherwise ought to be
judged.

19\. The three necessities of the state of Gwynvyd: the predominance of
good over evil, and hence love; memory reaching from Annwn, and hence
perfect judgment and understanding, without the possibility of doubting
or differing, and hence, the necessary choice of goodness; and
superiority over death, consisting in power derived from knowing the
whole of its cause, and the means of escaping it--the same being
unopposed and unrestrained--and hence everlasting life.

20\. There are three common feasts, according to the order and
regulation of the Bards of the Isle of Britain: the first, the feasts of
the four albans; <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_323.md) the second, the
feasts of worship, at the quarters of the moon; the third, the feasts of
country and nation, consequent upon a triumph and deliverance, and held
under the proclamation and notice of forty days. Others say: There are
three feasts of endowment, under the sanction of the Bards of the Isle
of Britain, at which every one presents his gift, made up of the three
tributes, namely, honey, flour, and milk. That is to say: the feasts of
contribution, under the proclamation of forty days; the feasts of alban;
and the feasts of worship; and it is the privilege of Bards to preside
at them, and to receive gifts of the three tributes of endowment, which
are, corn, milk, and honey.

21\. There are three other feasts, in which Bards preside by courtesy,
namely: the feast of the head of kindred; a marriage feast; and the
feast of a fire back, which takes place when five fire back stones have
been raised, so as to

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span> <span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

constitute a dwelling station. At them are contributed the gifts of the
comot and nation to the ninth generation; and the endowments of those
feasts are of tilth, fold, and wood covert, as will be easiest to obtain
and give them; the Bard having things by courtesy.

22\. Three things unprivileged to a Bard, for they are not proper for
him, that is to say: metallurgy, with which he has nothing to do, except
to improve it by means of his learning, knowledge, and doctrine; the
second is warfare, for there ought to be no naked weapon of offence in
his hand, since he is a man of peace and tranquillity; the third is
commerce, for he is a man of primary law and justice, and his office is
to teach country and nation. And because of these things, it is adjudged
that a Bard ought to follow no trade other than his office and art of
song and Bardism, lest what ought to belong to a Bard and Bardism should
become corrupted, deteriorated, and lost.

23\. Three pursuits are free to a Bard, and to every other native of
country and nation, namely: hunting; agriculture; and pastoral cares;
for it is by means of these that all men obtain sustenance, and they
ought not to be forbidden to any one who may wish them. Others say:
ploughing; pastoral cares; and medicine; for these are pursuits of
amendment, under the sanction of peace and natural law.

24\. The three principal endeavours of a Bard: one is to learn and
collect sciences; the second is to teach; and the third is to make
peace, and to put an end to all injury; for to do contrary to these
things is not usual or becoming to a Bard. <span

id="page_348">p. 348</span> "Llion " means an aggregate of floods. The
bursting of the Lake of Llion is thus chronicled in the Triads:--"The
three awful events of the Isle of Britain: first, the bursting of the
Lake of Llion, and the overwhelming of the face of all lands; so that
all mankind were drowned, excepting Dwyvan and Dwyvach, who escaped in a
naked vessel, and of them the island of Britain was re-peopled." (13,
Third Series.) In another Triad (97) it is stated that "the ship of
Nevydd Nav Neivion carried a male and female of all living beings, when
the Lake of Llion burst."

It is alluded to by Iorwerth Vynglwyd;--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lle ’r gwin mal lloer ar gynnydd,  
Llawn byth fal *llyn llion* bydd.

The store for wine, like the moon on the increase,  
Ever full, like the *Lake of Llion*, will it be.

</div>

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

In the British Chronicles Arthur is introduced, as saying thus;--"There
is a lake near the Severn, called *the Lake of Llion*, which swallows
all the water that flows into it at the tide of flood, without any
visible increase; but at the tide of ebb, it swells up like a mountain,
and pours its waters over its banks, so that whoever stands near it at
this time, must run the risk of being overwhelmed."--Myv. Arch. v. ii.
p. 311.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[351:1](bim1120.htm#fr_322.md) <span
id="page_350">p. 350</span> "The three benefactors of the Isle of
Britain: the first, Hu the Mighty, who first shewed the nation of the
Cymry the method of cultivating the ground, when they were in the Summer
Country, namely, where Constantinople now stands, before they came into
the Isle of Britain." Tr. 56,

The benefit which he thus conferred on his countrymen is frequently
alluded to by the Bards; for instance, Iolo the Red, or Iolo Goch, the
bard of Owain Glyndwr, observes of him;--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ai daliodd gwedy diliw,  
Aradr braisg, arnodd-gadr, gwiw.

After the deluge, he held  
The strong-beamed plough, active and excellent.

</div>

See Dr. Pugh's Dict. v.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[351:2](bim1120.htm#fr_323.md) Hu. Al. "his life."

<span id="fn_322"></span>[351:3](bim1120.htm#fr_324.md) <span
id="page_351">p. 351</span> The doctrine of *eneidvaddeu* is recognised
in the Laws of Dyvnwal Moelmud. Thus, in Triads 19, 20, we read:--"There
are three strong punishments: *eneidvaddeu*; cutting off a limb; and
banishment from the country, by the cry and pursuit of men and dogs; and
it is for the king to direct which he willeth to be inflicted." "There
are three *eneidvaddeu* punishments: beheading; hanging; and burning;
and it is for the king or lord of the territory to order which he
willeth to be inflicted." On the supposition that these laws were really
enacted by, or under the authority of Dyvnwal Moelmud, it follows, that
the doctrine which the above Triads involve, is as old at least as 430
before Christ. It seems as if a misapprehension of its real nature gave
rise to the opinion which Julius Cæsar entertained, that the Britons
offered human sacrifices.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[355:1](bim1120.htm#fr_325.md) <span
id="page_354">p. 354</span> These are the equinoxes and solstices of the

<span id="fn_324"></span>[357:1](bim1120.htm#fr_326.md) <span
id="page_356">p. 356</span> In Iolo's manuscript the five last Triads
follow immediately after Tr. 19; but they are crossed, as if they were
not of the same series.
