### THE FALL IN ABRED.

God made all living beings in the circle of Gwynvyd at one breath; but
they would be gods, <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_268) and attempted
to traverse the Ceugant. This, however, they could not do, wherefore
they fell down to Annwn, which unites with death and the earth, where is
the beginning of all living owners of terrestrial bodies.

Question. Where is Annwn?

Answer. In the extreme limits of the circle of Gwynvyd. That is, living
beings knew not how to distinguish evil from good, and therefore they
fell into evil, and went into Abred, which they traversed until they
came back into the circle of Gwynvyd.

Q. What ignorance did they commit?

A. They would venture on the circle of Ceugant, and hence became proud;
but they could not traverse it, consequently they fell into the circle
of Abred.
