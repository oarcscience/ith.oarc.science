### CICERO, (slain) B.C. 43.

<span class="small">"This method of divination has not been neglected
even amongst barbarous nations. For there are Druids in Gaul, with one
of whom I was acquainted, namely, Divitiacus Æduus, who enjoyed the
hospitality of your house, and spoke of you with admiration. This man
not only professed an intimate knowledge of the system of nature, which
the Greeks call physiology, but also foretold future events, partly by
augury, and partly by conjecture." <span

<span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>

Cicero does not speak here from vague report; but declares the
profession of a man who was personally known to him, who had been his
guest, and with whom he had familiarly conversed. And all that he says
of him coincides almost exactly with the statements of Cæsar, Strabo,
and Diodorus Siculus. The only new fact that we are made acquainted with
is, that the Druids sometimes foretold future events "by conjecture;"
but perhaps we should not take the word to mean simply a *guess*, but as
synonymous with *inference*--to signify that they had some foundation
for all their vaticinations.
