### CHAPTER VI

#### APPARITIONS AT OR AFTER DEATH

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> has been said by a very eminent
literary man that the accounts of the appearance of people at or shortly
after the moment of death make very dull reading as a general rule. This
may be; they are certainly not so lengthy, or full of detail, as the
accounts of haunted houses—nor could such be expected. In our humble
opinion, however, they are full of interest, and open up problems of
telepathy and thought-transference to which the solutions may not be
found for years to come. That people have seen the image of a friend or
relative at the moment of dissolution, sometimes in the ordinary garb of
life, sometimes with symbolical accompaniments, or that they have been
made acquainted in some abnormal manner with the fact that such a one
has passed away, seems to be demonstrated beyond all reasonable doubt.
But we would hasten to add that

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

such appearances are not a proof of existence after death, nor can they
be regarded in the light of special interventions of a merciful
Providence. Were they either they would surely occur far oftener. The
question is, Why do they occur at all? As it is, the majority of them
seem to happen for no particular reason, and are often seen by persons
who have little or no connection with the deceased, not by their nearest
and dearest, as one might expect. It is supposed they are *veridical*
hallucinations, *i.e.* ones which correspond with objective events at a
distance, and are caused by a telepathic impact conveyed from the mind
of an absent agent to the mind of the percipient.

From their nature they fall under different heads. The majority of them
occur at what may most conveniently be described as the time of death,
though how closely they approximate in reality to the instant of the
Great Change it is impossible to say. So we have divided this chapter
into three groups:

\(1\) Appearances at the time of death (as explained above).

\(2\) Appearances clearly *after* the time of death.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

\(3\) In this third group we hope to give three curious tales of
appearances some time *before* death.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Group</span> I

We commence this group with stories in which the phenomena connected
with the respective deaths were not perceived as representations of the
human form. In the first only sounds were heard. It is sent as a
personal experience by the Archdeacon of Limerick, Very Rev. J. A.
Haydn, LL.D. "In the year 1879 there lived in the picturesque village of
Adare, at a distance of about eight or nine miles from my residence, a
District Inspector named —, with whom I enjoyed a friendship of the most
intimate and fraternal kind. At the time I write of, Mrs. — was
expecting the arrival of their third child. She was a particularly tiny
and fragile woman, and much anxiety was felt as to the result of the
impending event. He and she had very frequently spent pleasant days at
my house, with all the apartments of which they were thoroughly
acquainted—a fact of importance in this narrative.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

"On Wednesday, October 17, 1879, I had a very jubilant letter from my
friend, announcing that the expected event had successfully happened on
the previous day, and that all was progressing satisfactorily. On the
night of the following Wednesday, October 22, I retired to bed at about
ten o'clock. My wife, the children, and two maid-servants were all
sleeping upstairs, and I had a small bed in my study, which was on the
ground floor. The house was shrouded in darkness, and the only sound
that broke the silence was the ticking of the hall-clock.

"I was quietly preparing to go to sleep, when I was much surprised at
hearing, with the most unquestionable distinctness, the sound of light,
hurried footsteps, exactly suggestive of those of an active, restless
young female, coming in from the hall door and traversing the hall. They
then, apparently with some hesitation, followed the passage leading to
the study door, on arriving at which they stopped. I then heard the
sound of a light, agitated hand apparently searching for the handle of
the door. By this time, being quite sure that my wife had come

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

down and wanted to speak to me, I sat up in bed, and called to her by
name, asking what was the matter. As there was no reply, and the sounds
had ceased, I struck a match, lighted a candle, and opened the door. No
one was visible or audible. I went upstairs, found all the doors shut
and everyone asleep. Greatly puzzled, I returned to the study and went
to bed, leaving the candle alight. Immediately the whole performance was
circumstantially repeated, but *this* time the handle of the door was
grasped by the invisible hand, and *partly* turned, then relinquished. I
started out of bed and renewed my previous search, with equally futile
results. The clock struck eleven, and from that time all disturbances
ceased.

"On Friday morning I received a letter stating that Mrs. — had died at
about midnight on the previous Wednesday. I hastened off to Adare and
had an interview with my bereaved friend. With one item of our
conversation I will close. He told me that his wife sank rapidly on
Wednesday, until when night came on she became delirious. She spoke
incoherently, as if revisiting scenes and places once familiar. 'She
thought

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

she was in *your* house,' he said, 'and was apparently holding a
conversation with *you*, as she used to keep silence at intervals as if
listening to your replies.' I asked him if he could possibly remember
the hour at which the imaginary conversation took place. He replied
that, curiously enough, he could tell it accurately, as he had looked at
his watch, and found the time between half-past ten and eleven
o'clock—the exact time of the mysterious manifestations heard by me."

A lady sends the following personal experience: "I had a cousin in the
country who was not very strong, and on one occasion she desired me to
go to her, and accompany her to K—. I consented to do so, and arranged a
day to go and meet her: this was in the month of February. The evening
before I was to go, I was sitting by the fire in my small parlour about
5 P.M. There was no light in the room except what proceeded from the
fire. Beside the fireplace was an armchair, where my cousin usually sat
when she was with me. Suddenly that chair was illuminated by a light so
intensely bright that it actually seemed to heave under it, though the
remainder of

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

the room remained in semi-darkness. I called out in amazement, 'What has
happened to the chair?' In a moment the light vanished, and the chair
was as before. In the morning I heard that my cousin had died about the
same time that I saw the light."

We now come to the ordinary type, *i.e.* where a figure appears. The
following tale illustrates a point we have already alluded to, namely,
that the apparition is sometimes seen by a disinterested person, and not
by those whom one would naturally expect should see it. A lady writes as
follows: "At Island Magee is the Knowehead Lonan, a long, hilly, narrow
road, bordered on either side by high thorn-hedges and fields. Twenty
years ago, when I was a young girl, I used to go to the post-office at
the Knowehead on Sunday mornings down the Lonan, taking the dogs for the
run. One Sunday as I had got to the top of the hill on my return
journey, I looked back, and saw a man walking rapidly after me, but
still a good way off. I hastened my steps, for the day was muddy, and I
did not want him to see me in a bedraggled state. But

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

he seemed to come on so fast as to be soon close behind me, and I
wondered he did not pass me, so on we went, I never turning to look
back. About a quarter of a mile farther on I met A. B. on 'Dick's Brae,'
on her way to church or Sunday school, and stopped to speak to her. I
wanted to ask who the man was, but he seemed to be so close that I did
not like to do so, and expected he had passed. When I moved on, I was
surprised to find he was still following me, while my dogs were lagging
behind with downcast heads and drooping tails.

"I then passed a cottage where C. D. was out feeding her fowls. I spoke
to her, and then feeling that there was no longer anyone behind, looked
back, and saw the man standing with her. I would not have paid any
attention to the matter had not A. B. been down at our house that
afternoon, and I casually asked her:

"'Who was the man who was just behind me when I met you on Dick's Brae?'

"'What man?' said she; and noting my look of utter astonishment, added,
'I give you my word I never met a soul but yourself

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

from the time I left home till I went down to Knowehead Lonan.'

"Next day C. D. came to work for us, and I asked her who was the man who
was standing beside her after I passed her on Sunday.

"'Naebody!' she replied, 'I saw naebody but yoursel’.'

"It all seemed very strange, and so they thought too. About three weeks
later news. came that C. D.’s only brother, a sailor, was washed
overboard that Sunday morning."

The following story is not a first-hand experience, but is sent by the
gentleman to whom it was related by the percipient. The latter said to
him:

"I was sitting in this same chair I am in at present one evening, when I
heard a knock at the front door. I went myself to see who was there, and
on opening the door saw my old friend P. Q. standing outside with his
gun in his hand. I was surprised at seeing him, but asked him to come in
and have something. He came inside the porch into the lamplight, and
stood there for a few moments; then he muttered something about being
sorry he had disturbed me, and

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

that he was on his way to see his brother, Colonel Q., who lived about a
mile farther on. Without any further explanation he walked away towards
the gate into the dusk.

"I was greatly surprised and perplexed, but as he had gone I sat down
again by the fire. About an hour later another knock came to the door,
and I again went out to see who was there. On opening it I found P. Q.’s
groom holding a horse, and he asked me where he was, as he had missed
his way in the dark, and did not know the locality. I told him, and then
asked him where he was going, and why, and he replied that his master
was dead (at his own house about nine miles away), and that he had been
sent to announce the news to Colonel Q."

Miss Grene, of Grene Park, Co. Tipperary, relates a story which was told
her by the late Miss —, sister of a former Dean of Cashel. The latter,
an old lady, stated that one time she was staying with a friend in a
house in the suburbs of Dublin. In front of the house was the usual
grass plot, divided into two by a short gravel path which led down to a
gate which opened on to the street. She and her friend were one day

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

engaged in needlework in one of the front rooms, when they heard the
gate opening, and on looking out the window they saw an elderly
gentleman of their acquaintance coming up the path. As he approached the
door both exclaimed: "Oh, how good of him to come and see us!" As he was
not shown into the sitting-room, one of them rang the bell, and said to
the maid when she appeared, "You have not let Mr. So-and-so in; he is at
the door for some little time." The maid went to the hall door, and
returned to say that there was no one there. Next day they learnt that
he had died just at the hour that they had seen him coming up the path.

The following tale contains a curious point. A good many years ago the
Rev. Henry Morton, now dead, held a curacy in Ireland. He had to pass
through the graveyard when leaving his house to visit the parishioners.
One beautiful moonlight night he was sent for to visit a sick person,
and was accompanied by his brother, a medical man, who was staying with
him. After performing the religious duty they returned through the
churchyard, and were chatting about

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

various matters when to their astonishment a figure passed them, both
seeing it. This figure left the path, and went in among the gravestones,
and then disappeared. They could not understand this at all, so they
went to the spot where the disappearance took place, but, needless to
say, could find nobody after the most careful search. Next morning they
heard that the person visited had died just after their departure, while
the most marvellous thing of all was that the burial took place at the
very spot where they had seen the phantom disappear.

The Rev. D. B. Knox communicates the following: In a girls’
boarding-school several years ago two of the boarders were sleeping in a
large double-bedded room with two doors. About two o'clock in the
morning the girls were awakened by the entrance of a tall figure in
clerical attire, the face of which they did not see. They screamed in
fright, but the figure moved in a slow and stately manner past their
beds, and out the other door. It also appeared to one or two of the
other boarders, and seemed to be looking for some one. At length it
reached the bed of one who was evidently

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

known to it. The girl woke up and recognised her father. He did not
speak, but gazed for a few moments at his daughter, and then vanished.
Next morning a telegram was handed to her which communicated the sad
news that her father had died on the previous evening at the hour when
he appeared to her.

Here is a story of a very old type. It occurred a good many years ago. A
gentleman named Miller resided in Co. Wexford, while his friend and
former schoolfellow lived in the North of Ireland. This long friendship
led them to visit at each other's houses from time to time, but for Mr.
Miller there was a deep shadow of sorrow over these otherwise happy
moments, for, while he enjoyed the most enlightened religious opinions,
his friend was an unbeliever. The last time they were together Mr. Scott
said, "My dear friend, let us solemnly promise that whichever of us
shall die first shall appear to the other after death, if it be
possible." "Let it be so, if God will," replied Mr. Miller. One morning
some time after, about three o'clock, the latter was awakened by a
brilliant light in his bedroom;

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

he imagined that the house must be on fire, when he felt what seemed to
be a hand laid on him, and heard his friend's voice say distinctly,
"There is a God, just but terrible in His judgments," and all again was
dark. Mr. Miller at once wrote down this remarkable experience. Two days
later he received a letter announcing Mr. Scott's death on the night,
and at the hour, that he had seen the light in his room.

The above leads us on to the famous "Beresford Ghost," which is
generally regarded as holding the same position relative to Irish ghosts
that Dame Alice Kyteler used to hold with respect to Irish witches and
wizards. The story is so well known, and has been published so often,
that only a brief allusion is necessary, with the added information that
the best version is to be found in Andrew Lang's *Dreams and Ghosts*,
chapter viii. (Silver Library Edition). Lord Tyrone appeared after death
one night to Lady Beresford at Gill Hall, in accordance with a promise
(as in the last story) made in early life. He assured her that the
religion as revealed by Jesus Christ was the only true one (both he and
Lady Beresford

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

had been brought up Deists), told her that she was *enceinte* and would
bear a son, and also foretold her second marriage, and the time of her
death. In proof whereof he drew the bed-hangings through an iron hook,
wrote his name in her pocket-book, and finally placed a hand cold as
marble on her wrist, at which the sinews shrunk up.. To the day of her
death Lady Beresford wore a black ribbon round her wrist; this was taken
off before her burial, and it was. found the nerves were withered, and
the sinews shrunken, as she had previously described to her children.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Group</span> II

We now come to some stories of apparitions seen some time after the hour
of death. Canon Ross-Lewin, of Limerick, furnishes the following
incident in his own family. "My uncle, John Dillon Ross-Lewin,
lieutenant in the 30th Regiment, was mortally wounded at Inkerman on
November 5, 1854, and died on the morning of the 6th. He appeared that
night to his mother, who was then on a visit in Co. Limerick, intimating

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

his death, and indicating where the wound was. The strangest part of the
occurrence is, that when news came later on of the casualties at
Inkerman, the first account as to the wound did *not* correspond with
what the apparition indicated to his mother, but the final account did.
Mrs. Ross-Lewin was devoted to her son, and he was equally attached to
her; she, as the widow of a field officer who fought at Waterloo, would
be able to comprehend the battle scene, and her mind at the time was
centred on the events of the Crimean War."

A clergyman, who desires that all names be suppressed, sends the
following: "In my wife's father's house a number of female servants were
kept, of whom my wife, before she was married, was in charge. On one
occasion the cook took ill with appendicitis, and was operated on in the
Infirmary, where I attended her as hospital chaplain. She died, however,
and was buried by her friends. Some days after the funeral my wife was
standing at a table in the kitchen which was so placed that any person
standing at it could see into the

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

passage outside the kitchen, if the door happened to be open. \[The
narrator enclosed a rough plan which made the whole story perfectly
clear.\] She was standing one day by herself at the table, and the door
was open. This was in broad daylight, about eleven o'clock in the
morning in the end of February or beginning of March. She was icing a
cake, and therefore was hardly thinking of ghosts. Suddenly she looked
up from her work, and glanced through the open kitchen door into the
passage leading past the servants’ parlour into the dairy. She saw quite
distinctly the figure of the deceased cook pass towards the dairy; she
was dressed in the ordinary costume she used to wear in the mornings,
and seemed in every respect quite normal. My wife was not, at the
moment, in the least shocked or surprised, but on the contrary she
followed, and searched in the dairy, into which she was just in time to
see her skirts disappearing. Needless to say, nothing was visible."

Canon Courtenay Moore, M.A., Rector of Mitchelstown, contributes a
personal experience. "It was about eighteen years ago—I cannot fix the
exact date—that Samuel

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Penrose returned
to this parish from the Argentine. He was getting on so well abroad that
he would have remained there, but his wife fell ill, and for her sake he
returned to Ireland. He was a carpenter by trade, and his former
employer was glad to take him into his service again. Sam was a very
respectable man of sincere religious feelings. Soon after his return he
met with one or two rather severe accidents, and had a strong impression
that a fatal one would happen him before long; and so it came to pass. A
scaffolding gave way one day, and precipitated him on to a flagged stone
floor. He did not die immediately, but his injuries proved fatal. He
died in a Cork hospital soon after his admission: I went to Cork to
officiate at his funeral. About noon the next day I was standing at my
hall door, and the form of poor Sam, the upper half of it, seemed to
pass before me. He looked peaceful and happy—it was a momentary vision,
but perfectly distinct. The truncated appearance puzzled me very much,
until some time after I read a large book by F. W. H. Myers, in which he
made a scientific analysis and induction of

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

such phenomena, and said that they were almost universally seen in this
half-length form. I do not profess to explain what I saw: its message,
if it had a message, seemed to be that poor Sam was at last at rest and
in peace."

A story somewhat similar to the above was related to us, in which the
apparition seems certainly to have been sent with a definite purpose.
Two maiden ladies, whom we shall call Miss A. X. and Miss B. Y., lived
together for a good many years. As one would naturally expect, they were
close friends, and had the most intimate relations with each other, both
being extremely religious women. In process of time Miss B. Y. died, and
after death Miss A. X. formed the impression, for some unknown reason,
that all was not well with her friend—that, in fact, her soul was not at
rest. This thought caused her great uneasiness and trouble of mind. One
day she was sitting in her armchair thinking over this, and crying
bitterly. Suddenly she saw in front of her a brilliant light, in the
midst of which was her friend's face, easily recognisable, but
transfigured, and wearing

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

a most beatific expression. She rushed towards it with her arms
outstretched, crying, "Oh! B., why have you come?" At this the
apparition faded away, but ever after Miss A. X. was perfectly tranquil
in mind with respect to her friend's salvation.

This group may be brought to a conclusion by a story sent by Mr. T.
MacFadden. It is not a personal experience, but happened to his father,
and in an accompanying letter he states that he often heard the latter
describe the incidents related therein, and that he certainly saw the
ghost.

"The island of Inishinny, which is the scene of this story, is one of
the most picturesque islands on the Donegal coast. With the islands of
Gola and Inismaan it forms a perfectly natural harbour and safe
anchorage for ships during storms. About Christmas some forty or fifty
years ago a small sailing-ship put into Gola Roads (as this anchorage is
called) during a prolonged storm, and the captain and two men had to
obtain provisions from Bunbeg, as, owing to their being detained so
long, their supply was almost exhausted. They had previously visited the
island on several occasions, and

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

made themselves at home with the people from the mainland who were
temporarily resident upon it.

"The old bar at its best was never very safe for navigation, and this
evening it was in its element, as with every storm it presented one
boiling, seething mass of foam. The inhabitants of the island saw the
frail small boat from the ship securely inside the bar, and prophesied
some dire calamity should the captain and the two sailors venture to
return to the ship that night. But the captain and his companions,
having secured sufficient provisions, decided (as far as I can remember
the story), even in spite of the entreaties of those on shore, to return
to the ship. The storm was increasing, and what with their scanty
knowledge of the intricacies of the channel, and the darkness of the
night, certain it was the next morning their craft was found washed
ashore on the island, and the body of the captain was discovered by the
first man who made the round of the shore looking for logs of timber, or
other useful articles washed ashore from wrecks. The bodies of the two
sailors were never recovered, and

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

word was sent immediately to the captain's wife in Derry, who came in a
few days and gave directions for the disposal of her husband's corpse.

"The island was only temporarily inhabited by a few people who had
cattle and horses grazing there for some weeks in the year, and after
this catastrophe they felt peculiarly lonely, and sought refuge from
their thoughts by all spending the evening together in one house. This
particular evening they were all seated round the fire having a chat,
when they heard steps approaching the door. Though the approach was
fine, soft sand, yet the steps were audible as if coming on hard ground.
They knew there was no one on the island save the few who were sitting
quietly round the fire, and so in eager expectation they faced round to
the door. What was their amazement when the door opened, and a tall,
broad-shouldered man appeared and filled the whole doorway—and that man
the captain who had been buried several days previously. He wore the
identical suit in which he had often visited the island and even the
"cheese-cutter" cap, so common

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

a feature of sea-faring men's apparel, was not wanting. All were struck
dumb with terror, and a woman who sat in a corner opposite the door,
exclaimed in Irish in a low voice to my father:

"'O God! Patrick, there's the captain.'

"My father, recovering from the first shock, when he saw feminine
courage finding expression in words, said in Irish to the apparition:

"'Come in!'

"They were so certain of the appearance that they addressed him in his
own language, as they invariably talked Irish in the district in those
days. But no sooner had he uttered the invitation than the figure,
without the least word or sign, moved back, and disappeared from their
view. They rushed out, but could discover no sign of any living person
within the confines of the island. Such is the true account of an
accident, by which three men lost their lives, and the ghostly sequel,
in which one of them appeared to the eyes of four people, two of whom
are yet alive, and can vouch for the accuracy of this narrative."

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

##### <span class="smallcaps">Group</span> III

We now come to the third group of this chapter, in which we shall relate
two firsthand experiences of tragedies being actually witnessed some
time before they happened, as well as a reliable second-hand story of an
apparition being seen two days before the death occurred. The first of
these is sent by a lady, the percipient, who desires that her name be
suppressed; with it was enclosed a letter from a gentleman who stated
that he could testify to the truth of the following facts:

"The morning of May 18, 1902, was one of the worst that ever dawned in
Killarney. All through the day a fierce nor’-wester raged, and huge
white-crested waves, known locally as 'The O’Donoghue's white horses,'
beat on the shores of Lough Leane. Then followed hail-showers such as I
have never seen before or since. Hailstones quite as large as small
marbles fell with such rapidity, and seemed so hard that the glass in
the windows of the room in which I stood appeared to be about to break
into fragments every moment. I remained

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

at the window, gazing out on the turbulent waters of the lake. Sometimes
a regular fog appeared, caused by the terrible downpour of rain and the
fury of the gale.

"During an occasional lull I could see the islands plainly looming in
the distance. In one of these clear intervals, the time being about
12.30 P.M., five friends of mine were reading in the room in which I
stood. 'Quick! quick!' I cried. 'Is that a boat turned over?' My friends
all ran to the windows, but could see nothing. I persisted, however, and
said, 'It is on its side, with the keel turned towards us, and it is
empty.' Still none of my friends could see anything. I then ran out, and
got one of the men-servants to go down to a gate, about one hundred
yards nearer the lake than where I stood. He had a powerful telescope,
and remained with great difficulty in the teeth of the storm with his
glass for several minutes, but could see nothing. When he returned
another man took his place, but he also failed to see anything.

"I seemed so distressed that those around me kept going backwards and
forwards to the windows, and then asked me what was

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

the size of the boat I had seen. I gave them the exact size, measuring
by landmarks. They then assured me that I must be absolutely wrong, as
it was on rare occasions that a 'party' boat, such as the one I
described, could venture on the lakes on such a day. Therefore there
were seven persons who thought I was wrong in what I had seen. I still
contended that I saw the boat, the length of which I described, as
plainly as possible.

"The day wore on, and evening came. The incident was apparently more or
less forgotten by all but me, until at 8 A.M. on the following morning,
when the maid brought up tea, her first words were, 'Ah, miss, is it not
terrible about the accident!' Naturally I said, 'What accident, Mary?'
She replied, 'There were thirteen people drowned yesterday evening out
of a four-oared boat.' That proved that the boat I had seen at 12.30
P.M. was a vision foreshadowing the wreck of the boat off Darby's Garden
at 5.30 P.M. The position, shape, and size of the boat seen by me were
identical with the one that was lost on the evening of May 18, 1902."

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

The second story relates how a lady witnessed a vision (shall we call
it) of a suicide a week before the terrible deed was committed. This
incident surely makes it clear that such cannot be looked upon as
special interventions of Providence, for if the lady had recognised the
man, she might have prevented his rash act. Mrs. MacAlpine says: "In
June 1889, I drove to Castleblaney, in Co. Monaghan, to meet my sister:
I expected her at three o'clock, but as she did not come by that train,
I put up the horse and went for a walk in the demesne. At length
becoming tired, I sat down on a rock by the edge of a lake. My attention
was quite taken up with the beauty of the scene before me, as it was a
glorious summer's day. Presently I felt a cold chill creep through me,
and a curious stiffness came over my limbs, as if I could not move,
though wishing to do so. I felt frightened, yet chained to the spot, and
as if impelled to stare at the water straight before me. Gradually a
black cloud seemed to rise, and in the midst of it I saw a tall man, in

gone, and I again became sensible of the heat and sunshine, but I was
awed, and felt eerie. This happened about June 25, and on July 3 a Mr.
—, a bank clerk, committed suicide by drowning himself in the
lake." <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

The following incident occurred in the United States, but, as it is
closely connected with this country, it will not seem out of place to
insert it here. It is sent by Mr. Richard Hogan as the personal
experience of his sister, Mrs. Mary Murnane, and is given in her own
words.

"On the 4th of August 1886, at 10.30 o'clock in the morning, I left my
own house, 21 Montrose St., Philadelphia, to do some shopping. I had not
proceeded more than fifty yards when on turning the corner of the street
I observed my aunt approaching me within five or six yards. I was
greatly astonished, for the last letter I had from home (Limerick)
stated that she was dying of consumption, but the thought occurred to me
that she might have recovered somewhat, and come out to Philadelphia.
This opinion was quickly changed as we

approached each other, for our eyes met, and she had the colour of one
who had risen from the grave. I seemed to feel my hair stand on end, for
just as we were about to pass each other she turned her face towards me,
and I gasped, 'My God, she is dead, and is going to speak to me!' but no
word was spoken, and she passed on. After proceeding a short distance I
looked back, and she continued on to Washington Avenue, where she
disappeared from me. There was no other person near at the time, and
being so close, I was well able to note what she wore. She held a
sunshade over her head, and the clothes, hat, &c., were those I knew so
well before I left Ireland. I wrote home telling what I had seen, and
asking if she was dead. I received a reply saying she was not dead at
the date I saw her, but had been asking if a letter had come from me for
some days before her death. It was just two days before she actually
died that I had seen her."
