### CHAPTER II

#### HAUNTED HOUSES IN CONN'S HALF

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> a very early period a division of
Ireland into two "halves" existed. This was traditionally believed to
have been made by Conn the Hundred-fighter and Mogh Nuadat, in A.D. 166.
The north was in consequence known as Conn's Half, the south as Mogh's
Half, the line of division being a series of gravel hills extending from
Dublin to Galway. This division we have followed, except that we have
included the whole of the counties of West Meath and Galway in the
northern portion. We had hoped originally to have had *four* chapters on
Haunted Houses, one for each of the four provinces, but, for lack of
material from Connaught, we have been forced to adopt the plan on which
Chapters I—III are arranged.

Mrs. Acheson, of Co. Roscommon, sends the following: "Emo House, Co.
Westmeath,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

a very old mansion since pulled down, was purchased by my grandfather
for his son, my father. The latter had only been living in it for a few
days when knocking commenced at the hall door. Naturally he thought it
was someone playing tricks, or endeavouring to frighten him away. One
night he had the lobby window open directly over the door. The knocking
commenced, and he looked out: it was a very bright night, and as there
was no porch he could see the door distinctly; the knocking continued,
but he did not see the knocker move. Another night he sat up expecting
his brother, but as the latter did not come he went to bed. Finally the
knocking became so loud and insistent that he felt sure his brother must
have arrived. He went downstairs and opened the door, but no one was
there. Still convinced that his brother was there and had gone round to
the yard to put up his horse, he went out; but scarcely had he gone
twenty yards from the door when the knocking recommenced behind his
back. On turning round he could see no one."

"After this the knocking got very bad,

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

so much so that he could not rest. All this time he did not mention the
strange occurrence to anyone. One morning he went up through the fields
between four and five o'clock. To his surprise he found the herd out
feeding the cattle. My father asked him why he was up so early. He
replied that he could not sleep. 'Why?' asked my father. 'You know why
yourself, sir —the knocking.' He then found that this man had heard it
all the time, though he slept at the end of a long house. My father was
advised to take no notice of it, for it would go as it came, though at
this time it was continuous and very loud; and so it did. The country
people said it was the late resident who could not rest."

"We had another curious and most eerie experience in this house. A
former rector was staying the night with us, and as the evening wore on
we commenced to tell ghost-stories. He related some remarkable
experiences, and as we were talking the drawing-room door suddenly
opened as wide as possible, and then slowly closed again. It was a calm
night, and at any rate it was a heavy double door which never flies open

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

however strong the wind may be blowing. Everyone in the house was in
bed, as it was after 12 o'clock, except the three persons who witnessed
this, viz. myself, my daughter, and the rector. The effect on the latter
was most marked. He was a big, strong, jovial man and a good athlete,
but when he saw the door open he quivered like an aspen leaf."

A strange story of a haunting, in which nothing was seen, but in which
the same noises were heard by different people, is sent by one of the
percipients, who does not wish to have her name disclosed. She says:
"When staying for a time in a country house in the North of Ireland some
years ago I was awakened on several nights by hearing the tramp, tramp,
of horses’ hoofs. Sometimes it sounded as if they were walking on
paving-stones, while at other times I had the impression that they were
going round a large space, and as if someone was using a whip on them. I
heard neighing, and champing of bits, and so formed the impression that
they were carriage horses. I did not mind it much at first, as I thought
the stables must be

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

near that part of the house. After hearing these noises several times I
began to get curious, so one morning I made a tour of the place. I found
that the side of the house I occupied overlooked a neglected garden,
which was mostly used for drying clothes. I also discovered that the
stables were right at the back of the house, and so it would be
impossible for me to hear any noises in that quarter; at any rate there
was only one farm horse left, and this was securely fastened up every
night. Also there were no cobble-stones round the yard. I mentioned what
I had heard to the people of the house, but as they would give me no
satisfactory reply I passed it over. I did not hear these noises every
night."

"One night I was startled out of my sleep by hearing a dreadful
disturbance in the kitchen. It sounded as if the dish-covers were being
taken off the wall and dashed violently on the flagged floor. At length
I got up and opened the door of my bedroom, and just as I did so an
appalling crash resounded through the house. I waited to see if there
was any light to be seen, or footstep to be heard, but nobody

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

was stirring. There was only one servant in the house, the other persons
being my host, his wife, and a baby, who had all retired early. Next
morning I described the noises in the kitchen to the servant, and she
said she had often heard them. I then told her about the tramping of
horses: she replied that she herself had never heard it, but that other
persons who had occupied my room had had experiences similar to mine. I
asked her was there any explanation; she said No, except that a story
was told of a gentleman who had lived there some years ago, and was very
much addicted to racing and gambling, and that he was shot one night in
that house. For the remainder of my visit I was removed to another part
of the house, and I heard no more noises."

A house in the North of Ireland, near that locality which is eternally
famous as having furnished the material for the last trial for
witchcraft in the country, is said to be haunted, the reason being that
it is built on the site of a disused and very ancient graveyard. It is
said that when some repairs were being carried out nine human skulls

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

were unearthed. It would be interesting to ascertain how many houses in
Ireland are traditionally said to be built on such unpleasant sites, and
if they all bear the reputation of being haunted. The present writer
knows of one, in the South, which is so situated (and this is supported,
to a certain extent, by documentary evidence from the thirteenth century
down) and which in consequence has an uncanny reputation. But concerning
the above house it has been found almost impossible to get any
information. It is said that strange noises were frequently heard there,
which sometimes seemed as if cartloads of stones were being run down one
of the gables. On one occasion an inmate of the house lay dying
upstairs. A friend went up to see the sick person, and on proceeding to
pass through the bedroom door was pressed and jostled as if by some
unseen person hurriedly leaving the room. On entering, it was found that
the sick person had just passed away.

An account of a most unpleasant haunting is contributed by Mr. W. S.
Thompson, who vouches for the substantial accuracy of it, and also
furnishes the names of two men,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

still living, who attended the "station." We give it as it stands, with
the comment that some of the details seem to have been grossly
exaggerated by local raconteurs. In the year 1869 a ghost made its
presence manifest in the house of a Mr. M— in Co. Cavan. In the daytime
it resided in the chimney, but at night it left its quarters and
subjected the family to considerable annoyance. During the day they
could cook nothing, as showers of soot would be sent down the chimney on
top of every pot and pan that was placed on the fire. At night the
various members of the family would be dragged out of bed by the hair,
and pulled around the house. When anyone ventured to light a lamp it
would immediately be put out, while chairs and tables would be sent
dancing round the room. At last matters reached such a pitch that the
family found it impossible to remain any longer in the house. The night
before they left Mrs. M— was severely handled, and her boots left facing
the door as a gentle hint for her to be off. Before they departed some
of the neighbours went to the house, saw the ghost, and even described
to Mr.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thompson what they
had seen. According to one man it appeared in the shape of a human being
with a pig's head with long tusks. Another described it as a horse with
an elephant's head, and a headless man seated on its back. Finally a
"station" was held at the house by seven priests, at which all the
neighbours attended. The station commenced after sunset, and everything
in the house had to be uncovered, lest the evil spirit should find any
resting-place. A free passage was left out of the door into the street,
where many people were kneeling. About five minutes after the station
opened a rumbling noise was heard, and a black barrel rolled out with an
unearthly din, though to some coming up the street it appeared in the
shape of a black horse with a bull's head, and a headless man seated
thereon. From this time the ghost gave no further trouble.

The same gentleman also sends an account of a haunted shop in which
members of his family had some very unpleasant experiences. "In October
1882 my father, William Thompson, took over the grocery and spirit
business from a Dr. S— to whom it had

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

been left by will. My sister was put in charge of the business, and she
slept on the premises at night, but she was not there by herself very
long until she found things amiss. The third night matters were made so
unpleasant for her that she had to get up out of bed more dead than
alive, and go across the street to Mrs. M—, the servant at the R.I.C.
barrack, with whom she remained until the morning. She stated that as
she lay in bed, half awake and half asleep, she saw a man enter the
room, who immediately seized her by the throat and well-nigh choked her.
She had only sufficient strength left to gasp 'Lord, save me!' when
instantly the man vanished. She also said that she heard noises as if
every bottle and glass in the shop was smashed to atoms, yet in the
morning everything would be found intact. My brother was in charge of
the shop one day, as my sister had to go to Belturbet to do some
Christmas shopping. He expected her to return to the shop that night,
but as she did not do so he was preparing to go to bed about 1 A.M.,
when suddenly a terrible noise was heard. The light was extinguished,
and the tables and

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

chairs commenced to dance about the floor, and some of them struck him
on the shins. Upon this he left the house, declaring that he had seen
the Devil!" Possibly this ghost had been a rabid teetotaller in the
flesh, and continued to have a dislike to the publican's trade after he
had become discarnate. At any rate the present occupants, who follow a
different avocation, do not appear to be troubled.

Ghosts are no respecters of persons or places, and take up their
quarters where they are least expected. One can hardly imagine them
entering a R.I.C. barrack, and annoying the stalwart inmates thereof.
Yet more than one tale of a haunted police-barrack has been sent to
us—nay, in its proper place we shall relate the appearance of a deceased
member of the "Force," uniform and all! The following personal
experiences are contributed by an ex-R.I.C. constable, who requested
that all names should be suppressed. "The barrack of which I am about to
speak has now disappeared, owing to the construction of a new railway
line. It was a three-storey house, with large airy apartments and
splendid

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

accommodation. This particular night I was on guard. After the
constables had retired to their quarters I took my palliasse downstairs
to the day-room, and laid it on two forms alongside two six-foot tables
which were placed end to end in the centre of the room."

"As I expected a patrol in at midnight, and as another had to be sent
out when it arrived, I didn't promise myself a very restful night, so I
threw myself on the bed, intending to read a bit, as there was a large
lamp on the table. Scarcely had I commenced to read when I felt as if I
was being pushed off the bed. At first I thought I must have fallen
asleep, so to make sure, I got up, took a few turns around the room, and
then deliberately lay down again and took up my book. Scarcely had I
done so, when the same thing happened, and, though I resisted with all
my strength, I was finally landed on the floor. My bed was close to the
table, and the pushing came from that side, so that if anyone was
playing a trick on me they could not do so without being under the
table: I looked, but there was no visible presence there. I felt shaky,
but

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

changed my couch to another part of the room, and had no further
unpleasant experience. Many times after I was 'guard' in the same room,
but I always took care not to place my couch in that particular spot."

"One night, long afterwards, we were all asleep in the dormitory, when
we were awakened in the small hours of the morning by the guard rushing
upstairs, dashing through the room, and jumping into a bed in the
farthest corner behind its occupant. There he lay gasping, unable to
speak for several minutes, and even then we couldn't get a coherent
account of what befel him. It appears he fell asleep, and suddenly awoke
to find himself on the floor, and a body rolling over him. Several men
volunteered to go downstairs with him, but he absolutely refused to
leave the dormitory, and stayed there till morning. Nor would he even
remain downstairs at night without having a comrade with him. It ended
in his applying for an exchange of stations."

"Another time I returned off duty at midnight, and after my comrade, a
married Sergeant, had gone outside to his quarters I went to the kitchen
to change my boots.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There was a good
fire on, and it looked so comfortable that I remained toasting my toes
on the hob, and enjoying my pipe. The lock-up was a lean-to one-storey
building off the kitchen, and was divided into two cells, one opening
into the kitchen, the other into that cell. I was smoking away quietly
when I suddenly heard inside the lock-up a dull, heavy thud, just like
the noise a drunken man would make by crashing down on all-fours. I
wondered who the prisoner could be, as I didn't see anyone that night
who seemed a likely candidate for free lodgings. However as I heard no
other sound I decided I would tell the guard in order that he might look
after him. As I took my candle from the table I happened to glance at
the lock-up, and, to my surprise, I saw that the outer door was open. My
curiosity being roused, I looked inside, to find the inner door also
open. There was nothing in either cell, except the two empty plank-beds,
and these were immovable as they were firmly fixed to the walls. I
betook myself to my bedroom much quicker than I was in the habit of
doing."

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

"I mentioned that this barrack was demolished owing to the construction
of a new railway line. It was the last obstacle removed, and in the
meantime workmen came from all points of the compass. One day a powerful
navvy was brought into the barrack a total collapse from drink, and
absolutely helpless. After his neckwear was loosened he was carried to
the lock-up and laid on the plank-bed, the guard being instructed to
visit him periodically, lest he should smother. He was scarcely half an
hour there—this was in the early evening—when the most unmerciful
screaming brought all hands to the lock-up, to find the erstwhile
helpless man standing on the plank-bed, and grappling with a, to us,
invisible foe. We took him out, and he maintained that a man had tried
to choke him, and was still there when we came to his relief. The
strange thing was, that he was shivering with fright, and perfectly
sober, though in the ordinary course of events he would not be in that
condition for at least seven or eight hours. The story spread like
wildfire through the town, but the inhabitants were not in the least
surprised, and one old man

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

told us that many strange things happened in that house long before it
became a police-barrack."

A lady, who requests that her name be suppressed, relates a strange
sight seen by her sister in Galway. The latter's husband was stationed
in that town about seventeen years ago. One afternoon he was out, and
she was lying on a sofa in the drawing-room, when suddenly from behind a
screen (where there was no door) came a little old woman, with a small
shawl over her head and shoulders, such as the country women used to
wear. She had a most diabolical expression on her face. She seized the
lady by the hand, and said: "I will drag you down to Hell, where I am!"
The lady sprang up in terror and shook her off, when the horrible
creature again disappeared behind the screen. The house was an old one,
and many stories were rife amongst the people about it, the one most to
the point being that the apparition of an old woman, who was supposed to
have poisoned someone, used to be seen therein. Needless to say, the
lady in question never again sat by herself in the drawing-room.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

Two stories are told about haunted houses at Drogheda, the one by A. G.
Bradley in *Notes on some Irish Superstitions* (Drogheda, 1894), the
other by F. G. Lee in *Sights and Shadows* (p. 42) . As both appear to
be placed at the same date, *i.e.* 1890, it is quite possible that they
refer to one and the same haunting, and we have so treated them
accordingly. The reader, if he wishes, can test the matter for himself.

This house, which was reputed to be haunted, was let to a tailor and his
wife by the owner at an annual rent of £23. They took possession in due
course, but after a very few days they became aware of the presence of a
most unpleasant supernatural lodger. One night, as the tailor and his
wife were preparing to retire, they were terrified at seeing the foot of
some invisible person kick the candlestick off the table, and so quench
the candle. Although it was a very dark night, and the shutters were
closed, the man and his wife could see everything in the room just as
well as if it were the middle of the day. All at once a woman entered
the room, dressed in white, carrying something in her hand,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

which she threw at the tailor's wife, striking her with some violence,
and then vanished. While this was taking place on the first floor, a
most frightful noise was going on overhead in the room where the
children and their nurse were sleeping. The father immediately rushed
upstairs, and found to his horror the floor all torn up, the furniture
broken, and, worst of all, the children lying senseless and naked on the
bed, and having the appearance of having been severely beaten. As he was
leaving the room with the children in his arms he suddenly remembered
that he had not seen the nurse, so he turned back with the intention of
bringing her downstairs, but could find her nowhere. The girl, half-dead
with fright, and very much bruised, had fled to her mother's house,
where she died in a few days in agony.

Because of these occurrences they were legally advised to refuse to pay
any rent. The landlady, however, declining to release them from their
bargain, at once claimed a quarter's rent; and when this remained for
some time unpaid, sued them for it before Judge Kisby. A Drogheda
solicitor appeared

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

for the tenants, who, having given evidence of the facts concerning the
ghost in question, asked leave to support their sworn testimony by that
of several other people. This, however, was disallowed by the judge. It
was admitted by the landlady that nothing on one side or the other had
been said regarding the haunting when the house was let. A judgment was
consequently entered for the landlady, although it had been shown
indirectly that unquestionably the house had had the reputation of being
haunted, and that previous tenants had been much inconvenienced.

This chapter may be concluded with two stories dealing with haunted
rectories. The first, and mildest, of these is contributed by the
present Dean of St. Patrick's; it is not his own personal experience,
but was related to him by a rector in Co. Monaghan, where he used to
preach on special occasions. The rector and his daughters told the Dean
that they had often seen in that house the apparition of an old woman
dressed in a drab cape, while they frequently heard noises. On one
evening the rector was in the kitchen together with the cook and the
coachman.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All three heard
noises in the pantry as if vessels were being moved. Presently they saw
the old woman in the drab cape come out of the pantry and move up the
stairs. The rector attempted to follow her, but the two servants held
him tightly by the arms, and besought him not to do so. But hearing the
children, who were in bed, screaming, he broke from the grip of the
servants and rushed upstairs. The children said that they had been
frightened by seeing a strange old woman coming into the room, but she
was now gone. The house had a single roof, and there was no way to or
from the nursery except by the stairs. The rector stated that he took to
praying that the old woman might have rest, and that it was now many
years since she had been seen. A very old parishioner told him that when
she was young she remembered having seen an old woman answering to the
rector's description, who had lived in the house, which at that time was
not a rectory.

The second of these, which is decidedly more complex and mystifying,
refers to a rectory in Co. Donegal. It is sent as the personal
experience of one of the percipients,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

who does not wish to have his name disclosed. He says: "My wife,
children, and myself will have lived here four years next January
(1914). From the first night that we came into the house most
extraordinary noises have been heard. Sometimes they were inside the
house, and seemed as if the furniture was being disturbed, and the
fireirons knocked about, or at other times as if a dog was running up
and down stairs. Sometimes they were external, and resembled tin buckets
being dashed about the yard, or as if a herd of cattle was galloping up
the drive before the windows. These things would go on for six months,
and then everything would be quiet for three months or so, when the
noises would commence again. My dogs—a fox-terrier, a boar-hound, and a
spaniel—would make a terrible din, and would bark at something in the
hall we could not see, backing away from it all the time.

"The only thing that was ever *seen* was as follows: One night my
daughter went down to the kitchen about ten o'clock for some hot water.
She saw a tall man, with one arm, carrying a lamp, who walked out

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

of the pantry into the kitchen, and then through the kitchen wall.
Another daughter saw the same man walk down one evening from the loft,
and go into the harness-room. She told me, and I went out immediately,
but could see nobody. Shortly after that my wife, who is very brave,
heard a knock at the hall door in the dusk. Naturally thinking it was
some friend, she opened the door, and there saw standing outside the
self-same man. He simply looked at her, and walked through the wall into
the house. She got such a shock that she could not speak for several
hours, and was ill for some days. That is eighteen months ago, and he
has not been seen since, and it is six months since we heard any
noises." Our correspondent's letter was written on 25th November 1913.
"An old man nearly ninety died last year. He lived all his life within
four hundred yards of this house, and used to tell me that seventy years
ago the parsons came with bell, book, and candle to drive the ghosts out
of the house." Evidently they were unsuccessful. In English
ghost-stories it is the parson who performs the exorcism successfully,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

while in Ireland such work is generally performed by the priest. Indeed
a tale was sent to us in which a ghost quite ignored the parson's
efforts, but succumbed to the priest.
