### CHAPTER VIII

#### MISCELLANEOUS SUPERNORMAL EXPERIENCES

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> matter in this chapter does not seem,
strictly speaking, to come under the head of any of the preceding ones:
it contains no account of houses or places permanently haunted, or of
warnings of impending death. Rather we have gathered up in it a number
of tales relative to the appearance of the "wraiths" of living men, or
accounts of visions, strange apparitions, or extraordinary experiences;
some few of these have a purpose, while the majority are strangely
aimless and purposeless—something is seen or heard, that is all, and no
results, good or bad, follow.

We commence with one which, however, certainly indicates a purpose which
was fulfilled. It is the experience of Mrs. Seymour, wife to one of the
compilers. When she was a little girl she resided in Dublin; amongst the
members of the family was

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

her paternal grandmother. This old lady was not as kind as she might
have been to her grand-daughter, and consequently the latter was
somewhat afraid of her. In process of time the grandmother died. Mrs.
Seymour, who was then about eight years of age, had to pass the door of
the room where the death occurred in order to reach her own bedroom,
which was a flight higher up. Past this door the child used to fly in
terror with all possible speed. On one occasion, however, as she was
preparing to make the usual rush past, she distinctly felt a hand placed
on her shoulder, and became conscious of a voice saying, "Don't be
afraid, Mary!" From that day on the child never had the least feeling of
fear, and always walked quietly past the door.

The Rev. D. B. Knox sends a curious personal experience, which was
shared by him with three other people. He writes as follows: "Not very
long ago my wife and I were preparing to retire for the night. A niece,
who was in the house, was in her bedroom and the door was open. The maid
had just gone to her room. All four of us distinctly heard the heavy
step of a

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

man walking along the corridor, apparently in the direction of the
bathroom. We searched the whole house immediately, but no one was
discovered. Nothing untoward happened except the death of the maid's
mother about a fortnight later. It was a detached house, so that the
noise could not have been made by the neighbours."

In the following tale the "double" or "wraith" of a living man was seen
by three different people, one of whom, our correspondent, saw it
through a telescope. She writes: "In May 1883 the parish of A— was
vacant, so Mr. D—, the Diocesan Curate, used to come out to take service
on Sundays. One day there were two funerals to be taken, the one at a
graveyard some distance off, the other at A—churchyard. My brother was
at both, the far-off one being taken the first. The house we then lived
in looked down towards A—churchyard, which was about a quarter of a mile
away. From an upper window my sister and I saw *two* surpliced figures
going out to meet the coffin, and said, 'Why, there are two clergy!'
having supposed that there would be only Mr. D—. I,

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

being short-sighted, used a telescope, and saw the two surplices showing
between the people. But when my brother returned he said, 'A strange
thing has happened. Mr. D— and Mr. W— (curate of a neighbouring parish)
took the far-off funeral. I saw them both again at A—, but when I went
into the vestry I only saw Mr. W—. I asked where Mr. D— was, and he
replied that he had left immediately after the first funeral, as he had
to go to Kilkenny, and that he (Mr. W—) had come on *alone* to take the
funeral at A—.'"

Here is a curious tale from the city of Limerick of a lady's "double"
being seen, with no consequent results. It is sent by Mr. Richard Hogan
as the personal experience of his sister, Mrs. Mary Murnane. On
Saturday, October 25, 1913, at half-past four o'clock in the afternoon,
Mr. Hogan left the house in order to purchase some cigarettes. A quarter
of an hour afterwards Mrs. Murnane went down the town to do some
business. As she was walking down George Street she saw a group of four
persons standing on the pavement engaged in conversation. They were: her
brother,

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

a Mr. O’S—, and two ladies, a Miss P. O’D—, and her sister, Miss M.
O’D—. She recognised the latter, as her face was partly turned towards
her, and noted that she was dressed in a knitted coat, and light blue
hat, while in her left hand she held a bag or purse; the other lady's
back was turned towards her. As Mrs. Murnane was in a hurry to get her
business done she determined to pass them by without being noticed, but
a number of people coming in the opposite direction blocked the way, and
compelled her to walk quite close to the group of four; but they were so
intent on listening to what one lady was saying that they took no notice
of her. The speaker appeared to be Miss M. O’D—, and, though Mrs.
Murnane did not actually hear her *speak* as she passed her, yet from
their attitudes the other three seemed to be listening to what she was
saying, and she heard her *laugh* when right behind her—not the laugh of
her sister P.—and the laugh was repeated after she had left the group a
little behind.

So far there is nothing out of the common. When Mrs. Murnane returned to
her house

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

about an hour later she found her brother Richard there before her. She
casually mentioned to him how she had passed him and his three
companions on the pavement. To which he replied that she was quite
correct except in one point, namely that there were only *three* in the
group, as M. O’D— *was not present*, as she had not come to Limerick at
all that day. She then described to him the exact position each one of
the four occupied, and the clothes worn by them; to all of which facts
he assented, except as to the presence of Miss M. O’D—. Mrs. Murnane
adds, "That is all I can say in the matter, but most certainly the
fourth person was in the group, as I both saw and heard her. She wore
the same clothes I had seen on her previously, with the exception of the
hat; but the following Saturday she had on the same coloured hat I had
seen on her the previous Saturday. When I told her about it she was as
much mystified as I was and am. My brother stated that there was no
laugh from any of the three present."

Mrs. G. Kelly sends an experience of a "wraith," which seems in some
mysterious

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

way to have been conjured up in her mind by the description she had
heard, and then externalised. She writes: "About four years ago a
musical friend of ours was staying in the house. He and my husband were
playing and singing Dvorak's *Spectre's Bride*, a work which he had
studied with the composer himself. This music appealed very much to
both, and they were excited and enthusiastic over it. Our friend was
giving many personal reminiscences of Dvorak, and his method of
explaining the way he wanted his work done. I was sitting by, an
interested listener, for some time. On [getting](errata.htm#0.md) up at
last, and going into the drawing-room, I was startled and somewhat
frightened to find a man standing there in a shadowy part of the room. I
saw him distinctly, and could describe his appearance accurately. I
called out, and the two men ran in, but as the apparition only lasted
for a second, they were too late. I described the man whom I had seen,
whereupon our friend exclaimed, 'Why, that was Dvorak himself!' At that
time I had never seen a picture of Dvorak, but when our friend returned
to London he sent me one which I recognised

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

as the likeness of the man whom I had seen in our drawing-room."

A curious vision, a case of second sight, in which a quite unimportant
event, previously unknown, was revealed, is sent by the percipient, who
is a lady well known to both the compilers, and a life-long friend of
one of them. She says: "Last summer I sent a cow to the fair of
Limerick, a distance of about thirteen miles, and the men who took her
there the day before the fair left her in a paddock for the night close
to Limerick city. I awoke up very early next morning, and was fully
awake when I saw (not with my ordinary eyesight, but apparently *inside*
my head) a light, an intensely brilliant light, and in it I saw the back
gate being opened by a red-haired woman and the cow I had supposed in
the fair walking through the gate. I then knew that the cow must be
home, and going to the yard later on I was met by the wife of the man
who was in charge in a great state of excitement. 'Oh law! Miss,' she
exclaimed, 'you'll be mad! Didn't Julia \[a red-haired woman\] find the
cow outside the lodge gate as she was going out at 4 o'clock to the
milking!'

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That's my
tale—perfectly true, and I would give a good deal to be able to control
that light, and see more if I could."

Another curious vision was seen by a lady who is also a friend of both
the compilers. One night she was kneeling at her bedside saying her
prayers (hers was the only bed in the room), when suddenly she felt a
distinct touch on her shoulder. She turned round in the direction of the
touch and saw at the end of the room a bed, with a pale,
indistinguishable figure laid therein, and what appeared to be a
clergyman standing over it. About a week later she fell into a long and
dangerous illness.

An account of a dream which implied an extraordinary coincidence, if
coincidence it be and nothing more, was sent as follows by a
correspondent, who requested that no names be published. "That which I
am about to relate has a peculiar interest for me, inasmuch as the
central figure in it was my own grand-aunt, and moreover the principal
witness (if I may use such a term) was my father. At the period during
which this strange incident occurred my father was living with his aunt
and some other relatives.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

"One morning at the breakfast-table, my grand-aunt announced that she
had had a most peculiar dream during the previous night. My father, who
was always very interested in that kind of thing, took down in his
notebook all the particulars concerning it. They were as follows.

"My grand-aunt dreamt that she was in a cemetery, which she recognised
as Glasnevin, and as she gazed at the memorials of the dead which lay so
thick around, one stood out most conspicuously, and caught her eye, for
she saw clearly cut on the cold white stone *an inscription bearing her
own name:*

CLARE • S • D—

Died 14<sup>th</sup> of March, 1873

Dearly loved and ever mourned.

R•I•P•

while, to add to the peculiarity of it, the date on the stone as given
above was, from the day of her dream, exactly a year in advance.

"My grand-aunt was not very nervous, and soon the dream faded from her
mind. Months rolled by, and one morning at

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

breakfast it was noticed that my grand-aunt had not appeared, but as she
was a very religious woman it was thought that she had gone out to
church. However, as she did not appear my father sent someone to her
room to see if she were there, and as no answer was given to repeated
knocking the door was opened, and my grand-aunt was found kneeling at
her bedside, dead. The day of her death was March 14, 1873,
corresponding exactly with the date seen in her dream a twelvemonth
before. My grand-aunt was buried in Glasnevin, and on her tombstone (a
white marble slab) was placed the inscription which she had read in her
dream." Our correspondent sent us a photograph of the stone and its
inscription.

The present Archdeacon of Limerick, Ven. J. A. Haydn, LL.D., sends the
following experience: "In the year 1870 I was rector of the little rural
parish of Chapel Russell. One autumn day the rain fell with a quiet,
steady, and hopeless persistence from morning to night. Wearied at
length from the gloom, and tired of reading and writing, I determined to
walk

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

to the church about half a mile away, and pass a half-hour playing the
harmonium, returning for the lamp-light and tea.

"I wrapped up, put the key of the church in my pocket, and started.
Arriving at the church, I walked up the straight avenue, bordered with
graves and tombs on either side, while the soft, steady rain quietly
pattered on the trees. When I reached the church door, before putting
the key in the lock, moved by some indefinable impulse, I stood on the
doorstep, turned round, and looked back upon the path I had just
trodden. My amazement may be imagined when I saw, seated on a low,
tabular tombstone close to the avenue, a lady with her back towards me.
She was wearing a black velvet jacket or short cape, with a narrow
border of vivid white: her head, and luxuriant jet-black hair, were
surmounted by a hat of the shape and make that I think used to be called
at that time a "turban"; it was also of black velvet, with a snow-white
wing or feather at the right-hand side of it. It may be seen how
deliberately and minutely I observed the

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

appearance, when I can thus recall it after more than forty years.

"Actuated by a desire to attract the attention of the lady, and induce
her to look towards me, I noisily inserted the key in the door, and
suddenly opened it with a rusty crack. Turning round to see the effect
of my policy—the lady was gone!—vanished! Not yet daunted, I hurried to
the place, which was not ten paces away, and closely searched the stone
and the space all round it, but utterly in vain; there were absolutely
no traces of the late presence of a human being! I may add that nothing
particular or remarkable followed the singular apparition, and that I
never heard anything calculated to throw any light on the mystery."

Here is a story of a ghost who knew what it wanted—and got it! "In the
part of Co. Wicklow from which my people come," writes a Miss D—, "there
was a family who were not exactly related, but of course of the clan.
Many years ago a young daughter, aged about twenty, died. Before her
death she had directed her parents to bury her in a certain graveyard.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But for some
reason they did not do so, and from that hour she gave them no peace.
She appeared to them at all hours, especially when they went to the well
for water. So distracted were they, that at length they got permission
to exhume the remains and have them reinterred in the desired graveyard.
This they did by torchlight—a weird scene truly! I can vouch for the
truth of this latter portion, at all events, as some of my own relatives
were present."

Mr. T. J. Westropp contributes a tale of a ghost of an unusual type,
*i.e.* one which actually did communicate matters of importance to his
family. A lady who related many ghost stories to me, also told me how,
after her father's death, the family could not find some papers or
receipts of value. One night she awoke, and heard a sound which she at
once recognised as the footsteps of her father, who was lame. The door
creaked, and she prayed that she might be able to see him. Her prayer
was granted: she saw him distinctly holding a yellow parchment book tied
with tape. 'F—, child,' said he, 'this is the book

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

your mother is looking for. It is in the third drawer of the cabinet
near the cross-door; tell your mother to be more careful in future about
business papers.' Incontinent he vanished, and she at once awoke her
mother, in whose room she was sleeping, who was very angry and ridiculed
the story, but the girl's earnestness at length impressed her. She got
up, went to the old cabinet, and at once found the missing book in the
third drawer."

Here is another tale of an equally useful and obliging ghost. "A
gentleman, a relative of my own," writes a lady, "often received
warnings from his dead father of things that were about to happen.
Besides the farm on which he lived, he had another some miles away which
adjoined a large demesne. Once in a great storm a fir-tree was blown
down in the demesne, and fell into his field. The woodranger came to him
and told him he might as well cut up the tree, and take it away.
Accordingly one day he set out for this purpose, taking with him two men
and a cart. He got into the fields by a stile, while his men went on to
a gate. As he [approached](errata.htm#1.md) a

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

gap between two fields he saw, standing in it, his father as plainly as
he ever saw him in life, and beckoning him back warningly. Unable to
understand this, he still advanced, whereupon his father looked very
angry, and his gestures became imperious. This induced him to turn away,
so he sent his men home, and left the tree uncut. He subsequently
discovered that a plot had been laid by the woodranger, who coveted his
farm, and who hoped to have him dispossessed by accusing him of stealing
the tree."

A clergyman in the diocese of Clogher gave a personal experience of
table-turning to the present Dean of St. Patrick's, who kindly sent the
same to the writer. He said: "When I was a young man, I met some friends
one evening, and we decided to amuse ourselves with table-turning. The
local dispensary was vacant at the time, so we said that if the table
would work we should ask who would be appointed as medical officer. As
we sat round it touching it with our hands it began to knock. We said:

"'Who are you?'

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

"The table spelt out the name of a Bishop of the Church of Ireland. We
asked, thinking that the answer was absurd, as we knew him to be alive
and well:

"'Are you dead?'

"The table answered 'Yes.'

"We laughed at this and asked:

"'Who will be appointed to the dispensary?'

"The table spelt out the name of a stranger, who was not one of the
candidates, whereupon we left off, thinking that the whole thing was
nonsense.

"The next morning I saw in the papers that the Bishop in question had
died that afternoon about two hours before our meeting, and a few days
afterwards I saw the name of the stranger as the new dispensary doctor.
I got such a shock that I determined never to have anything to do with
table-turning again."

The following extraordinary personal experience is sent by a lady, well
known to the present writer, but who requests that all names be omitted.
Whatever explanation we may give of it, the good faith of the tale is
beyond doubt.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

"Two or three months after my father-in-law's death my husband, myself,
and three small sons lived in the west of Ireland. As my husband was a
young barrister, he had to be absent from home a good deal. My three
boys slept in my bedroom, the eldest being about four, the youngest some
months. A fire was kept up every night, and with a young child to look
after, I was naturally awake more than once during the night. For many
nights I believed I distinctly saw my father-in-law sitting by the
fireside. This happened, not once or twice, but many times. He was
passionately fond of his eldest grandson, who lay sleeping calmly in his
cot. Being so much alone probably made me restless and uneasy, though I
never felt *afraid*. I mentioned this strange thing to a friend who had
known and liked my father-in-law, and she advised me to 'have his soul
laid,' as she termed it. Though I was a Protestant and she was a Roman
Catholic (as had also been my father-in-law), yet I fell in with her
suggestion. She told me to give a coin to the next beggar that came to
the house, telling him (or her) to pray for the rest of Mr. So-and-so's
soul. A few days later

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

a beggar-woman and her children came to the door, to whom I gave a coin
and stated my desire. To my great surprise I learned from her manner
that such requests were not unusual. Well, she went down on her knees on
the steps, and prayed with apparent earnestness and devotion that his
soul might find repose. Once again he appeared, and seemed to say to me,
'Why did you do that, E—? To come and sit here was the only comfort I
had.' Never again did he appear, and strange to say, after a lapse of
more than thirty years I have felt regret at my selfishness in
interfering.

"After his death, as he lay in the house awaiting burial, and I was in a
house some ten miles away, I thought that he came and told me that I
would have a hard life, which turned out only too truly. I was then
young, and full of life, with every hope of a prosperous future."

Of all the strange beliefs to be found in Ireland that in the Black Dog
is the most widespread. There is hardly a parish in the country but
could contribute some tale relative to this spectre, though the majority
of these are short, and devoid of interest.

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There is said to
be such a dog just outside the avenue gate of Donohill Rectory, but
neither of the compilers have had the good luck to see it. It may be, as
some hold, that this animal was originally a cloud or nature-myth; at
all events, it has now descended to the level of an ordinary haunting.
The most circumstantial story that we have met with relative to the
Black Dog is that related as follows by a clergyman of the Church of
Ireland, who requests us to refrain from publishing his name.

"In my childhood I lived in the country. My father, in addition to his
professional duties, sometimes did a little farming in an amateurish
sort of way. He did not keep a regular staff of labourers, and
consequently when anything extra had to be done, such as hay-cutting or
harvesting, he used to employ day-labourers to help with the work. At
such times I used to enjoy being in the fields with the men, listening
to their conversation. On one occasion I heard a labourer remark that he
had once seen the devil! Of course I was interested and asked him to
give me his experience. He said he was walking along a certain road,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

and when he came to a point where there was an entrance to a private
place (the spot was well known to me), he saw a black dog sitting on the
roadside. At the time he paid no attention to it, thinking it was an
ordinary retriever, but after he had passed on about two or three
hundred yards he found the dog was beside him, and then he noticed that
its eyes were blood-red. He stooped down, and picked up some stones in
order to frighten it away, but though he threw the stones at it they did
not injure it, nor indeed did they seem to have any effect. Suddenly,
after a few moments, the dog vanished from his sight.

"Such was the labourer's tale. After some years, during which time I had
forgotten altogether about the man's story, some friends of my own
bought the place at the entrance to which the apparition had been seen.
When my friends went to reside there I was a constant visitor at their
house. Soon after their arrival they began to be troubled by the
appearance of a black dog. Though I never saw it myself, it appeared to
many members of the family. The avenue leading to the house was a long
one,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

and it was customary for the dog to appear and accompany people for the
greater portion of the way. Such an effect had this on my friends that
they soon gave up the house, and went to live elsewhere. This was a
curious corroboration of the labourer's tale."

As we have already stated in Chapter VII, a distinction must be drawn
between the so-called *Headless* Coach, which portends death, and the
*Phantom* Coach, which appears to be a harmless sort of vehicle. With
regard to the latter we give two tales below, the first of which was
sent by a lady whose father was a clergyman, and a gold medallist of
Trinity College, Dublin.

"Some years ago my family lived in Co. Down. Our house was some way out
of a fair-sized manufacturing town, and had a short avenue which ended
in a gravel sweep in front of the hall door. One winter's evening, when
my father was returning from a sick call, a carriage going at a sharp
pace passed him on the avenue. He hurried on, thinking it was some
particular friends, but when he reached the door no carriage was to be
seen, so he concluded it must have

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

gone round to the stables. The servant who answered his ring said that
no visitors had been there, and he, feeling certain that the girl had
made some mistake, or that some one else had answered the door, came
into the drawing-room to make further inquiries. No visitors had come,
however, though those sitting in the drawing-room had also heard the
carriage drive up.

"My father was most positive as to what he had seen, viz. a closed
carriage with lamps lit; and let me say at once that he was a clergyman
who was known throughout the whole of the north of Ireland as a most
level-headed man, and yet to the day of his death he would insist that
he met that carriage on our avenue.

"One day in July one of our servants was given leave to go home for the
day, but was told she must return by a certain train. For some reason
she did not come by it, but by a much later one, and rushed into the
kitchen in a most penitent frame of mind. 'I am so sorry to be late,'
she told the cook, 'especially as there were visitors. I suppose they
stayed to supper, as they were so late going away, for I met

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

the carriage on the avenue.' The cook thereupon told her that no one had
been at the house, and hinted that she must have seen the
ghost-carriage, a statement that alarmed her very much, as the story was
well known in the town, and car-drivers used to whip up their horses as
they passed our gate, while pedestrians refused to go at all except in
numbers. We have often *heard* the carriage, but these are the only two
occasions on which I can positively assert that it was *seen*."

The following personal experience of the phantom coach was given to the
present writer by Mr. Matthias Fitzgerald, coachman to Miss Cooke, of
Cappagh House, Co. Limerick. He stated that one moonlight night he was
driving along the road from Askeaton to Limerick when he heard coming up
behind him the roll of wheels, the clatter of horses’ hoofs, and the
jingling of the bits. He drew over to his own side to let this carriage
pass, but nothing passed. He then looked back, but could see nothing,
the road was perfectly bare and empty, though the sounds were perfectly
audible. This continued for about a quarter of an

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

hour or so, until he came to a cross-road, down one arm of which he had
to turn. As he turned off he heard the phantom carriage dash by rapidly
along the straight road. He stated that other persons had had similar
experiences on the same road.
