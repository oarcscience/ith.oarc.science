### CHAPTER III

#### HAUNTED HOUSES IN MOGH'S HALF

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> northern half of Ireland has not
proved as prolific in stories of haunted houses as the southern portion:
the possible explanation of this is, not that the men of the north are
less prone to hold, or talk about, such beliefs, but that, as regards
the south half, we have had the good fortune to happen upon some
diligent collectors of these and kindred tales, whose eagerness in
collecting is only equalled by their kindness in imparting information
to the compilers of this book.

On a large farm near Portarlington there once lived a Mrs.—, a
strong-minded, capable woman, who managed all her affairs for herself,
giving her orders, and taking none from anybody. In due time she died,
and the property passed to the next-of-kin. As soon, however, as the
funeral was over, the house was nightly disturbed by strange noises:
people downstairs would hear rushings

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

about in the upper rooms, banging of doors, and the sound of heavy
footsteps. The cups and saucers used to fall off the dresser, and all
the pots and pans would rattle.

This went on for some time, till the people could stand it no longer, so
they left the house and put in a herd and his family. The latter was
driven away after he had been in the house a few weeks. This happened to
several people, until at length a man named Mr. B— took the house. The
noises went on as before until some one suggested getting the priest in.
Accordingly the priest came, and held a service in the late Mrs. —’s
bedroom. When this was over, the door of the room was locked. After that
the noises were not heard till one evening Mr. B— came home from a fair,
fortified, no doubt, with a little "Dutch courage," and declared that
even if the devil were in it he would go into the locked room. In spite
of all his family could say or do, he burst open the door, and entered
the room, but apparently saw nothing. That night pandemonium reigned in
the house, the chairs were hurled about, the china was

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

broken, and the most weird and uncanny sounds were heard. Next day the
priest was sent for, the room again shut up, and nothing has happened
from that day to this.

Another strange story comes from the same town. "When I was on a visit
to a friend in Portarlington," writes a lady in the *Journal* of the
American S.P.R. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) "a rather unpleasant
incident occurred to me. At about two o'clock in the morning I woke up
suddenly, for apparently no reason whatever; however, I quite distinctly
heard snoring coming from under or in the bed in which I was lying. It
continued for about ten minutes, during which time I was absolutely limp
with fright. The door opened, and my friend entered the bedroom, saying,
'I thought you might want me, so I came in.' Needless to say, I hailed
the happy inspiration that sent her to me. I then told her what I had
heard; she listened to me, and then to comfort (!) me said, 'Oh, never
mind; *it is only grandfather!* He died in this room, and a snoring is
heard every night at two o'clock, the hour at which he passed away.'
Some time previously a German

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

gentleman was staying with this family. They asked him in the morning
how he had slept, and he replied that he was disturbed by a snoring in
the room, but he supposed it was the cat."

A lady, formerly resident in Queen's Co., but who now lives near Dublin,
sends the following clear and concise account of her own personal
experiences in a haunted house: "Some years ago, my father, mother,
sister, and myself went to live in a nice but rather small house close
to the town of — in Queen's Co. We liked the house, as it was
conveniently and pleasantly situated, and we certainly never had a
thought of ghosts or haunted houses, nor would my father allow any talk
about such things in his presence. But we were not long settled there
when we were disturbed by the opening of the parlour door every night
regularly at the hour of eleven o'clock. My father and mother used to
retire to their room about ten o'clock, while my sister and I used to
sit up reading. We always declared that we would retire before the door
opened, but we generally got so interested in our books that we would
forget until we would hear the handle of

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the door turn, and see the door flung open. We tried in every way to
account for this, but we could find no explanation, and there was no
possibility of any human agent being at work.

"Some time after, light was thrown on the subject. We had visitors
staying with us, and in order to make room for them, my sister was asked
to sleep in the parlour. She consented without a thought of ghosts, and
went to sleep quite happily; but during the night she was awakened by
some one opening the door, walking across the room, and disturbing the
fireirons. She, supposing it to be the servant, called her by name, but
got no answer: then the person seemed to come away from the fireplace,
and walk out of the room. There was a fire in the grate, but though she
heard the footsteps, she could see no one.

"The next thing was, that I was coming downstairs, and as I glanced
towards the hall door I saw standing by it a man in a grey suit. I went
to my father and told him. He asked in surprise who let him in, as the
servant was out, and he himself had already locked, bolted, and chained
the door

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

an hour previously. None of us had let him in, and when my father went
out to the hall the man had disappeared, and the door was as he had left
it.

"Some little time after, I had a visit from a lady who knew the place
well, and in the course of conversation she said:

"'This is the house poor Mr. — used to live in.'

"'Who is Mr. —?' I asked.

"'Did you never hear of him?' she replied. 'He was a minister who used
to live in this house quite alone, and was murdered in this very
parlour. His landlord used to visit him sometimes, and one night he was
seen coming in about eleven o'clock, and was seen again leaving about
five o'clock in the morning. When Mr. — did not come out as usual, the
door was forced open, and he was found lying dead in this room by the
fender, with his head battered in with the poker.'

"We left the house soon after," adds our informant.

The following weird incidents occurred, apparently in the Co. Kilkenny,
to a Miss K. B., during two visits paid by her to

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ireland in 1880
and 1881. The house in which she experienced the following was really an
old barrack, long disused, very old-fashioned, and surrounded with a
high wall: it was said that it had been built during the time of
Cromwell as a stronghold for his men. The only inhabitants of this were
Captain C— (a retired officer in charge of the place), Mrs. C—, three
daughters, and two servants. They occupied the central part of the
building, the mess-room being their drawing-room. Miss K. B.’s bedroom
was very lofty, and adjoined two others which were occupied by the three
daughters, E., G., and L.

"The first recollection I have of anything strange," writes Miss B.,
"was that each night I was awakened about three o'clock by a tremendous
noise, apparently in the next suite of rooms, which was empty, and it
sounded as if some huge iron boxes and other heavy things were being
thrown about with great force. This continued for about half an hour,
when in the room underneath (the kitchen) I heard the fire being
violently poked and raked for several minutes, and this was immediately
followed by a most

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

terrible and distressing cough of a man, very loud and violent. It
seemed as if the exertion had brought on a paroxysm which he could not
stop. In large houses in Co. Kilkenny the fires are not lighted every
day, owing to the slow-burning property of the coal, and it is only
necessary to rake it up every night about eleven o'clock, and in the
morning it is still bright and clear. Consequently I wondered why it was
necessary for Captain C— to get up in the middle of the night to stir it
so violently."

A few days later Miss B. said to E. C.: "I hear such strange noises
every night—are there any people in the adjoining part of the building?"
She turned very pale, and looking earnestly at Miss B., said, "Oh K., I
am so sorry you heard. I hoped no one but myself had heard it. I could
have given worlds to have spoken to you last night, but dared not move
or speak." K. B. laughed at her for being so superstitious, but E.
declared that the place was haunted, and told her of a number of weird
things that had been seen and heard.

In the following year, 1881, Miss K. B. paid another visit to the
barrack. This

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

time there were two other visitors there—a colonel and his wife. They
occupied Miss B.’s former room, while to her was allotted a huge bedroom
on the top of the house, with a long corridor leading to it; opposite to
this was another large room, which was occupied by the girls.

Her strange experiences commenced again. "One morning, about four
o'clock, I was awakened by a very noisy martial footstep ascending the
stairs, and then marching quickly up and down the corridor outside my
room. Then suddenly the most violent coughing took place that I ever
heard, which continued for some time, while the quick, heavy step
continued its march. At last the footsteps faded away in the distance,
and I then recalled to mind the same coughing after exertion last year."
In the morning, at breakfast, she asked both Captain C— and the colonel
had they been walking about, but both denied, and also said they had no
cough. The family looked very uncomfortable, and afterwards E. came up
with tears in her eyes, and said, "Oh K., please don't say anything more
about that dreadful coughing; we all hear it often, especially

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

when anything terrible is about to happen."

Some nights later the C—s gave a dance. When the guests had departed,
Miss B. went to her bedroom. "The moon was shining so beautifully that I
was able to read my Bible by its light, and had left the Bible open on
the window-sill, which was a very high one, and on which I sat to read,
having had to climb the washstand to reach it. I went to bed, and fell
asleep, but was not long so when I was suddenly awakened by the strange
feeling that some one was in the room. I opened my eyes, and turned
around, and saw on the window-sill in the moonlight a long, very thin,
very dark figure bending over the Bible, and apparently earnestly
scanning the page. As if my movement disturbed the figure, it suddenly
darted up, jumped off the window-ledge on to the washstand, then to the
ground, and flitted quietly across the room to the table where my
jewellery was." That was the last she saw of it. She thought it was some
one trying to steal her jewellery, so waited till morning, but nothing
was missing. In the morning she described to one of the daughters,

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> G., what she had
seen, and the latter told her that something always happened when that
appeared. Miss K. B. adds that nothing did happen. Later on she was told
that a colonel had cut his throat in that very room.

Another military station, Charles Fort, near Kinsale, has long had the
reputation of being haunted. An account of this was sent to the *Wide
World Magazine* (Jan. 1908), by Major H. L. Ruck Keene, D.S.O.; he
states that he took it from a manuscript written by a Captain Marvell
Hull about the year 1880. Further information on the subject of the
haunting is to be found in Dr. Craig's *Real Pictures of Clerical Life
in Ireland*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)\*

Charles Fort was erected in 1667 by the Duke of Ormonde. It is said to
be haunted by a ghost known as the "White Lady," and the traditional
account of the reason for this haunting is briefly as follows: Shortly
after the erection of the fort, a Colonel Warrender, a severe
disciplinarian, was appointed its governor. He had a daughter, who bore
the quaint Christian name of

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Wilful"; she
became engaged to a Sir Trevor Ashurst, and subsequently married him. On
the evening of their wedding-day the bride and bridegroom were walking
on the battlements, when she espied some flowers growing on the rocks
beneath. She expressed a wish for them, and a sentry posted close by
volunteered to climb down for them, provided Sir Trevor took his place
during his absence. He assented, and took the soldier's coat and musket
while he went in search of a rope. Having obtained one, he commenced his
descent; but the task proving longer than he expected, Sir Trevor fell
asleep. Meantime the governor visited the sentries, as was his custom,
and in the course of his rounds came to where Sir Trevor was asleep. He
challenged him, and on receiving no answer perceived that he was asleep,
whereupon he drew a pistol and shot him through the heart. The body was
brought in, and it was only then the governor realised what had
happened. The bride, who appears to have gone indoors before the tragedy
occurred, then learned the fate that befell her husband, and in her
distraction, rushed from the house and flung herself

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

over the battlements. In despair at the double tragedy, her father shot
himself during the night.

The above is from Dr. Craig's book already alluded to. In the *Wide
World Magazine* the legend differs slightly in details. According to
this the governor's name was Browne, and it was his own son, not his
son-in-law, that he shot; while the incident is said to have occurred
about a hundred and fifty years ago.

The "White Lady" is the ghost of the young bride. Let us see what
accounts there are of her appearance. A good many years ago Fort-Major
Black, who had served in the Peninsular War, gave his own personal
experience to Dr. Craig. He stated that he had gone to the hall door one
summer evening, and saw a lady entering the door and going up the
stairs. At first he thought she was an officer's wife, but as he looked,
he observed she was dressed in white, and in a very old-fashioned style.
Impelled by curiosity, he hastened upstairs after her, and followed her
closely into one of the rooms, but on entering it he could not find the
slightest trace of anyone there. On

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

another occasion he stated that two sergeants were packing some cast
stores. One of them had his little daughter with him, and the child
suddenly exclaimed, "Who is that white lady who is bending over the
banisters, and looking down at us?" The two men looked up, but could see
nothing, but the child insisted that she had seen a lady in white
looking down and smiling at her.

On another occasion a staff officer, a married man, was residing in the
"Governor's House." One night as the nurse lay awake—she and the
children were in a room which opened into what was known as the White
Lady's apartment—she suddenly saw a lady clothed in white glide to the
bedside of the youngest child, and after a little place her hand upon
its wrist. At this the child started in its sleep, and cried out, "Oh!
take that cold hand from my wrist!" the next moment the lady
disappeared.

One night, about the year 1880, Captain Marvell Hull and Lieutenant
Hartland were going to the rooms occupied by the former officer. As they
reached a small landing they saw distinctly in front of them a woman in
a white dress. As they stood

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

there in awestruck silence she turned and looked towards them, showing a
face beautiful enough, but colourless as a corpse, and then passed on
through a locked door.

But it appears that this presence did not always manifest itself in as
harmless a manner. Some years ago Surgeon L— was quartered at the fort.
One day he had been out snipe-shooting, and as he entered the fort the
mess-bugle rang out. He hastened to his rooms to dress, but as he failed
to put in an appearance at mess, one of the officers went in search of
him, and found him lying senseless on the floor. When he recovered
consciousness he related his experience. He said he had stooped down for
the key of his door, which he had placed for safety under the mat; when
in this position he felt himself violently dragged across the hall, and
flung down a flight of steps. With this agrees somewhat the experience
of a Captain Jarves, as related by him to Captain Marvell Hull.
Attracted by a strange rattling noise in his bedroom, he endeavoured to
open the door of it, but found it seemingly locked. Suspecting a hoax,
he called out, whereupon a gust of wind passed him, and some unseen

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

power flung him down the stairs, and laid him senseless at the bottom.

Near a seaside town in the south of Ireland a group of small cottages
was built by an old lady, in one of which she lived, while she let the
others to her relatives. In process of time all the occupants died, the
cottages fell into ruin, and were all pulled down (except the one in
which the old lady had lived), the materials being used by a farmer to
build a large house which he hoped to let to summer visitors. It was
shortly afterwards taken for three years by a gentleman for his family.
It should be noted that the house had very bare surroundings; there were
no trees near, or outhouses where people could be concealed. Soon after
the family came to the house they began to hear raps all over it, on
doors, windows, and walls; these raps varied in nature, sometimes being
like a sledgehammer, loud and dying away, and sometimes quick and sharp,
two or three or five in succession; and all heard them. One morning
about 4. A.M., the mother heard very loud knocking on the bedroom door;
thinking it was the servant wanting to go

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

to early mass, she said, "Come in," but the knocking continued till the
father was awakened by it; he got up, searched the house, but could find
no one. The servant's door was slightly open, and he saw that she was
sound asleep. That morning a telegram came announcing the death of a
beloved uncle just about the hour of the knocking. Some time previous to
this the mother was in the kitchen, when a loud explosion took place
beside her, startling her very much, but no cause for it could be found,
nor were any traces left. This coincided with the death of an aunt, wife
to the uncle who died later.

One night the mother went to her bedroom. The blind was drawn, and the
shutters closed, when suddenly a great crash came, as if a branch was
thrown at the window, and there was a sound of broken glass. She opened
the shutters with the expectation of finding the window smashed, but
there was not even a crack in it. She entered the room next day at one
o'clock, and the same crash took place, being heard by all in the house:
she went in at 10 A.M. on another day, and the same thing happened,

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

after which she refused to enter that room again.

Another night, after 11 P.M., the servant was washing up in the kitchen,
when heavy footsteps were heard by the father and mother going upstairs,
and across a lobby to the servant's room; the father searched the house,
but could find no one. After that footsteps used to be heard regularly
at that hour, though no one could ever be seen walking about.

The two elder sisters slept together, and used to see flames shooting up
all over the floor, though there was no smell or heat; this used to be
seen two or three nights at a time, chiefly in the one room. The first
time the girls saw this one of them got up and went to her father in
alarm, naturally thinking the room underneath must be on fire.

The two boys were moved to the haunted room \[which one?\], where they
slept in one large bed with its head near the chimney-piece. The elder
boy, aged about thirteen, put his watch on the mantelpiece, awoke about
2 A.M., and wishing to ascertain the time, put his hand up for his
watch; he

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

then felt a deathly cold hand laid on his. For the rest of that night
the two boys were terrified by noises, apparently caused by two people
rushing about the room fighting and knocking against the bed. About 6
A.M. they went to their father, almost in hysterics from terror, and
refused to sleep there again. The eldest sister, not being nervous, was
then given that room; she was, however, so disturbed by these noises
that she begged her father to let her leave it, but having no other room
to give her, he persuaded her to stay there, and at length she got
accustomed to the noise, and could sleep in spite of it. Finally the
family left the house before their time was up. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

Mr T. J. Westropp, to whom we are indebted for so much material, sends a
tale which used to be related by a relative of his, the Rev. Thomas
Westropp, concerning experiences in a house not very far from the city
of Limerick. When the latter was appointed to a certain parish he had
some difficulty in finding a suitable house, but finally fixed on one
which had been untenanted for many years, but had nevertheless

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

been kept aired and in good repair, as a caretaker who lived close by
used to come and look after it every day. The first night that the
family settled there, as the clergyman was going upstairs he heard a
footstep and the rustle of a dress, and as he stood aside a lady passed
him, entered a door facing the stairs, and closed it after her. It was
only then he realised that her dress was very old-fashioned, and that he
had not been able to enter that particular room. Next day he got
assistance from a carpenter, who, with another man, forced open the
door. A mat of cobwebs fell as they did so, and the floor and windows
were thick with dust. The men went across the room, and as the clergyman
followed them he saw a small white bird flying round the ceiling; at his
exclamation the men looked back and also saw it. It swooped, flew out of
the door, and they did not see it again. After that the family were
alarmed by hearing noises under the floor of that room every night. At
length the clergyman had the boards taken up, and the skeleton of a
child was found underneath. So old did the remains appear that the
coroner did not deem it

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

necessary to hold an inquest on them, so the rector buried them in the
churchyard. Strange noises continued, as if some one were trying to
force up the boards from underneath. Also a heavy ball was heard rolling
down the stairs and striking against the study door. One night the two
girls woke up screaming, and on the nurse running up to them, the elder
said she had seen a great black dog with fiery eyes resting its paws on
her bed. Her father ordered the servants to sit constantly with them in
the evenings, but, notwithstanding the presence of two women in the
nursery, the same thing occurred. The younger daughter was so scared
that she never quite recovered. The family left the house immediately.

The same correspondent says; "An old ruined house in the hills of east
Co. Clare enjoyed the reputation of being 'desperately haunted' from, at
any rate, 1865 down to its dismantling. I will merely give the
experiences of my own relations, as told by them to me. My mother told
how one night she and my father heard creaking and grating, as if a door
were being forced open. The sound came from a passage in which

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

was a door nailed up and clamped with iron bands. A heavy footstep came
down the passage, and stopped at the bedroom door for a moment; no sound
was heard, and then the 'thing' came through the room to the foot of the
bed. It moved round the bed, they not daring to stir. The horrible
unseen visitant stopped, and they *felt* it watching them. At last it
moved away, they heard it going up the passage, the door crashed, and
all was silence. Lighting a candle, my father examined the room, and
found the door locked; he then went along the passage, but not a sound
was to be heard anywhere.

"Strange noises like footsteps, sobbing, whispering, grim laughter, and
shrieks were often heard about the house. On one occasion my eldest
sister and a girl cousin drove over to see the family and stayed the
night. They and my two younger sisters were all crowded into a huge,
old-fashioned bed, and carefully drew and tucked in the curtains all
round. My eldest sister awoke feeling a cold wind blowing on her face,
and putting out her hand found the curtains drawn back and, as they
subsequently discovered, wedged

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

between the bed and the wall. She reached for the match-box, and was
about to light the candle when a horrible mocking laugh rang out close
to the bed, which awakened the other girls. Being always a plucky woman,
though then badly scared, she struck a match, and searched the room, but
nothing was to be seen. The closed room was said to have been deserted
after a murder, and its floor was supposed to be stained with blood
which no human power could wash out."

Another house in Co. Clare, nearer the estuary of the Shannon, which was
formerly the residence of the D— family, but is now pulled down, had
some extraordinary tales told about it in which facts (if we may use the
word) were well supplemented by legend. To commence with the former. A
lady writes: "My father and old Mr. D— were first cousins. Richard D—
asked my father would he come and sit up with him. one night, in order
to see what might be seen. Both were particularly sober men. The
annoyances in the house were becoming unbearable. Mrs. D—’s work-box
used to be thrown down, the table-cloth would be

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

whisked off the table, the fender and fireirons would be hurled about
the room, and other similar things would happen. Mr. D— and my father
went up to one of the bedrooms, where a big fire was made up. They
searched every part of the room carefully, but nothing uncanny was to be
seen or found. They then placed two candles and a brace of pistols on a
small table between them, and waited. Nothing happened for some time,
till all of a sudden a large black dog walked out from under the bed.
Both men fired, and the dog disappeared. That is all! The family had to
leave the house."

Now to the blending of fact with fiction, of which we have already
spoken: the intelligent reader can decide in his own mind which is
which. It was said that black magic had been practised in this house at
one time, and that in consequence terrible and weird occurrences were
quite the order of the day there. When being cooked, the hens used to
scream and the mutton used to bleat in the pot. Black dogs were seen
frequently. The beds used to be lifted up, and the occupants thereof
used to be beaten black and blue, by invisible

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

hands. One particularly ghoulish tale was told. It was said that a monk
(!) was in love with one of the daughters of the house, who was an
exceedingly fat girl. She died unmarried, and was buried in the family
vault. Some time later the vault was again opened for an interment, and
those who entered it found that Miss D—’s coffin had been disturbed, and
the lid loosened. They then saw that all the fat around her heart had
been scooped away.

Apropos of ineradicable blood on a floor, which is a not infrequent item
in stories of haunted houses, it is said that a manifestation of this
nature forms the haunting in a farmhouse in Co. Limerick. According to
our informants, a light must be kept burning in this house all night; if
by any chance it is forgotten, or becomes quenched, in the morning the
floor is covered with blood. The story is evidently much older than the
house, but no traditional explanation is given.

Two stories of haunted schools have been sent to us, both on very good
authority; these establishments lie within the geographical limits of
this chapter, but for

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

obvious reasons, we cannot indicate their locality more precisely,
though the names of both are known to us. The first of these was told to
our correspondent by the boy Brown, who was in the room, but did *not*
see the ghost.

When Brown was about fifteen he was sent to — School. His brother told
him not to be frightened at anything he might see or hear, as the boys
were sure to play tricks on all new-comers. He was put to sleep in a
room with another new arrival, a boy named Smith, from England. In the
middle of the night Brown was roused from his sleep by Smith crying out
in great alarm, and asking who was in the room. Brown, who was very
angry at being waked up, told him not to be a fool—that there was no one
there. The second night Smith roused him again, this time in greater
alarm than the first night. He said he saw a man in cap and gown come
into the room with a lamp, and then pass right through the wall. Smith
got out of his bed, and fell on his knees beside Brown, beseeching him
not to go to sleep. At first Brown thought it was all done to frighten
him, but he then

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

saw that Smith was in a state of abject terror. Next morning they spoke
of the occurrence, and the report reached the ears of the Head Master,
who sent for the two boys. Smith refused to spend another night in the
room. Brown said he had seen or heard nothing, and was quite willing to
sleep there if another fellow would sleep with him, but he would not
care to remain there alone. The Head Master then asked for volunteers
from the class of elder boys, but not one of them would sleep in the
room. It had always been looked upon as "haunted," but the Master
thought that by putting in new boys who had not heard the story they
would sleep there all right.

Some years after, Brown revisited the place, and found that another
attempt had been made to occupy the room. A new Head Master who did not
know its history, thought it a pity to have the room idle, and put a
teacher, also new to the school, in possession. When this teacher came
down the first morning, he asked who had come into his room during the
night. He stated that a man in cap and gown, having books under his arm
and a lamp in his hand, came

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

in, sat down at a table, and began to react. He knew that he was not one
of the masters, and did not recognise him as one of the boys. The room
had to be abandoned. The tradition is that many years ago a master was
murdered in that room by one of the students. The few boys who ever had
the courage to persist in sleeping in the room said if they stayed more
than two or three nights that the furniture was moved, and they heard
violent noises.

The second story was sent to us by the percipient herself, and is
therefore a firsthand experience. Considering that she was only a
schoolgirl at the time, it must be admitted that she made a most plucky
attempt to run the ghost to earth.

"A good many years ago, when I first went to school, I did not believe
in ghosts, but I then had an experience which caused me to alter my
opinion. I was ordered with two other girls to sleep in a small top room
at the back of the house which overlooked a garden which contained
ancient apple-trees.

"Suddenly in the dead of night I was awakened out of my sleep by the
sound of

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

heavy footsteps, as of a man wearing big boots unlaced, pacing
ceaselessly up and down a long corridor which I knew was plainly visible
from the landing outside my door, as there was a large window at the
farther end of it, and there was sufficient moonlight to enable one to
see its full length. After listening for about twenty minutes, my
curiosity was aroused, so I got up and stood on the landing. The
footsteps still continued, but I could see nothing, although the sounds
actually reached the foot of the flight of stairs which led from the
corridor to the landing on which I was standing. Suddenly the footfall
ceased, pausing at my end of the corridor, and I then considered it was
high time for me to retire, which I accordingly did, carefully closing
the door behind me.

"To my horror the footsteps ascended the stairs, and the bedroom door
was violently dashed back against a washing-stand, beside which was a
bed; the contents of the ewer were spilled over the occupant, and the
steps advanced a few paces into the room in my direction. A cold
perspiration broke out all over me; I cannot describe the sensation.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was not actual
fear—it was more than that—I felt I had come into contact with the
Unknown.

"What was about to happen? All I could do was to speak; I cried out,
"Who are you? What do you want?" Suddenly the footsteps ceased; I felt
relieved, and lay awake till morning, but no further sound reached my
ears. How or when my ghostly visitant disappeared I never knew; suffice
it to say, my story was no nightmare, but an actual fact, of which there
was found sufficient proof in the morning; the floor was still saturated
with water, the door, which we always carefully closed at night, was
wide open, and last, but not least, the occupant of the wet bed had
heard all that had happened, but feared to speak, and lay awake till
morning.

"Naturally, we related our weird experience to our schoolmates, and it
was only then I learned from one of the elder girls that this ghost had
manifested itself for many years in a similar fashion to the inhabitants
of that room. It was supposed to be the spirit of a man who, long years
before, had occupied this apartment (the house was

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

then a private residence), and had commited suicide by hanging himself
from an old apple tree opposite the window. Needless to say, the story
was hushed up, and we were sharply spoken to, and warned not to mention
the occurrence again.

"Some years afterwards a friend, who happened at the time to be a
boarder at this very school, came to spend a week-end with me. She
related an exactly similar incident which occurred a few nights previous
to her visit. My experience was quite unknown to her."

The following account of strange happenings at his glebe-house has been
sent by the rector of a parish in the diocese of Cashel: "Shortly after
my wife and I came to live here, some ten years ago, the servants
complained of hearing strange noises in the top storey of the Rectory
where they sleep. One girl ran away the day after she arrived, declaring
that the house was haunted, and that nothing would induce her to sleep
another night in it. So often had my wife to change servants on this
account that at last I had to speak to the parish priest, as I suspected
that the idea of 'ghosts' might

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

have been suggested to the maids by neighbours who might have some
interest in getting rid of them. I understand that my friend the parish
priest spoke very forcibly from the altar on the subject of spirits,
saying that the only spirits he believed ever did any harm to anyone
were —, mentioning a well-known brand of the wine of the country.
Whether this priestly admonition was the cause or not, for some time we
heard no more tales of ghostly manifestations.

"After a while, however, my wife and I began to hear a noise which,
while in no sense alarming, has proved to be both remarkable and
inexplicable. If we happen to be sitting in the dining-room after
dinner, sometimes we hear what sounds like the noise of a heavy coach
rumbling up to the hall door. We have both heard this noise hundreds of
times between eight P.M. and midnight. Sometimes we hear it several
times the same night, and then perhaps we won't hear it again for
several months. We hear it best on calm nights, and as we are nearly a
quarter of a mile from the high road, it is difficult to account for,
especially

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

as the noise appears to be quite close to us—I mean not farther away
than the hall-door. I may mention that an Englishman was staying with us
a few years ago. As we were sitting in the dining-room one night after
dinner he said, 'A carriage has just driven up to the door'; but we knew
it was only the 'phantom coach,' for we also heard it. Only once do I
remember hearing it while sitting in the drawing-room. So much for the
'sound' of the 'phantom coach,' but now I must tell you what I saw with
my own eyes as clearly as I now see the paper on which I am writing.
Some years ago in the middle of the summer, on a scorching hot day, I
was out cutting some hay opposite the hall door just by the tennis
court. It was between twelve and one o'clock. I remember the time
distinctly, as my man had gone to his dinner shortly before. The spot on
which I was commanded a view of the avenue from the entrance gate for
about four hundred yards. I happened to look up from my occupation—for
scything is no easy work—and I saw what I took to be a somewhat high
dogcart, in which two people were seated, turning

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

in at the avenue gate. As I had my coat and waistcoat off, and was not
in a state to receive visitors, I got behind a newly-made hay-cock and
watched the vehicle until it came to a bend in the avenue where there is
a clump of trees which obscured it from my view. As it did not, however,
reappear, I concluded that the occupants had either stopped for some
reason or had taken by mistake a cart-way leading to the back gate into
the garden. Hastily putting on my coat, I went down to the bend in the
avenue, but to my surprise there was nothing to be seen.

"Returning to the Rectory, I met my housekeeper, who has been with me
for nearly twenty years, and I told her what I had seen. She then told
me that about a month before, while I was away from home, my man had one
day gone with the trap to the station. She saw, just as I did, a trap
coming up the avenue until it was lost to sight owing to the
intervention of the clump of trees. As it did not come on, she went down
to the bend, but there was no trap to be seen. When the man came in some
half-hour after, my housekeeper asked

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

him if he had come half-way up the avenue and turned back, but he said
he had only that minute come straight from the station. My housekeeper
said she did not like to tell me about it before, as she thought I
'would have laughed at her.' Whether the 'spectral gig' which I saw and
the 'phantom coach' which my wife and I have often heard are one and the
same I know not, but I do know that what I saw in the full blaze of the
summer sun was not inspired by a dose of the spirits referred to by my
friend the parish priest.

"Some time during the winter of 1912, I was in the motor-house one dark
evening at about 6 P.M. I was working at the engine, and as the car was
'nose in' first, I was, of course, at the farthest point from the door.
I had sent my man down to the village with a message. He was gone about
ten minutes when I heard heavy footsteps enter the yard and come over to
the motor-house. I 'felt' that there was some one in the house quite
close to me, and I said, 'Hullo, —, what brought you back so soon,' as I
knew he could not have been to the village and back. As I got no reply,
I took up my electric

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

lamp and went to the back of the motor to see who was there, but there
was no one to be seen, and although I searched the yard with my lamp, I
could discover no one. About a week later I heard the footsteps again
under almost identical conditions, but I searched with the same futile
result.

"Before I stop, I must tell you about a curious 'presentiment' which
happened with regard to a man I got from the Queen's County. He arrived
on a Saturday evening, and on the following Monday morning I put him to
sweep the avenue. He was at his work when I went out in the motor car at
about 10-30 A.M. Shortly after I left he left his wheel-barrow and tools
on the avenue (just at the point where I saw the 'spectral gig'
disappear) and, coming up to the Rectory, he told my housekeeper in a
great state of agitation that he was quite sure that his brother, with
whom he had always lived, was dead. He said he must return home at once.
My housekeeper advised him to wait until I returned, but he changed his
clothes and packed his box, saying he must catch the next train. Just
before I returned home at 12 o'clock, a telegram came saying

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

his brother had died suddenly that morning, and that he was to return at
once. On my return I found him almost in a state of collapse. He left by
the next train, and I never heard of him again."

K— Castle is a handsome blending of ancient castle and modern
dwelling-house, picturesquely situated among trees, while the steep glen
mentioned below runs close beside it. It has the reputation of being
haunted, but, as usual, it is difficult to get information. One
gentleman, to whom we wrote, stated that he never saw or heard anything
worse than a bat. On the other hand, a lady who resided there a good
many years ago, gives the following account of her extraordinary
experiences therein:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Seymour</span>,

I enclose some account of our experiences in K— Castle. It would be
better not to mention names, as the people occupying it have told me
they are afraid of their servants hearing anything, and consequently
giving notice. They themselves hear voices often, but, like me, they do
not mind. When first we went there

</div>

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

we heard people talking, but on looking everywhere we could find no one.
Then on some nights we heard fighting in the glen beside the house. We
could hear voices raised in anger, and the clash of steel: no person
would venture there after dusk.

One night I was sitting talking with my governess, I got up, said
good-night, and opened the door, which was on the top of the back
staircase. As I did so, I *heard* some one (a woman) come slowly
upstairs, walk past us to a window at the end of the landing, and then
with a shriek fall heavily. As she passed it was bitterly cold, and I
drew back into the room, but did not say anything, as it might frighten
the governess. She asked me what was the matter, as I looked so white.
Without answering, I pushed her into her room, and then searched the
house, but with no results.

Another night I was sleeping with my little girl. I awoke, and saw a
girl with long, fair hair standing at the fireplace, one hand at her
side, the other on the chimney-piece. Thinking at first it was my little
girl, I felt on the pillow to see

</div>

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

if she were gone, but she was fast asleep. There was no fire or light of
any kind in the room.

Some time afterwards a friend was sleeping there, and she told me that
she was pushed out of bed the whole night. Two gentlemen to whom I had
mentioned this came over, thinking they would find out the cause. In the
morning when they came down they asked for the carriage to take them to
the next train, but would not tell what they had heard or seen. Another
person who came to visit her sister, who was looking after the house
before we went in, slept in this room, and in the morning said she must
go back that day. She also would give no information.

On walking down the corridor, I have heard a door open, a footstep cross
before me, and go into another room, *both* doors being closed at the
time. An old cook I had told me that when she went into the hall in the
morning, a gentleman would come down the front stairs, take a plumed hat
off the stand, and vanish *through* the hall door. This she saw nearly

</div>

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

every morning. She also said that a girl often came into her bedroom,
and put her hand on her (the cook's) face; and when she would push her
away she would hear a girl's voice say, "Oh don't!" three times. I have
often heard voices in the drawing-room, which decidedly sounded as if an
old gentleman and a girl were talking. Noises like furniture being moved
were frequently heard at night, and strangers staying with us have often
asked why the servants turned out the rooms underneath them at such an
unusual hour. The front-door bell sometimes rang, and I have gone down,
but found no one.—Yours very sincerely,

F. T.

"Kilman" Castle, in the heart of Ireland—the name is obviously a
pseudonym—has been described as perhaps the worst haunted mansion in the
British Isles. That it deserves this doubtful recommendation, we cannot
say; but at all events the ordinary reader will be prepared to admit
that it contains sufficient "ghosts" to satisfy the most greedy
ghost-hunter. A couple of months

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

ago the present writer paid a visit to this castle, and was shown all
over it one morning by the mistress of the house, who, under the *nom de
plume* of "Andrew Merry" has published novels dealing with Irish life,
and has also contributed articles on the ghostly phenomena of her house
to the *Occult Review* (Dec. 1908 and Jan. 1909).

The place itself is a grim, grey, bare building. The central portion, in
which is the entrance-hall, is a square castle of the usual type; it is
built on a rock, and a slight batter from base to summit gives an added
appearance of strength and solidity. On either side of the castle are
more modern wings, one of which terminates in what is known as the
"Priest's House."

Now to the ghosts. The top storey of the central tower is a large,
well-lighted apartment, called the "Chapel," having evidently served
that purpose in times past. At one end is what is said to be an
*oubliette*, now almost filled up. Occasionally in the evenings, people
walking along the roads or in the fields see the windows of this chapel
lighted up for a few seconds as if many lamps were suddenly brought into
it. This is certainly *not* due

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

to servants; from our experience we can testify that it is the last
place on earth that a domestic would enter after dark. It is also said
that a treasure is buried somewhere in or around the castle. The legend
runs that an ancestor was about to be taken to Dublin on a charge of
rebellion, and, fearing he would never return, made the best of the time
left to him by burying somewhere a crock full of gold and jewels.
Contrary to expectation, he *did* return; but his long confinement had
turned his brain, and he could never remember the spot where he had
deposited his treasure years before. Some time ago a lady, a Miss B.,
who was decidedly psychic, was invited to Kilman Castle in the hope that
she would be able to locate the whereabouts of this treasure. In this
respect she failed, unfortunately, but gave, nevertheless, a curious
example of her power. As she walked through the hall with her hostess,
she suddenly laid her hand upon the bare stone wall, and remarked,
"There is something uncanny here, but I don't know what it is." In that
very spot, some time previously, two skeletons had been discovered
walled up.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

The sequel to this is curious. Some time after, Miss B. was either
trying automatic writing, or else was at a séance (we forget which),
when a message came to her from the Unseen, stating that the treasure at
Kilman Castle was concealed in the chapel under the tessellated pavement
near the altar. But this spirit was either a "lying spirit," or else a
most impish one, for there is no trace of an altar, and it is impossible
to say, from the style of the room, where it stood; while the
tessellated pavement (if it exists) is so covered with the debris of the
former roof that it would be almost impossible to have it thoroughly
cleared.

There is as well a miscellaneous assortment of ghosts. A monk with
tonsure and cowl walks in at one window of the Priest's House, and out
at another. There is also a little old man, dressed in the antique garb
of a green cut-away coat, knee breeches, and buckled shoes: he is
sometimes accompanied by an old lady in similar old-fashioned costume.
Another ghost has a penchant for lying on the bed beside its lawful and
earthly occupant; nothing is seen, but a great weight is felt, and a

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

consequent deep impression made on the bedclothes.

The lady of the house states that she has a number of letters from
friends, in which they relate the supernatural experiences they had
while staying at the Castle. In one of these the writer, a gentleman,
was awakened one night by an extraordinary feeling of intense cold at
his heart. He then saw in front of him a tall female figure, clothed
from head to foot in red, and with its right hand raised menacingly in
the air: the light which illuminated the figure was from within. He lit
a match, and sprang out of bed, but the room was empty. He went back to
bed, and saw nothing more that night, except that several times the same
cold feeling gripped his heart, though to the touch the flesh was quite
warm.

But of all the ghosts in that well-haunted house the most unpleasant is
that inexplicable thing that is usually called "It." The lady of the
house described to the present writer her personal experience of this
phantom. High up round one side of the hall runs a gallery which
connects with some of the bedrooms. One evening she was in this

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

gallery leaning on the balustrade, and looking down into the hall.
Suddenly she felt two hands laid on her shoulders; she turned round
sharply, and saw "It" standing close beside her. She described it as
being human in shape, and about four feet high; the eyes were like two
black holes in the face, and the whole figure seemed as if it were made
of grey cotton-wool, while it was accompanied by a most appalling
stench, such as would come from a decaying human body. The lady got a
shock from which she did not recover for a long time.
