# TRUE IRISH GHOST STORIES

### CHAPTER I

#### HAUNTED HOUSES IN OR NEAR DUBLIN

<span class="smallcaps">Of</span> all species of ghostly phenomena, that
commonly known as "haunted houses" appeals most to the ordinary person.
There is something very eerie in being shut up within the four walls of
a house with a ghost. The poor human being is placed at such a
disadvantage. If we know that a gateway, or road, or field has the
reputation of being haunted, we can in nearly every case make a detour,
and so avoid the unpleasant locality. But the presence of a ghost in a
house creates a very different state of affairs. It appears and
disappears at its own sweet will, with a total disregard for our
feelings: it seems to be as much

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

part and parcel of the domicile as the staircase or the hall door, and,
consequently, nothing short of leaving the house or of pulling it down
(both of these solutions are not always practicable) will free us
absolutely from the unwelcome presence.

There is also something so natural, and at the same time so unnatural,
in seeing a door open when we know that no human hand rests on the knob,
or in hearing the sound of footsteps, light or heavy, and feeling that
it cannot be attributed to the feet of mortal man or woman. Or perhaps a
form appears in a room, standing, sitting, or walking—in fact, situated
in its three dimensions apparently as an ordinary being of flesh and
blood, until it proves its unearthly nature by vanishing before our
astonished eyes. Or perhaps we are asleep in bed. The room is shrouded
in darkness, and our recumbent attitude, together with the weight of
bed-clothes, hampers our movements and probably makes us more cowardly.
A man will meet pain or danger boldly if he be standing
upright—occupying that erect position which is his as Lord of Creation;

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

but his courage does not well so high if he be supine. We are awakened
suddenly by the feel that some superhuman Presence is in the room. We
are transfixed with terror, we cannot find either the bell-rope or the
matches, while we *dare* not leap out of bed and make a rush for the
door lest we should encounter we know not what. In an agony of fear, we
feel it moving towards us; it approaches closer, and yet closer, to the
bed, and—for what may or may not then happen we must refer our readers
to the pages of this book.

But the sceptical reader will say: "This is all very well, but—there are
*no* haunted houses. All these alleged strange happenings are due to a
vivid imagination, or else to rats and mice." (The question of
deliberate and conscious fraud may be rejected in almost every
instance.) This simple solution has been put forward so often that it
should infallibly have solved the problem long ago. But will such a
reader explain how it is that the noise made by rats and mice can
resemble slow, heavy footsteps, or else take the form of a human being
seen by several persons; or how our imagination

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

can cause doors to open and shut, or else create a conglomeration of
noises which, physically, would be beyond the power of ordinary
individuals to reproduce? Whatever may be the ultimate explanation, we
feel that there is a great deal in the words quoted by Professor
Barrett: "In spite of all reasonable scepticism, it is difficult to
avoid accepting, at least provisionally, the conclusion that there are,
in a certain sense, haunted houses, *i.e.* that there are houses in
which similar quasi-human apparitions have occurred at different times
to different inhabitants, under circumstances which exclude the
hypothesis of suggestion or expectation."

We must now turn to the subject of this chapter. Mrs. G. Kelly, a lady
well known in musical circles in Dublin, sends as her own personal
experience the following tale of a most quiet haunting, in which the
spectral charwoman (!) does not seem to have entirely laid aside all her
mundane habits.

"My first encounter with a ghost occurred about twenty years ago. On
that occasion I was standing in the kitchen of my house

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

in — Square, when a woman, whom I was afterwards to see many times,
walked down the stairs into the room. Having heard the footsteps
outside, I was not in the least perturbed, but turned to look who it
was, and found myself looking at a tall, stout, elderly woman, wearing a
bonnet and old-fashioned mantle. She had grey hair, and a benign and
amiable expression. We stood gazing at each other while one could count
twenty. At first I was not at all frightened, but gradually as I stood
looking at her an uncomfortable feeling, increasing to terror, came over
me. This caused me to retreat farther and farther back, until I had my
back against the wall, and then the apparition slowly faded.

"This feeling of terror, due perhaps to the unexpectedness of her
appearance, always overcame me on the subsequent occasions on which I
saw her. These occasions numbered twelve or fifteen, and I have seen her
in every room in the house, and at every hour of the day, during a
period of about ten years. The last time she appeared was ten years ago.
My husband and I had just returned from a concert at which he

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

had been singing, and we sat for some time over supper, talking about
the events of the evening. When at last I rose to leave the room, and
opened the dining-room door, I found my old lady standing on the mat
outside with her head bent towards the door in the attitude of
listening. I called out loudly, and my husband rushed to my side. That
was the last time I have seen her."

"One peculiarity of this spectral visitant was a strong objection to
disorder or untidyness of any kind, or even to an alteration in the
general routine of the house. For instance, she showed her disapproval
of any stranger coming to sleep by turning the chairs face downwards on
the floor in the room they were to occupy. I well remember one of our
guests, having gone to his room one evening for something he had
forgotten, remarking on coming downstairs again, 'Well, you people have
an extraordinary manner of arranging your furniture! I have nearly
broken my bones over one of the bedroom chairs which was turned down on
the floor.' As my husband and I had restored that chair twice already to

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

its proper position during the day, we were not much surprised at his
remarks, although we did not enlighten him. The whole family have been
disturbed by a peculiar knocking which occurred in various rooms in the
house, frequently on the door or wall, but sometimes on the furniture,
quite close to where we had been sitting. This was evidently loud enough
to be heard in the next house, for our next-door neighbour once asked my
husband why he selected such curious hours for hanging his pictures.
Another strange and fairly frequent occurrence was the following. I had
got a set of skunk furs which I fancied had an unpleasant odour, as this
fur sometimes has; and at night I used to take it from my wardrobe and
lay it on a chair in the drawing-room, which was next my bedroom. The
first time that I did this, on going to the drawing-room I found, to my
surprise, my muff in one corner and my stole in another. Not for a
moment suspecting a supernatural agent, I asked my servant about it, and
she assured me that she had not been in the room that morning. Whereupon
I determined to test the matter, which I did

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

by putting in the furs late at night, and taking care that I was the
first to enter the room in the morning. I invariably found that they had
been disturbed."

The following strange and pathetic incident occurred in a well-known
Square in the north side of the city. In or about a hundred years ago a
young officer was ordered to Dublin, and took a house there for himself
and his family. He sent on his wife and two children, intending to join
them in the course of a few days. When the latter and the nurse arrived,
they found only the old charwoman in the house, and she left shortly
after their arrival. Finding that something was needed, the nurse went
out to purchase it. On her return she asked the mother were the children
all right, as she had seen two ghostly forms flit past her on the
door-step! The mother answered that she believed they were, but on going
up to the nursery they found both the children with their throats cut.
The murderer was never brought to justice, and no motive was ever
discovered for the crime. The unfortunate mother went mad, and it is
said that an eerie feeling still clings to

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the house, while two little heads are sometimes seen at the window of
the room where the deed was committed.

A most weird experience fell to the lot of Major Macgregor, and was
contributed by him to *Real Ghost Stories*, the celebrated Christmas
number of the *Review of Reviews*. He says: "In the end of 1871 I went
over to Ireland to visit a relative living in a Square in the north side
of Dublin. In January 1872 the husband of my relative fell ill. I sat up
with him for several nights, and at last, as he seemed better, I went to
bed, and directed the footman to call me if anything went wrong. I soon
fell asleep, but some time after was awakened by a push on the left
shoulder. I started up, and said, 'Is there anything wrong?' I got no
answer, but immediately received another push. I got annoyed, and said
'Can you not speak, man! and tell me if there is anything wrong?' Still
no answer, and I had a feeling I was going to get another push when I
suddenly turned round and caught a human hand, warm, plump, and soft. I
said, 'Who are you?' but I got no answer. I then tried to pull the
person

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

towards me, but could not do so. I then said, 'I *will* know who you
are!' and having the hand tight in my right hand, with my left I felt
the wrist and arm, enclosed, as it seemed to me, in a tight-fitting
sleeve of some winter material with a linen cuff; but when I got to the
elbow all trace of an arm ceased. I was so astounded that I let the hand
go, and just then the clock struck two. Including the mistress of the
house, there were five females in the establishment, and I can assert
that the hand belonged to none of them. When I reported the adventure,
the servants exclaimed, 'Oh, it must have been the master's old Aunt
Betty, who lived for many years in the upper part of that house, and had
died over fifty years before at a great age.' I afterwards heard that
the room in which I felt the hand had been considered haunted, and very
curious noises and peculiar incidents occurred, such as the bed-clothes
torn off, &c. One lady got a slap in the face from some invisible hand,
and when she lit her candle she saw as if something opaque fell or
jumped off the bed. A general officer, a brother of the lady, slept
there two nights, but preferred

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

going to a hotel to remaining the third night. He never would say what
he heard or saw, but always said the room was uncanny. I slept for
months in the room afterwards, and was never in the least disturbed."

A truly terrifying sight was witnessed by a clergyman in a school-house
a good many years ago. This cleric was curate of a Dublin parish, but
resided with his parents some distance out of town in the direction of
Malahide. It not infrequently happened that he had to hold meetings in
the evenings, and on such occasions, as his home was so far away, and as
the modern convenience of tramcars was not then known, he used to sleep
in the schoolroom, a large bare room, where the meetings were held. He
had made a sleeping-apartment for himself by placing a pole across one
end of the room, on which he had rigged up two curtains which, when
drawn together, met in the middle. One night he had been holding some
meeting, and when everybody had left he locked up the empty schoolhouse,
and went to bed. It was a bright moonlight night, and every object

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

could be seen perfectly clearly. Scarcely had he got into bed when he
became conscious of some invisible presence. Then he saw the curtains
agitated at one end, as if hands were grasping them on the outside. In
an agony of terror he watched these hands groping along outside the
curtains till they reached the middle. The curtains were then drawn a
little apart, and a Face peered in—an awful, evil Face, with an
expression of wickedness and hate upon it which no words could describe.
It looked at him for a few moments, then drew back again, and the
curtains closed. The clergyman had sufficient courage left to leap out
of bed and make a thorough examination of the room, but, as he expected,
he found no one. He dressed himself as quickly as possible, walked home,
and never again slept a night in that schoolroom.

The following tale, sent by Mr. E. B. de Lacy, contains a most
extraordinary and unsatisfactory element of mystery. He says: "When I
was a boy I lived in the suburbs, and used to come in every morning to
school in the city. My way lay through a certain street in which stood a
very dismal semi-detached

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

house, which, I might say, was closed up regularly about every six
months. I would see new tenants coming into it, and then in a few months
it would be 'To let' again. This went on for eight or nine years, and I
often wondered what was the reason. On inquiring one day from a friend,
I was told that it had the reputation of being haunted.

"A few years later I entered business in a certain office, and one day
it fell to my lot to have to call on the lady who at that particular
period was the tenant of the haunted house. When we had transacted our
business she informed me that she was about to leave. Knowing the
reputation of the house, and being desirous of investigating a
ghost-story, I asked her if she would give me the history of the house
as far as she knew it, which she very kindly did as follows:

"About forty years ago the house was left by will to a gentleman named
—. He lived in it for a short time, when he suddenly went mad, and had
to be put in an asylum. Upon this his agents let the house to a lady.
Apparently nothing unusual

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

happened for some time, but a few months later, as she went down one
morning to a room behind the kitchen, she found the cook hanging by a
rope attached to a hook in the ceiling. After the inquest the lady gave
up the house.

"It was then closed up for some time, but was again advertised 'To let,'
and a caretaker, a woman, was put into it. One night about one o'clock,
a constable going his rounds heard some one calling for help from the
house, and found the caretaker on the sill of one of the windows holding
on as best she could. He told her to go in and open the hall door and
let him in, but she refused to enter the room again. He forced open the
door and succeeded in dragging the woman back into the room, only to
find she had gone mad.

"Again the house was shut up, and again it was let, this time to a lady,
on a five-years’ lease. However, after a few months’ residence, she
locked it up, and went away. On her friends asking her why she did so,
she replied that she would rather pay the whole five years’ rent than
live in it herself, or allow anyone

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

else to do so, but would give no other reason.

"'I believe I was the next person to take this house,' said the lady who
narrated the story to me (*i.e.* Mr. de Lacy). 'I took it about eighteen
months ago on a three years’ lease in the hopes of making money by
taking in hoarders, but I am now giving it up because none of them will
stay more than a week or two. They do not give any definite reason as to
why they are leaving; they are careful to state that it is not because
they have any fault to find with me or my domestic arrangements, but
they merely say *they do not like the rooms!* The rooms themselves, as
you can see, are good, spacious, and well lighted. I have had all
classes of professional men; one of the last was a barrister, and he
said that he had no fault to find except that *he did not like the
rooms!* I myself do not believe in ghosts, and I have never seen
anything strange here or elsewhere; and if I had known the house had the
reputation of being haunted, I would never have rented it."

Marsh's library, that quaint, old-world repository of ponderous tomes,
is reputed to

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

be haunted by the ghost of its founder, Primate Narcissus Marsh. He is
said to frequent the inner gallery, which contains what was formerly his
own private library: he moves in and out among the cases, taking down
books from the shelves, and occasionally throwing them down on the
reader's desk as if in anger. However, he always leaves things in
perfect order. The late Mr. —, who for some years lived in the
librarian's rooms underneath, was a firm believer in this ghost, and
said he frequently heard noises which could only be accounted for by the
presence of a nocturnal visitor; the present tenant is more sceptical.
The story goes that Marsh's niece eloped from the Palace, and was
married in a tavern to the curate of Chapelizod. She is reported to have
written a note consenting to the elopement, and to have then placed it
in one of her uncle's books to which her lover had access, and where he
found it. As a punishment for his lack of vigilance, the Archbishop is
said to be condemned to hunt for the note until he find it—hence the
ghost.

The ghost of a deceased Canon was seen

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

in one of the Dublin cathedrals by several. independent witnesses, one
of whom, a lady, gives her own experience as follows: "Canon — was a
personal friend of mine, and we had many times discussed ghosts and
spiritualism, in which he was a profound believer, having had many
supernatural experiences himself. It was during the Sunday morning
service in the cathedral that I saw my friend, who had been dead for two
years, sitting inside the communion-rails. I was so much astonished at
the flesh-and blood appearance of the figure that I took off my glasses
and wiped them with my handkerchief, at the same time looking away from
him down the church. On looking back again he was still there, and
continued to sit there for about ten or twelve minutes, after which he
faded away. I remarked a change in his personal appearance, which was,
that his beard was longer and whiter than when I had known him—in fact,
such a change as would have occurred *in life* in the space of two
years. Having told my husband of the occurrence on our way home, he
remembered having heard some talk of an appearance of this clergyman in
the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

cathedral since his death. He hurried back to the afternoon service, and
asked the robestress if anybody had seen Canon —’s ghost. She informed
him that *she* had, and that he had also been seen by one of the sextons
in the cathedral. I mention this because in describing his personal
appearance she had remarked the same change as I had with regard to the
beard."

Some years ago a family had very uncanny experiences in a house in
Rathgar, and subsequently in another in Rathmines. These were
communicated by one of the young ladies to Mrs. M. A. Wilkins, who
published them in the *Journal* of the American S.P.R., <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) from which they are here taken. The Rathgar
house had a basement passage leading to a door into the yard, and along
this passage her mother and the children used to hear dragging, limping
steps, and the latch of the door rattling, but no one could ever be
found when search was made. The house-bells were old and all in a row,
and on one occasion they all rang, apparently of their own accord. The
lady narrator used to sleep in the back drawing room, and

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

always when the light was put out she heard strange noises, as if some
one was going round the room rubbing paper along the wall, while she
often had the feeling that a person was standing beside her bed. A
cousin, who was a nurse, once slept with her, and also noticed these
strange noises. On one occasion this room was given up to a very
matter-of-fact young man to sleep in, and next morning he said that the
room was very strange, with queer noises in it.

Her mother also had an extraordinary experience in the same house. One
evening she had just put the baby to bed, when she heard a voice calling
"mother." She left the bedroom, and called to her daughter, who was in a
lower room, "What do you want?" But the girl replied that she had not
called her; and then, in her turn, asked her mother if *she* had been in
the front room, for she had just heard a noise as if some one was trying
to fasten the inside bars of the shutters across. But her mother had
been upstairs, and no one was in the front room. The experiences in the
Rathmines house were of a similar auditory nature, *i.e.* the young
ladies heard their names called,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

though it was found that no one in the house had done so.

Occasionally it happens that ghosts inspire a law-suit. In the
seventeenth century they were to be found actively urging the adoption
of legal proceedings, but in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries they
play a more passive part. A case about a haunted house took place in
Dublin in the year 1885, in which the ghost may be said to have won. A
Mr. Waldron, a solicitor's clerk, sued his next-door neighbour, one Mr.
Kiernan, a mate in the merchant service, to recover £500 for damages
done to his house.

Kiernan altogether denied the charges, but asserted that Waldron's house
was notoriously haunted. Witnesses proved that every night, from August
1884 to January 1885, stones were thrown at the windows and doors, and
extraordinary and inexplicable occurrences constantly took place.

Mrs. Waldron, wife of the plaintiff, swore that one night she saw one of
the panes of glass of a certain window cut through with a diamond, and a
white hand inserted through the hole. She at once caught up

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

a bill-hook and aimed a blow at the hand, cutting off one of the
fingers. This finger could not be found, nor were any traces of blood
seen.

A servant of hers was sorely persecuted by noises and the sound of
footsteps. Mr. Waldron, with the aid of detectives and policemen,
endeavoured to find out the cause, but with no success. The witnesses in
the case were closely cross-examined, but without shaking their
testimony. The facts appeared to be proved, so the jury found for
Kiernan, the defendant. At least twenty persons had testified on oath to
the fact that the house had been known to have been haunted. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

Before leaving the city and its immediate surroundings, we must relate
the story of an extraordinary ghost, somewhat lacking in good manners,
yet not without a certain distorted sense of humour. Absolutely
incredible though the tale may seem, yet it comes on very good
authority. It was related to our informant, Mr. D., by a Mrs. C., whose
daughter he had employed as governess. Mrs. C., who is described as

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "a woman of
respectable position and good education," heard it in her turn from her
father and mother. In the story the relationship of the different
persons seems a little involved, but it would appear that the initial A
belongs to the surname both of Mrs. C.’s father and grandfather.

This ghost was commonly called "Corney" by the family, and he answered
to this though it was not his proper name. He disclosed this latter to
Mr. C.’s mother, who forgot it. Corney made his presence manifest to the
A— family shortly after they had gone to reside in Street in the
following manner. Mr. A— had sprained his knee badly, and had to use a
crutch, which at night was left at the head of his bed. One night his
wife heard some one walking on the lobby, thump, thump, thump, as if
imitating Mr. A—. She struck a match to see if the crutch had been
removed from the head of the bed, but it was still there.

From that on Corney commenced to talk, and he spoke every day from his
usual habitat, the coal-cellar off the kitchen. His voice sounded as if
it came out of an empty barrel.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

He was very troublesome, and continually played practical jokes on the
servants, who, as might be expected, were in terror of their lives of
him; so much so that Mrs. A— could hardly induce them to stay with her.
They used to sleep in a press-bed in the kitchen, and in order to get
away from Corney, they asked for a room at the top of the house, which
was given to them. Accordingly the press-bed was moved up there. The
first night they went to retire to bed after the change, the doors of
the press were flung open, and Corney's voice said, "Ha! ha! you devils,
I am here before you! I am not confined to any particular part of this
house."

Corney was continually tampering with the doors, and straining locks and
keys, He only manifested himself in material form to two persons; to —,
who died with the fright, and to Mr. A— (Mrs. C.’s father) when he was
about seven years old. The latter described him to his mother as a naked
man, with a curl on his forehead, and a skin like a clothes-horse (!).

One day a servant was preparing fish for dinner. She laid it on the
kitchen table

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

while she went elsewhere for something she wanted. When she returned the
fish had disappeared. She thereupon began to cry, fearing she would be
accused of making away with it. The next thing she heard was the voice
of Corney from the coal-cellar saying, "There, you blubbering fool, is
your fish for you!" and, suiting the action to the word, the fish was
thrown out on the kitchen floor.

Relatives from the country used to bring presents of vegetables, and
these were often hung up by Corney like Christmas decorations round the
kitchen. There was one particular press in the kitchen he would not
allow anything into. He would throw it out again. A crock with meat in
pickle was put into it, and a fish placed on the cover of the crock. He
threw the fish out.

Silver teaspoons were missing, and no account of them could be got until
Mrs. A— asked Corney to confess if he had done anything with them. He
said, "They are under the ticking in the servants’ bed." He had, so he
said, a daughter in — Street, and sometimes announced that he was going
to see her, and would not be here to-night.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

On one occasion he announced that he was going to have "company" that
evening, and if they wanted any water out of the soft-water tank, to
take it before going to bed, as he and his friends would be using it.
Subsequently that night five or six distinct voices were heard, and next
morning the water in the tank was as black as ink, and not alone that,
but the bread and butter in the pantry were streaked with the marks of
sooty fingers.

A clergyman in the locality, having heard of the doings of Corney,
called to investigate the matter. He was advised by Mrs. A— to keep
quiet, and not to reveal his identity, as being the best chance of
hearing Corney speak. He waited a long time, and as the capricious
Corney remained silent, he left at length. The servants asked, "Corney,
why did you not speak?" and he replied, "I could not speak while that
good man was in the house." The servants sometimes used to ask him where
he was. He would reply, "The Great God would not permit me to tell you.
I was a bad man, and I died the death." He named the room in the house
in which he died.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Corney constantly joined in any conversation carried on by the people of
the house. One could never tell when a voice from the coal-cellar would
erupt into the dialogue. He had his likes and dislikes: he appeared to
dislike anyone that was not afraid of him, and would not talk to them.
Mrs. C.’s mother, however, used to get good of him by coaxing. An uncle,
having failed to get him to speak one night, took the kitchen poker, and
hammered at the door of the coal-cellar, (saying, "I'll make you speak";
but Corney wouldn't. Next morning the poker was found broken in two.
This uncle used to wear spectacles, and Corney used to call him
derisively, "Four-eyes." An uncle named Richard came to sleep one night,
and complained in the morning that the clothes were pulled off him.
Corney told the servants in great glee, "I slept on Master Richard's
feet all night."

Finally Mr. A— made several attempts to dispose of his lease, but with
no success, for when intending purchasers were being shown over the
house and arrived at Corney's domain, the spirit would begin to speak
and the would-be purchaser would fly. They

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

asked him if they changed house would he trouble them. He replied, "No!
but if they throw down this house, I will trouble the stones."

At last Mrs. A— appealed to him to keep quiet, and not to injure people
who had never injured him. He promised that he would do so, and then
said, "Mrs. A—, you will be all right now, for I see a lady in black
coming up the street to this house, and she will buy it." Within half an
hour a widow called and purchased the house. Possibly Corney is still
there, for our informant looked up the Directory as he was writing, and
found the house marked "Vacant."

Near Blanchardstown, Co. Dublin, is a house, occupied at present, or up
to very recently, by a private family; it was formerly a monastery, and
there are said to be secret passages in it. Once a servant ironing in
the kitchen saw the figure of a nun approach the kitchen window and look
in. Our informant was also told by a friend (now dead), who had it from
the lady of the house, that once night falls, no doors can be kept
closed. If anyone shuts them, almost immediately they are flung open
again with the greatest

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

violence and apparent anger. If left open there is no trouble or noise,
but light footsteps are heard, and there is a vague feeling of people
passing to and fro. The persons inhabiting the house are matter-of-fact,
unimaginative people, who speak of this as if it were an everyday
affair. "So long as we leave the doors unclosed they don't harm us: why
should we be afraid of them?" Mrs. — said. Truly a most philosophical
attitude to adopt!

A haunted house in Kingstown, Co. Dublin, was investigated by Professor
W. Barrett and Professor Henry Sidgwick. The story is singularly well
attested (as one might expect from its being inserted in the pages of
the *Proceedings S.P.R.* <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2).md), as the
apparition was seen on three distinct occasions, and by three separate
persons who were all personally known to the above gentlemen. The house
in which the following occurrences took place is described as being a
very old one, with unusually thick walls. The lady saw her strange
visitant in her bedroom. She says: "Disliking cross-lights, I had got
into the habit

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

of having the blind of the back window drawn and the shutters closed at
night, and of leaving the blind raised and the shutters opened towards
the front, liking to see the trees and sky when I awakened. Opening my
eyes now one morning, I saw right before me (this occurred in July 1873)
the figure of a woman, stooping down and apparently looking at me. Her
head and shoulders were wrapped in a common woollen shawl; her arms were
folded, and they were also wrapped, as if for warmth, in the shawl. I
looked at her in my horror, and dared not cry out lest I might move the
awful thing to speech or action. Behind her head I saw the window and
the growing dawn, the looking-glass upon the toilet-table, and the
furniture in that part of the room. After what may have been only
seconds—of the duration of this vision I cannot judge—she raised herself
and went backwards towards the window, stood at the toilet-table, and
gradually vanished. I mean she grew by degrees transparent, and that
through the shawl and the grey dress she wore I saw the white muslin of
the table-cover again, and at last saw that only in the

place where she had stood." The lady lay motionless with terror until
the servant came to call her. The only other occupants of the house at
the time were her brother and the servant, to neither of whom did she
make any mention of the circumstance, fearing that the former would
laugh at her, and the latter give notice.

Exactly a fortnight later, when sitting at breakfast, she noticed that
her brother seemed out of sorts, and did not eat. On asking him if
anything were the matter, he answered, "I have had a horrid
nightmare—indeed it was no nightmare: I saw it early this morning, just
as distinctly as I see you." "What?" she asked. "A villainous-looking
hag," he replied, with her head and arms wrapped in a cloak, stooping
over me, and looking like this—" He got up, folded his arms, and put
himself in the exact posture of the vision. Whereupon she informed him
of what she herself had seen a fortnight previously.

About four years later, in the same month, the lady's married sister and
two children were alone in the house. The eldest child, a boy of about
four or five years, asked for

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

a drink, and his mother went to fetch it, desiring him to remain in the
dining-room until her return. Coming back she met the boy pale and
trembling, and on asking him why he left the room, he replied, "Who is
that woman—who is that woman?" "Where?" she asked. "That old woman who
went upstairs," he replied. So agitated was he, that she took him by the
hand and went upstairs to search, but no one was to be found, though he
still maintained that a woman went upstairs. A friend of the family
subsequently told them that a woman had been killed in the house many
years previously, and that it was reported to be haunted.
