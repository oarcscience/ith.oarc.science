# Forths and Sheoguey Places

WHEN as children we ran up and down the green entrenchments of the big
round raths, the lisses or forths, of Esserkelly or Moneen, we knew they
had been made at one time for defence, and that is perhaps as much as is
certainly known. Those at my old home have never been opened, but in
some of their like I have gone down steps to small stonebuilt chambers
that look too low for the habitation of any living race.

Had we asked questions of the boys who led our donkeys they would in all
likelihood have given us from tradition or vision, news of the shadowy
inhabitants, the Sidhe, whose name in the Irish is all one with a blast
of wind, and of the treasures they guard. And the old writings tell us
that when blessed Patrick of the Bells walked Ireland, he did not refuse
the promise of heaven to some among those spirits in prison, the old
divine race for whom Mannanan himself had chosen these hidden dwellings,
after the great defeat in battle by the human invaders, the Gaels, or to
some they had brought among them from the face of the green earth. It
was one of their musicians who played to the holy Clerks till Patrick
himself said, "But for some tang of the music of the Sidhe that is in
it, I never heard anything nearer to the music of heaven." That music is
heard yet from time to time; and it was into one of those hill dwellings
that the father of McDonough the Galway piper, my friend, was taken till
the Sidhe had taught him all their wild tunes and so bewitched his pipes
that they would play of themselves if he threw them up among the
rafters. There were great treasures there also in Saint Patrick's time,
golden vats and horns, and crystal cups, and silk of the colour of the
foxglove. It may be of these treasures that so many dreams are told.

As to the women of the Sidhe, some who have seen them, as old Mrs.
Sheridan, tell of their white skin and yellow hair, for age has not come
on them through the centuries. When one of them came claiming the
fulfilment of an old promise from Caoilte of the Fianna, Patrick
wondered at her young beauty, while the man who had been her lover was
withered and bent and grey. But Caoilte said that was no wonder "for she
is of the Tuatha de Danaan who are unfading and whose life is lasting,
while l am of the sons of Milesius who are perishable and fade away."
Yet then as now, notwithstanding their beauty and grandeur, those swept
away into the hill dwellings would rather have the world they know. One
of Finn's men meeting a comely young man who had been his comrade but
was now an inhabitant of one of those hidden houses, asked how he fared.
And for all his fine clothing and his blue weapons and the hound he held
in a silver chain, the young man gave the names of three drudges "who
had the worst life of any who were with the Fianna," and then he said,
"I would rather be living their life than the life I am leading now."

The name of these tribes of the goddess Dana is often confused with that
of the northern invaders who were afterwards a terror to Ireland. And so
it was of those unearthly tribes an old basket-maker was thinking when
he said, in telling of the defeat of the Irish under James, "The Danes
were dancing in the raths around Aughrim the night after the battle.
Their ancestors were driven out of Ireland before, and they were glad
when they saw those that had put them out put out themselves, and
everyone of them shivered."

Many of the stories I have gathered tell how those tribes still protect
their own; and even today, March 21, 1916, I have read in the "Irish
Times" that "a farmer who was summoned by a road contractor for having
failed to cut a portion of a hedge on the roadside, told the magistrates
at Granard Petty Sessions that he objected to cutting the hedge as it
grew in a fort or rath. He however had no objection to the contractor's
men cutting the hedge. The magistrates allowed the case to stand till
the next Court."

As to Knockmaa, or Cruachmaa, or, as it is called today, Castle Hacket
Hill, that overlooks Lough Corrib and the plain of Moytura, and that we
see as a blue cloud from our roads, it was in Saint Patrick's time the
habitation of Finnbarr a king among the Sidhe and his seventeen sons,
and it is to this day spoken of as "a very Sheoguey place."

It was in these enchanted hills that the ale of Goibniu the Smith kept
whoever tasted it from sickness and from death, and there is some memory
of this in a story told me by an old farmer. "There was a man one time
set out from Ireland to go to America or some place; a common man
looking for work he was. And something happened to the ship on the way,
and they had to put to land to mend it. And in the country where they
landed he saw a forth, and he went into it, and there he saw the
smallest people he ever saw, and they were the Danes that went out of
Ireland; and it was foxes they had for dogs, and weasels were their
cats.

"Then he went back to get into the ship, but it was gone away, and he
left behind. So he went back into the forth, and a young man came to
meet him, and he told him what had happened. And the young man said
'Come into the room within where my father is in the bed, for he is out
of his health and you might be able to serve him.' So they went in and
the father was lying in the bed, and when he heard it was a man from
Ireland was in it he said, 'I will give you a great reward if you will
go back and bring me a thing I want out of Castle Hacket Hill. For if I
had what is there,' he said, 'I would be as young as my son.' So the man
consented to go, and they got a sailing ship ready, and it is what the
old man told him, to go back to Ireland. 'And buy a little pig in
Galway,' he said, 'and bring it to the mouth of the forth of Castle
Hacket and roast it there. And inside the forth is an enchanted cat that
is keeping guard there, and it will come out; and here is a shot-gun and
some cross-money that will kill any faery or any enchanted thing. And
within in the forth,' he said, 'you will find a bottle and a rack-comb,
and bring them back here to me.'

"So the man did as he was told and he bought the pig and roasted it at
the mouth of the forth, and out came the enchanted cat, and it having
hair seven inches long. And he fired the cross-money out of the
shot-gun, and the cat went away and he saw it no more. And he got the
bottle and the rack-comb and brought them back to the old man. And he
drank what was in the bottle and racked his hair with the rack, and he
got young again, as young as his own son."

It may be some of those faery treasures are still given out; for of the
family who have been for a good while owners of the hill, one at least
had the gift of genius. And I remember being told in childhood, and I
have never known if it were fact or folk-tale, that her mother having as
a bride gone to listen to some debate or royal speech in the House of
Lords at Westminster, the whole assembly had stood up in homage to her
beauty.

I was told by a Miller:

It was the Danes built these forths. They were a fair-haired race, and
they married with the Irish that were dark-haired, just like those linen
weavers your own great-grandfather brought up from the North, the
Hevenors and the Glosters and others, married with the Roman Catholics.
There was a king of the Danes called Trevenher that had a daughter that
was a great beauty. And she gave a feast, and the young men of the other
race dressed like girls and came to it, and sat at it till midnight, and
then they threw off the women's clothes and killed all the generals and
the king himself. So the Danes were driven out, that's why we have the
fires and the wisps on St. John's Eve. And as for Herself there, she
wouldn't for all the world let St Martin's Day pass without killing of
cocks--one for the woman and another for the man.

As to the three lisses at Ryanrush, there must have been a great deal of
fighting there in the old time. There are some bushes growing on them
and no one, man or woman, will ever put a hand to cut them, no more than
they would touch the little bush by the well beyond, that used to have
lights shining out of it.

And if any one was to fall asleep within the liss himself, he would be
taken away and the spirit of some old warrior would be put in his place,
and it's he would know everything in the whole world. There's no doubt
at all but that there's the same sort of things in other countries. Sure
these can go through and appear in Australia in one minute. But you hear
more about them in these parts, because the Irish do be more familiar in
talking of them.

Enchanters and magicians they were in the old times, and could make the
birds sing and the stones and the fishes speak.

It's in the forths they mostly live. The last priest that was here told
us a lot about them, but he said not to be anyway afraid of them, for
they are but poor souls doing their penance.

Mary Nagle:

That's a fine big liss at Ryanrush, and people say they hear things
there, and sometimes a great light is seen--no wonder these things
should be seen there, for it was a great place for fighting in the old
centuries, and a great deal of bones have been turned up in the fields.
There was an open passage I remember into the liss, and two girls got a
candle one time and went in, but they saw nothing but the ashes of the
fires the Danes used to make. The passage is closed up now I believe,
with big stones no man could lift.

One time a woman from the North \[45\] came to our house, and she said a
great deal of people is kept below there in the lisses; she had been
there herself, and in the night-time in one moment they'd all be away at
Cruachmaa, wherever that may be, down in the North I believe. And she
knew everything that was in the house, and told us about my sister being
sick, and that there was a hurling going on, as there was that day at
the Isabella wood in Coole. And all about Coole House she knew as if she
spent her life in it. I'd have picked a lot of stories out of her but my
mother got nervous when she heard the truth coming out, and bid me be
quiet. She had a red petticoat on her, the same as any country woman,
and she offered to cure me, for it was that time I was delicate and your
ladyship sent me to the salt water, but she asked a shilling and my
mother said she hadn't got it. "You have," says she, "and heavier metal
than that you have in the house." So then my mother gave her the
shilling, and she put it in the fire and melted it, and says she, "After
two days you'll see your shilling again." But we never did. And the cure
she left, I never took it; it's not safe, and the priests forbid us to
take their cures--for it must surely be from the devil their knowledge
comes. But no doubt at all she was one of the Ingentry, that can take
the form of a woman by day and another form at night. After that she
went to Mrs. Quaid's house and asked her for a bit of tobacco. "You'll
get it again" she said, "and more with it." And sure enough, that very
day a bit of meat came into Mrs. Quaid's house.

Maurteen Joyce:

There's a forth near Clough that wanders underneath, but a man couldn't
get into it without he'd crawl on his hands and knees. Well, Kennedy's
filly was brought in there, and lived there for five days without food
but what she got from them, and no one knew where she was rill a man
passing by heard her neighing and then she was dug out.

\* \* \*

There's a forth near our house, but it's not the good people that are in
it, only the old inhabitants of Ireland shut up there below.

There are a few old forths about, some of them you mightn't notice
unless you understood such things; but sometimes passing by you'd feel a
cold wind blowing from them, would nearly rend you in two.

When I was a young chap myself I used to see a white woman walking about
sometimes at midday--that's the worst hour there is--and she'd always go
back into a forth, and forth of Cahir near Cloonmore, and disappear into
it.

She was known to be a woman that had died nine years before; and she
would sometimes come into the sister's house, and bid her keep it clean.
But one time the sister's husband went to burn the inside of the forth,
and the next morning his barn where he had all the wheat of the harvest
and near a ton of hay and two or three packs of wool, was found to be on
fire. And his own little girl, about eight years of age, was in the
barn, and a labouring man broke through and brought a wet cloth with him
and threw it over her and carried her out But she was as black as
cinders and dead. Vexed they were at him burning the forth.

An Old Miller:

Did they get help to make those forths? You may know well that they did.
There was an engineer here when that road was being made--a sort of an
idolater or a foreigner he was--anyway he made it through the forth, and
he didn't last long after. Those other engineers, Edgeworth and Hemans
beyond at Ardrahan when the railway was made, I'm told they avoided such
things.

A Slieve Echtge Man:

There were two brothers taken away sudden, two O'Briens. They were
cutting heath one day and filling the cart with it, and a voice told
them to leave off cutting the heath, but they went on, and a blow struck
the cart on the axle. And soon after that one of the brothers sat down
in his chair and died sudden. And the other was one day going to market,
I was going to it that day myself, and he wasn't far beyond the white
gate when the axle of the cart broke in that same place where it had got
the blow, and so he had to go home again, and near the river where
they're cutting the larch he turned in to talk to a poor man that was
cutting a tree, and the tree fell, and top of it struck him and killed
him. And it was last March that happened.

There was one Leary in dough had the land taken that's near Newtown
racecourse. And he was out there one day building a wall, and it was
time for his dinner, but he had none brought with him. And a man came to
him and said "Is it home you'll be going for your dinner?" And he said
"It's not worth my while to go back to dough, I'd have the day lost."
And the man said, "Well, come in and eat a bit with me." And he brought
him into a forth and there was everything that was grand, and the dinner
they gave him of the best, so that he ate near two plates of it. And
then he went out again to build the wail. And whether it was with
lifting the heavy stones I don't know, but (with respects to you) when
he was walking the road home he began to vomit, and what he vomited up
was all green grass.

A Man on the Connemara Coast:

This is a faery stream we're passing; there were some used to see them
by the side of it, and washing themselves in it. And there used to be
heard a faery forge here every night, and the hammering of the iron
could be heard, and the blast of the furnace.

There is a faery hill beyond there in the mountain, and some have seen
fires in it all through the night. And one time the police were out
there still-hunting, and the head of them, one Rogers, was in the middle
of that place, and there he died, no one could say how, though some of
his men were round about him.

That's a nice flat clean place that rock we're passing--that's the sort
of place they'd be seen dancing or having their play.

A Piper:

I knew twin sons, Considines, and one was struck with madness in
England, and one at home--Pat in England Mike in Connacht--at the one
time. Both were sent to Ballinasloe Asylum, and got well in eight
months, and that was ten year ago, and one of them is married and
rearing a family. The mother used to be doing cures with herbs; it is
likely that is the reason but she gave it up after they were struck.

There were three of another family went in to the Asylum, one this year,
one next year, and one the year after, and no reason but that their
house was close to the side of a forth.

Maurteen Joyce:

When I was in Clare there was a forth, and two or three men went down it
one time, and brought rushes and lights with them. And they came to
where there was a woman washing at a river and they heard the crying of
young lambs, and it November, for when we have winter, there is summer
there. So they got afraid, and two of the men came back, but one of them
stopped there and was never heard of after. The best of things they
have, and no trouble at all but to be eating; but they have no chance of
being saved till the Day of Judgment.

I knew another forth that two men watched, and at night there came out
of it two troops of horses, and they began to graze. But when the men
came near them they made for the forths, and all they got was a foal.
And they kept it, and it was a mare-horse, and it had foals, and the
breed was the best that was ever seen m the country.

Mrs. Leary:

There did strange things happen in that wood, noises would be heard, and
those that went in to steal rods could never get them up on their back
to bring them away. But there was one man said whatever happened he'd
bring them, and he got them on to his back, and then they were lifted
off it over the wood. But they fell again and he got them and carried
them away; I suppose they thought well of him having so much courage.

Cruachmaa is the great place for them.

A man who had lost a blood mare met an old man from a forth who said
"Put your right foot on my right foot." And he did so, and at once he
saw the blood mare and his foal close by.

The Old Man Who Is Making a Well:

There was a man and his wife was brought away at Cruachmaa and he was
told to go dig, and he'd get her out. And he began to dig, and when he
had a hole made at the side of the hill he saw her coming out, but he
couldn't stop the pick that he had lifted for the stroke, and it went
through her head.

J. Doran:

Whether they are in it or not, there are many tell stories of them. And
I often saw the half of Cruachmaa covered--like as if there was a mist
on it.

But one side of a wall is luckier than another, all the old people will
tell you that there was a big Stone in the yard behind our house and my
husband thought to blast it, for it was in the way, and my mother said
"I'm in the house longer than you, and take my advice and never touch
that stone," and he never did. But there was a man built a house close
by and he wanted to close a passage, and one morning he came early and
was laying hands on that stone to take it. But I was out when I heard
him and drove him away. And the house never throve with him, he lost two
or three children, and then he died himself.

A Gate-keeper:

At St. Patrick's well at Burren there used to be a great pattern every
year. And every year there was something lost and killed at it, a horse
or a man or a woman.

So at last the priest put a stop to it. And there was an old woman with
me in the barracks at Burren, and she told me she remembered well when
she was a young girl and the time came when the pattern used to be, the
first year it was stopped her father put her up on a big high wall near
the well, and bid her look down. And there she saw the whole place hill
of the gentry, and they playing and dancing and having their own games,
they were in such joy to have done away with the pattern. I suppose the
well belonged to them before it got the name of St. Patrick.

There's a small little house not far down the road where they used to be
very fond of going. And a woman in the town asked the old woman that
lived in it what did they look like. And she said "For all the world
like people coming in to Chapel."

There was a girl coming back here one time from Clough, and instead of
coming here she went the Esserkelly road and was led astray and a man
met her and says he, "why do you say you're going to Labane and it's to
Roxborough you're facing?" and he turned her around. And when she got
home she took off the bundle she had on her back, and what jumped out of
it but a young hare.

Mrs. Casey:

I have a great little story about a woman--a jobber's wife that lived a
mile beyond Ardrahan. She had business one time in Ballyvaughan, and
when she was on the road beyond Kinvara a man came to her out of a forth
and he asked her to go in and to please a child that was crying. So she
went in and she pleased the child, and she saw in a corner an old man
that never stopped from crying. And when she went out again she asked
the man that brought her in, why was the old man roaring and crying. The
man pointed to a milch cow in the meadow and he said, "Before the day is
over he will be in the place of that cow, and it will be brought into
the forth to give milk to the child." And she can tell herself that was
true, for in the evening when she was coming back from Ballyvaughan, she
saw in that field a cow dead, and being cut in pieces, and all the poor
people bringing away bits of it, that was the old man that had been put
in its place. There is poison in that meat, but no poison ever comes off
the fire, but you must mind to throw away the top of the pot.

The forth where I heard the talking long ago, and left my can, it's only
the other day I was telling Pat Stephens of it that has the land. And he
told me he put a trough in it to catch the water about a month ago. And
the next day one of his best bullocks died.

Mrs. O'Brien:

It's a bad piece of the road that poor boy fell off his cart at and was
killed. There's a forth near it, and it's in that forth my five children
are that were swept from me. I went and I told Father Carey I knew they
were there, and he said "Say your prayers, my poor woman, that's all you
can do." When they were young they were small and thin enough, they grew
up like a bunch of rushes, but they got strong and stout and
good-looking. Too good they were, so that everyone would remark them and
would say, "Oh, look at Ellen O'Brien-look at Catherine--look at Martin!
So good to work and so handsome, so loyal to their mother." And they
were all taken from me, it never was in my family or in the father's,
and how would they all gone now but one. Consumption they were said to
get, but get it without some provocation? Four of them died with that,
and Martin was drowned. One of the little girls was in America and the
other at home, and they both got sick, and at the end of nine months
both of them died.

Only twice they got a warning. Michael that was the first to go was out
one morning very early to bring a letter to Mr. Crowe. And he met on the
road a small little woman, and she came across him and across him again,
and then again, as if to be humbugging him. And he got afraid, and told
me about her when he got home. And not long after that he died.

And Ellen used to be going to milk the cow for the nuns morning and
evening, and there's a place she had to pass, a sort of enchanted place,
I forget the name of it. And when she came home one evening she said
she'd go there no more, for when she was passing that place she saw a
small little woman, with a little cloak about her, and her face not the
size of a doll's face. And with the one look of her she got a fright and
ran as fast as she could, and sat down to milk the cow. And when she was
milking she looked up, and there was the small little woman coming along
by the wall. And she said she'd never like to go up there again. So to
move the thought out of her mind I said "Sure that's the little woman is
stopping up at Shamus Mor's house." "Oh, it's not, Mother," said she; "I
know well by her look she was no right person." "Then my poor girl
you're lost," says I, "for I know it was the same woman that my husband
saw." And sure enough, it was but a few weeks after that she died. There
wasn't much change in them before their death, but there was a great
change after.

And Martin, the last that went, was stout and strong and nothing ailed
him, but he was drowned. He'd go down some-times to bathe in the sea and
one day he said he was going, and I said, "Do not, for you have no
swim."

But a boy of the neighbours came after that and called to him, and I was
making the little dinner for him, and I didn't see him from the door.
And I never knew he was gone till when I went out of the house the girl
from next door looked at me some way strange, and then she told me two
boys were drowned, and then she told me one of them was my own. Held
down he was, they said, by something under water. *They* had him
followed there.

It wasn't long after he died I woke one night and I felt some one near,
and I struck the light and then I saw his shadow. He was wearing his
little cap but under it I knew his face and the colour of his hair. And
he never spoke and he was going out the door and I called to him and
said "Oh, Martin, come back to me and I'll always be watching for you."
And every night after that I'd hear things thrown about the house
outside, and noises. So I got afraid to stop in it, and went to live in
another house, and I told the priest I knew Martin was not dead but that
he was living. And about eight weeks after Catherine dying, I had what I
thought was a dream. I thought I dreamt that I saw her sweeping out the
floor of the room, and I said, "Catherine, why are you sweeping? Sure
you know I sweep the floor down and the hearth every night." And I said
"Tell me where you are now?" And she said, "I'm in the forth beyond."
And she said "I have a great deal of things to tell you, but I must look
out and see are they watching me"; now wasn't that very sharp for a
dream? And she went to look out the door, but she never came back again.

And in the morning when I told it to a few respectable people they said
"Take care but it might have been no dream, but her-self that came back
and talked to you." And I think it was, and that she came back to see
me, and to keep the place well swept.

Sure we know there were some in the forths in the old times, for my
aunt's husband was brought away into one, and why wouldn't they be there
now? He was sent back out of it again; a girl led him home, and she told
him he was brought away because he answered to the first call and that
he had a right only to answer to the third. But he didn't want to come
home. He said he saw more people in it than he ever saw at a hurling,
and that he'd ask no better place than it in high heaven.

The Banshee always cries for the O'Briens. And Anthony O'Brien was a
fine man when I married him, and handsome, and I could have had great
marriages if I didn't choose him, and many wondered at me. And when he
was took ill and in the bed, Johnny Rafferty came in one day, and says
he "Is Anthony living?" and I said he was. "For," says he, "as I was
passing, I heard crying, crying, from the hill where the forths are, and
I thought it must be for Anthony, and that he was gone." And then Ellen,
the little girl came running in, and she says, "I heard the mournfullest
crying that ever you heard just behind the house." And I said "It must
be the Banshee." And Anthony heard me say that where he was lying in the
bed, and he called out, "If it's the Banshee it's for me, and I must die
today or tomorrow." And in the middle of the next day, he died.

One time I was passing by a forth down there, and I saw a thick smoke
coming out of it, straight up it went and then it spread at the top. And
when it was clearing away I saw two rows of birds, one on the one side
and one on the other, and I stopped to look at them. They were white,
and had shoulders and heads like dogs, and there was a great noise like
a rattling, and a man that was passing by looked up and said "God speed
you," and they flew away.

A Seaside Man:

There were five boys of the Callinans, and they rich and well-to-do,
were out in a boat, and a ship came out from the shore and touched it
and it sank, and the ship was seen no more. And one of the boys held on
to the boat, and some men came out and brought him to land. But the
second time after that he went out, he was swept.

An Old Man in Gort Workhouse:

I knew an old man was in here was greatly given to card-playing. And one
night he was up on the hill beyond, towards Slieve Echtge, where there
is a big forth, and he went into it, and there he found a lot of them
playing cards. Like any other card-players they looked, and he sat down
and played with them, and they played fair. And when he woke in the
morning, he was lying outside on the hill, and nothing under his head
but a tuft of rushes.

John Mangan:

Old Hanrahan one time went out to the forth that's in front of his house
and cut a bush, and he a fresh man enough. And next morning he hadn't a
blade of hair on his head-not a blade. And he had to buy a wig and to
wear it for the rest of his life. I remember him and the wig well.

And it was some years after that that Delane, the father of the great
cricketer, was passing by that way, and the water had risen and he
strayed off the road into it. And as he got farther and farther in, till
he was covered to better than his waist, he heard like the voice of his
wife crying, "Go on, John, go on farther." And he called out, "These are
John Hanrahan's faeries that took the hair off him." "And what did you
do then?" they asked him when he got safe to the house, and was telling
this. And he said, "I turned my coat inside out, and after that they
troubled me no more, and so I got safe to the road again." But no one
ever had luck that meddled with a forth, so it's always said.

There's Mrs. Lynch's daughter was coming through the trees about eight
months ago and when she came to a thicket of bushes, a short little man
came out, about three feet high, dressed all in white, and he white
himself or grey, and asked her to come with him, and she ran away as
fast as she could. And with the fright she got, she fell into a
sickness-what they call the sickness of Peter and Paul--and you'd think
she'd tear the house down when it comes on her.

I met a woman some time ago told me more about the forths in this place
than ever I knew before, and well she might for she had passed seven
years in them, working, working, minding children and the like all the
time; no singing or dancing for her.

M. Haverty:

There was one Rock, was brought into a forth. A three-legged horse came
for him one night and brought him away; and when he got there they all
called him by his name.

There was a man up there cut a tree in one of them, and he was took ill
immediately after, and didn't live long.

There's a bad bit of road near Kinvara Chapel, just when you get within
sight of the sea. I know a man has to pass there, and he wouldn't go on
the driver's side of the car, for it's to the right side those things
are to be seen. Sure there was a boy lost his life falling off a car
there last Friday week.

One night passing the big tree at Raheen I heard the sound of a handsaw
in the air, and I looked up and there in the top of a larch tree that's
near to a beech I saw a man sitting and cutting it with the handsaw. So
I hurried away home. But the next time I passed that way I took a view
of it to see might it have been one of the Dillons that might be
stealing timber; and there was no sign of a cut or a touch in it at all.

There was a man on the road between Chevy and Marble Hill, where there
is a faery plumb-stone, that stands straight up and it about five feet
in height, and the man was building a house and carried it away to put
above his door. And from the time he brought it away, all his stock
began to die, and whenever he went in or out, night or day, he was
severely beaten. So at last he took the stone down and put it back where
it was before, and from that time nothing has troubled him.

John Mangan:

Myself and two of my brothers were over at Inchy Weir to catch a horse,
and growing close by the water there was a bush the form of an umbrella,
very close and thick at the top. So we began fooling as boys do, and I
said, "I'll bet a button none of you will make a stone go through the
bush." So I took up a pebble of cow-dung and threw it, and they all
threw, and no sooner did the pebble hit the bush than there came from it
music, like a band playing. So we all ran for our lives, and when we had
got about two hundred yards we looked back and we saw something moving
round the bush, first it had the clothes of a woman and then of a man.
So we stopped to see no more.

Well, it was some years after that when Sir William ordered all the
bushes in that part to be cut down. And one Prendergast a boy that used
to be a beater here and that went to America after, went to cut them
just in the same place where I had seen that sight, and a thorn ran into
his eye and blinded him, and he never got the sight of it again.

An Old Woman near Ballinsloe:

There are many forths around, and in that one beyond, there is often
music heard. The smith's father heard the music one time he was passing
and he could not stop from dancing till he was tired. I heard him tell
that myself.

And over there to the left there is a forth had an opening in it, and
the steward wanted to get it closed up, and he could get no men to do
it. And at last a young man said he would, and he went to work and at
the end of the week he was dead.

And there was a girl milking a cow not long after that, and she saw him
coming to her, and she ran away, and he called to her to stop and she
did not, and he said "That you may never milk another cow!" And within a
week, she herself was dead.

There was a woman over there in that house you can see, and she wanted
to root up a forth; covetousness it was, she had plenty and she wanted
more. And she tried to get a man to do it and she could not, but at last
a man that had been turned out of his holding, and that was in want,
said he would do it. And before he went to work he went on his two
knees, and he wished that whatever harm might come from it might come on
her, and not on himself. And so it did, and her hands got crippled and
crappled. And they travelled the world and could get no relief for her,
and her cattle began to die, and she died herself in the end. And the
daughter and the son-in-law had to leave that house and to build
another, for they were losing all the cattle, and they are left alone
now, but the daughter lost a finger by it.

A Man near Corcomroe:

I saw a light myself one night in the big forth over there near the sea.
Like a bonfire it was) and going up about thirty feet into the air.

Ghosts are to be heard about the forths. They make a heavy noise, and
there are creaks in their shoes. Doing a penance I suppose they are. And
there's many see the lights in the forths at Newtown.

J. Doheny:

One time I was cutting bushes up there near the river, and I cut a big
thorn bush, I thought it no harm to do it when it wasn't standing by
itself, but m a thicket, and it old and half-rotten. And when I had it
cut, I heard some one talking very loud to my wife, that was gathering
kippeens down in the field the other side of the wall. And I went down
to know who it was self some one was talking, for I heard his voice
where you were, talking to her. And when I asked her she said "No, it's
to yourself someone was talking, for I heard his voice where you were,
and I saw no one." So I said, "Surely it's one of them mourning for the
bush I cut," for the sound of his voice was as if he was mad vexed.

I think it's not in the tree at the corner there's anything, it's
something in the place. Not long ago there was one Greeley going to
Galway with a load of barley, and when he came to that corner he heard
the sound of a train crossing from inside the wall, and the horse
stopped. And then he heard it a second time and the horse refused to go
on, and at the end he had to turn back home again, for he had no use
trying to make the horse go on.

There were ash trees growing around the blessed well at Corker, and one
night Deeley, the uncle of Pat Deeley that lives beyond, and two other
men went to cut them down, to get the makings of a car-body. And the
next day Deeley's lip was drawn down--like this--and water running from
it for the rest of his life. I often see him; and as to the two other
men, they died soon after.

And big Joyce that was a servant to John O'Hara, he went to cut trees
one night near that hole at Raheen, near the corner of the road, and he
was prevented, and never could get the handsaw near a tree, nor the
other men that were with him.

And there was another man went and cut a bush not far from the Kinvara
road, and with the first stroke he heard a sort of a cough or a groan
come from beneath it, that was a token to him to leave it alone. But he
wouldn't leave off, and his mouth was drawn to one side all of a sudden
and in two days after he was dead. Surely, one should leave such things
alone.

A Piper:

I had a fall myself in Galway the other day that I couldn't move my arm
to play the pipes if you gave me Ireland. And a man said to me--and they
are very smart people in Gaiway that two or three got a fall and a hurt
in that same place. "There is places in the sea where there is
drowning," he said, "and places on the land as well where there do be
accidents, and no man can save himself from them, for it is the will of
God."

A Man Asking Alms:

It's not safe sometimes to meddle with walls. There was a man beyond
Gort knocked some old walls not long ago, and he's dead since.

But it's by the big tree outside Raheen where you take the turn to
Kinvara that the most things are seen. There was a boy living with Conor
in Gort that was out before daylight with a load of hay in a cart, and
he sitting on top of it, and he was found lying dead just beside the
tree, where he fell from the top of the cart, and the horse was standing
there stock-still. There was a shower of rain fell while he was lying
there, and I passed the road two hours later, and saw where the dust was
dry where his body had been lying. And it was only yesterday I was
hearing a story of that very same place. There was a man coming from
Galway with a ton weight of a load on his cart, and when he carne to
that tree the linching of his wheel came out, and the cart fell down.
And presently a little man, about two and a half feet in height, came
out from the wall and lifted up the cart, and held it up till he had the
linching put up again. And he never said a word but went away as he
came, and the man came into Gort. And I remember myself, the black and
white dog used to be on the road between Hanlon's gate and Gort. It was
there for ten years and no one ever saw it, but one evening Father
Boyle's man was going out to look at a few little sheep and lambs
belonging to the priest, and when he came to the stile the dog put up
its paws on it and looked at him, and he was afraid to go on. So next
morning he told Father Boyle about it and he said "I think that you
won't see it any more." And sure enough from that day it never was seen
again.

Steve Simon:

I don't know did I draw down to you before, your ladyship, the greatest
wonder ever I saw in my life?

I was passing by the forth at Corcomroe, coming back from some shopping
I had done in Belharbour, and I saw twelve of the finest horses ever I
saw, and riders on them racing round the forth. Many a race I saw since
I lived in this world, but never a race like that, for tipping and
tugging and welting the horses; the jockeys in coloured clothes, striped
and blue, and little blue caps on them, and a lady in the front of them
on a bayish horse and wearing a scarlet jacket.

I told what I saw the same evening to an old woman living near and she
said, "Whatever you saw keep it secret, or some harm will come upon
you." There was another thing I saw besides the riders. There were
crowds and crowds of people, standing as we would against walls or on a
stage, and taking a view. They were shouting, but the men racing on the
horses said nothing at all. Never a race like that one, with the
swiftness and I the welting and fine horses that were in it.

What clothing had these people? They had coats on them, and on their
back there were pictures, pictures in the form of people. Shields I
think they were. Anyway there were pictures on them. Striped the coats
were, and a sort of scollop on them the same as that screen in the
window (a blind with Celtic design). They had little blue caps, such as
wore them, but some had nothing on the head at all; and they had blue
slippers--those I saw of them--but I was afeared to take more than a
side view except of the racers.

An Old Army Man:

You know the forth where the old man lost his hair? Well there's another
man, Waters, that married Brian's sister, has the second sight, and
there's a big bush left in that forth, and when he goes there he sees a
woman sitting under it, and she lighting a fire.

Cloran's father was living over at Knockrnaa one time and his wife died,
and he believed it was taken into the hill she was. So he went one
morning and dug a hole in the side of the hill. But the next morning
when he went back to dig again, the ho\]e was filled up and the grass
growing over it as before. And this he did two or three times. And then
some one told him to put his pick and his spade across the hole. And so
he did, and it wasn't filled up again. But what happened after I don't
know.

An Old Army Man:

That's a bad bit of road near Kinvara where the boy lost his life last
week; I know it well, And I knew him, a quiet boy, and married to a
widow woman; she wanted the help of a man, and he was young. What would
ail him to fall off the side of an ass-car and to be killed?
