# Butter

 

I have been told:

Butter, that's a thing that's very much meddled with. On the first of
May before sunrise it's very apt to be all taken away out of the milk.
And if ever you lend your churn or your dishes to your neighbour, she'll
be able to wish away your butter after that There was a woman used to
lend a drop of milk to the woman that lived next door, and one day she
was churning, churning, and no butter came. And at last some person came
into the house and said, "It's hard for you to have butter here, and if
you want to know where it is, look into the next house." So she went in
and there was her neighbour letting on to be churning in a quart bottle,
and rolls of butter beside her. So she made as if to choke her, and the
woman run out into the garden and picked some mullein leaves, and said,
"Put these leaves in under your churn, and you'll find your butter come
back again." And so she did. And she found it all in the churn after.

To sprinkle a few drops of holy water about the churn, and to put a coal
of fire under it, that you should always do--as was always done in the
old time--and the *others* will never touch it.

There was a woman in the town was churning, and when the butter came she
went out of the house to bring some water for to wash it and to make it
up. And there was a tailor sitting sewing on the table. And the woman
from next door came in and asked the loan of a coal of fire, and that's
a thing that's never refused from one poor person to another in the
morning. So he bid her take it. And presently she came in again and said
that the coal of fire had gone out, and asked another, and this she did
the third time. But the tailor knew well what she was doing, and that
every coal of fire she brought away, there was a roll of butter out of
the chum went with it. So whatever prayers he said is not known, but he
brought the butter all back again, and into a can on the floor, and no
hands ever touched it So when the woman of the house came back, "There's
your butter in the can," said he. And she wondered how it came out of
the churn to be in three rolls in the can. And then he told her all that
had happened.

There was a man was churning, churning, every day and no butter would
come only froth. So some wise woman told him to go before sunrise to a
running stream and bring a bottle of the water from it. And so he did
before sunrise, and had to go near four miles to it And from that day he
had rolls and rolls of butter coming every time he churned.

There was one Burke, he knew how to bring it back out of some old Irish
book that has disappeared since he died. There was a woman, a herd's
wife, lived beyond, and one time Burke had his own butter taken, and he
said he knew a way to find who had done it, and he brought in the
coulter of the plough and put it in the fire. And when it began to get
red hot, this woman came running, and fell on her knees, for it was she
did it. And after that he never lost his butter again. But she took to
her bed and was there for years until her death. And she couldn't turn
from one side to another without some person to lift her. Her son is now
living in Dublin, and is the President of some Association.

If a woman in Aran is milking a cow and the milk is spilled, she says,
"There's some are the better for it," and I think it a very nice
thought, that they don't grudge it if there is any one it does good to.

There was a man, one Finnegan, had the knowledge how to bring it back.
And one time Lanigan that lives below at Kilgarvan had all his butter
taken and the milk nothing but froth rising to the top of the pail like
barm. So he went to Finnegan and he bid him get the coulter of the
plough, and a shoe of the wickedest horse that could be found and some
other thing, I forget what. So he brought in the coulter of the plough,
and his brother-in-law chanced to have a horse that was so wicked it
took three men to hold him, and no one could get on his back. So he got
a shoe off of him. But just at that time, Lanigan's wife went to
confession, and what did she do but to tell the priest what they were
doing to get back the butter. So the priest was mad with them, and bid
them to leave such things alone. And when Finnegan heard it he said,
"What call had she to go and confess that? Let her get back her own
butter for herself any more, for I'll do nothing to help her."

Grass makes a difference? So it may, but believe me that's not all. I've
been myself in the County Limerick, where the grass is that rich you
could grease your boots in it, and I heard them say there, one quart of
cream ought to bring one pound of butter. And it never does. And where
does the rest go to?
