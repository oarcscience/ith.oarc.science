# Part II Book VIII: Ailne's Revenge

ONE day Finn and his people were hunting on Slieve Fuad, and a stag
stood against them for a while and fought with his great rough horns,
and then he turned and ran, and the Fianna followed after him till they
came to the green hill of Liadhas, and from that to rocky Cairgin. And
there they lost him again for a while, till Sceolan started him again,
and he went back towards Slieve Fuad, and the Fianna after him.

But Finn and Daire of the Songs, that were together, went astray and
lost the rest of their people, and they did not know was it east or west
they were going.

Finn sounded the Dord Fiann then, and Daire played some sorrowful music
to let their people know where they were. But when the Fianna heard the
music, it seemed to be a long way off; and sometimes they thought it was
in the north it was, and sometimes in the east, and then it changed to
the west, the way they did not know in the wide world where was it
coming from.

And as to Finn and Daire, a Druid mist came about them, and they did not
know what way they were going.

And after a while they met with a young woman, comely and pleasant, and
they asked who was she, and what brought her there. "Glanluadh is my
name," she said, "and my husband is Lobharan; and we were travelling
over the plain together a while ago, and we heard the cry of hounds, and
he left me and went after the bunt, and I do not know where is he, or
what way did he go." "Come on then with us," said Finn, "and we will
take care of you, for we ourselves do not know what way the hunt is
gone, east or west." So they went on, and before long they came to a
hill, and they heard sleepy music of the Sidhe beside them. And after
that there came shouts and noises, and then the music began again, and
heavy sleep came on Finn and Daire. And when they awoke from their sleep
they saw a very large lighted house before them, and a stormy blue sea
around it. Then they saw a very big grey man coming through the waves,
and he took hold of Finn and of Daire, and all their strength went from
them, and he brought them across the waves and into the house, and he
shut the door of the house with iron books. "My welcome to you, Finn of
the great name," be said then in a very harsh voice; "it is long we are
waiting here for you."

They sat down then on the hard side of a bed, and the woman of the house
came to them, and they knew her to be Ailne, wife of Meargach. "It is
long I am looking for you, Finn," she said, "to get satisfaction for the
treachery you did on Meargach and on my two comely young sons, and on
Tailc, son of Treon, and all his people. And do you remember that,
Finn?" she said. "I remember well," said Finn, "that they fell by the
swords of the Fianna, not by treachery but in fighting." "It was by
treachery they fell," said the Grey Man then; "and it is our witness to
it, pleasant Ailne to be the way she is, and many a strong army under
grief on account of her." "What is Ailne to you, man of the rough
voice?" said Finn. "I am her own brother," said the man.

With that he put bonds on the three, Finn and Daire and Glanluadh, and
he put them down into some deep shut place.

They were very sorrowful then, and they stopped there to the end of five
days and five nights, without food, without drink, without music.

And Ailne went to see them then, and Finn said to her: "O Ailne," he
said, "bring to mind the time you came to Cnoc-an-Air, and the way the
Fianna treated you with generosity; and it is not fitting for you," he
said, "to keep us now under shame and weakness and in danger of death."
"I know well I got kind treatment from Grania," said Ailne in a
sorrowful voice; "but for all that, Finn," she said, "if all the Fianna
were in that prison along with you under hard bonds, it would please me
well, and I would not pity their case. And what is it set you following
after Finn," she said then to Glanluadh, "for that is not a fitting
thing for you to do, and his own kind wife living yet."

Then Glanluadh told her the whole story, and how she was walking the
plain with Lobharan her husband, and he followed the hunt, and the mist
came about her that she did not know east from west, and how she met
then with Finn that she never saw before that time. "If that is so,"
said Ailne, "it is not right for you to be under punishment without
cause."

She called then to her brother the Grey Man, and bade him take the
spells off Glanluadh. And when she was set free it is sorry she was to
leave Daire in bonds, and Finn. And when she had bidden them farewell
she went out with Ailne, and there was food brought to her, but a cloud
of weakness came on her of a sudden, that it was a pity to see the way
she was.

And when Ailne saw that, she brought out an enchanted cup of the Sidhe
and gave her a drink from it. And no sooner did Glanluadh drink from the
cup than her strength and her own appearance came back to her again; but
for all that, she was fretting after Finn and Daire in their bonds. "It
seems to me, Glanluadh, you are fretting after those two men," said
Ailne. "I am sorry indeed," said Glanluadh, "the like of those men to be
shut up without food or drink." "If it is pleasing to you to give them
food you may give it," said Ailne, "for I will not make an end of them
till I see can I get the rest of the Fianna into bonds along with them."
The two women brought food and drink then to Finn, and to Daire; and
Glanluadh gave her blessing to Finn, and she cried when she saw the way
he was; but as to Ailne, she had no pity at all for the King of the
Fianna.

Now as to the Grey Man, he heard them talking of the Fianna, and they
were saying that Daire had a great name for the sweetness of his music.
"I have a mind to hear that sweet music," said he. So he went to the
place where they were, and he bade Daire to let him hear what sort of
music he could make. "My music pleased the Fianna well," said Daire;
"but I think it likely it would not please you." "Play it for me now,
till I know if the report I heard of you is true," said the Grey Man.
"Indeed, I have no mind for music," said Daire, "being weak and
downhearted the way I am, through your spells that put down my courage."
"I will take my spells off you for so long as you play for me," said the
Grey Man. "I could never make music seeing Finn in bonds the way he is,"
said Daire; "for it is worse to me, he to be under trouble than myself."
"I will take the power of my spells off Finn till you play for me," said
the Grey Man.

He weakened the spells then, and gave them food and drink, and it
pleased him greatly the way Daire played the music, and he called to
Glanluadh and to Ailne to come and to listen to the sweetness of it. And
they were well pleased with it, and it is glad Glanluadh was, seeing
them not so discouraged as they were.

Now as to the Fianna, they were searching for Finn and for Daire in
every place they had ever stopped in. And when they came to this place
they could hear Daire's sweet music; and at first they were glad when
they heard it, and then when they knew the way he himself and Finn were,
they made an attack on Ailne's dun to release them.

But the Grey Man heard their shouts, and he put the full power of his
spells again on Finn and on Daire. And the Fianna heard the music as if
stammering, and then they heard a great noise like the loud roaring of
waves, and when they heard that, there was not one of them but fell into
a sleep and clouds of death, under those sorrowful spells.

And then the Grey Man and Ailne came out quietly from where they were,
and they brought the whole of the men of the Fianna that were there into
the dun. And they put hard bonds on them, and put them where Finn and
Daire were. And there was great grief on Finn and Daire when they saw
them, and they were all left there together for a while.

Then Glanluadh said to the Grey Man: "If Daire's music is pleasing to
you, let him play it to us now." "If you have a mind for music," said
the Grey Man, "Daire must play it for us, and for Finn and his army as
well."

They went then to where they were, and bade Daire to play. "I could
never play sweet music," said Daire, "the time the Fianna are in any
trouble; for when they are in trouble, I myself am in trouble, and I
could not sound any sweet string," he said, "while there is trouble on
any man of them." The Grey Man weakened the spells on them all, and
Daire played first the strings of sweetness, and of the noise of
shouting, and then he sang his own grief and the grief of all the
Fianna. And at that the Grey Man said it would not be long before he
would put the whole of the Fianna to death; and then Daire played a tune
of heavy shouts of lamentation. And then at Finn's bidding he played the
music of sweet strings for the Fianna.

They were kept, now, a long time in that prison, and they got very hard
treatment; and sometimes Ailne's brother would come in and strike the
heads off some of them, for none of them could rise up from the seats
they were sitting on through his enchantments. But one time he was going
to strike the bald head off Conan and Conan made a great leap from the
seat; but if he did, he left strips of his skin hanging to it, that his
back was left bare. And then he came round the Grey Man with his pitiful
words: "Stop your hand now," he said, "for that is enough for this time;
and do not send me to my death yet awhile, and heal me of my wounds
first," he said, "before you make an end of me." And the reason he said
that was because he knew Ailne to have an enchanted cup in the dun, that
had cured Glanluadh.

And the Grey Man took pity on his case, and he brought him out and bade
Ailne to bring the cup to him and cure his wounds. "I will not bring
it," said Ailne, "for it would be best give no time at all to him or to
the Fianna, but to make an end of them." "It is not to be saved from
death I am asking, bright-faced Ailne," said Conan, "but only not go to
my death stripped bare the way I am." When Ailne heard that, she brought
a sheepskin and she put it on Conan's back, and it fitted and grew to
him, and covered his wounds. "I will not put you to death, Conan," said
the Grey Man then, "but you can stop with myself to the end of your
life." "You will never be without grief and danger and the fear of
treachery if you keep him with you," said Ailne; "for there is treachery
in his heart the same as there is in the rest of them." "There is no
fear of that," said her brother, "for I will make no delay until I put
the whole of the Fianna to death." And with that he brought Conan to
where the enchanted cup was, and he put it in his hand. And just at that
moment they heard Daire playing very sweet sorrowful music, and the Grey
Man went to listen to it, very quick and proud. And Conan followed him
there, and after a while the Grey Man asked him what did he do with the
enchanted cup. "I left it where I found it, full of power," said Conan.

The Grey Man hurried back then to the place where the treasures of the
dun were. But no sooner was he gone than Conan took out the cup that he
had hidden, and he gave a drink from it to Finn and to Osgar and to the
rest of the Fianna. And they that were withered and shaking, without
strength, without courage, got back their own appearance and their
strength again on the moment.

And when the Grey Man came back from looking for the cup, and saw what
had happened, he took his sword and made a stroke at Conan. But Conan
called to Osgar to defend him, and Osgar attacked the Grey Man, and it
was not long till he made him acquainted with death.

And when Ailne saw that, with the grief and the dread that came on her,
she fell dead then and there.

Then all the Fianna made a feast with what they found of food and of
drink, and they were very joyful and merry. But when they rose up in the
morning, there was no trace or tidings of the dun, but it was on the
bare grass they were lying.

But as to Conan, the sheepskin never left him; and the wool used to grow
on it every year, the same as it would on any other skin.
