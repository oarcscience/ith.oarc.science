# Part II Book VI: How Diarmuid Got His Love-Spot

DIARMUID and Conan and Goll and Osgar went one day hunting, and they
went so far they could not get home in the evening, and they spent the
first part of the night walking through the woods and pulling berries
and eating them. And when it was about midnight they saw a light, and
they went towards i; and they found a little house before them, and the
light shining from it They went in then, and they saw an old man there,
and he bade them welcome, and he called them all by their names. And
they saw no one in the house but the old man and a young girl and a cat.
And the old man bade the girl to make food ready for the Fianna of
Ireland, for there was great hunger on them.

And when the food was ready and put on the table, there came a great
wether that was fastened up in the back of the house, and he rose up on
the table where they were eating, and when they saw that, they looked at
one another. "Rise up, Conan," said Goll, "and fasten that wether in the
place it was before." Conan rose up and took hold of it, but the wether
gave itself a shake that threw Conan under one of its feet. The rest
were looking at that, and Goll said: "Let you rise up, Diarmuid, and
fasten up the wether." So Diarmuid rose up and took hold of it, but it
gave itself a shake the same way as before; and when Diarmuid was down
it put one of its feet on him. Goll and Osgar looked at one another
then, and shame came on them, a wether to have done so much as that. And
Osgar got up, but the wether put him down under one of his feet, so that
it had now the three men under him. Then Goll rose up and took hold of
it and threw it down; but if he did, it rose up again in spite of him,
and put Goll under his fourth foot.

"It is a great shame," said the old man then, "the like of that to be
done to the Fianna of Ireland. And rise up now, cat," he said, "and tie
the wether in the place where he was." The cat rose up then and took
hold of the wether, and brought it over and tied it in its place at the
end of the house.

The men rose up then, but they had no mind to go on eating, for there
was shame on them at what the wether had done to them. "You may go on
eating," said the old man; "and when you are done I will show you that
now you are the bravest men of the world." So they ate their fill then,
and the old man spoke to them, and it is what he said: "Goll," he said,
"you are the bravest of all the men of the world, for you have wrestled
with the world and you threw it down. The strength of the world is in
the wether, but death will come to the world itself; and that is death,"
he said, showing them the cat.

They were talking together then, and they had their food eaten, and the
old man said their beds were ready for them that they could go to sleep.
The four of them went then into the one room, and when they were in
their beds the young girl came to sleep in the same room with them, and
the light of her beauty was shining on the walls like as if it was the
light of a candle.

And when Conan saw her he went over to the side of the bed where she
was.

Now, it was Youth the young girl was, and when she saw Conan coming to
her: "Go back to your bed, Conan," she said; "I belonged to you once,
and I will never belong to you again." Conan went back to his bed then,
and Osgar had a mind to go over where she was. Then she said to him:
"Where are you going?" "I am going over to yourself for a while," said
he.

"Go back again, Osgar," she said; "I belonged to you once, and I will
never belong to you again."

Then Diarmuid rose up to go to her: "Where are you going, Diarmuid?" she
said. "I am going over to yourself for a while," said he. "O Diarmuid,"
she said, "that cannot be; I belonged to you once, and I can never
belong to you again; but come over here to me, Diarmuid," she said, "and
I will put a love-spot on you, that no woman will ever see without
giving you her love." So Diarmuid went over to her, and she put her hand
on his forehead, and she left the love-spot there, and no woman that
ever saw him after that was able to refuse him her love.
