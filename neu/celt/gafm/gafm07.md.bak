# Part I Book III: The Great Battle of Magh Tuireadh

AND it was not long after Lugh had got the fine from the sons of
Tuireann that the Fomor came and landed at Scetne.

The whole host of the Fomor were come this time, and their king, Balor,
of the Strong Blows and of the Evil Eye, along with them; and Bres, and
Indech, son of De Domnann, a king of the Fomor, and Elathan, son of
Lobos, and Goll and Ingol, and Octriallach, son of Indech, and Elathan,
son of Delbaeth.

Then Lugh sent the Dagda to spy out the Fomor, and to delay them till
such time as the men of Ireland would come to the battle.

So the Dagda went to their camp, and he asked them for a delay, and they
said he might have that. And then to make sport of him, the Fomor made
broth for him, for he had a great love for broth. So they filled the
king's cauldron with four times twenty gallons of new milk, and the same
of meal and fat, and they put in goats and sheep and pigs along with
that, and boiled all together, and then they poured it all out into a
great hole in the ground. And they called him to it then, and told him
he should eat his fill, the way the Fomor would not be reproached for
want of hospitality the way Bres was. "We will make an end of you if you
leave any part of it after you," said Indech, son of De Domnann.

So the Dagda took the ladle, and it big enough for a man and a woman to
lie in the bowl of it, and he took out bits with it, the half of a
salted pig, and a quarter of lard a bit would be. "If the broth tastes
as well as the bits taste, this is good food," he said. And he went on
putting the full of the ladle into his mouth till the hole was empty;
and when all was gone he put down his hand and scraped up all that was
left among the earth and the gravel.

Sleep came on him then after eating the broth, and the Fomor were
laughing at him, for his belly was the size of the cauldron of a great
house. But he rose up after a while, and, heavy as he was, he made his
way home; and indeed his dress was no way sightly, a cape to the hollow
of the elbows, and a brown coat, long in the breast and short behind,
and on his feet brogues of horse hide, with the hair outside, and in his
hand a wheeled fork it would take eight men to carry, so that the track
he left after him was deep enough for the boundary ditch of a province.
And on his way he saw the Battle-Crow, the Morrigu, washing herself in
the river Unius of Connacht, and one of her two feet at Ullad Echne, to
the south of the water, and the other at Loscuinn, to the north of the
water, and her hair hanging in nine loosened locks. And she said to the
Dagda, that she would bring the heart's blood of Indech, son of De
Domnann, that had threatened him, to the men of Ireland.

And while he was away Lugh had called together the Druids, and smiths,
and physicians, and law-makers, and chariot-drivers of Ireland, to make
plans for the battle.

And he asked the great magician Mathgen what could be do to help them.
"It is what I can do," said Mathgen, "through my power I can throw down
all the mountains of Ireland on the Fomor, until their tops will be
rolling on the ground. And the twelve chief mountains of Ireland will
bring you their help," he said, "and will fight for you: Slieve Leag and
Denda Ulad, and Bennai Boirche and Bri Ruri, and Slieve Bladma and
Slieve Snechtae, and Slieve Mis and Blai-Slieve, and Nemthann and Slieve
Macca Belgodon, and Segois and Cruachan Aigle."

Then he asked the cup-bearers what help they could give. "We will put a
strong thirst on the Fomor," they said, "and then we will bring the
twelve chief lochs of Ireland before them, and however great their
thirst may be, they will find no water in them: Derc-Loch, Loch
Luimnech, Loch Orbsen, Loch Righ, Loch Mescdhae, Loch Cuan, Loch Laeig,
Loch Echach, Loch Febail, Loch Decket, Loch Riach, Mor-Loch. And we will
go," they said, "to the twelve chief rivers of Ireland: the Buas, the
Boinn, the Banna, the Nem, the Laoi, the Sionnan, the Muaid, the
Sligech, the Samair, the Fionn, the Ruirtech, the Siuir; and they will
all be hidden away from the Fomor the way they will not find a drop in
them. But as for the men of Ireland," they said, "there will be drink
for them if they were to be in battle to the end of seven years."

And Figol, son of Marnos, the Druid, was asked then what he would do,
and he said: "It is what I will do, I will cause three showers of fire
to pour on the faces of the army of the Fomor, and I will take from them
two-thirds of their bravery and their strength, and I will put sickness
on their bodies, and on the bodies of their horses. But as to the men of
Ireland," he said, "every breath they breathe will be an increase of
strength and of bravery to them; and if they are seven years in the
battle they will never be any way tired."

Then Lugh asked his two witches, Bechulle and Dianan: "What power can
you bring to the battle?" "It is easy to say that," they said. "We will
put enchantment on the trees and the stones and the sods of the earth,
till they become an armed host against the Fomor, and put terror on them
and put them to the rout."

Then Lugh asked Carpre, the poet, son of Etain, what could he do. "It is
not hard to say that," said Carpre. "I will make a satire on them at
sunrise, and the wind from the north, and I on a hill-top and my back to
a thorn tree, and a stone and a thorn in my hand. And with that satire,"
he said, "I will put shame on them and enchantment, the way they will
not be able to stand against fighting men."

Then he asked Goibniu the Smith what would he be able to do. "I will do
this," he said. "If the men of Ireland stop in the battle to the end of
seven years, for every sword that is broken and for every spear that is
lost from its shaft, I will put a new one in its place. And no
spear-point that will be made by my hand," he said, "will ever miss its
mark; and no man it touches will ever taste life again. And that is more
than Dolb, the smith of the Fomor, can do," he said.

"And you, Credne," Lugh said then to his worker in brass, "what help can
you give to our men in the battle?" "It is not hard to tell that," said
Credne, "rivets for their spears and hilts for their swords and bosses
and rims for their shields, I will supply them all."

"And you, Luchta," he said then to his carpenter, "what will you do?" "I
will give them all they want of shields and of spear shafts," said
Luchta.

Then he asked Diancecht, the physician, what would he do, and it is what
he said: "Every man that will be wounded there, unless his head is
struck off, or his brain or his marrow cut through, I will make him
whole and sound again for the battle of the morrow."

Then the Dagda said: "Those great things you are boasting you will do, I
will do them all with only myself." "It is you are the good god!" said
they, and they all gave a great shout of laughter.

Then Lugh spoke to the whole army and put strength in them, so that each
had the spirit in him of a king or a great lord.

 

  
Then when the delay was at an end, the Fomor and the men of Ireland came
on towards one another till they came to the plain of Magh Tuireadh.
That now was not the same Magh Tuireadh where the first battle was
fought, but it was to the north, near Ess Dara.

And then the two armies threatened one another. "The men of Ireland are
daring enough to offer battle to us," said Bres to Indech, son of De
Domnann. "I give my word," said Indech, "it is in small pieces their
bones will be, if they do not give in to us and pay their tribute."

Now the Men of Dea had determined not to let Lugh go into the battle,
because of the loss his death would be to them; and they left nine of
their men keeping a watch on him. And on the first day none of the kings
or princes went into the battle, but only the common fighting men, and
they fierce and proud enough.

And the battle went on like that from day to day with no great advantage
to one or the other side. But there was wonder on the Fomor on account
of one thing. Such of their own weapons as were broken or blunted in the
fight lay there as they were, and such of their own men as were killed
showed no sign of life on the morrow; but it was not so with the Tuatha
de Danaan, for if their men were killed or their weapons were broken
to-day, they were as good as before on the morrow.

And this is the way that happened. The well of Slaine lay to the west of
Magh Tuireadh to the east of Loch Arboch. And Diancecht and his son
Octruil and his daughter Airmed used to be singing spells over the well
and to be putting herbs in it; and the men that were wounded to death in
the battle would be brought to the well and put into it as dead men, and
they would come out of it whole and sound, through the power of the
spells. And not only were they healed, but there was such fire put into
them that they would be quicker in the fight than they were before.

And as to the arms, it is the way they were made new every day. Goibniu
the Smith used to be in the forge making swords and spears, and he would
make a spear-head by three turns, and then Luchta the Carpenter would
make the shaft by three cuts, and the third cut was a finish, and would
set it in the ring of the spear. And when the spear-heads were stuck in
the side of the forge, he would throw the shaft and the rings the way
they would go into the spearhead and want no more setting. And then
Credne the Brazier would make the rivets by three turns and would cast
the rings of the spears to them, and with that they were ready and were
set together.

And all this went against the Fomor, and they sent one of their young
men to spy about the camp and to see could he find out how these things
were done. It was Ruadan, son of Bres and of Brigit daughter of the
Dagda they sent, for he was a son and grandson of the Tuatha de Danaan.
So he went and saw all that was done, and came back to the Fomor.

And when they heard his story it is what they thought, that Goibniu the
Smith was the man that hindered them most. And they sent Ruadan back
again, and bade him make an end of him.

So he went back again to the forge, and he asked Goibniu would he give
him a spear-head. And then he asked rivets of Credne, and a shaft of the
carpenter, and all was given to him as he asked. And there was a woman
there, Cron, mother to Fianlug, grinding the spears.

And after the spear being given to Ruadan, he turned and threw it at
Goibniu, that it wounded him. But Goibniu pulled it out and made a cast
of it at Ruadan, that it went through him and he died; and Bres, his
father, and the army of the Fomor, saw him die. And then Brigit came and
keened her son with shrieking and with crying.

And as to Goibniu, he went into the well and was healed. But after that
Octriallach, son of Indech, called to the Fomor and bade each man of
them bring a stone of the stones of Drinnes and throw them into the well
of Slane. And they did that till the well was dried up, and a cairn
raised over it, that is called Octriallach's Cairn.

And it was while Goibniu was making spear-heads for the battle of Magh
Tuireadh, a charge was brought against his wife. And it was seen that it
was heavy news to him, and the jealousy came to him. And it is what he
did, there was a spear-shaft in his hand when he heard the story, Nes
its name was; and he sang spells over the spear-shaft, and any one that
was struck with that spear afterwards, it would burn him up like fire.

And at last the day of the great battle came, and the Fomor came out of
their camp and stood in strong ranks. And there was not a leader or a
fighting man of them was without good armour to his skin, and a helmet
on his head, a broad spear in his right hand, a heavy sword in his belt,
a strong shield on his shoulder. And to attack the army of the Fomor
that day was to strike the head against a rock, or to go up fighting
against a fire.

And the Men of Dea rose up and left Lugh and his nine comrades keeping
him, and they went on to the battle; and Midhir was with them, and Bodb
Dearg and Diancecht. And Badb and Macha and the Morrigu called out that
they would go along with them.

And it was a hard battle was fought, and for a while it was going
against the Tuatha de Danaan; and Nuada of the Silver Hand, their King,
and Macha, daughter of Emmass, fell by Balor, King of the Fomor. And
Cassmail fell by Octriallach, and the Dagda got a dreadful wound from a
casting spear that was thrown by Ceithlenn, wife of Balor.

But when the battle was going on, Lugh broke away from those that were
keeping him, and rushed out to the front of the Men of Dea. And then
there was a fierce battle fought, and Lugh was heartening the men of
Ireland to fight well, the way they would not be in bonds any longer.
For it was better for them, he said, to die protecting their own country
than to live under bonds and under tribute any longer. And he sang a
song of courage to them, and the hosts gave a great shout as they went
into battle, and then they met together, and each of them began to
attack the other.

And there was great slaughter, and laying low in graves, and many comely
men fell there in the stall of death. Pride and shame were there side by
side, and hardness and red anger, and there was red blood on the white
skin of young fighting men. And the dashing of spear against shield, and
sword against sword, and the shouting of the fighters, and the whistling
of casting spears and the rattling of scabbards was like harsh thunder
through the battle. And many slipped in the blood that was under their
feet, and they fell, striking their heads one against another; and the
river carried away bodies of friends and enemies together.

Then Lugh and Balor met in the battle, and Lugh called out reproaches to
him; and there was anger on Balor, and he said to the men that were with
him: "Lift up my eyelid till l see this chatterer that is talking to
me." Then they raised Balor's eyelid, but Lugh made a cast of his red
spear at him, that brought the eye out through the back of his head, so
that it was towards his own army it fell, and three times nine of the
Fomor died when they looked at it. And if Lugh had not put out that eye
when he did, the whole of Ireland would have been burned in one flash.
And after this, Lugh struck his head off.

And as for Indech, son of De Domnann, he fell and was crushed in the
battle, and blood burst from his mouth, and he called out for Leat Glas,
his poet, as he lay there, but he was not able to help him. And then the
Morrigu came into the battle, and she was heartening the Tuatha de
Danaan to fight the battle well; and, as she had promised the Dagda, she
took the full of her two hands of Indech's blood, and gave it to the
armies that were waiting at the foot of Unius; and it was called the
Ford of Destruction from that day.

And after that it was not a battle any more, but a rout, and the Fomor
were beaten back to the sea. And Lugh and his comrades were following
them, and they came up with Bres, son of Elathan, and no guard with him,
and he said: "It is better for you to spare my life than to kill me. And
if you spare me now," he said, "the cows of Ireland will never go dry."
"I will ask an advice about that from our wise men," said Lugh. So he
told Maeltine Mor-Brethach, of the Great Judgments, what Bres was after
saying. But Maeltine said: "Do not spare him for that, for he has no
power over their offspring, though he has power so long as they are
living."

Then Bres said: "If you spare me, the men of Ireland will reap a harvest
of corn every quarter." But Maeltine said: "The spring is for ploughing
and sowing, and the beginning of summer for the strength of corn, and
the beginning of autumn for its ripeness, and the winter for using it."

"That does not save you," said Lugh then to Bres. But then to make an
excuse for sparing him, Lugh said: "Tell us what is the best way for the
men of Ireland to plough and to sow and to reap."

"Let their ploughing be on a Tuesday, and their casting seed into the
field on a Tuesday, and their reaping on a Tuesday," said Bres. So Lugh
said that would do, and he let him go free after that.

It was in this battle Ogma found Orna, the sword of Tethra, a king of
the Fomor, and he took it from its sheath and cleaned it. And when the
sword was taken out of the sheath, it told all the deeds that had been
done by it, for there used to be that power in swords.

And Lugh and the Dagda and Ogma followed after the Fomor, for they had
brought away the Dagda's harp with them, that was called Uaitne. And
they came to a feasting-house, and in it they found Bres and his father
Elathan, and there was the harp hanging on the wall.And it was in that
harp the Dagda had bound the music, so that it would not sound until he
would call to it. And sometimes it was called Dur-da-Bla, the Oak of Two
Blossoms, and sometimes Coir-cethar-chuin, the Four-Angled Music.

And when he saw it hanging on the wall it is what he said: "Come summer,
come winter, from the mouth of harps and bags and pipes." Then the harp
sprang from the wall, and came to the Dagda, and it killed nine men on
its way.

And then he played for them the three things harpers understand, the
sleepy tune, and the laughing tune, and the crying tune. And when he
played the crying tune, their tearful women cried, and then he played
the laughing tune, till their women and children laughed; and then he
played the sleepy tune, and all the hosts fell asleep. And through that
sleep the three went away through the Fomor that would have been glad to
harm them. And when all was over, the Dagda brought out the heifer he
had got as wages from Bres at the time he was making his dun. And she
called to her calf, and at the sound of her call all the cattle of
Ireland the Fomor had brought away as tribute, were back in their fields
again.

And Ce, the Druid of Nuada of the Silver Hand, was wounded in the
battle, and he went southward till he came to Cam Corrslebe. And there
he sat down to rest, tired with his wounds and with the fear that was on
him, and the journey. And he saw a smooth plain before him, and it full
of flowers, and a great desire came on him to reach to that plain, and
he went on till he came to it, and there he died. And when his grave was
made there, a lake burst out over it and over the whole plain, and it
was given the name of Loch Ce. And there were but four men of the Fomor
left in Ireland after the battle, and they used to be going through the
country, spoiling corn and milk and fruit, and whatever came from the
sea, till they were driven out one Samhain night by the Morrigu and by
Angus Og, that the Fomor might never be over Ireland again.

And after the battle was won, and the bodies were cleared away, the
Morrigu gave out the news of the great victory to the hosts and to the
royal heights of Ireland and to its chief rivers and its invers, and it
is what she said: "Peace up to the skies, the skies down to earth, the
earth under the skies; strength to every one."

And as to the number of men that fell in the battle, it will not be
known till we number the stars of the sky, or flakes of snow, or the dew
on the grass, or grass under the feet of cattle, or the horses of the
Son of Lir in a stormy sea.

And Lugh was made king over the Men of Dea then, and it was at Nas he
had his court.

And while he was king, his foster-mother Taillte, daughter of Magh Mor,
the Great Plain died. And before her death she bade her husband Duach
the Dark, he that built the Fort of the Hostages in Teamhair, to clear
away the wood of Cuan, the way there could be a gathering of the people
around her grave. So he called to the men of Ireland to cut down the
wood with their wide-bladed knives and bill-hooks and hatchets, and
within a month the whole wood was cut down.

And Lugh buried her in the plain of Midhe, and raised a mound over her,
that is to be seen to this day. And he ordered fires to be kindled, and
keening to be made, and games and sports to be held in the summer of
every year out of respect to her. And the place they were held got its
name from her, that is Taillten.

And as to Lugh's own mother, that was tall beautiful Ethlinn, she came
to Teamhair after the battle of Magh Tuireadh, and he gave her in
marriage to Tadg, son of Nuada. And the children that were born to them
were Muirne, mother of Finn, the Head of the Fianna of Ireland, and
Tuiren, that was mother of Bran.
