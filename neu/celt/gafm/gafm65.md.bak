# Part II Book VI: Birth of Diarmuid

DIARMUID, now, was son of Donn, son of Duibhne of the Fianna, and his
mother was Crochnuit, that was near in blood to Finn. And at the time he
was born, Donn was banished from the Fianna because of some quarrel they
had with him, and Angus Og took the child from him to rear him up at
Brugh na Boinne.

And after a while Crochnuit bore another son to Roc Diocain, that was
Head Steward to Angus. Roc Diocain went then to Donn, and asked would he
rear up his son for him, the way Angus was rearing Donn's son. But Donn
said he would not take the son of a common man into his house, and it
would be best for Angus to take him. So Angus took the child into Brugh
na Boinne, and he and Diarmuid were reared up together.

And one day Finn was on the great Hill at Almhuin of Leinster, and no
one with him but Donn and a few of the poets and learned men of the
Fianna, and their hounds and dogs, and Bran Beag came in and asked did
he remember there were bonds on him, not to stop in Almhuin for ten
nights together. Finn asked the people about him then where would he go
and be entertained for that night, and Donn said: "I will bring you to
the house of Angus, son of the Dagda, where my young son is being
reared."

So they went together to the house of Angus at Brugh na Boinne, and the
child Diarmuid was there, and it is great love Angus had for him. And
the Steward's son was with him that night, and the people of the
household made as much of him as Angus made of Diarmuid; and there was
great vexation on Donn when he saw that. It chanced after a while a
great fight rose between two of Finn's hounds about some broken meat
that was thrown to them; and the women and the common people of the
place ran from them, and the others rose up to part them from one
another. And in running away, the Steward's child ran between the knees
of Donn, and Donn gave the child a strong squeeze between his two knees
that killed him on the moment, and he threw him under the feet of the
hounds. And when the Steward came after that and found his son dead, he
gave a long very pitiful cry, and he said to Finn: "There is not a man
in the house to-night has suffered more than myself from this uproar,
for I had but one son only, and he has been killed; and what
satisfaction will I get from you for that, Finn?" he said. "Try can you
find the mark of a tooth or of a nail of one of the hounds on him," said
Finn, "and if you can, I will give you satisfaction for him."

So they looked at the child, and there was no scratch or mark of a tooth
on him at all. Then the Steward put Finn under the destroying bonds of
the Druid cave of Cruachan, to give him knowledge of who it was killed
his son. And Finn asked for a chess-board, and for water to be brought
to him, in a basin of pale gold, and he searched, and it was shown to
him truly that it was Donn had killed the Steward's son between his two
knees. When Finn knew that, he would take the fine on himself; but the
Steward would not consent to that, but forced him to tell who was it had
done him the wrong. And when he knew it was Donn had killed the child,
he said: "There is no man in the house it is easier to get satisfaction
from than from him, for his own son is here, and I have put him between
my two knees, and if I let him go from me safe, I will forgive the death
of my son." Angus was vexed at what the Steward said, and as to Donn, he
thought to strike his head off till Finn put him back from him. Then the
Steward came again, having a Druid rod with him, and he struck his own
son with the rod, and he made of him a wild boar, without bristle or ear
or tail, and he said: "I put you under bonds to bring Diarmuid, grandson
of Duibhne, to his death; and your own life will be no longer than his
life," he said. With that the wild boar rose up and ran out of the open
door; and be was called afterwards the Boar of Slieve Guilhion, and it
was by him Diarmuid came to his death at the last.

And when Diarmuid caine to his full strength he was given a place among
the Fianna of Ireland; and all women loved him, and he did many great
deeds, fighting with the enemies of the Fianna and of Ireland; and one
time he fought a wild ox through the length of seven days and seven
nights on the top of the Mountain of Happiness.
