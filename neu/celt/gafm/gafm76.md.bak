# Part II Book VII: Fighting and Peace

AND after a while Finn bade his people to make his ship ready, and to
put a store of food and drink in it. They did that, and he himself and a
thousand of his men went into the ship; and they were nine days between
sailing and rowing till they came to harbour in the north of Alban.

They bound the ship to the posts of the harbour then, and Finn with five
of his people went to the dun of the King of Alban, and Finn struck a
blow with the hand-wood on the door, and the doorkeeper asked who was in
it, and they told him it was Finn, son of Cumhal. "Let him in," said the
king.

Then Finn and his people went in, and the king made them welcome, and he
bade Finn to sit down in his own place, and they were given strong
pleasant drinks, and the king sent for the rest of Finn's people and
bade them welcome to the dun.

Then Finn told what it was brought him there, and that it was to ask
help and advice against the grandson of Duibhne he was come.

"And you have a right to give me your help," he said, "for it was he
that killed your father and your two brothers, and many of the best men
along with them."

"That is true," said the king; "and I will give you my own two sons and
a thousand men with each of them." Finn was glad when he heard that, and
he and his men took leave of the king and of his household, and left
wishes for life and health with them, and the king did the same by them.

And it was near Brugh na Boinne Finn and his people came to land, and
Finn sent messengers to the house of Angus to give out a challenge of
battle against Diarmuid, grandson of Duibhne.

"What should I do about this, Osgar?" said Diarmuid.

"We will both go out and make a stand against them, and we will not let
a serving-man of them escape, but we will make an end of them all," said
Osgar.

So they rose up on the morning of the morrow and they put their suits of
battle on their comely bodies; and it would be a pity for those, be they
many or few, that would meet those two men, and their anger on them. And
they bound the rims of their shields together the way they would not be
parted from one another in the fight. And the sons of the King of Alban
said that they themselves and their people would go first to meet them.
So they came to shore, and made a rush to meet Diarmuid and Osgar. But
the two fought so well that they beat them back and scattered them, and
made a great slaughter, and put great terror on them, so that at the
last there was not a man left to stand against them.

And after that, Finn went out again on the sea, and his people with him,
and there is no word of them till they came to the Land of Promise where
Finn's nurse was. And when she saw Finn coming she was very joyful
before him. And Finn told her the whole story from beginning to end, and
the cause of his quarrel with Diarmuid; and he said it was to ask an
advice from her he was come, and that it was not possible to put him
down by any strength of an army, unless enchantment would put him down.
"I will go with you," said the old woman, "and I will do enchantment on
him." Finn was very glad when be heard that, and be stopped there that
night, and they set out for Ireland on the morrow.

And when they came to Brugh na Boinne, the nurse put a Druid mist around
Finn and the Fianna, the way no one could know they were there. Now the
day before that, Osgar had parted from Diamiuid, and Diarmuid was out
hunting by himself. That was shown to the hag, and she took a drowned
leaf having a hole in it, like the quern of a mill, and she rose with
that by her enchantments on a blast of Druid wind over Diarmuid, and
began to aim at him through the hole with deadly spears, till she had
done him great harm, for all his arms and his clothing, and he could not
make away he was so hard pressed. And every danger he was ever in was
little beside that danger. And it is what he thought, that unless he
could strike the old woman through the hole that was in the leaf, she
would give him his death there and then. And he lay down on his back,
and the Gae Dearg, the Red Spear, in his hand, and he made a great cast
of the spear, that it went through the hole, and the hag fell dead on
the spot. And he struck off her head and he brought it back with him to
Angus Og.

And the next morning early, Angus rose up, and he went where Finn was,
and he asked would he make peace with Diarmuid, and Finn said he would.
And then he went to the King of Ireland to ask peace for Diarmuid, and
he said he would agree to it.

And then he went back to where Diarmuid and Grania were, and asked him
would he make peace with the High King and with Finn. "I am willing,"
said Diarmuid, "if they will give the conditions I will ask." "What
conditions are those?" said Angus.

"The district my father had," said Diarmuid, "that is, the district of
Ui Duibhne, without right of hunting to Finn, and without rent or
tribute to the King of Ireland, and with that the district of Dumhais in
Leinster, for they are the best in Ireland, and the district of Ceis
Corainn from the King of Ireland as a marriage portion with his
daughter; and those are the conditions on which I will make peace with
them." "Would you be peaceable if you got those conditions?" said Angus.
"It would go easier with me to make peace if I got them," said Diarmuid.

Then Angus went with that news to where the King of Ireland was with
Finn. And they gave him all those conditions, and they forgave him all
he had done through the whole of the time he had been in his hiding,
that was sixteen years.

And the place Diarmuid and Grania settled in was Rath Grania, in the
district of Ceis Corainn, far away from Finn and from Teamhair. And
Grania bore him children there, four sons and one daughter. And they
lived there in peace, and the people used to be saying there was not a
man living at the same time was richer as to gold and to silver, as to
cattle and to sheep, than Diarmuid.
