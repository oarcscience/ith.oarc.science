# Part II Book IV: The Red Woman

ONE time the Fianna were in Almhuin with no great work to do, and there
came a very misty morning, and Finn was in dread that sluggishness would
come on his men, and he rose up, and he said:

"Make yourselves ready, and we will go hunting to Gleann-na-Smol"

They all said the day was too misty to go hunting; but there was no use
in talking: they had to do as Finn bade them. So they made themselves
ready and went on towards Gleann-na-Smol; and they were not gone far
when the mist lifted and the sun came shining out.

And when they were on the edge of a little wood, they saw a strange
beast coming towards them with the quickness of the wind, and a Red
Woman on its track. Narrow feet the beast had, and a head like the head
of a boar, and long horns on it; but the rest of it was like a deer, and
there was a shining moon on each of its sides.

Finn stopped, and he said: "Fianna of Ireland," he said, "did you ever
see a beast like that one until now?" "We never did indeed," said they;
"and it would be right for us to let out the hounds after it." "Wait a
while," said Finn, "till I speak with the Red Woman; but do not let the
beast go past you," he said. They thought to keep back the beast then,
going before it; but they were hardly able to hinder it at all, and it
went away through them.

And when the Red Woman was come up to them, Finn asked her what was the
name of the beast she was following. "I do not know that," she said,
"though I am on its track since I left the borders of Loch Dearg a month
ago, and I never lost sight of it since then; and the two moons that are
on its two sides shine through the country all around in the night time.
And I must follow it till it falls," she said, "or I will lose my own
life and the lives of my three sons that are the best fighting men in
the whole world." "We will take the beast for you if you have a mind,"
said Finn. "Do not try to do that," she said, "for I myself am swifter
than you are, and I cannot come up with it." "We will not let it go till
we know what sort of a beast is it," said Finn. "If you yourself or your
share of men go after it, I will bind you hand and foot," said she. "It
is too stiff your talk is," said Finn. "And do you not know," he said,
"I am Finn, son of Cumhal; and there are fourscore fighting men along
with me that were never beaten yet." "It is little heed I give to
yourself or your share of men," said the Red Woman; "and if my three
sons were here, they would stand up against you." "Indeed it will be a
bad day," said Finn, "when the threat of a woman will put fear on myself
or on the Fianna of Ireland." With that he sounded his horn, and he
said: "Let us all follow now, men and dogs, after that beast that we
saw."

He had no sooner said that word than the woman made a great water-worm
of herself, and made an attack on Finn, and she would have killed him
then and there but for Bran being with him. Bran took grip of the worm
and shook it, and then it wound itself round Bran's body, and would have
crushed the life out of her, but Finn thrust his sharp sword into its
throat. "Keep back your hand," said the worm then, "and you will not
have the curse of a lonely woman upon you." "It is what I think," said
Finn, "that you would not leave me my life if you could take it from me;
but go out of my sight now," he said, "and that I may never see you
again."

Then she made herself into a Red Woman again, and went away into the
wood.

All the Fianna were gone on the track of the beast while Finn was
talking and fighting with the Red Woman; and he did not know in what
place they were, but he went following after them, himself and Bran. It
was late in the evening when he came up with a share of them, and they
still on the track of the beast. The darkness of the night was coming
on, but the moons in the sides of the beast gave a bright light, and
they never lost it from sight. They followed it on always; and about
midnight they were pressing on it, and it began to scatter blood after
it, and it was not long before Finn and his men were red from head to
foot. But that did not hinder them, and they followed him on till they
saw him go in at the foot of Cnoc-na-righ at the breaking of day.

When they came to the foot of the hill the Red Woman was standing there
before them. "You did not take the beast," she said. "We did not take
it, but we know where it is," said Finn.

She took a Druid rod then, and struck a blow on the side of the hill,
and on the moment a great door opened, and they heard sweet music coming
from within. "Come in now," said the Red Woman, "till you see the
wonderful beast." "Our clothing is not clean," said Finn, "and we would
not like to go in among a company the way we are," he said.

She put a horn to her mouth and blew it, and on the moment there came
ten young men to her. "Bring water for washing," she said, "and four
times twenty suits of clothes, and a beautiful suit and a crown of
shining stones for Finn, son of Cumhal." The young men went away then,
and they came back at the end of a minute with water and with clothing.

When the Fianna were washed and dressed, the Red Woman brought them into
a great hall, where there was the brightness of the sun and of the moon
on every side. From that she brought them into another great room; and
although Finn and his men had seen many grand things up to that time,
they had never seen any sight so grand as what they saw in this place.
There was a king sitting in a golden chair, having clothes of gold and
of green, and his chief people were sitting around him, and his
musicians were playing. And no one could know what colour were the
dresses of the musicians, for every colour of the rainbow was in them.
And there was a great table in the middle of the room, having every sort
of thing on it, one better than another.

The king rose up and gave a welcome to Finn and to his men, and he bade
them to sit down at the table; and they ate and drank their fill, and
that was wanting to them after the hunt they had made. And then the Red
Woman rose up, and she said: "King of the Hill, if it is your will, Finn
and his men have a mind to see the wonderful beast, for they spent a
long time following after it, and that is what brought them here."

The king struck a blow then on his golden chair, and a door opened
behind him, and the beast came through it and stood before the king. And
it stooped down before him, and it said: "I am going on towards my own
country now; and there is not in the world a runner so good as myself,
and the sea is the same to me as the land. And let whoever can come up
with me come now," it said, "for I am going."

With that the beast went out from the hill as quick as a blast of wind,
and all the people that were in it went following after it. it was not
long till Finn and his men were before the rest, in the front of the
hunt, gaining on the beast.

And about midday Bran made the beast turn, and then she forced it to
turn a second time, and it began to put out cries, and it was not long
until its strength began to flag; and at last, just at the setting of
the sun, it fell dead, and Bran was at its side when it fell.

Then Finn and his men came up, but in place of a beast it was a tall man
they saw lying dead before them. And the Red Woman came up at the same
time, and she said: "High King of the Fianna, that is the King of the
Firbolgs you have killed; and his people will put great troubles on this
country in the time to come, when you yourself, Finn, and your people
will be under the sod. And I myself am going now to the Country of the
Young," she said, "and I will bring you with me if you have a mind to
come." "We give you our thanks for that," said Finn, "but we would not
give up our own country if we were to get the whole world as an estate,
and the Country of the Young along with it." "That is well," said the
Red Woman; "but you are going home empty after your hunt." "It is likely
we will find a deer in Gleann-na-Smol," said Finn. "There is a fine deer
at the foot of that tree beyond," said the Red Woman, "and I will rouse
it for you." With that she gave a cry, and the deer started out and
away, and Finn and his men after it, and it never stopped till it came
to Gleann-na-Smol, but they could not come up with it. Then the Red
Woman came to them, and she said: "I think you are tired now with
following after the deer; and call your hounds off now," she said, "and
I will let out my own little dog after it." So Finn sounded a little
born he had at his side, and on the moment the hounds came back to him.
And then the Red Woman brought out a little hound as white as the snow
of the mountains, and put it after the deer; and it was not long till it
had come up with the deer and killed it, and then it came back and made
a leap in under the cloak of the Red Woman. There was great wonder on
Finn; but before he could ask a question of the Red Woman, she was gone
out of sight. And as to the deer, Finn knew there was enchantment on it,
and so he left it there after him. And it is tired and empty the Fianna
were, going back to Almhuin that night.
