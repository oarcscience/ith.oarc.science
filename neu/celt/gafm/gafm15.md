# Part I Book IV: Aine

AND as to Aine, that some said was a daughter of Manannan, but some said
was the Morrigu herself, there was a stone belonging to her that was
called Cathair Aine. And if any one would sit on that stone he would be
in danger of losing his wits, and any one that would sit on it three
times would lose them for ever. And people whose wits were astray would
make their way to it, and mad dogs would come from all parts of the
country, and would flock around it, and then they would go into the sea
to Aine's place there. But those that did cures by herbs said she had
power over the whole body; and she used to give gifts of poetry and of
music, and she often gave her love to men, and they called her the
Leanan Sidhe, the Sweetheart of the Sidhe.

And it was no safe thing to offend Aine, for she was very revengeful.
Oilioll Oluim, a king of Ireland, killed her brother one time, and it is
what she did, she made a great yew-tree by enchantment beside the river
Maigh in Luimnech, and she put a little man in it, playing sweet music
on a harp. And Oilioli's son was passing the river with his
step-brother, and they saw the tree and heard the sweet music from it.
And first they quarrelled as to which of them would have the little
harper, and then they quarrelled about the tree, and they asked a
judgment from Ollioll, and he gave it for his own son. And it was the
bad feeling about that judgment that led to the battle of Magh
Mucruimhe, and Oilioll and his seven sons were killed there, and so Aine
got her revenge.
