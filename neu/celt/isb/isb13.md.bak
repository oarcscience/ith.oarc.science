Tralee--Listowel--Tarbert.

 

I made the journey to Tralee next day, upon one of the famous Bianconi
cars--very comfortable conveyances too, if the booking-officers would
only receive as many persons as the car would hold, and not have too
many on the seats. For half an hour before the car left Killarney, I
observed people had taken their seats: and, let all travellers be
cautious to do likewise, lest, although they have booked their places,
they be requested to mount on the roof and accommodate themselves on a
bandbox, or a pleasant deal trunk with a knotted rope, to prevent it
from being slippery, while the corner of another box jolts against your
ribs for the journey. I had put my coat on a place, and was stepping to
it when a lovely lady with great activity jumped up and pushed the coat
on the roof, and not only occupied my seat but insisted that her husband
should have the next one to her. So there was nothing for it but to make
a huge shouting with the book-keeper and call instantly for the taking
down of my luggage, and vow my great gods that I would take a
post-chaise and make the office pay: on which, I am ashamed to say, some
other person was made to give up a decently comfortable seat on the
roof, which I occupied, the former occupant hanging on--heaven knows
where or how.

A company of young squires were on the coach, and they talked of
horse-racing and bunting punctually for three hours, during which time I
do believe they did not utter one single word upon any other subject.
What a wonderful faculty it is! The writers of Natural Histories, in
describing the noble horse, should say be is made not only to run, to
carry burdens, &c., but to be talked about. What would hundreds of
thousands of dashing young fellows do with their tongues, if they had
not this blessed subject to discourse on?

As far as the country went, there was here, to be sure, not much to be
said. You pass through a sad-looking, bare, undulating country, with few
trees, and poor stone-hedges, and poorer crops; nor have I yet taken in
Ireland so dull a ride. About half way between Tralee and Killarney is a
wretched town, where horses are changed, and where I saw more hideous
beggary than anywhere else, I think. And I was glad to get over this
gloomy tract of country, and enter the capital of Kerry.

It has a handsome description in the guide-books; but, if I mistake not,
the English traveller will find a stay of a couple of hours in the town
quite sufficient to gratify his curiosity with respect to the place.
There seems to be a great deal of poor business going on; the town
thronged with people as usual; the shops large and not too splendid.
There are two or three rows of respectable houses, and a mall, and the
townspeople have the further privilege of walking in the neighbouring
grounds of a handsome park, which the proprietor has liberally given to
their use. Tralee has a newspaper, and boasts of a couple of clubs: the
one I saw was a big white house, no windows broken, and looking
comfortable. But the most curious sight of the town was the chapel, with
the festival held there. It was the feast of the Assumption of the
Virgin, (let those who are acquainted with the calendar and the facts it
commemorates say what the feast was, and when it falls,) and all the
country seemed to be present on the occasion: the chapel and the large
court leading to it were thronged with worshippers, such as one never
sees in our country, where devotion is by no means so crowded as here.
Here, in the court-yard, there were thousands of them on their knees,
rosary in hand, for the most part praying, and mumbling, and casting a
wistful look round as the strangers passed. In a corner was an old man
groaning in the agonies of death or colic, and a woman got off her knees
to ask us for charity for the unhappy old fellow. In the chapel the
crowd was enormous: the priest and his people were kneeling, and bowing,
and humming, and chanting, and censor-rattling; the ghostly crew being
attended by a fellow that I don't remember to have seen in continental
churches, a sort of Catholic clerk, a black shadow to the parson, bowing
his head when his reverence bowed, kneeling when he knelt, only three
steps lower.

But we who wonder at copes and candlesticks, see nothing strange in
surplices and beadles. A Turk, doubtless, would sneer equally at each,
and have you to understand that the only reasonable ceremonial was that
which took place at his mosque.

Whether right or wrong in point of ceremony, it was evident the heart of
devotion was there: the immense dense crowd moaned and swayed, and you
heard a hum of all sorts of wild ejaculations, each man praying
seemingly for himself, while the service went on at the altar. The altar
candles flickered red in the dark, steaming place, and every now and
then from the choir you heard a sweet female voice chanting Mozart's
music, which swept over the heads of the people a great deal more pure
and delicious than the best incense that ever smoked out of pot.

On the chapel floor, just at the entry, lay several people moaning, and
tossing, and telling their beads. Behind the old woman was a font of
holy water, up to which little children were clambering; and in the
chapel-yard were several old women, with tin cans full of the same
sacred fluid, with which the people, as they entered, aspersed
themselves with all their might, flicking a great quantity into their
faces, and making a curtsey and a prayer at the same time. "A pretty
prayer, truly!" says the parson's wife. "What sad, sad, benighted
superstition!" says the Independent minister's lady. Ah! ladies, great
as your intelligence is, yet think, when compared with the Supreme One,
what a little difference there is after all between your husbands' very
best extempore oration and the poor Popish creatures'! One is just as
far off Infinite Wisdom as the other: and so let us read the story of
the woman and her pot of ointment, that most noble and charming of
histories; which equalises the great and the small, the wise and the
poor in spirit, and shows that their merit before heaven lies

in doing their best

When I came out of the chapel, the old fellow on the point of death was
still howling and groaning in so vehement a manner, that I heartily
trust be was an impostor, and that on receiving a sixpence he went home
tolerably comfortable, having secured a maintenance for that day. But it
will be long before I can forget the strange, wild scene, so entirely
different was it from the decent and comfortable observances of our own
church.

Three cars set off together from Tralee to Tarbert: three cars full to
overflowing. The vehicle before us contained nineteen persons, half a
dozen being placed in the receptacle called the well, and one clinging
on as if by a miracle at the bar behind. What can people want at
Tarbert? I wondered; or anywhere else, indeed, that they rush about from
one town to another in this inconceivable way? All the cars in all the
towns seem to be thronged: people are perpetually hurrying from one
dismal tumble-down town to another; and yet no business is done anywhere
that I can see. The chief part of the contents of our three cars was
discharged at Listowel, to which, for the greater part of the journey,
the road was neither more cheerful nor picturesque than that from
Killarney to Tralee. As, however, you reach Listowel, the county becomes
better cultivated, the gentlemen's seats are more frequent, and the town
itself, as seen from a little distance, lies very prettily on a river,
which is crossed by a hand-some bridge, which leads to a neat-looking
square, which contains a smartish church, which is flanked by a big
Roman Catholic chapel, &c. An old castle, grey and ivy-covered, stands
bard by. It is one of the strongholds of the Lords of Kerry, whose
burying-place (according to the information of the coachman) is seen at
about a league from the town.

But pretty as Listowel is from a distance, it has, on a more intimate
acquaintance, by no means the prosperous appearance which a first glance
gives it. The place seemed like a scene at a country theatre, once
smartly painted by the artist; but the paint has cracked in many places,
the lines are worn away, and the whole piece only looks more shabby for
the flaunting strokes of the brush which remain. And here, of course,
came the usual crowd of idlers round the car: the epileptic idiot
holding piteously out his empty tin snuff-box: the brutal idiot, in an
old soldier's coat, proffering his money box and grinning and clattering
the single halfpenny it contained; the old man with no eyelids, calling
upon you in the name of the Lord; the woman with a child at her hideous,
wrinkled breast; the children without number. As for trade, there seemed
to be none: a great Jeremy-Diddler kind of hotel stood hard by,
swaggering and out at elbows, and six pretty girls were smiling out of a
beggarly straw-bonnet shop, dressed as smartly as any gentleman's
daughters of good estate. It was good, among the crowd of bustling,
shrieking fellows, who were "jawing" vastly and doing nothing, to see
how an English bagman, with scarce any words, laid hold of an ostler,
carried him off *vi et* *armis* in the midst of a speech, in which the
latter was going to explain his immense activity and desire to serve,
pushed him into a stable, from which he issued in a twinkling, leading
the ostler and a horse, and had his bag on the car and his horse off in
about two minutes of time, while the natives were still shouting round
about other passengers' portmanteaus.

Some time afterwards, away we rattled on our own journey to Tarbert,
having a postilion on the leader, and receiving, I must say, some
graceful bows from the young bonnet-makeresses. But of all the roads
over which human bones were ever jolted, the first part of this from
Listowel to Tarbert deserves the palm. It shook us all into headaches;
it shook some nails out of the side of a box I had; it shook all the
cords loose in a twinkling, and sent the baggage bumping about the
passengers' shoulders. The coachman at the call of another English
bagman, who was a fellow-traveller,--the postilion at the call of the
coachman, descended to re-cord the baggage. The English bagman had the
whole mass of trunks and bags stoutly corded and firmly fixed in a few
seconds; the coachman helped him as far as his means allowed; the
postilion stood by with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe, and
never offering to stir a finger. I said to him that I was delighted to
see in a youth of sixteen that extreme activity and willingness to
oblige, and that I would give him a handsome remuneration for his
services at the end of the journey: the young rascal grinned with all
his might, understanding the satiric nature of the address perfectly
well; but he did not take his hands out of his pockets for all that,
until it was time for him to get on his horse again, and then, having
carried us over the most difficult part of the journey, removed his
horse and pipe, and rode away with a parting grin.

The cabins along the road were not much better than those to be seen
south of Tralee, but the people were far better clothed, and indulged in
several places in the luxury of pig-sties. Near the prettily situated
village of Ballylongford, we came in sight of the Shannon mouth; and a
huge red moon, that shone behind an old convent on the banks of the
bright river, with dull green meadows between it and us, and white
purple flats beyond, would be a good subject for the pencil of any
artist whose wrist had not been put out of joint by the previous ten
miles' journey,

The town of Tarbert, in the guide-books and topographical dictionaries,
flourishes considerably. You read of its port, its corn and provision
stores, &c., and of certain good hotels; for which as travellers we were
looking with a laudable anxiety. The town, in fact, contains about a
dozen of houses, some hundreds of cabins, and two hotels; to one of
which we were driven, and a kind landlady, conducting" her half-dozen
guests into a snug parlour, was for our ordering refreshment
immediately,--which I certainly should have done, but for the ominous
whisper of a fellow in the crowd as we descended (of course a
disinterested patron of the other house), who hissed into my ears, *"Ask
to see the beds:"* which proposal, accordingly, I made before coming to
any determination regarding supper.

The worthy landlady eluded my questions several times with great skill
and good-humour, but it became at length necessary to answer it; which
she did by putting on as confident an air as possible, and leading the
way up stairs to a bedroom, where there was a good large comfortable bed
certainly.

The only objection to the bed, however, was that it contained a sick
lady, whom the hostess proposed to eject without any ceremony, saying
that she was a great deal better, and going to get up that very evening.
However, none of us had the heart to tyrannise over lovely woman in so
painful a situation, and the hostess had the grief of seeing four out of
her five guests repair across the way to "Brallaghan's" or "Gallagher's
Hotel,"--the name has fled from my memory, but it is the big hotel in
the place; and unless the sick lady has quitted the other inn, which
most likely she has done by this time, the English traveller will profit
by this advice, and on arrival at Tarbert will have himself transported
to "Gallagher's" at once.

The next morning a car carried us to Tarbert Point, where there is a
pier not yet completed, and a Preventive station, and where the Shannon
steamers touch, that ply between Kilrush and Limerick. Here lay the
famous river before us, with low banks and rich pastures on either side.
