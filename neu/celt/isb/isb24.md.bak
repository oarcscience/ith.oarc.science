Two Days in Wicklow.

 

The little tour we have just been taking has been performed, not only by
myriads of the "car-drivingest, tay-drinkingest, say-bathingest people
in the world," the inhabitants of the city of Dublin, but also by all
the tourists who have come to discover this country for the benefit of
the English nation. "Look here! " says the ragged, bearded genius of a
guide at the Seven Churches. "This is the spot which Mr. Henry Inglis
particularly admired, and said it was exactly like Norway. Many's the
song I've heard Mr. Sam Lover sing here--a pleasant gentleman entirely.
Have you seen my picture that's taken off in Mrs. Hall's book? All the
strangers know me by it, though it makes me much cleverer than I am."
Similar tales has he of Mr. Barrow, and the Transatlantic Willis, and of
Crofton Croker, who has been everywhere

The guide's remarks concerning the works of these gentlemen inspired me,
I must confess, with considerable disgust and jealousy. A plague take
them! what remains for me to discover after the gallant adventurers in
the service of Paternoster Row have examined every rock, lake, and ruin
of the district, exhausted it of all its legends, and "invented new"
most likely as their daring genius prompted? Hence it follows that the
description of the two days' jaunt must of necessity be short; lest
persons who have read former accounts should be led to refer to the
same, and make comparisons which might possibly be unfavourable to the
present humble pages.

Is there anything new to be said regarding the journey? In the first
place, there's the railroad: it's no longer than the railroad to
Greenwich, to be sure, and almost as well known; but has it been *done?*
that's the question; or has anybody discovered the dandies on the
railroad?

After wondering at the beggars and carmen of Dublin, the stranger can't
help admiring another vast and numerous class of inhabitants of the
city--namely, the dandies. Such a number of smartly-dressed young
fellows I don't think any town possesses: no, not Paris, where the young
shopmen, with spurs and stays, may be remarked strutting abroad on
f6te-days; nor London, where on Sundays, in the Park, you see thousands
of this cheap kind of aristocracy parading; nor Liverpool, famous for
the breed of commercial dandies, desk and counter D'Orsays and cotton
and sugar-barrel Brummels, and whom one remarks pushing on to business
with a brisk determined air. All the above races are only to be
encountered on holidays, except by those persons whose affairs take them
to shops, docks, or counting-houses, where these fascinating young
fellows labour during the week.

But the Dublin breed of dandies is quite distinct from those of the
various cities above named, and altogether superior: for they appear
every day, and all day long not once a week merely, and have an original
and splendid character and appearance of their own, very hard to
describe, though no doubt every traveller, as well as myself, has
admired and observed it. They assume a sort of military and ferocious
look, not observable in other cheap dandies, except in Paris perhaps now
and then; and are to be remarked not so much for the splendour of their
ornaments as for the profusion of them. Thus, for instance, a hat which
is worn straight over the two eyes costs very likely more than one which
hangs upon one ear; a great oily bush of hair to balance the hat
(otherwise the head no doubt would call hopelessly on one side) is even
more economical than a crop which requires the barber's scissors
oft-times; also a tuft on the chin may be had at a small expense of
bear's-grease by persons of a proper age; and although big pins are the
fashion, I am bound to say I have never seen so many or so big as here.
Large agate marbles or "taws" globes terrestrial and celestial,
pawnbrokers' balls,--I cannot find comparisons large enough for these
wonderful ornaments of the person. Canes also should be mentioned, which
are sold very splendid, with gold or silver heads, for a shilling on the
Quays; and the dandy not uncommonly finishes off with a horn
quizzing-glass, which being stuck in one eye contracts the brows and
gives a fierce determined look to the whole countenance.

In idleness at least these young men can compete with the greatest
lords; and the wonder is, how the city can support so many of them, or
they themselves; how they manage to spend their time; who gives them
money to ride hacks in the "Phaynix on field and race days; to have
boats at Kingstown during the summer; and to be crowding the
railway-coaches all the day long? Cars go whirling about all day,
bearing squads of them. You see them sauntering at all the
railway-stations in vast numbers, and jumping out of the carriages, as
the trains come up, and greeting other dandies with that rich large
brogue which some actor ought to make known to the English public: it
being the biggest, richest, and coarsest of all the brogues of Ireland.

<span id="img_45"></span> ![](img/45.jpg)

I think these dandies are the chief objects which arrest the stranger's
attention as he travels on the Kingstown railroad, and 1 have always
been so much occupied in watching and wondering at them as scarcely to
have leisure to look at any-thing else during the pretty little ride of
twenty minutes so beloved by every Dublin cockney. The waters of the bay
wash in many places the piers on which the railway is built, and you see
the calm stretch of water beyond, and the big purple hill of Howth, and
the lighthouses, and the jetties, and the shipping. Yesterday was a
boat-race, (I don't know how many scores of such take place during the
season,) and you may be sure there were tens of thousands of the dandies
to look on. There had been boat-races the two days previous: before
that, had been a field day--before that, three days of garrison
races--to-day, to-morrow, and the day after, there are races at Howth.
There seems some sameness in the sports, but everybody goes: everybody
is never tired; and then, I suppose, comes the punch-party, and the song
in the evening-the same old pleasures, and the same old songs the next
day, and so on to the end. As for the boat-race, I saw two little boats
in the distance tugging away for dear life--the beach and piers swarming
with spectators, the bay full of small yachts and innumerable row-boats,
and in the midst of the assemblage a convict-ship lying ready for sail,
with a black mass of poor wretches on her deck--who, too, were eager for
pleasure.

Who is not, in this country? Walking away from the pier and King
George's column, you arrive upon rows after rows of pleasure-houses,
whither all Dublin flocks during the summer-time-for every one must have
his sea-bathing; and they say that the country houses to the west of the
town are empty, or to be had for very small prices, while for those on
the coast, especially towards Kingstown, there is the readiest sale at
large prices. I have paid frequent visits to one, of which the rent is
as great as that of a tolerable London house; and there seem to be
others suited to all purses: for instance, there are long lines of
two-roomed houses, stretching far back and away from the sea,
accommodating, doubtless, small commercial men, or small families, or
some of those travelling dandies we have just been talking about, and
whose costume is so cheap and so splendid.

A two-horse car, which will accommodate twelve, or will condescend to
receive twenty passengers, starts from the railway station for Bray,
running along the coast for the chief part of the journey, though you
have but few views of the sea, on account of intervening woods and
hills. The whole of this country is covered with handsome villas and
their gardens, and pleasure-grounds. There are round many of the houses
parks of some extent, and always of considerable beauty, among the trees
of which the road winds. New churches are likewise to be seen in various
places; built like the poor-houses, that are likewise everywhere
springing up, pretty much upon one plan--a sort of bastard or Vauxhall
Gothic--resembling no architecture of any age previous to that when
Horace Walpole invented the Castle of Otranto and the other monstrosity
upon Strawberry Hill though it must be confessed that those on the Bray
line are by no means so imaginative. Well, what matters, say you, that
the churches be ugly, if the truth is preached within? Is it not fair,
however, to say that Beauty is the truth too, of its kind? and why
should it not be cultivated as well as other truth? Why build these
hideous barbaric temples, when at the expense of a little study and
taste beautiful structures might be raised?

After leaving Bray, with its pleasant bay, and pleasant river, and
pleasant inn, the little Wicklow tour may be said to commence properly;
and, as that romantic and beautiful country has been described many
times in familiar terms, our only chance is to speak thereof in romantic
and beautiful language, such as no other writer can possibly have
employed.

We rang at the gate of the steward's lodge and said, "Grant us a pass,
we pray, to see the parks of Powerscourt, and to behold the brown deer
upon the grass, and the cool shadows under the whispering trees."

But the steward's son answered, "You may not see the parks of
Powerscourt, for the lord of the castle comes home, and we expect him
daily." So, wondering at this reply, but not understanding the same, we
took leave of the son of the steward and said, "No doubt Powerscourt is
not fit to see. Have we not seen parks in England, my brother, and shall
we break our hearts that this Irish one bath its gates closed to us?"

Then the car-boy said, "My lords, the park is shut, but the waterfall
runs for every man; will it please you to see the waterfall?" "Boy," we
replied, "we have seen many waterfalls nevertheless, lead on!" And the
boy took his pipe out of his mouth and belaboured the ribs of his beast.

And the horse made believe, as it were, to trot, and jolted the ardent
travellers; and we passed the green trees of Tinnehinch, which the
grateful Irish nation bought and consecrated to the race of Grattan; and
we said, "What nation will spend fifty thousand pounds for our benefit?"
and we wished we might get it; and we passed on. The birds were,
meanwhile, chanting concerts in the woods; and the sun was
double-gilding the golden corn.

And we came to a hill, which was steep and long of descent; and the
car-boy said, "My lords, I may never descend this hill with safety to
your honours' bones; for my horse is not sure of foot, and loves to
kneel in the highway. Descend therefore, and I will await your return on
the top of the hill."

So we descended, and one grumbled greatly; but the other said, "Sir, be
of good heart! the way is pleasant, and the footman will not weary as he
travels it." And we went through the swinging gates of the park, where
the harvestmen sat at their potatoes--a mealy meal.

The way was not short, as the companion said, but still it was a
pleasant way to walk. Green stretches of grass were there, and a forest
nigh at hand. It was but September: yet the autumn had already begun to
turn the green trees into red; and the ferns that were waving underneath
the trees were reddened and fading too. And as Dr. Jones's boys of a
Saturday disport in the meadows after school-hours, so did the little
clouds run races over the waving grass. And as grave ushers who look on
smiling at the sports of these little ones, so stood the old trees
around the green, whispering and nodding to one another.

<span id="img_46"></span> ![](img/46.jpg)

Purple mountains rose before us in front, and we began presently to hear
a noise and roaring afar off--not a fierce roaring, but one deep and
calm, like to the respiration of the great sea, as he lies basking on
the sands in the sunshine.

And we came soon to a little hillock of green, which was standing before
a huge mountain of purple black, and there were white clouds over the
mountains, and some trees waving on the hillock, and between the trunks
of them we saw the waters of the waterfall descending; and there was a
snob on a rock, who stood and examined the same.

Then we approached the water, passing the clump of oak trees. The waters
were white, and the cliffs which they varnished were purple. But those
round about were grey, tall, and gay with blue shadows, and ferns,
heath, and rusty-coloured funguses sprouting here and there in the same.
But in the ravine where the waters fell, roaring as it were with the
fall, the rocks were dark, and the foam of the cataract was of a yellow
colour. And we stood, and were silent, and wondered. And still the trees
continued to wave, and the waters to roar and tumble, and the sun to
shine, and the fresh wind to blow.

And we stood and looked: and said in our hearts it was beautiful, and
bethought us hw shall all this be set down in types and ink? (for our
trade is to write books and sell the same--a chapter for a guinea, a
line for a penny); and the waterfall roared in answer, "For shame, o
vain man! think not of thy books and of thy pence now; but look on, and
wonder, and be silent. Can types or ink describe my beauty, though aided
by thy small wit? I am made for thee to praise and wonder at: be
content, and cherish thy wonder. It is enough that thou hast seen a
great thing: is it needful that thou shouldst prate of all thou hast
seen?"

So we came away silently, and walked through the park without looking
back. And there was a man at the gate, who opened it and seemed to say,
"Give me a little sixpence." But we gave nothing, and walked up the
hill, which was sore to climb; and on the summit found the car-boy, who
was lolling on his cushions and smoking, as happy as a lord.

<span id="img_47"></span> ![](img/47.jpg)

Quitting the waterfall at Powerscourt (the grand style in which it has
been described was adopted in order that the reader, who has probably
read other descriptions of the spot, might have at least *something* new
in this account of it), we speedily left behind us the rich and wooded
tract of country about Powerscourt, and came to a bleak tract, which,
perhaps by way of contrast with so much natural wealth, is not
unpleasing, and began ascending what is very properly called the

Long Hill. Here you see, in the midst of the loneliness, a grim-looking
barrack, that was erected when, after the Rebellion, it was necessary
for some time to occupy this most rebellious country: and a church,
looking equally dismal, a lean-looking sham Gothic building, in the
midst of this green desert. The road to Luggala, whither we were bound,
turns off the Long Hill, up another Hill, which seems still longer and
steeper, inasmuch as it was ascended perforce on foot, and over lonely
boggy moorlands, enlivened by a huge grey boulder plumped here and
there, and comes, one wonders how, to the spot close to this hill of
Slievebuck, is marked in the maps a district called "the uninhabited
country," and these stones probably fell at a period of time when not
only this district, but all the world was uninhabited,--and in some
convulsion of the neighbouring mountains this and other enormous rocks
were cast abroad.

From behind one of them, or out of the ground somehow, as we went up the
hill, sprang little ragged guides, who are always lurking about in
search of stray pence from tourists; and we had three or four of such at
our back by the time we were at the top of the hill. Almost the first
sight we saw was a smart coach and-four, with a loving wedding-party
within, and a genteel valet and lady's-maid without. I wondered had they
been burying their modest loves in the uninhabited district? But
presently, from the top of the hill, I saw the place in which their
honeymoon had been passed: nor could any pair of lovers, nor a pious
hermit bent on retirement from the world, have selected a more
sequestered spot.

Standing by a big shining granite stone on the hill-top, we looked
immediately down upon Lough Tay--a little round lake of half a mile in
length, which lay beneath us as black as a pool of ink--a high,
crumbling, white-sided mountain falling abruptly into it on the side
opposite to us, with a huge ruin of shattered rocks at its base.
Northwards, we could see between mountains a portion of the neighbouring
lake of Lough Dan--which, too, was dark, though the Annamoe river, which
connects the two lakes, lay coursing through the greenest possible flats
and shining as bright as silver. Brilliant green shores, too, come
gently down to the southern side of Lough Tay; through these runs
another river, with a small rapid or fall, which makes a music for the
lake; and here, amidst beautiful woods, lies a villa, where the four
horses, the groom and valet, the postilions, and the young couple had,
no doubt, been hiding themselves.

Hereabouts, the owner of the villa, Mr. Latouche, has a great grazing
establishment; and some herd-boys, no doubt seeing strangers on the
hill, thought proper that the cattle should stray that way, that they
might drive them back again, and parenthetically ask the travellers for
money,--everybody asks travellers for money, as it seems. Next day,
admiring in a labourer's arms a little child--his master's son, who
could not speak--the laborer, his he-nurse, spoke for him, and demanded
a little sixpence to buy the child apples. One grows not a little
callous to this sort of beggary: and the only one of our numerous young
guides who got a reward was the raggedest of them. He and his companions
had just come from school, he said,--not a Government school, but a
private one, where they paid. I asked how much,--"Was it a penny a
week?" "No not a penny a week, but so much at the end of the year." "Was
it a barrel of meal, or a few stone of potatoes, or something of that
sort? " "Yes; something of that sort."

The something must, however, have been a very small something on the
poor lad's part. He was one of four young ones, who lived with their
mother, a widow. He had no work; he could get no work; nobody had work.
His mother had a cabin with no land--not a perch of land, no
potatoes-nothing but the cabin. How did they live?--the mother knitted
stockings. I asked had she any stockings at home?--the boy said, "No."
How did he live?--he lived how he could; and we gave him threepence,
with which, in delight, he went bounding off to the poor mother.
Gracious heavens what a history to hear, told by a child looking quite
cheerful as he told it, and as if the story was quite a common one. And
a common one, too, it is and God forgive us.

Here is another, and of a similar low kind, but rather pleasanter. We
asked the car-boy how much he earned. He said, "Seven shillings a week,
and his chances"--which, in the summer season, from the number of
tourists who are jolted in his car, must be tolerably good-eight or nine
shillings a week more, probably. But, he said, in winter his master did
not hire him for the car; and he was obliged to look for work elsewhere:
as for saving, he never had saved a shilling in his life.

We asked him was he married? and he said, No, but he was *as good as
married;* for he had an old mother and four little brothers to keep, and
six mouths to feed, and to dress himself decent to drive the gentlemen.
Was not the "as good as married" a pretty expression? and might not some
of what are called their betters learn a little good from these simple
poor creatures? There's many a young fellow who sets up in the world
would think it rather hard to have four brothers to support; and I have
heard more than one genteel Christian pining over five hundred a year. A
few such may read this, perhaps let them think of the Irish widow with
the four children and *nothing,* and at least be more contented with
their port and sherry and their leg of mutton.

This brings us at once to the subject of dinner and the little village,
Roundwood, which was reached by this time, lying a few miles off from
the lakes, and reached by a road not particularly remarkable for any
picturesqueness in beauty; though you pass through a simple, pleasing
landscape, always agreeable as a repose, I think, after viewing a sight
so beautiful as those mountain lakes we have just quitted. All the hills
up which we had panted had imparted a fierce sensation of hunger; and it
was nobly decreed that we should stop in the middle of the street of
Roundwood, impartially between the two hotels, and solemnly decide upon
a resting-place after having inspected the larders and bedrooms of each.

And here, as an impartial writer, I must say that the hotel of Mr.
Wheatly possesses attractions which few men can resist, in the shape of
two very hand some young ladies his daughters; whose faces, were they
but painted on his signboard, instead of the mysterious piece which
ornaments it, would infallibly draw tourists into the house, thereby
giving the opposition inn of Murphy not the least chance of custom.

A landlord's daughters in England, inhabiting a little country inn,
would be apt to lay the cloth for the traveller, and their respected
father would bring in the first dish of the dinner; but this arrangement
is never known in Ireland: we scarcely ever see the cheering countenance
of my landlord. And as for the young ladies of Roundwood, I am bound to
say that no young persons in Baker Street could be more genteel; and
that our bill, when it was brought the next morning, was written in as
pretty and fashionable a lady's hand as ever was formed in the most
elegant finishing school at Pimlico.

Of the dozen houses of the village, the half seem to be houses of
entertainment. A green common stretches before these, with its rural
accompaniments of geese, pigs, and idlers; a park and plantation at the
end of the village, and plenty of trees round about it, give it a happy,
comfortable, English look; which is, to my notion, the best compliment
that can be paid to a hamlet: for where, after all, are villages so
pretty?

Here, rather to one's wonder-for the district was not thickly enough
populated to encourage dramatic exhibitions--a sort of theatre was
erected on the common, a ragged cloth covering the spectators and the
actors, and the former (if there were any) obtaining admittance through
two doors on the stage in front, marked "PIT & GALERY." Why should the
word not be spelt with one L as with two?

The entrance to the "pit" was stated to be threepence, and to the
"galery" twopence. We heard the drums and pipes of the orchestra as we
sat at dinner: it seemed to be a good opportunity to examine Irish
humour of a peculiar sort, and we promised ourselves a pleasant evening
in the pit.

But although the drums began to beat at half-past six, and a crowd of
young people formed round the ladder at that hour, to whom the manager
of the troop addressed the most vehement invitations to enter, nobody
seemed to be inclined to mount the steps: for the fact most likely was,
that not one of the poor fellows possessed the requisite twopence which
would induce the fat old lady who sat by it to fling open the gallery
door. At one time I thought of offering a half a crown for a purchase of
tickets for twenty, and so at once benefiting the manager and the crowd
of ragged urchins who stood wistfully without his pavilion; but it
seemed ostentatious, and we had not the courage to face the tall man in
the great coat gesticulating and shouting in front of the stage, and
make the proposition.

Why not? It would have given the company potatoes at least for supper,
and made a score of children happy. They would have seen "the learned
pig who spells your name, the feats of manly activity, the wonderful
Italian vaulting;" and they would have heard the comic songs by "your
humble servant."

"Your humble servant" was the head of the troop: a long man, with a
broad accent, a yellow top coat, and a piteous lean face. What a
speculation was this poor fellow's! he must have a company of at least a
dozen to keep. There were three girls in trousers, who danced in front
of the stage, in Polish caps, tossing their arms about to the tunes of
three musicianers; there was a page, two young tragedy-actors, and a
clown; there was the fat old woman at the gallery door waiting for the
twopences; there was the Jack Pudding; and it was evident that there
must have been some one within, or else who would take care of the
learned pig?

The poor manager stood in front, and shouted to the little Irishry
beneath; but no one seemed to move. Then he brought forward Jack
Pudding, and had a dialogue with him; the jocularity of which, by
heavens! made the heart ache to hear. We had determined, at least, to go
to the play before that, but the dialogue was too much: we were obliged
to walk away, unable to face that dreadful Jack Pudding, and heard the
poor manager shouting still for many hours through the night, and the
drums thumping vain invitations to the people. O unhappy children of the
Hibernian Thespis! it is my belief that they must have eaten the learned
pig that night for supper.

It was Sunday morning when we left the little inn at Round-wood: the
people were flocking in numbers to church, on cars and pillions, neat,
comfortable, and well-dressed. We saw in this country more health, more
beauty, and more shoes than I have remarked in any quarter. That famous
resort of sightseers, the Devil's Glen, lies at a few miles' distance
from the little village; and, having gone on the car as near to the spot
as the road permitted, we made across the fields-boggy, stony,
ill-tilled fields they were--for about a mile, at the end of which walk
we found ourselves on the brow of the ravine that has received so ugly a
name.

Is there a legend about the place? No doubt for this, as for almost
every other natural curiosity in Ireland, there is some tale of monk,
saint, fairy, or devil; but our guide on the present day was a barrister
from Dublin, who did not deal in fictions by any means so romantic, and
the history, whatever it was, remained untold. Perhaps the little
breechesless cicerone who offered himself would have given us the story,
but we dismissed the urchin with scorn, and had to find our own way
through bush and bramble down to the entrance of the gully.

Here we came on a cataract, which looks very big in Messrs. Curry's
pretty little Guide-book (that every traveller to Wicklow will be sure
to have in his pocket); but the waterfall, on this shining Sabbath
morning, was disposed to labour as little as possible, and indeed is a
spirit of a very humble, ordinary sort.

But there is a ravine of a mile and a half, through which a river runs
roaring (a lady who keeps. the gate will not object to receive a
gratuity)--there is a ravine, or Devil's glen, which forms a delightful
wild walk, and where a Methuselah of a landscape-painter might find
studies for all his life long. All sorts of foliage and colour, all
sorts of delightful caprices of light and shadow--the river tumbling and
frothing amidst the boulders--"raucum per laevia murmur saxa clens," and
a chorus of 150,000 birds (there might be more), hopping, twittering,
singing under the clear cloudless Sabbath scene, make this walk one of
the most delightful that can be taken; and indeed I hope there is no
harm in saying that you may get as much out of an hour's walk there as
out of the best hour's extempore preaching. But this was as a salvo to
our conscience for not being at church.

Here, however, was a long aisle, arched gothically overhead, in a much
better taste than is seen in some of those dismal new churches; and, by
way of painted glass, the sun lighting up multitudes of various-coloured
leaves, and the birds for choristers, and the river by way of organ, and
in it stones enough to make a whole library of sermons. No man can walk
in such a place without feeling grateful, and grave, and humble; and
without thanking heaven for it as he comes away. And, walking and musing
in this free, happy place, one could not help thinking of a million and
a half of brother cockneys shut up in their huge prison (the tread-mill
for the day being idle), and told by some legislators that relaxation is
sinful, that works of art are abominations except on week-days, and that
their proper place of resort is a dingy tabernacle, where a loud-voiced
man is howling about hell-fire in bad grammar. Is not this beautiful
world, too, a part of our religion? Yes, truly, in whatever way my Lord
John Russell may vote; and it is to be learned without having recourse
to any professor at any Bethesda, Ebenezer, or Jerusalem: there can be
no mistake about it; no terror, no bigoted dealing of damnation to one's
neighbour: it is taught without false emphasis or vain spouting on the
preacher's part-how should there be such with such a preacher?

This wild onslaught upon sermons and preachers needs perhaps an
explanation: for which purpose we must whisk back out of the Devil's
Glen (improperly so named) to Dublin, and to this day week, when, at
this very time, I heard one of the first preachers of the city deliver a
sermon that lasted for an hour and twenty minutes--time enough to walk
up the Glen and back, and remark a thousand delightful things by the
way.

Mr. G---'s church (though there would be no harm in mentioning the
gentleman's name, for a more conscientious and excellent man, as it is
said, cannot be) is close by the Custom House in Dublin, and crowded
morning and evening with his admirers. The service was beautifully read
by him, and the audience joined in the responses, and in the psalms and
hymns, \[Here is an extract from one of thwe latter -

"Hasten to some distant isle,  
In the bosom of the deep,  
Where the skies for ever smile,  
And the blacks forever weep."

  
Is it not a shame that such nonsensical twaddle should be sung in a
house of the Church of England, and by people assembled for grave and
decent worship.\] with a fervour which is very unusual in England. Then
came the sermon; and what more can be said of it than that it was
extempore, and lasted for an hour and twenty minutes? The orator never
failed once for a word, so amazing is his practice; though, as a
stranger to this kind of exercise, I could not help trembling for the
performer, as one has for Madame Saqui on the slack-rope, in the midst
of a blaze of rockets and squibs, expecting every minute she must go
over. But the artist was too skilled for that; and after some tremendous
bound of a metaphor, in the midst of which you expect he must tumble
neck and heels, and be engulfed in the dark abyss of nonsense, down he
was sure to come, in a most graceful attitude too, in the midst of a
fluttering "Ah!" from a thousand wondering people.

But I declare solemnly that when I came to try and recollect of what the
exhibition consisted, and give an account of the sermon at dinner that
evening, it was quite impossible to remember a word of it; although, to
do the orator justice, he repeated many of his opinions a great number
of times oven Thus, if he had to discourse of death to us, it was, "At
the approach of the Dark Angel of the Grave," "At the coming of the grim
King of Terrors," "At the warning of that awful Power to whom all of us
must bow down," "At the summons of that Pallid Spectre whose equal foot
knocks at the monarch's tower or the poor man's cabin "-and so forth.
There is an examiner of plays, and indeed there ought to be an examiner
of sermons, by which audiences are to be fully as much inured or
misguided as by the other named exhibitions. What call have reverend
gentlemen to repeat their dicta half a dozen times over, like Sir Robert
Peel when he says anything that he fancies to be witty? Why are men to
be kept for an hour and twenty minutes listening to that which may be
more effectually said in twenty? And it need not be said here that a
church is not a sermon-house--that it is devoted to a purpose much more
lofty and sacred, for which has been set apart the noblest service,
every single word of which latter has been previously weighed with the
most scrupulous and thoughtful reverence. And after this sublime work of
genius, learning, and piety is concluded, is it not a shame that a man
should mount a desk, who has not taken the trouble to arrange his words
beforehand, and speak thence his crude opinions in his doubtful grammar?
It will be answered that the extempore preacher does not deliver crude
opinions, but that he arranges his discourse beforehand: to all which it
which it may be replied that Mr.---contradicted himself more than once
in the course of the above oration, and repeated himself a half-dozen of
times. A man in that place has no right to say a word too much or too
little.

And it comes to this,--it is the preacher the people follow, not the
prayers; or why is this church more frequented than any other? It is
that warm emphasis, and word-mouthing, and vulgar imagery, and glib
rotundity of phrase, which brings them together and keeps them happy and
breathless. Some of this class call the Cathedral Service *Paddy's
Opera;* they say it is Popish--downright scarlet--they won't go to it.
They will have none but their own hymns--and pretty they are--no
ornaments but those of their own minister, his rank incense and tawdry
rhetoric. Coming out of the church, on the Custom House steps hard by,
there was a fellow with a bald large forehead, a new black coat, a
little Bible, spouting-spouting "in omne volubilis aevum"--the very
counterpart of the reverend gentleman hard by. It was just the same
thing, just as well done the eloquence quite as easy and round, the
amplification as ready, the big words rolling round the tongue just as
within doors. But we are out of the Devil's Glen by this time; and
perhaps, instead of delivering a sermon there, we had better have been
at church hearing one.

The country people, however, are far more pious; and the road along
which we went to Glendalough was thronged with happy figures of people
plodding to or from mass. A chapel-yard was covered with grey cloaks;
and at a little inn hard by, stood numerous carts, cars, shandrydans,
and pillioned horses, awaiting the end of the prayers. The aspect of the
country is wild, and beautiful of course; but why try to describe it? I
think the Irish scenery just like the Irish melodies--sweet, wild, and
sad even in the sunshine. You can neither represent one nor the other by
words; but I am sure if one could translate "The Meeting of the Waters "
into form and colours, it would fall into the exact shape of a tender
Irish landscape. So take and play that tune upon your fiddle, and shut
your eyes, and muse a little, and you have the whole scene before you.

I don't know if there is any tune about Glendalough; but if there be, it
must be the most delicate, fantastic, fairy melody that ever was played.
Only fancy can describe the charms of that delightful place. Directly
you see it, it smiles at you as innocent and friendly as a little child;
and once seen, it becomes your friend forever, and you are always happy
when you think of it. Here is a little lake, and little fords across it,
surrounded by little mountains, and which lead you now to little islands
where there are all sorts of fantastic little old chapels and
graveyards; or, again, into little brakes and shrubberies where small
rivers are crossing over little rocks, plashing and jumping, and singing
as loud as ever they can. Thomas Moore has written rather an awful
description of it; and it may indeed appear big to *him,* and to the
fairies who must have inhabited the place in old days, that's clear. For
who could be accommodated in it except the little people?

There are seven churches, whereof the clergy must have been the smallest
persons, and have had the smallest benefices and the littlest
congregations ever known. As for the cathedral, what a bishoplet it must
have been that presided there. The place would hardly hold the Bishop of
London, or Mr. Sydney Smith--two full-sized clergymen of these days--who
would be sure to quarrel there for want of room, or for any other
reason. There must have been a dean no bigger than Mr. Moore before
mentioned, and a chapter no bigger than that chapter in "Tristram
Shandy" which does not contain a single word, and mere popguns of
canons, and a beadle about as tall as Crofton Croker, to whip the little
boys who were playing at taw (with peas) in the yard.

They say there was a university, too, in the place, with I don't know
how many thousand scholars; but for accounts of this there is an
excellent guide on the spot, who, for a shilling or two, will tell all
he knows, and a great deal more too. There are numerous legends, too,
concerning St. Kevin, and Fin MacCoul and the Devil, and the deuce knows
what. But these stories are, I am bound to say, abominably stupid and
stale; and some guide \[It must he said, for the worthy fellow who
accompanied us, and who acted as cicerone previously to the great
Willis, the great Hall, the great Barrow, that though he wears a ragged
coat his manners are those of a gentleman, and his conversation evinces
no small talent, taste, and scholarship.\] ought to be seized upon and
choked, and flung into the lake, by way of warning to the others to stop
their interminable prate. This is the curse attending curiosity, for
visitors to most all the show-places in the country: you have not only
the guide--who himself talks too much-but a string of ragged amateurs,
starting from bush and briar, ready to carry his honour's umbrella or my
lady's cloak, or to help either up a bank or across a stream. And all
the while they look wistfully in your face, saying, "Give me Sixpence!"
as clear as looks can speak. The unconscionable rogues! how dare they,
for the sake of a little starvation or so, interrupt gentlefolks in
their pleasure!

A long tract of wild country, with a park or two here and there, a
police-barrack perched on a hill, a half-starved looking church
stretching its long scraggy steeple over a wide plain, mountains whose
base is richly cultivated while their tops are purple and lonely, warm
cottages and farms nestling at the foot of the bills, and humble cabins
here and there on the wayside, accompany the car, that jingles back over
fifteen miles of ground through Inniskerry to Dray. You pass by wild
gaps and Greater and Lesser Sugar Loaves; and about eight o'clock, when
the sky is quite red with sunset, and the long shadows are of such a
purple as (they may say what they like) Claude could no more paint than
I can, you catch a glimpse of the sea beyond Bray, and crying out,
"θάλαra!, θάλαra!" affect to be wondrously delighted by the sight of
that element.

The fact is, however, that at Bray is one of the best inns in Ireland;
and there you may be perfectly sure is a good dinner ready, five minutes
after the honest car-boy, with innumerable hurroos and smacks of his
whip, has brought up his passengers to the door with a gallop.

\*

As for the Vale of Avoca, I have not described that: because (as has
been before occasionally remarked) it is vain to attempt to describe
natural beauties; and because, secondly (though this is a minor
consideration), we did not go thither. But we went on another day to the
Dargle, and to Shanganah, and the city of Cabinteely, and to the
Scalp--that wild pass: and I have no more to say about them than about
the Vale of Avoca. The Dublin Cockney, who has these places at his door,
knows them quite well: and as for the Londoner, who is meditating a trip
to the Rhine for the summer, or to Brittany or Normandy, let us beseech
him to see his *own country first* (if Lord Lyndhurst will allow us to
call this a part of it); and it after twenty-four hours of an easy
journey from London, the Cockney be not placed in the midst of a country
as beautiful, as strange to him, as romantic as the most imaginative man
on 'Change can desire,--may this work be praised by the critics all
round and never reach a second edition
