# THE YOUTH OF FION

The faithful Boghmin lovingly executed her trust, and, assisted by the
sage woman Fiecal, reared up the son of Cumhail in a cavern on 'the
side' of Slieve Bloom (*Blama*). She called him Deimne, and he gave
evidence' of his noble race at an early age. When a youth, his
foster-mother ventured with him as far as Tarn, at the celebration of
games by youths not yet qualified for the rank of Curai. He so
distinguished himself, that the King cried out in admiration, "What is
the name of this *Paustha* *Fion* (fine youth)?" "I thank you, O Con of
the Hundred Fights," answered his nurse, "for having conferred a name on
him. Fion he is, and Fion he shall remain." "By your royal hand," said
one of the Conacht laochs, "that is the son of Cumhail, son of Trenmor:
let him be secured." But the word was too late. Boghmin, seizing her
boy, and flinging him on her shoulders, had passed through the assembly
before anything could be done, and the fleet runner, not yet having lost
the cunning of her limbs, soon put sufficient distance between her
charge and his enemies.

The next exploit performed by our youth was the acquisition of
supernatural knowledge, by tasting the salmon that was intended for the
Druid Fion.

This sage, not content with his own acquired wisdom, was determined on
securing the "salmon of knowledge," whose taste would make him cognizant
of everything passing in Erinn at any time. He stationed himself at a
ford on the Boyne, and employed all his pupils, among whom was Fion
(then called Deimne) catching salmon, broiling them, and serving them
up. They had strict charge not to let any of the cooked fish
touch--their tongues or lips. One day Fion, seeing a blister on the side
of the fish that was then in the pan, pressed it down with his thumb,
and getting a smart burn, he applied it (the thumb) to his lips, and at
once found himself aware of what was passing in the courts of Tara, of
Naas, and Emania. He at once ran to the Druid and told him what had
happened.

"How can this be?" said the disappointed Druid. "I know by my art that
the salmon of knowledge was to be tasted by a Fion. I am Fion, and you,
are Deimne." "Ay, but I am Fion also, thus named by Con of the Hundred
Battles himself." "Well, well, I see fate is against me. Keep yourself
out of the power of the Ard-Righ for a time. When the opportunity
arrives, acquaint him with your newly-acquired faculty, and he will be
only too happy to make you chief commander of the Fiarina."
