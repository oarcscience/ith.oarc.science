# JACK THE MASTER AND JACK THE SERVANT.

There was once a poor couple, and they had three sons, and the
*youngest's* name was Jack. One harvest day, the eldest fellow threw
down his hook, and says he, "What's the use to be slaving this way? I'll
go seek my fortune." And the second son said the very same; and says
Jack, "I'll go seek my fortune along, with you, but let us first leave
the harvest stacked for the old couple,"

Well, he over-persuaded them, and bedad, as soon as it was safe, they
kissed their father and mother, and off they set, every one with three
pounds in his pocket, promising to be home again in a year and a day.
The first night they had no better lodging than .a fine dry dyke of a
ditch, outside of a churchyard. Before they went to sleep, the youngest
got inside to read the tombstones. What should he stumble over but a
coffin and the sod was just taken off where the grave was to be. "Some
poor body," says he, "that was without friends to put him in consecrated
ground: he mustn't be left this way." So he threw off his coat, and had
a couple of feet cleared out, when a terrible giant walked up. "What are
you at?" says he; "The corpse owed me a guinea, and he sha'n't be buried
till it is paid." " Well, here is your guinea," says Jack, "and leave
the churchyard, it's nothing the better for your company." Well, he got
down a couple of feet more, when another uglier giant again, with two
heads on him, came and stopped Jack with the same story, and got his
guinea; and when the grave was six feet down, the third giant looks on
him, and he had three heads. So Jack was obliged to part with his three
guineas before he could put the sod over the poor man. Then he went and
lay down by his brothers, and slept till the sun began to shine on their
faces next morning.

They soon came to a cross-road, and there every one took his own way.
Jack told them how all his money was gone, but not a farthing did they
offer him. Well, after some time, Jack found himself hungry, and so he
sat down by the road side, and pulled out a piece of cake and a lump of
bacon. Just as he had the first bit in his mouth, up comes a poor man,
and asks something of him for God's sake. "I have neither brass, gold,
nor silver about me," says Jack; "and here's all the provisions I'm
master of. Sit down and have a share." Well the poor man didn't require
much pressing, and when the meal was over, says he, "Sir, where are you
bound for?" "Faith, I don't know," says Jack; "I'm going to seek my
fortune." "I'll go with you for your servant," says the other, "Servant
*inagh* (forsooth)! had I want a servant--I, that's looking out for a
place myself." "No matter. You gave Christian burial to my poor brother
yesterday evening. He appeared to me in a dream, and told me where I'd
find you, and that I was to be your servant for a years So you'll be
Jack the master, and I Jack the servant." "Well, let it be so."

After sunset, they came to a castle in a wood, and "Here," says the
servant, "lives the giant with one head, that wouldn't let my poor
brother be buried." He took hold of a club that hung by the door, and
gave two or three *thravallys* on it. "What do yous want?" says the
giant, looking out through a grating. "Oh, sir, honey!" says jack, "we
want to save you. The king is sending 100,000 men to take your life for
all the wickedness you ever done to poor travellers, and that. So
because you let my brother be buried, I came to help you." "Oh, murdher,
murdher, what'll I do at all at all?" says he. "Have you e'er a
hiding-place?" says Jack. "I have a cave seven miles long, and it opens
into the bawn." "That'll do. Leave a good supper for the men, and then
don't stir out of your pew till I call you." So they went in, and the
giant left a good supper for the army, and went down, and they shut the
trap-door down on him.

Well, they ate and they drank, and then Jack *gother* all the horses and
cows, and drove them *over an hether* the trap-door, and such fighting
and shouting, whinnying and lowing, as they had, and such noise as they
made! Then jack opened the door, and called out, "Are you there, sir?"
"I am," says he, from a mile or two inside. "Wor you frightened, sir?"
"You may say frightened. Are they gone away?" "Dickens a go they'll go
till you give them your sword of sharpness." "Cock them up with the
sword of sharpness. I won't give them a smite of it." "Well, I think
you're right. Look out. They'll be down with you in the twinkling of a
harrow pin. Go to the end of the cave, and they won't have your head for
an hour to come." "Well, that's no great odds; you'll find it in the
closet inside the parlour. D--do 'em good with it." "Very well," says
Jack; "when they're all cleared off I'll drop a big stone on the
trapdoor." So the two jacks slept very *combustible* in the giant's
bed--it was big enough for them; and next morning, after breakfast, they
dropped the big stone on the trap-door, and away they went.

That night they slept at the castle of the two-headed giant, and got his
cloak of darkness in the same way; and the next night they slept at the
castle of the three-headed giant,--and got his shoes of swiftness; and
the next night they were near the king's palace. "Now," says Jack the
servant, "this king has a daughter, and she was so proud that twelve
princes killed themselves for her, because she would not marry any of
them. At last the King of *Morôco* thought to persuade her, and the
dickens a bit of him she'd have no more nor the others. So he fell on
his sword, and died; and the old boy got leave to give him a. kind of
life again, to punish the proud lady. Maybe it's an imp from hell is in
his appearance. He lives in a palace one side of the river, and the
king's palace is on the other, and he has got power over the princess
and her father; and when they have the heads of twelve *courtiers* over
the gate, the King of Moroco will have the princess to himself, and
maybe the evil spirit will have them both. Every young man that offers
himself has to do three things, and if he fails in all, up goes his
head. There you see them--eleven, all black and white, with the sun and
rain. You must try your hand. God is stronger than the devil."

So they came to the gate. "What do you want?" says the guard. "I want to
get the princess for my wife." "Do 'you see them heads?" "Yes; what of
that?" "Yours will be along with them before you're a week older."
"That's my own look out." "Well, go on. God help all foolish people!"
The king was on his throne in the big hall, and the princess sitting on
a golden chair by his side. "Death or my daughter, I suppose," says the
king to Jack the master. "Just so, my liege," says jack. "Very well,"
says the king. "I don't know whether I'm glad or sorry," says he. "If
you don't succeed in the three things, my daughter must marry the King
of Moroco. If you do succeed, I suppose we'll be savd from the dog's
life we are leading. I'll leave my daughter's scissors in your bedroom
to-night, and you'll find no one going in till morning. If you have the
scissors still at sunrise, your head will be safe for that day. Next day
you must run a race against the King of Moroco, and if you win, your
head will be safe that day too. Next day you must bring me the King of
Moroco's head, or your own head, and then all this bother will be over
one way or the other."

Well, they gave the two a good supper, and one time the princess would
look sweet at jack, and another time sour; for you know she was under
enchantment. Sometimes she'd wish him killed, sometimes she'd like him
to be saved.

When they went into their bedroom, the king came in along with them, and
laid the scissors on the table. "Mind that," says he, "and I'm sure I
don't know whether I wish to find it there to-morrow or not." Well, poor
Jack was a little frightened, but his man encouraged him. "Go to bed,"
says he; "I'll put on the cloak of darkness, and watch, and I hope
you'll find the scissors there at sunrise." Well, bedad he couldn't go
to sleep. He kept his eye on the scissors till the dead hour, and the
moment it struck twelve no scissors could he see: it vanished as clean
as a whistle. He looked here, there, and everywhere--no scissors.
"Well," says he, "there's hope still. Are you there, Jack?" but no
answer came. "I can do no more," says he. "I'll go to bed." And to bed
he went, and slept.

Just as the clock was striking, Jack in the cloak saw the wall opening,
and the princess walking in, going over to the table, taking up the
scissors, and walking out again. He followed her into the garden, and
there he saw herself and her twelve maids going down to the boat that
was lying by the bank. "I'm in," says the princess; "I'm in," says one
maid; and "I'm in," says another; and so on till all were in; and "I'm
in," says jack. "Who's that?" says the last maid. "Go look," says Jack.
Well, they were all a bit frightened. When they got over, they walked up
to the King of Moroco's palace, and there the King of Moroco was to
receive them, and give them the best of eating and drinking, and make hs
musicianers play the finest music for them.

When they were coming away, says the princess, Here's the scissors; mind
it or not as you like." "Oh, won't I mind it!" says he. "Here you go,"
says he again, opening a chest, and dropping it into it, and locking it
up with three locks. But before he shut down the lid, my brave jack
picked up the scissors, and put it safe into his pocket. Well, When they
came to the boat, the same things were said, and the maids were
frightened again.

When Jack the master awoke in the morning, the first thing he saw as the
scissors on the table, and the next thing he saw was his man lying
asleep in the other bed, the next was the cloak of darkness hanging on
the bed's foot. Well, he got up, and he danced, and he sung, and he
hugged Jack; and when the king came in with a troubled face, there was
the scissors safe and sound.

Well, Jack," says he, "you're safe for one day more." The king and
princess were more *meentrach* (loving) to Jack to-day than they were
yesterday, and the next day the race was to be run.

At last the hour of noon came, and there was the King of Moroco with
tight clothes on him--themselves, and his hair, and his eyes as black as
a crow, and his face as yellow as a kite's claw. Jack was there too, and
on his feet were the shoes of swiftness. When the bugle blew, they were
off, and jack went seven times round the course while the king went one:
it was like the fish in the water, the arrow from a bow, the stone from
a sling, or a star shooting in the night. When the race was won, and the
people were shouting, the black king looked at Jack like the very devil
himself, and says he, "Don't holloa till you're out of the
wood--to-morrow your head or mine." "Heaven is stronger than hell," says
Jack.

And now the princess began to wish in earnest that Jack would win, for
two parts of the charm were broke. So some one from her told Jack the
servant that she and her maids should pay their visit to the Black
Fellow at midnight like every other night past. Jack the servant was in
the garden in his cloak when the hour came, and they all said the same
words, and rowed over, and went un to the palace like as they done
before.

The king was in a great state of fear and anger, and scolded the
princess, and she didn't seem to care much about it; but when they were
leaving she said, "You know to-morrow is to have your head or jack's
head off. I suppose you will stay up all night!" He was standing on the
grass when they were getting into the boat, and just as the last maid
had her foot on the edge of it, Jack swept off his head with the sword
of sharpness just as if it was the head of a thistle, and put it under
his cloak. The body fell on the grass and made no noise. Well, the same
moment the princess felt any liking she had for him all gone like last
year's snow, and she began to sob and cry for fear of anything happening
to Jack. The maids were not very good at all, and so, from the moment
they got out of the boat, Jack kept knocking the head against their
faces and their legs, and made them roar and bawl till they were inside
of the palace.

The first thing Jack the master saw when he woke in the morning, was the
black head on the table, and didn't he jump up in a hurry. When the sun
was rising, every one in the palace, great and small, were in the bawn
before Jack's window, and the king was at the door. "Jack," said 'he,
"if you haven't the King of Moroco's head on a gad, your own will be on
a spear, my poor fellow." But just at the moment he heard a great shout
from the bawn. Jack the servant was after opening the window, and
holding out the King of Moroco's head by the long black hair.

So the princess, and the king, and all were in joy, and maybe they
didn't keep the wedding long a-waiting. A year and a day after Jack left
home, himself and his wife were in their coach at the cross-roads, and
there were the two poor brothers, sleeping in the ditch with their
reaping-hooks by their sides. They wouldn't believe Jack at first that
he was their brother, and then they were ready to eat their nails for
not sharing with him that day twelvemonth. They found their father and
mother alive, and you may be sure they left them comfortable. So you see
what a good thing in the end it is to be charitable to the poor, dead or
alive.

 

In some versions of "Jack the Master," &c, Jack the servant is the
spirit of the buried man. He aids and abets his master in leaving the
giants interred alive in their caves, and carrying off their gold and
silver, and he helps him to cheat his future father-in-law at cards, and
bears a hand in other proceedings, most disgraceful to any ghost
encumbered with a conscience. As originally told, the anxiety of the
hero to bestow sepulchral rites on the corpse, arose from his wish to
rescue the soul from its dismal wanderings by the gloomy Styx. In
borrowing these fictions from their heathen predecessors, the Christian
storytellers did not take much trouble to correct their laxity on the
subject of moral obligations. Theft, manslaughter, and disregard of
marriage vows, often pass uncensured by the free and easy narrator.

Silly as the poor hero of the next tale may appear, he is kept in
countenance by the German "Hans in Luck," by the world-renowned Wise Men
of Gotham, and even the sage Gooroo, of Hindoostan. In a version of the
legend given by a servant girl, who came from the *Roer* in Kilkenny,
and had only slight knowledge of English, Thigue distinguished himself
by an exploit more worthy of his character than any in the text. He
stood in the market, with a web of cloth under his arm for sale. "Bow
wow," says a dog, looking up at him. "Five pounds," says Thigue; "Bow
wow," says the dog again. "Well, here it is for you," says Thigue. His
reception by his mother at eventide may be guessed.
