# The Tobinstown Sheeoge.

In the pleasant valley of the Duffrey, sheltered from the north-west
winds by the huge pile of Mount Leinster, lie two villages separated by
a turf bog. The western cluster is called Kennystown, and the eastern,
Tobinstown. \[a\] The extensive Rath of Cromogue commands the bog on the
north, and the over-abounding moisture in the holes and drains finds its
way to the noisy Glasha on the south. The elder inhabitants of these
villages spoke the Irish tongue at the close of the last century and the
beginning of this. About the year 1809, the inhabitants of the whole
valley spent a Sunday afternoon on the dry tussocks of the bog, sounding
the dark pools with long poles and fishing spears, to stir up a
descendant of the serpent that had laid the country waste in the days of
Brian Boroimhe. Some intelligent person had seen it lying on the surface
of Lough na Piastha about half a mile off, a day or two before, and a
still more intelligent person had seen it tearing across the
intermediate fields on Saturday night, with sparks of fire flashing from
its tail. If the young piast was at the bottom of a bog-hole he remained
there quietly enough. The enthusiastic crowd was obliged to separate at
nightfall, no incident having rewarded their expectations beyond the
fall of a little boy into a turf-pool, his rescue and consequent
punishment by a loving but irritable parent. This, however, is no better
than a digression.

Katty Clarke of Tobinstown was once happy in the possession of a fine
boy, the delight of her eyes and heart, till one unlucky day, when she
happened to sleep

too long in the morning, and, consequently, had not time to say her
prayers. Mr. Clarke, coming in from the fields, was annoyed at not
finding the stirabout ready, and opened his mind on the subject. Katty
was vexed with him and herself, and cursed a little, as was customary
sixty years since among men and women in remote districts of our
country. All these annoyances prevented her from remembering the holy
water, and from sprinkling some drops on her little son, and making the
sign of the cross on his innocent forehead. When the men and boys left
the house for their out-door work after breakfast, Katty took a pailful
of soiled linen to the spot where the stream formed a little pool, and
where the villagers had fixed a broad and flat "beetling" stone. While
she was employed in cleaning the clothes, she let her child sit or roll
about on the grassy slope behind her.

All at once she heard a scream from the boy, and when she turned, and
ran to him, she found him in convulsions. She ran home with him,
administered salt and water, and the other specifics popular in the
country. The fit passed away, but she was grieved to perceive that the
weazened, pained expression still remained on his face, and that his
whimpering and whining did not abate--in fact, to use a well-worn Irish
expression, "the cry was never out of his mouth." He ate as much as
would suffice a full-grown man, and was always ready for food both at
regular meal-times and between them.

After a week of this state of things, the neighbours came to the
conclusion that it was a sheeoge that Katty was slaving her life out
for. Katty's family came next into the same persuasion, and lastly, but
with some doubts, Katty herself.

At a family and neighbourly council, held round the fire, after the
children had been sent to bed, they proceeded to get rid of the little
wretch, and this was the order of the ceremonial:--

A neighbour took the shovel, rubbed it clean, laid it on the floor, and
his wife, seizing on the supposed fairy, placed it sitting on the broad
iron blade. She held it there stoutly, notwithstanding its howls, while
her husband, raising it gently, proceeded to the bawn, accompanied by
the assembly, and, despite all opposition on its part, placed it on a
wisp of straw which crowned the manure heap. The luxury of the seat did
not succeed in arresting his outcries, but his audience not taking much
notice, joined hands, and in their own parlance serenaded the crowned
heap three times, while the fairy-man, who had been summoned from
Bawnard (high court), recited an incantation in Irish, of which we give
a literal version

"Come at our call, O Sighe mother  
Come and remove your offspring.  
Food and drink he has received,  
And kindness from the Ben-a-teagh. \[b\]  
Here he no longer shall stay,  
But depart to the Duine Matha.  
Restore the lost child, O Bean-Sighe! \[c\]  
And food shall be left for thy people  
When the cloth is spread on the harvest-field,  
On the short grass newly mown.  
Food shall be left on the dresser-shelf,  
And the hearthstone shall be clean,  
When the Clann Sighe come in crowds,  
And sweep in rings round the floor,  
And hold their feast at the fire.  
Restore the mortal child, O Bean-Sighe!  
And receive thine own at our hands.

The charm and the third round ending at the same time, all re-entered
the house, and closed the door.

They soon felt the air around them sweep this way and that, as if it was
stirred by the motion of wings, but they remained quiet and silent for
about ten minutes. Opening the door, they then looked out, and saw the
bundle of straw on the heap, but neither child nor fairy. "Go into your
bedroom, Katty," said the fairy-man, "and see if there's anything left
on the bed." She did so, and they soon heard a cry of joy, and Katty was
among them in a moment, kissing and hugging her own healthy-looking
child, who was waking and rubbing his eyes, and wondering at the lights
and all the eager faces.

Whatever hurry Katty might be in of a morning after that, she never left
her bedside till she had finished, as devoutly as she could, her five
Paters and five Ayes, and her Apostles' Creed and her Confiteor. And she
never cursed or swore except when she was surprised by a sudden fit of
passion.

 

In one point of elvish mythology, Teuton and Celt are agreed,--viz.,
that whether the supernatural beings of the old superstition be called
fairies, elves, nixes, trolls, korigans, or duergars, they all live in
fear of utter condemnation at the Day of Judgment. Their dislike of the
human race arises from envy of their destiny, which they regard as the
filling of the heavenly seats lost by themselves. Sometimes they
experience a slight hope that their place may not be with Satan and his
angels, and then they become urgent with holy and wise mortals, to give
judgment on their case. This phase of fairy life will be illustrated by
the local legend of--

\[a\] Let no incautious reader suppose that these villages were
respectively inhabited by Tobins and Kennys. There was one family of
Tobins extant, we forget in which village, but no Kenny in either. Thus
Forrestalstown was filled by O'Learys, the Forrestals occupying a
village in Gurawn entirely to themselves.

\[c\] Lady fairy.
