# INIS NA MUIC. \[a\]

The fated children of Gad Glas sailed from Egypt into the Black Sea, and
thence through the waters which filled the Riphean Valley, \[b\] and
made a temporary lodgement in the southern part of Scandinavia. Their
next voyage was to Spain; and at last, the great-grandchildren of those
who had quitted Egypt *temp.* Phar.) determined to make their permanent
abode in the green island, which Breogan, their chief, had discovered
from a watch-tower on Cape Ortegal. The brave old historians
occasionally omitted details: they have left no account of the
construction of the telescope used in the operation.

The Danaan Princes, either through negligence or design, allowed the
invaders to land without opposition, and then a parley ensued. They
demanded of the newcomers their objects and conditions, and received an
answer similar to that given by themselves to the poor Firbolgs some
generations back. They rejoined that it was a most unhandsome thing to
take people by surprise in that fashion; but if they only re-embarked,
and withdrew nine waves from the land, they would then receive them in a
manner meet for warlike visitors, and their own relations in the
twentieth degree. The simple Milesians consented; and by the time that
the nine waves were passed, a druidic fog had fallen between them and
the shore. Occasionally a luminous rift was made in this dark curtain,
and the island was seen in the guise of the back of a black swine,
weltering on the waters, and shooting up huge spear-like bristles. A
mighty storm next swept the vessels round the rocky shores. Some
effected a landing in Kerry, others in Louth, and the rest on the bleak
western coast. The wise and valiant Danaans at last found their spells
and their arms too weak before the resistless might of the Milesians,
and a new dynasty began.

Mrs. K--, of Cromogue, in the "Duffrey," is the only authority we have
for the veracity of the following very ancient tradition. A version of
it is to be found in Keating; but we have several reasons for believing
that she and her authorities had got their legend through an oral
channel. It is out of our power to settle the question of the
navigability of the Slaney to Enrmiscorthy at the date of the story. The
corrachs, as may be supposed, drew but few feet of water. Another
admirer of past things, who only remembered a small portion of the
story, placed this fortress some miles lower.

\[a\] Island of the Pig.

\[b\] The maps used by Homer, and the romantic annalists of Ireland,
exhibited a sea (part of the great Ocean Stream) covering the sites now
occupied by South Russia, Poland, and North Germany, thus connecting the
Euxine with the Baltic.
