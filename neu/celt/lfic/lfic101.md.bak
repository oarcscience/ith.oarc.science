# THE CORPSE-FREIGHTED BARQUE.

Colum Cillé, who had preached the Gospel to the heathen Picts, and built
the monastery of Iona in the Hebrides, the: chief seat of religion in
the Highlands and isles for centuries, died there after a most active
life, telling his monks in his last hours that he wished his remains to
be laid by those of the blessed Patrick and Brigid. *Festina lente* was
the order of the day. Most leisurely was their haste in the execution of
his wishes. In fact, they could not bring themselves to expedite the
removal of the holy relics from the scene of his past and their own
present labours. Perhaps they might find courage to commence the voyage
tomorrow, next week, next year. No one could tell what might occur if
sufficient time were given. However, they were rather dismayed one fine
morning on finding the coffin absent from its accustomed place. Dire was
the alarm, earnest the search; but instead of recovering coffin or body,
a little barque, which yesterday floated at its mooring beside the quay,
was also missing. The pious but procrastinating community did the wisest
thing under the circumstances. They sent three of the brethren, men
skilled in the simple navigation of the time, with directions to explore
all the waters that lay been lona and Down, and, if unsuccessful so far,
to make inquiries of the ecclesiastical authorities of the latter place
concerning the missing body of St. Columba.

The legend says nothing of the voyage till the questing barque was made
fast to a post within the loch of Down. As the three monks disembarked
they discovered an old brother of theirs, from whom they had been
separated for years. Salutations, questions, and answers crossed one
another rather confusedly on both sides at first, each party being full
of the one absorbing subject. The following is the account given by
their recovered friend, divested of the ejaculations and interruptions
which accompanied it -

"A week since, just as the sun was directly in the south, the loiterers
and labourers on the shore observed a small object far at sea making for
the harbour, but their wonder was great when, as it approached, they
found it to be a decked boat with sails closely furled, yet proceeding
at a rapid speed through the water. No oars were visible, but still it
came swiftly onward, leaving a long, straight line of foam behind. The
crowd that thronged the shore as it came in, were on their knees, as
much from fear as piety, 'and praying earnestly, but no one dared to
enter the enchanted boat till the bishop and three of his clergy, who
had learned the news, came from the cathedral, in their robes, and went
on deck, scattering incense and singing hymns. They went below, and
after what seemed a long hour to the crowd, they came up again bearing a
coffin, which they laid upon the deck. The bishop then addressed the
assembly, informing them that within the coffin lay the still un-decayed
body of St. Colum Cillé, evidently sent by Heaven to repose beside those
of St. Patrick and St. Brigid. The whole multitude broke out at once
with the hymn, 'Laudate Dominum,' and when it ended, with the 'Gloria
Patri, Filio, et Spiritui Sancto: sicut erat,' &c. The precious burden
was removed on the shoulders of the clergy to the cathedral, amid at
this moment our most skilful artificers are preparing a fitting monument
to be placed beside those of our other patron saints."

Our three voyagers shared but moderately in the general joy that
prevailed among all classes. They visited the cathedral along with
hundreds of the curious and devout, and were hospitably entertained by
the bishop and chapter. The people of Down would have gladly retained
the miraculous boat, but in a council held by the clergy and Brehons it
was resolved that it should be sent back to its owners in I. Colmkil. It
was not fitting that the loss sustained by the islanders should be
aggravated. These last, on the return of the exploratory expedition,
resigned themselves as well as they could to their loss, and went on
their noiseless and useful course. Concerning the abode of the saints in
Down, we quote the distich--

"Hi tres in uric, tumulo tumulantssr in Duno--  
Brigida, Patricius, atque Columba Pius."

"These three rest in one tomb in Down--  
Brigid, Patrick, and pious Columba."
