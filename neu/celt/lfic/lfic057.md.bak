# THE BATTLE OF VENTRY HARBOUR.

On one occasion, while their chief, Fion, and his friends, were enjoying
existence, swimming and fishing in the Sionan, word was brought to him
from the warder stationed at the harbour of *Finniraighe* (White Strand,
Ventry), that Daire Donn, King of Rome and all the world, except Erinn,
had been conducted by a recreant member of the Fianna to Glas Carraig
(Skellig Rocks), and was now with his mighty fleet lying in the harbour
mentioned, ready to land, and make his domain and the entire surface of
the earth one and the same.

Fleet runners now carried the news to the separate corps throughout the
island, including a remnant of the Danaan race settled at Conal Gavra,
in the present county of Limerick. The warriors nearest the post of
danger hastened thither, and for a year and a day there was a terrible
diurnal fight on the strand between a detachment landing from the ships
and an equal number of Fenian heroes, one great warrior generally
slaying a couple of hundred of the opposing party, and securing a
portion of the tale to himself, just as Agamemnon, or Diornede, or
Patroclus, had a book of the *Iliad* which he might call his own. It all
ended, as it should, in favour of native valour and patriotism, few of
the captains of the King of the World surviving the year and day's war.
The brave young Gall, Prince of Ulster, worked himself into such a state
of fury in the fight, that he lost his senses, and fled to the lonely
Glenn na-n-Gealt, in Kerry. And there all the lunatics in Ireland must
repair before or after they pay the great debt.

 

Spenser had a great dislike to the custom prevalent in his day, which
sent up in summer-time the inhabitants of the plains and valleys to the
hills, where they lived, in imitation of the *Fianna*, on game and the
produce of their cattle, till their instinct warned sheep and cows of
the suitable moment to seek the shelter of the lowlands. He complained
that this usage afforded the disaffected means of shelter and of support
among these dwellers in the "scraw-covered" shielings, and opportunities
of concocting designs unfriendly to the authority of his beloved
Gloriana.

It must be acknowledged that our information as to the institution of
the national militia is given by our romantic historians alone, who have
invested a real personage of military fame--Fion, son of' Cumhail--with
the title of their commander in the days of King Cairbre. This hero was
slain at the Boyne, A.D. 283, and the *Fianna* stood in such a defiant
attitude towards the monarch some twelve years later, that he assailed
them, with the assistance of the Connaught portion of the body, in the
memorable battle of *Gavra* (Garris-town, in Meath), where most of their
chiefs were slain, and an end put to the institution. This battle is
sung in a poem ascribed to Oisin, son of Fion, preserved in the Book of
Leinster, a manuscript of Finn M'Gorman, Bishop of Kildare, who died
1160.

The following quatrains are not 'from this version, but will give a good
idea of the style of the old heroic poetry, when divested of the
peculiar aids of alliteration, position, and rhyme. Oisin, who alone of
all the Fenian heroes survived the fight, remained in life in
Tir-na-n-Oge till the arrival of St. Patrick, to whom he related the
strife where he lost all his loved comrades, together with his son,
Oscur the Invincible, whom he mentions as treachously slain by King
Cairbre.

"My son urged his course  
Through the battalions of Tara,

Like a hawk through a flight of birds,  
Or a rock rushing down a steep.

\* \* \* \*

"As many as two score shields  
In each fierce onset,  
Mac Garraidh, the pure, and my own son,  
Broke in the fight of Gavra.

" Until the grass of the plain is numbered,  
And every grain of sand on the seashore,  
All who fell by my son  
Cannot be counted.  
  
"Many a mail of noble warriors--  
Many a fair head-piece  
And shields lay on the plain,  
With chiefs bereft of life.

\* \* \*

"I found my son lying down  
On his left side, by his shield,  
The sword clutched in his right hand,  
And the red blood pouring through his mail.

\* \* \* \*

"We raised the manly Oscur  
Aloft on the shafts of our spears,  
Bearing him to another pure mound,  
To remove his bloody harness.

\* \* \* \*

"We buried Oscur of the red weapons  
On the north side of Gabhra,  
With Oscur Mac Garraidh of great deeds,  
And Oscur, son of the King of Lochlann."

Of Fion, the man honourably mentioned in the Book of Leinster, and by
the Four Masters, there was never related more than that he was a
redoubted champion; but the poets and romancers seized on him, and his
Sons and grandson, and elevated them and their immediate friends into
heroes of surpassing might, round whom moved at a greater or less
distance other heroes--friends and foes--and all fertile in exploits and
adventures sufficient to fill libraries entire. And while the people,
generation after generation, took comparatively slight interest in the
deeds and renown of living chiefs, and soon forgot the notables of the
age just past, they carefully retained the exploits of heroes, some
altogether fabulous, and others of whom nothing was authentic but their
names and their existence in the third century. Fion and his heroes were
to the Irish romancers what Diedrich of Berne, Charlemagne, and King
Arthur, with their respective knights, were to the bards of Germany,
France, and Brittany.
