# ILLAN EACHTACH AND THE LIANAN.

Illan was a friend of Fion, and was willing to become more intimately
connected with him by marrying his aunt Tuirrean. It had come to Fion's
ears that Illan was already provided with a sighe-love, so he secured
the fate of his aunt in this wise. He put her hand into that of Oisin,
who intrusted her to Caoilté, who intrusted her to Mac Luacha, &c.; and
thus she passed under the guardianship of Diarmaid, Goll Mac Morna,
another Luacha, and so into the arms of Illan. Her married life was
happy for a while, but it did not please the Sighe, *Uchtdealbh* (Fair
Bosom) that her mortal lover should be happy in any society but her own.
So she paid her a visit in the absence of her husband, and invited her
out, as she wished to give her an important message from Fion, relative
to a feast he wanted to have prepared. Being safe from the eyes of the
household, she muttered some words, and drawing a druidic wand from
under her mantle, she struck her with it, and changed her into the most
beautiful wolf-hound that eyes ever beheld. She then took her to the
house of Feargus Fionnliath, on the shore of the bay of Galway. Illan,
hearing on his return that his wife had gone out with a strange woman,
and had not since been seen, guessed that Fair Bosom had disposed of her
in some way, and began to tremble for the result. It was not long
arriving. Fion missing his aunt, demanded her safe in life and limb at
the hands of Oisin, who demanded her from Caoiltd, who demanded her from
Mac Luacha, &c. till Luacha the second demanded from Illan the person of
his wife in good health, or his own head. Illan acknowledged the justice
of the request, and merely demanded a few days' grace.

He at once set forward to the palace-cavern of his sighe, and obtained
his wish, but on the pure condition of being faithful to her till his
death, and never more seeking mortal mistress or wife. She then sought
out Tuirrean, and bringing her to some distance from Fergus's rath,
restored her to her pristine shape, and then delivered her over to her
nephew. Luacha the second, the last of the sureties, represented to the
great chief, that the least recompense he could make him for the terror
he had experienced, was the hand of the restored beauty, and Fion gave
his gracious consent to this second espousals of his aunt.

During the lady's transformation she brought to the world the two
celebrated hounds .*Brann* and *Sceoluing*. Fair Bosom was willing to
give them the human shape when she restored it to their mother, but Fion
preferred them to remain as they were.

 

When Paganism prevailed, such connexions, were not looked on as very
baneful or unnatural. Under the Christian dispensation the unhappy
person is strictly bound to the unholy being, is always sensible of its
presence, and cannot be freed from the alliance without finding a
substitute to take his or her place. It is said that the Lianan is
nourished by the food received by its companion. Whatever were the
circumstances attending the beginning of the connexion, the wretched
mortal suffers at a later period such misery allied to horror, that he
or she would welcome death, were it not for the torments to be looked
for after it.

The person possessed can make the Lianan confer riches and other worldly
goods on friends or favourites, but is not in a position to receive or
enjoy such things in his or her own person. While the contract is not
broken on the mortal side the familiar is the slave, otherwise
unendurable misery and slavery is his or her portion. In the tale of
*Zanoni* and in the *Lianan Shie*, by Carleton, are obscurely figured
the indescribable wretchedness of the too rash and too curious mortals
who would tear asunder the veil that divides the visible from the
invisible world \[a\[

An ancient Ossianic story is the original on .which Carroll O'Daly or
Hugh Duff O'Reilly founded the tale of the "Son of Evil Counsel." Such
legends passed from the mouths of the professed bards and story-tellers
to those of a lower rank and less talent; and again descended from their
keeping to the care of uneducated peasants. We cite the last degraded
form of this old fiction, as told by a *scealuidhe* of the lowest rank.

\[a\] Classic scholars will find the memory of the Incubi, and Succubi,
and Nympholepts of the Pagan system, preserved in these Lianans and the
persons possessed by them.
