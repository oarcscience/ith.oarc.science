# LOUGH NEAGH.

This beautiful sheet of water issued from a spring well which only
waited an opportunity of being left uncovered, to send forth a mighty
flood. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood, aware of the danger, kept
it securely covered, till at last one luckless gossip walked off with
her pitcher, forgetting to replace the smooth round flag, and in
consequence the water burst forth in such a volume that the poor woman
was drowned before she reached home. Incredulous readers objecting to
this mode of lake-making, have only a choice between it and another
theory somewhat less probable. Fion Mac Cuil having routed a Scotch
giant with red hair, was pursuing him eastwards, but the canny Scotch
monster was rather more fleet of foot than his Irish rival, and as
outrunning him. Fion, fearing that he might reach the 'sea and swim
across to Britain before he could overtake him, stooped; and thrusting
his gigantic hands into the earth, tore up the rocks and clay, and
heaved them after the Albanach. As Fion miscalculated height and
distance, the mighty mass which had filled the whole bed of the present
lake, launched from his hands, flew past the

giant at a considerable height above his head, and did not lose its
impetus till it came over the mid sea. There dropping, according to the
laws of gravitation, it formed an island, afterwards called Man, from
its Danaan patron, Mananan, son of Lir.
