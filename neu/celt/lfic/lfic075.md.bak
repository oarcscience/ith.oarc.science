# KILLARNEY.

Killarney's fair lake was formed under the following romantic
circumstances--the historian omitting to state whether the inhabitants
that dwelt beneath the level of its present waves were good or bad, or
distinguished by an uncomfortable mixture of both qualities. A; knight
from foreign parts wooed the fair daughter of a man of the valley, rich
in corn-fields and cattle, and earnestly urged her to depart with him to
his rath in 'the north. He made no particular mention of the marriage
ceremony, so she, while taking no pains to conceal her love, gave him
decidedly to understand that, unless as his married wife, she would
never quit her native vale in his company. He had a short 'struggle
between his innate pride of chieftaincy and the deep love he bore to the
pure-minded maid. At last he came to her house as evening was closing
in, and gladdened the hearts of her parents by earnestly requesting the
hand of their fair daughter. On inquiring where she was at the moment,
he learned that she had gone to the fairy well for water, as was the
custom of the young women of the valley. Thither he hastened without
delay, and found two of her hand-maids just leaving the fountain with
their vessels balanced on their heads, and their forms gracefully
swaying under them as they proceeded home. Before she could express
displeasure or surprise, he told in abrupt and eager tones where he had
been, and what he had done, and in a moment she could think of nothing
but her new-found happiness. Her half-filled pitcher was forgotten, and
in the cool evening they walked about on the russet turf, between the
rocks and bushes; and in talking over their bliss, the time went by
unmarked. At last a sudden recollection of her neglect, and of the fatal
nature of the gifted spring, rushed on her mind. She shrieked aloud,
and, quitting her lover's arm, she rushed down the side of the hill. But
on looking towards the spring, she found a sheet of water surrounding
the little eminence, and a bubbling flood bursting upwards where the
still fluid was peacefully lying within its circular wall only a quarter
of an hour before. She would have awaited death where she stood, so much
was she overpowered with remorse for her fault, but such was not the
purpose of her knight. Lifting her on his shoulders, he dashed through
the channel nearest the neighbouring slope, and bore her still alive to
her home. The dismayed dwellers in the valley had time to gain the
heights before their dwellings were covered with the water; but the
young maiden was denounced. The legend leaves us in ignorance of the
after-fortunes of the lovers.

A once king of Cork and all his household are still living in
comfortable seclusion at the bottom of the Lough of Cork, which burst
out, as in the other instances, on account of the negligence of a
domestic.
