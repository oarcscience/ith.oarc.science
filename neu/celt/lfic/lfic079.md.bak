# THE BUILDING OF ARDFERT CATHEDRAL.

When St. Brendain, who went to search for the sunk isle of Hy-Breasil,
was about to build his Cathedral of Ardfert in the kingdom of Kerry, he
fixed on a spot where lay the remains of a deserted lios. This was a
favourite resort of the red-capped gentry, a circumstance unknown to the
saint. He cleared the foundation, and had made some progress in the
building, when he was thus interrupted. The projected building would
occupy a tolerably high rock, opposite to which stood another, and
between them lay a wooded valley. One fine sunny morning as the trowel
was making merry music on the stones, and the workmen were singing, a
large crow came from the rookery in the valley, deliberately took up the
measuring line in his bill, flew across the wood with it, and deposited
it on the other eminence. The saint accepted the omen, and raised the
sacred edifice on the spot pointed out by the fairy in disguise. We use
the word fairy advisedly. If the messenger had been from another
quarter, he would have made his appearance under snowy plumes.

The legend we are about to relate does not properly fall into the
present category; but if we waited for a suitable niche, we should have
probably to bring in St. Brendain again very unceremoniously, and here
we have him without doing violence to good manners or classification.
Our story-tellers sometimes represent the fairies,--either the original
stock, or the human beings who have assumed their nature,--as showing
good-will to mortals in distress. We would quote some instances of
O'Donoghue's beneficence; but are they not sufficiently trumpeted in
Killarney Guide-books? Such being the case, it would not be just or
natural that our national saints should neglect their poor countrymen.
But as our business in this section is not with legends of saints, but
of fairies, we would not cite the following piece of supernatural
interference were it not for its rather doubtful character:--
