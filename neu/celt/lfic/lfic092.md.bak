# HOW ST. PATRICK RECEIVED THE STAFF OF JESUS.

When our saint was returning from Rome to France in his way to Ireland
he stopped at a religious house in an isle in the Gulf of Genoa, and was
entertained for a night by the inmates, whose self-imposed duty was the
care of wrecked sailors. He revealed his name and mission, and observed
that about half the community were young and fresh-looking, and the rest
very aged and infirm. One of the younger brothers surprised him not a
little by mentioning that the very old members were their children. "It
is," said he, "about a century since I and my companions agreed to live
here in community, labour with our hands, and spend a certain time of
the day in reciting holy offices. We were all widowers, and children
remained to some of us. These are they (pointing to the aged men). One
night, it was our good fortune to entertain a stranger pilgrim of a
sweet and majestic countenance, and when he was about to quit us in the
morning he spoke these words, handing to our superior the staff which he
had in his hands:--' In requital for your loving hospitality, I leave
you this staff. During its stay with you years shall have no effect on
your strength nor appearance. Retain it till my servant Patrick rests
here on his way to Erinn for the conversion of its people, and give it
into his hands when he quits you.' We all listened with awe, and when
the last word was spoken the majestic form was no longer there. Our
children entered the community as they grew up, but, the blessing not
having been addressed to them, years have had their natural effect. When
you depart, bearing the sacred staff with you, we expect our release
from fleshly bonds." This or some other staff attended the saint in his
many weary journeys through the length and breadth of Erinn; and when he
died it was preserved in his cathedral at Armagh. At a later date it was
transferred to Christ-church Cathedral in Dublin. \[a\]

\[a\] These last two sentences have nothing of a legendary character
about them. Our Dublin authorities of the sixteenth century having no
opportunities of studying the works of Dr. Todd, Dr. Petrie, or either
of our late lamented Irish professors, were little imbued with an
archaeological spirit. They broke and burned the *Bacal Josa* on the
High Street, to testify their zeal against image worship.
