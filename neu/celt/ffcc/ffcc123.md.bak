### IV. IN THE ISLE OF MAN

Introduction by SOPHIA MORRISON, Hon. Secretary of the Manx Language
Society.

The Manx hierarchy of fairy beings people hills and glens, caves and
rivers, mounds and roads; and their name is legion. Apparently there is
not a place in the island but has its fairy legend. Sir Walter Scott
said that the 'Isle of Man, beyond all other places in Britain, was a
peculiar depository of the fairy-traditions, which, on the Island being
conquered by the Norse, became in all probability chequered with those
of Scandinavia, from a source peculiar and more direct than that by
which they reached Scotland and Ireland'.

A good Manxman however, does not speak of fairies--the word *ferish*, a
corruption of the English, did not exist in the island one hundred and
fifty years ago. He talks of 'The Little People' (*Mooinjer veggey*),
or, in a more familiar mood, of 'Themselves', and of 'Little Boys'
(*Guillyn veggey*), or 'Little Fellas'. In contradistinction to mortals
he calls them 'Middle World Men', for they are believed to dwell in a
world of their own, being neither good enough for Heaven nor bad enough
for Hell.

At the present moment almost all the older Manx peasants hold to this
belief in fairies quite firmly, but with a certain dread of them; and,
to my knowledge, two old ladies of the better class yet leave out cakes
and water for the fairies every night. The following story, illustrative
of the belief, was told to me by Bill Clarke:--

'Once while I was fishing from a ledge of rocks that runs out into the
sea at Lag-ny-Keilley a dense grey mist began to approach the land, and
I thought I had best make for home while the footpath above the rocks
was visible. When getting my things together I heard what sounded like a
lot of children coming out of school. I lifted my head, and behold ye,
there was a fleet of fairy boats each side of the rock. Their
riding-lights were shining like little stars, and I heard one of the
*Little Fellas* shout, "*Hraaghyn boght as* 

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

earish broigh, skeddan dy liooar ec yn mooinjer seilhll shoh, cha nel
veg ain" (Poor times and dirty weather, and herring enough at the people
of this world, nothing at us). Then they dropped off and went agate o'
the flitters.'

'Willy-the-Fairy,' as he is called, who lives at Rhenass, says he often
hears the fairies singing and playing up the Glen o' nights. I have
heard him sing airs which he said he had thus learned from the *Little
People*. <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)

Again, there is a belief that at Keeill Moirrey (Mary's Church), near
Glen Meay, a little old woman in a red cloak is sometimes seen coming
over the mountain towards the *keeill*, ringing a bell, just about the
hour when church service begins. Keeill Moirrey is one of the early
little Celtic cells, probably of the sixth century, of which nothing
remains but the foundations.

And the following prayer, surviving to our own epoch, is most
interesting. It shows, in fact, pure paganism; and we may judge from it
that the ancient Manx people regarded Manannan, the great Tuatha De
Danann god, in his true nature, as a spiritual being, a Lord of the Sea,
and as belonging to the complex fairy hierarchy. This prayer was given
to me by a Manxwoman nearly one hundred years old, who is still living.
She said it had been used by her grandfather, and that her father prayed
the same prayer--substituting St. Patrick's name for Manannan's:--

Manannan beg mac y Leirr, fer vannee yn Ellan,  
Bannee shin as nyn maatey, mie goll magh  
As cheet stiagh ny share lesh bio as marroo "sy vaatey".

(Little Manannan son of Leirr, who blest our Island,  
Bless us and our boat, well going out  
And better coming in with living and dead \[fish\] in the boat).

.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

It seems to me that no one of the various theories so far advanced
accounts in itself for the Fairy-Faith. There is

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

always a missing factor, an unknown quantity which has yet to be
discovered. No doubt the Pygmy Theory explains a good deal. In some
countries a tradition has been handed down of the times when there were
races of diminutive men in existence--beings so small that their tiny
hands could have used the flint arrow-heads and scrapers which are like
toys to us. No such tradition exists at the present day in the Isle of
Man, but one might have filtered down from the far-off ages and become
innate in the folk-memory, and now, unknown to the Manx peasant, may
possibly suggest to his mind the troops of *Little People* in the
shadowy glen or on the lonely mountain-side. Again, the rustling of the
leaves or the sough of the wind may be heard by the peasant as strange
and mysterious voices, or the trembling shadow of a bush may appear to
him as an unearthly being. Natural facts, explainable by modern science,
may easily remain dark mysteries to those who live quiet lives close to
Nature, far from sophisticated towns, and whose few years of schooling
have left the depths of their being undisturbed, only, as it were,
ruffling the shallows.

But this is not enough. Even let it be granted that nine out of every
ten cases of experiences with fairies can be analysed and explained
away--there remains the tenth. In this tenth case one is obliged to
admit that there is something at work which we do not understand, some
force in play which, as yet, we know not. In spite of ourselves we feel
'There's Powers that's in'. These Powers are not necessarily what the
superstitious call 'supernatural'. We realize now that there is nothing
supernatural--that what used to be so called is simply something that we
do not understand at present. Our forefathers would have thought the
telephone, the X-rays, and wireless telegraphy things 'supernatural'. It
is more than possible that our descendants may make discoveries equally
marvellous in the realms both of mind and matter, and that many things,
which nowadays seem to the materialistically-minded the creations of
credulous fancy, may in the future be understood and recognized as part
of the one great scheme of things.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

Some persons are certainly more susceptible than others to these unknown
forces. Most people know reliable instances of telepathy and
presentiment amongst their acquaintances. It seems not at all contrary
to reason that both matter and mind, in knowledge of which we have not
gone so very far after all, may exist in forms as yet entirely unknown
to us. After all, beings with bodies and personalities different from
our own may well inhabit the unseen world around us: the Fairy Hound,
white as driven snow, may show himself at times among his mundane
companions; *Fenodyree* may do the farm-work for those whom he favours;
the *Little People* may sing and dance o' nights in Colby Glen. Let us
not say it is 'impossible'.

PEEL, ISLE OF MAN,  
*September* 1910.

### ON THE SLOPES OF SOUTH BARRULE

I was introduced to the ways and nature of Manx fairies in what is
probably the most fairy-haunted part of the isle--the southern slopes of
South Barrule, the mountain on whose summit Manannan is said to have had
his stronghold, and whence he worked his magic, hiding the kingdom in
dense fog whenever he beheld in the distance the coming of an enemy's
ship or fleet. And from a representative of the older generation, Mrs.
Samuel Leece, who lives at Ballamodda, a pleasant village under the
shadow of South Barrule, I heard the first story:--

Baby and Table Moved by Fairies.--'I have been told of *their* (the
fairies') taking babies, though I can't be sure it is true. But this did
happen to my own mother in this parish of Kirk Patrick about eighty
years since: She was in bed with her baby, but wide awake, when she felt
the baby pulled off her arm and heard the rush of *them*. Then she
mentioned the Almighty's name, and, as *they* were hurrying away, a
little table alongside the bed went round about the floor twenty times.
Nobody was in the room with my mother, and she always allowed it was the
*little fellows*.'

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

### MANX TALES IN A SNOW-BOUND FARM-HOUSE

When our interesting conversation was over, Mrs. Leece directed me to
her son's farm-house, where her husband, Mr. Samuel Leece, then happened
to be; and going there through the snow-drifts, I found him with his son
and the family within. The day was just the right sort to stir Manx
memories, and it was not long before the best of stories about the
'little people' were being told in the most natural way, and to the
great delight of the children. The grandfather, who is eighty-six years
of age, sat by the open fire smoking; and he prepared the way for the
stories (three of which we record) by telling about a ghost seen by
himself and his father, and by the announcement that 'the fairies are
thought to be spirits'.

Under 'Fairy' Control.--'About fifty years ago,' said Mr. T. Leece, the
son, 'Paul Taggart, my wife's uncle, a tailor by trade, had for an
apprentice, Humphrey Keggan, a young man eighteen or nineteen years of
age; and it often happened that while the two of them would be returning
home at nightfall, the apprentice would suddenly disappear from the side
of the tailor, and even in the midst of a conversation, as soon as they
had crossed .the burn in the field down there (indicating an adjoining
field). And Taggart could not see nor hear Humphrey go. The next morning
Humphrey would come back, but so worn out that he could not work, and he
always declared that *little men* had come to him in crowds, and used
him as a horse, and that with them he had travelled all night across
fields and over hedges.' The wife of the narrator substantiated this
strange psychological story by adding:--'This is true, because I know my
Uncle Paul too well to doubt what he says.' And she then related the two
following stories:--

Heifer Killed by Fairy Woman's Touch.--'Aunt Jane was coming down the
road on the other side of South Barrule when she saw a strange woman'
(who Mr. T. Leece suggested was a witch) 'appear in the middle of the
gorse and walk right over the gorse and heather in a place where

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

no person could walk. Then she observed the woman go up to a heifer and
put her hand on it; and within a few days that heifer was dead.'

The Fairy Dog.--'This used to happen about one hundred years ago, as my
mother has told me:--Where my grandfather John Watterson was reared,
just over near Kerroo Kiel (Narrow Quarter), all the family were
sometimes sitting in the house of a cold winter night, and my great
grandmother and her daughters at their wheels spinning, when a little
white dog would suddenly appear in the room. Then every one there would
have to drop their work and prepare for *the company* to come in: they
would put down a fire and leave fresh water for *them*, and hurry off
upstairs to bed. They could hear *them* come, but could never see them,
only the dog. The dog was a fairy dog, and a sure sign of their coming.'

### TESTIMONY OF A HERB-DOCTOR AND SEER

At Ballasalla I was fortunate enough to meet one of the most interesting
of its older inhabitants, John Davies, a Celtic medicine-man, who can
cure most obstinate maladies in men or animals with secret herbs, and
who knows very much about witchcraft and the charms against it. 'Witches
are as common as ducks walking barefooted,' he said, using the duck
simile, which is a popular Manx one; and he cited two particular
instances from his own experience. But for us it is more important to
know that John Davies is also an able seer. The son of a weaver, he was
born in County Down, Ireland, seventy-eight years ago; but in earliest
boyhood he came with his people to the Isle of Man, and grew up in the
country near Ramsay, and so thoroughly has he identified himself with
the island and its lore, and even with its ancient language, that for
our purposes be may well be considered a Manxman. His testimony about
Manx fairies is as follows:--

Actual Fairies Described.--'I am only a poor ignorant man; when I was
married I couldn't say the word "matrimony" in the right way. But one
does not have to be educated to see fairies, and I have seen them many a
time.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have seen them
with the naked eye as numerous as I have seen scholars coming out of
Ballasalla school; and I have been seeing them since I was eighteen to
twenty years of age. The last one I saw was in Kirk Michael. Before
education came into the island more people could see the fairies; now
very few people can see them. But *they* (the fairies) are as thick on
the Isle of Man as ever *they* were. *They* throng the air, and darken
Heaven, and rule this lower world. It is only twenty-one miles from this
world up to the first heaven. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) There
are as many kinds of fairies as populations in our world. I have seen
some who were about two and a half feet high; and some who were as big
as we are. I think very many such fairies as these last are the lost
souls of the people who died before the Flood. At the Flood all the
world was drowned; but the Spirit which God breathed into Adam will
never be drowned, or burned, and it is as much in the sea as on the
land. Others of the fairies are evil spirits: our Saviour drove a legion
of devils into a herd of swine; the swine were choked, but not the
devils. You can't drown devils; it is spirits they are, and just like a
shadow on the wall.' I here asked about the personal aspects of most
fairies of human size, and my friend said:--'*They* appear to me in the
same dress as in the days when they lived here on earth; the spirit
itself is only what God blew into Adam as the breath of life.'

It seems to me that, on the whole, John Davies has had genuine visions,
but that whatever he may have seen has been very much coloured in
interpretation by his devout knowledge of the Christian Bible, and by
his social environment, as is self-evident.

### TESTIMONY OF A BALLASALLA MANXWOMAN

A well-informed Manxwoman, of Ballasalla, who lives in the ancient stone
house wherein she was born, and in which before her lived her
grandparents, offers this testimony:--

Concerning Fairies.--'I've heard a good deal of talk

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

about fairies, but never believed in them myself; the old people thought
them the ghosts of the dead or some such things. They were like people
who had gone before (that is, dead). If there came a strange sudden
knock or noises, or if a tree took a sudden shaking when there was no
wind, people used to make out it was caused by the fairies. On the 11th
of May <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) we used to gather
mountain-ash (*Cuirn*) with red berries on it, and make crosses out of
its sprigs, and put them over the doors, so that the fairies would not
come in. My father always saw that this was done; he said we could have
no luck during the year if we forgot to do it.'

### TESTIMONY GIVEN IN A JOINER'S SHOP

George Gelling, of Ballasalla, a joiner, has a local reputation for
knowing much about the fairies, and so I called on him at his workshop.
This is what he told me:--

Seeing the Fairies.--'I was making a coffin here in the shop, and, after
tea, my apprentice was late returning; he was out by the hedge just over
there looking at a crowd of *little people* kicking and dancing. One of
them came up and asked him what he was looking at; and this made him run
back to the shop. When he described what he had seen, I told him they
were nothing but fairies.'

Hearing Fairy Music.--'Up by the abbey on two different occasions I have
heard the fairies. They were playing tunes not of this world, and on
each occasion I listened for nearly an hour.'

Mickleby and the Fairy Woman.--'A man named Mickleby was coming from
Derbyhaven at night, when by a certain

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

stream he met two ladies. He saluted them, and then walked along with
them to Ballahick Farm. There he saw a house lit up, and they took him
into it to a dance. As he danced, he happened to wipe away his sweat
with a part of the dress of one of the two strange women who was his
partner. After this adventure, whenever Mickleby was lying abed at
night, the woman with whom he danced would appear standing beside his
bed. And the only way to drive her away was to throw over her head and
Mickleby a linen sheet which had never been bleached.'

Nature of Fairies.--'The fairies are spirits. I think they are in this
country yet: A man below here forgot his cow, and at a late hour went to
look for her, and saw that crowds of fairies like little boys were with
him. \[St.\] Paul said that spirits are thick in the air, if only we
could see them; and we call spirits fairies. I think the old people here
in the island thought of fairies in the same way.'

The Fairies' Revenge.--William Oates now happened to come into the
workshop, and being as much interested in the subject under discussion
as ourselves, offered various stories, of which the following is a
type:--'A man named Watterson, who used often to see the fairies in his
house at Colby playing in the moonlight, on one occasion heard them
coming just as he was going to bed. So he went out to the spring to get
fresh water for them; and coming into the house put the can down on the
floor, saying, "Now, little beggars, drink away." And at that (an insult
to the fairies) the water was suddenly thrown upon him.'

### A VICAR'S TESTIMONY

When I called on the Rev. J. M. Spicer, vicar of Malew parish, at his
home near Castletown, he told me this very curious story:--

The Taking of Mrs. K-----.--'The belief in fairies is quite a living
thing here yet. For example, old Mrs. K-----, about a year ago, told me
that on one occasion, when her daughter had been in Castletown during
the day, she went out to the road at nightfall to see if her daughter
was yet

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

in sight, whereupon a whole crowd of fairies suddenly surrounded her,
and began taking her off toward South Barrule Mountain; and, she added,
"I couldn't get away from *them* until I had called my son."'

### A CANON'S TESTIMONY

I am greatly indebted to the Rev. Canon Kewley, of Arbory, for the
valuable testimony which follows, and especially for his kindness in
allowing me to record what is one of the clearest examples of a
collective hallucination I have heard about as occurring in the
fairy-haunted regions of Celtic countries:--

A Collective Hallucination.--'A good many things can be explained as
natural phenomena, but there are some things which I think cannot be.
For example, my sister and myself and our coachman, and apparently the
horse, saw the same phenomenon at the same moment: one evening we were
driving along an avenue in this parish when the avenue seemed to be
blocked by a great crowd of people, like a funeral procession; and the
crowd was so dense that we could not see through it. The throng was
about thirty to forty yards away. When we approached, it melted away,
and no person was anywhere in sight.'

The Manx Fairy-Faith.--'Among the old people of this parish there is
still a belief in fairies. About eighteen years ago, I buried a man, a
staunch Methodist, who said he once saw the road full of fairies in the
form of little black pigs, and that when he addressed them, "In the name
of God what are ye?" they immediately vanished. He was certain they were
the fairies. Other old people speak of the fairies as the *little folk*.
The tradition is that the fairies once inhabited this island, but were
banished for evil-doing. The elder-tree, in Manx *tramman*, is supposed
to be inhabited by fairies. Through accident, one night a woman ran into
such a tree, and was immediately stricken with a terrible swelling which
her neighbours declared came from disturbing the fairies in the tree.
This was on the borders of Arbory parish.'

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

The Canon favours the hypothesis that in much of the folk-belief
concerning fairies and Fairyland there is present an instinct, as seen
among all peoples, for communion with the other world, and that this
instinct shows itself in another form in the Christian doctrine of the
Communion of Saints.

### FAIRY TALES ON CHRISTMAS DAY

The next morning, Christmas morning, I called at the picturesque
roadside home of Mrs. Dinah Moore a Manxwoman living near Glen Meay; and
she contributed the best single collection of Manx folk-legends I
discovered on the island. The day was bright and frosty, and much snow
still remained in the shaded nooks and hollows, so that a seat before
the cheerful fire in Mrs. Moore's cottage was very comfortable; and with
most work suspended for the ancient day of festivities in honour of the
Sun, re-born after its death at the hands of the Powers of Darkness, all
conditions were favourable for hearing about fairies, and this may
explain why such important results were obtained.

Fairy Deceit.--'I heard of a man and wife who had no children. One night
the man was out on horseback and heard a little baby crying beside the
road. He got off his horse to get the baby, and, taking it home, went to
give it to his wife, and it was only a block of wood. And then the old
fairies were outside yelling at the man: "*Eash un oie, s'cheap t'ou
mollit!*" (Age one night, how easily thou art deceived!).'

A Midwife's Strange Experience.--'A strange man took a nurse to a place
where a baby boy was born. After the birth, the man set out on a table
two cakes, one of them broken and the other one whole, and said to the
nurse: "Eat, eat; but don't eat of the cake which is broken nor of the
cake which is whole." And the nurse said: "What in the name of the Lord
am I going to eat?" At that all the fairies in the house disappeared;
and the nurse was left out on a mountain-side alone.'

A Fairy-Baking.--'At night the fairies came into a house in Glen Rushen
to bake. The family had put no water out

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

for them; and a beggar-man who had been left lodging on the sofa
downstairs heard the fairies say, "We have no water, so we'll take blood
out of the toe of the servant who forgot our water." And from the girl's
blood they mixed their dough. Then they baked their cakes, ate most of
them, and poked pieces up under the thatched roof. The next day the
servant-girl fell ill, and was ill until the old beggar-man returned to
the house and cured her with a bit of the cake which he took from under
the thatch.'

A Changeling Musician.--'A family at Dalby had a poor idiot baby, and
when it was twenty years old it still sat by the fire just like a child.
A tailor came to the house to work on a day when all the folks were out
cutting corn, and the idiot was left with him. The tailor began to
whistle as he sat on the table sewing, and the little idiot sitting by
the fire said to him: "If you'll not tell anybody when they come in,
I'll dance that tune for you." So the little fellow began to dance, and
he could step it out splendidly. Then he said to the tailor: "If you'll
not tell anybody when they come in, I'll play the fiddle for you." And
the tailor and the idiot spent a very enjoyable afternoon together. But
before the family came in from the fields, the poor idiot, as usual, was
sitting in a chair by the fire, a big baby who couldn't hardly talk.
When the mother came in she happened to say to the tailor, "You've a
fine chap here," referring to the idiot. "Yes, indeed," said the tailor,
"we've had a very fine afternoon together; but I think we had better
make a good fire and put him on it." "Oh!" cried the mother, "the poor
child could never even walk." "Ah, but he can dance and play the fiddle,
too," replied the tailor. And the fire was made; but when the idiot saw
that they were for putting him on it he pulled from his pocket a ball,
and this ball went rolling on ahead of him, and he, going after it, was
never seen again.' After this strange story was finished I asked Mrs.
Moore where she had heard it, and she said:--'I have heard this story
ever since I was a girl. I knew the house and family, and so did my
mother. The family's name was Cubbon.'

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

The Fenodyree's (or 'Phynnodderee's') Disgust.--'During snowy weather,
like this, the Fenodyree would gather in the sheep at night; and during
the harvest season would do the threshing when all the family were abed.
One time, however, just over here at Gordon Farm, the farmer saw him,
and he was naked; and so the farmer put out a new suit of clothes for
him. The Fenodyree came at night, and looking at the clothes with great
disgust at the idea of wearing such things, said:--

Bayrn da'n chione, doogh da'n chione,  
Cooat da'n dreeym, doogh da'n dreeym,  
Breechyn da'n toin, doogh da'n toin,  
Agh my she lhiat Gordon mooar,  
Cha nee lhiat Glion reagh Rushen.

(Cap for the head, alas! poor head,  
Coat for the back, alas! poor back,  
Breeches for the breech, alas! poor breech,  
But if big Gordon \[farm\] is thine,  
Thine is not the merry Glen of Rushen.) <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_43.md)

And off he went to Glen Rushen for good.'

### TESTIMONY PROM THE KEEPER OP PEEL CASTLE

From Mrs. Moore's house I walked on to Peel, where I was fortunate in
meeting, in his own home, Mr. William Cashen, the well-known keeper of
the famous old Peel Castle, within whose yet solid battlements stands
the one true round tower outside of Ireland. I heard first of all about
the fairy dog--the *Moddey Doo* (Manx for Black Dog)--which haunts the
castle; and then Mr. Cashen related to me the following anecdotes and
tales about Manx fairies:--

Prayer against the Fairies.--'My father's and grandfather's idea was
that the fairies tumbled out of the battlements of Heaven, falling
earthward for three days and three nights as thick as hail; and that one
third of them fell into

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

the sea, one third on the land, and one third remained in the air, in
which places they will remain till the Day of Judgement. The old Manx
people always believed that this fall of the fairies was due to the
first sin, pride; and here is their prayer against the fairies:--"*Jee
saue mee voish cloan ny moyrn*" (God preserve me from the children of
pride \[or ambition\]).'

A Man's Two Wives.--'A Ballaleece woman was captured by the fairies;
and, soon afterwards, her husband took a new wife, thinking the first
one gone for ever. But not long after the marriage, one night the first
wife appeared to her former husband and said to him, and the second wife
overheard her: "You'll sweep the barn clean, and mind there is not one
straw left on the floor. Then stand by the door, and at a certain hour a
company of people on horseback will ride in, and you lay hold of that
bridle of the horse I am on, and don't let it go." He followed the
directions carefully, but was unable to hold the horse: the second wife
had put some straw on the barn floor under a bushel.'

Sounds of Infinity.--'On Dalby Mountain, this side of Cronk-yn-Irree-Laa
the old Manx people used to put their ears to the earth to hear the
Sounds of Infinity (*Sheean-ny-Feaynid*), which were sounds like
murmurs. They thought these sounds came from beings in space; for in
their belief all space is filled with invisible beings.' <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_44.md)

### TO THE MEMORY OF A MANX SCHOLAR

Since the following testimony was written down, its author, the late Mr.
John Nelson, of Ramsey, has passed out of our realm of life into the
realm invisible. He was one of the few Manxmen who knew the Manx
language really well, and the ancient traditions which it has preserved

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

both orally and in books. In his kindly manner and with fervent loyalty
toward all things Celtic, he gave me leave, during December 1909, to
publish for the first time the interesting matter which follows; and,
with reverence, we here place it on record to his memory:--

A Blinding by Fairies.--'My grandfather, William Nelson, was coming home
from the herring fishing late at night, on the road near Jurby, when he
saw in a pea-field, across a hedge, a great crowd of *little fellows* in
red coats dancing and making music. And as he looked, an old woman from
among them came up to him and spat in his eyes, saying: "You'll never
see us again"; and I am told that he was blind afterwards till the day
of his death. He was certainly blind for fourteen years before his
death, for I often had to lead him around; but, of course, I am unable
to say of my own knowledge that he became blind immediately after his
strange experience, or if not until later in life; but as a young man he
certainly had good sight, and it was believed that the fairies destroyed
it.'

The Fairy Tune.--'William Cain, of Glen Helen (formerly Rhenass), was
going home in the evening across the mountains near Brook's Park, when
he heard music down below in a glen, and saw there a great glass house
like a palace, all lit up. He stopped to listen, and when he had the new
tune he went home to practise it on his fiddle; and recently he played
the same fairy tune at Miss Sophia Morrison's Manx entertainment in
Peel.'

Manannan the Magician.--Mr. Nelson told a story about a *Buggane* or
*Fenodyree*, such as we already have, and explained the *Glashtin* as a
water-bull, supposed to be a goblin half cow and half horse, and then
offered this tradition about Manannan:--' It is said that Manannan was a
great magician, and that he used to place on the sea pea-shells, held
open with sticks and with sticks for masts standing up in them, and then
so magnify them that enemies beheld them as a strong fleet, and would
not approach the island. Another tradition is that Manannan on his three
legs (the Manx coat of arms) could travel from one end to

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

the other of his isle with wonderful swiftness, moving like a
wheel.' <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_45.md)

### TESTIMONY OF A FARMER AND FISHERMAN

From the north of the island I returned to Peel, where I had arranged to
meet new witnesses, and the first one of these is James Caugherty, a
farmer and fisherman, born in Kirk Patrick fifty-eight years ago, who
testified (in part) as follows:--

Churn Worked by Fairies.--'Close by Glen Cam (Winding Glen), when I was
a boy, our family often used to hear the empty churn working in the
churn-house, when no person was near it, and they would say, "Oh, it 's
the *little fellows*."'

A Remarkable Changeling Story.--'Forty to fifty years ago, between St.
John's and Foxdale, a boy, with whom I often played, came to our house
at nightfall to borrow some candles, and while he was on his way home
across the hills he suddenly saw a little boy and a little woman coming
after him. If he ran, they ran, and all the time they gained on him.
Upon reaching home he was speechless, his hands were altered (turned
awry), and his feet also, and his fingernails had grown long in a
minute. He remained that way a week. My father went to the boy's mother
and told her it wasn't Robby at all that she saw; and when my father was
for taking the tongs and burning the boy with a piece of glowing turf
\[as a changeling test\], the boy screamed awfully. Then my father
persuaded the mother to send a messenger to a doctor in the north near
Ramsey "doing charms", to see if she couldn't get Robby back. As the
messenger was returning, the mother stepped out of the house to relieve
him, and when she went into the house again her own Robby was there. As
soon as Robby came to himself all right, he said a little woman and a
little boy had followed him, and that

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

just as he got home he was conscious of being taken away by them, but he
didn't know where they came from nor where they took him. He was unable
to tell more than this. Robby is alive yet, so far as I know; he is
Robert Christian, of Douglas.'

### EVIDENCE FROM A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF KEYS

Mr. T. C. Kermode, of Peel, member of the House of Keys, the Lower House
of the Manx Parliament, very kindly dictated for my use the following
statement concerning fairies which he himself has seen:--

Reality of Fairies.--'There is much belief here in the island that there
actually are fairies; and I consider such belief based on an actual fact
in nature, because of my own strange experience. About forty years ago,
one October night, I and another young man were going to a kind of Manx
harvest-home at Cronk-a-Voddy. On the Glen Helen road, just at the Beary
Farm, as we walked along talking, my friend happened to look across the
river (a small brook), and said: "Oh look, there are the fairies. Did
you ever see them?" I looked across the river and saw a circle of
supernatural light, which I have now come to regard as the "astral
light" or the light of Nature, as it is called by mystics, and in which
spirits become visible. The spot where the light appeared was a fiat
space surrounded on the sides away from the river by banks formed by low
hills; and into this space and the circle of light, from the surrounding
sides apparently, I saw come in twos and threes a great crowd of little
beings smaller than Tom Thumb and his wife. All of them, who appeared
like soldiers, were dressed in red. They moved back and forth amid the
circle of light, as they formed into order like troops drilling. I
advised getting nearer to them, but my friend said, "No, I'm going to
the party." Then after we had looked at them a few minutes my friend
struck the roadside wall with a stick and shouted, and we lost the
vision and the light vanished.'

The Manx Fairy-Faith.--'I have much evidence from old Manx people, who
are entirely reliable and God-fearing, that

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

they have seen the fairies hunting with hounds and horses, and on the
sea in ships, and under other conditions, and that they have heard their
music. They consider the fairies a complete nation or world in
themselves, distinct from our world, but having habits and instincts
like ours. Social organization among them is said to be similar to that
among men, and they have their soldiers and commanders. Where the
fairies actually exist the old people cannot tell, but they certainly
believe that they can be seen here on earth.'

### TESTIMONY PROM A PAST PROVINCIAL GRAND MASTER

Mr. J. H. Kelly, Past Provincial Grand Master of the Isle of Man
District of Oddfellows, a resident of Douglas, offers the following
account of a curious psychical experience of his own, and attributes it
to fairies:--

A Strange Experience with Fairies.--'Twelve to thirteen years ago, on a
clear moonlight night, about twelve o'clock, I left Laxey; and when
about five miles from Douglas, at Ballagawne School, I heard talking,
and was suddenly conscious of being in the midst of an invisible throng.
As this strange feeling came over me, I saw coming up the road four
figures as real to look upon as human beings, and of medium size, though
I am certain they were not human. When these four, who seemed to be
connected with the invisible throng, came out of the Garwick road into
the main road, I passed into a by-road leading down to a very peaceful
glen called Garwick Glen; and I still had the same feeling that
invisible beings were with me, and this continued for a mile. There was
no fear or emotion or excitement, but perfect calm on my part. I
followed the by-road; and when I began to mount a hill there was a
sudden and strange quietness, and a sense of isolation came over me, as
though the joy and peace of my life had departed with the invisible
throng. From different personal experiences like this one, I am firmly
of the opinion and belief that the fairies exist. One cannot say that
they are wholly physical or wholly spiritual, but the impression left
upon my mind

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

is that they are an absolutely real order of beings not human.'

Invoking Little Manannan, son of Leirr, to give us safe passage across
his watery domain, we now go southward to the nearest Brythonic country,
the Land of Arthur, WALES.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_40"></span>[118:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_41.md) '"Willy-the-Fairy,"
otherwise known as William Cain, is the musician referred to by the late
Mr. John Nelson ([p. 131](#page_131).md). The latter's statement that
William Cain played one of these fairy tunes at one of our Manx
entertainments in Peel is perfectly correct.'--SOPHIA MORRISON.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[123:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_42.md) This is the Mid-world
of Irish seers, who would be inclined to follow the Manx custom and call
the fairies 'the People of the Middle World'.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[124:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_43.md) 'May 11 = in Manx
*Oie Voaldyn*, "May-day Eve." On this evening the fairies were supposed
to be peculiarly active. To propitiate them and to ward off the
influence of evil spirits, and witches, who were also active at this
time, green leaves or boughs and *sumark* or primrose flowers were
strewn on the threshold, and branches of the *cuirn* or mountain ash
made into small crosses without the aid of a knife, which was on no
account to be used (steel or iron in any form being taboo to fairies and
spirits), and stuck over the doors of the dwelling-houses and
cow-houses. Cows were further protected from the same influences by
having the *Bollan-feaill-Eoin* (John's feast wort) placed in their
stalls. This was also one of the occasions on which no one would give
fire away, and on which fires were and are still lit on the hills to
drive away the fairies.'--SOPHIA MORRISON.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[129:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_44.md) I am wholly indebted
to Miss Morrison for these Manx verses and their translation, which I
have substituted for Mrs. Moore's English rendering. Miss Morrison,
after my return to Oxford, saw Mrs. Moore and took them down from her, a
task I was not well fitted to do when the tale was told.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[130:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_45.md) It has been
suggested, and no doubt correctly, that these murmuring sounds heard on
Dalby Mountain are due to the action of sea-waves, close at hand,
washing over shifting masses of pebbles on the rock-bound shore. Though
this be the true explanation of the phenomenon itself, it only proves
the attribution of cause to be wrong, and not the underlying animistic
conception of spiritual beings.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[132:1](ffcc123.htm#fr_46.md) In this mythological
role, Manannan is apparently a sun god or else the sun itself; and the
Manx coat of arms, which is connected with him, being a sun symbol,
suggests to us now ages long prior to history, when the Isle of Man was
a Sacred Isle dedicated to the cult of the Supreme God of Light and
Life, and when all who dwelt thereon were regarded as the Children of
the Sun.
