## MODERN SCIENCE AND THE FAIRY-FAITH; AND CONCLUSIONS

## CHAPTER XII

### THE CELTIC DOCTRINE OF RE-BIRTH AND OTHERWORLD SCIENTIFICALLY EXAMINED

'If all things which partook of life were to die, and after they were
dead remained in the form of death, and did not come to life again, all
would at last die, and nothing would be alive--what other result could
there be?'--SOCRATES, as reported by Plato.

'The soul, if immortal, existed before our birth. What is incorruptible
must be ungenerable.'--HUME.

'If there be no reasons to suppose that we have existed before that
period at which our existence apparently commences, then there are no
grounds for supposing that we shall continue to exist after our
existence has apparently ceased.' --SHELLEY.

The extension of the terms Fairy and Fairyland--The real man as an
invisible force acting through a body-conductor--A psychical organ
essential for memory--Pre-existence a scientific necessity--The
vitalistic view of evolution--Old theory of heredity
disproved--Embryology supports re-birth doctrine--Psycho-physical
evolution--Memory of previous existences in
subconsciousness--Examples--Dream psychology furnishes clearest
illustrations--No post-existence without pre-existence--Resurrection as
re-birth--The Circle of Life--The mystical corollary--Conclusion: the
Celtic Doctrine of Re-birth and Otherworld is essentially scientific.

IN the esoteric Fairy-Faith, the terms Fairy and Fairyland attain their
broadest meaning. To the Celtic mystic, the universe is divisible into
two interpenetrating parts or aspects: the visible in which we are now,
and the invisible which is Fairyland or the Otherworld; and a fairy is
an intelligent being, either embodied as a member of the human race or
else resident in the Otherworld. The latter class includes many distinct
hierarchies and lower orders. Some, like the highest of the Tuatha De
Danann, who are the same in character as the gods of the Greeks and
Hindoos, are super-human;

<span id="page_493">p. 493</span>

others are the souls of the dead; while many are subhuman and have never
been embodied in gross physical bodies. These last include daemons
(incorrectly regarded by Christian and other theologies as being in all
cases evil, and called demons); and other like spirits, such as those
which Dr. Tylor, in *Primitive Culture*, has designated nature spirits
(leprechauns, 'pixies, knockers, *corrigans*, *lutins*, *little folk*,
elves generally, and their counterparts in all non-Celtic Fairy-Faiths),
which are the elementals of mediaeval mystics.

In the preceding chapter chiefly the lower species of fairies were under
consideration, but now the higher orders (including human souls embodied
and disembodied), in their relation toward one another, are to be
considered independently. It becomes necessary, then, to present here a
view of life and death not yet scientifically orthodox.

The Celt in all ages of his long history, like the ancient Greek
thinkers with whom his ancestors were contemporary, has always been
inclined, unlike modern scientists, to seek an explanation for the
phenomena of evolutionary life by postulating a noumenal world of causes
as the background of the phenomenal world of effects. To-day, the rapid
march of scientific pioneers, chiefly those in psychical research, is
bringing our own cold and exact science very close to that indefinable
boundary which separates the two worlds; and for that reason alone a
presentation of the Celtic theory of the causes operating to produce
death and birth will be, at least by way of suggestion, of some value.

Facts of common everyday knowledge are apt to lose their significance
through too great familiarity. A fact of this character is that when
each child is born it must awaken into life. Often it is not known
whether the newly-born babe is dead or alive until it stretches forth
its arms and breathes or cries. And this phenomenon of our first
awakening and entry upon the visible plane of life and conscious action
seems to corroborate what the early Celt who thoughtfully observed it
held to be true, and what the Celt of to-day holds to be true: that the
material substance composing the body of man is merely a means of
expression for life, a conductor for

<span id="page_494">p. 494</span>

an unknown force which exhibits volition and individual consciousness;
just as material substance in a condition called inanimate is a
conductor for another unknown force called electricity, which does not
exhibit any volition or consciousness. Destroy the human body, and there
is no manifestation of its life force; destroy a wire, and there is no
manifestation of electric light: the human body seems to be merely
incidental in the history of the individual consciousness, as a wire is
incidental to electric light.

But is this consciousness of man which we call life simply a phenomenon
of matter non-existent without a physical means of expression, or does
it--like electricity after the wire is destroyed--continue to exist in
an unmanifested state when the human body is cold and motionless in
death? And in the case of a child born dead has this consciousness found
some organic imperfection in the newly-constructed infant body which
made its manifestation impossible? A few thoughts to aid in answering
these questions will probably suggest themselves if we briefly consider
the great difference between a human body in life and a human body in
death. In life, there is the highly organized, delicately adjusted,
perfectly balanced human body responding to the will of an invisible
power; and it is admitted by all schools of philosophers, moralists, and
scientists that this invisible power--whatever it may be--is the real
man.

This invisible power, beginning its manifestation through a microscopic
bit of germ-plasm, gradually builds for itself a more and more complex
physical habitation, until, after the short space of nine months, it
claims membership among the ranks of men. During the many years of its
sojourn on our planet, it renews its habitation many times. Every atom
it began with in childhood is discarded and replaced by a new one long
before the age of manhood is reached, and yet upon reaching manhood the
invisible power remembers what it did in a child's frame. This indicates
that memory or consciousness as a psychical process does not depend
essentially upon a material brain nor upon a certain grouping of
ever-changing brain-substance; for if it did, apparently it would slowly

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

and imperceptibly undergo change as completely as the whole physical
body and brains This physiological process furnishes sufficient data to
allow us to postulate that there is a psychical organ of memory behind
the physical sense-consciousness, and that such an organ in itself is,
at least during a human-life period, unchanging in its composition.
Without such an organ, the process of memory when more fully analysed
(in a way we cannot here attempt) is inexplicable. <span
id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_608.md)

The simplest hypothesis is to conceive that organ as the one connected
with the subconsciousness or super-sense-consciousness, by means of
which the invisible power or rememberer is able to remember and to
impress its memory upon the temporary and continually unstable physical
brain. In the process of memory there must be first of all a thing to be
remembered; second, a record of that thing to be remembered; and third,
something to remember that thing. The thing remembered is the result of
a conscious experience, the record of it the result of its impress at
the time it was experienced, but the rememberer is neither.

That invisible power, which we have called the real mans animates the
body, it places food in it as fuel to produce animal heat, animal
vitality and force, and tries to keep it in good working order as long
as possible. If the body is imperfect at birth or becomes so later, that
invisible power is forced to act through it imperfectly; if the brain is
diseased, there is insanity, if undeveloped, idiocy; and when the body
ceases to respond either perfectly or imperfectly, the invisible power
must surrender it entirely, and there is what we call death.

Now what is this invisible power or force which has entirely vanished,
leaving the physical body and brain cold and motionless? Let us see if
there is an answer. Chemical analysis proves that the visible parts of
the body of man are merely transformed gases; but in a complete analysis
of a living body such as man's there are certain elements to

<span id="page_496">p. 496</span>

be considered which are always invisible. <span
id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_609.md) Thus at death there is instantly a
cessation of all bodily consciousness--of all willing, thinking,
movement. The power which has made the body conscious, and which cannot
be compared to any known form of matter, is entirely gone. But there is
left in the body a moment after its departure everything which we know
to be material--the animal heat, the animal magnetism, the animal
vitality. When these are gone, the body is cold and stiff, and in no
essential way unlike any other mass of inert matter. If heat be applied
to the body, or magnetism, or vital forces, there is nothing in it to
retain them any more than there would be in a stone. The real man is
gone. Then the body begins to disintegrate. The law of the conservation
of energy and the indestructibility of matter makes it certain that in
the process of death nothing has been lost, certainly nothing material.
The animal heat has gone off somewhere in the atmosphere or in some
other matter; the animal magnetism and vitality are momentarily lost
sight of, but soon they will be attached to other organic beings such as
plants or animals to begin a new cycle of embodiment. The physical
constituents of the body will go to their appropriate places, into the
air as gases, into the water as fluids, into the earth as salts and
minerals, and in a short time may form the parts of a flower, or fruit,
or animal. But where or what is the willing, the thinking, the
remembering, the directing force which once controlled all these and
held them together in unity? Ultra-violet rays are invisible, but they
show their existence through their chemical action; similarly a soul or
Ego may exist invisibly and show its existence through the vital and
physical unity manifested by a living human being. As we have already
seen in the preceding chapter, there are a number of the first men of
science who feel that when

<span id="page_497">p. 497</span>

all, the data of the latest scientific discoveries in the realm of
psychology and of psychical research are impartially examined there is
no escape from some such hypothesis as the ancient hypothesis of a soul.

If we accept the soul hypothesis, as it seems we must, and regard a soul
as an indestructible unit of invisible power possessing consciousness
and volition, and normally able to exist independently of a human body,
then it becomes a logical and a scientific necessity to postulate its
preexistence, because as such a unit it is indestructible, in accordance
with the law of the conservation of energy and indestructibility of
matter. We speak here not of the ordinary soul or human personal
consciousness, but of that Ego which Celtic mystics conceive as the
permanent principle (though probably itself relative to some still
higher power) behind the personality--which, in turn, they believe is a
temporary combination wholly dependent upon the Ego. Accordingly, it is
scientifically possible for such a soul as a homogeneous unit of force
or conscious energy to pass from one mass of matter or physical body to
another without disintegration, diminution, or loss of its own identity.
It is scientifically certain, also, from experiments performed to test
the power of resistance to decomposition exhibited by the force which we
call life in an organic body, that such a force is capable of outwearing
many physical embodiments. <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) Recent
demonstrations tend to show that the heredity hypothesis cannot be held
to account fully for such widely varied character or soul individuality
as may be exhibited by members of one family. We must therefore account
for mental, moral, and certainly psychical inequalities among our race
by some other hypothesis; and no hypothesis is more scientific, more in
line with known physiological and psychical processes, or more in accord
with the law of evolution, than that of re-birth.

<span id="page_498">p. 498</span>

The theory of the mechanical transmission of acquired characteristics in
a purely physical manner through the germ-plasm is no longer tenable
when all the data of physiology and psychology are admitted. A
vitalistic view of evolution is rapidly developing in the scientific
world, and the weight of evidence is decidedly in favour of regarding
all evolutionary processes, reaching from the lowest to the highest
organisms, as illustrating a gradual unfolding in the sensuous world of
a pre-existing psychical power through an ever-increasing complexity of
specialized structures, this complexity being brought about by natural
selection. Such a view is also strongly supported if not confirmed by
the general scientific belief that spontaneous generation of life is and
always has been impossible on our planet or on any planet: there must
have been life before its physical manifestation or its physical
evolution began.

We may regard this psychical power as like a vast reservoir of
consciousness ever trying to force itself through matter, the walls of
the reservoir. Through the microscopic body of an amoeba there has
percolated a very minute drop from the reservoir. As evolution advances,
the walls of the reservoir become more and more porous, and little by
little the drop increases to a tiny rivulet. Through the higher animals,
the tiny rivulet flows as a brook. Through man as he is, the brook flows
as a deep and broad river. Throughout the completely evolved man of the
far distant future, the deep and broad river will have overflowed all
its banks, it will have inundated and completely overwhelmed the
animal-human nature of the individual through whom it flows, as the
whole volume of the vast reservoir pours itself out. The ordinary
consciousness of man will then have been transmuted into the
subconsciousness, of which it had always been a pale reflection. In
other words, if the theory of the mechanical transmission of acquired
characteristics has failed, as seems to be the case, then we must assume
that there is, as the bearer of all gains made from generation to
generation, some sort of psychical or vitalistic principle. This, making
use of the germ-plasm merely as a physical

<span id="page_499">p. 499</span>

basis for its manifestation, begins to build up a body suited to its
further evolutionary needs.

The brilliant discoveries of Dr. Jacques Loeb and of M. Yves Delage have
demolished absolutely the old idea that each organ and each tissue
contained in embryo in the normal egg-germ must develop in a particular
and coordinate way into a normal organism and after the parental type:
it is possible to make a head grow where there ought to be feet; and at
Zürich, Standfuss, solely through changing the temperature of his
laboratory, was able to obtain from the same species of butterfly forms
which were tropical and forms which were arctic. <span
id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_611.md) All this helps to establish the
hypothesis, which amounts to certainty, that the conformation of a
physical body, or even the kind of species to be born, is directly
determined by physical environment and not by heredity, and that the
chief factor to consider in organisms is the life animating the body.
Physical environment affects only the physical organism; it does not
affect the invisible and unknown life-principle resident within the
physical organism.

The process of fertilization is a physical process. As such it is simply
initiatory to embryonic evolution which also is physical. Once the
proper physical conditions are set up by the parents, life pursues its
marvellous progress in the womb of the human mother, from the
amoeba-like initial embryo to man. That is to say, parents set in motion
the laws governing, the reproduction of physical bodies. They create
such conditions as enable the invisible life-force to begin its physical
manifestation. <span id="fr_674"></span>[2](#fn_612.md) In the two fused
germs from the

<span id="page_500">p. 500</span>

parents resides the physical inheritance of the offspring, to be
outwardly shaped by environment; but the physical inheritance is a thing
distinct from the psychical part of the living being, just as much as
the dead human body is a thing apart from the life which has left it.
Though the old heredity theory is overthrown by late discoveries, the
question as to what life is in human bodies under all possible
environmental conditions remains unsolved; and so do the questions why
there should be sports in nature, which among man are called geniuses,
and why every human being has a distinct and highly developed individual
character, essentially unlike that of his immediate ancestors.

Embryology proves conclusively that the human embryo retraces in its
growth the evolution of lower life-forms. At first consisting of two
single cells fused into one, it is like the amoeba. By cell-division it
grows and progresses step by step through each lower realm of being
until it comes to be a water-creature with gills; and science teaches
that all organic life on this planet once dwelt in the seas. It grows
progressively out of the water-world stage of organic life into the
world of air-breathing creatures. Nature at last achieves her highest
product, and a human being is born out of the Womb of Time. The initial
microscopic bit of germ-plasm is endowed with power of motion, thought,
and human consciousness, with dominion over all the lower kingdoms
through which by right of ancient conquests it passed in the brief
period of nine months. On every side the problem of life is full of
poetry and wonder; it is the greatest mystery.

Not only can we thus study the age-long evolution of the physical man,
but we have recently acquired sufficient scientific data to lay
foundations for a study of the evolution of the psychical man. Thus, for
example, instincts seem to be nothing more than habits which through
unknown periods of time have become so ingrained in the constitution of
man, and of all animals, that now they have become second nature and
usually are exercised without the need of reasoning processes. The
influence from innate sensuous experiences rises into consciousness as
the life of every normal child and youth

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

unfolds itself; and these experiences in their full expansion, when the
age of maturity has been reached, constitute in their unity what we call
character, which, in one sense, may be defined as the sum total of
instincts of every kind. From such a point of view, the psychical or
invisible power in man is merely a bundle of acquired habits which make
use of the bodily organism in order to express themselves--in the same
way, as we have pointed out, that electrical forces manifest their
presence through a conductor. If these habits be good, we call their
possessor a good man; if evil, we call him an evil man.

The theory of Charles Darwin suggests that all evolutionary progress is
directed to the acquirement of newer and ever higher instincts. And if
this process be the true one, that is to say, if all instincts, which in
their finer distinctions mark off species from species in all animal
kingdoms, be as Darwin thought--and as is to-day more clearly
evident--the result of a long and gradual evolution through experience
in a sensuous realm of existence, then it would seem to follow that
there must be some kind of a monad (probably a non-sensuous one) to
which such acquired instincts can attach themselves. Such a monad, too,
must have been a percipient and hence a recorder of such
ever-accumulating experiences throughout an inconceivably long chain of
lives, and it of itself must, while so perceiving and recording, not be
subject to the transitoriness of the sensuous realm wherein it gathers
together these instincts, which in their unified expression form its
personality or human character.

In harmony with the vitalistic view of evolution, which implies a
pre-existent psychical power continually striving to express itself
completely through matter, yet normally able to exist independently of a
physical means of expression, we should regard such high mental
processes as judgement, reasoning, analysis and synthesis, and spatial
perception, along with memory, as resultants of very great experience in
a sensuous world, on which in our present psycho-physical constitution
such processes appear to have direct bearing. In other words, for man to
be able to exercise such high

<span id="page_502">p. 502</span>

mental processes there is need to postulate incalculable ages of
specialization in the nervous apparatus, and in psychophysical
adjustment, of a kind which has thus enabled the psychical power to
express itself to such a supreme degree in the realm of mind and matter.
The same vitalistic argument is applicable to the lower mental processes
and to the instinctual powers in man, because we cannot at any time, in
viewing the complete evolution of man as a twofold being composed of a
physical and a psychical part, force aside Fechner's conviction that the
problem is a psychophysical one. A study of sexual instincts in children
seems to confirm this. <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_613.md)

Such a psychical and vitalistic hypothesis is, as we have seen, strongly
supported by embryology; and embryology proves conclusively the need of
long ages of physical evolution for the development of each tissue and
highly specialized organ in the human body. Certain French and German
and other scientists of the vitalistic school have demonstrated
physiologically the need of a pre-existent power as the unifying
principle which attracts and compels material atoms to group themselves
into the pattern of the human body <span
id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_614.md)--or, as we may add, of any organic body.
Psychical researchers at the outset of their science seem apparently to
have demonstrated psychologically the post-existence of the personal
consciousness-unity; and it is very likely when further progress has
been made in psychics that there will arise a logical need to postulate,
in addition to the personal consciousness-unity, a hypothetical
pre-existent soul-monad as the unifying principle which attracts and
compels psychical atoms of experience (if such an expression may be

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

used) to group themselves into the personal consciousness-unity which
appears to survive the death of the gross physical body--for a long or
short time, as future research may show. <span
id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_615.md) Such a soul-monad, to follow the view
held by Celtic mystics, led by acquired instincts which were transmitted
to it through the personality (held by the Celtic esoteric doctrine to
be a temporary combination), apparently weaves out of matter the
body-unit adapted to its further evolution, in a way analogous to that
in which a silkworm is led by acquired instincts to weave a cocoon. This
body-unit is twofold: (1) the visible body derived from the visible
elements of matter; and (2) the invisible or ghost-body derived from the
invisible or ethereal elements of matter.

Strictly speaking, for the Celtic mystic this soul-monad is something
upon which the personal consciousness depends for its psychical unity in
precisely the same way as the physical body depends upon the personal
consciousness for its physical unity. The Celtic mystic holds that just
as the body-unity falls back again into its primal elements of matter,
so the personal consciousness-unity (apparently able to survive in the
ghost-body for a long period after its separation from the grosser
physical envelope or human body) also in due time is discarded by the
soul-monad or individuality, and then falls back into its primal
psychical constituents. In other words, the Celtic Esoteric Doctrine of
Re-birth correctly interpreted does not conceive personal immortality,

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>

but it conceives a greater kind of immortality--the immortality of the
unknown principle which gives unity to each temporary personality it
makes use of, and which we prefer to designate as the individuality, the
impersonator. And this individuality is the bearer of all evolutionary
gains made in each temporary personality through which it reflects
itself: it is the permanent evolving principle.

Perhaps an analogy drawn from nature will make the Celtic position
clearer: we may say that the personality occupies a position between the
human body and the soul-monad, just as the moon occupies a position
between the earth and the sun. Personal consciousness is to the human
body what the moonlight is to the earth, merely a pale reflection from a
third thing, the soul-monad or individuality, which is the ultimate
source of both sets of unities, the material or body-unity in its
twofold aspect and the psychical or personal consciousness-unity. Each
personality is temporary, while the individuality, like the sun in
relation to the earth and moon, is capable of at least a relative
immortality: the sun's light, as science holds, existed before there was
any moon to reflect it on to the earth, and may continue to exist when
both the moon and earth are disintegrated. The essential nature of the
sun's energy or life remains unknown to science; so does the essential
nature of the energy or life manifesting itself as the individuality.
Though all such analogies are more or less weak, this one adequately
fits in with the theories concerning the Celtic Esoteric Doctrine of
Re-birth which the most learned of contemporary Celts, chiefly mystics,
have favoured us with; and it is our rare privilege to put these
theories on record for whatever they may be worth. The best hypothesis
is always the one which best explains all available data, and, to our
mind, when very minutely examined, in a way which (chiefly for reasons
of space) cannot be attempted here, this Celtic hypothesis concerning
the nature and destiny of man is the best hitherto adduced. <span
id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_616.md)

<span id="page_505">p. 505</span>

Objectors to the Re-birth Doctrine as held by the Celts and other
peoples anciently and now, naturally ask why, if

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

we have lived before here on earth in physical bodies, we do not
remember it. But the shallowness and unscientific nature of this
question is at once apparent to psychologists who know that there exists
in man a subconscious mind which in the great mass of people is almost
totally dormant. 'The subconscious self,' wrote William James, 'is
nowadays a well-accredited psychological entity ... Apart from all
religious considerations, there is actually and literally more life in
our total soul than we are at any time aware of.' And he added:--'It
thus is "scientific" to interpret all otherwise unaccountable invasive
alternations of consciousness as results of the tension of subliminal
memories reaching a bursting point.' <span
id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_617.md) Intuition, which all men have
experienced, would seem to be the result of a momentary contact by the
physical brain with its psychical counterpart--the subconscious self,
the individuality is distinguished from the personality.

Certain observed psychological processes in ordinary men and women, who
never really know that they have a subconsciousness or Transcendental
Self, prove that it exists even for them, and any part of man which
exists and functions of itself can be developed so as to be consciously
perceived. This is incontestable. Let us point out a few of these
observed and recorded psychological processes. There may be an unsolved
problem in the mind, or inability to recall a certain name or fact, and
then a sudden, unexpected

<span id="page_507">p. 507</span>

intuitional solving of the problem and an instantaneous recollecting of
the desired facts, at a time when the ordinary mind may be entirely
absorbed in altogether foreign thoughts. Again, many persons through
accident or disease have lost their memory to such an extent as to
require complete re-education, and then in time, gradually or
instantaneously, as the case may be, have completely recovered it. <span
id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_618.md) And we noticed in our study of
supernatural lapse of time ([p. 469](ffcc411.htm#page_469).md) that at the
moment of accidental loss of consciousness, as in drowning for example,
all forgotten details of life are instantaneously reproduced in a
complete panorama. These psychological processes support what we have
said above with respect to a psychical organ being behind the
sense-consciousness, and seem thus to prove that the subconscious mind
is the place for recording permanently all experiences. <span
id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_619.md) Under hypnosis, a subject may be
requested to perform a certain act, let us say 11,999 minutes after the
moment of making the request. When the hypnotic condition is removed,
the subject has no personal consciousness of the suggestion, but, as
different experiments have proved conclusively, he invariably performs
the act exactly at the expiration of the 11,999 minutes without knowing
why he does so. This proves that there is a subconsciousness in man
which can take full cognizance of such a suggestion, which can keep
count of the passing of time and then cause the unconscious personality
to act in response to its will. <span id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_620.md)
Again, in extreme old age people who have come to have an imperfect
memory or none at all in their normal consciousness, under abnormal
conditions (which seemingly are due to a temporary influx of a latent
psychical power into the physical body and brain, or else to an
awakening of a dormant force within the physical body and brain
themselves) often regain, for a time, complete and clear memory of their
childhood. This proves that the memory is somewhere still

<span id="page_508">p. 508</span>

perfect, and that it does not reside in the consciousness of the
age-exhausted physical brain and memory. Albert Moll, in his treatise on
hypnotism, says that events in the normal life which have dropped out of
memory can be remembered in hypnosis:--'An English officer in Africa was
hypnotized by Hansen, and suddenly began to speak a strange language.
This turned out to be Welsh, which he had learnt as a child, but had
forgotten.' <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_621.md) And even memory of
acts done in hypnotic somnambulism can be awakened in the normal
state. <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_622.md) Furthermore, through
psycho-analysis, as Professor Freud has shown, forgotten dreams and
dreams which were never complete in the ordinary consciousness can be
recovered in their entirety out of the subconsciousness. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_623.md) How many of us can recall without some
mental stimulus certain acts performed ten years ago? A good deal of our
present life is no longer vivid, much of it is forgotten, and in old age
many of the memories of youth and of mature life will be subconscious.
If this brain, whose total existence is comprised between birth and
death, cannot remember in a normal way all its own experiences, how
could it be expected to know anything at all of hypothetical past lives
where there were various physical brains long ago disintegrated--unless
the hypothetically ever-existing transcendental individuality, whose
consciousness is the subconsciousness, be made by some unusual psychical
stimuli to transmit its memory of the past lives to each new brain it
creates? In other words, to have memory of pre-existent conditions there
must be continuity of association with present conditions. If such
continuity exists, it exists in the subconsciousness. And if it exists
therein, then in order to recall in the present personal or ordinary
consciousness, which began at birth, memory of an anterior state of
consciousness, it would be necessary to hold impressed upon the present
physical brain and body a clear and unremittent consciousness of the

<span id="page_509">p. 509</span>

sub-consciousness. In relation to our personal consciousness, apparently
our greatest powers lie in the subconsciousness which is sleeping and in
embryo, awaiting to be born into the consciousness of this world through
the slow process of evolutionary gestation. In the case of a Buddha, who
on good historical authority is said to have been able to recall all
past existences from the lowest to the highest, this evolutionary
process seems to have reached completion. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[1](#fn_624.md)

Under ordinary conditions, individuals have been known to see a place
which they have never seen before, or to do a thing which they have
never done before in this life nor in any conscious dream-state, and yet
feel that they have seen the place before and done the thing before. M.
Th. Ribot, in his *Diseases of Memory* (chapter iv), has brought
together many cases of this kind. Some are undoubtedly explicable as
forgotten experiences of the present life. Others, to our mind, strongly
support the theory of pre-existent experiences preserved in memory in
the subconsciousness.

Under chloroform, or other anaesthetics, patients often recover for the
time being forgotten facts of experience, and sometimes appear to make
momentary contact with their subconsciousness and to exhibit therein
another personality. In certain well-defined types of double
personality, which are not the kind due to demon-possession nor to
spirit-possession as in 'mediumship', there are two memories, 'each
complete and absolutely independent of the other.' <span
id="fr_687"></span>[2](#fn_625.md) And in similar cases, where the subject
exhibits alternately numerous personalities, we see the individuality,
that is to say the subconscious man, exhibiting, as a dramatist might,
various characters or personalities of probable past existences

<span id="page_510">p. 510</span>

according as each is most active at the moment. Similarly,
crystal-gazing sometimes seems not only to revive lost memories of this
life, but also to call up subconscious memories of some unknown state of
consciousness which may be from a previous life.  <span
id="fr_688"></span>[1](#fn_626.md)

M. Ribot has made it clear from his careful study of numerous cases of
amnesia (loss of memory) that 'recollections return in an inverse order
to that in which they disappear'. For example, a celebrated Russian
astronomer lost all memory save that of his childhood, and in recovering
it there appeared first the recollections of youth, then those of middle
age, then the experiences of later years, and, finally, the most recent
events. Many even more marked examples of the law of regression in
amnesia are given by M. Ribot. We conclude from them that all strange
and apparently long-forgotten facts of experience arising in
consciousness out of the subconsciousness, as in the different cases
which have been cited above, would necessarily be those which have been
the longest lost to memory; and hence if they cannot be attached to this
present life then they can only be derived from a former life, because
every primary detail of memory must always originate from an experience
at some past period

<span id="page_511">p. 511</span>

of time. M. Ribot himself, in his conclusion to *The Diseases of
Memory*, makes this significant observation with respect to the law of
regression in amnesia:--'This law of regression provides us with an
explanation for extraordinary revivification of certain recollections
when the mind turns backward to conditions of existence that had
apparently disappeared for ever.'

In dreams there is a great wealth of latent memory; sometimes memory of
the present waking life, but often not capable, apparently, of being
attached to it, nor explicable as due to the soul wandering from the
body during sleep: the hypothesis of re-birth seems to be the only
adequate one here. Certain dreams suggest that man possesses innate
memories extending backwards to prehistoric times (cf. [p.
5](ffcc110.htm#page_5) above.md). This fits in with Professor Freud's
theory in his *Die Traumdeutung*, that 'the dream is nothing else than
the concealed fulfilment of a repressed wish.' Some dreams are 'in the
form of frightful, cruel, horrible scenes, which seem frightful to us,
but in a certain depth of the unconscious satisfy wishes which, in the
"prehistoric" ages of our own mental development, were actually
recognized as desires.' <span id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_627.md) This also
supports our vitalistic view of the evolution of human instincts. Again,
in somnambulism there is a much more exalted memory, and clear cases are
on record of facts being then consciously present which cannot be
accounted for save through the same hypothesis. <span
id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_628.md)

If we keep in mind the psychology of the dream state, we

<span id="page_512">p. 512</span>

shall probably get the clearest intellectual theory as to why, if
pre-existence be true, we do not remember various previous states of
existence. In our present state of consciousness we may enter a dream
state, in that dream state by dreaming we enter a second dream state,
and theoretically, though not by common experience, there may be no
limit to superimposed dream states, each one in itself a state of
consciousness distinct from the waking consciousness. Accordingly, if,
as Wordsworth put it, 'our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting' of
another state of consciousness, and death the abrupt ending of that
sleep of dreams and a waking up, or if the direct opposite be true, and
death is the entrance to a sleep and dream state of consciousness, it
becomes very clear how difficult it would be for us here now either to
recall what we may have dreamt or have actually done in another state of
conscious existence corresponding to our present one. The subtle
thinkers of modern India, who completely accept the doctrine of re-birth
as a universal law, have summed up this abstruse aspect of the dream
psychology as follows:--'The first or spiritual state was ecstasy; from
ecstasy it (the Ego) forgot itself into deep sleep; from deep sleep it
awoke out of unconsciousness, but still within itself, into the internal
world of dreams; from dreaming it passed finally into the thoroughly
waking state, and the outer world of sense.' <span
id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_629.md) But our own psychologists are not yet
far enough advanced to accept this; much more work in psychical research
must first be done before it will be possible for them to announce to
the West that pre-existence is a necessary condition for post-existence
which they now hypothetically accept. If for the present our standpoint
be that of our own psychologists, we may then think of the human
consciousness as a spectrum whose central parts alone are visible to us.
Beyond at either end lies an unseen and to us unknown region, awaiting
its explorer from the West. 'Each one of us is in reality an abiding
psychical entity far more extensive than he knows--an individuality
which can never express itself completely through any corporeal
manifestation. The

<span id="page_513">p. 513</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Self manifests
through the organism; but there is always some part of the Self
unmanifested; and always, as it seems, some power of organic expression
in abeyance or reserve.' <span id="fr_692"></span>[1](#fn_630.md) William
James stated the position thus:--'The B. region' (another name for the
region of subconsciousness), 'then; is obviously the larger part of each
of us, for it is the abode of everything that is latent, and the
reservoir of everything that passes unrecorded and unobserved.' <span
id="fr_693"></span>[2](#fn_631.md)

Men of science see no way of accepting the doctrine of the resurrection
of the physical body as at present interpreted by Christian theology;
but the late Professor Th. Henri Martin, Dean of the Faculty of Letters
of the University of Rennes, has suggested in his *La Vie future* that
the doctrine may be the exoteric interpretation of a long-forgotten
esoteric truth; namely, that the soul may be resurrected in a new
physical body, and this is scientifically possible. <span
id="fr_694"></span>[3](#fn_632.md)

The ancient scientists called Life a Circle. In the upper half of this
Circle, or here on the visible plane, we know that in the physiological
history of man and of all living things there

<span id="page_514">p. 514</span>

is first the embryonic or prenatal state, then birth; and as life, like
a sun, rises in its new-born power toward the zenith, there is
childhood, youth, and maturity; and then, as it passes the zenith on its
way to the horizon, there is decline, old age, and, finally, death; and
as a scientific possibility we have in the lower half of the Circle, in
Hades or the Otherworld of the Celts and of all peoples, corresponding
processes between death and a hypothetical but logically necessary
re-birth. <span id="fr_695"></span>[1](#fn_633.md)

The logical corollary to the re-birth doctrine, and an integral part of
the Celtic esoteric theory of evolution, is that there have been human
races like the present human race who in past aeons of time have evolved
completely out of the human plane of conscious existence into the divine
plane of conscious existence. Hence the gods are beings which once were
men, and the actual race of men will in time become gods. Man now stands
related to the divine and invisible world in precisely the same manner
that the brute stands related to the human race. To the gods, man is a
being in a lower kingdom of evolution. According to the complete Celtic
belief, the gods can and do enter the human world for the specific
purposes of teaching men how to advance most rapidly toward the higher
kingdom. In other words, all the Great Teachers, e. g. Jesus, Buddha,
Zoroaster, and many others, in different ages and among various races,
whose teachings are extant, are, according to a belief yet held by
educated and mystical Celts, divine beings who in inconceivably past
ages were men but who are now gods, able at will to incarnate into our
world, in order to emphasize the need which exists in nature, by virtue
of the working of evolutionary laws (to which they themselves are still
subject), for man to look forward, and so strive to reach divinity
rather than to look backward in evolution and thereby fall into mere
animalism. The stating of this mystical corollary makes the exposition
of the Fairy-Faith complete, at least in outline.

<span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

As shown by the Barddas MSS. in our chapter vii, the Celtic Doctrine of
Re-birth is the scientific extension of Darwin's law as corrected, <span
id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_634.md) that alone through traversing the Circle
of Life man reaches that destined perfection which natural analogies,
life's processes as exhibited by living things, and evolution, suggest,
and from which at present man is so far removed. There seems to emerge
this postulate: the world is the object of normal consciousness, the Ego
or Soul-Monad the object of subconsciousness; and the subconsciousness
cannot be realized in the world until through the normal consciousness
of man the Ego is able to function completely, and so endow man with
full self-consciousness in matter, which endowment seems to be the goal
of all planetary evolution.

We conclude that the Otherworld of the Celts and their Doctrine of
Re-birth accord thoroughly in their essentials with modern science; and,
accordingly, with other essential elements in the complete Celtic
Fairy-Faith which we have in the preceding chapter found to be equally
scientific, establish our Psychological Theory of the Nature and Origin
of that Fairy-Faith upon a logical and solid foundation; and we now
submit this study to the judgement of our readers. With more complete
evidence in the future, both from folklore and from science, there will
be, we trust, a better vindication of the Theory, and perhaps finally
there will come about its transformation into what it but seems to us to
be now--a Fact.

Some beliefs which a century ago were regarded as absurdities are now
regarded as fundamentally scientific. In the same way, what in this
generation is heretical alike to the Christian theologian and to the man
of science may in coming generations be accepted as orthodox.

good scientific reasons for postulating the actual existence of
intelligent beings possessed of an invisible yet physical body. There
may well be on and about our planet many distinct invisible organic
life-forms undiscovered by zoologists. To deny such a possibility would

discover, as they probably will in time, what they call the secret of
life, they will not have discovered the secret of life at all. What they
will have discovered will be the physical conditions under which life
manifests itself. In other words, science will most likely soon be able
to set up artificially in a laboratory such physical conditions as exist
in nature naturally, and by means of which life is able to manifest
itself through matter. Life will still be as great a mystery as it is
to-day; though short-sighted materialists are certain to announce to an
eager world that the final problem of the universe has been solved and
that life is merely the resultant of a subtle chemical compound.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[502:1](ffcc412.htm#fr_675.md) Professor Freud,
after long and careful study, arrived at the following conclusion:--'The
child has his sexual impulse and activities from the beginning, he
brings them with him into the world, and from these the so-called normal
sexuality of adults emerges by a significant development through
manifold stages.' And Dr. Sanford Bell, in an earlier writing entitled
*A Preliminary Study of the Emotions of Love between the Sexes* (see
*Amer. Journ. Psych.*, 1902), came to a similar conclusion (of. Freud,
op. cit., pp. 207-8).

<span id="fn_615"></span>[503:1](ffcc412.htm#fr_677.md) This Celtic view of
non-personal immortality completely fits in with all the voluminous data
of psychical research: after forty years of scientific research into
psychics there are no proofs yet adduced that the human personality as a
self-sufficient unit of consciousness survives indefinitely the death of
its body. Granted that it does survive as a ghost for an undetermined
period, generally to be counted in years, during which time it seems to
be gradually fading out or disintegrating, there is no reliable evidence
anywhere to show that a personality *as such* has manifested through a
'medium' or otherwise after an interval of one thousand years, or even
of five hundred years. We have, in fact, no knowledge of the Survival of
a human personality one hundred years after, and probably there are no
good examples of such a survival twenty-five years after the death of
the body. Such an eminent psychical researcher as William James
recognized this drift of the data of psychics, and when he died he held
the conviction that there is no personal immortality (see p.
[505](#page_505) n. following.md).

<span id="fn_616"></span>[504:1](ffcc412.htm#fr_678.md) Though not inclined
toward the vitalistic view of human evolution, M. Th. Ribot very closely
approaches the Celtic view of the Ego (or <span id="page_505">p.
505</span> individuality) as being the principle which gives unity to
different personalities, but he does not have in mind personalities in
the sense implied by the Celtic Esoteric Doctrine of Re-birth:--'The Ego
subjectively considered consists of a sum of conscious states'
(comparable to personalities).

'In brief, the Ego may be considered in two ways: either in its actual
form, and then it is the sum of existing conscious states; or, in its
continuity with the past, and then it is formed by the memory according
to the process outlined above. It would seem, according to this view,
that the identity of the Ego depended entirely upon the memory. But such
a conception is only partial. Beneath the unstable compound phenomenon
in all its protean phases of growth, degeneration, and reproduction,
there is a something that remains: and this something is the undefined
consciousness, the product of all the vital processes, constituting
bodily perception and what is expressed in one word--the *cœnæthesis*.'
(*The Diseases of Memory*, pp. 107-8).

William James, the greatest psychologist of our epoch, after a long and
faithful life consecrated to the search after a true understanding of
human consciousness, finally arrived at substantially the same
conviction as Fechner did, that there is no personal immortality, but
that the personality is but a temporary and partial separation and
circumscription of a part of a larger whole, into which it is reabsorbed
at death' (W. McDougall, *In Memory of William James*, in *Proc. S. P.
R.*, Part LXII, vol. xxv, p. 28). He thus virtually accepted the
mystic's view that the personality after the death of the body is
absorbed into a higher power, which, to our mind, is comparable with the
Ego conceived as the unifying principle behind personalities. In one of
his last writings, James explained his belief in such a manner as to
make it coincide at certain points with the view held by modern Celtic
mystics which has been presented above; the difference being that,
unlike these mystics, James was not prepared to say (though he raised
the question) whether or not behind the 'mother-sea' of consciousness
there is, as Fechner believed, a hierarchy of consciousnesses
(themselves subordinate to still higher consciousnesses, and comparable
with so many Egos or Individualities) which send out emanations as
temporary human personalities. The organic psychical forms (if we may
use such an expression) of such temporary human personalities would have
to be regarded from James's point of view as being built up out of the
psychical elements constituting the 'mother-sea' of consciousness, just
as the human body is built up out of the physical elements in the realm
of matter:--

'Out of my experience, such as it is (and it is limited enough) one
fixed conclusion dogmatically emerges, and that is this, that we with
our lives are like islands in the sea, or like trees in the forest. The
maple and the pine may whisper to each other with their leaves, and
Conanicut and Newport hear each other's foghorns. But the trees also
commingle their roots in the darkness underground, and the islands also
hang together through the ocean's bottom. Just so there is a continuum
of cosmic consciousness, against which our individuality' (used as
synonymous with personality and not in our distinct sense) 'builds but
accidental fences, and into which <span id="page_506">p. 506</span> our
several minds plunge as into a mother-sea or reservoir. Our "normal"
consciousness' (the personality as we distinguish it from the Ego or
individuality) 'is circumscribed for adaptation to our external earthly
environment, but the fence is weak in spots, and fitful influences from
beyond break in, showing the otherwise unverifiable common connexion.
Not only psychic research, but metaphysical philosophy and speculative
biology are led in their own ways to look with favour on some such
"pan-psychic" view of the universe as this.' (W. James, *The Confidences
of* *a Psychical Researcher*, in *The American Magazine*, October 1909).
Again, James wrote:--'The drift of all the evidence we have seems to me
to sweep us very strongly towards the belief in some form of superhuman
life with which we may, unknown to ourselves, be co-conscious.' (*A
Pluralistic Universe*, New York, 1909, p. 309.)

high development is to be assumed for a great Celtic hero like Arthur.
who were he to be re-born would (as is said to have been the case with
King Mongan, the reincarnation of Finn) bring with him memory of his
past: unlike the consciousness of the normal man, the consciousness of
one of the Divine Ones is normally the subconsciousness, the
consciousness of the individuality; and not the personal consciousness,
which, like the personality, is non-permanent *in itself*. This further
illustrates the Celtic theory of non-personal immortality.

Walker, in his interesting work on *Reincarnation* (pp. 42-5*)* has
brought together many other well-attested cases of people who likewise
have thought they could remember fragments of a former state of
conscious existence. In his diary, under date of February 17, 1828, Sir
Walter Scott wrote as follows:--'I cannot, I am sure, tell if it is
worth marking down, that yesterday, at dinner-time, I was strangely
haunted by what I would call the sense of pre-existence, viz. a confused
idea that nothing that passed was said for the first time.' Lockhart,
*Life of Scott* (first ed.), vii. 114. Bulwer Lytton in *Godolphin*
(chapter xv), and Edgar Allen Poe in *Eureka*, record similar
experiences. Mr. H. Fielding Hall, in *The Soul of a People* (London,
1902*),* pp. 290-308, reports several very remarkable cases of
responsible natives of Burma who stated that they could recall former
lives passed by them as men and women. Mr. Hall has carefully
investigated these cases, and gives us the impression that they are
worthy of scientific consideration.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[511:1](ffcc412.htm#fr_689.md) Cf. Ferenczi, op.
cit., p. 316, &c. Professor Freud's theory of dreams supports entirely,
but does not imply our hypothesis that some (and probably many) abnormal
dreams of a rare kind, whether good or bad in tendency, may be due to
the latent content of subconsciousness, out of which they undoubtedly
arise, having been collected and carried over from a previous state of
consciousness parallel to our present one. In respect to our present
life Professor Freud holds, as a result of psycho-analysis of thousands
of dream subjects, that the latent content of every dream in the adult
is directly dependent upon mental processes which frequently reach back
to the earliest childhood; and he gives detailed cases in illustration.
In other words, there is always a latent dream-material behind the
conscious dream-content, and probably a part of it was innate in the
child at birth, and hence, according to our view, was pre-existent. (Cf.
Ernest Jones, *Freud's Theory of Dreams*, in *Amer. Journ. Psych.*,

<span id="fn_632"></span>[513:3](ffcc412.htm#fr_694.md) The esoteric
teaching in many of the mystic schools of antiquity was that the atoms
of each human body transmigrate through all lower forms of life during
the long period supposed to intervene between death and re-birth of the
individuality. This doctrine seems to be one of the main sources of the
corruption which crept into the ancient re-birth doctrines and
transformed many of them into doctrines of transmigration of the human
soul into animal and plant bodies; and some unscrupulous priest-hoods
openly taught such corrupted doctrines as a means of making the ignorant
populace submissive to ecclesiastical rule, the theological theory
expounded by such priesthoods being that the evil-doer, but not the
keeper of the letter of the canonical law, is condemned to expiate his
sins through birth in brute bodies. The pure form of the mystic doctrine
was that alter the lapse of the long period of disembodiment the
individuality reconstructs its human body anew by drawing to itself the
identical atoms which constituted its previous human body--these atoms,
and not the individuality, having transmigrated through all the lower
kingdoms. Such an esoteric doctrine probably lies behind the exoteric
Egyptian teaching that the human soul after the death of its body passes
through all plant and animal bodies during a period of three thousand
years, after which it returns to human embodiment. Sonic scholars have
held that the exoteric interpretation of this theory and its consequent
literal interpretation as a transmigration doctrine led the Egyptians to
mummify the bodies of their dead. Cf. Lucretius, *De Rerum Natura*, Book
III, ll. 843-61; and Herodotus, Book II, on Egypt.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[515:1](ffcc412.htm#fr_696.md) Darwin never
considered or attempted to suggest what it is that of itself really
evolves, for it cannot be the physical body which only *grows* from
immaturity to maturity and then dissolves. Darwin thus overlooked the
essential factor in his whole doctrine; while the Druids and other
ancients, wiser than we have been willing to admit, seem not only to
have anticipated Darwin by thousands of years, but also to have quite
surpassed him in setting up their doctrine of re-birth, which explains
both the physical and psychical evolution of man.
