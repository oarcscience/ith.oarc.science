## THE LIVING FAIRY FAITH

## CHAPTER II

### TAKING OF EVIDENCE

'During all these centuries the Celt has kept in his heart some affinity
with the mighty beings ruling in the Unseen, once so evident to the
heroic races who preceded him. His legends and faery tales have
connected his soul with the inner lives of air and water and earth, and
they in turn have kept his heart sweet with hidden influence.'--A. E.

Method of presentation--The logical verdict--Trustworthiness of
legends--The Fairy-Faith held by the highly educated Celt as well as by

from Ireland, with introduction by Dr. Douglas Hyde; from Scotland, with
introduction by Dr. Alexander Carmichael; from the isle of Man, with
introduction by Miss Sophia Morrison; from Wales, with introduction by
the Right Hon. Sir John Rhy^s; from Cornwall, with introduction by Mr.
Henry Jenner; and from Brittany, with introduction by Professor Anatole
Le Braz.

### I. GENERAL INTRODUCTION

VARIOUS possible plans have presented themselves for setting forth the
living Fairy-Faith as I have found it during my travels in the six
Celtic countries among the people who hold it. To take a bit here and a
bit there from a miscellaneous group of psychological experiences, fairy
legends and stories which are linked together almost inseparably in the
mind of the one who tells them, does not seem at all satisfactory, nor
even just, in trying to arrive at a correct result. Classification under
various headings, such, for example, as Fairy Abductions, Changelings,
or Appearances of Fairies, seems equally unsatisfactory; for as soon as
the details of folk-lore such as I am presenting are isolated from one
another--even though brought together in related groups--they must be
rudely torn out of their true and natural environment, and divorced from
the psychological

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

atmosphere amidst which they were first presented by the narrator. The
same objection applies to any plan of dividing the evidence into (1)
that which is purely legendary; (2) that which is second-hand or
third-hand evidence from people who claim to have seen fairies, or to
have been in Fairyland or under fairy influences; and (3) that which is
first-hand evidence from actual percipients: these three classes of
evidence are so self-evident that every reader will be able to
distinguish each class for himself as it occurs, and a mechanical
classification by us is unnecessary. So no plan seems so good as the
plan I have adopted of permitting all witnesses to give their own
testimony in their own way and in its native setting, and then of
classifying and weighing such testimony according to the methods of
comparative religion and the anthropological sciences.

In most cases, as examination will show, the evidence is so clear that
little or no comment is necessary. Most of the evidence also points so
much in one direction that. the only verdict which seems reasonable is
that the Fairy-Faith belongs to a doctrine of souls; that is to say,
that Fairyland is a state or condition, realm or place, very much like,
if not the same as, that wherein civilized and uncivilized men alike
place the souls of the dead, in company with other invisible beings such
as gods, daemons, and all sorts of good and bad spirits. Not only do
both educated and uneducated Celtic seers so conceive Fairyland, but
they go much further, and say that Fairyland actually exists as an
invisible world within which the visible world is immersed like an
island in an unexplored ocean, and that it is peopled by more species of
living beings than this world, because incomparably more vast and varied
in its possibilities.

We should be prepared in hearing the evidence to meet with some
contradictions and a good deal of confusion, for many of the people who
believe in such a strange world as we have just described, and who think
they sometimes have entered it or have seen some of its inhabitants,
have often had no training at all in schools or colleges. But when we
hear legendary tales which have never been recorded save

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

in the minds of unnumbered generations of men, we ought not on that
account to undervalue them; for often they are better authorities and
more trustworthy than many an ancient and carefully inscribed manuscript
in the British Museum; and they are probably far older than the oldest
book in the world. Let us, then, for a time, forget that there are such
things as libraries and universities, and betake ourselves to the Celtic
peasant for instruction, living close to nature as he lives, and
thinking the things which he thinks.

But the peasant will not be our only teacher, for we shall also hear
much of first importance from city folk of the highest intellectual
training. It has become, perhaps always has been in modern times, a
widespread opinion, even among some scholars, that the belief in fairies
is the property solely of simple, uneducated country-folk, and that
people who have had 'a touch of education and a little common sense
knocked into their heads', to use the ordinary language, 'wouldn't be
caught believing in such nonsense.' This same class of critics used to
make similar remarks about people who said there were ghosts, until the
truth of another 'stupid superstition' was discovered by psychical
research. So in this chapter we hope to correct this erroneous opinion
about the Fairy-Faith, an opinion chiefly entertained by scholars and
others who know not the first real fact about fairies, because they have
never lived amongst the people who believe in fairies, but derive all
their information from books and hearsay. In due order the proper sort
of witnesses will substantiate this position, but before coming to their
testimony we may now say that there are men and women in Dublin, in
other parts of Ireland, in Scotland, in the Isle of Man, and in
Brythonic lands too, whom all the world knows as educated leaders in
their respective fields of activity, who not only declare their belief
that fairies were, but that fairies are; and some of these men and women
say that they have the power to see fairies as real spiritual beings.

In the evidence about to be presented there has been no selecting in
favour of any one theory; it is presented as

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

discovered. The only liberty taken with some of the evidence has been to
put it into better grammatical form, and sometimes to recast an
ambiguous statement when I, as collector, had in my own mind no doubt as
to its meaning. Translations have been made as literal as possible;
though sometimes it has been found better to offer the meaning rather
than what in English would be an obscure colloquialism or idiomatic
expression. The method pursued in seeking the evidence has been to
penetrate as deeply and in as natural a way as possible the thoughts of
the people who believe in fairies and like beings, by living among them
and observing their customs and ways of thought, and recording what
seemed relevant to the subject under investigation--chance expressions,
and legends told under various ordinary conditions--rather than to
collect long legends or literary fairy-stories. For these last the
reader is referred to the many excellent works on Celtic folk-lore. We
have sought to bring together, as perhaps has not been done before, the
philosophy of the belief in fairies, rather than the mere fairy-lore
itself, though the two cannot be separated. In giving the evidence
concerning fairies, we sometimes give evidence which, though akin to it
and thus worthy of record, is not strictly fairy-lore. All that we have
omitted from the materials in the form first taken down are stories and
accounts of things not sufficiently related to the world of Faerie to be
of value here.

In no case has testimony been admitted from a person who was known to be
unreliable, nor even from a person who was thought to be unreliable.
Accordingly, the evidence we are to examine ought to be considered good
evidence so far as it goes; and since it represents almost all known
elements of the Fairy-Faith and contains almost all the essential
elements upon which the advocates of the Naturalistic Theory, of the
Pygmy Theory, of the Druid Theory, of the Mythological Theory, as well
as of our own Psychological Theory, must base their arguments, we
consider it very adequate evidence. Nearly every witness is a Celt who
has been made acquainted with the belief in fairies

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

through direct contact with people who believe in them, or through
having heard fairy-traditions among his own kindred, or through personal
psychological experiences. And it is exceedingly fortunate for us that
an unusually large proportion of these Celtic witnesses are actual
percipients and natural seers, because the eliminations from the
Fairy-Faith to be brought about in chapter iii by means of an
anthropological analysis of evidence will be so extensive that,
scientifically and strictly speaking, there will remain as a residual or
unknown quantity, upon which our final conclusion must depend, solely
the testimony of reliable seer-witnesses. That is to say, no method of
anthropological dissection of the evidence can force aside consideration
of the ultimate truth which may or may not reside in the testimony of
sane and thoroughly reliable seer-witnesses.

Old and young, educated and uneducated, peasant and city-bred, testify
to the actual existence of the Celtic Fairy-Faith; and the evidence from
Roman Catholics stands beside that from Protestants, the evidence of
priests supports that of scholars and scientists, peasant seers have
testified to the same kind of visions as highly educated seers; and what
poets have said agrees with what is told by business men, engineers, and
lawyers. But the best of witnesses, like ourselves, are only human, and
subject to the shortcomings of the ordinary man, and therefore no claim
can be made in any case to infallibility of evidence: all the world over
men interpret visions pragmatically and sociologically, or hold beliefs
in accord with their own personal experiences; and are for ever
unconsciously immersed in a sea of psychological influences which
sometimes may be explainable through the methods of sociological
inquiry, sometimes may be supernormal in origin and nature, and hence to
be explained most adequately, if at all, through psychical research. Our
study is a study of human nature itself, and, moreover, often of human
nature in its most subtle aspects, which are called psychical; and the
most difficult problem of all is for human nature to interpret and
understand its own ultimate essence and psychological

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

instincts. Our whole aim is to discover what reasonableness may or may
not stand behind a belief so vast, so ancient, so common (contrary to
popular non-Celtic opinion) to all classes of Celts, and so fundamental
a shaping force in European history, religion, and social institutions.

When we state our conviction that the Fairy-Faith is common to all
classes of Celts, we do not state that it is common to all Celts. The
materialization of the age has affected the Fairy-Faith as it has
affected all religious beliefs the world over. This has been pointed out
by Dr. Hyde, by Dr. Carmichael, and by Mr. Jenner in their respective
introductions for Ireland, Scotland, and Cornwall. Nevertheless, the
Fairy-Faith as the folk-religion of the Celtic peoples is still able to
count its adherents by hundreds of thousands. Even in many cases where
Christian theology has been partially or wholly discarded by educated
Celts, in the country or in the city, as being to them in too many
details out of harmony with accepted scientific truths, the belief in
fairies has been jealously retained, and will, so it would seem, be
retained in the future.

We are now prepared to hear about the *Daoine Maithee*, the 'Good
People', as the Irish call their *Sidhe* race; about the 'People of
Peace', the 'Still-Folk' or the 'Silent Moving Folk ', as the Scotch
call their *Sìth* who live in green knolls and in the mountain
fastnesses of the Highlands; about various Manx fairies; about the
*Tylwyth Teg*, the 'Fair-Family' or 'Fair-Folk', as the Welsh people
call their fairies; about Cornish Pixies; and about *Fees* (fairies),
*Corrigans*, and the Phantoms of the Dead in Brittany. And along with
these, for they are very much akin, let us hear about ghosts--sometimes
about ghosts who discover hidden treasure, as in our story of the
*Golden Image*--about goblins, about various sorts of death-warnings
generally coming from apparitions of the dead, or from banshees, about
death-candles and phantom-funerals, about leprechauns, about hosts of
the air, and all kinds of elementals and spirits--in short, about all
the orders of beings who mingle together in that invisible realm called
Fairyland.
