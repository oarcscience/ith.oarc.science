THIS BOOK

DEPENDS CHIEFLY UPON THE ORAL AND WRITTEN TESTIMONY  
SO FREELY CONTRIBUTED BY ITS MANY CELTIC AUTHORS,--  
THE PEASANT AND THE SCHOLAR, THE PRIEST AND THE SCIENTIST,  
THE POET AND THE BUSINESS MAN, THE SEER AND THE NON-SEER,--  
AND IN HONOUR OF THEM

I DEDICATE  
  
IT TO

TWO OF THE BRETHREN IN IRELAND

A.E.,

WHOSE UNWAVERING LOYALTY TO THE FAIRY-FAITH  
HAS INSPIRED MUCH THAT I HAVE HEREIN WRITTEN,  
WHOSE FRIENDLY GUIDANCE IN MY STUDY OF IRISH MYSTICISM  
I MOST GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE;  
AND

WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS,

WHO BROUGHT ME AT MY OWN ALMA MATER IN CALIFORNIA  
THE FIRST MESSAGE FROM FAIRYLAND,  
AND WHO AFTERWARDS IN HIS OWN COUNTRY  
LED ME THROUGH THE HAUNTS OF FAIRY KINGS AND QUEENS.

 

Oxford  
  *November* 1911.

'It remains for ever true that the proper study of mankind is man; and
even early man is not beneath contempt, especially when he proves to
have had within him the makings of a great race, with its highest
notions of duty and right, and all else that is noblest in the human
soul.'  
 The Right Hon. SIR JOHN RHY^S.
