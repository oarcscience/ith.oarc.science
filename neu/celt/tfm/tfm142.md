THE FAIRY BORROWING OATMEAL

>  

> A FAIRY came one day from one of the turrets of Craig-ail-naic to the
> wife of one of the tenants in Delnabo, and asked her to lend her a
> firlot of oatmeal for food for her family, promising to repay it soon,
> as she was every moment expecting an ample supply. The woman complied
> with this request, and after, as was the custom of the country, having
> regaled her with bread, cheese, and whiskey, she went, as was usual,
> to see her a part of the way home. When they had reached the summit of
> an eminence near the town, the *Béanshi* told her she might take her
> meal home again as she was now abundantly supplied. The woman did as
> desired, and as she went along she beheld the corn-kiln of an adjacent
> farm all in a blaze.
