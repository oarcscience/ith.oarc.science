SIR THYNNE.

>  

> AND it was the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> He was a knight so grave;  
> Whether he were on foot or on horse,  
> He was a knight so brave. \[a\]

> And it was the knight Sir Thynnè  
> Went the hart and the hind to shoot,  
> So he saw Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> At the green linden's foot.

> And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> Unto her handmaid she cried,  
> "Go fetch my gold harp hither to me,  
> Sir Thynnè I'll draw to my side."

> The first stroke on her gold harp she struck,  
> So sweetly she made it ring,  
> The wild beasts in the wood and field  
> They forgot whither they would spring.

> The next stroke on her gold harp she struck,  
> So sweetly she made it ring,  
> The little gray hawk that sat on the bough,  
> He spread out both his wings.

> The third stroke on her gold harp she struck,  
> So sweetly she made it ring,  
> The little fish that went in the stream,  
> He forgot whither he would swim.

> Then flowered the mead, then leafed all,  
> 'Twas caused by the runic lay; \[b\]  
> Sir Thynnè he struck his spurs in his horse,  
> He no longer could hold him away.

> And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> From his horse he springs hastily,  
> So goeth he to Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> All under the green linden tree.

> "Here you sit, my maiden fair,  
> A rose all lilies above;  
> See you can never a mortal man  
> Who will not seek your love."

> "Be silent, be silent, now Sir Thynnè,  
> With your proffers of love, I pray;  
> For I am betrothed unto a hill-king,  
> A king all the Dwarfs obey.

> "My true love he sitteth the bill within,  
> And at gold tables plays merrily;  
> My father he setteth his champions in ring,  
> And in iron arrayeth them he.

> "My mother she sitteth the hill within,  
> And gold in the chest doth lay;  
> And I stole out for a little while,  
> Upon my gold harp to play."

> And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> He patted her cheek rosie:  
> "Why wilt thou not give a kinder reply:  
> Thou dearest of maidens, to me?"

> "I can give you no kinder reply;  
> I may not myself that allow;  
> I am betrothed to a hill-king,  
> And to him I must keep my vow."

> And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,  
> She at the hill-door looked out,  
> And there she saw how the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> Lay at the green linden's foot.

> And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,  
> She was vext and angry, God wot:  
> "What hast thou here in the grove to do?  
> Little business, I trow, thou hast got.

> "'Twere better for thee in the hill to be,  
> And gold in the chest to lay,  
> Than here to sit in the rosy grove, \[c\]  
> And on thy gold harp to play.

> "And 'twere better for thee in the hill to be,  
> And thy bride-dress finish sewing,  
> Than sit under the lind, and with runic lay  
> A Christian man's heart to thee win."

> And it was Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> She goeth in at the hill-door:  
> And after her goeth the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> Clothed in scarlet and fur.

> And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,  
> Forth a red-gold chair she drew:  
> Then she cast Sir Thynnè into a sleep  
> Until that the cock he crew.

> And it was Thora, the little Dwarf's wife,  
> The five rune-books she took out;  
> So she loosed him fully out of the runes,  
> Her daughter had bound him about.

> "And hear thou me, Sir Thynnè,  
> From the runes thou now art free;  
> This to thee I will soothly say,  
> My daughter shall never win thee.

> "And I was born of Christian kind,  
> And to the hill stolen in;  
> My sister dwelleth in Iseland, \[d\]  
> And wears a gold crown so fine.

> "And there she wears her crown of gold,  
> And beareth of queen the name;  
> Her daughter was stolen away from her,  
> Thereof there goeth great fame.

> "Her daughter was stolen away from her,  
> And to Berner-land brought in;  
> And there now dwelleth the maiden free,  
> She is called Lady Hermolin.

> "And never can she into the dance go,  
> But seven women follow her;  
> And never can she on the gold-harp play,  
> If the queen herself is not there.

> "The king he hath a sister's son,  
> He hopeth the crown to possess,  
> For him they intend the maiden free,  
> For her little happiness.

> "And this for my honour will I do  
> And out of good-will moreover,  
> To thee will I give the maiden free,  
> And part her from that lover."

> Then she gave unto him a dress so new,  
> With gold and pearls bedight;  
> Every seam on the dress it was  
> With precious stones all bright.

> Then she gave unto him a horse so good,  
> And therewith a new sell;  
> "And never shalt thou the way inquire,  
> Thy horse will find it well."

> And it was Diva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> She would show her good-wifi to the knight;  
> So she gave unto him a spear so new,  
> And therewith a good sword so bright.

> "And never shalt thou fight a fight,  
> Where thou shalt not the victory gain;  
> And never shalt thou sail on a sea  
> Where thou shalt not the land attain."

> And it was Thor; the little Dwarf's wife,  
> She wine in a glass for him poured:  
> "Ride away, ride away, now Sir Thynnè,  
> Before the return of my lord."

> And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> He rideth under the green hill side,  
> There then met him the hill-kings two,  
> As slow to the hill they ride.

> "Well met! Good day, now Sir Thynnè!  
> Thy horse can well with thee pace;  
> Whither directed is thy course?  
> Since thou 'it bound to a distant place."

> "Travel shall I and woo;  
> Plight me shall I a flower;  
> Try shall I my sword so good,  
> To my weal or my woe in the stour."

> "Ride in peace, ride in peace, away, Sir Thynnè,  
> From us thou hast nought to fear;  
> They are coming, the champions from Iseland,  
> Who with thee long to break a spear."

> And it was the knight Sir Thynnè,  
> He rideth under the green hill side;  
> There met him seven Bernisk champions,  
> They bid him to halt and abide.

> "And whether shall we fight to-day,  
> For the red gold and the silver;  
> Or shall we fight together to-day,  
> For both our true loves fair?"

> And it was the king's sister's son,  
> He was of mood so hasty;  
> "Of silver and gold I have enow,  
> If thou wilt credit me."

> "But hast thou not a fair true love,  
> Who is called Lady Hermolin?  
> For her it is we shall fight to-day,  
> If she shall be mine or thine."

> The first charge they together rode,  
> They were two champions so tall;  
> He cut at the king's sister's son,  
> That his head to the ground did fall.

> Back then rode the champions six,  
> And dressed themselves in fur;  
> Then went into the lofty hall,  
> The aged king before.

> And it was then the aged king,  
> He tore his gray hairs in woe.  
> "Ye must avenge my sister's son's death;  
> I will sables and martins bestow. ' \[e\]

> Back then rode the champions six,  
> They thought the reward to gain,  
> But they remained halt and limbless:  
> By loss one doth wit obtain.

> And he slew wolves and bears,  
> All before the high chamber;  
> Then taketh he out the maiden free  
> Who so long had languished there.

> And now hath Lady Hermolin  
> Escaped from all harm;  
> Now sleeps she sweet full many a sleep,  
> On brave Sir Thynnè's arm.

> And now has brave Sir Thynnè  
> Escaped all sorrow and tine;  
> Now sleeps he sweet full many a sleep,  
> Beside Lady Hermolin.

> Most thanketh he Ulva, the little Dwarf's daughter,  
> Who him with the runes had bound,  
> For were he not come inside of the bill,  
> The lady he never had found. \[f\]

> \[a\] We have ventured to omit the Omqued. *I styren väll de Runor!*
> (Manage well the runes!) The final *e* in Thynnè ia marked merely to
> indicate that it is to be sounded.  
>   
> \[b\] *Runeslag,* literally Rune-stroke. Runes originally signified
> letters, and then songs. They were of two kinds, Maalrunor
> *(Speech-runes),* and Trollrunor *(Magic-runes);* These last were
> again divided into Skaderunur *(Mischief-runes)* and Hjelprunor
> *(Help-runes),* of each of which there were five kinds. See Verelius'
> notes to the Hervarar Saga, cap. 7.

> The power of music over all nature is a subject of frequent recurrence
> in northern poetry. Here all the wild animals are entranced by the
> magic tones of the harp; the meads flower, the trees put forth leaves;
> the knight, though grave and silent, is attracted, and even if
> included to stay away, he cannot restrain his horse.  
>   
> \[c\] *Rosendelund.* The word *Lund* signifies any kind of grove,
> thicket, *&c.  
>   
> *\[d\] Not the island of Iceland, but a district in Norway of that
> name. By Berner-land, Geijer thinks is meant the land of Bern
> (Verona), the country of Dietrich, so celebrated in German romance.  
>   
> \[e\] *Sabel och Mård.* These furs are always mentioned In the
> northern ballads, as the royal rewards of distinguished actions.  
>   
> \[f\] This fine ancient Visa was taken down from recitation in West
> Gothland. The corresponding Danish one of Her Tönne is much later.
