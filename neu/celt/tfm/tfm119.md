THE FAIRY THIEVES

>   
>   
> A FARMER in Hampshire was sorely distressed by the unsettling of his
> barn. However straightly over-night he laid his sheaves on the
> threshing-floor for the application of the morning's flail, when
> morning came, all was topsy-turvy, higgledy-piggledy, though the door
> remained locked, and there was no sign whatever of irregular entry.
> Resolved to find out who played him these mischievous pranks, Hodge
> couched himself one night deeply among the sheaves, and watched for
> the enemy. At length midnight arrived, the barn was illuminated as if
> by moonbeams of wonderful brightness, and through the key-hole came
> thousands of elves, the most diminutive that could be imagined. The
> immediately began their gambols among the straw, which was soon in a
> most admired disorder. Hodge wondered, but interfered not; but at last
> the supernatural thieves began to busy themselves in a way still less
> to his taste, for each elf set about conveying the crop away, a straw
> at a time, with astonishing activity and perseverance. The key-hole
> was still their port of egress and regress, and it resembled the
> aperture of a bee-hive, on a sunny day in June. The farmer was rather
> annoyed at seeing his grain vanish in this fashion, when one of the
> fairies said to another in the tiniest voice that ever was heard--" *I
> weat, you weat?* Hodge could contain himself no longer. He leaped out
> crying, "The devil sweat ye. Let me get among ye!" when they all flew
> away so frightened that they never disturbed the barn any more.

> In Suffolk the fairies are called *farisees*. Not many years ago, a
> butcher near Woodbridge went to a farmer's to buy a calf; and finding,
> as he expressed it, that "the cratur was all o' a muck," he desired
> the farmer to hang a flint by a string in the crib, so as to be just
> clear of the calf's head. "Becaze," said he, "the calf is rid every
> night by the *farisees,* and the stone will brush them off" \[a\]

>  

> We once questioned a girl from Norfolk on the subject of Fairy-lore.
> She said she had often heard of and even seen the *Frairies.* They
> were dressed in white, and lived under the ground, where they
> constructed houses, bridges, and other edifices. It is not safe, she
> added, to go near them when they appear above ground.

>  

> We now proceed to Yorkshire, where the Boggart and the Barguest used
> to appear in by-gone days. The former, whose name we will presently
> explain, is the same as the Brownie or Kobold; the latter, whose
> proper name perhaps is Barn-ghaist, or Barn-spirit, keeps without, and
> usually takes the form of some domestic animal.
