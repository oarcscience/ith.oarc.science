<BLOCKQUOTE>WRITTEN AT BATH IN 1840, FOR A LITTLE BOY WHO KEPT AN ALBUM, AND WAS A GREAT ADMIRER OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRY<I> </I>MEN.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
HAD the kind Muse, young friend, on me <BR>
Her pleasing gifts bestowed,<BR>
And taught to tread of poesy<BR>
The smooth and flowery road;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Then should the deeds of Robin Hood,<BR>
And Little John, so bold,<BR>
And of the Friar, stout and good,<BR>
In numbers high be told.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The merry greenwood should resound<BR>
With feats of archery,<BR>
And antlered deer along should bound<BR>
So light and gracefully!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But vain the hopes: 'gainst Fate's decrees <BR>
To struggle I must cease;<BR>
I only can write histories<BR>
Of England, Rome, and Greece.</BLOCKQUOTE>
