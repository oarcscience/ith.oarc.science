<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THESE verses are adapted to the well-known air. They were suggested by a passage from Rousseau's works, quoted by Alison in his Essay on Taste. Though real names are mentioned, the scenery and subject are purely ideal.</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Calmly at eve shone the sun o'er Lake Leman,<BR>
Bright in his beam lay the watery expanse,<BR>
Softly the white sails reflected his gleaming,<BR>
Groves, banks, and trees their slow shadows advance.<BR>
Cool from the mountains the summer-gale breathed,<BR>
Laden with fragrance the lake it came o'er;<BR>
Leman, exulting, danced joyous beneath it,<BR>
Light crisped waves gently roll to the shore.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At that soft hour on the blue Leman rowing,<BR>
Slowly a sage urged his bark by a grove,<BR>
Silently musing, his lofty mind glowing,<BR>
Viewing earths pomp and the glories above<BR>
As o'er the lake the long shadows extended,<BR>
Whispering the breeze, lulled each sense to repose;<BR>
Calm he reclined, and as slumber descended,<BR>
Visions of bliss to his fancy arose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Heaven to his view seemed arrayed in new glory,<BR>
Earth breathed forth fragrance and basked in the ray<BR>
Clad in loose raiment, more white than the hoary<BR>
Front of Mont Blanc, came a son of the day.<BR>
Lightly his wand o'er the slumberer extending,<BR>
While with new joy laughed the earth, sky, and lake;<BR>
Love in his accents with soft pity blending,<BR>
Shedding content, thus the bright vision spake:--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Hither I come, from ray cloud-crowned station,<BR>
Touched with thy grief; to shed balm o'er thy mind<SUP> </SUP>'<BR>
I am the Spirit to whom, at creation,<BR>
Charge was by Heaven o'er this region assigned.<BR>
List to my accents, thou hunted by malice!<BR>
Let what I utter sink deep in thy breast:<BR>
Fly from mankind, to the lakes, hills, and valleys,<BR>
Thus, thus alone, shall thy spirit find rest.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"But if again to the world thou now fliest,<BR>
Thou should return, and again meet thy foes,<BR>
Think on this hour, when for comfort thou sighest,<BR>
And the bright scene will dispel all thy woes."<BR>
Gone was the vision: eve's star now was glancing,<BR>
Cold came the breeze o'er the blue curling stream;<BR>
Waked from his slumber, his heart with joy dancing,<BR>
Homeward he turned, and still mused on his dream.</BLOCKQUOTE>
