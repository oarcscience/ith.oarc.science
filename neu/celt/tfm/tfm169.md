> UNDER the title of Southern Europe, we comprise Greece and those
> nations whose languages are derived from the Latin; Italy, Spain, and
> France. Of the Fairy-system, if there ever was one, of Portugal we
> have met with nothing, at least in the works of Camoens, Bernardes,
> and Lobo.

> The reader will, in this part of our work, find little corresponding
> to the Gothic Dwarfs who have hitherto been our companions. The only
> one of our former acquaintances that will attend us is honest
> Hob-goblin, Brownie, Kobold, Nis, or however else he may style
> himself. And it is very remarkable that we shall meet with him only in
> those places where the Northmen, the Visigoths or other Scandinavian
> tribes settled. Whence perhaps it might be concluded that they brought
> him with them to the South of Europe.
