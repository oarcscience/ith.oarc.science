THE ALFAR

> Ther ro meth Alfum.

> Brynhildar Quida.

> (Those are with the Alfs.)

>  

> IN the prose Edda, Ganglar inquires what other cities beside that in
> which the Nornir dwelt were by the Urdar fount, under the Ash
> Yggdrasil. \[a\] Hár replies,

> "There are many fair cities there. There is the city which is called
> Alf-heim, where dwelleth the people that is called Liosálfar (*Light
> Alfs*)*.* But the Döckálfar *(Dark Alfs*) dwell below under ground,
> and are unlike them in appearance, and still more unlike in actions.
> The Liosálfar are whiter than the sun in appearance, but the Döckálfar
> are blacker than pitch." \[b\]

> The Nornir, the Parcae, or Destinies of Scandinavian mythology, are
> closely connected with the Alfar.

> "Many fair cities are there in Heaven," says Hár, "and the divine
> protection is over all. There standeth a city under the ash near the
> spring, and out of its halls came three maids, who are thus named,
> Udr, Verthandi, Skulld *(Past, Present, Future).* These maids shape
> the life of man. We call them Nornir. But there are many Nornir; those
> who come to each child that is born, to shape its life, are of the
> race of the gods; but others are of the race of the Alfs; and the
> third of the race of dwarfs. As is here expressed,

> Sundry children deen I  
> The Nornir to be--the same  
> Race they have not  
> Some are of Aeser-kin,  
> Some are of Alf-kin,  
> Some are the daughters of DuaIin" (*i.e*. of the Dwarfs.)

> "Then," said Ganglar, "if the Nornir direct the future destiny of men,
> they shape it very unequally. Some have a good life and rich, but some
> have little wealth and praise, some long life, some short." "The good
> Nornir, and well descended," sags Hár, "shape a good life; but as to
> those who meet with misfortune, it is caused by the malignant Nornir."

> These Nornir bear a remarkable resemblance to the classical Parcae and
> to the fairies of romance. They are all alike represented as assisting
> at the birth of eminent personages, as bestowing gifts either good or
> evil, and as foretelling the future fortune of the being that has just
> entered on existence. \[c\] This attribute of the fairies may have
> been derived from either the north or the south, but certainly these
> did not borrow from each other.

> Of the origin of the word Alf nothing satisfactory is to be found.
> Some think it is akin to the Latin *albus,* white; others, to *alpes,*
> Alps, mountains. There is also supposed to be some mysterious
> connexion between it and the word Elf or Elv, signifying water in the
> northern languages; an analogy which has been thought to correspond
> with that between the Latin Nympha and Lympha. Both relations,
> however, are perhaps rather fanciful than just. Of the derivation of
> Alf; as just observed, we know nothing certain, \[d\] and the original
> meaning of Nympha would appear to be a new-married woman, \[e\] and
> thence a marriageable young woman; and it. was applied to the supposed
> inhabitants of the mountains, seas, and streams, on the same principle
> that the northern nations gave them the appellation of men and women,
> that is, from their imagined resemblance to the human form.

> Whatever its origin, the word Alf has continued till the present day
> in all the Teutonic languages. The Danes have *Elv,* pl. *Elve;* the
> Swedes, *Elf* pl. *Elfvar* m. *Elfvor* f.; and the words *Elf-dans*
> and *Elf-blaest,* together with *Olof* and other proper names, are
> derived from them. The Germans call the nightmare *Alp*; and in their
> old poems we meet with *Elbe* and *Elbinne,* and *Elbisch* occurs in
> them in the bad sense of *elvish* of Chaucer and our old romancers;
> and a number of proper names, such as Alprecht, Alphart, Alpinc,
> Alpwin \[f\] were formed from it, undoubtedly before it got its
> present ill sense. \[g\] In the Anglo-Saxon, Aelp or Aelpen, with its
> feminine and plural, frequently occurs. The Oreas, Naias, and
> Hamodryas of the Greeks and Romans are rendered in an Anglo-Saxon
> glossary by Munt-alpen, *rae*-aelpen, and *pelb*-aelpen \[h\] Aelp is
> a component part of the proper names Aelfred and Aelfric; and the
> author of the poem of Judith says that his heroine was Aelp-rcine
> *(Elf-sheen),* bright or fair as an elf. But of the character and acts
> of the elfs no traditions have been preserved in Anglo-Saxon
> literature. In the English language, Elf; Elves, and their derivatives
> are to be found in every period, from its first formation down to this
> present time.
