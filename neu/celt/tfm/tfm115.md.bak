THE CAULD LAD OF HILTON

>   
>   
> "HILTON HALL, in the vale of the Wear, was in former times the resort
> of a Brownie or House-spirit called The Cauld Lad. Every night the
> servants who slept in the great hall heard him at work in the kitchen,
> knocking the things about if they had been set in order, arranging
> them if otherwise, which was more frequently the case. They were
> resolved to banish him if they could, and the spirit, who seemed to
> have an inkling of their design, was often heard singing in a
> melancholy tone:

> Was 'a me! was 's me!  
> The acorn is not yet  
> Fallen from the tree,  
> That's to grow the wood,  
> That's to make the cradle,  
> That's to rock the bairn,  
> That's to grow to a man,  
> That's to lay me.

> The servants, however, resorted to the usual mode of banishing a
> Brownie: they left a green cloke and hood fbr hini by the kitchen
> fire, and remained on the watch. They saw him come in, gaze at the new
> clothes, try them on, and, apparently in great delight, go jumping and
> frisking about the kitchen. But at the first crow of the cock he
> vanished, crying--

> Hero 'a a cloak, and here's a hood!  
> The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good;

> and he never again returned to the kitchen; yet it was said that he
> might still be heard at midnight singing those lines in a tone of
> melancholy.

> There was a room in the castle long called the Cauld Lad's Room, which
> was never occupied unless the castle was full of company, and within
> the last century many persons of credit had heard of the midnight
> wailing of the Cauld Lad, who some maintained was the spirit of a
> servant whom one of the barons of Hilton had killed unintentionally in
> a fit of passion." \[a\]

>  

>  

> In the beginning of the last century Bourne thus gives the popular
> belief on this subject:

> "Another part of this (winter's evening) conversation generally turns
> upon Fairies. These, they tell you, have frequently been seen and
> heard; nay, that there are some still living who were stolen away by
> them, and confined seven years. According to the description they give
> of them, who pretend to have seen them, they are in the shape of men
> exceeding little: they are always clad in green, and frequent the
> woods and fields. When they make cakes (which is a work they have been
> often heard at), they are very noisy; and when they have done, they
> are full of mirth and pastime. But generally they dance in moonlight,
> when mortals are asleep, and not capable of seeing them; as may be
> observed on the following morning, their dancing places being very
> distinguishable: for as they dance hand in hand, and so make a circle
> in their dance, so next day there will be seen rings and circles on
> the grass." \[b\]

> The author of "Round about our Coalflre" says \[c\]:

> "My grandmother has often told me of Fairies dancing upon our green,
> and they were
>
> little little creatures, clothed in green.

> "The moment any one saw them, and took notice of them, they were
> struck blind of an eye. They lived under ground, and generally came
> out of a mole-hill.

> "They had fine music always among themselves, and danced in a
> moonshiny night around, or in a ring, as one may see at this day upon
> every common in England, where mushrooms grow.

> "When the master and mistress were laid on their pillows, the men and
> maids, if they had a game at romp, and blundered upstairs, or jumbled
> a chair, the next morning every one would swear it was the fairies,
> and that they heard them stamping up and down stairs all night, crying
> 'Water 's locked! Water 's locked!' when there was not water in every
> pail in the kitchen."

> To come to the present times. There is no stronger proof of the
> neglect of what Mr Thoms has very happily designated "Folk-lore" in
> this country, than the fact of there having been no account given
> anywhere of the Pixies or Pisgies \[d\] of Devonshire and Cornwall,
> till within these last few years. In the year 1836, Mrs. Bray, a lady
> well known as the author of several novels, and wife of a clergyman at
> Tavistock, published, in a series of letters to Robert Southey,
> interesting descriptions of the part of Devonshire bordering on the
> Tamar and the Tavy. In this work there is given an account of the
> Pixies, from which we derive the following information:

> According to the Devon peasant, the Pixies are the souls of infants
> who died before they were baptised. They are of small dimensions,
> generally handsome in their form. Their attire is always green.
> Dancing is their chief amusement, which they perform to the music of
> the cricket, the grasshopper, and the frog,--always at night; and thus
> they form the fairy-rings. The Pixy-house is usually in a rock. By
> moon-light, on the moor, or under the dark shade of rocks, the
> Pixy-monarch, Mrs. Bray says, holds his court, where, like Titania, he
> gives his subjects their several charges. Some are sent to the mines,
> where they will kindly lead the miner to the richest lode, or
> maliciously, by noises imitating the stroke of the hammer, and by
> false fires, draw him on to where the worst ore in the mine lies, and
> then laugh at his disappointment. Others are sent

> To make the maids their sluttery rue,  
> By pinching them both black and blue.

> On this account, says Mrs. Bray, "the good dames in this part of the
> world are very particular in sweeping their houses before they go to
> bed; and they will frequently place a basin of water beside the
> chimney-nook, to accommodate the Pixies, who are great lovers of
> water; and sometimes they requite the good deed by dropping a piece of
> money into the basin. A young woman of our town, who declared she had
> received the reward of sixpence for a like service, told the
> circumstance to her gossips; but no six-pence ever came again, and it
> was generally believed that the Pixies had taken offence by her
> chattering, as they do not like to have their deeds, good or evil,
> talked over by mortal tongues."

> The office of some is to steal children; of others, to lead travellers
> astray, as Will-o'-the-wisps, or to *Pizxy-lead* them, as it is
> termed. Some will make confusion in a house by blowing out the candle,
> or kissing the maids "with a smack, as they 'shriek Who 'a this?' as
> the old poet writes, till their grandams come in and lecture them for
> allowing unseemly freedoms with their bachelors." Others will make
> noises in walls, to frighten people. In short, everything that is done
> elsewhere by fairies, boggarts, or other like beings, is done in Devon
> by the Pixies.

> It is said that they will sometimes aid their favourites in spinning
> their flax. "I have heard a story about an old woman in this town,"
> says Mrs. Bray, "who suspected she received assistance of the above
> nature; and one evening, coming suddenly into the room, she spied a
> ragged little creature, who jumped out of the door. She thought she
> would try still further to win the services of her elfin friend, and
> so bought some smart new clothes, as big as those made for a doll.
> These pretty things she placed by the side of her wheel. The Pixy
> returned, and put them on; when, clapping her tiny hands, she was
> heard to exclaim--

> Pixy fine, Pixy gay,  
> Pixy now will run away;

> and off she went. But the ungrateful little creature never spun for
> the poor old woman after."

> Mrs. Bray has been assured that mothers used frequently to pin their
> children to their sides, to prevent their being stolen by the Pixies;
> and she heard of a woman in Tavistock who avowed that her mother had a
> child which was stolen by them, as she was engaged banging out clothes
> to dry in her garden. She almost broke her heart when she discovered
> it; but she took great care of the changeling, which so pleased the
> Pixy, that she soon after gave the woman back her child, who proved
> eminently lucky in after life.

> The being *Pixy-led* is a thing very apt to befall worthy yeomen
> returning at night from fair or market, especially if they sat long at
> the market-table; and then, says our authority, "he will declare, and
> offer to take his Bible-oath upon it, that, as sure as ever he 'a
> alive to tell it, whilst his head was running round like a mill-wheel,
> be heard with his own ears they bits of Pisgies a-laughing and
> *a-tacking* their hands, all to see he led-astray, and never able to
> find the right road, though he had travelled it scores of times long
> agone, by night or by day, as a body might tell." Mr. Thoms, too, was
> told by a Devon girl, who had often beard of the Pixies, though she
> had never seen any, that "she once knew a man who, one night, could
> not find his way out of his own fields, all he could do, until he
> recollected to *turn his coat;* and, the moment he did so, he heard
> the Pixies all fly away, up into the trees, and there they sat and
> laughed. Oh! how they did laugh! But the man then soon found his way
> out of the field."

> This turning of the coat, or some other article of dress, is found to
> be the surest remedy against Pixy-illusion. Mrs. Bray says that the
> old folk in Tavistock have recourse to it as a preventive against
> being *Pixy-led,* if they have occasion to go out after sun-down. It
> appears to have been formerly in use in other parts of England also;
> for Bishop Corbet thus notices it in his "Iter Boreale:
>
> "

> William found  
> A mean for our deliverance, *Turne your cloakes  
> *Quoth hee, for Puoke is busy in these oakes;  
> If ever wee at Bosworth will be found  
> Then *turne your cloake,* for this is fairy ground.

> In Scandinavia, also, we learn the remedy against being led astray by
> the Lygtemand, Lyktgubhe, or Will-o'-the-Wisp, is to turn one's cap
> inside out.

> Mrs. Bray gives, in addition, the following-legends, which we have
> taken the liberty of abridging a little.
