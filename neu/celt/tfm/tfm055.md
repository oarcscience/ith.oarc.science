NECKS, MERMEN AND MERMAIDS

>  

> El Necken mer i flodens vågor quäder,  
> Och ingen Hafsfru bleker sina kläder  
> Pas böljans rygg i milda solars glans.  
> STAGNELIUS.

> The Neck no more upon the river sings,  
> And no Mermaid to bleach her linen flings  
> Upon the waves in the mild solar ray.

>   
> IT is a prevalent opinion in the North that all the various beings of
> the popular creed were once worsted in a conflict with superior
> powers, and condemned to remain till doomsday in certain assigned
> abodes. The Dwarfs, or Hill *(Berg)* trolls, were appointed the hills;
> the Elves the groves and leafy trees; the Hill-people *(Högfolk*
> \[a\]*)* the caves and caverns; the Mermen, Mermaids, and Necks, the
> sea, lakes, and rivers; the River-man *(Strömkarl)* the small
> waterfalls. Both the Catholic and Protestant clergy have endeavoured
> to excite an aversion to these beings, but in vain. They are regarded
> as possessing considerable power over man and nature, and it is
> believed that though now unhappy, they will be eventually saved, or
> *faa förlossning* (get salvation), as it is expressed.

> The NECK (in Danish Nökke \[b\]) is the river-spirit. The ideas
> respecting him are various. Sometimes he is represented as sitting, of
> summer nights, on the surface of the water, like a pretty little boy,
> with golden hair hanging in ringlets, and a red cap on his head;
> sometimes as above the water, like a handsome young man, but beneath
> like a horse; \[c\] at other times, as an old man with a long beard,
> out of which he wrings the water as he sits on the cliffs. In this
> last form, Odin, according to the Icelandic sagas, has sometimes
> revealed himself.

> The Neck is very severe against any haughty maiden who makes an ill
> return to the love of her wooer; but should he himself fall in love
> with a maid of human kind, he is the most polite and attentive suitor
> in the world.

> Though he is thus severe only against those who deserve it, yet
> country people when they are upon the water use certain precautions
> against his power. Metals, particularly steel, are believed *"to bind
> the Neck," (binda Necken);* and when going on the open sea, they
> usually put a knife in the bottom of the boat, or set a nail in a
> reed. In Norway the following charm is considered effectual against
> the Neck:--

> Nyk, nyk, naal i vatn!  
> Jomfru Maria kastet staal i vatn  
> Du sök, äk flyt!

> Neck, neck, nail in water!  
> The virgin Mary casteth steel in water!  
> Do you sink, I flit!

> The Neck is a great musician. He sits on the water and plays on his
> gold harp, the harmony of which operates on all nature. To learn music
> of him, a person must present him with a black lamb, and also promise
> him resurrection and redemption.

> The following story is told in all parts of Sweden:-

> "Two boys were one time playing near a river that ran by their
> father's house. The Neck rose and sat on the surface of the water, and
> played on his harp; but one of the children said to him, 'What is the
> use, Neck, of your sitting there and playing? you will never be
> saved.' The Neck then began to weep bitterly, flung away his harp, and
> sank down to the bottom. The children went home, and told the whole
> story to their father, who was the parish priest. He said they were
> wrong to say so to the Neck, and desired them to go immediately back
> to the river, and console him with the promise of salvation. They did
> so; and when they came down to the river the Neck was sitting on the
> water, weeping and lamenting. They then said to him, 'Neck, do not
> grieve so; our father says that your Redeemer liveth also.' The Neck
> then took his harp and played most sweetly, until long after the sun
> was gone down."

> This legend is also found in Denmark, but in a less agreeable form. A
> clergyman, it is said, was journeying one night to Roeskilde in
> Zealand. His way led by a hill in which there was music and dancing
> and great merriment going forward. Some dwarfs jumped suddenly out of
> it, stopped the carriage, and asked him whither he was going. He
> replied to the synod of the church. They asked him if he thought they
> could be saved. To that, he replied, he could not give an immediate
> answer. They then begged that he would give them a reply by next year.
> When he next passed, and they made the same demand, be replied, "No,
> you are all damned." Scarcely had be spoken the word, when the whole
> hill appeared in flames.

> In another form of this legend, a priest says to the Neck, "Sooner
> will this cane which I hold in my hand grow green flowers than thou
> shalt attain salvation." The Neck in grief flung away his harp and
> wept, and the priest rode on. But soon his cane began to put forth
> leaves and blossoms, and he then went back to communicate the glad
> tidings to the Neck who now joyously played on all the entire night.

> \[a\] *Berg* signifies a larger eminence, mountain, hill; *Hög,* a
> height, hillock. The *Hög-folk* are Elves and musicians.

> \[b\] The Danish peasantry in Wormius' time described the Nökke
> (Nikke) as a monster with a human head, that dwells both in fresh and
> salt water. When any one was drowned, they said, *Nökken tog ham bort*
> (the Nökke took him away); and when any drowned person was found with
> the nose red, they said the Nikke has sucked him: *Nikken har suet
> ham*.--Magnusen, Eddalaere. Denmark being a country without any
> streams of magnitude, we meet in the Danske Folkesagn no legends of
> the Nökke; and in ballads, such as a The Power of the Harp," what in
> Sweden is ascribed to the Neck, is in Denmark imputed to the Havmand
> or Merman.

> \[c\] The Neck is also believed to appear in the form of a complete
> horse, and can be made to work at the plough, if a bridle of a
> particular description be employed.--*Kalm's*
