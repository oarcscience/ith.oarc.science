ORIGIN OF THE HOUSE OF HARO

>  

> As Don Diego Lopez, lord of Biscay, was one day lying in wait for the
> wild boar, he heard the voice of a woman who was singing. On looking
> around, he beheld on the summit of a rock a damsel, exceedingly
> beautiful, and richly attired. Smitten with her charms, he proffered
> her his hand. In reply, she assured him that she was of high descent,
> but frankly accepted his proffered hand; making, however, one
> condition--he was never to pronounce a holy name. Tradition says that
> the fair bride had only one defect, which was, that one of her feet
> was like that of a goat. Diego Lopez, however, loved her well, and she
> bore him two children, a daughter, and a son named Iniguez Guerra.

> Now it happened one day, as they were sitting at dinner, that the lord
> of Biscay threw a bone to the dogs, and a mastiff and a spaniel
> quarrelled about it, and the spaniel griped the mastiff by the throat,
> and throttled him. "Holy Mary!" exclaimed Don Diego, "who ever saw the
> like?" Instantly the lady caught hold of the hands of her children;
> Diego seized and held the boy, but the mother glided through the air
> with the daughter, and sought again the mountains whence she had come.
> Diego remained alone with his son; and some years after, when he
> invaded the lands of the Moors, he was made captive by them, and led
> to Toledo. Iniguez Guerra, who was now grown up, was greatly grieved
> at the captivity of his father, and the men of the land told him that
> his only hope was to find his mother, and obtain her aid. Iniguez made
> no delay; he rode alone to the well-known mountains, and when he
> reached them, behold! his fairy-mother stood there before him on the
> summit of a rock. "Come unto me," said she, "for well do I know thy
> errand." And she called to her Pardalo, the horse that ran without a
> rider in the mountains, and she put a bridle into his mouth, and bade
> Iniguez mount him, and told him that he must not

> give him either food or water, or unsaddle or unbridle him, or put
> shoes upon his feet, and that in one day the demon. steed would carry
> him to Toledo. And Iniguez obeyed the injunctions of Ins mother, and
> succeeded in liberating his father; but his mother never returned.

> In the large collection of Spanish ballads named El Romancero
> Castellano, the only one that treats of fairy-lore is the following,
> which tells of the enchantment of the King of Castille's daughter by
> seven fairies, \[b\] for a period of seven years. It is of the same
> character as the fairy-tales of France and Italy.
