ISLE OF MAN

>   
> Mona once hid from those that search the main,  
> Where thousand elfin shapes abide.  
> COLLINS.

> THE Isle of Man, peopled by Celts, and early and frequently visited
> and colonised by the Northmen, has also its Fairies, which differ
> little from those of the greater islands between which it lies. An
> English gentleman, named Waldron, who resided in the island in the
> early part of the last century, was curious about its Fairy-lore, and
> he has recorded a number of the legends which he heard. \[a\] His
> book, indeed, has been the chief source whence Ritson, Sir Walter
> Scott, \[b\] and others, have drawn their illustrations of English
> Fairy-lore in general, and the subsequent inquiries of Mr. Train have
> enabled him to add but very little to it. We will here relate some of
> these legends:

> The great peculiarity of the Manks Fairies, according to Mr. Waldron,
> is their fondness for riding, and this not on little steeds of their
> own, or on the small breed of the country, but on the large English
> and Irish horses, which are brought over and kept by the gentry.
> Nothing, it was said, was more common than to find in the morning
> horses covered with foam and sweat, and tired to death, which had been
> shut up at night in the stable. One gentleman assured Mr. Waldron that
> three or four of his best horses had been killed with these nocturnal
> exercises.

> They called them the Good People, and said that their reason for
> dwelling in the hills and woods was, their dislike of the vices of
> towns. Hence the houses which they deigned to visit were thought to be
> blest. In these houses, a tub or pail of clean water was always left
> for them to bathe in. Good, however, as they were, they used to change
> children. Mr. Waldron saw one of these changelings; it was nearly six
> years old, but was unable to walk or even stand, or move its limbs.
> Its complexion was delicate, and it had the finest hair in the world.
> It never cried or spoke, and it ate scarcely anything; it rarely
> smiled, but if any one called it *Fairy-elf,* it would frown and
> almost look them through. Its mother, who was poor, was often obliged
> to go out for whole days a-charing, and leave it by itself, and when
> the neighbours would look in on it through the window, they always saw
> it laughing and in great delight, whence they judged that it had
> agreeable company with it, more especially as let it be left ever so
> dirty, the mother on her return found it with a clean face, and its
> hair nicely combed out.
