THE PENITENT NIS

 

> IT is related of a Nis, who had established himself in a house in
> Jutland, that he used every evening, after the maid was gone to bed,
> to go into the kitchen to take his groute, which they used to leave
> for him in a wooden bowl.

> One evening he sat down as usual to eat his supper with a good
> appetite, drew over the bowl to him, and was just beginning, as he
> thought, to make a comfortable meal, when he found that the maid had
> forgotten to put any butter into it for him. At this he fell into a
> furious rage, got up in the height of his passion, and went out into
> the cow-house, and twisted the neck of the best cow that was in it.
> But as he felt himself still very hungry, he stole back again to the
> kitchen to take some of the groute, such as it was, and when he had
> eaten a little of it be perceived that there was butter in it, but
> that it had sunk to the bottom under the groute. He was now so vexed
> at his injustice toward the maid, that, to make good the damage he had
> done, he went back to the cow-house and set a chest full of money by
> the side of the dead cow, where the family found it next morning, and
> by means of it got into flourishing circumstances.
