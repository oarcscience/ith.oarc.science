GERTRUDE AND ROSY

>  

> GERTRUDE.  
> QUICK, daughter, quick! spin off what's on your rock.  
> 'Tis Saturday night, and with the week you know  
> Our work must end; we shall the more enjoy  
> To-morrow's rest when all 's done out of hand. \[a\]  
> Quick, daughter, quick! spin off what 's on your rock.

> ROSY.  
> True, mother, but every minute sleep  
> Falls on my eyes as heavy as lead, and I  
> Must yawn do what I will; and then God knows  
> I can't help nodding though 'twere for my life;  
> Or ... oh! it might be of some use if you  
> Would once more, dearest mother, tell about  
> The wonderful, good-natured little Dwarfs,  
> What they here round the country used to do,  
> And how they showed their kindness to the hinds.

> GERTRUDE.  
> See now! what industry!--your work itself  
> Should keep you waking. I have told you o'er  
> A thousand times the stories, and we lose,  
> If you grow wearied of them, store of joy  
> Reserved for winter-nights; besides, methinks,  
> The evening 's now too short for chat like this.

> ROSY.  
> There 's only one thing I desire to hear  
> Again, and. sure, dear mother, never yet  
> Have you explained how 'twas the little men  
> Lived in the hills, and how, all through the year,  
> They sported round the country here, and gave  
> Marks of their kindness. For you 'll ne'er persuade  
> Me to believe that barely, one by one,  
> They wandered in the valleys, and appeared  
> Unto the people, and bestowed their gifts:  
> So, come now, tell at once, how 'twas the Dwarfs  
> Lived all together in society.

> GERTRUDE.  
> 'Tis plain, however, of itself, and well  
> Wise folks can see, that such an active race  
> Would never with their hands before them sit.  
> Ah! a right merry lively thing, and full  
> Of roguish tricks, the little Hill-man is,  
> And quickly too he gets into a rage,  
> If you behave not toward him mannerly,  
> And be not frank and delicate in your acts.  
> But, above all things, they delight to dwell,  
> Quiet and peaceful, in the secret clefts  
> Of hills and mountains, evermore concealed.  
> All through the winter, when with icy rind  
> The frost doth cover o'er the earth, the wise  
> And prudent little people keep them warm  
> By their fine fires, many a fathom down  
> Within the inmost rocks. Pure native gold,  
> And the rock-crystals shaped like towers, clear,  
> Transparent, gleam with colours thousandfold  
> Through the fair palace, and the Little-folk,  
> So happy and so gay, amuse themselves  
> Sometimes with singing--Oh, so sweet! 'twould charm  
> The heart of any one who heard it sound.  
> Sometimes with dancing, when they jump and spring  
> Like the young skipping kids in the Alp-grass.  
> Then when the spring is come, and in the fields  
> The flowers are blooming, with sweet May's approach,  
> They bolts and bars take from their doors and gates,  
> That early ere the hind or hunter stirs,  
> In the cool morning, they may sport and play;  
> Or ramble in the evening, when the moon  
> Lights up the plains. Seldom hath mortal man  
> Beheld them with his eyes; but should one chance  
> To see them, it betokens suffering  
> And a bad year, if bent in woe they glide  
> Through woods and thickets; but the sight proclaims  
> Joy and good luck, when social, in a ring,  
> On the green meads and fields, their hair adorned  
> With flowers, they shout and whirl their merry rounds.  
> Abundance then they joyously announce  
> For barn, for cellar, and for granary,  
> And a blest year to men, to herds, and game.  
> Thus they do constantly foreshow what will  
> Befall to-morrow and hereafter; now  
> Sighing, and still, by their lamenting tones,  
> A furious tempest; and again, with sweet  
> And smiling lips, and shouting, clear bright skies. \[b\]  
> Chief to the poor and good, they love to show  
> Kindness and favour, often bringing home  
> At night the straying lambs, and oftener still  
> In springtime nicely spreading, in the wood,  
> Brushwood, in noble bundles, in the way  
> Of needy children gone to fetch home fuel.  
> Many a good little girl, who well obeyed  
> Her mother,--or, mayhap, a little boy,--  
> Has, with surprise, found lying on the hills  
> Bright dazzling bowls of milk, and baskets too,  
> Nice little baskets, full of berries, left  
> By the kind hands of the wood-roaming Dwarfs.  
> Now be attentive while I tell you one  
> Out of a hundred and a hundred stories;  
> 'Tis one, however, that concerns us more  
> Than all the rest, because it was my own  
> Great-great-grandfather that the thing befell,  
> In the old time, in years long since agone.  
> Where from the lofty rocks the boundary runs  
> Down to the vale, Barthel, of herdsmen first  
> In all the country round, was ploughing up  
> A spacious field, where he designed to try  
> The seed of corn; but with anxiety  
> His heart was filled, lest by any chance  
> His venture should miscarry, for his sheep  
> In the contagion he had lost, now poor  
> And without skill, he ventures on the plough.  
> Deliberate and still, at the plough-tail,  
> In furrows he cuts up the grassy soil,  
> While with the goad his little boy drives on  
> The panting ox. When, lo! along the tall  
> Rocky hill-side, a smoke ascends in clouds  
> Like snow-flakes, soaring from the summit up  
> Into the sky. At this the hungry boy  
> Began to think of food, for the poor child  
> Had tasted nothing all the live-long day  
> For lunch, and, looking up, he thus began:  
> "Ah! there the little Dwarf-folk are so gay  
> At their grand cooking, roasting, boiling now,  
> For a fine banquet, while with hunger I  
> Am dying. Had we here one little dish  
> Of the nice savoury food, were it but as  
> A sign that there 's a blessing on our work!"  
> 'Twas thus the boy spake, and his father ploughed  
> Silently on, bent forwards o'er his work.  
> They turn the plough; when huzza! lo! behold  
> A miracle! there gleamed right from the midst  
> Of the dark furrow, toward them, a bright  
> Lustre, and there so charming! lay a plate  
> Heaped up with roast meat; by the plate, a loaf  
> Of bread upon the outspread table-cloth,  
> At the disposal of the honest pair.  
> Hurra! long live the friendly, generous Dwarfs!  
> Barthel had now enough--so had the boy--  
> And laughing gratefully and loud, they praise  
> And thank the givers; then, with strength restored,  
> They quick return unto their idle plough.  
> But when again their day's task they resume,  
> To break more of the field, encouraged now  
> To hope for a good crop, since the kind Dwarfs  
> Had given them the sign of luck they asked--  
> Hush! bread and plate, and crums, and knife and fork,  
> Were vanished clean; only--just for a sign  
> For ever of the truth--lay on the ridge  
> The white, nice-woven, pretty table-cloth.

> ROSY.  
> O mother! mother! what? the glittering plate  
> And real? and the cloth with their own hands  
> Spun by the generous Dwarfs? No, I can ne'er  
> Believe it!--Was the thread then, real drawn  
> And. twisted thread, set in it evenly?  
> And was there too a flower, a pretty figure,  
> Nicely wrought in with warp and crossing woof?  
> Did there a handsome border go all round,  
> Enclosing all the figures?--Sure your great-  
> Great-grandfather, if really he was  
> The owner of the curious little cloth,  
> He would have left it carefully unto  
> His son and grandson for a legacy,  
> That, for a lasting witness of the meal  
> Given by the Dwarfs, it might to distant years,  
> The praise and wonder of our vale remain.

> GERTRUDE.  
> Odds me! how wise the child is! what a loss  
> And pity 'tis that in old times the folk  
> Were not so thoughtful and so over-knowing!  
> Ah! our poor simple fathers should rise up  
> Out of their graves, and come to get advice  
> And comfort from the brooders that are now,--  
> As if they knew not what was right and fit!  
> Have but a little patience, girl, and spin  
> What's on your rock; to-morrow when 'tis day  
> I'll let you see the Dwarfs' flowered table-cloth,  
> Which, in the chest laid safe, inherited  
> From mother down to daughter, I have, long  
> Kept treasured under lock and key, for fear  
> Some little girl, like some one that you know,  
> Might out of curiosity, and not  
> Acquainted with its worth, set it astray.

> ROSY.

> Ah, that is kind, dear mother; and see now  
> How broad awake I am, and how so smart  
> I'm finishing my work since you relate  
> These pretty tales; but I will call you up  
> Out of your bed to-morrow in the morning  
> So early I Oh, I wish now it were day  
> Already, for I 'm sure I shall not get  
> One wink of sleep for thinking of the cloth. \[c\]

> \[a\] It is a notion in some parts of Germany, that if a girl leaves
> any flax or tow on her distaff unspun on Saturday night, none of what
> remains will make good thread. Grimm, Deut. Mythol. Anhang, p. lxxii.

> \[b\] *Glanz* is the term employed in Switzerland.

> \[c\] This legend was picked up by a friend of Mr. Wyss when on a
> topographical ramble in the neighbourhood of Bern. It was told to him
> by a peasant of Belp; "but," says Mr. Wyss, "if I recollect right,
> this man said it was a nice smoking-hot cake that was on the plate,
> and it was a servant, not the man's son, who was driving the plough.
> The circumstance of the table-cloth being handed down from mother to
> daughter," he adds, "is a fair addition which I have allowed myself."

> The writer recollects to have heard this story, when a boy, from an
> old woman in Ireland; and he could probably point out the very field
> in the county of Kildare where it occurred. A man and a boy were
> ploughing: the boy, as they were about in the middle of their furrow,
> smelled roast beef, and wished for some. As they returned, it was
> lying on the grass before them. When they had eaten, the boy said "God
> bless me, and God bless the fairies!" The man did not give thanks, and
> he met with misfortunes very shortly after.

> --The same legend is also in Scotland.
