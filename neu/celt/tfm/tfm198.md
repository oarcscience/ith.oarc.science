A MOONLIGHT SCENE

>  

> CONCEIVED AND COMMENCED WHEN PASSING OVEN PUTNEY BRIDGE ON A FINE
> MOONLIGHT NIGHT IN SUMMER.

>  

> THE moonbeams on the lake are glancing,  
> The nimble bark is now advancing,  
> That for this grove is bound.  
> Ye gentle clouds, ah! hear a lover,  
> And hasten not the moon to cover  
> And darkness pour around.

> Doth fancy sport, or do I hear her,  
> As nearer still she comes and nearer,  
> Cutting the billows bright? -.  
> How still! scarce even a light breeze flying!  
> Earth, water, air, at peace are lying  
> Beneath the calm moonlight.

> My heart beats high, my soul rejoices,  
> Methinks I hear their merry voices--  
> She soon will reach the shore.--  
> Ah me! my hopes, my hopes are failing,  
> Yon sable cloud is onwards sailing--  
> The moon it covers o'er.

> Now o'er the lake they dubious wander,  
> And on some part remote may strand her,  
> Unless they aid obtain--  
> I'll wave a signal from the summit  
> Of you high bank, and haply from it  
> Some guidance they may gain.

> The cloud moves on, the moonlight beameth  
> And o'er the lovely lady streameth,  
> Upon her lofty stand.  
> With joyful shout the boatmen greet her,  
> Her anxious lover hastes to meet her,  
> And eager springs to land.
