KIRSTEN'S HILL

>  

> THERE is a hill on the lands of Skjelverod, near Ringsted, called
> Kirsten's-hill *(Kirstens Bjerg).* In it there lived a Hill-troll
> whose name was Skynd, who had from time to time stolen no less than
> three wives from a man in the village of Englerup.

> It was late one evening when this man was riding hone from Ringsted,
> and his way lay by the hill. When he came there he saw a great crowd
> of Hill-folk who were dancing round it, and had great merriment among
> them. But on looking a little closer, what should he recognise but all
> his three wives among them! Now as Kirsten, the second of them, had
> been his favourite, and dearer to him than either of the others, he
> called out to her, and named her name. Troll Skynd then came up to the
> man, and asked him why he presumed to call Kirsten. The man told him
> briefly how she had been his favourite and best beloved wife, and
> entreated of him, with many tears and much lamentation, to let him
> have her home with him again. The Troll consented at last to grant the
> husband's request, with, however, the condition, that he should never
> hurry *(skynde)* her.

> For a long time the husband strictly kept the condition; but one day,
> when the woman was above in the loft, getting something, and it
> happened that she delayed a long time, he called out, Make haste,
> Kirsten, make haste, *(Skynde dig Kirsten);* and scarcely had he
> spoken the words, when the woman was gone, compelled to return to the
> hill, which has ever since been called Kirsten's Bjerg. \[a\]
