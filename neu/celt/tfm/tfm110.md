THE PORTUNES

>   
>   
> IN another part of this work the Chancellor says, \[a\]--

> "They have in England certain demons, though I know not whether I
> should call them demons or figures of a secret and unknown generation,
> which the French call Neptunes, the English Portunes. \[b\] It is
> their nature to embrace the simple life of comfortable farmers, and
> when, on account of their domestic work, they are sitting up at night,
> when the doors are shut, they warm themselves at the fire, and take
> little frogs out of their bosom, roast them on the coals, and eat
> them. They have the countenance of old men, with wrinkled cheeks, and
> they are of a very small stature, not being quite half-an-inch high.
> \[c\] They wear little patched coats, and if anything is to be carried
> into the house, or any laborious work to be done, they lend a hand,
> and finish it sooner than any man could. It is tbeir nature to have
> the power to serve, but not to injure. They have, however, one little
> mode of annoying. When in the uncertain shades of night the English
> are riding any where alone, the Portune sometimes invisibly joins the
> horseman; and when he has accompanied him a good while, he at last
> takes the reins, and leads the horse into a neighbouring slough; and
> when he is fixed and floundering in it, the Portune goes off with a
> loud laugh, and by sport of this sort he mocks the simplicity of
> mankind.
