ROUSSEAU'S DREAM

>  

> THESE verses are adapted to the well-known air. They were suggested by
> a passage from Rousseau's works, quoted by Alison in his Essay on
> Taste. Though real names are mentioned, the scenery and subject are
> purely ideal.

> Calmly at eve shone the sun o'er Lake Leman,  
> Bright in his beam lay the watery expanse,  
> Softly the white sails reflected his gleaming,  
> Groves, banks, and trees their slow shadows advance.  
> Cool from the mountains the summer-gale breathed,  
> Laden with fragrance the lake it came o'er;  
> Leman, exulting, danced joyous beneath it,  
> Light crisped waves gently roll to the shore.

> At that soft hour on the blue Leman rowing,  
> Slowly a sage urged his bark by a grove,  
> Silently musing, his lofty mind glowing,  
> Viewing earths pomp and the glories above  
> As o'er the lake the long shadows extended,  
> Whispering the breeze, lulled each sense to repose;  
> Calm he reclined, and as slumber descended,  
> Visions of bliss to his fancy arose.

> Heaven to his view seemed arrayed in new glory,  
> Earth breathed forth fragrance and basked in the ray  
> Clad in loose raiment, more white than the hoary  
> Front of Mont Blanc, came a son of the day.  
> Lightly his wand o'er the slumberer extending,  
> While with new joy laughed the earth, sky, and lake;  
> Love in his accents with soft pity blending,  
> Shedding content, thus the bright vision spake:--

> "Hither I come, from ray cloud-crowned station,  
> Touched with thy grief; to shed balm o'er thy mind '  
> I am the Spirit to whom, at creation,  
> Charge was by Heaven o'er this region assigned.  
> List to my accents, thou hunted by malice!  
> Let what I utter sink deep in thy breast:  
> Fly from mankind, to the lakes, hills, and valleys,  
> Thus, thus alone, shall thy spirit find rest.

> "But if again to the world thou now fliest,  
> Thou should return, and again meet thy foes,  
> Think on this hour, when for comfort thou sighest,  
> And the bright scene will dispel all thy woes."  
> Gone was the vision: eve's star now was glancing,  
> Cold came the breeze o'er the blue curling stream;  
> Waked from his slumber, his heart with joy dancing,  
> Homeward he turned, and still mused on his dream.
