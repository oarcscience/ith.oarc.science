THE FIDDLER AND THE FAIRY

>  

> A FIDDLER having agreed with a person, who was a stranger, for so much
> money, to play to some company he should bring him to, all the twelve
> days of Christmas, and received earnest for it, saw his new master
> vanish into the earth the moment he had made the bargain. Nothing
> could be more terrified than was the poor fiddler. He found he had
> entered himself into the Devil's service, and looked on himself as
> already damned; but having recourse to a clergyman, he received some
> hope. He ordered him, however, as he had taken earnest, to go when he
> should be called, but that whatever tunes should be called for, to
> play none but psalms. On the day appointed the same person appeared,
> with whom he went, but with what inward reluctance it is easy to
> guess; and punctually obeying the minister's directions, the company
> to whom he played were so angry, that they all vanished at once,
> leaving him at the top of a high hill, and so bruised and hurt, though
> he was not sensible when or from what hand be received the blows, that
> he got not home without the utmost difficulty.
