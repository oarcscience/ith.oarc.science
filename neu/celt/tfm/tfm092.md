THE PEASANT AND THE WATERMAN

>  

> A WATER-MAN once lived on good terms with a peasant who dwelt not far
> from his lake. He often visited him, and at last begged that the
> peasant would visit him in his house under the water. The peasant
> consented, and went down with him. There was everything down under the
> water as in a stately palace on the land,--halls, chambers, and
> cabinets, with costly furniture of every description. The Water-man
> led his guest over the whole, and showed him everything that was in
> it. They came at length to a little chamber, where were standing
> several new pots turned upside down. The peasant asked what was in
> them. "They contain," was the reply, "the souls of drowned people,
> which I put under the pots and keep them close, so that they cannot
> get away." The peasant made no remark, and he came up again on the
> land. But for a long time the affair of the souls continued to give
> him great trouble, and be watched to find when the Water-man should be
> from home. When this occurred, as he had marked the right way down, he
> descended into the water-house, and, having made out the little
> chamber, he turned up all the pots one after another, and immediately
> the souls of the drowned people ascended out of the water, and
> recovered their liberty. \[a\]

> \[a\] This legend seems to be connected with the ancient idea of the
> water-deities taking the souls of drowned persons to themselves. In
> the Edda, this is done by the sea-goddess Ran.
