EDDAS AND SAGAS

> En sång om strålende Valhalla,  
> Om Gudar och Gudinnar alla.  
> TREGNER.

> A song of Vallhall's bright abodes,  
> Of all the goddesses and gods.

>  

> THE ancient religion of Scandinavia, and probably of the whole
> Gotho-German race, consisted, like all other systems devised by man,
> in personifications of the various powers of nature and faculties of
> mind. Of this system in its fulness and perfection we possess no
> record. It is only from the poems of the elder or poetic Edda, \[a\]
> from the narratives of the later or prose Edda and the various Sagas
> or histories written in the Icelandic language, \[b\] that we can
> obtain any knowledge of it.

> The poetic or Saemund's Edda was, as is generally believed, collected
> about the end of the eleventh or beginning of the twelfth century by
> an Icelander named Saemund, and styled Hinns Fròda, or The Wise. It
> consists of a number of mythological and historical songs, the
> production of the ancient Scalds or poets, all, or the greater part,
> composed before the introduction of Christianity into the north. The
> measure of these venerable songs is alliterative rime, and they
> present not unfrequently poetic beauties of a high and striking
> character. \[c\]

> The prose Edda is supposed to have been compiled in the thirteenth
> century by Snorro Sturleson, the celebrated historian of Norway. It is
> a history of the gods and their actions formed from the songs of the
> poetic Edda, and from other ancient poems, several stanzas of which
> are incorporated in it. Beside the preface and conclusion, it consists
> of two principal parts, the first consisting of the Gylfaginning
> *(Gylfa's Deception),* or Hárs Lygi *(Har's* i.e. *Odin's Fiction),*
> and the Braga-raedur *(Braga's Narrative),* each of which is divided
> into several Daemi-sagas or Illustrative Stories; and the second named
> the Kenningar or list of poetic names and periphrases. \[d\]

> The Gylfa-ginning narrates that Gylfa king of Sweden, struck with the
> wisdom and power of the Aeser, \[e\] as Odin and his followers were
> called, journeyed in the likeness of an old man, and under the assumed
> name of Ganglar, to Asgard their chief residence, to inquire into and
> fathom their wisdom. Aware of his design, the Aeser by their magic art
> caused to arise before him a lofty and splendid palace, roofed with
> golden shields. At the gate he found a man who was throwing up and
> catching swords, seven of which were in the air at one time. This man
> inquires the name of the strange; whom he leads into the palace, where
> Ganglar sees a number of persons drinking and playing, and three
> thrones, each set higher than the other. On the thrones sat Har
> *(High),* Jafnhar *(Equal-high),* and Thridi *(Third*). Ganglar asks
> if there is any one there wise and learned. Har replies that he will
> not depart in safety if he knows more than they \[f\]. Ganglar then
> commences his interrogations, which embrace a variety of recondite
> subjects, and extend from the creation to the end of all things. To
> each he receives a satisfactory reply. At the last reply Ganglar hears
> a loud rush and noise: the magic illusion suddenly vanishes, and he
> finds himself alone on an extensive plain.

> The Braga-raedur is the discourse of Braga to Aegir, the god of the
> sea, at the banquet of the Immortals. This part contains many tales of
> gods and heroes old, whose adventures had been sung by Skalds, of high
> renown and lofty genius.

> Though both the Eddas were compiled by Christians, there appears to be
> very little reason for suspecting the compilers of having falsified or
> interpolated the mythology of their forefathers. Saemund's Edda may be
> regarded as an Anthology of ancient Scandinavian poetry; and the
> author of the prose Edda (who it is plain did not always understand
> the true meaning of the tales he related) wrote it as a northern
> Pantheon and Gradus ad Parnassum, to supply poets with incidents,
> ornaments, and epithets. Fortunately they did so, or impenetrable
> darkness had involved the ancient religion of the Gothic stock!

> Beside the Eddas, much information is to be derived from the various
> Sagas or northern histories. These Sagas, at times transmitting true
> historical events, at other times containing the wildest fictions of
> romance, preserve much valuable mythic lore, and the Ynglinga,
> Volsunga, Hervarar, and other Sagas, will furnish many important
> traits of northern mythology.

> It is not intended here to attempt sounding the depths of Eddaic
> mythology, a subject so obscure, and concerning which so many and
> various opinions occur in the works of those who have occupied
> themselves with it. Suffice it to observe that it goes back to the
> most remote ages, and that two essential parts of it are the Alfar
> *(Alfs* or *Elves)* and the Duergar (*Dwarfs*), two classes of beings
> whose names continue to the present day in all the languages of the
> nations descended from the Gotho-German race.

> "Our heathen forefathers," says Thorlacius, \[g\] "believed, like the
> Pythagoreans, and the farther back in antiquity the more firmly, that
> the whole world was filled with spirits of various kinds, to whom they
> ascribed in general the same nature and properties as the Greeks did
> to their Daemons. These were divided into the Celestial and the
> Terrestrial, from their places of abode. The former were, according to
> the ideas of those times, of a good and elevated nature, and of a
> friendly disposition toward men, whence they also received the name of
> White or Light Alfs or Spirits. The latter, on the contrary, who were
> classified after their abodes in air, sea, and earth, were not
> regarded in so favourable a light. It was believed that they,
> particularly the *land ones,* the *δαίμονες έπιχθόνιοι* of the Greeks,
> constantly and on all occasions sought to torment or injure mankind,
> and that they had their dwelling partly on the earth in great thick
> woods, whence came the name Skovtrolde \[h\] *(Wood Trolls),* or in
> other desert and lonely places, partly in and under the ground, or in
> rocks and hills; these last were called Bjerg-Trolde *(Hill Trolls):*
> to the first, on account of their different nature, was given the name
> of Dverge *(Dwarf's),* and Alve, whence the word Ellefolk, which is
> still in the Danish language. These Daemons, particularly the
> underground ones, were called Svartálfar, that is Black Spirits, and
> inasmuch as they did mischief, Trolls."

> This very nearly coincides with what is to be found in the Edda,
> except that there would appear to be some foundation for a distinction
> between the Dwarfs and the Dark Alfs. \[i\]

> \[e\] By the Aeser are understood the Asiatics, who with Odin brought

> \[h\] Thorlacius, *ut* *supra,* says the thundering Thor was regarded
> as particularly inimical to the Skovtrolda, against whom be
> continually employed his mighty weapon. He thinks that the *Bidental*
> of the Romans, and the rites connected with it, seem to suppose a
> similar superstition, and that in the well-known passage of Horace,

> Tu parum castis inimica mittes  
> Fulmina lucis,

> the words *parum castis lucis* may mean groves or parts of woods, the
> haunt of unclean spirits or Skovtrolds, *satyri lascivi et* *salaces.*

> \[i\] The Dark Alfs were probably different from the Duergar, yet the

> Náir, Dvergar  
> *Ok* Döck-A'lfar.  
> Hrafna-Galdr Othins, xxiv. 7.

> Ghosts, Dwarfs  
> *And* Dark Alfs.

> Yet the Scandinavian llterati appear unanimous in regarding them as
> the same. Grimm, however, agrees with us in viewing the Döck-Alfar as
> distinct from the Duergar. As the abode of these last is named
> Svartálfaheimr, lie thinks that the Svartálfar and the Duergar were
> the same.--Deutsche Mythologie, p. 413, *seq*. See below,
