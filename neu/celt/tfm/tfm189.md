THE MAZIK-ASS

>  

> IT came to pass in the countries of Africa, in a particular month,
> during which it is the usage and the custom of the Jews to rise in the
> night to say their prayers, that a servant, whose business it was to
> knock at the doors, and to call up the people, found one night an ass
> *(jumento)* in the street; and he mounted upon him, and went riding
> along and calling up the people. And, as he rode, lo! the ass began to
> swell and to increase in size, until he became three hundred yards in
> height, and reached up even unto the top of the loftiest tower of the
> church, upon which he set the man, and then went away; and on the
> morrow the man was found sitting upon the tower. Now, thou must know
> that this ass was one of the Mazikeen.

> The Jews have, as it were, brought us back to Asia. As we proceed
> eastwards from Persia, where we commenced, India first meets our view,
> but of the numerous beings of its copious and intricate mythology, no
> class seems to belong to earth unless it be the Yakshas who attend on
> Kuveras, the Hindoo Plutos, and have charge of his enchanted gardens
> on the summit of Himalayas, and who bear some resemblance to the
> Dwarfs. There are also the misshapen Pisachas, who love to dwell in
> gloom; the, Vidhyadharas, *i.* *e.,* Masters of Magic, are said, to
> resemble the Jinn of the Arabs; and the dancing and singing Gandharvas
> and Apsaresas may be compared with the Nymphs of Grecian mythology.

> Eastwards still lies China. Here there is a species of beings named
> Shinseën, who are said to haunt the woods and mountains, where, exempt
> from the passions and the cares of life, they dwell in a state of
> blissful ease; but still exercise an influence over human affairs.
> Sometimes they appear as old men with long beards; at other times as
> young maidens, sauntering amid rocks and. woods by moonlight. \[a\]

> We do not recollect to have met, in our reading, with any other beings
> bearing a resemblance to what we term Fairies.
