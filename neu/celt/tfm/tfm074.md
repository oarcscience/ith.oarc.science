THE DWARF'S FEAST

>  

> THERE appeared in the night to one of the Counts von Hoya, an
> extremely small little man. The count was utterly amazed at him, but
> he bid him not to be frightened; said he had a request to make of him,
> and entreated that he might not be refused. The count gave a willing
> assent, qualified with the provision, that the thing requested should
> be a matter which lay in his power, and would not be injurious to him
> or his. The little man then said, "There will come tomorrow night some
> people to thy house, and make a feast, if thou will lend, them thy
> kitchen, and hall for as long as they want them, and order thy
> servants to go to sleep, and no one to look at what they are doing or
> are about; and also let no one know of it but thyself; only do this
> and we shall be grateful to thee for thy courtesy: thou and thy family
> will be the better of it; nor will it be in any way hurtful to thee or
> thine." The count readily gave his consent, and on the following night
> there came, as if they were a travelling party, over the bridge into
> the house a great crowd of little people, exactly such as the
> Hill-mannikins are described to be. They cooked, cut up wood, and laid
> out the dishes in the kitchen, and had every appearance of being about
> preparing a great entertainment.

> When it drew near the morning, and they were about to take their
> departure, the little man came again up to the count, and with many
> thanks, presented him a sword, a salamander-cloth, and a golden ring,
> in which there was inserted a red-lion, with directions for himself
> and his descendants to keep these three articles safe; and so long as
> they kept them together all would be at unity and well in the county,
> but as soon as they were separated from each other it would be a token
> that there was evil coming on the county: the red lion too would
> always become pale when one of the family was to die.

> They were long preserved in the family; but in the time when count
> Jobst and his brothers were in their minority, and Francis von Halle
> was governor of the land, two of the articles, the sword and the
> salamander-cloth, were taken away, but the ring remained with the
> family until they became extinct. What has become of it since is
> unknown. \[a\]
