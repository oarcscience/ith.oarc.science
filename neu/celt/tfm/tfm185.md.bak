AFRICANS

>  

> When evening's shades o'er Goree's Isle extend,  
> The nimble Yumboes from the Paps descend,  
> Slily approach the natives' huts, and steal,  
> With secret hand, the pounded coos-coos meal.  
> T. K.

> THE Jaloff inhabitants of the mainland of Africa, opposite the isle of
> Goree, believe in a species of beings who have a striking and
> surprising correspondence with the Gothic Fairies. They call them
> Yumboes, and describe them as being about two feet high, of a white
> colour, as every thing preternatural is in Africa. It is remarkable
> that, acting on the same principle as the Greeks, who called their
> Furies Eumenides, and the Scots and Irish, who style the Fairies Good
> Neighbours, or Good People, the Africans call the Yumboes, Bakhna
> Rakhna, or Good People. The dress of the Yumboes exactly corresponds
> with that of the natives, and they imitate their actions in every
> particular. They attach themselves to particular families; and
> whenever any of their members die, the Yumboes are heard to lament
> them, and to dance, upon their graves. The Moors believe the Yumboes
> to be the souls of their deceased friends.

> The chief abode of the Yumboes is a subterraneous dwelling on the
> Paps, the hills about three miles distant from the coast. Here they
> dwell in great magnificence, and many wonderful stories are told of
> those persons, particularly Europeans, who have been received and
> entertained in the subterraneous residence of the Yumboes: of how they
> were placed at richly furnished tables; how nothing but hands and feet
> were to be seen, which laid and removed the various dishes; of the
> numerous stories the underground abode consisted of; the modes of
> passing from one to the other without stairs, etc., etc.

> In the evening the Yumboes come down to the habitation of man, wrapped
> close in their *pangs*, \[a\] with only their eyes and nose visible.
> They steal to the huts, where the women are pounding in mortars the
> coos-coos, or corn, watch till the pounders are gone for sieves to
> searce the meal, and then slily creep to the mortars, take out the
> meal, and carry it off in their pangs, looking every moment behind
> them, to see if they are observed or pursued; or they put it into
> calabashes, and arranging themselves in a row, like the monkeys,
> convey it from hand to hand, till it is placed in safety.

> They are also seen at night in their canoes, out fishing in the bay.
> They bring their fish to land, and, going to the fires kindled by the
> natives to keep away the wild beasts, they steal each as much fire as
> will roast his fish. They bury palm-wine, and when it becomes sour
> they drink of it till it intoxicates them, and then make a great
> noise, beating Jaloff drums on the hills. \[b\]

> \[a\] The Pang (Span. *pano,* cloth) is an oblong piece of cotton
> cloth, which the natives manufacture and wear wrapped round their
> bodies.

> \[b\] For the preceding account of the Yumboes we are indebted to a
> young lady, who spent several years of her childhood at Goree. What
> she related to us she had heard from her maid, a Jaloff woman, who
> spoke no language but Jaloff.
