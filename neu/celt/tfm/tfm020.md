THE YOUNG SWAIN AND THE ELVES

>  

> I WAS a handsome young swain,  
> And to the court should ride.  
> I rode out in the evening-hour;  
> In the rosy grove I to sleep me laid.  
> Since I her first saw.

> I laid me under a lind so green,  
> My eyes they sunk in sleep;  
> There came two maidens going along,  
> They fain would with me speak.  
> Since I her first saw.

> The one she tapped me on my cheek,  
> The other whispered in my ear:  
> "Stand up, handsome young swain,  
> If thou list of love to hear."  
> Since I her first saw.

> They led then forth a maiden,  
> Whose hair like gold did shine:  
> "Stand up, handsome young swain,  
> If thou to joy incline."  
> Since I her first saw.

> The third began a song to sing,  
> With good will she did so;  
> Thereat stood the rapid stream,  
> Which before was wont to flow.  
> Since I her first saw.

> Thereat stood the rapid stream,  
> Which before was wont to flow;  
> And the hind all with her hair so brown,  
> Forgot whither she should go.  
> Since I her first saw.

> I got me up from off the ground,  
> And leaned my sword upon;  
> The Elve-women danced in and out,  
> All had they the Elve fashión.  
> Since I her first saw.

> Had not fortune been to me so good,  
> That the cock his wings clapped then,  
> I had slept within the hill that night,  
> All with the Elve-womén.  
> Since I her first saw. \[a\]

> A Danish legend (Thiele, i. 22) relates that a poor man, who was
> working near Gillesbjerg, a haunted hilt, my down on it to rest
> himself in the middle of the day. Suddenly there appeared before him a
> beautiful maiden, with a gold cup in her hand. She made signs to him

> was hollow.
