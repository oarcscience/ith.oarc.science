# THE FAIRY MYTHOLOGY.

<span id="img_8"></span> ![](img/p08.jpg)

### INTRODUCTION.

>   
> In olde days of the King Artour,  
> Of which that Bretons spoken gret honour,  
> All was this lond fulfilled of faërie;  
> The elf-qrene with hir jolts companie  
> Danced full oft in many a grene mede.  
> CHAUCER.

>  

> ORIGIN OF THE BELIEF IN FAIRIES.

> ACCORDING to a well-known law of our nature, effects suggest causes;
> and another law, perhaps equally general, impels us to ascribe to the
> actual and efficient cause the attribute of intelligence. The mind of
> the deepest philosopher is thus acted upon equally with that of the
> peasant or the savage; the only difference lies in the nature of the
> intelligent cause at which they respectively stop. The one pursues the
> chain of cause and effect, and traces out its various links till he
> arrives at the great intelligent cause of all, however he may
> designate him; the other, when unusual phenomena excite his attention,
> ascribes their production to the immediate agency of some of the
> inferior beings recognised by his legendary creed.

> The action of this latter principle must forcibly strike the minds of
> those who disdain not to bestow a portion of their attention on the
> popular legends and traditions of different countries. Every
> extraordinary appearance is found to have its extraordinary cause
> assigned; a cause always connected with the history or religion,
> ancient or modern, of the country, and not unfrequently varying with a
> change of faith. \[a\]

> The noises and eruptions of Aetna and Stromboli were, in ancient
> times, ascribed to Typhon or Vulcan, and at this day the popular
> belief connects them with the infernal regions. The sounds resembling
> the clanking of chains, hammering of iron, and blowing of bellows,
> once to be heard in the island of Barrie, were made by the fiends whom
> Merlin had set to work to frame the wail of brass to surround
> Caermarthen. \[b\] The marks which natural causes have impressed on
> the solid and unyielding granite rock were produced, according to the
> popular creed, by the contact of the hero, the saint, or the god:
> masses of stone, resembling domestic implements in form, were the
> toys, or the corresponding implements of the heroes and giants of old.
> Grecian imagination ascribed to the galaxy or milky way an origin in
> the teeming breast of the queen of heaven: marks appeared in the
> petals of flowers on the occasion of a youth's or a hero's untimely
> death: the rose derived its present hue from the blood of Venus, as
> she hurried barefoot through the woods and lawns; while the professors
> of Islam, less fancifully, refer the origin of this flower to the
> moisture that exuded from the sacred person of their prophet. Under a
> purer form of religion, the cruciform stripes which mark the back and
> shoulders of the patient ass first appeared, according to the popular
> tradition, when the Son of God condescended to enter the Holy City*,*
> mounted on that animal; and a fish only to be found in the sea \[the
> Haddock\] stills bears the impress of the finger and thumb of the
> apostle, who drew him out of the waters of Lake Tiberias to take the
> tribute-money that lay in his mouth. The repetition of the voice among
> the hills is, in Norway and Sweden, ascribed to the Dwarfs mocking the
> human speaker, while the more elegant fancy of Greece gave birth to
> Echo, a nymph who pined for love, and who still fondly repeats the
> accents that she hears. The magic scenery occasionally presented on
> the waters of the Straits of Messina is produced by the power of the
> Fata Morgana; the gossamers that float through the haze of an autumnal
> morning, are woven, by the ingenious dwarfs; the verdant circlets in
> the mead are traced beneath the light steps of the dancing elves; and
> St. Cuthbert forges and fashions the beads that bear his name, and lie
> scattered along the shore of Lindisfarne. \[c\]

> In accordance with these laws, we find in most countries a popular
> belief in different classes of beings distinct from men, and from the
> higher orders of divinities. These beings are usually believed to
> inhabit, in the caverns of earth, or the depths of the waters, a
> region of their own. They generally excel mankind in power and in
> knowledge, and like them are subject to the inevitable laws of death,
> though after a more prolonged period of existence.

> How these classes were first called into existence it is not easy to
> say; but if as some assert, all the ancient systems of heathen
> religion were devised by philosophers for the instruction of rude
> tribes by appeals to their senses, we might suppose that the minds
> which peopled the skies with their thousands and tens of thousands of
> divinities gave birth also to the inhabitants of the field and flood,
> and that the numerous tales of their exploits and adventures are the
> production of poetic fiction or rude invention. It may further be
> observed, that not unfrequently a change of religious faith has
> invested with dark and malignant attributes beings once the objects of
> love, confidence, and veneration. \[d\]

> It is not our intention in the following pages to treat of the awful
> or lovely deities of Olympus, Valhalla, or Meru. Our subject is less
> aspiring; and we confine ourselves to those beings who are our
> fellow-inhabitants of earth, whose manners we aim to describe, and
> whose deeds we propose to record. We write of FAIRIES, FAYS, ELVES,
>
> aut alio quo nomine gaudent.

> ORIGIN OF THE WORD FAIRY.

> <span id="img_1"></span> ![](img/p01.jpg)

> Like every other word in extensive use, whose derivation is not
> historically certain, the word Fairy has obtained various and opposite
> etymons. Meyric Casaubon, and those who like him deduce everything
> from a classic source, however unlikely, derive Fairy from Φήρ, a
> Homeric name of the Centaurs; \[e\] or think that *fée,* whence Fairy,
> is the last syllable of *nympha.* Sir W. Ouseley derives it from the
> Hebrew לאפ (*peer*)*, to adorn;* Skinner, from the Anglo-Saxon
> *ranan*, *to fare, to go;* others from Feres, companions, or think
> that Fairy-folk is *quasi* Fair-folk. Finally, it has been queried if
> it be not Celtic. \[f\]

> But no theory is so plausible, or is supported by such names, as that
> which deduces the English Fairy from the Persian Peri. It is said that
> the Paynim foe, whom the warriors of the Cross encountered in
> Palestine, spoke only Arabic; the alphabet of which language, it is
> well known, possesses no *p*, and therefore organically substitutes an
> *f* in such foreign words as contain the former letter; consequently
> Peri became, in the mouth of an Arab, Feri, whence the crusaders and
> pilgrims, who carried back to Europe the marvellous tales of Asia,
> introduced into the West the Arabo-Persian word *Fairy.* It is further
> added, that the Morgain or Morgana, so celebrated in old romance, is
> Merjan Peri, equally celebrated all over the East.

> All that is wanting to this so very plausible theory is something like
> proof, and some slight agreement with the ordinary rules of etymology.
> Had Feërie, or Fairy, originally signified the individual in the
> French and English, the only languages in which the word occurs, we
> might feel disposed to acquiesce in it. But they do not: and even if
> they did, how should we deduce from them the Italian Fata, and the
> Spanish Fads or Hada, (words which unquestionably stand for the same
> imaginary being,) unless on the principle by which Menage must have
> deduced Lutin from Lemur--the first letter being the same in both? As
> to the fair Merjan Peri (D'Herbelot calls her Merjan Banou--D'Herbelot
> *titre* Mergian says, "C'est du nom de cette Fée quo nos anciens
> romans ont formé celui de *Morgante la* *Déconnue."* He here confounds
> Morgana with Urganda, and he has been followed in his mistake.
> D'Herbelot also thinks it possible that *Féerie* may come from *Peri;*
> but he regards the common derivation from *Fata* as much more
> probable. Cambrian etymologists, by the way, *say* that Morgain is Mor
> Gwynn, the *White Maid.*), we fancy a little too much importance has
> been attached to her. Her name, as far as we can leant, only occurs in
> the Cahermân Nâmeh, a Turkish romance, though perhaps translated from
> the Persian.

> The foregoing etymologies, it is to be observed, are all the
> conjectures of English scholars; for the English is the only language
> in which the name of the individual, Fairy, has the canine letter to
> afford any foundation for them.

> Leaving, then, these sports of fancy, we will discuss the true origin
> of the words used in the Romanic languages to express the being which
> we name Fairy of Romance. These are *Faée, Fée,* French; *Fada,*
> Provençal (whence *Hada,* Spanish); and *Fata,* Italian.

> The root is evidently, we think, the Latin *fatum*. In the fourth
> century of our aera we find this word made plural, and even feminine,
> and used as the equivalent of Parcae. On the reverse of a gold medal
> of the Emperor Diocletian are three female figures, with the legend
> *Fatis victricibus;* a *cippus,* found at Valencia in Spain, has on
> one of its sides *Fat.* Q. *Fabius ex voto,* and on the other, three
> female figures, with the attributes of the Moerae or Parcae. \[these
> two instances are given by Mdlle. Amélie Bosquet (La Normandie
> Romanesque, etc. p. 91.) from Dom Martin, *Rel. des Gautois,* ii. ch.
> 23 and 24.\] In this last place the gender is uncertain, but the
> figures would lead us to suppose it feminine. On the other hand,
> Ausonius \[Gryphus ternaril numeri\] has *tres Charites,, tria Fata;*
> and Procopius \[Do Bell. Got. i. 25\] names a building at the Roman
> Forum *τά τρία,* adding *οΰτω γάρ 'Ρωμας τάς μοίρας νενομίκαδι καλείν
> .* The Fate or Fata, then, being persons, and their name coinciding so
> exactly with the modem terms, and. it being observed that the Moerae
> were, at the birth of Meleager, just as the Fees were at that of Ogier
> le Danois, and. other heroes of romance and tale, their identity has
> been at once asserted, and this is now, we believe, the most prevalent
> theory. To this it may be added, that in Gervase of Tilbury, and other
> writers of the thirteenth century, the Fada or Fée seems to be
> regarded as a being different from human kind. \[g\]

> On the other hand, in a passage presently to be quoted from a
> celebrated old romance, we shall meet a definition of the word *Fée,*
> which expressly asserts that such a being was nothing more than a
> woman skilled in magic; and such, on examination, we shall find to
> have been all the Fées of the romances of chivalry and of the popular
> tales; in effect, that *f*é*e* is a participle, and the words *dame*
> or *femme* is--to be understood.

> In the middle ages there was in use a Latin verb, *fatare*, \[h\]
> derived from *fatum* or *fata,* and signifying to enchant. This verb
> was adopted *by* the Italian, Provençal \[i\] and Spanish languages;
> in French it became, according to the analogy of that tongue, *faer,
> féer.* Of this verb the past participle is *faé*, *fé;* hence in the
> romances we continually meet with *les chevalier, faés, les dames
> faées, Oberon la faé, le cheval étoit faé, la clef était fée,* and
> such like. We have further, we think, demonstrated \[see our Virgil,
> Excurs. ix.\] that it was the practice of the Latin language to elide
> accented syllables, especially in the past participle of verbs of the
> first conjugation, and. that this practice had been transmitted to the
> Italian, whence *fatato-a* would *form fato-a,* and *una donna fatata*
> might thus become *una fata.* Whether the same was the case in the
> Provençal we cannot affirm, as our knowledge of that dialect is very
> slight; but, judging from analogy, we would. say it was, for in
> Spanish *Hadada* and *Hada* are synonymous. In the Neapolitan
> Pentamerone *Fata* and *Maga* are the same, and a Fata sends the
> heroine of it to a sister of hers,
>
> pure fatata.

> Ariosto says of Medea--

> E perchè per virtu d' erbe e d'incanti  
> Delle Fate una ed immortal fatta era.  
> *I Cinque Canti,* ii. 106.

> The same poet, however, elsewhere says--

> Queste che or Fate e dagli antichi foro  
> Gia dette Ninfe e Dee con piu bel nome.  
> --Ibid. i. 9.

> and,

> Nascemmo ad un punto che d'ogni altro male  
> Siamo capaci fuorchè della morto.  
> --Orl. *Fur.* xliii. 48.

> which last, however, is not decisive. Bojardo also calls the
> water-nymphs Fate; and our old translators of the Classics named them
> *fairies*. From all this can only, we apprehend, be collected, that
> the ideas *of* the Italian poets, and others, were somewhat vague on
> the subject.

> From the verb *faer, féer,* to enchant, illude, the French made a
> substantive *faerie*, *féerie,* \[j\] illusion, enchantment, the
> meaning of which was afterwards extended, particularly after it had
> been adopted into the English language.

> We find the word Faerie, in fact, to be employed in four different
> senses, which we will now arrange and exemplify.

> 1\. Illusion, enchantment.

> Plusieurs parlent de Guenart,  
> Du Loup, de l'Asne, de Renart,  
> De *faeries* et de songes,  
> De phantosmes et do mensonges.  
>
> Gul. Giar. ap. Ducange

> Where we must observe, as Sir Walter Scott seems not to have been
> aware of it, that the four last substantives bear the same relation to
> each other as those in the two first verses do.

> Me bifel a ferly  
> Of *faerie,* me thought  
> *Vision of Piers Plowman,* v. 11.

> Maius that sit with so benigne a chere,  
> Hire to behold it seemed faerie.

> The God of her has made an end,  
> And fro this worldes *faerie  
> *Hath taken her into companie.--  
> Gower,
>
> Constance.

> Mr. Ritson professes not to understand the meaning of *faerie* in this
> last passage. Mr. Ritson should, as Sir Hugh Evans says, have 'prayed
> his pible petter;' where, among other things that might have been of
> service to him, he would have learned that 'man walketh in a *vain*
> shew,' that 'all is *vanity,'* and that 'the fashion of this world
> passeth away;' and then he would have found no difficulty in
> comprehending the pious language of 'moral Gower,' in his allusion to
> the transitory and deceptive vanities of the world.

> 2\. From the sense of illusion simply, the transition was easy to that
> of the land of illusions, the abode of the Faés, who produced them;
> and Faerie next came to signify the country of the Fays. Analogy also
> was here aiding; for as a Nonnerie was a place inhabited by Nonnes, a
> Jewerie a place inhabited by Jews, so a Faerie was naturally a place
> inhabited by Fays. Its termination, too, corresponded with a usual one
> in the names of countries: Tartarie, for instance, and 'the regne of
> Feminie.'

> The feasts that underground the *Faerie* did him make,  
> And there how he enjoyed the Lady of the Lake.  
> *Drayton, Poly-Olb., Song* IV.

> 4\. Lastly, the word came to signify the individual denizen of
> Fairy-land, and was equally applied to the full-sized fairy knights
> and ladies of romance, and to the pygmy elves that haunt the woods and
> dells. At what precise period it got this its last, and subsequently
> most usual sense, we are unable to say positively; but it was probably
> posterior to Chaucer, in whom it never occurs, and certainly anterior
> to Spenser, to whom, however, it seems chiefly indebted for its future
> general currency. \[l\] It was employed during the sixteenth century
> \[m\] for the Fays of romance, and also, especially by translators,
> for the Elves, as corresponding to the Latin Nympha.

> They believed that king Arthur was not dead, but carried awaie by the

> Thus we have endeavoured to trace out the origin, and mark the
> progress of the word Fairy, through its varying significations, and
> trust that the subject will now appear placed in a clear and
> intelligible light.

> After the appearance of the Faerie Queene, all distinctions were
> confounded, the name and attributes of the real Fays or Fairies of
> romance were completely transferred to the little beings who,
> according to the popular belief, made 'the green sour ringlets whereof

> itself firmly among the people; a strong proof, if this idea be
> correct, of the power of the poetry of a nation in altering the
> phraseology of even the lowest classes \[n\] of its society.

> Shakspeare must be regarded as a principal agent in the revolution;
> yet even he uses Fairy once in the proper sense of Fay; a sense it

> Finally, Randolph, in his Amyntas, employs it, for perhaps the last
> time, in its second sense, Fairy-land:

> I do think  
> There will be of Jocastus' brood in Fairy.  
> Act i. sc. 3.

> We must not here omit to mention that the Germans, along with the
> French romances, early adopted the name of the Fees. They called them
> Feen and Feinen. \[o\] In the Tristram of Gottfried von Strazburg we
> are told that Duke Gylan had a syren-like little dog,

> Dez sie dem Herzoge gesandt '  
> Twas sent unto the duke, pardé,
