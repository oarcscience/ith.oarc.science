THE PRAISES OF MAZENDERAN

>   
> \[The object of this version was to give a correct idea of the
> animated anapastic measure in which the Shib-Nameh Is written. Our
> knowledge of Persian was extremely slight; but a friendly Orientalist
> gave us a faithful line-for-line translation, which we versified, and
> he and Ram Mohun Roy then compared our version with the original.\]

> His band from the lute hath its melody drawn,  
> And thus rose the song of Mazenderân:--  
> May Mazenderan, the land of my birth,  
> Its hills and its dales, be e'er famed o'er the earth:  
> For evermore blooms in its gardens the rose,  
> On its hills nods the tulip, the hyacinth blows;  
> Its air ever fragrant, its earth flourishing,  
> Cold or heat is not felt,--'tis perpetual spring.  
> The nightingale's lays in the gardens resound;  
> On the sides of the mountains the stately deer bound,  
> In search evermore of their pastime and food;  
> With fragrance and colour each season's bedewed;  
> Its streams of rose-water unceasingly roll,  
> Whose perfume doth gladness diffuse o'er the soul  
> In November, December, and January,  
> Pull of tulips the ground thou mayest everywhere see;  
> The springs, unexhausted, flow all through the year;  
> The hawk at his chase everywhere doth appear.  
> The region of bliss is adorned all o'er  
> With dinars, with rich stuffs, and with all costly store;  
> The idol-adorers with fine gold are crowned,  
> And girdles of gold gird the heroes renowned.  
> Whoe'er hath not dwelt in that region so bright,  
> His soul knows no pleasure, his heart no delight.
