THE BROWNIE

>  

> THE Nis, Kobold, or Goblin, appears in Scotland under the name of
> Brownie. \[a\] Brownie is a personage of small stature, wrinkled
> visage, covered with short curly brown hair, and wearing a brown
> mantle and hood. His residence is the hollow of the old tree, a ruined
> castle, or the abode of man, He is attached to particular families,
> with whom he has been known to reside, even for centuries, threshing
> the corn, cleaning the house, and doing everything done by his
> northern and English brethren. He is, to a certain degree,
> disinterested; like many great personages, he is shocked at anything
> approaching to the name of a bribe or *douceur*, yet, like them,
> allows his scruples to be overcome if the thing be done in a genteel,
> delicate, and secret way. Thus, offer Brownie a piece of bread, a cup
> of drink, or a new coat and hood, and he flouted at it, and perhaps,
> in his huff, quitted the place for ever; but leave a nice bowl of
> cream, and some fresh honeycomb, in a snug private corner, and they
> soon disappeared, though Brownie, it was to be supposed, never knew
> anything of them.

> A good woman had just made a web of linsey-woolsey, and, prompted by
> her good nature, had manufactured from it a snug mantle and hood for
> her little Brownie. Not content with laying the gift in one of his
> favourite spots, she indiscreetly called to tell him it was there.
> This was too direct, and Brownie quitted the place, crying,

> A new mantle and a new hood;  
> Poor Brownie! ye 'll ne'er do mair gude!

> Another version of this legend says, that the gudeman of' a farm-house
> in the parish of Glendevon having left out some clothes one night for
> Brownie, he was heard to depart, saying,

> Gie Brownie coat, gie Brownie sark,  
> Ye 'se get nae mair o' Brownie's wark! \[b\]

> At Leithin-hall, in Dumfrieshire, a Brownie had dwelt, as he himself
> declared, for three hundred years. He used to show himself but once to
> each master; to other persons he rarely discovered more than his hand.
> One master was greatly beloved by Brownie, who on his death bemoaned
> him exceedingly, even abstaining from food for many successive days.
> The heir returning from foreign parts to take possession of the
> estate, Brownie appeared to do him homage, but the Laird, offended at
> his mean, starved appearance, ordered him meat and drink, and new
> livery. Brownie departed, loudly crying,

> Ca', cuttee, ca'!  
> A' the luck of Leithin Ha'  
> Gangs wi' me to Bodsbeck Ha'.

> In a few years Leithin Ha' was in ruins, and "bonnie Bodsbeck"
> flourishing beneath the care of Brownie.

> Others say that it was the gudeman of Bodsbeck that offended the
> Brownie by leaving out for him a mess of bread and milk, and that he
> went away, saying,

> Ca, Brownie, ca',  
> A' the luck of Bodsbeck awa to Leithenha'.

> Brownie was not without some roguery in his composition. Two lasses
> having made a fine bowlful of buttered brose, had taken it into the
> byre to sup in the dark. In their haste they brought but one spoon,
> so, placing the bowl between them, they supped by turns. "I hae got
> but three sups," cried the one, "and it's a' dune."--" It 's a' dune,
> indeed," cried the other--" Ha, ha, ha!" cried a third voice, "Brownie
> has got the maist o' it."--And Brownie it was who had placed himself
> between them, and gotten two sups for their one.

> The following story will remind the reader of Hinzelmann. A Brownie
> once lived with Maxwell, Laird of Dalswinton, and was particularly
> attached to the Laird's daughter, the comeliest lass in all the holms
> of Nithadale. In all her bye affairs Brownie was her confidant and
> assistant; when she was married, it was Brownie who undressed her for
> the bridal bed; and when a mother's pains first seized her, and a
> servant, who was ordered to go fetch the *cannie wife*, who lived on
> the other side of the Nith, was slow in getting himself ready,
> Brownie, though it was one of dark December's stormy nights, and the
> wind was howling through the trees, wrapped his lady's fur cloak about
> him, mounted the servant's horse, and dashed through the waves of the
> foaming Nith. He went to the cannie wife, got her up behind hint, and,
> to her terror and dismay, plunged again into the torrent. "Ride nae by
> the auld pool," said she, "lest we suld meet wi' Brownie." "Fear nae,
> dame," replied he, "ye 've met a' the Brownies ye will meet." He set
> her down at the hall steps, and went to the stable. There finding the
> lad, whose embassy be had discharged, but drawing on his boots, he
> took off the bridle, and by its vigorous application instilled into
> the memory of the loitering loon the importance of dispatch. This was
> just at the time of the Reformation, and a zealous minister advised
> the Laird to have him baptised. The Laird consented, and the worthy
> minister hid himself in the barn. When Brownie was beginning his
> night's work, the man of God flung the holy water in his face,
> repeating at the same time the form of baptism. The terrified Brownie
> gave a yell of dismay, and disappeared for ever.

> Another name by which the domestic spirit was known in some parts of
> Scotland was Shellycoat, of which the origin is uncertain. \[c\]

> Scotland has also its water-spirit, called Kelpie, who in some
> respects corresponds with the Neck of the northern nations. "Every
> lake," says Graham \[d\] "has its Kelpie, or Water-horse, often seen
> by the shepherd, as he sat in a summer's evening upon the brow of a
> rock, dashing along the surface of the deep, or browsing on the
> pasture-ground upon its verge. Often did this malignant genius of the
> waters allure women and children to his subaqueous haunts, there to be
> immediately devoured. Often did he also swell the torrent or lake
> beyond its usual limits, to overwhelm the hapless traveller in the
> flood." \[e\]

> We have now gone through nearly the whole of the Gotho-German race,
> and everywhere have found their fairy system the same--a proof, we
> conceive, of the truth of the position of its being deeply founded in
> the religious system originally common to the whole race. We now
> proceed to another, and, perhaps, an older European family, the Celts.

> \[a\] He is named as we have seen by Gawain Douglas. King James says
> of him "The spirit called Brownie appeared like a rough man, and
> haunted divers houses without doing any evil, but doing, as it were,
> necessarie turns up and down the house; yet some are so blinded as to
> believe that their house was all the sonsier, as they called It, that
> such spirits resorted there."

> \[b\] Popular Rhymes of Scotland, p. 33.

> \[c\] Grimm (Deut. Mythol., p. 479) says it is the German
> Schellenrock, i.e, Bell-coat, from his coat being hung with bells like
> those of the fools. A Puck be says, once served in a convent in
> Mecklenburg, for thirty years, in kitchen, and stable, and the only
> reward he asked was "tunicam de diversis coloribus et *tintinnabulis*
> plenam."

> \[d\] Sketches of Perthsbire, p. 245.

> \[e\] In what precedes, we have chiefly followed Mr. Cromek. Those
> anxious for further information will meet it in the Minstrelsy of the
> Scottish Border, and other works.
