THE SCOTISH LOWLANDS

>   
>   
> When from their hilly dens, at midnight hour,  
> Forth rush the airy elves in mimic state,  
> And o'er the moonlight heath with swiftness scour,  
> In glittering arms the little horsemen shine.  
> ERSKINE.

> THE Scottish Fairies scarcely differ in any essential point from those
> of England. Like them they are divided into the rural and the
> domestic. Their attire is green, their residence the interior of the
> hills. They appear more attached than their neighbours to the
> monarchical form of government, for the Fairy king and queen, who seem
> in England to have been known only by the poets, were recognised by
> law in Caledonia, and have at all times held a place in the popular
> creed. They would appear also to be more mischievously inclned than
> the Southrons, and less addicted to the practice of dancing. They
> have, however, had the advantage of not being treated with contempt
> and neglect by their human countrymen, and may well be proud of the
> attention shown them by the brightest genius of which their country
> can boast. There has also been long due from them an acknowledgment of
> the distinction conferred on them by the editor of the Nithsdale and
> Galloway Song, \[a\] for the very fanciful manner in which he has
> described their attributes and acts.

> The Scottish Fairies have never been taken by the poets for their
> heroes or machinery, a circumstance probably to be attributed to the
> sterner character of Scottish religion. We cannot, therefore, as in
> England, make a distinction between popular and poetic fairies.

> The earliest notice we have met with of the Fairies is in Montgomery's
> Flyting against Polwart, where he says,

> In the hinder end of harvest, at All-hallowe'en,  
> When our *good neighbours* \[b\] dois ride, if I read right,  
> Some buckled on a beenwand, and some on a been,  
> Ay trottand in troops from the twilight;  
> Some saidled on a she-ape all graithed in green,  
> Some hobland on a hempstalk hovand to the sight;  
> The king of Phairie and his court, with the elf-queen,  
> With many elfish incubus, was ridand that night.

> Elf-land was the name of the realm ruled by the king of Phairie. King
> James \[c\] speaks of him and his queen, and "of sic a jolie court and
> traine as they had; how they had a teinde and a dewtie, as it were, of
> all guidis; how they naturally raid and yeid, eat and drank, and did
> all other actions lyke natural men and women. I think," concludes the
> monarch, "it is lyker Virgilis *Campi Elysii* nor anything that ought
> to be believed by Christianis." And one of the interlocutors in his
> dialogue asks how it was that witches have gone to death confessing
> that they had been "transported with the Phairie to such and such a
> hill, which, opening, they went in, and there saw a faire queene, who,
> being now lighter, gave them a stone which had sundry virtues."

> According to Mr. Cromek, who, however, rather sedulously keeps their
> darker attributes out of view, and paints everything relating to them
> *couleur* *de rose,* the Lowland Fairies are of small stature, but
> finely proportioned; of a fair complexion, with long yellow hair
> hanging over their shoulders, and gathered above their heads with
> combs of gold. They wear a mantle of green cloth, inlaid with wild
> flowers; green pantaloons, buttoned with bobs of silk; and silver
> shoon. They carry quivers of "adder-slough," and bows made of the ribs
> of a man buried where *three lairds' lands meet;* their arrows are
> made of bog-reed, tipped with white flints, and dipped in the dew of
> hemlock; they ride on steeds whose hoofs "would not dash the dew from
> the cup of a harebell." With their arrows they shoot the cattle of
> those who offend them; the wound is imperceptible to common eyes, but
> there are gifted personages who can discern and cure it. \[d\]

> In their intercourse with mankind they are frequently kind and
> generous. A young man of Nithsdale, when out on a love affair, heard
> most delicious music, far surpassing the utterance of 'any mortal
> mixture of earth's mould.' Courageously advancing to the spot whence
> the sound appeared to proceed, he suddenly found himself the spectator
> of a Fairy-banquet. A green table with feet of gold, was laid across a
> small rivulet, and supplied with the finest of bread and the richest
> of wines. The music proceeded from instruments formed of reeds and
> stalks of corn. He was invited to partake in the dance, and presented
> with a cup of wine. He was allowed to depart in safety, and ever after
> possessed the gift of second sight. He said he saw there several of
> his former acquaintances, who were become members of the Fairy
> society.

> We give the following legend on account of its great similarity to a
> Swiss tradition already quoted:--

> Two lads were ploughing in a field, in the middle of which was an old
> thorn-tree, a trysting place of the Fairy-folk. One of them described
> a circle round the thorn, within which the plough should not go. They
> were surprised, on ending the furrow, to behold a green table placed
> there, heaped up with excellent bread and cheese, and even wine. The
> lad who had drawn the circle sat down without hesitation, ate and
> drank heartily, saying, "Fair fa' the hands whilk gie." His companion
> whipped on the horses, refusing to partake of the Fairy-food. The
> other, said Mr. Cromek's informant, "thrave like a breckan," and was a
> proverb for wisdom, and an oracle for country knowledge ever after.
> \[e\]

> The Fairies lend and borrow, and it is counted *uncanny* to refuse
> them. A young woman was one day sifting meal warm from the mill, when
> a nicely dressed beautiful little woman came to her with a bowl of
> antique form, and requested the loan of as much meal as would fill it.
> Her request was complied with, and in a week she returned to make
> repayment. She set down the bowl and breathed over it, saying, "Be
> never toom." The woman lived to a great age, but never saw the bottom
> of the bowl.

> Another woman was returning late one night from a gossiping. A pretty
> little boy came up to her and said, "Coupe yere dish-water farther
> frae yere door-step, it pits out our fire." She complied with this
> reasonable request, and prospered ever after.

> \[a\] Mr. Cromek. There was, we believe, some false dealing on the
> pert of Allan Cunningham toward this gentleman, such as palming on him
> his owe verses as traditionary ones. But the legends are genuine.

> \[b\] This answers to the *Deenè Máh,* Good People, of the Highlands
> and Ireland. An old Scottish name, we may add, for a fairy seems to
> have been Bogle, akin to the English Pouke, Puck, Puckle but differing
> from the Boggart. Thus Gawain Douglas says,

> Of *Brownyis* and of *Boggles* full is this Beuk.

> \[c\] Daemonologie, B. III. c. 5.

> \[d\] These elf-arrows are triangular pieces of flint, supposed to
> have been the herds of the arrows used by the aborigines. Though more
> plentiful in Scotland they are also found in England and Ireland, and
> were there also attached to the fairies, and the wounds were also only
> to be discerned by gifted eyes

> \[e\] "It was till lately believed by the ploughmen of Clydesdale,
> that if they repeated the rhyme

> Fairy, fairy, bake me a bannock and roast me a collop,  
> And I'll gie ye a spurtle oft' my gadend!

> three several times on turning their cattle at the terminations of
> ridges, they would find the said fare prepared for them on reaching
> the end of the fourth furrow."--Chambers' Popular Rhymes of Scotland,
> p. 83.
