THE HILL MAN INVITED TO THE CHRISTENING

>  

> THE hill-people are excessively frightened during thunder. When,
> therefore, they see bad weather coming on, they lose no time in
> getting to the shelter of their hills. This terror is also the cause
> of their not being able to endure the beating of a drum, as they take
> it to be the rolling of thunder. It is therefore a good receipt for
> banishing them to beat a drum every day in the neighbourhood of their
> hills; for they immediately pack up and depart to some more quiet
> residence.

> A farmer lived once in great friendship and unanimity with a hill-man,
> whose hill was on his lands. One time when his wife was lying-in, it
> gave him some degree of perplexity to think that he could not well
> avoid inviting the hill-man to the christening, which might not
> improbably bring him into bad repute with the priest and the other
> people of the village. He was going about pondering deeply, but in
> vain, how he might get out of this dilemma, when it came into his head
> to ask the advice of the boy that kept his pigs, who was a great
> head-piece, and had often helped him before. The pig-boy instantly
> undertook to arrange the matter with the hill-man in such a manner
> that he should not only stay away without being offended, but moreover
> give a good christening-present.

> Accordingly, when it was night be took a sack on his shoulder, went to
> the hill-man's hill, knocked, and was admitted. He delivered his
> message, giving his master's compliments, and requesting the honour of
> his company at the christening. The hill-man thanked him, and said, "I
> think it is but right that I should give you a christening-gift." With
> these words he opened his money-chests, bidding the boy to hold up his
> sack while he poured money into it. "Is there enough now?" said he,
> when he had put 'a good quantity into it. "Many give more, few give
> less," replied the boy.

> The hill-man then fell again to filling the sack, and again asked, "Is
> there enough now?" The boy lifted up the sack a little off the ground
> to try if he was able to carry any more, and then answered, "It is
> about what most people give." Upon this the hill-man emptied the whole
> chest into the bag, and once more asked, "Is there enough now?" The
> guardian of the pigs saw that there was as much in it now as ever he
> was able to carry, so he made answer, "No one gives more, most people
> give less."

> "Come, now," said the hill-man, "let us hear who else is to be at the
> christening?" "Ah," said the boy, "we are to have a great parcel of
> strangers and great people. First and foremost, we are to have three
> priests and a bishop!" "Hem!*"* muttered the hill-man; "however, these
> gentlemen usually look only after the eating and drinking: they will
> never take any notice of me. Well, who else?" "Then we have asked St.
> Peter and St. Paul." "Hem! hem! however, there will be a by-place for
> me behind the stove. Well, and then?" "Then our Lady herself is
> coming!" "Hem! hem! hem! however, guests of such high rank come late
> and go away early. But tell me, my lad, what sort of music is it you
> are to have?"' "Music!" said the boy, "why, we are to have drums."
> "Drums! "repeated he, quite terrified; "no, no, thank you, I shall
> stay at 'home in that case. Give my best respects to your master, and
> I thank him for the invitation, but I cannot come. I did but once go
> out to take a little walk, and some people beginning to beat a drum, I
> hurried home, and was just got to my door when they flung the
> drum-stick after me and broke one of my shins. 'I have been lame of
> that leg ever since, and I shall take good care in future to avoid
> that sort of music." So saying, he helped the boy to put the sack on
> his back, once more charging him to give his best respects to the
> farmer. \[a\]
