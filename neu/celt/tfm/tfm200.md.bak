TO AMANDA

>  

> \[These are the verses quoted in the Introduction to the "Tales and
> Popular Fictions." The author was very young when he wrote them; and
> Amanda was, like Beatrice and Laura, a mere *donna di mente,* having
> no real existence.\]

> As when a storm in vernal skies  
> The face of day doth stain,  
> And o'er the smiling landscape flies,  
> With mist and drizzling rain;  
> If chance the sun look through the shower  
> O'er flowery hill and dale,  
> Reviving Nature owns his power,  
> And softly sighs the gale:

> So when, by anxious thoughts oppressed,  
> My soul sinks in despair,  
> When smiling hope deserts my breast,  
> And all is darkness there  
> If chance Amanda's form appear,  
> The gloom is chased away,  
> My soul once more her soft smiles cheer,  
> And joy resumes his sway.

> Then, dear Amanda, since thy smile  
> Has power all gloom to charm,  
> Oh! ever thus my cares beguile,  
> And guard my soul from harm.  
> Let Hymen's bands our fates unite,  
> What bliss may then be ours!--  
> Our days will glide, like streamlets bright,  
> O'erhung with fragrant flowers.
