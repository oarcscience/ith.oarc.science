THE ELLE-MAID NEAR EBELTOFT

>  

> A FARMER'S boy was keeping cows not far from Ebeltoft. There came to
> him a very fair and pretty girl, and she asked him if he was hungry or
> thirsty. But when he perceived that she guarded with the greatest
> solicitude against his getting a sight of her back, he immediately
> suspected that she must be an Elle-maid, for the Elle-people are
> hollow behind. He accordingly would give no heed to her, and
> endeavoured to get away from her; but when she perceived this, she
> offered him her breast that be should suck her. And so great was the
> enchantment that accompanied this action, that he was unable to resist
> it. But when he had done as she desired him, he had no longer any
> command of himself; so that she had now no difficulty in enticing him
> with her.

> He was three days away, during which time his father and mother went
> home, and were in great affliction, for they were well assured that he
> must have been enticed away. But on the fourth day his father saw him
> a long way off coming home, and he desired his wife to set a pan of
> meat on the fire as quick as possible. The son then came in at the
> door, and sat down at the table without saying a word. The father,
> too, remained quite silent, as if every thing was as it ought to be.
> His mother then set the meat before him, and his father bid him eat,
> but he let the food lie untouched, and said that he knew now where he
> could get much better food. The father then became highly enraged,
> took a good large switch, and once more ordered him to take his food.
> The boy was then obliged to eat, and as soon as he had tasted the
> flesh he ate it up greedily, and instantly fell into a deep sleep. He
> slept for as many days as the enchantment had lasted, but he never
> after recovered the use of his reason. \[a\]
