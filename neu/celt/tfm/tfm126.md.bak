THE FAIRIES NURSE

>  

> THE Fairies have a great fondness for getting their babes suckled by
> comely, healthy young women. A fine young woman of Nithsdale was one
> day spinning and rocking her first-born child. A pretty little lady in
> a green mantle, and bearing a beautiful babe, came into 'the cottage
> and said, "Gie my bonny thing a suck." The young woman did so, and the
> lady left her babe and disappeared, saying, "Nurse kin' and ne'er
> want." The young woman nursed the two children, and was astonished to
> find every morning, when she awoke, rich clothes for the children, and
> food of a most delicious flavour. Tradition says this food tasted like
> wheaten-bread, mixed with wine and honey.

> When summer came, the Fairy lady came to see her child. She was
> delighted to see how it had thriven, and, taking it in her arms,
> desired the nurse to follow her. They passed through some scroggy
> woods skirting the side of a beautiful green hill, which they ascended
> half way. A door opened on the sunny side--they went in, and the sod
> closed after them. The Fairy then dropped three drops of a precious
> liquid on her companion's left eyelid, and she beheld a most delicious
> country, whose fields were yellow with ripening corn, watered by
> *looping burnies,* and bordered by trees laden with fruit. She was
> presented with webs of the finest cloth, and with boxes of precious
> ointments. The Fairy then moistened her right eye with a 'green fluid,
> and bid her look. She looked, and saw several of her friends and
> acquaintances at work, reaping the corn and gathering the fruit.
> "This," said the Fairy, "is the punishment of evil deeds!" She then
> passed her hand over the woman's eye, and restored it to its natural
> power. Leading her to the porch at which she had entered, she
> dismissed her; but the woman had, secured the wonderful salve. From
> this time she possessed the faculty of discerning the Fairy people as
> they went about invisibly; till one day, happening to meet the
> Fairy-lady, she attempted to shake hands with her. "What ee d'ye see
> me wi'?" whispered she. "Wi' them baith," said the woman. The Fairy
> breathed on her eyes, and the salve lost its efficacy, and could never
> more endow her eyes with their preternatural power. \[a\]
