SCANDINAVIA

>   
> Du vare syv og hundrede Trolde,  
> De vera bade grumme og lede,  
> De vilde gjöre Bonden et Gjaesterle,  
> Med hannem baade drikke og aede.  
> ELINE AF VILLENSKOV.

> There were seven and a hundred Trolls,  
> They were both ugly and grim,  
> A visit they would the farmer make,  
> Both eat and drink with him.

>  

> UNDER the name of Scandinavia are included the kingdoms of Sweden,
> Denmark, and Norway, which once had a common religion and a common
> language. Their religion is still one, and their languages differ but
> little; we therefore feel that we may safely treat of their Fairy
> Mythology together.

> Our principal authorities are the collection of Danish popular
> trañitions, published by Mr. Thiele, \[a\] the select Danish ballads
> of Nyerup and Rahbek, \[b\] and the Swedish ballads of Geijer and
> Afzelius. \[c\] As most of the principal Danish ballads treating of
> Elves, etc., have been already translated by Dr. Jamieson, we will not
> insert; them here; but translate, instead, the corresponding Swedish
> ones, which are in general of greater simplicity, and often contain
> additional traits of popular belief. As we prefer fidelity to polish,
> the reader must not be offended at antique modes of expression and
> imperfect rimes. Our rimes we can, however, safely say shall be at
> least as perfect as those of our originals.

> These ballads, none of which are later than the fifteenth century, are
> written in a strain of the most artless simplicity not the slightest
> attempt at ornament is to be discerned in them; the same ideas and
> expressions continually recur; and the rimes are the most careless
> imaginable, often a mere *assonance* in vowels or consonants;
> sometimes not possessing even that slight similarity of sound. Every
> Visa or ballad has its single or double Omquaed \[d\] or burden,
> which, like a running accompaniment in music, frequently falls in with
> the most happy effect; sometimes recalling former joys or sorrows;
> sometimes, by the continual mention of some attribute of one of the
> seasons, especially the summer, keeping up in the mind of the reader
> or hearers the forms of external nature.

> It is singular to observe the strong resemblance between the
> Scandinavian ballads and those of England and Scotland, not merely in
> manner but in subject. The Scottish ballad first mentioned below is an
> instance; it is to be met with in England, in the Feroes, in Denmark,
> and in Sweden, with very slight differences. Geijer observes, that the
> two last stanzas of 'William and Margaret,' in Percy's Reliques, are
> nearly word for word the same as the two last in the Swedish ballad of
> 'Rosa Lilla,' \[e\] and in the corresponding Danish one. This might
> perhaps lead to the supposition of many of these ballads having come
> down from the time when the connexion was so intimate between this
> country and Scandinavia.

> We will divide the Scandinavian objects of popular belief into four
> classes:- 1. The Elves; 2. The Dwarfs, or Trolls, as they are usually
> called; 3. The Nisses; and 4. The Necks, Mermen, and Mermaids. \[f\]

> \[d\] The reader will find a beautiful instance of a double Omquaed in
> the Scottish ballad of the Cruel Sister.

> There were two sisters sat in a bower,

> As the primrose spreads so sweetly.

> The second and fourth lines are repeated in every stanza.

> \[e\] These are the Swedish verses:

> Det växte upp *Liljor* på begge deres graf,  
> *Med äran och med dygd--  
> *De växte tilsamman med alla sina blad.  
> *J vinnen v*ä*l, J vinnen v*ä*l både rosor och liljor.  
> *Det växte upp *Roser* ur bäda deras mun,  
> De växte tilsammans i fagreste lund.  
> *J vinnen v*ä*l, J vinnen v*ä
>
> l både rosor och liljor.

> \[f\] Some readers may wish to know the proper mode of pronouncing
> such Danish and Swedish words as occur in the following legends. For
> their satisfaction we give the following information. J is pronounced
> as our y; when it comes between a consonant and a vowel, it is very
> short, like the y that is expressed, but not written, in many English
> words after *c* and *g:* thus *kjaer* is pronounced very nearly as
> *care:* ö sounds like the German ö, or French *eu: d* after another
> consonant is rarely sounded, Trold is pronounced Troll: *aa,* which
> the Swedes write å, as o in *more, tore.* Aarhuus is pronounced
>
> Ore-hoos.
