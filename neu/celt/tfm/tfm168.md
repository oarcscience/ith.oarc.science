THE DANCE AND SONG OF THE KORRED

>  

> THE valley of Goel was a celebrated haunt of the Korred. \[a\] It was
> thought dangerous to pass through it at night lest one should be
> forced to join in their dances, and thus perhaps lose his life. One
> evening, however, a peasant and his wife thoughtlessly did so, and
> they soon found themselves enveloped by the dancing sprites, who kept
> singing--

> Lez y, Lez hon*,  
> *Bas an arer zo gant hon;  
> Lez on, Lez y,  
> Bas an arer zo gant y.

> Let him go, let him go,  
> For he has the wand of the plough;  
> Let her go, let her go,  
> For she has the wand of the plough.

> It seems the man had in his band the *fourche,* or short stick, which
> is used. as a plough-paddle in Brittany, and this was a protection,
> for the dancers made way for them to go out of the ring.

> When this became known, many persons having fortified themselves with
> a *fourche,* gratified their curiosity by witnessing the dance of the
> Korred. Among the rest were two tailors, Peric and Jean, who, being
> merry fellows, dared each other to join in the dance. They drew lots,
> and the lot fell upon Peric, a humpbacked red-haired, but bold stout
> little fellow. He went up to the Korred and asked permission to take
> share in their dance. They granted it, and all went whirling round and
> round, singing

> Dilun, Dimeurs, Dimerc'her.

> Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

> Perle, weary of the monotony, when there was a slight pause at the
> last word, added

> Ha Diriaou, ha Digwener.

> And Thursday and Friday.

> Mat!,mat! (good! good!) cried they, and gathering round him, they
> offered him his choice of beauty, rank, or riches. He laughed, and
> only asked them to remove his hump and change the colour of his hair.
> They forthwith took hold of him and tossed him up into the air,
> throwing him from hand to hand till at last he lighted on his feet
> with a flat back and fine long black hair.

> When Jean saw and heard of the change he resolved to try what *he*
> could get from the potent Korred, so a few evenings after he went and
> was admitted to the dance, which

> now went to the words as enlarged by Peric. To make his addition he
> shouted out,

> Ha Disadarn, ha Disul

> And Saturday and Sunday.

> "What more? what more?" cried the Korred, but he only went on
> repeating the words. They then asked him what he would have, and he
> replied riches. They tossed him up, and kept bandying him about till
> he cried for mercy, and on coming to the ground, he found he had got
> Peric's hump and red hair.

> It seems that the Korred were condemned to this continual dancing,
> which was never to cease till a mortal should join in their dance, and
> after naming all the days of the week, should add, *Ha cetu chu er
> sizun,* "And now the week is ended." They punished Jean for coming so
> near the end and then disappointing them. \[b\]

> We add the following circumstances from other authorities:

> At Carnac, near Quiberon, says M. de Cambry, in the department of
> Morbihan, on the sea-shore, is the Temple of Carnac, called in Breton
> "Ti Goriquet" *(House of the Gorics),* one of the most remarkable
> Celtic monuments extant. It is composed of more than four thousand
> large stones, standing erect in an arid plain, where neither tree nor
> shrub is to be seen, and not even a pebble is to be found in the soil
> on which they stand. If the inhabitants are asked concerning, this
> wonderful monument, they say it is an old camp of Caesar's, an army
> turned into stone, or that it is the work of the Crions or Gorics.
> These they describe as little men between two and three feet high, who
> carried these enormous masses on their hands; for, though little, they
> are stronger than giants. Every night they dance around the stones;
> and woe betide the traveller who approaches within their reach! he is
> forced to join in the dance, where he is whirled about till,
> breathless and exhausted, he falls down, amidst the peals of laughter
> of the Crions. All vanish with the break of day. \[c\]

> In the ruins of Tresmaiouen dwell the Courils. \[d\] They are of a
> malignant disposition, but great lovers of dancing. At night they
> sport around the Druidical monuments. The unfortunate shepherd that
> approaches them must dance their rounds with them till cock-crow; and
> the instances are not few of persons thus ensnared who have been found
> next morning dead with exhaustion and fatigue. Woe also to the
> ill-fated maiden who draws near the Couril dance! nine months after,
> the family counts one member more. Yet so great is the power and
> cunning of these Dwarfs, that the young stranger bears no resemblance
> to them, but they impart to it the features of some lad of the
> village.

> A number of little men, not more than a foot high, dwell under the
> castle of Morlaix. They live in holes in the ground, whither they may
> often be seen going, and beating on basins. They possess great
> treasures, which they sometimes bring out; and if any one pass by at
> the time, allow him to take one handful, but no more. Should any one
> attempt to fill his pockets, the money vanishes, and he is instantly
> assailed by a shower of boxes in the ear from invisible hands.

> The Bretons also say that there are spirits who silently skim the
> milk-pans in the dairies. They likewise speak of Sand Yan y Tad (*St.*
> *John and Father),* who carry five lights at their finger-ends, which
> they make spin round and round like a wheel. \[e\]

> There is a species of malignant beings, called Night-washers *(Eur
> cunnerez noz),* who appear on the banks of streams, and call on the
> passers-by to aid them to wash the linen of the dead. If any one
> refuses, they drag him into the water and break his arms.

> About Morlaix the people are afraid of evil beings they call Teurst.
> One of these, called Teursapouliet, appears in the likeness of some
> domestic animal. \[f\] In the district of Vannes is a colossal spirit
> called Teus, or Bugelnoz, who appears clothed in white between
> midnight and two in the morning. His office is to rescue victims from
> the Devil. He spreads his mantle over them, and they are secure. The
> Devil comes over the ocean; but, unable to endure the look of the good
> spirit, he sinks down again, and, the object of the spirit
> accomplished, he vanishes.
