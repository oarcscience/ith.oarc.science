> And so came he unto an Elve-dance gay.  
> The dance it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> The Elve-father reached out his white hand free,  
> "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."  
> The dance it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> "O nought I will, and nought I may,  
> To-morrow will be my wedding-day.'  
> The dance it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> And the Elve-mother reached out her white hand free,  
> "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."  
> The dance it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> "O nought I will, and nought I may,  
> To-morrow will be my wedding-day."  
> The dance.it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> And the Elve-sister reached out her white hand free,  
> "Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."  
> The dance it goes well,

> "What may it mean that the bells thus go?"

> "Each young swain ringeth home his bride."  
> The dance it goes well,  
> So well in the grove.

> Sir Olof is dead, and lies on his bier."
