AILEEN A ROON  
(ELLEN MY LOVE)

>  

> CARROL O'DALY is the Lochinvar of Ireland. He and Ellen Cavanagh were
> intimate from childhood. The result was love; but Ellen's father
> insisted on her marrying a wealthier suitor. On the wedding-night
> Carrol came disguised as a harper, and played and sung this air, which
> he had composed for the occasion. Ellen's tenderness revived in full
> force; she contrived to make her father, the bridegroom, and the
> guests drink to excess, and by morning she and Carrel were beyond
> pursuit.

> The following lines were written one evening to gratify a lady who
> wished to have the writer's idea of what Carrol might have sung. The
> air is generally known under the name of Robin Adair--

> What are the joys wealth and honours bestow?  
> Do they endure like true love's steady glow?  
> Shadows of vanity,  
> Mists of the summer sky,  
> Soon they disperse and *fly,  
> *Aileen a roon!

> Time was when Aileen tripped light as the fawn,  
> Spying young Carrol approach in the dawn,  
> Ere the sun's early beam  
> Glittered on lake and stream,--  
> Oh! that was bliss supreme,  
> Aileen a roon!

> Or when mild even's star beamed in the west,  
> Bringing to nature the season of rest--  
> At that sweet hour to rove,  
> Down by yon spreading grove,  
> Breathing forth vows of love,  
> Aileen a roon!

> Aileen forgets, but her Carrol more true,  
> As these past scenes memory brings to his view.  
> Heaves many a heavy sigh,  
> Breaking his heart is nigh--  
> And canst thou let him die?  
> Aileen a roon!
