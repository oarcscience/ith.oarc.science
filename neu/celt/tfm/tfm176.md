PEPITO EL CORCOVADO

>  

> PEPITO EL CORCOVADO, \[a\] a gay lively little hunchback, used to gain
> his living by his voice and his guitar; for he was a general
> favourite, and was in constant request at weddings and other
> festivities. He was going home one night from one of these festive
> occasions, being under engagement for another in the morning, and, as
> it was in the celebrated Sierra Morena, he contrived to lose his way.
> After trying in vain to find it, he wrapped his cloak about him, and
> lay down for the night at the foot of a cork-tree. He had hardly,
> however, gone to sleep, when be was awakened by the sound of a number
> of little voices singing to an old air with which he was well
> acquainted,

> Lunes y Martes y Miercoles tres

> over and over again. Deeming this to be imperfect, he struck in,
> adding,

> Jueves y Viernes y Sabado seis.

> The little folk were quite delighted, and for hours the mountain rang
> with

> Lunes y Martes y Miercoles tres,  
> Jueves y Viemes y Sabado sies.

> Monday and Tueaday and Wednesday three,  
> Thursday and Friday and Saturday, six.

> They finally crowded round Pepito, and bade him ask what he would for
> having completed their song so beautifully. After a little
> consideration, he begged to have his hump removed. So said so done, he
> was in an instant one of the straightest men in all Spain. On his
> return home, every one was amazed at the transformation. The story
> soon got wind, and another hunchback, named Cirillo, but unlike
> Pepito, as crooked in temper as in person, having learned from him
> where the scene of his adventure lay, resolved to proceed thither and
> try his luck. He accordingly reached the spot,. sat under the
> cork-tree, and saw and heard all that Pepito had heard and seen. He
> resolved also to add to the song, and he struck in with "Y Domingo
> siete" *(and Sunday seven);* but whether it was the breach of rhythm,
> or the mention of the Lord's Day that gave offence, he was instantly
> assailed with a shower of blows or pinches, and to make his calamity
> the greater, Pepito's hump was added to his own. \[b\]

>  

> We thus may see that there are beings in Spain also answering to the
> various classes of Fairies. But none of these have obtained the same
> degree of reputation as the House-spirit, whose Spanish name is Duende
> or Trasgo. In Torquemada's Spanish Mandeville, as the old English
> version of it is named, there is a section devoted to the Duende, in
> which some of his feats, such as pelting people with stones, clay, and
> such like, are noticed, and in the last century the learned Father
> Feijoo wrote an essay on Duendes, \[c\] *i.e.* on House-spirits; for
> he says little of the proper Spanish Duende, and his examples are
> Hodiken and the Kobolds, of which he had read in Agricola and other
> writers. On the whole, perhaps, the best account of the Duende will be
> found in Calderon's spritely comedy, named La Dama Duende.

> In this piece, when Cosme, who pretends that he had seen the Duende
> when he put out his candle, is asked by ins master what he was like,
> he replies:

> Era un fraile  
> Tamañito, y tenia puesto  
> Un cucurucho tamano;  
> Que por estas senas creo  
> Que era duende capuchino.

> This *cucurucho* was a long conical hat without a brim. worn by the
> clergy in general, nd not by the Capuchins alone. A little before,
> Cosme, when seeking to avert the appearance *of* the Duende, recites
> the following lines, which have the appearance of being formed from
> some popular charm against the House-spirit:

> Señora dama duende,  
> Duelase de mi;  
> Que soy nino y solo,  
> Y nunca en tal me vi.

> In De Solis' very amusing comedy of Un Bobo hace Ciento, Dona Ana
> makes the following extremely pretty application of the popular idea
> of the Duende:

> Yo soy, don Luis, una dama  
> Que no conozco este duende  
> Del amor, si no es por fama.

> In another of his plays *(El Amor al Uso), a* lady says:

> Amor es duende importuno  
> Que al mundo asombrando trae;  
> Todos dicen que le ay,  
> Y no le ha visto ninguno.

> The lines from Calderon prefixed to this section of our Work, show
> that money given by the Duende was as unsubstantial as fairy-money in
> general. This is confirmed by Don Quixote, who tells his rather
> covetous squire, that "los tesoros de los caballeros andantes son,
> como los de los Duendes, aparentes y falsos."

> The Spaniards seem also to agree with the people of other countries in
> regarding the Fairies as being fallen angels. One of their most
> celebrated poets thus expresses himself:

> Disputase por bombres entendidos  
> Si fue de *los* *caidos* este duende.

> Some Spanish etymologists say that Duende is a contraction of *Duéno
> de casa;* others, that it comes from the Arabic *Duar,* (dwelling) the
> term used for the Arab camps on the north-coast of Africa. To us it
> appears more probable that the Visigoths brought their ancient popular
> creed with them to Spain \[d\] also, and that as Duerg became Drac in
> Provence, it was converted into Duende in Spain. \[e\] It is further
> not quite impossible that Duerg may be also the original of Trasgo, a
> word for which we believe no etymon has been proposed.

> \[b\] See Thoms's Lays and Legends of Spain, p.83. It was related, he

> it in Spain. It is also briefly related (probably on the same
> authority) in the Quarterly Review, vol. xxii. (see above pp. 364,
> 438). Redi, in his Letters, gives another form of it, in which the
> scene is at Benevento, the agents are witches, and the hump is taken
> off, *senza verun suo dolor,* with a saw of butter. *Y* *Domingo

> \[c\] Teatro Critico, tom. ii. His object is to disprove their
> existence, and he very justly says that the Duende was usually a
> knavish servant who had his own reasons for making a noise and
> disturbing the family. This theory will also explain the Duende-tales
> of Torquemada.

> \[e\] The change of *r* and *n* is not without examples. Thus we have
> *άργυρον* and *argentum; water,* English; *vand,* Danish; *vatn,*
> Swedish.*Cristofero* is *Cristofano* in Tuscan; *homine, nomine,
> sanguine,* are *hombre, nombre, sangre,* Spanish. In *Duerg* when *r*
> became a, euphony changed g to *d,* or *vice versa.* The changes words
> undergo when the derivation is certain, are often curious. *Alguacil,*
> Spanish, is *El-wezeer* Arab, as *Azucena* Spanish, *Cecem* Portuguese
> (white-lily) is *Susan* Arab; *Guancia* (cheek) Italian, is *Wange*
> German*.* It might not be safe to assert that the Persian *gurk* and
> our wolf are the same, and yet the letters in them taken in order are
> all commutable. Our *God be with you* has shrunk to *Goodbye,* and the
> Spanish *Vuestra merced* to *Usted,* pr. *Usté.* There must, by the
> way, some time or other, have been an intimate connexion between Spain
> and England, so many of our familiar words seem to have a Spanish
> origin. Thus *ninny* is from *niño: booby* from *bobo; pucker from
> puchero; launch* (a boat) from *lancha;* and perhaps *monkey* (if not
> from *mannikin)* from *mono, monico.* We pronounce our *colonel* like
> the Spanish
>
> coronel.
