THE PHYNNODDEREE

>  

> THE Phynnodderee, or Hairy-one, is a Manks spirit of the same kind
> with the Brownie or the Kobold. He is said to have been a fairy who
> was expelled from the fairy society.

> The cause was, he courted a pretty Manx maid who lived in a bower
> beneath *the blue tree* of Glen Aldyn, and therefore was absent from
> the Fairy court during the *Re-hollys vooar yn* *ouyr,* or
> harvest-moon, being engaged dancing in the merry glen of Rushen. He is
> condemned to remain in the Isle of Man till doomsday, in a wild form,
> covered with long shaggy hair, whence his name.

> He is very kind and obliging to the people, sometimes driving home the
> sheep, or cutting and gathering the hay, if he sees a storm coming on.
> On one of these occasions, a farmer having expressed his displeasure
> with him for not having cut the grass close enough to the ground, he
> let him cut it himself the next year; but he went after him stubbing
> up the roots so fast, that it was with difficulty that the farmer
> could escape having his legs cut off. For several years no one would
> venture to mow that meadow; at length a soldier undertook it, and by
> beginning in the centre of the field, and cutting round, as if on the
> edge of a circle, keeping one eye on the scythe, and looking out for
> the Phynnodderee with the other, he succeeded in cutting the grass in
> safety.

> A gentleman having resolved to build a large house on his property, at
> a place called Sholt-e-will, near the foot of Snafield mountain,
> caused the stones to be quarried on the beach. There was one large
> block of white stone which he was very anxious to have, but all the
> men in the parish could not move it. To their surprise, the
> Phynnodderee in the course of one night conveyed all the stones that
> bad been quarried, the great white one included, up to the proposed
> site, and the white stone is there still to be seen. The gentleman, to
> reward the Phynnodderee, caused some clothes to be left for him in one
> of his usual haunts. When he saw them, he lifted them up one by one,
> saying in Mania:

> Bayrm da'n choine, dy doogh da'n choine,  
> Cooat da'n dreeym, dy doogh da'n dreeym,  
> Breechyn da'n toyn, dy doogh da'n toyn,  
> Agh my she lhiat ooiley, shoh cha nee Ihiat Glen reagh Rushen.

> Cap for the head, alas, poor head!  
> Coat for the back, alas, poor back  
> Breeches for the breech, alas, poor breech!  
> If these be all thine, thine cannot be the merry glen of Rushen.

> And he departed with a melancholy wail, and has never been seen since.
> The old people say, "There has not been a merry world since he lost
> his ground." \[a\]
