THE FAIRY-FAIR

>   
>   
> "Reading once the eighteenth of Mr. Glanvil's relations, p. 203,
> concerning an Irishman that had like to have been carried away by
> spirits, and of the banquet they had spread before them in the fields,
> etc., it called to mind a passage I had often heard, of Fairies or
> spirits, so called by the country people, which showed themselves in
> great companies at divers times. At some times they would seem to
> dance, at other times to keep a great fair or market. I made it my
> business to inquire amongst the neighbours what credit might be given
> to that which was reported of them, and by many of the neighbouring
> inhabitants I had this account confirmed.

> "The place near which they most ordinarily showed themselves was on
> the side of a hill, named Black-down, between the parishes of
> Pittminster and Chestonford, not many miles from Tanton. Those that
> have had occasion to travel that way have frequently seen them there,
> appearing like men and women, of a stature generally near the smaller
> size of men. Their habits used to be of red, blue, or green, according
> to the old way of country garb, with high crowned hats. One time,
> about fifty years since, a person living at Comb St. Nicholas, a
> parish lying on one side of that hill, near Chard, was riding towards
> his home that way, and saw, just before him, on the side of the hill,
> a great company of people, that seemed to him like country folks
> assembled as at a fair. There were all sorts of commodities, to his
> appearance, as at our ordinary fairs; pewterers, shoemakers, pedlars,
> with all kind of trinkets, fruit, and drinking-booths. He could not
> remember anything which he had usually seen at fairs but what he saw
> there. It was once in his thoughts that it might be some fair for
> Chestonford, there being a considerable one at some time of the year;
> but then again he considered that it was not the season for it. He was
> under very great surprise, and admired what the meaning of what he saw
> should be. At length it came into his mind what he had heard
> concerning the Fairies on the side of that hill, and it being near the
> road he was to take, he resolved to ride in amongst them, and see what
> they were. Accordingly he put on his horse that way, and, though he
> saw them perfectly all along as he came, yet when he was upon the
> place where all this had appeared to him, he could discern nothing at
> all, only seemed to be crowded and thrust, as when one passes through
> a throng of people. All the rest became invisible to him until he came
> to a little distance, and then it appeared to him again as at first.
> He found himself in pain, and so hastened home; where, being arrived,
> lameness seized him all on one side, which continued on him as long as
> he lived, which was many years; for he was living in Comb, and gave an
> account to any that inquired of this accident for more than twenty
> years afterwards; and this relation I had from a person of known
> honour, who had it from the man himself.

> "There were some whose names I have now forgot, but they then lived at
> a gentleman's house, named Comb Farm, near the place before specified:
> both the man, his wife, and divers of the neighbours, assured me they
> had, at many times, seen this *fair-keeping* in the summer-time, as
> they came from Tanton-market, but that they durst not adventure in
> amongst them; for that every one that had done so had received great
> damage by it."
