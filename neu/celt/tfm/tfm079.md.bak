JOURNEY OF DWARFS OVER THE MOUNTAIN

>  

> On the north side of the Hartz there dwelt several thousand Dwarfs in
> the clefts of the rocks, and in the Dwarf-caves that still remain. It
> was, however, but rarely that they appeared to the inhabitants in a
> visible form; they generally went about among them protected by their
> mist-caps; unseen and unnoticed.

> Many of these Dwarfs were good-natured, and, on particular occasions,
> very obliging to the inhabitants, who used, for instance, in case of a
> wedding or a christening, to borrow various articles for the table out
> of the caves of the Dwarfs, It was, however, highly imprudent to
> provoke their resentment; as when injured or offended, they were
> malicious and wicked, and did every possible injury to the offender.

> A baker, who lived in the valley between Blenkenburg and Quedlinburg,
> used to remark that a part of the loaves he baked was always missing,
> though he never could find out the thief. This continual secret theft
> was gradually reducing him to poverty. At last he began to suspect the
> Dwarfs of being the cause of his misfortune. He accordingly got a
> bunch of little twigs, and beating the air with them in all
> directions, at length struck the mist-caps off some Dwarfs, who could
> now conceal themselves no longer. There was a great noise made about
> it; several other Dwarfs were caught in the act of committing theft,
> and at last the whole of the Dwarf-people were forced to quit the
> country. In order, in some degree, to indemnify the inhabitants for
> what had been stolen, and at the same time to be able to estimate the
> number of those that departed, a large cask was set up on what is now
> called Kirchberg, near the village of Thele, into which each Dwarf was
> to cast a piece of money. This cask was found, after the departure of
> the Dwarfs, to be quite filled with ancient coins, so great was their
> number.

> The Dwarf-people went by Warnstadt, a village not far from Quedinburg,
> still going toward the east. Since that time the Dwarfs have
> disappeared out of this country; and it is only now and then that a
> solitary one may be seen.

>  

>  

> The Dwarfs on the south side of the Hartz were, in a similar manner,
> detected plundering the corn-fields. They also agreed to quit the
> country, and. it was settled that they should pass over a small bridge
> near Neuhof, and that each, by way of transit-duty, should cast a
> certain portion of his property into a cask to be set there. The
> peasants, on their part, covenanted not to appear or look at them.
> Some, however, had the curiosity to conceal themselves under the
> bridge, that they might at least hear them departing. They succeeded
> in their design, and heard during several hours, the trampling of the
> little men, sounding exactly as if a large flock of sheep was going
> over the bridge.

>  

>   
> Other accounts of the departure of the Dwarfs relate as follows:--

> The Dosenberg is a mountain in Hesse on the Schwalm, in which, not far
> from the bank of the stream, are two holes by which the Dwarfs \[a\]
> used to go in and out. One of them. came frequently in a friendly way
> to the grandfather of Tobi in Singlis, when he was out in his fields.
> As he was one day cutting his corn he asked him if he would the next
> night, for a good sum of money, take a freight over the river. The
> farmer agreed, and in the evening the Dwarf brought him a sack of
> wheat as an earnest. Four horses were then put to the waggon, and the
> farmer drove to the Dosenberg, out of the holes of which the Dwarf
> brought heavy, but invisible loads to the waggon, which the farmer
> then drove through the water over to the other side. He thus kept
> going backwards and forwards from ten at night till four in the
> morning, by which time the horses were quite tired. Then said the
> Dwarf; "It is enough, now you shall see what you have been carrying!"
> He bade him look over his right shoulder, and then he saw the country
> far and near filled with the Dwarfs. "These thousand years," then said
> the Dwarf, "have we dwelt in the Dosenberg; our time is now up, and we
> must go to another land. But the hill is still so full of money that
> it would suffice for the whole country." He then loaded Tobi's waggon
> with money and departed. The farmer had difficulty in bringing home so
> heavy a load, but he became a rich man. His posterity are still
> wealthy people, but the Dwarfs have disappeared out of the country for
> ever.

> At Offensen on the Aller in Lower Saxony, lived a great farmer, whose
> name was Hövermann. He had a boat on the river; and one day two little
> people came to him and asked him to put them over the water. They went
> twice over the Aller to a great tract of land that is called. the
> Allerô, which is an uncultivated plain extending so wide and far that
> one can hardly see over it. When the farmer had crossed the second
> time one of the Dwarfs said to him, "Will you have now a sum of money
> or so much a head?" "I'd rather have a sum of money," said the farmer.
> One of them took off his hat and put it on the farmer's head, and
> said, "You'd have done better to have taken so much a head." The
> farmer, who had as yet seen nothing and whose boat had gone as if
> there was nothing in it, now beheld the whole Allerô swarming
> *(krimmeln un wimmeln)* with little men. These were the Dwarfs that he
> had brought over. From that time forward the Hövermanns had the
> greatest plenty of money, but they are all now dead and gone, and the
> place is sold. But when was this? Oh! in the old time when the Dwarfs
> were in the world, but now there 's no more of them, thirty or forty
> years ago. \[b\]
