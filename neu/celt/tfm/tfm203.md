VERSES

>  

> WRITTEN AT BATH IN 1840, FOR A LITTLE BOY WHO KEPT AN ALBUM, AND WAS A
> GREAT ADMIRER OF ROBIN HOOD AND HIS MERRY MEN.

>   
> HAD the kind Muse, young friend, on me  
> Her pleasing gifts bestowed,  
> And taught to tread of poesy  
> The smooth and flowery road;

> Then should the deeds of Robin Hood,  
> And Little John, so bold,  
> And of the Friar, stout and good,  
> In numbers high be told.

> The merry greenwood should resound  
> With feats of archery,  
> And antlered deer along should bound  
> So light and gracefully!

> But vain the hopes: 'gainst Fate's decrees  
> To struggle I must cease;  
> I only can write histories  
> Of England, Rome, and Greece.
