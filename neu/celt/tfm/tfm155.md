THE FAIRY HUNT

>   
> A YOUNG sailor coming off a long voyage, though it was late at night,
> chose to land rather than lie another night in the vessel. Being
> permitted to do so, he was set on shore at Douglas. It happened to be
> a line moonlight night, and very dry, being a small frost; he
> therefore forbore going into any house to refresh himself, but made
> the best of his way to the house of a sister he had at Kirk-Merlugh.
> As he was going over a pretty high mountain, he heard the noise of
> horses, the halloo of a huntsman, and the finest horn in the world. He
> was a little surprised that any one pursued those kinds of sports in
> the night; but he had not time for much reflection before they all
> passed by him so near, that he was able to count what number there was
> of them, which he said was thirteen, and that they were all dressed in
> green, and gallantly mounted. He was so well pleased with the sight,
> that he would gladly have followed could he have kept pace with them.
> He crossed the footway, however, that he might see them again, which
> he did more than once, and lost not the sound of the horn for some
> miles. At length being arrived at his sister's, he tells her the
> story, who presently clapped her hands for joy that he was come home
> safe; "for," said she, "those you saw were *fairies*, and 'tis well
> they did not take you away with them."
