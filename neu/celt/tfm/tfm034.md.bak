THE LEGEND OF BODEDYS.

>  

> THERE is a hill called Bodedys close to the road in the neighbourhood
> of Lynge, that is near Soröe. Not far from it lived an old farmer,
> whose only son was used to take long journeys on business. His father
> had for a long time heard no tidings of him, and the old man became
> convinced that his son was dead. This caused him much affliction, as
> was natural for an old man like him, and thus some time passed over.

> One evening as he was coining with a loaded cart by Bodedys, the hill
> opened, and the Troll came out and desired him to drive his cart into
> it. The poor man was; to be sure, greatly amazed at this, but well
> knowing how little it would avail him to refuse to comply with the
> Troll's request, he turned about his horses, and drove his cart
> straight into the hill. The Troll now began to deal with him for his
> goods, and finally bought and paid him honestly for his entire cargo.
> When he had finished the unloading of his vehicle, and was about to
> drive again out of the hill, the Troll said to him, "If you will now
> only keep a silent tongue in your head about all that has happened to
> you, I shall from this time out have an eye to your interest; and if
> you come here again to-morrow morning, it may be you shall get your
> son." The farmer did not well know at first what to say to all this;
> but as he was, however, of opinion that the Troll was able to perform
> what he had promised, he was greatly rejoiced, and failed not to come
> at the appointed time to Bodedys.

> He sat there waiting a long time, and at last he fell asleep, and when
> he awoke from his slumber, behold! there was his son lying by his
> side. Both father and son found it difficult to explain how this had
> come to pass. The son related how he had been thrown into, prison, and
> had there suffered great hardship and distress; but that one night,
> while he was lying asleep in his cell, there came a man to him, who
> said, "Do you still love your father?" And when he had answered that
> he surely did, his chains fell off and the wall burst open. While he
> was telling this he chanced to put his hand up to his neck, and he
> found that he had brought a piece of the iron chain away with him.
> They both were for some time mute through excess of wonder; and they
> then arose and went straightway to Lynge, where they hung up the piece
> of the chain in the church, as a memorial of the wonderful event that
> had occurred. \[a\]
