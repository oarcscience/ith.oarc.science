# Preface

> <span id="img_10"></span> ![](img/p10.jpg)

> A PREFACE is to a book what a prologue is to a play--a usual, often
> agreeable, but by no means necessary precursor. It may therefore be
> altered or omitted at pleasure. I have at times exercised this right,
> and this is the third I have written for the present work.

> In the first, after briefly stating what had given occasion to it, I
> gave the germs of the theory which I afterwards developed in the
> *Tales and Popular Fictions*. \[a\] The second contained the following
> paragraph:

> "I never heard of any one who read it that was not pleased with it. It
> was translated into German as soon as it appeared, and was very
> favourably received. Goethe thought well of it. Dr. Jacob
> Grimm--perhaps the first authority on these matters in Europe--wrote
> me a letter commending it, and assuring me that even to *him* it
> offered something new; and I was one Christmas most agreeably
> surprised by the receipt of a letter from Vienna, from the celebrated
> orientalist, Jos Von Hammer, informing me that it had been the
> companion of a journey he had lately made to his native province of
> Styria, and had afforded much pleasure and information to himself and
> to some ladies of high rank and cultivated minds in that country. The
> initials at the end of the preface, he said, led him to suppose it was
> a work of mine. So far for the Continent. In this country, when I
> mention the name of Robert Southey as that of one who has more than
> once expressed his decided approbation of this performance, I am sure
> I shall have said quite enough to satisfy any one that the work is not
> devoid of merit."

> I could now add many names of distinguished persons who have been
> pleased with this work and its pendant, the *Tales and Popular
> Fictions*. I shall only mention that of the late Mr. Douce, who, very
> shortly before his death, on the occasion of the publication of this
> last work, called on me to assure me that "it was many, many years
> indeed, since he had read a book which had yielded him so much
> delight."

> The contents of the work which gave such pleasure to this learned
> antiquary are as follows:--

> I Introduction--Similarity of Arts and Customs--Similarity of
> Names--Origin of the Work--Imitation--Casual
> Coincidence--Milton--Dante. II. The Thousand and One Nights--Bedoween
> Audience around a Story-teller--Cleomades and Claremond--Enchanted
> Horses--Peter of Provence and the fair Maguelone. IlI The Pleasant
> Nights--The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Beautiful Green
> Bird--The Three Little Birds--Lactantius--Ulysses and Sindbad. IV. The
> Shah-Nameh--Roostem and Soohrab--Conloch and Cuchullin--Macpherson's
> Ossian--Irish Antiquities. V. The Pentamerone--Tale of the
> Serpent--Hindoo Legend. VI. Jack the Giant-killer--The Brave
> Tailoring--Thor's Journey to Utgard--Ameen of Isfshan and the
> Ghool--The Lion and the Goat--The Lion and the Ass. VII Whittington
> and his Cat--Danish Legends--Italian Stories--Persian Legend. VIII.
> The Edda--Sigurd and Brynhilda--Volund--Helgi--Holger--Danske--Ogier
> le Danois--Toko--William Tell. IX. Peruonto--Peter the Fool--Emelyan
> the Fool--Conclusion. Appendix.

> Never, I am convinced, did any one enter on a literary career with
> more reluctance than I did when I found it to be my only
> resource--fortune being gone, ill health and delicacy of constitution
> excluding me from the learned professions, want of interest from every
> thing else. As I journeyed to the metropolis, I might have sung with
> the page whom Don Quixote met going a-soldiering:

> A Ia guerra me lieva--mi necesidad,  
> Si tuviera dineros--no fuera en verdad:

> for of all arts and professions in this country, that of literature is
> the least respected and the worst remunerated. There is something
> actually degrading in the expression "an author by trade," which I
> have seen used even of Southey, and that by one who did not mean to
> disparage him in the slightest degree. My advice to those who may read
> these pages is to shun literature, if not already blest with
> competence.

> One of my earliest literary friends in London was T. Crofton Croker,
> who was then engaged in collecting materials for the *Fairy Legends of
> the South of Ireland*. He of course applied to his friends for aid and
> information; and I, having most leisure, and, I may add, most
> knowledge, was able to give him the greatest amount of assistance. My
> inquiries on the subject led, to the writing of the present work,
> which was succeeded by the *Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy*,
> and the *Tales and Popular Fictions*; so that, in effect, if Mr.
> Croker had not planned the *Fairy Legends*, these works, be their
> value what it may, would in all probability never have been written.

> Writing and reading about Fairies some may deem to be the mark of a
> trilling turn of mind. On this subject I have given my ideas in the
> Conclusion; here I will only remind such critics, that as soon as this
> work was completed, I commenced, and wrote in the space of a few
> weeks, my *Outlines of History*; and whatever the faults of that work
> may be, no one has ever reckoned among them want of vigour in either
> thought or expression.. It was also necessary, in order to write this
> work and its pendent, to be able to read, perhaps, as many as eighteen
> or twenty different languages, dialects, and modes of orthography, and
> to employ different styles both in prose and verse. At all events,
> even if it were trifling, *dulce est despere in loco;* and I shall
> never forget the happy hours it caused me, especially those spent over
> the black-letter pages of the French romances of chivalry, in the old
> reading-room of the British Museum.

> Many years have elapsed since this work was first published. In that
> period much new matter has appeared in various works, especially in
> the valuable Deutsche Mythologie of Dr. Grimm. Hence it will be found
> to be greatly enlarged, particularly in the sections of England and
> Prance. I have also inserted much which want of space obliged me to
> omit in the former edition. In its present form, I am presumptuous
> enough to expect that it may live for many years, and be an authority
> on the subject of popular lore. The active industry of the Grimms, of
> Thiele, and others, had collected the popular traditions of various
> countries. I came then and gathered in the harvest, leaving little, I
> apprehend, but gleanings for future writers on this subject. The
> legends will probably fade fast away from the popular memory; it is
> not likely that any one will relate those which I have given over
> again; and it therefore seems more probable that this volume may in
> future be reprinted, with notes and additions. For human nature will
> ever remain unchanged; the love of gain and of material enjoyments,
> omnipotent as it appears to be at present, will never totally
> extinguish the higher and purer aspirations of mind; and there will
> always be those, however limited in number, who will desire to know
> how the former dwellers of earth thought, felt, and acted. For these
> mythology, as connected with religion and history, will always have
> attractions.
