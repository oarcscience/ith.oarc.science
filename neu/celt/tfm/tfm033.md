SKOTTE IN THE FIRE

>  

> NEAR Gudmanstrup, in the district of Odd, is a bill called Hjulehöi
> *(Hollow-hill).* The hill-folk that dwell in this mount are well known
> in all the villages round, and no one ever omits making a cross on his
> beer-barrels, for the Trolls are in the habit of slipping down from
> Hjulehöi to steal beer.

> One evening late a farmer was passing by the bill, and he saw that it
> was raised up on red pillars, and that underneath there was music and
> dancing and a splendid Troll banquet. The man stood a long time gazing
> on their festivity; but while he was standing there, deeply absorbed
> in admiration of what he saw, all of a sudden the dancing stopped, and
> the music ceased, and he heard a Troll cry out, in a tone of the
> utmost anguish, "Skotte is fallen into the fire! Come and help him
> up!" The hill then sank, and all the merriment was at an end.

> Meanwhile the farmer's wife was at home all alone, and while she was
> sitting and spinning her tow, she never noticed a Troll who had crept
> through the window into the next room, and was at the beer-barrel
> drawing off the liquor into his copper kettle. The room-door was
> standing open, and the Troll kept a steady eye on the woman. The
> husband now came into the house full of wonder at what he had seen and
> heard. "Hark ye, dame," he began, "listen now till I tell you what has
> happened to me!" The Troll redoubled his attention. "As I came just
> now by Hjulehöi;" continued he, "I saw a great Troll-banquet there,
> but while they were in the very middle of their glee they shouted out
> within in the hill, 'Skotte is fallen into the fire; come and help him
> up!"

> At hearing this, the Troll, who was standing beside the beer-barrel,
> was so frightened, that he let the tap run and the kettle of beer fall
> on the ground, and tumbled himself out of the window as quickly as
> might be. The people of the house hearing all this noise instantly
> guessed what had been going on inside; and when they went in they saw
> the beer all running about, and found the copper kettle lying on the
> floor. This they seized, and kept in lieu of the beer that bad been
> spilled; and the same kettle is said to have been a long time to be
> seen in the villages round about there. \[a\]

> \[a\] *Oral.* Gudmanstrup is in Zealand. In Ouröe, a little Island
> close to Zealand, there is a hill whence the Trolls used to come down
> and supply themselves with provisions out of the farmers' pantries.
> Niel Jensen, who lived close to the hill, finding that they were
> making, as he thought, over free with his provisions, took the liberty
> of putting a lock on the door through which they had access. But he
> had better have left it alone, for his daughter grew stone blind, and
> never recovered her sight till the lock was removed.--*Resenii Atlas,*
> i. 10. There is a similar story in Grimm's Deutsche Sagen, i. p. 55.
