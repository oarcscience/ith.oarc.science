THE BROKEN OATHS

>  

> THERE was a man who was very rich, and who had but one only son. He
> bestowed upon him every kind of instruction, so that he became very
> leaned and of great talent.

> Before his death the old man gave a great entertainment, and invited
> all the chief people of the city; and when the entertainment was over,
> he called his son, and made him swear, in the name of the great God of
> the whole universe<sub>5</sub> that he never would travel or go out of
> his own country. He then left him the whole of his riches on this
> condition, and made him sign a paper to that effect, with sufficient
> witnesses, in the presence of all that company, and he gave the paper
> into the custody of one of the principal persons.

> Some years after the death of his father, there came a very large ship
> from India, laden with merchandise of great value. The captain when he
> arrived inquired after the father of this young man, and the people
> said unto him that he was dead, but that he had left a son, and. they
> conducted the captain to the young man's dwelling. The captain then
> said unto him, "Sir, I have brought hither much property belonging to
> thy father, and as there is much property of thy father's still
> remaining, if thou wilt come with me, thou wilt be able to obtain much
> riches, for thou canst recover all that is owing unto thy father." He
> made answer unto the captain and said, that he could not travel, as he
> had taken an oath unto his father that he never would go out of the
> country. The captain, however, ceased not every day to persuade him,
> until at length he gave him his word that he would go with him. He
> then went unto the learned Rabbin that were at that time, to see if
> they would give him absolution respecting the oath be had sworn unto
> his father. But they counselled him not to leave the country. But his
> eagerness to acquire more riches was so great, that he would not
> hearken unto the counsel of any one. So he finally took his
> resolution, and went away with the captain.

> Now, when they were in the midst of the sea, lo! the ship went to
> pieces, and all the merchandise that was on board was lost, and all
> the people were drowned, save only this young man, who got upon a
> plank. And the water carried him about from one place unto another,
> until it cast him upon the land. But here he was in danger of
> starving, and had nothing to eat but the herbs of the field, or to
> drink but the running water.

> One day an exceeding large eagle drew near unto him, and seated
> himself on the ground before him. As he was now reduced to despair,
> and had little hopes of being able to preserve his life, and knew not
> where be was, be resolved to mount this eagle, and to sit upon his
> back. He accordingly mounted the bird, and the eagle flew with him
> until he brought him unto a country that was inhabited, where he left
> him. \[a\] When he saw that he was in a land where there were people,
> he was greatly rejoiced, and he immediately inquired where the great
> Rabbi of that country dwelt. But all the people that were there stood
> mocking at him, and cursing him, and saying that he should die,
> because be had broken the oath he had sworn unto his father. When he
> heard this be was greatly astonished at their knowing it, but he went
> to the house of the chief person among them who said unto him that he
> should abide in his house until they did him justice, because in that
> country they were all Mazikeen, and they wanted to kill him because he
> deserved death on account of the oath to his father, which he had
> broken. "Therefore," said he, "when they will sentence thee, and will
> lead thee forth to punishment, cry aloud and say, I call for justice
> before God and the king! The king will then do his utmost to deliver
> thee out of their hands, and thou wilt remain alive."

> Accordingly, when he was tried before the senate, and before their
> princes and great men, he was found guilty, and sentenced to death,
> according to the law of God. And when they led him forth to be slain,
> he put his fingers before God, and before his majesty the king. \[b\]
> When they heard this, they took him before the king, who examined him,
> and saw that, in justice, he was worthy of death. But the king asked
> him if he had studied or knew the law of Moses, or had studied the
> Talmud, and various authors; and he saw that he was very learned, and
> a great Rabbi, and it grieved him much that he should be put to death.
> The king, therefore, begged that they would defer his execution until
> the following day, for he wished to give his case a little further
> consideration. At this they all held their peace, and departed.

> Next day all the senators, governors, chief men, and all the people of
> the city, came together to see and hear the sentence of the king, and
> also to behold the death of this man, as it would be for them a very
> curious sight. Now, while they were all standing there assembled,
> before the king came forth from his palace to give his judgement, he
> called for this man who was condemned to death, and asked him if he
> was willing to remain with him and teach his children what he knew,
> as, in such case, he would do his utmost to deliver him from death. He
> made answer that he was willing. The king then went forth from his
> palace, and seated himself upon his throne of judgement, and called
> all the chief men, and all the people, and spake unto them in this
> sort:--

> "Sirs, it is a truth that you have adjudged this man to death, which
> he deserves: but there is no rule without an exception, and I believe
> that this man hath not yet come to his time that he should die. For if
> it was the will of God that he should die, he would have died along
> with the rest of the people who were on board the same ship with him
> when the ship went to pieces, and not have escaped as he hath done.
> Again, if it was the will of God that he should die, he would not have
> reached the land, and an eagle would not have come and brought him
> hither amongst us. In like manner, God hath delivered him from you,
> for he might have been slain by you. He hath thus been delivered out
> of these manifold and great perils, and it therefore seemeth unto me
> that he should live; as for the sin that he hath committed, in
> breaking his oath, it is between him and God, who shall reward him for
> it one day or other. He shall therefore be free from us; and I ordain
> that no one shall touch him, or do him any evil; and whosoever
> troubleth him shall be put to death."

> When they heard these words of the king, they all expressed themselves
> well pleased at his decision; and the man remained in the house of the
> king, teaching his children. He continued in the palace for three
> years, highly respected by every one, and greatly esteemed by the king
> for his talents and his capacity.

> Now it came to pass that the king was obliged to set forth with an
> army, to war against one of the provinces of his kingdom which had
> rebelled. As he was on the point to set out, he called for this man,
> and gave him all the keys of his palaces and his treasures, and said
> unto him, "Behold! thou mayest view every thing that is in the land
> and in the palaces; but thou hast here a golden key of one palace
> which thou must beware of opening, for on the day that thou openest it
> I will slay thee." Then, charging the people to respect and attend to
> him, the king took his leave of him and departed. When the king was
> gone, he began to open and. examine all the palaces, and all the
> curiosities, which were such as he had never seen in his life, and all
> the treasures of the greatest riches that could be in the world; in
> short, he saw mountains upon mountains of diamonds of great weight,
> and. other things of various kinds, most admirable to behold. But when
> he had seen all, he was not satisfied; be wanted to see more. And as
> his desire was very great, he would open the other palace; and he
> thought he should suffer no injury thereby, so that he resolved to
> open it. Five or six times he drew nigh to open it, and as often he
> drew back in fear at length he took courage and opened it.

> There were seven apartments, one within the other, and. every
> apartment was full of different rich and curious things. In the
> seventh apartment was the princess, with other women, all richly
> dressed, and very beautiful. When the princess saw him, she gave a
> sigh, and said, "Man, it grieveth me for thee! how art thou come
> hither? Where is thy regard for the advice of my father, who entreated
> thee not to open this palace, when he gave thee the keys of his
> palaces and his treasures, and straitly charged thee not to come
> hither? Know now that my father is coming, and that he will surely
> slay thee. But if thou wilt follow my counsel, and wilt espouse me, I
> will save thee; but thou must give unto me thy oath, that thou wilt do
> it." He replied that he would, and he aware unto her, and gave it unto
> her in writing. She then said. unto him, "When my father asketh thee
> why thou hast opened the palace, thou shalt make answer, and say that
> thou desirest to marry me, and then he will let thee escape, and not
> slay thee."

> He had scarcely ended speaking with her, when the king entered, with
> his sword drawn in his hand, to slay him. Then he threw himself on the
> ground, and began to entreat him, and. said that he was desirous to
> marry the princess. When the king heard this, he was rejoiced that he
> would remain there, and so teach his children all the knowledge he
> possessed; for he was of great capacity in everything. He therefore
> told him, that he would leave it to his daughter, whether she would
> have him or not. The king then asked his daughter, and she replied,
> "What your majesty doth for me is well done." The king then gave his
> consent for her marriage with him. The contract was made, and. notice
> was given to all the chief persons of the city, and the wedding was
> appointed. to be in two months.

> When the appointed. time was come, all the chief men of all the
> provinces of the kingdom were invited, and. a great feast was made to
> celebrate the marriage of the princess; and they were married to their
> great joy and. happiness.

> On the first night of their marriage, when the husband and the wife
> were alone, she said unto him, "Behold! I am not like one of you, and
> thou seest that, thanks be unto God! there is no defect in my body; if
> therefore, though we have been publicly married with the consent of my
> father, thou art not content to live with me as husband and wife, thou
> art at liberty, and no one shall know it; but if thou art content with
> all thy will, thou must swear unto me that thou wilt never leave me."
> He replied, that he was well content with everything; and. he aware

> years, and they had children; and his first-born he named Solomon,

> Immediately after the marriage, the king caused it to be proclaimed.
> that his son-in-law should be the second person in the kingdom to give
> judgement, and to punish such as should be deserving of punishment.
> This the king did. with the consent of all the great men of the

> But, after some years, this man began to be very anxious and

> yet she persuaded him so much, that at length he told it unto her, and

> canst see them." He answered, "If thou wilt do me this favour and
> grace, I shall thank thee much." She asked him how long he wished to
> stay with his wife and children, and he answered, three months; but
> she said, "No; I will give thee the space of a year, on condition,
> that as soon as the year is expired thou return again unto me." He
> answered, "If thou show me this favour, I will do all that thou wilt

> then aware, and wrote it down on paper, and gave it unto her.

> She then called one of her servants, and ordered him to convey him to

> He remained, then, very happy with his family; but at the end of the

> had nothing to do with them, as he was a man, and had nothing more to

> His mother was then obliged to go herself with her great army. When

> In the morning she arose with her son Solomon, and went unto the great
