FINNS

>  

> Bee! thou little mundane bird!  
> Fly away to where I bid thee;  
> O'er the moon, beneath the sun,  
> Behind the lofty heaven's stars,  
> Close by the Wain's axle--fly  
> To the great Creator's court.  
> Finnish Rune.

> OF the mythology of the Finnish race, the first possibly that appeared
> in Europe, and. one of the most widely spread in the world, our
> knowledge, as we have just stated, is very slight. It appears,
> however, either to have influenced that of the Gothic race, or to have
> been affected by it.

> The Finlanders, Laplanders, and other nations of this race, who are
> neighbours of the Scandinavians and Germans, believe, like them, in
> Dwarfs and Kobolds. The former they describe as having a magnificent
> region under the ground, to which mortals are sometimes admitted and
> are there sumptuously entertained, getting plenty of tobacco and
> brandy, and other things esteemed by them delicious.

> It is an article of faith with the Finns that there dwell under the
> altar in every church little misshapen beings which they call
> *Kirkonwaki, i. e.,* Church-folk. When the wives of these little
> people have a difficult labour they are relieved if a Christian woman
> visits them and lays her hand upon them. Such service is always
> rewarded by a gift of gold and silver. \[a\]

> The Kobold of Finland is called Para (from the Swedish Bjära); he
> steals the milk from other people's cows, carries and coagulates it in
> his stomach, and then disgorges it into the churn of his mistress.
> There is a species of mushroom, which if it be fried with tar, salt
> and sulphur, and then beaten with a rod, the woman who owns the Kobold
> will quickly appear, and entreat to spare him.

> The Alp, or nightmare, is called Painajainen, *i.* *e.,* Presser. It
> resembles a white maid, and its brightness illumines the whole room.
> It causes people to scream out wofully; it also hurts young children,
> and' makes them squint. The remedy against it is *steel* or a broom
> placed under the pillow. The House-spirit named Touttu (the Swedish
> Tomtegubbe) is also common in Finland. \[b\] The Esthonians believe
> that the Neck has fish's teeth.

> An Esthonian legend relates that one time a girl was stopt by a pretty
> boy that had on him a handsome peasant's belt and forced to scratch
> his head a little. She did so, and while she was so engaged she was,
> without her knowledge, fastened to him by his belt, but the rubbing of
> her hand set him to sleep. Meanwhile a woman passed by, who came up
> and asked the girl what she was doing there. She told her the whole
> matter, and as she was speaking she freed herself from the belt. The
> boy, however, slept sounder than ever and his mouth was wide open. The
> woman who had come nearer cried at once, Ha! that's a *Näkki* (Neck,)
> see his *fish's teeth!* The Neck instantly vanished. \[c\]

> The following Esthonian legend, though the Devil is the subject,
> strongly resembles some of those of France and Great Britain:

> A man who had charge of the granary of a farm-house was sitting one
> day moulding buttons in lead. The Devil came by, saluted him, and
> said, "What are you doing there?" "I am moulding eyes." "Eyes! could
> you make me new ones?" "To be sure I could; but I have none by me at
> present." "Will you then do it another time?" "That will I." "When
> shall I come again?" "Whenever you please." Next day the Devil came to
> get his new eyes. "Will you have them large or small?" said the man.
> "Very large." The man then put a large quantity of lead down to melt,
> and said, "I cannot make them for you, unless you first let me tie you
> fast." He then made him lie on his back on a bench and tied him down
> with good strong thick ropes. When the Devil was thus fast bound he
> asked the man what his name was. "My name is Myself *(Issi),"* replied
> he. "That's a good name, I know none better." The lead was now melted;
> the Devil opened his eyes as wide as he could, expecting to get the
> new ones. "Now, I'm going to pour it out," said the. man, and he
> poured the melting lead into the eyes of the Devil, who jumped up with
> the bench on his back, and ran away. As he passed by some people who
> were ploughing, they asked him "Who did that to you?" "Myself did it
> *(Issi teggi),"* replied the Devil. The people laughed and said, "If
> you did it yourself; keep it yourself." The Devil died of his new
> eyes, and since then no one has seen the Devil any more. \[d\]

> The Hungarians or Madyars (Magyars) as they call them-selves, are, as
> we have seen, a portion of the Finnish race, Two collections of their
> popular tales have been published of late years. The editor of one of
> them which we have read, \[e\] assures us that he took them from the
> lips of an old Hungarian soldier, who knew no language but his own, We
> therefore cannot but regard the tales as genuine, though the mode and
> tone in which they are narrated by the editor are not always the best.
> They contain no traits of popular mythology,--a circumstance not a
> little remarkable, rather resembling the French and Italian Fairy
> tales. Several of them, however, are very pleasing. We regret that we
> have not seen the other collection, which is apparently of greater
> value. \[f\]
