THE DWARFS BORROWING BREAD

>  

> ALBERT STEFFEL, aged seventy years, who died in the year 1680, and
> Hans Kohmann, aged thirty-six, who died in 1679, two honest, veracious
> men, frequently declared that as one time Kohmann's grandfather was
> working in his ground which lay in the neighbourhood of the place
> called the Dwarfs' hole, and his wife had brought out to the field to
> him for his breakfast some fresh baked bread, and had laid it, tied up
> in a napkin, at the end of the field, there came up soon after a
> little Dwarf-woman, who spoke to him about his bread, saying, that her
> own was in the oven, and that her children were hungry and could not
> wait for it, but that if he would give her his, she would be certain
> to replace it by noon. The man consented, and at noon she returned,
> spread out a very white little cloth, and laid on it a smoking hot
> loaf, and with many thanks and entreaties told him he might eat the
> bread without any apprehension, and that she would return for the
> cloth. He did as she desired, and when she returned she told him that
> there had been so many forges erected that she was quite annoyed, and
> would be obliged to depart and abandon her favourite dwelling. She
> also said that the shocking cursing and swearing of the people drove
> her away, as also the profanation of Sunday, as the country people,
> instead of going to church, used to go look at their fields, which was
> altogether sinful. \[a\]

> \[a\] In Scandinavia the Dwarfs used to borrow beer, even a barrel at
> a time, which one of them would carry off on his shoulders, Thiele i.
> 121. In the Highlands of Scotland, a firlot of meal. In all cases they
> paid honestly. On one occasion, a dwarf came to a lady named Fru
> *(Mrs.)* Mettè of Overgaard, in Jutland, and asked her to lend her
> silk gown to Fru Mettè of Undergaard, for her wedding. She gave it,
> but as it was not returned as soon as she expected, she went to the
> hill and demanded it aloud. The hill-man brought it out to her all
> spotted with wax, and told her that if she had not been so impatient.
> every spot on it would have been a diamend. Thiele iii. 48.

> The Vends of Lüneburg, we are told, called the underground folk
> Görzoni (from *gora*, hill), and the hills are still shown in which
> they dwelt. They used to borrow bread from people; they intimated
> their desire invisibly, and people used to lay it for them outside of
> the door. In the evening they returned it, knocking at the window, and
> leaving an additional cake to express their thankfulness, Grimm, Deut,
> Mythol., p. 423.
