WEDDING-FEAST OF THE LITTLE PEOPLE

>  

> THE little people of the Eilenburg in Saxony had occasion to celebrate
> a wedding, and. with that intent passed one night through the key-hole
> and the window-slits into the castle-hall, and jumped down on the
> smooth level floor like peas on a barn floor. The noise awoke the old
> count, who was sleeping in the hall in his high four-post bed, and on
> opening his eyes, he wondered not a little at the sight of such a
> number of the little fellows.

> One of them appareled as a herald came up to him, and addressing him
> with the utmost courtesy and in very polite terms invited him to share
> in their festivity. "We, however," added he, "have one request to
> make, which is, that you alone should be present, and that none of
> your people should presume to look on with you, or to cast so much as
> one glance." The old count answered in a friendly tone, "Since you
> have disturbed my sleep, I will join your company." A little small
> woman was now introduced to him; little torch-bearers took their
> places; and cricket-music struck up. The count found great difficulty
> to keep from losing the little woman in the dance, she jumped away
> from him so lightly, and at last whirled him about at such a rave that
> he could with difficulty recover his breath.

> But in the very middle of their spritely dance, suddenly all became
> still, the music ceased, and the whole company hurried to the slits of
> the doors, mouse-holes, and everywhere else where there was a corner
> to slip into. The bride-pair, the heralds, and dancers, looked upwards
> to a hole that was in the ceiling of the hail, and there discovered
> the face of the old countess, who overflowing with curiosity, was
> looking down on the joyous assembly. They then bowed themselves before
> the count, and the person who had invited him stept forward again and
> thanked him for the hospitality he had shown them: "But," said he,
> "since our wedding and our festivity has been thus disturbed by
> another eye gazing on it, your race shall henceforward never count
> more than seven Eilenburgs." They then pressed out after one another
> with great speed, and soon all was silent, and the old count alone in
> the dark ball. The curse has lasted till the present time, and one of
> six living knights of Eilenburg has always died before the seventh was
> born. \[a\]
