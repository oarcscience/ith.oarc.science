THE DWARF HUSBAND

>  

> A POOR girl went out one day and as she was passing by a hill she
> heard a Dwarf hammering away inside of it, for they are handy smiths,
> and singing at his work. She was so pleased with the song, that she
> could not refrain from wishing aloud that she could sing like him, and
> live like him under the round. Scarcely had she expressed the wish
> when the singing ceased, and a voice came out of the hill, saying,
> "Should you like to live with us?"' "To be sure I should," replied the
> girl, who probably had no very happy life of it above ground.
> Instantly the Dwarf came out of the hill and made a declaration of
> love, and a proffer of his hand and a share in his subterranean
> wealth. She accepted the offer and lived very comfortably with him, as
> he proved an excellent little husband.
