SMITH RIECHERT

>  

> ON the east side of the Dwarf-hill of Dardesheim there is a piece of
> arable land. A smith named Riechert had sown this field with peas; but
> he observed that when they were just in perfection they were pulled in
> great quantities. Riechert built himself a little hut on his ground,
> there to lie in wait for the thief; and there he watched day and
> night. In the daytime he could see no alteration, but every morning he
> found that, notwithstanding all his watchfulness, the field had been
> plundered during the night. Vexed to the heart at seeing that all his
> labour was in vain, he determined to thresh out on the ground what
> remained of the peas. So with the daybreak Smith Riechert commenced
> his work. Hardly was one half of his peas threshed when he heard a
> piteous wailing, and on going to look for the cause, be found on the
> ground under the peas one of the dwarfs whose skull he had rapped with
> his flail, and who was now visible, having lost his mist-cap with the
> blow. The Dwarf ran back into the hill as fast as his legs could carry
> him.

> However, little tiffs like this disturbed but for a very short time
> the good understanding of the Dwarf-people and the inhabitants. But
> the Dwarfs emigrated at last, because the tricks and scoffs of several
> of the inhabitants were become no longer bearable, as well as their
> ingratitude for several services they had rendered them. Since that
> time no one has ever heard or seen anything of the Dwarfs in the
> neighbourhood.
