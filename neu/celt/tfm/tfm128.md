THE CHANGELING

>  

> BUT the Fairies of Scotland were not, even according to Mr. Cromek,
> uniformly benevolent. Woman and child abstraction was by no means
> uncommon with them, and the substitutes they provided were, in
> general, but little attractive.

> A fine child at Caerlaveroc, in Nithsdale, was observed on the second
> day after its birth, and before it was baptised, to have become quite
> ill-favoured and deformed. Its yelling every night deprived the whole
> family of rest; it bit and tore its mother a breasts, and would lie
> still neither in the cradle nor the arms. The mother being one day
> obliged to go from home, left it in charge of the servant girl. The
> poor lass was sitting bemoaning herself--" Were it nae for thy girning
> face, I would knock the big, winnow the corn, and grun the meal."--"
> Lowse the cradle-band," said the child, "and tent the neighbours, and
> I'll work yere work." Up he started--the wind arose--the corn was
> chopped--the outlyers were foddered--the hand-mill moved around, as by
> instinct--and the knocking-mill did its work with amazing rapidity.
> The lass and child then rested and diverted themselves, till, on the
> approach of the mistress, it was restored to the cradle, and renewed
> its cries. The girl took the first opportunity of telling the
> adventure to her mistress.

> "What'II we do with the wee diel?" said she. "I 'II work it a pirn,"
> replied the lass. At midnight the chimney-top was covered up, and
> every chink and cranny stopped. The fire was blown till it was glowing
> hot, and the maid speedily undressed the child, and tossed him on the
> burning coals. He shrieked and yelled in the most dreadful manner, and
> in an instant the Fairies were heard moaning on every side, and
> rattling at the windows, door, and chimney. "In the name of God bring
> back the bairn," cried the lass. The window flew up, the real child
> was laid on the mother's lap, and the *wee diel* flew up the chimney
> laughing.
