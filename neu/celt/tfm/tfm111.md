THE GRANT

>   
>   
> "THERE is," says he, again \[a\] "in England a certain kind of demon
> whom in their language they call Grant, \[b\] like a yearling foal,
> erect on its hind legs, with sparkling eyes. This kind of demon often
> appears in the streets in the heat of the day, or about sunset. If
> there is any danger impending on the following day or night, it runs
> about the streets provoking the dogs to bark, and, by feigning flight,
> draws the dogs after it, in the vain hope of catching it. This
> illusion warns the inhabitants to beware of fire, and the friendly
> demon, while he terrifies those who see him, puts by his coining the
> ignorant on their guard."

> \*\*\*

> Thus far the Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire, and, except in the
> poets, we have met with no further account of, or allusion to,
> fairies, until the reign of Elizabeth, when a little work appeared,
> named, The mad Pranks and merry Jests of Robin Goodfellow, \[c\] from
> which Shakespeare seems in a good measure to have derived his Puck.

> This work consists of two parts. In the first we are informed that
> Robin was the offspring of a "proper young wench by a hee-fayrie, a
> king or something of that kin among them." By the time he was six
> years old he was so mischievous and unlucky that his mother found it
> necessary to promise him a whipping. He ran away and engaged with a
> tailor, from whom also he soon eloped. When tired he sat down and fell
> asleep, and in his sleep he had a vision of fairies; and when he awoke
> he found lying beside him a scroll, evidently left by his father,
> which, in verses written in letters of gold, informed him that he
> should have any thing he wished for, and have also the power of
> turning himself "To horse, to hog, to dog, to ape," etc., but he was
> to harm none but knaves and queans, and was to "love those that honest
> be, and help them in necessity." He made trials of his power and found
> that be really possessed it. His first exploit was to turn himself
> into a horse, to punish a churlish clown, whom he induced to mount
> him, and gave him a fall that went well nigh to break his neck. The
> fellow then went to ride him through a great plash of water, "and in
> the middle of it he found himself with nothing but a pack-saddle
> between his legs, while Robin went off laughing, *Ho, ho, hoh!* He
> next exerted himself in the cause of two young lovers, and secured
> their happiness.

> In the Second Part we find him more in the character of the Nis or
> Brownie. Coming to a farmer's house, he takes a liking to a "good
> handsome maid," that was there, and in the night does her work for
> her, at breaking hemp and flax, bolting meal, etc. Having watched one
> night and seen him at work, and observed that he was rather bare of
> clothes, she provided him with a waistcoat against the next night. But
> when he saw it he started and said:-

> Because thou layest me himpen hampen  
> I will neither bolt nor stampen:  
> 'Tis not your garments, new or old,  
> That Robin loves: I feel no cold.  
> Had you left me milk or cream,  
> You should have had a pleasing dream:  
> Because you left no drop or crum,  
> Robin never more will come.

> He went off laughing *Ho, ho, hoh!* and the maid in future had to do
> all the work herself.

> A company of young fellows who had been making merry with their
> sweethearts were coming home over a heath. Robin met them, and to make
> himself merry took the form of a *walking fire,* and led them up and
> down till daylight, and then went off saying:--

> Get you home, you merry lads:  
> Tell your mammies and your dads,  
> And all those that news desire,  
> How you saw a walking fire.  
> Wenches that do smile and lispe,  
> Use to call me Willy Wispe.  
> If that you but weary be,  
> It is sport alone for me.  
> Away: unto your houses go,  
> And I'll go laughing,
>
> Ho, ho, hoh!

> A fellow was attempting to offer violence to a young maiden. Robin
> came to her aid, ran between his legs in the shape of a hare, then
> turning himself into a horse, carried him off on his back, and flung
> him into a thick hedge.

> Robin fell in love with a weaver's pretty wife, and for her sake took
> service with her husband. The man caught them one day kissing, and
> next night he went and took Robin as he was sleeping, up out of his
> bed, and went to the river and threw him in. But instantly he heard
> behind him--

> For this your service, master, I you thank.  
> Go swim yourself; I'll stay upon the bank;

> and was pushed in by Robin, who had put a bag of yarn in his bed, and
> now went off with,
>
> Ho, ho, hoh!

> Robin went as a fiddler to a wedding. When the candles came he blew
> them out, and giving the men boxes in the ears he set them a-fighting.
> He kissed the prettiest girls, and pinched the others, till he made
> them scratch one another like cats. When the posset was brought forth,
> he turned himself into a bear, and frightening them away, had it all
> to himself.

> At length his father who we now find, was king Obreon (i. e. Oberon),
> \[d\] called him up out of his bed one night, and took him to where
> the fairies were dancing to the music of Tom Thumb's bagpipe, and
> thence to Fairy-land, where he "did show him many secrets which he
> never did open to the world."

> In the same work Sib says of the woman-fairies:

> "To walk nightly as do the men-fairies we use not; but now and then we
> go together, and at good housewives' fires we warm our fairy children.
> \[e\] If we find clean water and clean towels we leave them money,
> either in their basins, or in their shoes; but if we find no clean
> water in their houses, we wash our children in their pottage, milk, or
> beer, or whatever we find: for the sluts that have not such things
> fitting, we wash their faces and hands with a gilded child's clout, or
> else carry them to some river and duck them over head and ears. We
> often use to dwell in some great hill, and from thence we do lend
> money to any poor man or woman that hath need; but if they bring it
> not again at the day appointed, we do not only punish them with
> pinching, but also in their goods, so that they never thrive till they
> have paid us."

> The learned and strong-minded Reginald Scot, thus notices the
> superstitions of his own and the preceding age. \[f\]

> "Indeed your grandams' maids were wont to set a bowl of milk before
> him (Incubus) and his cousin Robin Goodfellow, for grinding of malt or
> mustard, and sweeping the house at midnight; and you have also heard
> that he would chafe exceedingly if the maid or good-wife of the house,
> having compassion of his nakedness, laid any clothes for him besides
> his mess of white bread and milk, which was his standing fee; for in
> that case he saith,

> What have we here? Hemten, hamten,  
> Here will I never more tread nor stampen.

> Again: \[g\]

> "The Faeries do principally inhabit the mountains and caverns of the
> earth, whose nature is to make strange apparitions on the earth, in
> meadows or on mountains, being like men and women, soldiers, kings,
> and lathes, children and horsemen, clothed in green, to which purpose
> they do in the night steal hempen stalks from the fields where they
> grow, to convert them into horses, as the story goes.

> "Such jocund and facetious spirits," he continues, "are said to sport
> themselves in the night by tumbling and fooling with servants and
> shepherds in country houses, pinching them black and blue, and leaving
> bread, butter, and cheese, sometimes with them, which, if they refuse
> to eat, some mischief shall undoubtedly befal them by the means of
> these Faeries; and many such have been taken away by the said spirits
> for a fortnight or a month together, being carried with them in
> chariots through the air, over hills and dales, rocks and precipices,
> till at last they have been found lying in some meadow or mountain,
> bereaved of their senses, and commonly one of their members to boot."

> Elsewhere \[h\] he gives the following goodly catalogue of these
> objects of popular terror:--"Our mother's maids have so frayed us with
> Bull-beggars, Spirits, Witches, Urchins, Elves, Hags, Faeries, Satyrs,
> Pans, Faunes, Sylens, Kit-wi-the-Canstick, Tritons, Centaurs, Dwarfs,
> Gyants, Impes, Calcars, Coujurors, Nymphs, Changelings, Incubus, Robin
> Goodfellow, the Spoorn, the Mare, the Man-in-the-Oak, the Hell-wain,
> the Firedrake, the Puckle, Tom-thombe, Hob-goblin, Tom-tumbler,
> Boneless, and such other Bugs, that we are afraid of our shadow."

> Burton, after noticing from Paracelsus those which in Germany "do
> usually walk in little coats, some two foot long," says,\[j\] "A
> bigger kind there is of them called with us Hobgoblins and Robin
> Goodfellows, that would, in those superstitious times, grind corn for
> a mess of milk, cut wood, or do any manner of drudgery work." And
> again: "Some put our Fairies into this rank (that of terrestrial
> devils), which have been in former times adored with much
> superstition, with sweeping their houses, and setting of a pail of
> clean water, good victuals, and the like, and then they should not be
> pinched, but find money in their shoes, and be fortunate in their
> enterprises." In another place (p. 30,) he says, "And so those which
> Miyaldus calls *Ambulones,* that walk about midnight, on heaths and
> desert places, which (saith Lavater) draw men out of the way and lead
> them all night a by-way, or quite barre them of their way; these have
> several names, in several places; we commonly call them
>
> Pucks."

> Harsenet thus speaks of them in his Declaration: \[k\]

> "And if that the *bowl* of curds and *cream* were not *duly set* out
> for Robin Goodfellow, the *friar,* and Sisse the dairy-maid, why then,
> either the pottage was burned the next day in the pot, or the cheeses
> would not curdle, or the butter would not come, or the ale in the fat
> never would have good head. But if a Peter-penny or a Housle-egge
> \[l\] were behind, or a patch of tythe unpaid--then 'ware of
> bull-beggars, spirits, &c."

> Nash thus describes them: \[m\]

> "Then ground they malt, and had hempen shirts for their labours;
> daunced in rounds in green meadows; pincht maids in their sleep that
> swept not their houses clean, and led poor travellers out of their
> way."

> As the celebrated Luck of Eden Hall is supposed to have been a
> chalice, due respect for the piety of our forefathers will not allow
> of our placing the desecration of it any higher than the reign of
> Elizabeth, or that of her father at farthest. We will therefore
> introduce its history in this place.
