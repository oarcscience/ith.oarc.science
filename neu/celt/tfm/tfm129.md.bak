DEPARTURE OF THE FAIRIES

>  

> ON a Sabbath morning, all the inmates of a little hamlet had gone to
> church, except a herd-boy, and a little girl, his sister, who were
> lounging beside one of the cottages, when just as the shadow of the
> garden-dial had fallen on the line of noon, they saw a long cavalcade
> ascending out of the ravine, through the wooded hollow. It winded
> among the knolls and bushes, and turning round the northern gable of
> the cottage, beside which the sole spectators of the scene were
> stationed, began to ascend the eminence towards the south. The horses
> were shaggy diminutive things, speckled dun and grey; the riders
> stunted, misgrown, ugly creatures, attired in antique jerkins of
> plaid, long grey clokes, and little red caps, from under which their
> wild uncombed locks shot out over their cheeks and foreheads. The boy
> and his sister stood gazing in utter dismay and astonishment, as rider
> after rider, each more uncouth and dwarfish than the other which had
> preceded it, passed the cottage and disappeared among the brushwood,
> which at that period covered the hill, until at length the entire
> rout, except the last rider, who lingered a few yards behind the
> others, had gone by. "What are you, little manie? and where are ye
> going?" inquired the boy, his curiosity getting the better of his
> fears and his prudence. "Not of the race of Adam," said the creature,
> turning for a moment in its saddle, "the people of peace shall never
> more be seen in Scotland." \[a\]

> geologist but an elegant writer, and a sound and discerning critic.
> Scotland seems to stand alone in producing such men.
