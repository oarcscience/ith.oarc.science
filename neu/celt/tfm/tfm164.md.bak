THE FAIRIES BANISHED

>  

> ONE of those old farm-houses, where the kitchen and cow-house are on
> the same floor, with only a low partition between them, was haunted by
> the fairies. If the family were at their meals in the kitchen, *they*
> were racketing in the cow-house, and if the people were engaged about
> the cows, the fairies were making a riot in the kitchen. One day, when
> a parcel of reapers were at their harvest-dinner in the kitchen, the
> elves, who were laughing and dancing above, threw down such a quantity
> of dust and dirt as quite spoiled the dinner. While the mistress of
> the house was in perplexity about it, there came in an old woman, who,
> on hearing the case, said she could provide a remedy. She then told
> her in a whisper to ask six of the reapers to dinner next day in the
> hearing of the fairies, and only to make as much pudding as could be
> boiled in an egg-shell. She did as directed, and when the fairies saw
> that a dinner for six men was put down to boil in an egg-shell, there
> was great stir and noise in the cow-house, and at length one angry
> voice was heard to say, "We have lived long in this world; we were
> born just after the earth was made, and before the acorn was planted,
> and yet we never saw a harvest-dinner dressed in an egg-shell! There
> must be something wrong in this house, and we will stop here no
> longer." They went away and never returned.

>  

> The fairies are said to take away children, and leave changelings.
> They also give pieces of' money, one of which is found every day in
> the same place as long as the finder keeps his good fortune a secret.
> One peculiarity of the Cambrian fairies is, that every Friday night
> they comb the goats' beards "to make them decent for Sunday? "

> We hear not of Brownies or Kobolds in the Welsh houses now, but Puck
> used to haunt Wales as well as Ireland. His Welsh name, Pwcca, is the
> same as his Irish one. In Brecon there is Cwm Pwcca, or Puck's Glen,
> and though an iron-foundry has in a great measure scared him from it,
> yet he occasionally makes his appearance. As a man was returning one
> night from his work, he saw a light before him, and thought he
> discerned some one that carried it. Supposing it to be one of his
> fellow-workmen with a lanthorn, he quickened his pace to come up with
> him, wondering all the while how so short a man as he appeared to be
> could get over the ground so fast. He also fancied he was not going
> the right way, but still thought that he who had the light must know
> best. At last, he came up with him, and found himself on the very edge
> of one of the precipices of Cwm Pwcca, down which another step would
> have carried him. The Pwcca, for it was he, sprang over the glen,
> turned round, held the light above his head, and then with a loud
> laugh put it out and vanished.
