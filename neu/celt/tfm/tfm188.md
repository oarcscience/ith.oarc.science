THE MOOHEL

>  

> THERE was once a man who was exceedingly rich, but out of all measure
> avaricious, and who never had done a good deed in his life, and. never
> had given even the value of a farthing unto the poor.

> It happened one winter's nights between the hours of twelve and one,
> that a man came and knocked loudly at the door of this miser. He
> opened the window, and saw a man at the door, and he asked him what it
> was he wanted. He. said that he wanted him to go with him to a village
> twelve miles distant from the town, to circumcise a young child that
> would be eight days old in the morning.

> Now you must know, that this man of whom we treat was a Jew and a
> Moohel, that is, one whose office it is to circumcise the young
> children; and with all his avarice in money matters, he was not
> avaricious in his office, for he believed in the end of the world, and
> therefore he did this good action.

> He accordingly agreed to go with the man, and he kindled a fire, and
> put his clothes before it, and. got ready the instruments he required
> for performing the ceremony. He then set out along with the strange
> man, whom he knew not, though it was winter, and dark and rainy; and
> they went along, journeying through the wilderness. This unfortunate
> Moohel, who did not know his way in the wilderness, and in the dark,
> every now and then fell over the stones on the way; but they still
> went on until they came to a great and lofty mountain in the midst of
> the wilderness, where people never passed, and where there are no
> people to be see; but only dark, dark mountains, that fill with terror
> those who look upon them.

> The man who came with the Moohel now laid his hand on a great stone of
> the mountain, so large that five hundred persons could not remove or
> raise it; yet he raised it with only one hand. The place then opened,
> and they both descended. There were many flights of steps, and it was
> very deep within the earth, and below there was an entire city. They
> entered then into a palace that was very large and handsome; it had
> fine gardens, and there was a great deal of light, and music, and much
> dancing of men and women. When they saw this Moohel approach, they
> began to laugh and to mock at him; but the poor Moohel was greatly
> astonished at all the things that he saw, and as he stood looking on,
> he began to consider and reflect upon them; and then he saw that they
> were not human beings like us, and great fear came upon him; but be
> had no means of getting out, or of saving himself; so he constrained
> himself; and remained quiet.

> Now the man who had brought him thither was one of their commanders,
> and a great personage among them. He took him then to the apartment of
> the lying-in woman, that he might view the child. The man then went
> away, and left him with the lying-in woman. But the woman groaned in
> great affliction, and began to weep. The Moohel asked her what ailed
> her? Then said the woman unto the Moohel, "How didst thou come hither?
> Knowest thou in what place thou art, and amongst whom thou art?" The
> Moohel replied that he did not, as he had not ventured to speak. The
> woman then explained, "Thou art in the land of the Mazikeen, and all
> the people that are here are Mazikeen; but I am a being like unto
> thyself; for when I was yet young and little, I was once alone in a
> dark place, and these people took me and brought me hither; and I was
> married to this husband, who is one of their great men, and who is,
> moreover, a Jew for there are different religions among them; and I
> also am a Jewess, and when this child was born, I spake unto my
> husband, and entreated of him, that he would get a Moohel to
> circumcise the, babe; and so he brought thee hither. But thou art in
> great danger here, and art lost; for thou wilt never be able to go out
> from here, and wilt be like one of them. Yet, as I have compassion for
> thee, and particularly as thou hast, out of kindness, come hither to
> circumcise the babe, and out of humanity, I will give thee a counsel
> that may be of service unto thee; and that is, when they ask thee to
> eat or to drink, take good heed not to touch anything, for if thou
> taste anything of theirs thou wilt become like one of them, and wilt
> remain here for ever."

> The husband now came in, and they went to the congregation to perform
> the morning prayer. After the prayer, they returned to the house to
> perform the ceremony of circumcision. The Moohel took a cup of wine,
> and gave it to taste to the lying-in woman, to the babe, and to all
> who were invited to the ceremony, for this is the manner and the
> custom. But the man who had fetched the Moohel said unto him, "Thou
> also shouldst taste." The Moohel replied, that be could not, for he
> had dreamed an evil dream, and that he must fast; and by this excuse
> he escaped. But he waited for him till night, and then they brought
> him meat and drink; but he replied that he could not eat until he had
> passed two or three days fasting. When the man who bad brought him
> thither saw that he would neither eat nor drink for so long a time, he
> took compassion upon him, and said unto him, "What is the matter with
> thee, that thou wilt neither eat nor drink? "--" Sir," replied the
> Moohel, "I ask and desire no other thing but to go home unto my
> family; for this week we hold a feast, and I should be with my family.
> I therefore most humbly supplicate thee to take me unto my own house."
> He then began to beg and entreat him most earnestly, and the woman
> also entreated for him.

> The man then said unto him, "Since thou desirest to go home unto thy
> house, come then with me; I will give thee a present for thy trouble.
> Come with me, where thou mayest see and take whatever will seem good
> unto thee." The Moohel answered, "I do not wish for anything. Thanks
> be to God! I am very rich--I want for nothing, but to return home unto
> my family."--" Nevertheless," said he, "come with me, till I show thee
> curious things that thou hast never seen in thy life." He was
> accordingly persuaded; he went with him, and he showed him divers
> apartments all full of silver, of gold, of diamonds, of all sorts of
> precious stones, and of other curious and magnificent things, such as
> he had never seen in his life.

> He thus led him from. one chamber to another, and continually asked
> him if he wished for anything; for if he did, he might. take it. But
> he still refused, and would take nothing. At length they came to the
> last chamber, where there was nothing but bunches of keys hanging. The
> Moohel raised his eyes at seeing such a number of keys, and, lo! he
> beheld a bunch of keys that was his own. He began then to reflect
> deeply; and the man said unto him, "What dost thou stand gazing at? I
> have shown thee many precious and curious things, and yet thou didst
> not bestow so much attention upon them as upon these old keys, that
> are of little worth." "Be not offended, sir," answered the Moohel,
> "but these keys are so like mine, and I believe they are the same." He
> took the keys and began to examine them, and to point out each key
> separately to the man, who at length said unto him, "Thou art right,
> they are thy keys. Know that I am lord over the hearts of the people
> who never at any time do good; and as thou performest this good deed
> of circumcision, and riskest thy life in dangerous journeys, and goest
> with all sorts of people to do the commandment of the God of Israel,
> here, take the keys! From henceforward thy heart will be opened, \[a\]
> and will be good toward the poor, which will cause thee to live a long
> and a happy life with thy family. Come now with me; I will carry thee
> home to thy house and to thy family. Now shut thine eyes."

> He shut his eyes, and instantly found himself in his own house amidst
> his family. He then began to distribute money to all the poor that
> were in the land, every week and every month. But the world is always
> curious to hear novelties and strange events, and the people, and even
> his own wife, as this was a very wonderful thing, pressed him and
> persuaded him, until at length he was obliged to relate the whole
> history of what had befallen him, from the beginning even unto the
> end; and it was a matter of great delight to all the world; and they
> did much good to the poor, and they all became rich, with great
> prosperity. And the Moohel lived very long, and spent a great and a
> happy life with his family, a pattern and an example unto the whole
> world. \[b\]
