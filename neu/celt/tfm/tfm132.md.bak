IRELAND

>  

> Like him, the Sprite,  
> Whom maids by night  
> Oft meet In glen that's haunted.  
> Moore.

> WE commence our survey of the lands of Celts and Cymry with Ireland,
> as being the first in point of importance, but still more as being the
> land of our birth. It is pleasing to us, now in the autumn of our
> life, to return in imagination to where we passed its spring--its most
> happy spring. As we read and meditate, its mountains and its vales,
> its verdant fields and lucid streams, objects on which we probably
> never again shall gaze, rise up in their primal freshness and beauty
> before us, and we are once more present, buoyant with youth, in the
> scenes where we first heard the fairy-legends of which we are now to
> treat. Even the forms of the individual peasants who are associated
> with them in our memory, rise as it were from their humble
> resting-places and appear before us, again awaking our sympathies;
> for, we will boldly assert it, the Irish peasantry, with all their
> faults, gain a faster hold on the affections than the peasantry of any
> other country. We speak, however, particularly of them as they were in
> our county and in our younger days; for we fear that they are somewhat
> changed, and not for the better. But our present business is with the
> Irish fairies rather than with the Irish people.

> The fairies of Ireland can hardly be said to differ in any respect
> from those of England and Scotland. Like them they are of diminutive
> size, rarely exceeding two feet in height; they live also in society,
> their ordinary abode being the interior of the mounds, called in
> Irish, Raths (*Rahs*), in English, Moats, the construction of which
> is, by the peasantry, ascribed to the Danes from whom, it might thence
> perhaps be inferred, the Irish got their fairies direct and not *vid*
> England. From these abodes they are at times seen to issue mounted on
> diminutive steeds, in order to take at night the diversion of the
> chase. Their usual attire is green with red caps. \[a\] They are fond
> of music, but we do not in general hear much of their dancing, perhaps
> because on account of the infrequency of thunder, the fairy-rings are
> less numerous in Ireland than elsewhere. Though the fairies steal
> children and strike people with paralysis and other ailments (which is
> called being *fairy-struck),* and shoot their elf-arrows at the
> cattle, they are in general kind to those for whom they have
> contracted a liking, and often render them essential service in time
> of need. They can make themselves visible and invisible, and assume
> any forms they please. The pretty tiny conical mushrooms which grow so
> abundantly in Ireland are called Fairy-mushrooms; a kind of nice
> regularly-formed grass is named Fairy-flax, and the bells of the
> foxglove called in some places Fairy-bells, are also said to have some
> connexion with the Little People.

> The popular belief in Ireland also is, that the Fairies are a portion
> of the fallen angels, who, being less guilty than the rest, were not
> driven to hell, but were suffered to dwell on earth. They are supposed
> to be very uneasy respecting their condition after the final
> judgement.

> The only names by which they are known in those parts of Ireland in
> which the English language is spoken are, Fairies, the Good People,
> and the Gentry, these last terms being placatory, like the Greek
> Eumenides. When, for example, the peasant sees a cloud of dust
> sweeping along the road, he raises his hat and says, "God speed you,
> gentlemen!" for it is the popular belief that it is in these cloudy
> vehicles that the Good People journey from one place to another. The
> Irish language has several names for the fairies; all however are
> forms or derivations of the word *Shia,* the meaning of which seems to
> be Spirit. The most usual name employed by the Minister peasantry is
> *Shifra;* we are not acquainted with the fairy-belief and terminology
> of the inhabitants of Connemara and the other wilds of Connaught.
> \[b\]

> Most of the traits and legends of the Irish fairies are contained in
> the Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland, compiled by
> Mr. Crofton Croker. As we ourselves aided in that work we must inform
> the reader that our contributions, both in text and notes, contain
> only Leinster ideas and traditions, for that was the only province
> with which we were acquainted. We must make the further confession,
> that some of the more poetic traits which MM. Grimm, in the
> Introduction to their translation of this work, give as characteristic
> of the Irish fairies, owe their origin to the fancy of the writers,
> who were, in many cases, more anxious to produce amusing tales than to
> transmit legends faithfully.

> The Legend of Knockshegowna *(Hill of the Fairy-calf)* the first given
> in that work, relates how the fairies used to torment the cattle and
> herdsmen for intruding on one of their favourite places of resort
> which was on this hill. The fairy-queen, it says, having failed in her
> attempts to daunt a drunken piper who had undertaken the charge of the
> cattle, at last turned herself into a calf and, with the piper on her
> back, jumped over the Shannon, ten miles off, and back again. Pleased
> with his courage, she agreed to abandon the hill for the future.

> The Legend of Knock-Grafton tells how a little hunchback, while
> sitting to rest at nightfall at the side of a Rath or Moat, heard the
> fairies within singing over and over again, *DaLuan, Da Mart!*
> (i.e.,Monday, Tuesday!) and added, weary with the monotony, *Agus da
> Cadin! (i.e.,* and Wednesday!) The fairies were so delighted with this
> addition to their song that they brought him into the Moat,
> entertained him, and finally freed him from the incumbrance of his
> hump.

> Another hunchback hearing the story went to the Moat to try if he
> could meet with the same good fortune. He heard the fairies singing
> the amended version of the song, and, anxious to contribute, without
> waiting for a pause or attending to the rhythm or melody, he added
> *Agus da Hena! (i.e.,* and Friday.) His reward was, being carried into
> the Moat, and having his predecessor's hump placed on his back in
> addition to his own. \[c\]

> In the story named the Priest's Supper, a fisherman at the request of
> the fairies, asks a priest who had stopt at his house, whether they
> would be saved or not at the last day. The priest desired him to tell
> them to come themselves and put the question to him, but this they
> declined doing, and the question remained undecided.

> The next three stories are of changelings. The Young Piper, one of our
> own contributions, will be found in the Appendix. The Changeling has
> nothing peculiar in it; but the Brewery of Eggshells is one which we
> find in many places, even in Brittany and Auvergne. In the present
> version, the mother puts down eggshells to boil, and to the enquiry of
> the changeling she tells him that she is brewing them, and clapping
> his hands he says, "Well! I'm fifteen hundred years in the world, and
> I never saw a brewery of eggshells before!"

> In the Capture of Bridget Purcel, a girl is struck with a little
> switch between the shoulders, by something in the form of a little
> child that came suddenly behind her, and she pined away and died.

> The Legend of Bottle Hill gives the origin of that name, which was as
> follows. A poor man was driving his only cow to Cork to sell her. As
> he was going over that bill he was suddenly joined by a
> strange-looking little old man with a pale withered face and red eyes,
> to whom he was eventually induced to give his cow in exchange for a
> bottle, and both cow and purchaser then disappeared. When the poor man
> came home he followed the directions of the stranger, and spreading a
> cloth on the table, and placing the bottle on the ground, he said,
> "Bottle, do your duty!" and immediately two little beings rose out of
> it, and having covered the table with food in gold and silver dishes,
> went down again into the bottle and vanished. By selling these he got
> a good deal of money and became rich for one in his station. The
> secret of his bottle however transpired, and his landlord induced him
> to sell it to him. But his prosperity vanished with it, and he was
> again reduced to one cow, and obliged to drive her to Cork for sale.
> As he journeyed over the same hill he met the same old man, and sold
> him the cow for another bottle. Having made the usual preparations, he
> laid it on the ground and said, "Bottle, do your duty!" but instead of
> the tiny little lads with their gold and silver dishes, there jumped
> up out of it two huge fellows with cudgels, who fell to belabouring
> the whole family. When they had done and were gone back into the
> bottle, the owner of it, without saying a word, put it under his coat
> and went to his landlord, who happened to have a great deal of company
> with him, and sent in word that he was come with another bottle to
> sell. He was at once admitted, the bottle did its duty, and the men
> with cudgels laid about them on all present, and never ceased till the
> original wealth-giving bottle was restored. He now grew richer than
> ever, and his son married his landlord's daughter, but when the old
> man and his wife died, the servants, it is recorded, fighting at their
> wake, broke the two bottles. \[d\]

> The Confessions of Tom Bourke, as it contains a faithful transcript of
> the words and ideas of that personage, is perhaps the most valuable
> portion of the work. From this we learn that in Munster the fairies
> are, like the people themselves, divided into *factions.* Thus we are
> told that, on the occasion of the death of Bourke's mother, the two
> parties fought for three continuous nights, to decide whether she
> should be buried with her own or her husband's *peçple (i. e.*
> family). Bourke also had sat for hours looking at two parties of the
> Good People playing at the popular game of hurling, in a meadow at the
> opposite side of the river, with their coats and waistcoats off, and
> white handkerchiefs on the heads of one, and red on these of the other
> party.

> A man whom Tom knew was returning one evening from a fair, a little
> elevated of course, when he met a *berrin (i. e.* funeral), which he
> joined, as is the custom; but, to his surprise, there was no one there
> that he knew except one man, and *he* had been dead for some years.
> When the *berrin* was over, they gathered round a piper, and began to
> dance in the churchyard. Davy longed to be among them, and the man
> that he knew came up to him, and bid him take out a partner, but on no
> account to give her the usual kiss. He accordingly took out the
> *purtiest girl in the ring,* and danced a jig with her, to the
> admiration of the whole company; but at the end he forgot the warning,
> and complied with the custom of kissing one's partner. All at once
> everything vanished; and when Davy awoke next morning, he found
> himself lying among the tombstones.

> Another man, also a little in liquor, was returning one night from a
> *berrin.* The moon was shining bright, and from the other side of the
> river came the sounds of merriment, and the notes of a bagpipe. Taking
> off his shoes and stockings, he waded across the river, and there he
> found a great crowd of people dancing on the Inch \[an island, coast,
> bank of sea or river\] on the, other side. He mingled with them
> without being observed, and he longed to join in the dance; for he had
> no mean opinion of his own skill. He did so, but found that it was not
> to be compared to theirs, they were so light and agile. He was going
> away quite in despair, when a little old man, who was looking on with
> marks of displeasure in his face, came up to him, and telling him he
> was his friend, and his father's friend, bade him go into the ring and
> call for a lilt. He complied, and all were amazed at his dancing; he
> then got a table and danced on it, and finally he span round and round
> on a trencher. When he had done, they wanted him to dance again; but
> he refused with a great oath, and instantly he found himself lying on
> the Inch with only a white cow grazing beside him. On going home, he
> got a shivering and a fever. He was for many days out of his mind, and
> recovered slowly; but ever after he had great skill in fairy matters.
> The dancers, it turned out, had belonged to a different faction, and
> the old man who gave him his skill to that to which he himself was
> attached.

> In these genuine confessions it is very remarkable that the Good
> People are never represented as of a diminutive size; while in every
> story that we ever heard of them in Leinster, they were of pygmy
> stature. The following account of their mode of entering houses in
> Ulster gives them dimensions approaching to those of Titania's 'small
> elves.'

> A Fairy, the most agile, we may suppose, of the party, is selected,
> who contrives to get up to the keyhole of the door, carrying with him
> a piece of thread or twine. With this he descends on the inside, where
> he fastens it firmly to the floor, or some part of the furniture.
> Those without then 'haul taut and belay,' and when it is fast they
> prepare to march along this their perilous Es-Sirat, leading to the
> paradise of pantry or parlour, in this order. First steps up the
> Fairy-piper, and in measured pace pursues his adventurous route,
> playing might and main an invigorating elfin-march, or other
> spirit-stirring air; then one by one the rest of the train mount the
> cord and follow his steps. Like the old Romans, in their triumphal
> processions, they pass beneath the lofty arch of the keyhole, and move
> down along the other side. Lightly, one by one, they then jump down on
> the floor, to hold their revels or accomplish their thefts.

> We have never heard of any being, in the parts of Ireland with which
> we are acquainted, answering to the Boggart, Brownie, or Nis. A
> farmer's family still, we believe, living in the county of Wicklow,
> used to assert that in their grandfather's time they never had any
> trouble about washing up plates and dishes; for they had only to leave
> them collected in a certain part of the house for the Good People, who
> would come in and wash and clean them, and in the morning everything
> would be clean and in its proper place.

> Yet in the county of Cork it would seem that the Cluricaun, of which
> we shall presently speak, used to enact the part of Nis or Boggart.
> Mr. Croker tells a story of a little being which he calls a Cluricaun,
> that haunted the cellar of a Mr. Macarthy, and in a note on this tale
> he gives the contents of a letter informing him of another ycleped
> Little Wildbean, that haunted the house of a Quaker gentleman named
> Harris, and which is precisely the Nis or Boggart. This Wildbean, who
> kept to the cellar, would, if one of the servants through negligence
> left the beer-barrel running, wedge himself into the cock and stop it,
> till some one came to turn it. His dinner used to be left for him in
> the cellar, and the cook having, one Friday, left him nothing but part
> of a herring and some cold potatoes, she was at midnight dragged out
> of her bed, and down the cellar-stairs, and so much bruised that she
> kept her bed for three weeks. In order at last to get rid of him, Mr.
> Harris resolved to remove, being told that if he went beyond a running
> stream the Cluricaun could not follow him. The last cart, filled with
> empty barrels and such like, was just moving off, when from the
> bung-hole of one of them Wildbean cried out, "Here, master! here we go
> all together!" "What!" said Mr. Harris, "dost thou go also?" "Yes, to
> be sure, master. Here we go, all together!" "In that case, friend,"
> replied Mr. Harris, "let the carts be unloaded; we are just as well
> where we are." It is added, that "Mr. Harris died soon after, but it
> is said the Cluricaun still haunts the Harris family."

> In another of these Fairy Legends, Teigue of the Lee, who haunted the
> house of a Mr. Pratt, in the county of Cork, bears a strong
> resemblance to the Hinzelmann of Germany. To the story, which is
> exceedingly well told by a member of the society of Friends, now no
> more, also the narrator of the Legend of Bottle-hill, Mr. Croker has
> in his notes added some curious particulars.

> A being named the Fear Dearg *(i. e.* Red Man) is also known in
> Munster. A tale named The Lucky Guest, which Mr. Croker gives as taken
> down *verbatim* from the mouth of the narrator by Mr. M'Clise, the
> artist, gives the fullest account of this being. A girl related that,
> when she was quite a child, one night, during a storm of wind and
> rain; a knocking was heard at the door of her father's cabin, and a
> voice like that of a feeble old man craving admission. On the door's
> being opened, there came in a little old man, about two feet and a
> half high, with a red sugar-loaf hat and a long scarlet coat, reaching
> down nearly to the ground, his hair was long and grey, and his face
> yellow and wrinkled. He went over to the fire (which the family had
> quitted in their fear), sat down and dried his clothes, and began
> smoking a pipe which he found there. The family went to bed, and in
> the morning he was gone. In about a month after he began to come
> regularly every night about eleven o'clock. The signal which he gave
> was thrusting a hairy arm through a hole in the door, which was then
> opened, and the family retired to bed, leaving him the room to
> himself. If they did not open the door, some accident was sure to
> happen next day to themselves or their cattle. On the whole, however,
> his visits brought good luck, and the family prospered, till the
> landlord put them out of their farm, and they never saw the Fear Dearg
> more.

>  

> As far as our knowledge extends, there is no being in the Irish rivers
> answering to the Nix or Kelpie; but on the sea coast the people
> believe in beings of the same kind as the Mermen and Mermaids. The
> Irish name is Merrow, and legends are told of them similar to those of
> other countries. Thus the Lady of Gollerus resembles the Mermaid-wife
> and others which we have already related. Instead, however, of an
> entire dress, it is a kind of cap, named *Cohuleen Driuth,* without
> which she cannot return to her subaqueous abode. Other legends tell of
> matrimonial unions formed by mortals with these sea--ladies, from
> which some families in the south claim a descent. The Lord of
> Dunkerron, so beautifully told in verse by Mr. Croker, relates the
> unfortunate termination of a marine amour of one of the O'Sullivan
> family. The Soul-cages alone contains the adventures of a Mermnan.

> The Irish Pooka \[e\] is plainly the English Pouke, Puck, and would
> seem, like it, to denote an evil spirit. The notions respecting it are
> very vague. A boy in the mountains near Killarney told Mr. Croker that
> "old people used to say that the Pookas were very numerous in the
> times long ago. They were wicked-minded, black-looking, bad things,
> that would come in *the form of wild colts,* with chains hanging about
> them. They did great hurt to benighted travellers." Here we plainly
> have the English Puck; but it is remarkable that the boy should speak
> of Pookas in the plural number. In Leinster, it was always *the,* not
> *a* Pooka, that we heard named. When the blackberries begin to decay,
> and the seeds to appear, the children are told not to eat them any
> longer, as *the* Pooh has dirtied on them.

> The celebrated fall of the Liffey, near Ballymore Eustace, is named
> Pool-a-Phooka, or The Pooka's Hole. Near Macroom, in the county of
> Cork, are the ruins of a castle built on a rock, named
> Carrig-a-Phooka, or The Pooka's Rock. There is an old castle not far
> from Dublin, called Puck's Castle, and a townland in the county of
> Kildare is named Puckstown. The common expression *play the Puck* is
> the same as
>
> play the deuce, play the Devil.

> The most remarkable of the Fairy-tribe in Ireland, and one which is
> peculiar to the country, is the Leprechaun. \[f\] This is a being in
> the form of an old man, dressed as he is described in one of the
> following tales. He is by profession a maker of brogues; he resorts in
> general only to secret and retired places, where he is discovered by
> the sounds which he makes hammering his brogues. He is rich, like
> curmudgeons of his sort, and it is only by the most violent threats of
> doing him some bodily harm, that be can be made to show the place
> where his treasure lies; but if the person who has caught him can be
> induced (a thing that always happens, by the way) to take his eyes off
> him, he vanishes and with him the prospect of wealth. The only
> instance of more than one Leprechaun being seen at a time is that
> which occurs in one of the following tales, which was related by an
> old woman, to the writer's sister and early companion, now no more.

> Yet the Leprechaun, though, as we said, peculiar to Ireland, seems
> indebted to England, at least, for his name. In Irish, as we have
> seen, he is called *Lobaircin,* and it would not be easy to write the
> English Lubberkin more accurately with Irish letters and Irish sounds.
> Leprechaun is evidently a corruption of that word. In the time of
> Elizabeth and James, the word Lubrican was used in England to indicate
> some kind of spirit. Thus Drayton gives as a part of Nymphidia's
> invocation of Proserpina:

> By the mandrake's dreadful groans;  
> By the Lubrican's sad moans;  
> By the noise of dead men's bones  
> In charnelhouse rattling.

> That this was the Leprechaun is, we think, clear; for in the Honest
> Whore of Decker and Middleton, the following words are used of an
> lrish footman:

> As for your Irish Lubrican, that spirit  
> Whom by preposterous charms thy lust has raised.  
> Part II, i. 1. \[g\]

> We thus have the Leprechaun as a well-known Irish fairy, though his
> character was not understood, in the sixteenth century.

> The two following tales we ourselves beard from the peasantry of
> Kildare in our boyhood:

>  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \[a\] Mr. Croker says, that according to the Munster peasantry the
> ordinary attire of the Fairy is a black bat, green coat, white
> stockings, and red shoes.

> \[b\] We never heard a fairy-legend from any of the Connaught-men with
> whom we conversed in our boyhood. Their tales were all of
> Finn-mac-Cool and his heroes.

> \[c\] See *Brittany,* and *Spain,* in both of which the legend is more
> perfect; but it is impossible to say which is the original. Parnell's
> pleasing Fairy Tale is probably formed on this Irish version, yet it
> agrees more with the Breton legend.

> \[d\] This story may remind one of the Wonderful Lamp, and others.
> There Is something of the same kind in the Pentamerone.

> \[e\] It is a rule of the Irish language, that the initial consonant
> of an oblique case, or of a word *in regimine,* becomes aspirated;
> thus *Pooka* (nom.), *na Phooka* (gen.), *mac* son, *a mhic (vic)* my
> son.

> \[f\] In Irish *lubárkin;* the Ulster name is Logheryman, in Irish
> *lucharman.* For the Cork term Cluricaun, the Kerry Luricaun and the
> Tipperary Lurigadaun, we have found no equivalents in the Irish
> dictionaries. The short *o* in Irish, we may observe, is pronounced as
> in French and Spanish, *i. e*. as *u* in *but, cut; ai* nearly as *a*
> in *fall*. It may be added, on account of the following tales, that in
> Kildare and the adjoining counties the short English *u*, in *but,
> cut,* etc., is invariably pronounced as in *pull, full,* while this
> *u* is pronounced as that in *but*,
>
> cut.

> \[f\] In the place of the Witch of Edmonton usually quoted with this,
> Lubrick is plainly the Latin
>
> lubricus.

> \[g\] It will be observed that these, as well as the Young Piper in
> the Appendix are related in the character of a peasant. This was in
> accordance with a frame that was proposed for the Fairy Legends, but
> which proved too difficult of execution to be adopted.
