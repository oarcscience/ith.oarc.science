<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>CONCEIVED AND COMMENCED WHEN PASSING OVEN PUTNEY BRIDGE ON A FINE MOONLIGHT NIGHT IN SUMMER.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THE moonbeams on the lake are glancing, <BR>
The nimble bark is now advancing,<BR>
That for this grove is bound.<BR>
Ye gentle clouds, ah! hear a lover,<BR>
And hasten not the moon to cover<BR>
And darkness pour around.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Doth fancy sport, or do I hear her,<BR>
As nearer still she comes and nearer,<BR>
Cutting the billows bright? -.<BR>
How still! scarce even a light breeze flying! <BR>
Earth, water, air, at peace are lying<BR>
Beneath the calm moonlight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My heart beats high, my soul rejoices,<BR>
Methinks I hear their merry voices--<BR>
She soon will reach the shore.--<BR>
Ah me! my hopes, my hopes are failing, <BR>
Yon sable cloud is onwards sailing--<BR>
The moon it covers o'er.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now o'er the lake they dubious wander,<BR>
And on some part remote may strand her, <BR>
Unless they aid obtain--<BR>
I'll wave a signal from the summit<BR>
Of you high bank, and haply from it<BR>
Some guidance they may gain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The cloud moves on, the moonlight beameth<BR>
And o'er the lovely lady streameth,<BR>
Upon her lofty stand.<BR>
With joyful shout the boatmen greet her, <BR>
Her anxious lover hastes to meet her,<BR>
And eager springs to land.</BLOCKQUOTE>
