THE GREEN CHILDREN

>   
>   
> "ANOTHER wonderful thing," says Ralph of Coggeshall, \[a\] "happened
> in Suffolk, at St. Mary's of the Wolf-pits. A boy and his sister were
> found by the inhabitants of that place near the mouth of a pit which
> is there, who had the form of all their limbs like to those of other
> men, but they differed in the colour of their skin from all the people
> of our habitable world; for the whole surface of their skin was tinged
> of a green colour. No one could understand their speech. When they
> were brought as curiosities to the house of a certain knight, Sir
> Richard de Caine, at Wikes, they wept bitterly. Bread and other
> victuals were set before them, but they would touch none of them,
> though they were tormented by great hunger, as the girl afterwards
> acknowledged. At length, when some beans just cut, with their stalks,
> were brought into the house, they made signs, with great avidity, that
> they should be given to them. When they were brought, they opened the
> stalks instead of the pods, thinking the beans were in the hollow of
> them; but not finding them there, they began to weep anew. When those
> who were present saw this, they opened the pods, and showed them the
> naked beans. They fed on these with great delight, and for a long time
> tasted no other food. The boy, however, was always languid and
> depressed, and he died within a short time. The girl enjoyed continual
> good health; and becoming accustomed to various kinds of food, lost
> completely that green colour, and gradually recovered the sanguine
> habit of her entire body. She was afterwards regenerated by the layer
> of holy baptism, and lived for many years in the service of that
> knight (as I have frequently heard from him and his family), and was
> rather loose and wanton in her conduct. Being frequently asked about
> the people of her country, she asserted that the inhabitants, and all
> they had in that country, were of a green colour; and that they saw no
> sun, but enjoyed a degree of light like what is after sunset. Being
> asked how she came into this country with the aforesaid boy, she
> replied, that as they were following their flocks, they came to a
> certain cavern, on entering which they heard a delightful sound of
> bells; ravished by whose sweetness, they went for a long time
> wandering on through the cavern, until they came to its mouth. When
> they came out of it, they were struck senseless by the excessive light
> of the sun, and the unusual temperature of the air; and they thus lay
> for a long time. Being terrified by the noise of those who came on
> them, they wished to fly, but they could not find the entrance of the
> cavern before they were caught."

> This story is also told by William of Newbridge, \[b\] who places it
> in the reign of King Stephen. He says he long hesitated to believe it,
> but he was at length overcome by the weight of evidence. According to
> him, the place where the children appeared was about four or five
> miles from Bury St. Edmund's: they came in harvest-time out of the
> Wolf-pits; they both lost their green hue, and were baptised, and
> learned English. The boy, who was the younger, died; but the girl
> married a man at Lenna, and lived many years. They said their country
> was called St. Martin's Land, as that saint was chiefly worshiped
> there; that the people were Christians, and had churches; that the sun
> did not rise there, but that there was a bright country which could be
> seen from theirs, being divided from it by a very broad river.
