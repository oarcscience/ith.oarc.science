ORIGIN OF TIIS LAKE

>  

> A TROLL had once taken up his abode near the village of Kund, in the
> high bank on which the church now stands; but when the people about
> there had become pious, and went constantly to church, the Troll was
> dreadfully annoyed by their almost incessant ringing of bells in the
> steeple of the church. He was at last obliged, in consequence of it,
> to take his departure; for nothing has more contributed to the
> emigration of the Troll-folk out of the country than the increasing
> piety of the people, and their taking to bell-ringing. The Troll of
> Kund accordingly quitted the country, and went over to Funen, where he
> lived for some time in peace and quiet.

> Now it chanced that a man who had lately settled in the town of Kund,
> coming to Funen on business, met on the road with this same Troll:
> "Where do you live?" said the Troll to him. Now there was nothing
> whatever about the Troll unlike a man, so he answered him, as was the
> truth, "I am from the town of Kund." "So?" said the Troll. "I don't
> know you, then! And yet I think I know every man in Kund. Will you,
> however," continued he, "just be so kind to take a letter from me back
> with you to Kund?" The man said, of course, he had no objection. The
> Troll then thrust the letter into his pocket, and charged him strictly
> not to take it out till he came to Kund church, and then to throw it
> over the churchyard wall, and the person for whom it was intended
> would get it.

> The Troll then went away in great haste, and with him the letter went
> entirely out of the man's mind. But when he was come back to Zealand
> he sat down by the meadow where Tiis Lake now is, and suddenly
> recollected the Troll's letter. He felt a great desire to look at it
> at least. So be took it out of his pocket, and sat awhile with it in
> his hands, when suddenly there began to dribble a little water out of
> the seal. The letter now unfolded itself, and the water came out
> faster and faster, and it was with the utmost difficulty that the poor
> man was enabled to save his life; for the malicious Troll had enclosed
> an entire lake in the letter. The Troll, it is plain, had thought to
> avenge himself on Kund church by destroying it in this manner; but God
> ordered it so that the lake chanced to run out in the great meadow
> where it now flows. \[a\]

> \[a\] *Oral.* Tiis Lake is in Zealand. It is the general belief of the
> peasantry that there are now very few Trolls in the country, for the
> ringing of bells has driven them all away, they, like the Stille-folk
> of the Germans, delighting in quiet and silence. It is said that a
> farmer having found a Troll sitting very disconsolate on a stone near
> Tiis Lake, and taking him at first for a decent Christian man,
> accosted him with--" Well! where are you going, friend?" "Ah!" said
> he, in a melancholy tone, "I am going off out of the country. I cannot
> live here any longer, they keep such eternal ringing and dinging!"

> "There is a high hill," says Kalm (Resa, &c. p. 136), "near Botna in
> Sweden, in which formerly dwelt a Troll. When they got up bells in
> Botna church, and he heard the ringing of them, he is related to have
> said:

> "Det är så godt i det Botnaberg at bo,  
> Vore ikke den leda Bjälleko."

> "Pleasant it were in Botnahill to dwell,  
> Were it not for the sound of that plaguey bell,"
