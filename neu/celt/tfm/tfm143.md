THE FAIRY GIFT

>  

> A FARMER in Strathspey was one day engaged in sowing one of his fields
> and singing at his work. A fairy damsel of great beauty came up to him
> and requested him to sing for her a favourite old Gaelic song named
> *NighanDonne na Bual.* He complied, and she then asked him to give her
> some of his corn. At this he demurred a little and wished to know what
> she would give him in return. She replied with a significant look that
> his seed would never fail him. He then gave to her liberally and she
> departed. He went on sowing, and when he had finished a large field,
> he found that his bag was as full and as heavy as when he began. He
> then sowed another field of the same size, with the same result, and
> satisfied with his day's work, he threw the bag on his shoulder and
> went home. Just as he was entering the barn-door he was met by his
> wife, a foolish talkative body with a tongue as long, and a head as
> empty as the church bell, who, struck with the appearance of the bag
> after a day's sowing, began to ask him about it. Instantly it became
> quite empty. "I'll be the death of you, you foolish woman," roared out
> the farmer; "if it were not for your idle talk, that bag was worth its
> weight in gold."
