THE FAIRY-LABOUR

>  

> MANY years ago there dwelt in Strathspey a midwife of great repute.
> One night just as she was going to bed, she heard a loud knocking at
> the door, and on opening it she saw there a man and a grey horse,
> *both out of breath.* The rider requested her to jump up behind him
> and come away to assist a lady who was in great danger. He would not
> even consent to her stopping to change her dress, as it would cause
> delay. She mounted and away they went at full speed. On the way she
> tried to learn from the rider whither she was going, but all she could
> get from him was, that she would be well paid. At length he let out
> that it was to a fairy-lady he was taking her. Nothing daunted,
> however, she went on, and on reaching the Shian, she found that her
> services were really very much needed. She succeeded in bringing a
> fine boy to the light, which caused so much joy, that the fairies
> desired her to ask what she would, and if it was in their power, it
> should be granted. Her desire was that success might attend herself
> and her posterity in all similar operations. The gift was conferred
> and it continued, it was said, with her great-grandson, at the time
> the collector of these legends wrote.
