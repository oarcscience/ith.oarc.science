THE CHANGELING

>  

> THERE lived once, near Tiis lake, two lonely people, who were sadly
> plagued with a changeling, given them by the underground-people
> instead of their own child, which had not been baptised in time. This
> changeling behaved in a very strange and uncommon manner, for when
> there was no one in the place, he was in great spirits, ran up the
> walls like a cat, sat under the roof, and shouted and bawled away
> lustily; but sat dozing at the end of the table when any one was in
> the room with him. He was able to eat as much as any four, and never
> cared what it was that was set before him; but though he regarded not
> the quality of his food, in quantity be was never satisfied, and gave
> excessive annoyance to every one in the house.

> When they had tried for a long time in vain how they could best get
> rid of him, since there was no living in the house with him, a smart
> girl pledged herself that she would banish him from the house. She
> accordingly, while he was out in the fields, took a pig and killed it,
> and put it, hide, hair, and all, into a black pudding, and set it
> before him when he came home. He began, as was his custom, to gobble
> it up, but when he had eaten for some time, he began to relax a little
> in his efforts, and at last he sat quite still, with his knife in his
> hand, looking at the pudding.

> At length, after sitting for some time in this manner, he began--" A
> pudding with hide!--and a pudding with hair! a pudding with eyes!--and
> a pudding with legs in it! Well, three times have I seen a young wood
> by Tiis lake, but never yet did I see such a pudding! The devil
> himself may stay here now for me!" So saying,he ran off with himself;
> and never more came back again.\[a\]

> Another changeling was got rid of in the following manner. The mother,
> suspecting it to be such from its refusing food, and being so
> ill-thriven, heated the oven as hot as possible. The maid, as
> instructed, asked her why she did it. "To burn my child in it to
> death," was the reply. When the question had been put and answered
> three times, she placed the child on the peel, and was shoving it into
> the oven, when the Troll-woman came in a great fright with the real
> child, and took away her own, saying, "There's your child for you. I
> have treated it better than you treated mine," and in truth it was fat
> and hearty.

> \[a\] *Oral.* See the Young Piper and the Brewery of Egg-shells in the
> Irish Fairy Legends, with the notes. The same story is also to be
> found in Germany where the object is to make the changeling laugh. The
> mother breaks an egg in two and sets water down to boil in each half
> shell. The imp then cries out: "Well! I 'm as old as the Westerwald,
> but never before saw I any one cooking in egg-shells," and bunt out
> laughing at it. Instantly the true child was returned.--Kinder and
> Haus--Märchen, iii. 39. Grose also tells the story in his Provincial
> Glossary. The mother there breaks a dozen of eggs and sets the shells
> before the child, who says, "I was seven years old when I came to
> nurse, and I have lived four since, and yet I never saw so many
> milkpans." See also Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and below,
>
> Wales, Brittany, France.
