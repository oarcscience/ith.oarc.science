THE FAIRY-HORN

>   
>   
> "THERE is," says he, \[a\] "in the county of Gloucester, a forest
> abounding in boars, stags, and every species of game that England
> produces. In a grovy lawn of this forest there is a little mount,
> rising in a point to the height of a man, on which knights and other
> hunters are used to ascend when fatigued with heat and thirst, to seek
> some relief for their wants. The nature of the place, and of the
> business, is, however, such, that whoever ascends the mount must leave
> his companions, and go quite alone.

> "When alone, he was to say, as if speaking to some other person, 'I
> thirst,' and immediately there would appear a cupbearer in an elegant
> dress, with a cheerful countenance, bearing in his stretched-out hand
> a large horn, adorned with gold and gems, as was the custom am\~mg the
> most ancient English. In the cup \[b\] nectar of an unknown but most
> delicious flavour was presented, and. when it was drunk, all heat and
> weariness fled from the glowing body, so that one would be thought
> ready to undertake toil instead of having toiled. Moreover, when the
> nectar was taken, the servant presented a towel to the drinker, to
> wipe his mouth with, and then having performed his office, he waited
> neither for a recompense for his services, nor for questions and
> enquiry.

> "This frequent and. daily action had for a very long period of old
> times taken place among the ancient people, till one day a knight of
> that city, when out hunting, went thither, and having called for a
> drink and gotten the horn, did not, as was the custom, and as in good
> manners he should have done, return it to the cup-bearer, but kept it
> for his own use. But the illustrious Earl of Gloucester, when he
> learned the truth of the matter, condemned the robber to death, and
> presented the horn to the most excellent King Henry the Elder, lest he
> should be thought to have approved of such wickedness, if he had added
> the rapine of another to the store of his private property."
