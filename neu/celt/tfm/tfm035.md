KALLUNDBORG CHURCH

>  

> WHEN Esbern Snare was about building a church in Kallundborg, he saw
> clearly that his means were not fully adequate to the task. But a
> Troll came to him and offered his services; and Esbern Snare made an
> agreement with him on these conditions, that he should be able to tell
> the Troll's name when the church was finished; or in case he could
> not, that he should give him his heart and his eyes.

> The work now went on rapidly, and the Troll set the church on stone
> pillars; but when all was nearly done, and there was only half a
> pillar wanting in the church, Esbern began to get frightened, for the
> name of the Troll was yet unknown to him.

> One day be was going about the fields all alone, and in great anxiety
> on account of the perilous state he was in; when, tired, and
> depressed, by reason of his exceeding grief and affliction, he laid
> him down on Ulshöi bank to rest himself a while. While he was lying
> there, he heard a Troll-woman within the hill saying these words:--

> "Lie stilI, baby mine!  
> To-morrow cometh Fin,  
> Father thine,

> And giveth thee Esbern Snare's eyes and heart to play with." \[a\]

> When Esbern heard this, he recovered his spirits, and went back to the
> church. The Troll was just then coming with the half-pillar that was
> wanting for the church; but when Esbern saw him, he hailed him by his
> name, and called him "Fin." The Troll was so enraged at this, that he
> went off with the half-pillar through the air, and this is the reason
> that the church has but three pillars and a half. \[b\]

> The same is told of a far greater than Esbern Snare. As St. Olaf; the
> royal apostle of the North, was one day going over hill and dale,
> thinking how he could contrive to build a splendid church without
> distressing his people by taxation, he was met by a man of a strange
> appearance, who asking him what he was thinking about, Olaf told him,
> and the Troll, or rather Giant *(Jätte),* for such he was, undertook
> to do it within a certain time, stipulating, for his reward, the sun
> and. moon, or else St. Olaf himself Olaf agreed, but gave such a plan
> for the church as it seemed to be impossible ever could be executed.
> It was to be so large that seven priests could preach in it at the
> same time without disturbing each other; the columns and other
> ornaments both within and without should be of hard flintstone, and so
> forth. It soon, however, was finished, all but the roof and pinnacle.
> Olaf; now grown uneasy, rambled once more over hill and dale, when he
> chanced to bear a child crying within a hill, and a giantess, its
> mother, saying to it, "Rush, hush! Thy father, Wind-and-Weather, will
> come home in the morning, and bring with him the sun and moon, or else
> St. Olaf himself." Olaf was overjoyed, for the power of evil beings
> ceases when their name is known. He returned home, where he saw every
> thing completed--pinnacle and all. He immediately cried out,
> "Wind-and-Weather, you've set the pinnacle crooked! " \[c\] Instantly
> the Giant fell witn a great crash from the ridge of the roof, and
> broke into a thousand pieces, which were all flintstone. \[d\]

> *\[b\] *Oral.* Kallundborg is in Zealand. Mr. Thiele says he saw four
> pillars at the church. The same story is told of the cathedral of Lund
> in Funen, which was built by the Troll Finn at the desire of St.
> Laurentius.

> Of Esbern Snare, Holberg says, " The common people tell wonderful
> stories of him, and how the devil carried him off; which, with other
> things, will servo to prove that he was an able man."

> The German story of Rumpelstilzchen (Kinder and Haus-Märchen, No. 55)
> is similar to this legend. MM. Grimm, in their note on this story,
> notice the unexpected manner in which, in the Thousand and One Days,
> or Persian Tales, the princess Turandot learns the name of Calaf.*

> Wind och Veder!

> Others say it was.

> Bläster! sätt spiran väster!  
> Blester! set the pinnacle westwards!

> Or,

> Slät! sätt spiran rätt!  
> Slatt! set the pinnacle straight!
