THE NIX LABOUR

>  

> A MIDWIFE related that her mother was one night called up, and desired
> to make haste and come to the aid of a woman in labour. It was dark,
> but notwithstanding she got up and dressed herself, and went down,
> where she found a man waiting. She begged of him to stay till she
> should get a lantern, and she would go with him; but he was urgent,
> said he would show her the way without a lantern, and that there was
> no fear of her going astray.

> He then bandaged her eyes, at which she was terrified, and was going
> to cry out; but he told her she was in no danger, and might go with
> him without any apprehension. They accordingly went away together, and
> the woman remarked that he struck the water with a rod, and that they
> went down deeper and deeper till they came to a room, in which there
> was no one but the lying-in woman.

> Her guide now took the bandage off her eyes, led her up to the bed,
> and recommending her to his wife, went away. She then helped to bring
> the babe into the world, put the woman to bed, washed the babe, and
> did everything that was requisite.

> The woman, grateful to the midwife, then secretly said to her: "I am a
> Christian woman as well as you; and I was carried off by a Water-man,
> who changed me. Whenever I bring a child into the world he always eats
> it on the third. day. Come on the third day to your pond, and you will
> see the water turned to blood. When my husband comes in now and offers
> you money, take no more from him than you usually get, or else he will
> twist your neck. Take good care!"

> Just then the husband came in. He was in a great passion, and he
> looked all about; and when he saw that all had gone on properly he
> bestowed great praise on the midwife. He then threw a great heap of
> money on the table, and said, "Take as much as you will!" She,
> however, prudently answered, "I desire no more from you than from
> others, and that is a small sum. If you give me that I am content; if
> you think it too much, I ask nothing from you but to take me home
> again." "It is God," says he, "has directed you to say that." He paid
> her then the sum she mentioned, and conducted her home honestly. She
> was, however, afraid to go to the pond at the appointed day.

>  

>   
> There are many other tales in Germany of midwives, and even ladies of
> rank, who have been called in to assist at Nix or Dwarf labours. The
> Ahnfrau von Ranzau, for example, and the Frau von Alvensleben--the
> Ladies Bountiful of Germany--were waked up in the night to attend the
> little women m their confinement. \[a\] There is the same danger in
> touching anything in the Dwarf as in the Nix abodes, but the Dwarfs
> usually bestow rings and other articles, which will cause the family
> to flourish. We have seen tales of the same kind in Scandinavia, and
> shall meet with them in many other countries.

> \[a\] A tale of this kind is to be seen in Luther's Table-talk, told
> by *die frau* *doctorin,* his wife. The scene of it was the river
> Mulda.
