THE WOUNDED SEAL

>   
> THERE once dwelt on the northern coast, not far from Taign Jan Crot
> Callow *(John o' Groat's House), a* man who gained his living by
> fishing. He was particularly devoted to the killing of the seals, in
> which he had great success. One evening just as he had returned home
> from his usual occupation, he was called upon by a man on horseback
> who was an utter stranger to him, but who said that he was come on the
> part of a person who wished to make a large purchase of seal-skins
> from him, and wanted to see him for that purpose that very evening. He
> therefore desired him to get up behind him and come away without any
> delay. Urged by the hope of profit he consented, and away they went
> with such speed that the wind which was in their backs seemed to be in
> their faces. At length they reached the verge of a stupendous
> precipice overhanging the sea, where his guide bade him alight, as
> they were now at the end of their journey. "But where," says he, "is
> the person you spoke of?" "You 'll see him presently," said the guide,
> and, catching hold of him, he plunged with him into the sea. They went
> down and down, till at last they came to a door which led into a range
> of apartments inhabited by seals, and the man to his amazement now saw
> that he himself was become one of these animals. They seemed all in
> low spirits, but they spoke kindly to him, and assured him of his
> safety. His guide now produced a huge *gully* or *joctaleg,* at sight
> of which, thinking his life was to be taken away, he began to cry for
> mercy. "Did you ever see this knife before?" said the guide. He looked
> at it and saw it was his own, which he had that very day stuck into a
> seal who had made his escape with it sticking in him. He did not,
> therefore, attempt to deny that it had been his property. "Well,"
> said. the guide, "that seal was my father. He now lies dangerously
> ill, and as it is only you that can cure him, I have brought you
> hither." He then led him into an inner room, where the old seal lay
> suffering grievously from a cut in his hind quarters. He was then
> desired to lay his hand on the wound, at which it instantly healed,
> and the patient arose hale and sound. All now was joy and festivity in
> the abode of the seals, and the guide, turning to the seal-hunter,
> said, "I will now take you back to your family, but you must first
> take a solemn oath never again to kill a seal as long as you live."
> Hard as the condition was, he cheerfully accepted it. His guide then
> laid hold on him, and they rose up, up, till they reached the surface
> of the sea, and landed at the cliff. He breathed on him and they
> resumed the human form. They then mounted the horse and sped away like
> lightning till they reached the fisherman's house. At parting his
> companion left with him such a present as made him think light of
> giving over his seal-hunting.
