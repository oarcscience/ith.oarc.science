DUKE MAGNUS AND THE MERMAID

>   
>   
>   
> DUKE MAGNUS looked out through the castle window,  
> How the stream ran so rapidly;  
> And there he saw how upon the stream sat  
> A woman most fair and lovelie,

> Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,  
> I pray you still so freely;  
> Say me not nay, but yes, yes!

> "O, to you I will give a travelling ship,  
> The best that a knight would guide;  
> It goeth as well on water as on firm land,  
> And through the fields all so wide.

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "O, to you will I give a courser gray,  
> The best that a knight would ride;  
> He goeth as well on water as on firm land,  
> And through the groves all so wide."

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "O, how should I plight me to you?  
> I never any quiet get;  
> I serve the king and my native land,  
> But with woman I match me not yet."

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "To you will I give as much of gold  
> As for more than your life will endure;  
> And of pearls and precious stones handfuls;  
> And all shall be so pure."

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "O gladly would I plight me to thee,  
> If thou wert of Christian kind;  
> But now thou art a vile sea-troll,  
> My love thou canst never win."

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, bethink thee well,  
> And answer not so haughtily;  
> For if thou wilt not plight thee to me,  
> Thou shalt ever crazy be."

> Duke Magnus, &c.

> "I am a king's son so good,  
> How can I let you gain me?  
> You dwell not on land, but in the flood,  
> Which would not with me agree."

> Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,  
> I offer you still so freely;  
> Say me not nay, but yes, yes! \[a\]
