GIOGA'S SON

>  

> A BOAT'S-CREW landed one time upon one of the stacks \[a\] with the
> intention of attacking the seals. They had considerable success;
> stunned several of them, and while they lay stupefied, stripped, them
> of their skins, with the fat attached to them. They left the naked
> carcases lying on the rocks, and were about to get into their boat
> with their spoils and return to Papa Stour, whence they had come. But
> just as they were embarking, there rose such a tremendous swell that
> they saw there was not a moment to be lost, and every one flew as
> quickly as he could to get on board the boat. They were all successful
> but one man, who had imprudently loitered behind. His companions were
> very unwilling to leave him on the skerries, perhaps to perish, but
> the surge increased so fast, that after many unsuccessful attempts to
> bring the boat in close to the stacks, they were obliged to depart,
> and leave the unfortunate man to his fate.

> A dark stormy night came on, the sea dashed most furiously against the
> rocks, and the poor deserted Shetlander saw no prospect before him but
> that of dying of the cold and hunger, or of being washed into the sea
> by the breakers, which now threatened every moment to run over the
> stack.

> At length he perceived several of the seals, who had escaped from the
> boatmen, approaching the skerry. When they landed they stripped off
> their seal-skin dresses and appeared in their proper forms of
> Sea-Trows. Their first object was to endeavour to recover their
> friends, who lay stunned and skinless. When they had succeeded in
> bringing them to themselves, they also resumed their proper form, and
> appeared in the shape of the sub-marine people. But in mournful tones,
> wildly accompanied by the raging storm, they lamented the loss of
> their sea-vestures, the want of which would for ever prevent them from
> returning to their native abodes beneath the deep waters of the
> Atlantic. Most of all did they lament for Ollavitinus, the son of
> Gioga, who, stripped of his seal-skin, must abide for ever in the
> upper world.

> Their song was at length broken off by their perceiving the
> unfortunate boatman, who, with shivering limbs an despairing looks,
> was gazing on the furious waves that now dashed over the stack. Gioga,
> when she saw him, instantly conceived the design of rendering the
> perilous situation of the man of advantage to her son. She went up to
> him, and mildly addressed him, proposing to carry him on her back
> through the sea to Papa Stour, on condition of his getting her the
> seal-skin of her son.

> The bargain was soon made, and Gioga equipped herself in her phocine
> garb; but when the Shetlander gazed on the stormy sea he was to ride
> through, his courage nearly failed him, and he begged of the old lady
> to have the kindness to allow him to cut a few holes in her shoulders
> and flanks, that he might obtain a better fastening for his hands
> between the skin and the flesh.

> This, too, her maternal tenderness induced Gioga to consent to. The
> man, having prepared everything, now mounted, and she plunged into the
> waves with him, gallantly ploughed the deep, and landed him safe and
> sound at Acres Gio, in Papa Stour. He thence set out for Skeo, at
> Hamna Voe, where the skin was, and honourably fulfilled his agreement
> by restoring to Gioga the means of bringing back her son to his dear
> native land.
