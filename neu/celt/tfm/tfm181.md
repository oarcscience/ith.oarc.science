> A DEMON, in the attire of a mourning widow, used, in the Eastern
> Russia, to go through the fields at noon in harvest-time, and break
> the legs and arms of the workmen, who failed, when they saw her, to
> fall on their faces. There was a remedy, however, against this. Trees,
> long venerated, grew in the adjacent wood, the bark of which being
> laid on the wound, removed the pain and healed it. \[a\]

> The Vends believe in a similar being; but a Vend knows that when be
> converses with her for an hour together about flax and the preparation

> without stopping, he is secure. \[b\]

> The Russians also believe in a species of water and wood-maids, called
> Rusalki. They are of a beautiful form, with long green hair; they
> swing and balance themselves on the branches of trees--bathe in lakes
> and rivers--play on the surface of the water--and wring their locks on
> the green meads at the water's-edge. It is chiefly at Whitsuntide that
> they appear, and the people then singing and dancing, weave garlands
> for them, which they cast into the stream. \[c\]

> The following is the Polish form of a legend which we have already met
> with in several places: \[d\]

> There came to a nobleman an unknown man, who called himself Iskrzycki
> *(spark or firestone),* and offered to engage in his service. The
> contract was drawn up and signed, when the master perceived that
> Iskrzycki had horse's hoofs, and he accordingly wanted to break off
> the agreement; but the servant stood on his right, and declared that
> he would enter on his duties, even against his master's will. From
> this time forwards he took up his abode invisibly in the stove, and
> performed all the tasks set him. People gradually grew accustomed to
> him, but at last the lady prevailed on her lord to remove, and he
> hired another estate. His people left the castle, and they had already
> gone the greater part of the way, when on a bad part of the road the
> carriage was near turning over, and the lady gave a loud cry of
> terror. Immediately a voice answered from behind the carriage--"Never
> fear! Iskrzycki is with you!" The lord and his lady now saw that there
> was no way of getting rid of him, so they went back to the old house,
> and lived there on good terms with their servant till the term of the
> engagement had arrived.

> The Servian ballads, that have lately appeared \[e\] have made us
> acquainted with an interesting species of beings called Vilas. These
> are represented as mountain-nymphs, young and beautiful, clad in
> white, with long flying hair. Their voice is said to resemble that of
> the woodpecker. They shoot, according to popular belief, deadly arrows
> at men, and sometimes carry off children, whom their mothers in their
> anger have consigned to them or the devil: yet the general character
> of the Vilas is to injure none but those who intrude upon their
> *kolos,* or roundels.

> The Vilas sometimes appear gaily dancing their kolos beneath the
> branches of the Vishnia or Vistula cherry; sometimes a Vila is
> introduced comforting the sorrows of an enarnoured deer; at other
> times collecting storms in the heavens; \[f\] now foretelling to a
> hero his impending death; \[g\] now ruthlessly casting down each night
> the walls of a rising fortress, till a young and. lovely female is
> immured. within them. \[h\] She usually rides a seven-year old hart,
> with a bridle made of snakes.

> The following are specimens of these Servian ballads:
