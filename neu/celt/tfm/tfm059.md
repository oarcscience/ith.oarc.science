ICELAND

>  

> Hvad mon da ei  
> Og her lyksalig leves kan? Jeg troer  
> Det mueligt, som för i Heden-Old  
> For rasks Skander mueligt det var,  
> Paa denne kolde Oe.  
> ISLANDSKE LANDLEVNET.

> What cannot one  
> Here, too, live happy? I believe it now  
> As possible, as in the heathen age,  
> For the bold Scandinavians it was,  
> On this cold isle.

> IT is in vain that we look into the works of travellers for
> information on the subject of popular belief in Iceland. Their
> attention was too much occupied by Geysers, volcanoes, agriculture,
> and religion, to allow them to devote any part of it to this, in their
> eyes, unimportant subject. So that, were it not for some short but
> curious notices given by natives of the island, we should be quite
> ignorant of the fate of the subordinate classes of the old religion in
> Iceland.

> Torfaeus, who wrote in the latter end of the seventeenth century,
> gives, in his preface to his edition of Hrolf Krakas Saga, the opinion
> of a venerable Icelandic pastor, named Einar Gudmund, respecting the
> Dwarfs. This opinion Torfaeus heard when a boy from the lips of the
> old man.

> "I believe, and am fully persuaded," said he, "that this people are
> the creatures of God, consisting of a body and a rational spirit; that
> they are of both sexes; marry, and have children; and that all human
> acts take place among them as with us: that they are possessed of
> cattle, and of many other kinds of property; have poverty and riches,
> weeping and laughter, sleep and wake, and have all other affections
> belonging to human nature; and that they enjoy a longer or a shorter
> term of life according to the will and pleasure of God. Their power of
> having children," he adds, "appears from this, that some of their
> women have had children by men, and were very anxious to have their
> offspring dipped in the sacred font, and initiated into Christianity;
> but they, in general, sought in vain. Thorkatla Mari, the wife of
> Karl, was pregnant by a Hill-man, but she did not bring the child
> Aresus into the world, as appears from the poems made on this fatal
> occasion.

> "There was formerly on the lands of Haga a nobleman named Sigvard
> Fostre, who had to do with a Hill-woman. He promised her faithfully
> that he would take care to have the child received into the bosom of
> the church. In due time the woman came with her child and laid it on
> the churchyard wall, and along with it a gilded cup and a holy robe
> (presents she intended making to the church for the baptism of her
> child), and then retired a little way. The pastor inquired who
> acknowledged himself the father of the child. Sigvard, perhaps, out of
> shame, did not venture to acknowledge himself. The clerk now asked him
> if it should be baptised or not. Sigvard said 'No,' lest by assenting
> he should be proved to be the father. The infant then was left where
> it was, untouched and unbaptised. The mother, filled with rage,
> snatched up her babe and the cup, but left the vestment, the remains
> of which may still be seen in Haga. That woman foretold and inflicted
> a singular disease on Sigvard and his posterity till the ninth
> generation, and several of his descendants are to this day afflicted
> with it. Andrew Gudmund (from which I am the seventh in descent) had
> an affair of the same kind. He also refused to have the child
> baptised, and he and his posterity have suffered a remarkable disease,
> of which very many of them have died; but some, by the interposition
> of good men, have escaped the deserved punishment."

> The fullest account we have of the Icelandic Elves or Dwarfs is
> contained in the following passage of the Ecclesiastical History of
> Iceland of the learned Finnus Johannaeus.

> "As we have not as yet," says he, "spoken a single word about the very
> ancient, and I know not whether more ridiculous or perverse,
> persuasion of our forefathers about semigods, this seems the proper
> place for saying a few words about this so celebrated figment, as it
> was chiefly in this period it attained its acmè, and it was believed
> as a true and necessary article of faith, that there are genii or
> semi-gods, called in our language Alfa and Alfa-folk.

> "Authors vary respecting their essence and origin. Some hold that they
> have been created by God immediately and without the intervention of
> parents, like some kinds of spirits: others maintain that they are
> sprung from Adam, but before the creation of Eve: \[a\] lastly, some
> refer them to another race of men, or to a stock of pre-Adamites. Some
> bestow on them not merely a human body, but an immortal soul: others
> assign them merely mortal breath *(spiritum)* instead of a soul,
> whence a certain blockhead, \[b\] in an essay written by him
> respecting them, calls them our half-kin
>
> (half-kyn).

> "According to the old wives' tales that are related about this race of
> genii who inhabit Iceland and its vicinity, they have a political form
> of government modelled after the same pattern as that which the
> inhabitants themselves are under. Two viceroys rule over them, who in
> turn every second year, attended by some of the subjects, sail to
> Norway, to present themselves before the monarch of the whole race,
> who resides there, and to give him a true report concerning the
> fidelity, good conduct, and obedience of the subjects; and those who
> accompany them are to accuse the government or viceroys if they have
> transgressed the bounds of justice or of good morals. If these are
> convicted of crime or injustice, they are forthwith stript of their
> office, and others are appointed in their place.

> "This nation is reported to cultivate justice and equity above all
> other virtues, and hence, though they are very potent, especially with
> words and imprecations, they very rarely, unless provoked or injured,
> do any mischief to man; but when irritated they avenge themselves on
> their enemies with dreadful curses and punishments.

> "The new-born infants of Christians are, before baptism, believed to
> be exposed to great peril of being stolen by them, and their own,
> which they foresee likely to be feeble in mind, in body, in beauty, or
> other gifts, being substituted for them. These supposititious children
> of the semigods are called Umskiptingar; whence nurses and midwives
> were strictly enjoined to watch constantly, and to hold the infant
> firmly in their arms, till it had had the benefit of baptism, lest
> they should furnish any opportunity for such a change. Hence it comes,
> that the vulgar use to call fools, deformed people, and those who act
> rudely and uncivilly, *Umskiptinga eins og hann sie ko minnaf Alfum,
> i.e.* changelings, and come of the Alfs.

> "They use rocks, bills, and even the seas, for their habitations,
> which withinside are neat, and all their domestic utensils extremely
> clean and orderly. They sometimes invite men home, and take especial
> delight in the converse of Christians, some of whom have had
> intercourse with their daughters or sisters, who are no less wanton
> than beautiful, and have had children by them, who must by all means
> be washed in holy water, that they may receive an immortal soul, and
> one that can be saved. Nay, they have not been ashamed to feign that
> certain women of them have been joined in lawful marriage with men,
> and continued for a long time with them, happily at first, but, for
> the most part, with an ill or tragical conclusion.

> "Their cattle, if not very numerous, are at least very profitable They
> are invisible as their owners are, unless when it pleases them to
> appear, which usually takes place when the weather is serene and the
> sun shining very bright; for as they do not see the sun within their
> dwellings, they frequently walk out in the sunshine that they may be
> cheered by his radiance. \[c\] Hence, even the coffins of dead kings
> and nobles, such as are the oblong stones which are to be seen here
> and there, in wildernesses and rough places, always lie in the open
> air and exposed to the sun.

> "They change their abodes and habitations occasionally like mankind;
> this they do on new-year's night; whence certain dreamers and
> mountebanks used on that night to watch in the roads, that, by the
> means of various forms of conjurations appointed for that purpose,
> they might extort from them as they passed along the knowledge of
> future events. \[d\] But people in general, who were not acquainted
> with such things, especially the heads of families, used on this
> evening strictly to charge their children and servants to be sure to
> be serious and modest in their actions and language, lest their
> invisible guests, and mayhap future neighbours, should be aggrieved or
> any way offended. Hence, when going to bed they did not shut the outer
> doors of their houses, nor even the door of the sitting-room, but
> having kindled a light, and laid out a table, they desired the
> invisible personages who had arrived, or were to arrive, to partake,
> if it was their pleasure, of the food that was laid out for them; and
> hoped that if it pleased them to dwell within the limits of their
> lands, they would live safe and sound, and be propitious to them. As
> this superstitious belief is extremely ancient, so it long continued
> in full vigour, and was held by some even within the memory of our
> fathers." \[e\]

> The Icelandic Neck, Kelpie, or Water-Spirit, is called Nickur, Ninnir,
> and Hnikur, one of the Eddaic names of Odin. He appears always in the
> form of a fine *apple-grey* horse on the sea-shore; but he may be
> distinguished from ordinary horses by the circumstance of his hoofs
> being reversed. If any one is so foolish as to mount him, he gallops
> off and plunges into the sea with his burden. He can, however, be
> caught in a particular manner, tamed, and made to work. \[f\]

> The Icelanders have the same notions respecting the seals which we
> shall find in the Feroes and Shetland. It is a common opinion with
> them that King Pharaoh and his army were changed into these animals.

> Some Icelanders of the present day say, that one day, when Eve was
> washing her children at the running water, God suddenly called her.
> She was frightened, and thrust aside such of them as were not clean.
> God asked her if all her children were there, and she said, Yes; but
> got for answer, that what she tried to hide from God should be hidden

> \[d\] There was a book of prophecies called the *Kruckspá,* or
> Prophecy of Kruck, a man who was said to have lived in the 15th

> \[e\] Finni Johannaei Historia Ecclesiastica Islandiae, tom. ii. p.
