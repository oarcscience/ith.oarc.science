THE WILD-WOMEN

>  

> Ein Mägdlein kam tin Abendglanz,  
> Wie ich's noch me gefunden.  
> SCHRIEBER.

> A maiden came in Evening's glow,  
> Such as I ne'er have met.

>  

> THE Wilde Frauen or Wild-women of Germany bear a very strong
> resemblance to the Elle-maids of Scandinavia. Like them they are
> beautiful, have fine flowing hair, live within hills, and only appear
> singly or in the society of each other. They partake of the piety of
> character we find among the German Dwarfs.

> The celebrated Wunderberg, or Underberg, on the great moor near
> Salzburg, is the chief haunt of the Wild-women. The Wunderberg is said
> to be quite hollow, and supplied with stately palaces, churches,
> monasteries, gardens, and springs of gold and silver. Its inhabitants,
> beside the Wild-women, are little men, who have charge of the
> treasures it contains, and who at midnight repair to Salzburg to
> perform their devotions in the cathedral; giants, who used to come to
> the church of Grödich and exhort the people to lead a godly and pious
> life; and the great emperor Charles V., with golden crown and sceptre,
> attended by knights and lords. His grey beard has twice encompassed
> the table at which he sits, and when it has the third time grown round
> it, the end of the world and the appearance of the Antichrist will
> take place. \[a\]

> The following is the only account we have of the Wild-women.

> The inhabitants of the village of Grödich and the peasantry of the
> neighbourhood assert that frequently, about the year 1753, the
> Wild-women used to come out of the Wunderberg to the boys and girls
> that were keeping the cattle near the hole within Glanegg, and give
> them bread to eat.

> The Wild-women used frequently to come to where the people were
> reaping. They came down early in the morning, and in the evening, when
> the people left off work, they went back into the Wunderberg without
> partaking of the supper.

> It happened once near this hill, that a little boy was sitting on a
> horse which his father had tethered on the headland of the field. Then
> came the Wild-women out of the hill and wanted to take away the boy by
> force. But the father, who was well acquainted with the secrets of
> this hill, and what used to occur there, without any dread hasted up
> to the women and took the boy from them, with these words': "What
> makes you presume to come so often out of the hill, and now to take
> away my child with you? What do you want to do with him?" The
> Wild-women answered:

> "He will be better with us, and have better care taken of him than at
> home. We shall be very fond of the boy, and he will meet with no
> injury." But the father would not let the boy out of his hands, and
> the Wild-women went away weeping bitterly.

> One time the Wild-women came out of the Wunderberg, near the place
> called the Kugelmill, which is prettily situated on the side of this
> hill, and took away a boy who was keeping cattle. This boy, whom every
> one knew, was seen about a year after by some wood-cutters, in a green
> dress, and sitting on a block of this hill. Next day they took his
> parents with them, intending to search the hill for him, but they all
> went about it to no purpose, for the boy never appeared any more.

> It frequently has happened that a Wild-woman out of the Wunderberg has
> gone toward the village of Anif, which is better than a mile from the
> hill. She used to make holes and beds for herself in the ground. She
> had uncommonly long and beautiful hair, which reached nearly to the
> soles of her feet*.* A peasant belonging to the village often saw this
> woman going and coming, and he fell deeply in love with he; especially
> on account of her beautiful hair. He could not refrain from going up
> to he; and he gazed on her with delight; and at last, in his
> simplicity, he laid himself without any repugnance, down by her side.
> The second night the Wild-woman asked him if he had not a wife
> already? The peasant however denied his wife, and said he had not.

> His wife meanwhile was greatly puzzled to think where it was that her
> husband went every evening, and slept every night. She therefore
> watched him and found him in the field sleeping near the
> Wild-woman:--" Oh, God preserve thy beautiful hair!" said she to the
> Wild-woman; "what are you doing there?" \[b\] With these words the
> peasant's wife retired and left them, and her husband was greatly
> frightened at it. But the Wild-woman upbraided him with his false
> denial, and said to him, "Had your wife manifested hatred and spite
> against me, you would now be unfortunate, and would never leave this
> place; but since your wife was not malicious, love her from
> henceforth, and dwell with her faithfully, and never venture more to
> come here, for it is written, 'Let every one live faithfully with his
> wedded wife;' though the force of this commandment will greatly
> decrease, and with it all the temporal prosperity of married people.
> Take this shoefull of money from me: go home, and look no more about
> you."

>  

>  

> As the fair maiden who originally possessed the famed Oldenburg Horn
> was probably a Wild-woman, we will place the story of it here.

> \[a\] All relating to the Wild-women and the Wunderberg is given by
> MM. Grimm from the Brixener Volksbuch, 1782. For an account of the

> \[b\] In a similar tradition (Strack, Beschr. von Eilsen, p. 120) the
> wife cuts off one of her fair long tresses, and is afterwards most
> earnestly conjured by her to restore it.
