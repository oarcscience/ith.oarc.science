THE THREE LEPRECHAUNS

>  

> MRS. L. having heard that Molly Toole, an old woman who held a few
> acres of land from Mr. L., had seen Leprechauns, resolved to visit
> her, and learn the truth from her own lips. Accordingly, one Sunday,
> after church, she made her appearance at Molly's residence, which
> was--no very common thing--extremely neat and comfortable. As she
> entered, every thing looked gay and cheerful. The sun shone bright in
> through the door on the earthen floor. Molly was seated at the far
> side of the fire in her arm-chair; her daughter Mary, the prettiest
> girl on the lands, was looking to the dinner that was boiling; and her
> son Mickey, a young man of about two-and-twenty, was standing lolling
> with his back against the dresser.

> The arrival of the mistress disturbed the stillness that had hitherto
> prevailed. Mary, who was a great favourite, hastened to the door to
> meet her, and shake hands with her. Molly herself had nearly got to
> the middle of the floor when the mistress met her, and Mickey modestly
> staid where he was till he should catch her attention. "O then, musha!
> but isn't it a glad sight for my ould eyes to see your own silf undher
> my roof? Mary, what ails you, girl? and why don't you go into the room
> and fetch out a good chair for the misthress to sit down upon and rest
> herself?" "Deed faith, mother, I 'm so glad I don't know what I 'm
> doin'. Sure you know I didn't see the misthress since she cum down
> afore."

> Mickey now caught Mrs. L.'s eye, and she asked him how he did. "By
> Gorra, bravely, ma'am, thank you," said be, giving himself a wriggle,
> while his two hands and the small of his back rested on the edge of
> the dresser.

> "Now, Mary, stir yourself alanna," said the old woman, "and get out
> the bread and butther. Sure you know the misthress can't but be hungry
> afther her walk."--" O, never mind it, Molly; it's too much
> trouble."--" Throuble, indeed! it 's as nice butther, ma'am, as iver
> you put a tooth in; and it was Mary herself that med it."--" O, then I
> must taste it."

> A nice half griddle of whole-meal bread and a print of fresh butter
> were now produced, and Molly helped the mistress with her own hands.
> As she was eating, Mary kept looking in her face, and at last said,
> "Ah then, mother, doesn't the misthress luk mighty well? Upon my
> faikins, ma'am, I never seen you luking half so handsome."--" Well!
> and why wouldn't she luk well? And niver will she luk betther nor be
> betther nor I wish her."--" Well, Molly, I think I may return the
> compliment, for Mary is prettier than ever; and as for yourself, I
> really believe it 's young again you're growing."--" Why, God be
> thanked, ma'am, I 'm stout and hearty; and though I say it mysilf,
> there 'a not an ould woman in the county can stir about betther nor
> me, and I 'm up ivery mornin' at the peep of day, and rout them all up
> out of their beds. Don't I?" said she, looking at Mary.--" Faith, and
> sure you do, mother," replied Mickey; "and before the peep of day,
> too; for you have no marcy in you at all at all."--" Ah, in my young
> days," continued the old woman, "people woren't slugabeds; out airly,
> home late--that was the way wid thim."--" And usedn't people to see
> Leprechauns in thim days, mother?" said Mickey, laughing.--" Hould
> your tongue, you saucy cub, you," cried Molly; "what do you know about
> thim?"--" Leprechauns?"' said Mrs. L., gladly catching at the
> opportunity; "did people really, Molly, see Leprechauns in your young
> days?*"--"* Yes, indeed, ma'am; some people say they did," replied
> Molly, very composedly.--" O com' now, mother," cried Mickey, "don't
> think to be goin' it upon us that away; you know you seen thim one
> time yoursilf, and you hadn't the gumption in you to cotch thim, and
> git their crocks of gould from thim."--" Now, Molly, is that really
> true that you saw the Leprechauns?"--" 'Deed, and did I, ma'am; but
> this boy 's always laughin' at me about thim, and that makes me rather
> shy in talkin' o' thim"--" Well, Molly, *I* won't laugh at you; so,
> come, tell me how you saw them."

> "Well, ma'am, you see it was whin I was jist about the age of Mary,
> there. I was comin' home late one Monday evenin' from the market; for
> my aunt Kitty, God be marciful to her! would keep me to take a cup of
> tay. It was in the summer time, you see, ma'am, much about the middle
> of Tune, an' it was through the fields I come. Well, ma'am, as I was
> sayin', it was late in the evenin', that is, the sun was near goin'
> down, an' the light was straight in my eyes, an' I come along through
> the bog-meadow; for it was shortly afther I was married to him that 'a
> gone, an' we wor livin' in this very house you're in now; an' thin
> whin I come to the castle-field--the pathway you know, ma'am, goes
> right through the middle uv it--an' it was thin as fine a field of
> whate, jist shot out, as you'd wish to luk at; an' it was a purty
> sight to see it wavin' so beautifully wid every air of wind that was
> goin' over it, dancin' like to the music of a thrash, that was singin'
> down below in the hidge. \[a\] Well, ma'am, I crasst over the style
> that 'a there yit, and wint along fair and aisy, till I was near about
> the middle o' the field, whin somethin' med me cast my. eyes to the
> ground, a little before me; an' thin I saw, as sure as I 'm sittin'
> here, no less nor three o' the Leprechauns, all bundled together like
> so miny tailyors, in the middle o' the path before me. They worn't
> hammerin' their pumps, nor makin' any kind, of n'ise whatever; but
> there they wor, the three little fellows, wid their cocked hats upon
> thim, an' their legs gothered up undher thim, workin' away at their
> thrade as hard as may be. If you wor only to see, ma'am, how fast
> their little ilbows wint as they pulled out their inds! Well, every
> one o' thim had his eye cocked upon me, an' their eyes wor as bright
> as the eye of a frog, an' I cudn't stir one step from the spot for the
> life o' me.. So I turned my head round, and prayed to the Lord in his
> marcy to deliver me from thim, and when I wint to luk at thim agin,
> ma'am, not a sight o' thim was to be seen: they wor gone like a
> dhrame."--" But, Molly, why did you not catch them?"--" I was afeard,
> ma'am, that 'a the thruth uv it; but maybe I was as well widout thim.
> I niver h'ard tell of a Leprechaun yit that wasn't too many for any
> one that cotch him."--" Well, and Molly, do you think there are any
> Leprechauns now?"--" It 's my belief, ma'am, they're all gone out of
> the country, diver and dane, along wid the Fairies; for I niver hear
> tell o' thim now at all."

> Mrs. L. having now attained her object, after a little more talk with
> the good old woman, took her leave, attended by Mary, who would see
> her a piece of the way home. And Mary being asked what she thought of
> the Leprechauns, confessed her inability to give a decided opinion:
> her mother, she knew, was incapable of telling a lie, and yet she had
> her doubts if there ever were such things as Leprechauns.

> anything similar of a Leprechaun.
