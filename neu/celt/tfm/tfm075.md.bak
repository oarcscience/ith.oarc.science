THE FRIENDLY DWARFS'

>  

> CLOSE to the little town of Dardesheim, between Halberstadt and
> Brunswick, is a spring of the finest water called the Smansborn, and
> which flows out of a hill in which in old. times the dwarfs dwelt.
> When the former inhabitants of the country were in want of a
> holiday-dress, or, at a family festival, of any rare utensils, they
> went and stood before this Dwarf-hill, knocked three times, and
> pronounced their petition in a distinct and. audible tone, adding,

> Before the sun is up to-morrow.  
> At the hill shall be the things we borrow.

> The Dwarfs thought themselves sufficiently compensated if there was
> only some of the festive victuals set down before the hill.
