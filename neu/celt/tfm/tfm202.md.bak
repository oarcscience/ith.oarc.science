A FAREWELL

>  

> FAREWELL! farewell! the parting hour  
> Is come, and I must leave thee!  
> Oh! ne'er may aught approach thy bower  
> That might of bliss bereave thee!

> But ever a perennial rill  
> Of joy, so brightly flowing,  
> Keep each fair thought in fragrance still  
> Within thy pure mind blowing.

> For life all charm had lost for me,  
> My thoughts were only sadness,  
> When fortune led me unto thee  
> To taste once more of gladness.--

> I've seen the sullen shades of night  
> Fair nature's face concealing,  
> And marked how scattered rays of light  
> Came morn's approach revealing.

> The light increased, the orb of day  
> Clomb to the mountain's summit;  
> And vale and plain, and stream and bay,  
> Drew life and lustre from it.

> And as it towered in majesty,  
> Light all around it shedding,  
> It seemed a monarch, seated high,  
> Bliss through his realms wide spreading.

> All nature joyed; I felt my heart  
> Distend, and fill with pleasure;  
> For heavenly light and warmth impart  
> A bliss we cannot measure.

> This glorious sun to me art thou,  
> Whose light all gloom dispelleth,  
> Before whose majesty I bow  
> When he his power revealeth.

> Thy golden locks, thine eyes so blue,  
> Thy smile so sweetly playing,  
> Were those first shafts of light that flew,  
> The gloom of night warraying.

> But when, more intimately known,  
> I found not only beauty,  
> But genius, taste, and truth, thine own,  
> Combined with filial duty:

> Then rose the sun, o'er all my soul  
> In full effulgence beaming,  
> And tides of joy began to roll  
> Beneath his radiance gleaming.--

> Time still his noiseless course pursues  
> With unremitting vigour,  
> And lovely Spring each year renews  
> The waste of Winter's rigour.

> Were mine the power, thus, like Time,  
> To wake again life's flowers,  
> And days recall of youthful prime  
> Passed in the Muses' bowers;

> Then, lovely maiden! fancy-free,  
> Rich in each mental treasure,  
> In me thou wouldst a votary see--  
> Thy will would be my pleasure.

> But while such bliss might not be mine,  
> A friendship pure and holy  
> I offered at the hallowed shrine,  
> To which my heart turned solely.--

> When distant from thee many a mile,  
> High waves between us swelling,  
> I'll think upon thy lovely smile,  
> Of pure emotion telling.

> The sky will show me thy blue eye;  
> The whispering breeze of even  
> Recall that voice, whose melody  
> Oft lapped my soul in heaven!

> The sinking sun thy ringlets' gold  
> Will show; but memory only  
> The treasures of thy mind unfold  
> To me when musing lonely.

> Oh! may I hope that memory,  
> That power for ever changing,  
> Will make thee sometimes think on me,  
> O'er distant mountains ranging?

> Say me not nay; let Fancy cheat  
> My soul with bland illusion;  
> And let not Doubt my vision sweet  
> Dispel by rude intrusion.
