KING GOLDEMAR

>  

> ANOTHER celebrated House-spirit was King Goldemar, who lived in great
> intimacy with Neveling von Hardenberg, on the Hardenstein at the Rühr,
> and often slept in the same bed with him. He played most beautifully
> on the harp, and he was in the habit of staking great sums of money at
> dice. He used to call Neveling brother-in-law, and often gave him
> warning of various things. He talked with all kinds of people, and
> used to make the clergy blush by discovering their secret
> transgressions. His hands were thin like those of a frog, cold and
> soft to the feel; he let himself be felt, but no one could see him.
> After remaining there for three years, he went away without offending
> any one. Some call him King Vollmar, and the chamber in which he lived
> is still said to be called Vollmar's Chamber. He insisted on having a
> place at the table for himself, and a stall in the stable for his
> horse; the food, the hay, and the oats were consumed, but of man or
> horse nothing more than the shadow ever was seen. When one time a
> curious person had strewed ashes and tares in his way to make him
> fall, that his foot-prints might be seen, he came behind him as be was
> lighting the fire and hewed him to pieces, which he put on the spit
> and roasted, and he began to boil the head and legs. As soon as the
> meat was ready it was brought to *Vollmar's* chamber, and people heard
> great cries of joy as it was consumed. After this there was no trace
> of King Voilmar; but over the door of his chamber was found written,
> that in future the house would be as unfortunate as it had hitherto
> been fortunate; the scattered property would not be brought together
> again till the time when three Hardenbergs of Hardenstein should be
> living at the same time. The spit and the roast meat were preserved
> for a long time; but they disappeared in the Lorrain war in 1651. The
> pot still remains built into the wall of the kitchen. \[a\]
