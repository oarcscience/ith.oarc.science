BRITTANY

> Mut ant este noble Barun

> Marie de France.

> Thise oldé gentil Bretons in hir dayes  
> Of diverse aventurès maden layes.

> Chaucer

> BRITTANY, the ancient Armorica, retains perhaps as unmixed a
> population as any part of Western Europe. Its language has been,
> however, like the Welsh and the Celtic dialects, greatly affected by
> the Latin and Teutonic. The ancient intercourse kept up with Wales and
> Cornwall by the Bretons, who were in a great measure colonists from
> these parts of Britain, caused the traditions and poetry of the latter
> to be current and familiar in Little Britain, as that country was then
> called. To poetry and music, indeed, the whole Celto-Cymric race seem
> to have been strongly addicted; and, independently of the materials
> which Brittany may have supplied for the history of Geoffrey of
> Monmouth, many other true or romantic adventures were narrated by the
> Breton poets in their Lais. Several of these Lais were translated into
> French verse in the thirteenth century by a poetess named Marie de
> France, resident at the court of the English monarchs of the house of
> Plantagenet, to one of whom, probably Henry the Third, her Lais are
> dedicated. \[a\] This circumstance may account for the Lais being
> better known in England than in France. The only manuscript containing
> any number of them is in the Harleian Library; for those of France
> contain but five Lais. The Lai du Fresne was translated into English;
> and from the Lai de Lanval and Lai de Graelent--which last by the way
> is not in the Harleian Collection--Chestre made his Launfal Miles, or
> Sir Launfal Chaucer perhaps took the concluding circumstance of his
> Dream from the Lai de Eliduc.

> In some of these Lais we meet with what may be regarded as Fairy
> machinery. The word Fée, indeed, occurs only once; but in the Lais de
> Gugemer, de Lanval, d'Ywenec, and de Graelent, personages are to be
> met with differing in nothing from the Fays of Romance, and who, like
> them, appear to be human beings endowed with superior powers.

> The origin of the Breton Korrigan, as they are called, has been
> sought, and not improbably, in the Gallicenae \[b\] or ancient Gaul,
> of whom Pomponius Mela thus writes:-

> "Sena \[c\] in the British sea, opposite the Ofismician. coast, is
> remarkable for an oracle of the Gallic God. Its priestesses, holy in
> perpetual virginity, are said to be *nine* in number. They are called
> Gallicenae, and are thought to be endowed with singular powers, so as
> to raise by their charms the winds and seas, *to turn themselves into
> what animals they will,* to cure wounds and diseases incurable by
> others, to know and predict the future; but this they do only to
> navigators who go thither purposely to consult them." \[d\]

> We have here certainly all the attributes of the Damoiselles of the
> Lais of Marie de France. The doe whom Gugemer wounds speaks with a
> human voice. The lady who loved Lanval took him away into an island,
> and Graelent and his mistress crossed a deep and broad river to arrive
> at her country, which perhaps was also an island in the original
> Breton Lai. The part most difficult of explanation is the secret
> manner in which these dames used to visit their lovers; but perhaps
> the key is to be found in the Lai d'Ywenec, of which, chiefly on that
> account, we give an analysis. The hero of that Lai differs not in
> point of power from these ladies, and as he is a real man, with the
> power of assuming at will the shape of a bird, so it is likely they
> were real women, and that it was in the bird-shape they entered the
> chambers of their lovers. Graelent's mistress says to him, \[e\]

> I shall love you trewely;  
> But one thing I forbid straitly,  
> You must not utter a word apérte  
> Which might our love make discovérte.  
> I will give unto you richly,  
> Gold and silver, clothes, and fee.  
> Much love shall be between us two--  
> Night and day I'll go to you:  
> You'll see me come to you always--  
> With me laugh and talk you may.  
> You shall no comrade have to see,  
> Or who shall know my privacy,

> \* \* \*

> Take care now that you do not boast  
> Of things by which I may be lost.

> The lady says to Lanval,

> When you would speak to me of ought--  
> You must in no place form the thought  
> Where no one could meet his amie  
> Without reproach and villainie--  
> I will be presently with you,  
> All your commands ready to do;  
> No one but you will me see,  
> Or hear the words that come from me.

> She also bad previously imposed on the knight the obligation of
> secresy.

> As a further proof of the identity of the Korrigan and the Gallicenae,
> it may be remarked, that in the evidently very ancient Breton poem,
> Ar-Rannou, or The Series, we meet the following passage:--"There are
> *nine* Korrigen, who dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of
> white wool, around the fountain, by the light of the full moon." \[f\]
