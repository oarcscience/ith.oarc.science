ADDLERS AND MENTERS

>   
>   
> An old lady in Yorkshire related as follows:--My eldest daughter
> Betsey was about four years old; I remember it was on a fine summer's
> afternoon, or rather evening, I was seated in this chair which I now
> occupy. The child had been in the garden, she came into that entry or
> passage from the kitchen (on the right side of the entry was the old
> parlour-door, on the left the door of the common sitting-room; the
> mother of the child was in a line with both the doors); the child,
> instead of turning towards the sitting-room made a pause at the
> parlour-door, which was open. She stood several minutes quite still;
> at last I saw her draw her hand quickly towards her body; she set up a
> loud shriek and ran, or rather flew, to me crying out "Oh! Mammy,
> green man will hab me! green man will hab me!" It was a long time
> before I could pacify her; I then asked her why she was so frightened.
> "O Mammy," she said, "all t'parlour is full of *addlers* and
> *menters."* Elves and fairies (spectres?) I suppose she meant. She
> said they were dancing, and a little man in a green coat with a
> gold-laced cocked hat on his head, offered to take her hand as if he
> would have her as his partner in the dance. The mother, upon hearing
> this, went and looked into the old parlour, but the fairy vision had
> melted into thin air. "Such," adds the narrator, "is the account I
> heard of this vision of fairies. The person is still alive who
> witnessed or supposed she saw it, and though a well-informed person,
> still positively asserts the relation to be strictly true. \[a\]

> Ritson, who was a native of the bishoprick of Durham, tells us \[b\]
> that the fairies frequented many parts of it; that they were described
> as being of the smallest size, and uniformly habited in green. They
> could, however, change their size and appearance. "A woman," he says,
> "who had been in their society challenged one of the guests whom she
> espied in the market selling fairy-butter. \[c\] This freedom was
> deeply resented, and cost her the eye she first saw him with. Some one
> informed him that an acquaintance of his in Westmoreland, wishing to
> see a fairy, was told that on such a day on the side of such a hill,
> he should be gratified. He went, and there, to use his own words, "the
> hobgoblin stood before him in the likeness of a green-coat lad," but
> vanished instantly. This, he said, the man told him. A female relation
> of his own told Mr. Ritson of Robin Goode fellow's, it would seem,
> thrashing the corn, churning the butter, drinking the milk, etc., and
> when all was done, lying before the fire " *like a great rough hurgin*
> (hugging?) *bear."* \[d\]

> The Menyn Tylna Têg or Fairy-butter of Wales, we are told in the same
> place, is a substance found at a great depth in cavities of
> limestone-rocks when sinking for lead-ore.

> The Barguest used also to appear in the shape of a mastiff-dog and
> other animals, and terrify people with his *skrikes.* (shrieks). There
> was a Barguest named the Pick-tree Brag, whose usual form was that of
> a little galloway, "in which shape a farmer, still or lately living
> thereabouts, reported that it had come to him one night as he was
> going home; that he got upon it and rode very quietly till it came to
> a great pond, to which it ran and threw him in, and
>
> went laughing away."

> In Northumberland the belief in the fairies is not yet extinct. The
> writer from whom we derive the following legends tells us \[e\] that
> he knew an old man whose dog had *pointed* a troop of fairies, \[f\]
> and though he could not see them he plainly heard their music sounding
> like a fiddle and a *very small* pair of pipes. He also tells us, that
> many years ago a girl who lived near Nether Witton, as she was
> returning from milking with her pail on her head, saw the fairies
> playing in the fields, and though she pointed them out to her
> companions they could not see them. The reason it seemed was her
> *weise* or pad for bearing the pail on her head was composed of
> four-leaved clover, which gives the power of seeing fairies. Spots are
> pointed out in sequestered places as the favourite haunts of the
> elves. A few miles from Alnwick is a fairy-ring, round which if people
> run more than nine times, some evil will befall them. The children
> constantly run this number, but nothing will induce them to venture a
> tenth run.

> \[c\] In Northumberland the common people call a certain fungous
> excrescence, sometimes found about the roots of old trees,
> Fairy-butter. After great rains and in a certain degree of
> putrefaction, it is reduced to a consistency, which, together with its
> colour, makes it not unlike butter, and hence the name. Brand, Popular
