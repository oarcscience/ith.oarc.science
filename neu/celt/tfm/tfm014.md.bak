THORSTON AND THE DWARF

>   
>   
> WHEN spring came, Thorston made ready his ship, and put twenty-four
> men on board of her. When they came to Vinland, they ran her into a
> harbour, and every day he went on shore to amuse himself.

> He came one day to an open part of the wood, where he saw a great
> rock, and out a little way from it a Dwarf, who was horridly ugly, and
> was looking up over his head with his mouth wide open; and it appeared
> to Thorston that it ran from ear to ear, and that the lower jaw came
> down to his knees. Thorston asked him, why he was acting so foolishly.
> "Do not be surprised, my good lad," replied the Dwarf; "do you not see
> that great dragon that is flying up there? He has taken off my son,
> and I believe that it is Odin himself that has sent the monster to do
> it. But I shall burst and die if I lose my son." Then Thorston shot at
> the dragon, and bit him under one of the wings, so that he fell dead
> to the earth; but Thorston caught the Dwarf's child in the air, and
> brought him to his father.

> The Dwarf was exceeding glad, and was more rejoiced than any one could
> tell; and he said, "A great benefit have I to reward you for, who are
> the deliverer of my son; and now choose your recompense in gold and
> silver.' "Cure your son;" said Thorston, "but I am not used to take
> rewards for my services." "It were not becoming," said the Dwarf, "if
> I did not reward you; and let not my shirt of sheeps' -wool, which I
> will give you, appear a contemptible gift, for you will never be tired
> when swimming, or get a wound, if you wear it next your skin."

> Thorston took the shirt and put it on, and it fitted him well, though
> it had appeared too short for the Dwarf. The Dwarf now took a gold
> ring out of his purse and gave it to Thorston, and bid him to take
> good care of it, telling him that he never should want for money while
> be kept that ring. He next took a black stone and gave it to Thorston,
> and said, "If you hide this stone in the palm of your hand no one will
> see you. I have not many more things to offer you, or that would be of
> any value to you; I will, however, give you a fire-stone for your
> amusement."

> He then took the stone out of his purse, and with a steel point. The
> stone was triangular, white on one side and red on the other, and a
> yellow border ran round it. The Dwarf then said, "If you prick the
> stone with the point in the white side, there will come on such a
> hail-storm that no one will be able to look at it; but if you want to
> stop this shower, you have only to prick on the yellow part, and there
> will come so much sunshine that the whole will melt away. But if you
> should like to prick the red side, then there will come out of it such
> fire, with sparks and crackling, that no one will be able to look at
> it, You may also get whatever you will by means of this point and
> stone, and they will come of themselves back to your band when you
> call them. I can now give you no more such gifts."

> Thorston then thanked the Dwarf for his presents, and returned to his
> men, and it was better for him to have made this voyage than to have
> stayed at home.
