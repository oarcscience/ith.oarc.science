THE DWARFS ON THE TREE

>   
> IN the summer-time the troop of the Dwarfs came in great numbers down
> from the hills into the valley, and joined the men that were at work,
> either assisting them or merely looking on. They especially liked to
> be with the mowers in the hay-making season, seating themselves,
> greatly to their satisfaction, on the long thick branch of a
> maple-tree, among the dense foliage. But one time some mischief-loving
> people came by night and sawed the branch nearly through. The
> unsuspecting Dwarfs, as usual, sat down on it in the morning; the
> branch snapt in two, and the Dwarfs were thrown to the ground. When
> the people laughed at them they became greatly incensed, and cried
> out,

> O how is heaven so high  
> And perfidy so great!  
> Hero to-day and never more!

> and they never let themselves again be seen. \[a\]

> It is also related that it was the custom of the Dwarfs to seat
> themselves on a large piece of rock, and thence to look on. the
> haymakers when at work. But some mischievous people lighted a lire on
> the rock and made it quite hot, and then sweet off all the coals. In
> the morning the little people, coming to take their usual station,
> burned themselves in a lamentable manner. Full of anger, they cried
> out, "O wicked world! O wicked world!" called aloud for vengeance, and
> disappeared for ever.
