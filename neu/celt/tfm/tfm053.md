THE NIS RIDING

>  

> THERE was a Nis in a farm-house, who was for ever tormenting the
> maids, and playing all manner of roguish tricks on them, and they in
> return were continually planning how to be even with him. There came
> one time to the farm-house a Juttish drover and put up there for the
> night. Among his cattle, there was one very large Juttish ox; and when
> Nis saw him in the stable he took a prodigious fancy to get up and
> ride on his back. He accordingly mounted the ox, and immediately began
> to torment the beast in such a manner that he broke loose from his
> halter and ran out into the yard with the Nis on his back. Poor Nis
> was now terrified in earnest, and began to shout and bawl most
> lustily. His cries awakened the maids, but instead of coming to his
> assistance they laughed at him till they were ready to break their
> hearts. And when the ox ran against a piece of timber, so that the
> unfortunate Nis had his hood all torn by it, the maids shouted out and
> called him "Lame leg, Lame leg," and he made off with himself in most
> miserable plight. But the Nis did not forget it to the maids; for the
> following Sunday when they were going to the dance, he contrived,
> unknown to them, to smut their faces all over, so that when they got
> up to dance, every one that was there burst out a laughing at them.
