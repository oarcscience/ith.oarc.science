<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>IN those blest days, when free from care, <BR>
And happy as the birds in air,<BR>
I roamed the hills and dales,<BR>
By purling rills oft passed the day,<BR>
Or on green banks recumbent lay,<BR>
Listening the shepherds' tales,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My fancy, rising on the wing,<BR>
Would visions fair before me bring,<BR>
Of castles high, and towers,<BR>
With knights in radiant panoply,<BR>
And ladies of the beaming eye,<BR>
Within their fragrant bowers;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Or lead me thence away to shades<BR>
Of woods, and show me, in the glades, <BR>
The cottages serene,<BR>
Where Peace dwelt with Content, among <BR>
The happy, gay Arcadian throng<BR>
That tenanted the scene.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But whether cot or tower arose <BR>
In vision, at the dawn or close<BR>
Of summer-days, to me,<BR>
The lovely form of woman still<BR>
Shone bright by dale, by mend, by rill, <BR>
Amid my extacy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I saw her robed in every grace<BR>
With youth, with loveliness of face,<BR>
And virtue's gentle eye;<BR>
And<I> </I>from her tongue heard accents fail, <BR>
That would the rudest heart enthral, <BR>
And raise emotions high.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But like the Eastern prince, who loved <BR>
The pictured form of one that moved <BR>
In life full many a year<BR>
Ere he beheld the light, I deemed<BR>
The lovely form of which I dreamed <BR>
Would ne'er to me appear.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And years came on, and years went by, <BR>
And yet I never found me nigh<BR>
My youthful vision bright.<BR>
I said,--I might as well, I ween,<BR>
Expect to see the Fairy-queen<BR>
Descend, to bless my sight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But often, when we hope it least,<BR>
And when our search has well nigh ceased, <BR>
Good fortune will befall:<BR>
So I one evening saw a maid,<BR>
Who every grace and charm displayed <BR>
That decked my <I>Ideal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
</I><BLOCKQUOTE>Her portrait here I need not show,<BR>
For, reader, thou must surely know<BR>
That peerless, gentle maid:<BR>
To her these lines I consecrate;<BR>
And if she smiles I'II deem, elate,<BR>
My toil far overpaid.</BLOCKQUOTE>
