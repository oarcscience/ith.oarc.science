ELVES

>  

> Säg, kännar du Elfvornas glada slägt?  
> De bygga ved fiodernas rand;  
> De spinna af månsken sin högtidsdrägt,  
> Med liljehvit spelande hand.  
> STAGNELIUS.

> Say, knowest thou the Elves' gay and joyous race?  
> The banks of streams are their home;  
> They spin of the moonshine their holiday-dress,  
> With their lily-white hands frolicsome.

>  

> THE Alfar still live in the memory and traditions of the peasantry of
> Scandinavia. They also, to a certain extent, retain their distinction
> into White and Black. The former, or the Good Elves, dwell in the air,
> dance on the grass, or sit in the leaves of trees; the latter, or Evil
> Elves, are regarded as an underground people, who frequently inflict
> sickness or injury on mankind; for which there is a particular kind of
> doctors called *Kloka män,* \[a\] to be met with in all parts of the
> country.

> The Elves are believed to have their kings, and to celebrate their
> weddings and banquets, just the same as the dwellers above ground.
> There is an interesting intermediate class of them in popular
> tradition called the Hill-people *(Högfolk),* who are believed to
> dwell in caves and small hills: when they show themselves they have a
> handsome human form. The common people seem to connect with them a
> deep feeling of melancholy, as if bewailing a half-quenched hope of
> redemption. \[b\]

> There are only a few old persons now who can tell any thing more about
> them than of the sweet singing that may occasionally on summer nights
> be beard out of their hills, when one stands still and listens, or, as
> it is expressed in the ballads, "lays his ear to the Elve-hill"
> *(lägger sit öra till Elfvehögg*): but no one must be so cruel as, by
> the slightest word, to destroy their hopes of salvation, for then the
> spritely music will be turned into weeping and laanentation. \[c\]

> The Norwegians call the Elves Huldrafolk, and their music Huldraslaat:
> it is in the minor key, and of a dull and mournful sound. The
> mountaineers sometimes play it, and pretend they have learned it by
> listening to the underground people among the hills and rocks. There
> is also a tune called the Elf-king's tune, which several of the good
> fiddlers know right well, but never venture to play, for as soon as it
> begins both old and young, and even inanimate objects, are impelled to
> dance, and the player cannot stop unless be can play the air
> backwards, or that some one comes behind him and cuts the strings of
> his fiddle. \[d\]

> The little underground Elves, who are believed to dwell under the
> houses of mankind, are described as sportive and mischievous, and as
> imitating all the actions of men. They are said to love cleanliness
> about the house and place, and to reward such servants as are neat
> and. cleanly.

> There was one time, it is said, a servant girl, who was for her
> cleanly, tidy habits, greatly beloved by the Elves, particularly as
> she was careful to carry away all dirt and foul water to a distance
> from the house, and they once invited her to a wedding. Every thing
> was conducted in the greatest order, and they made her a present of
> some chips, which she took good-homouredly and put into her pocket.
> But when the bride-pair was coming there was a straw unluckily lying
> in the way, the bridegroom got cleverly over it, but the poor bride
> fell on her face. At the sight of this the girl could not restrain
> herself, but burst out a-laughing, and that instant the whole vanished
> from her sight. Next day, to her utter amazement, she found that what
> she had taken to be nothing but chips, were so many pieces of pure
> gold. \[e\]

> A dairy-maid at a place called Skibshuset *(the Ship-house),* in
> Odense, was not so fortunate. A colony of Elves had taken up their
> abode under the floor of the cowhouse, or it is more likely, were
> there before it was made a cowhouse. However, the dirt and filth that
> the cattle made annoyed them beyond measure, and they gave the
> dairy-maid to understand that if she did not remove the cows, she
> would have reason to repent it. She gave little heed to their
> representations; and it was not very long till they set her up on top
> of the hay-rick, and killed all the cows. It is said that they were
> seen on the same night removing in a great hurry from the cowhouse
> down to the meadow, and that they went in little coaches; and their
> king was in the first coach, which was far more stately and
> magnificent than the rest. They have ever since lived in the meadow.
> \[f\]

> The Elves are extremely fond of dancing in the meadows, where they
> form those circles of a livelier green which from them are called
> Elf-dance *(Elfdans).* When the country people see in the morning
> stripes along the dewy grass in the woods and meadows, they say the
> Elves have been dancing there. If any one should at midnight get
> within their circle, they become visible to him, and they may then
> illude him. It is not every one that can see the Elves; and one person
> may see them dancing while another perceives nothing. Sunday children,
> as they are called, *i. e.* those born on Sunday, are remarkable for
> possessing this property of seeing Elves and similar beings. The
> Elves, however, have the power to bestow this gift on whomsoever they
> please. People also used to speak of Elf-books which they gave to
> those whom they loved, and which enabled them to foretell future
> events.

> The Elves often sit in little stones that are of a circular form, and
> are called Elf-mills *(Elf-qu*ä*rnor);* the sound of their voice is
> said to be sweet and soft like the air. \[g\]

> The Danish peasantry give the following account of their EllefoIk or
> Elve-people.

> The Elle-people live in the Elle-moors. The appearance of the man is
> that of an old man with a low-crowned hat on his head; the Elle-woman
> is young and of a fair and attractive countenance, but behind she is
> hollow like a dough-trough. Young men should be especially on their
> guard against her, for it is very difficult to resist her; and she
> has, moreover, a stringed instrument, which, when she plays on it,
> quite ravishes their hearts. The man may be often seen near the
> EIle-moors, bathing himself in the sunbeams, but if any one comes too
> near him, he opens his mouth wide and breathes upon them, and his
> breath produces sickness and pestilence. But the women are most
> frequently to be seen by moonshine; then they dance their rounds in
> the high grass so lightly and so gracefully, that they seldom meet a
> denial when they offer their hand to a rash young man. It is also
> necessary to watch cattle, that they may not graze in any place where
> the Elle-people have been; for if any animal come to a place where the
> Elle-people have spit, or done what is worse, it is attacked by some
> grievous disease which can only be cured by giving it to eat a handful
> of St. John's wort, which had been pulled at twelve o'clock on St.
> John's night. It might also happen that they might sustain some injury
> by mixing with the Elle-people's cattle, which are very large, and of
> a blue colour, and which may sometimes be seen in the fields licking
> up the dew, on which they live. But the farmer has an easy remedy
> against this evil; for he has only to go to the Elle-hill when he is
> turning out his cattle and to say, "Thou little Troll! may I graze my
> cows on thy hill?" And if he is not prohibited, he may set his mind at
> rest. \[h\]

> The following ballads and tales will fully justify what baa been said
> respecting the tone of melancholy connected with the subject of the
> Elves. \[i\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \[a\] That is, Wise People or Conjurors. They answer to the
> Fairy-women of Ireland.  
> \[b\] Afzelius is of opinion that this notion respecting the
> Hill-people is derived from the time of the introduction of
> Christianity into the north, and expresses the sympathy of the first
> converts with their forefathers, who had died without a knowledge of
> the Redeemer, and lay buried in heathen earth, and whose unhappy
> spirits were doomed to wander about these lower regions, or sigh
> within their mounds till the great day of redemption.  
> \[c\] "About fifteen years ago," says Odman (Bahuslän, p. 80), "people
> used to hear, out of the hill under Gärun, in the parish of Tanum, the
> playing, as it were, of the very best musicians. Any one there who had
> a fiddle, and wished to play, was taught in an instant, provided they
> promised them salvation; but whoever did not do so, might hear them
> within, in the hill, breaking their violins to pieces, sad weeping
> bitterly." See Grimm. Deut. Myth. 461.  
> \[d\] Arndt, Reise nach Schweden, iv. 241.  
> \[e\] Svenska Folk-Visor, vol. iii. p. 159. There is a similar legend
> in Germany. A servant, one time, seeing one of the little ones very
> hard-set to carry a single grain of wheat, burst out laughing at him.
> In a rage, he threw it on the ground, and it proved to be the purest
> gold. But he and his comrades quitted the house, and it speedily went
> to decay.--Strack. Beschr. v. Eilsen, p. 124, *ap.* Grimm, Introd.,
> etc., p. 90.  
> \[f\] Thiele, vol. iv. p. 22. They are called Trolls in the original.
> As they had a king, we think they must have been Elves. The Dwarfs
> have long since abolished monarchy.  
> \[g\] The greater part of what precedes has been taken from Afzelius
> in the Svenska Visor, vol. iii.  
> \[h\] Thiele, iv. 26.  
> \[i\] In the distinction which we have made between the Elves and
> Dwarfs we find that we are justified by the popular creed of the
> Norwegians--Faye, p. 49, ap. Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 412.
