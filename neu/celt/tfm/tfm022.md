THE ELLE-MAIDS

>  

> THERE lived a man in Aasum, near Odense, who, as be was coming home
> one night from Seden, passed by a hill that was standing on red
> pillars, and underneath there was dancing and great festivity. He
> hurried on past the hill as fast as he could, never venturing to cast
> his eyes that way. But as he went along, two fair maidens came to meet
> him, with beautiful hair floating over their shoulders, and one of
> them held a cup in her hand, which she reached out to him that he
> might drink of it. The other then asked him if he would come again, at
> which he laughed, and answered, Yes. But when he got home he became
> strangely affected in his mind, was never at ease in himself, and was
> continually saying that he had promised to go back. And when they
> watched him closely to prevent his doing so, he at last lost his
> senses, and died shortly after. \[a\]
