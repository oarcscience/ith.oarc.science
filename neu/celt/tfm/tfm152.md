THE FAIRY-BANQUET

>  

> A MAN one time was led by invisible musicians for several miles
> together, and not being able to resist the harmony, followed till it
> conducted him to a large common, where were a great number of little
> people sitting round a table, and eating and drinking in a very jovial
> manner. Among them were some faces whom he thought be had formerly
> seen, but forbore taking any notice, or they of him, till the little
> people offering him drink, one of them, whose features seemed not
> unknown to him, plucked him by the coat, and forbade him whatever he
> did to taste anything he saw before him, "For if you do," added be,
> "you will be as I am, and return no more to your family." The poor man
> was much affrighted, but resolved to obey the injunction. Accordingly,
> a large silver cup, filled with some sort of liquor, being put into
> his hand, he found an opportunity to throw what it contained on the
> ground. Soon after, the music ceasing, all the company disappeared,
> leaving the cup in his hand, and he returned home, though much wearied
> and fatigued. He went the next day, and communicated to the minister
> of the parish all that had happened, and asked his advice, how he
> should dispose of the cup, to which the parson replied, he could not
> do better than to devote it to the service of the church, and this
> very cup, they say, is that which is now used for the consecrated wine
> in Kirk Merlugh.
