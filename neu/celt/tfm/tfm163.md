GITTO BACH

>  

> GITTO BACH, \[a\] who was a fine boy, used often to ramble to the top
> of the mountain to look after his father's sheep. On his return, he
> would show his brothers and sisters pieces of remarkably white paper,
> like crown-pieces, with letters stamped upon them, which he said. were
> given him by the little children with whom he used to play on the
> mountain. One day he did not return, and during two whole years no
> account could be got of hint, and the other children were beginning to
> go up the mountain, and bring back some of those white crown-pieces.
> At length, one morning, as their mother opened the door, she saw Gitto
> sitting on the threshold, with a bundle under his arm. He was dressed,
> and looked exactly as when she last had seen him. To her inquiry of
> where he had been for so long a time, he replied that it was only the
> day before he had left her; and he bade her look at the pretty clothes
> the little children on the mountain had given him for dancing with
> them to the music of their harps. The dress in the bundle was of very
> white paper, without seam or sewing. The prudent mother committed it
> to the flames.

> "This," said the narrator, "made me more anxious than ever to see the
> fairies," and his wish was gratified by a gipsy, who directed him to
> find a four-leaved clover, and put it with nine grains of wheat on the
> leaf of a book which she gave him. She then desired him to meet her
> next night by moonlight on the top of Craig y Dinis. She there washed
> his eyes with the contents of a phial which she had, and be instantly
> saw thousands of fairies, all in white, dancing to the sounds of
> numerous harps. They then placed themselves on the edge of the hill,
> and sitting down and putting their hands round their knees, they
> tumbled down one after another, rolling head-over-heels till they
> disappeared in the valley.

> Another old man, who was present at the preceding narration, averred
> that he had often seen the fairies at waterfalls; particularly at that
> of Sewyd yr Rhyd in Cwm Pergwm, Vale of Neath, where a road runs
> between the fall and the rock. As he stood behind the fall, they
> appeared in all the colours of the rainbow, and their music mingled
> with the noise of the water. They then retired into a cavern, which
> they had made in the rock, and, after enjoying themselves there,
> ascended the rock, and went off through the mountains, the sounds of
> their harps dying away as they receded.
