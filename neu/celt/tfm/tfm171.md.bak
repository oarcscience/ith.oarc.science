ITALY

> Aequus alumnis.

> Horatius.

> UNFORTUNATELY for our knowledge of the ancient Italian mythology, the
> ballad-poetry of Rome is irrecoverably lost. A similar fate has
> befallen the literature of Etruria, Umbria, and other parts of the
> peninsula. The powerful influence exercised by Grecian genius over the
> conquerors of the Grecian states utterly annihilated all that was
> national and domestic in literature. Not but that Latin poetry abounds
> in mythologic matter; but it is the mythology of Greece, not of Italy;
> and the reader of Virgil and Ovid will observe with surprise how
> little of what he meets in their works is Italian.

> So much however of the population of ancient Italy, particularly of
> Latium, was Pelasgian, that it is natural to suppose a great
> similarity between the religious systems of Latium and Hellas. The
> Latins do not, however, appear to have believed in choirs of Nymphs.
> Those we read of, such as Egeria, Anna Perenna, Juturna, are all
> solitary, all dwellers of fountains, streams, and lakes The Italian
> Diana did not, like the Grecian Artemis, speed over the mountains
> attended by a train of buskined nymphs. No Dryads sought to avert the
> fate of their kindred trees--no Nereides sported on the waves.

> Dwarfish deities they had none. We are indeed told of the Lars,
> particularly the rural Lars, as answering to the Gothic Dwarfs; but no
> proofs are offered except the diminutive size of their statues. This
> we hold to amount to nothing. Are we to suppose the following lines of
> Plautus to have been delivered by an "eyas?"

> Lest any marvel who I am, I shall  
> Briefly declare it. I am the family Lar  
> Of this home whence you see me coming out.  
> 'Tis many years now that I keep and guard  
> This family; both father and grandsire  
> Of him that has it now, I aye protected.  
> Now his grandsire intrusted me a treasure  
> Of gold, that I, unknown to all, should keep it.

> \* \* \*

> He has one daughter, who, each day with wine  
> Or incense, or with something, worships me.  
> She gives me crowns, and I in recompense  
> Have now made Euclio find the treasure out,  
> That if he will, he may more readily

> Get her a match. \[a\]

> The Lars were a portion of the Etrurian religion. The Etruscan word
> Lar signifies Lord, with which it has a curious but casual
> resemblance. \[b\] The Lars were regarded, like the Grecian heroes, as
> being the souls of men who, after death, still hovered about their
> former abodes, averting dangers from, and bestowing blessings on, the
> inhabitants.

> They differed from the Penates, who were, properly speaking Gods,
> beings of a higher nature, personifications of natural powers, the
> givers of abundance and wealth.

> The old Italians, it appears, believed in a being, we know not of what
> size, called an Incubo, that watched over treasure. "But what they say
> I know not," says Petronius, \[c\] but I have heard how he snatched
> the cap of an Incubo and found a treasure."

>  

>   
> Respecting the Fairy mythology of the modern Italians, what we have
> been able to collect is very little.

> The people of Naples, we are told, \[d\] believe in a being very much
> resembling the Incubo, whom they call the Monaciello, or Little Monk.
> They describe him as a short, thick kind of little man, dressed in the
> long garments of a monk, with a broad-brimmed hat. He appears to
> people in the dead of the night, and beckons to them to follow him. If
> they have courage to do so, he leads them to some place where treasure
> is concealed. Several are said to have made sudden fortunes through
> him. In the Neapolitan story-book, named the Pentamerone, of which we
> shall presently give an account, we meet with a Monaciello of a very
> different character from this guardian of hidden treasure.

> In the second tale of the first day of that work, when the prince in
> the night heard the noise made by the Fairy in his room, "he thought
> it was some chamber-boy coming to lighten his purse for him, or some
> Monaciello to pull the clothes off him." And in the seventh tale of
> the third day of the same collection, when Corvetto had hidden himself
> under the Ogre's \[e\] bed to steal his quilt, "he began to pull quite
> gently, when the Ogre awoke, and bid his wife not to pull the clothes
> that way, or she'd strip him, and he would. get his death of cold."
> "Why, it's you that are stripping me," replied the Ogress, "and you
> have not left a stitch on me." "Where the devil is the quilt?" says
> the Ogre; and putting his hand to the ground, he happened to touch the
> face of Corvetto, and immediately began to shout out, "The Monaciello,
> the Monaciello, hola! candles! run, run!" Corvetto, meanwhile, got off
> with his prize through the window. \[f\]

> It is quite clear that the Monaciello is the same kind of being as the
> House-spirit of the Gotho-German nations. He seems to belong
> peculiarly to Naples, for we have not heard of him in any other part
> of Italy. Now we are to recollect that this was the very place in
> which the Normans settled, and so he may be their Nis or Kobold; \[g\]
> or, as he is so very like the Spanish Duende, he may be that being
> introduced by the Aragonese, who seem to have exercised so much
> influence over the language and manners of the people of Naples.

>  

>  

> The belief in Mermaids also prevailed in modern Italy. In the reign of
> Roger, king of Sicily, a young man happening to be bathing in the sea
> late in the evening, perceived that something was following him.
> Supposing it to be one of his companions, he caught it by the hair,
> and dragged it on shore. But finding it to be a maiden of great beauty
> and of most perfect form, he threw his cloak about her, and took her
> home, where she continued with him till they had a son. There was one
> thing however which greatly grieved him, which was the reflection that
> so beautiful a form should be dumb, for he had never heard her speak.
> One day he was reproached by one of his companions, who said that it
> was a spectre, and not a real woman, that he had at home: being both
> angry and terrified, he laid his hand on the hilt of his sword, and
> urged her with vehemence to tell him who or what she was, threatening
> if she did not do so, to kill the child before her eyes. The spirit
> only saying, that he had lost a good wife by forcing her to speak,
> instantly vanished, leaving her son behind. A few years after, as the
> boy was playing on the sea-shore with his companions, the spirit his
> mother dragged him into the seas where he was drowned. \[h\]

> We now come to the Fate of romance and tale.

> The earliest notice that we can recollect to have seen of these potent
> ladies is in the Orlando Innamorato, where we meet the celebrated Fata
> Morgana, who would at first appear to be, as a personification of
> Fortune, a being of a higher order.

> lvi è una fata nomata Morgana,  
> Che a le genti diverse dona l'oro;  
> Quanto e per tutto il mondo or se ne spande  
> Convien che ad essa prima si dimande.  
> L. I. c. xxv. st. 5. ed. 1831.

> But we afterwards find her in her proper station, subject, with the
> Fate and Witches, to the redoubtable Demogorgon. \[i\] When Orlando,
> on delivering Zilante from. her, makes her swear by that awful power,
> the poet says:

> Sopra ogni fata è quel Demogorgone  
> (Non so se mal l'odiste raccontare)  
> E giudica tra loro e fa ragione,  
> E quel che piace a lui puo di lor fare*.  
> *La notte si cavalca ad un montone,  
> Travarca le montague e passa il mare,  
> E *strigie*, e *fate,* e fantasime vane  
> Batte con serpi vive ogni dimane.  
> Se le ritrova Ia dimane al mondo,  
> Perchè non ponno al giorno comparire,  
> Tanto le batte al colpo furibondo  
> Che volentier vorrien poter morire.

> Or le incatena giu nel mar profondo,  
> Or sopra iI vento scalze le fa gire,  
> Or per il fuoco dietro a se le mena;  
> A cui dà questa, a cui quell' altra pena.  
> L. II. c. xiii. at. 27, 28.

> According to Ariosto, \[j\] Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in
> the Himalaya mountains, whither every fifth year the Fate are all
> summoned to appear before him, and give an account of their actions.
> They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is
> no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a Sabbat of
> the Witches.

> We meet with another Fata in Bojardo, \[k\] the beautiful Silvanella,
> who raised a tomb over Narcissus, and then dissolved away into a
> fountain.

> When Brandamarte opens the magnificent tomb and kisses the hideous
> serpent that thrusts out its head, it gradually becomes a beautiful
> maiden.

> Questa era Febosilla quella fata,  
> Che edificato avea I'alto palaccio  
> E 'l bel giardino e quella sepoltura,  
> Ove un gran tempo è stata in pena dura.  
> Perchè una fata non può morir mai,  
> Sin che non giunge il giorno del giudizio,  
> Ma ben ne Ia sua forma dura assai,  
> Mill' anni o piu, si come io aggio indizio.  
> Poi (siccome di questa io vi contai  
> Qual fabbricato avea il bell' edifizio)  
> In serpe si tramuta e stavvi tanto  
> Che di baciarla alcun si doni il vanto.  
> L. II. c. xxvi. st. 14, 15.

> The other Fate who appear in this poem are Le Fate Nera and Bianca,
> the protectresses of Guidone and Aquilante; the Fata della Fonte, from
> whom Mandricardo obtains the arms of Hector, and finally Alcina, the
> sister of Morgana, who carries off Astolfo. Dragontina and Falerina,
> the owners of such splendid gardens, may also have been Fate, though
> they are not called so by the poet.

> Alcina re-appears in great splendour in the Orlando Furioso, where she
> is given a sister named Logistilla, and both, like Morgana in the
> preceding poem, are in a great measure allegorical. We also obtain
> there a glimpse of the White and Black Fate. The Maga Manto of Dante
> becomes here a Fata, and we meet her in the form of a serpent; to
> account for which she says,

> Nascemmo ad un punto che d' ogni altro male  
> Siamo capaci fuor che della morte.  
> Ma giunta è con questo essere immortale  
> Condizion non men del morir forte;  
> Ch' ogni settimo giorno ognuna è certa  
> Che la ma forma in biscia si converta.  
> C. xliii. st. 98.

> Elsewhere (x. 52) the poet tells us that

> Morir non puote alcuna fata mai  
> Fin che il Sol gira, o il ciel non muta stilo.

> In the Amadigi of Bernardo Tasso the Fate appear for the last time in
> Italian poetry; \[l\] but in greater number, and, we may say, greater
> splendour than elsewhere. There are two classes of them, the
> beneficent and protective, and the seductive and injurious. The terms
> Maga and Incantatrice, as well as Fata, are applied to them all
> indifferently. The good Fairy-ladies are Urganda, termed *La savia*
> and *La sconosciuta,* **\[m\]** the guardian of Amadigi, and the fair
> Oriana; Silvana or Silvanella who stands in a similar relation to
> Alidoro; Lucina, also named La Donna del Lago, another protectress of
> Alidoro and of his lady-love, the fair warrior Mirinda, sister of
> Amadigi; Eufrosina, the sister of Lucina; Argea, called La Reina della
> Fate, the protectress of Floridante, to whom, after making him undergo
> various trials, she gives her daughter Filidora in marriage; finally,
> Argea's sister Filidea. The Fate whose character resembles that of
> Alcina are Morganetta, Nivetta, and Carvilia, the three daughters of
> Morgana. Beside these then are two Fate of neutral character,
> Dragontina, who formed a palace, temple and gardens, in which, at the
> desire of her father, she enchanted a young prince and his wife; and
> Montana, who, to avenge the fate of her lover, slain by Alidoro,
> enchanted that warrior in a temple which she had raised to the memory
> of the fallen. \[n\]

> Ma veggiam ch' io non stessi troppo a bada  
> Con queste Alcine e Morgane.

> The earliest collections of European Fairy-tales in prose belong to
> Italy. In 1550, Straparola, a native of Caravaggio, in the Milanese,
> published at Venice his Notti Piacevoli, a collection of tales, jokes,
> and riddles, of which several, and those the best, are Fairy-tales.
> These were translated into French in 1560--76, and seem to have been
> the origin of the so well known Contes des Feés. Perrault's Puss in
> Boots *(Le Chat Botté,)* and the Princess Fairstar *(Belle Etoile,)*
> and many others of Madame D'Aulnoy's, who borrowed largely from the
> Notti Piacevoli, are to be found in Straparola. In 1637, eighty-seven
> years after the Notti Piacevoli appeared at Naples, and in the
> Neapolitan dialect, the Péntamerone, the best collection of
> Fairy-tales ever written. \[o\] The author, Giambattista Basile, \[p\]
> had spent his youth in Candia, and then passed several years rambling
> through Italy. He seems to have carefully treasured up all the tales
> he heard, and he wrote and published them, under the feigned name of
> Gian Alesio Abbatutis, in his native dialect, not long before his
> death.

> In the Tales and Popular Fictions we gave some translations from the
> Notti Piacevoli, the only ones in English, and they will probably
> remain such, as the work is not one likely ever to be translated. In
> the same work we gave two from the Pentamerone, and. three (the
> Dragon, Gagliuso, and the Goatface) in the former edition of the
> present work. Most certainly we were the first to render any of these
> curious tales into English, and we look back with a mixture of
> pleasure and surprise at our success in the unaided struggle with an
> idiom so different from the classic Italian. \[q\] We fancied that we
> had been the first to make translations from it into any language, but
> we afterwards learned that of the two tales in our other work, the
> one, Peruonto, had been translated into French (probably by the Abbé
> Galiani) for the Cabinet des Feés, the other, the Serpent into German,
> by M. Grimm. \[r\] Of late, this most original work has been brought
> within the reach of ordinary readers by two translations, the one in
> German by Felix Liebrecht, who has given the work complete with few
> omissions; the other in English by Mr. J. E. Taylor, who has made a
> selection of thirty tales, and these most carefully expurgated, in
> order that agreeably to its second title, it might form a book of
> amusement even for children--a most difficult task, and in which his
> success has been far greater than might have been anticipated. All our
> own translations have been incorporated in it, and we can safely refer
> to it those who wish to know the real character and nature of the
> Pentamerone.

> Whatever name Basile might give his book it is quite plain that he
> never could have meant it merely for children. The language alone is
> proof enough on that head. It is, besides, full of learned allusions
> and of keen satire, so that it could only be understood and relished
> by grown persons, for whose amusement it was apparently designed; and
> its tales are surely not much more extravagant than some of those in
> Ariosto and the other romantic poets. It in fact never was a child's
> book like the Contes de ma Mère l' Oie. It has now become very scarce;
> we could not at Naples meet with a copy of it, or even with any one
> who had read it.
