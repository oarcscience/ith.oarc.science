FAIRY LAND

>  

> There, renewed the vital spring,  
> Again he reigns a mighty king  
> And many a fair and fragrant clime,  
> Blooming in immortal prime,  
> By gales of Eden ever fanned,  
> Owns the monarch's high command.

> T. Warton.

>   
> AMONG all nations the mixture of joy and pain, of exquisite delight
> and intense misery in the present state, has led the imagination to
> the conception of regions of unmixed bliss destined for the repose of
> the good after the toils of this life, and of climes where happiness
> prevails, the abode of beings superior to man. The imagination of the
> Hindoo paints his Swergas as 'profuse of bliss,' and all the joys of
> sense are collected into the Paradise of the Mussulman. The Persian
> lavished the riches of his fancy in raising the Cities of Jewels and
> of Amber that adorn the realms of Jinnestân; the romancer erected
> castles and palaces filled with knights and ladies in Avalon and in
> the land of Faerie; while the Hellenic bards, unused to pomp and
> glare, filled the Elysian Fields and the Island of the Blest with
> tepid gales and brilliant flowers. We shall quote without apology two
> beautiful passages from Homer and Pindar, that our readers may at one
> view satisfy themselves of the essential difference between classic
> and romantic imagination. In Homer, Proteus tells Menelaus that,
> because he had had the honour of being the son-in-law of Zeus, he
> should not die in "horse-feeding Argos."

> But thee the ever-living gods will send  
> Unto the Elysian plain and distant bounds  
> Of Earth, where dwelleth fair-hair'd Rhadamanthus.  
> There life is easiest unto men; no snow,  
> Or wintry storm, or rain, at any time,  
> Is there; but evermore the Ocean sends  
> Soft-breathing airs of Zephyr to refresh  
> The habitants--*Od*. iv. 563.

> This passage is finely imitated by Pindar, and connected with that
> noble tone of pensive morality, so akin to the Oriental spirit, and by
> which the 'Dircaean Swan' is distinguished from all his fellows.

> They speed their *way  
> *To Kronos' palace, where around  
> The Island of the Blest, the airs  
> Of Ocean breathe, and golden flowers  
> Blaze; some on land  
> From shining trees, and other kinds  
> The water feeds. Of these  
> Garlands and bracelets round their arms they bind,  
> Beneath the righteous sway  
> Of Rhadamanthus.--*Ol.* ii. 126.

> Lucretius has transferred these fortunate fields to the superior
> regions, to form the abode of his *fainéans,* gods; and Virgil has
> placed them, with additional poetic splendour, in the bosom of the
> earth.

> Widely different from these calm and peaceful abodes of parted
> warriors are the Faeries of the minstrels and romancers. In their
> eyes, and in those of their auditors, nothing was beautiful or good
> divested of the pomp and pride of chivalry; and chivalry has,
> accordingly, entered deeply into the composition of their pictures of
> these ideal realms.

> The Feeries of romance may be divided into three kinds Avalon, placed
> in the ocean, like the Island of the Blest; those that, like the
> palace of Pan Banou, are within the earth; and, lastly, those that,
> like Oberon's domains, are situate 'in wilderness among the holtis
> hairy.'

> Of the castle and isle of Avalon, \[a\] the abode of Arthur and
> Oberon, and Morgue lit faye, the fullest description is to be seen in
> the romance of Ogier le Danois, from which, as we know no sure quarter
> but the work itself to refer to for the part connected with the
> present subject, we will make some extracts. \[b\]

> At the birth of Ogier several Fairies attended, who bestowed on him
> various gifts. Among them was Morgue la Faye, who gave him that he
> should be her lover and friend. Accordingly, when Ogier had long
> distinguished himself in love and war, and had. attained his hundredth
> year, the affectionate Morgue thought it was time to withdraw him from
> the toils and dangers of mortal life, and transport him to the joys
> and the repose of the castle of Avalon. In pursuance of this design,
> Ogier and king Caraheu are attacked by a storm on their return from
> Jerusalem, and their vessels separated. The bark on which Ogier was
> "floated along the sea till it came near the castle of loadstone,
> which is called the castle of Avalon, which is not far on this side of
> the terrestrial paradise, whither were rapt in a flame of fire Enock
> and Helias; and where was Morgue la Faye, who at his birth had endowed
> him with great gifts, noble and virtuous." \[c\]

> The vessel is wrecked against the rock; the provisions are divided
> among the crew, and it is agreed that every man, as his stock failed,
> should be thrown into the sea. Ogier's stock holds out longest, and he
> remains alone. He is nearly reduced to despair, when a voice from
> heaven cries to him:

> "God commandeth thee that, as soon as it is night, thou go unto a
> castle that thou wilt see shining, and pass from bark to bark till
> thou be in an isle which thou wilt find. And when thou wilt be in that
> isle thou wilt find a little path, and of what thou mayest see within
> be not dismayed at anything. And then Ogier looked, but he saw
> nothing." \[d\]

> When night came, Ogier recommended himself to God, and seeing the
> castle of loadstone all resplendent with light, he went from one to
> the other of the vessels that were wrecked there, and so got into the
> island where it was. On arriving at the gate he found it guarded by
> two fierce lions. He slew them and entered; and making his way into a
> hall found a horse sitting at a table richly supplied. The courteous
> animal treats him with the utmost respect, and the starving hero makes
> a hearty supper. The horse then prevails on him to get on his back,
> and carries him into a splendid chamber, where Ogier sleeps that
> night. The name of this horse is Papillon, "who was a Luiton, and had
> been a great prince, but king Arthur conquered him, so he was
> condemned to be three hundred years a horse without speaking one
> single word, but after the three hundred years he was to have the
> crown of joy which they wore in Faerie." \[e\]

> Next morning he cannot find Papillon, but on opening a door he meets a
> huge serpent, whom he also slays, and follows a little path which
> leads him into an orchard "tant bel et tant plaisant, que cestoit ung
> petit paradis a veoir." He plucks an apple from one of the trees and
> eats it, but is immediately affected by such violent sickness as to be
> put in fear of speedy death. He prepares himself for his fate,
> regretting "le bon pays de France, le roi Charlemaigne... et
> principallement la bonne royne dangleterre, sa bonne espouse et vraie
> amie, ma dame Clarice, qui tant estoit belle et noble." While in this
> dolorous state, happening to turn to the east, he perceived "une moult
> belle dame, toute vestue de blanc, si bien et si richement aornee que
> cestoit ung grant triumphe que de la veoir."

> Ogier, thinking it is the Virgin Mary, commences an Ave; but the lady
> tells him she is Morgue la Faye, who at his birth had kissed him, and
> retained him for her loyal amoureux, though forgotten by him. She
> places then on his finger a ring, which removes all infirmity, and
> Ogier, a hundred years old, returns to the vigour and beauty of
> thirty. She now leads him to the castle of Avalon, where were her
> brother king Arthur, and Auberon, and Mallonbron, "ung luiton de mer."

> "And when Morgue drew near to the said castle of Avalon, the Fays came
> to meet Ogier, singing the most melodiously that ever could be heard,
> so he entered into the hail to solace himself completely. There he saw
> several Fay ladies adorned and all crowned with crowns most
> sumptuously made, and very rich, and evermore they sung, danced, and
> led a right joyous life, without thinking of any evil thing whatever,
> but of taking their mundane pleasures." \[f\] Morgue here introduces
> the knight to Arthur, and she places on his head a crown rich and
> splendid beyond estimation, but which has the Lethean quality, that
> whoso wears it,

> Forthwith his former state end being forgets,  
> Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain;

> for Ogier instantly forgot country and friends. He had no thought
> whatever " ni de la dame Clarice, qui tant estoit belle et noble," nor
> of Guyon his brother, nor of his nephew Gauthier, "ne de creature
> vivante." His days now rolled on in never-ceasing pleasure. "Such
> joyous pastime did the Fay ladies make for him, that there is no
> creature in this world who could imagine or think it, for to hear them
> sing so sweetly it seemed to him actually that he was in Paradise; so
> the time passed from day to day, from week to week, in such sort that
> a year did not last a month to him." \[g\]

> But Avalon was still on earth, and therefore its bliss was not
> unmixed. One day Arthur took Ogier aside, and informed him that
> Capalus, king of the Luitons, incessantly attacked the castle of
> Faerie with design to eject king Arthur from its dominion, and was
> accustomed to penetrate to the basse court, calling on Arthur to come
> out and engage him. Ogier asked permission to encounter this
> formidable personage, which Arthur willingly granted. No sooner,
> however, did Capalus see Ogier than he surrendered to him; and the
> knight had the satisfaction of leading him into the castle, and
> reconciling him to its inhabitants.

> Two hundred years passed away in these delights, and seemed to Ogier
> but twenty: Charlemagne and all his lineage had failed, and even the
> race of Ogier was extinct, when the Paynims invaded France and Italy
> in vast numbers; and Morgue no longer thought herself justified in
> withholding Ogier from the defence of the faith. Accordingly, she one
> day took the Lethean crown from off his head: immediately all his old
> ideas rushed on his mind, and inflamed him with an ardent desire to
> revisit his country. The Fairy gave him a brand which was to be
> preserved from burning, for so long as it was unconsumed, so long
> should his life extend. She adds to her gift the horse Papillon and
> his comrade Benoist. "And when they were both mounted, all the ladies
> of the castle came to take, leave of Ogier, by the command of king
> Arthur and of Morgue la Faye, and they sounded an aubade of
> instruments, the most melodious thing to hear that ever was listened
> to; then, when the aubade was finished, they sung with the voice so
> melodiously, that it was a thing so melodious that it seemed actually
> to Ogier that he was in Paradise. Again, when that was over, they sung
> with the instruments in such sweet concordance that it seemed rather
> to be a thing divine than mortal." \[h\] The knight then took leave of
> all, and a cloud, enveloping him and his companion, raised them, and
> set them down by a fair fountain near Montpellier. Ogier displays his
> ancient prowess, routs the infidels, and on the death of the king is
> on the point of espousing the queen, when Morgue appears and takes him
> back to Avalon. Since then Ogier has never reappeared in this world.

> Nowhere is a Faerie of the second kind so fully and circumstantially
> described as in the beautiful romance of Orfeo and Heurodis. There
> are, indeed, copious extracts from this poem in Sir Walter Scott's
> Essay on the Fairies of Popular Superstition; and we have no excuse to
> offer for repeating what is to be found in a work so universally
> diffused as the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, but that it is of
> absolute necessity for our purpose, and that romantic poetry is rarely
> unwelcome.

> Orfeo and Heurodis were king and queen of Winchester. The queen
> happening one day to sleep under an ymp \[i\] tree in the palace
> orchard, surrounded by her attendants, had a dream, which she thus
> relates to the king:

> As I lay this undertide *(afternoon)  
> *To sleep under the orchard-side,  
> There came to me two faire knightes  
> Well arrayed allè rightes,  
> And bade me come without letting

> And I answér'd with wordès bolde

> All so soon he to me came,  
> Wold I, nold I he me name *(took),  
> *And made me with him ride

> He showed me castels and toures,  
> Meadows, rivers, fields and flowres,  
> And his forests everiche ones  
> And sith he brought me again home.

> an elf-queen, and awakes, declaring

> An elf-queen wol I love, ywis.

> All other women I forsake,  
> And to an elf-queen I me take  
> By dale and eke by down.

> He determines to set out in quest of her.

> Into his sadel he clombe anon,  
> And pricked over style and stone,  
> An elf-quene for to espie;  
> Till be so long had ridden and gone,  
> That he found in a privee wone  
> The countree of Faerie, \[m\]

> Wherein he soughtè north and south,  
> And oft he spied with his mouth  
> In many a forest wilde;  
> For in that countree n'as there none

> Neither wif ne childe.

> The "gret giaunt" Sire Oliphaunt, however, informs him that

> Here is the quene of Faerie,  
> With harpe and pipe and simphonie,  
> Dwelling in this place.

> Owing to the fastidiousness of "mine hoste," we are unable to learn

> From the glimmering of the morning star of English poetry, the

> Ellzabeth, and we will now make a few remarks on the poem of Spenser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \[a\] Avalon was perhaps the Island of the Blest, of Celtic mythology,
> and then the abode of the Fees, through the Breton Korrigan. Writers,
> however, seem to be unanimous in regarding it and Glastonbury as the
> same place, called an isle, it is stated, as being made nearly such by
> the "river's embracement." It was named Avalon, we are told, from the
> British word *Aval,* an apple, as it abounded with orchards and *Ynys*
> *gwydrin;* Saxon Glaytn-ey, glassy isle; Latin, Glastonia, from the
> green hue of the water surrounding it.

> \[c\] Tant nagea en mer qu'il arriva pres du chastel daymant quon
