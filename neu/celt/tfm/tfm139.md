THE YOUNG MAN IN THE SHIAN

>  

> A FARMER named Macgillivray, one time removed from the neighbourhood
> of Cairngorm in Strathspey to the forest of Glenavon, in which the
> fairies are said to reside. Late one night, as two of his sons, Donald
> and Bory, were in search of some of his sheep that had strayed, they
> saw lights streaming from the crevices of a fairy turret which in the
> day time had only the appearance of a rock. They drew nigh to it, and
> there they heard jigs and reels played inside in the most exquisite
> manner. Rory was so fascinated that he proposed that they should enter
> and take part in the dance. Donald did all he could to dissuade him,
> but in vain. He jumped into the Shian, and plunged at once into the
> whirling movements of its inhabitants. Donald was in great perplexity,
> for he feared to enter the Shian. All he could do therefore was to put
> his mouth to one of the crevices, and calling, as the custom was,
> three times on his brother, entreating him in the most moving terms,
> to come away and return home. But his entreaties were unheeded and he
> was obliged to return alone.

> Every means now was resorted to for the recovery of Rory, but to no
> purpose. His family gave him up for lost, when a *Duin Glichd* or Wise
> man, told Donald to go to the place where he had lost his brother, a
> year and a day from the time, and placing in his garments a
> rowan-cross, to enter the Shian boldly, and claim him in the divine
> name, and if he would not come voluntarily, to seize him and drag hine
> out; for the fairies would have no power to prevent him. After some
> hesitation Donald assented. At the appointed time he approached the
> Shian at midnight. It was full of revelry, and the merry dance was
> going on as before. Donald had his terrors no doubt, but they gave way
> to his fraternal affection. He entered and found Rory in the midst of
> a Highland Fling, and running up, to him, seized him by the collar,
> repeating the words dictated by the Wise man. Rory agreed to go
> provided he would let him finish his dance; for he had not been, he
> assured him, more than half an hour in the place, but Donald was
> inexorable, and took him home to his parents. Rory would never have
> believed that his half-hour had been a twelvemonth, "did not the
> calves grown now into stots, and the new-born babes now toddling about
> the house, at length convince him that in his single reel he had
> danced for a twelvemonth and a day."
