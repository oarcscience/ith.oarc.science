THE CHAMOIS HUNTER

>  

> A CHAMOIS-RUNTER set out early one morning, and ascended the
> mountains. He had arrived at a great height, and was in view of some
> chamois, when, just as he was laying his bolt on his crossbow, and was
> about to shoot, a terrible cry from a cleft of the rock interrupted
> his purpose. Turning round he saw a hideous Dwarf, with a battle-axe
> in his hand raised to slay him. "Why," cried he, in a rage, "hast thou
> so long been destroying my chamois, and leavest not with me my flock?
> But now thou shalt pay for it with thy blood.' The poor hunter
> turned  
> pale at the stranger's words. In his terror he was near falling from
> the cliff.

> At length, however, he recovered himself; and begged forgiveness of
> the Dwarf; pleaded his ignorance that the chamois belonged to him,
> declaring at the same time that he had no other means of support than
> what he derived from hunting. The Dwarf was pacified, laid down his
> axe, and said to him, "Tis well; never be seen here again, and I
> promise thee that every seventh day thou shalt find, early in the
> morning, a dead chamois hanging before thy cottage; but beware and
> keep from the others." The Dwarf then vanished, and the hunter
> returned thoughtfully home, little pleased with the prospect of the
> inactive live be was now to lead.

> On the seventh morning he found, according to the Dwarf's promise, a
> fat chamois hanging in the branches of a tree before his cottage, of
> which he ate with great satisfaction. The next week it was the same,
> and so it continued for some months. But at last he grew weary of this
> idle life, and preferred, come what might, returning to the chase, and
> catching chamois for himself; to having his food provided for him
> without the remembrance of his toils to sweeten the repast. His
> determination made, he once more ascended the mountains. Almost the
> first object that met his view was a fine buck. The hunter levelled
> his bow and took aim at the prey; and as the Dwarf did not appear, he
> was just pulling the trigger, when the Dwarf stole behind him, took
> him by the ankle, and tumbled him down the precipice.

> Others say the Dwarf gave the hunter a small cheese of chamois-milk,
> which would last him his whole life, but that he one day thoughtlessly
> ate the whole of it, or, as some will have it, a guest who was
> ignorant of the quality of it ate up the remainder. Poverty then drove
> him to return to the chamois-hunting, and he was thrown into a chasm
> by the Dwarf. \[a\]

> rich, says Mr. Wyss, in Dwarf lore, and who accompanied him to
> Lauterbrunnen. Schiller has founded his poem Der Alpenjäger on this
> legend.
