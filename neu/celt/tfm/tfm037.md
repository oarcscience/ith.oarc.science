THE TROLL TURNED CAT

>  

> ABOUT a quarter of a mile from Soröe lies Pedersborg, and a little
> farther on is the town of Lyng. Just between these towns is a hill
> called Bröndhöi *(Spring-hill),* said to be inhabited by the
> Troll-people.

> There goes a story that there was once among these Troll. people of
> Bröndhöi an old crossgrained curmudgeon of a Troll, whom the rest
> nick-named Knurremurre *(Rumble-grumble),* because he was evermore the
> cause of noise and uproar within the hill. This Knurremurre having
> discovered what he thought to be too great a degree of intimacy
> between his young wife and a young Troll of the society, took this in
> such ill part, that he vowed vengeance, swearing he would have the
> life of the young one. The latter, accordingly, thought it would be
> his best course to be off out of the hill till better times; so,
> turning himself into a noble tortoise. shell tom-cat, he one fine
> morning quitted his old residence, and journeyed down to the
> neighbouring town of Lyng, where he established himself in the house
> of an honest poor man named Plat.

> Here he lived for a long time comfortable and easy, with nothing to
> annoy him, and was as happy as any tom-cat or Troll crossed in love
> well could be. He got every day plenty of milk and good groute \[a\]
> to eat, and lay the whole day long at his ease in a warm arm-chair
> behind the stove.

> Plat happened one evening to come home rather late, and as he entered
> the room the cat was sitting in his usual place, scraping meal-groute
> out of a pot, and licking the pot itself carefully. "Harkye, dame,"
> said Plat, as he came in at the door, "till I tell you what happened
> to me on the road. Just as I was coming past Bröndhöi, there came out
> a Troll, and he called out to me, and said,

> "Harkye Plat,  
> Tell your cat,  
> That Knurremurre is dead." \[b\]

> The moment the cat heard these words, he tumbled the pot down on the
> floor, sprang out of the chair, and stood up on his hind-legs. Then,
> as he hurried out of the door, he cried out with exultation, "What! is
> Knurremurre dead? Then I may go home as fast as I please." And so
> saying he scampered off to the hill, to the amazement of honest Plat;
> and it is likely lost no time in making his advances to the young
> widow. \[c\]
