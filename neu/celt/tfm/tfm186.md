JEWS

>  

> And the Mazikeen shall not come near thy tents.

> IT has long been an established article of belief among the Jews that
> there is a species of beings which they call Shedeem, Shehireem, or
> Mazikeen. These beings exactly correspond to the Arabian Jinn; and the
> Jews hold that it is by means of them that all acts of magic and
> enchantment are performed.

> The Talmud says that the Shedeem were the offspring of Adam. After he
> had eaten of the Tree of life, Adam was excommunicated for one hundred
> and thirty years. "In all those years," saith Rabbi Jeremiah Ben
> E'liezar, "during which Adam was under excommunication, he begat
> spirits, demons, and spectres of the night, as it is written, 'Adam
> lived one hundred and thirty years, and begat children in his likeness
> and in his image,' which teaches, that till that time he bad not
> begotten them in his own likeness." In Berasbith Rabba, R. Simon says,
> "During all the one hundred and thirty years that Adam was separate
> from Eve, male spirits lay with her, and she bare by them, and female
> spirits lay with Adam, and bare by him."

> These Shedeem or Mazikeen are held to resemble the angels in three
> things. They can see and not be seen; they have wings and can fly;
> they know the future. In three respects they resemble mankind: they
> eat and drink; they marry and have children; they are subject to
> death. it may be added, they have the power of assuming any form they
> please; and so the agreement between them and the Jinn of the Arabs is
> complete.

> Moses Edrehi, a learned Jew of Morocco, has translated into Spanish
> for us several of the tales of the Mazikeen contained in the Talmud
> and Rabbinical writings. We select the following as specimens; and
> according to our usual custom, adhere strictly to our original.
