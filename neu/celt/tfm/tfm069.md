THE LOST BELL

>  

> A SHEPHERD'S boy belonging to Patzig, about half a mile from Bergen,
> where there are great numbers of the underground people in the hills,
> found one morning a little silver bell on the green heath, among the
> Giants'-graves, and fastened it on him. It happened to be the bell
> belonging to the cap of one of the little Brown ones, who had lost it
> while he was dancing, and did not immediately miss it, or observe that
> it was no longer tinkling in his cap. He had gone down into the hill
> without his bell, and having discovered his loss, was filled with
> melancholy. For the worst thing that can befall the underground people
> is to lose their cap, then their shoes; but even to lose the bell from
> their caps, or the buckle from their belts, is no trifle to them.
> Whoever loses his bell must pass some sleepless nights, for not a wink
> of sleep can he get till he has recovered it.

> The little fellow was in the greatest trouble, and searched and looked
> about everywhere; but how could he learn who had the bell? For only on
> a very few days in the year may they come up to the daylight; nor can
> they then appear in their true form. He had turned himself into every
> form of birds, beasts, and men; and he had sung and rung, and groaned
> and moaned, and lamented and inquired about his bell, but not the
> slightest tidings, or trace of tidings, had he been able to get. For
> what was worst of all, the shepherd's boy had left Patzig the very day
> he found the little bell, and was now keeping sheep at Unruh, near
> Gingst: so it was not till many a day after, and then by mere chance,
> that the little underground fellow recovered his bell, and with it his
> peace of mind.

> He had thought it not unlikely that a raven, or a crow, or a jackdaw,
> or a magpie, had found his bell, and from his thievish disposition,
> which is caught with anything bright and shining, had carried it into
> his nest; with this thought he had turned himself into a beautiful
> little bird, and searched all the nests in the island, and had sung
> before all kinds of birds, to see if they had found what he had lost,
> and could restore him his sleep; but nothing had he been able to learn
> from the birds. As he now, one evening, was flying over the waters of
> Baby and the fields of Unruh, the shepherd's boy, whose name was Fritz
> Schlagenteufel *(Smite-devil*), happened to be keeping his sheep there
> at the very time. Several of the sheep had bells about their necks,
> and they tinkled merrily, when the boy's dog set them trotting. The
> little bird, who was flying over them thought of his bell, and sung,
> in a melancholy tone,

> Little bell, little bell,  
> Little ram as well,  
> You, too, little sheep,  
> If you've my Tingletoo,  
> No sheep's so rich as you,  
> My rest you keep.

> The boy looked up and listened to this strange song which came out of
> the sky, and saw the pretty bird, which seemed to him still more
> strange:--"Odds bodikins!" said he to himself, "if one but had that
> bird that's singing up there, so plain that one of us would hardly
> match him! What can he mean by that wonderful song? The whole of it
> is, it must be a feathered witch. My rams have only pinchbeck bells,
> he calls them rich cattle; but I have a silver bell, and he sings
> nothing about me." And with these words he began to fumble in his
> pocket, took out his bell, and rang it.

> The bird in the air instantly saw what it was, and was rejoiced beyond
> measure. He vanished in a second--flew behind the nearest
> bush--alighted and drew off his speckled feather-dress, and turned
> himself into an old woman dressed in tattered clothes. The old dame,
> well supplied with sighs and groans, tottered across the field to the
> shepherd's boy, who was still ringing his bell, and wondering what was
> become of the beautiful bird. She cleared her throat, and coughing up
> from the bottom of her chest, bid him a kind good evening, and asked
> him which was the way to Bergen. Pretending then that she had just
> seen the little bell, she exclaimed, "Good Lord! what a charming
> pretty little bell! Well! in all my life I never beheld anything more
> beautiful! Harkye, my son, will you sell me that bell? And what may be
> the price of it? I have a little grandson at home, and such a nice
> plaything as it would make for him!" "No," replied the boy, quite
> short, "the bell is not for sale. It is a bell, that there is not such
> another bell in the whole world. I have only to give it a little
> tinkle, and my sheep run of themselves wherever I would have them go.
> And what a delightful sound it has! Only listen, mother!" said he,
> ringing it: "is there any weariness in the world that can hold out
> against this bell? I can ring with it away the longest time, so that
> it will be gone in a second."

> The old woman thought to herself, "We will see if he can hold out
> against bright shining money." And she took out no less than three
> silver dollars, and offered them to him: but he still replied, "No, I
> will not sell my bell." She then offered him five dollars. "The bell
> is still mine," said he. She stretched out her hand full of ducats: he
> replied, this third time, "Gold is dirt and does not ring." The old
> dame then shifted her ground, and turned the discourse another way.
> She grew mysterious, and began to entice him by talking of secret
> arts, and of charms by which his cattle might be made to thrive
> prodigiously, relating to him all kinds of wonders of them. It was
> then the young shepherd began to long, and he now lent a willing ear
> to her tales.

> The end of the matter was, that she said to him, "Harkye, my child!
> give me the bell and see! here is a white stick for you," said she,
> taking out a little white stick which had Adam and Eve very
> ingeniously cut on it, as they were feeding the herds of Paradise,
> with the fattest sheep and lambs dancing before them; and there was
> the shepherd David too, as he stood with his sling against the giant
> Goliath. "I will give you," said the old woman, "this stick for the
> bell, and as long as you drive the cattle with it they will be sure to
> thrive. With this you will become a rich shepherd: your wethers will
> always be fat a month sooner than the wethers of other shepherds, and
> every one of your sheep will have two pounds of wool more than others,
> and yet no one will be ever able to see it on them."

> The old woman handed him the stick. So mysterious was her gesture, and
> so strange and bewitching her smile, that the lad was at once in her
> power. He grasped eagerly at the stick, gave her his hand, and cried,
> "Done! Strike hands! The bell for the stick!" And cheerfully the old
> woman struck hands, and took the bell, and went like a light breeze
> over the field and the heath. He saw her vanish, and she seemed to
> float away before his eyes like a mist, and to go off with a slight
> whiz and whistle that made the shepherd's hair stand on end.

> The underground one, however, who, in the shape of an old woman, had
> wheedled him out of his bell, had not deceived him. For the under
> groundpeople dare not lie, but must ever keep their word; a breach of
> it being followed by their sudden change into the shape of toads,
> snakes, dunghill-beetles, wolves and apes; forms in which they wander
> about, objects of fear and aversion for a long course of years before
> they are freed. They, therefore, have naturally a great dread of
> lying. Fritz Schlagenteufel gave close attention and made trial of his
> new shepherd's-staff and he soon found that the old woman had told him
> the truth, for his flocks, and his work, and all the labour of his
> hands prospered with him and had wonderful luck, so that there was not
> a sheep-owner or head shepherd but was desirous of having Fritz
> Schlagenteufel in his employment.

> It was not long, however, that he remained an underling. Before he was
> eighteen years of age, he had gotten his own flocks, and in the course
> of a few years was the richest sheep-master in the whole island of
> Rügen; until at last, he was able to purchase a knight's estate for
> himself, and that estate was Grabitz, close by Rambin, which now
> belongs to the lords of Sunde. My father \[a\] knew him there, and how
> from a shepherd's boy he was become a nobleman, and, he always
> conducted himself like a prudent, honest and pious man, who had a good
> word from every one. He brought up his sons like gentlemen, and his
> daughters like ladies, some of whom are still alive and accounted
> people of great consequence. And well may people who hear such stories
> wish that they had met with such an adventure, and had found a little
> silver bell which the underground people had lost.
