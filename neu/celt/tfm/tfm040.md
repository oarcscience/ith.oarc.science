THE HILL SMITH

>  

> BIORN MARTINSSON went out shooting, one day, with a gamekeeper, on the
> wooded hill of Ormkulla. They there found a hill-smith *(bergsmed)*
> lying fast asleep. Biörn directed the gamekeeper to secure him, but he
> refused, saying "Pray to God to protect you! The hill-smith will fling
> you down to the bottom of the hill." He was, however, bold and,
> determined, and he went up and seized the sleeping hill-smith, who
> gave a cry, and implored him to let him go, as he had a wife and seven
> little children. He said he would also do any iron work that should be
> required; it would only be necessary to leave iron and steel on the
> side of the hill, and the work would be found lying finished in the
> same place. Biörn asked him for whom he worked; he replied, "For my
> companions." When Biörn would not let him go, he said, "If I had my
> mist-cap *(uddehat)* you should not carry me away. But if you do not
> let me go, not one of your posterity will attain to the importance
> which you possess, but continually decline;" which certainly came to
> pass. Biörn would not, however, let him go, but brought him captive to
> Bahus. On the third day, however, he effected his escape out of the
> place in which he was confined. \[a\]

> The following legend is related in Denmark:--

> On the lands of Nyegaard lie three large hills, one of which is the
> abode of a Troll, who is by trade a blacksmith. If any one is passing
> that hill by night, he will see the fire issuing from the top, and
> going in again at the side. Should you wish to have any piece of
> iron-work executed in a masterly manner, you have only to go to the
> hill, and saying aloud what you want to have made, leave there the
> iron and a silver shilling. On revisiting the hill next morning, you
> will find the shilling gone, and the required piece of work lying
> there finished, and ready for use. \[b\]

> tells of a man who, as he was going along one day with his dog, came
> on a hill-smith at his work, using a stone as an anvil. He had on him
> a light grey coat and a black woollen hat. The dog began to bark at
> him, but he put on so menacing an attitude that they both deemed it
> advisable to go away.
