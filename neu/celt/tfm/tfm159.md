TALE OF ELIDURUS

>  

> A SHORT time before our days, a circumstance worthy of note occurred
> in these parts, which Elidurus, a priest, most strenuously affirmed
> had befallen himself. When he was a youth of twelve years,--since, as
> Solomon says, "The root of learning is bitter, although the fruit is
> sweet,"--and was following his literary pursuits, in order to avoid
> the discipline and frequent stripes inflicted on him by his preceptor,
> he ran away, and concealed himself under the hollow bank of a river;
> and, after fasting in that situation for two days, two little men of
> pygmy stature appeared to him, saying, "If you will come with us, we
> will lead you into a country full of delights and sports." Assenting,
> and rising up, he followed his guides through a path, at first
> subterraneous and dark, into a most beautiful country, adorned with
> rivers and meadows, woods and plains, but obscure, and not illuminated
> with the full light of the sun. All the days were cloudy, and the
> nights extremely dark, on account of the absence of the moon and
> stars. The boy was brought before the king, and introduced to him in
> the presence of the court; when, having examined him for a long time,
> he delivered him to his son, who was then a boy. These men were of the
> smallest stature, but very well proportioned for their size. They were
> all fair-haired, with luxuriant hair falling over their shoulders,
> like that of women. They had horses proportioned to themselves, of the
> size of greyhounds. They neither ate flesh nor fish, but lived on milk
> diet, made up into messes with saffron. They never took an oath, for
> they detested nothing so much as lies. As often as they returned from
> our upper hemisphere, they reprobated our ambition, infidelities, and
> inconstancies. They had no religious worship, being only, as it seems,
> strict lovers and reverers of truth.

> The boy frequently returned to our hemisphere, sometimes by the way he
> had first gone, sometimes by another; at first in company with others,
> and afterwards alone, and confided his secret only to his mother,
> declaring to her the manners, nature, and state of that people. Being
> desired by her to bring a present of gold, with which that region
> abounded, he stole, while at play with the king's son, the golden ball
> with which he used to divert himself, and brought it to his mother in
> great haste; and when he reached the door of his father's house, but
> not unpursued, and was entering it in a great hurry, his foot stumbled
> on the threshold, and, falling down into the room where his mother was
> sitting, the two Pygmies seized the ball, which had dropped from his
> hand, and departed, spitting at and deriding the boy. On recovering
> from his fall, confounded with shame, and execrating the evil counsel
> of his mother, he returned by the usual track to the subterraneous
> road, but found no appearance of any passage, though he searched for
> it on the banks of the river for nearly the space of a year. Having
> been brought back by his friends and mother, and restored to his right
> way of thinking and his literary pursuits, he attained in process of
> time the rank of priesthood. Whenever David the Second, bishop of St.
> David's, talked to him in his advanced state of life concerning this
> event, he could never relate the particulars without shedding tears.

> He had also a knowledge of the language of that nation, and used to
> recite words of it he had readily acquired in his younger days. These
> words, which the bishop often repeated to me, were very conformable to
> the Greek idiom. When they asked for water, they said, *Udor udorum,*
> which signifies "Bring water;" for Udor, in their language, as well as
> in the Greek, signifies water; and Dwr also, in the British language,
> signifies water. When they want salt, they say, *Halgein udorum,*
> "Bring salt." Salt is called άλς in Greek, and Halen in British; for
> that language, from the length of time which the Britons (then called
> Trojans, and afterwards Britons from Brito, their leader) remained in
> Greece after the destruction of Troy, became, in many instances,
> similar to the Greek. \[a\]

> "If," says the learned archdeacon, "a scrupulous inquirer should ask
> my opinion of the relation here inserted, I answer, with Augustine,
> 'admiranda fore divina miracula non disputatione discutienda;' nor do
> I, by denial, place bounds to the Divine power; nor, by affirming
> insolently, extend that power which cannot be extended. But on such
> occasions I always call to mind that saying of Hieronymus: "Multa,"
> says he, 'incredibilia reperies et non verisimilia, quae nihilominus
> tamen vera sunt.' These, and any such that might occur, I should
> place, according to Augustine's opinion, among those things which are
> neither to be strongly affirmed nor denied.

> David Powel, who edited this work in 1585, thinks that this legend is
> written in imitation of the relation of Eros the Armenian, in Plato,
> or taken from Polo's account of the garden of the Old Man of the
> Mountain. \[b\]

> Again Giraldus writes,--" In these parts of Penbroch it has happed, in
> our times, that unclean spirits have conversed with mankind, not
> indeed visibly, but sensibly; for they manifested their presence at
> first in the house of one Stephen Wiriet, and some time after of
> William Not, by throwing dirt and such things as rather indicate an
> intention of mockery and injury. In the house of William, the spirit
> used to make rents and holes in both linen and woollen garments, to
> the frequent loss of both host and guest, from which injury no care
> and no bolts could protect them. In the house of Stephen, which was
> still more extraordinary, the spirit used to converse with people; and
> when they taunted him, which they frequently did out of sport, he used
> to charge them openly with those actions of theirs, from their birth,
> which they least wished to be heard or known by others. If you ask the
> cause and reason of this matter, I do not take on me to assign it;
> only this, that it, as is said, used to be the sign of a sudden
> change, either from poverty to riches, or rather from riches to
> desolation and poverty, as it was found to be a little after with both
> of these. But this I think worthy of remark, that places cannot be
> freed from illusions of this kind by the sprinkling of holy water, not
> merely of the ordinary, but even of the great kind; nor by the aid of
> any ecclesiastical sacrament. Nay, the priests themselves, when coming
> in with devotion, and fortified as well with the cross as with holy
> water, were forthwith among the first deified by the dirt thrown at
> them. From which it would appear that both sacramentals and sacraments
> defend from hurtful, not harmless things, and from injury, not from
> illusion." \[c\]
