LINES

>  

> Written in Rome in the Spring of 1842.

>  

> FAIR Tibur, once the Muses' home,  
> Before us lay; around  
> Was spread the plain which mighty Rome  
> Oft saw with victory crowned.

> The sun rode high, the sky was clear,  
> The lark poured forth his strain,  
> And flowers, the firstlings of the year,  
> Shed fragrance o'er the plain.

> A gentle lady turned on me  
> Her bright expressive eyes,  
> And bade the flame of poesy  
> Within my bosom rise.

> 'Twas then I felt, I felt, alas!  
> How Time has dealt with me,  
> And how the rays of fancy pass,  
> And vanish utterly.

> For time has been when such a view  
> And mandate of the fair,  
> With images of brightest hue,  
> Had fill'd the land and air:

> While now I strive, and strive in vain,  
> To twine poetic flowers,  
> Since from me Time away has ta'en  
> Imagination's powers.

> Then lady, be thou gentle still,  
> Let pity sway thy breast;  
> Accept for deeds the fervent will  
> To honour thy behest,

>
