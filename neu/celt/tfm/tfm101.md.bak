THE REJECTED GIFT

>   
> A DWARF came down one night from the chesnut woods on the side of the
> mountain over the village of Walchwyl, and enquired for the house of a
> midwife, whom he earnestly pressed to come out and go with him. She
> consented, and the Dwarf, bearing a light, led the way in silence to
> the woods. He stopped at last before a cleft in a rock, at which they
> entered, and the woman suddenly found herself in a magnificent hall.
> She was thence led through several rich apartments to the chamber of
> state, where the queen of the Dwarfs, for whom her services were
> required, was lying. She performed her office, and brought a fair
> young prince to the light. She was thanked and dismissed, and her
> former conductor appeared to lead her home. As he was taking leave of
> her, he filled her apron with something, bidding her on no account to
> look at it till she was in her own house. But the woman could not
> control her curiosity, and the moment the Dwarf disappeared, she
> partly opened the apron, and lo! there was nothing in it but some
> black coals. In a rage, she shook them out on the ground, but she kept
> two of them in her hands, as a proof of the shabby treatment she had
> met with from the Dwarfs. On reaching home, she threw them also down
> on the ground. Her husband cried out with joy and surprise, for they
> shone like carbuncles. She asserted that the Dwarf had put nothing but
> coals into her apron; but she ran out to call a neighbour, who knew
> more of such things than they did, and he on examining them pronounced
> them to be precious stones of great value. The woman immediately ran
> back to where she had shaken out the supposed coals, but they were all
> gone. \[a\]

> coals with the cross straws on them, and carried them home in spite of
> the screams of the Troll, and when he reached his own house he found
> it was a large treasure he had got, over which the Troll had lost all
> power. Thiele, 1. 122.
