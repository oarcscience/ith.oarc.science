LINES' WRITTEN IN A LADY'S ALBUM

>  

> IN those blest days, when free from care,  
> And happy as the birds in air,  
> I roamed the hills and dales,  
> By purling rills oft passed the day,  
> Or on green banks recumbent lay,  
> Listening the shepherds' tales,

> My fancy, rising on the wing,  
> Would visions fair before me bring,  
> Of castles high, and towers,  
> With knights in radiant panoply,  
> And ladies of the beaming eye,  
> Within their fragrant bowers;

> Or lead me thence away to shades  
> Of woods, and show me, in the glades,  
> The cottages serene,  
> Where Peace dwelt with Content, among  
> The happy, gay Arcadian throng  
> That tenanted the scene.

> But whether cot or tower arose  
> In vision, at the dawn or close  
> Of summer-days, to me,  
> The lovely form of woman still  
> Shone bright by dale, by mend, by rill,  
> Amid my extacy.

> I saw her robed in every grace  
> With youth, with loveliness of face,  
> And virtue's gentle eye;  
> And from her tongue heard accents fail,  
> That would the rudest heart enthral,  
> And raise emotions high.

> But like the Eastern prince, who loved  
> The pictured form of one that moved  
> In life full many a year  
> Ere he beheld the light, I deemed  
> The lovely form of which I dreamed  
> Would ne'er to me appear.

> And years came on, and years went by,  
> And yet I never found me nigh  
> My youthful vision bright.  
> I said,--I might as well, I ween,  
> Expect to see the Fairy-queen  
> Descend, to bless my sight.

> But often, when we hope it least,  
> And when our search has well nigh ceased,  
> Good fortune will befall:  
> So I one evening saw a maid,  
> Who every grace and charm displayed  
> That decked my
>
> Ideal.

> Her portrait here I need not show,  
> For, reader, thou must surely know  
> That peerless, gentle maid:  
> To her these lines I consecrate;  
> And if she smiles I'II deem, elate,  
> My toil far overpaid.
