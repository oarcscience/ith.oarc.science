NORTHERN ISLANDS

>  

> Här Necken sin Harpa i Glasborgen slår,  
> Och Hafsfruar kamma sltt grönskande hår,  
> Och bleka den skinande drägten.  
> STAGNELIUS.

> The Neck here his harp in the glass-castle plays,  
> And Mermaidens comb out their green hair always,  
> And bleach here their shining white clothes.

>  

> UNDER the title of Northern Islands we include all those lying in the
> ocean to the north of Scotland, to wit Iceland, the Feroes, Shetland,
> and the Orkneys.

> These islands were all peopled from Norway and Denmark during the
> ninth century. Till that time many of them, particularly Iceland and
> the Feroes, though, perhaps, occasionally visited by stray Vikings, or
> by ships driven out of their course by tempests, had lain waste and
> desert from the creation, the abode alone of wild beasts and birds.

> But at that period the proud nobles of Norway and Denmark, who scorned
> to be the vassals of Harold Fair-hair and Gorm the Old, the founders
> of the Norwegian and Danish monarchies, set forth in quest of new
> settlements, where, at a distance from these haughty potentates, they
> might live in the full enjoyment of their beloved independence.
> Followed by numerous vassals, they embarked on the wide Atlantic. A
> portion fixed themselves on the distant shores of Iceland; others took
> possession of the vacant Feroes; and more dispossessed the Peti and
> Papae, the ancient inhabitants of Shetland and the Orkneys, and seized
> on their country.

> As the Scandinavians were at that time still worshipers of Thor and
> Odin, the belief in Alfs and Dwarfs accompanied them to their new
> abodes, and there, as elsewhere, survived the introduction of
> Christianity. We now proceed to examine the vestiges of the old
> religion still to be traced.
