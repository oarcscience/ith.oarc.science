THE TWO FIDDLERS

>  

> NEARLY three hundred years ago, there dwelt in Strathspey two
> fiddlers, greatly renowned in their art. One Christmas they resolved
> to go try their fortune in Inverness. On arriving in that town they
> took lodgings, and as was the custom at that time, hired the bellman
> to go round announcing their arrival, their qualifications, their
> fame, and their terms. Soon after they were visited by a
> venerable-looking grey-haired old man, who not only found no fault
> with, but actually offered to double their terms if they would go with
> him. They agreed, and he led them out of the town, and brought them to
> a very strange-looking dwelling which seemed to them to be very like a
> Shian. The money, however, and the entreaties of their guide induced
> them to enter it, and their musical talents were instantly put into
> requisition, and the dancing was such as in their lives they had never
> witnessed.

> When morning came they took their leave highly gratified with the
> liberal treatment they had received. It surprised them greatly to find
> that it was out of a hill and not a house that they issued, and when
> they, came to the town, they could not recognise any place or person,
> every thing seemed so altered. While they and the townspeople were in
> mutual amazement, there came up a very old man, who on hearing their
> story, said: "You are then the two men who lodged with my
> great-grandfather, and whom Thomas Rimer, it was supposed, decoyed to
> Tomnafurach. Your friends were greatly grieved on your account, but it
> is a hundred years ago, and your names are now no longer known." It
> was the Sabbath day and the bells were tolling; the fiddlers, deeply
> penetrated with awe at what had occurred, entered the church to join
> in the offices of religion. They sat in silent meditation while the
> bell continued ringing, but the moment that the minister commenced the
> service they crumbled away into dust.
