GREAT BRITAIN

>   
>   
> In old wives dates that in old time did live,  
> To whose odde tales much credit men did give,  
> Great store of goblins, fairies, bugs, nightmares,  
> Urchins and elves to many a house repaires.  
> Old Poem.

>   
> WE use the term Great Britain in a very limited sense, as merely
> inclusive of those parts of the island whose inhabitants are of
> Gotho-German origin--England and the Lowlands of Scotland.

> We have already seen that the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain had in
> their language the terms from which are derived Elf and Dwarf, and the
> inference is natural that their ideas respecting these beings
> corresponded with those of the Scandinavians and Germans. The same may
> be said. of the Picts, who, akin to the Scandinavians, early seized on
> the Scottish Lowlands. We therefore close our survey of the Fairy
> Mythology of the Gotho-German race with Great Britain.
