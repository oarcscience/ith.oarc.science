THE WATER-SMITH

>  

> THERE is a little lake in Westphalia called the Darmssen, from which
> the peasants in the adjacent village of Epe used to hear all through
> the night a sound as if of hammering upon an anvil. People who were
> awake used also to see something in the middle of the lake. They got
> one time into a boat and went to it, and there they found that it was
> a smith, who, with his body raised over the water, and a hammer in his
> hand, pointed to an anvil, and bid the people bring him something to
> forge. Prom that time forth they brought iron to him, and no people
> had such good plough-irons as those of Epe.

> One time as a man from this village was getting reeds at the Darmssen,
> be found among them a little child that was rough all over his body.
> The smith cried out, "Don't take away my son!" but the man put the
> child on his back, and ran home with it. Since that time the smith has
> never more been seen or heard. The man reared the Roughy, and he
> became the cleverest and best lad in the place. But when he was twenty
> years old he said to the farmer, "Farmer, I must leave you. My father
> has called me!" "I am sorry for that," said the farmer. "Is there no
> way that you could stay with me?" "I will see about it," said the
> water-child. "Do you go to Braumske and fetch me a little sword; but
> you must give the seller whatever he asks for it, and not haggle about
> it." The farmer went to Braumske and bought the sword; but he haggled,
> and got something off the price. They now went together to the
> Darmssen, and the Roughy said, "Now mind. When I strike the water, if
> there comes up blood, I must go away; but if there comes milk, then I
> may stay with you." He struck the water, and there came neither milk
> nor blood. The Roughy was annoyed, and said, "You *have* been
> bargaining and haggling, and so there comes neither blood nor milk. Go
> off to Braumske and buy another sword." The farmer went and returned;
> but it was not till the third time that he bought a sword without
> haggling. When the Roughy struck the water with this it became as red
> as blood, and he threw himself into the lake, and never was seen more.
