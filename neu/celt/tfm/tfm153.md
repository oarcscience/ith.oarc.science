THE FAIRIES' CHRISTENING

>  

> A WOMAN related that being great with child, and expecting every
> moment the good hour, as she lay awake one night in her bed, she saw
> seven or eight little Women come into her chamber, one of whom had an
> infant in her arms. They were followed by a man of the same size with
> themselves, but in the habit of a minister. One of them went to the
> pail, and finding no water in it, cried out to the others, what *must*
> they do to christen the child? On which they replied it should be done
> in beer. With that the seeming parson took the child in his arms, and
> performed the ceremony of baptism, dipping his head into a great tub
> of strong beer, which the woman had brewed the day before to. be ready
> for her lying-in. She said they baptised the infant by the name of
> Joan, which made her know she was pregnant of a girl, as it proved a
> few days after when she was delivered. She added, that it was common
> for the fairies to make a mock christening when any person was near
> her time, and that, according to what child, male or female, they
> brought, such should the woman bring into the world.
