THE NIS AND THE MARE

>  

> THERE was a man who lived in the town of Tirup, who had a very
> handsome white mare. This mare had for many years gone, like an
> heirloom, from father to son, because there was a Nis attached to her,
> which brought luck to the place.

> This Nis was so fond of the mare, that he could hardly endure to let
> them put her to any kind of work, and he used to come himself every
> night and feed her of the best; and as for this purpose he usually
> brought a superfluity of corn, both threshed and in the straw, from
> the neighbours' barns, all the rest of the cattle enjoyed the
> advantage of it, and they were all kept in exceeding good case.

> It happened at last that the farm-house passed into the hands of a new
> owner, who refused to put any faith in what they told him about the
> mare, so the luck speedily left the place, and went after the mare to
> his poor neighbour who bad bought her; and within five days after his
> purchase, the poor farmer who had bought the mare began to find his
> circumstances gradually improving, while the income of the other, day
> after day, fell away and diminished at such a rate, that be was hard
> set to make both ends meet.

> If now the man who had gotten the mare had only known how to be quiet,
> and enjoy the good times that were come upon him, he and his children,
> and his children's children after him, would have been in flourishing
> circumstances till this very day. But when he saw the quantity of corn
> that came every night to his barn, he could not resist his desire to
> get a sight of the Nis. So he concealed himself one evening, at
> nightfall, in the stable; and as soon as it was midnight, he saw how
> the Nis came from his neighbour's barn and brought a sackful of corn
> with him. It was now unavoidable that the Nis should get a sight of
> the man who was watching; so he, with evident marks of grief, gave the
> mare her food for the last time, cleaned, and dressed her to the best
> of his abilities, and when he had done, turned round to where the man
> was lying and bid him farewell.

> From that day forward the circumstances of both the neighbours were on
> an equality, for each now kept his own.
