THE POWER OF THE HARP

>   
>   
> LITTLE Kerstin she weeps in her bower all the day;  
> Sir Peter in his courtyard is playing so gay.  
> My heart's own dear!  
> Tell me wherefore you grieve?

> "Grieve you for saddle, or grieve you for steed?  
> Or grieve you for that I have you wed?"  
> My heart's, &c.

> "And grieve do I not for saddle or for steed:  
> And grieve do I not for that I have you wed.  
> My heart's, &c.

> "Much more do I grieve for my fair gold hair,  
> Which in the blue waves shall be stained to-day.  
> My heart's, &c.

> "Much more do I grieve for Ringfalla flood,  
> In which have been drowned my two sisters proud.  
> My heart's, &c.

> "It was laid out for me in my infancy,  
> That my wedding-day should prove heavy to me."  
> My heart's, &c.

> "And I shall make them the horse round shoe,  
> He shall not stumble on his four gold shoes.  
> My heart's, &c.

> "Twelve of my courtiers shall before thee ride,  
> Twelve of my courtiers upon each side."  
> My heart's, &c.

> But when they were come to Ringfalla wood,  
> There sported a hart with gilded horns prowl.  
> My heart's, &c.

> And all the courtiers after the hart are gone;  
> Little Kerstin, she must proceed alone.  
> My heart's, &c.

> And when on Ringfalla bridge she goes,  
> Her steed he stumbled on his four gold shoes.  
> My heart's, &c.

> Four gold shoes, and thirty gold nails,  
> And the maiden into the swift stream falls.  
> My heart's, &c.

> Sir Peter he spake to his footpage so--  
> "Thou must for my gold harp instantly go."  
> My heart's, &c.

> The first stroke on his gold harp he gave  
> The foul ugly Neck sat and laughed on the wave.  
> My heart's, &c.

> The second time the gold harp he swept,  
> The foul ugly Neck on the wave sat and wept.  
> My heart's, &c.

> The third stroke on the gold harp rang,  
> Little Kerstin reached up her snow-white arm.  
> My heart's, &c.

> He played the bark from off the high trees;  
> He played Little Kerstin back on his knees.  
> My heart's, &c.

> And the Neck he out of' the waves came there,  
> And a proud maiden on each arm be bare.  
> My heart's, &c.  
> Tell me wherefore you grieve? \[a\]

> The STROMKARL, called in Norway Grim or Fosse-Grim \[b\]
> *(Waterfall-Grim)* is a musical genius like the Neck. Like him too,
> when properly propitiated, he communicates his art. The sacrifice also
> is a black lamb \[c\] which the offerer must present with averted
> head, and on Thursday evening. If it is poor the pupil gets no further
> than to the tuning of the instruments; if it is fat the Strömkarl
> seizes the votary by the right hand, and swings it backwards and
> forwards till the blood runs out at the finger-ends. The aspirant is
> then enabled to play in such a masterly manner that the trees dance
> and waterfalls stop at his music. \[d\]

> The Havmand, or Merman, is described as of a handsome form, with green
> or black hair and beard. He dwells either in the bottom of the sea, or
> in the cliffs and hills near the sea shore, and is regarded as rather
> a good and beneficent kind of being. \[e\]

> The Havfrue, or Mermaid, is represented in the popular tradition
> sometimes as a good, at other lames as an evil and treacherous being.
> She is beautiful in her appearance.

> Fishermen sometimes see her in the bright summer's sun, when a thin
> mist hangs over the sea, sitting on the surface of the water, and
> combing her long golden hair with a golden comb, or driving up her
> snow-white cattle to feed on the strands and small islands. At other
> times she comes as a beautiful maiden, chilled and shivering with the
> cold of the night, to the fires the fishers have kindled, hoping by
> this means to entice them to her love. \[f\] Her appearance
> prognosticates both storm and ill success in their fishing. People
> that are drowned, and whose bodies are not found, are believed to be
> taken into the dwellings of the Mermaids. These beings are also
> supposed to have the power of foretelling future events. A Mermaid, we
> are told, prophesied the birth of Christian IV. of Denmark, and

> En Havfrue op af Vandet steg,  
> Og spaade Herr Sinklar ilde.  
> SINCLAR'S VISA.

> A mermaid from the water rose,  
> And spaed Sir Sinclar ill.

> Fortune-telling has been in all countries a gift of the sea-people. We
> need hardly mention the prophecies of Nereus and Proteus.

> A girl one time fell into the power of a Havfrue and passed fifteen
> years in her submarine abode without ever seeing the sun. At length
> her brother went down in quest of her, and succeeded in bringing her
> back to the upper world. The Havfrue waited for seven years expecting
> her return, but when she did not come back, she struck the water with
> her staff and made it boil up and cried--

> Hade jag trott att du varit så falsk,  
> Så skulle jag kreckt dig din tiufvehals!

> Had I but known thee so false to be,  
> Thy thieving neck I'd have cracked for thee. \[g\]

> \[d\] The Strömkarl has eleven different measures, to ten of which
> alone people may dance; the eleventh belongs to the night spirit his
> host. If any one plays it, tables and benches, cans and cups, old men
> and women, blind and lame, even the children in the cradle, begin to
> dance.--Arndt.

> \[e\] In the Danske Viser and Folkesagn there are a few stories of
> Mermen, such as Rosmer Havmand arid Marstig's Daughter, both
> translated by Dr. Jamieson, and Agnete and the Merman, which resembles
> Proud Margaret. It was natural, says Afzelius, that what in Sweden was
> related of a Hill King, should, in Denmark, be ascribed to a Merman.

> \[f\] The appearance of the Wood-woman *(Skogsfru)* or Elve-woman, is
> equally unlucky for hunters. She also approaches the fires, and seeks
> to seduce young men.
