THE NIS STEALING CORN

 

> THERE lived a man at Thyrsting, in Jutland, who had a Nis in his barn.
> This Nis used to attend to the cattle, and at night he would steal
> fodder for them from the neighbours, so that this farmer had the best
> fed and most thriving cattle in the country.

> One time the boy went along with the Nis to Fugleriis to steal corn.
> The Nis took as much as he thought he could well carry, but the boy
> was more covetous, and said, "Oh, take more; sure we can rest now and
> then?" "Rest!" said the Nis; "rest! and what is rest?*"* "Do what I
> tell you," replied the boy; "take more, and we shall find, rest when
> we get out of this."--The Nis then took more, and they went away with
> it. But when they were come to the lands of Thyrsting, the Nis grew
> tired, and then the boy said to him, "Here now is rest;" and they both
> sat down on the side of a little hill. "If I had known," said the Nis,
> as they were sitting there, "if I had known that rest was so good, I'd
> have carried, off all that was in the barn."

> It happened some time after that the boy and the Nis were no longer
> friends, and as the Nis was sitting one day in the granary-window,
> with his legs hanging out into the yard, the boy ran at him and
> tumbled him back into the granary. But the Nis took his satisfaction
> of him that very same night; for when the boy was gone to bed, he
> stole down to where he was lying, and. carried him naked as he was out
> into the yard, and then laid two pieces of wood across the well, and
> put him lying on them, expecting that, when he awoke, he would fall
> from the fright down into the well and be drowned. But he was
> disappointed, for the boy came off without injury.
