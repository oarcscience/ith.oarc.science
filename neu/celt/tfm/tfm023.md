MAID VAE

>  

> THERE was once a wedding and a great entertainment at Oesterhaesinge.
> The party did not break up till morning, and the guests took their
> departure with a great deal of noise and bustle. While they were
> putting their horses to their carriages, previous to setting out home,
> they stood talking about their respective bridal-presents. And while
> they were talking loudly, and with the utmost earnestness, there came
> from a neighbouring moor a maiden clad in green, with plaited rushes
> on her head; she went up to the man who was loudest, and bragging most
> of his present, and said to him: "What wilt thou give to maid Vae?"
> The man, who was elevated with all the ale and brandy he had been
> drinking, snatched up a whip, and replied: "Ten cuts of my whip;" and
> that very moment he dropt down dead on the ground. \[a\]
