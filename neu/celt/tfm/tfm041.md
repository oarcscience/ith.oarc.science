THE GIRL AT THE TROLL DANCE

>  

> A GIRL, belonging to a village in the isle of' Funen, went out, one
> evening, into the fields, and as she was passing by a small hill, she
> saw that it was raised upon red pillars, and a Troll-banquet going on
> beneath it. She was invited in, and such was the gaiety and festivity
> that prevailed, that she never perceived the flight of time. At
> length, however, she took her departure, after having spent, as she
> thought, a few hours among the joyous hill-people. But when she came
> to the village she no longer found it the place she had left. All was
> changed; and when she entered the house in which she had lived with
> her family, she learned that her father and mother had long been dead,
> and the house had come into the hands of strangers. She now perceived.
> that for every hour that she had been among the Trolls, a year had
> elapsed in the external world. The effect on her mind. was such that
> she lost her reason, which she never after recovered. \[a\]
