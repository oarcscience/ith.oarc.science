THE FAIRY-WHIPPING

>   
> A WOMAN who lived about two miles distant from Ballasalli, and used to
> serve Mr. Waldron's family with butter, made him once very merry with
> a story she told him of her daughter, a girl of about ten years old,
> who being sent over the fields to the town for a pennyworth of tobacco
> for her father, was on the top of a mountain surrounded by a great
> number of little men, who would not suffer her to pass any farther.
> Some of them said she should go with them, and accordingly laid hold
> of her; but one, seeming more pitiful, desired they would let her
> alone, which they refusing, there ensued a quarrel, and the person who
> took her part fought bravely in her defence. This so incensed the
> others, that to be revenged on her for being the cause, two or three
> of them seized her, and. pulling up her clothes, whipped her heartily;
> after which, it seems, they had no farther power over her, and she ran
> home directly telling what had befallen her, and showing her buttocks,
> on which were the prints of several small hands. Several of the
> town's-people went with her to the mountain; and she conducting them
> to the spot, the little antagonists were gone, but had left behind
> them proofs, as the good woman said, that what the girl had informed
> them was true, for there was a great deal of blood to be seen on the
> stones, This did she aver with all the solemnity possible.
