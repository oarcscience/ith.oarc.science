EASTERN EUROPE

>  

> Up the hill I went, and gazed round.  
> Hoping golden maids to see;  
> Trooping lovely maidens came, who  
> Round the hill danced merrily.

> All the sweetest ditties singing,  
> Sweetest ditties that might be;  
> Bearing fragrant apple-blossoms,  
> These fair maidens came to me.  
> Lettish Song.

> Europe is inhabited on the east and north-east, from the Frozen Ocean
> to the Adriatic, by two extensive races named the Finns and the
> Slaves. The former dwell round the northern edge of Scandinavia by the
> Icy Ocean, and on the east and south-east of the Baltic. The Majjars,
> or the dominant portion of the people of Hungary, are also of Finnish
> origin. The Slaves who are akin to the Gotho-German race are also
> widely spread. This stem numbers among its branches the Russians,
> Poles, Bohemians, Servians, and the nations dwelling north-east of the
> Adriatic. Our knowledge of the popular mythology of both races is very
> limited.
