CONCLUSION

>  

> HERE, then, we conclude. The task which we imposed on ourselves was to
> collect, arrange, classify, and give under one point of view the
> various ideas and legends respecting Fairies and similar beings of the
> popular creed, which lay scattered in a variety of books and a variety
> of languages. We have marked resemblances, traced coincidences, and
> offered etymologies. Many legends, especially German ones, we know,
> exist, which are not to be found. in this work; but, in general, they
> offer no new traits of popular lore, and most persons will, we
> apprehend, be content with what we have given.

> The labours of MM. Grimm in this department of philosophy can never be
> too highly praised. They have been, in fact, the creators of it; and
> the German Mythology is a work of the most extensive learning, and
> written in the spirit of true philosophy. And this is no light praise;
> for of all subjects, Mythology appears to be the one on which
> imagination is most apt to run riot. Hence, it has been frequently
> almost brought into contempt by the wild vagaries of those who have
> presumed to write on it without judgement or common sense. Though all
> may not agree with the opinions or deductions in the preceding pages,
> we trust that they will find in them no traces of ill-regulated
> imagination.

> As works of this kind have no bearing on material enjoyments, the
> number of those who will think lightly of them in these days will, of
> course, not be small. But in the view of sane reason and philosophy,
> the subject is by no means unimportant, nay, it is even more important
> than many of higher pretensions. To trace the corruption and
> degradation of the pure religion of the Gospel, has always been held
> to be a task worthy of the highest intellect: we should not,
> therefore, despise the present one, which is the same in kind though
> different in degree. We have seen that all these legendary beings and
> their characters and acts are remnants of ancient religious systems,
> the mental offspring of deep-thinking sages. It is surely, then, not
> uninteresting to trace them to their present form and condition. Even
> in a historic point of view they are not undeserving of attention.
> Thus, should our theory on the subject be correct, it is of importance
> to observe how the tribes around the Baltic, when they made conquests
> in the Roman Empire, brought with them the religious ideas of their
> forefathers, and left traces of them, which are discernible even at
> the present day. Again, nothing more interests the botanist than to
> find the same plants, modified by local circumstances, growing in
> widely-distant regions. The interest is similar when we find the same
> legends, modified also by circumstances, springing up in distant
> countries, and amongst tribes and nations who could hardly have had
> any communication.

> This work is therefore to be regarded as a part of the philosophy of
> popular fiction. It is not by any means intended to be a work of mere
> amusement, and those who view or represent it in that light will do it
> manifest injustice. Many of the legends, no doubt, may possess
> attractions even for children; but the same is true of the narratives
> of Herodotus, and still more of those of the Old Testament, and
> therefore should not derogate from its real importance. At the same
> time, we have adopted a light and facile style, as that which we
> deemed best suited to the character of the subject and the taste of
> this country; but we trust that this will not lower either our subject
> or ourselves in the eyes of our readers. \[a\]
