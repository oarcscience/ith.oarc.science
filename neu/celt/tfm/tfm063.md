THE MERMAID WIFE

>  

> ON a fine summer's evening, an inhabitant of Unst happened to be
> walking along the sandy margin of a voe. \[a\] The moon was risen, and
> by her light he discerned at some distance before him a number of the
> sea-people, who were dancing with great vigour on the smooth sand.
> Near them he saw lying on the ground several seal-skins.

> As the man approached the dancers, all gave over their merriment, and
> flew like lightning to secure their garments; then clothing
> themselves, plunged in the form of seals into the sea. But the
> Shetlander, on coming up to the spot where they had been, and casting
> his eyes down on the ground, saw that they had left one skin behind
> them, which was lying just at his feet. He snatched it up, carried it
> swiftly away, and placed it in security.

> On returning to the shore, he met the fairest maiden that eye ever
> gazed upon: she was walking backwards and forwards, lamenting m most
> piteous tones the loss of her seal-skin robe, without which she never
> could hope to rejoin her family and friends below the waters, but must
> remain an unwilling inhabitant of the region enlightened by the sun.

> The man approached and endeavoured to console her, but she would not
> be comforted. She implored him in the most moving accents to restore
> her dress; but the view of her lovely face, more beautiful in tears,
> had steeled his heart. He represented to her the impossibility of her
> return, and that her friends would soon give her up;,and finally, made
> an offer to her of his heart, hand, and fortune.

> The sea-maiden, finding she had no alternative, at length consented to
> beoome his wife. They were married, and lived together for many years,
> during which time they had several children, who retained no vestiges
> of their marine origin, saving a thin web between their fingers, and a
> bend of their hands, resembling that of the fore paws of a seal;
> distinctions which characterise the descendants of the family to the
> present day.

> The Shetlander's love for his beautiful wife was unbounded, but she
> made but a cold return to his affection. Often would she steal out
> alone and hasten down to the lonely strand, and there at a given
> signal, a seal of large size would make his appearance, and they would
> converse for hours together in an unknown language; and she would
> return home from this meeting pensive and melancholy.

> Thus glided away years, and her hopes of leaving the upper world had
> nearly vanished, when it chanced one day, that one of the children,
> playing behind a stack of corn, found a seal-skin. Delighted with his
> prize, he ran with breathless eagerness to display it before his
> mother. Her eyes glistened with delight at the view of it; for in it
> she saw her own dress, the loss of which had cost her so many tears.
> She now regarded herself as completely emancipated from thraldom; and
> in idea she was already with her friends beneath the waves. One thing
> alone was a drawback on her raptures. She loved her children, and she
> was now about to leave them for ever. Yet they weighed not against the
> pleasures she had in prospect: so after kissing and embracing them
> several times, she took up the skin, went out, and proceeded down to
> the beach.

> In a few minutes after the husband came in, and the children told him
> what had occurred. The truth instantly flashed across his mind, and he
> hurried down to the shore with all the speed that love and anxiety
> could give. But he only arrived in time to see his wife take the form
> of a seal, and from the ledge of a rock plunge into the sea.

> The large seal, with whom she used to hold her conversations,
> immediately joined her, and congratulated her on her escape, and they
> quitted the shore together. But ere she went she turned round to her
> husband, who stood in mute despair on the, rock, and whose misery
> excited feelings of compassion in her breast. "Farewell," said she to
> him, "and may all good fortune attend you. I loved you well while I
> was with you, but I always loved my first husband better." \[b\]

>  

> The water-spirit is in Shetland called Shoopiltee; he appears in the
> form of a pretty little horse, and endeavours to entice persons to
> ride on him, and then gallops with them into the sea.
