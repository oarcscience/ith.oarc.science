>  

> ELINAS, king of Albania, to divert his grief for the death of his
> wife, amused himself with hunting. One day, at the chase, he went to a
> fountain to quench his thirst: as he approached it he heard the voice
> of a woman singing, and on coming to it he found there the beautiful
> Fay Pressina.

> After some time the Fay bestowed her hand upon him, on the condition
> that he should never visit her at the time of her lying-in. She had
> three daughters at a birth: Melusina, Melior, and Palatina. Nathas,
> the king's son by a former wife, hastened to convey the joyful tidings
> to his father, who, without reflection, flew to the chamber of the
> queen, and entered as she was bathing her daughters. Pressina, on
> seeing him, cried out that he had broken his word, and she must
> depart; and taking up her three daughters, she disappeared.

> She retired to the Lost Island; \[a\] so called because it was only by
> chance any, even those who had repeatedly visited it, could find it.
> Here she reared her children, taking them every morning to a high
> mountain, whence Albania might be seen, and telling them that but for
> their father's breach of promise they might have lived happily in the
> distant land which they beheld. When they were fifteen years of age,
> Melusina asked her mother particularly of what their father had been
> guilty. On being informed of it, she conceived the design of being
> revenged on him. Engaging her sisters to join in her plans, they set
> out for Albania: arrived there, they took the king and all his wealth,
> and, by a charm, inclosed him in a high mountain, called Brandelois.
> On telling their mother what they had clone, she, to punish them for
> the unnatural action, condemned Melusina to become every Saturday a
> serpent, from the waist downwards, till she should meet a man who
> would marry her under the condition of never seeing her on a Saturday,
> and should keep his promise. She inflicted other judgements on her two
> sisters, less severe in proportion to their guilt. Melusina now went
> roaming through the world in search of the man who was to deliver her.
> She passed through the Black Forest, and that of Ardennes, and at last
> she arrived in the forest of Colombiers, in Poitou, where all the Fays
> of the neighbourhood came before her, telling her they had been
> waiting for her to reign in that place.

> Raymond having accidentally killed the count, his uncle, by the
> glancing aside of his boar-spear, was wandering by night in the forest
> of Colombiers. he arrived at a fountain that rose at the foot of a
> high rock. This fountain was called by the people the Fountain of
> Thirst, or the Fountain of the Fays,\[b\] on account of the many
> marvellous things which had happened at it. At the time, when Raymond
> arrived at the fountain, three lathes were diverting themselves there
> by the light of the moon, the principal of whom was Melusina. Her
> beauty and her amiable manners quickly won his love: she soothed him,
> concealed the deed he had done, and married him, he promising on his
> oath never to desire to see her on a Saturday. She assured him that a
> breach of his oath would for ever deprive him of her whom he so much
> loved, and be followed by the unhappiness of both .for life. Out of
> her great wealth, she built for him, in the neighbourhood of the
> Fountain of Thirst, where he first saw her, the castle of Lusignan.
> She also built La Rochelle, Cloitre Malliers, Mersent, and other
> places.

> But destiny, that would have Melusina single, was incensed against
> her. The marriage was made unhappy by the deformity of the children
> born of one that was enchanted; but still Raymond's love for the
> beauty that ravished both heart and eyes remained unshaken. Destiny
> now renewed her attacks. Raymond's cousin had excited him to jealousy
> and to secret concealment, by malicious suggestions of the purport of
> the Saturday retirement of the countess. He hid himself; and then saw
> how the lovely form of Melusina ended below in a snake, gray and
> sky-blue, mixed with white. But it was not horror that seized him at
> the sight, it was infinite anguish at the reflection that through his
> breach of faith he might lose his lovely wife for ever. Yet this
> misfortune had not speedily come on him, were it not that his son,
> Geoffroi with the tooth, \[c\] had burned his brother Freimund, who
> would stay in the abbey of Malliers, with the abbot and a hundred
> monks. At which the afflicted father, count Raymond, when his wife
> Melusina was entering his closet to comfort him, broke out into these
> words against her, before all the courtiers who attended her:--" Out
> of my sight, thou pernicious snake and odious serpent! thou
> contaminator of my race!"

> Melusina's former anxiety was now verified, and the evil that had lain
> so long in ambush had now fearfully sprung on him and her. At these
> reproaches she fainted away; and when at length she revived, full of
> the profoundest grief, she declared to him that she must now depart
> from him, and, in obedience to a decree of destiny, fleet about the
> earth in pain and suffering, as a spectre, until the day of doom; and
> that only when one of her race was to die at Lusignan would she become
> visible.

> Her words at parting were these:

> "But one thing will I say unto thee before I part, that thou, and
> those who for more than a hundred years shall succeed thee, shall know
> that whenever I am seen to hover over the fair castle of Lusignan,
> then will it be certain that in that very year the castle will get a
> new lord; and though people may not perceive me in the air, yet they
> will see me by the Fountain of Thirst; and thus shall it be so long as
> the castle stands in honour and flourishing--especially on the Friday
> before the lord of the castle shall die." Immediately, with wailing
> and loud lamentation, she left the castle of Lusignan, \[d\] and has
> ever since existed as a spectre of the night. Raymond died as a hermit
> on Monserrat.

> The president de Boissieu says, \[e\] that she chose for her retreat
> one of the mountains of Sassenage, near Grenoble, on account of
> certain vats that are there, and to which she communicated a virtue
> which makes them, at this day, one of the seven wonders of Dauphiné.
> They are two in number, of great beauty, and so admirably cut in the
> rock, that it is easy to see they are not the work of unaided nature,
> The virtue which Melusina communicated to them was, that of
> announcing, by the water they contain, the abundance or scantiness of
> the crops. When there is to be an abundant harvest, it rises over the
> edges, and overflows; in middling years, the vats are but half full;
> and when the crops are to fail, they are quite dry. One of these vats
> is consecrated to corn, the other to wine.

> The popular belief was strong in France that she used to appear on
> what was called the tower of Melusina as often as any of the lords of
> the race of Lusignan was to die; and that when the family was extinct,
> and the castle had fallen to the crown,, she was seen whenever a king
> of France was to depart this life. Mézeray informs us that he was
> assured of the truth of the appearance of Melusina on this tower
> previous to the death of a Lusignan, or a king of France, by people of
> reputation, and who were not by any means credulous. She appeared in a
> mourning dress, and continued for a long time to utter the most
> heart-piercing lamentation.

> The following passage occurs in Brantôme's Eloge of the Duke of
> Montpensier, who in 1574 destroyed Lusignan, and several other
> retreats of the Huguenots:

> "I heard, more than forty years ago, an old veteran say, that when the
> Emperor Charles V came to France, they brought him by Lusignan for the
> sake of the recreation of hunting the deer, which were there in great
> abundance in fine old parks of France; that he was never tired
> admiring and praising the beauty, the size, and the chef d'ceuvre of
> that house, built, which is more, by such a lady, of whom he made them
> tell him several fabulous tales, which are there quite common, even to
> the good old women who washed their linen at the fountain, whom Queen
> Catherine of Medicis, mother to the king, would also question and
> listen to. Some told her that they used sometimes to see her come to
> the fountain to bathe in it, in the form of a most beautiful woman,
> and in the dress of a widow. Others said that they used to see her,
> but very rarely, and that on Saturday evening, (for in that state she
> did not let herself be seen,) bathing, half her body being that of a
> very beautiful lady, the other half ending in a snake: others, that
> she used to appear a-top of the great tower in a very beautiful form,
> and as a snake. Some said, that when any great disaster was to come on
> the kingdom, or a change of reign, or a death, or misfortune among her
> relatives, who were the greatest people of France, and were kings,
> that three days before she was heard to cry, with a cry most shrill
> and terrible, three times.

> "This is held to be perfectly true. Several persons of that place, who
> have heard it, are positive of it, and hand it from father to son; and
> say that, even when the siege came on, many soldiers and men of honour
> who were there affirmed it. But it was when the order was given to
> throw down and destroy her castles that she uttered her loudest cries
> and wails. This is perfectly true, according to the saying of people
> of honour. Since then she has not been heard. Some old wives, however,
> say she has appeared to them, but very rarely."

> Jean d'Arras declares that Servile, who defended the castle of
> Lusignan for the English against the Duke of Bern, swore to that
> prince, upon his faith and honour, "that, three days before the
> surrender of the fortress, there entered into his chamber, though the
> doors were shut, a large serpent, enamelled with white and blue, which
> came and struck its tail several times against the feet of the bed
> where he was lying with his wife, who was not at all frightened at it,
> though he was very much so; and that when he seized his sword, the
> serpent changed all at once into a woman, arid said to him, *How,
> Serville, you who have been at so many sieges and battles, are you
> afraid! Know that I am the mistress of this castle, which I have
> built, and that you must surrender it very soon.* When she had ended
> these words she resumed her serpent-shape, and glided away so swiftly
> that he could not perceive her." The author adds, that the prince told
> him that other credible people had sworn to him that they too had seen
> her at the same time in other places in the neighbourhood, and in the
> same form.

>  

> The old castle of Pirou, on the coast of the Cotentin, in Lower
> Normandy, likewise owes its origin to the Fées. \[f\] These were the
> daughters of a great lord of the country, who was a celebrated
> magician. They built the castle long before the time of the invasions
> of the Northmen, and dwelt there in peace and unity. But when these
> pirates began to make their descents on the coast, the Fees, fearing
> their violence, changed themselves into wild geese, and thus set them
> at defiance. They did not, however, altogether abandon their castle;
> for the elders of the place assert that every year, on the first of
> March, a flock of wild geese returns to take possession of the nests
> they had hollowed out for themselves in its walls. It was also said
> that when a male child was born to the illustrious house of Pirou, the
> males of these geese, displaying their finest grey plumage, strutted
> about on the pavement in the courts of the castle; while, if it was a
> girl, the females, in plumage whiter than snow, took precedence then
> over the males. If the new-born maiden was to be a nun, it was
> remarked that one of them did not join with the rest, but kept alone
> in a corner, eating little, and deeply sighing.

> The following traditions are attached to the castles of Argouges and
> Rânes, in Normandy:--\[g\]

> One of the lords of Argouges, when out hunting one day, met a bevy of
> twenty ladies of rare beauty, all mounted on palfreys white as the
> driven snow. One of them appeared to be their queen, and the lord of
> Argouges became all at once so deeply enamoured of her, that he
> offered on the spot to marry her. This lady was *fée;* she had for a
> long time past secretly protected the Sire d'Argouges, and even caused
> him to come off victorious in a combat with a terrible giant. As she
> loved the object of her care, she willingly accepted his troth, but
> under the express condition that he should never pronounce in her
> presence the name of Death. So light a condition caused no difficulty;
> the marriage took place under the happiest auspices, and lovely
> children crowned their union. The fatal word was never heard, and
> their happiness seemed without alloy. It came to pass, however, one
> day at length, that the wedded pair were preparing to give their
> presence at a tournament. The lady was long at her toilet, and her
> husband waited for her with impatience. At length she made her
> appearance. "Fair dame," said he, when he saw her, "you would be a
> good person to send to fetch Death; for you take long enough to
> perform what you are about." \[h\] Hardly had he pronounced the fatal
> word when, uttering a piercing cry, as if actually struck by death,
> the Fée lady disappeared, leaving the mark of her hand on the gate.
> She comes every night clad in a white robe, and wanders round and
> round the castle, uttering deep and continuous groans, amid which may
> be heard, in funereal notes,
>
> Death! Death!

> The same legend, as we have said, adheres to the castle of Ranes,
> where, however, it was on the top of a tower that the Fee vanished,
> leaving, like Melusina, the mark of her foot on the battlements, where
> it is still to be seen.

> In explication of the former legend, M. Pluque observes, that at the
> siege of Bayeux by Henry I., in 1106, Robert d'Argouges vanquished in
> single combat a German of huge stature; and that the crest of the
> house of Argouges is Faith, under the form of a woman naked to the
> waist, seated in a bark, with the motto, or war-cry, *A la Fé! (i.* e.
> *à* *la foi!)* which the people pronounce
>
> A la Fée!

> So far the genuine French Fees. On the revival of learning they appear
> to have fallen into neglect, till the memory of them was awakened by
> the appearance of the translation of the Italian tales of Straparola,
> many of which seem to have become current among the people; and in the
> end of the seventeenth century, the Contes des Fées of Perrault,
> Madame d'Aulnoy, and their imitators and successors, gave them vogue
> throughout Europe. These tales are too well known to our readers to
> require us to make any observations on them.
