THE DUERGAR

>  

> By ek fur jőrth nethan,  
> A ek, undir stein, stath.  
> Alvis--Mal.

> (I dwell the earth beneath,  
> I possess, under the stone, my seat.)

>  

> THESE diminutive beings, dwelling in rocks and hills, and
> distinguished for their skill in metallurgy, seem to be peculiar to
> the Gotho-German mythology \[a\] Perhaps the most probable account of
> them is, that they are personifications of the subterraneous powers of
> nature; for it may be again observed, that all the parts of every
> ancient mythology are but personified powers, attributes, and moral
> qualities. The Edda thus describes their origin:-

> "Then the gods sat on their seats, and held a council, and called to
> mind how the Duergar had become animated in the clay below in the
> earth, like maggots in flesh. The Duergar had been first created, and
> had taken life in Ymir's \[b\] flesh, and were maggots in it, and by
> the will of the gods 'they became partakers of human knowledge, and
> had the likeness of men, and yet they abode in the ground and in
> stones. Modsogner was the first of them, and then Dyrin."

> The Duergar are described as being of low stature, with short legs and
> long arms, reaching almost down to the ground when they stand erect.
> \[c\] They are skilful and expert workmen in gold, silver, iron, and
> the other metals. They form many wonderful and extraordinary things
> for the Aeser, and for mortal heroes, and the arms and armour that
> come from their forges are not to be paralleled. Yet the gift must be
> spontaneously bestowed, for misfortune attends those extorted from
> them by violence \[d\]

> In illustration of their character we bring forward the following
> narratives from the Edda and Sagas. The homely garb in which they are
> habited, will not, it is hoped, be displeasing to readers of taste. We
> give as exact & copy as we are able of the originals in all their
> rudeness. The tales are old, their date unknown, and they therefore
> demand respect. Yet it is difficult to suppress a smile at finding
> such familiar, nay almost vulgar terms \[e\] applied to the great
> supernal powers of nature, as occur in the following tale from the
> Edda.

> \[a\] some think, but with little reason, they were originally a part
> of the Finnish mythology, and were adopted into the Gothic system  
>   
> \[b\] the giant Ynsir is a personification of Chaos, the undigested
> primal matter. The sons of Börr (other personifications) slew him. Out
> of him they formed the world; his blood made the sea, his flesh the
> land; his bones the mountains; rocks and cliffs were his teeth, jaws,
> and broken pieces of bones; his skull formed the heavens.  
>   
> \[c\] Gudmund Andreas in notis ad Völsupá.  
>   
> \[d\] that they are not insensible to kindness one of the succeeding
> tales will show.  
>   
> \[e\] the habitual reader of the northern and German writers, or even
> our old English ones, will observe with surprise his gradually
> diminished contempt for many expressions now become vulgar. He will
> find himself imperceptibly falling into the habit of regarding thorns
> in the light of their pristine-dignity.
