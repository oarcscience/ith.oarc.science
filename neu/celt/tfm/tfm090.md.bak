THE HEINZELMANCHEN

>  

> IT is not over fifty years since the Heinzelmänchen, as they are
> called, used to live and perform their exploits in Cologne. They were
> little naked mannikins, who used to do all sorts of work; bake bread,
> wash, and such like house-work. So it is said, but no one ever saw
> them.

> In the time that the Heinzelmänchen were still there, there was in
> Cologne many a baker, who kept no man, for the little people used
> always to make over-night, as much black and white bread as the baker
> wanted for his shop. In many houses they used to wash and do all their
> work for the maids.

> Now, about this time, there was an expert tailor to whom they appeared
> to have taken a great fancy, for when he married he found in his
> house, on the wedding-day, the finest victuals and the most beautiful
> vessels and utensils, which the little folk had stolen elsewhere and
> brought to their favourite. When, with time, his family increased, the
> little ones used to give the tailor's wife considerable aid in her
> household affairs; they washed for her, and on holidays and festival
> times they scoured the copper and tin, and the house from the garret
> to the cellar. If at any time the tailor had a press of work, he was
> sure to find it all ready done for him in the morning by the
> Heinzelmänchen. But curiosity began now to torment the tailor's wife,
> and she was dying to get one sight of the Heinzelmänchen, but do what
> she would she could never compass it. She one time strewed peas all
> down the stairs that they might fail and hurt themselves, and that so
> she might see them next morning. But this project missed, and since
> that time the Heinzelmänchen have totally disappeared, as has been
> everywhere the case, owing to the curiosity of people, which has at
> all times been the destruction of so much of what was beautiful in the
> world. The Heinzelmänchen, in consequence of this, went off all in a
> body out of the town with music playing, but people could only hear
> the music, for no one could see the mannikins themselves, who
> forthwith got into a boat and went away, whither no one knows. The
> good times, however, are said to have disappeared from Cologne along
> with the Heinzelmänchen. \[a\]
