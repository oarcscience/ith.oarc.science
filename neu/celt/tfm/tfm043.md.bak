THE TILE-STOVE JUMPING OVER THE BROOK

>  

> NEAR Hellested in Zealand, lived a man, who from time to time remarked
> that he was continually plundered. All his suspicions fell on the
> Troll-folk, who lived in the neighbouring hill of lldshöi
> *(Fire-hill),* and once hid himself to try and get a sight of the
> thief. He had waited there but a very short time when he saw, as he
> thought, his tile-stove jumping across the brook. The good farmer was
> all astonishment at this strange sight, and he shouted out "Hurra!
> there 'a a jump for a tile-stove!" At this exclamation the Troll, who
> was wading through the water with the stove on his head, was so
> frightened that he threw it down, and ran off as hard as he could to
> lldshöi. But in the place where the stove fell, the ground got the
> shape of it, and the place is called Krogbek *(Hook-brook),* and it
> was this that gave rise to the common saying, "That was a jump for a
> tile-stove!"

> "Det var et Spring af em Leerovn!" \[a\]
