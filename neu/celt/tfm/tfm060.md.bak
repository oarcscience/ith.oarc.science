FEROES.

> THE people of the Feroes believe in the same classes of beings as the
> inhabitants of the countries whence their ancestors came.

> They call the Trolls Underground-people, Hollow-men, Foddenskkmaend,
> and Huldefolk. These Trolls used frequently to carry people into their
> hills, and detain them there. Among several other instances, Debes
> \[a\] gives the following one of this practice:

> "Whilst Mr. Taale was priest in Osteröe, it happened that one of his
> hearers was carried away and returned again. At last the said young
> man being to be married, and every thing prepared, and the priest
> being arrived the Saturday before at the parish, the bridegroom was
> carried away; wherefore they sent folks to look after him, but he
> could not be found. The priest desired his friends to have good
> courage, and that he would come again; which he did at last, and
> related that the spirit that led him away was in the shape of a most
> beautiful woman, and very richly dressed, who desired him to forsake
> her whom he was now to marry, and consider how ugly his mistress was
> in comparison of her, and what fine apparel she had. He said also that
> he saw the men that sought after him, and that they went close by him
> but could not see him, and that he heard their calling, and yet could
> not answer them; but that when he would not be persuaded he was again
> left at liberty."

> The people of the Feroes call the Nisses or Brownies Niägruisar, and
> describe them as little creatures with red caps on their heads, that
> bring luck to any place where they take up their abode.

> It is the belief of the people of these islands that every ninth-night
> the seals put off their skins and assume the human form, and dance and
> sport about on the land. After some time, they resume their skins and
> return to the water. The following adventure, it is said, once
> occurred: \[b\]

> "A man happening to pass by where a female seal was disporting herself
> in the form of a woman, found her skin, and took and hid it. When she
> could not find her skin to creep into, she was forced to remain in the
> human form; and as she was fair to look upon, that same man took her
> to wife, had children by her, and lived right happily with her. After
> a long time, the wife found the skin that had been stolen, and could
> not resist the temptation to creep into it, and so she became a seal
> again, and returned to the sea."

> The Neck called Nikar is also an object of popular faith in the
> Feroes. He inhabits the streams and lakes, and takes a delight in
> drowning people.
