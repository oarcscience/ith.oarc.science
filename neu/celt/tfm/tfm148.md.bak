THE BROWNIES

>   
> Two Brownies, man and woman, were attached to the ancient family of
> Tullochgorm, in Strathspey. The former was named Brownie-Clod, from a
> habit he had of flinging clods at passers-by; the latter was called
> Maug Vuluchd *(i.e.,* Hairy Mag), on account of her great quantity of
> hair. She was a capital housekeeper, and used invisibly to lay out the
> table in the neatest and handiest manner. Whatever was called for came
> as if floating through the air. She kept a very strict hand over the
> maids, with whom she was no great favourite, as she reported their
> neglect of duty to their mistress. Brownie-Clod was not so pawky, and
> he was constantly overreached by the servants, with whom he used to
> make contracts. He, however, was too able for them on one occasion. He
> had agreed with two of them to do their whole winter's threshing for
> them, on condition of getting in return an old coat and a Kilmarnock
> hood to which he had taken a fancy. He wrought away manfully, and they
> had nothing to do but lie at their ease on the straw and look on. But
> before the term was expired they laid the coat and hood for him in the
> barn. The moment Brownie laid his eyes upon them he struck work, using
> the words prefixed to this section of our volume.

> Martyn describes the Brownie of the Western Isles as a *tall man,*
> and. he tells a story of his invisibly directing a person, at Sir
> Norman M'Leod's, who was playing at draughts, where to place his men.
