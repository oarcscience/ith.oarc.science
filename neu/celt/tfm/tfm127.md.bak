THE FAIRY RADE

>  

> THE *Fairy Rade,* or procession, was a matter of great importance. It
> took place on the coming in of summer, awl the peasantry, by using the
> precaution of placing a branch of rowan over their door, might safely
> gaze on the cavalcade, as with music sounding, bridles ringing, and
> voices mingling, it pursued its way from place to place. An old woman
> of Nithadale gave the following description of one of these
> processions:

> "In the night afore Roodmass I had trysted with a neebor lass a Scots
> mile frae hame to talk anent buying braws i' the fair. We had nae
> sutten lang aneath the haw-buss till we heard the loud laugh of fowk
> riding, wi' the jingling o' bridles, and the clanking o' hoofs. We
> banged up, thinking they wad owre us. We kent nae but it was drunken
> fowk ridin' to the fair i' the forenight. We glowred roun' and roun',
> and sune saw it was the *Fairie-fowks Rade.* We cowred down till they
> passed by. A beam o' light was dancing owre them mair bonnie than
> moonshine: they were a' wee wee fowk wi' green scarfs on, but ane that
> rade foremost, and that ane was a good deal larger than the lave wi'
> bonnie lang hair, bun' about wi' a strap whilk glinted like stars.
> They rade on braw wee white naigs, wi' unco lang swooping tails, an'
> manes hung wi' whustles that the win' played on. This an' their tongue
> when they sang was like the soun' o' a far awa psalm. Marion an' me
> was in a brade lea fiel', where they came by us; a high hedge o'
> haw-trees keepit them frae gaun through Johnnie Corrie's corn, but
> 'they lap a' owre it like sparrows, and gallopt into a green know
> beyont it. We gaed i' the morning to look at the treddit corn; but the
> fient a hoof mark was there, nor a blade broken."
