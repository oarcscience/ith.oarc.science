SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS

>  

> Brownie has got a cowl and coat,  
> And never more will work a jot.  
> *Stewart*.

> COLONIES of Gothic Fairies, it would appear, early established
> themselves in the Highlands, and almost every Lowland, German, and
> Scandinavian Fairy or Dwarf-tale will there find its fellow. The
> Gaelic Fairies are very handsome in their persons; their usual attire
> is green. They dance and sing, lend and borrow, and they make cloth
> and shoes in an amazingly short space of time. They make their *raids*
> upon the low country, and carry off women and children; they fetch
> midwives to assist at the birth of their children, and mortals have
> spent a night at the fairy revels, and next morning found that the
> night had extended a hundred years. Highland fairies also take the
> diversion of the chase. "One Highlander," says Mc.Culloch, \[a\] "in
> passing a mountain, bears the tramp of horses, the music of the horn,
> and the cheering of the huntsmen; when suddenly a gallant crew of
> thirteen fairy hunters, dressed in green, sweep by him, the silver
> bosses of their bridles jingling in the night breeze."

> The Gael call the Fairies Daoine Shi', \[b\] *(Dheenè Shee)* and their
> habitations Shians, or Tomhans. These are a sort of turrets,
> resembling masses of rock or hillocks. By day they are
> indistinguishable, but at night they are frequently lit up with great
> splendour.

> Brownie, too, 'shows his honest face' in the Highlands; and the
> mischievous water-Kelpie also appears in his equine form, and seeks to
> decoy unwary persons to mount him, that he may plunge with his rider
> into the neighbouring loch or river.

> The Highlanders have nearly the same ideas as their Shetland
> neighbours, respecting the seals.

> The following legends will illustrate what we have stated. \[c\]

> \[a\] Account of the Highlands, etc. iv. 358

> \[b\] *Men of Peace,* perhaps the *Stille-folk,* Still-people, or
> rather, merely Fairy--or Spirit--people.

> \[c\] See Stewart, The Popular Superstitions of thc Highlanders.
> Edinburgh, 1823. As Mr. Stewart's mode of narrating is not the very
> best, we have taken the liberty of re-writing and abridging the
> legends.
