THE DAUGHTER OF PETER DE CABINAM

>  

> IN the bishoprick of Gerunda (*i.e.* Gerona), and the province of
> Catalonia, stands a mountain which the natives call Convagum. It is
> very steep, and on its summit is a lake of dark water, so deep that it
> cannot be fathomed. The abode of the Demons is in this lake; and if a
> stone, or anything else, be thrown into it, there rises from it an
> awful tempest.

> Not far from this mountain, in a village named Junchera, lived a man
> named Peter de Cabinam, who being one day annoyed by the crying of his
> little girl, wished in his anger that the Demons might fetch her away.
> The child instantly vanished--snatched away by invisible hands--and
> was seen no more. Time passed on; and it was seven years after this
> event, when a man belonging to the village, as he was one day rambling
> about the foot of the mountain, met a man weeping bitterly, and
> bewailing his hard fate. On inquiry, he said that he had now been
> seven years in the mountain under the power of the Demons, who
> employed him as a beast of burden. He added, that there was also a
> girl in the mountain, the daughter of Peter de Cabinam of Junchera, a
> servant like himself; but that they were tired of her, and would
> restore her to her father if he came to claim her. When this
> information came to Peter de Cabinam, he forthwith ascended the
> mountain, and going to the edge of the lake, he besought the Demons to
> give him back his child. Like a sudden gust of wind she came, tall in
> stature, but wasted and dirty, her eyes rolling wildly, and her speech
> inarticulate. The father, not knowing what to do with her, applied to
> the Bishop of Gerunda, who took this opportunity of edifying his
> people by exhibiting the girl to them, and warning them against the
> danger of wishing that the Demons had their children. Some time after
> the man also was released, and from him the people learned that at the
> bottom of the lake there was a large palace, with a wide gate, to
> which palace the Demons repaired from all parts of the world, and
> which no one could enter but themselves, and those they brought
> thither. \[a\]
