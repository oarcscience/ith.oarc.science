GREAT source of amusement among the folk was, and still is, at least
among the young, a kind of riddles in rhyme. One characteristic of many
of them is the horrible descriptions they contain, and these
descriptions generally turn out to be something very innocent. The
riddles have in most cases the appearance of being very old.

"There wiz a man of Adam's race,  
Who had a certain dwelling-place,  
It was neither in earth, heaven, nor hell.
