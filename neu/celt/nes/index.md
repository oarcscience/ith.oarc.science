###### Notes on

### The Folk-Lore

###### of the

# North-East of Scotland

## By Walter Gregor

#### \[1881\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an ethnographic study of the inhabitants of the North-Eastern
area of Scotland in the mid-19th century, at a time when an agrarian,
barter economy still prevailed. Life was hard among these remote coastal
communities, and they lived in fear of maleficent witches and the 'Evil
Eye'. Many of the rituals, taboos and folkways in this book are to ward
off witchcraft directed against economic mainstays such as livestock and
fishing. The book has many fascinating bits of lore, as well as
extensive oral poetry, all in Scots dialect. (There is, thankfully, an
extensive glossary at the end, in case *ye're na sure fhat all the
clatterin's aboot*.). There are also detailed descriptions of holidays,
weddings, and other celebrations, which reveal that life was not
completely grim.
