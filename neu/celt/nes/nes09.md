HE child that was born with a caul was said to be successful in
life. <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) The caul, or "silly hoo," was
much prized. It brought success to the possessor, and the smallest part
of it was a sure guard against drowning. Many in emigrant has gone to
the possessor of such a powerful charm, got a nail's breadth of it,
sewed it with all care into what was looked upon as a safe part of the
clothes, and worn it during the voyage, in the full belief that the ship
was safe from wreck, and would have a prosperous voyage.

It was believed that the possessor of the caul could divine from it the
state of health of the one who was born with it. If it was hard and
crisp, the one who was born with it was in health; but, if it was soft
and flabby, the health was weak.

It was a belief in some districts that the doom of the child that came
into the world feet first was to be hanged. A good many years ago a boy
was born in this way in Banff. He grew up a fine lad, but the terrible
idea always haunted the mother, and she was miserable. He fell ill and
died. The mother told

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

my informant how great a relief the death was to her. A load was taken
off her, she said.

The hair on one side of the forehead in some children stands nearly
erect, somewhat in the shape of the marks cattle make on their skins by
licking them. It goes by the name of "the broon coo's lick."

A strong growth of hair on the chest, arms, legs, and hands of a man,
was accounted a sign of strength as well as of a contented mind. Hence
the saw:--

"A hairy man's a happy man,  
A hairy wife's a witch."

To find out if a person is proud. Take a hair of the head and pull it
tightly between the nails of the first finger and thumb. If it curls,
its owner is proud; and the amount of curl it takes is the measure of
pride.

When one's hair was cut, it must be all carefully collected and burned
to prevent it from being used by birds to build their nests. If used for
that purpose headache was the result. <span

The child who had long slender fingers was believed not to have to make
a living by any handicraft or manual toil, but by merchandise, or at the
desk, or by one of the learned professions.

Large hands and feet were looked upon as indications of bodily strength.

"Lucken toes," that is, toes joined by a web, indicated luck.

The man, who has the second and third toes of nearly equal length,
proves unkind to his wife.

White spots on the nails are called "presents." The nearer the spots are
to the points of the nails, the nearer are the gifts. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md)

It was the notion that the marriage ring was put on the ring-finger
because there goes a vein directly from that finger to the heart.

A black speck, sticking to a tooth indicated that the one, on whose
tooth it was, had been telling lies. Such black specks were called
"lies."

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Almost every sensation of the human body was endowed with a meaning.
Ringing in the ears was called the "dead bell." A glow in the ears
indicated that the tongue of calumny was busy. Bite the corner of the
neck-tie, and the calumniator bit the evilspeaking member.

An itching in the eyes indicated tears and sorrow; in the nose, that a
letter was lying in the post-office for you; in the palm of the right
hand, that the hand of a friend was soon to be shaken; in that of the
left, that money was to be received in a short time; in the soles of the
feet, that a journey would shortly be undertaken. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

Sneezing held an important place in the fancy of the folk. Here is the
rhyme about it:--

"Sneeze on Monday; sneeze for a letter.  
Sneeze on Tyesday; something better.  
Sneeze on Wednesday; kiss a stranger.  
Sneeze on Feersday; sneeze for danger.  
Sneeze on Friday; sneeze for sorrow.  
Sneeze on Saiturday; kiss your sweetheart to-morrow." <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md)

### THE DEAF AND DUMB.

The deaf and dumb were looked upon with particular awe. It was believed
that they had the faculty of looking into futurity, and of discovering
what was hidden from their more fortunate fellow-men. This faculty was
given them to make up for the loss they suffered. All, however, had not
the faculty alike. Such as had the repute of seeing into the future and
of penetrating into secret things were consulted by those who wished for
light on any matter that was beyond their ken. If anything was lost and
could not be found, if anything was stolen and the thief could not be
traced out, if any matter was in dependence and the issue anxiously
looked for, the *dummy's* skill was called into requisition. If friends
were absent and had not been heard of for a time, a consultation was
held with the *dummy* whether they were well or ill, whether they were
dead or alive, or

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

whether they would return. Mothers through them read their children's
lot, in life, young women took them into their confidence in their love
affairs, and young men tried to find out what was before them in their
course through life. Wonderful were the stories current, how this young
man was predicted to go abroad, and how he did go; how this young woman
was to be married, and how she did marry accordingly; how this friend
never returned, for the *dummy* always *blew him away*, and shook the
head with a look of sorrow when his return was spoken of; how this one
died, for when consulted by anxious friends about recovery the *dummy*
showed signs of sorrow, scraped a little hole in the earth or in the
ashes on the hearth, put a straw or a chip of wood, or some such thing
into it, and covered it up.

Those of weak intellect were generally treated with tenderness. The
common belief was that the father and mother of such a child would
always have a sufficiency of the good things of time--that it was rather
lucky than unfortunate to have such a child.
