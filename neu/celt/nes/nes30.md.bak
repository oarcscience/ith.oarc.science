HREE knocks were heard at regular intervals of one or two minutes'
duration. <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) They might be heard in
any part of the dwelling-house, on the entrance door, on a table, on the
top of a "bun-bed." Their sound was quite different from any other. It
was dull and heavy, and had something eerie about it. A similar omen was
the "dead-drap." Its sound resembled that of a continued drop of water
falling slowly and regularly from a height, but it was leaden and
hollow. Such sounds were board at any time during night or day. Night,
however, was the usual time when they were heard. They were heard first
by one, and could not be heard by a second without taking hold of the
one that first heard them. This was the case with all the sights and
sounds that prognosticated death, and lasted for any length of time.

The noise of the worm that eats the woodwork of houses, "the chackie
mill," was looked on as presaging a coming death. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md)

Before the death of one of the household there was at times heard during
the night the noise as if something heavy were laid down outside the
door of the dwelling-house. It was the sound of the coffin as it was
laid down outside the door, before it was carried into the house.

A murmur as of many human voices was sometimes heard around the door of
the dwelling-house. It was the harbinger of the murmur of the voices of
those who were to assemble for the funeral.

A picture or a looking-glass falling from the wall portended a death. If
one's portrait fell, death was not far off.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

A death was often made known by the light called a "dead-can’le." It was
seen moving about the house in which the death was to take place, and
along the road by which the corpse was to be carried to the grave. Its
motion was slow and even. The light was pale-bluish, wholly unlike any
made by human art. <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)

A crop more than usually good foreshadowed the death of the goodman, and
went by the name of a "fey-crap."

The common tallow candle in burning often gutters, and the tallow runs
over the edge and down the side of the candle. It soon hardens. When the
flame consumes the candle, at times the little column formed by the
gutter is left standing unconsumed on the edge of the candle. It is
called a "coffin-spehl," and is looked upon with suspicion as portending
a death in the family at no very distant period. <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md)

The apparition of the person that was doomed to die within a short time
was seen wrapped in a winding-sheet, and the higher the winding-sheet
reached up towards the head, the nearer was death. This apparition was
seen during day, and it might show itself to any one, but only to one,
who generally fell into a faint a short time afterwards. If the person
who saw the apparition was alone at the time, the fainting-fit did not
come on till after meeting with others. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md)

Three drops of cold blood falling from the nose was the sure indication
of the death of one very nearly related to the one from whose nose the
blood fell.

It was regarded as an omen of death, either of himself or herself, or of
one nearly related, if one showed more than ordinary joy. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_158.md)

If the sick person did not sneeze, the disease would end in death.
Sneezing was accounted the turning-point towards recovery. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[5](#fn_159.md)

When one fell sick means were at times used to find out whether the
sickness would end in death. Two holes called

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

graves, the one the living, and the other the dead, grave were dug. The
sufferer was laid, without being told which was the living or which was
the dead grave, between the holes. If the patient turned with the face
to the grave designed as the living, there would be recovery; if in the
opposite way, death would follow. The following extract from the Session
Records of the Parish of Cullen (1649) gives a different mode:--

"It was remembered that Marjorie Pulmer, halving a sick child, and
desirous to know if the child sould live or die, digged two or three
graves. On she called the dead grave and another the quick grave, and
desyred a woman (who knew not how the said Marjorie had designed the
graves) to go with the child and putt him in on of the graves for shee
beleved that if the child sould be putt in the quick grave that he would
live, and if in the dead grave he sould die. Therfor the said Marjorie
being accused confessed that she did it out of ignorance be the
information of a woman whom she knew not. Marjorie was debarred from the
Sacrament by order of the Presbytery."

In some districts there was a belief in a sound of a mysterious kind
that was heard before the perpetration of any dreadful crime, as murder.

A murder was committed at Cottertown of Auchanasie, near Keith, on the
11th January, 1797. Here is the tradition:--On the day on which the deed
was done two men, strangers to the district, called at a farmhouse about
three miles from the house in which lived the old folk that were
murdered. The two strangers were suspected of being guilty of the crime.
Shortly before the deed was committed a sound was heard passing along
the road the two men were seen to take in the direction of the place at
which the murder was perpetrated. So loud and extraordinary was the
sound that the people left their houses to see what it was that was
passing. To the amazement of everyone, nothing was to be seen, though it
was moonlight, and moonlight so bright that it aroused attention. Near
neighbours met, and discussed what the sound could be. All believed
something dreadful was to happen, and some proposed to follow the sound.
The more cautious, however, prevailed over the more fiery. One man, of
the name of Newlands, and a man of great courage and strength, was with
the utmost difficulty prevented from following in the wake of the sound.
About the time this discussion was going on, a blaze of fire arose on
the hill of Auchanasie. The foul deed had been accomplished,

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

and the cottage set on fire. By next day all knew of what the mysterious
sound had been the forerunner. <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md)

### DEATH.

When one was apparently struggling hard in the act of dying, or, as it
was expressed, "hid a sair faicht," the "rock" was at times broken above
the head, under the belief that when this was done the dying person's
heart broke, and the struggle ceased. This action may be compared with
the idea contained in the line,

"Clotho collum retinet, Lochesis net, et Atropos occat."

At other times the dying person was removed from the bed, and laid on
the floor of the apartment, as it might happen that there were wild
fowls' feathers in the pillows or bed, at all times a cause of a hard
struggle in death. This notion about wild fowls' feathers did not exist
among some of the fishing population that used the feathers of all kinds
of birds, except those of the pigeon. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161.md)

In the very moment of death all the doors and windows that were capable
of being opened were thrown wide open, to give the departing spirit full
and free egress, lest the evil spirits might intercept it in its
heavenward flight. The Esquimo have the same custom. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162.md)

Immediately on death, a piece of iron, such as a knitting-wire or a
nail, was stuck into whatever meal, butter, cheese, flesh, or whisky
were in the house, to prevent death from entering them. The corruption
of these articles has followed closely on the neglect of this, and the
whisky has been known to become white as milk.

All the milk in the house was poured out on the ground. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_163.md) In some fishing villages all the onions
and butter were cast forth.

The chairs, &c. in the house were sprinkled with water. The clothes of
the dead were also sprinkled with water, and it was the common belief
that they always had a peculiar smell.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

If there was a clock, it was stopped. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) If there was a looking-glass, it was
covered with a white cloth, <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md) as
were also the pictures.

All the hens and the cats <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) were
shut up during the whole time the body was unburied, from the belief
that, if a cat or a hen leaped over it, the person, who was the first to
meet the cat or hen that did so, became blind, not perhaps at the time,
but assuredly before leaving this earth.

The neighbours did not yoke their horses, unless there was a running
stream between the dwellings. In the fishing village of -----, on the
north-east coast of Aberdeenshire, not a single spadeful of earth was
moved within the village during the time the corpse was lying unburied.

When the death took place a messenger was despatched for a wright, who
hastened to the house of death with his "strykin beuird." The body was
washed, and, after being clothed in a home-made linen shirt and
stockings, it was "strykit" on the board brought by the wright, and
covered with a home-made linen sheet. Many a bride laid up in store her
bridal dress, to be made into her winding-sheet, and her bridal linen
and bridal stockings, as well as her husband's, to be put on when life's
journey was ended.

When the eyelids did not close, or if they opened a little after being
closed, an old penny or halfpenny piece was laid over the eyes.

On the breast was placed a saucer or a plate containing a little salt,
to keep the evil spirits away, because they could not come near Christ's
savour of the earth. <span id="fr_167"></span>[4](#fn_167.md)

To prevent swelling in the bowels, any small dish with a little mould
was at times placed on them. If this had been neglected, and swelling
made its appearance, a small green turf was cut, and placed upon it,
when, it is alleged, the swelling immediately disappeared.

A candle or two were kept constantly burning beside the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

body. It has happened that the candle has been overturned and the
grave-clothes set on fire and. the body burned. This took place only in
the case of those who were believed to have possessed during their
lifetime more than human skill and power, which they had obtained at the
price of their souls from the Prince of Evil, or of those whose lives
had been more than ordinarily stained, either openly or secretly. Such
an untoward accident was spoken of in whispers, and was looked on as the
dark omen of the future state.

In one instance, at least, the time of the death was observed:--

"Gehn the gueedeman o’ a teen  
Dee i’ the fou’ o’ the meen,  
His faimily ’ill be rich  
Till the wardle be deen."

 

#### DROWNING.

The bodies of those who were drowned, but not recovered, were supposed
to come to the surface of the water on the ninth day. It was the weight
of the gall that kept the body at the bottom. On the ninth day the
gall-bag broke, and the body, being relieved of the weight,
floated. <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md)

A mode of discovering a body drowned in a stream or river, was to put a
loaf into the water at the spot where the unfortunate fell. The loaf
floated down the stream till it came above the body, when it began to
whirl round and round.

If one committed suicide by drowning, it was believed the body did not
sink. It floated on the surface.

### MURDER.

The opinion prevailed till not very long ago, and even yet lingers, that
in a case of murder, if the murderer touches the corpse, blood flows
from the wounds.

### THE LYKE-WAKE.

The coffin and grave-clothes were made with all becoming speed. When all
were ready, a day and an hour were fixed

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

for the "kistan"--that is, for laying the body in the coffin, and a few
of the most intimate female friends and nearest relatives of the
deceased were invited to attend. At the appointed time they came,
usually dressed in mourning, and assisted in placing the body in the
coffin, and in making suitable preparation for the funeral. The board of
hospitality was spread, when the qualities and deeds of the departed
formed the subject of conversation.

To the other female acquaintances that had not been present at the
"kistan," invitations were sent to come, and take the last look of the
dead--"to see the corpse."

The body was sedulously watched day and night, more particularly,
however, during night. The watching during the night was called "the
lyke" or "the waukan." <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md)

A few of the neighbours met every evening, and performed the kind office
of watchers. One of them at least had to be awake, lest the evil spirits
might come, and put a mark on the body. The time was ordinarily spent in
reading the Scriptures, sometimes by one, and sometimes by another of
the watchers. Some of the passages usually read were the ninety-first
Psalm, the fifteenth chapter of St. John's Gospel, and the fifteenth
chapter of I. Corinthians. Other passages were read besides these. All
conversation was carried on in a suppressed voice.

Sometimes the "waukan" was not so solemn. Practical jokes have been
played upon the timid. Some stout-hearted one placed himself within the
"bun-bed" beside which the dead lay, and, when those on whom the trick
was to be played had entered the house, and taken a seat, he began to
move, at first gently, and then more freely, and at last he spoke,
imitating as far as possible the voice of the dead, to the utter terror
of such as were not in the secret.

There was a plentiful supply of new pipes and tobacco, procured
specially for the occasion, and hence the irreverent sometimes spoke of
the "lyke" as the "tobacco-nicht."

Whisky was also freely given, and in many eases tea, or bread and cheese
with ale were served about midnight.
