N days long ago very little, and many a time no soap was used in
washing. Cow-dung was frequently employed in the scouring and bleaching
of "harn." A thick ley of it was made, and into it the web was first
put. It lay in this mixture for some time. This process was called
"bookin." After being taken from the "book," it was washed as clean as
possible, then boiled, and spread on the grass. It was turned, and
soaked with water day after day till the strong smell of the "book" had
left it, and it had become pretty white and clear. Another ley was made
of the droppings of the poultry, and went by the name of "hen-pen."
Another common detergent was stale urine, "maister."

Once a year, in spring, there was the great yearly washing, when every
piece of dress, every blanket, everything of bedding, and everything of
cloth kind that could be washed, and required washing, were subjected to
a thorough cleansing. A bank near the well, or a spot on the bank of a
neighbouring stream or river or loch, was chosen. A hole was dug in the
earth, and a few large stones were placed at the sides of the hole to
confine the fire, and to serve as a support for the "muckle pot" or the
kettle. A large fire of peat was kindled in this hole, and the pot or
kettle, filled with water, was placed over it. Tubs were standing all
round, some on stools for hand-washing the lighter articles that had to
be washed by the hand, and some on the ground for washing by the feet
the heavier articles, and of such as were more than usually soiled. From
early morning till night the work went on, some busy washing with the
hands, some treading with their feet, some spreading the washed articles
to bleach and dry, watering them, turning

them; and when dried, shaking them, folding them, and storing them up.
Such of the articles as required more than one day to bleach and dry
were left during night. To guard them from thieves a few of the young
folks kept watch and ward, passing the night in song, or in telling
ghost and fairy stories, or in listening to the sweet music of the
fairies if the clothes happened to be near a fairy hillock, for the
fairies were usually kind, and took delight in doing mortals good.

A washing rhyme was:--

"Her it washes oil Monanday  
Gets a’ the ook t’ dry.  
Her it washes on Tyesday  
Is nae far bye.  
Her it washes on Wednesday,  
She is a dainty dame.  
Her it washes on Feersday  
Is muckle t’ the same.  
Her it washes on Friday  
Hiz little skeel indeed,  
Her it washes on Satterday,  
It's jist a dud for need."

In washing, if the soap did not "rise" on the clothes, there was a "fey"
person's clothes in the tub.
