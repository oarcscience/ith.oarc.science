APTISM was administered as early as circumstances would permit, and for
various reasons. Without this sacrament the child was peculiarly exposed
to the danger of being carried off or changed by the fairies. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) It could not be taken out of the house, at
least to any great distance, or into a neighbour's, till it was
baptised. It could not be called by its name till after it was baptised.
It was unlawful to pronounce the name, and no one would have dared to
ask it. <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) At baptism the name was
commonly written on a slip of paper, which was handed to the minister.
Death might come and take away the young one, and if not baptised its
name could not be written in the "Book of Life," and Heaven was closed
against it. Many a mother has been made unhappy by the death of her baby
without baptism; and, if the child fell ill, there was no delay in
sending for the minister to administer the holy rite, even although at a
late hour at night. It was a common belief that in such cases the
minister either "killed or cured." <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md)
There was in undefinable sort of awe about unbaptised infants, as well
as an idea of uncanniness in having them without baptism in the house.

The system of registration has in a great measure put an end this
anxiety for having the child early baptised.

"Oh, Sir," said the wife of a working man to the minister,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

on asking him to baptise her child along with others, whose mothers were
present, "this registration's the warst thing the queentry over saw; it
sud be deen awa wee athegeethir."

"Why?" asked the minister, in astonishment at the woman's words and
earnestness of manner.

"It'll pit oot kirsnin athegeethir. Ye see the craitirs gets thir names,
an we jist think that aneuch, an we're in nae hurry sennin for you."

Baptism was administered sometimes in private and sometimes in public.
The child was dressed in white, and wore a fine cap. It was commonly the
sick-nurse that carried in the infant, handed it to the father, and
received it from him after baptism. On the conclusion of the rite in
private, bread and cheese, with whisky, were set before the guests. It
would have been regarded as an utter want of respect, and unlucky, not
to have partaken of the bread and cheese, and not to have put the glass
with the whisky to the lips. In doing so there were repeated the
words--"Wissin the company's gueede health, an grace an growan to the
bairn." Sometimes, instead of the latter phrase, were substituted the
words, "Fattenan an battenan t’ the bairn." A feast usually followed.

Each guest gave a small gift in money to the child, and the sum so given
was the nurse's fee.

The child must sleep in its baptismal dress.

In sprinkling the water of baptism all care had to be used to keep it
from entering the eyes, as it was believed that the least drop of it
entering the eyes opened them to the seeing of ghosts in the journey of
life.

When the water fell upon the child, unless it cried it was augured that
it would be short-lived, and it is said that, if it did not cry, the
woman who received it from the father handled it roughly, or even
pinched it, to make it utter the desired cry. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

The water was carefully kept for a time--at least eight days--and then
reverentially poured below the foundation of the dwelling-house; or it
was drunk, under the belief that it

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

strengthened the memory. Alongside the basin, with the water needed for
the rite, some, placed bread and a Bible.

If the child was taken to a neighbour's house at a distance, or to
church to be baptised, the woman who carried the child carried also some
bread and cheese, and another of the party was provided with a bottle of
whisky and a *dram glass*. The person first met received bread and
cheese and a *dram*, and usually turned, and walked a short
distance. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) If it was a woman that was
first met, she carried the baby as far as she went. One of the cloths
indispensable to a baby was also carried, and cast away by the road.

If a boy and a girl were to be baptised together, the greatest care was
taken to have the parents so placed that the minister must baptise the
girl first. If there was the least suspicion of the minister reversing
the order, great uneasiness was manifested, and, if he did proceed to
baptise the boy first, the girl was put forward, and when baptised first
a gleam of satisfaction lighted up the faces of the girl's friends. This
procedure was followed under the belief that, if the boy was baptised
before the girl, he left his beard in the water, and the girl got
it. <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)

If it happened that a girl was brought to church to be baptised, and
returned without baptism, she died unmarried.

In returning home a neighbour by the wayside took the party in, and
prepared a dish called in Gaelic *fuarag*. It was made of oatmeal and
cream, or of oatmeal and whisky. Each of the party received a spoonful,
and a small portion was put into the child's month.
