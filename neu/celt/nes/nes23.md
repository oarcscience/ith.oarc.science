# CHAPTER XX.

### ANIMAL AND PLANT SUPERSTITIONS.

## SECTION I.-FOUR-FOOTED BEASTS.

### THE MOLE.

<span id="img_ainit"></span>

|                     |
|---------------------|
| ![A](img/ainit.jpg) |

MOLE burrowing near the foundation of a dwelling-house was looked upon
as an indication that the indwellers were within a short time to change
their abode. If the burrowing was carried round the whole house, or a
considerable part of it, the death of some one of the inmates was looked
upon as not far distant. <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74)

If one take a mole and rub it between the hands till it dies, the power
of healing a woman's festered breast lies ever after in the hands. All
that has to be done is to rub the breast between the hands.

When one is laid in the grave, he is said at times "to be heakenin the
moles." <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75)

### THE CAT.

The cat bore a bad character in every respect. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76)

Cats were believed to have a strong propensity to suck the breath of a
sleeping baby. Such all act was regarded as very dangerous, and was
believed to end in death if it was continued for any length of
time. <span id="fr_77"></span>[4](#fn_77)

A cat dying in the house was a warning of the death of one of the
indwellers.

Few cared to shoot a cat, as it was believed that he who was foolhardy
enough to do so would, within a short time, meet with disaster of some
kind, or prove unfortunate in his ordinary work for a time. It is said
in story that one, who was unwise

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

enough to use his gun against a cat, shortly afterwards nearly cut off
his fingers with a sickle; and that this other one, who was fond of
poaching, for weeks after shooting a cat, did not see a single hare, and
had not a chance of hitting a single bird.

When a family had to remove from one house to another, the cat was
always taken. To have left it was deemed unlucky. It was taken for
another reason--as a protection against disease. Before a member of the
family entered the new abode the cat was thrown into it. If a curse or
disease had been left on the house, the cat became the victim and died,
to the saving of the family's lives.

If a cow or other domestic animal was seized with disease, one mode of
cure was to twist a rope of straw (a *raip*) the contrary way, join the
two ends, and put the diseased animal through the loop along with a cat.
The disease was transferred to the cat, and the animal's life was saved
by the cat dying.

Many counted it unlucky to meet a black cat at any time. And there have
been those who always carried an old iron nail to throw at a black cat
which crossed their path. By this act all evil was warded off.

It was deemed highly unlucky for a bride setting out to be married to
meet a cat.

To meet a cat as the *first fit* was looked upon as indicating the
failure of what was to be undertaken, or foreboding an accident or bad
news within a short time. "To meet the cat in the mornin" is a
proverbial expression addressed to one who has returned from an
unsuccessful mission, or met with a piece of bad fortune during the day.

It was a notion that a male cat, when he jumped, emitted urine, and at
times semen. Hence great care was used to keep male cats at a distance
from food, for another notion was, that, if a cat did chance to jump
over food, the one, who was unfortunate enough to partake of it,
conceived cats.

The following extract shows the prevalence of the opinion:--

"At Botarie, 1st March, 1654.

"The said day, Mr. James Gordon related to the Presbytrie that Jean
Symson, parochiner of Rothemay, fornicatrix with John Wat, a boy of
about fourteen yeirs of age, had come to him, alleadging she had cats in
her bellie, desircing a testificat to physicians in Aberdein for cure,
which he refused; that she had

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

gone, together with her mother, Issobell Crichton, and gotten drinks for
destroying these cats, as she alleadged, and yet, notwithstanding of
all, was now found to be with childe." <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78)

 

The common saying about greedy, selfish, ill-intentioned men or women,
when they were known to do a kind action, was, "They're like the cats,
they nivver dee guide bit oot o’ an ill intention." Of such as had the
audacity and adroitness to stand well in whatever untoward circumstances
they might be placed the saying was, and still is, "They're like the
cats, for they aye licht o’ their feet."

If cats sit by the fire, lick their forepaws, and then rub them over
their ears, face, and whiskers, rain is looked upon as sure within a
short time. The saying is, "It's gyain’ t’ be rain, the cat's washin’
her face." <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79) A cat sneezing indicated
rain. <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80)

Here is a rhyme about a cat and a mouse, which was usually sung to
children; when the last line was sung the singer made a clutch at one of
the children, in imitation of the cat seizing moosie:--

"A cattie at a mill door sat spinnin, spinnin,  
Fin by comes a moosie rinnin, rinnin.  
Says the moosie t’ the cattie,  
'Faht are ye deein, my winsome laidie?'  
'Spinnin a sark t’ my braw new son,'  
Quo’ the cat, quo’ she.  
'Weel may he brook it, my winsome laidie.'  
'If he disna brook it ill, he'll brook it weel,'  
Quo’ the cat, quo’ she.  
'A swypit my hoosie clean the streen, my winsome laidie.'  
'Ye didna sit in’t fool than,'  
Quo’ the cat, quo’ she.  
'An I fan’ a penny in’t, my winsome laidie.'  
'Ye didna wint siller than,'  
Quo’ the cat, quo’ she.  
'An I bocht cheese wee’t, my winsome laidie.'  
'Ye didna wint meht than,'  
Quo’ the cat, quo’ she.  
'An I ate it up my winsome laidie.'  
'So will I eat you.'

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

The cat forms the subject of several rhymes, no doubt from its being so
often a pet of the fireside.

"Ding dong, ding dong,  
Fah’s this it's dead?  
It's puir pussy bauthrons  
O’ a sehr hehd.  
A’ them it kent her,  
Fin she wiz alive,  
Come til her beereal  
Atween four and five."

Another version of the first lines is:--

"Ting, tang, alang."

Here are two more cat-rhymes:--

"'Pussy cat, pussy cat,  
Fahr hae ye been?'  
'I've been t’ London  
Seeing the king.'  
'Pussy cat, pussy cat,  
Faht got ye there?'  
'I got a wee moosie  
Aneth the king's chair."'

"Cheetie puss, cattie puss, meau-au-au,  
Fahr ’ll we gang i’ the sneaw-au-au?  
'We'll gang t’ the boggie, an worry a hoggie,  
An seen we'll get beenies t’ gneaw-au-au.'"

### THE DOG.

It was believed that a dog would not approach a fey person, *i.e.* a
person who was soon to die. When a member of a family was ill, watch was
kept how the dog behaved towards the sick one. The approach of the
animal to the sick one gave good hope of a recovery. A dog howling at
night was the omen of the death of a member of the family, or of one
nearly related to the family, or of some one in the neighbourhood. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81)

The dog had the power of seeing ghosts. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82) Many a time has it happened to the belated
traveller, as he was returning home through some lonely wood, or
crossing some bridge with a deep dark pool below it, that the faithful
dog has come up to his master, and with drooping tail kept close to him,
and neither coaxing nor threats would make him move a step away from his
master's foot; waterkelpie, or an evil spirit was stalking beside.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

If a dog bit one it was a common thing to kill the dog. It was believed
that, if the dog became mad afterwards, the one that was bitten was
seized with hydrophobia.

If a mad dog bit one, the dog was killed at once, the heart taken out,
dried over the fire, ground into powder, and part of the powder given as
a potion. No evil followed from the bite. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83)

The common notion was that a dog never bit an idiot.

A dog licking a wound or running sore was an efficacious remedy.

A dog eating grass prognosticated rain.

When children got into a sulky humour it was commonly said to them, "The
black dog's sittin’ o’ the back o’ yer neck." When a child became cross,
it was often said, "See the black dog ’ll cum doon the lum and bite ye,"
and the nurse began to imitate the barking of a dog. When a child was
going where it ought not to go something like this was said, "Cum back,
or a big dog ’ill take ye."

Without doubt this mode of expression is the same as the one in Germany
and other parts of the Continent about the Roggenwolf and Roggenhund,
and has its origin far back in the olden time.

### THE PORPOISE.

The porpoise, or "louper dog," tumbling with forward motion in the sea,
is supposed to indicate the coming of a breeze. The animal always goes
against the wind.

### THE MOUSE.

A roast mouse was a cure for the whooping-cough and for the jaundice.
Three roasted mice had most effect in bringing about the cure of
whooping-cough. <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84)

### THE FIELD MOUSE.

The field mouse, called "the thraw mouse," running over the foot of a
person, was supposed to produce paralysis in the foot. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[3](#fn_85)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

### THE RAT.

If rats came to a dwelling-house in more than ordinary numbers the
indwellers were soon to remove. The rats had come to "summonce" them
out.

If rats left a dwelling-house of a sudden, some took it as a token that
the death of one of the inmates was at hand. Others regarded such a
thing as a sure indication that the house was to tumble down at no
distant date. Sailors looked upon their departure from a ship as a
forewarning of its speedy wreck.

A rat's head was supposed to be poisonous. Cats in consequence did not
eat it, though they devoured the body.

### THE HARE.

Great aversion was shown towards the hare both by the fishing population
and by the agricultural, except in one instance.

It was into a hare the witch turned herself when she was going forth to
perform any of her evil deeds, such as to steal the milk from a
neighbour's cow. Against such a hare, when running about a
farm-steading, or making her way from the cow-house after accomplishing
her deed of taking the cow's milk to herself, a leaden bullet from a gun
had no effect. She could be hit by nothing but by a crooked sixpence. If
such a hare crossed a sportsman's path, all his skill was baffled in
pursuit of her, and the swiftest of his dogs were soon left far
behind. <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86)

The hare was aware of her power, and would do what she could to annoy
the sportsman. She would disappear for a time, and again suddenly start
up beside him, and then off like the wind in a moment out of his reach.
For hours would she play in this way with man and dogs. She has been
known, however, to have been hit by the crooked sixpence in an unwary
moment. Then she made to her dwelling with all the speed she could, and
well for her if she reached it before the dogs came upon her. When the
sportsman entered the hut he saw the hare enter, instead of finding the
hare that had cost him so many hours'

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

toil, he found an old woman lying panting and bleeding on the bed, and
it was with difficulty he could prevent the dogs from tearing her to
pieces.

To say to a fisherwoman that there was a hare's foot in her creel, or to
say to a fisherman that there was a hare in his boat, aroused great ire,
and called forth strong words. The word "hare" was not pronounced at
sea.

To have thrown a hare, or any part of a hare, into a boat would have
stopped many a fisherman in by-gone days from going to sea; and if any
misfortune had happened, however long afterwards, it was traced up to
the hare. <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87)

A hare crossing the path portended mishap on the journey. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88) To counteract the evil effects of this
untoward event a cross had to be made upon the path, and spit upon.

Harelip was produced by a woman enceinte putting her foot into a hare's
lair. If the woman noticed she had done so, she immediately took two
stones and put them into the lair. The evil effects were averted.

It was accounted very lucky if a hare started from amongst the last cut
piece of grain.

### THE PIG.

The pig was regarded as a kind of unclean animal, although its flesh is
used.

Pigs have from three to five round marks ranged in the shape of a
crescent on the foreleg a little above the ankle. They go by the name of
the "Devil's mark." <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89)

Among some of the fishing population it was accounted very unlucky for a
marriage party to meet a pig.

The men of several of the villages would not pronounce the word "swine"
when they were at sea. It was a word of ill omen.

The bite of a pig was regarded with horror. It was deemed impossible or
next to impossible of cure, and was supposed to produce cancer.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Soup made of fresh pork, or "pork-bree," was looked upon as a sovereign
remedy for many diseases--dyspepsia, consumption, &c.

A mysterious dreaded sort of animal, called "the yird swine," was
believed to live in graveyards, burrowing among the dead bodies and
devouring them.

It was a very common notion that the pig sees the wind. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90)

To signify that an undertaking had failed there was used the proverb,
"The swine hiz gane throw ’t," or "The swine hiz gane throw the kail." A
common saying in some parts of Germany is, "Der Eber geht im Korn." In
other parts, it is said., "Die wilden Schweine sind im Kornfeld."
Professor Manhardt says in his "Roggenwolf" (p. 1), "An vielen Orten
Deutchlands warnt man die kleinen Kinder, sich in ein Kornfeld zu
verlaufen, 'denn es sitze eine wilde Sau, ein wilder Eber darin.'"

### THE HORSE.

In setting out on a journey, to meet a horse as the "first fit" was
accounted a good omen of the success of the journey. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91)

The meeting of a horse by a bridal party as the "first fit" was looked
upon as a sure proof of a happy marriage.

Omens of good or bad luck were drawn from the lamb or foal first seen
during the season. If the animal's head was towards the observer, the
year would bring prosperity, but, if the animal was standing in the
opposite position, misfortune would crown the year.

It was the belief that the horse had the faculty of seeing at night
ghosts and hobgoblins. Many is the time the faithful animal has carried
its master though dangers from waterkelpies and other beings of the
realm of spirits. On such occasions, when the horse reached the
stable-door, and was inspected by the light of the lantern, there was
not a hair but had a drop of sweat hanging from it.

If it was necessary to put to death on a farm a horse from old age, the
skin had to be stripped off; unless this was done, another horse would
soon fall either by disease or accident.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

When a mare foaled inside the stable, the first time the foal left the
stable it was put forth tail foremost to prevent it lying down in the
middle of a ford when crossing. Sometimes the stable door was taken off
the hinges and laid flat on the ground in the doorway, and the foal
pulled over it.

Let a mare's first secundines be taken and buried, and let the spot
under which it lies be searched from time to time till a four-bladed
clover is found. Whoever finds it and eats it has the power of opening
the most intricate lock simply by breathing upon it.

Waterkelpie often took the form of a beautiful black horse. Sometimes he
appeared to the weary belated traveller, and used every art he was
capable of to induce him to mount. If the traveller did so, off started
the animal and ran with the speed of the hurricane to his home, a deep
pool, and plunged into it with his too confiding victim, who perished in
the water.

What was called the "Horse Grace" was in the following words:--

"It's up the brae ca’ me not,  
It's doon the brae ca’ me not,  
It's in fair road spare me not,  
An in the stable forget me not."

Here is the wish of an overwrought horse that lived before the days of
Father Matthew:--

"Oh, gin I wir a brewer's horse,  
Though it wir but half a year,  
I wud turn my hehd faar ma tail sud be,  
An I wud drink oot a’ the beer."

### HOW TO FIND WATER.

One mode of discovering where water was to be found was to keep from
water a mare having a foal, and to tether her on the place where it was
wished to dig for water; the mare, in her desire to quench her thirst,
pawed over the spot under which the spring lay. If she did not paw,
there was no spring within the circuit of her tether. She was removed to
another place and watched. This process of shifting the animal from
place to place was continued till the desired sign was given. Here is a
tradition: The castle of Dundargue, which was built on a headland

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

in the parish of Aberdour, was at one time besieged. The first work of
the besiegers was to cut off the water which ran to the castle from a
well in an adjoining field, and to efface all trace of it. When water
had to be again supplied to the castle, to prevent all fruitless
digging, a mare having a foal, after being deprived of water for a time,
was tethered near the place where the well was known to be; in due
course the thirsty animal pawed the ground right above the well.

### THE ASS.

One cure for the whooping-cough was the following:--The patient was
placed in such a way as to inhale for a time the breath of the ass. The
patient was then passed three times under the belly and over the back of
the ass, and, last of all, taken home through a wood.

To ride for a little upon an ass was another mode of cure for the same
disease.

### THE SHEEP.

The sheep was regarded with particular favour, and treated with
kindness. It was accounted unlucky if the sheep on a farm began to bring
forth stock of various colours; hence the saying:--

"Fin the nout begins t’ fleck and gehr,  
Ye may lat oot the byre mehr and mehr;  
Fin the sheep begins t’ black and brook,  
Ye may tack in the cot at ilky neuk." <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92)

In days not very long ago, when a lamb of black colour was brought forth
in a flock, it was put to death at once; its appearance was the
forerunner of misfortune in some shape to the flockmaster.

Before a coming storm the sheep on the hills are said always to make for
the sheltered spots on the low ground; and when they frisk and dance
like lambs a storm is at hand.

Sleeping among sheep was looked upon as useful in the cure of any
lingering disease; both their breath and the smell that arose from
themselves and excrements had virtue in them to bring about a cure. For
lingering diseases it was looked upon

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

as of good effect to arise early in the morning, and to go into the
byres while they were being cleaned, and if the patient was able to give
help in the cleaning so much the better for a speedy recovery. To follow
the plough and to smell the newly turned up soil was looked upon as very
efficacious in the cure of the same kinds of diseases. It was the odour
of the byre and of the newly turned up soil in which the curative virtue
lay.

A rhyme on the sheep was:--

"Baa, sheepie, baa,  
Fuh mony hoggies hivv ye the day  
A black and a brookit,  
A red and a rookit,  
They hinna been coontit for mony a day."

### CATTLE.

Cattle do not seem to have played any important part in folklore.

When cattle on the pasture stood holding up their heads and snuffing, it
was looked upon as an indication that rain was not far distant.

A bull "boorin" at a man was looked upon as an evidence that the man was
of bad character.

The following rhymes about the cow are still current among some
old-fashioned nurses:--

"Kettie Beardie hid a coo,  
Black and fite aboot the moo;  
Wisna she a dainty coo,  
Dance Kettie Beardie."

"There wiz a piper hid a coo,  
An he hid nocht to give her,  
He took his pipes an played a tune,  
An bad her weel consider.  
The coo considered very weel,  
An gave the piper a penny  
T’ play the same tune ouer again,  
The corn rigs are bonnie.'"

"I've a cherry, I've a chess,  
I've a bonnie blue glaiss;  
I've a dog amo’ the corn  
Blawin’ Willie Buck's horn. <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>  
Willie Buck hid a coo,  
Black and fite aboot the moo,  
They caad her Bell o’ Blinty.  
She lap our the Brig o' Dee  
Like ony cove-o-linty."

----------------------------------

## SECTION II.--BIRDS.

When the water-hen, or any other bird that builds its nest on the banks
of rivers, or streams, or lochs, places its nest high above the usual
level of the water, it was believed that there would be more than the
ordinary fall of rain to cause flood in the stream or loch. The bird was
endowed by the Father who cares for all with this knowledge, so that its
nest might be placed out of the reach of danger.

Most birds were believed to pair on Valentine day, but larks about
Candlemas.

If sea-birds kept flying inland in flocks with much noise it was
regarded as an indication of a coming storm.

If they fly high, a breeze is supposed to be not very distant.

### BIRD RHYMES.

"There wiz a birdie cam t’ Scotland,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle,  
For t’ push its fortune,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle.  
Fin the birdie laid an egg,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle,  
Filthy fa’ the greedy gled  
Eet a’ the birdie's egg,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle."

The following was the version current in and about Macduff:--

"There wiz a birdie cam' t’ Scotland,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle,  
For t’ push its fortune,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle. <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  
An the birdie laid an egg,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle.  
An oot the egg there cam a bird,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle,  
An the birdie flew away,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle,  
An its mother socht it a’ day,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle;  
An she got it in a bog,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle;  
An she lickit it wi’ a scrog,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle;  
An she took the birdie hame,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle;  
An laid it doon upon a stane,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle;  
An pickit oot baith its cen,  
Hodle, dodle, hodle, dodle."

### THE CROW.

The crow was a bird of darkness. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93) He
was always associated with the man skilled in "black airt."

A Morayshire laird had gone to Italy to study "black airt," and had
returned master of it. A night's frost came, and he wished to try his
power. He ordered his coachman to yoke his carriage. The coachman
obeyed, and brought the carriage. The laird ordered the coachman to
drive to a lock near the mansion, and cross it on the ice, with the
strict injunction not to look behind him. He then entered the carriage,
and the coachman knowing his master's power obeyed, made for the loch,
entered on the ice, and drove with fury over it. When the horses'
forefeet touched the opposite bank, curiosity overcame command and
caution, and the coachman looked behind him, and saw a large crow
perched on the roof of the carriage. In the twinkling of an eye the
black bird had vanished, and crash went the hind wheels of the carriage
through the ice; but the coachman urged on the horses, and the horses
pulled stoutly, and the laird was landed safely.

It was a common belief that many sold themselves to the devil in
exchange for some supernatural evil power--the power

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

of causing tempests-the power of the "ill ee"--the power of making
money, &c.

Such a one, or one who was skilled in "black airt," and had practised it
to the hurt of his fellow men, or one who had been guilty of some
terrible deed that had never been brought to light, died amid the roar
of the tempest in the dead of night. If the death night was wild, wilder
yet was the funeral day. Men with difficulty stood against the strength
of the storm. The difficulty was made greater by the weight of the
coffin; for the coffin of such a one was almost too heavy to be borne by
the usual number of bearers--eight. As they were toiling on in silence,
and in much dread, and with many surmisings, suddenly appeared at times,
as is told in story, a crow and a dove, driving quick as the storm-wind
towards the coffin. Which would reach first? Sometime the dove
outstripped the crow. Repentance had come into the dead one's heart
before leaving earth, the cry for forgiveness had gone up to the Father
of all, and had been heard. Heaven after all was the home of the
departed one. Sometimes the crow dashed on before the dove, and with
such force as to break through the coffin lid. The dead one had gone to
the other world with sin unforgiven. The demon of evil was claiming his
own.

A crow alighting on a house indicated that death was hovering over it,
and that it would soon enter, and take away an inmate.

It was thought very unlucky to destroy a rookery. A story is told of a
Buchan proprietor who, for some reason or other, a good many years ago,
destroyed a large rookery near his mansion-house. Since that time, as
the old people say, nothing has thriven. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94)

The act of rooks flying upwards and downwards, and, as it were, tumbling
over each other, was called "cloddin," and was looked upon as the
forerunner of wind.

If rooks perch themselves in rows on the tops of walls or on palings,
rain is believed to be not far distant.

When a flock of rooks kept wheeling and hovering round and round much in
one spot, it was called "a craw's weddan."

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Here are two crow rhymes:--

"The craws killt the pusie, O;  
The craws killt the pusie, O;  
The muckle cat  
Sat doon an grat,  
At the back o’ Johnnie's hoosie, O."

"Craw, craw,  
Yir mither's awa’  
For poother an lead  
T’ shot ye a’ dead."

### THE RAVEN.

A rhyme about the raven was:--

"Pit yir finger in the corbie's hole,  
The corbie's nae at hame;  
The corbie's at the back door  
Pickin at a behn."

At the same time the one who repeated it put the thumb and the
forefinger together, and asked his companion to put his finger into the
opening so formed; if he did so, he got pinched.

A "corbie messenger" was applied to one who had been sent on a message,
but who was slow in returning, or who did not return at all.

In some districts ravens build their nests in the sea-cliffs. If they
make short flights inland, it is taken as an indication of stormy
weather; but, if they make a strong flight inland to a considerable
distance, it is a token of fair weather.

### THE MAGPIE.

The magpie was a bird of good or bad omen, according to circumstances.

If a magpie jumped along the road before the traveller, it was taken as
a sure indication of the success of whatever was on hand. An old man,
now gone for a good many years, used to tell that, when he was thriving
and laying up money, the pyots used to hop along the road before him on
the summer mornings, as he was carting home the winter store of peats.
In other parts of the country to meet a magpie in the morning was
unlucky. <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95)

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

A magpie hopping near the dwelling-house was the unfailing indication of
the coming of good news, particularly from a far country.

In some districts the following was current about the magpie:

"Ane's joy,  
Twa's grief,  
Three's a marriage,  
Four's death." <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96)

To have shot a magpie was the certain way of incurring all manner of
mishaps. <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97)

It was sometimes called the "devil's bird," <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_98) and was believed to have a drop of the
devil's blood in its tongue. It was a common notion that a magpie could
receive the gift of speech by scratching its tongue, and inserting into
the wound a drop of blood from the human tongue.

A proverb is taken from the magpie: "Ye're like the pyot, ye're a' guts
and gyangals." It is applied to a person of slender form and much given
to talking and boasting.

### THE REDBREAST.

The redbreast was regarded with peculiar interest, and was encircled
with a kind of mysterious awe. It was accounted very unlucky to harm a
robin, or to catch one. The robin was always associated with the wren,
and the wren was styled the robin's wife. The following was a common
saying:--

"The robin an the wren  
Is God's cock an hen." <span id="fr_99"></span>[4](#fn_99)

If the redbreast comes near the dwelling-house early in autumn it is
regarded as an indication of an early and a severe winter. The bird
comes where food and shelter are sure.

"Little Robin Redbreast sits on a pole,  
Wiggle-waggle wintin's tail macks him look droll."

"Jeny Vran wiz lyin sick, lyin sick, lyin sick,  
Jany Vran wiz lyin sick upon a mortal time; <span id="page_139">p.
139</span>  
In cam Robin Redbreest, Redbreest, Redbreest,  
In cam Robin Redbreest wi’ sugar saps an wine;

Says, 'Birdie will ye pree this, pree this, pree this?'  
Says, 'Birdie will ye pree this, an' ye'll be birdie mine?'  
'I winna pree’t tho’ I should die, tho’ I should die, tho’ I should
die,  
I winna pree't tho’ I should die, for it cam not in time."'

### THE LARK.

The lark was sometimes called by the name of "the Queen of Heaven's Hen,
and, whatever might have been thought about robbing the nests of other
birds, robbing that of the lark was looked upon as heinous guilt. Hence
the rhymes:--

"Liverockie, liverockie lee,  
Don't herry me,  
Or else y’ill be hangit on a high, high tree,  
Or droont in a deep, deep sea."

"Mailisons, mailisons mehr nor ten  
That hairries the Queen o’ Heaven's hen.  
Blissins, blissins mehr nor thoosans  
That leuks on her eggies an lats them alane."

Another version is:--

"Blissins, blissins ten  
That leuks on my nestie,  
An lats it alane.  
Mailisons, mailisons seven  
That hairries the nest o’ the Queen o’ Heaven."

A weather proverb is drawn from the lark, viz. "As lang’s the liverock
sings afore Can’lemas, it greets aifter’t." <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100) The usual time when the lark begins to
sing is about the 8th of February.

A proverb, spoken to one who is always putting obstacles n the way of
carrying out any plan by suggesting difficulties, is:--"Gehn the lift
wir t’ fa’ an smore the liverocks, fahr wid ye get a hole t’ sheet in
yir hehd." <span id="fr_101"></span>[2](#fn_101) Another proverb
is:--"Live on love, as liverocks diz on ley."

### THE YELLOW-HAMMER.

The yellow-hammer, *yalla-yarlin*, <span id="fr_102"></span>[3](#fn_102)
*yallieckie*, had a very bad

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

name, and was often persecuted Its character is summed up in the
following lines.--

"Half a poddock, half a tead,  
Half a drap a deil's bleed,  
In a May morning."

### THE COCK.

The cock was called a prophet. The crowing on the threshold indicated
the arrival of strangers. <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103)

A cock crowing on the roost before midnight was heard with dread. It was
regarded as an omen of death if, on inspection, it was found that the
bird's feet, comb, and wattles were cold. He was looking towards the
quarter where the death would take place. <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104)

The cock was believed to have the power of seeing evil spirits, the
enemies of man. In many old houses the poultry sat on roosts over the
part of the kitchen where a supply of peats was kept at hand for fuel.
The cock has been seen of a winter evening to come down from his perch,
and close in conflict with an enemy unseen with human eyes, and fight on
the kitchen floor, now backward as if beaten, now forward as if
overcoming his enemy, while the inmates were looking on in silent fear.
At last the foul spirit was beaten off, the cock mounted his roost,
crowed victory, and the household breathed freely and with thankful
hearts. An unseen enemy had been vanquished, and put to flight.

The cock played a considerable part in the cure of epilepsy. One cure
was to bury alive a cock, a black one if he could be got, below the bed
on which the patient slept. <span id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105)
Another cure was the following:--A live cock, the parings of the
patient's nails, a lock of hair, and ashes from the four corners of the
hearth, were buried together in a hole dug on the spot on which the
afflicted first fell smitten by the disease.

When a cock reached the age of seven years he was believed to lay a
small egg, from which issued, if hatched, a most deadly serpent called a
"cockatrix."

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

### THE HEN.

When a farm stocking was dispersed by public auction, the hens were not
sold. It was deemed unlucky to sell the poultry. They were given away to
friends and neighbours.

Hens dying in numbers at a farm was an omen of the cattle dying within a
short time.

The crowing of a hen was an indication of the death of a member of the
family in the course of not a long time. She was put to death at once.
Hence the proverb, "Whis’lin maidens an crawin hens is nae
chancy." <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106)

On no account must eggs be sold after sunset. <span
id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107)

It was a common notion that small short hen-eggs produced female birds,
and long eggs, male birds.

A hen ought to be set on an odd number of eggs; if not, many, if not all
of them, become addled. <span id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_108)

Alone, the seaboard there were goodwives who set their eggs when the
tide was ebbing, so that hen-birds might be produced. Putting the eggs
below the mother when the tide was rising secured male birds. Another
mode of securing hen-birds was for the woman who placed the eggs under
the hen to carry them in her chemise to the hatching-nest. To secure
birds with crests, *tappit* birds, she had to put on a man's hat. That
all the birds might be hatched much about the same time the eggs were
put below the hen all at once, and with the words:--

"A’ in thegeethir,  
A’ oot thegeethir."

Another formula was in the following words:--

"A’ve set a hen wi’ nine eggs;  
Muckle luck amon hir legs.  
Doups an shalls gang ower the sea,  
Cocks an hens come hame t’ me."

The eggs must be put under the hen after sundown. If the eggs were put
under the mother bird before sundown, the chicken came forth blind.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Eggs should not be placed below a hen for hatching during the month of
May. Hence the saying:--

"May chuckens is aye cheepin."

The month of March seems to have been thought the best month for
hatching chickens, from the saying--

"March cocks is aye crawin."

If a hen or duck wandered from the hen-house to lay her eggs, and if she
hatched them afield, it was the belief that, if when found, she and her
brood were taken from the nest and shut up, the brood, at least many of
the birds, would die; but, if they were left in the natural state, they
would thrive and come to maturity.

If one found a wild duck's brood, the ducklings were on no account to be
touched with the hand. Touching the young birds with the hand carried
death with it to them.

It was believed that handling any bird's eggs in the nest made the bird
desert "forhooie" them. The bird had the faculty of knowing that a human
hand had touched them, and she left them rather than hatch young to be
taken away.

If hens and ducks preen themselves with more than usual care, foul
weather is regarded as certain.

### THE DOVE.

The dove was an emblem of all that was good.

A dove flying round and round a person was looked upon as an omen of
death being not far distant, and at the same time a sure proof that the
one so soon to die was going to everlasting happiness.

The dove was used in the cure of disease. Two live doves were taken, and
each was split lengthwise. Fluttering and bleeding, one was put to the
sole of each foot of the patient, and allowed to remain there till next
morning. Then they were taken "atween the sin an the sky," that is, at
the moment of sunrise, to a spot where the dead and the living never
pass, that is, to the top of a rock or precipice, and there left. A cure
was effected. <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109)

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

The heart, liver, and lungs, torn from a live pigeon and thrust down the
throat of an ox, or a cow, or a calf, were supposed to act as a
laxative.

### THE GOLDEN PLOVER.

It was a fancy that the golden plover by its whistling in spring was
giving advice to the farmer:--

"Plew weel, shaave weel, harrow weel."

### THE MOOR-HEN.

The cry of the moor-hen is interpreted as

"Come hame-come hame."

### THE LAPWING.

When the lapwing, "peeweet," "peeseweep," "wallop," kept screaming and
flying around one, he used to call out:--

"Wallopie, wallopie, weet (or weep),  
Harry the nest, an rin awa’ wee’t."

or:--

"Peesweet, peesweet,  
Herry ma nest an awa wee’t"

It was the common notion that the Irish had no goodwill to the lapwing,
as it gave its eggs to Scotland and its dirt to Ireland.

### THE WILD GOOSE.

In spring in some districts the flight of the common wild goose in its
migration was anxiously looked for. The arrival and high flight of the
flock were regarded as indications of fair weather.

A weather rhyme current in Morayshire is--

"Wild geese, wild geese, gangin t’ the sea,  
Good weather it will be.  
Wild geese, wild geese, gangin t’ the hill,  
The weather it will spill."

### THE SWAN.

Of the swan the common saving is that every time it looks at its feet it
mourns. It does so because their black colour detracts from its beauty.

## SECTION III.--REPTILES, FISH, AND INSECTS.

### REPTILES.

#### THE FROG.

If the frogs spawn on the edges of ponds and in ditches that usually dry
up in summer, it is looked upon as the harbinger of a wet summer. On the
other hand if the spawn is all in the deepest parts of the ponds, there
is to be strong drought in summer.

A cure for the red water, a disease in cows, was to thrust a live frog
down the animal's throat. The larger and yellower the frog, the more
certain and speedy was the cure. <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110)

If a frog is caught alive and its eyes licked with the tongue, the power
of curing any eye-disease lies in that tongue. The cure is effected by
licking the diseased eyes.

#### THE TOAD.

The toad was looked upon with loathing. It was believed to have the
power of defending itself by spitting fire, and one would have been very
wary in handling it, lest its ire might be aroused, and it should vomit
forth its poisonous fire.

The toad carried a jewel within its skull according to the common
belief.

The tongue of the toad was of great efficacy in love matters. Whoever
carried the dried tongue of a toad on his breast, could bend any woman
to his will.

### FISHES.

#### THE DOG-FISH.

To cure toothache, catch a dog-fish, take from the living fish a piece
of the backbone, and return the fish to the water. The piece cut from
the fish was dried and carried on the person, or otherwise carefully
stored up. If the fish lived, the dried piece of backbone was an
effectual cure; but, if the fish died, it had no virtue. There were some
who prepared such charms, and gave them to those who stood in need of
them. A certain woman possessed herself of this charm. It proved a
complete cure. She told this to a

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

neighbour who was afflicted with toothache. The neighbour begged that
which had wrought such a deliverance. It was given, and the woman
carefully sewed it into a part of her underclothing, and carried it on
her breast. The toothache was soon cured. But so enamoured of the cure
was the borrower, that she would not give it back to the rightful owner,
though asked again and again to do so.

#### THE EEL.

The skin of an eel tied round the leg or the arm was a specific against
cramp when bathing. <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111)

#### THE HERRING.

When the herring-fishing is not succeeding the fishermen sometimes
perform certain ceremonies to "raise the herring." Several years ago the
following charm was enacted in Buckie:--

A cooper was dressed in a flannel shirt, which was stuck all over with
burs, and carried on a hand-barrow in procession through the village.

It is not many years since the following procession passed through the
streets of Fraserburgh:--

One man, fantastically dressed, headed on horseback the procession. He
was followed by a second man on horseback, who discoursed music on the
bagpipes. Then came, on foot, a third man, carrying a large flag, and
wearing a high-crowned hat, which was hung round with herrings by the
tails. A crowd followed the three, and cheered most heartily.

It is a common saying that a late harvest betokens a late
herring-fishing.

#### THE HADDOCK.

The explanation of the black spots on each shoulder of the haddock is
that they are the marks left by the finger and thumb of Peter when he
opened the fish's mouth to take out the piece of money to pay the tax
for the Temple service for his Master and himself.

The haddock was said to have spoken once, and its words were:--

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

"Roast me an boil me,  
  But dinna burn ma behns,  
Or than I'll be a stranger  
  Aboot yir hearth stehns."

The saying about the spawned haddock, "harrowster," or "kameril," is
that it is not good till it gets three dips in the "May flood."

#### THE FLUKE.

"Said the trout to the fluke,  
Fu diz your moo crook?'  
'My moo was never even  
Since I passt Johnshaven."'

Another version heard on the Moray Firth is:--

"The fitin said to the fluke  
Fait gars your moo crook?"

The answer given is:--

"It crooks because  
A’ threw it at ma midder." <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112)

#### THE SALMON AND THE TROUT.

The salmon and the trout among some of the fishing population were held
in great aversion. The word "salmon" was never pronounced. If there was
occasion to speak of salmon, a circumlocution was used, and it was often
named after the taxman of the fishings nearest the villages, whose
inhabitants shunned pronouncing the name of the fish. Thus it would be
called "So and So's fish." Sometimes it was called "The beast." In some
of the villages along the north-east of Scotland it went by the name of
"The Spey codlin."

In going past a salmon cobble in the harbour, a fisherman would not have
allowed his boat to touch it, neither would he have taken hold of it
either by hand or boat-hook to haul past it.

To have said to a fisherman that there was a salmon in his boat, or to
have spoken to him of salmon on his proceeding to sea, or to have spoken
of salmon or even trout when at sea, aroused his anger and called forth
stormy words.

A trout or a salmon caught in the herring-nets, as it sometimes, though
rarely, happens, was regarded as a most untoward event, and was looked
upon as the harbinger of the failure of the fishing during the rest of
the season.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

### INSECTS.

The burying beetle is called a "cancer," from the belief that its bite
produces that terrible disease.

The lady-bird (*Coccinella septempunctata*), called in some districts
"the king," is addressed in these words

"Kings Doctor Ellison,  
Fahr ill I be mairrt till,  
East or Wast, or Norowa.  
Tack up yir wings and flee awa."

Another version is:--

"Ladybird, Ladybird,  
  Flee awa hame,  
Yir house is on fire  
  An yir bairns alane." <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113)

The ant was called "emerteen," and when on being disturbed it was seen
carrying off its eggs it was supposed to be its horse, and the following
words were repeated:--

"Emerteen, emerteen, laden yir horse,  
Yir father and yir mither is ded in Kinloss."

It was a common opinion that bees did not thrive with those who had led
an unchaste life.

The first swarm of bees of one who intended to be a beekeeper must be
got in some other way than by purchase. A bought swarm led but to
disaster in bee-keeping.

It was a belief that bees in their hive emitted a buzzing sound exactly
at midnight, on the last day of the year; that was the hour of the
Saviour's birth.

Moths were called "witches," and were looked upon with a sort of
undefinable dread, as being very uncanny.

Spiders were regarded with a feeling of kindliness, and one was usually
very loath to kill them. Their webs, very often called "moose webs,"
were a great specific to stop bleeding.

A spider running over any part of the body-clothes indicated a piece of
new dress corresponding to the piece over which the spider was making
its way. <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114)

A small spider makes its nest--a white downy substance--on the stalks of
standing corn. According to the height of the nest from the ground was
to be the depth of snow during winter.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

The green crab (*Carcinas mænas*) is used as bait by the fishermen. Its
real name was never pronounced, especially during the time of putting it
upon the book as bait. In Pittulie, if it had to be named, it was called
"sniffitie fit."

The hair-worm (*Gordius aquaticus*) was believed to be produced from the
hair of a stallion's tail. <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115)

Omens were drawn from the black snail (*Arion* *ater*). If it was seen
the first time during the season on any soft substance, the year would
be prosperous and happy; but, if it was on a hard substance, there was
little but difficulties and trials in the way. <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## SECTION IV.

### TREES AND PLANTS.

The cross is said to have been made of the wood of the aspen--"quaking
aish." Hence the constant motion of the leaves. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117)

The bluebell (*Campanula rotundifolia*) was in parts of Buchan called
"the aul’ man's bell," regarded with a sort of dread, and commonly left
unpulled. In other parts it was called "gowk's thumles."

When the broom and the whin were rich in blossom it was looked upon as
an indication of a good crop.

There existed among many the same opinion regarding the blossom on
turnips growing for seed.

When there was an abundant crop of wild fruits, there was to be a severe
winter. The good Father of all was providing for the "fowls of the air."

When potatoes were dug for the first time during the season, a stem was
put for each member of the family, and omens were drawn of the
prosperity of the year from the number and size of the potatoes growing
at each stem. The father came first, and then the mother, and then each
member followed according to age.

The puff-ball (*Lyeoperdon bovista*) is called "blin’ men's een," and
the dust of it is supposed to cause blindness, if it should by any
chance enter the eyes.
