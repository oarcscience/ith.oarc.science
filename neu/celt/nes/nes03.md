HAVE paidlt in its burns and tumbled on its fairy hillocks. I have
wandered through its woods by day and by night. I have trudged over its
moors and mosses. I have lain below its rocks, dreaming with open eyes
of the past. I have climbed its hills in sunshine and in mist, in calm
and in storm; in fair and in foul, when the tiny stream that flowed down
the hill-side was swollen into a roaring torrent of foam, and "deep was
calling unto deep." I have seated myself on the hill-top, and looked out
on the great sea of hills, billow on billow, with their grey, broken
crests and purple sides streaked with patches of glittering snow, with
many a tarn looking out from below the rugged brows of the hills--eyes
gazing with calm, steadfast gaze to Heaven; with here and there a lake
shining as molten gold, fringed with black from the dark fir wood, with
here and there a stream dancing and sparkling in the sun, now shut out
from view by all intervening hill, now coming into sight round the base
of another; the sea in the distance, calm and grand, glancing in the
summer-sun, beautiful as a child at play, and carrying on its breast
many a brave vessel, round which floated mothers; and wives' and
children's prayers, and lovers' vows, and merchant-men's hopes and
fears; and between the hills and the fair, fruitful fields, and villages
and towns, with all

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

their joys and hopes, with all their earnest endeavour and honest work,
with all their devotion and self-denial, with all their loves and
hatreds, with all their pain and misery. I have seen the sun go down,
and the darkness creep over the lowlands and up the hill-sides, inch by
inch, till only the hill-tops shone in purple splendour for a few
minutes, and they too, then, were clad in darkness, and the stars came
out one by one, larger and brighter than when seen from the plains. I
have stood at midnight on the mountain-top, and heard only the dull
sough of the wind, broken by the bark of the fox or the croak of the
ptarmigan. I have guided my steps over its ridges by the midnight stars.
Wrapped in a plaid, I have crouched beneath a stone on a bed of fresh
heather, and have fallen asleep with the music of a Gaelic song and the
murmur of the streams falling over the mountain side--the one the
counterpart of the other--sounding in my ears. I have sat in the hut
beside a blazing fire, and, amidst the roar of the tempest and the rush
of swollen waters, listened at midnight to tales of witchcraft; of
compacts with the Devil, of fightings with the same dark being, of the
same being blowing to the four winds of Heaven wicked men, with their
hut, their guns, and their dogs; of fair women and infants carried off
by the fairies; of dead-candles, of death-warnings, of ghosts, and of
all the terrible things of the realm of spirits, till an eerie feeling
crept over me, and I began to question with myself whether such tales
might not be true. I have taken my seat beside the reputed witch, in her
dark turf hut, and, with the faint glimmering light of a small candle,
witnessed her perform with her long skinny fingers her incantations. I
have sailed the Firth in boat and in vessel, in sunshine and in storm,
and I have listened to the tales of the fishermen and sailors as the
ship rocked lazily under the falling darkness. The North, with its
hills, and vales, and woods, and rocks, and streams, and lochs, and
sea--with its fairies, and waterkelpies, and ghosts, and
superstitions--with its dialect, and customs, and mariners, has become
part of myself. Everything is changing, and changing faster than ever.
The scream of the railway whistle is scaring away the witch,

and the fairy, and the waterkelpie, and the ghost. To give an account of
the olden time in the North, as seen by myself and as related to me by
the aged, is the task I have set before me. It is true some of what is
related has not yet passed away. If I fall into error, I can only say,
with the Roman comedian,

"Si id est peccatum, peccatum imprudentia’st,"

and with Richard Rolle de Hampole:--

And if any man that es clerk  
Can fynde any errour in this werk,  
I pray hym he do me that favour  
That he wille amende that errour;  
And if men may here any erroure se,  
Or if any defaut in this tretice be,  
I make here a protestacion,  
That I will stand til the correccion  
Of ilka rightwyse lered man,  
That my defaut here correcte can."
