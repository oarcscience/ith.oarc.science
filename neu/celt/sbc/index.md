This long out-of-print book, graciously loaned to sacred-texts for
scanning by a reader from their personal library, reviews the extensive
literature on survivals of pre-Christian beliefs in the Celtic area. It
covers customs from Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, Cornwall and
Brittany, and relates them to other traditional cultures world-wide.
This is a work of scholarship, and cites from authoritative literature,
including many now hard to obtain sources, and several short texts in
the original Gaelic. Among the fascinating topics covered are the evil
eye, *geis* (taboos), doppelgangers, beliefs relating to animals and
shape-shifting, lustration, second-sight, and healing rituals. Of
particular interest is the discussion of pagan elements in the [Carmina
Gadelica](../cg1/index.md).

Production note: Because this book was basically three very long
chapters, each chapter has been arbitrarily broken into somewhat smaller
files. These divisions were not present in the original book. Many
thanks to Peet McKimmie for the loan of the copytext!
