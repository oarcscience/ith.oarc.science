III\. The Earthly Journey (part 3)

It was not right to make a cake of the kind known as *Bonnach
Boise*(adh), *i.e.* a small cake shaped and made on the palm of the
hand, without making a hole in the middle of it. The reason assigned is
that thus the fairies would not be able to take it away if it were so
marked (John Smith, Jun., S. Boisdale). Possibly the origin of the
ceremony is due to the time when certain placenta were used as emblems
in phallic worship (Father Allan).

It was a source of danger to the soul of a warrior if he fell in battle
fasting. Such was the case with one of the Macleans of Lochbuy, in Mull,
known as *Eoghann a chinn bhig*, 'Eoghan of the Little Head,' whose
grave is in Iona. His spirit found no rest and his apparition (taibhse)
has been fabled for 300 years to have been seen: he rides his mettlesome
horse as he did when he fell in battle, in consequence of his having
fought on the fatal day without having broken his fast (*thuit e na
thrasg*). <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_391.md)

The multitude of restrictions are so numerous that it would serve no
purpose to further amplify the above; suffice it to refer to the curious
restrictions

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

on the old Irish kings, derived probably from the earlier ages of the
priest-kings. The sun might not rise at Tara on the King of Ireland in
his bed, with which compare Ossian's advice to his mother; <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_392.md) he was not to alight on a Wednesday at
Magh Breagh, nor traverse Magh Cuilinn after sunset: on Monday after
May-day (*Bealltuine*) he must not go in a ship; the Tuesday after
Samhuin he was not to leave the track of his army upon Ath Maighne. The
King of Leinster was forbidden to do certain acts on Mondays and
Wednesdays. The King of Ulster might not listen to the fluttering of the
birds at Linn Sailech after sunset \[because he had some
bird-ancestor?\]; might not celebrate a certain bull-feast nor drink of
the water of Bo-Neimhidh between two darknesses. The King of Connaught
might not sit on the grave mound of the wife of Maine in harvest time,
nor go on a grey steed in a speckled garment to Dal Chais, nor conclude
a treaty concerning his palace at Cruachan after having made peace at
All-H allows. <span id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_393.md)

Even before the Christian mission had familiarised the Gadhelic tribes
with the Latin *peccatum*, which has become *peacadh*, 'sin,' the
language testifies to burdens which must be inferred to have pressed
heavily if we may judge from the native Gadhelic word *fine*, 'sin': *ar
fine* glossed .i. *ar pectha* in Sanctáin's Hymn, as to which Stokes
thinks cognation with Latin *vieo*, *vi-tium*, Anglo-Saxon *wídl* seems
probable. <span id="fr_395"></span>[3](#fn_394.md) Irish *cean*, *cion*,
means 'transgression,

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

fault, sin.' Another word, *immorbus*, is frequent in the sense of
'trespass, sin, *scandalum*.' <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_395.md) The
magician's spell (*òrtha*, *ubaidh*, *obaidh*, etc.), the wizard's word
(*facal*), the incantation-charm (*eòlas*) of native medicine-men, the
sacrifices (*ìiobairtean*) of Druids were alike impotent and vain, but
were not and could not be abandoned until it was brought home to the
more thoughtful minds that magical ceremonies and incantations did not
really effect the results they were designed to produce. The spirit of
the hymn ascribed to St. Patrick in the energy with which it abandons
the nature-worship, and the spirit of the scathing words of Gildas as to
a blind people that worshipped rivers and stocks and stones could not
become readily diffused among the folk. Nor is it still; the *eòlas* or
charm is resorted to, and in this parish in which I write there lived
quite recently a man who was credited with the ability of stopping a
flow or issue of blood by a spell; and another not long deceased had a
like power ascribed to him in Assynt; while there are still living more
than one in Ross-shire who will transmit this secret as carefully as the
Druid wizards of old, passing it by word of mouth, with necessary
restrictions, from father to daughter, and so forth through a continual
alternation from man to woman, from woman to man. *Eòlas Casga
Fola*, <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_396.md) 'the charm for staunching
blood,' was known in the Isle of Man; Moore gives a charm to staunch the
horse's blood: "Three Maries went to Rome, the spirits of the church

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

stiles and the spirits of the houghs or sea-cliffs (*ny Keimee as ny
Cughtee*), Peter and Paul, a Mary of them said, stand; another Mary of
them said, walk; the other Mary of them said, may this blood stop (or
heal) as the blood stopped which came out of the wounds of Christ: me to
say it and the Son of Mary to fulfil it." Another Manx charm to stop
blood I give in Moore's translation: "Three godly men came from
Rome—Christ, Peter, and Paul. Christ was on the cross, his blood
flowing, and Mary on her knees close by. One took the enchanted one in
his right hand, and Christ drew a cross over him. Three young women came
over the water, one of them said, 'up'; another one said, 'stay'; and
the third one said, 'I will stop the blood of man or woman.' Me to say
it, and Christ to do it, in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the
Holy Ghost." <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_397.md)

The resort to similar charms is by no means quite a thing of the past. I
gave in my *Leabhar nan Gleann* a short charm for toothache which I know
to have been believed in in my own time. The exorciser—a very decent
shepherd—invariably resorted to a wood and made a notch in a tree, which
is a reminiscence of the cult of tree spirits and of the belief in the
tree-soul. And I well recollect a certain *Barbara Ghriogail* (*sic*)
who was possessed of a small crystal pebble which possessed some
magnetic property, as it was often of use in removing things from the
eyes of cattle and of persons. She practised a charm—*Eòlas a’
Chronachaidh*—which I already gave. These are charms for averting evil,
and come

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

under the head of ἀποτροπη, or 'averting'; the Latins personified the
spirits that controlled this process into *Dii averruncii*, the gods
that avert evil.' In the averting ritual water had to be lifted in a
*wooden* ladle at a stream over which the living and the dead passed; it
was not suffered to touch the ground, and when taken up it was done in
the name of the Sacred Trinity; silver coins were put into the ladle and
also a copper coin; the whole was blessed with the sign of the cross,
and according to a ritual of divination it was thought that a
wise-person could tell whether it was a male's or a female's eye that
had been the bewitching agent. Thereafter the patient was sprinkled with
some of the lustral water, and what remained over was dashed against a
huge boulder-stone not likely ever to be moved. Evil was thus
transferred for ever to the stone, and the 'evil eye' was lifted from
off the sufferer. On the other hand, the opposite process could take
place, and a transference of virtue be effected: rites connected with
the biting of the *tearnadh*, or 'afterbirth' (see Ch. I.), may be cited
in illustration; a simple case is that of getting the razor with which a
person well-to-do has committed suicide, which is the magic means of
transferring the luck of the dead to the happy possessor through
'contact '; perhaps one may adduce the possession of a caul—or thin
membrane covering a child's head at birth—which in the Isle of Man and
elsewhere was supposed to be a preventive against shipwreck and
drowning. Similarly in West Ross-shire water drunk from the skull of a
suicide—and a suicide ranks as a criminal—was held to be a cure for
epilepsy; in East

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Inverness-shire it
was held to bring good luck and to be a cure for toothache.

A proper witness for West Ross is the late Rev. Kenneth Macdonald of
Applecross, <span id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_398.md) who states: "Another
cure for epilepsy is a drink from the skull of a suicide. One may be
found in Torridon on the west of Ross-shire still. Two years ago a man
from Shieldaig declared that he used the skull himself for that purpose,
and that he knew where it was kept. They (*i.e.* the suicides) had to be
buried in some hole in a hill out of the sight of the sea. If his grave
could be seen from the sea it was supposed to be enough to drive all
fish from the coast. So strong was this belief that cases are on record
in which the remains of suicides which had been buried by their friends
in their own burying-ground were exhumed by the neighbours and removed
to a spot hidden out of the sight of the sea. And yet by some perversity
of human nature the withered skull of a suicide is supposed to be a
blessing to mankind. It would appear then that the Druid still lives and
competes with the evangelist in some localities. The Druid of the first
century made no secret of his belief that human sacrifices were
acceptable to the gods. Criminals as a rule were used for this purpose.
And if a man was cannibal enough to eat a bit of the victim's flesh, he
by that act rose in the good-will of heaven. He was supposed to have
absorbed into his system so much of the substance of what was
consecrated to God. He was in fact part of the atonement and therefore
had a special claim to the

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

blessings secured. Human sacrifices are now forbidden by the law of
Britain and the druidical Highland worshipper cannot got nearer
participation in the gruesome sacrificial feast than to lick the skull
of one of a class who would have been sacrificed to Apollo had he lived
2000 years ago."

Mr. Macdonald was for many years Free Church minister in Applecross and
his testimony is indisputable. And there is the further witness of an
authentic writer which I may quote: "It was a popular belief among the
old people that a suicide buried within sight of the sea drove away the
herrings for seven years. Any person who came by his or her death in
this way was invariably buried behind the church. I well remember as a
child hearing a discussion about the burial of a woman who 'put herself
aside,' as it is expressed in Gaelic. Her people, who were by way of
being superior to such beliefs, were anxious that she should be buried
in the family grave; but this was not at all relished by the community,
and after a good deal of wrangling she was interred in a remote corner
of the churchyard, well out of sight of the sea.

"More than a generation ago, a certain Englishman, who happened to be
staying in our neighbourhood, committed suicide, and in spite of all
protests he was buried by his relatives in full sight of the Loch. So
indignant were the natives at this violation of their traditions that
one night shortly afterwards, a party of them disinterred him at
midnight, carried the remains away to another churchyard in an inland
parish ten miles away, and there re-buried him. It must have been a very
grim sort of performance;

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

though grimmer still is another rite which to this day is, I am told,
practised *sub rosa* in connection with this self-same person. It is, I
believe, a fact, that the skull of this long-dead Englishman is lying
*perdu* somewhere about the churchyard, its whereabouts being known only
to one or two privileged individuals, and is used by epileptics to drink
out of; a common belief being that if these unfortunates drink out of
the skull of a suicide, the complaint will be cured. Only last summer, a
woman whose son is afflicted in this way, said to me: 'Oh! we have done
everything for him and tried every known cure; we had him prayed for in
church and we even sent down for so and so's skull (mentioning the
Englishman) to see if it would do any good.'" <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_399.md)

A correspondence on this subject, styled "A Torridon Myth," took place
in the *Scotsman* in 1901, I think, and though the minister of the
parish denied both the superstition and the existence of the skull, a
correspondent finally declared that he himself had drunk water from the
skull as a cure for epilepsy. The two points to be noted are (1) that
the suicide is a criminal, (2) that the criminal is a sacrificed victim.
Acting on this belief witches in former ages endeavoured to get portions
of the body of such as were hung on the gallows in order to make potent
charms from them; and in 1591 in Scotland a case was proved against
these witches of having opened graves at the devil's orders and taken
the fingers and toes of the dead "to make ane powder of them, to do evil
withal." In the Middle Ages the Templars were said to have made

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

use of human skulls in their secret rites at midnight; and the early
Celts, if we believe Livy, used the head of an enemy, *i.e.* in their
idea, of a criminal for secret purposes, while the Boii are said to have
used the head as the appropriate vessel out of which to make drink
offerings. A *copan-cinn*, *i.e.* the 'pan' of the skull, I have in my
own time heard spoken of with subdued awe. A man touched with the hand
of one who had been hanged was, in Cornish belief, held to be cured;
pickled and dried such was a 'hand of glory' potent in discovering
treasure. For further cases compare Southey's *Thalaba* and the
*Ingoldsby Legends*. The skulls of slain enemies were coveted trophies
of valour, doubtless because the luck and prowess of the dead were thus
secured. The criminal, too, was slain sacrificially to take the place of
'devoted' persons; and it is likely that it was from personating the
latter class that in most human sacrifices the victims were criminals.
These, as they had not completed their cycle of life—and life was held
to be a constant or complete quantity—had such virtues left which
constituted a 'luck ' to be transmitted. But before the criminal life
was accepted there was the earlier stage of certain ones devoted' to the
god; I think of the ritual of certain Gaulish priestesses on an island
at the mouth of the Loire. No man durst visit this isle of women; it had
a roofed temple, which the women annually unroofed, but it had to be
re-roofed before sunset. Each woman brought on her shoulders a burden of
the roofing materials, and if any one suffered her burden to fall to the
ground she was torn to pieces instantly by her companions and her
mangled

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

remains carried round the temple. See the account in Rhys's *Hibbert
Lectures*, following Strabo. Another account in Pomponius Mela adds the
trait that these perpetual virgins could rouse the sea and wind by their
incantations, turn themselves into whatever animal form they chose, cure
diseases, and were 'devoted' to the services of voyagers only who have
set out on no other errand than to consult them (*Mela*, iii. 6). There
was a witch in Assynt, near Drumbeg, known as *Mór Bhán*, who had a
similar gift of raising wind for becalmed sailors, and her memory is
still fresh among the people. <span id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_400.md) In
the isle of Gigha, too, there was a similar 'witch.' The tabu against
any of the roofing material touching the ground reminds me of the holy
water got from the Willock family in Strathnāin, which lost its virtue
if the bottle containing it were allowed to touch the ground before it
reached the house where it was sprinkled in the ritual of 'averting,' of
*cronachadh* or ἀποτροπή in the widest sense, and the water received its
virtue through the wizard being possessed of the bridle of the
water-horse (*srían an eich uisge*), ultimately the bridle of Manannan,
who had the gift of making himself invisible, as we read at the end of
*Serglige Conculainn*.

A violation of tabu suffices to cause criminality. But I have pointed
out that possession of the razor of a suicide helps to transmit the luck
he would have had if he completed his span of life; and there

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

is the reciprocal or complement to this belief when for the good of a
community the individual possessed of greatest life-power is not
suffered to complete his life-span or end it in weakness. To prevent
this his life is taken from him, and such a ritual act was liable in the
reports of half-informed travellers to assume the appearance of
cannibalism. A current explanation, treated at length in Mannhardt and
in J. G. Frazer's interesting works, is that the divinity or spirit of
vegetation, all-important to the community, was incarnate in chief and
priest and 'rain-king,' and if such persons were allowed to die of
weakness and age the divine power would be lost to the community, which
accordingly marks such persons as 'devoted,' so that at stated periods
they are put to death and their power transmitted untarnished to a
successor. A man (or even animal, with some peoples) could thus be slain
as a god; while, on the other hand, a suicide criminal, or criminal as
such, could readily personate one 'devoted,' and to partake of any part
of his members was to participate in the divine life. A suicide's skull,
as in close touch with an uncompleted luck of life, would be thought of
as imparting divine virtue and be capable of magic transmission by
contact; and by imbibing the brain-particles with the water the
epileptic's minimum of life was put in the way of becoming a maximum or
normal.

Apart from this category, as having no ritual association, I put such
references as I note from Keating, who says that in the reign of
Loingseach there was a famine for three years in Ireland, "so that the
people devoured one another there at this

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

time " <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_401.md) (*go m-bídís na daoine ag
ithe a chéile innte an trath soin*). Not alike is the reference to
Eithne Uathach, daughter of Congain, wife of Criomhthann, son of Eanne
Cinnsealach, King of Leinster, fostered and "fed by the Deise on the
flesh of infants (*is ar fheoil naoidhean do biathadh leis na Déisibh
i*) that she might grow up the more quickly; for a certain druid had
foretold that they would get territory from the man whose wife she would
be." <span id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_402.md) Here there may be a reflex of
the need of keeping the divine life in the tribal representative at its
fullest and highest. It is not ordinary cannibalism, but a ritual act
reflected on as possible for dark thought and for darker practice on the
lines of a dark and revolting belief.

(*c*) *Faith-healing*. Psychic suggestion associated with stones and
wells is very prominent in folk-belief. Thus, when Burns's Highland Mary
(Mary Campbell) fell ill, her friends at Greenock supposed, it is said,
that she had come under the malign power of the evil-eye. To avert this,
seven smooth stones were procured from the junction of two streams.
These were placed in milk, which, after being boiled, was administered,
but without success. There are many still living who have heard mention
at some time or other of a pebble or crystal (*grìogag*) and of
witch-stones (*clachan buitseachd*), to which various virtues were
ascribed in the Highlands.

Sacred stones linked with the cure of human ills are at least as old as
the days of Colum-Cille, so far as written record among the Celts
enables us to infer. In the country of the Picts, says Adamnan, the
saint took a white stone from the river and blessed

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

it for the working of certain cures, saying: "Behold this white pebble
by which God will effect the cure of many diseases among this heathen
nation." The Druid Broichan, foster-father of King Brude, was thereafter
stricken with sickness as punishment for having refused to free a female
slave at Colum-Cille's request. Having repented, he sent a message
expressing his readiness to do so, whereupon Colum-Cille sent two of his
company with the pebble, which he blessed, saying: "If Broichan shall
first promise to set the maiden free, then at once immerse this little
stone in water and let him drink from it, and he shall be instantly
cured; but if he break his vow and refuse to liberate her, he shall die
that instant." The captive was freed, and we read: "The pebble was then
immersed in water, and in a wonderful manner, contrary to the laws of
nature, the stone floated on the water like a nut or an apple, nor, as
if it had been blessed by the holy man, could it be submerged. Broichan
drank from the stone as it floated on the water, and, instantly
returning from the verge of death, recovered his perfect health and
soundness of body. This remarkable pebble, which was afterwards
preserved among the treasures of the king, through the mercy of God
effected the cure of sundry diseases among the people, while it in the
same manner floated while dipped in water. And what is very wonderful,
when this stone was sought for by those sick persons whose term of life
had arrived, it could not be found; thus, on the very day on which King
Brude died, though it was sought for, it could not be found in the place
where it had been previously laid."

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

Such sacred stones or charms were once extensively used: faith in them
is not yet quite extinct. <span id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_403.md)

The Loch mo Nāir stone is egg-shaped, and "it measures two inches in the
long diameter and rather over one and a half inch in the shorter, weighs
exactly four ounces, and has a specific gravity of 2.666, or almost that
of Aberdeen granite. The stone exhibits a beautifully mottled cream and
liver coloured surface, with delicate touches and streaks of pink here
and there on the cream colour." <span id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_404.md)
Gems and crystals early impressed the imaginative faculty, and the
water-rounded pebble of white quartz is associated with early burials so
often, one has remarked, as to point "to an underlying significancy so
highly esteemed as to have rendered it not unfrequently to all
appearance the only relic thought worthy of preservation among the ashes
of the dead." <span id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_405.md)

The tradition as told by Dr. Gregor is: "Once upon a time, in
Strathnaver, there lived a woman who was both poor and old. She was able
to do many wonderful things by the power of a white stone which she
possessed, and which had come to her by inheritance. One of the Gordons
of Strathnaver, having a thing to do, wished to have both her white
stone and the power of it. When he saw that she would not lend it, or
give it up, he determined to seize her and to drown her in a loch. The
man and the woman struggled there for a long

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

time, till he took up a heavy stone with which to kill her. She plunged
into the lake, throwing her magic stone before her, and crying, 'May it
do good to all created things save a Gordon of Strathnaver!' He stoned
her to death in the water, she crying, 'Manaar! Manaar!' (Shame!
Shame!). And the loch is called the Loch of Shame to this day."

The remainder of the account adds that the first Monday in May and
August (old style) were the most popular days for frequenting the loch.
The patient was kept bound and half starved for about a day previous,
and immediately after sunset, on the appointed day, he was taken into
the middle of the loch and there dipped. His wet clothes were then
exchanged for dry ones, and his friends took him home in the full
expectation of a cure. "Belief in the loch's powers was acknowledged
till recently, and is probably still secretly cherished in the
district." <span id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_406.md)

I know this to be the case: a few years ago this method of cure was
tried. Here is an account by an eye-witness:

"At a loch in the district of Strathnaver, county of Sutherland, dipping
in the loch for the purpose of effecting extraordinary cures is stated
to be a matter of periodical occurrence, and the 14th August appears to
have been selected as immediately after the beginning of August in the
old style. The hour was between midnight and one o'clock, and the scene,
as described by our correspondent, was absurd . . . beyond belief,
though not without a

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

touch of weird interest, imparted by the darkness of the night and the
superstitious faith of the people. The impotent, the halt, the lunatic,
and the tender infant were all waiting about midnight for an immersion
in Lochmonaar. The night was calm, the stars countless, and meteors were
occasionally shooting about in all quarters of the heavens above. A
streaky white belt could be observed in the remotest part of the
firmament. Yet with all this the night was dark, so dark that one could
not recognise friend or foe but by close contact and speech. About fifty
persons, all told, were present near one spot, and I believe other parts
of the loch side were similarly occupied, but I cannot vouch for
this—only I heard voices which would lead me so to infer. About twelve
stripped and walked into the loch, performing their ablutions three
times. Those who were not able to act for themselves were assisted, some
of them being led willingly and others by force, for there were cases of
each kind. One young woman, strictly guarded, was an object of great
pity. She raved in a distressing manner, repeating religious phrases,
some of which were very earnest and pathetic. She prayed her guardians
not to immerse her, saying that it was not a communion occasion, and
asking if they could call this righteousness or faithfulness, or if they
could compare the loch and its virtues to the right arm of Christ. These
utterances were enough to move any person hearing them. Poor girl! what
possible good could in immersion do to her? I would have more faith in a
shower-bath applied pretty freely and often to the head. No male, so far
as I could see, denuded

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

himself for a plunge. Whether this was owing to hesitation regarding the
virtues of the water, or whether any of the men were ailing, I could not
ascertain. These gatherings took place twice a year, and are known far
and near to such as put belief in the spell. But the climax of the
absurdity was in paying the loch in sterling coin. Forsooth, the cure
cannot be effected without money cast into the waters! I may add that
the practice of dipping in the loch is said to have been carried on from
time immemorial, and it is alleged that many cures have been effected by
it." <span id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_407.md)

In the *Statistical Account for the Parish of Farr*, written in August,
1834, the Rev. David M‘Kenzie, minister of the parish, notes that
connected with its antiquities he “may mention a few particulars
regarding a loch in Strathnaver, about six miles from the church, to
which superstition has ascribed wonderful healing virtues. The times at
which this loch came to be in repute with the sick cannot now be
ascertained. It must, however, have been at a period of the history of
this country when superstition had a firm hold of the minds of all
classes of the community. The tradition as to the origin of its healing
virtues is briefly as follows:

"A woman, either from Ross-shire or Inverness-shire, came to the heights
of Strathnaver, pretending to cure diseases by means of water into which
she had previously thrown some pebbles, which she carried about with
her. In her progress down the strath, towards the coast, a man in whose
house she lodged

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

wished to possess himself of the pebbles; but, discovering his design,
she escaped, and he pursued. Finding at the loch referred to that she
could not escape her pursuer any longer, she threw the pebbles into the
loch, exclaiming in Gaelic, *Mo nar*, that is, 'shame,' or 'my shame.'
From this exclamation the loch received the name which it still retains,
*Loch-mo-nar*, and the pebbles are supposed to have imparted to it its
healing efficacy. There are only four days in the year on which its
supposed cures can be effected. These are the first Monday (old style)
of February, May, August, and November. During February and November no
one visits it; but in May and August numbers from Sutherland, Caithness,
Ross-shire, and even from Inverness-shire and Orkney, come to this
far-famed loch. The ceremonies through which the patients have to go are
the following: They must all be at the loch side about twelve o'clock at
night. As early on Monday as one or two o'clock in the morning the
patient is to plunge, or to be plunged, three times into the loch; is to
drink of its waters; to throw a piece of coin into it as a kind of
tribute; and must be away from its banks so as to be fairly out of sight
of its waters before the sun rises, else no cure is supposed to be
effected. Whatever credit may be given to such ridiculous ceremonies as
tending in any respect to the restoration of health, while ignorance and
superstition reigned universally in this country, it certainly must
appear extraordinary to intelligent persons that any class of the
community should now have recourse to, and faith in, such practices; but
so it is, that many come from the shires already

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

mentioned, and say they are benefited by these practices. It is,
however, to be observed that those who generally frequent this loch, and
who have found their health improved, on returning home, are persons
afflicted with nervous complaints and disordered imaginations, to whose
health a journey of forty or sixty miles, a plunge into the loch, and
the healthful air of our hills and glens may contribute all the
improvement with which they are generally so much pleased."

One of the three charm-stones purported to have been thrown into *Loch
mo Nāir* was said to have come into the possession of the Lord Reay, who
gave it to an ancestor of Mr. Eric Ross, Golspie, who owned it in 1900,
and whose notes thereanent are as follow: <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_408.md)

*The Witch's Stone*.—". . . This stone, which had been in possession of
the Reay family for generations, was highly esteemed by the country
people, who came from all parts of Sutherland, when their cattle fell
ill, for a small bottle of water, in which the stone had first been
immersed. This water was faithfully administered to the ailing animals.
Lord Reay was so bothered by these visitors that he gave the stone to my
father, who in his turn was often called upon for the magical water. My
father bequeathed the stone to my elder brother, who dying about three
years ago, the ancient stone became my property. I remember well in my
young days the people coming for the water, and their anxious faces as
they watched the stone being put into the bowl of water. It is to be
regretted that

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

no particulars of the early history of the stone are known, except the
fact that it was once the property of a notorious witch. History is
silent also regarding the recovery of the stone from Loch Mon-aar, <span
id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_409.md) how it came into the possession of the
Reay family, and the fate of its fellow-stones. The stone was never
used, except for the purpose already mentioned. If the stone dried
quickly after being taken out of the water, the sick animal would get
well rapidly; but if slowly, it would be a lingering recovery: so the
poor people believed. What the stone was used for in ancient times it is
impossible to know. The loch, however, into which the witch-woman threw
the precious stones was ever afterwards regarded as a place of healing;
and hundreds of people have been known to journey from far to the loch
for the sake of plunging into its dark waters to heal some real or
imaginary ills. The plunge had to be taken at midnight and the bather
out of sight of the loch before the sun rose and shone upon its waters,
or else the charm would fail to work."

By reason of the honorific prefix Mo-, one looks, in the first place,
for the saint's name; as the name of St. Munn, Munda, Gadhelic Munnu,
comes from Mo-Fhindu, so Mo-N-Aar may come from Mo-Fhinn-Bharr, Findbarr
or St. Barr, venerated in Sutherland, and whose name occurs in
Kilmorack, *i.e.* Cill Mo-Bharr-óg, 'the church of my little Barr' (with
the diminutive of endearment), and also' in Barra. The Rev. A. Gunn has
already made this

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

feasible suggestion as to the loch name, but I cannot associate
therewith the parish name Farr, with its short *ă* and thin *r* (*i.e.*
Fa<sup>i</sup>r), which again seems of like origin with the place-name
Far in Inverness-shire, and both apparently Pictish.

But in his legend the St. Bairre of Cork has annexed some of the
attributes of a marine deity; he rides on St. David's horse across the
Irish Sea, and, as Mr. Plummer <span id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_410.md)
points out, his full name Findbharr 'white-crest' points in the same
direction.

My suspicion is that the saint's name led to association with the
ancient goddess Nāir, sometimes termed a *bain-leannán*, or female
sprite. The *Adventures of Crimthann Nia Nāir* is among the list of the
primary tales in the Book of Leinster, and this shows that in the 11th
century it was current among the people. She is the goddess of the
Wonderland, in the same category as Fand, who leaves Manannan her
spouse, an immortal god, from her love for Cuchulain, like Níam, the
bride of Oisin, and like the lady who wooed Connla Ruadh, son of Conn of
The Hundred Battles,—Conn Cetchathach,—to the Sídh. Crimhthann Nia Náir,
Crimhthann, husband or hero of Náir, figures as a high king in Ireland
at the dawn of the Christian era, was a son of Lugaid Sriabderg, Lugaid
of the red-stripes or circlets. This Lugaid was the son of

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

three brothers, Bress, Nar and Lothur; their sister Clothru was his
mother.

Lugaid was united to Clothru, who thus in pre-Christian legend was both
his wife and mother,

The legend of Crimthann Nia Nāir (*i.e.* C. hero of Nāir) is summarised
in the tract known as *Flathiusa h-Erenn*. <span
id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_411.md) The goddess Nāir brought him to an
over-sea land, where he abode for what seemed a month and a half. A
longing seized him to return, and he brought back a chariot entirely
wrought of gold; a chess-board of gold ornamented with three hundred
precious stones; a sword with serpents chased in gold; a shield with
silver reliefs; a spear that caused mortal wounds; a sling of unfailing
cast, two dogs bound by a silver leash valued at three hundred
bondmaids,—things, in short, which point to riches acquired by a journey
to the happy Other-World over sea. Through a fall from his horse he
found his death, 'six weeks after his return to Ireland,'—the usual fate
of the hero who returns among mortals from a visit to the land of the
Immortals, the Ever-Young.

The diminutive form of the name *Nār*, *Nāir*, is *Nārag*, a name I
recollect applied to a woman who was 'touched' with frenzy, and I infer
that this other-world being *Nāir* was a being like Fann, who wrought
the sickness of Cuchulainn, and of whom it is specially said that she
made men mad. In this aspect of her being she was a goddess of death,
whom sick men would seek to propitiate as they longed for a new life and
happiness. Death and Night are

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

closely associated in primitive myth. The rites at Loch mo Nāir, which
invariably took place at night, were to propitiate Death, the spirit of
disease, of evil, of night with terrors dire. This would not exclude a
trace of initiative magic; as the sun dies in the ocean at night and
returns renewed, so by imitating his. bathing and death in the waters a
similar renewal of life might be looked for; nay, if by imitative magic
the bather returned ere the sun arose he procured virtue anew. The
diving into the lake I take to be a remnant of an Other-World journey
across sea, such as meets us in the *Book of Leinster* tale about
Loegaire Liban, where the scene is laid at En-loch or the Lake of Birds.
There the unknown warrior from Mag Mell, the Happy Land, the joyous home
of the dead, seeks mortal aid, and having declared the glories of that
land, he went back into the lake. Thereafter Loegaire dived down into
the lake, and fifty warriors followed him. Later on he returns to bid
his father Crimthann Cass farewell. He would not be touched: "Come not
nigh us," he cried; "we are but come to bid you farewell," and he sang
of the marvels of his new abode to his father:

What a marvel it is, O Crimthann Cass!  
I was master of the blue sword.  
One night of the night of the gods!  
I would not exchange for all thy kingdom. <span
id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_412.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The going at night
into the lake then was some form of obeisance to the Other-World past.
The bathing in Loch mo Nāir, in the waters sacred to the goddess,

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

was like undertaking a visit to the Land of the Dead, the gods' land.

The dead could cure, it may have been thought. O’Davoren's *Glossary*
gives a word Nár as meaning noble (*uasal*), good (*maith*), holy, pure,
which Stokes equates with Greek νήφω, 'to be sober, pure.' But the
goddess Nāir in character reminds of the Greek Νηρεύς, 'a water-nymph,
Nereid.'

Other well-cures of special significance were resorted to. At
Strath-fillan in Pennant's <span id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_413.md) time it
is observed that the saint "is pleased to take under his protection the
disordered in mind; and works wonderful cures, say his votaries, even to
this day. The unhappy lunatics are brought here by their friends, who
first perform the ceremony of the *Deasil*, thrice round a neighbouring
cairn; afterwards offer on it their rags, or a little bunch of heath
tied with worsted; then thrice immerge the patient in a holy pool of the
river, a second *Bethesda*; and, to conclude, leave him fast bound the
whole night in the neighbouring chapel. If in the morning he is found
loose, the saint is supposed to be propitious; for if he continues in
bonds, his cure remains doubtful; but it often happens that death proves
the angel that releases the afflicted, before the morrow, from all the
troubles of this life." Near hand there formerly lived an old woman of
the name Dewar, who was custodian of St. Fillan's *fairche* or
mallet, <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_414.md) which was used to stir the
sacred waters, if not to impart them virtues.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Laird of
Macfarlane tells of a chapel in Appin called Craikwherreellan, as he
spells it, where "there are springs of fresh water, and the opinion of
the wholesomeness of the water draweth many people thither upon St.
Patrick's Day yearlie in hopes of health from disease by drinking
thereof; the town or village of Ardnacloich is hard by, renowned for a
well also, where, they allege, if a person diseased go, if he be to die
he shall find a dead worm therein or a quick one if health be to
follow."

St. Mary's Well at Culloden was visited on the first Sunday of May;
about a dozen years ago or so it was calculated that about two thousand
persons made the pilgrimage. Its waters were held to have the power of
granting under certain conditions the wish of the devotee. Old men are
known to have held that in their early days its waters had distinct
healing powers. It was believed that at mid-night on the first of May
its waters turned into wine for a short time. A visitor some years ago
wrote regarding the ritual:

"At any rate two thousand people visited it last Sunday, and the
observer might extract, as his temperament led him, either ridicule or
much food for thought in noting with how much apparent earnestness—one
could almost say seriousness—the appointed rites were performed by the
majority of the visitors. The procedure to be gone through is this: A
draught of the water is taken, the drinker at the same time registering
a wish or desire for success in some form or another throughout the
coming year. To facilitate the wish a coin of small value is usually
dropped into the water. Yet the

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

rite is not altogether completed. The worshipper who intends to be
thorough ties a piece of cloth—nearly always taken to the well for that
particular purpose—to an adjoining tree as a symbol of the belief that
thereby his cares and troubles for a year at least are left behind him.
How small a price to pay for so great a boon!

SOME OF THE DEVOTEES.

Here come a group of happy boys, all of whom drink solemnly of the
water, no doubt wishes corresponding with their ages and experiences
being the while registered. But, alas! the ceremony is left in some
degree uncompleted, for on examination it is found that no member of the
group possesses a solitary copper. This part of the rule is thereupon
brushed aside. But the tying of pieces of cloth on the tree is strictly
observed, for, besides costing nothing, it gives each boy an opportunity
of indulging in a little tree-climbing, the desire for which is
doubtless inherited from his pre-historic ancestors; and soon
variously-coloured pieces of cloth are floating gaily on the breeze.
Here is another and much more interesting arrival—a young man and a
pretty girl. The girl drops a coin into the well, glancing shyly at her
companion's face the while. . . ."

The same rites as at Loch mo Nāir were observed at the same time of the
year at St. John's Loch, Dunnet, and at St. Trostan's Loch, Papa
Westray. Pagan cultus and Christian superstition we're here blended.

The well at Loch Maree, called after St. Mael Rubha of Abercrossan, has
been often written about.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Most interesting
of all is Pennant's description (1772) of 'the favoured isle of the
saint': "In the midst is a circular dike of stones, with a regular
narrow entrance; the inner part has been used for ages as a burial
place, and is still in use. I suspect the dike to have been originally
Druidical and that the ancient superstition of Paganism had been taken
up by the saint as the readiest method of making a conquest over the
minds of the inhabitants. A stump of a tree is shown as an altar,
probably the memorial of one of stone; but the curiosity of the place is
the well of the saint; of power unspeakable in cases of lunacy. The
patient is brought into the sacred island, is made to kneel before the
altar, where his attendants leave an offering in money, he is then
brought to the well, and sips some of the holy water, a second offering
is made; that done, he is thrice dipped in the lake; and the same
operation is repeated every day for some weeks; and it often happens, by
natural causes, the patient receives relief, of which the saint receives
the credit. I must add that the visitants draw from the state of the
well an omen of the disposition of St. Maree; if his well is full, they
suppose he will be propitious; if not, they proceed in their operations
with fears and doubts; but let the event be what it will, he is held in
high esteem; the common oath of the country is by his name; if a
traveller passes by any of his resting places, they never neglect to
leave an offering; but the saint is so moderate as not to put him to any
expense, a stone, a stick, a bit of rag contents him."

Sacred wells are met with in all countries where a

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Celtic speech has
been spoken. I need not linger over the Holy Wells of Cornwall, <span
id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_415.md) but pass at once to a great shrine of
present-day repute in Wales. It is a special account contributed to *The
Baptist* of November 23, 1905, by Mr. W. Harris of Oxford; I may be
allowed to quote it in full, as it is I believe quite reliable, and of
special interest in this connection:

“It was our privilege a few days ago to pay a visit to Holywell, North
Wales, a place famous among Roman Catholics for its spring of water
known as St. Winefride's Well, which is supposed to possess miraculous
healing power, and I thought perhaps an account of what we saw would
interest *Baptist* readers. 'Traditions ' inform us that somewhere about
the twelfth century a wicked youth

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

made infamous proposals to the maid Winefride, which she rejected. She
was thereupon slain by him, and the head severed from the body. St.
Beuno, on his way home from the church, discovered the remains, placed
the head to the body, and prayed, upon which the maiden rose up.
Immediately there sprang a stream of water from the spot where the head
lay, and from that day to this has not ceased to flow.

“Having arrived at the outer gate (about a half-hour's good walk from
the railway station), upon payment of an entrance fee of twopence we
were admitted to the outer courtyard, and were directed to a doorway in
the crypt of an ancient church. Upon entering, we found ourselves in a
cold, wet, vault-like place, in size perhaps eighteen feet square, in
the centre of which is the well, protected by a strong stone balustrade,
octagonal in design, from the points of which spring eight finely-lined
columns supporting an equally interesting fan-shaped roof. The water is
allowed to accumulate in the well about three feet deep, and is clear as
crystal and icy cold. It just wells' up from the centre of the mud and
stone covered bottom, and is thus forced to the circumference of the
well. Alongside the well is a baptistery of the usual dimensions, with
steps at each end. A richly moulded flying stone arch separates the well
from the baptistery. The only outlet for the water is through the
latter, and then under the floor out into a large swimming-bath in the
courtyard, to which we shall have occasion again to refer; the water
passes down to another swimming-bath. This is under cover, and is called
'the Westminster'

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

bath, and to this bath admission can be gained at all reasonable hours
upon payment of the entrance fee only. The water then passes away to the
rear of the premises, and, by a sluice arrangement, part is conducted to
drive a mill of some kind, while the other part is diverted into St.
Winefride's Brewery!

“But to return to the well and its interesting surroundings. Upon first
gaining entrance to the crypt, we could scarcely believe we were in the
British Isles. During the previous month we had scarcely heard a word of
our mother tongue, having toured to Pwllheli, Carnarvon and the
Snowdonian range, where Welsh is spoken; now we were surrounded by a
number of Italians of both sexes in their gay characteristic attire;
while there was also a goodly number of our own fellow-countrymen and
women speaking with a north-country dialect.

“The walls of the place were well covered with texts of Scripture
appropriately selected; these were interspersed with crutches, etc.,
while in the four corners and on the floor were piles of crutches and
walking sticks, cork boots, bandages, belts, metallic and otherwise,
bearing unmistakable signs of years of wear, dirt and dust. Against the
wall was fitted up an altar, upon which rested a large statue of St.
Winefride in a richly carved and draped canopy. We arrived at the wall
just at noon, and upon asking the meaning of the number of people
present, we ascertained that they were pilgrims from various parts of
the world, who had come to a service which would be held at 12.30. We
estimate that there were four or five hundred people present. Every
available inch of standing room was occupied, and a

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

large number of pilgrims were promenading round the bath in the outer
courtyard.

“Seeing a Catholic priest among them, I went and joined myself unto him.
He, in reply to my request, very readily lent me an ear for a few
moments’ conversation. Said I, 'By happy experience I know that faith in
our Lord Jesus Christ'—here my friend the priest reverently raised his
silk hat and as reverently bowed his head—will tend to the saving of the
soul, but when I look round upon these crutches and other implements my
faith is—' 'Strengthened?' queried the priest. 'Nay, sir, rather it is
staggered.' 'Then,' said a lady, who was standing near, 'surely, if you
were told that an old man, a cripple all his life, had bathed here, was
healed, and had gone away, having no further use for his crutches, you
would believe it.' 'I should believe it,' I replied, 'if I had known the
old man as a cripple, and had known him afterwards as a sound man.'
'Well,' broke in the young priest, 'I must say, seeing is believing.
But,' he added, 'surely all these crutches and sticks should satisfy any
reasonable man of the healing virtue in the waters of this well, but I
admit, if you like, that not all who bathe are healed, but only those
who have faith in the water.'

“As it was on the stroke of 12.30, by mutual consent we crowded into the
crypt for the service, which opened with a hymn accompanied by a
harmonium. The tune, judging by the way it was immediately taken up, was
well known to all except perhaps our two selves; indeed, I do not think
I should be far wrong if I said we were the only

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

persons present who were not Catholics, as the sequence proves. Then
followed a remarkable litany, a copy of which is before me as I write,
and from which I cull a few petitions. After each petition the response
was instantly taken up, and spoken rapidly.

“*Priest*: O blessed St. Winefride,—(*response*) pray for us; O glorious
Virgin and Martyr,—pray for us; O faithful Spouse of Christ,—pray for
us; O sweet comforter of the afflicted,—pray for us; O bright example of
Chastity,—pray for us; O hope and relief of distressed pilgrims,—pray
for us; That all non-Catholics be converted to the Holy Catholic
faith,—pray for us.

“Then followed another hymn and an eloquent address from Psalm cxxi.
first verse. The first part of the sermon was very enjoyable, but as the
preacher proceeded, he somehow took our eyes off the help coming to us
in our need, and sought to fix our gaze ' upon St. Winefride.'

“As I 'retrospect' a little, I can now understand why the preacher's
attention was fixed upon our face. He evidently saw gathered thereon 'a
cloud about the size of a man's hand.' Another hymn and prayer brought
the service to an end. The caretaker then in a loud voice requested 'all
ladies to retire, as the men are about to bathe.' The congregation one
and all, excepting ourselves, filed past the priest as he stood at the
altar, he presenting a 'relic' to be kissed, many persons evidently
requesting to be 'touched' on the shoulder, chest or back. The relic
appeared to be a silver medallion fixed into a wooden disc with handle,
somewhat in shape and size of a quarter-pound butter print.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

“When all, excepting ourselves, had passed out, the priest took his
departure. My companion then left me, and as I happen to belong to the
sterner sex, and desired to be 'in the know,' I, quite unnecessarily,
supported one of the pillars already referred to, while, as the priest
had retired, the caretaker commenced walking rapidly up and down the
room counting his beads and praying at a great speed after this fashion:
'Our Father, which art in Heaven,' etc.

“I now noticed that some half a dozen men, mostly of fine physique, had
gathered around the baptistery. Among them was a man with a shrunken
leg, a blind man, and an Italian boy of about five years with emaciated
legs. He was dipped to the waist by an Italian adult. Each man was
evidently carefully instructed how to act while in the 'bathroom.' Each
in turn descended the steps unaided, submerged himself by stooping,
raised himself to an upright position, then three times kissed the
flying arch I have already referred to, which came just about level with
the mouth; he then left the water, came and knelt on a certain stone in
front of the shrine of St. Winefride, and again descended into the
ice-cold water. This each man did three times in rapid succession,
without a visible shudder or murmur. The only sound breaking the
stillness was that caused by the caretaker at his 'prayers' and beads.
This man was pointed out to me as one who had been stone blind, had
bathed in St. Winefride's Well and had received his sight. The bathers
then proceeded to the next step—viz., to plunge into the swimming bath
in the open courtyard, round which

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

they must wade or swim three times, and it was an act of great merit and
efficacy to dive and kiss a certain stone in the floor of the well. All
the bathers by some means appeared to be familiar with the spot, and all
seemed desirous of giving the stone the kiss. But, alas! while they
doubtless could easily drown in the well, yet 'for love or money' they
could not dive to the bottom. Then followed 'skylarking' unrestrained,
in which one man tried by force to put the other's face into contact
with the stone.

“I find I have omitted to mention that at the close of the sermon a
procession of Italian peasants arrived, bearing lighted candles,
banners, etc., headed by a priest bearing a wreath of hand-made silk
flowers, under a glass dome, the work of the pilgrim band just arrived
and others unable to leave Italy. This he faithfully promised should
ultimately be placed upon St. Winefride's shrine in their beautiful
chapel, though for the present it would remain upon the 'altar' at the
well. During the service I trust we behaved ourselves with becoming
decorum, though during a brief spell of silence I whispered in my
companion's ear the words of Naaman, 'When I bow myself in the house of
Rimmon, the Lord pardon Thy servant in this thing.'

“In the congregation was a beautiful girl of some thirteen summers,
stretched upon a spinal carriage, and certainly, if the human face
indicates the condition of the heart spiritually, that girl 'was not far
from the Kingdom.' We were told that she had been brought to Holywell
the day previous to see if the water would heal her of spinal disease;
that she had been 'dipped' once, and it was hoped that

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'after one or more
dips she would be better.' Our earnest prayer was that this might be so.
Before retiring, the priest came to her carriage and presented the relic
to her lips. She at the same time raised a suspended wrist-charm to be
touched. This she again most affectionately kissed.

"Thus came to an end this never-to-be-forgotten service. Alas, alas!
through lack of faith, or other cause, the blind man did not receive his
sight, the lame man was not able to leave his cork boot behind, the skin
on the legs of the child did not 'become like the flesh of a little
child,' so neither was faith found in him. Then remembered I the words
of the priest, uttered before the service, 'Not all who bathe are
healed, but only those who have faith in the water.'"

At Killin, Perthshire, two springs, Creideag Bheg and Creideag Mhór, had
curative qualities. <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) Children were
dipped in the Lady of Lawers’ Well at Beltane, and sprinkled when the
sun was visible. <span id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_417.md) Immersion in the
Dòchart was resorted to for insanity. <span
id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_418.md)

Of a parallel nature, if on another plane, are the rites associated with
St. Patrick's Purgatory, Lough Derg. A saint specially connected with
the spot is St. Dabheoc, <span id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_419.md) who is
credited with having had a vision there ere he died. It is this saint
who gives his name to the sacred well in Gigha, Argyll, known as *Tobar
Da Bheathag* or *Tobar ath Bheathag*, but

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

correctly written *Tobar Dha Bheoc*, with the accent on the *bhe*
(Bhe-oc). The Gigha well since the time of the Druids has been credited
with special virtues: <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_420.md) if a stone
is taken out of it a great gale of east wind is aroused, which was taken
advantage of when the islanders were given to smuggling, so that
excisemen were kept from the island. Not many years ago a man from the
south end went to the well (which is at the north end) purposing to take
a stone out of it, and have his revenge on the captain of a vessel then
anchored on the Kintyre side of the Sound. He returned, however, without
fulfilling his purpose, having remembered just in time that a nephew of
his was in another vessel in the vicinity. Da Bheoc is an early sixth
century saint commemorated in Gorman's *Martyrology* under January 1.
Loch Derg was of old Loch Geirc or Geirg, and was noted for its cave,
visited by Knight Owen in the Middle Ages for the purpose of washing off
his guilt. Legend has it that St. Patrick, while preaching to the
pagans, miraculously opened up the place of punishment, with its four
fields guarded by fire, ice, serpents, where souls are in torment; its
narrow bridge, its wall bright as glass, its golden gate, its Garden of
Eden, where are the happy souls who had expiated their sins, and were
waiting to be

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

received into the Celestial Paradise. Ere entering, the penitent had to
pass a probation of fifteen days in prayer and fasting; on the
sixteenth, having received the sacrament, he was led in solemn
procession to the gate, which, after the penitent had entered, was
locked, and not opened till the following day. In 1497, on the
representation of a disappointed Dutch monk, who saw no visions, the
cave was destroyed by authority of the Pope as not being the Purgatory
which St. Patrick obtained from God, but the pilgrimages have never
ceased, and are in vogue from 1st June to 15th August, despite a second
destruction in 1632, and an interdict in 1704. Through the work of Henry
of Saltrey, a Benedictine of the middle of the twelfth century, the
legend spread all over Europe, and was later dramatised by Calderon. It
is most likely that long before St. Patrick's day this island was
associated with burial or with death and visions of the entry into the
other world, partly to be inferred from island names like *H-irt*,
*i.e.* Death, the Gadhelic name for St. Kilda; and from Ròcabi and the
Green Island of Highland legend, the Caer Is of Brittany, and other
sources, such as the English versions descriptive of the water and of
the bridge of St. Patrick's Purgatory itself:

Brig o' Dread, and like the Bridge Cinvat of the Avesta and the Bridge
Sirāt of Islam. The Middle Ages lived in contemplation of the other
world, and had many visions of a Divine Comedy long before Dante gave
them eternal literary consummation. In the Vision-literature, of which
much is due to the Celt, the Vision itself, by the aid of Faith, helped
to cleanse the soul. Terror to a certain extent purified. There was a
further basis in practices somewhat similar to the rites of incubation
which still take place in Tenos, in Greece; and of old the
temple-sleep <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_421.md) in the cult of
Asklepios at Epidaurus, where suppliants approached the god by
sacrifices and rites likely to win his favour, and lay down to sleep
awaiting the divine visitation. All such rites had healing and
revelation for their end.

(*d*) *Folk-Medicine*. Only things significant in virtue of their magic
or by reason of their being credited in belief with healing power remain
to be considered. Cures wrought by substances of ascertained physical
properties must be set aside here for lack of space, forerunners though
they be in some instances of later science. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_422.md) Whatever is outside of

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

the usual produces a certain counter-shock on the soul or soul-body:
this psychological fact is not forgotten in folk-medicine. If connected
with what is held to be holy, the mental-contact itself suffices,
although this is strengthened by visible means. In 1849 the people of
Carrick were in the habit of carrying away from the churchyard portions
of the clay of a priest's grave and using it as a cure for several
diseases, and they also boiled the clay from the grave of Father
O’Connor with milk, and drank it. <span id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_423.md)

Things connected with or named after a priest's belongings, such as a
biretta (*currachd sagairt*) or a processional canopy (*puball
beannach*), are used in love-charms, whereby a girl can magically attach
a lover. A sacred girdle is sometimes still worn by pious women who feel
they are soon to add to the number of the faithful. This is to 'sain'
the expected child as well as the mother from all harm, and to attach
all good spiritual powers on her side. Parallel is the magic or wizard
belt of St. Fillan (*sianchrios Fhaolain* <span
id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_424).md), whereby MacUalraig of Lianachan,
Lochaber, tied the Glaistig or water-nymph

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

in front of him on his horse, and swore that he would not let her go
until he showed her before men. In return for her release she promised
to enrich him with cattle and with house; on fulfilling each stipulation
he let the siren (*an t-suire*) go free, and when parting with her he
put the red-hot coulter into her crooked fist, and then she laid on him
the curse of the Fairy-Host and of the Goblins, her wishes being that
his race might "grow as the rushes, wither like the ferns, turn grey in
childhood, die at the zenith of strength." Her imprecation fell short of
wishing that a son might not take his father's place.

If sacred human things had such 'saining' power, how much more
semi-sacred creatures which brought one in contact with the substance of
the god! Epilepsy was held to be curable as follows: "A live snake was
caught and placed in a bottle, which was then filled with pure water and
corked. After standing for a short time, the infusion was given to the
patient, who was kept ignorant of the nature of the drug." <span
id="fr_426"></span>[1](#fn_425.md) To check whooping-cough it was
recommended to hold a live frog over the sufferer's mouth. What is
unusual has magic virtue: King's evil or scrofula could be cured if
water were poured into a basin and applied by the seventh son in a
family of nine—a daughter being the eldest and a daughter being the
youngest, with seven sons between. Also by the seventh son of a seventh
son, although the person concerned is unconscious of the secret of .his
healing gift. Water drunk from a live-horn (*adharc* 

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

*bheò*), or from a spoon or cup made out of horn taken from off a live
animal, had virtue in curing whooping-cough. Another remedy was mare's
milk from an aspen spoon. Fasting-spittle used at early dawn, as also
swine's blood, was used to cure warts, the right hand being placed on
the earth under the left foot (or the reverse, as the case might need)
in name of the Trinity at the time of waning of the moon. Children born
feet first were held to cure epilepsy, and certain charms were used to
transfer the fits from day to night. Against epilepsy a black cock
without a white feather was taken and buried where the patient had the
first fit. A special modification was "the taking of the parings of the
nails of the fingers and toes, binding them up with hemp, with a
sixpence in a piece of paper, on which was written the name of the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. The parcel was then taken, tied
under the wing of a black cock, and buried in a hole dug at the spot
where the first fit occurred, by the oldest God-fearing man of the
district, who must watch and pray all night by the fire, which must not
be let out. Another very universal remedy was drinking water out of the
skull of a suicide at dawn." <span id="fr_427"></span>[1](#fn_426.md)
Serpent-bite was cured by a decoction of water wherein a serpent's head
had been boiled. In Tiree "water taken from the crest of nine waves, and
in which nine stones had been boiled, was an infallible cure for
jaundice. The shirt of the patient, after being dipped in this magic
infusion, is put on wet." <span id="fr_428"></span>[2](#fn_427.md)

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

On the west side of the same island there is a rock with a hole in it,
through which children are passed when suffering from whooping-cough or
other complaints. <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_428.md) "On the point of
Oa, Islay, there is a small arch formed in a huge boulder, which had
been resorted to by invalids for ages. Any person who passed through it
was supposed to have left his malady behind him, whatever it was. The
transit was a cure for all diseases. Within the last twenty years a poor
man carried his sickly wife on his back for miles to give her the
benefit of the charm.

One fact to be observed was that the disease of the last person healed
would stick to the next passing through it unless he got a substitute to
pass before him. Probably a valuable animal of the clean kind was the
original substitute required, but latterly any living creature was
considered sufficient. An old worn-out dog was supposed to be as good as
a first-class ram." <span id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_429.md) The water-vole
(*labhalan*), referred to in *Rob Donn*, is mentioned also by
Pennant: <span id="fr_431"></span>[3](#fn_430.md) "The country-people have
a notion that it is noxious to cattle: they preserve the skin, and as a
cure for their sick beasts give them the water in which it has been
dipt. I believe it to be the same animal which in Sutherland is called
the Water-Mole." The mole itself is held to be an omen of death if it is
perceived as making its runs in the direction of the foundation of

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

a dwelling. The cure may be a sort of counter-magic, just as an ointment
from snakes’ tongue was once used as an antidote to snake-bite, and in
England the herb 'adder's tongue' (*ophioglossum vulgatum*); in the
south they nailed to the byre-door and to field-gates adder-stones,
saucer-shaped pieces of hard blue marl, rounded and perforated in the
centre by the action of water, which was probably the origin of the
*ovum anguinum* of the Gauls, the serpent's egg so phantastically
described by Pliny.

Goats especially were held to be proof against adders, and the minister
of Kirkmichael, Banff, in 1794, quotes <span
id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_431.md) a Gadhelic saying which implies that the
goat eats the serpent or adder: *cleas na goibhr’ ag itheadh na
nathrach*, *i.e.* 'like the goat eating the adder or serpent.' Red
woollen thread which has been 'sained' (*snàithlein*) has various
virtues: in the shape of a cross it may be tied to cows’ tails or put
underneath the milk-pans or over the byre-door to counteract the evil
eye; bound on the hand, if one has sprained a vein, it is held to be a
blessed remedy, and termed *sgochadhfèithe*, *i.e.* a magical 'incision
of the vein.' In some districts the magic thread is thrice passed over a
horn spoon; the ends of the thread are placed together, and the spoon is
thrice passed round the crook, and the sufferer's disease is rightly
named or diagnosed whenever the thread stays on. If one sprains one's
foot a good remedy is to take the crook full of soot, and make the sign
of the cross over the aching part; the chimney-crook is ascribed

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

great virtue. Equally so is the magical operation of turning the heart
in lead (*cridhe-luadhainn*) on behalf of a person suffering from heart
disease. The patient may be resident far away in another glen, but
doubtless has some knowledge that a good friend is 'turning his heart.'
The lead is molten and poured through an iron key taken from the outer
door into a bucket full of cold water. The state of the heart is
diagnosed from the formations made by the liquid lead falling into the
water. Another code requires the patient to be present, and to kneel
near the fire: a sieve is placed on the head, and in the sieve is put a
bowl full of water; into this bowl molten lead is poured through iron
(the finger-hole of scissors suffices). One of the dropping pieces of
lead is thought to take the rough shape of a heart, and the lead has to
be melted over and over until a smooth or 'whole heart' is produced with
no hole in it, whereupon the patient may rest assured that his heart is
whole. <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_432.md) In the ritual of
cow-healing and of turning the evil eye off children, lustral water,
literally silver-water (*būrn* *airgid*), water which has been blessed
in the Triune Name and has had silver coins cast into it, is given to
cow or child as the case may be; a portion must be drunk by the ailing,
a portion sprinkled over them, and the remainder poured over a large
stone that cannot be moved. This stone is a sort of altar.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The evil cannot go
further; it is thought to have passed into the stone. If cracks appear,
the saying is applicable: envy will split the stone (*sgoiltidh farmad
a’ chlach*): this is the properly magical part of the rite; the
religious part is the careful observance of the earlier portion of the
ritual, and the trusting spirit in which one goes about lifting the
water, blessing it and giving it to the sufferer. Similarly, when rags
are placed at wells or on trees and bushes near hand, the real idea is
not that of transferring the disease to the tree or bush, but of taking
the spirit of the place, either of the well or of the tree, to witness,
in evidence of having done one's own part: the deity may then be trusted
to do his. What Carleton, in his *Traits and Stories of the Irish
Peasantry*, puts into the mouth of one of his characters is apposite:
"To St. Columbkill I offer up this button, a bit o’ the waistband o’ my
own breeches, an’ a taste o’ my wife's petticoat, in remembrance of us
havin’ made this holy station; an’ may they rise up in glory to prove it
for us in the last day!" In a similar spirit, if on a different plane,
is the cry of the religious: God is my rock.

Man in his inner life is opposed to negligence of those rites which are
realised as pertaining to his economic and social welfare in the highest
and widest sphere; he in this spirit is strengthened to endure the
further burdens of his pilgrimage.

Evidence of his magic-compelling belief in his spiritual power is seen
in the old Irish custom of fasting in order to obtain justice or legal
redress, to injure an enemy, to obtain a request as if by magic

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

force; <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_433.md) to ward off a plague. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_434.md) The rite has its parallel in the sitting
*dharna* (*sic (dharana)—JBH*) of the Hindoos. The explanation is that
as eating keeps the body in life so fasting is a feigning of death; the
dead-body does not eat. The spirit of Eoghan of Lochbuy cannot rest, for
the warrior fell fasting. <span id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_435.md) Fasting
makes a man more accessible to magic power whereby he may get his wish,
just as it renders the body open to magical transformations; fasting
elevates one on a par with the dead who eat not. Thus a fasting man may
get his 'wish,' which becomes equal to an imprecation, which has
magic-compelling power according to the Highland proverb. <span
id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_436.md) That request or 'entreaty' passes into
'conjuration or exorcism' is shown by the meaning of *geas*, Irish
*geiss*, from a word signifying 'I bid, entreat ': the magic word is
mighty to place one under a prohibition from doing a certain act, which
is tantamount to an obligation to doing another thing. The magic-spell
(Irish *feth fia*: the Highland *fāth-fīthe*) has power to cause
invisibility. The root is \**vet*, 'to say.' <span
id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_437.md) Power centres in the magic word, and
this is the justification of embracing a part of folk-medicine along
with sacrifice. The word makes sacred.

One word in retrospect. Consciously or unconsciously, religious rites
have an implied reference to

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

the supra-sensible; the motives of religion are manifold, and are
inclusive (1) of the power of the word, (2) of the unseen objects of
fear or faith which on the lower plane may be simply demons, (3) of acts
of faith which issue in expiatory offerings. Religion embraces more than
magic. There is felt or implied that some Power exists outside and
beyond the actual words recited. In charms of the older period names of
deities, such as Goibniu and Diancecht, occur. By easy transitions, as
in the case of the pre-Christian Brigit, all <span
id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_438.md) such deities make way for Christian
saints. The lower rites anticipate the higher. The Divine Life is to man
as man is to the Divine Life. There is freedom on both sides. Priority
remains with the greater. It is the higher that gives, it is the lower
that gets. Every giving reveals.

Folk-consciousness thinks in pieces: it gives small answers to great
questions; it never reveals a sovereign content of existence, with its
fullness of labour and sorrow, as well as love and joy. Truth is the
whole. Celtic, like other folk-consciousness, betrays a longing after
messages and signs of the will and favour of God. Its holy or *naomh*,
Old Irish *nōib*, has its nearest cognate in the Old Persian *naiba*,
'beautiful.' Holiness in its spiritual depths and inwardness is a
product of Christian associations. Non-Christian folk-consciousness is
'yet without strength'; <span id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_439.md) it does
not know God as Holy. In Christianity alone is God seen as giving up
Himself without giving up His Love.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[324:1](sbc10.htm#fr_416.md) The Cornish Well of
St. Keyne has a unique fame. Its water is gifted with the marvellous
property that whoever first drinks of it after marriage will be ruler in
the household. The poet Southey was so struck with this well when on his
visit to Cornwall, that he afterwards celebrated its virtues in the poem
beginning:

A well there is in the west country,  
And a clearer one never was seen.  
There is not a wife in the west country,  
But has heard of the Well of St. Keyne.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The conduct of
some of these wells is truly unique. Take for instance the spirited
behaviour attributed to the basin which catches the water as it issues
from the spring at St. Nun's Well, Pelynt, near Looe. Here is the
legend: A farmer once wishing to use this basin as a trough in a pig-sty
attempted to move it by means of a team of oxen. At first it resisted
every effort made to dislodge it. At length, however, he succeeded in
dragging it from its place. But just as it was nearing the top of the
hill it burst the chains that were holding it, and started to roll
rapidly down again. Finally, when abreast of the well, it made a sharp
turn and rolled straight in at the entrance, retaking its old position,
where it remains to this day. The oxen then fell dead, and the farmer
was struck both lame and speechless.
