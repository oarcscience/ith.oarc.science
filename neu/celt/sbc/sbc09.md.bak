III\. The Earthly Journey (part 2)

The rites that unite the human with the divine embrace all forms of
partaking in thankfulness in common with the divine as it is recognised;
the giving to get; the giving to appease. Here account has to be taken
of commensality, or, in other words, of primitive pagan eucharists. To
my mind, the earliest thought is that of partaking of food in common
with the divine. A very careful person I have known would never have
food served to others or partaken of without adding: "May God have as
much of his own." <span id="fr_324"></span>[2](#fn_323.md) And just as it
was held highly unlucky for a boy to sweep the floor after a death, some
would not have the floor swept after food was cooked or partaken of. The
fragments that fell on the floor belonged to the household spirit or
*sìthich*, *i.e.* the 'fairy.' Close upon the thought to be inferred
therefrom is that embraced by all forms of libation. Of old it was
common enough to pour a milk libation on the fairy-knoll. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[3](#fn_324.md) In the eighteenth century the Rev.
Donald MacQueen, minister of Kilmuir, Skye, contributed some account of
the *Gruagach* to *Pennant's Tour*. After some references to the
classics, he adds that "the superstition or warm imagination of ignorant
people introduced him

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

as a sportive salutary guest into several families, in which he played
many entertaining tricks, and then disappeared. It is a little more than
a century ago since he hath been supposed to have got an honest man's
daughter with child, at Shulista, near to Duntulme, the seat of the
family of Macdonald: though it is more probable that one of the great
man's retinue did that business for him. But though the Gruagach offers
himself to every one's fancy as a handsome man, with fair tresses, his
emblems, which are in almost every village, are no other than rude
unpolished stones of different figures just as they seemed cast up to
the hand of the Druid who consecrated them. Carving was not introduced
into the Hebrides; and though it had, such of the unformed images as
were preserved would for their antiquity be reverenced, in presence of
any attempts in the modern arts.

"The Gruagach Stones, as far as tradition can inform us, were only
honoured with libations of milk, from the hands of the dairy maid, which
were offered to Gruagach upon the Sunday, for the preservation of the
cattle on the ensuing week. From this custom Apollo seems to have
derived the epithet Galaxius. This was one of the sober offerings that
well became a poor or frugal people, who had neither wine nor oil to
bestow; by which they recommended their only stock and subsistence to
their favourite Divinity, whom they had always in their eye and whose
blessings they enjoyed every day. . . . The idol stones that remain with
us are oblong square altars of rough stone, that lie within the Druids’
Houses, as we call them. Observe also,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

that the worship of the sun seems to have continued in England until
King Canute's time, by a law of his, which prohibits that, with other
idolatrous practices." Martin corroborates this of the island of Valay,
where "there is a flat thick stone call’d Brownie's Stone, upon which
the ancient inhabitants offered a cow's milk every Sunday, but this
custom is now quite abolish’d."

The old custom of libation is clearly seen in the following: "Clanranald
used to have a summer shieling on one of the islets off Benbecula. He
had a herd and a milkmaid there. They were both of them Catholics, and
at the time of changing residence were in the habit of spilling a coggie
of milk on the fairy-knoll. The dairy maid left Clanranald's service,
and in her stead he engaged a Protestant. On the day of changing from
the shieling the herd requested that milk might be left on the knoll.
She replied: 'No! I don't heed Popish incantations.' That same night the
best cow in the fold was dead, and on the morrow it was blood and not
milk that the cows gave. Clanranald sent away the new dairy maid, and he
took back the maid who had formerly left his service to take her place.
They never heard any further mishap." This on the authority of an old
shepherd, whose grandfather, he said, was the herd in question.

The sea-god Shony, according to Martin, <span
id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_325.md) "had libations offered him in Lewis at
Hallowtide: they gathered to the Church of St. Mulvay, Lewis: each
family furnished a peck of malt, and this was brew’d into ale: one of
their number was picked out to

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

wade into the sea up to the middle, and carrying a cup of ale in his
hand, standing still in that posture, cry’d out with a loud voice,
saying: *Shony, I give you this cup of ale, hoping that you'll be so
kind as to send us plenty of sea-ware, for enriching our ground the
ensuing year*, and so threw the cup of ale into the sea. This was
performed in the night time. At his return to land they all went to
church; there was a candle burning upon the altar; and then, standing
silent for a little time, one of them gave a signal at which the candle
was put out, and immediately all of them went to the fields, where they
fell a-drinking their ale, and spent the remainder of the night in
dancing and singing."

Of immemorial antiquity is another rite referred to by Martin: "They
have a general cavalcade on All Saints’ Day, and then they bake St.
Michael's Cake at night, and the family and strangers eat it at
supper" <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_326) (South Uist.md). For Barra he
says: "Every family, as soon as the solemnity (the cavalcade) is ended,
is accustomed to bake St. Michael's Cake, as above described; and all
strangers, together with those of the family, must eat the bread that
night." <span id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) It is met with likewise in
Ross-shire: "Perhaps one of the quaintest of old-world customs which
still survives in some out-of-the-way places is the preparation of the
*Struan Michael*, or cakes sacred to the celebration of Michaelmas Day.
It is more peculiarly a Hebridean custom, and, though fast dying out, it
is not unknown, and last autumn I tasted some. Michaelmas Day was always
observed

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

in the Celtic Calendar, and *Struan Michaels* and Beltane Bannocks
entered as much into the calculations of the Highland housewife as do
Shrove-tide cakes and hot-cross-buns elsewhere. They were prepared
somewhat after this fashion. The first sheaves of the harvest were
taken, dried and ground into meal with the quern. Then the housewife
took some eggs, butter and treacle, mixed them up, and into the mixture
put the new meal, making a dough. On the stone slab forming her
hearth-stone she put some red-hot peats, and when sufficiently heated,
swept it clean. On this the dough was placed to cook with an inverted
pot over it. During the process of cooking, it was often basted with
beaten eggs, forming a custard-like covering. Finally, after the cake
was cooked, a small piece was broken off and cast into the fire. Why?
you will ask. Well, as an offering to the *Donas*, or old Hornie, or
whatever may be the correct designation of that presiding genius whom we
are led to believe inhabits the fiery regions. The housewife did this in
order to safeguard herself and her household against the Evil One. After
reserving some of the *Struan* for the use of the household, she went
round the neighbours in triumph and gave them a bit each, there being
usually a great rivalry as to who should be the first to grind the new
meal and get the *Struan* ready. The first to do so was generally
understood to have the best crops through the corning year." <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_328.md)

Offerings to Michael are clearly referred to in the

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Isle of Eriskay
rite, that when a person is paring his nails and having his hair cut, he
should say: "My hair and my nails be with *Nigh’ Mhìcheil* for my soul's
welfare" (m’fhalt is m’iongnan aig Nigh’ Mhìcheil, air rath m’anmanna).
The Rev. Allan Macdonald, priest of the island, had the phrase from the
late Duncan M‘Innes, Ru Bàn, Eriskay, and distinctly noticed "that the
pronunciation was not Naomh Mìcheil, 'St. Michael,' but '*nigh*
Mhicheil' (*i.e.* daughter of Michael?), whosoever she may have been."
But I have little doubt but the pronunciation with the *i* was a variant
well-known elsewhere for the high-back vowel *ao*.

The idea of offering clearly appears in the action of fishermen, who,
when they thought they saw a mermaid, threw overboard any fish that they
might have in order to propitiate her, inasmuch as her appearance was
held to portend foul weather. A parallel idea comes out in the old
custom once observed on entering a new house for the first time of
throwing something into the house before one, saying *slàn treabhaidh an
so*, equivalent to invoking a blessing on the abode. I well remember old
people who on no account would enter a house, particularly when the
family were at meal, without exclaiming: "Blessing be before me!" <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) A practice the opposite of this was the
putting of a dead creature, such as a crow, on the hearth of a house to
which another family was flitting. This I have seen in the Highlands, as
well as the new tenant go round his fields with 'blessed' water,
sprinkling alike boundaries and cattle in a manner that reminded of
customs met

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

with in old Italian rites. <span id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_330.md)
Offerings also were the coins thrown into wells, as also the twigs of
heather cast into them or near them. This leads to the idea, of
propitiation. The idea of *do ut abeas*, 'I give that thou mayest be
gone,' is manifest in the Uist ritual of the St. Michael's Cake. <span
id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_331.md) A bit of dough is taken from off the
baking-board and placed on the embers, where it is burnt. It is called
the Devil's Tithe, the Evil One's portion, and such names. The bit of
dough, when burnt, is thrown over the left shoulder, the operant saying:
"Here to thee, thou rascal \[Devil\], and stay behind me, stay from my
kine!" The cake may be baked for the prosperity (*air sealbhaich*) of
the house, of the household, or of any individual member.

Keating <span id="fr_333"></span>[3](#fn_332.md) inserts a story which
tells how St. Patrick restored Lughaidh, son of King Laoghaire, to life.
Michael the Archangel, in form of a bird, put his bill into the lad's
throat, and took out the morsel which choked the king's son. "When the
queen heard that it was Michael the Archangel who brought back her son
to life, she bound herself to give a sheep out of every flock she
possessed each year, and a portion of every meal she should take during
her life, to the poor of God, in honour of Michael the Archangel; and,
moreover, she enjoined this as a custom throughout Ireland on all who
received baptism and the faith from Patrick, whence is the custom of the
Michaelmas sheep and the Michael's

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

portion (*míre Míchil*) in Ireland ever since." Gratitude is here the
foundation of the sacrificial meal; the converse of this is the thought:
when the deity gets what is due, the offerer expects to be granted what
is right in return. Not that sacrifice is but a bargain; it is a highly
complex act.

The Michaelmas Sheep of Keating's account is doubtless the Michaelmas
Lamb which in the Hebrides is slain at the season when the Michael Cake
is made. Dr. Carmichael's account <span id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_333.md)
tells how, after the cake is cut into sections, the father of the family
"cuts up the lamb into small pieces. He takes the board with the bread
and the flesh on the centre of the table. Then the family, standing
round, and holding a bit of struan (cake) in the left hand and a piece
of lamb in the right, raise the 'Iolach Mìcheil,' triumphal song of
Michael, in praise of Michael, who guards and guides them, and in praise
of God, who gives them food and clothing, health and blessing withal.
The man and his wife put struan into one beehive basket (*ciosan*) and
lamb into another, and go out to distribute them among the poor of the
neighbourhood who have no flocks nor fruits themselves."

I believe that in a district where, too, the population is not of the
Roman persuasion, the Michaelmas Lamb has been killed not so long ago.
The whole ceremony has its parallel in the Lithuanian Sabarios, *i.e.*
'the mixing or throwing together,' at the eating of the new corn. Just
as the Michaelmas Cake was made from grain newly ripened in the field
and fresh ground in the quern, the grain for the Sabarios was

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

the first thrashed and winnowed, and then baked into little loaves, one
for each of the household. From a portion beer was brewed, and a jugful
poured on the bung of the barrel, the Lithuanian farmer saying: "O
fruitful earth, make rye and barley and all kinds of corn to flourish!"
Then a black or white or speckled cock and hen were taken and killed by
blows from a wooden spoon, all holding up their hands, saying: "O God,
and thou, O earth, we give you this cock and hen as a free-will
offering!" The Lithuanian rite, which Dr. Frazer interprets as the body
of the corn-spirit, partaken of sacramentally, took place at the
beginning of December. <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_334.md)

Another cake was made at Beltane on May-Day. This cake had a large hole
in the middle, through which each of the cows in the field was milked.
In Tiree it was of a triangular form.

Parallel in respect of its pointing to an offering is the Beltane custom
at Callander, described by M r. James Robertson, minister of the
parish: <span id="fr_336"></span>[2](#fn_335.md) "The people of this
district have two customs, which are fast wearing out, not only here,
but all over the Highlands, and therefore ought to be taken notice of
while they remain. Upon the first day of May, which is called *Bel-tan*,
or *Bal-tein* day, all the boys in a township or hamlet meet in the
moors. They cut a table in the green sod, of a round figure, by casting
a trench in the ground, of such circumference as to

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

hold the whole company. They kindle a fire, and dress a repast of eggs
and milk in the consistence of a custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal,
which is toasted at the embers against a stone. After the custard is
eaten up, they divide the cake into so many portions, as similar as
possible to one another in size and shape, as there are persons in the
company. They daub one of these portions all over with charcoal, until
it be perfectly black. They put all the bits of cake in a bonnet. Every
one, blindfold, draws out a portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled
to the last bit. Whoever draws the black bit is the *devoted* person who
is to be sacrificed to *Baal*, whose favour they mean to implore in
rendering the year productive of the sustenance of man and beast. There
is little doubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been once offered in
this country, as well as in the east, although they now pass from the
act of sacrificing, and only compel the *devoted* person to leap three
times through the flames; with which the ceremonies of this festival are
closed. The other custom is, that on All-Saints’ Even they set up
bonfires in every village. When the bonfire is consumed, the ashes are
carefully collected in the form of a circle. There is a stone put in,
near the circumference, for every person of the several families
interested in the bonfire; and whatever stone is moved out of its place,
or injured before next morning, the person represented by that stone is
devoted, or *fey*, and is supposed not to live twelve months from that
day. The people received the consecrated fire from the Druid priests
next morning, the virtues of which were supposed to continue for a
year."

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

In the parish of Kirkmichael, <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336.md)
adjoining Logierait, there was baked a consecrated cake for the first of
May. The cake, with knobs, was used, we may infer, formerly for
determining who was to be the victim of the flames. The cakes baked at
that period at Logierait had small lumps in the form of nipples raised
all over the surface.

Thomas Pennant, who travelled in Perthshire in the year 1769, tells us
that "on the 1st of May the herdmen of every village hold their Beltein,
a rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the ground, leaving the
turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of wood, on which they
dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring
besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of beer and whisky; for
each of the company must contribute something. The rites began with
spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation: on that,
every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which are raised nine square
knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver
of their flocks and herds, and to some particular animal, the real
destroyer of them. Each person then turns his face to the fire, breaks
off a knob, and flinging it over his shoulders, says, 'This I give to
thee, preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and
so on.' After that they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals:
'This I give to thee, O fox, spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded
crow! this to thee, O eagle!' When the ceremony is over, they dine on
the caudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hid by

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

two persons deputed for that purpose, but on the next Sunday they
reassemble and finish the reliques of the first entertainment."

The idea of offerings is at times closely associated with purification.
It is met with in the rites connected with the *caisean-uchd*, *i.e.*
the strip of skin from the breast of a sheep killed at Christmas, New
Year and other sacred festivals. "The strip is oval, and no knife must
be used in removing it from the flesh. It is carried by the carollers
when they visit the houses of the townland, and when lit by the head of
the house it is given to each person in turn to smell, going sunwise.
Should it go out, it is a bad omen for the person in whose hand it
becomes extinguished. The inhaling of the fumes of the burning skin and
wool is a talisman to safeguard the family from fairies, witches, demons
and other uncanny creatures during the year." <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_337.md) Macleod and Dewar's *Gaelic Dictionary*
defines it as "the breast-strip of a sheep killed at Christmas or New
Year's Eve, and singed and smelled by each member of the family as a
charm against fairies and spirits." The word *caisean* means 'anything
curled,' particularly the dew-lap which hangs from the breast of
animals. To judge by M‘Alpine's phrase, 'never for the sake of fairies,'
the rite in Islay was in vogue as a preservative at any time and was not
connected with the fairy-world. The practice is referred to in a quite
recent account from South Uist, which I may translate: "Now I must
conclude. The observers of New Year's Eve (Christmas Eve, old style) are
approaching me with the loud shouting proper

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

to the season, and according to old custom they will go sunwise round
the house, bringing the *Callaig* (the Hogmanay) gift with them. At the
door the Callaig rhyme is to be said on entering: This is to bless the
dwelling; may God bless this house and its inmates all! Going sunwise
round the fire, the Hogmanay Breast-strip (*Caisein Callaig*) is to be
set-on-fire or lighted, that is, the breast-skin of a wedder; each
person in the house is to seize hold of it as it burns, making the sign
of the cross, if he be a Catholic, in the name of the Father, and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit. That burning strip is to be put thrice
sunwise about their heads. If the burning skin be extinguished in the
process, it is a bad omen for the New Year's happiness. Then they will
get their Hogmanay portion, each one according to his opportunity; with
good will they then disperse with the words: The blessing of God and of
the Hogmanay be with you all; if well to-night, seven times better may
ye be a year to-night!"

J. G. Campbell, in his *Witchcraft and Second Sight* (p. 233), gives a
full form of the rhyme with the following lines:

The Calluinn Breast-strip is in my pocket,  
     A goodly mist comes from it;  
The goodman will get it first,  
And shove its nose into the fire upon the hearth.  
It will go sunwise round the children,  
And particularly the wife will get it.

Mr. Campbell specifies as to the procession that the hide of the mart
cow, killed for winter use, was wrapped round the head of one of the
men, and he

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

made off, followed by the rest, belabouring the hide, which made a noise
like a drum, with switches. One of the participators, that is, had to be
clothed in hide. <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_338.md) I am reminded of
the Roman Luperci who, on 15th February, girt themselves with the skins
of slaughtered goats and struck all the women who came near them with
strips of skin from the hides of the goat-victims, such strips being
among the objects called by the priests *februa*. The purposes of such
rites were purification and fructification; the victim was sacro-sanct,
and an effort was thus made towards symbolising by participation the
physical unity of all life. The old custom of throwing bones or burnt
pieces of animals into the flames is testified to by the name
'bonefire.' Dr. Fowler has noted that the Highland 'man in cowhide' is
singularly like the Roman rite as Lydus describes it; the skin-clad man,
the old Mars, was beaten with long rods and driven out of Rome on the
day preceding the full moon of the old Roman year, which began on March
1. The month of March was dedicated to him as the deity of the sprouting
vegetation. Though now we have the Highland rite but in a shadow, we may
infer that the intent was to communicate new life by the burnt strip of
skin, and that originally there was slaughter of an animal: the man girt
with the hide of the sacro-sanct victim became one with the victim; he
entered into the nature of the life-giving blood shed. Just as

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

washing the hands in pig's blood is held to be a cure for warts in the
Highlands still, of old the virtue of blood was greater. May we not
presumably infer that blood purified? Elsewhere the murderer's hands
were purified by smearing them with the blood of a young pig (Apollonius
Rhodius, 4, 478).

Blood makes the transition to animal sacrifice. Here, making allowance
for cross-division in so complex a subject, we arrive at:

(*b*) *The rites that avert*.

I give an instance from Ross-shire: "Here is another curious practice in
connection with epilepsy which I saw carried out many years ago, and
which is, I suppose, a survival of old pagan sacrificial rites. A child,
belonging to a family whom I know well, was suddenly seized with
convulsions, and its relatives would have it that the child had
epilepsy. Accordingly, emissaries were sent through the parish to
procure a black cock, without a single white feather, and without
blemish of any kind. This latter is important; the finer the animal, the
more readily does the spell work. Well, then, a cock was found which
suited the requirements; the stone floor in the room where the child was
first seized was opened up at the exact spot where the seizure took
place. The unfortunate animal was sealed down and buried alive, after
which an incantation was muttered over it by a 'wise woman.'" <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_339.md) The child was afterwards bathed.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

A correspondent from Lewis is quoted. He writes: "The cure for epileptic
fits is more barbarous, and to my knowledge was used not three months
ago in Barvas (4½ miles from here). A black cock (the barn-door
variety), without a light-coloured feather, is buried alive on the spot
where the patient experienced his or her first fit; that is all and the
cure is effected by \[inducing\] the evil spirit causing epilepsy to
leave the patient and enter into the body of the cock." <span
id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_340.md)

A special form of sacrifice is connected with the cat. The ulterior
purpose is to invoke the Evil One, according to modern folk-belief, and
while the rite is named 'invocation' (taghairm) <span
id="fr_342"></span>[2](#fn_341.md) the means used partake of something of
the nature of sacrifice mingled with compelling magic. The account I
give is from an authentic source in the London Literary Gazelle, March,
1824. <span id="fr_343"></span>[3](#fn_342.md) “The last time the Taughairm
(*sic*) was performed in the Highlands was in the island of Mull, in the
beginning of the seventeenth century, and the place is still well known
to the inhabitants. Allan Maclean, commonly styled

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Allan mac Echain
(son of Hector) was the projector of these horrid rites; and he was
joined by Lachlan Maclean, otherwise denominated Lachunn Odhar (Lachlann
the Dun). They were of resolute and determined character, and both young
and unmarried.

"The institution was no doubt of pagan origin, and was a sacrifice
offered to the Evil Spirit, in return for which the votaries were
entitled to demand two boons. The idea entertained of it at the time
must have been dreadful, and it is still often quoted for the purpose of
terrifying the young and credulous. The sacrifice consisted of living
cats roasted on a spit while life remained, and when the animal expired
another was put on in its place. This operation was continued for four
days and nights without tasting food. The Taughairm commenced at
midnight between Friday and Saturday, and had not long proceeded when
infernal spirits began to enter the house or barn in which it was
performing, in the form of black cats. The first cat that entered, after
darting a furious look at the operator, said: 'Lachunn Odhar, thou son
of Neil, that is bad usage of a cat.' Allan, who superintended as master
of the rites, cautioned Lachunn that whatever he should hear or see, he
must continue to turn the spit; and this was done accordingly. The cats
continued to enter, and the yells of the cat on the spit, joined by the
rest, were tremendous. A cat of enormous size at last appeared and told
Lachunn Odhar that if he did not desist before his great-eared brother
arrived, he never would behold the face of God. Lachunn answered that if
all the devils in hell came he would not flinch until his task was
concluded. By the end

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

of the fourth day there was a black cat at the root of every rafter on
the roof of the barn, and their yells were distinctly heard beyond the
Sound of Mull in Morvern." Another account is given by the late Rev. Dr.
Clerk of Kilmaille, <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) who states
that Allan nan Creach, one of the Lochiels of the fifteenth century, had
recourse "to the oracle of the Tigh Ghairm or House of Invocation
(*sic*)." While incorrect in his spelling of the name, which has nothing
to do with *tigh* 'house,' most of the other details agree with the
preceding account. The king of the cats is named therein *Cluasa
Leabhra* from his ears of portentous magnitude. The command given to the
operant was: 'Hear you this or see you that, Round the spit and turn the
cat.' <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_344.md) If the presumptuous mortal
quailed he would become the prey of the Evil One; if bold enough the
cats would answer any question in return for the release of the tortured
beast. This Lochiel succeeded in attaining: he asked, it was said, 'What
must I do to be saved?' and the answer of the oracle was a command to
build seven churches, one for each of his great forays, and thus to
expiate his sins. Another account <span id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_345.md)
tells how the MacArthurs at Glassary made a *taghairm*. It is explained
that "it seems if you make a Taghairm the *Mac Molach* (recte, Mag
Molach, *i.e.* Hairy Hand or Paw) will come and tell you anything you
ask him." MacArthur offered to fight all that was dead or alive within
the sea, and from the evil consequences he was only saved

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

by the virtues of the Need-Fire. But more important animals were
sacrificed. Just as a white steer was sacrificed to the sky-god on the
Capitol at Rome, <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_346.md) we hear of white
bulls which the Gaulish druids sacrificed under the holy oak before they
cut the mistletoe. <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_347.md)

It is recorded by Sir James Simpson, the discoverer of chloroform, that
in the latter end of the eighteenth century his own father "was in early
life personally engaged in the offering up and burying of a poor live
cow as a sacrifice to the spirit of Murrain." <span
id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_348.md) This was done within twenty miles of
Edinburgh, and by a shrewd farrier who yet laid aside a corner of a
field—'the gude-man's croft,'—as an offering to the Evil One. I well
recollect how in the Highlands, when any loss occurred among cattle in
spring (*earchall*) the hooves and sometimes the head or parts of it
were taken away to the wood and buried secretly in the soil under great
trees where nobody could possibly molest them. It was still better to
bury them on an adjoining estate, and across a river. This was to put
away the earchall and to prevent the loss of more animals. It was a
giving of part for the whole. In some of the Isles there is still a
memory of a cure for a species of cattle-plague <span
id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_349.md) which was especially

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

destructive of heifers. The old people said if the heifer's head were
struck off at a single blow with a clean or stainless sword that the
plague would cease, and that no further death would occur. <span
id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_350.md) This was done in the eighteenth century.
One who lived until 1820 remembered seeing his father bring home the
decapitated heifer. The man's father explained the reason; he was wont
to say likewise that they lost no more cattle by the plague.

"In Wales," says the Rev. John Evans in 1812, "when a violent disease
breaks out amongst the horned cattle, the farmers of the district where
it rages join to give up a bullock for a victim, which is carried to the
top of a precipice from whence it is thrown down." He says this is known
as "casting a captive to the devil." <span
id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_351.md) In Cornwall, about 1800, a calf was
burnt to death, the object of the sacrifice being to arrest the murrain!
In Devon a ram was slain. <span id="fr_353"></span>[3](#fn_352.md) At
Gaulish communal sacrifices Diodorus (*v*. 284) tells that close to the
worshippers on certain

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

religious occasions were "hearths laden with fire, and having upon them
cauldrons and spits full of the carcases of whole animals." Animals were
even bought for sacrifices, according to Arrian. <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_353.md)

I would not wish to press what Keating denies, but in the light of other
survivals among the Celts the statement of Giraldus Cambrensis <span
id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_354.md) can hardly be the offspring of his own
imagination, but a survival in old belief, though not in the custom of
his day. When the king of the Cineal Conaill used to be inaugurated,
says Giraldus, an assembly was made of the people of his country on a
high hill in his territory; a white mare being slain, and put to boil in
a large pot in the centre of the field; on being boiled he was to drink
up her broth like a hound or beagle with his mouth, and to eat the flesh
out of his hands without having a knife or any instrument for cutting
it. He would have to divide the rest of the flesh among the assembly,
and then bathe himself in the broth. If this be a case of tribal
totemistic communion-sacrifice part of the ritual is to be compared with
that of the *tarbh-feiss*, or bull-feast, mentioned in *The Sick-Bed of
Cuchulainn* as a means of divination, and with references to the horse
as sacred elsewhere. We know the strong aversion we entertain against
eating horse-flesh. It seems to be very old among the Celts. When
Vercingetorix had sent away all his cavalry by night from Alesia, having
barely corn for thirty days, Critognatus later on proposed to support
life by the corpses of those

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

who appeared useless for war on account of their age, as alluded to by
Caesar for "singular and detestable cruelty." <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_355.md) A modern general would have utilised his
horses for food. We seem to be in the presence of a taboo from a time
when horses were sacred, as they were among the Icelanders, who up to
the time of their adoption of Christianity ate horseflesh on certain
occasions,—a liberty allowed them even after baptism, but soon
discarded.

A Highland example is the sacrifice of bulls at Loch Maree. It is
attested by the Records of the Presbytery of Dingwall, <span

"At Dingwall, 6 August 1678.

"Inter alia, That day M<sup>r</sup> Roderick Mackenzie minister at
Gerloch by his letter to the prebrie, declared that he had

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

summoned by his officer to this prebrie day Hector Mackenzie in Mellan
in the parish of Gerloch, as also Johne Murdoch and Duncan Mackenzies,
sons to the said Hector—as also Kenneth M‘Kenzie his grandson, for
sacrificing a bull in ane heathenish manner in the iland of St Ruffus
commonly called Ellan Moury in Lochew, for the recovering of the health
of Cirstane Mackenzie, spouse to the said Hector Mackenzie, who was
formerlie sicke and valetudinaire:—Who being all cited, and not
compearing, are to be all summoned again pro 2°."

St. Maolrubha, whose death is recorded for the year 722, and whose
historical double is Ruffus, was not the only saint on the way of being
deified. Reginald of Durham has a notice of a bull being offered to St.
Cuthbert, at his church on the Solway, on the festival kept on the day
of the dedication of the church in the year 1164. <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_359.md) St. Maolrubha's well was desecrated
through a mad dog having been brought to drink of its waters. Animal
cures, moreover, were sometimes attempted by offering them the life of
another animal. An instance is recorded by Hugh Miller in his *Schools
and Schoolmasters*. He had paid a visit to his aunt's house at Gruids,
Lairg, and saw "his cousin, George, administer to an ailing cow a little
live trout, simply because the traditions of the district assured him
that a trout swallowed alive by the creature was the only specific in
the case." Again, the animal life offered may be simply buried alive as
a sacrificial rite, as when a live cock or a live toad is buried in the
hope of curing some bodily ailments. The idea here is that of putting
the disease away—*do ut abeas*, 'I give that thou mayst be gone.' With
the burial act one may compare the rite of burying a murdered man's
boots

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

to prevent his spirit from returning to earth again. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) A certain disease among cattle, *Na
Geumraich*, or 'cattle lowing,' was held to be curable only by human
blood. The Rev. C. Robertson <span id="fr_362"></span>[2](#fn_361.md) gives
an independent account which corroborates the one I now quote by a
clergyman lately deceased and long familiar with the district.

"The most horrible of sacrificial remedies was that in vogue at one time
for the cure of cattle-madness. It is reported that a farmer in
Kinlochewe had his cattle infected with that disease, and was unable to
heal them by ordinary means. He was told that if he could get the heart
of a man who did not know his parents, and dip it in a tub of water,
that he would have his remedy. By sprinkling the water on the cattle the
trouble would be washed away. He could not expect to get that, but the
idea got hold of him, and kept him on the alert for the charm. A
travelling pack merchant or pedlar happened to come to his house one
evening, and he was hospitably entertained. In course of conversation
the man gave as much of his history as he remembered at the time. Among
other things, he said that he knew nothing of his people, that he did
not know even the names of his parents. He got up next morning and set
out on his journey towards Torridon. When about half-way through the
glen he was overtaken by his host of the previous evening who demanded
his life. The poor man said that he might have all his goods without a
struggle on

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

his part if that was what he was after. But the murderer told him
plainly that he wanted no less than his life, that he followed him for
his heart to cure his cattle. He took out his heart there and then and
prepared the remedy. It is said that the cattle had been cured, but that
the disease was transferred to his family. Some of his descendants, who
inherited the transferred madness, were spotted up to the middle of last
century as families who were under a more terrible ban than that of
Gehazi." <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_362.md)

In Breadalbane "there is a tradition that, once upon a time, when a
pestilence raged among the herds on the south side of Lochtay, a ghastly
tragedy was enacted. Actuated by a heathenish desire to propitiate some
evil spirit or other, the people seized a poor 'gangrel body,' bound him
hand and foot, and placed him in the ford of Ardtalnaig burn . . . a
little further up the stream than the present bridge. All the cattle in
that district were then driven over his body, and the poor creature's
life was crushed out." <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_363.md)

A manuscript of Cormac's *Glossary* gives an alternative, though
unscientific, derivation for the name Emain: "No em ab ema \[αἱμα\] id
est sanguine quia ema sanguis est. Uin *i.e.* unus quia sanguis unius
hominis \[effusus est\] in tempore conditionis ejus." In other words,
the wrong etymology there given is a suggestion that the word 'Emain,
Emain' signifies 'the blood of one,' because the blood of one man was
poured forth at the founding of Emain.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

The need of immolating a human being to ensure the stability of a
building Dr. Stokes notes in his edition of Cormac as a superstition
still current in India. Grimm tells us that in 1843, during the building
of the new bridge at Halle, it was a popular superstition that one
required to bury a child in the foundation, and he cites similar beliefs
among the Danes, Greeks, and Servians. We find a parallel belief in
Britain, as is recorded by Nennius. When Guorthigern wishes to build
Dinas Emris his druids say "Nisi infantem sine patre invenies et
occidetur ille, et arx a sanguine suo aspergatur, nunquam aedificatur in
aeternum." A child without a father has to be found and slain, and the
fortress is to be built in such an one's blood if the building is to
stand. The Irish-Gaelic Nennius expressly says that Guorthigern, with
his hosts and with his druids, traversed all the south of the island of
Britain until they arrived at Guined, and they searched all the
mountains of Herer and there found a Dinn (Dùn or fort) over the sea,
and a very strong locality fit to build on; and his druids said to him:
"Build here thy fortress," said they, "for nothing shall ever prevail
against it." Builders were then brought thither, and they collected
materials for the fortress, both stone and wood, but all these materials
were carried away in one night; and materials were thus gathered thrice
and thrice carried away. And he asked of his druids: "Whence is this
evil?" said he. And the druids said: "Seek a son whose father is
unknown, kill him, and let his blood be sprinkled upon the Dùn, for by
this means only it can be built." Messengers were sent by him throughout

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

the island of Britain to seek for a son without a father; and they
searched as far as Magh Eillite, in the territory of Glevisic, where
they found boys a-hurling; and there happened a dispute between two of
the boys, so that one said to the other: "O man without a father, thou
hast no good at all." The messengers asked: "Whose son is the lad to
whom this is said?" Those on the hurling green said: "We know not," said
they; "his mother is here." They asked of his mother whose son the lad
was. The mother answered: "I know not that he bath a father, and I know
not how he happened to be conceived in my womb at all." So the
messengers took the boy with them to Guorthigern, and told him how they
found him. On the next day the army was assembled that the boy might be
killed. And the boy was brought before the king, and he said to the
king: "Wherefore have they brought me to thee?" said he. And the king
said: "To slay thee and to butcher thee, and to consecrate this fortress
with thy blood \[dod marbudsa, ar sé, ocus dod coscrad ocus do cosergud
in duin sea dod fhuil\]." The boy said: "Who instructed thee in this?"
"My Druids," said the king. "Let them be called hither," said the boy.
And the druids came. The boy said to them: "Who told you that this
fortress could not be built until it was first consecrated with my
blood?" And they answered not. <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_364.md)

Dr. Todd seems of opinion that the practice of auspicating the
foundation of cities, temples, or other solemn structures was not of
remote antiquity, and

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

throws some doubt upon parallel instances from a ninth century
compilator, Johannes Malala, who records that at the foundation of
Antioch, Selecus Nicator erected a pedestal and statue of the virgin
Aemathe sacrificed as the Fortune of the city, as he likewise is said to
have done at the foundation of Laodicea in Syria, where the walls were
dug in the track of the blood of a wild boar, and a virgin named Agave
is said to have been sacrificed and a brazen statue erected to her as
the fortune of the city. But Dr. Todd emphasises the point that the
narrative in Nennius has this distinction, that repeated failures had
shown the necessity of some piacular rite wherein it more nearly agrees
with the legend of St. Odran (Oran) of Iona. It is quite true that the
story of St. Odran's self-sacrifice is unnoticed in Adamnan's *Life of
Columcille*, a story which Bishop Reeves calls "curious and not very
creditable." Historic fact, however, has an interest entirely apart from
quality of action, the *belief* has to be accounted for quite apart from
what actually happened to St. Odran. It is not possible that any such
thing happened in Columcille's following, but the legend points to the
popular folk-belief in what was expected to occur.

But the Gaelic 'Life of Columcille' in the *Book of Lismore*, dating
from a late age when legend was more active with Columcille's memory
than even the embellishments of Adamnan's age could tolerate, we read
how the saint reached Iona on the night of Pentecost. Two bishops who
dwelt in the land came to expel him from it. But God revealed to Colomb
Cille that they were not bishops in truth.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wherefore they
left the island when he told them of their own conclusion and their
account. Said Colomb Cille to his household: <span
id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_365.md) "It is well for us that our roots should
go under the ground here." And he said: "It is permitted to you, that
some one of you should go under the earth here or under the mould of the
island to consecrate it." Odrán rose up readily and this he said: "If I
should be taken," saith he, "I am ready for that." "O Odrán!" saith
Colomb Cille, "thou shalt have the reward thereof. No prayer shall be
granted to anyone at my grave, unless it is first asked of thee." Then
Odrán went to heaven. Colomb founded a church by him afterwards.

This narrative cannot be historical, inasmuch as Odrán is not included
in the oldest list of Columcille's companions, and the *Annals of the
Four Masters* record his death in 548 *i.e.* fifteen years before
Columcille came to Hy. Yet the narrative undoubtedly is a piece of
folk-belief. It is hard for men to realise that the gods as spoken of in
legends really never had actual outward existence, great as is the part
they played in the history of man and of mind. The Divine Life was ever
perfect and One. And a narrative like this, while not historically true
to fact, is historically true as a record of belief, and

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

points to a possible time when there was an actual basis of fact. I do
not know when certain legends arose which detail the story of a beggar
woman, who while passing the way at the time was buried alive under the
foundation-stone of a Highland manse I know well, along with a live
cock. It was believed, and yet the building did not exist at the date
specified, although the legend may have been transferred from another
building more than a mile away, which latter could have come by this
association from a pre-Christian sacred place. In like spirit it is
still related that Odrán had offered himself in sacrifice, for the walls
of Columcille's first edifice in Iona fell down as soon as built owing
to evil agencies. Oran was duly interred alive, and spoke as follows to
Colomb Cille who on the third day went to the grave to see how his
friend fared, when he was told by St. Oran

Chan eil am bàs ’na iongantas  
No Ifrinn mar a dh’aithrisear

*i.e.*

Death is no wonder  
Nor is Hell as it is said.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shocked by such a
speech Colomb Cille called out: ùir, ùir sùil Odhrain! mun labhair e
tuille còmhraidh *i.e.* Earth, Earth, on Oran's eye! lest he talk more.
St. Oran was credited with laxer views than Columcille, if we follow the
version of his answer which Sheriff Nicolson got from Tiree:

Chan eil an t-Eug ’na annas  
  s chan eil Ifrinn mar a dùbhrar;  
Cha teid math am mùthadh  
  ’s cha bhi olc gun dìoladh.

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

*i.e.*

Death is nothing strange,  
  Nor Hell as has been said;  
Good will not perish,  
  Nor evil be unpunished.

These theologians of Tiree may never have heard of Aristophanes, but
their irony reminds one of the passage in *The Frogs* where, pointing
out the difference between the old style of officials and the new, he
says that nowadays State offices are filled with the pharmakos or human
scape-goat, from which we infer the existence of such similar practices
among the Greeks:

Any chance man that we come across  
Not fit in old days for a pharmakos  
     These we use  
     And these we choose  
The veriest scum, the mere refuse.

To expel a pharmakos or human scape-goat was among the Greeks a symbolic
act of purification. If a calamity, a Greek historian tells us, overtook
a city, whether it were famine or pestilence, or any other mischief,
they led forth, as though to a sacrifice, the most unsightly of them all
as a purification and a remedy to the suffering city. They set the
sacrifice in the appointed place, and gave him cheese with their hands
and a barley cake and figs, and seven times they smote him with leeks
and wild figs and other wild plants. Finally they burnt him with fire
with the wood of wild trees, and scattered the ashes to the sea and to
the winds, for a purification. <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

Later on I shall speak of the Sin-Eater under Funeral-Rites. Here
suffice it to say I am reminded of the Gaelic phrase: *cuir am mach am
Bàs*, referring to the expulsion of death in a symbolic act, as is often
the case in primitive ritual. Death is symbolised as an old woman or
*cailleach*, who undergoes the process of expulsion by representation.
The survival of the ceremony, although the Gaelic phrase is not given,
is described in Stewart's *Highland Superstitions and Amusements*: <span
id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_367.md) "Some wiseacre by some lucky chance
discovered that at this festive season (Xmas), when the asperity of its
character is probably much softened, even relentless death himself can
be compromised with on very advantageous terms. By the sacrifice of an
old woman, or any other body whom he wished in a better world, and whom,
by the following process, he chose to send to it, death was debarred
from any farther claim to himself, or his friends, until the return of
the next anniversary. He went to the wood this night, fetched home the
stump of some withered tree, which he regularly constituted the
representative of some person of the description . . . mentioned, and
whose doom was inevitably fixed by the process, without resort or
appeal. Such a simple mode of obtaining security from a foe whom
everybody fears, could not be supposed to fall into desuetude; and the
custom is therefore retained, whatever faith may exist as to its
utility, in some parts of the country even to this day."

Death as expelled through symbol in the Highlands may be paralleled by
the old Greek rite of the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'expulsion of
hunger,' which Plutarch speaks of as an ancestral sacrifice. This
riddance or expulsion did not amount to a purification ceremony, but was
magical. A household slave was beaten with rods of *agnus castus*—a
plant of cathartic quality—and driven outside, with the words, "Out with
hunger, in with health and wealth." The nearest thing to this in the
Highlands is when, on the occasion of death visiting a house, one who
condoles is given the answer at times: *Is math nach e’n t-acras
thainig*, '’tis well it is not Hunger that has visited us.'

Where human life is required for the prevention of an evil we come upon
the principle of vicarious sacrifice. Among literary references I note
that St. Finnian of Clonard "died on behalf of the people of the Gaels
that they might not all die of the Buidhe Chonaill." <span
id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_368.md) In the tale of the Expulsion of the
Déisi the druid of one of the opposing armies sacrifices himself to
secure victory to his own side. <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_369.md)
Eimíne Bán and forty-nine of his monks vicariously sacrificed themselves
by voluntary death in order to save Bran úa Faeláin, King of Leinster,
and forty-nine Leinster chiefs from the pestilence which was then
desolating Leinster. <span id="fr_371"></span>[3](#fn_370.md)

Of the idea that one must die to secure the

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

recovery of another a striking instance is given in Leslie Forbes's
*Early Races of Scotland*. When Hector Monro, XVIIth Baron of Fowlis,
was ill in 1588, a witch whose amulet-water had proved in vain informed
him that he could not recover unless in the words of the indictment,
"the principal man of his bluid should die for him." Another authentic
instance, that of Hugh Mackay of Halmadary, I have quoted
elsewhere. <span id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) Insane imagination and
religious frenzy had transformed a black cock into a satanic spirit. The
decision to offer Hugh Mackay's son as a sacrificial victim was
prevented by the humanity of a girl who had reason enough left to
protect the child: when the roof was taken off the house at the instance
of outsiders the spell of madness was broken. Afterwards the Good-Man of
Halmadary and his associates showed sincere repentance and shame, as
well they might! But the principle on which they went was parallel to
the belief which Caesar attributes to the Gauls that unless the life of
a man be offered for the life of a man the mind of the immortal gods
cannot be propitiated. In Gadhelic verse the Dinnshenchas of Mag Slecht
tells of the great idol Cromm Cruaich: "to him they used to offer the
firstlings of every issue and the chief scions of every clan." Around
him were four times three stone idols (trí hídail chloch fo chethair).

"It made every tribe be without peace.  
 Twas a sad evil!  
 Brave Gaels used to worship it.<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>  
 From it they would not without tribute ask  
 To be satisfied as to their portion of the hard world.  
 He was their god  
 .     .     .     .  
 To him without glory  
 They would kill their piteous wretched offspring  
 With much wailing and peril  
 To pour their blood around Cromm Cruaich.  
 Milk and corn  
 They would ask from him speedily  
 In return for one-third of their healthy (or whole) issue:  
 Great was the horror and the scare of him  
 To him  
 Noble Gaels would prostrate themselves;  
 From the worship of him with many manslaughters  
 The plain is called Mag Slecht." <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_372.md)

Tradition still faintly whispers of sacrifices at the altar stone of
Callernish Temple in Lewis: and there are folk-surmises to say the least
as regards some other 'Druid' circles on the mainland. Analogy would
point to similar rites as those in honour of Cromm. The poem quoted
states that to the coming of Patrick "there was worshipping of
stones." <span id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_373.md) Such incidents as have
been referred to seem to show that sacrifice is a complex act of
offering which embraces commensality and purification with their train
of joyous thoughts and acts; giving with a joyous expectation of being
given unto; propitiation with the fearsome hope of averting ills;
culminating in the case of humanity in the thought of substitution, or
life for life. Doubtless

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

there was much variation over the Celtic areas, while for Gaul Caesar's
account <span id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_374.md) holds. "The nation of the
Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious rites; and on that account
they who are troubled with unusually severe diseases, and they who are
engaged in battles and dangers, either sacrifice men as victims, or vow
that they will sacrifice them, and employ the Druids as the performers
of those sacrifices, because they think that unless the life of a man be
offered for the life of a man the mind of the immortal gods cannot be
rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices of that kind ordained for
national purposes. Others have figures of vast size; the limbs of which,
formed of osiers, they fill with living men, which being set on fire the
men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation of
such as have been taken in theft or in robbery, or any other offence, is
more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is
wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent."

In a previous chapter Caesar tells that to be interdicted from the
sacrifices was among the Gauls a most heavy punishment: "Those who have
been thus interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and the
criminal: all shun them and avoid their society and conversation, lest
they receive some evil from their contact; nor is justice administered
to them when seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed on them." <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_375.md) Sacrifice was thus a most vital bond.
Procopius, <span id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_376.md) in referring to the
inhabitants of Thule, relates that they regarded their

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

first prisoner of war as the best: the victim was hanged from a tree,
cast among thorns, or otherwise horribly done to death. Plutarch <span
id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) particularly emphasises that with the
Gauls human sacrifices was the most perfect form of sacrifice. This is
confirmed by a rite among the Gauls of Massilia (Marseilles) of which we
learn from Servius's Commentary on Vergil. <span
id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_378.md) As often as there was a pestilence one
of the poor offered himself to be hospitably entertained at the public
expense and on the choicest of foods for a full year. Thereafter, having
been decorated with boughs and raiment such as were used at sacrifices,
he was led through the whole city amid execrations that he might take
upon himself the sins (*mala*) of the whole community, and was thus
thrown down from a height as a propitiatory sacrifice.

All these observances in Celtic lands hang more or less together in the
matter of fundamental ideas. The gods must not be treated with neglect;
the right social observances constitute religion, which is a stated
carefulness of rites that is the opposite to neglect. The individual
must not come empty-handed for the primitive god is often a magnified
human chief in his ways; <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) he must
know how to appease the angry deity; he may even feel he has to slay the
god's human representative, while his vigour has not suffered decay.
Whether it be

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

through the communal-sacrificial meal, or through identification of
himself with the nature of the animal offered, or by imitation of such
identity as in the case of the man clad in cow-skin, <span
id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_380.md) or by human sacrifice, it is only thus
that he attains to magic contact with what is taken for divine. The
divine touch puts all fear to rest. The essence of sacrifice is contact
in the sense that ceremonial contact with sacred objects brings
strength. A word may bring one into such contact; to partake of
particles of the sacred object begets contact; to place a stone on the
cairn where the funeral procession rests brings one into ceremonial
contact with the spirit of the deceased, who of old was thought to live
on in the body and rest where it rested. Or one may even get into
contact with the spirit of the living, as when one makes a vow after
missing any article of value that should it be recovered one will give a
gift or its equivalent to the saint of the place. This is the West
Sutherland rite of putting a shilling (or whatever it be) on a good man.
With the element of contact which brings strength there goes the
possibility of compulsion or magical control, and hence arises a code of
things to be avoided as well as done.

The things proper to be done are positive enactments full of
wonder-working power; most of the religious ritual is of this sort, for
there is a binding of the object of one's faith, which in Old Irish is
*iress*, 'on-standing,' surviving in modern *amharus*, *i.e.* *an* +
*iress*, 'non-faith or doubt,' and this attitude throughout a series of
ceremonial acts is summed up

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

in the attitude of a supreme act of trust, *crābhadh*; Old Irish
*crabud*, 'faith,' Cymric *crefydd*, Sanscrit *vi-çrambh*, 'trust.' The
magic or wonder-working element at the basis of even the most
rudimentary cult abides throughout and survives in the highest religion
on its ceremonial side where the transition is made to *awe*. How else
can we account for the Gaelic *ōrtha*, from the Latin *orationem*,
'prayer,' being now the current word for 'spell': *e.g*. in speaking of
a witch one says: *chuir i an ōrth’ ann*, *i.e.* 'she put a magic spell
on him.' There is also the native Gadhelic *ubaidh*, *ubag*, 'a charm,'
Old Irish *upta*, 'fascination,' Manx *obbee*, 'sorcery,' all ultimately
from a root *ba*, 'to speak.' Yet prayer in its essence precedes magic.
The rudiments of a voice of conscience speak or whisper in the *manadh*
or 'warning,' and of old it was felt that natural signs follow to
corroborate a just verdict. Thus we read in Keating, <span
id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) for example: "When Fachtna delivered an
unjust judgement, if it was in the autumn he delivered it, the fruit
fell to the ground that night in the country in which he was. But when
he delivered a just judgement, the fruit remained in full on the trees;
or if in the spring he delivered an unjust judgement, the cattle forsook
their young in that country. Morann, son of Maon, gave no judgement
without having the Morann collar round his neck, and when he gave an
unjust judgement the collar grew tight round his neck, and when he gave
a just judgement the collar stretched out over his shoulders. . . . And
so it was with several

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pagan authors,
they were subject to *geasa* (prohibitions, tabus), preventing them from
partiality in history or judgement."

Surrounded by so many dangers, it was unavoidable that even in
rudimentary religion there should arise a code of what was 'crossed' or
forbidden (*air a chrosadh*), or *tabu*, not to be lightly
approached,—hence a series of negative precepts or prohibitions.

It is forbidden (*tha e air a chrosadh*) for a young lad or a young
woman to sweep out the room in which a corpse has been. This should be
done by a woman who is past child-bearing. The idea is that the
influence of Death is about and may endanger the potency of the
developing life; one is reminded of the practice in the Congo region,
where they abstain for a whole year from sweeping out the house where a
man has died, lest the dust should offend the ghost; <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_382.md) as also of the Albanian custom of
refraining on the day of the funeral from sweeping the place where the
corpse lay. <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_383.md) In the Highlands it is
forbidden for a male child to sweep the floor and the hearthstone in a
room where a death has just been; <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](#fn_384.md)
the sweepings seem as if in such intimate consecration to the powers of
death that there is a danger of injuring the development of virility.
Take not the ashes from off the hearth, the old folks used to say;
nothing else is so 'blasting' as to wipe the hearth clean. I would

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

prefer the fire to be alive thereon than not. Others would cast a shower
of ashes before them ere entering. That's what the old folks would say:
I don't know if they were right, but there were witches since the
beginning of the world, and there will be unto the end, so long as the
world is a world, <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_385.md) according to my
authority.

Here is a series of things Taboo which the Rev. A. Macdonald tabulated
for the Isle of Eriskay and its neighbourhood: It is not right to throw
a comb to a person; do not throw a comb but at thine enemy; <span
id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_386.md) it is not right to bury a person on a
Friday, nor to kill a sheep on a Friday, nor to cut hair nor pare nails
on Friday or Sunday. It is not right to plough on Good Friday, though it
is allowable to plant potatoes with a wooden dibble (*pleadhag*) and to
rake the ground with the three-toothed wooden hammer called a rake. It
is not right to change residence going from north to south except on
Monday, and when going from south to north one should go on
Saturday. <span id="fr_388"></span>[3](#fn_387.md) It is not right to sew
clothes on Sunday: no man who has had his clothes stitched on the Lord's
Day will walk straight. <span id="fr_389"></span>[4](#fn_388.md) If a

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

woman tells you that the new moon is visible, it is not right to go and
look at it; when making the *frìth*, if a woman be seen she is the omen
of some untoward event.

It is not right to count the number of teeth in a comb. It means that
you are numbering the days of your life.

It is not right to be touching the chain (*slabhruidh*) over the fire.
It is said to be cursed. The devil is called *Am fear th’air an
t-slabhruidh*, 'the man on the chain.' I remember once when there was a
talk of a public official leaving the island of Uist that I remarked
that he might be replaced by a worse. The reply was: *cha’n urrainn gun
tig mur a tig an t-slabhruidh a nall buileach* = 'such a one could not
come unless the chain break entirely.'

There was a man who noticed that his cows ceased suddenly giving milk.
He had a strong suspicion that a woman in the neighbourhood was at the
bottom of the mischief. He went into her house one day in her absence.
He found nobody in but a little innocent child,—the daughter of the
woman in question. He asked her if her mother gave her any milk to
drink. The child said Yes. Where does your mother get the milk? was the
next query. *Bhiodh i ga bhleoghainn as an t-slabhruidh* = 'she would be
drawing it from the chain,' said the child. *Siuthad, a ghradhag, dian
thusa mar a bhitheas i ’dianamh* = 'Come, darling, do you as she is in
the habit of doing.' The child did go and the milk came from the chain.
The man tore down the chain and took it with him, and the lost *toradh*,
'milk produce,' returned to him (Anne M‘Intyre). There was a

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

plant, the *torannan* or *toradan*, that was used as being held able to
prevent the milk being spirited away.

To recover the *toradh* filched away. One plan is to go to the house of
the party suspected of taking it, and to pull off the roof of his house
as much thatch and divot as he can with his two hands, and to proceed
home with this. Then a pot is put on the fire and this thatch is thrown
gradually on the fire beneath the pot. In the pot is put the little milk
that has been left, and the thatch is kept burning under it until it
dries up. This brings the *toradh* back. <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_389.md) A male is preferable for the ceremony of
the thatch-snatching.

To a person who makes a very brief call and is in a hurry to get away
they say: *An ann a dhiarraidh teine thàinig thu*, *i.e.* 'is it to seek
fire you have come? '

It is not right to mend or stitch clothes while the clothes are on the
person. It interferes with the rights of the dead, to whom alone belongs
the privilege of having their death linens sewed upon the body (Mary Ann
Campbell, 1895).

It is not right (*ceart*) for a man to cut his own hair or even part of
it. Whatever it means the meaning has reference 'to raising the scissors
above one's own breath' (*togail an t-siosar os cionn analach*). Perhaps
it refers to cutting the breath of life which is the thread of life (do.
do.).

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

It is not right to return to the meal-chest the leavings of meal that
may be on the table when baking (*cha’n eil e ceart an fhalaid a
thilleadh dha’n chistidh*).

It is not right to be humming a song while baking (*cha’n eil e ceart a
bhi ri gnōdhan orain an am a bhi fuine*).

It is not right to leave the band on the spinning-wheel when you are
setting it past for the night. The sign of the cross should be made over
it.

It is not right to card or spin or work in wool on Saturday night. It is
said that a woman who was twisting threads with a spinning jenny on
Saturday night had her forefinger and middle finger joined together ever
after, these being the fingers that would be used.

It is not right to spin if there be a corpse in the same township.

It is not right to take fire out of a house where there is a child who
has not got teeth yet. It is said that the child will never get teeth if
the fire be taken away.

It is not right for a woman to comb her hair at night. Every hair that
she loses will get entangled about the feet of a relative who is sailing
in a ship (*cha’n eil gas a dh’fhalbhas asaibh nach bidh dol mu ’chasan
duine bhuineas duibh ann san t-saghach* <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_390).md).

It is not right to lose the *buarach* or the spancel tie that goes about
the cows’ feet at milking time. It is considered by the older people as
something holy and venerable. The best are made of horse hair. Some,
after milking the cattle, take the ties in

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

their hands while walking after the cattle and have a fixed spot for
hanging them up on their return from driving the cattle out. The reason
was that a person finding the tie (*buarach*) might get the *toradh*, or
produce, of your cattle.

It is not right at milking time if a person passes who is suspected of
having the evil eye to *answer* him even though he addresses you. Your
silence, or the animosity signified thereby, has an influence in
checking any harm that might come from him.
