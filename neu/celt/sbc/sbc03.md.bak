### I.

### THE FINDING OF THE SOUL.

SURVIVALS may be defined as primitive rites believed and practised,
rites which once were 'faith' but which from a later and higher
conception simply 'remain over' or survive. A survival may remain over
both as 'belief' and as 'rite'; in either case it is the equivalent of
the Latin 'superstitio.' But the English 'superstition' is too bare a
term for it. For a belief or ritual custom once existed as a living
force ere it sank into the position of a survival. A survival is what
has been left stranded while all around it there has been more or less
of change, of development, due to the growth of thoughtfulness and to
the action of environment and of historical forces. What has once become
a survival, if it have a future, has only a future of decay: its life
now is in decay, it has no development as a whole. But manifestly in a
social organism there are different rates of progress. Not all parts of
the life of a social system develop at the same time, at the same rate,
or in the same way. Nor is there the same continuous development over
the same period of time. Accordingly there are strata of belief and
ritual in

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

any and every social system, in the most recent as in the most archaic.

It is well to examine those archaic survivals one knows best; to
endeavour to reduce them in an unpretentious way to some system from the
point of view of a comparative study of man. Presupposed is the unity of
mankind, *i.e.* of man as a thinking and moral being. Consequently,
while this study is, on the whole, confined to customs among the Celts,
I feel at liberty to read these in the light of analogous customs where
possible. I do not know that in origin they are all Celtic. Ere the
Celtic migrations these islands were inhabited by other tribes whose
beliefs were most probably preserved among the Celts. It is not likely
that Celtic and non-Celtic tribes would have at the same period the same
beliefs and practices, which might be accounted for by both having been
on a different plane of development.

It would be most instructive and interesting to assign to each tribe its
own special belief and rite: in part that is attempted by the
folk-lorist. Here it is no mere collection of beliefs or of rites that
is aimed at, but the interpretation of these in the light of the 'soul.'
At first, I believe that the non-Celtic tribes preserved their own
belief and ritual for the reason that they were not admitted to full
legal status among the Celts. Yet the Celtic *tuath* or tribe and the
Celtic *fine* or clan were incorporating organisms, and through
inter-marriages new and alien customs were introduced and preserved,
especially among the mothers. The Pictish matriarchal system is of
special importance. In the light of 'mother-right' and all that inheres
therein one may perhaps read

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

such traces as may be found of the couvade and of the *aire chlaidh*,
'kirkyard watch' or 'grave guardian,' of which anon. A psychical
anthropology of the Celts is much wanted; but that of any single branch
is best read in the light of the rest, indeed of comparative religion.
What Edmund Spenser said of the 'wild Irish,' of whom he wrote in 1595
in his *View of the State of Ireland*, is equally true of the Highlands:
"All the customs of the Irish, which I have often noted and compared
with what I have read, would minister occasion of a most ample discourse
of the original of them, and the antiquity of that people, which in
truth I think to be more ancient than most that I know in this end of
the world: so as if it were taken in the handling of some man of sound
judgement and plentiful reading, it would be most pleasant and
profitable." In this search, which is of great intricacy and excessive
delicacy, as treating of belief-complexes which really reflect
soul-movements, it is only by some understanding of the whole that one
may interpret the part. Some curious rites, which in undertones I
learned of long ago in the Highlands, came down through the native
midwives, a breed that is now extinct in so far as the old rites are
concerned: it was the thought of understanding these in the light of the
whole that first led me to make this attempt. I make no doubt but the
distinction of rites between the Celtic and non-Celtic tribes was once
as firm as the distinction between tribesman and non-tribesman, which
Mr. Seebohm has shown to be an important feature of Celtic law. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

A help in the solution of the problems of Celtic psychical anthropology
would be to classify all customs, beliefs and rites which have the same
conceptions of life. The mythic influence of the conquered tribes ought
not to be forgotten. But it needs consideration likewise that tribes now
united into a nation may formerly have held customs quite different from
what they do now. The common Gadhelic sayings: 'it is mother-affinity
(friendship) that is nearest'; <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) 'I will
not say brother save to the son that my mother bore,' <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) point back to the Pictish social system,
according to which descent was reckoned in the female line. This, it has
been argued, is a feature which the Picts owed to non-Aryan
predecessors. But may not a race in the course of its long history be
led to change its customs from within? Wherever we meet with descent
reckoned in the female line, are we in presence of the non-Aryan? Mr.
Frazer shows how in royal families in Latium and in Greece the daughters
were kept at home, and the sons went forth to marry princesses and reign
among their wives’ peoples; <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) he says
that "among the Saxons and their near kinsmen the Varini it appears to
have been a regular custom for the new king to marry his
stepmother." <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md)

And further: "Attic usage always allowed a man to marry his half-sister
by the same father, but not his half-sister by the same mother. Such a
rule seems clearly to be a relic of a tune when kingship

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

was counted only through women." <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) He
instances also the great house of Aeacus in Greece, the grandfather of
Achilles and Ajax, and the family of the Pelopidae. The relation of
mother to child is of the first importance, and cults and customs ought
not to be read without keeping it in view. After all, as Professor
Gilbert Murray <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) has pointed out fitly,
the Matriarchate is one of the great civilising influences of mankind.

What is now but a mere 'survival' was once the sole substitute for our
philosophy and religion; the mere superstition of to-day is in unbroken
continuity with the dateless ages of earliest faiths. Progress and
change there have been throughout, but hardly such breaks as efface the
possibility of our recognising the religiosity of man as part of his
psychical being. Survivals,—making all allowance for diversities of
customs springing from different races within different eras of time,
and sometimes possibly temporarily resumed within a race which has
discarded them within its own past,—are but disguises which point to the
inherent unity of human thought in thinking itself out; to lift these
disguises into their unconscious system is to come upon the soul at
work, speaking to us half-aloud, and revealing what St. Augustine
perceived long ago,—the inherent unity of all religious feeling. In his
*Retractions*, the Bishop of Hippo declares that what is now called the
Christian

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Religion existed
among the ancients, and in fact was with the human race from the
beginning. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) It is his way of expressing
the idea of religious persistencies. These have various origins,
although the composite elements are ultimately brought under one
dominant thought which was latent in the rites from the beginning.
Religion is the body of sacred rites or scruples embodied in observances
which a man finds binding on himself with regard to the wills or Will,
which to his consciousness are in connection with and have regard to his
life. As given or revealed it is the Deity that covenants. Man is bound
thereby to his fellows and has regard for social ties. In course of
man's development in a social order, ancestral souls, the souls of the
dead, enter into his life for good or ill, as also Nature-Spirits
conceived as active in air, earth, water and fire, culminating at length
in the One Nature-Spirit.

It is in the rite that concrete religion is posited. The rite is the
correct inherited ancestral custom, having at bottom the idea of what
has been measured or numbered, and thus fixed by the convenience of the
ancestral community. It foreshadows the idea of Harmony. 'Follow, thou,
closely the fame of thine ancestors' (*lean-sa dlùth ri cliù do
shìnnsear*) is a Highland maxim favourable to survivals. What served the
past is good for us also. A particular religious obedience every man is
free to impose upon himself. But man does not often reach his
fundamental self: "the moments at which we thus grasp ourselves are
rare, and that is just why we are

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

rarely free. The greater part of the time we live outside ourselves,
hardly perceiving anything of ourselves but our own ghost, a colourless
shadow which pure duration projects into homogeneous space. Hence our
life unfolds itself in space rather than in time; we live for the
external world rather than for ourselves; we speak rather than think; we
'are acted' rather than act ourselves." <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) As living in space man becomes involved in a
system of ritual prohibitions: *do not*. They are solemn declarations
framed for his well-being, and need to be tested in practice. The taboos
of other races are present with the Gael as *gessa* or sacred
restrictions. It is their religious quality which imparts them
persistency. Religion now reveals its life in the way whereby one
approaches God; there are various avenues of approach to the Power
regarded as divine, and in approaching by these ways it is felt that one
should have regard to approaching aright and with due care. There is no
religion without its ritual. In the rite is expressed devotion to the
object for which one feels a care. Outwardly worship must necessarily
manifest the worshipper as one who is giving in order to get; he may
give goods or self, but in either case his actions imply a Power that
can give what may be gotten. Religion is ultimately a progress in Life,
and this implies the exercise of reflection which ultimately eliminates
idols. Acts of devotion may be manifested (*a*) with relation to souls
and with relationship of souls to the Highest Soul or God; (6) and may
be conditioned by sympathetic association with objects regarded as

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

having souls, or as being alive (Animism). Devotion thus embraces all
phases of Manism (of which what is known as Totemism is but a moment).
In Gadhelic, devotion is expressed by *cràbhadh*, piety (in rite); old
Irish *crabud*, 'faith'; cognate with Cymric *crefydd*. In the Highlands
the adjective *cràbhach* is applied to one who is devout and observant
of pious rites. The root of the word is met with in Sanskrit
*vi-çrambh*, 'trust.' The rites of religion <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9) (*cràbhadh*.md) are the various avenues of
approaching the Being in whom one has trust, expressed or implied. But
heart-giving has a side which implies belief inclusive of heart-consent.
In Gadhelic this is expressed by the word *creideamh*; Old Irish
*cretim*; Cymric *credu*; all cognate with Latin 'credo,' I believe';
Sanskrit *çrad-dadhâmi*, 'I give heart to.' The attitude of mind thus
attained to is expressed by the Old Irish *iress*, 'faith' (literally
'on-standing'), which only survives in the negative in the modern
Gadhelic *amharus*, 'doubt'; Old Irish *amairess*, 'unbelief,
infidelitas.' Religion therefore, so far as an examination of the Celtic
languages leads, is seen to embrace:

1\. the rite (*cràbhadh*, trust expressed in rite),

2\. the heart-consent (*creideamh*),

3\. faith (in the object or end of the rite): *iress*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This inclusive
attitude of mind, so far as the objects of attention are concerned, may
have reference to

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

1\. The Word:

(*a*) the word of prohibition or restriction (*geas*): the negative
word;

(*b*) the word of magic or the positive power of the Word spoken (*òb*,
*òrtha*, *guidhe*): the positive word;

(*c*) the lustral rites. Ordeals.

2\. The Soul or Souls, which embrace

(*a*) soul-parts, or soul in association with parts of the body;

(*b*) the internal soul or soul proper;

(*c*) the external soul or the soul in sympathy with, but imagined as
outside the body (sympathetic association).

3\. Nature-spirits and Ancestral Spirits (Animism).

4\. Communion of Life:

(*a*) the Word by the blood-soul, the god-in-the-blood; by the swearing
relics of a saint (*minn*, *mionn*, *i.e.* oath); by the virtue of the
elements, by the sun and moon; by the tribal god (*tong a toing mo
thuath*).

(*b*) the Word to the God (Prayer: *urnuigh*, *guidh*);

(*c*) the Word to the Soul:

(*a*) in the omen (*manadh*);

(*b*) in the portent (*tuar*);

(*c*) in the vision (*fīs*);

(α) in dreams (aisling);

(β) in second-sight (*taibhsearachd*, *an dà-shealladh*);

(γ) in prophetic knowledge (*dailgneachd*; *tairrngearacht*); *taisbein*
or revelation.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

5\. Sacrifice:

(*a*) partaking in thankfulness with the god (*uibhir aig Dia de
chuid*);

(*b*) giving to get (*do ut des*);

(*c*) giving to appease (do ut abeas).

6\. The God-land:

(*a*) the land of the young (*Tír na n-Ōg*); the island paradise;

(*b*) the conquest of the *Sīdh* and its joys (*oibinnius in t-sída*);

(*c*) the land of promise (*tír tairrngire*), the shadows of the
immortals; and the twilight of the gods.

The Word has freedom. It has also the danger that accompanies freedom:
it may be made an idol. Words are the manufacturers of idols. As 'spell,
taboo, charm' the word is *geas*, E. Irish *geis*, derived from the root
in the verb *guidh*, 'entreat' (Old Irish *guidiu*, *gude*, *guide*),
cognate with Gothic *bidjan* 'ask,' and English *bidding*, surviving in
'the bidding prayer.'

The potency of strong entreaty is witnessed to in the Highland saying:
'a witch will get her wish though her soul should not receive
mercy.' <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) Even the dead can take
fuller vengeance than the living, and the death-bed entreaty <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) binds the survivor.

The religious sentiment *includes* belief in the potency of the word.
Hence the easy and too common delusion that religion derives from magic.
To start with, religion embraces more than the magic word: hence a study
of all 'survivals' reveals

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

more than 'magic'; it shows acts and objects of faith in which the heart
either rests or works its way out of towards a more abiding content. The
rhythmic formula or *carmen* (whence *charm*), older *can-men*, in root
cognate with Gadhelic, *can*, 'to say,' had such occult power that,
according to Virgil, it could draw the moon from the sky. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) And so close is the connection between the
prayer and the spell that the word that once signified the former may be
degraded to signify the latter. One example is the following.

When a witch has bespelled a man, the modern Gadhelic phrase is: 'she
has put the *ōrth* (spell) in him.' <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)
This word, however, is but a loan from the Latin *orationem*; the
accusative in Early Irish is *orthain*, 'prayer,' in which sense the
word is met with on an Iona tombstone. As in everything else, there is
such a thing as deterioration in religion, as the above transition of
meaning manifests. One must guard against deriving religion from magic
or identifying it therewith. For 'charm, incantation,' the native word
is *obaidh*. <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) When a witch is
credited with having bespelled a man the Highlander says: 'she gave him
a word.' <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md) Connected of old with the
power of the word was that of the satirist, who could raise blotches on
the face or rhyme an enemy to death.

Further, the word could make the absent one visible by apparition: the
spell for this purpose is

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

known in Uist as *Fāth-Fīth*. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) Irish
has *fāth*, 'a kind of poem,' which I suggest is cognate with Cymric
*gwawd*, panegyric; O. English *wóet*; O. Norse *ōðr*, song, poetry,
metre. Near allied are Irish *fāith*, prophet, Latin *vates*, Gothic
*vōds*, man. With the side form *fīth* is to be compared the Welsh
*gwiddon*, 'a witch,' a word used in D. ab Gwilym's poems; the plural
occurs in 'Llys y Gwiddonod,' the Witches' Court, where the witches are
associated with prophecy and prediction in a way that allows them being
regarded as the authors. Rhŷs asks why the Gadhelic women warriors in
Gloucestershire were described in Welsh as witches (*gwiddonod*), and
adds: "It is unfortunate that the etymology of the word eludes my
search." <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) I believe it is from the
magic power of the word. *Fīth* has no connection with the term *fī*
still met with in the asseveration: *Gu’n gabh am Fī thu* = may the Evil
One take thee! Here *Fī* is cognate with Ir. *fī*, bad (Cormac,
O’Clery); (there is also *fī*, 'poison,' cognate with L. *vīrus*, Gr.
ἰός, Skr. *visha*). The power of the word is so great that a witch's
wish when expressed in words may produce *gonadh*, a wounding or wasting
away, which may take various forms; it is reputed by some to produce
even childlessness.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thus, on Eilean
Aigais, an island on the Beauly River (Uisge Farrar in the upper
reaches, but now Abhuinn na Manchuinne in the lower), it is said that a
woman was hung wrongously on a tree and eaten to death by the flies; ere
dying she pronounced a curse imprecating childlessness on those who
should hereafter live there, a curse that was held to have been
literally fulfilled. A deathbed entreaty (*corrachd*, <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18) Ir. *coruigheacht*.md) had special force
because of the revenant (*tathaich*) spirit which was credited with
power to injure the living. I've heard a person declare to another as to
coming back after death: 'when I rise up it is thou who wilt get the
first slap or blow' (*’nuair dh’ēireas mi’s tu gheobh a chiad sgailc*).

The positive side of the magic word leads to sorcery (*buitseachd*,
*draoidheachd*), the negative aspect includes the rites that are taboo
(*geas*); the positive precepts that are to be used are spells or charms
(*ōrtha*, *ōrthachan*; *ubagan*); the negative precepts are taboos
(*gessa*). The positive word of magic says 'do'; the negative word of
magic says 'don't.' It is assumed that all things are in sympathy, and
act on one another: things which have once been in contact continue to
act on each other even after the contact has been removed. Thus, a man I
knew of would never start from his home before sunrise to go on any
business without first

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

putting his left knee sunwise thrice round the horse's head. This sained
the animal and prevented it from seeing supernatural spirits, for it had
been in contact with a man who blessed it in name of the Trinity. Again,
like things produce like things; and thus, if you wish to injure a man,
injure something like him. This rests on a fallacy in elementary
reasoning; but much experience has been necessary to convince mankind of
errors which, however apparently simple, have issued in gross deeds. An
instance of this magic is that of 'turning-the-heart in lead' (*cridhe
luadhainn*, t*ionndadh cridhe*), which I have seen done in the Highlands
several times. A rite somewhat similar existed in the Austrian Tyrol,
and in parts of Germany, and J. Grimm traced it to Greece. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) In the Highlands, when a friend has
something the matter with the heart, a wise man who knows this
rite,—living at a distance makes no difference,—melts some lead which he
pours through a key taken from the outer door over a basin of cold
water, making mention of the heart of the person whom he names, and
invoking the Trinity: if the shapes as they form in the water can be got
to resemble a heart, much virtue ensues to the healing and strengthening
of the friend who is far off. The friend often knows that such a rite is
practised on his behalf, and that prayers of faith are offered for his
recovery.

Another rite which I have often heard of is that

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

of the clay-body (*corp criadh*), the magic of which rests on the
principle of similarity. It is fairly common in Celto-Latin lands. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) A figure is made of clay, and either the
whole or the parts which it is desired to injure are covered with pins
and nails to the accompaniment of maledictions; the image is then buried
in the ground or placed in a stream in a somewhat inaccessible locality,
on the principle that the sooner the clay-body dissolves, the sooner
will the body of the person thus represented be wrecked. For the Isle of
Man there is a good instance given where an image was turned before a
large fire, and pins stuck into it while a rhyme was being muttered,
coincident with which the minister was found suffering with wracking
pains. On a search having been made, the supposed effigy of the minister
was found, as also an old bladder, with pins, rusty nails and skewers.
This female practitioner was sentenced to be executed, "and just before
she was bound to the stake, confessed the crime for which she was about
to suffer." <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) In the Highlands there
are instances of quite recent occurrence. I quote from a reliable writer
of recent date, simply changing the spelling *Creagh* into *Criadh*, as
being more correct philologically:

“A rather gruesome relic of a barbarous age which I have heard of as
happening within the last few years, is that ugly one known as the *Corp
Criadh*. As its name indicates, this is a body of clay rudely shaped
into the image of the person

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

whose hurt is desired. After a tolerably correct representation is
obtained, it is stuck all over with pins and thorns, and placed in a
running stream. As the image is worn away by the action of the water,
the victim also wastes away with some mortal disease. The more pins are
stuck in from time to time, the more excruciating agony the unfortunate
victim suffers. Should, however, any wayfarer by accident discover the
*Corp* in the stream the spell is broken, and the victim duly recovers.
A case of *Corp Criadh* has been known to occur in Uist within the last
five years; and in a parish adjoining ours, it was whispered that the
death of a certain young man was due to a spell of this nature.

"Another case that was told to me was concerning a young woman who set
her affections upon a certain young man. But on this occasion Barkis was
not willing, and he would have none of her. To revenge herself for his
shocking want of taste, she resolved that if *she* was not fated to get
him, then neither would any possible rival. In this dog-in-the-manger
frame of mind, she made a *Corp Criadh* for the luckless youth. But it
so happened that one day a neighbour (who is the mother of my informant)
went into the girl's father's barn to look for some eggs, and hidden
among some hay she found, not eggs, but the *Corp*. There is reason to
believe that during the land agitation and strife which have of recent
years occupied the Highlands, the rite was practised in connection with
some of the land-leaguers who had made themselves obnoxious to their
fellows." <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The power of the 'word' is seen in magic charms to stop blood and
bleeding. Moore <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) gives instances for
the Isle of Man. And I know of instances where persons yet alive believe
in the Blood-spell, and have a charm for stanching blood (Eolas, Casga
Fola). In Sutherland, Ross and Inverness its efficacy depends on its
being transmitted from male to female, and from female to male.

In former times there was another term, not now used in the Highlands,
viz., Ir. *bricht*, 'magic, magical spell,' apparently the ceremonially
conceived word on which J. Grimm lays stress as the essential requisite
of the magic if it is to be effective. Osthoff would equate *bricht*
with Icel. *bragr*, 'poetry, art of poetry,' and with the Sanskrit
*brahman*, on the assumption that it means 'magic, witchcraft.' <span
id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md)

The power of the word even as acting at a distance is still tacitly
believed in: *e.g*. the phrase, *Cearr nam ban is deas nam fear*, is
repeated when there is a sudden reddening of one of the ears: if it be
the left ear, the inference is that it is women who are speaking about
you; if the right ear, that it is men.

The Greek for a word as something spoken was, μῦθος, 'anything delivered
by word of mouth, word, speech,' whence our 'myth.' The spoken word is
essential for religion. A South Pacific myth tells that when the Creator
of all things had ordered the solid land to rise from the primeval
waters, he

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

walked abroad to survey his work. "It is good," said he aloud to
himself. "Good," answered an echo from a neighbouring hill. "What!"
exclaimed the Creator, "Is some one here already? Am not I first?" "I
first," answered the echo. Therefore, the Mangaians assert, the earliest
of all existences is the bodiless voice. It is their way of saying, "In
the beginning was the Word." <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

Unless one named the day, a witch could hear one speaking of her on a
Friday even if far off. Hence one said: *an diu Di-h-aoine, cha chluinn
iad mi air muir no tir* = to-day is Friday; they will not hear me on sea
or land.

A parallel to this belief in the power within the word may be found in
the phrase: *Tha facal aice* = 'She has a word,' said of a witch who is
credited with power to cause one in virtue of her word to do her
bidding. One is reminded of the phrase used by the people when the
demoniac was cured at Capharnahum: τίσ ἐστι οὗτος λόγος, 'What sort of
word (or language) is this? for with authority and real power He gives
orders to the foul spirits and they come out' (Lc. 4:36). By λόγος, or
word, here the people may have meant some formula of exorcism, some
cabalistic 'word' which forced the demons to obey.

If such be the power of the magic word, how much more important is the
word which is or contains the name (*ainm*) itself! All the spells and
charms for averting the evil eye that are in use end by inserting the
name of the person to be cured, adding thereto the sanctifying clause:
in the Name of the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. To counteract evils the name is even changed. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) For the soul is regarded as in the name.
It is forbidden to awaken one who is suffering from night-mare
(*trom-laighe*) <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) unless one has first
summoned him by name. The inference is that his soul is away and is to
be called back by the ritual use of the person's name; the old folks
therefore enjoined one: *na dūisg e gun ghairm air ainm* = do not waken
him without calling him by name. To do otherwise is *gessa*, or taboo
now; at an earlier day, the fear was that a man might die, for his soul
was but a tenant of the body, not in any way in relation to or a result
of its functions.

I find with many that it is a matter of extreme importance to call a
child by the name of a deceased ancestor; death is but a minor affair so
long as the name is kept up. This is known as: *togail an ainm* =
lifting or raising the name (of the deceased relative). Perhaps it is
owing to some association of belief with the old idea of the name-soul
that so many saints had double names, *e.g*. Crimthann, 'wolf,' the
first name of St. Columcille, the 'church dove.' And many heroes of the
Fionn-Saga have double names. I have seen the custom of naming a child
after a deceased relative explained by the intention of securing rest in
his grave for the latter; the child when grown up was bound to brave the
influence which caused its relative's death. But on Celtic ground I have
not heard of such an explanation. The practice of "giving a new-born
babe

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the name of a deceased person is to be traced back in the old Icelandic
sagas, where a dying person often appeals to another to name a future
child after him, because he expected advantage from it." Mr. Hartland
infers that he thereby expected to secure a new birth. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) In the case of a child's death, if he has
borne the name of a deceased relative, it is often held unlucky in the
Highlands to give the same name to another child; but that is aside from
the main desire of 'raising the name.'

The Gadhelic *ainm*, 'name,' is cognate with Welsh *anu*, *enw*; Gr.
ὄνομα, Prussian *emmens*, Old Bulgarian *imȩ*, the root *ono* allied to
*no* in L. *nomen*, E. *name*.

In Wales English names were regarded as very unlucky for fishermen
(Trevelyan, 329).

Of great import of old was an asseveration by the name of the tribal
god. No doubt many Celtic god-names would have been kept secret, and it
is probable that often only epithets have survived. However that may be,
we find the phrase *tong a toing mo thuath* = 'I swear what my tribe
swears' (with an occasional variant, 'I swear by the god of my tribe')
of frequent occurrence in Irish literature: and if *tong* be cognate
with L. *tango*, 'I touch,' as it seems to be, the idea underlying is
that of 'touching ' some sacred thing, be it stone or something else,—a
habit continued in Christian days by taking the *mionn* or oath, E. Ir.
*mind*, 'oath, diadem,' by touching the swearing relics or insignia of a
saint. Cognate is O. Welsh *minn*, 'sertum'; MacBain compares O.H.G.
*menni*, 'neck

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

ornament,' Ag. S. *mene*, 'neck chain,' L. *monile*. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) How far the idea of the soul is expressed
under the sense of touch we will consider later under the custom of
'touching the corpse.'

It is of interest to notice that a prickly sensation in the nose is
known as *menmain*, a word which is but a variant of O. Ir. *menme*, g.
*menman*, 'mind, mens,' cognate with Skr. *mánman*, 'mind, thought,' L.
*mens*; also *memini*, 'remember,' E. *mean*, *mind*. The *menmain* is a
sensation which prognosticates the coming of a stranger or visitor. On
the other hand a secretion such as the saliva (*seile*) is of special
virtue in ratifying bargains or in curing warts: this is because
originally the spittle was conceived as possessing soul-force. At
markets I have noticed that bargains are still sealed by spitting on the
hand ere two parties clasp hands on coming to an agreement. I have heard
also of a belief that some of the Clan Campbell, through a certain
feeling in the eye-brow, foreknew of a Campbell's death. A sneeze
(*sreot*) is also a sort of omen: a 'spirit ' is thought to take
possession of one; when one sneezes involuntarily it was etiquette with
some

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

to say, 'God be with thee' (*Dia leat*). The kidney (*adha*, *ae*; O.
Ir. *óa*, *ae*; W. *afu*) is specially an organ of the soul, and there
are certain prescriptions regarding it: children must not partake of it
until they can pronounce the word or name for it (Inverness-shire); if
you eat a whole kidney it will come out on the body (Sutherland). From
its connection with the soul the skull or brain-pan (*copan cinn*) has
curative virtues: to drink water from the skull of a dead man is
believed in as a cure for epilepsy, and has been to my knowledge
faithfully carried out lately (1909). A draught of the spirit of human
skull was a part of the medical treatment in vogue in former times in
higher circles. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) Even the human hair
as associated with the idea of soul is beloved as a keepsake, and is
treasured as a remembrance in far-away lands. A stanza from a Highland
poem runs:

Tha t’fhalt-sa, ’ghaoil, na mo spliūcan rōin  
Is bithidh, a ghaoil, fhad s a bhios mi beō;  
’S ’nuair dh’fhalbhas triūir leam ’ga m’ ghiūlan chon an fhōd  
Bidh t’fhalt-sa cuide rium an ciste chaoil nam bōrd.

'Thy hair, oh darling, is in my pouch of seal-skin, and will be so long
as I live; and when three bear me away carrying me to the sod, thy hair,
my dear one, will be with me in the narrow chest of boards.'

The soul-life is thus held to be associated with parts of the full-grown
body. But even at birth the body has its ritual. One could say, before
birth, inasmuch as it is held to be unlucky for two women who are great
with child to come into the same room if either be near confinement. To

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

contravene this rule was *gessa* or taboo in the code of old Highland
midwives, who held that the infant of one of the parties must die or be
still-born (Inverness-shire). The after-birth had its special ritual. To
my knowledge the following was the belief held not so long ago: "The old
women were very careful of the after-birth; if it were burnt in the
wrong manner the wife would have no more children. The midwives had
great fear of this in case of taking away the lives of others. But if
the wife would eat the after-birth of another woman, the children would
come back. It was the custom of the late Mrs. G. (a certain midwife) to
cause women who for the first time became mothers bite the placenta
thrice. The mother thereafter would not suffer the pains of
childbirth." <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)

On no account was the after-birth to be carelessly thrown outside, lest
dogs should get it; it was to be decently buried under a tree or
carefully burnt. The old midwives sometimes were wont to keep a portion,
and this when roasted they ordered to be drunk with water in cases of
sterility. In Ireland I find that "an after-birth must be burned to
preserve the child from the fairies." <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) The omphalos <span
id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md) was in

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the Highlands ground to powder after it fell off on the ninth day or so,
and was mixed with water and given to the child to drink. The cord was
sacred, as it united the unborn infant to the life of the mother; it was
held to retain life in some mysterious manner. In Greece the navel or
omphalos is the symbol of the Earth-Mother; <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) for Brazil, Southey <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) says: "Immediately upon a woman's delivery
the father takes to his hammock, covers himself up, and is nurst there
till the navel string of the infant has dried away; the union between
him and his progeny is regarded as so intimate that care must be taken
of him lest the child should suffer." The omphalos was a favourite
amulet among the Crees, according to Mackenzie's *History of the Fur
Trade* (p. 86). Among American Indians it was a frequent custom to carry
it to a distance and bury it; in later life it was the individual's duty
to go alone to that spot and perform certain ceremonies. From other
parallels, therefore, I conclude that the Celtic ritual of the
navel-string was due to some connection with the life of the soul, as it
was imagined. "The navel-string and the placenta are often regarded as
external souls." <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_36.md) Blood drunk from
the child's navel and eating the dried remains of the navel-string

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

are approved folk-cures for sterility elsewhere. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

Further, among body-parts mythic thought interprets the soul as in the
eye (the Evil Eye).

The singular malific influence of a glance has been felt by most persons
in life; an influence that seems to paralyse intellect and speech,
simply by the mere presence in the room of some one who is mystically
anti-pathetic to our nature. For the soul is like a fine-toned harp that
vibrates to the slightest external force or movement, and the presence
and glance of some persons can radiate around us a divine joy, while
others may kill the soul with a sneer or frown. We call these subtle
influences mysteries, but the early races believed them to be produced
by spirits good or evil, as they acted on the nerves of the
intellect. <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md)

All races have a belief in the power of the eye which but expresses the
soul. The soul is not thought of as confined to any one single organ of
the body. The Romans spoke of the fascination of an evil tongue: *mala
fascinare lingua* (Catullus, vii. 12); *ne vati noceat mala lingua
futuro* (Virgil, *Bucol*. Ecl. vii. 28).

But the Romans <span id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md) were pre-eminently
familiar

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

with the evil eye and its cure; in Spain <span
id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) the evil eye is known as causing illness
(*querelar nasula*); Italy abounds with the belief; Sébillot <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) gives several instances of talismans used
for preserving one from the effects of the evil eye (*à la préserver du
mauvais oeil*). The evil eye is due to soul-magic. In Scotland it is
well known; suffice it to refer to the collections on this topic by the
late Rev. J. G. Campbell <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md) and by Dr.
R. C. Maclagan. <span id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43.md) Young infants are
frequently believed to be overlooked; likewise cattle; a man may lay the
evil eye even on what is his own property, as when a husband must on no
account see the churning operations, as his glance would prevent the
butter coming. The great remedy is *būrn* *airgid*, 'water into which
silver coins have been put,' as also gold and copper if you like, but
silver by all means. The water has to be raised with a wooden ladle from
a stream over which pass the living and the dead, in the name of the
Trinity; the sign of the cross is made over the contents of the ladle,
and a rhyme is repeated wherein the opening word of the Lord's Prayer,
*Pater*, in G. *Paidir*, is repeated seven times, but alternately in
name of the Virgin and of the King (or Lord). Then the ritual says: "In
the door of the city (of heaven, *i.e.*) Christ gave three calls full
just: seven 'paters' in name of the Virgin will avert the evil eye,
whether it be on human creature

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

or on brute: whoso hath laid on thee the eye, may it return on
themselves or on their children, and, if children fail, on their
substance: \[the person's name here\], may’st thou be in thy full
health, in name of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) The water is then partly given as a drink
to the child, partly sprinkled over it, and the rest is poured out over
a large stone or boulder that is never moved by human hands. When rents
make their appearance in such stones, these are ascribed to the
penetrating and disintegrating force of envy, and the saying goes: 'Envy
breaks up the stone' (*brisidh farmad a chlach*). From the kind of coins
that may adhere to the wooden ladle on being emptied, and from their
position, some of the wise ones would divine whether the evil eye in the
special case was that of a male or female. Such is the ritual of
averting the evil eye in Strathglass neighbourhood. I now give an
example or two from S. Uist, which I owe the late Rev. Allan MacDonald.

"If a person came and saw a cow or other creature belonging to you, and
he began to praise it, *e.g*. if he were to say, *tha ùth mór aig a’
bhoin*, 'the cow has a big udder,' or anything similar

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

of a complimentary nature, this act of praising was called
*aibhseachadh*; and as it might lead accidentally to *gonadh*, or evil
eye, or wounding of the cattle, as a preventative it was customary to
say to the person making the complimentary remarks: *Fliuch do shūil* =
'wet your eye.' This wetting of the eye was generally performed by
moistening the tip of the finger with saliva, and moistening the eye
with it thereafter.

"If a person were much afflicted by the *toradh*, or 'milk produce,'
being taken from him, he was advised to adopt the following remedy:
Whenever one of his cows calves, to take away the calf immediately
before he draws milk from his dam, then to take a bottle and draw milk
from the four teats into the bottle, the person so doing being on one
knee, and saying:

Gum beannaicheadh Dia na cŭilean <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md)
so  
Tha mise ’g iarraidh so ’n ainm Dhia  
S cha n eil mi ’g iarraidh ach mo chuid fhéin.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The bottle is then
tightly corked and hidden in a safe place. Here is a magic way of
retaining the whole by keeping the part. If the cork were to be put in
loosely, it is feared that the *toradh* would be at the mercy of any one
who had the faculty of filching it. Another Uist informant, Duncan
M‘Innes, said that he heard the effective way of recovering the *toradh*
was to snatch a bundle of thatch from the threshold of a suspected
person and to burn it beneath a churn (*Tubhadh an* 

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

*fhardoruis a thoirt leat s a losgadh fo thōin a chrannachain*); and
John Mackinnon, Dalibrog, said: *Na’n cailleadh to ’n dul air ceann na
buaraich chailleadh to ’n toradh* = 'If you were to lose the loop on the
end of the cow-tie, you would lose the milk-produce."'

A further stage of the concept of the Body-Soul is that of Blood Magic
or *the Soul in the Blood*. The connection of the soul-life with the
blood would naturally have been perceived from of old. Once the body was
drained of the blood death ensued. The Irish collection of Church Canons
quotes Lactantius <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) as to the nature
of the soul, where he states that some held the soul to be fire, others
said it was spirit, others that it was blood: fire, for it vivifies the
body; spirit, for it breathes through the members; blood, for with the
blood the soul passes away. Such speculations might have become known
among some of the people, but their appeal to the folk-mind, in so far
as blood is concerned, would have been easy. For, as Faust, who
covenants in blood with Mephistopheles, says: "Blood is a juice of very
special kind,"—so much so that in Vedic ritual sprinkling by blood is
practised to lay evil spirits, while in the Highlands the blood of a
black cock is spilled at the spot where the demon of epilepsy first made
its presence manifest. A blood-mark connected with a foul deed was held
in the Highlands to be impossible to be wiped out. To drink blood was an
earnest token of true love. A

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

lady who entertained Prince Charlie in Harris became full of sorrow on
hearing of her lover having been drowned on his way to marry her, and
she sang in lines which I may render thus:

Would, my God, I were near thee, my love,  
  on what bank soe’er or creek thou art cast;  
My liking, oh love! were thy body's blood,  
  and the red wine of Spain were nothing to me,  
Will they, nill they, my drink were thy blood,  
  the blood that is flowing from out of thy breast,  
The blood of thy body, dear love, I love best.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again, in
literature there is the case of Gregor MacGregor of Glenstrae, put to
death at Kenmore by Sir Colin Campbell, who became laird of Glenorchy in
1550 and proved himself a bitter foe to Clan Gregor. Sir Colin caused
his daughter's husband, Gregor of Glenstrae, with whom she eloped, and
whom she married against her father's will, to be executed at Kenmore in
1570. A brother of hers also took the father's side. To escape vengeance
Gregor and herself and child had to wander about, but were at last
captured, and she was forced to witness her husband's execution at
Taymouth Castle. In her cry for vengeance on the head of the
perpetrator, she says:

Would that Taymouth and Finlarig  
  were a-flame,—razed to the ground;  
And Gregor's white palms, O Gregor the fair,  
  clasped in mine arms around.

No apples have I to-day, to-day,  
  though apples for others there be;  
My apple so sweet, my apple, my meat,  
  lying in cold earth is he.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To her bairn,
fearing lest he may not attain manhood

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

to execute vengeance for the deed, she croons sadly:

On Lammas morn and early  
  my love and I were merry;  
But ere the sun came to mid of day  
  mine heart was heavy, heavy.

On high-born kith and kindred  
  my curse for my sorrow's plight;  
By stealth my love was taken  
  and unawares by might.

Were twelve there of his kindred  
  with Gregor at their head,  
Mine eyes were not a-shedding tears  
  my bairnie friendless made.

On a block of oak they set his head,  
  they shed his blood with a will;  
On the ground they spilt it, and had I a cup  
  I would of it have quaffed my fill. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md)

Martin, in his *Western Isles*, says of the islanders: "Their ancient
leagues of friendship were ratified by drinking a drop of each other's
blood, which was commonly drawn out of the little finger. This bond was
religiously observed as a sacred bond; and if any person after such an
alliance happened to violate the same, he was from that time reputed
unworthy of all honest men's conversation." <span
id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

The *cro-codaig* or blood-covenant was known among the Gael of old. Thus
Branduff, king of Leinster, in 598 A.D., as he was preparing to fight
the king of Ireland, met a party of Ulidians, whom he induced to abandon
the king of Ireland and fight under Branduff's own standard in the
battle of Dunbolg. The king of Ulidia replied: "A blood-covenant
(*cro-codaig*) and an agreement shall be made between us." "They seated
themselves on the mountain and made a *cotach* or bond of fellowship
that should never be broken." The name of the mountain, formerly Sliabh
Nechtain, was afterwards changed to *Sliabh Codaig*, 'the mountain-slope
of the covenant'—the present *Slieve Gadae* (the old name slightly
corrupted) on the road from Hollywood to Donard, Wicklow.

The Ulaid, hereditary enemies to the race of
Conn-of-the-Hundred-Battles, were glad to desert, and Conchobar, their
king, is said to have had a vision regarding this blood-covenant, as is
told in the story of the Boromean tribute:

I beheld a vat of crystal, with splendour of gold.  
By me, on the midst of my house, in Bregia, at the Boyne,  
A third of the vat (was filled) with the bloods of men, strange
assembly!  
There was but one third of new milk, in its midst,  
Another third was noble (?) wine, strange to me!  
Men with bowed heads surrounded it (men who had come over a clear
sea). <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md)

Conchobar beheld the Leinster men and the Ulaid around the vat, drinking
its contents. "And I know," said the king of the Ulaid, "that this is
the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

covenant that was foretold therein. For this is the blood that was seen
in the vat,—the blood of the two provinces in meeting. This is the new
milk—the canon of the Lord, which the clerics of the two provinces
recite. This is the wine, Christ's Body and His Blood, which the clerics
offer up." And he was explaining it in that wise, and he uttered a lay:

Make for us a covenant, let it be for ever!  
With the 'trees of wine,' with the kings from Liffey. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

The poet Spenser relates that during his stay in Ireland he saw a woman
at Limerick drink the blood of her foster-son on his having been
executed. He saw her "take up his head whilst he was being quartered,
and suck up the blood that ran from it, saying that the earth was not
worthy to drink it, and steep her face and breast with it, at the same
time tearing her hair, and crying out and shrieking most terribly." And
we have Highland evidence. In a song composed to a Macdonald warrior
after the battle of Cairinish in 1601, his foster-mother sings:

Thy body's blood flagrantly  
  a-soaking thy linen  
And I myself sucking it  
  till hoarse were my breath.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Another singer
says:

Thy wounds I did staunch  
  and many were they;  
Thine heart's blood I drank,—  
  sweeter than wine, I will say.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in a
well-known Hebridean song to Ailean Donn there is a direct mention of
blood-drinking:

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "I could drink,
though to the aversion of others, not of the red wine of Spain, but of
the blood of thy body after being drowned." <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)

Irish references pointing to the idea of the soul in the blood may be
met with, as we read of bursts of blood from the tips and nostrils of
the man who knew that King Eochaid had the ears of a horse;  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) of a swelling which grew from the head of
the lad who knew the secret of King Labraid's ears; <span
id="fr_53"></span>[3](#fn_53.md) of washing in the blood of a king for
leprosy. <span id="fr_54"></span>[4](#fn_54.md) And the late Dr. Wilde, in
his account of Irish folk-remedies, mentions the blood of the Welshes as
well as that of the Keoghs and Cahills as a cure. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[5](#fn_55.md) In Lewis blood taken from above the
patient's ankles was given as recently as in 1909 with a view to curing
epilepsy,—an instance I formerly only tentatively included in the
Appendix to my treatment of the *Norse Influence on Celtic Scotland*,
but I am aware that it need not be due to any outside influence although
blood-brotherhood is likewise met with in Scandinavia. Du Chaillu, in
his *Viking Age* (ii. 64), quotes from Egil and Asmund's *Saga* (ch. 6),
and says: "They took oaths that whoever lived the longest should have a
mound thrown up over the other, and place therein as much property as
seemed to him

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

fitting, and the survivor had to sit with the dead one for three nights,
and then depart if he liked. Then both drew their blood and let it flow
together; this was then regarded as an oath." Blood-brotherhood in the
Highlands was not extinct at least until after Iain Lom's time; for
tradition has it that by origin he was not of Lochaber lineage, but that
owing to a peculiar circumstance his father fled to Lochaber from Argyll
and made blood-brotherhood (*fuil-bhrāithreachais*) with the Campbells’
deadly enemies, the Macdonalds. Iain Lom Macdonald was Gadhelic poet
laureate to Charles II. I am now only concerned with the tradition that
blood-brotherhood was practised in his age, even if the story in detail
may, at least at a first consideration, be at variance with the poet's
received pedigree.

It is said that the poet had no hair at his birth, nor afterwards, and
that accordingly he was given the epithet *lom*, or 'bare, without
hair.' Such cases are rare, but I know personally of one. Briefly, the
story is that Iain Lom's mother was a MacCalmain from Muckairn, who
married one Campbell, who resided near to or in Kilmartin, Argyll. This
Campbell in a quarrel stabbed another Campbell who, on his round as
*deachadoir* or tithe-collector, insulted Mrs. MacCalmain Campbell. The
upshot was that she and her husband fled and took refuge with the
Campbells’ enemies, and specially under the banner of Macdonell of
Keppoch, who initiated them into his own clan by the rite of
blood-brotherhood (*rinn iad fuil-bhrāithreachais riutha*). The child
born to them soon thereafter was the future Iain Lom Macdonald the poet,
and

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

named after the Macdonalds. Said Keppoch to his father: "The more
Campbells you kill the better." The poet became more Macdonald than the
Macdonalds themselves.

This tradition I heard recited by Dr. Alex. Carmichael at a meeting of
Lorne men in Glasgow, when the lecturer was Mr. Malcolm Campbell
Macphail, the Glenorchy Bard, and a native of Muckairn. It was accepted.
And I take the tradition as pointing to the belief in the
soul-in-the-blood, which is the basis of the solemn covenant blood-rites
of many peoples. Stanley tells how he often had to take part in the rite
of blood-brotherhood in Africa, and Trumbull's *Blood Covenant* gives
many instances. Its force among the Irish of old is apparent from *The
Wooing of Emer*: when Cūchulainn wounded his love, Dervorgil, in the
form of a sea-bird, with a stone from his sling, he contracted
blood-brotherhood by sucking from the wound the stone with a clot of
blood round it. "I cannot wed thee now," he said, "for I have drunk thy
blood. But I will give thee to my companion here, Lug-aid of the Red
Stripes." <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md)

The artificial tie of blood-brotherhood being reckoned a barrier to
marriage pertains to a matriarchal stage of society, wherein descent is
reckoned on the mother's side, and where the father is not reckoned as
belonging to the kin of his children. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) The father is not akin to his child. It is
the ethic of this stage that is reflected in such a tale as Conlaoch
killing his own father Cūchulainn: the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

son avenges his mother's kin upon his own father. It is a stage which
has its own strata of explanations of such things as conception,
generation and the origin of the soul. The custom of foster-brotherhood
conceivably may have had its origin herein: the child is put out to be
fostered among its mother's kin, and out of the father's house. Until
capable of bearing arms it is taboo for the child to appear in his
father's presence: it is prohibited for the warrior to have any
sympathetic association with the weakness of youth. Even the
marriage-ring might be held to be a remnant of some old custom of
binding the blood-covenant upon the hand.

theology in Pythagoras (*Prolegomena*, 262) and points to indications of
Mother-Right in St. Augustine (*ib*. 261<sup>n</sup>) "Matriarchy gave
women a magical prestige," says Miss Harrison (*ib*. 285, cf. 272).

<span id="fn_9"></span>[8:1](sbc03.htm#fr_9.md) The L. *religi*o implies
carefulness and diligence in things pertaining to rites of devotion; it
is the very opposite of negligence. The recent attempt to connect it
with *religare* in the sense of 'binding the god' is erroneous to my
thinking.

Joyce has suggested that here we have the origin of the words which head
St. Patrick's hymn *Faeth Fiada* (with the *d* aspirated?), long
rendered as the guardsman's cry, the deer's cry, but really a 'spell'
for rendering invisible. The story of the deer may have arisen from a
folk-etymon. When Patrick, with his eight companions, went before King
Loigaire, the king saw but eight deer and a fawn making for the wilds.
The monarch returned to Tara in the morning twilight, disheartened and
ashamed. For *Transformation into Animal Form*, v. ch. ii.

thee a stipulation not to be broken; while for Lorne I got the phrase:
*chuir e cōrachd air a theangaidh*, 'he spoke as if he disguised or hid
his speech,' which must be a secondary meaning; in any case it is not
mine, which is invariably 'a death-bed entreaty.'

<span id="fn_29"></span>[21:1](sbc03.htm#fr_29.md) The power of the word as
seen in the curse is evidenced by the Manx phrase *Mollaght Mynney*,
which Moore (*Folk-Lore of the Isle of Man*, 11<sup>n</sup>) says, "is
the bitterest curse in our language, that leaves neither root nor
branch, like the Skeabthoan, the besom of destruction." It seems to
originate from the old custom of swearing by the relics of a saint, for
the word is different from Manx *Monney*, 'a sign, an omen, a portent,'
G. *manadh*, 'omen.' Noticeable also is the reference in this Manx oath
to sun and moon (*ry ghrian as eayst*), met with also in present-day
Ireland: *dar brígh na gréine ’s na gealaighe*, 'by the virtue or
essence of the sun and of the moon' (*Lúb na Caillighe*, p. 20; ed. S.
