### <span class="smallcaps">The Troubles Between Lord Kintail and Glengarry</span>.

The year of God 1602, the Lord Kintail, and his kin the Clan Kenzie,
fell at variance with the Laird of Glengarry (one of the Clan Donald),
who, being unexpert and unskilful in the laws of the realms, the Clan
Kenzie intrapped and insnared him within the compass thereof, and
charged him, with a number of his men and followers, to compear before
the Justice at Edinburgh, they having, in the meantime, slain two of his
kinsmen. Glengarry, not knowing or neglecting the charges, came not to
Edinburgh at the prefixed day, but went about, at his own hand, to
revenge the slaughter of his kinsmen. Thereupon, the Lord of Kintail, by
his credit in Council, doth purchase a commission against Glengarry and
his countrymen; which, being obtained, Kintail (with the assistance of
the next adjoining neighbours, by virtue of his Commission) went into
Morar (which appertained to Glengarry), and wasted all that country;
then, in his return from Morar, he besieged the Castle

of Strome, which, in the end, he took, by treason of the Captain unto
whom Glengarry had committed the custody thereof. Afterward, the Clan
Kenzie did invade Glengarry's eldest son, whom they killed with forty of
his followers, not without some slaughter of the Clan Kenzie likewise.
In end, after great slaughter on either side, they came to an agreement,
wherein Glengarry (for to obtain his peace) was glad to requite and
renounce to the Lord of Kintail, the perpetual inheritance of the
Strome, with the lands adjacent.
