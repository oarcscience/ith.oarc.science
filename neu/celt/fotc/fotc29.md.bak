### <span class="smallcaps">The Brig of Dee</span>.

The year of God 1588, there were some secret emulations and factions at
Court. The Earl of Huntly being in favour with His Majesty, obtained the
Captaincy of His Majesty's Guards, which the Master of Glamis had
before; for this cause the Master of Glamis and his associates, joining
themselves to the English Ambassador, then lying at Edinburgh, do
surmise to the King's Majesty, that some letters of the Earl of
Huntly's, sent by him to the King of Spain, were intercepted in England.
Huntly was called to make his answer; he compears, and denies these
letters to have been written or sent by him, but only devised by his
enemies, thereby to put him in disgrace with his master; yet Ile is
warded in the Castle of Edinburgh in the latter end of February, and
being tried, he is released the 7th day of March following; whereupon
the Earls of Huntly, Crawford, and Errol, address themselves into the
North, and take journey towards St. Johnstown, where they were
advertised that the Earls

of Athol and Morton and the Master of Glamis had convened forces to
entrap them within St. Johnstown. Huntly, Errol, and Crawford issued
forth of that town, with such small companies as they then had, and
rencountered with the Master of Glamis, whom they chased and apprehended
in Kirkhill, and carried him prisoner with them into the North.

Chancellor Maitland and the rest of the Master of Glamis's faction at
Court, hearing of this accident, they inflame the King with anger
against Huntly and his associates, and do persuade His Majesty to take a
journey into the North. Huntly, in the meantime, assembles all his
friends and dependants, to the number of 10,000 men, and came forward to
the Brig of Dee, with a resolution to fight against his enemies, the
20th of April, the year 1589; but being certainly informed that the King
was coming in person against him, he dissolved his army, and submitted
himself to His Majesty, withal releasing the Master of Glamis from
captivity; whereupon Huntly was committed to ward at Edinburgh, then at
Borthwick, thereafter at Finnerin; from

whence he was shortly afterward released by His Majesty. The Earl of
Errol was also warded in Edinburgh Castle, where he was detained until
he paid a sum of money, which was employed to the use of Chancellor
Maitland.
