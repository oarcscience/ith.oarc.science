### <span class="smallcaps">The Burning of the Dornoch Cathedral</span>.

John, Earl of Sutherland, together with his lady, being poisoned, the
year 1567, his son Alexander (being young) succeeded unto him, whose
ward and marriage George, Earl of Caithness, had right to, and withal
gets the custody of Earl Alexander during the time of his ward; whereat
Alexander's most tender friends (and chiefly the Murrays of Sutherland)
being grieved, they lay a plot among themselves to convey Earl Alexander
from the Earl of Caithness; which they effect, and deliver him to the
Earl of Huntly, with whom he stayed until his ward was expired, the year
1573, during which time the Earl of Caithness kept possession of the
land; whereupon divers troubles did ensue. The Earl of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Caithness removed
the Murrays of Sutherland from their possessions; which, nevertheless,
they endeavoured to keep. Hutcheon Murray, with divers of his friends,
do possess themselves with the town of Dornoch and the adjacent lands,
being formerly possessed by them. The Earl of Caithness sent his son
John, Master of Caithness, with a number of men to remove the Murrays
from Dornoch. Y Mackay did also accompany the Master of Caithness in his
journey. Being come to Dornoch, they besiege the Murrays there; who, for
the space of some days, issued forth and skirmished with the enemy. In
end, the Master of Caithness burnt the town and the cathedral church,
which the inhabitants could not longer defend. Yet, after the town was
lost, they kept the Castle, the enemy still assaulting them, but in
vain, without any success, for the space of a month. Then, by the
mediation of some indifferent friends, they surrendered the Castle, and
gave three pledges that, within two months, they should depart from
Sutherland; which they did, and retired themselves to the Earl of
Huntly, with whom they stayed

until the expiring of the Earl Alexander's ward; at which time they
recovered their ancient possessions. Notwithstanding that the Murrays
had retired themselves as they had promised, yet they were no sooner
departed but the pledges were beheaded.

During the time that the Sutherland men stayed with the Earl of Huntly,
they served him in his wars against the Forbeses, and chiefly at
Crabstaine, where they did good service against the foot supply that was
sent by the Regent to assist the Forbeses. This burning of Dornoch and
of the Cathedral church happened in the year of God 1570. The next year
following (which was 1571), George, Earl of Caithness, became jealous of
some plots which his eldest son John, Master of Caithness, and Y Mackay
of Strathnaver had contrived against him, and thereupon apprehended his
son John, whom he imprisoned closely at Girnigo, where he died after
seven years’ captivity. Y Mackay, perceiving that John, Master of
Caithness, was imprisoned by his father, he retired home into
Strathnaver, and died within six months thereafter, the same year of God
1571.
