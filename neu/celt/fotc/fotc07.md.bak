### <span class="smallcaps">The Conflict of Bealach-na-Broigh</span>.

About the year of God 1299, there was an insurrection made against the
Earl of Ross by some of the people of that province, inhabiting the
mountains, called Clan Iver, Clan-tall-wigh, and Clan-Leawe. The Earl of
Ross made such diligence that he apprehended their captain, and
imprisoned him at Dingwall, which so incensed the Highlanders that they
pursued the Earl of Ross's second son at Balnagown, took him and carried
him along prisoner with them, thinking thereby to get their captain
relieved. The Munroes and the Dingwalls, with some other of the Earl of
Ross's dependers, gathered their forces, and pursued the Highlanders
with all diligence; so, overtaking them at Bealach-na-Broig, betwixt
Ferrindounell and Lochbrime, there ensued a cruel fight, well fought on
either side. The Clan Iver, Clan-tall-wigh, and Clan-Leawe, were almost
all utterly extinguished; the Munroes had a sorrowful victory, with
great loss of their men, and carried back again the Earl of Ross's son.
The Laird of Kildun was there slain, with seven score of the surname of
Dingwall. Divers

of the Munroes were slain in this conflict; and among the rest, there
were killed eleven of the house of Fowlis, that were to succeed one
another, so that the succession of Fowlis fell unto a child then lying
in his cradle, for which service the Earl of Ross gave divers lands to
the Munroes and the Dingwalls.
