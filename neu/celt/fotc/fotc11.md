### <span class="smallcaps">The Conflict of Lon-Harpasdal</span>.

The year of God 1426, Angus Dow Mackay, with his son Neil, enters
Caithness with all hostility, and spoiled the same. The inhabitants of
Caithness assembled with all diligence, and fought with Angus Dow Mackay
at Harpasdal, where there was great slaughter on either side. Whereupon
King James I. came to Inverness, of intention to pursue Angus Dow Mackay
for that and other such like enormities. Angus Dow, hearing that the
King was at Inverness, came and submitted himself to the King's mercy,
and gave his son Neil in pledge of his good obedience in time coming,
which submission the King accepted, and sent Neil Mackay to remain in
captivity in the Bass; who, from thence, was afterwards called Neil
Wasse Mackay.
