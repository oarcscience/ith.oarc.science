### <span class="smallcaps">The Conflict of Embo</span>.

About the year of God 1259, the Danes and Norwegians did land at the
ferry of Unes, with a resolution to invade Sutherland and the
neighbouring provinces, against whom William, Earl of Sutherland, made
resistance, and encountered with them betwixt the town of Dornoch and
the ferry at Unes, at a place called Embo. After a sharp conflict the
Danes are overthrown, their general slain, with many others, and the
rest chased to their ships; in memory of which a monument of stone was
there erected, which was called Righ-Chrois, that is, the king's or
general's cross, which, together with divers burials, is there to be
seen at this day.
