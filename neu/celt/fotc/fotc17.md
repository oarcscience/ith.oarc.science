### <span class="smallcaps">The Crowner Slain by the Keiths in the Chapel of St. Tayre</span>.

About the year of God 1478, there was some dissension in Caithness
betwixt the Keiths and the Clan Gunn. A meeting was appointed for their
reconciliation, at the Chapel of St. Tayre, in Caithness, hard by
Girnigo, with twelve horse on either side. The Crowner (chieftain of the
Clan Gunn) with the most part of his sons and chief kinsmen came to the
chapel, to the number of twelve; and as they were within the chapel at
their prayers, the Laird of Inverugie and Ackergill arrived there with
twelve horse, and two men upon every horse; thinking it no breach of
trust to come with twenty-four men, seeing they had but twelve horses as
was appointed. So the twenty-four gentlemen rushed in at

the door of the chapel, and invaded the Crowner and his company
unawares; who, nevertheless, made great resistance. In the end the Clan
Gunn were all slain, with the most of the Keiths. Their blood may be
seen at this day upon the walls within the Chapel of St. Tayre, where
they were slain. Afterwards William Mackames (the Crowner's grandchild)
in revenge of his grandfather, killed George Keith of Ackergill and his
son, with ten of their men, at Drummuie in Sutherland, as they were
travelling from Inverugie into Caithness.
