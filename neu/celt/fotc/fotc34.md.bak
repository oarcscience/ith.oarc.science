### <span class="smallcaps">Troubles in the Island of Raasay In 1611</span>.

In the month of August, 1611, there happened an accident in the Isle of
Raasay, which is among the West Isles, where GilleCallum, Laird of
Raasay, and Murdoch Mackenzie (son to the Laird of Gairloch), with some
others, were slain, upon this occasion. The lands of Gairloch did
sometime pertain to the Lairds of Raasay, his predecessors, and

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

when the surname of Clan Kenzie began first to rise and to flourish, one
of them did obtain the third part of Gairloch in wadset; and thus once
getting footing therein, shortly thereafter, doth purchase a pretended
right to the whole, which the lawful inheritors did neglect; whereby, in
process of time, the Clan Kenzie do challenge the whole, whereof the
Laird of Gairloch, his father, obtains the possession, excluding the
Laird of Raasay and his kin, the Clan Vic-GilleChallum, whom .Gairloch
and the Clan Kenzie did pursue with fire and sword, and chased them out
of Gairloch. In like manner, the Clan Vic-GilleChallum invaded the Laird
of Gairloch and his country with spoils and slaughters. In end, the
Laird of Gairloch apprehended John Mac Allan, and chased John Tolmach,
two principal men of the race of Clan Vic-GilleChallum, and near cousins
to the Laird of Raasay, at which skirmish there was slaughter on either
side, the year of God 1610. The Laird of Gairloch, not fully satisfied
herewith, he sent his son Murdoch, accompanied with Alexander Bane (son
and heir to Alexander Bane of Tulloch), and

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

some others, to search and pursue John Tolmach; and to this effect he
did hire a ship (which then, by chance, happened to lie upon that coast)
to transport his son Murdoch, with his company, into the Isle of Skye,
where he understood John Tolmach to be at that time. But how soon
Murdoch, with his company, were embarked, they turned their course
another way, and (whether of set purpose, or constrained thereto by
contrary winds, I know not) arrived at the Isle of Raasay, running
headlong to their own destruction. The Laird of Raasay, perceiving the
ship in the harbour, went aboard to buy some wines and other
commodities, accompanied with twelve men. How soon Murdoch did see them
coming, he, with all his company (lest they should be known or seen),
went to the lower rooms of the ship, until the other party had gone
away. The Laird of Raasay entered the ship, and, having spoken the
mariner, he departed with a resolution to return quickly. Murdoch,
understanding that they were gone, came out of the lower rooms, and
perceiving them come again, he resolved not to conceal himself any
longer. The Laird

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of Raasay desired his brother, Murdoch MacGilleChallum, to follow him
into the ship with more company, in another galley, that they might
carry to the shore some wine and other provisions which he had resolved
to buy from the mariner; so the Laird of Raasay, returning to the ship,
and finding Gairloch's son there, beyond his expectations, he adviseth
with his men, and thereupon resolveth to take him prisoner, in pledge of
his cousin, John MacAllan, whom Gairloch detained in captivity. They
began first to quarrel, then to fight in the ship, which continued all
day long. In the end, the Laird of Raasay was slain, and divers of his
men; so was Murdoch, the son of Gairloch, and Alexander Bane killed,
with their whole company, three only excepted, who fought so manfully
that they killed all those that came into the ship with the Laird of
Raasay, and hurt a number of those that were with Murdoch
MacGilleChallum in two galleys hotly pursuing them. At last, feeling
deadly hurt, and not able to endure any longer, they sailed away with
prosperous wind, and died shortly thereafter.
