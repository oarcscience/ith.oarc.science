### <span class="smallcaps">The Conflicts of Allt-Gamhna and Leckmelm</span>.

The year of God 1585, George, Earl of Caithness, married the Earl of
Huntly's sister; at which time, by Huntly's mediatior, the Earls of
Sutherland and Caithness were reconciled. It was then concluded among
them that the Clan Gunn should be pursued and invaded by the Earls of
Sutherland and Caithness, because they were judged to be the chief
authors of the troubles which were then like to ensue; and to this
effect it was resolved that two companies of men should be sent by the
Earls of Sutherland and Caithness against such of the Clan Gunn as dwelt
in Caithness, thereby to compass them, that no place of retreat might be
left unto them, which was done. The Earl of Sutherland's company was
conducted by John Gordon of Backies and James MacRorie; the Earl of
Caithness's company was conducted by his cousin, Henry Sinclair—a
resolute gentleman. It happened that Henry Sinclair and his company
rencountered first with the Clan Gunn, who were now assembled together
at

a, hill called Bingrime, and with them was William Mackay (brother to
Hugh Mackay of Strathnaver, and nephew to this Henry Sinclair that led
the Caithness men) who was accompanied with some Strathnaver men. Now
were the Clan Gunn advertised of this preparation made against them; and
no sooner were they in sight of one another but they prepared both for
the fight, which was begun without fear or delay on either side. The
Clan Gunn, although inferior in number, yet they had the advantage of
the hill, by reason of which the Caithness men came short with their
first flight of arrows; by the contrary, the Clan Gunn spared their shot
until they came hard by the enemy, which then they bestowed among them
with great advantage. Then ensued a sharp conflict, at a place called
Allt-gamhna, where Henry Sinclair was slain with 120 of his company, and
the rest chased and put to flight, who had all been destroyed had not
the darkness of the night favoured their flight. Which, coming to the
ears of John Gordon, James MacRorie, and Neil MacIan-MacWilliam, who had
the conduct of the Earl of Sutherland's men, they pursued

the Clan Gunn, and followed them to Lochbroom, in the height of Ross,
whither they had fled; and then, meeting with them, they invade them at
a place called Leckmelm. After a sharp skirmish, the Clan Gunn were
overthrown, and chased, 32 of them slain, and their Captain, George,
wounded and taken prisoner, whom they carry along with them unto
Dunrobin, and there they deliver him unto Alexander, Earl of Sutherland.
This happened in the year of God 1586.
