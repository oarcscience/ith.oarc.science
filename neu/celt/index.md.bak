Some of these books and texts are translations of Celtic legends and
sagas; others are retellings of the material, folklore, or literary
works based on Celtic themes. During the 19th and early 20th Century
there was a resurgence of interest in the folklore of Ireland, Wales and
Scotland. This was reflected in a huge amount of literature based on the
rich Celtic mythopoetic heritage, most of it very faithful to the
original material, some in a more modern voice.

A good number of these files were originally scanned by Phillip Brown
for his (now defunct) Celtic Folklore website. These are indicated by
\[PB\].
