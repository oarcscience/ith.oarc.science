<P>CYNAN, the exciter of battle,<BR>
Bestowed on me treasure,<BR>
For not false the glory<BR>
Of the stout hunting dogs of the domain.<BR>
A hundred steeds of equal pace,<BR>
Silver their covering.<BR>
A hundred legions in green<BR>
Of one front running together.<BR>
A hundred urchins in my bosom.<BR>
10 And a battalion of cats.<BR>
A sword with sheath of stone.<BR>
A fist-cell better than any.<BR>
A hundred Cynan had,<BR>
Hateful not to see,<BR>
From the vales of Cadell.<BR>
In battle they were not shaken.<BR>
To the battle on Wy there resorted<BR>
Spears innumerable.<BR>
The Gwentians were slain,<BR>
20 With the gore-drenched blade.<BR>
A battle in Mona, great, fair,<BR>
Hovering over, and praised<BR>
Over the Menei, there went<BR>
Horses and confident ones. <A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A><BR>
A battle on the hill of Dyved.<BR>
Slaughter stings in motion.<BR>
Nor were seen<BR>
The kine before the countenance of any one.<BR>
Let the son of Brochuael boast,<BR>
30 He will declare his wish.<BR>
Let Cornwall greet,<BR>
The younger will not praise fate.<BR>
The incomprehensible will depress<BR>
In the day that is praised by me,<BR>
My patron of Cynan.<BR>
Battles arose.<BR>
A woeful spreading flame,<BR>
There raises up a great fire.<BR>
A battle in the country of Brachan,<BR>
40 A warring scene of tumult,<BR>
Miserable princes.<BR>
Were made to tremble before Cynan.<BR>
The breastplate being transfixed,<BR>
Like a ruler, they cried out,<BR>
Cyngen of perfect song<BR>
Thou wilt help with thy wide country.<BR>
A saying was heard.<BR>
Every one in his red place,<BR>
Be the circle red, they say ironically,<BR>
50 They, will enslave thy Cynan.</P>
