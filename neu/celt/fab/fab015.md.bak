# CHAPTER XIII.

### TRUE PLACE OF THE POEMS IN WELSH LITERATURE.

HAVING thus examined the recent criticism, by which the poems attributed
to the bards of the sixth century are maintained really to belong to a
much later period, so far as the limits of this work will permit, we
have now to approach the true problem we have to solve, and endeavour to
assign to them their real place in Cymric literature; and the first
question is, Do the poems themselves afford any indications by which we
may judge of their antiquity? It is obvious, viewed in this light, that
if these poems are genuine they ought to reflect the history of the
period to which they belong. If we find that they do not re-echo to any
extent the fictitious narrative of the events of the fifth and sixth
centuries as represented in the Bruts, but rather the leading facts of
the early history of Cymry, as we have been able to deduce them from the
older authorities, it will be a strong ground for concluding that they
belong themselves to an earlier age. This is an inquiry which of course
can only affect the so-called historical poems, with such others of the
class of mythological poems as contain historical allusions; but when
their true place and period are once ascertained, the other poems must
be

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

judged of by their resemblance to these in metrical structure, style,
and sentiment.

Following, then, the course of the history, as we have traced it, we
have first the *Marwnad* or Death-song of Cunneddaf (B. T. 46). Cunedda,
as we know, was Guledig in the fifth century, and retired from the
northern wall to beyond the southern. In the poem we are told--

There is trembling from fear of Cunedda the burner,  
In Caer Weir and Caer Lliwelydd;

that is, in Durham. and Carlisle--two towns, the one behind the west
end, and the other the east end of the wall. And again--

He was to be admired in the tumult with nine hundred horse.

\[paragraph continues\] Here he is represented as commanding 900 horse,
the exact amount of auxiliary cavalry attached to a Roman legion. The
Roman wall, or *mur*, is likewise alluded to in two other of those
death-songs (B. T. 40, 41)--one where Ercwlf is called the Wall-piercer,
and the other where Madawg, the son of Uthyr, is called the Joy of the
Wall.

It is very remarkable how few of these poems contain any notice of
Arthur. If they occupied a place, as is supposed, in Welsh literature,
subsequent to the introduction of the Arthurian romance, we should
expect these poems to be saturated with him and his knights, and his
adventures, but it is not so. Out of so large a body of poems, there are
only five which mention him at all, and then it is the historical
Arthur, the Guledig, to whom the defence of the wall was entrusted, and

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

who fights the twelve battles in the north and finally perishes at
Camlan. In one of them, the Cadeir Teyrnon (B. T. 15), this idea
pervades the whole poem. Arthur is the

Person of two authors of the race  
Of the steel Ala.

\[paragraph continues\] He is mentioned as being

Among the Gosgordd of the wall.

\[paragraph continues\] The Bard asks

Who are the three chief ministers  
That guarded the country?

\[paragraph continues\] And finally

From the destruction of Chiefs,  
In a butchering manner;  
From the loricated Legion  
Arose the Guledig.

In another, the poem in the Black Book which has been supposed to refer
to the Mabinogi of Kilhwch and Olwen, Arthur again appears as the
warrior fighting in the north, and two of his twelve battles are
mentioned--

In Mynyd Eiddyn  
He contended with Cynvyn.

\[paragraph continues\] And again--

On the strands of Trywruyd  
Contending with Garwluyd,  
Brave was his disposition.  
With sword and shield.

\[paragraph continues\] And the same body of legionary cavalry is
alluded to--

They were stanch commanders  
Of a legion for the benefit of the country,  
Bedwyn and Bridlaw,  
*Nine hundred* to them would listen.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Again, in the Spoils of Annwfn. (B. T. 30), in
which, in its historical sense, an expedition to the dreary region north
of the wall would be intended--

Thrice twenty Canhwr stood upon the mur or wall.

\[paragraph continues\] *Canhwr* is a *centuria*, or body of 100 men,
and there were sixty centuries in the Roman legion, here represented as
stationed at the wall.

In the *Historia Britonum*, the author describes the Britons as having
been, for forty years after the Romans left the island, "sub metu,"
which expression he afterwards explains as meaning, "sub metu Pictorum
et Scotorum," and the memory of these fearful and destructive outbursts
of ravaging and plundering bands of Picts from beyond the wall must have
long dwelt in their recollection. This we might also expect to find
reflected in the poems.

When a poem opens with these lines:--

How miserable it is to see  
Tumult and commotion,  
Wounds and confusion,  
The *Brithwyr* in motion,  
And a cruel fate,  
With the impulse of destiny,  
And for the sake of Heaven,  
Declare the discontinuance of the disaster--

is it possible to doubt that that poem was written in a time when the
country was still smarting from the recollection of their ravages? Thus,
in another poem (R. B. 23), we have

Let the chief architects  
Against the fierce Picts  
Be the Morini Brython--

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

alluding to the attempt by the Britons to protect themselves by the
wall. Then, in two other poems, One commonly called the Mic Dinbych (B.
T. 21), where the billows which surround one of the cities are said

To come to the green sward from the region of the Ffichti;

and in another (B. T. 11), where, it is said--

Hearndur and Hyfeid and Gwallawg,  
And Owen of Mona of Maelgwnian energy,  
Will lay the *Peithwyr* prostrate--

is it possible to doubt that they must have been written when the Picts
were still a powerful people in Britain, and before their kingdom was
merged in that of the Scots?

The mode in which Mr. Nash deals with these passages is characteristic.
He ignores the first poem altogether, and he so disguises the other
passages in his translation as to banish the Picts as effectually from
them as they were ever expelled by the Roman troops from the province.
In the passage quoted from the second poem, he translates the line--*Rac
Ffichit leuon*, before twenty chiefs. Now, *Ffichit* does not mean
twenty in Welsh, but *Fichead* means twenty in Gaelic; and he would
rather suppose that the bard had introduced a Gaelic word than that he
could have alluded to such embarrassing people as the Picts.

In the next passage he translates the line--*Adaw hwynt werglas o glas
Ffichti*, "promised to them are the drinking-cups of painted glass." If
*A daw hwynt* means they came, *Adaw* means a promise; but how *Gwerlas*
call mean drinking-cups I cannot conceive.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

It is always used as meaning "the green sward." Then he evidently
supposes that *glas* is the English word "glass," instead of the middle
form of *clas*, a region; and thus here, too, he would rather suppose
that the bard had used the English word "glass," and. the Latin word
"pictus" in its corrupt form *ffichti*, than that the Picts could have
been mentioned; but the technical use in Welsh of *Ffchti* for the Picts
is quite established.

The last passage he thus translates:--"Hearnddur and Hyfeid Hir, and
Gwallawg and Owen of Mona, and Maelgwn of great reputation, they would
prostrate the foe;" thus quietly suppressing the word *Peithwyr*, which
certainly does not mean. simply "foe." <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

Nennius mentions the Picts whom Arthur defeated at the battle of *Mynyd
Eiddyn*, or Edinburgh, by the strange and unusual name of *Catbregion*;
but we find them appearing under that name in another poem in the Book:
of Taliessin (50):--

The *Catbreith* of a strange language will be troubled,  
From the ford of Taradyr to Portwygyr in Mona.

The ford of Taradyr is the ford of Torrador, across the river Carron,
the northern boundary of the Picts of Manau, near Falkirk.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

This poem, too, is ignored by Mr. Nash.

Another portion of these poems must evidently have been known to the
author of the *Genealogia*, written in the eighth century. After
narrating the reign of Ida, king of Northumbria, who died in 559, he
says:--"Tunc Talhaern Cataguen in poemate claruit et Neirin et Taliesin
et Bluchbard et Cian qui vocatur Gueinthgwant simul uno tempore in
poemate Britannico claruerunt." Of these four who shone in British
poetry, it is admitted that the first three are Aneurin, Taliessin, and
Llywarch Hen, and being mentioned in the course of his notice of
Bernicia, they must have been connected with the north. The expression
used with regard to them is remarkable. It does not simply say that they
flourished then but "*in poemate Britannico* claruerunt." Could he have
used that expression had there not been *poemata Britannica*, Welsh
poems, then well known and then connect with this some of the subsequent
notices, "Contra illum (*i.e.* Hussa) quatuor regis Urbgen et Ridderch
Hen et Guallaue et Morcant dimicaverunt." The idea that runs through
these notices, and accounts for the otherwise apparently unconnected and
intrusive mention of the bards, is this. Aneurin, Taliessin, and
Llywarch Hen, wrote Welsh poems, and it was against Hussa that Urien,
Ridderch Hen, Gwallawg, and Morcant fought. Add to this, that the
subject of a number of the poems of Taliessin and Llywarch Hen was the
wars of these very heroes against the Saxons; and can we reasonably
doubt that these poems were

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

known to the writer? The next notice is still more significant "Deodric,
contra illum Urbgen cum filiis dimicabat fortiter." There is but one
poem in which Urien is mentioned as fighting along with any of his sons.
It is the Battle of Argoed Llwyfain, attributed to Taliessin (B. T. 35),
in which Urien and his son Owen are attacked by Flamddwyn, the Saxon
king, and fight valiantly against him. Must this poem not have been in
the mind of the writer when he here notes--It was against Deodric that
Urien and his sons fought,--thus identifying him with Flamddwyn? There
is another allusion of the same kind equally significant. After
narrating the war between Oswy and Penda, with the thirty British kings
who assisted him, and their slaughter in Campo Gai, he adds, "Et nunc
facta est strages Gai Campi." Is the idea not this--And it was now that
the well-known slaughter of *Catraeth* took place? for *traeth*, a
shore, is here rendered by Campus and *Ca*, forming in combination *Ga*,
as in *Gatraeth*, is the adjective Gaus agreeing with Campus, and the
great poem of the Gododin, including the mixed portion, which belongs to
this period, must have been known to the writer. If these inferences are
at all legitimate, a body of historical poems attributed to the same
bards, and narrating the same events by the same warriors as those which
we now have, must have been in, existence when the author of the
*Genealogia* wrote--that is, in the eighth century.

Further, in examining these poems,. we find that there runs through the
poems in each of the four books

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

a date indicated in the poem itself, which is nearly the same in all,
and is comprised within the first sixty years of the seventh or
immediately preceding century. Thus, in the Book of Caermarthen, there
is what I conceive to be the text of the Avallenau in its original
shape, and in this text the bard says--

Ten years and forty, with my treasures,  
Have I been sojourning among ghosts and sprites.

\[paragraph continues\] And the first poem tells us that, after the
battle of Ardderyd,

Seven score generous ones become ghosts.  
In the wood of Celyddon they came to an end.

\[paragraph continues\] The battle of Ardderyd was fought in the year
573, and ten years and forty will bring us to 623, not long after which
the poem may have. been composed.

In the Book of Aneurin, the bard who wrote the last part of the Gododin
tells us that "from the height of Adoyn he saw the head of Dyfnwal Brec
devoured by ravens;" but Dyfnwal Brec is no other than Donald Brec, king
of Dalriada, and the year of his death is a fixed era. It was in 642;

In the Book of Taliessin there is a poem (49) which has been much
misunderstood. It contains these verses:--

Five chiefs there will be to me  
Of the Gwyddyl Ffichti,  
Of a sinner's disposition,  
Of a race of the knife;  
Five others there will be to me  
Of the Norddmyn place;  
The sixth a wonderful king,  
From the sowing to the reaping; <span id="page_234">p. 234</span>  
The seventh proceeded  
To the land over the flood;  
The eighth, of the line of *Dyfi*,  
Shall not be freed from prosperity.

The *Dyfi* or Dovey flows past Corsfochno and the *Traeth Maelgwn*,
where Maelgwn Gwynedd. established the sovereignty in his family, is on
its shore. The kings of his race are the only kings who could be said to
be of the line of *Dyfi* or Dovey. The word *Norddmyn* is probably the
word translated by the author of the *Genealogia*, where he calls Oswald
"Rex Nordorum." It is only used on this one occasion, and seems, during
his reign, to have been applied to the kings of the Nordanhymbri. We
know that the Saxons of Bernicia superseded a Pictish population; and
there is but one king of the line of *Dyfi* who became a king of
Bernicia, and he was Cadwallawn, a descendant of Maelgwn Gwynedd. The
passage, therefore, appears to refer to Bernicia, which lay south of the
Firth of Forth. We have first five kings of the Gwyddyl Ffichti, then
five kings of the Norddmyn--Ida, Ella, Ethelric, Ethelfred, and Edwin.
The sixth, from the sowing to the reaping--that is, from spring to
harvest--was Osric, who only reigned a few months, when he was slain in
autumn by Cadwallawn. The seventh was Eanfrid, who crossed the
flood--that is, the Firth of Forth--from the land of the Picts, where he
had taken refuge, and was likewise slain by Cadwallawn, who is the
eighth king of the line of *Dyfi*, and the poem must have been written
before his

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

reverse of fortune in 655. In the poem called Cerdd y Vab Llyr (B. T.
14) there is this line--

A battle against the lord of fame in the dales of Severn,  
Against Brochmail of Powys, who loved my *Awen*.

which implies that the bard was contemporary with Brochmail, who is
mentioned by Bede as being present at the battle fought in 613. In the
Red Book of Hergest, in the historical poems attributed to Llywarch Hen,
there occurs throughout a current of expressions which imply that the
bard witnessed the events he alludes to, and must have lived during the
period extending from the death of Urien to that of Cadwallawn in 659.
But what was this period thus indicated in so many of the poems, and
running through the four ancient books? It was that of the great
outburst of energy on the part of the Cymry under Cadwallawn, when they
even, for the time, obtained supremacy over the Angles of
Northumberland, and throughout his life presented a formidable front to
their Saxon foes--when their hopes must have been excited, and their
exultation equally great, till, after the first reverse in 655, they
were finally quenched by the death of Cadwaladyr, in the pestilence of
664, who, they fondly hoped, would have re-established the power they
had enjoyed under his father.

The first poem in the Red Book of Hergest is the Cyvoesi Myrddin, and
its peculiar form requires special consideration. It is a species of
chronicle written in the shape of a dialogue between Myrddin and his
sister Gwendydd, in which the latter appeals

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

to her brother's prophetical power to foretell the successive rulers
over Britain. This is a device of which there are other examples, and it
is a favourite one in rude times. A record of past events is written in
the shape, of a prophecy of future events, and the period of its
composition is indicated by the termination of a distinct and literal
record, and the commencement of one clothed in figurative and obscure
language. This is a species of poetic chronicle which, is peculiarly
adapted to addition and interpolation. A few imitative verses in the
same style can be inserted or added, bringing the record from time to
time further down.

The Cyvoesi commences with Rydderch Hael, in whose time the prophecy is
supposed to be uttered, and the bard foretells the rule of Morcant after
him; after. Morcant, Urien; and after Urien, Maelgwn Hir. He then takes
the line of Maelgwn's descendants down to Cynan Tindaethwy, when he
introduces Mervyn *o dir Manau*, and follows his descendants to Howel
dda. The record then changes its character, and proceeds to foretell a
succession of kings under descriptive names, until it announces the
coming again of Cadwaladyr, who is said to reign 303 years and 3 months,
and to be succeeded by Cyndaf; and after some further obscure
references, the poem assumes a more personal character, in which the
bard is described as having been imprisoned beneath the earth, and
concludes.

It has been supposed that this poem must have been composed in the reign
of Howel dda, who died in 948, as after his name the style of the poem
changes from the direct mention of historic kings

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

under their real names to that of a list of apparently imaginary kings,
designated by obscure epithets; but Mr. Stephens does not admit this,
and maintains that these obscure epithets can be so easily identified as
to show that the bard was in fact recording the historic successors of
Howel dda. An example of this identification will suffice: The bard,
when asked, Who will rule after Howel? answers *Y Bargodyein*, the
borderers. Mr. Stephens thinks this word plainly indicates Jevan and
Jago, the sons of Edwal Voel, king of North Wales, because their claim
to the throne which they usurped only *bordered* on a rightful
title. <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)

There is reason to think, however, that parts of this poem were compiled
at an earlier date than the reign of Howel dda. It may in fact be
divided into four parts--the first, from the beginning to the end of the
26th stanza, containing the stanza mentioning Cadwaladyr; the second,
from the 26th stanza to the 65th; the third, from the 66th stanza to the
102d; and the fourth, from the 102d stanza to the end.

Now there is this peculiarity in the first part of the poem, that it
names as the kings who ruled before Maelgwn, Urien, Morcant, and
Rydderch Hael. Is it possible to conceive that any chronicle containing
such a succession of kings could have been composed in Wales even so
early as the tenth century? Would the author not have given, in
preference, the kings said to have ruled in Wales? Its connection, how
ever, with Nennius and with Bernicia is apparent. Nennius states that
the British kings who fought against the Bernician

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

kings were Urien, Rydderch, Gwallawg, and Morcant, and the Cyvoesi
begins its list with three of them--Rydderch, Morcant, and Urien--and
then says that Maelgwn reigned over Gwynedd only. This part of the
chronicle must have been composed in the north, but after Cadwaladyr
there is an obvious break. Throughout the previous part, the questions
and answers alternate, each answer being followed by a question, Who
ruled next? But the verse naming Cadwaladyr is not followed by a
question. The verses are as follows--

25 Though I see thy cheek is direful,  
It comes impulsively to my mind  
Who will rule after Cadwallawn.

26 A tall man holding a conference,  
And Britain under one sceptre:  
The best of Cymro's sons, Cadwaladyr.

27 He that comes before me mildly,  
His abilities are they not worthless?  
After Cadwaladyr, Idwal.

The question before this last stanza is omitted, but if we go on to the
mention again of Cadwaladyr, in the 102d stanza, which commences the
fourth portion of the Cyvoesi, we shall find that it must originally
have immediately succeeded the 26th stanza. Let us place them
together:--

215 Though I see thy check is direful,  
It comes impulsively to my Mind  
Who will rule after Cadwallawn.

26 A tall man *holding a conference*,  
And Britain under one sceptre:  
The best of Cymro's sons, Cadwaladyr. <span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

102 Do not separate abruptly from me,  
From a dislike *to the conference*.  
Who will rule after Cadwaladyr?

103 To Gwendydd I will declare,  
Age after age I will predict,  
After Cadwaladyr, Cyndav.

As Cyndav is an imaginary king, I hold that the original poem, of which
we have a part in the first 26 stanzas, must have been composed before
the death of Cadwaladyr, while he was still the hope of the Cymry, and
must have belonged to the north.

The second part, which contains the real names of the kings to Howel
dda, and a list of imaginary kings after, him, must, I think,
notwithstanding Mr. Stephens' attempt to identify them, have been added
in the reign of Howel dda; and this is confirmed by the fact that the,
successor of Cadwaladyr is made to be his son Idwal, and that there is
no appearance of Ivor from Armorica, who would certainly have been
mentioned had the poem been composed after the appearance of the Bruts.

The third portion, extending from stanza 66 to stanza 102, has probably
been added in South Wales in the twelfth century. The lord of eight
fortresses, mentioned in the 65th stanza, may have been Robert
Fitz-Hamon, the first Norman who obtained Glamorgan, and built castles;
and *Mab Henri*, in the 68th stanza, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who
succeeded him in Glamorgan, and was son of Henry the First.

This part of the poem contains a prophecy that Cadwaladyr would reappear
with a powerful host to

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

defend the men of Gwynedd, that he would descend in the vale of Tywi,
and would reign 303 years.

There were, however, two very distinct forms in which this prophecy of
the reappearing of Cadwaladyr was conveyed. The first we find in the
Afallenau, the text of which, as it appears in the Black Book, I
consider to be that of an old poem.

The poem in that text concludes with this stanza:--

Sweet apple-tree, and a tree of crimson hue  
Which grows in concealment in the wood of Celyddon,  
Though sought for their fruit, it will be in vain,  
Until Cadwaladyr comes from the conference of the ford of Rheon,  
And Cynan to meet him advances upon the Saxons.  
The Cymry will be victorious, glowing will be their leader;  
All shall have their rights, and Britons will rejoice,  
Sounding the horns of gladness, and chanting the song of peace and
happiness.

The other form of the prophecy we find in the Hoianau, which I agree
with Mr. Stephens in considering to be spurious.

In it the expressions are as follows:--

And I will predict that two rightful princes,  
Will produce peace from heaven to earth--  
Cynan and Cadwaladyr--thorough Cymry,  
May their councils be admired.  
.       .        .        .        .        .        .  
And when Cadwaladyr comes to the subjugation of Mona,  
The Saxons will be extirpated from lovely Britain.  
.       .        .        .        .        .        .  
Stout Cynan appearing from the banks of the Teifi,  
Will cause confusion in Dyfed.

The form of the prophecy in the Hoianau is obviously the same with that
in the third part of the Cyvoesi, which I consider to have been produced
in

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

\[paragraph continues\] South Wales in the twelfth century. In the one,
Cadwaladyr comes to Mona, and Cynan from the valley of the Teifi in
*Dyfed* or South Wales, in the other, Cadwaladyr comes to Gwynedd, and
descends in the vale of the Tywi in South Wales.

But the form of the prophecy in the Avallenau is very different. There
Cadwaladyr comes from a conference at *Ryd Rheon*, or the ford of Reon,
and this is evidently the same place as *Llwch Rheon*, which we can
identify with Loch Ryan in Galloway, and he goes to the wood of Celyddon
to meet Cynan.

In the later form of the prophecy Cynan and Cadwaladyr come from
Armorica. Thus, in the *Vita Merlini*, Geoffrey says--

The Britons their noble kingdom,  
Shall for a long time lose through weakness,  
Until from Armorica Conan shall come in his car,  
And Cadwaladyr, the honoured leader of the Cymry.

\[paragraph continues\] And the prophecy can only have assumed this
shape after the fictitious narrative of Cadwaladyr taking refuge in
Armorica was substituted for his death in the pestilence, and the scene
of his return is placed in South Wales, whence this form of the prophecy
emerged.

But the prophecy which connects his reappearance with the conference at
the ford of Loch Ryan, and places the meeting with Conan in the wood of
Celyddon, must be much older, and the Cumbrian form of the prophecy; and
with this form of it, the first passage in the Cyvoesi is obviously
connected, which describes Cadwaladyr as a tall man holding a
conference.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[230:1](fab015.htm#fr_28.md) In noticing Mr. Nash's
so-called translations, I may remark that he invariably translates Welsh
on the principle that, if any Welsh word resembles an English word, it
must be the English word that is used. He carries this so far as to
translate the well-known word for a ford in Welsh, *rhyd*, by the
English word "road." He appears to me to translate Welsh somewhat in the
same fashion as Hood's School-boy translated the first line of
Virgil--Arma, virumque cano--An arm, a man, and a cane.
