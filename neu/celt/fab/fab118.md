### CIII.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXIX.

AND God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,  
Great., wonderful, when thou protectedst me through the wave.  
The hosts of Moses, sovereign Lord, woe their dispersion!  
Pharaoh and his host perceived them, cursing the cause,  
And to sea thou madest new the cause.  
Did he not allure them through an inundation that drowns birds?  
From where the sun rises to the west there was land.  
Thou wouldst protect those that thou lovest from every prison  
Except hosts, vehement their shout, heavy their din.  
10 And protect us also from the miseries of Uffern fierce.  
And God the possessor, God the regulator, merciful diviner,  
Thine is the country of heaven, it is in peace that thou lovest.  
There is not weariness, nor want in thy country, Lord.  
No one will be ordered; no one will be an enemy to another.  
I would have known, if I had understood, for shame,  
That thou lovest, the Holy Trinity, any one that is skilful.  
Bards disparage you; they love much for ever.  
That was not vile, the Israel which thou placedst in the hand of
David.  
Alexander had a large number of men.  
20 He would not have been strong, had he not thy friendship,  
With his armies and great battles and his tortuous hosts.  
When they came to the land they were sad in their death. <span

Solomon the judge contained the land, he was better than they.  
Son of kings. He was accustomed to riches for his auxiliary.  
The sons of Jacob were rich on their land;  
What they liked, they shared according to the word of the Lord.  
Abel, innocent, was prosperous, and took the faith,  
His brother Cain was headstrong, evil his counsel.  
Aser and Soyw in the clear air, their co-operators.  
30 A star-angel conducteth a number before their warriors,  
With the wand of Moses, him and his hosts on their land.  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
The talkative and dumb and wise and bold were redressed,  
Ruler protect, one protection to those that deserve death.  
I also will praise the abode of hosts, the dwelling of blessedness,  
I also will praise the best repository that overflows the world.  
The chief kingdom that Jonah brought from the centre of junction,  
The nation of Nineveh, he was a man that joyfully preached.  
Queens over sea had the shadow of the Lord, that protected them,  
40 And Maria Mary, daughter of Anna, great her penitence.  
Through thy generosity and mercy, King of the world!  
May there be to us, in the cities of heaven, admission to thee.
