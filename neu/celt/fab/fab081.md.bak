### LXVI.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XVI.

I. BLESSED is the birch in the valley of the Gwy,  
Whose branches will fall off one by one, two by two,  
It will remain when there will be a battle in Ardudwy, <span
id="page_482">p. 482</span>  
And the lowing together of cattle about the ford of Mochnwy,  
And spears and shouting at Dyganwy,  
And Edwin bearing sway in Mona,  
And youths pale and light  
In ruddy clothes commanding them.

II\. Blessed is the birch in Pumlumon,  
Which will see when the front of the stag shall be exalted,  
And which will see the Franks clad in mail,  
And about the hearth food for whelps,  
And monks frequently riding on steeds.

III\. Blessed is the birch in the heights of Dinwythwy,  
Which will know when there shall be a battle in Ardudwy,  
And spears uplifted around Edrywy,  
And a bridge on the Taw, and another on the Tawy,  
And another, on account of a misfortune, on the two banks of the Gwy,  
And the artificer that will make it, let his name be Garwy;  
And may the principal of Mona have dominion over it.  
Women will be under the Gynt, and men in affliction.  
Happier than I is he who will welcome  
The time of Cadwaladyr: a song he may sing!
