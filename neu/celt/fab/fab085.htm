<P>CHRIST JESUS! who art in complete possession of light,<BR>
The strength of the feeble Christian in the gloom;<BR>
Christ, the mysterious One! in order to produce seriousness<BR>
May utterance be given to my bardic lays;<BR>
May my bards, when they chant, be attended to;<BR>
May my bardic word from the golden chair be kept;<BR>
May my poem above books be read.<BR>
As a canon by him who chants the Paternoster.<BR>
Believe in God, and God will not reject thee;<BR>
10 Believe! from his court no vanity will affect thee;<BR>
Believe that He suffered on a Friday,<BR>
And that He arose to overcome a host.<BR>
From the mutual sullenness of royal chiefs a tumult shall be heard;<BR>
By virtue of unity, the compact of Rosser,<BR>
May the Saxons hasten away before distress!<BR>
On the borders a standing army will be complained of.<BR>
Unprofitable Maelenydd will be molested, <A NAME="page_494"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 494</FONT></A><BR>
Lawless, with rights, without a Caer.<BR>
20 Around the land of Mael a long battle will be heard;<BR>
Around the banks of Gwyran there will be a gory scene;<BR>
Around Buallt eager will be the tumult at the close of day,<BR>
Beards in flight from mortal cowardice.<BR>
Around Aber Cammarch may be greeted<BR>
The chief, the joy of his retinue.<BR>
Then will the poet be free from anxiety,<BR>
From celebrating the completion of splendid actions,<BR>
From the primitive language, penance, and paternosters,<BR>
From the value of respect when thou art addressed.<BR>
30 Ask of the Supreme Being, from the depth of adoration,<BR>
Of adoration, success from above the light,<BR>
To the steel against Lloegyr which corrupts the paternoster,<BR>
To his friends, his flag, and his standard.<BR>
A man from concealment, prompt, brave, and wrathful,<BR>
Will appear, to command a multitude;<BR>
He will cause terror at the commencement,<BR>
And easily break the boundary on a Friday,<BR>
Friday: believe it is no falshood.<BR>
The Saxons will retreat from his oppression over the country.<BR>
40 About Aber Cammarch there will be ignominy,<BR>
Excessive tumult, shouting, blades, and men in battle-array.<BR>
And a splendid banner, it is no error,<BR>
And a dragon causing the death of a leader:<BR>
Lloegrians will be uttering doleful lamentations,<BR>
And men in the dire shout bewailing their brains.<BR>
A man over Lloegyr which corrupts religion,<BR>
Will come to command his army;<BR>
He will cause a happy beginning.<BR>
For a long time, as regards the land, he will disappear,<BR>
50 The hero of a disturbed country.<BR>
There will be a mutual sharpening of blades, a mutual havoc concerning baptism. <A NAME="page_495"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 495</FONT></A><BR>
It will be time like doomsday; and gifts will be given to the poet,<BR>
The action will be heard all over the land.<BR>
His driving and impelling forces will have no end.<BR>
His gifts, according to established rights, he will pour forth.<BR>
Let us deserve and love Caer Leriydd,<BR>
Because of the voice of Cod whose favour is unfeigned.<BR>
Until we shall have been long through.<BR>
60 Purity is a state of freedom from frailty.<BR>
Precious will be the gifts of baptism from my Lord,<BR>
Seek mercy, for fear of the element of discord.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II.</P>
<P>Around Buallt the troops of the public host<BR>
Cause a tumult: there is complaint for each destruction.<BR>
When disbanded let the hordes of Henri fly.<BR>
Obscure is the top of the Caer where ruins meet.<BR>
Alun, the foremost in beauty, is all commotion,<BR>
Dispersion, ruin, and disgrace are all over it:<BR>
70 The slaughter shocks one when thou relatest it;<BR>
To relate its severe loss thou canst not,<BR>
From the contention of a baron of short co-operation,<BR>
There will be a white corpse, without head, without beauty,<BR>
There will be spare horses, worthless to be destroyed.<BR>
And men with unfriendly looks about Ceri,<BR>
And loud uproar, and thrusting, and shouting,<BR>
And groaning in every . . .<BR>
Actively will the sons of Cymry call upon Dewi<BR>
Who loveth peace and mercy . . .</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">III.</P>
<P>80 Fellow-ranger of the green woods!<BR>
Painful, piercing grief affects me.<BR>
Conflicts are pangs of anguish to the upright. <A NAME="page_496"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 496</FONT></A><BR>
The life of a man is pursued like that of a wretch,<BR>
By the strong ones of Lloegyr who corrupt equity.<BR>
Let us meet them and see their death!<BR>
The union of Saxons is but for a night;<BR>
Of ignoble descent they are in the banquet of mead;<BR>
They make compacts without mutual entertainment and sociality;<BR>
And break them with a violent rupture:<BR>
90 Barons whose co-operation is of short duration.<BR>
And the ruler of what land in Gwyned, inferior in speech,<BR>
Can relate the fatigue and trouble of pursuing them?<BR>
Look if you can see any paltry spoil.<BR>
The tumult of slaughter is heard again.<BR>
Let reparation be made if there is military law.<BR>
It is peaceless treachery if a man is to be denied the hope<BR>
Of being brought to God at once.<BR>
Hosts get rich on full march.<BR>
A plaintiff is strong while investigating his claim.<BR>
100 A man was killed by an unlucky obstruction.<BR>
True, it is incumbent on the innocent to die,<BR>
But it is a disgrace before God to cause his death.<BR>
There is a deliverer ten times to the brave.<BR>
God will be pleased when every language shall have ceased.<BR>
Health by means of penance is a painful restriction.<BR>
May he give us through hope,<BR>
In the end, mercy through a just compact! Amen.</P>
