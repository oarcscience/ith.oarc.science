<P>I. LET the furious Unhwch lead me on<BR>
To the front of the mutual conflict--<BR>
'Tis better to be killed than parley on terms.</P>
<P>II. Let the furious Unhwch lead me on--<BR>
It was said in the Pass of Llech,--<BR>
"Dunawd the son of Pabo will not lurk."</P>
<P>III. Let the furious Unhwch lead me on--<BR>
Like the sullen agitation of the sea was the war-expanding tumult.<BR>
Of Urien with the ardent grasp.</P>
<P>IV. The eagle of Gal, Unhwch, bold and generous,<BR>
Wrathful in war, sure of conquest,<BR>
Was Urien with the ardent grasp.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A></P>
<P>V. The eagle of Gal, Unhwch,<BR>
The possessor of the energetic soul . . .<BR>
The cell of the sea of smooth inlets with green surface.</P>
<P>VI. A head I bear by my side,<BR>
That has been an assaulter between two hosts--<BR>
The magnanimous son of Cynvarch was its possessor.</P>
<P>VII. A head I bear by my side,<BR>
The head of Urien, the mild leader of his army--<BR>
And on his white bosom the sable raven is perched.</P>
<P>VIII, A head I bear in my shirt,<BR>
The head of Urien who governed a court in mildness--<BR>
And on his white bosom the sable raven gluts.</P>
<P>IX. A head I bear in my hand,<BR>
He that was a soaring eagle, whose like will not be had,<BR>
His princely breast is assailed by the devourer.</P>
<P>X. A head I bear by the side of my thigh,<BR>
That was the shield of his country,<BR>
That was a wheel in battle,<BR>
That was a ready sword in his country's battles.</P>
<P>XI. A head I bear on my sword:<BR>
Better his being alive than that he should go to the grave;<BR>
He was a castle for old age.</P>
<P>XII. A head I bear from the bordering land of Penawg,<BR>
Wide extended was his warfare:<BR>
Urien the eloquent, whose, fame went far.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A></P>
<P>XIII. A head I bear on my shoulder,<BR>
That would not bring on me disgrace--<BR>
Woo to my hand that my lord is slain.</P>
<P>XIV. A head I bear on my arm,<BR>
He that overcame the land of Bryneich--<BR>
But after being a hero, now on the hearse.</P>
<P>XV. A head I bear in the grasp of my hand,<BR>
Of a chief that mildly governed a country;<BR>
The head, the most powerful pillar of Prydain.</P>
<P>XVI. A head I bear that supported me,<BR>
Is there any known but he welcomed?<BR>
Woe my hand, gone is be that sustained me.</P>
<P>XVII. A head I bear from the Riw,<BR>
With his lips foaming with blood--<BR>
Woe to Reged from this day!</P>
<P>XVIII. My arm has not flagged; my bosom is greatly troubled;<BR>
Ah! my heart, is it not broken?<BR>
A head I bear that was my support.</P>
<P>XIX. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<BR>
Under earth and stones:<BR>
Woe my hand, that the father of Owain is slain!</P>
<P>XX. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<BR>
Amidst earth and oak:<BR>
Woe my hand, that my cousin is slain!</P>
<P>XXI. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-night;<BR>
Under stones let it be left:<BR>
Woe my hand, what a step has fate decreed me!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXII. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-night<BR>
Amidst earth and green sods:<BR>
Woe my hand, that the son of Cynvarch is slain!</P>
<P>XXIII. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<BR>
Under the greensward and a tumulus:<BR>
Woe my hand, that my lord is slain!</P>
<P>XXIV. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day,<BR>
Under earth and sand:<BR>
Woe my hand, the step that is decreed to me!</P>
<P>XXV. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<BR>
Under earth and nettles:<BR>
Woe my hand, that such a step could have happened to me!</P>
<P>XXVI. The delicate white corpse will be covered to-day<BR>
Under earth and blue stones:<BR>
Woe my hand, the step that has befallen me!</P>
<P>XXVII. A master-feat of the world the brother has been in pursuit of;<BR>
For the horns of the buffalo, for a festive goblet<BR>
He was the depredator with the hounds in the covert of Reged!<BR>
XXVIII. A master-feat of the world the brother has eagerly sought,<BR>
For the equivocal horn of the buffalo;<BR>
He was the chaser with the hounds with the men of Reged.</P>
<P>XXIX. Eurdyl will be joyless this night,<BR>
And multitudes (will be so) besides:<BR>
In Aber Lleu has Urien been slain.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXX. Eurdyl will be sorrowful from the tribulation of this night,<BR>
And from the fate that is to me befallen;<BR>
That her brother should be slain at Aber Lleu.</P>
<P>XXXI. On Friday I saw great anxiety<BR>
Among the hosts of Baptism,<BR>
Like a swarm without a hive, bold in despair.</P>
<P>XXXII. Were there not given to me by Run, greatly fond of war,<BR>
A hundred swarms and a hundred shields?<BR>
But one swarm was better far than all.</P>
<P>XXXIII. Were there not given to me by Run, the famous chief,<BR>
A cantrev, and a hundred oxen?<BR>
But one gift was better far than those.</P>
<P>XXXIV. In the lifetime of Run, the peaceless ranger,<BR>
The unjust will wallow in dangers;<BR>
May there be irons on the steeds of rapine.</P>
<P>XXXV. The extreme I know of my trouble:<BR>
Is what all will hear in every season of warfare;<BR>
No one can charge me with anything.</P>
<P>XXXVI. Dunawd, the leading horseman, would drive onward,<BR>
Intent upon making a corpse,<BR>
Against the onset of Owain.</P>
<P>XXXVII. Dunawd, the chief of the age, would drive onward,<BR>
Intent upon making battle,<BR>
Against the conflict of Pasgen.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXVIII. Gwallawg, the horseman of tumult, would drive onward,<BR>
Intent upon trying the sharpest edge,<BR>
Against the conflict of Elphin.</P>
<P>XXXIX. Bran, the son of Mellyrn, would drive onward,<BR>
Collecting men to burn my ovens:<BR>
A wolf that looked grimly by the banks of Abers.</P>
<P>XL. Morgant and his men would drive onward,<BR>
Collecting a host to burn my lands:<BR>
He was a mouse that scratched against a rock.</P>
<P>XLI. I pushed onward when Elgno was slain;<BR>
The blade which Pyll brandished would gleam terribly,<BR>
If tents were pitched in his country.</P>
<P>XLII. A second time I saw, after a conflict,<BR>
A golden shield on the shoulder of Urien;<BR>
A second to him there was Elgno Hen.</P>
<P>XLIII. Upon the resolution there came a failing<BR>
From the dread of a furious horseman:<BR>
Will there be another compared with Urien?</P>
<P>XLIV. Decapitated is my lord, his opponents are powerful:<BR>
Warriors will not love his enemies:<BR>
Many sovereigns has he consumed.</P>
<P>XLV. The ardent disposition of Urien! it is sadness to me:<BR>
There is commotion in every region.<BR>
In pursuit of Llovan Llawdivro.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A></P>
<P>XLVI. Gentle gate! thou art heard afar;<BR>
There is scarcely another deserving praise,<BR>
Since Urien is no more.</P>
<P>XLVII. Many a hunting-dog and fine grown hawk<BR>
Have been trained on its flow,<BR>
Before Erlleon became desolate.</P>
<P>XLVIII. This hearth, deserted by the shout of war,<BR>
More congenial on its floor would have been<BR>
The mead, and loquacious drinkers.</P>
<P>XLIX. This hearth, will not nettles cover it?<BR>
While its defender lived,<BR>
More congenial to it were those who made requests.</P>
<P>L. This hearth, will it not be covered by the greensward?<BR>
In the lifetime of Owain and Elphin,<BR>
Its cauldron boiled the prey.</P>
<P>LI. This hearth, will it not be covered with musty fingers?<BR>
More congenial around its viand would have been<BR>
The gashing sword of the dauntless.</P>
<P>LII. This hearth, will not the slender brambles cover it?<BR>
Burning wood used to be on it,<BR>
Which Reged was accustomed to give.</P>
<P>LIII. This hearth, will not thorns cover it?<BR>
More congenial on it would have been the mixed group<BR>
Of Owain's social retinue.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A></P>
<P>LIV. This hearth, will it not be covered over by the ants?<BR>
More accustomed it was to bright torches,<BR>
And harmless festivities.</P>
<P>LV. This hearth, will it not be covered with dock-leaves?<BR>
More congenial on its floor would have been<BR>
The mead, and loquacious drinkers.</P>
<P>LVI. This hearth, will it not be turned up by the swine?<BR>
More congenial to it would have been<BR>
The joy of men, and the circling horns of banquet.</P>
<P>LVII. This hearth, will it not be scratched up by the fowl?<BR>
Want would not approach it<BR>
In the lifetime of Owain and Urien.</P>
<P>LVIII. This buttress, and that one there,<BR>
More congenial around them would have been<BR>
The joy of a host, and the tread of a minstrel.</P>
