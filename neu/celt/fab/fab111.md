### XCVI.

### JUVENILE ORNAMENTS OF TALIESSIN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN IX.

I WILL address my Lord,  
To consider the Awen.  
What brought necessity  
Before the time of Ceridwen.  
Primarily through my life  
Poverty has been.  
The wealthy monks  
Why will they not speak to me?  
Why will they not cause me to tremble?  
10 One hour that I was not followed,  
What disappearance of smoke?  
Why sang he evil?  
What fountain breaks out  
Above the covert of darkness?  
When the reed is white, <span id="page_543">p. 543</span>  
When it is a moonlight night.  
Another was not sung,  
It was shaken out,  
When is apt to be forward  
20 The noise of waves on the shore.  
In the vengeance of the ocean,  
A day will reach to them.  
When a stone is so heavy,  
When a thorn is so sharp.  
Knowest thou which is best?  
Its base or its point,  
Who caused a partition  
Between man and frigidity?  
Whose is the wholesomest sore?  
30 The young or the old?  
Knowest thou what thou art  
When thou art sleeping?  
Whether a body or a soul,  
Or a secresy of perception?  
The ingenious minstrel,  
Why does he not inform me?  
Knowest thou where should be  
The night waiting the passing of the day?  
Knowest thou a sign,  
40 How many leaves there are?  
Who uplifted the mountain,  
Before the elements fell?  
Who supports the structure  
Of the earth for a habitation?  
The soul of whom is complained of?  
Who has seen it, who knows?  
I wonder in books  
That they know not truly  
The soul, what is its seat. <span id="page_544">p. 544</span>  
50 What form its limbs,  
Through what part it pours out.  
What air it respires?  
A war petulant,  
A sinner endangered.  
A wonder in mockery,  
What were its dregs.  
Which is the best intoxication,  
Of mead or of bragget?  
When their happiness  
60 Was protected by the God of Trinity  
Why should I utter a treatise,  
Except of thee?  
Who caused coin  
Of current silver?  
When is so current  
A ear so prickly;  
Death having a foundation,  
In every country is shared.  
Death above our head,  
70 Wide is its covering,  
High above the canopy of heaven.  
Man is oldest when he is born.  
And is younger (and) younger continually,  
What is there to be anxious about,  
Of the present attainment?  
After a want of property,  
Does it not make to us a shortness of life?  
Enough of sadness,  
The visitation of the grave.  
80 And the One that made us,  
From the supreme country,  
Be he our God, and bring us  
To him at the end!
