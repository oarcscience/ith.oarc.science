<P>HERE is a graciously disposed King, who is wonderful in the highest degree,<BR>
Who is chief above the children of Adam,<BR>
Who is a happy and most mighty defence,<BR>
Who is generous, glorious, and most pure,<BR>
Whose claim is most strong and binding.<BR>
What is heard of him, and what is true, that will I celebrate.<BR>
To the great God, to the condescending and most compassionate God,<BR>
To the blessed God a sacred song I will sing.<BR>
Until I become a blameless man to God, I will consider the substance,<BR>
10 About the sin which Adam. shined.<BR>
About sin before the judgment I am very anxious,<BR>
Against the day of appointment, when all men shall come<BR>
From their graves in their strength and greatest vigour,<BR>
As they were when they were in their very prime,<BR>
In one host to the one place most pleasant,<BR>
Even to the top of one hill, in order to be judged.<BR>
Among this multitude may I attain the merit<BR>
Of being protected by a retinue of the nine orders of Heaven.<BR>
My God! what a gathering!<BR>
20 My Lord God! may my bardic lore<BR>
Affect the bonds of the universe!<BR>
My great Superior! my Owner!<BR>
The object of my reverence! before going to the sod, before going to the gravel,<BR>
Permit thou me to indite a composition <A NAME="page_514"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 514</FONT></A><BR>
To thy praise, before my tongue becomes mute,<BR>
And my memory like Job, who spoke<BR>
Unto his wife concerning her dragonic obedience.<BR>
When the servant of God on a certain day came<BR>
To him to the contest with his wife,<BR>
30 Before the blow he gave a handful<BR>
Of what had peeled from the surface of his flesh.<BR>
And since the presents which any one gave were now acceptable,<BR>
The merciful God made a gift of charity<BR>
In pure gold, the treasure of the Trinity.<BR>
In a fainting state he sits, and there praises God.<BR>
Blessed was he to be plagued! Now said Sin,<BR>
"Thou knowest how to conceal the perfidy of the mysterious Being."<BR>
The love-diffusing Lord of heaven, the Creator, take thou to praise Him,<BR>
That thou mayest reach the fair and happy region,<BR>
40 Happy, pleasant, free, and greatly deserving praise.<BR>
Loving wine, love thou the gentle, preserve the truth.<BR>
Eva did not preserve the sweet apple-tree which God commanded her,<BR>
For her transgression He was not reconciled to her,<BR>
But manifest pain he inflicted upon her.<BR>
Some wonderful covering of a flinty dress she put on herself;<BR>
The Maker of heaven caused her, in the midst of her riches, to make herself bare.<BR>
And a second miracle did the bountiful Lord, who hears being praised.<BR>
When she wished to avoid being caught,<BR>
The way in which she fled was where<BR>
50 There was a ploughman ploughing the ground,<BR>
With men in attendance. The mysterious Trinity has spoken it. <A NAME="page_515"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 515</FONT></A><BR>
Then went the faultless mother of splendid gifts<BR>
With her happy husband. A crowd of men<BR>
Afterwards came to ask.<BR>
In an entertainment,<BR>
"Hast thou seen a woman and a son with her?"<BR>
And say thou, for the record's truth,<BR>
And he will not refuse our request,<BR>
That thou didst see us going without her<BR>
60 To a certain spot, and the blessing of God be on it!<BR>
Upon that came a destitute rabble, a race of the disposition of Cain,<BR>
A fierce and iniquitous multitude are they;<BR>
A tower was sought, in order to seek the mysterious Being,<BR>
Then said one who was deformed and unwitty, to the man whom thou seest,--<BR>
"Hast thou seen the men of the city of giants<BR>
Going by thee without turning?"<BR>
I did see them when I harrowed the fair land,<BR>
Where you see the reaping.<BR>
What the children of Cain now did, was<BR>
70 To turn away from the reapers.<BR>
Through the intercession of Mary Maria,<BR>
And her knowledge communicated to her by God,<BR>
There were defending them, besides herself,<BR>
The Holy Spirit and her sanctity.</P>
