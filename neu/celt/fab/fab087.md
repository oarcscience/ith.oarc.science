### LXXII.

### CUHELYN.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN III.

GOD supreme, be mine the Awen! Amen; fiat!  
A successful song of fruitful praise, relating to the bustling course of
the host,  
According to the sacred ode of Cyridwen, the goddess of various seeds,  
The various seeds of poetic harmony, the exalted speech of the graduated
minstrel,  
Cuhelyn the bard of elegant Cymraec utterly rejects.  
A poem for a favour, the gift of friendship, will not be maintained. .  
But a composition of thorough praise is being brought to thee,  
Splendid singer in a choir, and of a song equal in length and motion.  
Appropriate and full were the tuneful horns, gloriously ascended the
conflagration <span id="page_499">p. 499</span>  
10 Of the nation of the border, whose troops were of the same pace and
simultaneous movement.  
Praise the here, whose gift is large, the benefit of humble suitors,  
Light is the rebuke of the rallying-point of relatives, the winner of
praise,  
A skilful fastener, for a hundred calends, the accumulator of heat;  
A fierce frowning wolf, whose inflexible disposition is law, accustomed
to jurisdiction.  
Eidoel was a man extremely brave, very choice and full of wisdom;  
A leader as regards the Brython, full of knowledge and prudence, fiery
in his wrath;  
Accustomed to hatred, accustomed to harmony, and to the high seat in the
banquet of mead;  
Partaker of the intoxicating wine, a knight of the list, a place of
limitation;  
A lord who is the measurer of the wall, the delight of the four
quarters, the great centre power;  
20 A knight of stout conduct, a knight of virtuous conduct, with
warriors full of rage;  
A guardian celebrated in song, a fine panegyric, the blandishment of
language.  
Odious was his death by Nognaw. Am I not agitated? The active and
eloquent one will I praise;  
A contented ruler, a restless guardian, energetic and wise.  
A company of active reapers, melodious poetry, and the assuaging of
wrath  
A talented hero, like a furious wave over the strand,  
The marrow of fine songs, a contemplative mind, a sacred mystery;  
A servitor with knowledge, the possession of mead, in agreeable eulogy;
<span id="page_500">p. 500</span>  
Music which has melody like that of a golden organ, a place of
retirement;  
The action of law against violence, the admirable vigour of the brave,
the energy of the Supreme Being.  
30 A blessing I will venture to ask, a blessing I will pray for, I will
bind myself thereby;  
The wonderful rush of the gale, the pervasion of fire, the war of
youth;  
One deserving of ruddy gold, one liberal of praise furrowed (with age),
a free wing;  
Ready affluence, a rill in a pleasant shelter, a reward for a
panegyric.  
The most deserving will yield, he will keep his refuge from the insult
of the enemy:  
He has completely kept the law, completely shown his disposition before
the placid Ogyrven.  
For a good turn from me, may the gift of Cuhelyn give satisfaction of
mind.
