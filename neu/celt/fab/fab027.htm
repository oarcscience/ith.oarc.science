<P>THE best song they will dispraise,<BR>
Eight numbers they will protect,<BR>
Monday, they will come,<BR>
Devastating they will go.<BR>
Tuesday, they will portion<BR>
Anger against the adversary.<BR>
Wednesday, they will reap.<BR>
Pomp in excess.<BR>
Thursday, they will part with<BR>
10 The undesired possessor.<BR>
Friday, a day of abundance.<BR>
In the blood of men they will swim.<BR>
Saturday<BR>
Sunday, certainly,<BR>
Assuredly there will come<BR>
Five ships and five hundred<BR>
That make supplication--<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>O Brithi, Brithi</I>!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Co-occupancy or battle</I>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 <I>Brithi, Brithanai</I>!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Before battle, battle of spears in the field</I>.<BR>
Son of the wood of Cogni,<BR>
There will be an adventuring of<BR>
Everyone to Adonai.<BR>
On the sward of Pwmpai.<BR>
An intimation they prophesy,<BR>
A long cry against overwhelming, <A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A><BR>
Long the public harmony<BR>
Of Cadwaladyr and Cynan.<BR>
30 The world's profit (is) small,<BR>
The heat of the sun is lost.<BR>
The Druid will prophesy<BR>
What has been will be.<BR>
Sky of Geirionydd,<BR>
I would go with thee<BR>
Gloomy like the evening,<BR>
In the recesses of the mountain.<BR>
When should be the full length<BR>
The Brython in chasing.<BR>
40 To the Brython there will be<BR>
Blood of glorious strenuousness,<BR>
After gold and golden trinkets.<BR>
The devastation of Moni and Lleeni,<BR>
And Eryri, a dwelling in it.<BR>
It is a perfect prophecy,<BR>
With dwellings laid waste.<BR>
The Cymry of four languages<BR>
Shall change their speech.<BR>
Until shall come the cow, the speckled cow<BR>
50 That shall cause a blessing<BR>
On a fine day lowing,<BR>
On a fine night being boiled,<BR>
On the land of the boiler,<BR>
In the ships of the consumer.<BR>
Let the song of woe be chaunted.<BR>
Around the encircling border of Prydain.<BR>
They will come, with one purpose,<BR>
To resist a maritime disgrace.<BR>
Be true the happiness<BR>
60 Of the sovereign of the world.<BR>
The worshippers adored together, <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A><BR>
To the dale of grievous water it was gone.<BR>
A portion full of corn<BR>
Invites conflagration.<BR>
Without Eppa, without a cow-stall.<BR>
Without a luxury of the world.<BR>
The world will be desolate, useless.<BR>
The deceitful will be fated.<BR>
Activity through freshness.<BR>
70 Small men are almost deceived<BR>
By the white-bellied trotter.<BR>
A hawk upon baptism<BR>
The swords of warriors will not pierce Cyllellawr.<BR>
They had not what they wished for.<BR>
Violent is the grasp of the townman,<BR>
And to warriors there is a love of blood.<BR>
Cymry, Angles, Gwyddyl, of Prydyn.<BR>
The Cymry, swift in mischief,<BR>
Will launch their ships on the lake.<BR>
80 The North has been poisoned by rovers<BR>
Of a livid hateful hue and form.<BR>
Of the race of Adam the ancient.<BR>
The third will be brought to set out,<BR>
Ravens of the accurate retinue,<BR>
The sluggish animals of Seithin.<BR>
On sea, an anchor on the Christian.<BR>
A cry from the sea, a cry from the mountain,<BR>
A cry from the sea, they vigorously utter.<BR>
Wood, field, dale, and hill.<BR>
90 Every speech without any one attending,<BR>
High minded from every place<BR>
There will be confusion.<BR>
A multitude enraged,<BR>
And distress diffused<BR>
Vengeances through ready belief abiding. <A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A><BR>
That the Creator afflicts, the powerful God of exalted state.<BR>
A long time before the day of doom.<BR>
There will come a day<BR>
And a reader will rise,<BR>
100 In the pleasant border of the land of Iwerdon,<BR>
To Prydain then will come exaltation,<BR>
Brython of the nobility of Rome.<BR>
There will be to me a judge unprejudiced, void of guile;<BR>
The astrologers (or diviners) prophesy,<BR>
In the land of the lost ones.<BR>
Druids prophesy<BR>
Beyond the sea, beyond the Brython.<BR>
The summer will not be serene weather,<BR>
The noblemen shall be broken,<BR>
110 It will come to them from treachery<BR>
Beyond the effusion of the father of Ked.<BR>
A thousand in the judgment of exalted Prydain,<BR>
And within its united boundary.<BR>
May I not fall into the embrace of the swamp,<BR>
Into the mob that peoples the depths of Uffern.<BR>
I greatly fear the flinty covering<BR>
With the Guledig of the boundless country.</P>
