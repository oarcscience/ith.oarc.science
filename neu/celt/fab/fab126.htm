<P>I. BRIGHT are the ash-tops; tall and white will they be<BR>
When they grow in the upper part of the dingle;<BR>
The languid heart, longing is her complaint.</P>
<P>II. Bright is the top of the cliff at the long midnight hour;<BR>
Every ingenious person will be honoured.<BR>
It is the duty of the fair one to afford sleep to him in pain.</P>
<P>III. Bright are the willow-tops; playful the fish<BR>
In the lake; the wind whistles over the tops of the branches;<BR>
Nature is superior to learning.</P>
<P>IV. Bright the tops of the furze; have confidence<BR>
In the wise; and to the unwise be repulsive;<BR>
Except God, there is none that divines.</P>
<P>V. Bright the tops of the clover; the timid has no heart;<BR>
Jealous ones weary themselves out;<BR>
Usual is care upon the weak.</P>
<P>VI. Bright the tops of reed-grass; furious is the jealous,<BR>
And he can hardly be satisfied;<BR>
It is the act of the wise to love with sincerity.</P>
<P>VII. Bright the mountain-tops; from the bluster of winter,<BR>
Withered and drooping is the tall grass;<BR>
Against famine there is no bashfulness.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_577"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 577</FONT></A></P>
<P>VIII. Bright the mountain-tops; intruding is the cold of<BR>
Winter; brittle are the reeds; rime is over the grave;<BR>
Imprudence committed violence in banishment.</P>
<P>IX. Bright the tops of the oak; bitter the ash-branches;<BR>
Sweet the cow-parsnip, the wave keeps laughing;<BR>
The cheek will not conceal the anguish of the heart.</P>
<P>X. Bright the tops of the dogrose; hardship has no formality;<BR>
Let every one preserve his purity of life.<BR>
The greatest blemish is ill-manners.</P>
<P>XI. Bright the tops of the broom; let the lover make assignations;<BR>
Very yellow are the clustered branches;<BR>
Shallow ford; the contented is apt to enjoy sleep.</P>
<P>XII. Bright the tops of the apple-tree; circumspect is<BR>
Every prudent one, a chider of another;<BR>
And after loving, indiscretion leaving it.</P>
<P>XIII. Bright the tops of the apple-tree; circumspect is<BR>
Every prudent one; in the long day a stagnant pool is malarious;<BR>
Thick is the veil on the light of the blind prisoner.</P>
<P>XIV. Bright the hazel-tops by the hill of Digoll;<BR>
Unafflicted will be every squabby one;<BR>
It is an act of the mighty to keep a treaty.</P>
<P>XV. Bright the tops of reeds; it is usual for the sluggish<BR>
To be heavy, and the young to be a learner;<BR>
None but the foolish will break the faith.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_578"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 578</FONT></A></P>
<P>XVI. Bright the tops of the lily; let every bold one be a servitor;<BR>
The word of a family will prevail;<BR>
Usual with the faithless, a broken word.</P>
<P>XVII. Bright the tops of the heath; usual is miscarriage<BR>
To the timid; water will be intrusive in front of the shore;<BR>
Usual with the faithful, an unbroken word.</P>
<P>XVIII. Bright the tops of rushes; cows are profitable,<BR>
Running are my tears this day;<BR>
Comfort for the miserable there is not.</P>
<P>XIX. Bright the tops of fern, yellow<BR>
The charlock; how reproachless are the blind;<BR>
How apt to run about are youngsters!</P>
<P>XX. Bright the tops of the service-tree; accustomed to care,<BR>
Is the aged one, and bees to the wilds<BR>
Except God, there is no avenger.</P>
<P>XXI. Bright the tops of the oak; incessant is the tempest;<BR>
The bees are high; brittle the dry brushwood;<BR>
Usual for the wanton to laugh excessively.</P>
<P>XXII. Bright the tops of the grove; constantly the trees<BR>
And the oak-leaves are falling;<BR>
Happy is he who sees the one he loves.</P>
<P>XXIII. Bright the tops of the oaks; coldly purls the stream;<BR>
Let the cattle be fetched to the birch-enclosed area;<BR>
Abruptly goes the arrow of the haughty to give pain.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_579"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 579</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXIV. Bright the tops of the hard holly, and others; let gold be distributed;<BR>
When all fall asleep on the rampart,<BR>
God will not sleep when He gives deliverance.</P>
<P>XXV. Bright the tops of the willows; inherently bold<BR>
Will the war-horse be in the long day, when leaves are abounding;<BR>
Those that have mutual friendship will not despise one another.</P>
<P>XXVI. Bright the tops of rushes; prickly will they be<BR>
When spread under the pillow;<BR>
The wanton mind will be haughty.</P>
<P>XXVII. Bright the tops of the hawthorn; confident is the sight of the steed;<BR>
It is usual for a lover to be a pursuer;<BR>
May the diligent messenger do good.</P>
<P>XXVIII. Bright the tops of cresses; warlike is the steed;<BR>
Trees are fair ornaments for the ground;<BR>
Joyful the soul with what it loves.</P>
<P>XXIX. Bright is the top of the bush; valuable the steed;<BR>
It is good to have discretion with strength;<BR>
Let the unskilful be made powerless.</P>
<P>XXX. Bright are the tops of the brakes; gay the plumage<BR>
Of birds; the long day is the gift of the light;<BR>
Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_580"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 580</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXI. Bright the tops of the meadow sweet; and music<BR>
In the grove; bold the wind, the trees shake;<BR>
Interceding with the obdurate will not avail.</P>
<P>XXXII. Bright the tops of the elder-trees; bold is the solitary songster;<BR>
Accustomed is the violent to oppress;<BR>
Woe to him who takes a reward from the hand.</P>
