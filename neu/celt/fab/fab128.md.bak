### CXIII.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST XIII.

I. MAENWYN, when I was of thy age,  
My garment should not be trodden under foot,  
My land should not be ploughed without blood.

II\. Maenwyn, when I was opposed to thee,  
With youth attendant on me,  
The foe would not break my boundary.

III\. Maenwyn, while I was in pursuit of thee,  
Following my youth,  
The foe loved not the fury of my resentment.

IV\. Maenwyn, while I was young and plump,  
Addicted to fierce slaughter,  
I would perform the acts of a man, though I was but a youth.

V. Maenwyn, take thy aim discreetly;  
There is need of advice on him who is in error:  
Let Maelgwn provide another mayor.

VI\. My choice is a portion, with its sheath on it,  
And sharp-pointed as a thorn;  
It is not labour lost for me to whet a stone.

VII\. A present was bestowed on me from the vale  
Of Mewyrniawn, concealed in a bucket,  
A sharp iron projecting from the hand.

VIII\. Blessed be the solitary hag,  
That said from the door of her cell,  
"Maenwyn, do not deliver up thy knife."
