### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN II.

A DREAM I happen to see last night; clever is he that can interpret
it.  
It shall not be related to the wanton; he that will not conceal it shall
know it not.  
It is an act of the gentle to govern the multitude. Pleasure is not the
wealth of a country.  
Have I not been under the same covering with a fair maid of the hue of
the billow of the strand?  
Labour bestowed on anything good is no pain, and the remembrance of it
will last.  
Worse is my trouble to answer him who is not acquainted with it.  
It is no reparation for an evil deed, a desistence after it is done.  
One's benefit does not appear when it is asked for in a round about way:
thou hadst better keep to what there is. <span id="page_498">p.

And associate with the virtuous, and be resolute as to what may
happen.  
10 He that frequently commits crime will at last be caught.  
He that will not relate a thing fully, will not find himself
contradicted.  
Riches will not flourish with the wicked. Mass will not be sung on a
retreat.  
A sigh is no protection against the vile. He that is not liberal does
not deserve the name.
