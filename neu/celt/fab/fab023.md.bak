### VII.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXXI.

WHAT man is the porter?  
Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr.  
Who is the man that asks it?  
Arthur and the fair Cai.  
How goes it with thee?  
Truly in the best way in the world.  
Into my house thou shalt not come, <span id="page_262">p. 262</span>  
Unless thou prevailest,  
I forbid it.  
10 Thou shalt see it.  
If Wythnaint were to go,  
The three would be unlucky:--  
Mabon, the, son of Mydron,  
The servant of Uthir Pendragon;  
Cysgaint, the son of Banon;  
And Gwyn Godybrion.  
Terrible were my servants  
Defending their rights.  
Manawydan, the son of Llyr,  
20 Deep was his counsel.  
Did not Manawyd bring  
Perforated shields from Trywruid?  
And Mabon, the son of Mellt,  
Spotted the grass with blood?  
And Anwas Adeiniog,  
And Llwch Llawynnog--  
Guardians were they  
On Eiddyn Cymminog,  
A chieftain that patronised them.  
30 He would have his will and make redress.  
Cai entreated him,  
While he idled every third person.  
When Celli was lost  
Cuelli was found; and rejoiced  
Cai, as long as he hewed down.  
Arthur distributed gifts,  
The blood trickled down.  
In the hall of Awarnach,  
Fighting with a hag,  
40 He cleft the head of Palach.  
In the fastnesses of Dissethach, <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>  
In Mynyd Eiddyn,  
He contended with Cynvyn;  
By the hundred there they fell,  
There they fell by the hundred,  
Before the accomplished Bedwyr.  
On the strands of Trywruid,  
Contending with Garwlwyd,  
Brave was his disposition,  
50 With sword and shield;  
Vanity were the foremost men  
Compared with Cai in the battle.  
The sword in the battle  
Was unerring in his hand.  
They were stanch commanders  
Of a legion for the benefit of the country--  
Bedwyr and Bridlaw;  
Nine hundred would to them listen;  
Six hundred gasping for breath  
60 Would be the cost of attacking them.  
Servants I have had,  
Better it was when they were.  
Before the chiefs of Emrais  
I saw Cai in haste.  
Booty for chieftains  
Was Gwrhir among foes,  
Heavy was his vengeance,  
Severe his advance.  
When he drank from the horn,  
70 He would drink with four.  
To battle when he would come  
By the hundred would he slaughter;  
There was no day that would satisfy him.  
Unmerited was the death of Cai.  
Cai the fair, and Llachau, <span id="page_264">p. 264</span>  
Battles did they sustain,  
Before the pang of blue shafts.  
In the heights of Ystavingon  
Cai pierced nine witches.  
80 Cai the fair went to Mona,  
To devastate Llewon.  
His shield was ready  
Against Cath Palug  
When the people welcomed him.  
Who pierced the Cath Palug?  
Nine score before dawn  
Would fall for its food.  
Nine score chieftains.
