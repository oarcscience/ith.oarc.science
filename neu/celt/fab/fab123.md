VI\. Usual an eagle's nest in the top of the oak,  
And in the congress-house, men of renown;  
The eye of the fond one is on whom he loves.

Of winter, with the eloquent men of spears;  
Usual for the hearth of the faithless to be a desert.

VIII\. Dried is the reed; there is flood in the brook;  
The commerce of the Saxon is with money;  
Unhappy is the soul of the mother of unfaithful children.

Woe to it as to its fate;  
It is old--this year it was born.

X. Though it may be small, yet ingeniously  
Do the birds build in the summit of trees  
Of equal age will be the good and the happy.

XI\. Cold and wet is the mountain; cold and gray the ice;  
Trust in God--he will not deceive thee;  
Persevering patience will not leave thee long afflicted.
