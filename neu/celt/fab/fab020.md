### IV.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLI.

MADAWG, the joy of the wall,  
Madawg, before he was in the grave,  
Was a fortress of abundance  
Of games, and society.  
The son of Uthyr before he was slain,  
From his hand he pledged thee.  
Erof the cruel came,  
Of impotent joy;  
Of impotent sorrow.  
10 Erof the cruel caused  
Treacheries to Jesus.  
Though he believed.  
The earth quaking,  
And the elements darkening,  
And a shadow on the world,  
And baptism trembling.  
An impotent stop  
Was taken by fierce Erof,  
Going in the course of things  
20 Among the hideous fiends  
Even to the bottom of Uffern.
