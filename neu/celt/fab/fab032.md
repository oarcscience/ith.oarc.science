### XVI.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXXV.

HORSEMAN resorts to the city,  
With his white dogs, and large horns;  
I, who have not before seen thee, know thee not.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

II\. A horseman resorts to the river's mouth,  
On a stout and warlike steed;  
Come with me, let me not be refused.

III\. I will not go that way at present;  
Bear with the conduct of the delayer;  
And may the blessing of heaven and earth come (upon thee).

IV, Thou, who hast not seen me daily,  
And who resemblest a prudent man,  
How long wilt thou absent thyself, and when wilt thou come?

V. When I return from Caer Seon,  
From contending with Jews,  
I will come to the city of Lleu and Gwidion.

VI\. Come with me into the city,  
Thou shalt have wine which I have set apart,  
And pure gold on thy clasp.

VII\. I know not the confident man,  
Who owns a fire and a couch;  
Fairly and sweetly dost thou speak.

VIII\. Come with me to my dwelling,  
Thou shalt have high foaming wine.  
My name is Ugnach, the son of Mydno.

IX\. Ugnach! a blessing on thy throne!  
And mayst thou have grace and honour!  
I am Taliessin who will repay thee thy banquet.

X. Taliessin, chief of men.  
Victor in the contest of song,  
Remain here until Wednesday.

XI\. Ugnach! the most affluent in riches,  
Grace be to thee from the highest region;  
I will not deserve blame; I will not tarry.
