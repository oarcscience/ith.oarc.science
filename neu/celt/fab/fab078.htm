<P>I. STAND forth, maidens, and survey the land<BR>
Of Cyndylan; Llys Pengwern, is it not in flames?<BR>
Woe to the youth that longs for good fellowship.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_449"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 449</FONT></A></P>
<P>II. One tree with the tendril on it<BR>
Is escaping it may be,<BR>
But what God shall have willed, let it come!</P>
<P>III. Cyndylan, with heart like the ice of winter,<BR>
With thrust of wild boar through his head,<BR>
Thou hast dispensed the ale of Tren!</P>
<P>IV. Cyndylan, with heart like the fire of spring,<BR>
By the common oath, in the midst of the common speech,<BR>
Defending Tren, that wasted town!</P>
<P>V. Cyndylan, bright pillar of his country,<BR>
Chain-bearer, obstinate in fight,<BR>
Protected Tren, the town of his father!</P>
<P>VI. Cyndylan, bright intelligence departed,<BR>
Chain-bearer, obstinate in the host,<BR>
Protected Tren as long as be was living.</P>
<P>VII. Cyndylan, with heart of greyhound,<BR>
When he descended to the turmoil of battle,<BR>
A carnage he carved out.</P>
<P>VIII. Cyndylan, with heart of hawk,<BR>
Was the true enraged<BR>
Cub of Cyndrwyn, the stubborn one.</P>
<P>IX. Cyndylan, with heart of wild boar,<BR>
When he descended to the onset of battle,<BR>
There was carnage in two heaps.</P>
<P>X. Cyndylan, hungry boar, ravager,<BR>
Lion, wolf fast holding of descent,<BR>
The wild boar will not give back the town of his father.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_450"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 450</FONT></A></P>
<P>XI. Cyndylan! while towards thee fled<BR>
His heart, it was a great festival<BR>
With him, like the press of the battle!</P>
<P>XII. Cyndylan of Powys purple gallant is he!<BR>
The strangers' refuge, their life's anchor,<BR>
Cub of Cyndrwyn, much to be lamented!</P>
<P>XIII. Cyndylan, fair son of Cyndrwyn,<BR>
No fitting garb is the beard about the nose,<BR>
Will a man be no better than a maid?</P>
<P>XIV. Cyndylan! a cause of grief thou art<BR>
Set forward will not be the array,<BR>
Around the pressure of the covert of thy shield!</P>
<P>XV. Cyndylan, keep thou the slope<BR>
Till the Lloegrians come to-day,<BR>
Anxiety on account of one is not fitting.</P>
<P>XVI. Cyndylan, keep thou the top<BR>
Till the Lloegrians come through Tren,<BR>
'Tis not called a wood for one tree!</P>
<P>XVII. My heart has great misery<BR>
In joining together the black boards,<BR>
Fair is the flesh of Cyndylan, the common grief of a hundred hosts!</P>
<P>XVIII. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<BR>
To-night, without fire, without bed!<BR>
I'll weep a while, afterwards I shall be silent.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_451"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 451</FONT></A></P>
<P>XIX. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<BR>
To-night, without fire, without candle!<BR>
Except God, who will give me patience?</P>
<P>XX. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<BR>
To-night, without fire, without light,<BR>
Let there come spreading silence around thee!</P>
<P>XXI. The Hall of Cyndylan! dark<BR>
Its roof, after the fair assemblage!<BR>
Alas, it makes not well its end!</P>
<P>XXII. The Hall of Cyndylan! art thou not<BR>
Without seemliness? in the grave is thy shield!<BR>
As long as he was living there was no break in the shingle.</P>
<P>XXII. The Hall of Cyndylan is forlorn<BR>
To-night, since there has been no one owning it,<BR>
Ah! death will not leave me long!</P>
<P>XXIV. The Hall of Cyndylan is not pleasant<BR>
To-night, on the top of Carrec Hytwyth,<BR>
Without lord, without company, without feast!</P>
<P>XXV. The Hall of Cyndylan is gloomy<BR>
To-night, without fire, without songs--<BR>
Tears are the trouble of my cheeks!</P>
<P>xxvi. The Hall of Cyndylan is gloomy<BR>
To-night, without family,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P>
<P><A NAME="page_452"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 452</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXVII. The Hall of Cyndylan pierces me<BR>
To see it, without roof, without fire.<BR>
Dead is my chief, myself alive!</P>
<P>XXVIII. The Hall of Cyndylan lies waste<BR>
To-night, after warriors contended,<BR>
Elvan, Cyndylan Caeawc!</P>
<P>XXIX. The Hall of Cyndylan is piercing cold<BR>
To-night, after the honour that befel me.<BR>
Without the men, without the women it sheltered.</P>
<P>XXX. The Hall of Cyndylan is still<BR>
To-night, after losing its elder.<BR>
The great merciful God! what shall I do?</P>
<P>XXXI. The Hall of Cyndylan! dark is its roof<BR>
Since the destruction by the Loegrians<BR>
Cyndylan and Elvan of Powys.</P>
<P>XXXII. The Hall of Cyndylan is dark<BR>
To-night, of the children of Cyndrwyn,<BR>
Cynon and Gwiawn and Gwyn.</P>
<P>XXXIII. The Hall of Cyndylan pierces me<BR>
Every hour, after the great gathering din at the fire<BR>
Which I saw at thy fire-hearth!</P>
<P>XXXIV. The eagle of Eli, loud his cry:<BR>
He has swallowed fresh drink,<BR>
Heart-blood of Cyndylan fair!</P>
<P>XXXV. The eagle of Eli screams aloud<BR>
To-night, in the blood of fair men he wallows!<BR>
He is in the wood, a heavy grief to me!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_453"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 453</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXXVI. The eagle of Eli I bear<BR>
To-night, bloody is he, I defy not,<BR>
He is in the wood, a heavy grief to me!</P>
<P>XXXVII. The eagle of Eli, let him afflict<BR>
To-night the vale of illustrious Meissir,<BR>
Brochwael's land, long let him affront it!</P>
<P>XXXVIII. The eagle of Eli keeps the seas;<BR>
He will not course the fish in the Aber.<BR>
Let him call, let him look out for the blood of men!</P>
<P>XXXIX. The eagle of Eli traverses<BR>
The wood at dawn to feast,<BR>
His greed, may his boldness prosper it!</P>
<P>XL The eagle of Pengwern with the gray horn-beak,<BR>
Very loud his echoing voice,<BR>
Eager for the flesh.</P>
<P>XLI. The eagle of Pengwern with the gray horn-beak,<BR>
Very loud his call of defiance,<BR>
Eager for the flesh of Cyndylan!</P>
<P>XLII. The eagle of Pengwern with the gray born-beak,<BR>
Very loud his clamour,<BR>
Eager for the. flesh of him I love!</P>
<P>XLIII. The eagle of Pengwern! from afar is his call<BR>
To-night, for the men of blood is his look-out,<BR>
Truly will Tren be called the ruined town!</P>
<P>XLIV. The eagle of Pengwern! from afar let him call<BR>
To-night, for the blood of men let him look out,<BR>
Truly will Tren be called the town of flame!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_454"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 454</FONT></A></P>
<P>XLV. The churches of Bassa! there rests<BR>
To-night, there ends, there shrinks within himself,<BR>
The shelter in battle, heart of the men of Argoed!</P>
<P>XLVI. The churches of Bassa are enriched<BR>
To-night, my tongue hath done it!<BR>
Ruddy are they, overflowing my grief!</P>
<P>XLVII. The churches of Bassa are close neighbouring<BR>
To-night to the heir of Cyndrwyn,<BR>
Graveyard of Cyndylan fair!</P>
<P>XLVIII. The churches of Bassa are lovely<BR>
To-night, their clover hath made them so,<BR>
Ruddy are they, overflowing my heart!</P>
<P>XLIX. The churches of Bassa have lost their privilege<BR>
Since the destruction by the Lloegrians<BR>
Of Cyndylan and Elvan of Powys.</P>
<P>L. The churches of Bassa are to make an end<BR>
To-night; the warriors are not to continue.<BR>
He knows who knoweth all things, and I here know.</P>
<P>LI. The churches of Bassa are still<BR>
To-night, and I am to cry!<BR>
Ruddy are they, overflowing is my lament.</P>
<P>LII. The White Town in the bosom of the wood!<BR>
There has ever been of its lustyhood,<BR>
On the surface of the grass, the blood!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_455"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 455</FONT></A></P>
<P>LIII. The White Town in the country side!<BR>
Its lustyhood, its gray thoughtfulness,<BR>
The blood under the feet of its warriors!</P>
<P>LIV. The White Town in the valley!<BR>
Joyful its troop with the common spoil<BR>
Of battle, its people, are they not gone?</P>
<P>LV. The White Town between Tren and Trodwyd!<BR>
More common was the broken shield<BR>
Coming from battle than the evening ox.</P>
<P>LVI. The White Town between Tren and Traval.<BR>
More common was the blood<BR>
On the surface of the grass than the ploughed fallow.</P>
<P>LVII. Alas, Ffreuer! how sad is it<BR>
To-night, after the loss of kindred.<BR>
By the mishap of my tongue were they slain.</P>
<P>LVIII. Alas, Ffreuer! how languid she is<BR>
To-night, after the death of Elvan,<BR>
And the eagle of Cyndrwyn, Cyndylan.</P>
<P>LIX. It is not the death of Ffreuer that separates me<BR>
To-night from the enjoyment of the social circle.<BR>
I will keep awake, I will early weep.</P>
<P>LX. It is not the death of Ffreuer that pierces me with pain.<BR>
From the beginning of night till midnight<BR>
I will keep awake, I will weep with the dawn.</P>
<P>LXI. It is not the death of Ffreuer that stares me<BR>
To-night, and causes my checks to be yellow,<BR>
And the red tears to flow over the bedside.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_456"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 456</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXII. It is not the death of Ffreuer that I am tormented with<BR>
To-night, but myself, being feebly sick,<BR>
My brothers and my country I mourn.</P>
<P>LXIII. Fair Ffreuer! there are brothers who cherish thee,<BR>
And who have not sprung from the ungenerous;<BR>
They are men who cherish no timidity.</P>
<P>LXIV. Fair Ffreuer! to thee have been brothers;<BR>
When they heard the meeting of armies<BR>
Their confidence would not fail them.</P>
<P>LXV. I and Ffreuer and Medlan,<BR>
While there may be battle in every place,<BR>
Are not concerned if our side be not slain.</P>
<P>LXVI. The mountain, were it still higher<BR>
I will not covet, there to lead my life.<BR>
Light of valuable things is my clothing.</P>
<P>LXVII. Parallel with the Avaerwy,<BR>
The Tren enters the Trydonwy,<BR>
And the Twrch falls into the Marchnwy.</P>
<P>LXVIII. Parallel with the Elwydden,<BR>
The Trydonwy flows into the Tren,<BR>
And the Geirw flows into the Alwen.</P>
<P>LXIX. Before my covering was made of the hide<BR>
Of the hardy goat, intent I was on carnage;<BR>
I was made drunk with the mead of Bryum.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_467"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 467</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXX. Before my covering was made of the hide<BR>
Of the hardy goat, the young goat to the holly,<BR>
I was made drunk with the mead of Tren.</P>
<P>LXXI. After my brethren from the region of the Hafren,<BR>
And about the two banks of the Dwyryw,<BR>
Woe is me, God, that I am alive!</P>
<P>LXXII. After well-trained horses and garments of ruddy hue,<BR>
And the waving yellow plumes,<BR>
Slender is my leg, a covering is not left me.</P>
<P>LXXIII. The cattle of Edeyrniawn went not astray,<BR>
And with none did they go away,<BR>
In the lifetime of Gorwynion, a man of Uchnant.</P>
<P>LXXIV. The cattle of Edeyrniawn went not astray,<BR>
And with none did they wander,<BR>
In the lifetime of Gowrynion, a man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>
Reproach is known to the herdsman.<BR>
The price is shame and refusal.<BR>
On such as come to disgrace it will befall.<BR>
I know what is good,<BR>
The blood of one hero for another.</P>
<P>LXXV. Were it the wife of Gyrthmwl, she would be languid<BR>
This day; loud would be her scream;<BR>
She would deplore the loss of her heroes.</P>
<P>LXXVI. The soil of Ercal is on courageous men,<BR>
On the progeny of Moryal,<BR>
And after Rys great lamentation.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_458"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 458</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXXVII. The hawk of Heledd calls unto me<BR>
"O God! why is it that to thee have been given<BR>
The horses of my country and their land?</P>
<P>LXXVIII. The hawk of Heledd will greet me<BR>
"O God I why is it that to thee are given the dark coloured harness<BR>
Of Cyndylan and his forty horses?"</P>
<P>LXXIX. Have I not gazed with my eyes on pleasant land<BR>
From the conspicuous seat of Gorwynion?<BR>
Long the course of the run, longer my recollection.</P>
<P>LXXX Have I not gazed from Dinlle<BR>
Wrecon on the patrimony of Ffreuer,<BR>
With grief for its social enjoyment?</P>
<P>LXXXI. A horseman from a Caer below,<BR>
He was slow in his complaints.<BR>
A man of Sannair--</P>
<P>LXXXII. Slain were my brothers all at once--<BR>
Cynan, Cyndylan, Cynwraith--<BR>
In defending Tren, a town laid waste.</P>
<P>LXXXIII. A tribe would not tread on the nest<BR>
Of Cynddylan; he would never flinch a foot;<BR>
His mother nursed no weakling son.</P>
<P>LXXXIV. Brethren I have had who never were dejected,<BR>
Who grew up like hazel saplings;<BR>
One by one, they are all gone.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_459"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 459</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXXXV. Brethren I have had whom God has taken<BR>
From me; my misfortune caused it.<BR>
They would not purchase glory by false means.</P>
<P>LXXXVI. Thin the gale, thick the rumour,.<BR>
Sweet the furrows; thou that made them remain not;<BR>
Those who have been are no more.</P>
<P>LXXXVII. What is heard by God and man,<BR>
What is heard by young and old,<BR>
Disgrace of beards, let the flier loose.</P>
<P>LXXXVIII. While it lives the flier will fly<BR>
With garments waiting for the battlefield,<BR>
And with blue blades the chief was enlivened.</P>
<P>LXXXIX. I wonder the bright fort is no more<BR>
After its defenders notoriously skilful<BR>
In the lair of the boar there is breaking of pignuts.</P>
<P>XC. They are neither mist nor smoke,<BR>
Nor warriors in mutual defence.<BR>
In a meadow slaughter is bad.</P>
<P>XCI. I listened in the meadow to the clatter of shields.<BR>
A fortress is no restraint to the mighty,<BR>
The best of men, Caranmael.</P>
<P>XCII. Caranmael, pressure there is on thee;<BR>
I know thy retreat from battle.<BR>
A mark is wont on the brow of a combatant.</P>
<P>XCIII. Accustomed to exert a liberal hand,<BR>
The son of Cyndylan, retainer of praise,<BR>
The last man of Cyndrwyn, Caranmael.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_460"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 460</FONT></A></P>
<P>XCIV. Devoid of zeal was he,<BR>
And his patrimony was sequestrated,<BR>
Who sought Caranmael for a judge.</P>
<P>XCV. Caranmael, intimate with exertion,<BR>
Son of Cyndylan of ready fame,<BR>
Was not a judge, though he would wist to be.</P>
<P>XCVI. Where Caranmael put on the corselet of Cyndylan,<BR>
And pushed forward his ashen spear,<BR>
A Frank should not deprive him of his head.</P>
<P>XCVII. The time when I fared on rich viands<BR>
I would not lift my thigh<BR>
For a man that complained of a sore disease.</P>
<P>XCVIII. Brothers I also have had<BR>
That would not complain of pestilential diseases:<BR>
One was Elvan, Cyndylan another.</P>
<P>XCIX. Hair is not gracefully worn, is it not becoming<BR>
A man in the heat of conflict?<BR>
My brethren were not clamorous.</P>
<P>C. But for death and its fearful afflictions,<BR>
And the pang of the blue blades,<BR>
I will not be clamorous either.</P>
<P>CI. The plain of Maodyn, is it not covered with frost?<BR>
Since the destruction of him who was of benevolent purpose<BR>
On the grave of Eirinwed thick the snow.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_461"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 461</FONT></A></P>
<P>CII. The mound of Elwyddan, is it not drenched with rain,<BR>
And the plain of Maodyn below it?<BR>
Cynon ought to deplore him.</P>
<P>CIII. Four equal brothers to me have been,<BR>
And each was the head of a family.<BR>
Tren knows to itself no owner.</P>
<P>CIV. Four equal brothers to me have been,<BR>
And to each chief there was vigour.<BR>
Tren knows no congenial owner.</P>
<P>CV. Four equal courageous and comely<BR>
Brothers to me have been from Cyndrwyn.<BR>
There is not to Tren the possession of enjoyment.</P>
<P>CVI. Fly thee hence, and array thyself<BR>
Thou art not wont to rise with the dawn.<BR>
Am I not wounded by a spike from the comer of thy bag?</P>
<P>CVII. Fly thee hence and hide thyself<BR>
Thou art not of sinless conversation..<BR>
Prostration is useless, thy creeping will cause a noise.</P>
