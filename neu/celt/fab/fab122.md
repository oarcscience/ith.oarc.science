### RED BOOK OF HERGEST V.

I. LET the cock's comb be red; naturally loud  
Be his voice, from his triumphant bed:  
Man's rejoicing, God will recommend.

II\. Let the swineherds be merry at the sighing  
Of the wind; let the silent be graceful;  
Let the vicious be accustomed to misfortune.

III\. Let the bailiff impeach; let evil be a tormentor;  
Let clothes be fitting;  
He that loves a bard, let him be a handsome giver.

IV\. Let a monarch be vehement, and let him be brave;  
And let there be a hurdle on the gap;  
He will not show his face that will not give.

V. Fleet let the racers be on the side  
Of the mountain; let care be in the bosom;  
Unfaithful let the inconstant be.

VI\. Let the knight be conspicuous; let the thief be wary;  
The rich woman may be deceived;  
The friend of the wolf is the lazy shepherd.

VII\. Let the knight be conspicuous: fleet be the horse;  
Let the scholar be ambitious;  
Let the prevaricating one be unfaithful.

VIII\. Let cows be round-backed; let the wolf be gray;  
Let the horse over barley be swift;  
Like gossamer will he press the grain at the roots.

IX\. Let the deaf be bent; let the captive be heavy  
Nimble the horse in battles;  
Like gossamer will he press the grain the ground.

X. Let the deaf be dubious; let the rash be inconstant;  
Let the mischievous wrangle;  
The prudent need but be seen to be loved.

XI\. Let the lake be deep; let the spears be sharp;  
Let the brow of the sick be bold at the shout of war;  
Let the wise be happy--God commends him.

XII\. Let the exile wander; let the brave be impulsive;  
Let the fool be fond of laughter.

XIII\. Let the furrows be wet; let bail be frequent;  
Let the sick be complaining, and the one in health merry;  
Let the lapdog snarl; let the hag be peevish.

XIV\. Let him that is in pain cry out; let an army be moving;  
Let the well-fed be wanton;  
Let the strong be bold; let the hill be icy.

XV\. Let the gull be white; let the wave be loud;  
Let the gore be apt to clot on the ashen spear.  
Let the ice be gray; let the heart be bold.

XVI\. Let the camp be green; let the suitor be reproachless;  
Let there be pushing of spears in the defile;  
Let the bad woman be with frequent reproaches.

XVII\. Let the hen be clawed; let the lion roar;  
Let the foolish be pugnacious;  
Let the heart be broken with grief.

XVIII\. Let the tower be white; let the harness glitter;  
Let there be beauty--many will desire it;  
Let the glutton hanker; let the old man mediate.
