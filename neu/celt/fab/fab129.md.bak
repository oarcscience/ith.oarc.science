### CXIV.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST IV.

I. MOUNTAIN snow--every region is white;  
The raven is accustomed to sing.  
No good will come from long sleeping.

II\. Mountain snow--white the ravine;  
From the assault of the wind trees will bend.  
Many a two may mutually love,  
But never come together.

III\. Mountain snow--the wind scatters it;  
Broad the moon's orb, green the dock-leaves.  
The mischievous man is seldom without claim.

IV\. Mountain snow--fleet the hart;  
Common in Prydein is a daring race.  
Understanding is necessary for the alien.

V. Mountain snow--the hart in the warmth;  
Ducks in the pond, white the foam.  
Slow is the aged, and easily overtaken.

VI\. Mountain snow--the hart is roaming;  
The countenance smiles on whom one loves.  
As long as a tale is told me,  
I know where there is disgrace.

<span id="page_587">p. 587</span>

VII\. Mountain snow--the strand is white and pebbly;  
The fishes in the ford may go to the cavern.  
Odious is he that imposes burdens.

VIII\. Mountain snow--the hart in the retreat;  
It is usual for a chieftain to have splendid arms,  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
And for misfortune to fall on the beard.

IX\. Mountain snow--the hart is plump and round;  
I have said a great deal; if I am not mistaken,  
This is unlike a summer day.

X. Mountain snow--the hart is hunted;  
The wind whistles over the eaves.  
Sin is a very great heap.

XI\. Mountain snow--the hart is leaping;  
The wind whistles over the high white wall.  
It is natural the calm should be graceful.

XII\. Mountain snow--the hart in the vale;  
The wind whistles above the house-top.  
Evil will not conceal itself where it is.

XIII\. Mountain snow--the hart on the strand;  
The aged has lost his juvenility.  
. . . makes a man captive.

XIV\. Mountain snow--the hart in the bush;  
Thoroughly black the raven; swift the young roebuck.  
If one is free and healthy, it is strange there should be complaining.

<span id="page_588">p. 588</span>

XV\. Mountain snow--the hart in the rushes;  
Cold the quagmire; the mead is in the brewing-tub.  
The injured is accustomed to complain.

XVI\. Mountain snow--variegated the front of the tower;  
Let the cattle seek shelter.  
Woe to the wife that should get a bad husband.

XVII\. Mountain snow--variegated the side of the cliff;  
Dried the stalk; the water-lily droops.  
Woe to the man that should have a bad wife.

XVIII\. Mountain snow--the hart in the ditch;  
Congenial to the thief is long night.  
Let the bees sleep in the shelter.

XIX\. Mountain snow--slow is  
The growth of the liverwort.  
The sluggard will not soon avenge an injury.

XX\. Mountain snow--the fish in the lake;  
Proud the hawk; people cluster around monarchs.  
Every one cannot get what he wishes.

XXI\. Mountain snow--red the top of the fir;  
Wrathful the push of many spears.  
Alas, for longing, my brethren

XXII\. Mountain snow--swift the wolf;  
The side of the desert he will penetrate.  
Every blemish is common on the destitute of zeal.

XXIII\. Mountain snow--not slow the hart;  
Rain falls from the sky.  
Sorrow produces complete depression of spirits.

<span id="page_589">p. 589</span>

XXIV\. Mountain snow--noisy the roebuck;  
The waves wash the margin of the strand;  
Let the skilful conceal his design.

XXV\. Mountain snow--the hart in the glen;  
Summer will be placid; calm the lake.  
The gray-bearded in frost has a strong support,

XXVI\. Mountain snow--variegated the breast of the goose;  
Strong my arm and shoulder.  
I pray that I may not be a hundred years old.

XXVII\. Mountain snow--bare the stalk-tops;  
Bent the branches of trees; the fish are in the deep.  
Where there is no learning there will be no natural gift.

XXVIII\. Mountain snow--the fish in the ford;  
Let the lean and stooping stag seek the sheltered vale.  
Longing for the dead will not avail.

XXIX Mountain snow--the hart in the wood;  
The discreet will not walk on foot.  
The timid causes many a delay.

XXX\. Mountain snow--the hart on the slope;  
The wind whistles over the ash-tops.  
A third foot for the aged is his stick.

XXXI\. Mountain snow--the hart is upon it;  
The ducks are in the lake; white the water-lily.  
The vicious is not disposed to listen.

<span id="page_590">p. 590</span>

XXXII\. Mountain snow--ruddy the feet of hens;  
Shallow the water; it makes much noise.  
The disgrace that is boasted of is augmented.

XXXIII\. Mountain snow--nimble the hart;  
Hardly anything in the world interests me.  
Admonition to the depraved will not avail.

XXXIV\. Mountain snow--white its fleece;  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

XXXV\. Mountain snow--white the roofs of houses;  
If the tongue were to relate what the bosom knows,  
None would be neighbours.

XXXVI\. Mountain snow--let the wise move about in the day;  
Let every pensive one be ill, every bush bare.  
It is usual that the unwise should have all faults.
