<P>IN the name of the Ruler of heaven, the mighty one<BR>
The supporter of his friends shall keep possession of his towns,<BR>
Splendid his princely spear.<BR>
Warlike kings spear-scouting.<BR>
He will defend the pleasant plain of Lleenawg;<BR>
The ruthless pushing shafts are broken.<BR>
Long they will experience<BR>
The gratitude of Prydain.<BR>
From the bush of Maw and Eiddyn,<BR>
10 They would not take opposition.<BR>
Friendly the aid of Clydwyn.<BR>
May I be satisfied! He supplied his fleet<BR>
From spears until the shafts were heated.<BR>
A coffin to every one his ambition.<BR>
They cannot reckon the battles fought<BR>
By Gwallawg. Better is wild food than a she-bear.<BR>
A battle in Agathes in defence,<BR>
Praise his active judgment caused.<BR>
A battle in the region of Bretrwyn with heat,<BR>
20 A great fire. Limited is his vehemence.<BR>
A battle, there was a rule of general benefit.<BR>
A battle, a battle of trembling in Aeron.<BR>
A battle in Arddunion and Aeron.<BR>
Bring reproach to the youths.<BR>
A battle in the wood of Beit at the close of the day.<BR>
Thou didst not think of thy foes.<BR>
A battle in the presence of Mabon.<A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A><BR>
He will not mention the contradiction of the saved.<BR>
A battle in Gwensteri, and thou subduest Lloegyr.<BR>
30 A darting of spears there is made.<BR>
A battle in the marsh of Terra with the dawn,<BR>
Easily broken (was) the terrible arch,<BR>
At the first littering of the word,<BR>
Of kings who were extinguished in the war.<BR>
Men with full intent to obtain cattle.<BR>
Haearddur and Hyveidd and Gwallawg,<BR>
And Owen of Mona of Maelgwnian quality,<BR>
Will lay the Peithwyr prostrate,<BR>
At the end of the wood of Cleddyfein,<BR>
40 From which there will be pierced corpses,<BR>
And the ravens wandering about.<BR>
In Prydain, in Eiddyn, acknowledged.<BR>
In Gafran, in the retreat of Brecheinawc.<BR>
In energy, in exalted covering.<BR>
He sees not a hero, who saw not Gwallawg.</P>
