### CX.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST VIII.

1\. ENTANGLING is the snare, clustered is the ash;  
The ducks are in the pond; white breaks the wave;  
More powerful than a hundred is the counsel of the heart.

II\. Long the night, boisterous is the sea-shore;  
Usual a tumult in a congregation;  
The vicious will not agree with the good.

III\. Long the night, boisterous is the mountain,  
The wind whistles over the tops of trees;  
Ill-nature will not deceive the discreet.

IV\. The saplings of the green-topped birch  
Will extricate my foot from the shackle;  
Disclose not thy secret to a youth.

V. The saplings of oaks in the grove  
Will extricate my foot from the chain;  
Disclose no secret to a maid.

VI\. The saplings of the leafy oaks  
Will extricate my foot from the prison;  
Divulge no secret to a babbler.

VII\. The saplings of bramble have berries on them;  
The thrush is on her nest;  
And the liar will never be silent.

VIII\. Rain without, the fern is drenched;  
White the gravel of the sea; there is spray on the margin;  
Reason is the fairest lamp for man.

IX\. Rain without, near is the shelter,  
The furze yellow; the cow-parsnip withered and dry;  
God the Creator! why hast thou made a coward?

X. Rain without, my hair is drenched;  
Full of complaint is the feeble; steep the cliff;  
Pale white is the sea; salt is the brine.

XI\. Rain without, the ocean is drenched;  
The wind whistles over the tops of the reeds;  
After every feat, still without the genius.
