### XCII.

### SONG TO THE WIND.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XVII.

GUESS who it is.  
Created before the deluge.  
A creature strong,  
Without flesh, without bone,  
Without veins, without blood,  
Without head, and without feet.  
It will not be older, it will not be younger,  
Than it was in the beginning.  
There will not come from his design  
10 Fear or death.  
He has no wants  
From creatures.  
Great God! the sea whitens <span id="page_536">p. 536</span>  
When it comes from the beginning.  
Great his beauties,  
The one that made him.  
He, in the field, he, in the wood,  
Without hand and without foot.  
Without old age, without age.  
20 Without the most jealous destiny  
And he (is) coeval  
With the five periods of the five ages.  
And also is older,  
Though there be five hundred thousand years.  
And he is as wide  
As the face of the earth,  
And he was not born,  
And he has not been seen.  
He, on sea, he, on land,  
30 He sees not, he is not seen.  
He is not sincere,  
He will not come when it is wished.  
He, on land, he, on sea,  
He is indispensable,  
He is unconfined,  
He is unequalled.  
He from four regions,  
He will not be according to counsel.  
He commences his journey  
40 From above the stone of marble.  
He is loud-voiced, he is mute.  
He is uncourteous.  
He is vehement, he is bold,  
When he glances over the land.  
He is mute, he is loud-voiced.  
He is blustering.  
Greatest, his banner <span id="page_537">p. 537</span>  
On the face of the earth.  
He is good, he is bad,  
50 He is not bright,  
He is not manifest,  
For the sight does not see (him).  
He is bad, he is good.  
He is yonder, he is here,  
He will disorder.  
He will not repair what he does  
And he sinless,  
He is wet, he is dry,  
He comes frequently  
60 From the heat of the sun, and the coldness of the moon.  
The moon is without benefit,  
Because less, her heat.  
One Person has made it,  
All the creatures.  
He owns the beginning  
And the end without falsehood.  
Not skilful, the minstrel  
That praises not the Lord.  
Not true, the songster  
70 That praises not the Father.  
Not usual will a plough be  
Without iron, without seed.  
There was not a light  
Before the creation of heaven;  
There will not be a priest,  
That will not bless the wafer;  
The perverse will not know  
The seven faculties.  
Ten countries were provided,  
80 In the angelic country. <span id="page_538">p. 538</span>  
The tenth were discarded,  
They loved not their Father.  
A loveless shower  
In utter ruin.  
Llucufer the corrupter,  
Like his destitute country  
Seven stars there are,  
Of the seven gifts of the Lord.  
The student of the stars  
90 Knows their substance.  
Marca mercedus  
Ola olimus  
Luna lafurus  
Jubiter venerus  
From the sun freely flowing  
The moon fetches light.  
Remembrance is not in vain,  
No cross if not believed.  
Our Father! Our Father!  
100 Our relative and companion.  
Our Sovereign, we shall not be separated.  
By the host of Llucufer.
