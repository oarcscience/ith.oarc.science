## S.

## POEMS RELATING TO YSCOLAN.

### LXXXVI.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXVI.

I. BLACK thy horse, black thy cope,  
Black thy head, black thyself,  
Yes, black I art thou Yscolan?

II\. I am Yscolan the scholar,  
Slight is my clouded reason,  
There is no drowning the woe of him who offends a sovereign.

III\. For having burnt a church, and destroyed the cattle of a school,  
And caused a book to be submerged,  
My penance is a heavy affliction.

IV\. Creator of the creatures, of supports  
The greatest, pardon me my iniquity!  
He who betrayed Thee, deceived me.

V. A full year was given me  
At Bangor on the pole of a weir;  
Consider thou my suffering from sea-worms.

VI\. If I knew what I now know  
As plain as the wind in the top branches of waving trees,  
What I did I should never have done.
