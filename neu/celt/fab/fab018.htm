<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>I. THY large fountain fills the river,<BR>
Thy coming will make thy value of little worth,<BR>
The death-song of Corroy agitates me.<BR>
If the warrior will allure, rough his temper.<BR>
And his evil was greater than its renown was great,<BR>
To seize the son of Dayry, lord of the southern sea,<BR>
Celebrated was his praise before she was entrusted to him.</P>
<P>II. Thy large fountain fills the stream.<BR>
Thy coming will cause saddling without haste,<BR>
The death-song of Corroi is with me now,<BR>
If (the warrior) will allure.</P>
<P>III. Thy large fountain fills the deep.<BR>
Thy arrows traverse the strand, not frowning or depressed.<BR>
The warrior conquers, great his rank of soldiers,<BR>
And after penetrating enters towns<BR>
And . . . the pure stream was promptly whitened.<BR>
Whilst the victorious one in the morning heaps carnage;<BR>
Tales will be known to me from sky to earth,<BR>
Of the contention of Corroi and Cocholyn,<BR>
Numerous their tumults about their borders, <A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A><BR>
Springs the chief o'er the surrounding mead of the somewhat gentle wood.<BR>
A Caer there was, love-diffusing, not paling, not trembling.<BR>
Happy is he whose. soul is rewarded.</P>
