### XI.

### THE PRAISE\` OF LLUDD THE GREAT

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN LII.

THE best song they will dispraise,  
Eight numbers they will protect,  
Monday, they will come,  
Devastating they will go.  
Tuesday, they will portion  
Anger against the adversary.  
Wednesday, they will reap.  
Pomp in excess.  
Thursday, they will part with  
10 The undesired possessor.  
Friday, a day of abundance.  
In the blood of men they will swim.  
Saturday  
Sunday, certainly,  
Assuredly there will come  
Five ships and five hundred  
That make supplication--  
    *O Brithi, Brithi*!  
    *Co-occupancy or battle*.  
    20 *Brithi, Brithanai*!  
    *Before battle, battle of spears in the field*.  
Son of the wood of Cogni,  
There will be an adventuring of  
Everyone to Adonai.  
On the sward of Pwmpai.  
An intimation they prophesy,  
A long cry against overwhelming, <span id="page_272">p. 272</span>  
Long the public harmony  
Of Cadwaladyr and Cynan.  
30 The world's profit (is) small,  
The heat of the sun is lost.  
The Druid will prophesy  
What has been will be.  
Sky of Geirionydd,  
I would go with thee  
Gloomy like the evening,  
In the recesses of the mountain.  
When should be the full length  
The Brython in chasing.  
40 To the Brython there will be  
Blood of glorious strenuousness,  
After gold and golden trinkets.  
The devastation of Moni and Lleeni,  
And Eryri, a dwelling in it.  
It is a perfect prophecy,  
With dwellings laid waste.  
The Cymry of four languages  
Shall change their speech.  
Until shall come the cow, the speckled cow  
50 That shall cause a blessing  
On a fine day lowing,  
On a fine night being boiled,  
On the land of the boiler,  
In the ships of the consumer.  
Let the song of woe be chaunted.  
Around the encircling border of Prydain.  
They will come, with one purpose,  
To resist a maritime disgrace.  
Be true the happiness  
60 Of the sovereign of the world.  
The worshippers adored together, <span id="page_273">p. 273</span>  
To the dale of grievous water it was gone.  
A portion full of corn  
Invites conflagration.  
Without Eppa, without a cow-stall.  
Without a luxury of the world.  
The world will be desolate, useless.  
The deceitful will be fated.  
Activity through freshness.  
70 Small men are almost deceived  
By the white-bellied trotter.  
A hawk upon baptism  
The swords of warriors will not pierce Cyllellawr.  
They had not what they wished for.  
Violent is the grasp of the townman,  
And to warriors there is a love of blood.  
Cymry, Angles, Gwyddyl, of Prydyn.  
The Cymry, swift in mischief,  
Will launch their ships on the lake.  
80 The North has been poisoned by rovers  
Of a livid hateful hue and form.  
Of the race of Adam the ancient.  
The third will be brought to set out,  
Ravens of the accurate retinue,  
The sluggish animals of Seithin.  
On sea, an anchor on the Christian.  
A cry from the sea, a cry from the mountain,  
A cry from the sea, they vigorously utter.  
Wood, field, dale, and hill.  
90 Every speech without any one attending,  
High minded from every place  
There will be confusion.  
A multitude enraged,  
And distress diffused  
Vengeances through ready belief abiding. <span id="page_274">p.
274</span>  
That the Creator afflicts, the powerful God of exalted state.  
A long time before the day of doom.  
There will come a day  
And a reader will rise,  
100 In the pleasant border of the land of Iwerdon,  
To Prydain then will come exaltation,  
Brython of the nobility of Rome.  
There will be to me a judge unprejudiced, void of guile;  
The astrologers (or diviners) prophesy,  
In the land of the lost ones.  
Druids prophesy  
Beyond the sea, beyond the Brython.  
The summer will not be serene weather,  
The noblemen shall be broken,  
110 It will come to them from treachery  
Beyond the effusion of the father of Ked.  
A thousand in the judgment of exalted Prydain,  
And within its united boundary.  
May I not fall into the embrace of the swamp,  
Into the mob that peoples the depths of Uffern.  
I greatly fear the flinty covering  
With the Guledig of the boundless country.
