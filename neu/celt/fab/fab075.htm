<P>THE Awen foretells the hastening of<BR>
The multitude, possessed of wealth and peace,<BR>
And a bountiful sovereign, and eloquent princes,<BR>
And after tranquillity, commotion in every place.<BR>
The seven sons of Beli arose.<BR>
Caswallawn, and Lludd, and Cestuddyn,<BR>
Diwed, Plo, Coll, Iago from the land of Prydyn.<BR>
A country boiling will be made as far as Balaon.<BR>
Tired out their nails, ready for journeying their reins.<BR>
10 Borderers of a ravaging country.<BR>
The Cymry lost all their bounty.<BR>
In the alliance of the sovereign's servants,<BR>
Llyminawg will appear<BR>
Who will be an ambitious man,<BR>
To subdue Mona,<BR>
And to ruin Gwynedd,<BR>
From its extremity to its centre.<BR>
From its beginning, from its end,<BR>
And to take its pledges.<BR>
20 Persevering his face,<BR>
He will submit to none,<BR>
Whether Cymry or Saxons.<BR>
A person will come from concealment,,<BR>
That will make an universal stain of red,<BR>
And a battle of strifes.<BR>
Another will come,<BR>
Far-extending his armies,<BR>
A triumph to the Brython.</P>
