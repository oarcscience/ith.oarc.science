### LXXXVII.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXVII.

I.

I. THE first word that I will utter  
In the morning when I get up,  
"May the Cross of Christ be as a vesture around me."

II\. What belongs to my Creator I will put on  
To-day, in one house will I attend.  
He is not a God in whom I will not believe.

III\. I will dress myself handsomely,  
And believe in no omen which is not certain;  
He that created me will strengthen me.

IV\. I have a mind to see sights,  
Intending to go to sea;  
May a useful purpose become a treasure!

V. I have a mind for all advice,  
Intending to go to sea;  
May the purpose be useful, Lord!

VI\. Let the raven uplift its wing,  
With the intention of going far away;  
May a useful purpose become better!

VII\. Let the raven uplift its wing,  
With. the intention of going to Rome;  
May a useful purpose become glorious!

VIII\. Saddle thou the bayard with the white bridle,  
To course Hiraethawg with its quaking grass:  
Creator of Heaven! God must be with us!

IX\. Saddle thou the bayard with the short hair,  
Free in the conflict, quick in his pace;  
Where the nose is, there will be snorting.

X. Saddle thou the bayard with the long bound,  
Free in the conflict, pleasing in his pace;  
The sneering of the vicious will not check the brave.

XI\. Heavy the consistence of the earth, thick leaves its cover;  
Bitter the drinking-horn of sweet mead;  
Creator of Heaven! prosper my business!

XII\. From the progeny of the sovereign and victor,  
Gwosprid, and Peter chief of every language,  
Saint Ffraid, bless us on our journey!

XIII\. Thou, Sun, to him intercession and vows are made,  
Lord, Christ the Mysterious, the pillar of beneficence!  
May I make satisfaction for my sin and actions.

II\.

I asked to secular priests,  
To their bishops and their judges,  
"What is the best thing for the soul?"  
The Paternoster, and consecrated wafers, and a holy  
Creed, he who sings them for his soul,  
Until the judgment will be accustomed to the best thing.  
Smooth the way as thou goest, and cultivate peace,  
And to thee there will be no end of mercy.  
Give food to the hungry and clothes to the naked, <span id="page_521">p.

10 And say thy devotions:  
From the presence of devils thou hast escaped.  
The proud and the idle have pain in their flesh,  
The reward of going to excess:  
Beware of sifting what is not pure.  
Excess of sleep, and excess of drunkenness, and too much beverage  
Of mead, and too much submission to the flesh,  
These are six bitter things against the judgment.  
For perjury in respect of land, and the betrayment of a lord,  
And the scandalising of the bounteous,  
20 At the day of judgment let there be repentance.  
By rising to matins and nocturns,  
Awaking, and interceding with the saints,  
Shall every Christian obtain forgiveness.
