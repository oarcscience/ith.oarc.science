### III.

### THE DEATH-SONG OF EROF.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XL.

WERE changed the elements  
Like night into day,  
When came the gloriously-free,  
Erewlf chief of baptism.  
Erewlf said,  
That he valued not death.  
Shield of the Mordei  
Upon him it broke.  
Erewlf the arranger,  
10 Determined, frantic.  
Four columns of equal length;  
Ruddy, gold along them.  
The columns of Erewlf  
Will not dare a threatening,  
A threatening will not dare.  
The heat of the sun did not leave him.  
No one went to heaven  
Until went he,  
Erewlf the wall-piercer.  
20 May the sand be my covering,  
May the Trinity grant me  
Mercy on the day of judgment,  
In unity without want.
