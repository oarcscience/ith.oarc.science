<P>THE fleet of Mona, the seat of misfortune,<BR>
Prevents bloodshed, with the noise of oars around her.<BR>
A greater influx will be into the Conwy on account of distress,<BR>
The men of the eagle of Eryri having fallen.<BR>
Without ardour they were in the time of heat before becoming silent, <A NAME="page_491"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 491</FONT></A><BR>
Cymry without energy against injustice.<BR>
The dragon of prediction is the son of Henri;<BR>
For a year was be desired before the assembling of hosts,<BR>
Wolf of the mighty, mighty his retainers:<BR>
10 The retinue of the world will for a time be a sign from the Invisible.<BR>
The country will be constant to the ruler of Normandi,<BR>
The bane of Prydein, there will be anxious concern because of his birth,<BR>
With a constancy like the revolving of a wheel.<BR>
Chief of bards of every region, as to thy ancient claims<BR>
I will address thee by signs.<BR>
How often dost thou communicate with the youthful hero,<BR>
The heroic youth, amiable in society?<BR>
Supremely high will be the voice of fame on the blue sea,<BR>
When the youths of Brythyon come to their privilege;<BR>
20 And Owein will be the ruler of the kingdom,<BR>
A ruddy man in the ruddy scene, the joy of Gwynedd,<BR>
Of brave ancestors, the progeny of Mervyn, the bulwark of sovereignty.<BR>
A crowned young hero, on the point of effecting deliverance.<BR>
Known to God is my wish.<BR>
That the Allmyn should commence their flight with a bloody fate,<BR>
And with destruction so precipitate, so violent, so terrible!<BR>
Extremely offensive is every naked truth, be it certain<BR>
That distracted men have come contending about towns.<BR>
A heap of ruddy carcases by the peaceless blade has been deserved; and certainly such is the case.<BR>
30 Every record, every juncture, every man, and every triumph,<BR>
Christ has conferred upon me the advantage of knowing. <A NAME="page_492"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 492</FONT></A><BR>
The Lloegrians are unfit in the conflict of blades,<BR>
An enervated rabble to contend in battle.</P>
