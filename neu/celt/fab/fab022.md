## B.

## POEMS REFERRING TO ARTHUR THE GULEDIG.

### VI.

### THE CHAIR OF THE SOVEREIGN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XV.

THE declaration of a clear song,  
Of unbounded Awen,  
About a warrior of two authors,  
Of the race of the steel Ala.  
With his staff and his wisdom,  
And his swift irruptions,  
And his sovereign prince,  
And his scriptural number,  
And his red purple,  
10 And his assault over the wall,  
And his appropriate chair,  
Amongst the retinue of the wall.  
Did not (he) lead from Cawrnur  
Horses pale supporting burdens?  
The sovereign elder.  
The generous feeder.  
The third deep wise one,  
To bless Arthur,  
Arthur the blessed,  
20 In a compact song.  
On the face in battle,  
Upon him, a restless activity.  
Who are the three chief ministers  
That guarded the country? <span id="page_260">p. 260</span>  
Who are the three skilful (ones)  
That kept the token?  
That will come with eagerness  
To meet their lord?  
High (is) the virtue of the course,  
30 High will be the gaiety of the old,  
High (is) the horn of travelling,  
High the kine in the evening.  
High (is) truth when it shines,  
Higher when it speaks.  
High when came from the cauldron  
The three awens of Gogyrwen.  
I have been Mynawg, wearing a collar,  
With a horn in my hand.  
He deserves not the chair  
40 That keeps not my word.  
With me is the splendid chair,  
The inspiration of fluent (and) urgent song.  
What the name of the three Caers,  
Between the flood and the ebb?  
No one knows who is not pressing  
The offspring of their president.  
Four Caers there are,  
In Prydain, stationary,  
Chiefs tumultuous.  
50 As for what may not be, it will not be.  
It will not be, because it may not be.  
Let him be a conductor of fleets.  
Let the billow cover over the shingle,  
That the land becomes ocean,  
So that it leaves not the cliffs,  
Nor hill nor dale,  
Nor the least of shelter,  
Against the wind when it shall rage. <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>  
The chair of the sovereign  
60 He that keeps it is skilful.  
Let them be sought there!  
Let the munificent be sought.  
Warriors lost,  
I think in a wrathful manner.  
From the destruction of chiefs,  
In a butchering manner,  
From the loricated Legion,  
Arose the Guledig,  
Around the old renowned boundary.  
70 The sprouting sprigs are broken,  
Fragile in like manner.  
Fickle and dissolving.  
Around the violent borders.  
Are the flowing languages.  
The briskly-moving stream  
Of roving sea-adventurers,  
Of the children of Saraphin.  
A task deep (and) pure  
To liberate Elphin.
