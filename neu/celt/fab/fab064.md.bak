## POEMS RELATING TO THE BATTLE OF ARDDERYD.

### XLIX.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN I.

I. How sad with me, how sad!  
Have Cedwyv and Cadvan perished?  
Glaring and tumultuous was the slaughter;  
Perforated was the shield from Trywruyd.

TALIESSIN.

II\. It was Maelgwn that I saw combating,  
His household before the tumult of the host is not silent.

MYRDIN.

III\. Before two men in Nevtur will they land,  
Before Errith and Gurrith on a pale white horse.  
The slender bay they will undoubtedly bear away.  
Soon will his retinue be seen with Elgan.  
Alas for his death! a great journey they came.

TALIESSIN.

IV\. Rys, the one-toothed, a span was his shield;  
Even to thee has complete prosperity come.  
Cyndur has been slain; beyond measure they deplore;  
Men that were generous while they lived have been slain;  
Three men of note, whose. esteem was great with Elgan.

MYRDIN.

V. Through and through, in excess and excess they came,  
From yonder and yonder there came to me Bran and Melgan;  
Slay, in their last conflict, Diwel  
The son of Erbin, and his men, they did.

TALIESSIN.

VI\. The host of Maelgwn, it was fortunate that they came--  
Slaughtering men of battle, penetrating the gory plain,  
Even the action of Ardderyd, when there will be a crisis,  
Continually for the hero they will prepare.

MYRDIN.

VII\. A host of flying darts, reeking will be the gory plain;  
A host of. warriors, vigorous and active will they be;  
A host, when wounds will be given, a host, when flight will take
place,  
A host, when they will return to the combat.

TALIESSIN.

VIII\. The seven sons of Eliffer, seven heroes when put to proof,  
They will not avoid seven spears in their seven divisions.

MYRDIN.

IX\. Seven blazing fires, seven opposing armies,  
The seventh Cynvelyn in every foremost place.

TALIESSIN.

X. Seven thrusting spears, seven rivers-ful  
Of the blood of chieftains will they fill.

MYRDIN.

XI\. Seven score generous ones have gone to the shades;  
In the wood of Celyddon they came to their end.

Since I, Myrdin, am next after Taliessin,  
Let my prediction become common.
