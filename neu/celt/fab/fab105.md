### XC.

### HOSTILE CONFEDERACY.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN VII.

A BARD there is here, who has not sung, what he shall have to sing;  
Lot him sing; when he shall have finished,  
An astrologer then he may be.  
The generous ones refuse me.  
There will not be one that will give.  
Through the language of Taliessin,  
It was a bright day  
When Kian did  
Praise the multitude.  
10 There will be a slaughter, let there be the speech of Avagddu.  
But if he ingeniously brings  
The requisites forward,  
Gwiawn will declare,  
O the deep that will come  
He would make the dead alive,  
And destitute of wealth he is.  
They will not make their cauldrons, <span id="page_526">p. 526</span>  
That will boil without fire.  
They will make their metals  
20 In age of ages.  
Thy pace that bears thee  
From the deep of panegyric,  
Is it not the hostile confederacy?  
What its custom?  
So much of national song  
Your tongue has given.  
Why will ye not recite an oration  
Of blessing over the liquor of brightness?  
The theme of every one's rhapsody.  
30 I shall be there according to custom,  
He was a profound judge.  
He came after his periodical custom,  
The third of the equal judges.  
Three score years  
I have supported an earthly scene,  
In the water of law and the multitude.  
In the element of lands.  
A hundred servants surrounded,  
A hundred kings made vows.  
40 A hundred they are that went,  
A hundred they are that came.  
A hundred minstrels sang,  
And he foretold of them.  
Lladdon, the daughter of the stream,  
Little was her desire  
For gold and silver,  
Who is the living one that left her?  
Blood on the breast;  
He will probably be spoken of,  
50 He will be greatly praised.  
I am Taliessin,  
I will delineate the true lineage  
Continuing until the end,  
In the pattern of Elphin,  
Is not the tribute  
Of counted gold a debt?  
When is hated and not loved,  
Perjury and treason,  
I desire not advantage,  
60 Through the fluctuation of our song.  
The brother that freely greets,  
From me no one shall know.  
The wise man of the primary science,  
The astrologer reasoned,  
About wrath, about the resolvent,  
About the man describing windings.  
About men well versed in praise.  
Let us proceed, God it is,  
Through the language of Talhaearn,  
70 Baptism was the day of judgment,  
That judged the characteristics  
Of the force of poetry.  
He and his virtue gave  
Inspiration without mediocrity,  
Seven score Ogyrven  
Are in the Awen.  
Eight score, of every score it will be one.  
In the deep it will cease from ire;  
In the deep it will be excessively angry;  
80 In the deep, below the earth;  
In the sky, above the earth.  
There is one that knows  
What sadness is,  
Better than joy.  
I know the law of the graces of <span id="page_528">p. 528</span>  
The Awen, when it flows,  
Concerning skilful payments,  
Concerning happy days,  
Concerning a tranquil life,  
90 Concerning the protection of ages.  
Concerning what beseems kings; how long their consolation.  
Concerning similar things, that are on the face of the earth.  
Magnificent astronomy, when communicated,  
Sees all that is high.  
When the mind is active,  
When the sea is pleasant,  
When the race is valiant,  
When the high one is supplicated,  
Or the sun when it is given,  
100 When it covers the land.  
Covering land of what extent?  
When was drawn the bird of wrath,  
The bird of wrath when it was drawn.  
When the earth is green.  
Who chaunted songs?  
Songs who chaunted?  
If true, who has considered them?  
It has been considered in books,  
110 How many winds, how many streams,  
How many streams, how many winds.  
How many rivers in their courses,  
How many rivers there are.  
The earth, what its breadth;  
Or what its thickness.  
I know the noise of the blades,  
Crimson on all sides, about the floor.  
I know the regulator, <span id="page_529">p. 529</span>  
Between heaven and earth;  
120 When an opposite hill is echoing,  
When devastation urges onward,  
When the silvery (vault) is shining,  
When the dell shall be gloomy.  
The breath when it is black,  
When is best that has been.  
A cow, when it is horned,  
A wife, when she is lovely,  
Milk, when it is white,  
When the holly is green,  
130 When is bearded the kid  
In the multitude of fields,  
When it is bearded,  
When the cow-parsnip is created,  
When is revolving the wheel,  
When the mallet is flat,  
When is spotted the little roebuck,  
When the salt is brine,  
Ale, when it is of an active quality.  
When is of purplish hue the alder.  
140 When is green the linnet,  
When are red the hips,  
Or a woman when restless,  
When the night comes on.  
What reserve there is in the hour of flowing,  
No one knows whence the bosom of the sun is made ruddy.  
A stain on a new garment,  
It is difficult to remove it.  
The string of a harp, why it complains,  
The cuckoo, why it complains, why it sings.  
150 Why keepeth the agreeable,  
Why have led the camp <span id="page_530">p. 530</span>  
Gereint and Arman.  
What brings out the sparkle  
From bard working of the stones.  
When is sweet-smelling the goat's-beard plant;  
When the crows are of a waxen line.  
Talhayarn is  
The greatest astronomer.  
What is the imagination of trees.  
160 From the muse the agreement of a day.  
I know good and evil.  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
The bowl of whom has flowed,  
What dawn has finished,  
Who preached,  
Eli and Eneas:  
I know the cuckoos of summer,  
(Where) they will be in the winter.  
170 The Awen I sing,  
From the deep I bring it,  
A river while it flows,  
I know its extent;  
I know when it disappears;  
I know when it fills;  
I know when it overflows;  
I know when it shrinks;  
I know what base  
There is beneath the sea.  
180 I know their equivalent,  
Every one in its retinue;  
How many were heard in a day,  
How many days in a year.  
How many shafts in a battle,  
How many drops in a shower. <span id="page_531">p. 531</span>  
Mildly he divided them.  
A greater mockery, the partial stirring up of disgrace,  
The vicious muse of Gwydyon.  
I know the one,  
190 That filled the river,  
On the people of Pharaoh.  
Who brought the windings  
Of present reasons.  
What was the active patience,  
When heaven was upreared.  
What was a sail-staff  
From earth to sky.  
How many fingers about the cauldron,  
About one, about the hand,  
200 What name the two words  
Will not deliver in one cauldron.  
When the sea is turning round,  
When black are the fish.  
Marine food shall be their flesh,  
Until it is transformed,  
When fish shall contain it.  
When the foot of the white swan is black,  
Four-sided the sharp spear.  
The tribe of heaven will not put down.  
210 Which are the four elements.  
Their end is not known.  
What pigs, or what wandering of stags.  
I salute thee, Bard of the border.  
May he increase thee, (whose) bones (are of) mist  
(Where) two cataracts of wind fall.  
My mind has been expressed  
In Hebrew, in Hebraic.  
In Hebraic, in Hebrew,  
Laudatu Laudate Jesu. <span id="page_532">p. 532</span>  
220 A second time was I formed.  
I have been a blue salmon.  
I have been a dog; I have been a stag;  
I have been a roebuck on the mountain.  
I have been a stock, I have been a spade;  
I have been an axe in the hand;  
I have been a pin in a forceps,  
A year and a half;  
I have been a speckled white cock  
Upon hens in Eiddyn.  
230 I have been a stallion over a stud.  
I have been a violent bull,  
I have been a buck of yellow hue,  
As it is feeding.  
I have been a grain discovered,  
Which grew on a hill.  
He that reaped me placed me,  
Into a smoke-hole driving me.  
Exerting of the hand,  
In afflicting me,  
240 A hen received me,  
With ruddy claws, (and) parting comb.  
I rested nine nights.  
In her womb a child,  
I have been matured,  
I have been an offering before the Guledig,  
I have been dead, I have been alive.  
A branch there was to me of ivy,  
I have been a convoy,  
Before God I have been poor.  
250 Again advised me the cherisher  
With ruddy claws; of what she gave me  
Scarcely can be recounted;  
Greatly will it be praised. <span id="page_533">p. 533</span>  
I am Taliessin,  
I will delineate the true lineage,  
That will continue to the end,  
In the pattern of Elphin.
