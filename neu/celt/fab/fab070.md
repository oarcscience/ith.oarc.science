### SONG TO ALE.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XX.

I.

THE qualities shall be extolled  
Of the man that. chained the. wind.  
When his powers come,  
Extremely noisy the elements;  
For ever will thy impulse be,  
Thou dost pervade  
The tide of darkness and day.  
The day, there will be a shelter to me,  
The night, it will be rested. <span id="page_428">p. 428</span>  
10 Softness is praised.  
From a great Guledig.  
The great God caused  
The sun of summer, and its excessive heat;  
And he caused  
The abundance of the wood and field.  
He is the powerful cause of the stream,  
Flowing abundantly.  
He is the powerful cause of every kindness;  
God redeemed me  
20 And before they come,  
The people of the world to the one hill,  
They will not be able to do the least,  
Without the power of the King.  
He shall steep it in the Llyn,  
Until it shall sprout.  
He shall steep it another time  
Until it is sodden.  
Not for a long time will be finished  
30 What the elements produce.  
Let his vessels be washed,  
Let his wort be clear.  
And when there shall be an exciter of song,  
Let it be brought from the cell,  
Let it be brought before kings.  
In splendid festivals.  
Will not oppose every two  
The honey that made it.  
God's departure in me,  
40 As long as the world is in being,  
The mildest is the Trinity.  
The provocative of the drunkard is drunkenness.  
The fishes might show  
The capacity of the lodgments <span id="page_429">p. 429</span>  
Of the gravel of the salt sea,  
Before it overwhelms the strand.  
The gravel of the salt sea  
Below the sand  
Will conceal me from the privileged one.  
Myself he will deliver.  
50 No one will be satisfied,  
Without the power of the Trinity.

II\.

Qualities they will honour  
In the boundary of Garant.  
The mighty ones, without desire, from the reeking  
Marsh will remove,  
When the string of harmony resounds,  
Or the shades of night approach,  
The hidden retreat from day.  
Do the skilful in song know  
Where the powerful artist is concealed?  
10 That will give me a robe  
From the gate when he ascends.  
When the chief leads, in winter,  
What melody is commenced together.  
In choosing loud fame,  
With haste the fortunate will run,  
He will awake the sleeper.  
He will merit Carawg  
Of the many-citied Cymry,  
The father of Caradawg;  
20 The sound of the Meneivians,  
The sound of Mynawg of Mona.  
The great terrible perjured  
Gwentians, long-haired.  
On account of Caer Wyrangon. <span id="page_430">p. 430</span>  
Who will pay the precious reward?  
Is it Maelgwn from Mona?  
Or shall it come from Aeron?  
Or Coel or Canawon?  
Or Gwrweddw or his sons?  
30 His enemies shall not exult  
From the hostages of Ynyr.  
To him will resort the minstrels  
The star of magnificent stars,  
Have I not disarmed the mystery?  
In Mordei Uffin,  
In the seas of Gododin,  
He is a sharer of varied words,  
The raven of the morning divining.  
I am an aged exile,  
40 I am of joyful talents,  
And the stroke of malice.  
Mine, the praising of Urien,  
Of splendid purity of life.  
Very keen his conduct of hosts,  
The ruddy-reaping of the steep.  
Ruddyn formed them,  
At the battle in Harddnenwys,  
It was Ynyr that broke them to pieces.  
A hundred festivals holding  
50 A hundred friends be defended.  
I saw mighty men,  
Who hastened to the shout of war;  
I saw blood on the ground  
From the assault of swords.  
They tinged with blue the wings of the dawn;  
They threw off the spears.  
Three hundred festivals complete of the renowned  
Ynyr, on the earth indeed there will be redness.
