### CVI.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXVIII.

I WONDER that there is not proclaimed  
An acknowledgment of heaven to the earth.  
Of the coming of a giant Ruler,  
Alexander the Great.  
Alexander, possessor of multitudes.  
Passionate, iron-gifted, <span id="page_568 ">p. 568</span>  
Eminent for sword-strokes.  
He went under the sea,  
Under the sea he went,  
10 To seek for science.  
Whoever seeks science,  
Let him be clamorous in mind.  
He went above the wind,  
Between two griffins on a journey,  
To see a sight.  
A sight he saw,  
The present was not sufficient.  
He saw a wonder.  
A superiority of lineage with fishes.  
20 What he desired in his mind,  
He had from the world.  
And also at his end  
With God, mercy.
