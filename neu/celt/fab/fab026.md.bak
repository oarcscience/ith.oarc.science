## POEMS REFERRING TO GWYDYON AP DON AND HIS GWYDDYL AND THE BRITHWYR.

### X.

### DARONWY.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN X.

GOD preserve the heavens  
From a flood wide spreading.  
The first surging billow  
Has rolled over the sea-beach.  
What tree is greater  
Than he, Daronwy?  
I know not for a refuge  
Around the proud circle of heaven,  
That there is a mystery which is greater.  
10 The light of the men of Goronwy.  
Perhaps it may be known,  
The magic wand of Mathonwy,  
In the wood when it grows.  
Fruits more profitable,  
On the bank of Gwyllyonwy.  
Cynan shall obtain it,  
At the time when he governs.  
There will come yet  
Over the ebb and over the strand,  
20 Four chief sovereignties,  
And the fifth not worse.  
Men vehement, extensive. <span id="page_270">p. 270</span>  
Over Prydain (their) purpose.  
Women shall be eloquent,  
Strangers shall be captive,  
A torrent of longing  
For mead and horsemanship.  
There will come two ladies,  
A widow, and a slender single one;  
30 Iron their wings,  
On warriors brooding.  
Chieftains will come,  
From about the land of Rome.  
Their song will harmonise,  
Their praise will spread abroad.  
The nature of the oak and thorns  
In song will harmonise.  
A dog to draw,  
A horse to move.  
40 An ox to gore; a sow to turn up.  
The fifth fair young beast Jesus made  
From the apparel of Adam to proceed.  
The foliage of trees, fair to behold them,  
Whilst they were, and whilst it was.  
When the Cymry shall commit transgressions,  
A foreigner will be found, who will love what was?  
I have leaped a leap from a clear leap,  
Good has been dispersed abroad, if a person finds no evil.  
The funeral-pile of Run, it is an expiation,  
50 Between Caer Rian and Caer Rywg,  
Between Dineiddyn and Dineiddwg  
A clear glance and a watchful sight.  
From the agitation of fire smoke will be raised,  
And God our Creator will defend us.
