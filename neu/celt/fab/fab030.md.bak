### XIV.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN I.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST XXIII.

PRIMITIVE and ingenious address, when thoroughly elucidated.  
Which was first, is it darkness, is it light?  
Or Adam, when he existed, on what day was he created?  
Or under the earth's surface, what the foundation?  
He who is a legionary will receive no instruction.  
Est qui peccator in many things,  
Will lose the heavenly country, the community of priests.  
In the morning no one comes  
If they sing of three spheres.  
10 Angles and Gallwydel,  
Let them make their way.  
Whence come night and day?  
Whence will the eagle become gray?  
Whence is it that night is dark?  
Whence is it that the linnet is green?  
The ebullition of the sea, <span id="page_285">p. 285</span>  
How is it not seen?  
There are three fountains  
In the mountain of roses,  
20 There is a Caer of defence  
Under the ocean's wave.  
Illusive greeter,  
What is the porter's name?  
Who was confessor  
To the gracious Son of Mary?  
What was the most beneficial measure  
Which Adam accomplished?  
Who will measure Uffern?  
How thick its veil?  
30 How wide its mouth?  
What the size of its stones?  
Or the tops of its whirling trees?  
Who bends them so crooked?  
Or what fumes may be  
About their stems?  
Is it Lleu and Gwydyon  
That perform their arts?  
Or do they know books  
When they do?  
40 Whence come night and flood?  
How they disappear?  
Whither flies night from day;  
And how is it not seen?  
Pater noster ambulo  
Gentis tonans in adjuvando  
Sibilem signum  
Rogantes fortium.  
Excellent in every way around the glens  
The two skilful ones make inquiries  
50 About Caer Cerindan Cerindydd <span id="page_286">p. 286</span>  
For the draught-horses of pector David.  
They have enjoyment--they move about--  
May they find me greatly expanding.  
The Cymry will be lamenting  
While their souls will be tried  
Before a horde of ravagers.  
The Cymry, chief wicked ones,  
On account of the loss of holy wafers.  
There will long be crying and wailing,  
60 And gore will be conspicuous.  
There came by sea  
The wood-steeds of the strand.  
The Angles in council  
Shall see signs of  
Exultation over Saxons.  
The praises of the rulers  
Will be celebrated in Sion.  
Let the chief builders be  
Against the fierce Ffichti,  
70 The Morini Brython.  
Their fate has been predicted;  
And the reaping of heroes  
About the river Severn.  
The stealing is disguised of Ken and Masswy  
Ffis amala, ffur, ffir, sel,  
Thou wilt discern the Trinity beyond my age  
I implore the Creator, hai  
Huai, that the Gentile may vanish  
From the Gospel. Equally worthy  
80 With the retinue of the wall  
Cornu ameni dur.  
I have been with skilful men,  
With Matheu and Govannon,  
With Eunydd and Elestron, <span id="page_287">p. 287</span>  
In company with Achwyson,  
For a year in Caer Gofannon.  
I am old. I am young. I am Gwion,  
I am universal, I am possessed of penetrating wit.  
Thou wilt remember thy old Brython  
90 (And) the Gwyddyl, kiln distillers,  
Intoxicating the drunkards.  
I am a bard; I will not disclose secrets to slaves;  
I am a guide: I am expert in contests.  
If he would sow, he would plough; he would plough, he would not reap.  
If a brother among brothers,  
Didactic Bards with swelling breasts will arise  
Who will meet around mead-vessels,  
And sing wrong poetry  
And seek rewards that will not be,  
100 Without law, without regulation, without gifts.  
And afterwards will become angry.  
There will be commotions and turbulent times,  
Seek no peace--it will not accrue to thee.  
The Ruler of Heaven knows thy prayer.  
From his ardent wrath thy praise has propitiated hint  
The Sovereign King of Glory addresses me with wisdom:--  
Hast thou seen the dominus fortis?  
Knowest thou the profound prediction domini?  
To the advantage of Uffern  
110 Hic nemo in por progenie  
He has liberated its tumultuous multitude.  
Dominus virtutum  
Has gathered together those that were in slavery,  
And before I existed He had perceived me.  
May I be ardently devoted to God!  
And before I desire the end of existence, <span id="page_288">p.
288</span>  
And before the broken foam shall come upon my lips,  
And before I become connected with wooden boards,  
May there be festivals to my soul!  
120 Book-learning scarcely tells me  
Of severe afflictions after death-bed  
And such as have heard my bardic books  
They shall obtain the region of heaven, the best of all abodes.
