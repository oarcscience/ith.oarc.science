<P>HE was dexterous that fairly ruled over a country,<BR>
He was most generous, with most beautiful queens,<BR>
He was a violent poison of woe to his fellow-countrymen.<BR>
He broke upon Darius three times in battle.<BR>
And he will not be a dwarf shrub in the country of the plumed Darius.<BR>
Strenuous, far he conquered, the wood-pushing overtook<BR>
Alexander; in the golden fetters of woe he is imprisoned.<BR>
He was not long imprisoned; death came.<BR>
And where he had moving of armies,<BR>
10 No one before him was exalted,<BR>
To go to the grave, rich and prosperous, from the pleasure,<BR>
The generous Alexander took him there.<BR>
The land of Syr and Siryol, and the land of Syria,<BR>
And the land of Dinifdra, and land of Dinitra;<BR>
The land of Persia and Mersia, and the land of Canna;<BR>
And the isles of Pleth and Pletheppa;<BR>
And the state of Babilon and Agascia<BR>
Great, and the land of Galldarus, little its good.<BR>
Until the earth produced, sod was there.<BR>
20 And they do their wills by hunting them.<BR>
They render hostages to Europa. <A NAME="page_567"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 567</FONT></A><BR>
And plunder the countries of the peoples of the earth.<BR>
Furiously they pierce women, they impel here,<BR>
Before the burned ones there was a devastation of modesty,<BR>
Of battles when the sorrow was mentioned.<BR>
They satisfy the ravens, they make a head of confused running,<BR>
The soldiers of the possessor of multitudes, when they are mentioned.<BR>
Nor a country to thy young men, when it is destroyed,<BR>
There will not be for thy riddance, a riddance of burthen.<BR>
30 From the care of the fetter and its hardship.<BR>
A hundred thousand of the army died from thirst:<BR>
False their plans with their thousands.<BR>
Was poisoned his youth before he came home.<BR>
Before this, it would have been better to have been satisfied.<BR>
To my lord land-prospering, a country glorious,<BR>
One country may the Lord, the best region connect.<BR>
May I reform, may I be satisfied. Be with thee the fulness,<BR>
And as many as hear me, be mine their unity.<BR>
May they satisfy the will of God before the clothing of the sod.</P>
