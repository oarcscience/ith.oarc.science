<P>I. THE first word that I will utter<BR>
In the morning when I get up,<BR>
"May the Cross of Christ be as a vesture around me."</P>
<P>II. What belongs to my Creator I will put on<BR>
To-day, in one house will I attend.<BR>
He is not a God in whom I will not believe.</P>
<P>III. I will dress myself handsomely,<BR>
And believe in no omen which is not certain;<BR>
He that created me will strengthen me.</P>
<P>IV. I have a mind to see sights,<BR>
Intending to go to sea;<BR>
May a useful purpose become a treasure!</P>
<P>V. I have a mind for all advice,<BR>
Intending to go to sea;<BR>
May the purpose be useful, Lord!</P>
<P>VI. Let the raven uplift its wing,<BR>
With the intention of going far away;<BR>
May a useful purpose become better!</P>
<P>VII. Let the raven uplift its wing,<BR>
With. the intention of going to Rome;<BR>
May a useful purpose become glorious!</P>

<P>VIII. Saddle thou the bayard with the white bridle,<BR>
To course Hiraethawg with its quaking grass:<BR>
Creator of Heaven! God must be with us!</P>
<P>IX. Saddle thou the bayard with the short hair,<BR>
Free in the conflict, quick in his pace;<BR>
Where the nose is, there will be snorting.</P>
<P>X. Saddle thou the bayard with the long bound,<BR>
Free in the conflict, pleasing in his pace;<BR>
The sneering of the vicious will not check the brave.</P>
<P>XI. Heavy the consistence of the earth, thick leaves its cover;<BR>
Bitter the drinking-horn of sweet mead;<BR>
Creator of Heaven! prosper my business!</P>
<P>XII. From the progeny of the sovereign and victor,<BR>
Gwosprid, and Peter chief of every language,<BR>
Saint Ffraid, bless us on our journey!</P>
<P>XIII. Thou, Sun, to him intercession and vows are made,<BR>
Lord, Christ the Mysterious, the pillar of beneficence!<BR>
May I make satisfaction for my sin and actions.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II.</P>
<P>I asked to secular priests,<BR>
To their bishops and their judges,<BR>
"What is the best thing for the soul?"<BR>
The Paternoster, and consecrated wafers, and a holy<BR>
Creed, he who sings them for his soul,<BR>
Until the judgment will be accustomed to the best thing.<BR>
Smooth the way as thou goest, and cultivate peace,<BR>
And to thee there will be no end of mercy.<BR>
Give food to the hungry and clothes to the naked, <A NAME="page_521"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 521</FONT></A><BR>
10 And say thy devotions:<BR>
From the presence of devils thou hast escaped.<BR>
The proud and the idle have pain in their flesh,<BR>
The reward of going to excess:<BR>
Beware of sifting what is not pure.<BR>
Excess of sleep, and excess of drunkenness, and too much beverage<BR>
Of mead, and too much submission to the flesh,<BR>
These are six bitter things against the judgment.<BR>
For perjury in respect of land, and the betrayment of a lord,<BR>
And the scandalising of the bounteous,<BR>
20 At the day of judgment let there be repentance.<BR>
By rising to matins and nocturns,<BR>
Awaking, and interceding with the saints,<BR>
Shall every Christian obtain forgiveness.</P>
