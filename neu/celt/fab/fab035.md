### XIX.

### THE CHAIR OF CERIDWEN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XVI.

SOVEREIGN of the power of the air, thou also  
The satisfaction of my transgressions.  
At midnight and at matins  
There shone my lights.  
Courteous the life of Minawg ap Llen,  
Whom I saw here a short while ago.  
The end, in the slope of Lleu.  
Ardent was his push in combats;  
Avagddu my son also.  
10 Happy the Lord made him,  
In the competition of songs,  
His wisdom was better than mine,  
The most skilful man ever heard of.  
Gwydyon ap Don, of toiling spirits,  
Enchanted a woman from blossoms,  
And brought pigs from the south.  
Since he had no sheltering cots,  
Rapid curves, and plaited chains.  
He made the forms of horses  
20 From the springing  
Plants, and illustrious saddles.  
When are judged the chairs, <span id="page_297">p. 297</span>  
Excelling them (will be) mine,  
My chair, my cauldron, and my laws,  
And my pervading eloquence, meet for the chair.  
I am called skilful in the court of Don.  
I, and Euronwy, and Euron.  
I saw a fierce conflict in Nant Frangeon  
On a Sunday, at the time of dawn,  
30 Between the bird of wrath and Gwydyon.  
Thursday, certainly, they went to Mona  
To obtain whirlings and sorcerers.  
Arianrod, of laudable aspect, dawn of serenity,  
The greatest disgrace evidently on the side of the Brython,  
Hastily sends about his court the stream of a rainbow,  
A stream that scares away violence from the earth.  
The poison of its former state, about the world, it will leave.  
They speak not falsely, the books of Beda.  
The chair of the Preserver is here.  
40 And till doom, shall continue in Europa.  
May the Trinity grant us  
Mercy in the day of judgment.  
A fair alms from good men.
