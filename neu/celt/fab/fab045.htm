<P>I. SWEETLY sings the bird on the fragrant tree<BR>
Over the head of Gwen; before his covering over with sod,<BR>
He used to fracture the armour of (Llywarch) Hen.</P>
<P>II. The three best men in their country,<BR>
To defend their homesteads,--<BR>
Eithir, and Erthir, and Argad.</P>
<P>III. The three sons of Llywarch, three intractable ones in battle.<BR>
Three fierce contenders,--<BR>
Llew, and Araw, and Urien.</P>

<P>IV. Better may it fare for my concerns,<BR>
That he be left on the banks of the river,<BR>
With a host of warlike men.</P>
<P>V. The bull of conflict, conductor of the war,<BR>
The support of battle, and the lamp of benevolence,<BR>
Father of heaven, increase Thou his energy!</P>
<P>VI. The best three men under heaven<BR>
To defend their homes,--<BR>
Pyll, and Selyv, and Sandev.</P>
<P>VII. The morning with the dawn of day,<BR>
When Mwg Mawr Drefydd was assaulted,<BR>
The steeds of Mechydd were not trained up.</P>
<P>VIII. They met around Cavall;<BR>
A corpse is there in blood through injustice,<BR>
From the rencounter of Rhun and the other hero.</P>
<P>IX. A shout will be uttered on the top of Mount Llug<BR>
Over the grave of Cynllug;<BR>
The reproach is mine; it was I that caused it.</P>
<P>X. Let the snow descend and cover the vale,<BR>
Warriors will hasten to battle;<BR>
I do not go; infirmity leaves me not.</P>
<P>XI. Thou art not a scholar, thou art not a recluse<BR>
Thou wilt not be called a monarch in the day of necessity;<BR>
Alas! Cynddilig, that thou wert not a woman.</P>
<P>XII. Far away is Aber Llyw,<BR>
Further are the two Cyvedlyws;<BR>
Talan, this day thou hast paid me with tears.</P>
