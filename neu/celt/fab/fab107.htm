<P>GUESS who it is.<BR>
Created before the deluge.<BR>
A creature strong,<BR>
Without flesh, without bone,<BR>
Without veins, without blood,<BR>
Without head, and without feet.<BR>
It will not be older, it will not be younger,<BR>
Than it was in the beginning.<BR>
There will not come from his design<BR>
10 Fear or death.<BR>
He has no wants<BR>
From creatures.<BR>
Great God! the sea whitens <A NAME="page_536"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 536</FONT></A><BR>
When it comes from the beginning.<BR>
Great his beauties,<BR>
The one that made him.<BR>
He, in the field, he, in the wood,<BR>
Without hand and without foot.<BR>
Without old age, without age.<BR>
20 Without the most jealous destiny<BR>
And he (is) coeval<BR>
With the five periods of the five ages.<BR>
And also is older,<BR>
Though there be five hundred thousand years.<BR>
And he is as wide<BR>
As the face of the earth,<BR>
And he was not born,<BR>
And he has not been seen.<BR>
He, on sea, he, on land,<BR>
30 He sees not, he is not seen.<BR>
He is not sincere,<BR>
He will not come when it is wished.<BR>
He, on land, he, on sea,<BR>
He is indispensable,<BR>
He is unconfined,<BR>
He is unequalled.<BR>
He from four regions,<BR>
He will not be according to counsel.<BR>
He commences his journey<BR>
40 From above the stone of marble.<BR>
He is loud-voiced, he is mute.<BR>
He is uncourteous.<BR>
He is vehement, he is bold,<BR>
When he glances over the land.<BR>
He is mute, he is loud-voiced.<BR>
He is blustering.<BR>
Greatest, his banner <A NAME="page_537"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 537</FONT></A><BR>
On the face of the earth.<BR>
He is good, he is bad,<BR>
50 He is not bright,<BR>
He is not manifest,<BR>
For the sight does not see (him).<BR>
He is bad, he is good.<BR>
He is yonder, he is here,<BR>
He will disorder.<BR>
He will not repair what he does<BR>
And he sinless,<BR>
He is wet, he is dry,<BR>
He comes frequently<BR>
60 From the heat of the sun, and the coldness of the moon.<BR>
The moon is without benefit,<BR>
Because less, her heat.<BR>
One Person has made it,<BR>
All the creatures.<BR>
He owns the beginning<BR>
And the end without falsehood.<BR>
Not skilful, the minstrel<BR>
That praises not the Lord.<BR>
Not true, the songster<BR>
70 That praises not the Father.<BR>
Not usual will a plough be<BR>
Without iron, without seed.<BR>
There was not a light<BR>
Before the creation of heaven;<BR>
There will not be a priest,<BR>
That will not bless the wafer;<BR>
The perverse will not know<BR>
The seven faculties.<BR>
Ten countries were provided,<BR>
80 In the angelic country. <A NAME="page_538"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 538</FONT></A><BR>
The tenth were discarded,<BR>
They loved not their Father.<BR>
A loveless shower<BR>
In utter ruin.<BR>
Llucufer the corrupter,<BR>
Like his destitute country<BR>
Seven stars there are,<BR>
Of the seven gifts of the Lord.<BR>
The student of the stars<BR>
90 Knows their substance.<BR>
Marca mercedus<BR>
Ola olimus<BR>
Luna lafurus<BR>
Jubiter venerus<BR>
From the sun freely flowing<BR>
The moon fetches light.<BR>
Remembrance is not in vain,<BR>
No cross if not believed.<BR>
Our Father! Our Father!<BR>
100 Our relative and companion.<BR>
Our Sovereign, we shall not be separated.<BR>
By the host of Llucufer.</P>
