### XCVII.

### THE ELEGY OF THE THOUSAND SONS.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN II.

I. I WILL offer a prayer to the Trinity,  
May the Eternal grant me to praise thee!  
In the present course, dangerous  
Our work; destruction is a slight impulse of wrath.  
They reckon of the saints a tribe,  
King of heaven, may I be eloquent about thee!  
Before the separation of my soul from my flesh.  
Thou particularly knowest in what is my sin.

II\. Thy entreaty before the paternal governance  
May there be to me from the Trinity mercy!  
I adore, I earnestly long for the elements of blood,  
Nine degrees of the mystic troops of heaven,  
And the tenth, saints a preparation of sevens.  
Heroic numberer of languages,  
A conspicuous sea-shoal of goodly increase.  
A number that God will watch with extreme love.  
In heaven, in earth, at the end,  
In straits, in expanse, in form,  
In body, in soul, in habit,  
Prudence (is) far from the presence of kings.  
j adore thee, Ruler of the land of peace.  
Let my soul be in a condition of life;  
For ever in (his) court;  
A servant of heaven (to be), he will not refuse me.

III\. Apostles and martyrs,  
Youths, supplicants of glory, <span id="page_546">p. 546</span>  
And Solomon (that) served God:  
Of pure speech, of pure walk, thy quality  
And a verdant gift will come to me.  
As long as I keep my faculties.  
Numbers there were clean and holy,  
Steps, golden columns of the church.  
And many writers have declared,  
Skilled in the fully-holy books,  
For the multitude discarded anxiety.  
May my soul be defended from it!

IV\. A number there were in the inconcurrence  
Of Uffern, a cold refuge;  
During the five ages of the world,  
Until when Christ loosened the bondage.  
From the deep shore of the abyss of evil  
Many God brought through protection,  
Two thousand sons of the children of Ilia.  
A bimatu et infra  
Slew the amistra.  
Edris ertri kila  
The tears of Rachel, it was seen that a plague  
Had come to Jerusalem.

V. The number of the saints of Amorica,  
And a number in the form of Toronia,  
That had broken the advanced Caer of Roma.  
And Poli and Alexandria  
And Garanwys and Indra  
Tres partes divicia  
Asicia, Affrica, Europa.

VI\. The number of the saints in Capharnaum, Marituen, and Naim, <span
id="page_547">p. 547</span>  
And Zabulon and Cisuen and Ninifen and Neptalim  
In Dubriactus and Zorim  
In it prophesied Christ, the son of Mary, daughter of Joachim;  
From the chief temple of the chief infidel nation.

VII\. The number of the saints of Erechalde,  
The fame far of the castle of Maria.  
That broke not again Syloe  
Ecclesie retunde  
Phalatie cesarie  
Amanion amabute,  
And the valleys of Bersabe.  
And before the Christian religion the men of Cartasine,  
And the severely just ones of Retunde,  
The languages, Greek and Hebrew,  
And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.

VIII\. The number of saints in scores,  
Valiant men, golden their party.  
Before kings a career of praise,  
Warriors, no one was before them in demanding.  
In straits, in expanse, in every need,  
May they be a city to our body and our soul!

IX\. The number of the saints of Sicomorialis,  
And isle of Deffrobani.  
And the holy multitude that blessed  
Water, wine, hostile men destroyed.  
And entreating his exalted weight,  
Under the stars, saints he planted.

X. The number of the saints that the upper region holds,  
Effectus re inferior  
A superare superior <span id="page_548">p. 548</span>  
And armonim and thyfor  
And the valley of Enor and Seger,  
And Carthage the greater and the less,  
And the green isle, the boundary of the sea.

XI\. The number of the saints of the Isle of Prydein,  
And Iwerdon, a gentle portion.  
Multitudes, of beautiful works,  
Believed, served with us.

XII\. The number of saints, a synod without desire,  
From God the divine prophesy.  
In every tongue they compose,  
About the earth they were,  
And so many wisely prophesied  
Christ, and before he was, they were.

XIII\. The number of the saints of the East,  
And the concord of the nation of Judah.  
Languages of Greek and Hebrew,  
And Latin, men of gleaming pervasion.

XIV\. Seven scores, seven scores, seven hundreds of saints,  
And seven thousands and seven ten scores,  
November a number implored,  
Through martyrs good they came.  
Fifteen scores of saints there were  
And three thousand children of Morialis.  
In these Decembers above relatives  
Over the head of Jesus utter sighs.

XV\. Twelve thousand in the convention  
Believed through the voice of John.  
They worship, they deserve a portion,  
In heaven they will not be angry.

<span id="page_549">p. 549</span>

XVI\. Nine thousand saints received  
Baptism, and religion, and confession.  
Notwithstanding death the punishment of people (is) heat,  
Uffern, cold its refuge.  
If the Lord hath satisfied us,  
Through the head of Peter was made the destitute.

XVII\. Qui venerunt angli  
In natale Domini  
Media nocte in laudem  
Cum pastoribus in Bethleem.  
Nivem angli de celo  
Cum Michaele archanglo  
Qui precedunt precelio  
Erga animas in mundo  
Am nivem nivem angeli.  
Precedunt confirmati  
Vnistrati baptizati  
Usque in them judicii.  
Quando fuit Christus crucifixus ut sibi  
Ipsi placuisset venissent ibi in auxilium  
Plusquam duodecim legiones angelorum.  
Toto orbe terrarum.  
Jesus Christus videntem in agonia in mundo.  
Ut sint nostri auxilium  
Duodecim milia miliantem  
Ante tribunal stantem.  
Qui laudantie laudantium  
Tues mores rex regum.

XVIII\. The number that have been, and will be,  
Above heaven, below heaven, how many there are.  
And as many as have believed in revelation, <span id="page_550">p.
550</span>  
Believed through the will of the Lord.  
As many as are on wrath through the circles,  
Have mercy, God, on thy kindred.  
May I be meek, the turbulent ruler,  
May I not endure, before I am without motion.  
Grievously complaineth every lost one,  
Hastily, claimeth every needy one.  
An exceedingly displeased mind will not run  
From (its) present course, when I am angry.  
I will declare when I am in the gravel,  
From the maintenance of gifts,  
From being numbered, from going to be a martyr  
In the reckoning of Saint Segerno.  
From a word when sin may be to me,  
Let there be no sigh from those that hear me.
