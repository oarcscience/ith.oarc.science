### XXII.

### THE PRAISE OF TALIESSIN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XII.

MESSENGERS to me are come, so numerously are they sent,  
We shall bring a mutual conflict, so great is my bosom.  
Like the effect of the oar in the brine is the liquor of Beli, <span
id="page_301">p. 301</span>  
Like a light shield on the back of a shadow.  
Like wrath and indignation from the protection  
Of a Caer, and nine hundred governors became dead.  
There will be a battle on Menei, a vehement retribution.  
There will be more on Conwy, the scar of angry strife shall cause it  
Cold death the destiny of the ready muse,  
10 From the vehement blade by the stroke of Edyrn.  
Three elegant unrestrainable, fell, heavily laden with forces,  
There fleets in the stream, an omen of the day of gloom.  
Three evenings of battle for three proper  
Countries: a boat was made a burying place.  
Three of every three: three sins  
And Eryri a hill of judgment.  
A host of Saxons: the second they were, a third affliction.  
In Cymry widowhood awaits women.  
Before the presence of Cynan fire broke out.  
20 Cadwaladyr will bewail him.  
He injured the country with pain,  
Straw; and roof of houses; the house he burnt.  
There will be a wonder.  
A man with the daughter of his brother.  
They will cite what is steel  
Of the lineage of Anarawd.  
From him proceeded  
Coch, wise his prudence.  
He will not spare nor defend  
30 Either cousin or brother.  
At the voice of the warrior's horn,  
Nine hundred (were) anxious,  
Of universal affliction.  
Thou wilt be calling forth verdancy from affected praise,  
It will run to such as is oppressed in bosom.
