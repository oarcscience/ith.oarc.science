# CHAPTER VIII.

### THE CELTIC DIALECTS AND THE PROBABLE CHARACTER OF THE PICTISH LANGUAGE.

THERE is a fallacy which lurks in many of the arguments regarding the
ethnological character of the old Celtic nations, based upon the modern
languages. In arguing from the modern languages, it is always assumed
that the language of each branch of the old Celtic race must be
represented by one or other of the modern Celtic dialects. This fallacy
pervades the writings of almost all of our ethnological writers, who
argue as if, when a classical writer states that a difference existed
between the language of two divisions of the old Celtic people, and when
there is reason to suppose that the language of the one resembled the
Welsh, then it must of necessity follow that the language of the other
was the Gaelic. But this by no follows; nor is it at all self-evident
that these modern Celtic languages represent all the ancient dialects.
On the contrary, analogy and experience would lead us to a different
conclusion. The ruder a language is, the more multiplied are its
dialects; and the great medium for reducing their number is its
cultivation. Before the introduction of writing, the means of such
cultivation were to a great extent wanting. The Christian church was the
great

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

civiliser; and it was through its agency that these dialects received
their cultivation, and one of their forms raised to the position of a
written language. In the ante-Christian period of the Celtic language,
the diversity of dialects must have been very great, and there may be
many which have no direct representative among the modern languages.
There may be many lost dialects on the Continent; and one such certainly
existed, as we have seen in our own island, which has long ago
disappeared--viz. the Pictish.

There run, however, through the whole of the modern Celtic, languages
two great distinctive dialectic differences, which lie deep in the very
groundwork of the language, and must have existed before their entrance
into Great Britain, if not before their entrance into Europe. These
differences separate these languages into two classes, each consisting
of three of the spoken tongues. The one class, which we shall call the
Cymric, consists of the Breton, the Welsh, and the Cornish;, the other,
which we shall call the Gaelic, consists of the Irish, the Manx, and the
Scotch Gaelic. The three Gaelic dialects are much more closely allied to
each other than the three Cymric dialects; but each of the dialects
composing the one class possesses in common those great distinctive
differences which separate them from the three dialects composing the
other class.

But while this great diversity exists, there are also analogies so
close, vital, and fundamental, as to leave no doubt that they are all
children of one common parent. Their vocabulary is, to a great extent,
closely

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

allied. A distinguished Welsh scholar of the present day estimates that
two-thirds of the vocabulary of the six dialects are substantially the
same; and I believe this conclusion to be correct. A number of the
primitive adjectives expressing the simplest conceptions are the same.
It is a peculiarity of both classes that the irregular forms bear a
smaller proportion to the regular forms than is usual; but these
irregular forms, which are, in fact, the deposit of an older stage of
the language, bear a very remarkable analogy to each other.

The great and leading peculiarity in both classes of the Celtic
languages, however, is the mutation of initial consonants; and while
these initial mutations exist in each class, and are governed by the
same laws, and thus afford additional evidence of their common origin,
they at the same time present us with a means of discriminating between
the different dialects, and distinguishing their mutual position as
such, quite as effectual as Grimm's law has been among the German
dialects. The consonants most readily affected by initial mutation are
the mute consonants; and the following tables will show what the initial
mutations in Welsh and Irish are:--

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

But while these consonants thus undergo a change according to fixed laws
*within* the limits of the language itself, there is also a similar
interchange of sounds *between* the different spoken languages; and it
is obvious that if the changes which the same words undergo in different
dialects follow regular laws, the phonetic laws of these languages are
of the utmost importance in discriminating their dialectic differences.
The phonetic law which governs the relations of Welsh and Gaelic, so far
as regards the mute consonants, is this:--Each mute consonant in Welsh
has two changes in Gaelic, either into its own middle sound, or into
another consonant of the same character, but of a different organ. Thus
the labial *p* passes into its middle sound *b*, as in

or into the guttural *c*, as in

</tbody>
</table>

 

\[paragraph continues\] This latter change is deeply rooted in Welsh and
Gaelic, and enters into the very life of the language, of which we have
two very remarkable instances. The word *Pascha*, for Easter, can only
have entered these languages after the establishment of the Christian
church, when the languages, under the influence of its teaching, were
passing into the fixed form of a written and cultivated speech; but
while in Welsh it becomes

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

pasg, in Gaelic, under the operation of this law, it becomes *casg*. On
the other hand, St. *Ciaran*, an Irish saint, and the founder of
Clonmacnois, passed over, in the sixth century, into Cornwall, and had
no sooner put his foot on Cymric ground than he became St. *Pieran*.

In the next class of the mutes the converse takes place, for the Welsh
guttural *g* either disappears or passes into the dental *d*, as in

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="324">

</tbody>
</table>

 

\[paragraph continues\] There is here, however, a slight deviation from
the general rule: *g* in Welsh is usually combined with *w*, and is in
this combination the Welsh digamma; but instead of passing into *w*,
according to the law, it becomes in Gaelic *f*; that is, the guttural in
Welsh passes into an aspirated labial in Gaelic, as in

This is sufficient to illustrate the law of this double change; but it
is rather remarkable that while the one change is into a different
character of the same letter, and in strict accordance with the phonetic
change within the language itself, the other change is from a letter of
one organ to that of another, as from labial to guttural, and guttural
to dental. The operating cause

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

of this rather startling change is to be found within in the laws which
govern the sounds of the whole languages of this class, and in
consequence of which the same phenomenon presents itself in other
members of the Indo-European family.

There are two influences at work at all languages, antagonistic and
mutually destructive of each other--the etymologic and the phonetic. The
one governs the formation of a language, the other aids in its
disorganisation. The etymologic influence has reference to meaning only,
and brings together sounds which do not harmonise. These are immediately
assailed by the phonetic influence, and modified till they are brought
to a more simple and harmonious sound. History knows nothing of the
formation of languages, and the phonetic influence is at work, and
language in a process of decay, before the people which speak it have
entered the historic period; but when these phonetic laws have become
known, we are able to trace back the sounds, however impaired, to their
original constituent elements. These contrasts, then, of labial and
guttural, and guttural and dental, draw us back to a time when there
were complex sounds which the human ear could not long tolerate, and
which, by the modification of one or other element, passed over into the
more simple sound, and in their divorce from each, other present this
great contrast. There was probably a complex sound composed of a
guttural and labial; *k*, or hard *c*, and *v* or *p*. By one member of
the family the *c* will be softened to *s*, and then disappear; while
the *v* will

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

be hardened to *p*, and remain alone. In another, the hard *c* will
remain, and the *v* be softened to *u*, and then disappear, leaving the
*c* alone. An instance of this is the word for a "horse," which runs
through most of the languages of the Indo-European family. The original
term must have been *acvas*; in Sanscrit it becomes *asvas*; in Zend,
*aspas*; in Greek, *ippos*; and in Gaulish or old Celtic, *epo*. In
Latin the hard *c* is retained, and *v* modified, and it becomes
*equus*; and in Gaelic, *ech*. The same process would seem to have been
gone through within the Celtic languages, as the old inscriptions
indicate that the old Celtic word for a "son" was *maqvas*. By one
branch of the race the hard *c* was softened, and then dropped; while
the *v* was hardened to *p*, producing the Welsh *map* (a son). By the
other, the hard *c* was retained, but the *v* softened to *u*, in which
form we have it as *maqui*, and finally dropped, leaving the Gaelic
*mac*. The digamma, too, was originally a complex sound, which in Welsh
is *gw*, and in Latin *v*, and in Gaelic *f*.

The consonantal changes between Welsh and Gaelic are, then, as follow:--

The vowel changes from Welsh to Gaelic are from *w* to *o* and *y* to
*e*, which are likewise the masculine and feminine forms in Welsh, as--

The vowel *e* becomes *ea*, as in *pen* (a head), *ceann*, and *beann*,
G. Such being the relations between Gaelic, and Welsh, it must be
obvious that they are of a nature to enable us to fix, from the form of
the words, the relative position of almost any Celtic dialect to these
two great types of the twofold division of the language; and the
question at once arises, whether they may not enable us to determine the
position of that one Celtic dialect in Great Britain--of which we have
no direct living representative--viz. the Pictish. Of this language only
five words have been handed directly down to us; but still, if these
words are of such a kind as to exhibit some of the phonetic laws of the
language, we are not without the means of determining this question.
These five words are--

1\. PEANFAHEL.--Bede, who wrote in the eighth century, says that the
Roman Wall commenced about two miles west of the monastery of Abercorn,
"in loco qui sermone Pictorum Peanfahel, lingua autem Anglorum Penneltun
appellatur;" and Nennius adds that the wall was called "Britannico
sermone Guaul," and extended "a Penguaul quæ villa Scotice Cenail,
Anglice vero Peneltun dicitur." This gives us *Penguaul* as the British
form, *Peanfahel* as the Pictish, and *Cenail* as the Scottish.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

2\. UR.--One of the Pictish legends which had been added to the
*Historia Britonum*, and has been preserved in the Irish *Nennius*, is
expressly stated to have been taken from the books of the Picts, and has
so important a bearing on this question that I insert it here entire:.--

"Of the origin of the Cruithneach here. Cruithne, son of Cing, son of
Luctai, son of Partalan, son of Agnoin, son of Buain, son of Mais, son
of Fathecht, son of Iafeth, son of Noe. He was the father of the
Cruichneach, and reigned a hundred years. These are the seven sons of
Cruithne--viz. Fib, Fidach, Fodla, Fortrend, warlike, Cait, Ce,
Cirig--and they divided the land into seven divisions, as Columcille
says:--

Seven children of Cruithne  
Divided Alban into seven divisions:  
Cait, Ce, Cirig, a warlike clan,  
Fib, Fidach, Fotla, Fortrenn.

\[paragraph continues\] And the name of each man is given to their
territories, as Fib, Ce, Cait, and the rest. Thirteen kings of them took
possession. Fib reigned twenty-four years; Fidach, forty years;
Fortrend, seventy years; Cait, twenty-two years; Ce, twelve years;
Cirig, eighty years; Aenbecan, son of Cait, thirty years; Finecta, sixty
years; Guidid Gadbre, *id est*, Geis, one year; Gest Gurid, forty years;
Urges, thirty years; Brude Pont, thirty kings of them; and Brude was the
name of each man of them, and of the divisions of the other men. They
possessed an hundred and fifty years, *as it is in the Books of the
Cruithneach*.

"Brude Pont, B. urpont, B. Leo, B. urleo, B. Gant, B. urgant, B. Gnith,
B. urgnith, B. Fech, B. urfeich, B. Cal, B. urcal, B. Cint, B. urcint,
B. Feth, B. urfeth, B. Ru, B. ero, B. Gart, B. urgart, B. Cind, B.
urcind, B. Uip, B. uruip, B. Grith, B. urgrith, B. Muin, B.
urnmin." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

Thus ends this very curious fragment, which

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

undoubtedly contains a number of Pictish vocables. I shall advert to
these afterwards; at present I have to do with only one. It will be
observed that the names of the thirty kings descended from Bruide Pont
consist of only fifteen vocables, each name being repeated with the
syllable *ur* prefixed. We have something exactly analogous to this in
the old Welsh genealogies annexed to the Harleian MS. of Nennius, and
written in the year 977. The ancestry of Cunedda Guledig is there thus
given:--Cunedda, son of Patern, son of Tacit, son of Cein, son of
*Gwr*cein, son of Doli, son of *Gwr*doli, son of Duvn, son of *Gwr*duvn.
This is evidently the same thing--*guor*, *gur*, or *gwr*, representing
the Pictish *ur*. Again, one of the Pictish names is Urgest; and this
name is repeated afterwards in the list of Pictish kings, where we twice
have Ungust, son of Urgest; while the *Irish Annals* give the Irish
equivalent as Aongus, son of Feargus--*fear* representing *ur*. We thus
get the following forms:--Cymric, *gwr*; Pictish, *ur*; Gaelic, *fear*.

3\. SCOLOFTH.--Reginald of Durham, in his *Libellus de admirandis Beati
Cuthberti Virtutibus*--a work of the twelfth century--tells: of, a
certain "Scolasticus Pictorum apud Cuthbrictiskchirch," or Kirkcudbright
in Galloway; and says he was one of those "clerici qui in ecclesia illa
commorantur qui, Pictorum lingua Scollofthes cognominantur."
*Scolasticus* in Welsh is *yscolheic*; in Irish, *sgolog*.

4\. CARTIT.--Cormac, in his old *Irish Glossary*, compiled in the ninth
century, has--"*Cartit*, id est

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

delg, id est *belra cruithnech*, id est *delg for a curtar a choss*;"
that is; "*cartit*, a buckle, is a Pictish word. It is a buckle for
putting on the foot." The Welsh equivalent is *gwaell*; the Irish is
given by Cormac, *dealg*.

5\. DUIPER.--In another of the Pictish fragments, which also formed part
of the *Pictish Chronicle*, one of the mythic kings is thus given,
"Gartnaidh Duiper." In the *Chronicle of the Priory of St. Andrew*,
which contains a Scottish list of the same kings, the epithet is
translated thus--"Gartnech *dives*," or rich. "Rich" in Welsh is
*goludog*; in Irish, *saoibher*.

From these five words we gather the following phonetic changes. In the
first we see the initial *p* in Cymric and Pictish passing over into *c*
in Gaelic, the Cymric *e* passing into *ea* in Pictish and Gaelic, and
the Cymric *gu* passing into *f* in Pictish, and neutralised by
aspiration in Gaelic. In the second, *gwr* becomes *ur* in Pictish,
*fear* in Gaelic. In the third we see the final guttural in Cymric and
Gaelic softened to the dental in Pictish. The fourth is a peculiar word,
but the Welsh and Irish equivalents furnish an example of *g* passing
into *d*. In the fifth, the Pictish *duiper* and the Gaelic *saoibher*
are the same word, showing *d* passing into *s*.

From these examples, Pictish appears to occupy a place between Cymric
and Gaelic, leaning to the one in some of its phonetic laws, and to the
other in others. Thus in the initial of the first word we have a Cymric
form. The vowel-changes are Gaelic, and

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the initial of the second syllable also Gaelic; and on comparing the
first two, words we see, that, while gw in Cymric ought, according to
the general law; to pass into *u* in Gaelic--but in reality passes into
*f*--the Pictish law combines both; and the Pictish canon is that *gw*
in Cymric before a consonant becomes *u* in Pictish, and before a vowel
becomes *f* in Pictish as in Gaelic.

The other words do not help us, at this stage of the inquiry; but we
have another source of information in the proper names, of which we have
in the lists of the Pictish kings the Pictish forms in the Irish
*Nennius* and the *Pictish Chronicle*, and the Irish or Gaelic forms in
the *Chronicle of the Priory of St. Andrew* and the *Irish Annals*,
while the Welsh genealogies furnish Cymric equivalents. The phonetic
laws which govern these, are equally available for our purpose. First,
the Pictish law which changes *gw* into *u* before a consonant and *f*
before a vowel, appears in the Pictish names Urgest, Uroid, and
Fingaine; the Cymric equivalents of which are Gwrgust, Gwriad, and
Gwyngenau; and the Gaelic, Feargus, Ferat, and Fingon. Then in the
Pictish Drust, Deriloi, and Dalorgan, the Cymric equivalents of which
are Grwst, Gwrtholi, and Galargan, we have the *g* passing into *d*,
which is a Gaelic form. In the Pictish Domnall, the Cymric equivalent of
which is Dwfnwall, we have the vowel-change of *w* into *o*, also a
Gaelic form. The following table will show the result of this
analysis:--

The Pictish tradition which I have given at length, besides yielding the
word *ur*, furnishes us with a series of Pictish vocables. These are,
first, the seven sons of Cruithne. They are said to have divided the
land into seven portions, and to have given their names to them. We can
identify some of them. "Fib" is plainly Fife, the old form of which was
Fibh. "Fodla" is Atholl, the old form of which name was Ath*fodla*.
"Fortrenn" is the well-known name of the central district of the Pictish
kingdom, which has now disappeared. "Cirig" or "Circin," as in the
*Pictish Chronicle*, is the district of Girgin or *Maghghirghin*; now
corrupted into Mearns, or Kincardineshire. "Caith" is Caithness, as in
the old poem in the Irish *Nennius*,--

From thence they conquered Alba,  
The noble nurse of fruitfulness,  
Without destroying the people or their homes,  
From the region of Cait to Forcu;"

 

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

that is, from Caithness to the Forth, the southern boundary of the
Pictish kingdom. "Ce" and "Fidach" I cannot identify. But it will be
observed, of these seven sons, the names of four begin with *f*, and the
other three with *c*, obvious Gaelic forms; and I am inclined to think
that they mark out a division of the Pictish race into two, of which one
affected the guttural *c*, and the other the softer sound of the *f*.

Of the six names which follow, Aenbecan and Finecta are Gaelic forms;
Guidid, Cymric; Gest, Urgest, and Brude, Pictish, as distinguished from
either; and the untranslated epithets, Gadbre, Geis, and Gurid, are
probably Pictish words.

The names of the thirty Brudes yield also fifteen Pictish monosyllables.
These are, alphabetically, Cal, Cint, Cind, Fech, Feth, Gant, Gart,
Geis, Gnith, Grith, Leo, Muin, Pont, Ru, Uip; and here also the
prevalence of the gutturals, *c*, *g*, and the soft *f* is apparent.
Some of these monosyllables have a resemblance to the names of the old
Irish letters which signify trees, as *cal*, the name for *c*, a hazel;
*feth* seems the same as *pet*, the name for *p*; *gart*, like *gort*
(ivy), the name for *g*; *muin*, the vine, is the name for *m*; and
*leo* resembles *luis*, and *ru*, *ruis*, ash and alder, the names for
*l* and *r*. In the same manner three of the names of the seven sons of
Cruithne have a resemblance to three of the numerals; as fib, *pump*,
five; ce, *se*, six; caith, *saith*, seven. These, however, may be
casual resemblances.

The relation of the fifteen vocables to the proper

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

names is more apparent. On analysing the proper names of the Cymri and
the Gael we find that both are produced by the same process--viz. a
certain number of monosyllables forms the first half of the name, and to
these are affixed a certain number of endings, the combination of which
forms the proper names. In Cymric the initial syllables are--Ael, Aer,
Arth, Bed, Cad, Car, Col, Cyn, Dog, Dygvn, El, Eur, Gar, Gor, Gwen,
Gwyn, Gwyd, Gwr, Id, Mael, Mor, Tal, Tud, Ty. The Irish initial
syllables are--Aen, Ain, Air, Aid, Art, Cath, Con, Corb, Cu, Domh, Donn,
Dubh, Dun, Each, Echt, Eoch, Er, For, Fian, Fin, Finn, Fedh, Fear, Fail,
Flaith, Flann, Gorm, Ir, Laigh, Lear, Lugh, Maen, Muir, Ragh, Reacht,
Ruadh, Rud, Saer, Tuath. It would be endless to enumerate the affixes;
but the most common Cymric are--deyrn, varch, wyr, swys; as, Aelgyvarch,
Cadvarch, Cynvarch, Aerdeyrn, Cyndeyrn, Arthwys, Cynwys, etc.; and in
Irish, cal, or in oblique case, gal and gusa; as, Aengus, Artgal,
Ardgal, Congus, Congal, Dungus, Dungal, Feargus, Feargal, and so forth.
Now these fifteen Pictish vocables likewise enter into the Pictish
names, as Gart in Gartnaidh, and Dergart and Geis in Urgest; Leo in
Morleo, Muin in Muinait, Uip in Uipog, and so forth. On the whole, the
Pictish vocables coincide more with the Irish than with the Cymric, as
Cal with Gal, Geis with Gusa, and so forth.

Further, on comparing the initial forms in Irish and in Cymric, we see
in Cymric no words beginning with *f*, while in Irish there are nine; so
that the vocables in

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Pictish with initial *f* are Gaelic. On the
other hand, six vocables begin with *g* in Cymric, and only one in
Irish; so that here the Pictish draws to the Cymric, and stands between
the two with a greater leaning to the Gaelic.

The same fallacy which pervades the ethnological deductions regarding
the Gauls also affects this Pictish question. It has been too much
narrowed by the assumption that, if it is shewn to be a Celtic dialect,
it must of necessity be absolutely identic in all its features either
with Welsh or with Gaelic. But this necessity does not really exist; and
the result I come to is, that it is not Welsh, neither is it Gaelic; but
it is a Gaelic dialect partaking largely of Welsh forms.

It has always appeared to me that we can trace in the Celtic languages a
twofold subordinate dialectic difference lying side by side, which is
very analogous to some of the differences between high and low German. I
do not mean to say that the differences between those subordinate Celtic
dialects are absolutely parallel to those, between high and low German;
but merely that they are of a nature which renders this nomenclature not
inapplicable, while it affords a convenient term of distinction. A
leading distinction between the high and low German is the preference of
the latter for the sharp sounds, *p*, *t*, and *k*, instead of *f* or
*pf*, *s* or *z* and *ch*; and the instance most familiar to us is the
substitution of *t* for *s*, as *wasser* in high German becomes *water*
in low, and water in English; *dasz* in high German is *dat* in low, and
*that* in English.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Now, a similar distinction is, in one point of view, observable among
the three dialects of the Cymric. Of these dialects, the Cornish and
Breton are much nearer to each other than either is to the Welsh. It is,
in fact, a mistake to suppose, as is frequently asserted, that a
Welshman and a Breton can understand each other. One of our best Welsh
scholars, Mr. Price, who visited Bretagne, remarks: "Notwithstanding the
many assertions that have been made respecting the natives of Wales and
Brittany being mutually intelligible through the medium of their
respective languages, I do not hesitate to say that the thing is utterly
impossible. Single words in either language will frequently be found to
have corresponding terms of a similar sound in the other, and
occasionally a short sentence deliberately pronounced may be partially
intelligible; but as to holding a conversation, that is totally out of
the question." Cornish and Breton are much more nearly allied. Now, it
is remarkable that in many cases *d*, *dd*, and *t*, in Welsh, pass into
*s* in Cornish and *z* in Breton, as in

|               |                |
|---------------|----------------|
| W. *Tad*.     | C. *Tas*.      |
| W. *Goludog*. | C. *Gallosah*. |
| W. *Bleidd*.  | B. *Bleiz*.    |
| W. *Noeth*.   | B. *Noz*.      |

 

which is exactly analogous to one of the leading differences between
high and low German; and Welsh, like the latter, shows a great
preference for the dentals and its aspirates. I am therefore inclined to
introduce the same nomenclature among the Celtic languages,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

and to call Welsh "low Cymric," Cornish and Breton "high Cymric"
dialects.

The three dialects which compose the Gaelic class are much more nearly
allied to each other than even Cornish and Armoric, and may be held to
represent the old Scottish. On the same analogy they all belong to a
high Gaelic dialect. There are, to be found, however, among the synonyms
in the Gaelic dialects, low Gaelic forms accompanying high Gaelic forms,
as in

which seems to indicate that a low Gaelic dialect has been incorporated
or become blended with it.

The Pictish language appears to have approached more nearly to the old
Scottish than even Breton to Welsh, according to Mr. Price's view; for
Adomnan, who, in the seventh century, wrote the *Life of St. Columba*,
the Scottish missionary to the Picts, describes St. Columba, the Scot,
as conversing freely with the Picts, from the king to the plebeian,
without difficulty; but when he preached to them the Word of God, he was
obliged to make use of an interpreter: that is, he could make himself
understood in conversing, but not in preaching; and, conversely, a Pict
understood what he said in Scottish, but could not follow a Scottish
sermon. This is a point, in fact, as to which there exists much
misapprehension; and we are apt. to forget how

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

very small a difference even in pronunciation will interpose an obstacle
to mutual intelligence. Even in Breton and Cornish, the two Cymric
dialects which most nearly approach each other, Norris, the highest
Cornish authority, says, "In spite of statements to the contrary, the
writer is of opinion that a Breton, within the historical existence of
the two dialects could not have understood a Cornishman speaking at any
length, or on any but the most trivial subjects;" and between Irish and
Scotch Gaelic it would not require very much additional divergence to
prevent the one from understanding the other.

Such being probably the mutual position of Pictish and Scottish, the few
words we are able to compare show the difference between them to have
been of the same character as between the high and low dialects; for we
find *saoibher* (rich) in Irish represented by *duiper* in Pictish; and
in proper names, Sarran by Taran, showing *s* in the one represented by
*d* and *t* in the other; while the words *sgolofth*, *cartit*, and the
proper names, *Bargoit*, *Wroid*, *Wid*, show the preference of the
Pictish for dental in place of guttural terminations. I consider,
therefore, that Pictish was a low Gaelic dialect; and, following out the
analogy, the result I come to is, that Cymric and Gaelic had each a high
and a low variety; that Cornish and Breton were high Cymric dialects,
Welsh low Cymric; that old Scottish, spoken by the Scotti, now
represented by Irish, Scotch Gaelic, and Manx, was the high Gaelic
dialect, and Pictish the low Gaelic dialect.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

This analogy is confirmed by the legendary origins of these different
races, in which, under the form of a mythic migration, the traces of a
rude and primitive ethnology often lie hid. The tendencies which produce
the high and low German are, as we have remarked, associated with the
character of the country peopled by them. The low German forms are
connected with the level and marshy plains which border on the German
Ocean, the high German with the more mountainous region of the south of
Germany; but the same characteristics mark the mythic. migrations of the
Celtic races which peopled Britain. In the Welsh traditions, the Cymry,
which are represented by the Welsh or low Cymric people, are said to
have crossed the German Ocean from the north of Germany; the Lloegrys,
represented by the Cornish or high Cymric, are brought from the South.
In the old Irish traditions, the different races said to have peopled
Ireland fall into two classes: the one is said to have penetrated
through Europe by the Rhiphaean Mountains to the Baltic, and to have
crossed the German Ocean; and the other is brought by the Mediterranean
and the south of Europe. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) The former
alone are said to have made settlements in Scotland; and Bode, in giving
the tradition of the origin of the Picts, brings them likewise from the
north of Germany across the German Ocean. This population which preceded
the German races was, in fact, the race of the Celts, who seem to have
been driven westward by the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

pressure of the Teutonic movement; and, like the German, to have shown a
twofold minor difference, produced by the same physical influence, which
is known by the names of "high" and "low" German.

The platform occupied by the Pictish people was not confined to Scotland
alone, for they certainly extended over part of the north of Ireland,
and formed, in all probability, an earlier population of the north half
of Ireland, which became subjugated by the Scots. On the other hand, the
Scots at an early period occupied the district of Argyll. In the north
of Ireland and the west of Scotland the Picts must, at an early period,
have become blended with the Scots, and their form of the Gaelic
assimilated to the Scottish. In Scotland, south of the Tay, where they
occupied the districts from the Tay to the Forth, the region of Manau or
Manann, and Galloway, they came in contact with the Cymric people, and
the one being a low Gaelic dialect, and the other a low Cymric dialect,
their forms must have so far resembled each other as to lead to an
admixture presenting that mixed language of low Gaelic with Cymric
forms, known to Bode as the Pictish language.
