<P>I. I WILL praise the sovereign, supreme king of the land,<BR>
Who hath extended his dominion over the shore of the world.<BR>
Complete was the prison of Gweir in Caer Sidi,<BR>
Through the spite of Pwyll and Pryderi.<BR>
No one before him went into it.<BR>
The heavy blue chain held the faithful youth,<BR>
And before the spoils of Annwvn woefully he sings,<BR>
And till doom shall continue a bard of prayer.<BR>
Thrice enough to fill Prydwen, we went into it;<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Sidi.</P>
<P>II. Am I not a candidate for fame, if a song is heard?<BR>
In Caer Pedryvan, four its revolutions;<BR>
In the first word from the cauldron when spoken, <A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A><BR>
From the breath of nine maidens it was gently warmed.<BR>
Is it not the cauldron of the chief of Annwvn? What is its intention?<BR>
A ridge about its edge and pearls.<BR>
It will not boil the food of a coward, that has not been sworn,<BR>
A sword bright gleaming to him was raised,<BR>
And in the hand of Lleminawg it was left.<BR>
And before the door of the gate of Uffern the lamp was burning.<BR>
And when we went with Arthur, a splendid labour,<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Vedwyd.</P>
<P>III. Am I not a candidate for fame with the listened song<BR>
In Caer Pedryvan, in the isle of the strong door?<BR>
The twilight and pitchy darkness were mixed together.<BR>
Bright wine their liquor before their retinue.<BR>
Thrice enough to fill Prydwen we went on the sea,<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Rigor.</P>
<P>IV. I shall not deserve much from the ruler of literature,<BR>
Beyond Caer Wydyr they saw not the prowess of Arthur.<BR>
Three score Canhwr stood on the wall,<BR>
Difficult was a conversation with its sentinel.<BR>
Thrice enough to fill Prydwen there went with Arthur,<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Golud.</P>
<P>V. I shall not deserve much from those with long shields.<BR>
They know not what day, who the causer,<BR>
What hour in the serene day Cwy was born.<BR>
Who caused that he should not go to the dales of Devwy.<BR>
They know not the brindled ox, thick his head-band.<BR>
Seven score knobs in his collar.<BR>
And when we went with Arthur, of anxious memory,<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Vandwy.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></P>
<P>VI. I shall not deserve much from those of loose bias,<BR>
They know not what day the chief was caused.<BR>
What hour in the serene day the owner was born.<BR>
What animal they keep, silver its head.<BR>
When we went with Arthur of anxious contention,<BR>
Except seven, none returned from Caer Ochren.</P>
<P>VII. Monks congregate like dogs in a kennel,<BR>
From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge,<BR>
Is one the course of the wind, is one the water of the sea?<BR>
Is one the spark of the fire, of unrestrainable tumult?<BR>
Monks congregate like wolves,<BR>
From contact with their superiors they acquire knowledge.<BR>
They know not when the deep night and dawn divide.<BR>
Nor what is the course of the wind, or who agitates it,<BR>
In what place it dies away, on what land it roars.<BR>
The grave of the saint is vanishing from the altar-tomb.<BR>
I will pray to the Lord, the great supreme,<BR>
That I be not wretched. Christ be my portion.</P>
