### XXXIX.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXII.

URIEN of the cultivated plain,  
The most generous man of baptism,  
Abundance has been given  
To the men of earth.  
As it has been gathered,  
It has been scattered.  
Joyful the bards of baptism  
Whilst thy life continues.  
There is greater joy  
10 For the high-famed, and liberal of praise. <span id="page_345">p.
345</span>  
It is greater glory,  
That Urien and his children should exist.  
And he especially  
The supreme Guledig.  
In a distant city,  
A principal pilgrim,  
The Lloegrians know him,  
When they converse.  
Death they had,  
20 And frequent vexation,  
Burning their homesteads,  
And drawing their coverings.  
And loss,  
And great incomprehension,  
Without obtaining deliverance  
From Urien Reged.  
The protector of Reged,  
The praise of Ior, the anchor of the country.  
My inclination is on thee,  
30 Of every hearing.  
Heavy thy spear-throwing,  
When the battle is heard,  
When they resort to battle,  
A smarting is made.  
Fire in houses before day,  
Before the sovereign of the cultivated plain,  
The most fair cultivated plain,  
And its most generous men.  
The Angles are accustomed to be without homage  
40 From most valiant king.  
A most valiant progeny,  
Thine is the best.  
Of those who have been, or will be,  
There is not thy match. <span id="page_346">p. 346</span>  
When he is looked upon,  
Very great is the terror.  
It is usual to look for him,  
For an active king.  
Around him a modest demeanour,  
50 And the varied multitude,  
The splendid prince of the North,  
The choicest of princes.  
And when I fail in age,  
In the sore necessity of death,  
May I not be smiling,  
If I praise not Urien.
