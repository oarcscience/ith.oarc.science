### XL.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXIII.

IN rest,  
A song I kept.  
Respect and plenty  
And mead I possessed.  
I possessed mead.  
His triumph,  
And fair lands,  
A great wonder.  
And gold and hour,  
10 And hour and treasure,  
And plenty  
And esteem.  
And giving a desire,  
A desire of giving it,  
To encourage me.  
He slays, he plagues,  
He cherishes, he honours, <span id="page_347">p. 347</span>  
He honours, he cherishes,  
He slays before him.  
20 Presence was given  
To the bards of the world.  
Ever certainly  
To thee they say  
According to thy will.  
God hath caused to thee  
The shoulder of kings  
Against despicable fear.  
Incitement of battle  
The protection of a country.  
30 The country protected  
Battle of incitement  
Usual about thee  
The tumult of capering,  
The capering of tumult  
And drinking of ale.  
Ale for the drinking,  
And a fair homestead,  
And beautiful clothing,  
To me has been extended.  
40 The lofty Llwyvenydd,  
And requests open.  
In one dwell  
Great and little.  
Taliessin's song  
Thou comfortest it.  
Thou art the best  
Of those that have heard  
His vehement animosities.  
I also will praise  
50 Thy deeds,  
And until I fail in old age,<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>  
In the sore necessity of death,  
May I not be smiling  
If I praise not Urien.
