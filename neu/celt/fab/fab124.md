### CIX.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST VII.

I. THE Calends of winter, hard is the grain;  
The leaves are on the move, the plash is full;  
In the morning before he sets off,  
Woe to him that trusts to a stranger.

II\. The Calends of winter, the time of pleasant gossiping,  
The gale and the storm keep equal pace;  
It is the work of the wise to keep a secret.

III\. The Calends of winter, the stags are lean,  
Yellow, the tops of birch, deserted the summer dwelling;  
Woo to him who for a trifle deserves disgrace.

IV\. The Calends of winter, the tops of the branches are bent;  
Uproar from the mouth of the vicious is common;  
Where there is no natural gift there will be no learning.

V. The Calends of winter, blustering is the weather,  
Unlike the beginning of summer;  
Except God, there is none that divines.

VI\. The Calends of Winter, gay the plumage of birds;  
Short the day; loud the cuckoos;  
Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.

VII, The Calends of winter, it is hard and dry;  
Very black is the raven, quick the arrow from the bow;  
At the stumbling of the old, the smile of the youth is apt to break out.

VIII\. The Calends of winter, lean is the stag:  
Woe to the weak! if he chafes, it will be but for a short while;  
Truly better is amiability than beauty.

IX\. The Calends of winter, bare is where the heath is burnt,  
The plough is in the furrow; the ox at work;  
Amongst a hundred there is hardly a friend.
