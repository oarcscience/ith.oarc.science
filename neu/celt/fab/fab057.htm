<P>EXTOL the career of the kings of Reged.<BR>
Was I not an expense to thee, though I am thine?<BR>
They brandished the blade of battle, and spears of battle,<BR>
Men brandished under the round shield; lights<BR>
White gulls trampled.<BR>
It was not fell fought. A false king is not good.<BR>
The Guledig will prepare himself against contusions.<BR>
He will not drive the business of those that seek him.<BR>
We shall have a nimble horseman, of Gwirion's fame,<BR>
10 A leader of fair promise, wise as Don.<BR>
Until Ulph came with violence on his enemies.<BR>
Until Urien came in the day to Aeron.<BR>
He was not an agressor, there appeared not<BR>
The uplifted front of Urien before Powys.<BR>
Was not easily treated the heat of the compact elf the tribes,<BR>
Hyveidd and Gododin and the lion prince.<BR>
Bold in patience, and journey of joint summons.<BR>
Without pollution he drew blood in his veins.<BR>
(He) that saw Llwyvenydd humbly will tremble,<BR>
20 A conspicuous banner in the second place,<BR>
A battle in the ford of Alclud, a battle at the Inver.<BR>
The battle of Cellawr Brewyn. The battle of Hireurur.<BR>
A battle in the underwood of Cadleu, a battle in Aberioed.<BR>
He interposes with the steel loud (and) great.<BR>
The battle of Cludvein, the, affair of the head of the wood.<BR>
A tribe attracted of dogs to a plentitude of blood.<BR>
To destroy supreme felicity is the aim<BR>
Of the Angles, a hostile crew. <A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A><BR>
Ruddy-stained from the conflict with Ulph at the ford.<BR>
30 Better is born the Guledig, forward was born his lord,<BR>
Prydain's chief proprietor, harmonious his lord.<BR>
He bare not clothes, either blue or gray,<BR>
Or red or green; he will not honour the ground.<BR>
He placed not his thigh over Moel Maelaur,<BR>
On horses of the speckled race of Mor Greidiawl.<BR>
Summer until winter, and gently in hand,<BR>
On ford, and course exercising them.<BR>
And a guest under songs and exalting one's-self,<BR>
And until the end of the world was perceived the band.<BR>
40 They arrange, they sweep about chainless for an image,<BR>
Uncowardly about lights did I not mangle?<BR>
I strove against the fall of spears on shoulders.<BR>
Shield in hand, Godeu. and Reged protecting;<BR>
Did I not see a man folding cattle?<BR>
A serpent of enchantment, a comely trampler of the ground.<BR>
Do I not know a war wherein he was lost,<BR>
And how much I lose by his perishing?<BR>
I shall not be extremely angry to possess mead-liquor.<BR>
From the heroic Hyveidd, of hospitable course.<BR>
50 Wit not I that was permitted (to have) shelter of the battle.<BR>
My kings were broken off from cheerful graces,<BR>
Shelter of the country good to the oppressed.<BR>
And until I fail in age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
If I praise not Urien.</P>
