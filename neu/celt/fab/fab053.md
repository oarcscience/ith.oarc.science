### XXXVIII.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXI.

THE men of Catraeth arose with the dawn,  
About the Guledig, of work a profitable merchant.  
This Urien, without mockery is his regret.  
He sustains the sovereignty and its demands.  
Warlike, the grandeur of a perfect prince of baptism.  
The men of Prydain hurtful in battle array,  
At Gwenystrad, continuously offerers of battle.  
Protected neither the field nor woods  
The people with shelter, when tribulation comes.  
10 Like the wave loud roaring over the beach,  
I saw valiant men in battle array,  
And after the morning, battle-mangled flesh.  
I saw a tumult of three limits slain,  
A shout active in front was heard.  
In defending Gwenystrad was seen  
A mound and slanting ground obstructing.  
In the pass of the ford I saw men gory-tinted,  
Dropping their arms before the pallid miserable ones.  
They join in peace as they were losers. <span id="page_344">p.

20 Hand on the cross they wail on the gravel bank of Garanwynyon.  
The tribes revel over the rising wave.  
The billows protect the hair of their captures.  
I saw men of splendid progress  
With blood that clotted on the garments,  
Toiling energetically and incessantly in battle.  
The covering battle, where there was no flight, when contrived.  
The ruler of Reged, I am astonished at what was dared.  
I saw a brow covered with rage on Urien,  
When he furiously attacked his foes at the white stone  
30 Of Galystem. His rage was a blade;  
The bucklered men were sustained in need.  
May a desire of battle come on Euirwyn.  
And until I fail in old age,  
In the sore necessity of death,  
May I not be smiling,  
If I praise not Urien.
