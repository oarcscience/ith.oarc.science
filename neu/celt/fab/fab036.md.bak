### XX.

### THE DEATH-SONG OF UTHYR PENDRAGON.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLVIII.

AM I not with hosts making a din?  
I would not cease, between two hosts, without gore.  
Am I not he that is called Gorlassar?  
My belt was a rainbow to my foe.  
Am I not a prince, in darkness, <span id="page_298">p. 298</span>  
(To him) that takes my appearance with my two chief baskets?  
Am I not, like Cawyl, ploughing?  
I would not cease without gore between two hosts.  
Is it not I that will defend my sanctuary?  
10 In separating with the friends of wrath.  
Have I not been accustomed to blood about the wrathful,  
A sword-stroke daring against the sons of Cawrnur?  
Have I not shared my cause.  
A ninth portion in the prowess of Arthur?  
Is it not I that have destroyed a hundred Caers?  
Is it not I that slew a hundred governors?  
Is it not I that have given a hundred veils?  
Is it not I that cut off a hundred heads?  
Is it not I that gave to Henpen  
20 The tremendous sword of the enchanter?  
Is it not I that performed the rights of purification,  
When Hayarndor went to the top of the mountain?  
I was bereaved to my sorrow. My confidence was commensurate.  
There was not a world were it not for my progeny.  
I am a bard to be praised. The unskilful  
May he be possessed by the ravens and eagle and bird of wrath.  
Avagddu came to him with his equal,  
When the bands of four men feed between two plains,  
Abiding in heaven was he, my desire,  
30 Against the eagle, against the fear of the unskilful.  
I am a bard, and I am a harper,  
I am a piper, and I am a crowder.  
Of seven score musicians the very great  
Enchanter. There was of the enamelled honour the privilege,  
Hu of the expanded wings. <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>  
Thy son, thy barded proclamation,  
Thy steward, of a gifted father.  
MY tongue to recite my death-song.  
If of stone-work the opposing wall of the world.  
40 May the countenance of Prydain be bright for my guidance,  
Sovereign of heaven, let my messages not be rejected.
