### XCV.

### SONG TO THE LITTLE WORLD.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN LVI.

THE beautiful I sang of, I will sing.  
The world one day more.  
Much I reason,  
And I meditate.  
I will address the bards of the world,  
Since it is not told me  
What supports the world,  
That it falls not into vacancy.  
Or if the world should fall,  
10 On what would it fall? <span id="page_542">p. 542</span>  
Who would uphold it?  
The world, how it comes again,  
When it falls in decay,  
Again in the enclosing circle.  
The world, how wonderful it is,  
That it falls not at once.  
The world, how peculiar it is,  
So great was it trampled on.  
Johannes, Mattheus,  
20 Lucas, and Marcus,  
They sustain the word  
Through the grace of the Spirit.
