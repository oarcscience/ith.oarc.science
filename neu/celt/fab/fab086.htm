<P>A DREAM I happen to see last night; clever is he that can interpret it.<BR>
It shall not be related to the wanton; he that will not conceal it shall know it not.<BR>
It is an act of the gentle to govern the multitude. Pleasure is not the wealth of a country.<BR>
Have I not been under the same covering with a fair maid of the hue of the billow of the strand?<BR>
Labour bestowed on anything good is no pain, and the remembrance of it will last.<BR>
Worse is my trouble to answer him who is not acquainted with it.<BR>
It is no reparation for an evil deed, a desistence after it is done.<BR>
One's benefit does not appear when it is asked for in a round about way: thou hadst better keep to what there is. <A NAME="page_498"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 498</FONT></A><BR>
And associate with the virtuous, and be resolute as to what may happen.<BR>
10 He that frequently commits crime will at last be caught.<BR>
He that will not relate a thing fully, will not find himself contradicted.<BR>
Riches will not flourish with the wicked. Mass will not be sung on a retreat.<BR>
A sigh is no protection against the vile. He that is not liberal does not deserve the name.<BR>
