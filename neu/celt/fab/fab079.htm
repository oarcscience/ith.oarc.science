<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P>I. I have come to thee to tell<BR>
Of the jurisdiction I have in the North;<BR>
The beauty of every region has been described to me.</P>
<P>II. Since the action of Ardderyd and Erydon,<BR>
Gwendydd, and all that will happen to me,<BR>
Dull of understanding, to what place of festivity shall I go?</P>
<P>III. I will address my twin-brother<BR>
Myrdin, a wise man and a diviner,<BR>
Since he is accustomed to make disclosures<BR>
When a maid goes to him.</P>
<P>IV. I shall become the simpleton's song:<BR>
It is the ominous belief of the Cymry. The gale intimates<BR>
That the standard of Rydderch Hael is unobstructed.</P>
<P>V. Though Rydderch has the pre-eminence,<BR>
And all the Cymry under him,<BR>
Yet, after him, who will come?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_463"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 463</FONT></A></P>
<P>VI. Rydderch Hael, the feller of the foe,<BR>
Dealt his stabs among them,<BR>
In the day of bliss at the ford of Tawy.</P>
<P>VII. Rydderch Hael, while he is the enemy<BR>
Of the city of the bards in the region of the Clyd;<BR>
Where will he go to the ford?</P>
<P>VIII. I will tell it to Gwendydd.<BR>
Since she has addressed me skilfully,<BR>
The day after to-morrow Rydderch Hael will not be.</P>
<P>IX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
The intrepid in battle,<BR>
After Rydderch who will be?</P>
<P>X. As Gwenddoleu was slain in the blood-spilling of Ardderyd,<BR>
And I have come from among the furze,<BR>
Morgant Mawr, the son of Sadyrnin.</P>
<P>XI. I will ask my far-famed brother,<BR>
The fosterer of song among the streams,<BR>
Who will rule after Morgant?</P>
<P>XII. As Gwenddoleu was slain in the bloodshed of Ardderyd,<BR>
And I wonder why I should be perceived,<BR>
The cry of the country to Urien.</P>
<P>XIII, Thy head is of the colour of winter boar;<BR>
God has relieved thy necessities<BR>
Who will rule after Urien?</P>
<P>XIV. Heaven has brought a heavy affliction<BR>
On me, and I am ill at last,<BR>
Maelgwn Hir over the land of Gwynedd.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_464"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 464</FONT></A></P>
<P>XV. From parting with my brother pines away<BR>
My heart, poor is my aspect along my furrowed cheek;<BR>
Now, after Maelgwn, who will rule?</P>
<P>XVI. Run is his name impetuous in the gushing conflict;<BR>
And fighting in the van of the army,<BR>
The woe of Prydein of the day!</P>
<P>XVII. Since thou art a companion and canon<BR>
Of Cunllaith, which with great expense we support,<BR>
To whom will Gwynedd go after Run?</P>
<P>XVIII. Run his name, renowned in war;<BR>
What I predict will surely come to pass,<BR>
Gwendydd, the country will be in the hand of Beli.</P>
<P>XIX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in difficulties,<BR>
Who will rule after Beli?</P>
<P>XX. Since my reason is gone with ghosts of the mountain,<BR>
And I myself am pensive,<BR>
After Beli, his son Iago.</P>
<P>XXI. Since thy reason is gone with ghosts of the mountain,<BR>
And thou thyself art pensive,<BR>
Who will rule after Iago?</P>
<P>XXII. He that comes before me with a lofty mien,<BR>
Moving to the social banquet;<BR>
After Iago, his son Cadvan?</P>
<P>XXIII. The songs have fully predicted<BR>
That one of universal fame will come;<BR>
Who will rule after Cadvan?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_465"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 465</FONT></A></P>
<P>XXIV. The country of the brave Cadwallawn,<BR>
The four quarters of the world shall hear of it;<BR>
The heads of the Angles will fall to the ground,<BR>
And there will be a world to admire it.</P>
<P>XXV. Though I see thy cheek so direful,<BR>
It comes impulsively to my mind,<BR>
Who will rule after Cadwallawn?</P>
<P>XXVI. A tall man holding a conference,<BR>
And Prydein under one sceptre,<BR>
The best son of Cymro, Cadwaladyr.</P>
<P>XXVII. He that comes before me mildly,<BR>
His abilities, are they not worthless?<BR>
After Cadwaladyr, Idwal.</P>
<P>XXVIII. I will ask thee mildly,<BR>
Far-famed, and best of men on earth,<BR>
Who will rule after Idwal?</P>
<P>XXIX. There will rule after Idwal,<BR>
In consequence of a dauntless one being called forth,<BR>
White-shielded Howel, the son of Cadwal.</P>
<P>XXX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
The intrepid in war,<BR>
Who will rule after Howel?</P>
<P>XXXI. I will tell his illustrious fame,<BR>
Gwendydd, before I part from thee;<BR>
After Howel, Rodri.</P>
<P>XXXII. Cynan in Mona will be,<BR>
He will not preserve his rights;<A NAME="page_466"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 466</FONT></A><BR>
And before the son of Rodri may be called,<BR>
The son of Cealedigan will be.</P>
<P>XXXIII. I will ask on account of the world,<BR>
And answer thou me gently;<BR>
Who will rule after Cynan?</P>
<P>XXXIV. Since Gwenddoleu was slain in the bloodshed of<BR>
Ardderyd, thou art filled with dismay;<BR>
Mervyn Vrych from the region of Manaw.</P>
<P>XXXV. I will ask my brother renowned in fame,<BR>
Lucid his song, and he the best of men,<BR>
Who will rule after Mervyn?</P>
<P>XXXVI. I will declare, from no malevolence,<BR>
The oppression of. Prydein, but from concern;<BR>
After Mervyn, Rodri Mawr.</P>
<P>XXXVII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in the day of the war-shout;<BR>
Who will rule after the son of Rodri Mawr?</P>
<P>XXXVIII. On the banks of the Conwy in the conflict of Wednesday,<BR>
Admired will be the eloquence<BR>
Of the hoary sovereign Anarawd.</P>
<P>XXXIX. I will address my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in the day of mockery,<BR>
Who will rule after Anarawd?</P>
<P>XL. The next is nearer to the time<BR>
Of unseen messengers;<BR>
The sovereignty in the band of Howel.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_467"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 467</FONT></A></P>
<P>XLI. The Borderers have not been,<BR>
And will not be nearer to Paradise.<BR>
An order from a kiln is no worse than from a church.</P>
<P>XLII. I will ask my beloved brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen celebrated in fame,<BR>
Who will rule after the Borderers?</P>
<P>XLIII. A year and a half to loquacious<BR>
Barons, whose lives shall be shortened;<BR>
Every careless one will be disparaged.</P>
<P>XLIV. Since thou art a companion and canon of Cunllaith,<BR>
The mercy of God to thy soul!<BR>
Who will rule after the Barons?</P>
<P>XLV. A single person will arise from obscurity,<BR>
Who will not preserve his countenance;<BR>
Cynan of the dogs will possess Cymry.</P>
<P>XLVI. I will ask thee on account of the world,<BR>
Answer thou me gently,<BR>
Who will rule after Cynan?</P>
<P>XLVII. A man from a distant foreign country;<BR>
They will batter impregnable Caers<BR>
They say a king from a baron.</P>
<P>XLVIII. I will ask on account of the world,<BR>
Since thou knowest the meaning;<BR>
Who will rule after the Baron?</P>
<P>XLIX. I will foretell of Serven Wyn,<BR>
A constant white-shielded messenger,<BR>
Brave, and strong like a white encircled prison; <A NAME="page_468"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 468</FONT></A><BR>
He will traverse the Countries of treacherous sovereigns;<BR>
And they will tremble before him as far as Prydein.</P>
<P>L. I will ask my blessed brother,<BR>
For it is I that is inquiring it,<BR>
Who will rule after Serven Wyn?</P>
<P>LI. Two white-shielded Belis<BR>
Will then come and cause tumult;<BR>
Golden peace will not be.</P>
<P>LII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid among the Cymry,<BR>
Who will rule after the two white-shielded Belis?</P>
<P>LIII. A. single passionate one with a beneficent mien,<BR>
Counselling a battle of defence;<BR>
Who will rule before the extermination?</P>
<P>LIV. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in the battle,<BR>
Who is the single passionate one<BR>
That thou predictest then?<BR>
What his name? what is he? when will he come?</P>
<P>LV. Gruffyd his name, vehement and handsome:<BR>
It is natural that he should throw lustre on his kindred;<BR>
He will rule over the land of Prydein.</P>
<P>LVI. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in battles,<BR>
Who shall possess it after Gruffyd?</P>
<P>LVII. I will declare from no malevolence,<BR>
The oppression of Prydein, but from concern;<BR>
After Gruffyd, Gwyn Gwarther.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_469"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 469</FONT></A></P>
<P>LVIII. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
The intrepid in war,<BR>
Who will rule after Gwyn Gwarther?</P>
<P>LIX. Alas! fair Gwendydd, great is the prognostication of the oracle,<BR>
And the tales of the Sybil;<BR>
Of an odious stock will be the two Idases;<BR>
For land they will be admired; from their jurisdiction, long animosity.</P>
<P>LX. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in the battles,<BR>
Who will rule after them?</P>
<P>LXI. I will predict that no youth will venture;<BR>
A king, a lion with unflinching hand,<BR>
Gylvin Gevel with a wolf's grasp.</P>
<P>LXII. I will ask my profound brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<BR>
After that who will be sovereign?</P>
<P>LXIII. To the multiplicity of the number of the stars<BR>
Will his retinue be compared;<BR>
He is Mackwy Dau Hanner.</P>
<P>LXIV. I will ask my unprotected brother,<BR>
The key of difficulty, the benefit of a lord--<BR>
Who will rule after Dan Hanner?</P>
<P>LXV. There will be a mixture of the Gwyddelian tongue in the battle,<BR>
With the Cymro, and a fierce conflict;<BR>
He is the lord of eight chief Caers.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_470"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 470</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXVI. I will ask my pensive brother,<BR>
Who has read the book of Cado,<BR>
Who will rule after him?</P>
<P>LXVII. I say that he is from Reged,<BR>
Since I am solemnly addressed;<BR>
The whelp of the illustrious Henri,<BR>
Never in his age will there be deliverance.</P>
<P>LXVIII. I will ask my brother renowned in fame,<BR>
Undaunted among the Cymry,<BR>
Who will rule after the son of Henri?</P>
<P>LXIX. When there will be a bridge on the Tav, and another on the Tywi,<BR>
Confusion will come upon Lloegyr,<BR>
And I will predict after the son of Henri,<BR>
Such and such a king and troublous times will be.</P>
<P>LXX. I will ask my blessed brother,<BR>
For it is I that is inquiring,<BR>
Who will rule after such and such a king?</P>
<P>LXXI. A silly king will come,<BR>
And the men of Lloegyr will deceive him;<BR>
There will be no prosperity of country under him.</P>
<P>LXXII. Myrdin fair, of fame-conferring song,<BR>
Wrathful in the world,<BR>
What will be in the age of the foolish one?</P>
<P>LXXIII. When Lloegyr will be groaning,<BR>
And Cymir full of malignity,<BR>
An army will be moving to and fro.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_471"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 471</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXXIV. Myrdin fair, gifted in speech,<BR>
Tell me no falsehood;<BR>
What will be after the army?</P>
<P>LXXV. There will arise one out of the six<BR>
That have long been in concealment;<BR>
Over Lloegyr he will have the mastery.</P>
<P>LXXVI. Myrdin fair, of fame-conferring stock,<BR>
Let the wind turn inside the house,<BR>
Who will rule after that?</P>
<P>LXXVII. It is established that Owein should come,<BR>
And conquer as far as London,<BR>
To give the Cymry glad tidings.</P>
<P>LXXVIII. Myrdin fair, most gifted and most famed,<BR>
For thy word I will believe,<BR>
Owein, how long will he continue?</P>
<P>LXXIX. Gwendydd, listen to a rumour,<BR>
Let the wind turn in the valley,<BR>
Five years and two, as in time of yore.</P>
<P>LXXX. I will ask my profound brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<BR>
Who will thence be sovereign?</P>
<P>LXXXI. When Owein will be in Manaw,<BR>
And a battle in Prydyn close by,<BR>
There will be a man with men under him.</P>
<P>LXXXII. I will ask my profound brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<BR>
After that who will be sovereign?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_472"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 472</FONT></A></P>
<P>LXXXIII. A ruler of good breeding and good will he be,<BR>
Will conquer the land,<BR>
And the country will be happy with joy.</P>
<P>LXXXIV. I will ask my profound brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen tenderly nourished,<BR>
After that who will be sovereign?</P>
<P>LXXXV. Let there be a cry in the valley<BR>
Beli Hir and his men like the whirlwind;<BR>
Blessed be the Cymry, woe to the Gynt.</P>
<P>LXXXVI. I will ask my far-famed twin-brother,<BR>
Intrepid in battles,<BR>
After Beli who will be the possessor?</P>
<P>LXXXVII. Let there be a cry in the Aber,<BR>
Beli Hir and his numerous troops;<BR>
Blessed be the Cymry, woe to the Gwyddyl.</P>
<P>LXXXVIII. I will address my farfamed twin-brother<BR>
Intrepid in war;<BR>
Why woe to the Gwyddyl?</P>
<P>LXXXIX. I will predict that one prince will be<BR>
Of Gwynedd, after your affliction;<BR>
You will have a victory over every nation.</P>
<P>XC. The canon of Morvryn, how united to us<BR>
Was Myrdin Vrych with the powerful host,<BR>
What will happen until the wish be accomplished?</P>
<P>XCI. When Cadwaladyr will descend,<BR>
Having a large united host with him, <A NAME="page_473"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 473</FONT></A><BR>
On Wednesday to defend the men of Gwynedd,<BR>
Then will come the men of Caer Garawedd.</P>
<P>XCII. Do not separate abruptly from me,<BR>
From a dislike to the conference;<BR>
In what part will Cadwaladyr descend?</P>
<P>XCIII. When Cadwaladyr descends<BR>
Into the valley of the Tywi,<BR>
Hard pressed will be the Abers<BR>
And the Brython will disperse the Brithwyr.</P>
<P>XCIV. I will ask my profound brother,<BR>
Whom I have seen tenderly nourished;<BR>
Who will rule from thenceforth?</P>
<P>XCV. When a boor will know three languages<BR>
In Mona, and his son be of honourable descent,<BR>
Gwynedd will be heard to be abounding in riches.</P>
<P>XCVI. Who will drive Lloegyr from the borders<BR>
Of the sea, who will move upon Dyved?<BR>
And as to the Cymry, who will succour them?</P>
<P>XCVII. The far-extended rout and tumult of Rydderch,<BR>
And the armies of Cadwaladyr,<BR>
Above the river Tardennin,<BR>
Broke the key of men.</P>
<P>XCVIII. Do not separate abruptly from me,<BR>
From dislike to the conference,<BR>
What death will carry off Cadwaladyr?</P>
<P>XCIX. He will be pierced by a spear from the strong timber <A NAME="page_474"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 474</FONT></A><BR>
Of a ship, and a hand before the evening;<BR>
The day will be a disgrace to the Cymry.</P>
<P>C. Do not separate abruptly from me<BR>
From dislike to the conference,<BR>
How long will Cadwaladyr reign?</P>
<P>CI. Three months and three long years,<BR>
And full three hundred years<BR>
With occasional battles, he will rule.</P>
<P>CII. Do not separate abruptly from me<BR>
From dislike to the conference,<BR>
Who will rule after Cadwaladyr?</P>
<P>CIII. To Gwendydd I will declare;<BR>
Age after age I will predict;<BR>
After Cadwaladyr, Cynda.</P>
<P>CIV. A hand upon the sword, another upon the cross,<BR>
Let every one take care of his life;<BR>
With Cyndav there is no reconciliation.</P>
<P>CV. I will foretell that there will be one prince<BR>
Of Gwynedd, after your affliction,<BR>
You will overcome every nation.</P>
<P>CVI. And as to the tribe of the children of Adam,<BR>
Who have proceeded from his flesh,<BR>
Will their freedom extend to the judgment?</P>
<P>CVII. From the time the Cymry shall be without the aid<BR>
Of battle, and altogether without keeping their mien,<BR>
It will be impossible to say who will be ruler.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_475"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 475</FONT></A></P>
<P>CVIII. Gwendydd, the delicately fair,<BR>
The first will be the most puissant in Prydein;<BR>
Lament, ye wretched Cymry!</P>
<P>CIX. When extermination becomes the highest duty,<BR>
From the sea to the shoreless land,<BR>
Say, lady, that the world is at an end.</P>
<P>CX. And after extermination becomes the highest duty,<BR>
Who will there be to keep order?<BR>
Will there be a church, and a portion for a priest?</P>
<P>CXI. There will be no portion for priest nor minstrel,<BR>
Nor repairing to the altar,<BR>
Until the heaven falls to the earth.</P>
<P>CXII. My twin-brother, since thou hast answered me,<BR>
Myrdin, son of Morvryn the skilful,<BR>
Sad is the tale thou hast uttered.</P>
<P>CXIII. I will declare to Gwendydd,<BR>
For seriously hast thou inquired of me,<BR>
Extermination, lady, will be the end.</P>
<P>CXIV. What I have hitherto predicted<BR>
To Gwendydd, the idol of princes.<BR>
It will come to pass to the smallest tittle.</P>
<P>CXV. Twin-brother, since these things will happen to me,<BR>
Even for the souls of thy brethren,<BR>
What sovereign after him will be?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_476"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 476</FONT></A></P>
<P>CXVI. Gwendydd fair, the chief of courtesy,<BR>
I will seriously declare,<BR>
That never shall be a sovereign afterwards.</P>
<P>CXVII. Alas I thou dearest, for the cold separation,<BR>
After the coming of tumult,<BR>
That by a sovereign brave and fearless<BR>
Thou shouldst be placed under earth.</P>
<P>CXVIII. The air of heaven will scatter<BR>
Rash resolution, which deceives, if believed:<BR>
Prosperity until the judgment is certain.</P>
<P>CXIX. By thy dissolution, thou tenderly nourished,<BR>
Am I not left cheerless?<BR>
A delay will be good destiny when will be given<BR>
Praise to him who tells the truth.</P>
<P>CXX. From thy retreat arise, and unfold<BR>
The books of Awen without fear;<BR>
And the discourse of a maid, and the repose of a dream.</P>
<P>CXXI. Dead is Morgeneu, dead Cyvrennin<BR>
Moryal. Dead is Moryen, the bulwark of battle;<BR>
The heaviest grief is, Myrdin, for thy destiny.</P>
<P>CXXII. The Creator has caused me heavy affliction;<BR>
Dead is Morgeneu, dead is Mordav,<BR>
Dead is Moryen, I wish to die.</P>
<P>CXXIII. My only brother, chide me not;<BR>
Since the battle of Ardderyd I am ill; <A NAME="page_477"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 477</FONT></A><BR>
It is instruction that I seek;<BR>
To God I commend thee.</P>
<P>CXXIV. I, also, commend thee,<BR>
To the, Chief of all creatures<BR>
Gwendydd fair, the refuge of songs.</P>
<P>CXXV. The songs too long have tarried<BR>
Concerning universal fame to come;<BR>
Would to God they had come to pass!</P>
<P>CXXVI. Gwendydd, be not dissatisfied;<BR>
Has not the burden been consigned to the earth?<BR>
Every one must give up what he loves.</P>
<P>CXXVII. While I live, I will not forsake thee,<BR>
And until the judgment will bear thee in mind;<BR>
Thy entrenchment is the heaviest calamity.</P>
<P>CXXVIII. Swift is the steed, and free the wind;<BR>
I will commend my blameless brother<BR>
To God, the supreme Ruler;<BR>
Partake of the communion before thy death.</P>
<P>CXXIX. I will not receive the communion<BR>
From excommunicated monks,<BR>
With their cloaks on their hips;<BR>
May God himself give me communion!</P>
<P>CXXX. I will commend my blameless<BR>
Brother in the supreme Caer;<BR>
May God take care of Myrdin!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_478"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 478</FONT></A></P>
<P>CXXXI. I, too, will commend my blameless<BR>
Sister in the supreme Caer;--<BR>
May God take care of Gwendydd. Amen!</P>
