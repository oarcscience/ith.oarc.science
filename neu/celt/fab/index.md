This is William Skene's anthology of dark-age Welsh Bardic poetry. Often
cited, but difficult to obtain, this book contains every remaining piece
of Bardic poetry known. The poems are translated from four manuscripts:
the Black Book of Caermarthen, the Red Book of Hergest (which is also
the source of the [Mabinogion](../mab/index).md), the Book of Taliessin and
the Book of Aneurin, all of which date from the twelfth to the fifteenth
centuries C.E. The poems themselves date from much earlier, probably
from the sixth century by internal evidence.

This corpus is one of the treasures of world literature. It is also the
only true source material for the study of Bardic lore, which reputedly
preserved the esoteric (and long-lost) beliefs of the Druids. Largely
written to satisfy wealthy patrons, much of the subject matter is
related to mead-inspired battles, particularly the renowned Gododin
cycle. However, the poetry rises above the gory combat and toadying to
achieve an artistic height that would not be reached for many centuries.
Some of the later works, which use Christian themes as a jumping-off
point, have an almost haiku-like quality. The poems are infused
throughout with mystic clarity, strange flashes of wisdom, and insight
into humanity and nature.

This book is very rare, and only available for purchase today in a
print-on-demand edition. This etext, produced at Intangible Textual
Heritage, is the first comprehensive posting of this fascinating
material on the Internet.
