<P>I. I WILL extol Thee, the Trinity in the mysterious One,<BR>
Who is One and Three, a Unity of one energy,<BR>
Of the same essence and attributes, one God to be praised.<BR>
I will praise Thee, great Father, whose mighty works are great;<BR>
To praise Thee is just; to praise Thee is incumbent on me,<BR>
The produce of poetry is the right of Eloi.<BR>
Hail, glorious Christ!<BR>
Father, and Son, and Spirit! Lord,<BR>
God, Adonai!</P>
<P>II. I will extol God, who is both One and Two,<BR>
Who is Three without any error, without its being easily doubted;<BR>
Who made fruit, and rill, and every gushing stream;<BR>
God is his name, being two Divine Ones to be comprehended;<BR>
God is his name, being three Divine Ones in his energy;<BR>
God is his name, being One; the God of Paul and Anhun.</P>
<P>III. I will extol One, who is both Two and One.<BR>
Who is, besides, Three, who is God Himself,<BR>
Who made Mars and Luna, and male and female,<BR>
And ordained that the shallow and the abyss should not be of equal depth;<BR>
Who made heat and cold, and sun and moon,<BR>
And letters in the wax, and flame in the candle,<BR>
And affection to be one of the senses, and lovely woman late,<BR>
And caused the burning of five Caers, and an erring consort.</P>
