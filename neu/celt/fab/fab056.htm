<P>IN one year<BR>
One that provides<BR>
Wine and bounty and mead,<BR>
And manliness without enmity,<BR>
And a musician excelling,<BR>
With a swarm of spears about him.<BR>
With ribbands at their heads,<BR>
And their fair appearances.<BR>
Every one went from his presence,<BR>
10 They came into the conflict,<BR>
And his horse under him.<BR>
Purposing the affair of Mynaw.<BR>
And more harmony,<BR>
Advantage flowing about his hand.<BR>
Eight score of one colour<BR>
Of calves and cows.<BR>
Milch cows and oxen.<BR>
And every fair need.<BR>
I should not be joyful<BR>
20 If Urien were slain.<BR>
He is dear before he went.<BR>
A Saxon shivering, trembling,<BR>
With hair white-washed,<BR>
And a bier his destiny,<BR>
With a bloody face.<BR>
For the blood of men a little protected. <A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A><BR>
And a man of the intrenchment persevering,<BR>
Whose wife is a widow.<BR>
Mine is the wine of the prince,<BR>
30 Mine is the wine of frequent parties,<BR>
My chance, my aid, my head.<BR>
Since the rising up will not cause<BR>
A striking fronting one another.<BR>
Porter, listen.<BR>
What is the noise: is it the earth that quakes?<BR>
Or is it the sea that swells?<BR>
Whitened, clinging together, against the infantry.<BR>
If there is a cry on the hill,<BR>
Is it not Urien that terrifies?<BR>
40 If there is a cry in the valley,<BR>
Is it not Urien that pierces?<BR>
If there is a cry in the mountain,<BR>
Is it not Urien that conquers?<BR>
If there is a cry on the slope,<BR>
Is it not Urien that wounds?<BR>
If there is a sigh on the dyke,<BR>
Is it not Urien that is active?<BR>
A cry of a journey over the plain,<BR>
A cry in every meandering vale.<BR>
50 Nor will one sneeze or two<BR>
Protect from death.<BR>
He would not be on famine<BR>
With spoils surrounding him.<BR>
Over-querulous, trailing, of a blue tint.<BR>
Like death was his spear,<BR>
Killing his enemy.<BR>
And until I fail in old age,<BR>
In the sore necessity of death,<BR>
May I not be smiling,<BR>
60 If I praise not Urien.</P>
