### LVII.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN L.

MAY God exalt over the community of Brython  
The sign of gladness of a host from Mona,  
There is a contention among the active patriots of Gwynedd.  
Of bright radiancy, from every battle to have pledges,.  
Powys will become grave in embraces.  
Men, great-craving, will act on their laws.  
Two hosts will go, they will be consonant.  
Of one disposition, of one word, harmonious, compact.  
They will divide justly the people of Ceredigiawn.  
10 When thou seest men few about Llyn Aeron.  
When will be heavy Tywi and Teivi rivers,  
They will make battle in haste about Llys Llonion. <span

What he saw he left over-laden.  
He protected not cities from indignations.  
A man warm, a man that guards, a man of impulse.  
He was not an utterly clownish man, Rieddon.  
When Cadwallawn came  
Over the ocean of Iwerdon,  
He regulated heaven as high creator.  
20 Songsters, soon may I hear their cares,  
An army of horsemen so harassing about Caer Llion,  
And the revenge of Idwal on Aranwynyon,  
And playing at ball with heads of Saxons.  
There will be troubled the Cat Vreith and its strange language,  
From the ford at Taradyr, as far as Porth Wygyr in Mona.  
A youth brought them to Dinas Maon.  
From the time when is defended the honey and clover  
They leave their noise and contention,  
30 Not unpledged to raise anger against enemies.  
May God exalt over the community of Brython.
