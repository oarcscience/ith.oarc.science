### XXIII.

### BLACK BOOK OF CAERMARTHEN XXXVIII.

I. SEITHENHIN, stand thou forth,  
And behold the billowy rows;  
The sea has covered the plain of Gwydneu.

II\. Accursed be the damsel,  
Who, after the wailing,  
Let loose the Fountain of Venus, the raging deep.

III\. Accursed be the maiden,  
Who, after the conflict, let loose  
The fountain of Venus, the desolating sea.

IV\. A great cry from the roaring sea arises above the summit of the
rampart,  
To-day even to God does the supplication come!  
Common after excess there ensues restraint.

V. A cry from the roaring sea overpowers me this night,  
And it is not easy to relieve me;  
Common after excess succeeds adversity.

VI\. A cry from the roaring sea comes upon the winds  
The mighty and beneficent God has caused it!  
Common after excess is want.

VII\. A cry from the roaring sea  
Impels me from my resting-place this night;  
Common after excess is far-extending destruction.

VIII\. The grave of Seithenhin the weak-minded  
Between Caer Cenedir and the shore  
Of the great sea and Cinran.
