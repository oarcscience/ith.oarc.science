### XLVII.

### THE AFFAIR OF ARGOED LLWYFAIN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXXV.

IN the morning of Saturday there was a great battle,  
From when the sun rose until it gained its height.  
Flamdwyn hastened in four hosts  
Godeu and Reged to overwhelm.  
They extended from Argoed to Arvynyd.  
They retained not life during one day.  
Flamdwyn called out again, of great impetuosity,  
Will they give hostages? are they ready?  
Owen answered, Let the gashing appear,  
10 They will not give, they are not, they are not ready.  
And Ceneu, son of Coel, would be an irritated lion  
Before he would give a hostage to any one. <span id="page_366">p.

Urien called out again, the lord of the cultivated region,  
If there be a meeting for kindred,  
Let us raise a banner above the mountain,  
And advance our persons over the border.  
And let us raise our spears over the heads of men,  
And rush upon Flamdwyn in his army,  
And slaughter with him and his followers.  
20 And because of the affair of Argoed Llwyfain,  
There was many a corpse.  
The ravens were red from the warring of men.  
And the common people hurried with the tidings.  
And I will divine the year that I am not increasing.  
And until I fail in old age,  
In the sore necessity of death,  
May I not be smiling,  
If I praise not Urien.
