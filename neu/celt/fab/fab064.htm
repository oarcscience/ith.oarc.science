<P>I. How sad with me, how sad!<BR>
Have Cedwyv and Cadvan perished?<BR>
Glaring and tumultuous was the slaughter;<BR>
Perforated was the shield from Trywruyd.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</P>
<P>II. It was Maelgwn that I saw combating,<BR>
His household before the tumult of the host is not silent.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MYRDIN.</P>
<P>III. Before two men in Nevtur will they land,<BR>
Before Errith and Gurrith on a pale white horse.<BR>
The slender bay they will undoubtedly bear away.<BR>
Soon will his retinue be seen with Elgan.<BR>
Alas for his death! a great journey they came.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</P>
<P>IV. Rys, the one-toothed, a span was his shield;<BR>
Even to thee has complete prosperity come.<BR>
Cyndur has been slain; beyond measure they deplore;<BR>
Men that were generous while they lived have been slain;<BR>
Three men of note, whose. esteem was great with Elgan.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">MYRDIN.</P>
<P>V. Through and through, in excess and excess they came,<BR>
From yonder and yonder there came to me Bran and Melgan;<BR>
Slay, in their last conflict, Diwel<BR>
The son of Erbin, and his men, they did.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</P>
<P>VI. The host of Maelgwn, it was fortunate that they came--<BR>
Slaughtering men of battle, penetrating the gory plain,<BR>
Even the action of Ardderyd, when there will be a crisis,<BR>
Continually for the hero they will prepare.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MYRDIN.</P>
<P>VII. A host of flying darts, reeking will be the gory plain;<BR>
A host of. warriors, vigorous and active will they be;<BR>
A host, when wounds will be given, a host, when flight will take place,<BR>
A host, when they will return to the combat.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</P>
<P>VIII. The seven sons of Eliffer, seven heroes when put to proof,<BR>
They will not avoid seven spears in their seven divisions.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MYRDIN.</P>
<P>IX. Seven blazing fires, seven opposing armies,<BR>
The seventh Cynvelyn in every foremost place.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TALIESSIN.</P>
<P>X. Seven thrusting spears, seven rivers-ful<BR>
Of the blood of chieftains will they fill.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_370"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 370</FONT></A></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">MYRDIN.</P>
<P>XI. Seven score generous ones have gone to the shades;<BR>
In the wood of Celyddon they came to their end.</P>
<P>Since I, Myrdin, am next after Taliessin,<BR>
Let my prediction become common.</P>
