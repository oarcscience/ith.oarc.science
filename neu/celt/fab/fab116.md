## POEMS RELATING TO JEWISH HISTORY.

### CI.

### THE PLAGUES OF EGYPT.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXII.

THE Hebrews took upon the sons of Israel,  
High in mind,  
A joint number in succession.  
They approached.  
God kept vengeance  
On the people of Pharaonus.  
Ten plagues paining  
Before their being drowned  
In the bottomless sea.  
10 The first plague, fish destroying  
With unusual cold.  
The second plague, frogs abundant,  
They filled the rivers,  
The houses and furniture,  
And couches,  
And closets of meat.  
The third, gnats,  
Bold and sharp, were arranged.  
The fourth, a: sharp watery humour  
90 Strikes in the manner of winged insects.  
Next were devoured  
The fruits of the trees and the field  
By a crop of flies. <span id="page_560">p. 560</span>  
The fifth, murrain.  
On all the children  
Of the Egyptians,  
Animals were destroyed.  
With a heavy disease  
They were all smitten.  
30 The sixth, without deceit,  
Sweating imposthumes,  
The scars of ants.  
The seventh, thunder,  
Hail and fire,  
And rain destructive.  
Wind blasting the tops,  
On leaves and shrubs.  
The eighth, locusts,  
Broad their ears,  
40 Devouring flowers.  
The ninth, prodigious  
To be spoken of, terrible,  
Like waves floating  
Black darkness.  
With a countenance gloomy.  
Tenth, in the night  
The greatest affliction  
On the People of the tribes,  
Christ Jesus, Christians, are prostrate  
50 Until they are in shelter.  
The six hundred warriors  
Of the Hebrew soldiers.
