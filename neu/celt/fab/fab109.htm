<P>I WILL adore my Father,<BR>
My God, my strengthener,<BR>
Who infused through my head<BR>
A soul to direct me.<BR>
Who has made for me in perception,<BR>
My seven faculties.<BR>
Of fire and earth,<BR>
And water and air,<BR>
And mist and flowers,<BR>
10 And southerly wind. <A NAME="page_540"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 540</FONT></A><BR>
Other senses of perception<BR>
Thy father formed for me.<BR>
One is to have instinct<BR>
With the second I touch,<BR>
With the third I call,<BR>
With the fourth I taste,<BR>
With the fifth I see,<BR>
With the sixth I hear.<BR>
With the seventh I smell.<BR>
20 And I foresay,<BR>
Seven airs there are,<BR>
Above the astronomer,<BR>
And three parts the seas.<BR>
How they strike on all sides.<BR>
How great and wonderful,<BR>
The world, not of one form,<BR>
Did God make above,<BR>
On the planets.<BR>
He made Sola,<BR>
30 He made Luna,<BR>
He made Marca<BR>
And Marcarucia,<BR>
He made Venus,<BR>
He made Venerus,<BR>
He made Severus,<BR>
And the seventh Saturnus,<BR>
The good God made<BR>
Five zones of the earth,<BR>
For as long as it will last.<BR>
40 One is cold,<BR>
And the second is cold,<BR>
And the third is heat,<BR>
Disagreeable, unprofitable.<BR>
The fourth, paradise, <A NAME="page_541"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 541</FONT></A><BR>
The people will contain.<BR>
The fifth is the temperate,<BR>
And the gates of the universe.<BR>
Into three it is divided,<BR>
In the minstrelsy of perception.<BR>
50 One is Asia,<BR>
The second is Africa,<BR>
The third is Europa,<BR>
The baptism of consolation,<BR>
Until doomsday it will continue,<BR>
When everything will be judged.<BR>
My Awen has caused me<BR>
To praise my king.<BR>
I am Taliessin,<BR>
With a speed flowing as a diviner.<BR>
60 Continuing to the end<BR>
In the pattern of Elphin.</P>
