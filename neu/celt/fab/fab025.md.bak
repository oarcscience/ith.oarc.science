II\. Before Geraint, the unflinching foe,  
I saw horses jaded and gory from the battle,  
And after the shout, a terrible impulsion.

III\. Before Geraint, the enemy of tyranny,  
I saw horses white with foam,  
And after the shout, a terrible torrent.

IV\. In Llongborth I saw the rage of slaughter,  
And biers beyond all number,  
And red-stained men from the assault of Geraint.

V. In Llongborth I saw the edges of blades in contact,  
Men in terror, and blood on the pate,  
Before Geraint, the great son of his father.

VI\. In Llongborth I saw the spurs  
Of men who would not flinch from the dread of the spears,  
And the drinking of wine out of the bright glass.

VII\. In Llongborth I saw the weapons  
Of men, and blood fast dropping,  
And after the shout, a fearful return.

VIII\. In Llongborth I saw Arthur,  
And brave men who hewed down with steel,  
Emperor, and conductor of the toll.

IX\. In Llongborth Geraint was slain,  
A brave man from the region of Dyvnaint,  
And before they were overpowered, they committed slaughter.
