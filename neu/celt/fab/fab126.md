### CXI.

### RED BOOK OF HERGEST IX.

I. BRIGHT are the ash-tops; tall and white will they be  
When they grow in the upper part of the dingle;  
The languid heart, longing is her complaint.

II\. Bright is the top of the cliff at the long midnight hour;  
Every ingenious person will be honoured.  
It is the duty of the fair one to afford sleep to him in pain.

III\. Bright are the willow-tops; playful the fish  
In the lake; the wind whistles over the tops of the branches;  
Nature is superior to learning.

IV\. Bright the tops of the furze; have confidence  
In the wise; and to the unwise be repulsive;  
Except God, there is none that divines.

V. Bright the tops of the clover; the timid has no heart;  
Jealous ones weary themselves out;  
Usual is care upon the weak.

VI\. Bright the tops of reed-grass; furious is the jealous,  
And he can hardly be satisfied;  
It is the act of the wise to love with sincerity.

VII\. Bright the mountain-tops; from the bluster of winter,  
Withered and drooping is the tall grass;  
Against famine there is no bashfulness.

<span id="page_577">p. 577</span>

VIII\. Bright the mountain-tops; intruding is the cold of  
Winter; brittle are the reeds; rime is over the grave;  
Imprudence committed violence in banishment.

IX\. Bright the tops of the oak; bitter the ash-branches;  
Sweet the cow-parsnip, the wave keeps laughing;  
The cheek will not conceal the anguish of the heart.

X. Bright the tops of the dogrose; hardship has no formality;  
Let every one preserve his purity of life.  
The greatest blemish is ill-manners.

XI\. Bright the tops of the broom; let the lover make assignations;  
Very yellow are the clustered branches;  
Shallow ford; the contented is apt to enjoy sleep.

XII\. Bright the tops of the apple-tree; circumspect is  
Every prudent one, a chider of another;  
And after loving, indiscretion leaving it.

XIII\. Bright the tops of the apple-tree; circumspect is  
Every prudent one; in the long day a stagnant pool is malarious;  
Thick is the veil on the light of the blind prisoner.

XIV\. Bright the hazel-tops by the hill of Digoll;  
Unafflicted will be every squabby one;  
It is an act of the mighty to keep a treaty.

XV\. Bright the tops of reeds; it is usual for the sluggish  
To be heavy, and the young to be a learner;  
None but the foolish will break the faith.

<span id="page_578">p. 578</span>

XVI\. Bright the tops of the lily; let every bold one be a servitor;  
The word of a family will prevail;  
Usual with the faithless, a broken word.

XVII\. Bright the tops of the heath; usual is miscarriage  
To the timid; water will be intrusive in front of the shore;  
Usual with the faithful, an unbroken word.

XVIII\. Bright the tops of rushes; cows are profitable,  
Running are my tears this day;  
Comfort for the miserable there is not.

XIX\. Bright the tops of fern, yellow  
The charlock; how reproachless are the blind;  
How apt to run about are youngsters!

XX\. Bright the tops of the service-tree; accustomed to care,  
Is the aged one, and bees to the wilds  
Except God, there is no avenger.

XXI\. Bright the tops of the oak; incessant is the tempest;  
The bees are high; brittle the dry brushwood;  
Usual for the wanton to laugh excessively.

XXII\. Bright the tops of the grove; constantly the trees  
And the oak-leaves are falling;  
Happy is he who sees the one he loves.

XXIII\. Bright the tops of the oaks; coldly purls the stream;  
Let the cattle be fetched to the birch-enclosed area;  
Abruptly goes the arrow of the haughty to give pain.

<span id="page_579">p. 579</span>

XXIV\. Bright the tops of the hard holly, and others; let gold be
distributed;  
When all fall asleep on the rampart,  
God will not sleep when He gives deliverance.

XXV\. Bright the tops of the willows; inherently bold  
Will the war-horse be in the long day, when leaves are abounding;  
Those that have mutual friendship will not despise one another.

XXVI\. Bright the tops of rushes; prickly will they be  
When spread under the pillow;  
The wanton mind will be haughty.

XXVII\. Bright the tops of the hawthorn; confident is the sight of the
steed;  
It is usual for a lover to be a pursuer;  
May the diligent messenger do good.

XXVIII\. Bright the tops of cresses; warlike is the steed;  
Trees are fair ornaments for the ground;  
Joyful the soul with what it loves.

XXIX\. Bright is the top of the bush; valuable the steed;  
It is good to have discretion with strength;  
Let the unskilful be made powerless.

XXX\. Bright are the tops of the brakes; gay the plumage  
Of birds; the long day is the gift of the light;  
Mercifully has the most beneficent God made them.

<span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

XXXI\. Bright the tops of the meadow sweet; and music  
In the grove; bold the wind, the trees shake;  
Interceding with the obdurate will not avail.

XXXII\. Bright the tops of the elder-trees; bold is the solitary
songster;  
Accustomed is the violent to oppress;  
Woe to him who takes a reward from the hand.
