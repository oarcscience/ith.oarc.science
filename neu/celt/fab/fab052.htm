<P>I HAVE freely greeted, I will freely greet, the familiar greeter of<BR>
Urien Reged. May he diffuse his joy abroad!<BR>
Gold and silver, how great their consumption and destruction.<BR>
(Even) before they could come between the hands of the scatterer!<BR>
Ieuav caused loss and sorrow for horses daily;<BR>
Ceneu his brother, dilatory in the conflict, was not skilful;<BR>
Urien made retaliation for the dishonour<BR>
Of Cynin the active, ignominious was their execution.<BR>
About Aerven, all uncovered precipice, there will come an army.<BR>
10 Selev has been captured; he was incensed for what was to come.<BR>
It will fare worse with the free and the bond on their account,<BR>
Blades will be reddened, through proud words for the fruit of their trees.<BR>
The four men will maintain the place of four hundred,<BR>
With the deepest water. I would bless the corrupt in the enclosure on their account;<BR>
And whoever obtains it, may he be blessed for ever!<BR>
There will befall a loss from confiding in the claimant; <BR>
And hands without thumbs, and blades on the flesh, and a poor muster.<BR>
Puerile age will not be harmonious in the distraction.<BR>
There will be no fellowship, nor confidence in any toward others.<BR>
20 A dragon from Gwynedd of precipitous lands and gentle towns,<BR>
To the Lloegrians will go, when the report of him will spread abroad.<BR>
Stonework will be broken, with terrible destruction, in the encounter;<BR>
And more will be lost than spared of the Gwyndodians.<BR>
From mutual counselling, there will be means of deliverance by sea and land.<BR>
There will arise from concealment a man that will be a blessing to the Gwyndodians;<BR>
And the Brythyon, though a remnant, will be victorious over the ungentle multitude.<BR>
There will come a time when song will not be cherished, nor will it be elaborate;<BR>
The ruler will love wealth, and one sister will be bearish to another.<BR>
Killing and drowning from Eleri as far as Chwilvynydd,<BR>
30 A conquering and unmerciful one will triumph;<BR>
Small will be his army in returning from the (action of) Wednesday.<BR>
A bear from the south, will arise, meet<BR>
The Lloegrians, and kill vast numbers of Powysians.<BR>
The affair of Cors Vochno, he that will escape from it will be fortunate;<BR>
There will be twelve women, and no wonder, for one man.<BR>
The age of youth will fare unbecomingly worse;<BR>
After the tumultuous extermination, a bearded man in a hundred will not be a warrior. <A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A><BR>
Urien of Reged, generous he is, and will be,<BR>
And has been since Adam.<BR>
40 He, proud in the hall, has the most wide-spreading sword<BR>
Among the thirteen kings of the North.<BR>
Do I know his name--Aneurin the poet with the flowing song,<BR>
I being Taliesin, from the borders of the lake of Geirionnyidd?<BR>
May I not, when old,<BR>
Support my sore necessity,<BR>
If I praise not Urien. Amen.</P>
