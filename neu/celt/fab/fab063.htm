<P>THE soul of Owain son of Urien. May its Lord consider its need.<BR>
The chief of Reged, the heavy sward conceals him. His knowledge was not shallow.<BR>
A low cell (contains) the renowned protector of bards, the wings of dawn were the flowing of his lances.<BR>
For there will not be found a match for the chief of the glittering west.<BR>
The reaper of the tenacious foes. The offspring of his father and grandfather.<BR>
When Flamdwyn killed Owain, there was not one greater than he sleeping. <A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A><BR>
A wide number of Lloegyr went to sleep with light in their eyes.<BR>
And those that fled not instantly were beyond necessity.<BR>
Owain valiantly chastised them, like a pack (of wolves) pursuing sheep.<BR>
10 A worthy man, upon his many-coloured trappings, he would give horses to those that asked.<BR>
While he hoarded hard money, it was not shared for his soul.<BR>
The soul of Owain, son of Urien.</P>
