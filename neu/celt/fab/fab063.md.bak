### XLVIII.

### THE DEATH-SONG OF OWAIN.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XLIV.

Text, vol. ii. p. 199. Notes, vol. ii. p. 417.

THE soul of Owain son of Urien. May its Lord consider its need.  
The chief of Reged, the heavy sward conceals him. His knowledge was not
shallow.  
A low cell (contains) the renowned protector of bards, the wings of dawn
were the flowing of his lances.  
For there will not be found a match for the chief of the glittering
west.  
The reaper of the tenacious foes. The offspring of his father and
grandfather.  
When Flamdwyn killed Owain, there was not one greater than he sleeping.
<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>  
A wide number of Lloegyr went to sleep with light in their eyes.  
And those that fled not instantly were beyond necessity.  
Owain valiantly chastised them, like a pack (of wolves) pursuing
sheep.  
10 A worthy man, upon his many-coloured trappings, he would give horses
to those that asked.  
While he hoarded hard money, it was not shared for his soul.  
The soul of Owain, son of Urien.
