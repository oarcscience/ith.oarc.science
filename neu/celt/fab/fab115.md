### C.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN XXVII.

ON the face of the earth his equal was not born,  
Three persons of God, one Son gentle, strong Trinity.  
Son of the Godhead, Son of the Manhood, one son wonderful.  
Son of God, a fortress, Son of the blessed Mary, a good son to see.
<span id="page_558">p. 558</span>  
Great his destiny, great God supreme, a glorious portion.  
Of the race of Adam, and Abraham he was born.  
Of the race of the Lord, a portion of the eloquent host, was he born.  
He brought by a word the blind and deaf from every ailment.  
A people gluttonous, vain, iniquitous, vile, perverse,  
10 We have risen against the Trinity, after redemption,  
The Cross of Christ clearly, a breastplate gleaming against every
ailment.  
Against every hardship may it be certainly a city of protection.
