### CIV.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN LI.

THE eternal Trinity  
Made the element, <span id="page_565">p. 565</span>  
And after the element,  
Adam wonderfully.  
And after Adam,  
Well he made Eva.  
The blessed Israel  
The mighty Spirit made.  
Ardent the suggestion,  
10 Clear the reasoning.  
Twelve towns of Israel, rising equally high,  
Twelve sons of Israel, the generous God made.  
Twelve sons of Israel were nursed together.  
Twelve good, blameless, three mothers nursed them.  
One person created them, the Creator made them.  
As he will do as he pleases, who is supreme.  
Twelve sons of Israel made the love-diffuser.  
As he will do as he pleases, who is Lord.  
Twelve sons of Israel made the Lord.  
20 As he will do as he pleases, who is skilful.  
Twelve-sons of Israel bore reward  
Of the mission of Jesus.  
And one father there was to them.  
And three mothers to them.  
From them came grace  
And good offspring.  
And Mary, good, created,  
And Christ, my strengthener,  
Lord of every fair country,  
30 And I will call on and sing to thee every day;  
For has been my desire  
Friendship with thee.
