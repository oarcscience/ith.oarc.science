<P>I WILL adore the Ruler, chief of every place,<BR>
Him, that supports the heaven: Lord of everything.<BR>
Him, that made the water for every one good,<BR>
Him, that made every gift, and prospers it.<BR>
May Maelgwn of Mona be affected with mead, and affect us, <A NAME="page_539"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 539</FONT></A><BR>
From the foaming mead-horns, with the choicest pure liquor,<BR>
Which the bees collect, and do not enjoy.<BR>
Mead distilled sparkling, its praise is everywhere.<BR>
The multitude of creatures which the earth nourishes,<BR>
10 God made for man to enrich him.<BR>
Some fierce, some mute, he enjoys them.<BR>
Some wild, some tame, the Lord makes them.<BR>
Their coverings become clothing.<BR>
For food, for drink, till doom they will continue.<BR>
I will implore the Ruler, sovereign of the country of peace,<BR>
To liberate Elphin from banishment.<BR>
The man who gave me wine and ale and mead.<BR>
And the great princely steeds, beautiful their appearance,<BR>
May he yet give me bounty to the end.<BR>
20 By the will of God, he will give in honour,<BR>
Five five-hundred festivals in the way of peace.<BR>
Elphinian knight of mead, late be thy time of rest.</P>
