### LIII.

### BOOK OF ANEURIN IV.

HERE NOW BEGINNETH THE GORCHAN OF CYNVELYN.

WERE I to praise,  
Were I to sing,  
The Gwarchan would cause high shoots to spring,  
Stalks like the collar of Trych Trwyth,  
Monstrously savage, bursting and thrusting through,  
When he was attacked in the river  
Before his precious things.  
Carn Gaffon burst through,  
Before the cairns of Riwrhon,  
10 Those that delighted in war,  
Whose bones were short, their horsemen shorter.  
Gylvach burst through  
The assaults of heroism.  
Fury against the Angles is just;  
It is right to kill; it is right to crush those who are crushing.  
Before the congenial splendour  
There will be light for furthering the project,  
And ability to descend  
To every daring enterprise,  
20 Through nail, through snare,  
Through trapdoor, and fetters,  
And gold spread abroad;  
And deep sorrow will happen  
To Gwynassedd the yellow.  
His blood will be around him  
Concealed will be the froth <span id="page_413">p. 413</span>  
Of the splendid yellow mead;  
Again there will be blood around him  
Before the battles of Cynvelyn,--  
30 From the indignation of Cynvelyn,  
The uplifted pillar of wrath,  
Food-provider for the birds.  
With pendent stirrups  
Will the graceful ones return,  
Under the thigh of the heroes,  
As swift as sprites move  
On a pleasant lawn.  
Sovereign of the land of song!  
It is mine to lament him,  
40 Until I come to the silent day!  
The foe asked for  
A long-handled weapon!  
More powerful than the highly-honoured lays  
Is the Gwarchan of Cynvelyn.  
The Gorchan of Cynvelyn, to make the region weep.  
A man of fortitude from Gwynedd has departed his country!  
The brave are lamented;  
Let the Caer of Eiddin deplore  
The dread and illustrious men clothed in splendid blue.  
50 Brilliant is thy ruddy gem--is it not precious?  
Flowing panegyric is due to the horses  
Of Eithinyn--are they not splendid?  
The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn on Gododin!  
Has he not, for a man, performed a reasonable part?  
His heavy spear, adorned with gold, he bestowed on me;  
Be it for the benefit of his soul!  
His son Tegvan shall be honoured  
In numbering and in partitioning, the grandson of Cadvan,  
The pillar of ardency.  
60 When weapons were hurled <span id="page_414">p. 414</span>  
Over the heads of battle-wolves,  
Soon would he come in the day of distress.  
Three men and three score and three hundred  
To the conflict of Catraeth went forth;  
Of those who hastened  
From the mead of the cup-bearers, three only returned,--  
Cynon, and Cadreith, and Cadlew of Cadnant;  
And me, on account of my blood they deplored,  
Son of the omen pile, my ransom they contributed,  
70 Of pure gold, and steel, and silver.  
For their heroism they received no protection.  
The Gwarchan of Cynvelyn will celebrate their contribution.

HERE ENDETH THE GWARCHAN OF CYNVELYN.
