<P>I WILL adore the love-diffusing Lord of every kindred,<BR>
The sovereign of hosts manifestly round the universe.<BR>
A battle at the feast over joyless beverage,<BR>
A battle against the sons of Llyr in Ebyr Henvelen. <A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A><BR>
I saw the oppression of the tumult, and wrath and tribulation,<BR>
The blades gleamed on the glittering helmets,<BR>
A battle against the lord of fame, in the dales of the Severn,<BR>
Against Brochwel of Powys, that loved my Awen.<BR>
A battle in the pleasant course early against Urien,<BR>
10 There falls about our feet blood on destruction.<BR>
Shall not my chair be defended from the cauldron of Ceridwen?<BR>
May my tongue be free in the sanctuary of the praise of Gogyrwen.<BR>
The praise of Gogyrwen is an oblation, which has satisfied<BR>
Them, with milk, and dew, and acorns.<BR>
Let us consider deeply before is heard confession,<BR>
That is coming assuredly death nearer and nearer.<BR>
And round the lands of Enlli the Dyvi has poured,<BR>
Raising the ships on the surface of the plain.<BR>
And let us call upon him that hath made us,<BR>
20 That he may protect us from the wrath of the alien nation.<BR>
When the isle of Mona shall be called a pleasant field,<BR>
Happy they the mild ones, the affliction of the Saxons.<BR>
I came to Deganwy to contend<BR>
With Maelgwn, the greatest in delinquencies,<BR>
I liberated my lord in the presence of the distributor,<BR>
Elphin, the sovereign of greatly aspiring ones.<BR>
There are to me three chairs regular, accordant,<BR>
And until doom they will continue with the singers.<BR>
I have been in the battle of Godeu, with Lleu and Gwydion,<BR>
30 The changed the form of the elementary trees and sedges.<BR>
I have been with Bran in Iwerdon.<BR>
I saw when was killed Morddwydtyllon.<BR>
I heard a meeting about the minstrels,<BR>
With the Gwyddyl, devils, distillers. <A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A><BR>
From Penryn Wleth to Loch Reon<BR>
The Cymry are of one mind, bold heroes.<BR>
Deliver thou the Cymry in tribulation.<BR>
Three races, cruel from true disposition,<BR>
Gwyddyl, and Brython, and Romani,<BR>
40 Create discord and confusion.<BR>
And about the boundary of Prydain, beautiful its towns,<BR>
There is a battle against chiefs above the mead-vessels,<BR>
In the festivals of the Distributor, who bestowed gifts upon me.<BR>
The chief astrologers received wonderful gifts.<BR>
Complete is my chair in Caer Sidi,<BR>
No one will be afflicted with disease or old age that may be in it.<BR>
It is known to Manawyd and Pryderi.<BR>
Three utterances, around the fire, will he sing before it,<BR>
And around its borders are the streams of the ocean.<BR>
50 And the fruitful fountain is above it,<BR>
Is sweeter than white wine the liquor therein.<BR>
And when I shall have worshipped thee, Most High, before the sod<BR>
May I be found in covenant with thee.</P>
