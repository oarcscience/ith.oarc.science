### XCIX.

### BOOK OF TALIESSIN V.

O GOD, the God of formation,  
Ruler, strengthener of blood.  
Christ Jesus, that guards,  
Princes loud-proclaiming go their course.  
For a decaying acquisition.  
It will not make me without shares,  
The praising thy mercy.  
There hath not been here;  
O supreme Ruler;  
10 There hath not been; there will not be,  
One so good as the Lord.  
There hath not been born in the day of the people  
Any one equal to God.  
And no one will acknowledge  
Any one equal to him. <span id="page_553">p. 553</span>  
Above heaven, below heaven,  
There is no Ruler but he.  
Above sea, below sea,  
He created us.  
20 When God comes  
A great noise will pierce us,  
The day of judgment terribly.  
Messengers from the door,  
Wind, and sea, and fire.  
Lightning and thunder.  
A number without flattery.  
The people of the world groaning  
Will be concealed. A reaching arm will be brought.  
Will be concealed the sea and stars,  
30 When the Father descends,  
To take vengeance with his hosts  
With trumpets penetrating into the four regions.  
And to set the sea on fire.  
The nations of the world will be burnt,  
Until they are reduced to ashes.  
Was burnt the desert portion  
Before his great presence.  
He will draw a stream  
Before his front rank.  
O Kings will shudder (that) day,  
Woe awaits them!  
When the recompenser shall appear,  
Let the heaven appear below.  
A ruddy wind will be brought  
Out to the cinder,  
Until the world is as desolate  
As when created.  
Saint Peter says it,  
The day of the earth; <span id="page_554">p. 554</span>  
50 There will come a Saturday,  
The earth in one furnace.  
Saturday, a clear morning  
The love-diffusing (Lord) will separate us.  
The land of worldly weather,  
A wind will melt the trees:  
There will pass away every tranquillity  
When the mountains are burnt.  
There will be again inhabitants  
With horns before kings;  
60 The mighty One will send them,  
Sea, and land, and lake.  
There will be again a trembling terror,  
And a moving of the earth,  
And above every field,  
And ashes the rocks will be;  
With violent exertion, concealment,  
And burning of lake.  
A wave do ye displace,  
A shield do ye extend  
70 To the travelling woe,  
And violent exertion through grief.  
And inflaming through fury  
Between heaven and earth.  
When the Trinity shall come  
To the field of its majesty,  
The host of heaven about it,  
An extensive tribe near it,  
Songs and minstrels.  
And the hymns of angels,  
80 Will raise from the graves,  
They will entreat from the beginning  
They will entreat together publicly,  
On so great a destiny. <span id="page_555">p. 555</span>  
Those whom the sea has destroyed  
Will make a great shout,  
At the time when cometh  
He, that will separate them.  
As many as are mine,  
Let them go to the right.  
90 Those that have done evil,  
Lot them go to the left side.  
Do not thy passions counteract  
What thy lips utter?  
Thy going in thy course into valleys,  
Dark. without lights.  
And mine were his words.  
And mine were his languages.  
And mine was his bright country,  
And their hundred fulnesses.  
100 The hundredth country present.  
I have not been without battle.  
Bitter affliction was frequent  
Between me and my cousins.  
Frequent trials fell  
between me and my fellow-countrymen.  
There was frequent contention  
Between me and the wretched.  
This ever overcame me,  
Man would never do it.  
110 (Those) that placed me on the cross  
I knew when young.  
That drove me on the tree,  
My head hung down.  
Stretched were my two feet,  
So sad their destiny.  
Stretched with extreme pain  
The bones of my feet. <span id="page_556">p. 556</span>  
Stretched were my two arms,  
Their burden will not be.  
120 Stretched were my two shoulders,  
So diligently it was done.  
Stretched were the nails,  
Within my heart.  
Stretched was the spiking,  
Between my two eyes.  
Thick are the holes  
Of the crown of thorns in my head.  
The lance was struck  
And my side was pierced.  
130 It will be struck to you also,  
As your right hand (struck me).  
To you there will be no forgiveness,  
For piercing me with spears.  
And the Ruler we knew not  
When thou wert hung.  
Ruler of heaven, Ruler of every people!  
We knew not, O Christ! that it was thou.  
If we had known thee,  
Christ, we should have refrained from thee.  
140 A denial will not be received  
From the race of the lower country.  
Ye have committed wickedness  
Against the Creator.  
A hundred thousand angels  
Are to me witnesses,  
Who came to conduct me  
After my hanging,  
When hanging cruelly,  
Myself to deliver me  
150 In heaven there was trembling  
When I had been hung. <span id="page_557">p. 557</span>  
When I cried out Eli!  
God love-prospering above heaven.  
And sing ye, the two Johns,  
Before me the two primary parts.  
With two books in your hands,  
Reading them.  
There would not come a great difficulty  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
160 And yours will be flattery,  
The value of your foolish speech.  
Dissolution will close.  
Upon you to moist Uffern.  
Christ Jesus high hath founded three hundred thousand years,  
Since he is in life,  
And a second thousand before the cross  
Shone Enoch.  
Do not the brave know  
The greatness of their progeny?  
170 A country present will meet thee,  
And while it may possibly be yours,  
Three hundred thousand years save one,  
A short hour of the day of everlasting life.
