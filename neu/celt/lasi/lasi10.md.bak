# The King and the Bishop

### A Legend of Clonmacnoise

THERE are few things more pleasant to those who are doomed to pass the
greater part of their lives in the dust and din and, smoke of a city
than to get on the top of a stage-coach early some fine summer morning,
and whirl along through the yet unpeopled streets, echoing from their
emptiness to the rattle of the welcome wheels that are bearing you away
from your metropolitan prison, to the

"Free blue streams and the laughing sky"

of the sweet country. How gladly you pass the last bridge over one of
the canals I and then, deeming yourself fairly out of town, you look
back once only on its receding "groves of chimneys," and settling
yourself comfortably in your seat, you cast away care, and look forward
in gleeful anticipation of your three or four weeks in the 'tranquility
and freedom of a country ramble.

Such have my sensations often been - not a little increased, by-the-by,
as I hugged closer to my side my portfolio, well stored with paper, and
heard the rattle of my pencils and colours in the tin sketching box in
my pocket. Such were they when last I started one fresh and lovely
summer's morning, on the Ballinasloe coach, and promised myself a rich
treat In a visit to Clonmacnoise, or "the Churches," as the place is
familiarly called by the peasantry. Gladly I descended from my lofty
station on our dusty conveyance, when it arrived at Shannonbridge, and
engaging a boat, embarked on the noble river whence the village takes
its name, and proceded up the wide and winding stream to the still
sacred and once celebrated Clonmacnoise, the second monastic foundation
established in Ireland, once tenanted by the learned and the powerful,
now scarcely known but to the mendicant pilgrim, the learned antiquary,
or the vagrant lover of the picturesque.

Here, for days together, have I lingered, watching its noble,
"ivy-mantled" tower, reposing in shadow, or sparkling in sunshine, as it
spired upward in bold relief against the sky; or admiring the graceful
involutions of the ample Shannon that wound beneath the gentle acclivity
on which I stood, through the plashy meadows and the wide waste of bog,
whose rich brown tones of colour faded into blue on the horizon; or in
noting the red-tanned sail of some passing turf-boat, as it broke the
monotony of the quiet river, or in recording with my pencil the noble
stone cross, or the tracery of some mouldering ruin,

"Where ivied arch, or pillar Ione,  
Plead haughtily for glories gone,"

though I should not say "haughtily," for poor old Clonmacnoise pleads
with as much humility as the religion which reared her now does; and
which, like her, interesting in the attitude of decay, teaches and
appeals to our sympathies and our imagination, instead of taking the
strongholds of our reason by storm, and forcing our assent by
overwhelming batteries of irrefragable proof, before it seeks to win our
will by tender and impassioned appeals to the heart. But I wander from
Clonmacnoise. It is a truly solemn and lonely spot; I love it almost to
a folly, and have wandered day after day through its quiet cemetery,
till I have almost made acquaintance with its ancient grave-stones.

One day l was accosted by a peasant who had watched for a long time, in
silent wonder, the draft of the stone cross, as it grew into being
beneath my pencil; and finding the man "apt," as the ghost says to
Hamlet, I entered Into conversation with him. To some remark of mine
touching the antiquity of the place, he assured me "it was a fine *ould*
place, In the *ould* ancient times." In noticing the difference between
the two round towers - for there are *two* very fine ones at
Clonnmacnoise, one on the top of the hill, and one close beside the
plashy bank of the river - he accounted for the difference by a piece of
legendary information with which he favoured me, and which may, perhaps,
prove of sufficient importance to interest the reader.

"You see, sir," said he, "the one down there beyant, at the river side,
was built the first, and finished complate entirely, for the roof is an
it, you see; but when that was built, the bishop thought that another id
look very purty on the hill beyant, and so he bid the masons set to
work, and build up another tower there.

"Well, away they went to work, as busy as nailers; troth it was jist
like a bee-hive, every, man with his hammer in his hand, and sure the
tower was completed in due time. Well, when the last stone was laid on
the roof; the bishop axes the masons how much be was to pay them, and
they ups and towld him their price; but the bishop, they say, was a
neygar \[niggard\]--God forgi' me for saying the word of so holy a
man!--and he said they axed too much, and he wouldn't pay them. With
that, my jew'l, the masons said they would take no less; and what would
you think, but the bishop had the cunnin' to take away the ladthers that
was reared up agin the tower.

"'And now,' says he, 'my gay fellows,' says be, 'the divil a down out o'
that you'll come antil you larn manners, and take what's offered to
yees,' says he; ' and when yees come down in your price you may come
down yourselves into the bargain.'

"Well, sure enough, he kep his word, and wouldn't let man nor mortyel go
nigh them to help them; and faiks the masons didn't like the notion of
losing, their honest airnins, and small blame to them; but sure they wor
starvin' all the time, and didn't know what in the wide world to do,
when there was a fool chanc'd to pass by, and seen them.

"'Musha! but you look well there,' says the innocent, 'an' how are you?'
says he.

"'Not much the better av your axin,' says they.

"'Maybe you're out there,' says he. So he questioned them, and they
tould him how it was with them, and how the bishop tuk away the
ladthers, and they couldn't come down.

"Tut, you fools!' says he; 'sure isn't it aisier to take down two stones
nor to put up one?'

"Wasn't that mighty cute o' the fool, sir? And wid that, my dear sowl,
no sooner said than done. Faiks, the masons began to pull down their
work, and whin they went an for some time, the bishop bid them stop, and
he'd let them down; but faiks, before he gev in to them they had taken
the roof clane off; and that's the raison that one tower has a roof,
sir, and the other has none."

But before I had seen Clonmacnoise and its towers, I was intimate with
the most striking of its legends by favour of the sinewy boatman,who
rowed me to it, We had not long left Shannonbridge, when, doubling an
angle of the shore, and stretching up a reach of the river where it
widens, the principal round tower of Clonmacnoise became visible.

"What tower is that?" said I to my Charon.

"That's the big tower of Clonmacnoise, sir," he answered; "an' if your
honour, looks sharp, a little to the right of it, lower down, you'll see
the ruins of the ould palace."

On a somewhat closer inspection, I did perceive the remains he spoke of;
dimly discernible in the distance; and it was not without his indication
of their relative situation to the tower that I could have distinguished
them from the sober grey of the horizon behind them, for the evening was
closing fast, and we were moving eastward.

"Does your honour see it yit?" said my boatman.

"I do," said I.

"God spare you your eye-sight," responded he, "for troth it's few
gintlemen could see the ould palace this far off, and the sun so low,
barrin' they were used to *sportin',* and had a sharp eye for the birds
over a bog, or the like o' that. Oh, then, it's Clonmacnoise, your
honour, that's the holy place," continued he, "mighty holy in the ould
ancient times, and mighty great too, wid the sivin churches, let alone
the two towers, and the bishop, and plinty o' priests, and all to that."

"Two towers?" said l; "then l suppose one has fallen?"

"Not at all, sir," said he; "but the other one that you can't see is
beyant in the hollow by the river-side."

"And it was a great place, you say, in the *ould ancient times?*"

"Troth it was, sir, and is still, for to this day it *bates* the world
in regard o' pilgrims."

"Pilgrims!" I ejaculated.

"Yes, sir," said the boatman, with his own quiet manner, although it was
evident to a quick observer that my surprise at the mention of pilgrims
had not escaped him.

I mused a moment. Pilgrims, thought I, in the *British* dominions, in
the nineteenth century--strange enough!

"And so," continued I aloud, "you have pilgrims at Clonmacnoise?"

"Troth we have, your honour, from the top of the north and the farthest
corner of Kerry; and you may see them any day in the week, let alone the
pathern \[patron\] day, when all the world, you'd think, was there."

"And the palace," said I, "I suppose belonged to the bishop of
Clonmacnoise?"

"Some says 'twas the bishop, your honour, and indeed it is them that has
larnin' says so; but more says 'twas a king had it long ago, afore the
Churches was there at all, at all; and sure enough It looks far oulder
nor the Churches, though them is ould enough, God knows. All the
knowledgable people I ever heerd talk of it says that; and now, sir,"
said he, in an expostulatory tone, "wouldn't it be far more nath'ral
that the bishop id live in the Churches? And sure," continued, he,
evidently leaning to the popular belief, "id stands to *raisnon* that a
king id live in a palace, and why *shud* it be called a palace if a king
didn't live there?"

Satisfying himself with this most logical conclusion, he pulled his oar
with evident self-complacency; and as I have always found, I derived
more legendary information by yielding somewhat to the prejudice of the
narrator, and by abstaining from inflicting any wound on his pride (so
Irish a failing) by laughing at or endeavouring to, combat his
credulity, I seemed to favour his conclusions, and admitted that a king
must have been the *ci-devant* occupant of the palace. So much being
settled, he proceeded to tell me that "there was a mighty *quare* story"
about the last king that ruled Clonmacnoise; and having expressed an
eager desire to hear the *quare story*, he seemed quite happy at being
called on to fulfil the office of chronicler; and pulling his oar with
an easier sweep, lest he might disturb the quiet hearing of his legend
by the rude splash of the water, he prepared to tell his tale, and I to
devour up his discourse.

"Well, sir, they say there was a king wanst lived in the palace beyant,
and a sportin' fellow he was, and *Cead mile failte* was the word in the
palace; no one kem but was welkim, and I go bail the sorra one left it
without the *deoch an' doris.* Well, to be sure, the king, av coorse,
had the best' of eatin' and drinkin', and there was bed and boord for
the stranger, let alone the welkim for the neighbours--and a good
neighbour he was by all accounts, until, as bad luck would have it, a
crass ould bishop (the saints forgi' me for saying the word!) kem to
rule over the Churches. Now, you must know, the king was a likely man,
and as I said already, he was a sportin' fellow, and by coorse a great
favourite with the women; he had a smile and a wink for the crathers at
every hand's turn, and the soft word, and the--The short and the long of
it is, he was the *divil* among the girls.

"Well, sir, it was all mighty well, antil the ould bishop I mintioned
arrived at the Churches; but whin he kem, he tuk great scandal at the
goings-an of the king, and he determined to cut him short in his coorses
all at wanst; so with that whin the king wint to his duty, the bishop
ups and he tells him that he must mend his manners, and all to that; and
when the king said that the likes o' that was never tould him afore by
the best priest o' them all, 'More shame for them that *wor* before
me*,'* says the bishop.

"But to make a long, story short, the king looked mighty black at the
bishop, and the bishop looked twice, blacker at him again, and so on,
from bad to worse, till they parted the bittherest of inimies: and the
king, that was the best o' friends to the Churches afore, swore be this
and be that he'd vex them for it, and that he'd be even with the bishop
alore long.

"Now, sir, the bishop might jist as well have kept never mindin' the
king's little *kimmeens* with the girls, for the story goes that he had
a little fallin' of his own in regard of a dhrop, and that he knew the
differ betune wine and wather, for, poor ignorant crathurs, it's little
they knew about whisky in them days. 'Well, the king used often to send
*lashins* o' wine to the Churches, by the way, as he said, that they
should have plinty of it for celebrating the mass--although he knew well
that it was a little of it went far that-a-way, and that their
Riverinces was fond of a hearty glass as well as himself - and why not,
sir, if they'd let him alone - for, says the king, as many a one said
afore, and will again, I'll make a child's bargain with you, says he: do
you let me alone, and I'll let you alone; *manin'* by that, sir, that if
they'd say nothin' about the girls, he would give them plinty of wine.

"And so it fell out a little before he had the *scrimmage* with the
bishop, the king promised them a fine store of wine that was comin' up
the Shannon in boats, sir, and big boats they'wor, I'll go bail--not all
as one as the little *drolleen,* \[wren\] of a thing we're in now, but
nigh-hand as big as a ship; and there was three of these fine boats-full
comin'--two for himself, and one for the Churches; and so says the king
to himself, 'The divil receave the dhrop of that wine they shall get,'
says he, 'the dirty beggarly neygars; bad cess to the dbrop,' says he,
'my big-bellied bishop, to nourish your jolly red nose. I said I'd be
even with you,' says he, 'and so I will; and if you spoil my divarshin,
I'll spoil yours, and turn about is fair play, as the divil said to the
smoke-jack.' So with that, sir, the king goes and he gives ordhers to
his servants how it wid be when the boats kem up the river with the
wine--and more especial to one in partic'lar they called Corny, his own
man, by raison he was mighty stout, and didn't love priests much more
nor himself.

"Now, Corny, sir, let alone bein' stout, was mighty dark, and if he
wanst said the word, you might as well sthrive to move the rock of
Dunamaise as Corny, though without a big word at all, at all, but as
*quite* \[quiet\] as a child. Well, in good time, up kem the boats, and
down runs the monks, all as one as a flock o' crows over a cornfield, to
pick up whatever they could for themselves; but troth the king was afore
them, for all his men was there, and Corny at their head.

"'*Dominus vobiscum!'* (which manes, God save you, sir!) says one of the
monks to Corny, 'we kem down to save you the throuble' of unloading the
wine which the king, God bless him! gives to the Church.'

"'Oh, no throuble in life, plaze your Riverince,' says Corny, 'we'll
unload it ourselves, your Riverince,' says he.

"So with that they began unloading, first one boat, and then another;
but sure enough, every individual cashk of it went up to the palace, and
not a one to the Churches; so whin they seen the second boat a'most
empty, quare thoughts began to come into their heads; for before this
offer the first boat-load was always sent to the bishop, after a dhrop
was taken 'to the king, which, you know, was good manners, sir; and the
king, by all accounts, was a gentleman, every inch of him. So, with
that, says one of the monks:

"'My blessin' an you, Corny, my son,' says he, 'sure it's not forgettin'
the bishop you'd be, nor the Churches,' says he, 'that stands betune you
and the divil.'

"Well, sir, at the word divil, 'twas as good as a play to see the look
Corny gave out o' the corner of his eye at the monk.

"'Forget yez,' says Corny, 'throth it's long afore me or my *masther,*'
says he (nodding his head a bit at the word), 'will forget the bishop of
Cloumacnoise. Go an with your work, boys,' says he to the men about him;
and away they wint, and soon finished unloadin' the second boat; and
with that they began at the third.

"'God bless your work, boys,' says the bishop; for, sure enough, 'twas
the bishop himself kem down to the river side, having got the *hard
word* of what was goin' an. 'God bless your work,' says he, as they
heaved the first barrel of wine out of the boat. 'Go, help them, my
sons,' says he, turning round to half-a-dozen strappin' young priests as
was standing by.

"'No occasion in life, plaze your Riverince,' says Corny; 'I'm intirely
obleeged to your lordship, but we're able for the work ourselves,' says
he. And without sayin' another word, away went the barrel out of the
boat, and up on their shoulders, or whatever way they wor takin' it, and
up the bill to the palace.

"'Hillo!' says the bishop, 'where are yiz goin' with that wine?' says
he.

"'Where I tould them,' says Corny.

"'Is it to the palace?' says his Riverince.

"'Faith, you jist hit it,' says Corny.

"'And what's that for?' says the bishop.

"For fun,' says Corny, no ways *frikened* at all by the dark look the
bishop gave him. And sure it's a wondher the fear of the Church didn't
keep him in dread--but Corny was, the divil intirely.

"'Is that the answer you give your clergy, you reprobate?' says the
bishop. 'I'll tell you what it is, Corny,' says he, 'as sure as you're
standin' there I'll excommunicate you, my fine fellow, if you don't keep
a civil tongue in your head.'

"'Sure it wouldn't be worth your Riverince's while,' says Corny, 'to
excommunicate the likes o' me,' says he, 'while there's the king my
masther to 'the fore, for your holiness to play bell, book, and
candle-light with.'

"'Do you mane to say, you scruff of the earth,' says the, bishop, 'that
your masther, the king, put you up to what you're doing?'

"'Divil a thing else I mane,' says Corny.

"'You *villlian!* says the bishop, 'the king never did the like.'

"'Yes, but I did, though,' says the king, puttin' in his word fair an
aisy; for he was lookin' out o' his dhrawing-room windy, and run down
the hill to the river when he seen the bishop goin', as he thought, to
put his *comether* upon Corny.

"'So,' says. the bishop, turnin' round quite short to the king--'so*,*
my lord,' says he, 'am I to understand this villian has your commands
for his purty behavor?'

"'He has my commands for what he done,' says the king, quite stout; 'and
more be token, I'd have you to know he's no villian at all,' says he,
'but a thrusty servant, that does his masther's biddin'.'

"'And don't you intind sendin' any of this wine over to my Churches
beyant?' says the bishop.

"'The divil receave the dhrop,' says the king.

"' And what for?' says the bishop.

"'Bekase I've changed my mind,' says the king.

"'And won't you give the Church wine for the holy mass?' says the
bishop.

"'The mass!' says the king eyin' him mighty sly.

"'Yes, sir--the mass,' says his Riverince, colouring up to the eyes -'
the mass.'

"'Oh, *baithershin!'* says the king.

"'What do you mane?' says' the bishop--and his nose got blue with fair
rage.

"'Oh, nothin',' says the king with a toss of his head.

"'Are you a gintleman?' says the bishop.

"'Every inch o' me,' says the king.

"'Then sure no gintleman goes back of his word,' says the other.

"'I won't go back o' my word, either,' says the king. 'I promised to
give wine for the mass,' says he, 'and so I will. Send to my palace
every Sunday mornin', and you shall have a bottle of wine, and that's
plinty; for I'm thinkin',' says the king, 'that so much wine lyin'
beyant there is neither good for your bodies nor your sowls.'

"'What do you mane?' says the bishop, in a great passion, for all the
world like a turkey-cock.

"'I mane, that when your wine-cellar is so full,' says the king, 'it
only brings the fairies about you, and makes away with the wine too
fast,' says he, laughin'; 'and the fairies to be about the Churches
isn't good, your Riverince,' says the king; 'for I'm thinkin',' says he,
'that some of the spiteful little divils has given your Riverince a
blast, and burnt the ind of your nose.'

"With that, my dear, you couldn't hould the bishop with the rage he was
in; and says he," You think to dhrink all that 'wine--but you're
mistaken,' says he. 'Fill your cellars as much as you like,' says the
bishop, '*but you'll die in drooth yit;'* and with that he went down on
his knee. and cursed the king (God betune us and harm!) and shakin' his
fist at him, he gother \[gathered\] all his monks about him, and away
they whit home to the Churches.

"Well, sir, sure enough, the king fell sick of a suddent, and all the
docthors in the country round was sent for; but they could do him no
good at all, at all--and day by day he was wastin' and wastin', and
pinin', and pinin', till the flesh was worn off his bones, and he was as
bare and as yallow as a kite's claw; and then, what would you think, but
the drooth came an him sure enough, and be was callin' for dhrink every
*minit,* till you'd think he'd dhrink the *sae* dhry.

"Well, when the clock struck twelve that night, the drooth was an him
worse nor ever, though he dbrunk as much that day--ay, troth, as much as
would turn a mill; and he called to his servants for a dhrink of *grule*
\[gruel\].

"'The grule's all out,' says they.

"'Well, then, give me some *whay*,' says he.

"'There's none left, my lord,' says they.

"'Then give me a dhrink of wine,' says he.

"'There's none in the room, dear,' says the nurs-tindher.

"'Then go down to the wine-cellar,' says he, 'and get some.'

"'With that, they whit to the wine-cellar--but, jew'l machree, they soon
run back into his room, with their faces as white as a sheet, and tould
him there was not one dhrop of wine in all the cashks in the cellar.

"'Oh, murther! murther!' says the king, '*I'm dyin' of drooth,'* says
he.

"And then, God help iz! they bethought themselves of what the bishop
said, and the curse he laid an the king.

"'You've no gruel?' says the king.

"'No,' says they.

"'Nor *whay?*'

"'No,' 'says the sarvants.

"'Nor wine?' says the king.

"'Nor wine either, my lord,' says they.

"'Have you no *tay?'* says he.

"'Not a dhrop,' says the nurse-tindher.

"'Then,' says the king, 'for the tindher marcy of God, gi' me a dhrlnk
of wather.'

"And what would you think, sir, but there wasn't a dhrop of wather in
the place.

"'Oh, murther! murther!' says the king, 'isn't it a poor case that a
king can't get a dhrink of wather in his own house? Go then,' says he,
'and get me a jug of wather out of the ditch.'

"For there was a big ditch, sir, all round the palace. And away they run
for wather out of the ditch, while the king was roarin' like mad for the
drooth, and his mouth like a coal of fire. And sure, sir, the story
goes, they couldn't find any wather in the ditch!

"'Millia murther! millia murther!' cries the king, "will no one take
pity an a king that's

dyin' for the bare drooth?'

"And they all thrimbled again, with the fair fright, when they heerd
this, and thought of the ould bishop's prophecy.

"'Well,' says the poor king, 'run down to the Shannon,' says be, 'and
sure, at all event,, you'll get wather there,' says he.

"Well, sir, away they run with pails and noggins down to the Shannon,
and (God betune us and harm!) what do you think, sir, but the river
Shannon was dhry! So, av coorse, when the king heer the Shannon ass gone
dhry, it wint to his heart; and he thought o' the bishop's curse an
him--and givin' one murtherin' big *screech* that split the walls of the
palace, as may be seen to this day, he died, sir--makin' the bishop's
words good, that

'he would die of drooth yit!

"And now, air," says 'my historian, with a look of lurking humour in his
dark grey eye, "isn't that mighty wondherful--

iv it's true?"
