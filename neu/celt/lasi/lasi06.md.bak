# A White Trout

### A Legend of Cong

THE next morning I proceeded alone to the cave, to witness the natural
curiosity of its subterranean river, my interest in the visit being
somewhat increased by the foregoing tale. Leaving my home at the little
village of Cong I bent my way on foot through the fields, if you may
venture to give that name to the surface of this immediate district of
the couuty Mayo, which, presenting large flat muses of limestone,
intersected by patches of verdure, gives one the idea much more of a
burial-ground covered with monumental slabs than a formation of Nature.
Yet (I must make this remark *en* *passant)* such is the richness of the
pasture in these little verdant interstices, that cattle are fattened
upon it in a much shorter time than on a meadow of the most cultured
aspect; and though to the native of Leinster this *land* (if we may 'be
pardoned a premeditated *bull*) would appear all *stones,* the Mayo
farmer knows it from experience to be a profitable tenure. Sometimes
deep clefts occur between these laminae of limestone rock, which,
closely overgrown with verdure, have not infrequently occasioned serious
accidents to man. and beast; and one of these chasms, of larger
dimensions than usual, forms the entrance to the celebrated cave in
question.

Very rude steps of unequal height, partly natural and partly artificial,
lead the explorer of its quiet beauty, by an abrupt descent, to the
bottom of the cave, which contains an enlightened area of some thirty or
forty feet, whence a naturally vaulted passage opens, of the deepest
gloom. The depth of the cave may be about equal to its width at the
bottom; the mouth is not more than twelve or fifteen feet across; and
pendent from its margin clusters of ivy and other parasite plants bang
and cling in all the fantastic variety of natural festooning and
tracery. It is a truly beautiful and poetical little spot, and
particularly interesting to the stranger from, being unlike anything
else one has ever seen, and having none of the noisy and vulgar pretence
of regular *show-places*, which calls upon you every moment to exclaim
"Prodigious!"

An elderly and decent-looking woman had just filled her pitcher with the
deliciously cold and clear water of the subterranean river that flowed
along its bed of small, smooth, and many-coloured pebbles, as I arrived
at the bottom; and perceiving at once that I was a stranger, she paused,
partly perhaps with the pardonable pride of displaying her local
knowledge, but more from the native peasant politeness of her country,
to become the temporary *Cicerone* of the cave. She spoke some word of
Irish, and hurried forth on her errand a very handsome and active boy,
of whom she informed me she was the great-grandmother.

"Great-grandmother! "I repeated, in unfeigned astonishment.

"Yes, your honour," she answered, with evident pleasure sparkling In her
eyes, which time had not yet deprived of then, brightness, or the
soul-subduing influence of this selfish world bereft of their
kind-hearted expression.

"You are the youngest woman I have ever seen," said I, "to be a
great-grandmother."

"Troth, I don't doubt you, sir," she answered.

"And you seem still in good health, and likely to live many a year yet,"
said I.

"With the help of God, sir," said she reverently.

"But," I added, "I perceive a great number of persons about here of
extreme age. Now, how long generally do the people in this country
live?"

"Troth, sir," said she, with the figurative drollery of her country, "we
live here as long as we like."

"Well, that is no inconsiderable privilege," said I; "but you,
nevertheless, must have married very young?"

"I was not much over sixteen, your honour, when I had my first child at
my breast."

"That was beginning early," said I.

"Thrue for you, sir; and faith, Noreen (that's my daughter, sir)--Noreen
herself lost no time either; I suppose she thought she had as good a
right as the mother before her--she was married at seventeen, and a
likely couple herself and her husband was. So you see, sir, it was not
long before I was a granny. Well, to make the saying good, 'As the ould
cock crows, the young bird cherrups,' and faiks, the whole breed, seed,
and generation tuk after the owld woman (that's myself sir); and so, in
coorse of time, I was not only a granny, but a *grate* granny; and, by
the same token, here comes my darling Paudeen Bawn, with what I sent him
for."

Here the fine little fellow I have spoken of, with his long fair hair
curling about his shoulders, descended into the cave, bearing some
faggot of bogwood, a wisp of straw, and a lighted sod of turf.

"Now, your honour, it's what you'll see the pigeon-hole to advantage."

"What pigeon-hole!" said I.

"Here where we are," she replied.

"Why is it so called?" l inquired.

"Because, sir, the wild pigeons often build in the bushes and the ivy
that's round the mouth of the cave, and in here too," said she, pointing
into the gloomy depth of the interior.

"Blow that turf, Paudeen; "and Paudeen, with distended cheeks and
compressed lips, forthwith poured a few vigorous blasts on the sod of
turf, which soon flickered and blazed, while the kind old woman lighted
her faggots of bogwood at the flame.

"Now, sir, follow me," 'said my conductress.

"I am sorry you have had so much trouble on my account," said I. "Oh, no
throuble in life, your honour, but the greatest of pleasure;" and so
saying, she proceeded into the cave, and I followed, carefully choosing
my steps by the help of her torch-light along the slippery path of rock
that overhung the river. When she had reached a point of some little
elevation, she held up her lighted pine branches, and waving them to and
fro, asked me could I see the top of the cave.

The effect of her figure was very fine, illumined as it was in the midst
of utter darkness by the red glare of the blazing faggots; and as she
wound them round her head, and shook their flickering sparks about, it
required no extraordinary stretch of imagination to suppose her, with
her ample cloak of dark drapery, and a few straggling tresses of grey
hair escaping from the folds of a rather Eastern head-dress, some sibyl
about to commence an awful rite, and evoke her ministering spirits from
the dark void, or call some water-demon from the river, which rushed
unseen along, telling of its wild course by the turbulent dash of its
waters, which the reverberation of the cave rendered still more hollow.

She shouted aloud, and the cavern - echoes answered to her summons.
"Look!" said she--and she lighted the wisp of straw, and flung it on the
stream. It floated rapidly away, blazing in wild undulations over the
perturbed surface of the river, and at length suddenly disappeared
altogether. The effect was most picturesque and startling; it was even
awful. I might almost say sublime!

Her light being nearly expired, we retraced our steps, and emerging from
the gloom, stood beside the river, in the enlightened area I have
described.

"Now, sir," said my old woman, "we must thry and see the white throut;
and you never seen a throut o' that colour yet, I warrant."

I assented to the truth of this.

"They say it's a fairy throut, yer honour, and tells mighty quare
stories about it."

"What are they?" I inquired.

"Troth, it's myself doesn't know the half o' them--only partly; but
sthrive and see it before you go, sir, for there's them that says it
isn't lucky to come to the cave and lave it without seein' the white
throat. And if you're a bachelor, sir, and didn't get a peep at it,
throth, you'd never be married, and sure that 'id be a murther."

"Oh," said I, "I hope the fairies would not be so spiteful--"

"Whisht, whisht!" said she, looking fearfully around; then, knitting her
brows, she gave me an admonitory look, and put her finger on her lip, in
token of silence, and then coming sufficiently near me to make herself
audible in a whisper, she said, "Never speak ill, your honour, of the
good people--beyant all, in sitch a place this--for it's in the likes
they always keep; and one doesn't know who may be listenin'. God keep
uz! But look, sir, look!" and she pointed to the stream--" there she
is."

"Who--what?" said I.

"The throut, sir."

I immediately perceived the fish in question, perfectly a trout in
shape, but in colour a creamy white, heading up the stream, and seeming
to keep constantly within the region of the enlightened part of it.

"There it is, in that very spot evermore," continued my guide, "and
never anywhere else."

"The poor fish, I suppose, likes to swim in the light," said I.

"Oh, no, sir," said she, shaking her head significantly, "the people
here has a mighty owld story about that throut"

"Let me bear it, and you will oblige me."

"Och! it's only laughin' at me you'd be, and call me an ould fool, as
the misthiss beyant in the big house often did afore, when she first kem
among us--but she knows the differ now."

"Indeed I shall not laugh at your story," said I, "but on the contrary,
shall thank you very much for your tale."

"Then sit down a minnit, sir," said she, throwing her apron upon the
rock, and pointing to the seat, "and I'll tell you to the best of my
knowledge." And seating herself on an adjacent patch of verdure, she
began her legend.

"There was wanst upon a time, long ago, a beautiful young lady that
lived in a castle up by the lake beyant, and they say she was promised
to a king's son, and they wor to be married; when, all of a suddent, he
was murthered, the crathur (Lord help us), and threwn into the lake
abow, and so, of coorse, he couldn't keep his promise to the fair
lady--and more's the pity.

"Well, the story goes that she went out iv her mind bekase av losin' the
king's son; for she was tindher-hearted, God help her! like the rest iv
us, and pined away after him, until, at last,no one about seen her, good
or bad, and the story wint that the fairies took her away.

"Well, sir, in coorse o' time the white throut, God bless it! was seen
in the sthrame beyant, and sure the people didn't know what to think av
the crathur, seein' as how a *white* throut was never heerd av afore nor
sence; and years upon years the throut was there, just where you seen it
this blessed minnit, longer nor I can tell--aye, troth, and beyant the
memory o' th' ouldest in the village.

"At last the people began to think it must be a fairy--for what else
could it be?--and no hurt nor harm was iver put an the white throut,
antil some wicked sinners of sojers kem to these parts, and laughed at
all the people, and gibed and jeered them for thinkin' o' the likes; and
one o' them in partic'lar (bad luck to him; God forgi' me for sayin'
it!) swore he'd catch the throut and ate it for his dinner--the
blackguard!

"Well, what would you think o' the villiany of the sojer?--Sure enough
he cotch the throut; and away wid him home, and puts an the fryin'-pan,
and into it he pitches the purty little thing. The throut squeeled all
as one as a Christian crathur, and, my dear, you'd think the sojer id
split his sides laughin'--for he was a harden'd villian; and when he
thought one side was done, he turns it over to fry the other; and what
would you think, but the divil a taste of a burn was an it at all at
all; and sure the sojer thought it was a *quare* throut that couldn't be
briled. 'But,' says he, 'I'll give it another turn, by-and-by '--little
thinkin' what was in store for him--the haythen!

"Well, when he thought that side was done, he turns it again--and lo and
behould you, the divil a taste more done that side was nor the other.
'Bad luck to me,' says the sojer, 'but that bates the world!' says he;
'but I'll thry you agin, my darlint,' says he, 'as cunnin' as you think
yourself,'--and so, with that, he turns it over and over; but the divil
a sign av the fire was an the purty throut. 'Well,' says the desperate
villian (for sure, sir, only he was a desperate villian *entirely,* he
might know he was doin' a wrong thing, seein' that all his endayvours
was no good)--'well,' says he, 'my jolly little throut, maybe you're
fried enough, though you don't seem over-well dress'd; but you may be
better than you look, like a singed cat, and a tit-bit, afther all,'
says he; and with that he ups with his knife and fork to taste a piece
o' the throut--but, my jew'l, the minnit he puts his knife into the
fish, there was a murthenin' screech, that you'd think the life id lave
you if you heerd it, and away jumps the throut out av the fryin'-pan
into the middle o' the flure; and an the spot where it fell, up riz a
lovely lady--the beautifullest young crathur that eyes ever seen,
dressed in white with a band o' goold in her hair, and a sthrame o'
blood runnin' down her arm.

"Look where you cut me, you villian,' says she, and she held out her arm
to him--and, my dear, he thought the sight id lave his eyes.

"Couldn't you lave me cool and comfortable in the river where you snared
me, and not disturb me in my duty?' says she.

"Well, be thrimbled like a dog in a wet sack, and at last he stammered
out somethin', and begged for his life, and ax'd her ladyship's pardin,
and said he didn't know she was an duty, or he was too good a sojer not
to know betther nor to meddle wid her.

"'I *was* on duty, then,' says the lady; 'I was watchin' for my thrue
love, that is comin' by wather to me,' says she; 'an' if be comes while
I am away, an' that I miss iv him, I'll turn you into a pinkeen, and
I'll hunt you up and down for evermore, while grass grows or wather
runs.'

"Well, the sojer thought the life id lave him at the thoughts iv his
bein' turned into a pinkeen, and begged for mercy; and with that, says
the lady:

"'Renounce your evil coorses,' says she, 'you villian, or you'll repint
it too late; be a good man for the futhur, and go to your' duty reg'lar.
And now,' says she, 'take me back, and put me into the river agin, where
you found me.'

"'Oh, my lady,' says the sojer, 'how could I have the heart to drownd a
beautiful lady like you?'

"But before he could say another word, the lady was vanished, and there
he saw the little throut an the ground. Well, he put it an a clane
plate, and away he run for the bare life, for fear her lover would come
while she was away; and he run, and he run, ever till be came to the
cave agin, and threw the throat into the river. The minnit he did, the
wather was as red as blood for a little while, by raison av the cut, I
suppose, until, the sthrame washed the stain away; and to this day
there's a little red mark an the throut's side where it was cut.

"Well, sir, from that day out the sojer was an althered man, and
reformed his way; and wint to his duty reg'lar, and fasted three times a
week--though it was never fish he tuk an fastin' days; for afther the
fright be got, fish id never rest an his stomach, God bless us!--savin'
your presence. But anyhow, he was an althered man, as I said before; and
in coorse o' time he left the army, and turned hermit at last; and they
say he

used to pray evermore for the sowl of the White Throut."
