Einion and the Fair Family

<span id="img_17"></span> ![](img/17.jpg)

ONCE on a time a shepherd went up a mountain to look after his sheep. A
thick mist came on, and he lost his way, and walked backwards and
forwards for many a long hour. At last he got into a low rushy place,
where he saw before him many circular rings. He knew at once that they
were the circles in which the Fair Family danced, and remembering how
many a shepherd who had chanced on these rings had disappeared from
mortal eyes, he determined to run away as fast as he could. As he was
racing off he was met by an old fat little man. "Stop," said the old
man, and there was something in this voice which made Einion (that was
the shepherd's name) obey. "What art thou doing?" "I am running home,"
said the shepherd. "Come after me," said the old man, "and do not utter
a word until I bid thee." The shepherd could not choose but obey, and he
followed his guide on and on until they came to an oval stone. The old
man tapped the stone three times with his walking stick, and the stone
rose of its own accord, disclosing a narrow passage leading into the
earth.. "Follow me fearlessly," said the fat man; "no harm will be done
thee." On the youth went, as reluctantly as a dog to be hanged. It was
dark in the passage, though a sort of whitish light radiated from the
stones which formed the roof: at last the tunnel opened into a fine
wooded fertile country. Birds sang in the groves, and streams of clear
water, flowing through meadows carpeted with bright flowers, made music
as sweet as that of the feathered tribe. Dotting the landscape were
splendid mansions, and into one of these Einion was led by the little
man. Both sat down to eat at a table of silver: golden dishes containing
the most delicious meats and golden goblets full of exquisite wine came
to their places of themselves and disappeared of themselves when done
with. This puzzled the shepherd beyond measure: moreover, he heard
people talking together around him, but for the life of him he could see
no one but his aged friend. At length the fat man said to him, "Thou
canst now talk as much as it may please thee." Einion tried to speak,
but he found that his tongue would no more stir than if it had been a
lump of ice. Three beautiful maidens came in: they looked archly at him
and began to talk to him, but still his tongue would not wag. Then one
of the maidens came to him, and playing with his fair curling hair, gave
him a kiss on his ruddy lips. This loosened the string that bound his
tongue, and Einion began to talk freely, and he had much to say,
especially to the maiden who had kissed him.

He remained a year and a day with the little man and his daughters
without knowing that he had passed more than a day among them, for he
was so happy. But by-and-by he began to feel somewhat of a longing to
visit his old home, and he asked his fat host if he might go. "Stay a
little yet," said he, "and thou shalt go for a while." He asked a second
time after some while, and was again refused permission. Mererid (that
was what the damsel who kissed him was called) looked very sad when he
talked of going away; nor was he himself without feeling a sort of a
cold thrill passing through him at the thought of leaving her. The
longing for home, however, would not leave him, and he asked a third
time to be allowed to go to earth. This time, on condition that he
returned on the first night of the new moon, he obtained leave to go.

Everyone was delighted to see him, for it was thought that he had been
killed. Another shepherd had been suspected of murdering him, and had
been compelled to run away to Merthyr Tydfil (that was where all persons
fled to at that time when they wished to avoid punishment) lest he
should be hanged. Einion would not tell anyone where he had been, and on
the appointed night he went back to Fairyland. Mererid was rejoiced at
his return, and before long the twain were wedded, and lived very
happily. Einion, however, could not rest contented with his life in
Fairyland, and entreated the old man for leave to take his wife with him
and dwell on earth. At last the old man consented and gave him much
silver and gold, and many precious gems to take with him. So Einion and
his bride set out on two ponies whiter than snow and arrived at his old
home. With the treasure which they had brought with them they acquired
an immense estate, and no couple in the country were more honoured than
they. But it was not long before people began to inquire about the
pedigree of Einion's wife, and as he would not tell them who she was,
they came to the conclusion that she was one of the Fair Family.
"Certainly," said Einion, when asked whether this were so, "there can be
no doubt that she comes from a very fair family: for she has two sisters
who are almost as fair as she is, and if you saw them together, you
would admit that this name is a most fitting one."
