Lowri Dafydd Earns a Purse of Gold

<span id="img_07"></span> ![](img/07.jpg)

 

LOWRI DAFYDD had just arrived at Hafodydd Brithion to nurse a sick
woman, when a fine-looking man galloped up to the door on a noble grey
horse and said in a loud voice, "Is Lowri Dafydd here?"

"Yes, sir," answered Lowri in. a very meek voice.

"Then come with me at once," said the fine-looking man.

"But I have my duty to do here," remonstrated Lowri.

"Come with me 'at once," repeated the fine-looking man; and he spoke in
such a tone that Lowri had not the courage to say no.

She mounted behind him, and off they went, like the flight of a swallow,
through Cwmllan, down Nant yr Aran, and over the Gader to Cwm Hafod
Ruffydd, before the poor woman had time even to say "Oh!"

When they reached Cwm Hafod Ruffydd, Lowri saw a magnificent mansion
before her, splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never seen
before. They entered the court, and a crowd of servants in gorgeous
liveries came to meet them.

"Lead her to the bed-chamber," said the fine-looking man; and Lowri was
conducted through the great hall into a bed-chamber which surpassed in
luxury and splendour anything she had ever dreamed of, let alone seen.
There the mistress of the house, to whose aid she had been summoned, was
awaiting her.

Lowri nursed her with her accustomed skill, and stayed with her until
the lady was completely recovered. It was the pleasantest episode of
Lowri's life; there was festivity day and night; dancing, singing and
merriment went on ceaselessly. She was very sad when the time came for
her to depart. The fine-looking man gave her a great, heavy purse, with
the order not to open it until she reached her own house. Then he bade
one of his servants escort her back the same way that she had come. When
she reached home she opened the purse, and to her intense delight it was
full of gold. She lived happily on these earnings to the end of her
life.
