Another Changeling

ONE wet, cold, stormy summer in the olden time a baby was born at
Dyffryn Mymbyr, near Capel Curig. The homestead was so far from any
church, and the rain had made the roads so impassable, that the parents
did not take the child to be baptised, in the hope of getting finer
weather and drier roads. Then the hay harvest came: on the few days when
it was fine all the family were of course hard at work in the fields,
trying to save the harvest, and no one could be spared to take the baby
to the parson: on the other days it rained old women and sticks, and no
one could stir out of the house.

After a downpour lasting a week there came a beautifully fine day, and
all who could handle a rake went to the fields to turn the sodden and
blackening hay to be dried by sun and wind. The baby was left sleeping
in its cradle in the house under the charge of its grandmother, who was
so old and feeble that it was with difficulty that she could move even
from one side of the house to the other. She sat in a great straw chair
by the side of the fire, and under the genial influence of the heat
thrown out by the burning peat she first of all blinked and nodded, and
then fell fast asleep with her chin on her breast.

As she slumbered, who should come into the house but a troop of the Fair
Family. They took the unbaptised baby out of its cradle and put in its
stead one of their own cross-grained, peevish infants. It at once began
to whine and whimper, and the noise it made awakened the sleeping
granny. She hobbled to the cradle, and instead of the plump,
good-tempered baby which had been lying there, she found a thin, wizened
thing with an old man's face, tossing about and crying as loudly as its
lungs would permit. "This is a changeling," she at once said to herself;
"that old family has been here while I slept." She took the dinner horn
and blew it to call the mother home. She came without delay, and hearing
the crying did not pause to ask the grandmother why she had been
summoned, but went at once to the cradle and lifted up the little one
without looking at him. She hugged him, she tossed him up and down, she
sang lullaby to him, but nothing was of any avail: he continued without
stopping to scream enough to break her heart, and she did not know what
to do to calm him. At last she looked at him: she saw at once that he
was not her own dear little boy. She looked again, and his ugliness made
her feel quite ill. She gave up the attempt to quiet him, and putting
him back in the cradle, let him cry to his heart's content "This is not
my baby," she said. "No, it certainly is not," replied the grandmother.
"I fell asleep for a little while, and the fairies must have taken away
your boy while I slept, putting this ill-tempered brat in his place."

The whole family was now summoned from the hay. field, and an anxious
consultation took place. It was resolved that the father should go to
the parson of Trawsfynydd--there was no one skilled in such matters
nearer--to ask him what to do. Off he tramped the next day, and right
glad he was to get away from the "cold" screaming of the changeling,
which had never ceased from the time he came to Dyffryn Mymbyr. The
parson was reluctant to advise at first, on the ground that it served
the parents right for not having the baby baptised: an unbaptised child,
he said, was almost certain to be changed by the fairies. But the
father's explanation appeased him, and he counselled thus: "There are
many ways," he said, "of getting rid of a fairy changeling. One is to
leave it all night in a cradle under an oak tree. Many mothers have had
their own babies restored to them in this way. Another way is to throw
the changeling into a river or lake. There was once a couple at Corwrion
to whom twin children were born. The fairies stole them, and left two of
their own brats instead. The mother took them to a wooden bridge and
dropped them into the river beneath. Before they reached the water the
old elves of the blue trousers caught them, and when the woman returned
to her house she found her own children back again. I have also known
changelings got rid of by throwing iron at them. But the best plan is
this: take a shovel and cover it with salt, and make the figure of the
cross in the salt. Then take the shovel to the room where the changeling
is lying: open the window, and place the shovel on the fire until the
salt is burnt. Then you will get your child back again."

As soon as he got home the father did as the parson directed. When the
shovel was placed on the fire the changeling suddenly ceased its crying,
and by the time the salt was hot it had gone away, seen of no one. The
door was opened, and there was the lost baby, whole and unscathed, lying
on the threshold.
