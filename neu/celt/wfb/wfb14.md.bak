Cadwaladr and His Goat

CADWALADR had a very handsome goat named Jenny, of which he was very
proud. Now Jenny was a very well-behaved goat as a rule and gave no
trouble, but one evening she would not let Cadwaladr catch her. She ran
round and round the field, and though Cadwaladr was fleet of foot, do
what he would he could not get near her. Then she jumped over the hedge,
like a hunter, into the next field. When Cadwaladr went after her, she
jumped into the field beyond, and over the mountain wall towards the
mountain. Several times she allowed Cadwaladr to come close up to her
and then darted away. The last time she rushed up to the top of a high
precipice. Cadwaladr, who had been getting wilder and wilder as his
breath became shorter, now picked up a great stone and threw it at the
exasperating animal with all his force. The stone knocked her over the
precipice and she fell bleating to her doom. Cadwaladr was now very
sorry, and made his way to the foot of the crag: the goat was dying, and
licked his hand. This so affected him that he burst into tears, and
sitting on the ground took the goat's head on his arm. Suddenly the goat
was transformed into a beautiful young woman. Looking joyfully at him
with great brown eyes, she said, "Ah, Cadwaladr, have I at last found
you? Come with me." He put his hand in hers and allowed her to conduct
him away. As for the hand, it felt just like a hoof, but when Cadwaladr
looked at it, it seemed like an ordinary hand though it was whiter and
more shapely than any hand he had ever seen before.

The maiden led him on and on, and Cadwaladr had never listened to more
agreeable conversation than hers. At last they came to the top of a very
high mountain. It was now night and the moon was shining. Cadwaladr
looked round and saw that they were surrounded by a countless flock of
goats, and the din of a most unearthly bleating arose suddenly. One of
the goats which was larger than all the rest bleated as loudly as all
the rest put together. This one rushed at Cadwaladr and, butting him in
the stomach, sent him toppling over, just as he had sent Jenny.
Cadwaladr went rolling down the mountain side and did not stop until his
head went crash against a great rock. He fainted away and he did not
recover consciousness until the sun and the singing birds awakened him
in the morning. But he saw no more of either his goat or the fairy she
had turned into from that day to his death.
