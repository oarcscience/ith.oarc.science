The Bride from the Red Lake

<span id="img_23"></span> ![](img/23.jpg)

A FARMER was one misty day fishing in Llyn Coch, the Red Lake, in the
Forest of Snowdon. A sudden gust of wind cleared a road through the grey
vapour that hung over the lake, and revealed a little man standing on a
ladder and busily engaged in thatching a stack. The stack and ladder
rested on the surface of the lake. In a few minutes the vision faded
away, and there was nothing but rippling water to be seen in the place
where the hay and thatcher had been observed.

After this the farmer often used to visit the lake, but he saw nothing
remarkable until one hot day in autumn, when riding by the lake he took
his horse into the water to drink. While the animal was slaking its
thirst he was looking idly at the ripples, when to his intense
astonishment he became aware of a most lovely face just beneath the
surface a little distance from him, looking up at him. As he gazed
bewildered, the head and shoulders which belonged to the face emerged
from the water. He leaped from his horse and rushed towards the damsel;
when he got there the vision had vanished, but it instantly reappeared
in another part of the lake. Again he rushed towards it, and again it
disappeared. This happened a third time, and a fourth time, and a fifth,
after which the farmer gave up the chase and went disconsolately home.

The next day the farmer went to the lake once more, and sat down by the
margin in the hope of seeing the beautiful damsel again, but for a long
time there was no sign of her. To beguile the tedium of waiting, he took
out of his pocket some apples of rare and delicious quality which had
been given to him by a neighbour, and began to munch one of them.
Suddenly the lady appeared in all her dazzling beauty almost close to
him, and begged him to throw her one of his apples. "If you want an
apple you must fetch it yourself," said the farmer, and he held out the
tempting morsel, exhibiting its beautiful red and green sides. Upon this
she came up quite close, and as she took the apple from his left hand,
he seized tight hold of her with his right and held her fast. She
screamed at the top of her voice, and an old man, with a long white
beard and a wreath of water-lilies, appeared out of the midst of the
lake. "Oh, mortal, what wouldest thou with my daughter?" he asked of the
farmer. The farmer said that he would break his heart unless the nymph
of the lake consented to be his wife. After much pleading the father
agreed to the union on one condition, which was that the young man
should not strike his wife with clay. The wedding took place at once,
and the couple lived together in the greatest happiness.

One day the wife expressed a desire for some of those same delicious
apples with which the farmer had tempted her out of the lake. Off went
the husband to the neighbour who grew them, and brought back not only
some apples, but a beautiful young sapling, bearing the same apple, as a
present from their friend. This they at once proceeded to set, he
digging and she holding the tree until the hole should be deep enough to
plant it in. "It is deep enough now," said the farmer, and for luck he
threw out the last spadeful of clay over his shoulder. He did not look
which way he threw it, and it fell right against the breast of his wife.
She no sooner received the blow than she cried with a great and
exceeding bitter cry. "Fare thee well, dear husband," she said, and ran
into the lake and disappeared beneath the smooth and glassy waters.
