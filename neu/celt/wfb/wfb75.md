The Parti-Coloured Cow

A PARTI-COLOURED cow once appeared on the high moor-lands of
Denbighshire. Everyone who was in want of milk went to her, and however
big a vessel was taken, it was always filled with rich milk. However
often she was milked, it made no difference. This continued for a long
time, and glad indeed were the people to avail themselves of her
unfailing supply. At last a wicked witch determined to milk her dry. The
hag took a riddle and milked and milked the parti-coloured cow until at
last the milk ran dry. Immediately the cow went off to a lake near
Cerrig y Drudion, bellowing horribly, and disappeared under its waters.
