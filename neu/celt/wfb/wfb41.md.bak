Magic Music

THERE was once a pious monk at Clynnog Fawr, in Arfon, whose, delight
was in the law of the Lord, and in His law did he meditate day and
night. One evening he was walking in deep thought through a grove near
the monastery, by the side of a stream, which tumbled noisily over the
stones in its hurry to reach the sea. Suddenly a bird burst into song,
and its lay was the sweetest and most lovely music that the man of God
had ever listened to. He paused to listen, and remained listening until
the bird ceased to pour forth its golden notes. Then he passed out of
the grove and looked around. The monastery was unchanged, but everything
else was different. He went to the monastery. The faces of all the monks
were strange to him, and not a soul knew him. The brethren crowded round
him, and he told them how he had been listening in the grove for a short
time to the melody of a bird. He asked them to put him in a cell, for he
wanted to pray. This was done. Some time after a brother went to see
whether he could render him any service. The cell was empty, but there
was a handful of ashes on the stone floor.

Search was made in the books of the monastery, and it was found that
some hundreds of years before a brother had gone out of the monastery
and never returned. Since then the trees in which he listened to the
magic music have been called the Grove of Heaven.
