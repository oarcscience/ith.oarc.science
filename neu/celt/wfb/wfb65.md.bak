Nansi Llwyd and the Dog of Darkness

NANSI LLWYD was walking in the dusk of the evening towards Aberystruth,
and she was in a very bad temper, for she was longing to get married,
and according to all the omens she never would.

The previous night being All Hallow Eve, she and Gweno Dafydd and Sian
Probert had been seeking to learn the future. Sian and Gweno were
satisfied with the results of the *rhamanta* or divination, but Nansi
was cruelly disappointed. What made it worse was that they had all made
a great preparation for the test. Nansi had slept not long before on an
oat-straw bed, Gweno had spent a night on a mattress made of the leaves
of the mountain ash mixed with the seeds of spring fern, and Sian had a
pillow of maiden hair on which she had laid her comely head. Nor had,
they confined themselves to one test. First of all they experimented
with yarn. Taking a ball of yarn, Nansi and Gweno doubled the threads
and tied tiny pieces of wood along them so as to form a little ladder.
Then they went upstairs together and, opening the window, threw the
ladder to the ground. Nansi began winding the yarn back, saying the
while:

"I am winding,  
Who is holding?"

This she did three times, and no lover made his appearance, so that her
chance of marriage for one year was lost. When Gweno performed the
ceremony, on the other hand, Cadwaladr Rhys, a most desirable young man,
appeared.

The water-in-basin test was still more unsatisfactory. Three basins were
placed on the table, one filled with clear spring water, one with muddy
water, and the other empty. The three girls were led blindfolded to the
table, and told to place their hands on the basins. Gweno put her hand
on the basin containing clear spring water, which showed that she was to
marry a bachelor. Sian touched the basin with the muddy water, which
meant she was to wed a widower. Nansi's hand lighted on the empty basin.
This meant that a single life was in store for her. Now, to remain
unmarried for one year is not very serious, but lifelong maidenhood was
a prospect which made Nansi feel first hot and then cold.

She consoled herself with the reflection that the water-in-basin test
was not absolutely certain, and she decided to try the pullet's egg
test. She took the first egg of a pullet, cut it through the middle,
filled one half-shell with wheaten flour, added salt to the other, and
then made a cake out of the egg, the flour and the salt. One-half of
this cake she ate: the other half she placed in the foot of her left
stocking under her pillow as she went to bed. Then she said her prayers,
and lay down to sleep. Now she ought to have dreamt of some man coming
to her bedside to offer her a drink of water: this man would be her
future husband. But troubled as her dreams were, no human being figured
in them, and she felt when she got up that all the sunshine had gone out
of life. She became still more sad when she went to examine the
movements of the snail she had placed under a basin early the day
before. If it had been a right-minded snail it would have moved about
and traced the initials of her future husband's name. But the slimy
sluggard had remained motionless, and Nansi hurled it viciously out of
the window. If it did not sustain serious injuries from the fall, it was
not Nansi's fault. All this evidence that she was to be an old maid made
Nansi very bad tempered, and she had not recovered when she took her
walk.

Suddenly a horse came galloping down the road, and she was all but
knocked down by the furious animal. She recognised the horse as that of
Jenkin Pari, whom she had noticed going to market that morning, and she
wondered how it had come to pass that the steed was bolting home at such
a pace without its rider. As she proceeded on her way, thinking about
the horse, she saw two large shining eyes, which drew nearer and nearer.
Presently the body and limbs of a large spotted dog loomed into sight.
Nansi had a mastiff with her, and she tried to set it on the strange
hound. In vain: the mastiff crouched frightened at her feet and whined
piteously. The great dog with the fiery eyes came right up to her, and
Nansi, to protect herself, kicked at it as hard as she could with her
right foot. Her foot was paralysed, and when a circle of fire surrounded
the hound she had kicked, and it squatted on its haunches, setting up a
loud, horrible unearthly howl, she fell senseless on the ground.

She was discovered, still unconscious, by old Antoni, Jenkin Pari's farm
bailiff. He, seeing his master's horse standing trembling by the stable
door, had set out in search of the farmer. He came across Nansi, and
brought her to by dashing cold water on her face. Going further along
the road he found Jenkin Pari lying in a dead faint on his back in the
mud. Jenkin said when he came to himself that the horse had shied,
reared and tumbled him off. Jenkin was none the worse for his fall, but
Nansi's right leg was as black as coal until the day of her death. Had
she not been in so bad a temper, she would have realised that it was the
Gwyllgi, or Dog of Darkness, that had come along the road, and she would
no more have touched it than she would have refused an offer of
marriage.
