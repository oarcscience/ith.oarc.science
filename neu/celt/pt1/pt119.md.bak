### THE POOR BROTHER AND THE RICH.

From Flora MacIntyre, Islay.

THERE was a poor brother and a rich brother before now. The work that
the poor one had, was to be at drains; he hired a gillie, and they had
nothing with their mealtime but to take it without sauce. "Had'nt we
better," said the gillie, "steal a cow of thy brother's lot?" They went
and they did this.

The rich brother was taking a notion that it was they who stole his cow;
and he did not know in what way he could contrive to find out if it were
they who stole her. He went and he put his mother-in-law in a kist, and
he came to seek room for the kist in his brother's house; he put bread
and cheese with the crone in the kist; and there was a hole in it, in
order that she might find out everything. The gillie found out that the
crone was in the kist; he wetted sacks and put them on top of the kist;
the water was streaming out of the sacks on the crone, and she was not
hearing a word. He went, in the night, where the crone was, and he said
to her, "Was she hearing?" "I am not," said she." "Art thou eating a
few?" "I am not." "Give me a piece of the cheese, and I will cut it for
thee." He cut the cheese, and he stuffed it into her throat till she was
choked. The kist was taken home, and the

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

dead crone in it. They buried the crone, and they laid out but little on
her.

In the night, said the poor man's gillie to his master, "Is it not
lamentable that such and such linen should go with the crone to the
cell, <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) while the children are so much
in want of shirts?" He went, and he took a spade with him, and he
reached the church-yard. He dug the grave, and he took the crone from
the coffin; he took off her the tais dress, he threw her on his back,
and he came to the house of the rich brother; he went in with her, and
he placed her seated at the fireside, and the tongs between her two
feet. When the maid servant rose in the morning, she fell in a faint
when she saw the crone before her. The rich brother thrashed his wife
because of her mother saying, "that she was about to bring him to bare
ruin." He went to the house of his poor brother and told that the crone
had come home. "Ah ha!" said the gillie, "because thou didst not spend
enough on her living, thou wilt spend it on her dead; I saw the like of
this before; thou must lay out a good deal on her."

They bought a good lot of things for the funeral, and they left the one
half of it in the house of the poor brother and they buried the crone
again. "Is it not lamentable," said the poor brother's gillie to his
master, "that such a lot of linen should go on the crone, while thou art
so much in want of a shirt thyself?" He went to the cell that night
again, he raised the crone, he took off her the tais clothes, and he
took her with him on his back; he went into the house of the rich
brother, as was usual, and be set the crone standing at the end of the
dresser, with her claw full of seeds from the dish of sowens, as if she
were eating it

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

\[paragraph continues\] When the man of the house saw her back in the
morning, he thrashed his wife soundly, because of her mother. He went
then to the house of his poor brother, and he told that the crone had
come home again. "Aha!" said the gillie, "because thou didst not spend
money on her living, thou wilt spend it on her dead; I saw the like of
this before." "Go thou, then, and lay out a good deal on her, for I am
tired of her," said the man. He bought a good lot for the crone's
funeral, and he took the one half to his master's house. They buried the
crone. In the night, said the gillie to his master, "Is it not
lamentable that such linen should go with the crone to the cell, while I
myself am in such want of a shirt." He took himself to the cell, he
raised the crone, he took off her the tais dress, he put her on top of
him, and he reached the rich brother's house. He did not get in this
journey, so he went with her to the stable, and he tied her on top of a
year-old colt. When they rose in the morning, they were well pleased
when they did not see the crone before them. He was going from home; he
went out to the stable, and he took the mare with him; but he never
perceived that the crone was on top of the year-old. When he went away
on top of the mare, after him went the year-old with the crone
clattering on top of him. He turned back when he saw the crone, and he
was like to kill his wife this time. He went to his brother's house and
he told that the crone had come back again.

"As thou didst not spend money on her living," said the gillie, "thou
must spend it on her dead"

"Go and lay out as thou wilt on her," said he to the gillie, "but keep
her away."

He went this time and he bought a good lot for the

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

crone's funeral, and he invited every one in the place.

The buried the crone again; and the poor brother was as wealthy as the
other, by reason of the funerals.

One James MacQueen, who lived at Tirneagan, near Kilmeny, but who is not
living now, gave this to one Flora MacIntyre, at Kilmeny, who told it to
Hector MacLean.--May 1859.

This story is not like any other that I know. It is one of a kind which
is common, in which mortals alone play a part. Some are humorous, and
some free. One such has been versified by Allan Ramsay, page 520, vol.
2; and is nearly the same as Tom Totherhouse, the Norse tale.

The expensive funeral was once truly highland; and the invitation to all
the world characteristic. It used to be told of one such funeral party,
that they dropped the coffin out of a cart on the way over a strand, and
never found it out till they got to the churchyard. They returned and
finished the funeral, but went home afterwards very drunk; the sons
shouting "Horo! it's the carlin's wedding." The funeral dinner was
within my memory, and still may be, a solemn feast. Such toasts as
"Comfort to the distressed," and "The memory of the deceased," were
drank in solemn silence; and the whole matter was conducted with gravity
and decorum, but with profuse and necessary hospitality, for the funeral
guests had often to travel great distances, and the coffin had to be
carried many miles. No Highlander, if his friends can help it, is buried
anywhere but at home; coffins may be seen on board the steamers,
conveying to the outer islands the bodies of those who have died on the
mainland. It is a poetic wish to be buried amongst friends, and one that
is in full force in the Highlands to this day. The curse of Scotland may
occasionally intrude even on such solemn occasions; but a funeral is
almost always decorously conducted. In some places, as I am told, a
piper may still be seen at the head of the funeral procession, playing a
dirge. There is no want of reverence, but death is treated as an
ordinary event. I have seen a man's tombstone, with a blank for the
date, standing at the end of his house, while he was quite well.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

It was lately said of a man who went home to die, "He took his own body
home;" and so he did.

There is something mythological about the old woman who will not rest,
because enough has not been laid out on her funeral. It may be some
remnant of a notion of purgatory; but I suspect it is something heathen.

Romans had to pay their passage, perhaps Celts had to do so likewise.
