### THE TALE OF THE SHIFTY LAD, THE WIDOW'S SON.

From John Dewar, Arrochar, June, 1860.

THERE was at some time or other before now a widow, and she had one son.
She gave him good schooling, and she was wishful that he should choose a
trade for himself; but he said he would not go to learn any art, but
that he would be a thief.

His mother said to him: "If that is the art that thou art going to
choose for thine ownself, thine end is to be banged at the bridge of
Baile Cliath, <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) in Eirinn."

But it was no matter, be would not go to any art, but to be a thief; and
his mother was always making a prophecy to him that the end of him would
be, hanging at the Bridge of Baile Cliath, in Eirinn.

On a day of the days, the widow was going to the church to hear the
sermon, and was asking the Shifty Lad, her son, to go with her, and that
he should give over his bad courses; but he would not go with her; but
he said to her: "The first art of which thou hearest mention, after thou
hast come out of the sermon, is the art to which I will go afterwards."

She went to the church full of good courage, hoping that she would hear
some good thing.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

He went away, and he went to a tuft of wood that was near to the church;
and he went in hiding in a place where he could see his mother when she
should come out of the church; and as soon as she came out he shouted,
"Thievery! thievery! thievery!" She looked about, but she could not make
out whence the voice was coming, and she went home. He ran by the way of
the short cut, and he was at the house before her, and he was seated
within beside the fire when she came home. He asked her what tale she
had got; and she said that she had not got any tale at all, but that
"thievery, thievery, thievery, was the first speech she heard when she
came out of the church."

He said "That was the art that he would have."

And she said, as she was accustomed to say: "Thine ending is to be
hanged at the bridge of Baile Cliath, in Eirinn."

On the next day, his mother herself thought, that as nothing at all
would do for her son but that he should be a thief, that she would try
to find him a good aid-to-learning; and she went to the gadaiche dubh of
Aachaloinne, the black gallows bird of Aachaloinne, a very cunning thief
who was in that place; and though they had knowledge that he was given
to stealing, they were not finding any way for catching him. The widow
asked the Black Rogue if he would take her son to teach him roguery. The
Black Rogue said, "If he were a clever lad that he would take him, and
if there were a way of making a thief of him that he could do it;" and a
covenant was made between the Black Rogue and the Shifty Lad.

When the Shifty Lad, the widow's son, was making ready for going to the
Black Rogue, his mother was giving him counsel, and she said to him: "It
is against

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

my will that thou art going to thievery; and I was telling thee, that
the end of thee is to be hanged at the bridge of Baile Cliath, Eirinn;"
but the Shifty Lad went home to the Black Rogue.

The Black Rogue was giving the Shifty Lad every knowledge he might for
doing thievery; he used to tell him about the cunning things that he
must do, to get a chance to steal a thing; and when the Black Rogue
thought that the Shifty Lad was good enough at learning to be taken out
with him, he used to take him out with him to do stealing; and on a day
of these days the Black Rogue said to his lad--

"We are long enough thus, we must go and do something. There is a rich
tenant near to us, and he has much money in his chest. It was he who
bought all that there was of cattle to be sold in the country, and he
took them to the fair, and he sold them; he has got the money in his
chest, and this is the time to be at him, before the people are paid for
their lot of cattle; and unless we go to seek the money at this very
hour, when it is gathered together, <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)
we shall not get the same chance again."

The Shifty Lad was as willing as himself; they went away to the house,
they got in at the coming on of the night, and they went up upon the
loft, <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md) and they went in hiding up
there; and it was the night of SAMHAIN, Halloween; and there assembled
many people within to keep the Savain hearty as they used to do. They
sat together, and they were singing songs, and at fun burning the
nuts; <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md) and at merry-making.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

The Shifty Lad was wearying that the company was not scattering; he got
up and he went down to the byre, and he loosed the bands off the necks
of the cattle, and he returned and he went up upon the loft again. The
cattle began goring each other in the byre, and roaring. All that were
in the room ran to keep the cattle from each other till they could be
tied again; and in the time while they were doing this, the Shifty Lad
went down to the room and he stole the nuts with him, and he went up
upon the loft again, and he lay down at the back of the Black Rogue.

There was a great leathern hide at the back of the Black Rogue, and the
Shifty Lad had a needle and thread, and he sewed the skirt of the Black
Rogue's coat to the leathern hide that was at his back; and when the
people of the house came back to the dwelling room again, their nuts
were away; and they were seeking their nuts; and they thought that it
was some one who had come in to play them a trick that had taken away
their nuts, and they sat down at the side of the fire quietly and
silently.

Said the Shifty Lad to the Black Rogue, "I will crack a nut."

"Thou shalt not crack (one)," said the Black Rogue; "they will hear
thee, and we shall be caught."

Said the Shifty Lad, "I never yet was a Savain night without cracking a
nut," and he cracked one.

Those who were seated in the dwelling-room heard him, and they said,

"There is some one up on the loft cracking our nuts, we will go and
catch them."

When the Black Rogue heard that, he sprang off the loft and he ran out,
and the hide dragging at the tail

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

of his coat. Every one of them shouted that there was the Black Rogue
stealing the hide with him. The Black Rogue fled, and the people of the
house after him; and he was a great distance from the house before he
got the hide torn from him, and (was able) to leave them. But in the
time that the people of the house were running after the Black Rogue,
the Shifty Lad came down off the loft; he went up about the house, he
hit upon the chest where the gold and the silver was; he opened the
chest, and he took out of it the bags in which the gold and silver was,
that was in the chest; and he took with him a load of the bread and of
the butter, and of the cheese, and of everything that was better than
another which he found within; and he was gone before the people of the
house came back from chasing the Black Rogue.

When the Black Rogue reached his home, and he had nothing, his wife said
to him, "How hast thou failed this journey?"

Then the Black Rogue told his own tale; and he was in great fury at the
Shifty Lad, and swearing that he would serve him out when he got a
chance at him.

At the end of a little while after that, the Shifty Lad came in with a
load upon him.

Said the wife of the Black Rogue, "But, I fancy that thou art the better
thief!"

The Black Rogue said not a word till the Shifty Lad shewed the bags that
he had full of gold and silver; then, said the Black Rogue, "But it is
thou that wert the smart lad!"

They made two halves of the gold and silver, and the Black Rogue got the
one half, and the Shifty Lad the other half. When the Black Rogue's wife
saw the share, that came to them, she said, "Thou thyself art the

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

worthy thief!" and she had more respect for him after that, than she had
for the Black Rogue himself.

At the end of a few weeks after that, a wedding was to be in the
neighbourhood; and it was the custom of the country, when any who were
well off were asked, that they should send some gift or other to the
people of the wedding. There was a rich tenant, and he was asked; and he
desired his herd to go to the mountain moor and bring home a wether for
the people of the wedding. The herd went up the mountain and he got the
wether, and he was going home with it; and he had it on his back when he
was going past the house of the Black Rogue.

Said the Shifty Lad to his master, "What wager wilt thou lay that I do
not steal the wether from the back of that man yet, before he reaches
the house."

Said the Black Rogue, "I will lay thee a wager of a hundred marks that
thou canst not; how shouldst thou steal the thing that is on his back!"

"Howsoever I do it, I will try it," said the Shifty Lad.

"Well, then, if thou dost it," said the Black Rogue, "I will give thee a
hundred marks."

"It is a bargain," said the Shifty Lad; and with that he went away after
the herd.

The herd had to go through a wood, and the Shifty Lad took the ground
that was hidden from him until he got before him; and he put some dirt
in his shoe, and he set his shoe on the road before the herd, and he
himself went in hiding; and when the herd came forward, and he saw the
shoe, he said, "But thou art dirty, and though thou art, if thy fellow
were there I would clean thee;" and he went past.

The Shifty Lad lifted the shoe, and he ran round about and he was before
the herd, and he put his other

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

shoe on the road before him. When the herd came forward and saw the
other shoe on the road before him, he said to himself, But there is the
fellow of the dirty shoe."

He set the wether on the ground, and he said to himself, "I will return
back now, and I will get the dirty shoe, and I shall clean it, and I
shall have two good shoes for my trouble;" and he ran swiftly back
again.

The Shifty Lad ran swiftly, and he stole with him the wether, and he
took with him the two shoes; and he went home to his master, and he got
a hundred marks from his master.

The herd went home and he told his own master himself how it had
befallen him. His master scolded the herd; and the next day he sent him
again up the mountain to seek a kid, instead of the wether he had lost.

The herd went away to the hill and he got hold of a kid, and he tied it;
he put it on his back, and he went away to go home with it. The Shifty
Lad saw him, and he went to the wood, and he was there before the herd;
and he went in hiding, and he began at bleating like the wether. The
herd thought that it was the wether that was in it; and he put the kid
off him, and he left it at the side of the road, and he went to seek the
wether. At the time when the herd was seeking the wether, the Shifty Lad
went and he stole the kid with him, and he went home with it to the
Black Rogue.

When the herd went back to where he had left the kid, the kid was gone,
the kid was not in it; he sought the kid, and when he could not find the
kid, he went home and he told his master how it had befallen, him; and
his master scolded him, but there was no help for it.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

On the next day the tenant asked his herd to go up the mountain and
bring home a stot; to be sure that he did not lose it. The herd went up
the mountain, and he got a good fat stot, and he was driving it home.
The. Shifty Lad saw him, and he said to the Black Rogue, "Tiugain, come
along, and we will go and try to steal the stot from the herd when he is
going through the wood with it."

The Black Rogue and the Shifty Lad went away to the wood before the
herd; and when the herd was going through the wood with the stot, the
Black Rogue was in one place baa-ing, and the Shifty Lad in another
bleating like a goat. The herd heard them, and he thought that he would
get the wether and the kid again. He tied the stot to a tree, and went
all about the wood seeking the wether and the kid, and he sought them
till he was tired. While he was seeking the wether and the kid, the
Shifty Lad went, and he stole with him the stot, and he took it home
with him to the house of the Black Rogue. The Black Rogue went home
after him, and they killed the stot, and they put it in hiding, and the
Black Rogue's wife had good puddings for them that night. When the herd
came back to the tree where he had left the stot tied, the stot was not
there. He knew that the stot had been stolen. He went home and he told
his master how it had happened, and his master scolded him, but there
was no help for it.

On the next day his master asked the herd to go up the mountain and to
bring home a wether, and not let it come off his back at all till he
should come home, whatever he might see or hear. The herd went away, and
he went up the mountain and he got the wether, and he succeeded in
taking that wether home.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

The Black Rogue and the Shifty Lad went on stealing till they had got
much money, and they thought that they had better buy a drove (of
cattle) and go to the fair with it to sell, and that people would think
that it was at drovering they had made the money that they had got. The
two went, and they bought a great drove of cattle, and they went to a
fair that was far on the way from them. They sold the drove, and they
got the money for them, and they went away to go home. When they were on
the way, they saw a gallows on the top of a hill, and the Shifty Lad
said to the Black Rogue, "Come up till we see the gallows; some say that
the gallows is the end for the thieves at all, events."

They went up where the gallows was, and they were looking all about it.
Said the Shifty Lad, "Might we not try what kind of death is in the
gallows, that we may know what is before us, if we should be caught at
roguery. I will try it myself first."

The Shifty Lad put the cord about his own neck, and he said to the Black
Rogue, "Here, draw me up, and when I am tired above I will shake my
legs, and then do thou let me down."

The Black Rogue drew the cord, and he raised the Shifty Lad aloft off
the earth, and at the end of a little blink the Shifty Lad shook his
legs, and the Black Rogue let him down.

The Shifty Lad took the cord off his neck, and he said to the Black
Rogue, "Thou thyself hast not ever tried anything that is so funny as
hanging. If thou wouldst try once, thou wouldst have no more fear for
hanging. I was shaking my legs for delight, and thou wouldst shake thy
legs for delight too if thou wert aloft."

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

Said the Black Rogue, "I will try it too, so that I may know what it is
like."

"Do," said the Shifty Lad; "and when thou art tired above, whistle, and
I will let thee down."

The Black Rogue put the cord about his neck, and the Shifty Lad drew him
up aloft; and when the Shifty Lad found that the Black Rogue was aloft
against the gallows, he said to him, "Now, when thou wantest to come
down, whistle, and if thou art well pleased where thou art, shake thy
legs."

When the Black Rogue was a little blink above, he began to shake his
legs and to kick; and the Shifty Lad would say, "Oh! art thou not funny!
art thou not funny I art thou not funny! When it seems to thee that thou
art long enough above whistle."

But the Black Rogue has not whistled yet. The Shifty Lad tied the cord
to the lower end of the tree of the gallows till the Black Rogue was
dead; then he went where he was, and he took the money out of his pouch,
and he said to him, "Now, since thou hast no longer any use for this
money, I will take care of it for thee." And he went away, and he left
the Black Rogue hanging there. Then he went home where was the house of
the Black Rogue, and his wife asked where was his master?

The Shifty Lad said, "I left him where he was, upraised above the
earth."

The wife of the Black Rogue asked and asked him about her man, till at
last he told her, but he said to her, that he would marry her himself.
When she heard that, she cried that the Shifty Lad had killed his
master, and he was nothing but a thief. When the Shifty Lad heard that
he fled. The chase was set after him; but he found means to go in hiding
in a cave, and

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

the chase went past him. He was in the cave all night, and the next day
he went another way, and he found means to fly to Eirinn.

He reached the house of a wright, and he cried at the door, "Let me in."

"Who art thou?" said the wright.

"I am a good wright, if thou hast need of such," said the Shifty Lad.

The wright opened the door, and he let in the Shifty Lad, and the Shifty
Lad began to work at carpentering along with the wright.

When the Shifty Lad was a day or two in their house, he gave a glance
thither and a glance hither about the house, and he said, "O choin! what
a poor house you have, and the king's store-house so near you."

"What of that," said the wright.

"It is," said the Shifty Lad, "that you might get plenty from the king's
store-house if you yourselves were smart enough."

The wright and his wife would say, "They would put us in prison if we
should begin at the like of that."

The Shifty Lad was always saying that they ought to break into the
king's store-house, and they would find plenty in it; but the wright
would not go with him; but the Shifty Lad took with him some of the
tools of the wright, and he went himself and he broke into the king's
store-house, and he took with him a load of the butter and of the cheese
of the king, and he took it to the house of the wright. The things
pleased the wife of the wright well, and she was willing that her own
husband should go there the next night. The wright himself went with his
lad the next night, and

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

they got into the store-house of the king, and they took with them great
loads of each thing that pleased them best of all that was within in the
king's store-house.

But the king's people missed the butter and the cheese and the other
things that had been taken out of the store-house, and they told the
king how it had happened.

The king took the counsel of the Seanagal about the best way of catching
the thieves and the counsel that the Seanagal gave them was that they
should set a hogshead of soft pitch under the hole where they were
coming in. That was done, and the next night the Shifty Lad and his
master went to break into the king's storehouse.

The Shifty Lad put his master in before him, and the master went down
into the soft pitch to his very middle, and he could not get out again.
The Shifty Lad went down, and he put a foot on each of his master's
shoulders, and he put out two loads of the king's butter and of the
cheese at the hole; and at the last time when he was coming out, he
swept the head off his master, and he took the head with him, and he
left the trunk in the hogshead of pitch, and he went home with the
butter and with the cheese, and he took home the head, and he buried it
in the garden.

When the king's people went into the storehouse, they found a body
without a head into the hogshead of pitch; but they could not make out
who it was. They tried if they could find any one at all that could know
him by the clothes, but his clothes were covered with pitch so that they
could not make him out. The king asked the counsel of the Seanagal about
it; and the counsel that the Seanagal gave was, that they should set the
trunk aloft on the points of the spears of the

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

soldiers, to be carried from town to town, to see if they could find any
one at all that would take sorrow for it; or to try if they could hear
any one that would make a painful cry when they should see it; or if
they should not see (one crying) one that should seem about to make a
painful cry when the soldiers should be going past with it. The body was
taken out of the hogshead of pitch, and set on the points of the spears;
and the soldiers were bearing it aloft on the points of their long
wooden spears, and they were going from town to town with it; and when
they were going past the house of the wright, the wright's wife made a
tortured scream, and swift the Shifty Lad cut himself with the adze; and
he kept saying to the wright's wife, "The cut is not so bad as thou
thinkest."

The commander-in-chief, and his lot of soldiers, came in and they asked,

"What ailed the housewife?"

Said the Shifty Lad, "It is that I have just cut my foot with the adze,
and she is afraid of blood;" and he would say to the wife of the wright,
"Do not be so much afraid; it will heal sooner than thou thinkest."

The soldiers thought that the Shifty Lad was the wright, and that the
wife whom they had was the wife of the Shifty Lad; and they went out,
and they went from town to town; but they found no one besides, but the
wife of the wright herself that made cry or scream when they were coming
past her.

They took the body home to the king's house; and the king took another
counsel from his Seanagal, and that was to hang the body to a tree in an
open place, and soldiers to watch it that none should take it away, and
the soldiers to be looking if any should come the way that should take
pity or grief for it.

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

The Shifty Lad came past them, and he saw them; he went and he got a
horse, and he put a keg of whisky on each side of the horse in a sack,
and he went past the soldiers with it, as though he were hiding from
them. The soldiers thought that it was so, that he had taken something
away from them, or that he had something which he ought not to have; and
some of them ran after him and they caught the old horse and the whisky;
but the Shifty Lad fled, and he left the horse and the whisky with them.
The soldiers took the horse and the kegs of whisky back to where the
body was hanging against the mast. They looked what was in the kegs; and
when they understood that it was whisky that was in them, they got a
drinking cup, and they began drinking until at last every one of them
was drunk, and they lay and they slept. When the Shifty Lad saw that,
that the soldiers were laid down and asleep and drunk, he returned and
he took the body off the mast. He set it crosswise on the horse's back,
and he took it home; then he went and he buried the body in the garden
where the head was.

When the soldiers awoke out of their sleep, the body was stolen away;
they had for it but to go and tell it to the king. Then the king took
the counsel of the Seanagal; and the Seanagal said to them, all that
were in his presence, that his counsel to them was, to take out a great
black pig that was there, and that they should go with her from town to
town; and when they should come to any place where the body was buried,
that she would root it up. They went and they got the black pig, and
they were going from farm to farm with her, trying if they could find
out where the body was buried. They went from house to house with her
till at last the came to the house where the

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Shifty Lad and the wright's widow were dwelling.
When they arrived they let the pig loose about the grounds. The Shifty
Lad said that he himself was sure that thirst and hunger was on them;
that they had better go into the house and that they would get meat and
drink; and that they should let their weariness from off them, in the
time when the pig should be seeking about his place.

They went in, and the Shifty Lad asked the wright's widow that she
should set meat and drink before the men. The widow of the wright set
meat and drink on the board, and she set it before them; and in the time
while they were eating their meat, the Shifty Lad went out to see after
the pig; and the pig had just hit upon the body in the garden; and the
Shifty Lad went and he got a great knife and he cut the head off her,
and he buried herself and her head beside the body of the wright in the
garden.

When those who had the care of the pig came out, the pig was not to be
seen. They asked the Shifty Lad if he had seen her; he said that he had
seen (her), that her head was up and she was looking upwards, and going
two or three steps now and again; and they went with great haste to the
side where the Shifty Lad said that the pig had gone.

When the Shifty Lad found that they had gone out of sight, he set
everything in such a way that they should not hit upon the pig. They on
whom the care of the pig was laid went and they sought her every way
that it was likely she might be. Then when they could not find her, they
had nothing for it but to go to the king's house and tell how it had
happened.

Then the counsel of the Seanagal was taken again; and the counsel that
the Seanagal gave them was, that

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

they should set their soldiers out about the country at free quarters;
and at whatsoever place they should get pig's flesh, or in whatsoever
place they should see pig's flesh, unless those people could show how
they had got the pig's flesh that they might have, that those were the
people who killed the pig, and that had done every evil that had been
done.

The counsel of the Seanagal was taken, and the soldiers sent out to free
quarters about the country; and there was a band of them in the house of
the wright's widow where the Shifty Lad was. The wright's widow gave
their supper to the soldiers, and some of the pig's flesh was made ready
for them; and the soldiers were eating the pig's flesh, and praising it
exceedingly. The Shifty Lad understood what was the matter, but he did
not let on. The soldiers were set to lie out in the barn; and when they
were asleep the Shifty Lad went out and he killed them. Then he went as
fast as he could from house to house, where the soldiers were at free
quarters, and he set the rumour afloat <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md) amongst the people of the houses, that the
soldiers had been sent out about the country to rise in the night and
kill the people in their beds; and he found (means) to make the people
of the country believe him, so that the people of each house killed all
the soldiers that were asleep in their barns; and when the soldiers did
not come home at the time they should, some went to see what had
happened to them; and when they arrived, it was so that they found the
soldiers dead in the barns where they had been asleep; and the people of
each house denied that they knew how the soldiers had been put to death,
or who had done it.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

The people who were at the ransacking for the soldiers, went to the
king's house, and they told how it had happened; then the king sent word
for the Seanagal to get counsel from him; the Seanagal came, and the
king told how it had happened, and the king asked counsel from him. This
is the counsel that the Seanagal gave the king, that he should make a
feast and a ball, and invite the people of the country; and if the man
who did the evil should be there, that he was the man who would be the
boldest who would be there, and that he would ask the king's daughter
herself to dance with him. The people were asked to the feast and the
dance; and amongst the rest the Shifty Lad was asked. The people came to
the feast, and amongst the rest came the Shifty Lad. When the feast was
past, the dance began; and the Shifty Lad went and he asked the king's
daughter to dance with him; and the Seanagal had a vial full of black
stuff, and the Seanagal put a black dot of the stuff that was in the
vial on the Shifty Lad. But it seemed to the king's daughter that her
hair was not well enough in order, and she went to a side chamber to put
it right; and the Shifty Lad went in with her; and when she looked in
the glass, he also looked in it, and he saw the black dot that the
Seanagal had put upon him. When they had danced till the tune of music
was finished, the Shifty Lad went and he got a chance to steal the vial
of the Seanagal from him unknown to him, and he put two black dots on
the Seanagal, and one black dot on twenty other men besides, and he put
the vial back again where he found it.

Between that and the end of another while, the Shifty Lad came again and
he asked the king's daughter to dance. The king's daughter had a vial
also, and

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

she put a black dot on the face of the Shifty Lad; but the Shifty Lad
got the vial whipped out of her pocket, unknown to her; and since there
were two black dots on him, he put two dots on twenty other men in the
company, and four black dots on the Seanagal. Then when the dancing was
over, some were sent to see who was the man on whom were the two black
dots, When they looked amongst the people, they found twenty men on whom
there were two black dots, and there were four black dots on the
Seanagal; and the Shifty Lad found (means) to go swiftly where the
king's daughter was, and to slip the vial back again into her pocket.
The Seanagal looked and he had his black vial; the king's daughter
looked and she had her own vial; then the Seanagal and the king took
counsel; and the last counsel that they made was that the king should
come to the company, and say, that the man who had done every trick that
had been done, must be exceedingly clever; if he would come forward and
give himself up, that he should get the king's daughter to marry, and
the one half of the kingdom while the king was alive, and the whole of
the kingdom after the king's death. And every one of those who had the
two black dots on their faces came and they said that it was they who
had done every cleverness that had been done. Then the king and his high
council went to try how the matter should be settled; and the matter
which they settled was, that all the men who had the two black dots on
their faces should be put together in a chamber, and they were to get a
child, and the king's daughter was to give an apple to the child, and
the child was to be put in where the men with the two black dots on
their faces were seated and to whatsoever one the child

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

should give the apple, that was the one who was to get the king's
daughter.

That was done, and when the child went into the chamber in which the men
were, the Shifty Lad had a shaving and a drone (sliseag us dranndan),
and the child went and gave him the apple. Then the shaving and the
drone were taken from the Shifty Lad, and he was seated in another
place, and the apple was given to the child again; and he was taken out
of the chamber, and sent in again to see to whom he would give the
apple; and since the Shifty Lad had the shaving and the drone before,
the child went where he was again, and he gave him the apple. Then the
Shifty Lad got the king's daughter to marry.

And shortly after that the king's daughter and the Shifty Lad were
taking a walk to Baile Cliabh; and when they were going over the bridge
of Baile Cliabh, the Shifty Lad asked the king's daughter what was the
name of that place; and the king's daughter told him that it was the
bridge of Baile Cliabh, in Eirinn; and the Shifty Lad said--

"Well, then, many is the time that my mother said to me, that my end
would be to be hanged at the bridge of Baile Cliabh, in Eirinn; and she
made me that prophecy many a time when I might play her a trick."

And the king's daughter said, "Well then, if thou thyself shouldst
choose to hang over the little side (wall) of the bridge, I will hold
thee aloft a little space with my pocket napkin."

And they were at talk and fun about it; but at last it seemed to the
Shifty Lad that he would do it for sport, and the king's daughter took
out her pocket napkin, and the Shifty Lad went over the bridge, and he
hung by the pocket napkin of the king's daughter

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

as she let it over the little side (wall) of the, bridge, and they were
laughing to each other.

But the king's daughter heard a cry, "The king's castle is going on
fire!" and she started, and she lost her hold of the napkin; and the
Shifty Lad fell down, and his head struck against a stone, and the brain
went out of him; and there was in the cry but the sport of children; and
the king's daughter was obliged to go home a widow.

From Kate Macfarlane, in or near the year 1810; A. Campbell, Roseneath,
1860; and J. M'Nair, Clachaig, 1860.

 

Some incidents in this story I have known as long as I can remember.
They used to be told me as a child by John Campbell, piper. Some of them
were told me in 1859 by John Mackenzie at Inverary, who said they were
part of a long story of which he could not repeat the rest. Others are
alluded to in the Sutherland collection as known in that county. The
version given came to me with the pedigree given above, and is
unaltered, except in orthography and punctuation here and there.

It may be compared with a very great many stories in many languages, but
I know none exactly like it. (See note on No. 40, Vol. ii.)

Some of the incidents are very like part of the story of Rampsintus
(Rawlinson's Herodotus, Vol. ii. p. 191), which were told to Herodotus
more than two thousand years ago by priests in Egypt, and the most
natural conclusion to arrive at is, that these incidents have been
spread amongst the people by those members of their families who study
the classics at the Scotch universities, and who might well repeat what
they had learned over a winter fire in their father's cottages, as their
share of a night's entertainment.

But the incidents of this story, which resemble the classical tale, are
associated with a great many other incidents which are not in Herodotus.
Some of these have a resemblance to incidents in the Norse story of "The
Master Thief;" and, according to Mr. Dasent's introduction, these have a
resemblance to Sanscrit stories which are not within my reading. They
have a relation to Italian stories in Straparola, and, according to a
note in Rawlinson's Herodotus, the: story of Rampsintus "has been
repeated in the Pecorone of Ser Giovanni, a Florentine of the

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

fourteenth century, who substitutes a Doge of Venice for the king."

I am told that the barrel of pitch and the marks on the men are
introduced into an old German story; but there are several incidents
such as that of the pig which was to discover the dead body, as pigs now
do truffles, and the apple which as usual is mystical, which so far as I
know are in Gaelic only.

On the whole, then, there seems to me nothing for it but to admit this
to be the Gaelic version of a popular tale, traditionally preserved for
ages, altering as times roll on, and suiting itself to the manners of
the narrators of the time.

To suppose it to be derived from books is to suppose that these books
have all been read at some time so widely in Scotland as to have become
known to the labouring population who speak Gaelic, and so long ago as
to have been forgotten by the instructed, who speak English and study
foreign languages.

Either this is a traditional popular tale, or learning must have been
much more widely spread in the west at some former period than it is at
present.

My own opinion is that the tale is traditional, but there is room enough
for speculation. On the 25th and 27th of August, I heard parts of the
story told by Dewar, and MacNair, and John Mackenzie. Hector Urquhart
told me that his father used to tell it in Ross-shire when he was a
child. In his version, the storehouse was a treasury full of gold and
silver, and the entrance a loose stone in the wall; the man was caught
in "CEP," a gin for catching foxes. The pig was a hungry boar, and the
lad killed him with an arrow. Even John the tinker, who was present,
knew the story, though not well enough to repeat it. It is manifestly
widely spread in the Highlands.

The Gaelic is somewhat peculiar, and there are some errors in it which
have not been corrected.

A party of young people would collect together in one house for to make
merry; one of their amusements was, they would propose a marriage
between some lad and lass, and they would name a nut for each of them.
The two nuts would be placed beside each other in the fire. If the two
nuts burned together, and blazed over each other, that was called a good
omen; it was a sign that the party for whom the nuts was named were to
be married yet, and live happy together; but if either of the nuts
puffed, or flew away, that was a sign that the person for whom that nut
was named was proud, and would not accept of the other party.
