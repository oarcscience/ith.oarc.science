### MAOL A CHLIOBAIN.

From Ann MacGilvray, Islay.

THERE was a widow ere now, and she had three daughters; and they said to
her that they would go to seek their fortune. She baked three bannocks.
She said to the big one, "Whether dost thou like best the half and my
blessing, or the big half and my curse?" "I like best," said she, "the
big half and thy curse." She said to the middle one, "Whether dost thou
like best the big half and my curse, or the, little half and my
blessing?" "I like best," said she, "the big half and thy curse." She
said to the little one, "Whether dost thou like best the big half and my
curse, or the little half and my blessing?" "I like best the little half
and thy blessing." This pleased her mother, and she gave her the two
other halves also. They went away, but the two eldest did not want the
youngest to be with them, and they tied her to a rock of stone. They
went on, but her mother's blessing came and freed her. And when they
looked behind them, whom did they see but her with the rock on top of
her. They let her alone a turn of a while, till they reached a peat
stack, and they tied her to the peat stack. They went on a bit (but her
mother's blessing came and freed her), and they looked behind them, and
whom did they see but her coming, and the peat

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

stack on the top of her. They let her alone a turn of a while, till they
reached a tree, and they tied her to the tree. They went on a bit (but
her mother's blessing came and freed her), and when they looked behind
them, whom did they see but her, and the tree on top of her.

They saw it was no good to be at her; they loosed her, and let her
(come) with them. They were going till night came on them. They saw a
light a long way from them; and though a long way from them, it was not
long that they were in reaching it. They went in. What was this but a
giant's house! They asked to stop the night. They got that, and they
were put to bed with the three daughters of the giant. (The giant came
home, and he said, "The smell of the foreign girls is within.") There
were twists of amber knobs about the necks of the giant's daughters, and
strings of horse hair about their necks. They all slept, but Maol a
Chliobain did not sleep. Through the night a thirst came on the giant.
He called to his bald, rough-skinned gillie to bring him water. The
rough-skinned gillie said that there was not a drop within. Kill," said
he, "one of the strange girls, and bring to me her blood." How will I
know them?" said the bald, rough-skinned gillie. "There are twists of
knobs of amber about the necks of my daughters, and twists of horse hair
about the necks of the rest."

Maol a Chliobain heard the giant, and as quick as she could she put the
strings of horse hair that were about her own neck and about the necks
of her sisters about the necks of the giant's daughters; and the knobs
that were about the necks of the giant's daughters about her own neck
and about the necks of her sisters;

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

and she laid down so quietly. The bald, rough-skinned gillie came, and
he killed one of the daughters of the giant, and he took the blood to
him. He asked for MORE to be brought him. He killed the next. He asked
for MORE; and he killed the third one.

Maol a Chliobain awoke her sisters, and she took them with her on top of
her, and she took to going. (She took with her a golden cloth that was
on the bed, and it called out.)

The giant perceived her, and he followed her. The sparks of fire that
she was putting out of the stones with her heels, they were striking the
giant on the chin; and the sparks of fire that the giant was bringing
out of the stones with the points of his feet, they were striking Maol a
Chliobain in the back of the head. It is this was their going till they
reached a river. (She plucked a hair out of her head and made a bridge
of it, and she run over the river, and the giant could not follow her.)
Maol a Chliobain leaped the river, but the river the giant could not
leap.

"Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain." "I am, though it is hard for
thee." "Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters." "I killed them,
though it is hard for thee." "And when wilt thou come again?" "I will
come when my business brings me."

They went on forward till they reached the house of a farmer. The farmer
had three sons. They told how it happened to them. Said the farmer to
Maol a Chliobain, "I will give my eldest son to thy eldest sister, and
get for me the fine comb of gold, and the coarse comb of silver that the
giant has." "It will cost thee no more," said Maol a Chliobain.

She went away; she reached the house of the giant; she got in unknown;
she took with her the combs,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

and out she went. The giant perceived her, and after her he was till
they reached the river. She leaped the river, but the river the giant
could not leap. "Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain." "I am, though
it is hard for thee." "Thou killedst my three bald brown daughters." "I
killed them, though it is hard for thee." "Thou stolest my fine comb of
gold, and my coarse comb of silver." "I stole them, though it is hard
for thee." "When wilt thou come again?" "I will come when my business
brings me."

She gave the combs to the farmer, and her big sister and the farmer's
big son married. "I will give my middle son to thy middle sister, and
get me the giant's glave of light." "It will cost thee no more," said
Maol a Chliobain. She went away, and she reached the giant's house; she
went up to the top of a tree that was above the giant's well. In the
night came the bald rough-skinned gillie with the sword of light to
fetch water. When he bent to raise the water, Maol a Chliobain came down
and she pushed him down in the well and she drowned him, and she took
with her the glave of light.

The giant followed her till she reached the river; she leaped the river,
and the giant could not follow her. "Thou art over there, Maol a
Chliobain." "I am, if it is hard for thee." "Thou killedst my three bald
brown daughters." "I killed, though it is hard for thee." "Thou stolest
my fine comb of gold, and my coarse comb of silver." "I stole, though it
is hard for thee." "Thou killedst my bald rough-skinned gillie." "I
killed, though it is hard for thee." "Thou stolest my glave of light."
"I stole, though it is hard for thee." "When wilt thou come again?" "I
will come when my business brings me." She reached

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

the house of the farmer with the glave of light; and her middle sister
and the middle son of the farmer married. "I will give thyself my
youngest son," said the farmer, "and bring me a buck that the giant
has." "It will cost thee no more," said Maol a Chliobain. She went away,
and she reached the house of the giant; but when she had hold of the
buck, the giant caught her. "What," said the giant, "wouldst thou do to
me: if I had done as much harm to thee as thou hast done to me, I would
make thee burst thyself with milk porridge; I would then put thee in a
pock! I would hang thee to the roof-tree; I would set fire under thee;
and I would set on thee with clubs till thou shouldst fall as a faggot
of withered sticks on the floor." The giant made milk porridge, and he
made her drink it. She put the milk porridge about her mouth and face,
and she laid over as if she were dead. The giant put her in a pock, and
he hung her to the roof-tree; and he went away, himself and his men, to
get wood to the forest. The giant's mother was within. When the giant
was gone, Maol a Chliobain began--"’Tis I am in the light! ’Tis I am in
the city of gold!" "Wilt thou let me in?" said the carlin. "I will not
let thee in." At last she let down the pock. She put in the carlin, cat,
and calf, and cream-dish. She took with her the buck and she went away.
When the giant came with his men, himself and his men began at the bag
with the clubs. The carlin was calling, "’Tis myself that's in it." "I
know that thyself is in it," would the giant say, as he laid on to the
pock. The pock came down as a faggot of sticks, and what was in it but
his mother. When the giant saw how it was, he took after Maol a
Chliobain; he followed her till she reached the river.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Maol a Chliobain leaped the river, and the giant
could not leap it. "Thou art over there, Maol a Chliobain." "I am,
though it is hard for thee." "Thou killedst my three bald brown
daughters." "I killed, though it is hard for thee." "Thou stolest, my
golden comb; and my silver comb." "I stole, though it is hard for thee."
"Thou killedst my bald rough-skinned gillie." "I killed, though it is
hard for thee." "Thou stolest my glave of light." "I stole, though it is
hard for thee." "Thou killedst my mother." "I killed, though it is hard
for thee." "Thou stolest my buck." "I stole, though it is hard for
these." "When wilt thou come again?" "I will come when my business
brings me." "If thou wert over here, and I yonder," said the giant, what
wouldst thou do to follow me?" "I would stick myself down, and I would
drink till I should dry the river." The giant stuck himself down, and he
drank till he burst. Maol a Chliobain and the farmer's youngest son
married.

This story came to me from four sources. First, the one which I hare
translated, into which several passages are introduced (in brackets)
from the other versions. This was written down by Hector MacLean.

2d. A version got by the same collector from Flora Macintyre, in Islay;
received June 16, 1859. In this the whole of the first part is omitted;
it begins at the giant's house. The incidents are then nearly the same
till she runs away, when she leaps the river with her sisters under her
arms. The farmer or king is omitted. She returns, is caught by the
giant, tied to a peat-stack, and a rock, which she takes away, and she
makes the giant kill; the three cropped red girls: and she kills the
cropped rough-skinned gillie: she steals the white glave of light, a
fine comb of gold, and a coarse comb of silver. She makes the giant kill
his mother, and his dog and cat enticed into a sack; at last she sets
the giant to swill the river; he bursts, and she goes home with the
spoil. The bit about the sack is worth quoting. She put the crone in the
pock, and a cat, and a dog, and a cream-dish with her. When the giant
and his men came, they began laying on the pock. The crone cried out,
"It's myself thou hast;" and the giant said, "I know, thou she rogue,
that it's thou." When they would strike a stroke on the dog, he would
give out a SGOL; when they would strike a stroke on the cat, he would
give out a MIOG; and when they would strike a stroke on the cream-dish,
it would give Out a STEALL (a spurt). I have,

3rd. A version very prettily told, at Easter 1859, by a young girl,
nursemaid to Mr. Robertson, Chamberlain of Argyll, at Inverary. It was
nearly the same as the version translated, but had several phrases well
worth preservation, some of which will be found in brackets; such as,
"but her mother's blessing came and freed her." The heroine also stole a
golden cover off the bed, which called out; and a golden cock and a
silver hen, which also called out. The end of the giant was thus: At the
end of the last scolding match, the giant said, "If thou wert

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

here, and I yonder, what wouldst thou do?" "I would follow thee over the
bridge," said she. So Maol a chliobain stood on the bridge, and she
reached out a stick to him, and he went down into the river, and she let
go the stick, and he was drowned. "And what become of Maol a chliobain?
did she marry the farmer's youngest son?" "Oh, no; she did not marry at
all. There was something about a key hid under a stone, and a great deal
more which I cannot remember. My father did not like my mother to be
telling us such stories, but she knows plenty more,"--and the lassie
departed in great perturbation from the parlour.

The 4th version was got by John Dewar from John Crawfort,
herring-fisher, Lochlonghead, Arrochar, and was received on the 2d of
February 1860. Dewar's version is longer than any, but it came too late.
It also contains some curious phrases which the others have not got,
some queer old Gaelic words, and some new adventures. The heroine was
not only the youngest, but "maol carrach" into the bargain, and the rest
called her Maol a Mhoibean; but when they went on their travels she
chose the little cake and the blessing. The others tied her to a tree,
and a cairn of stones, which she dragged away. Then they let her loose,
and she followed them till they came to a burn. "Then the eldest sister
stooped to drink a draught from the burn, and there came a small
creature, named Bloinigain, and he dabbled and dirtied the burn, and
they went on. The next burn they came to the two eldest sisters stooped,
one on each side of the burn, to drink a draught; but Bloinigain came
and he dabbled and dirtied the burn; and when they had gone on another
small distance, they reached another burn; and the youngest sister, whom
the rest used to call Maol a Mhoibean, was bent down drinking a draught
from the burn, and Bloinigain came and stood at the side of the burn
till she had drank her draught, and the other two came; but when they
stooped to drink their draught, Bloinigain dabbled the burn, and they
went on; and when they came to another burn, the two eldest were almost
parched with thirst. Maol a Mhoibean kept Bloinigain back till the
others got a drink; and then she tossed Bloinigain heels over head, CAR
A MHUILTEAN, into a pool, and he followed them no wore."

This Bloinigain plays a great part in another story, sent by

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Dewar; and his name may perhaps mean "fatty;"
BLONAG, fat, suet, lard; BLOINIGEAN-GARAIDH, is spinnage.

The next adventure is almost the very same. The giant's three red-haired
polled daughters had PAIDIREANAN of gold about their necks (which word
*may* be derived from *pater*, and a name for a rosary), and the others
had only strings.

When they fled they came to a great EAS, cataract, and there was no way
of getting over it, unless they could walk on two hairs that were as a
bridge across the cataract; and their name was DROCHAID AN DA ROINEAG,
the two-hair bridge; and Maol a Mhoibean ran over the eas on the two
hairs; but her sisters could not walk on the two hairs, and Maol a
Mhoibean had to turn back and carry her sisters, one after one, over the
eas on the two-hair bridge." The giant could not cross, and they scolded
each other, across the river as in the other stories. The giant shouted,
"Art thou yonder, Maol a Mhoibean?" and she said "AIR MO NODAIG THA;"
and when she had told her deeds, she said, "I will come and go as my
business brings me;" and the three sisters went on and took service with
the king.

This two-hair bridge over the fall may possibly be a double rainbow;
many a time have I sat and watched such a bridge over a fall; and the
idea that the rainbow was the bridge of spirits, is old enough.

"Still seem as to my childhood's sight  
  A midway station given,  
For happy spirits to alight  
  Betwixt the earth and heaven."

The Norse gods rode over the bridge, Bif-raust, from earth to heaven;
and their bridge was the rainbow which the giants could not cross. There
is also a bridge, as fine as a hair, over which the Moslem pass to
Paradise; and those who are not helped, fall off and are lost.

The sisters took service; one was engaged to sew, the other to mind the
house, and the youngest said she was good at running errands; so at the
end of a day and year she was sent for the giant's CABHRAN full of gold,
and CABHRAN full of silver; and when she got there the giant was asleep
on a chest in which the treasure was.

Then Maol a Mhoibean thought a while, in what way she should get the
giant put off the chest; but she was not long till

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

she thought on a way; and she got a long broad bench that was within,
and she set the bench at the side of the chest where the giant was laid;
she went out where the burn was, and she took two cold stones from the
burn, and she went in where the giant was, and she would put one of the
stones in under the clothes, and touch the giant's skin at the end of
each little while with the stone; and the giant would lay himself back
from her, till bit by bit the giant went back off the chest on to the
bench; and then Maol a Mhoibean opened the chest, and took with her the
cabhran of gold, and the cabhran of silver." The rest of the adventure
is nearly the same as in the other versions; and the eldest sister
married the king's eldest son.

The next was the Claidheamh Geal Soluis, white glave of light.

She got in and sat on a rafter on a bag of salt; and as the giant's wife
made the porridge, she threw in salt. Then the giant and his son sat and
supped, and as they ate they talked of how they would catch Maol, and
what they would do to her when they had her; and after supper they went
to bed. Then the giant got very thirsty, and he called to his son to get
him a drink; and in the time that the giant's son was seeking a CUMAN
(cup), Maol a Mhoibeau took with her the fill of her SGUIRD (skirt) of
salt, and she stood at the outside of the door; and the giant's son said
to him "that there was no water within;" and the giant said "That the
spring was not far off, and that he should bring in water from the
well;" and when the giant's son opened the door, Maol a Mhoibean began
to throw salt in his face; and he said to the giant, "That the night was
dark, and that it was sowing and winnowing hailstones (GUN ROBH AN
OIDHCHE DORCHA AGUS CUR'S CABRADH CLACH-A-MEALLAIN ANN);" and the giant
said, "Take with thee my white glave of light, and thou wilt see a great
distance before thee, and a long way behind thee."

When the young giant came out, it was a fine night; and be went to the
well with the bright sword, and laid it down beside him; while he
stooped to take up the water, Maol followed him, and picked up the
sword, and SGUIDS I AN CEANN, she whisked the head off the giant's son.
Then came the flight and pursuit, and escape, and scolding match, and
the second son of the king married the second sister.

The next adventure was the theft of BOC CLUIGEANACH, the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

back with lumps of tangled hair and mud dangling about him. She went
over the bridge and into the goats' house, and the goats began at
BEUCHDAICH, roaring; and the giant said, "Maol a Mhoibean is amongst the
goats;" and he went out and caught her; and he said, "What wouldst thou
do to me if thou shouldst find me amongst thy goats, as I found thee?"
And she said, "It is (this) that I would kill the best buck that I might
have, and I would take out the paunch, and I would put thee in the
paunch, and I would hang thee up till I should go to the wood; and I
would get clubs of elder, and then I would come home, AGUS SHLACAINN GU
BAS THU, and I would belabour thee to death." "And that is what I will
do thee," said the giant.

Then comes the bit which is common to several other stories, in various
shapes; and which is part of a story in Straparola.

When she was hung up in the goat's paunch, and the giant gone for his
elder-wood clubs, Maol a Mhoibean began to say to the giant's wife, "Oh!
it's I that am getting the brave sight! Oh! it's I that am getting the
brave sight!" as she swayed herself backwards and forwards; and the
giant's wife would say to her, "Wilt thou let me in a little while?" and
Maol a Mhoibean would say (I will) *not let* (thee in) CHA LEIG, and so
on till the wife was enticed into the paunch, and then Maol took the
belled buck and went away with him. "AGUS AN UAIR A' B AIRD ISE B' ISLE
EASAN, S' AN NUAIR A B' AIRD ASAN B' ISLE ISE;" and the time she was
highest he was lowest, and the time he was highest she was lowest, till
they reached the two-hair bridge. The giant came home and belaboured his
wife to death, and every blow he struck, the wife would say, "IS MI
FHEIN A THA ANN, O 'S MI FHEIN A THA ANN--It is myself that is in it:
Oh! it is myself that is in it;" and the giant would say, "I know it is
thyself that is in it."

\[And in this the giant is like the water-horse in another story, and
like the cyclop in the Odyssey, and like all other giants throughout
mythology. He was a great, strong, blundering fool, and his family were
as stupid as himself.\]

Maol married the king's third son, and the king said, "There is one
other thing yet of what the giant has that I want, and that is, A SGIATH
BHALLABHREAC AGUS A BHOGHA S A DHORLACH--his lumpy bumby shield, and his
bow and his quiver, or in poetical language, his variegated bossy
shield, and his bow and quiver--and I will give thee the kingdom if thou
wilt get me them."

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

\[paragraph continues\] This is a good instance of what may happen in
translating Gaelic into English, one language into another, which is far
removed from it, both in construction and meaning. BHALLABHREAC applies
to almost anything that is round or spotted. The root of the epithet is
BALL, which, in oblique cases, becomes BHALL, vall, and means a spot, a
dot, and many other things. It is the same as the English word ball. A
shield was round, and covered with knobs; a city wall was round, and it
was the shield of the town; an egg was round, and the shell was the
shield or the wall of the egg; a skull is round, and the shield of the
brain, and a head is still called a knob in English slang; a toad-stool
is round,--and so this word ball has given rise to a succession of
words, which at first sight appear to have nothing to do with each
other, and the phrase *might* be translated speckled-wings. The epithet
is applied to clouds and to many things in Gaelic poetry, and has been
translated in many ways, according to the taste of each translator.
Those who felt the beauty of the passages used the words which they
found applicable. Those who do not, may, if they choose, search out
words which express their feeling; and so a poem which stands on its own
merit, in its own language, is at the mercy of every translator; and
those who work at Gaelic with dictionaries for guides, may well be
puzzled with the multitude of meanings assigned to words.

So Maol went, and the giant's dog barked at her, and the giant came out
and caught her, and said he would cut her head off; and she said she
would have done worse to him; and "What was that? Put him in sack and
roast him so he said he would do that, and put her in, and went for
wood. She got her hand out, untied the string, and put in the dog and
cat, and fled with the arms, and the giant roasted his own dog and cat,
AGUS BHA AM MADADH AN 'S AN SGALAILLE AGUS AN CAT ANNS AN SGIABHUIL--and
the dog was in, and the squalling; and the cat (was) in, and the
squalling, and the giant would say, "FEUCH RUIT A NIS--"Try thyself
now." When he found out the trick, he pursued, and when they got to the
bridge, his hand was on her back, and he missed his step and fell into
the EAS, and there he lay. And the king's son and Maol a Mhoibean were
made heirs in the kingdom, and if they wanted any more of the giant's
goods, they got it without the danger of being caught by the giant.

The Gaelic given in Dewar's version is spelt as it came, and is

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

somewhat Phonetic. The writer knows his own language well, but has had
very little practice in writing it. As he spells in some degree by ear,
his phonetics have their value, as they have in his English letter given
in the introduction.

5\. A gentleman at the inn at Inverary remembered to have heard a
similar story "long ago about a witch that would be running in and out
of a window on a bridge of a single hair."

6\. "Kate ill Pratts" is referred to in a review of Chambers' Nursery
Rhymes, at page 117, vol. 10; 1853--Tait's Edinburgh Magazine. The story
is mentioned as told in Perthshire, and seems to be of the same kind;
with a bit of Cinderella, as known in the west, with the advice of the
hoodie in Murchadh and Mionachag put in the mouth of a little bird--

"Stuff wi' fog, and clem wi' clay,  
And then ye'll carry the water away."

These sounds are not imitations of any bird's note, and the Gaelic
sounds are; so I am inclined to think the Gaelic older than the low
country version.

The story is well known as Little Thumb. It is much the same as Boots
and the Troll, Norse Tales, p. 247. It is somewhat like part of Jack and
the Bean-stalk. Part of it is like Big Peter and Little Peter, Norse
Tales, p. 395; and that is like some German Stories, and like a story in
Straparola. The opening is like that of a great many Gaelic Stories, and
is common to one or two in Grimm.

There is something in a story from Polynesia, which I have read, in
which a hero goes to the sky on a ladder made of a plant, and brings
thence precious gifts, much as Jack did by the help of his bean-stalk.
In short, this story belongs to that class which is common to all the
world, but it has its own distinctive character in the Highlands; for
the four versions which I have, resemble each other much more than they
do any other of which I know anything.
