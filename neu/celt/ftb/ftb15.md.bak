EHIND the town of Morlaix there is a beautiful glen which shelters many
fine farms where cattle are bred and corn is grown. Here, long ago, one
of the largest of these farms was tenanted by a good man whose name was
Jalm. His only child, Barbaïk, was a girl whose beauty was the boast of
the countryside. Her face was lovely as a June rose, and her figure had
all the charm of glowing youth and grace. And she was considered the
best dancer and the daintiest heiress in all that broad country.

On Sundays, when she went to St. Mathew's church, she wore an
embroidered cap, and a kerchief with large flowers on it. And she had
five skirts, worn one above the other. Some of the old wives shook their
heads as she went by and asked if she had sold the black hen to Old Nick
and had thus gotten by uncanny means both beauty and fine clothes.

But Barbaïk, who really was rather vain, cared nothing for what they
said so long as she knew that she was the best

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

dressed girl in the parish and the one after whom the lads ran. For that
is what always happens. The hearts of young men are like wisps of straw
hanging on a bush, and the beauty of maids is like the wind that carries
them along in its train.

Among Barbaïk's suitors there was one who loved her more than all the
others. He was her father's farm hand, Jegu, a steadfast and upright
Christian. But, alas, he was as rough as a Northerner and as ugly as a
tailor. Barbaïk would not listen to him in spite of all his merits. She
always laughed and spoke of him as "the country bumpkin."

But Jegu loved her with all his heart. He bore all her insults and
allowed himself to be badly treated by the girl who made joy and grief
for him.

Now one evening as he was bringing his horses back from the pasture he
stopped at a quiet pool to let them drink. He stood near the smaller
horse, his head fallen on his breast. From time to time he would heave a
sigh, for he was thinking of Barbaïk. Suddenly a voice spoke to him,
seemingly coming from the reeds that grew by the edge of the pool.

"Jegu, why are you grieving so?" the voice inquired. "You are not done
for yet."

The ploughman was very much astonished you may be sure. He raised his
head and looking about him asked, "Who are you?"

"I am the hobgoblin of the pool," the voice replied.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

"But I cannot see you," replied Jegu.

"Look carefully into the reeds and you will see me," the voice answered.
"I am disguised as a green frog. I can take any form I wish. And I can
make myself invisible."

"Can you show yourself to me in the form that your race usually takes?"
asked Jegu.

"I can if you wish," said the voice.

As it spoke a green frog hopped onto the back of one of the horses. It
rested there a moment and then suddenly changed into a beautiful little
gnome. He was dressed in apple green and was wearing shiny gaiters for
all the world like a leather dealer.

Jegu felt some alarm and drew back a step or two. "Why are you afraid,
Jegu?" said the green gnome with a smile. "I will not do you harm; on
the contrary, I wish to help you."

"But why do you wish to help me?" asked the ploughman rather
suspiciously.

"On account of a good turn you did me last winter," said the hobgoblin.
"Did you know that the elves of the white corn country declared war on
our race?" continued the hobgoblin. "They accused us of helping mankind.
And we were obliged to turn ourselves into animals in order to hide.
Since then we often take these forms to amuse ourselves. That is how I
came to know you last winter."

"How was that?" asked Jegu.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

"Do you remember one day when you were ploughing the alder-field you
found a poor little redbreast caught in a snare?" asked the hobgoblin.

"Yes," answered Jegu, "and I even remember what I said: it was 'You do
not eat the corn of Christian folk, so take your flight, bird of
Heaven.'"

"Well I was that bird!" the hobgoblin continued. "And at that time I
swore to be your friend. And I am going to prove it to you now by
helping you to marry Barbaïk."

"Oh, dear little hobgoblin, if you succeed in doing that I shall never
refuse you anything, except my soul!" Jegu replied eagerly.

"Let us arrange it all," the gnome said, "and in a few months' time you
will be the master of the farm and the husband of Barbaïk."

"And how will you manage that?" asked the youth.

"You will know that later on," replied the hobgoblin. "Go on smoking
your pipe; eat, drink, and do not worry."

Jegu said that would be easy enough and that he could obey the pixie's
orders. Then Jegu thanked the little green man and took off his bat just
as he did to the mayor or the priest. After which he led his horses
home.

 

The next day was Sunday, but Barbaïk got up at the usual early hour, for
it was her duty to look after the stables.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Imagine her
surprise when she found that some one had already filled the mangers and
milked the cows. She remembered that she had said, on the evening before
to Jegu, that she wanted to be ready so as to go to a dance at the
Pardon of St. Nicolas. So, when she found the cows milked and the
mangers filled, she thought it was Jegu who had done it, and she thanked
him. He answered gruffly that he did not know what she meant, but the
way he said it made her think all the more it had been be who had done
the work.

After that some kind turn was done for her every day. Never had the
stable been so clean nor the cows so plump. Every morning and evening
Barbaïk found her jars full of milk, and a pound of butter freshly
churned and decorated with a blackberry leaf lying on the table. This
meant that now she did not have to get up till broad daylight, just in
time to tidy up the house and get the breakfast.

Sometimes even this work was done for her. One morning when she arose
she found the house swept and clean, the furniture polished, the soup
boiling on the fire, and the bread cut up and put in the bowls; so that
all she had to do was to walk as far as the barn door and call the men
in from the field.

She imagined it was a kind attention of Jegu's, and she could not help
thinking that he would be a very convenient husband for a woman fond of
taking things easy, even if he were a country bumpkin.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

In fact the heiress had only to express a wish in Jegu's hearing and it
would be fulfilled at once. If the wind were too cold or the sun too hot
and she was afraid of spoiling her complexion, she would say, "I should
like to see my churn clean and in its place, and my water jugs full of
fresh water and covered with fresh linen." Then she would go off to have
a chat with her neighbor and when she came back there would be her
churns and water jugs standing on the cool flag just as she wished them.

If the rye bread were too heavy to knead, and the oven slow in heating
she had only to murmur, "Oh! I wish my fifteen pound loaves were in a
row on the bread shelf!" and behold! when next she came into the
kitchen, the loaves would be ready for her, beautifully baked.

Again, if the market seemed too far away, and the road so full of ruts
that driving was hard, she had only to say the evening before so that
Jegu could hear her, "If I were only back home from Morlaix with my milk
jar empty, my butter dish in the bottom of it, a pound of ripe cherries
on the wooden plate and a silver piece in my apron pocket!" Next morning
she would get up and find the empty milk jar with the butter dish in the
bottom of it, the pound of ripe cherries on the wooden plate, and a
glittering silver piece in her apron pocket.

These happenings did not stop here. For if she wanted to send word to
another girl to go with her to Morlaix to buy

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

a few yards of ribbon, or if she wanted to know at what time the
procession was to set out from the church she had only to say the word
and it would happen at once. And it seemed always to be Jegu who was the
cause of it.

So she began to imagine that she could not live without the country
bumpkin. She needed him for work and for play; he was her faithful dog
and her guardian angel, she thought.

At last the hobgoblin advised Jegu to ask for her hand and this time
Barbaïk gave heed to his wooing. She thought him far from handsome, and
clumsy as a lover, but as a husband he would do very well. He would
manage all the work and she could sleep late as did the town lady, and
wear fine clothes and spend her time on her neighbor's doorstep with her
hands folded in her lap. And she would continue to dance at all the
Pardons. She imagined that Jegu would be like the horse obliged to drag
the cart, while she would be the proud driver perched high on her bundle
of bay, making her nag jog along to the flick of her whip. So while Jegu
talked she pictured to herself the rosy future. Then she answered him as
a well-brought-up heiress is bound to make answer to her suitor. She
said she would do as her father wished. But she knew that Jalm would
consent, for her father had said more than once that Jegu would make a
fine manager for the farm.

So, in the course of the next month, they were married.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It seemed as
though the old farmer were only waiting for that event before taking his
leave of this world, for he died a few days after the wedding, leaving
the farm to the young couple.

It was a heavy burden for Jegu, but the good little hobgoblin came to
his assistance. The gnome did the ploughing, and he accomplished as much
work as four ordinary hired men. It was the gnome who kept the tools and
the harness in repair, and he always told Jegu the best time for sowing
the grain and for the reaping.

If Jegu had any work that must be finished at once the little green
gnome would quickly bring his friends to help. All the pixies would come
either with pitchforks, or hoes, or reaping-hooks on their shoulders,
and the work would be done in no time.

When Jegu was short of horses the hobgoblin would tell him to go to one
of the pixie towns out on the heath and to say, "Little friends, lend me
a team of horses and everything they need for ploughing," and the team
would appear in less time than takes the telling.

And, most surprising of all, the hobgoblin of the pool asked in payment
for all these deeds only as much pudding each day as would fill the old
dipper.

Jegu was grateful to the hobgoblin and loved him as his own son. But
Barbaïk hated the gaitered imp. She had her own reasons for that. For
beginning the very day after

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

her marriage, to her astonishment, no one helped her any longer with her
work. And when she complained to Jegu about it he did not seem to
understand her.

But the gnome, who was near, overheard her lament and burst out
laughing. He then confessed to her with grins that he had done all the
kind deeds in order to make her agree to marry Jegu. Now, however, he
said he had other things to busy him and she would have to look after
the house herself.

So disappointed and surprised was Jalm's daughter that she was filled
with awful wrath against the hobgoblin. How dared the creature treat her
thus?

Every morning now Barbaïk had to get up before the sun to milk her cows
or go to market. And evenings up she had to sit till midnight churning
butter. She was embittered with the imp who had deceived her and had led
her to look forward to an idle, care-free life. And she waxed yet
angrier and angrier when she gazed on poor Jegu's red face, squinting
eyes, and coarse hair.

"No, no, wicked elf," she vowed to herself, "never will I forgive you
for having made me marry a country bumpkin! But for you I should still
be the heiress, courted by the lads. I should still go to dances and all
my suitors would bring me cherries, hazelnuts and the good things of the
seas, and I should hear them tell me that I am the prettiest girl in all
the countryside. But now I must accept nothing save

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

from my clumsy husband. I must please only him! O wicked, spiteful elf!"

Yet wonder of wonders! One day the gnome did offer to help her. She was
invited to a wedding and as all the horses of the farm were ploughing in
the fields she asked the hobgoblin for a steed. He told her to go to the
pixies' town and ask for exactly what she wanted.

So Barbaïk went to the pixies' town on the heath and thinking that she
was asking properly, she said, "Little elves, little elves, lend me a
black horse, with eyes, mouth and ears, and with a bridle and a saddle."

No sooner asked than granted. The horse she wished stood instantly
before her. She mounted him and set out for the wedding. But soon she
began to notice that everyone laughed as she passed by.

"Look, look," cried each. one to his neighbor, "the farmer's wife has
sold her horse's tail!"

Barbaïk looked around quickly, and sure enough, her horse had no tail!
She had forgotten to mention one when she told the pixies what she
wished. They had taken her at her word and had given her just what she
had asked for.

Barbaïk was sorely vexed and tried to ride on quickly, but the horse
would not go faster, and she had to put up with all the jokes of the
passers-by.

By the time she reached home that evening, instead of being grateful for
the pixies' generosity, she was angrier

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

than ever with the little man in green. She accused him of having played
a crafty trick upon her. She made up her mind to punish him.

 

It was not long before spring came. Now spring is the birthday time of
all gnomes, elves, and fairies, and the little hobgoblin asked Jegu if
he might be permitted to invite his friends, the other little
hobgoblins, to come and spend the night in the hospitable barn, for he
wanted to give them supper and a dance. Of course Jegu could not refuse
the gnome this pleasure, so he asked Barbaïk to put her best tablecloth
on the barn floor, and to serve buttered rolls, all the day's milk, and
as many pancakes as she could make in one morning.

To Jegu's surprise Barbaïk did not object. She made the pancakes,
prepared the milk and baked the rolls and then, at nightfall, took them
to the barn and arranged them for the goblins' feast.

But she did something else that Jegu had not asked for. She put the red
hot cinders she had just taken from the fire all around the tablecloth
in the places where the pixies would sit down. So when the hobgoblin and
his friends arrived for the merrymaking they sat on the hot coals and
burned themselves most painfully. Up they all jumped and fled with
shrill cries of dismay and pain.

But in a twinkling they were back with jugs of water and

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

after having put out the fiery coals they began dancing around the barn
singing in angry voices:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Oh! naughty, idle Barbaïk  
Has played on us a horrid trick,  
So from the country we shall flee  
And leave her to her misery."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And they vanished
from the farm that very evening, never to return.

From that night forward Jegu and Barbaïk had all the labor of the farm
to do themselves for there were no kind elves to help them, nor to bring
their wishes true. But some folks said Jegu still had ten pixies to work
for him, pixies that were not invisible: his eight fingers and his two
thumbs!
