OW sweetly the children are sleeping in their box-beds. The yellow dog
is snoring on the warm hearth-stone, and the flickering firelight comes
and goes over grandfather's ancient chair.

Midnight is striking at the church of Saint Michael of the Great Beach,
midnight of this blessed Whitsuntide! It is now, good people, that you
must say under your breath prayers for the souls of those you have
loved. It is the hour when holy folk lay their heads on their
chaff-pillows, thankful for the goods that God has given them and then
fall asleep beside their slumbering children.

But Périk Skearn had no children; he was a daring young spark, and all
alone in the world. He had seen the nobles of thereabouts coming to
festivals of the parish, and he was envious of their horses with their
silver-set bridle reins. He was jealous of their velvet coats and their
silk stockings with their many-colored clocks. He longed to be as rich
as the lords; to have a seat in church with a red leather cushion,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

and take a lovely heiress to the Pardons, sitting behind him on the
pillion, one arm slipped round his waist.

That is why, this Whitsuntide, Périk was pacing up and down the Great
Beach at the foot of the dunes of Saint Efflam at an hour when all good
folk were sleeping in their beds. For Périk was dreaming of beautiful
maidens and wealth and gold, and his longings were as many as the nests
of the swallows on the wild sea-reefs.

The waves were sighing sadly on the dark horizon, the crabs were
silently gnawing drowned men's bones, the wind was whistling eerily
amongst the rocks as whistle the sea-robbers of the Great Beach,--but
Skearn still paced up and down the sands.

He gazed upward at the cliffs, saying over and over in his mind what the
bent and wrinkled beggar of the Cross of Yar had told him. In all four
corners of the land of Brittany no sage was to be found with knowledge
like unto this ancient beggar's. He could narrate what happened when our
oldest oaks were acorns, and our hoary ravens unhatched eggs.

Now the beggar had informed Skearn that on the spot where is now the
dune of Saint Efflam, was in olden times, a mighty town. Its fleets
covered the sea and it was ruled over by a king whose scepter was a
hazel wand with which he transformed everything as he willed. But it was
decreed by Heaven that the city and the king should be punished

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

for their crimes, so that one day, by Divine command, the shores rose up
like floods of boiling water and engulfed the evil doers. Yet each year,
at Whitsuntide, at the first stroke of midnight, a passage opens in the
mountain and permits him who dares to enter to reach the king's abode.
In the innermost chamber of this entombed palace is hanging the hazel
wand which gives the holder magic power,--but he must hasten who wishes
to possess it for, as the last stroke of midnight dies away, the
mountain closes and will crush the unwary intruder.

Skearn had treasured the story of the bent beggar of Yar, and that is
why this Whitsuntide he feverishly paced the sands of the Great Beach.
At last, from Saint Michael's steeple, the first stroke of midnight
sounded. Skearn started! . . . In the starlight he gazed at the granite
cliff which forms the mountain wall and saw it open sullenly as might
the jaws of some fell dragon awakening from slumber. Then, fixing the
leathern strap of his club firmly around his wrist, he rushed forward
into the jagged cliff. The cavernous interior was ghostily lighted as
though by those strange rays that shine at night in graveyards. Half
terrified, half eager, Skearn rushed onward through black leaping
shadows and arrived at the threshold of a mighty palace, the like of
which no man now living ever has beheld. Strangely it loomed within that
eerie light.

The first chamber that he entered was crammed with

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

cupboards in each of which were heaped up silver coins, as plentiful as
are the grains of corn in corn-bins after the gathering, of the harvest.
But Skearn knew that better things were waiting, and pressed on as the
sixth stroke of midnight rang.

He came to a second chamber. Here the cupboards were overflowing with
gold even as mangers overflow with flowering grass in June. Périk loved
gold, but he knew still richer treasure was to be had and he hastened
onward as the seventh stroke of midnight pealed.

The third room that Périk entered was full of baskets where pearls
streamed like milk in the stone jars at the beginning of Spring. He
longed to cram his pockets, but dashed on his way as the eighth stroke
tolled.

The fourth room was lighted by coffers full of diamonds, throwing out
more glory than the bonfires of dry gorse on the hillsides at Saint
John's Eve. Skearn was dazzled. He paused an instant, then ran to the
last room as he heard the ninth stroke ring. There he drew up suddenly,
breathless with admiration. In front of the hazel scepter, hanging in a
halo of light, were standing a hundred maidens, each lovely enough to
melt a hundred hearts.

Each beckoned to Skearn with one fair hand whilst with the other offered
a goblet that flashed as though with magic fire. Skearn, who had
resisted the silver, gold, the pearls and diamonds, now stood
spellbound. His heart pounded

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

against his ribs. His gaze was fixed upon the wondrous beauty of the
maidens.

The tenth stroke of midnight pealed. Skearn heard it not. The eleventh
rang out and he still was motionless. And now the twelfth stroke tolled,
as ominous as the gunshot of some ill-fated ship lost upon the rocks.

Périk, terrified, turned at last to flee, but it was too late. The
mountain's jaws had closed once more; the hundred maidens had turned
into a hundred statues of granite, and all was swallowed up in darkness.

 

That is how our forefathers told the story of Périk Skearn. Now you know
the fate of that deluded lad who opened his heart too readily to avarice
and temptation. It is wiser to be content with the blessings that good
Heaven grants than to turn one's longings to unbridled dreams of
treasure.
