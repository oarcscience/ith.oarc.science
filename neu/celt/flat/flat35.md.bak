# The Headless Horseman

"GOD speed you, and a safe journey this night to you, Charley,"
ejaculated the master of the little sheebeen house at Ballyhooley after
his old friend and good customer, Charley Culnane, who at length had
turned his face homewards, with the prospect of as dreary a ride and as
dark a night as ever fell upon the Blackwater, along the banks of which
he was about to journey.

Charley Culnane knew the country well, and moreover, was as bold a rider
as any Mallow-boy that ever *rattled* a four-year-old upon Drumrue
race-course. He had gone to Fermoy in the morning, as well for the
purpose of purchasing some ingredients required for the Christmas dinner
by his wife, as to gratify his own vanity by having new reins fitted to
his snaffle, in which he intended showing off the old mare at the
approaching St. Stephen's day hunt.

Charley did not get out of Fermoy until late; for although he was not
one of your "nasty particular sort of fellows" in any thing that related
to the common occurrences of life, yet in all the appointments connected
with hunting, riding, leaping, in short, in whatever was connected with
the old mare, "Charley," the saddlers said, "was the devil to *plase."*
An illustration of this fastidiousness was afforded by his going such a
distance for a snaffle bridle. Mallow was full twelve miles nearer
"Charley's farm" (which lay just three quarters of a mile below Carrick)
than Fermoy; but Charley had quarrelled with all the Mallow saddlers,
from hard-working and hard- drinking Tim Clancey, up to Mr. Ryan, who
wrote himself "Saddler to the Duhallow Hunt;" and no one could content
him in all particulars but honest Michael Twomey of Fermoy, who used to
assert - and who will doubt it - that he could stitch a saddle better
than the lord-lieutenant although they made him all as one as king over
Ireland.

This delay in the arrangement of the snaffle bridle did not allow
Charley Culnane to pay so long a visit as he had at first intended to
his old friend and gossip, Con Buckley, of the "Harp of Erin." Con,
however, knew the value of time, and insisted upon Charley making good
use of what he had to spare. "I won't bother you waiting for water,
Charley, because I think you'll have enough of that same before you get
home; so drink off your liquor, man. It 's as good *parliament* as ever
a gentleman tasted, ay, and holy church too, for it will bear *'x
waters,'* and carry the bead after that, may be."

Charley, it must be confessed, nothing loth, drank success to Con, and
success to the jolly "Harp of Erin," with its head of beauty and its
strings of the hair of gold, and to their better acquaintance, and so
on, from the bottom of his soul, until the bottom of the bottle reminded
him that Carrick was at the bottom of the hill on the other side of
Castletown Roche, and that he had got no further on his journey than his
gossip's at Ballyclose to the big gate of Convamore. Catching bold of
his oil-skin hat, therefore, whilst Con Buckley went to the cupboard for
another bottle of the "real stuff," he regularly, as it is termed,
bolted from his friend's hospitality, darted to the stable, tightened
his girths, and put the old mare into a canter towards home.

The road from Ballyhooley to Carrick follows pretty nearly the course of
the Blackwater, occasionally diverging from the river and passing
through rather wild scenery, when contrasted with the beautiful seats
that adorn its banks. Charley cantered gaily, regardless of the rain,
which, as his friend Con had anticipated, fell in torrents: the good
woman's currants and raisins were carefully packed between the folds of
his yeomanry cloak, which Charley, who was proud of showing that he
belonged to the "Royal Mallow Light Horse Volunteers," always strapped
to the saddle before him, and took care never to destroy the military
effect of by putting it on. - Away he went singing like a thrush-

"Sporting, belleing, dancing, drinking,  
Breaking windows - *(hiccup I)* - sinking,  
Ever raking - never thinking,  
Live the rakes of Mallow.

Spending faster than it comes,  
Beating - *(hiccup, hic),* and duns,  
Duhallow's true-begotten sons,  
Live the rakes of Mallow."

Notwithstanding that the visit to the jolly "Harp of Erin" had a little
increased the natural complacency of his mind, the drenching of the new
snaffle reins began to disturb him; and then followed a train of more
anxious thoughts than even were occasioned by the dreaded defeat of the
pride of his long-anticipated *turn* *out* on St. Stephen's day. In an
hour of good fellowship, when his heart was warm, and his head not over
cool, Charley had backed the old mare against Mr. Jephson's bay filly
Desdemona for a neat hundred, and he now felt sore misgivings as to the
prudence of the match. In a less gay tone he continued

"Living short, but merry lives,  
Going where the devil drives,  
Keeping - "

"Keeping" be muttered, as the old mare had reduced her canter to a trot
at the bottom of Kilcummer Hill. Charley's eye fell on the old walls
that belonged, in former times, to the Templars : but the silent gloom
of the ruin was broken only by the heavy rain which splashed and
pattered on the gravestones. He then looked up at the sky, to see if
there was, among the clouds, any hopes for mercy on his new snaffle
reins; and no sooner were his eyes lowered, than his attention was
arrested by an object so extraordinary as almost led him to doubt the
evidence of his senses. The head, apparently, of a white horse, with
short cropped ears, large open nostrils and immense eyes, seemed rapidly
to follow him. No connection with body, legs, or rider, could possibly
be traced the head advanced - Charley's old mare, too, was moved at this
unnatural sight, and snorting violently, increased her trot up the hill.
The head moved forward, and passed on: Charley pursuing it with
astonished gaze, and wondering by what means, and for what purpose, this
detached head thus proceeded through the air, did not perceive the
corresponding body until he was suddenly started by finding it close at
his side. Charley turned to examine what was thus so sociably jogging on
with him, when a most unexampled apparition presented itself to his
view. A figure, whose height (judging as well as the obscurity of the
night would permit him) he computed to be at least eight feet, was
seated on the body and legs of a white horse full eighteen hands and a
half high. In this measurement Charley could not be mistaken, for his
own mare was exactly fifteen hands, and the body that thus jogged
alongside he could at once determine, from his practice in horseflesh,
was at least three hands and a half higher.

After the first feeling of astonishment, which found vent in the
exclamation " I'm sold now for ever!" was over; the attention of
Charley, being a keen sportsman, was naturally directed to this
extraordinary body, and having examined it with the eye of a
connoisseur, he proceeded to reconnoitre the figure so unusually
mounted, who had hitherto remained perfectly mute. Wishing to see
whether his companion's silence proceeded from bad temper, want of
conversational powers, or from a distaste to water, and the fear that
the opening of his mouth might subject him to have it filled by the
rain, which was then drifting in violent gusts against them, Charley
endeavoured to catch a sight of his companion's face in order to form an
opinion on that point. But his vision failed in carrying him further
than the top of the collar of the figure's coat, which was a scarlet
single-breasted hunting frock, having a waist of a very old fashioned
cut reaching to the saddle with two. huge shining buttons at about a
yard distance behind. " I ought to see further than this, too," thought
Charley, " although he is mounted on his high horse, like my cousin
Darby, who was made barony constable last week, unless 'tis Con's
whiskey that has blinded me entirely." However, see further he could
not, and after straining his eyes for a considerable time to no purpose,
he exclaimed, with pure vexation, " By the big bridge of Mallow, it is
no head at all he has !"

"Look again, Charley Culnane," said a hoarse voice, that seemed to
proceed from under the right arm of the figure.

Charley did look again, and now in the proper place, for he clearly saw,
under the aforesaid right arm, that head from which the voice had
proceeded, and such a head no mortal ever saw before. It looked like a
large cream cheese hung round with black puddings: no speck of colour
enlivened the ashy paleness of the depressed features; the skin lay
stretched over the unearthly surface, almost like the parchment head of
a drum. Two fiery eyes of prodigious circumference, with a strange and
irregular motion, flashed like meteors upon Charley, and to complete
all, a mouth reached from either extremity of two ears, which peeped
forth from under a profusion of matted locks of lustreless blackness.
This head, which the figure had evidently hitherto concealed from
Charley's eyes, now burst upon his view in all its hideousness. Charley,
although a lad of proverbial courage in the county of Cork, yet could
not but feel his nerves a little shaken by this unexpected visit from
the headless horseman, whom he considered his fellow traveller must be.
The cropped-eared head of the gigantic horse moved steadily forward,
always keeping from six to eight yards in advance. The horseman, unaided
by whip or spur, and disdaining the use of stirrups, which dangled
uselessly from the saddle, followed at a trot by Charley's side, his
hideous head now lost behind the lappet of his coat, now starting forth
in all its horror as the motion of the horse caused his arm to move to
and fro. The ground shook under the weight of its supernatural burthen,
and the water in the pools became agitated into waves as he trotted by
them.

On they went - heads without bodies, and bodies without heads. - The
deadly silence of night was broken only by the fearful clattering of
hoofs, and the distant sound of thunder, which rumbled above the mystic
hill of Cecaune a Mona Finnea. Charley, who was naturally a
merry-hearted, and rather a talkative fellow, had hitherto felt tongue
tied by apprehension, but finding his companion showed no evil
disposition towards him, and having become somewhat more reconciled to
the Patagonian dimensions of the horseman and his headless steed,
plucked up all his courage, and thus addressed the stranger : -

"Why, then, your honour rides mighty well without the stirrups !"

"Humph," growled the head from under the horseman's right arm.

" 'Tis not an over civil answer," thought Charley ; "but no matter, he
was taught in one of them riding-houses, may be, and thinks nothing at
all about bumping his leather breeches at the rate of ten miles an hour.
I 'II try him on the other tack. Ahem I" said Charley, clearing his
throat, and feeling at the same time rather daunted at this second
attempt to establish a conversation.

"Ahem ! that's a mighty neat coat of your honour's, although 't is a
little too long in the waist for the present cut."

"Humph," growled again the head.

This second humph was a terrible thump in the face to poor Charley, who
was fairly bothered to know what subject he could start that would prove
more agreeable. " 'Tis a sensible head," thought Charley, "although an
ugly one, for 'tis plain enough the man does not like flattery." A third
attempt, however, Charley was determined to make, and having failed in
his observations as to the riding and coat of his fellow-traveller,
thought he would just drop a trifling allusion to the wonderful headless
horse, that was jogging on so sociably beside his old mare; and as
Charley was considered about Carrick to be very knowing in horses,
besides being a full private in the Royal Mallow Light Horse Volunteers,
which were every one of them mounted like real Hessians, he felt rather
sanguine as to the result of his third attempt.

"To be sure, that's a brave horse your honour rides," recommenced the
persevering Charley.

"You may say that, with your own ugly mouth," growled the head.

Charley, though not much flattered by the compliment, nevertheless
chuckled at his success in obtaining an answer, and thus continued : -

"May be your honour wouldn't be after riding him across the country?"

"Will you try me, Charley ? " said the head, with an iriexpressible look
of ghastly delight.

"Faith, and that's what I'd do," responded Charley, "only I 'm afraid,
the night being so dark, of laming the old mare, and I've every
halfpenny of a hundred pounds on her heels."

This was true enough; Charley's courage was nothing dashed at the
headless horseman's proposal; and there never was a steeple-chase, nor a
fox-chase, riding or leaping in the country, that Charley Culnane was
not at it, and foremost in it.

"Will you take my word," said the man who carried his head so snugly
under his right arm, for the safety of your mare?"

"Done," said Charley; and away they started, helter, skelter, over every
thing, ditch and wall, pop, pop, the old mare never went in such style,
even in broad daylight: and Charley had just the start of his companion,
when the hoarse voice called out " Charley Culnane, Charley, man, stop
for your life, stop !"

Charley pulled up hard. " Ay," said he, "you may beat me by the head,
because it always goes so much before you; but if the bet was
neck-and-neck, and that's the go between the old mare and Desdemona, I'd
win it hollow!"

It appeared as if the stranger was well aware of what was passing in
Charley's mind, for he suddenly broke out quite loquacious.

"Charley Culnane," says he, "you have a stout soul in you, and are every
inch of you a good rider. I've tried you, and I ought to know; and
that's the sort of man for my money. A hundred years it is since my
horse and I broke our necks at the bottom of Kilcummer hill, and ever
since I have been trying to get a man that dared to ride with me and
never found one before. Keep, as you have always done, at the tail of
the hounds, never baulk a ditch, nor turn away from a stone wall, and
the headless horseman will never desert you nor the old mare."

Charley, in amazement, looked towards the stranger's right arm, for the
purpose of seeing in his face whether or not he was in earnest, but
behold ! the head was snugly lodged in the huge pocket of the horseman's
scarlet hunting-coat. The horse's head had ascended perpendicularly
above them, and his extraordinary companion, rising quickly after his
avant courier, vanished from the astonished gaze of Charley Culnane.

Charley, as may be supposed, was lost in wonder, delight, and
perplexity; the pelting rain, the wife's pudding, the new snaffle - even
the match against squire Jephson - all were forgotten; nothing could he
think of; nothing could he talk of; but the headless horseman. He told
it, directly that he got home, to Judy; he told it the following morning
to all the neighbours; and he told it to the hunt on St. Stephen's day:
but what provoked him after all the pains he took in describing the
head, the horse, and the man, was that one and all attributed the
creation of the headless horseman to his friend Con Buckley's "X water
parliament." This, however, should be told, that Charley's old mare beat
Mr. Jephson's bay filly, Desdemona, by Diamond, and Charley pocketed his
cool hundred; and if he didn't win by means of the headless horseman, I
am sure I don't know any other reason for his doing so.
