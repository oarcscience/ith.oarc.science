  <P>
In Tipperary is one of the most
  singularly shaped hills in the world. It has got a peak at the top like a
  conical nightcap thrown carelessly over your head as you awake in the morning.
  On the very point is built a sort of lodge, where in the' summer the lady who
  built it and her friends used to go on parties of pleasure; but that was long
  after the days of the fairies, and it is, I believe, now deserted.</P>

  <P>
But before lodge was built, or acre sown, there was close to
  the head of this bill a large pasturage, where a herdsman spent his days and
  nights among the herd. The spot had been an old fairy ground, and the, good
  people were angry that the scene of their light and airy gambols should be
  trampled by the rude hoofs of bulls- and cows. The lowing of the cattle
  sounded sad in their ears, and the chief of the fairies of the hill determined
  in person to drive away the new comers; and the way she thought of was this.
  When the harvest nights came on, and the moon shone bright and brilliant over
  the hill, and the cattle were lying down hushed and quiet, and the herdsman,
  wrapt in his mantle, was musing with his heart gladdened by the glorious
  company of the stars twinkling above him, she would come and dance before him,
  - now in one shape - now in another, but all ugly
  and frightful to behold. One time she would be a great horse, with the wings
  of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then in
  a moment she would change into a little man lame of a leg, with a bull's head,
  and a lambent flame playing round it. Then into a great ape, with duck's feet
  and a turkey cock's tail. But I should be all day about it were I to tell you
  all the shapes she took. And then she would roar, or neigh, or hiss, or
  bellow, or howl, or hoot, as never yet was roaring, neighing, hissing,
  bellowing, howling, or hooting, heard in this world before or since. The poor
  herdsman would cover his face, and call on all the saints for help, but it was
  no use. With one puff of her breath she would blow away the fold of his great
  Coat, let him hold it never so tightly over his eyes, and not a saint in
  heaven paid him the slightest attention. And to make matters worse, he never
  could stir; no, nor even shut his eyes, but there was obliged to stay, held by
  what power he knew not, gazing at these terrible sights until the hair of his
  head would lift his hat half a foot over his crown, and his teeth would be
  ready to fall out from chattering. But the cattle would scamper about mad, as
  if they were bitten by the fly; and this would last until the sun rose over
  the hill.</P>

  <P>
The poor cattle from want of rest were pining away, and food
  did them no good; besides, they met with accidents without end. Never a night
  passed that some of them did not fall into a pit, and get maimed, or may be,
  killed Some would tumble into a river and be drowned: in a word, there seemed
  never to be an end of the accidents. But what made the matter worse, there
  could not be a herdsman got to tend the cattle by night. One visit from the
  fairy drove the stoutest-hearted almost mad. The owner of the ground did not
  know what to do. He offered double, treble, quadruple wages, but not a man
  could be found for the sake of money to go through the horror of facing the
  fairy. She rejoiced at the successful issue of her project, and continued her
  pranks. The herd gradually thinning, and no man daring to remain on the
  ground, the fairies came back in numbers, and gambolled as merrily as before,
  quaffing dew-drops from acorns, and spreading their feast on the heads of
  capacious mushrooms.</P>

  <P>
What was to be done? the puzzled farmer thought in vain. He
  found that his substance was daily diminishing, his people terrified, and his
  rent day coming round. It is no Wonder that he looked gloomy, and walked
  mournfully down the road. Now in that part of the world dwelt a man of the
  name of Larry Hoolahan, who played on the pipes better than any other player
  within fifteen parishes. A roving dashing blade was Larry, and feared nothing.
  Give him plenty of liquor, and he would defy the devil. He would face a mad
  bull, or fight single-handed against a fair. In one of his gloomy walks the
  farmer met him, and on Larry's asking the cause of his down looks, he told him
  all his misfortunes. &quot; If that is all ails you,&quot; said Larry,
  &quot;make your mind easy. Were there as many fairies on Knocksheogowna as'
  there are potato blossoms in Eliogurty, I would face them. It would be a queer
  thing, indeed, if I, who never was afraid of a proper man, should turn my back
  upon a brat of a fairy not the bigness of one's thumb.&quot; &quot;
  Larry,&quot; said the farmer, &quot; do not talk so bold, for you know not who
  is hearing you; but, if you make your words good, and watch my herds for a
  week on the top of the mountain, your hand shall be free of my dish till the
  sun has burnt itself down to the bigness of a farthing rushlight.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The bargain was struck, and Larry went to the hill-top, when
  the' moon began to peep over the brow. He had been regaled at the farmer's
  house, and was bold with the extract of barley-corn. So he took his seat on a
  big stone under a hollow of the bill, with his back to the wind, and pulled
  out his pipes. He had not played long when the voice of the fairies was heard
  upon the blast, like a slow stream of music. Presently they burst out into a
  loud laugh, and Larry could plainly hear one say, &quot;What! another man upon
  the fairies' ring? Go to him, queen, and make him repent his rashness;&quot;
  and they flew away. Larry felt them pass by his face as they flew like a swarm
  of midges; and, looking up hastily, he saw between the moon and him a great
  black cat, standing on the very tip of its claws, with its back up, and mewing
  with the voice of a water-mill. Presently it swelled up towards the sky, and,
  turning round on its left hind leg, whirled till it fell<I> </I>to the ground,
  from which it started up in the shape of a salmon, with a cravat round its
  neck, and a pair of new top boots. &quot; Go on, jewel,&quot; said Larry;
  &quot;if you dance, I'll pipe ;&quot; and he struck up. So she turned into
  this, and that, and the other, but still Larry played on, as he well knew how.
  At last she lost patience, as ladies will do when you do not mind their
  scolding, and changed herself into a calf, milk-white as the cream of Cork,
  and with eyes as mild as those of the girl I love. She came up gentle and
  fawning, in hopes to throw him off his guard by quietness, and then to work
  him some wrong. But Larry was not so deceived; for when she came up, he,
  dropping his pipes, leaped upon her back.</P>

  <P>
Now from the top of Knocksheogowna, as you look westward to
  the broad Atlantic, you will see the Shannon, queen of rivers, &quot;
  spreading like a sea, and running on in gentle course to mingle with the ocean
  through the fair city of Limerick. It on this night shone under the moon, and
  looked beautiful from the distant hill. Fifty boats were gliding up and down
  on the sweet current, and the song of the fishermen rose gaily from the shore.
  Larry, as I said before, leaped upon the back of the fairy, and she, rejoiced
  at the opportunity, sprung from the hill-top, and bounded clear, at one jump,
  over the Shannon, flowing as it was just ten miles from the mountain's base.
  It was done in a second, and when 8he alighted on the distant bank, kicking up
  her heels, she flung Larry on the soft turf. No sooner was he thus planted,
  than he looked her straight in the face, and scratching his head, cried out,
  &quot;By my word, well done! that was not a bad leap <I>for a calf!</I>&quot;</P>

  <P>
She looked at him for a moment, and then assumed her own
  shape. &quot;Laurence,&quot; said she, &quot;you are a bold fellow; will you
  come back the way you went?&quot; &quot;And that's what I will,&quot; said he,
  &quot;if you let me.&quot; So changing to a calf again, again Larry got on her
  back, and at another bound they were again upon the top of Knocksheogowna. The
  fairy once more resuming her figure, addressed him: &quot;You have shown so
  much courage, Laurence,&quot; said she, &quot;that while 'you keep herds on
  this hill you never shall be molested by me or mine. The day dawns, go down to
  the farmer, and tell him this; and if any thing I can do may be of service to
  you, ask and you shall have it.&quot; She vanished accordingly; and kept her
  word in never visiting the hill during Larry's life: but he never troubled her
  with requests. He piped and drank at the farmer's expense, and roosted in his
  chimney corner, occasionally casting an eye to the flock. He died at last,'
  and is buried in a green valley of pleasant Tipperary: but whether the fairies
  returned to the hill of Knocksheogown after<I> </I>his death is more than I
  can say.</P>
