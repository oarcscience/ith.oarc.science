# Dedication to Dowager Lady Chatterton

  

TO THE

DOWAGER LADY CHATTERTON,

CASTLE MAHON.

 

 

THEE, Lady, would I lead through Fairy-land  
(Whence cold and doubting reasoners are exiled),  
A land of dreams, with air-built castles piled;  
The moonlight SHEFROS there, in merry band  
With arful CLURICAUNE, should ready stand  
To welcome thee - Imagination's child!  
Till on thy ear would burst so sadly wild  
The BANSHEE'S shriek, who points with wither'd hand  
In the dim twilight should the PHOOKA come,  
Whose dusky form fades in the sunny light,  
That opens clear calm LAKES upon thy sight,  
Where blessed spirts dwell in endless bloom.  
I know thee, Lady - thou wilt not deride  
Such Fairy Scenes. - Then onward with thy Guide.

 

T. Crofton Croker
