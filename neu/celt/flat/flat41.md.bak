# Rent-Day

OH ullagone, ullagone ! this is a wide world, but what will we do in it,
or where will we go ?" muttered Bill Doody, as he sat on a rock by the
Lake of Killarney. " What will we do ? tomorrow's rent-day, and Tim the
Driver swears if we don't pay up our rent, he'll cant every *ha'perth*
we have; and then, sure enough, there's Judy and myself, and the poor
little *grawls* \[children\] will be turned out to starve on the high
road, for the never a halfpenny of rent have I ! - Oh hone, that ever I
should live to see this day !"

Thus did Bill Doody bemoan his hard fate, pouring his sorrows to the
reckless waves of the most beautiful of lakes, which seemed to mock his
misery as they rejoiced beneath the Cloudless sky of a May morning. That
lake, glittering in sunshine, sprinkled with fairy isles of rock and
verdure, and bounded by giant hills of ever-varying hues, might, with
its magic beauty, charm all sadness but despair; for alas,

*"How ill the scene that offers rest  
And heart that cannot rest agree!"*

Yet Bill Doody was not so desolate as he supposed there was one
listening to him he little thought of; and help was at hand from a
quarter he could not have expected.

"What's the matter with you, my poor man ?" said a tall portly looking
gentleman, at the same time stepping out of a furze-brake. Now Bill was
seated on a rock that commanded the view of a large field. Nothing in
the field could be concealed from him, except this furze-brake, which
grew in a hollow near the margin of the lake. He was, therefore, not a
little surprised at the gentleman's sudden appearance, and began to
question whether the personage before him belonged to this world or not.
He, however, soon mustered courage sufficient to tell him how his crops
had failed, how some bad member had charmed away his butter, and how Tim
the Driver threatened to turn him out of the farm if he didn't pay up
every penny of the rent by twelve o'clock next day.

"A sad story in deed," said the stranger; "but surely, if you
represented the case to your land-lord's agent, he won't have the heart
to turn you out."

"Heart, your honour ! where would an agent get a heart ! " exclaimed
Bill. "I see your honour does not know him: besides, he has an eye on
the farm this long time for a fosterer of his own; so I expect no mercy
at all at all, only to be turned out."

"Take this my poor fellow, take this,." said the stranger, pouring a
purse full of gold into Bill's old hat, which in his grief he had flung
on the ground. "Pay the fellow your rent, but I'll take care it shall do
him no good. I remember the time when things went otherwise in this
country, when I would have hung up such a fellow in the twinkling of an
eye I"

These words were lost upon Bill, who was insensible to every thing but
the sight of the gold, and before he could unfix his gaze, and lift up
his head to pour out his hundred thousand blessings, the stranger was
gone. The bewildered peasant looked around in search of his benefactor,
and at last he thought he saw him riding on a white horse a long way off
on the lake.

"O'Donoghue, O'Donoghue !" shouted Bill; "the good, the blessed
O'Donoghue !" and he ran capering like a madman to show Judy the gold,
and to rejoice her heart with the prospect of wealth and happiness.

The next day Bill proceeded to the agent's; not sneakingly, with his hat
in his hand, his eyes fixed on the ground, and his knees bending under
him; but bold and upright, like a man conscious of his independence.

"Why don't you take off your hat, fellow; don't you know you are
speaking to a magistrate?" said the agent.

"I know I'm not speaking to the king, sir," said Bill; "and I never
takes off my hat but to them I can respect and love. The Eye that sees
all knows I've no right either to respect or love an agent !"

"You scoundrel !" retorted the man in office, biting his lips with rage
at such an unusual and unexpected opposition, "I'll teach you how to he
insolent again - I have the power, remember."

"To the cost of the country, I know you have," said Bill, who still
remained with his head as firmly covered as if he was the lord Kingsale
himself.

"But, come," said the magistrate; "have you got the money for me? - this
is rent-day. If there's one penny of it wanting, or the running gale
that's due, prepare to turn out before night, for you shall not remain
another hour in possession."

" There is your rent," said Bill, with an unmoved expression of tone and
countenance "you'd better count it, and give me a receipt in full for
the running gale and all."

The agent gave a look of amazement at the gold; for it was gold - real
guineas ! and not bits of dirty ragged small notes, that are only fit to
light one's pipe with. However willing the agent may have been to ruin,
as be thought, the unfortunate tenant, he took up the gold, and handed
the receipt to Bill, who strutted off with it as proud as a cat of her
whiskers.

The agent going to his desk shortly after, was confounded at beholding.
a heap of gingerbread cakes instead of the money he had deposited there.
He raved and swore, but all to no purpose; the gold had become
gingerbread cakes, just marked like the guineas, with the king's head,
and Bill had the receipt in his pocket; so he saw there was no use in
saying any thing about the affair, as he would only get laughed at for
his pains.

From that hour Bill Doody grew rich; all his undertakings prospered; and
he often blesses the day that he met with O'Donoghue, the great prince
that lives down under the lake of Killarney.

Like the butterfly, the spirit of Donoghue closely hovers over the
perfume of the hills and flowers it loves ; while, as the reflection of
a star in the waters of a pure lake, to those who look not above, that
glorious spirit is believed to dwell beneath.
