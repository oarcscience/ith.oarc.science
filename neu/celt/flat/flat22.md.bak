# The Haunted Castle

THE Christmas of 1820 I had promised to spend at Island Bawn Horne, in
the county Tipperary, and I arrived there from Dublin on the 18th of
December: I was so tired with travelling, that for two days after I
remained quietly by the fireside, reading Mr. Luttrell's exquisite *jeu
d'esprit,* "Advice to Julia."

The first person I met on venturing out was old Pierce Grace, the smith,
one of whose sons always attends me on my shooting excursions: " Welcome
to these parts," said Pierce: " I was waiting all day yesterday,
expecting to see your honour."

"I am obliged to you, Piercy;; I was with the mistress."

"So I heard, your honour, which made me delicate of asking to see you.
John is ready to attend you, and he has taken count of a power of
birds."

The following morning, gun in hand, I sallied forth on a ramble through
the country, attended by old Pierce's son John. After some hours'
walking, we got into that winding vale, through which the Curriheen
flows, and beheld the castle of Ballinatotty, whose base it washes, in
the distance.

The castle is still in good preservation, and was once a place of some
strength. It was the residence of a powerful and barbarous race, named
O'Brian, who were the scourge and terror of the country. Tradition has
preserved the names of three of the family: Phelim *lauve lauider* (with
the strong hand), his son Morty *lauve ne fulle* (of the bloody hand),
and grandson Donough *gontrough na thaha* (without mercy in the dark),
whose atrocities threw the bloody deeds of his predecessors completely
into the shade. Of him it is related, that in an incursion on a
neighbouring chieftain's territories, he put all the men and children to
the sword; and having ordered the women to be half buried in the earth,
he had them torn in pieces by bloodhounds " Just to frighten his
enemies," added my narrator. The deed, however, which drew down upon him
the deepest execration was the murder of his wife, *Aileen na gruig
buie* (Ellen with the yellow hair), celebrated throughout the country
for her beauty and affability. She was the daughter of O'Kennedy of
Lisnabonney Castle, and refused an offer of marriage made to her by
Donough; being supported in her refusal by her brother Brian Oge, *skeul
roa more* (the persuasive speaking) she was allowed to remain single by
her father, and his death seemed to relieve her from the fear of
compulsion; but in less than a month after, Brian Oge was murdered by an
unknown hand; on which occasion Ellen composed that affecting and
well-known keen, *Thaw ma cree qeen bruitha le focth* (My heart is sick
and heavy with cold). As she returned from her brother's funeral,
Donough waylaid the procession: her attendants were slaughtered, and she
was compelled to become his wife. Ellen ultimately perished by his hand,
being, it is said, thrown out of the bower window for having charged him
with the murder of her brother. The spot where she fell is shown; and on
the anniversary of her death (the second Tuesday in August) her spirit
is believed to visit it.

Giving John my gun, I proceeded to examine the castle: a window on the
south side is pointed out as the one from which Ellen was precipitated;
but it appears more probable that it was from the battlement over it,
because from the circumstance of there being corresponding holes in the
masonry above and below, it is evident that the iron-work must have been
let in at the time of building, and that it did not open.

Having satisfied my curiosity, I was about to quit the room, when
observing an opening in the south-east corner, I was tempted  to explore
it, and found a small staircase, which led to a sleeping recess. This
recess was occupied by a terrier and a litter of whelps. Enraged at my
intrusion, the dam attacked me, and having no means of defence, I made a
hasty retreat. How far the angry animal pursued me, I cannot say; for in
my precipitate flight, as I descended the second staircase, my foot
slipped, and I tumbled through a broad opening into what had probably
been the guardroom: but the evil I now encountered far exceeded that
from which I fled, for the floor of this room was in the last stage of
decay: a cat could hardly have crossed it in safety; and the violence
with which I came on it carried me through its rotten surface with as
little opposition as I should have received from a spider's web, and
down I plunged into the gloomy depth beneath. A number of bats, whom my
sudden entrance disturbed, flapped their wings, and flitted round me.

\* \* \* \* \* \*

When my recollection returned, a confused sound of voices struck my
ears, and I then distinguished a female, who in a tone of the greatest
sweetness and tenderness said, "It's not wanting - it's not wanting -
the life's coming into him." Opening my eyes, I found my head resting in
the lap of a peasant girl, about eighteen, who was chafing my temples.
Health or anxiety gave a glow to her mild and expressive features, and
her light brown hair was Simply parted on her forehead. On one side
stood an old man, her father, with a bunch of keys, and on the other
knelt John Grace*,* with a cup of whiskey, which she was applying to
recover me. Looking round, I perceived that we were on the rocks near
the castle, and the river was flowing at our feet. Various exclamations
of joy followed; and the old man desiring John to rinse the cup,
insisted on my swallowing some of the *"cratur,"* which having done and
got up, I returned my thanks, and offered a small pecuniary recompense,
which they would not accept, " For sure and certain they would have
gladly done *tin* times as much for his honour without fee or reward."

I then inquired how they came to find me. "Why, as I thought your
honour," said John Grace, " would be some time looking into the crooks
and corners of the place, I just walked round to talk to Honny here; and
so we were talking over matters, and Honny was just saying to me that
the boys (meaning her brothers) were just baling the streams, and had
got a can of large eels, and that if I thought the mistress would like
them, I could take as many as I pleased, and welcome, when we heard a
great crash of a noise. ' What's that ?' says I. 'I suppose,' says
Honny, ''tis the *ould* gray horse that has fallen down and is *kilt* or
may be it's Paddy's Spanish dog *Sagur* that 's coursing about : there
's no thinking the plague he gives me - they're both in the turf-house,
fornent us (meaning, your honour, the underpart of the castle that
Cromwell made a breach into, and beside which the cabin stands).

"In comes Tim Hagerty there, and then we heard a screech ! ''Tis his
honour's voice, says I; 'he has fallen through the flooring!' 'Oh! if he
has,' says Tim, 'I'm lost and undone for ever: and didn't the Squire no
later than last Monday week bid me build up the passage, or that
somebody he said would be *kilt - and* sure I meant to do it tomorrow.'
Well, your honour, we got a light, and we saw the Phookas that caused
your fall all flying about, in the shape of bats, and there we found
your honour, and the turf all over the place; and for sure and certain,
if you hadn't first come on it, instead of the bones that Paddy and Mick
have been gathering against the young master's wedding, you would have
been smashed entirely. All of us were mad and distracted about the
wicked Phookas that were in the place, and could not tell what to do;
but Honny said to bring you out into the open air; and so we did; and
there, your honour, by care and management, praise be to God, we brought
you round again; but it was a desperate long time first, and myself
thought it was as good as all over with you."

Notes  
--------

 

The reader, it is to he hoped, will not he able to form a perfect notion
of the Phooka; for indistinctness, like that of an imperfectly
remembered dream, seems to constitute its character, and yet Irish
superstition makes the Phooka palpable to the touch. To its agency the
peasantry usually ascribe accidental falls; and hence many rocky pits
and caverns are called Poula Phooka, or the hole of the Phooka. A
waterfall of this name, formed by the Liffey, is enumerated among "the
sights" of the county Wicklow.

An odd notion connected with the Phooka is, that the country people will
tell their children after Michaelmas day not to eat blackberries, and
they attribute the decay in them, which about that time commences, to
the operation of the Phooka.
