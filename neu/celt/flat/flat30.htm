<CENTER><H1>The Lord of Dunkerron</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THE lord of Dunkerron - O'Sullivan More,<BR>

  Why seeks he at midnight the sea-beaten shore?<BR>

  His bark lies in haven, his bounds are asleep;<BR>

  No foes are abroad on the land or the deep.</P>

  <P>
Yet nightly the lord of Dunkerron is known<BR>

  On the wild shore to watch and to wander alone;<BR>

  For a beautiful spirit of ocean, 't is said,<BR>

  The lord of Dunkerron would win to his bed.</P>

  <P>
When, by moonlight, the waters were hush'd to repose,<BR>

  That beautiful spirit of ocean arose;<BR>

  Her hair, full of lustre, just floated and fell<BR>

  O'er her bosom, that heav'd with a billowy swell.</P>

  <P>
Long, long had he lov'd her- long vainly essay'd<BR>

  To lure from her dwelling the coy ocean maid;<BR>

  And long had he wander'd and watch'd by the tide,<BR>

  To claim the fair spirit O'Sullivan's bride !</P>

  <P>
The maiden she gazed on the creature of earth,<BR>

  Whose voice in her breast to a feeling gave birth;<BR>

  Then smiled; and, abashed as a maiden might be,<BR>

  Looking down, gently sank to her home in the sea.</P>

  <P>
Though gentle that smile, as the moonlight above,<BR>

  O'Sullivan felt 't was the dawning of love,<BR>

  And hope came on hope, spreading over his mind,<BR>

  Like the eddy of circles her wake left behind.</P>

  <P>
The lord of Dunkerron he plunged in the waves,<BR>

  And sought through the fierce rush of waters, their caves;<BR>

  The gloom of whose depth studded over with spars,<BR>

  Had the glitter of midnight when lit up by stars.</P>

  <P>
Who can tell or can fancy the treasures that sleep<BR>

  Intombed in the wonderful womb of the deep?<BR>

  The pearls and the gems, as if valueless, thrown<BR>

  To lie 'mid the sea-wrack concealed and unknown.</P>

  <P>
Down, down went the maid, - still the chieftain pursued;<BR>

  Who flies must be followed ere she can be wooed.<BR>

  Untempted by treasures, unawed by alarms,<BR>

  The maiden at length he has clasped in his arms !</P>

  <P>
They rose from the deep by a smooth-spreading strand,<BR>

  Whence beauty and verdure stretch'd over the land.<BR>

  &quot;T was an isle of enchantment ! and lightly the breeze,<BR>

  With a musical murmur, just crept through the trees.</P>

  <P>
The haze-woven shroud of that newly born isle,<BR>

  Softly faded away, from a magical pile,<BR>

  A palace of crystal, whose bright-beaming sheen<BR>

  Had the tints of the rainbow - red, yellow, and green.</P>

  <P>
And grottoes, fantastic in hue and in form,<BR>

  Were there, as flung up - the wild sport of the storm;<BR>

  Yet all was so cloudless, so lovely, and calm,<BR>

  It seemed but a region of sunshine and balm.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Here, here shall we dwell in a dream of delight,<BR>

  Where the glories of earth and of ocean unite !<BR>

  Yet, loved son of earth ! I must from thee away;<BR>

  There are laws which e'en spirits are bound to obey!</P>

  <P>
&quot; Once more must I visit the chief of my race,<BR>

  His sanction to gain ere I meet thy embrace.<BR>

  In a moment I dive to the chambers beneath:<BR>

  One cause can detain me - one only - 't is death!&quot;</P>

  <P>
They parted in sorrow, with vows true and fond;<BR>

  The language of promise had nothing beyond.<BR>

  His soul all on fire, with anxiety burns:<BR>

  The moment is gone - but no maiden returns.</P>

  <P>
What sounds from the deep meet his terrified ear -<BR>

  What accents of rage and of grief does he hear?<BR>

  What sees he? what change has come over the flood -<BR>

  What tinges its green with a jetty of blood?</P>

  <P>
Can he doubt what the gush of warm blood would explain?<BR>

  That she sought the consent of her monarch in vain !<BR>

  For see all around him, in white foam and froth<I>,<BR>

  </I>The waves of the ocean boil up in their wroth !</P>

  <P>
The palace of crystal has melted in air,<BR>

  And the dies of the rainbow no longer are there;<BR>

  The grottoes with vapour and clouds are o'ercast,<BR>

  The sunshine is darkness - the vision has past !</P>

  <P>
Loud, loud was the call of his serfs for their chief;<BR>

  They sought him with accents of wailing and grief:<BR>

  He heard, and he struggled - a wave to the shore,<BR>

  Exhausted and faint. bears O'Sullivan More !</P>
