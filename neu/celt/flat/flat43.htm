<CENTER><H1>The Legend of Cairn Thierna</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
FROM the town of Fermoy, famous for the
  excellence of its bottled ale, you may plainly see the mountain of Cairn
  Chierna. It is crowned with a great heap of stones, which, as the country
  people remark, never came there without &quot;a crooked thought and a cross
  job.&quot; Strange it is, that any work of the good old times should be
  considered one of labour; for round towers then sprung up like mushrooms in
  one night, and people played marbles with pieces of rock that can now no more
  be moved than the hills themselves.</P>

  <P>
This great pile on the top of Cairn Thierna
  was caused by the words of an old woman, whose bed still remains -- <I>Labacally</I>,
  the hag's bed -- not far from the village of Glanworth. She was certainly
  far wiser than any woman, either old or young, of my immediate acquaintance.
  Jove defend me, howeverr, from making an envious comparison between ladies;
  but facts are stubborn things, and the legend will prove my assertion.</P>

  <P>
O'Keefe was Lord of Fermoy before the
  Roches came into that part of the country; and he had an only son -- never
  was there seen a finer child; his young face filled with innocent joy was
  enough to make any heart glad, yet his father looked on his smiles with
  sorrow, for an old hag had foretold that this boy should be drowned before he
  grew up to manhood.</P>

  <P>
Now, although the prophecies of Pastorini
  were a failure, it is no reason why prophecies should altogether be despised.
  The art in modern times may be lost, as well as that of making beer out of the
  mountain heath which the Danes did to great perfection. But I take it, the
  malt of Tom Walker is no bad substitute for the one; and if evil prophecies
  were to come to pass, like the old woman's, in my opinion we are far more
  comfortable without such knowledge.</P>

      <P>
&quot;Infant heir of proud Fermoy,<BR>

      Fear not fields of slaughter<BR>

      Storm and fire fear not, my boy,<BR>

      But shun the fatal water.&quot;</P>

  <P>
These were the warning words which caused
  the chief of Fermoy so much unhappiness. His infant son was carefully
  prevented all approach to the river, and anxious watch was kept over every
  playful movement. The child grew up in strength and in beauty, and every day
  became more dear to his father, who, hoping to avert his doom, which, however,
  was inevitable, prepared to build a castle far removed from the dreaded
  element.</P>

  <P>
The top of Cairn Thierna was the place
  chosen; and the lord's vassals were assembled and employed in collecting
  materials for the purpose. Hither came the fated boy; with delight he viewed
  the laborious work of raising mighty stones from the base to the summit of the
  mountain, until the vast heap which now forms its rugged crest was
  accumulated. The workmen were about to commence the building, and the boy, who
  was considered in safety when on the mountain, was allowed to rove about at
  will. In his case, how true are the words of the great dramatist:</P>

      <P>
&quot;--Put but a little water in a
      spoon,<BR>

      And it shall be, as all the ocean,<BR>

      Enough to stifle such a <I>being </I>up.&quot;</P>

  <P>
A vessel which contained a small supply of
  water, brought there for the use of the workmen, attracted the attention of
  the child. He saw, with wonder, the glitter of the sunbeams within it; he
  approached more near to gaze, when a form resembling his own arose before him.
  He gave a cry of joy and astonishment, and drew back; the image drew back
  also, and vanished. Again he approached; again the form appeared, expressing
  in every feature delight corresponding with his own. Eager to welcome the
  young stranger, he bent over the vessel to press his lips; and losing his
  balance, the fatal prophecy was accomplished.</P>

  <P>
The father in despair abandoned the
  commenced building, and the materials remain a proof of the folly of
  attempting to avert the course of Fate.</P>
