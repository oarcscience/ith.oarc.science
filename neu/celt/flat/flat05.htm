  THERE lived not long since, on the borders
  of the county Tipperary, a decent honest couple, whose names were Mick
  Flanigan andJudy Muldoon. These poor people were blessed, as the saying is,
  with four children, all boys: three of them were as fine, stout, healthy,
  good-looking children as ever the sun shone upon; and it was enough to make
  any Irishman proud of the breed of his countrymen to see them about one
  o'clock on a fine summer's day standing at their father's cabin door, with
  their beautiful flaxen hair hanging in curls about their heads, and their
  cheeks like two rosy apples, and a big laughing potato smoking in their hand.
  A proud man was Mick of these fine children, and a proud woman, too, was Judy;
  and reason enough they had to he so. But it was far otherwise with the
  remaining one, which was the third eldest: he was the most miserable, ugly,
  ill conditioned brat that ever God put life into: he was so ill-thriven, that
  he never was able to stand alone, or to leave his cradle; he had long, shaggy,
  matted, curled hair, as black as any raven; his face was of a greenish yellow
  colour; his eyes were like two burning coals, and were for ever moving in his
  head, as if they had the perpetual motion. Before he was a twelvemonth old, he
  had a mouth full of great teeth; his hands were like kites claws, and his legs
  were no thicker than the handle of a whip, and about as straight as a
  reaping-hook: to make the matter worse, he had the gut of a cormorant, and the
  whinge, and the yelp, and the screech, and the yowl, was never out of his
  mouth. The neighbours all suspected that he was something not right,
  particularly as it was observed, when people, as they do in the country, got
  about the fire, and began to talk of religion and good things, the brat, as he
  lay in the cradle, which his mother generally put near the fire-place that he
  might be snug, used to sit up, as they were in the middle of their talk, and
  begin to bellow as if the devil was in him in right earnest: this, as I said,
  led the neighbours to think that all was not right, and there was a general
  consultation held one day about what would he best to do with him. Some
  advised to put him out on the shovel, but Judy's pride was up at that. A
  pretty thing indeed, that a child of hers should be put on a shovel and flung
  out on the dunghill, just like a dead kitten, or a poisoned rat ! no, no, she
  would not hear to that at all. One old woman, who was considered very skilful
  and knowing in fairy matters, strongly recommended her to put the tongs in the
  fire, and heat them red hot, and to take his nose in them, and that that
  would, beyond all manner of doubt, make him tell what he was, and where he
  came from (for the general suspicion was, that he had been changed by the good
  people); but Judy was too soft-hearted, and too fond of the imp, so she would
  not give into this plan, though every body said she was wrong; and may be she
  was, but it's hard to blame a mother. Well, some advised one thing, and some
  another; at last one spoke of sending for the priest, who was a very holy and
  a very learned man, to see it; to this Judy of course had no objection, but
  one thing or other always prevented her doing so; and the upshot of the
  business was, that the priest never saw him.</P>

<P>
Things went on in the old way for
some time longer. The brat continued yelping and yowling, and eating more than
his three brothers put together, and playing all sorts of unlucky tricks, for he
was mighty mischievous]y inclined; till it happened one day that Tim Carrol, the
blind piper, going his rounds, called in and sat down by the fire to have a bit
of chat with the woman of the house. So after some time, Tim, who was no churl
of his music, yoked on the pipes, and began to bellows away in high style; when
the instant he began, the young fellow, who had been lying as still as a mouse
in his cradle, sat up, began to grin and twist his ugly face, to swing about his
long tawny arms, and to kick out his crooked legs, and to show signs of great
glee at the music. At last nothing would serve him but he should get the pipes
into his own hands, and to humour him, his mother asked Tim to lend them to the
child for a minute. Tim, who was kind to children, readily consented and as Tim
had not his sight, Judy herself brought them to the cradle, and went to put them
on him; but she had no occasion, for the youth seemed quite up to the business.
He buckled on the pipes, set the bellows under one arm, and the bag under the
other, worked them both as knowingly as if he had been twenty years at the
business, and lilted up Sheela na guira, in the finest style imaginable. All was
in astonishment: the poor woman crossed herself. Tim, who, as I said before, was
<I>dark, </I>and did not well know who was playing, was in great delight; and
when he heard that it was a little <I>prechan </I>not five years old, that had
never seen a set of pipes in his life, he wished the mother joy of her son;
offered to take him off her hands if she would part with him, swore he was a <I>born</I>
piper, a natural <I>genus, </I>and declared that in a little time more, with the
help of a little good instruction from himself, there would not be his match in
the whole country. The poor woman was greatly delighted to hear all this,
particularly as what Tim said about natural <I>genus </I>quieted some misgivings
that were rising in her mind, lest what the neighbours said about his not being
right might he too true; and it gratified her moreover to think that her dear
child (for she really loved the whelp) would not he forced to turn out and beg,
but might earn decent bread for himself. So when Mick came home in the evening
from his work, she up and told him all that had happened, and all that Tim
Carrol had said; and Mick, as was natural, was very glad to hear it, for the
helpless condition of the poor creature was a great trouble to him; so next day
he took the pig to the fair, and with what it brought set off to Clonmel, and
bespoke a bran new set of pipes, of the proper size for him. In about a
fortnight the pipes came home, and the moment the chap in his cradle laid eyes
on them, he squealed with delight, and threw up his pretty legs, and bumped
himself in his cradle, and went on with a great many comical tricks; till at
last, to quiet him, they gave him the pipes, and he immediately set to and
pulled away at Jig Polthog, to the admiration of all that heard him. The fame of
his skill on the pipes soon spread far and near, for there was not a piper in
the six next counties could come at all near him, in Old Moderagh rue, or the
Hare in the Corn, or The Foxhunter Jig, or The Rakes of Cashel, or the Piper's
Maggot, or any of the fine Irish jigs, which make people dance whether they will
or no and it was surprising to hear him rattle away &quot; The Fox-hunt; &quot;
you'd really think you heard the hounds giving tongue, and the terriers yelping
always behind, and the huntsman and the whippers-in cheering or correcting the
dogs; it was, in short, the very next thing to seeing the hunt itself. The best
of him was, he was no ways stingy of his music, and many a merry dance the boys
and girls of the neighbourhood used to have in his father's cabin; and he would
play up music for them, that they said used as it were to put quicksilver in
their feet; and they all declared they never moved so light and so airy to any
piper's playing that ever they danced to.</P>

<P>
But besides all his fine Irish
music, he had one queer tune of his own, the oddest that ever was heard ; for
the moment he began to play it, every thing in the house seemed disposed to
dance; the plates and porringers used to jingle on the dresser<I>, </I>the pots
and pot-hooks used to rattle in the chimney, and people used even to fancy they
felt the stools moving from under them but, however it might be with the stools,
it is certain that no one could keep long sitting on them, for both old and
young always fell to capering as hard as ever they could. The girls complained
that when he began this tune it always threw them out in their dancing, and that
they never could handle their feet rightly, for they felt the floor like ice
under them, and themselves every moment ready to come sprawling on their backs
or their faces; the young bachelors that wished to show off their dancing and
their new pumps, and their bright red or green and yellow garters, swore that it
confused them so that they never could go rightly through the <I>heel</I> <I>and
toe, </I>or <I>cover the buckle, </I>or any of their best steps, but felt
themselves always all bedizzied and bewildered, and then old and young would go
jostling and knocking together in a frightful manner; and when the unlucky brat
had them all in this way whirligigging about the floor, he'd grin and chuckle
and chatter, for all the world like Jacko the monkey when he has played off some
of his roguery.</P>

<P>
The older he grew the worse he grew,
and by the time he was six years old there was no standing the house for him; he
was always making his brothers burn or scald themselves, or break their shins
over the pots and stools. One time in harvest, he was left at home by himself,
and when his mother came in, she found the cat a horseback on the dog, with her
face to the tail, and her legs tied round him, and the <I>urchin </I>playing his
queer tune to them; so that the dog went barking and jumping about, and puss was
mewing for the dear life, and slapping her tail backwards and forwards, which as
it would hit against the dog's chaps, he'd snap at and bite, and then there was
the philliloo. Another time, the farmer Mick worked with, a very decent
respectable man, happened to call in, and Judy wiped a stool with her apron, and
invited him to sit down and rest himself after his walk. He was sitting with his
back to the cradle, and behind him was a pan of blood, for Judy was making pigs'
puddings; the lad lay quite still in his nest, and watched his opportunity till
he got ready a hook at the end of a piece of twine, which he contrived to fling
so handily, that it caught in the bob of the man's nice new wig, and soused it
in the pan of blood. Another time, his mother was coming in from milking the
cow, with the pail on her head: the minute he saw her lie lilted up his infernal
tune, and the poor woman letting go the pail, clapped her hands aside, and began
to dance a jig, and tumbled the milk all atop of her husband, who was bringing
in some turf to boil the supper. In short there would be no end to telling all
his pranks, and all the mischievous tricks he played.</P>

<P>
Soon after, some mischances began to
happen to the farmer's cattle; a horse took the staggers, a fine veal calf died
of the black-leg, and some of his sheep of the red water; the cows began to grow
vicious, and to kick down the milk-pails, and the roof of one end of the barn
fell in; and the farmer took it into his head that Mick Flanigan's unlucky child
was the cause of all the mischief. So one day he called Mick aside, and said to
him, &quot;Mick, you see things are not going on with me as they ought, and to
be plain with you, Mick, I think that child of yours is the cause of it. I am
really falling away to nothing with fretting, and I can hardly sleep on my bed
at night for thinking of what may happen before the morning. So I'd be glad if
you'd look out for work some where else; you're as good a man as any in the
county, and there's no fear but you'll have your choice of work.&quot; To this
Mick replied, &quot; that he was sorry for his losses, and still sorrier that he
or his should be thought to be the cause of them; that for his own part, he was
not quite easy in his mind about that child, but he had him, and so must keep
him;&quot; and he promised to look out for another place immediately.
Accordingly next Sunday at chapel, Mick gave out that he was about leaving the
work at John Riordan's, and immediately a farmer, who lived a couple of miles
off, and who wanted a ploughman (the last one having just left him), came up to
Mick, and offered him a house and garden, and work all the year round. Mick, who
knew him to be a good employer, immediately closed with him so it was agreed
that the farmer should send a car [cart] to take his little bit of furniture,
and that he should remove on the following Thursday. When Thursday came, the car
came, according to promise, and Mick loaded it, and put the cradle with the
child and his pipes on the top, and Judy sat beside it to take care of him, lest
he should tumble out and be killed; they drove the cow before them, the dog
followed, but the cat was of course left behind; and the other three children
went along the road picking skeehories (haws), and blackberries, for it was a
fine day towards the latter end of harvest.</P>

<P>
They had to cross a river, but as it
ran through a bottom between two high banks, you did not see it till you were
close on it. The young fellow was lying pretty quiet in the bottom of his
cradle, till they came to the head of the bridge, when hearing the roaring of
the water (for there was a great flood in the river, as it had rained heavily
for the last two or three days), he sat up ih his cradle and looked about him;
and the instant he got a sight of the water, and found they were going to take
him across it, O how he did bellow and how he did squeal ! -no rat caught in a
snap-trap ever sang out equal to him. &quot; Whisht ! A lanna,&quot; said Judy,
&quot; there's no fear of you;&quot; sure its only over the stone-bridge we're
going.&quot; &quot;Bad luck to you, you old rip !&quot; cried he, &quot;what a
pretty trick you've played me, to bring me here !&quot; and still went on
yelling, and the farther they got on the bridge the louder he yelled; till at
last Mick could hold out no longer, so giving him a great skelp of the whip he
had in his hand, &quot;Devil choke you, you brat !&quot; said he, &quot; will
you never stop bawling ? a body can't hear their ears for you.&quot; The moment
he felt the thong of the whip, he leaped up in the cradle, clapt the pipes under
his arm, gave a most wicked grin at Mick, and jumped clean over the battlements
of the bridge down into the water. &quot; O my child, my child !&quot; shouted
Judy, &quot; he's gone for ever from me.&quot; Mick and the rest of the children
ran to the other side of the bridge, and looking over, they saw him coming out
from under the arch of the bridge, sitting cross-legged on the top of a
white-headed wave,and playing away on the pipes as merrily as if nothing had
happened. The river was running very rapidly, so he was whirled away at a great
rate; but he played as fast, ay and faster than the river ran; and though they
set off as hard as they could along the bank, yet, as the river made a sudden
turn round the hill, about a hundred yards below the bridge, by the time they
got there he was out of sight, and no one ever laid eyes on him more; but the
general opinion was, that he went borne with the pipes to his own relations, the
good people, to make music for them.</P>
