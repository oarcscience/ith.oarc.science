<CENTER><H1>The Haunted Cellar</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
THERE are few people who have not
  heard of the Mac Carthies - one of the real old Irish families, with the true
  Milesian blood running in their veins, as thick as buttermilk. Many were the
  clans of this family in the south; as the Mac Carthy-more - and the Mac
  Carthy-reagh - and the Mac Carthy of Muskerry; and all of them were noted for
  their hospitality to strangers, gentle and simple.</P>

  <P>
But not one of that name, or of any other, exceeded Justin Mac
  Carthy, of Ballinacarthy, at putting plenty to eat and drink upon his table;
  and there was a right hearty welcome for every one who would share it with
  him. Many a wine-cellar would be ashamed of the name if that at Ballinacarthy
  was the proper pattern for one; large as that cellar was, it was crowded with
  bins of wine, and long rows of pipes, and hogsheads, and casks, that it would
  take more time to count than any sober man could spare in such a place, with
  plenty to drink about him, and a hearty welcome to do so.</P>

  <P>
There are many, no doubt, who will
  think that the butler would have little to complain
  of in such a house; and the whole country round would have agreed with them,
  if a man could be found to remain as Mr. Mac Carthy's butler for any length of
  time worth speaking of; yet not one who had been in his service gave him a bad
  word.</P>

  <P>
&quot;We have no fault,&quot; they would say, &quot;to find
  with the master, and if he could but get any one to fetch his wine from the
  cellar, we might every one of us have grown gray in the house, and have lived
  quiet and contented enough in his service until the end of our days.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot; 'Tis a queer thing that, surely,&quot; thought young
  Jack Leary, a lad who had been brought up from a mere child in the stables of
  Ballinacarthy to assist in taking care of the horses, and had occasionally
  lent a hand in the butler's pantry : - &quot; 'tis a mighty queer thing,
  surely, that one man after another cannot content himself with<I>
  </I>the best place in the house of a good master,
  but that every one of them must quit, all through the means, as they say, of
  the wine-cellar. If the master, long life to him I would but make me his
  butler, I warrant never the word more would be heard of grumbling at his
  bidding to go to the wine-cellar.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Young Leary accordingly watched for what he conceived to be a
  favourable opportunity of presenting himself to the notice of his master.</P>

  <P>
A few mornings after, Mr. Mac Carthy went into his stable-yard
  rather earlier than usual, and called loudly for the groom to saddle his
  horse, as he intended going out with the hounds. But there was no groom to
  answer, and young Jack Leary led Rainbow out of the stable.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Where is William?&quot; enquired Mr. Mac Carthy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Sir? said Jack and Mr. Mac Carthy repeated the question.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is it William, please your honour?&quot; returned Jack;
  &quot;why, then, to tell the truth, he had just <I>one</I><I>
  </I>drop too much last night.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Where did he get it?&quot; said Mr. Mac Carthy;
  &quot;for since Thomas went away, the key of the wine-cellar has been in my
  pocket, and I have been obliged to fetch what was drank myself.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Sorrow a know I know,&quot; said Leary, &quot;unless the
  cook might have given him the <I>least</I><I>
  taste</I> in life of
  whiskey. But,&quot; continued he, performing a low bow by seizing with his
  right hand a lock of hair, and pulling down his head by it, whilst his left
  leg, which had been put forward, was scraped back against the ground, &quot;
  may I make so bold as just to ask your honour one question?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Speak out, Jack,&quot; said Mr, Mac Carthy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Why, then, does your honour want a butler?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Can you recommend me one,&quot; returned his master,
  with the smile of good-humour upon his countenance, &quot; and one who will
  not be afraid of going to my wine-cellar?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is the wine-cellar all the matter?&quot; said young
  Leary; &quot;devil a doubt I have of myself then for that.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;So you mean to offer me your services in the capacity of
  butler?&quot; said Mr. Mac Carthy, with some surprise.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Exactly so,&quot; answered Leary, now for the first time
  looking up from the ground.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Well, I believe you to be a good lad, and no objection
  to give you a trial.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Long may your honour reign over us, and the Lord spare
  you to us!&quot; ejaculated Leary, with another
  national bow, as his master rode off; and he continued for some time to gaze
  after him with a vacant stare, which slowly and gradually assumed a look of
  importance.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Jack Leary,&quot; said he at length, &quot;Jack - is it
  Jack?&quot; in a tone of wonder; &quot;faith, 'tis not Jack now, but Mr. John,
  the butler ;&quot; and with an air of becoming consequence he strided out of
  the stable-yard towards the kitchen.</P>

  <P>
It is of little purport to my story, although it may afford an
  instructive lesson to the reader, to depict the sudden transition of nobody
  into <I>some</I>body.
  Jack's former stable companion, a poor superannuated hound named Bran, who had
  been accustomed to receive many an affectionate pat on the head, was spurned
  from him with a kick and an&quot; Out of the way, sirrah.&quot; Indeed, poor
  Jack's memory seemed sadly affected by this sudden change of situation. What
  established the point beyond all doubt was his almost forgetting the pretty
  face of Peggy, the kitchen wench, whose heart he had assailed but the
  preceding week by the offer of purchasing a gold ring for the fourth finger of
  her right hand, and a lusty imprint of good-will upon her lips.</P>

  <P>
When Mr. Mac Carthy returned from hunting, he sent for Jack
  Leary - so he still continued to call his new butler. &quot;Jack,&quot; said
  he, &quot;I believe you are a trustworthy lad, and here are the keys of my
  cellar. I have asked the gentlemen with whom I
  hunted to-day to dine with me, and I hope they may
  be satisfied at the way in which wait on them at table; but above all, let
  there be no want of wine after dinner.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Mr. John having a tolerably quick eye for such and being
  naturally a handy lad, spread cloth accordingly,
  laid his plates and knives forks in the same manner be had seen his
  predecessors in office perform these mysteries, really, for the first time,
  got through attendance on dinner very well.</P>

  <P>
It must not be forgotten, however, that it was at
  the house of an Irish country squire, who was
  entertaining a company of booted and spurred fox-hunters, not very particular
  about what are considered matters of infinite importance under other
  circumstances and in other societies.</P>

  <P>
For instance, few of Mr. Mac Carthy's guests, (though all
  excellent and worthy men in their way,) cared much whether the punch produced
  after soup was made of Jamaica or Antigua rum ; some even would not have been
  inclined to question the correctness of good old Irish whiskey; and, with the
  exception of their liberal host himself, every one in company preferred the
  port which Mr. Mac Carthy put on his-table to the less ardent flavour of
  claret, - a choice rather at variance with modern sentiment.</P>

  <P>
It was waxing near midnight, when Mr. Mac Carthy rang the bell
  three times. This was a signal for more wine; and Jack proceeded to the cellar
  to procure a fresh supply, but it must be confessed not without some little
  hesitation.</P>

  <P>
The luxury of ice was then unknown in the south of Ireland;
  but the superiority of cool wine had been acknowledged by all men of sound
  judgement and true taste.</P>

  <P>
The grandfather of Mr. Mac Carthy, who had built the mansion
  of Ballinacarthy upon the site of an old castle which had belonged to his
  ancestors, was fully aware of this important fact; and in the construction of
  his magnificent wine-cellar had availed himself of a deep vault, excavated out
  of the solid rock in former times as a place of retreat and security. The
  descent to this vault was by a flight of steep stone stairs, and here and
  there in the wall were narrow passages - I ought rather to call them crevices;
  and also certain projections, which cast deep shadows, and looked very
  frightful when any one went down the cellar stairs with a single light:
  indeed, two lights did not much improve the matter, for though the breadth of
  the shadows became less, the narrow crevices remained as dark, and darker than
  ever.</P>

  <P>
Summoning up all his resolution, down went the new butler,
  bearing in his right hand a lantern and the key of the cellar, and in his left
  a basket, which he considered sufficiently
  capacious to contain an adequate stock for the
  remainder of the evening: he arrived at the door without any interruption
  whatever; but when he put the key, which was of an ancient and clumsy kind -
  for it was before the days of Bramah's patent, - and turned it in the lock, he
  thought he heard a strange kind of laughing within the cellar, to which some
  empty bottles that stood upon the floor outside vibrated so violently, that
  they struck against each other: in this he could not be mistaken, although he
  may have been deceived in the laugh, for the bottles were just at his feet,
  and he saw them in motion.</P>

  <P>
Leary paused for a moment, and looked about him with becoming
  caution. He then boldly seized the handle of the key, and turned it with all
  his strength in the lock, as if he doubted his own power of doing so; and the
  door flew open with a most tremendous crash, that, if the house had not been
  built upon the solid rock, would have shook it from the foundation.</P>

  <P>
To recount what the poor fellow saw would be impossible, for
  he seems not to know very clearly himself: but what he told the cook the next
  morning was, that he heard a roaring and bellowing like a mad bull, and that
  all the pipes and hogsheads and casks in the cellar went rocking backwards and
  forwards with so much force, that he thought every one would have been staved
  in, and that he should have been drowned or smothered in wine.</P>

  <P>
When Leary recovered, he made his way back as well as he could
  to the dining-room, where he found his master and the company very impatient
  for his return.</P>

  <P>
&quot;What kept you?&quot; said Mr. Mac Carthy in an angry
  voice; &quot;and where is the wine ? I rung for it half an hour since.</P>

  <P>
&quot; The wine is in the cellar, I hope, sir,&quot; said
  Jack, trembling violently; &quot; I hope 'tis not all lost.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;What do you mean, fool?&quot; exclaimed
  Mr. Mac Carthy in a still more angry tone:
  &quot;.why did you not fetch some with you?&quot;</P>

  <P>
Jack looked wildly about him, and only uttered a deep groan.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Mr. Mac Carthy to his guests,
  &quot;this is too much. When I next see you to dinner, I hope it will be in
  another house, for it is impossible I can remain longer in this, where a man
  has no command over his own wine-cellar, and cannot get a butler to do his
  duty. I have long thought of moving from Ballinacarthy; and I am now
  determined, with the blessing of God, to leave it to-morrow. But wine shall
  you have, were I to go myself to the cellar for it.&quot; So saying, he rose
  from table, took the key and lantern from his half stupefied servant, who
  regarded him with a look of vacancy, and descended the narrow stairs, already
  described, which led to his cellar.</P>

  <P>
When he arrived at the door, which he found open, he thought
  he heard a noise, as if of rats or mice scrambling over the casks, and on
  advancing perceived a little figure, about six inches in height, seated
  astride upon the pipe of the oldest port in the place, and bearing a spigot
  upon his shoulder. Raising the lantern, Mr. Mac Carthy contemplated the little
  fellow with wonder: he wore a red nightcap on his head; before him was a short
  leather apron, which now, from his attitude, fell rather on one side; and he
  had stockings of a light blue colour, 'so long as nearly to cover the entire
  of his legs; with shoes, having huge silver buckles in them, and with high
  heels (perhaps out of vanity to make him appear taller). His face was like a
  withered winter apple; and his nose, which was of a bright crimson colour,
  about the tip wore a delicate purple bloom, like that of a plum: yet his eyes
  twinkled</P>

      <I>
      <P>
&quot;like those mites<BR>

      Of candied dew in moony nights -</P>

      </I>
  <P>
and his mouth twitched up at one side with an arch grin.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Ha, scoundrel !&quot; exclaimed Mr. Mac Carthy,
  &quot;have I found you at last? disturber of my cellar -what are you doing
  there?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Sure, and master,&quot; returned the little fellow,
  looking up at him with one eye, and with the other throwing a sly glance
  towards the spigot on his shoulder, &quot;a'n' t we going to move to-morrow?
  and sure you would not leave your own little Cluricaune Naggeneen behind
  you?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Oh !&quot; thought Mr. Mac Carthy, &quot;if you are to
  follow me, master Naggeneen, I don't see much use in quitting
  Ballinacarthy.&quot; So filling with wine the basket which young Leary in his
  fright had left behind him, and ]ocking the cellar door, he rejoined his
  guests.</P>

  <P>
For some years after Mr. Mac Carthy had always to fetch the
  wine for his table himself, as the little Cluricaune Naggeneen seemed to feel
  a personal respect towards him. Notwithstanding the labour of these journeys,
  the worthy lord of Ballinacarthy lived in his paternal mansion to a good round
  age, and was famous to the last for the excellence of his wine, and the
  conviviality of his company; but at the time of his death, that same
  conviviality had nearly emptied his wine-cellar; and as it was never so well
  filled again, nor so often visited, the revels of master Naggeneen became less
  celebrated, and are now only spoken of amongst the legendary lore of the
  country. It is even said that the poor little fellow took the declension of
  the cellar so to heart, that he became negligent and careless of himself, and
  that lie has been sometimes seen going about with hardly a skreed to cover
  him.</P>

  <P>
Some, however; believe that he turned brogue maker, and assert
  that they have seen him at his work, and heard him whistling as merry as a
  blackbird on a May morning, under the shadow of a brown jug of foaming ale
  bigger - aye bigger than himself; decently dressed enough they say; - only
  looking mighty old. But still 't is clear he has his wits about him, since no
  one ever had the luck to catch him, or to get hold of the purse he has with
  him, which they call <I>spr&#233;-na-skiIlinagh, </I>and 't said is never without
  a shilling in it.</P>
