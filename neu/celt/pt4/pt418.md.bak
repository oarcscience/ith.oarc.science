### A PLEA FOR GAELIC.

And now let me add a word about the Gaelic language.

It is commonly said, "You have no literature; the language is not worth
learning."

A writer in the newspapers, who was kind enough to praise me,
nevertheless found great fault with the publication of Gaelic. The
publishers say, "Gaelic is a dead weight in the trade." My friends say,
"Give us no more Gaelic."

The British Museum Library is a national institution, and spends very
large sums on books, but such Gaelic books as "Gillies" and "Carswell"
were not there in

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 1861. The Advocates' Library in Edinburgh has
"Gillies," but no "Carswell," not even "Reid's Bibliotheca Scoto
Celtica," which gives a list of Gaelic books.

What there may be at Oxford and Cambridge I do not know, but I do not
believe that the published Gaelic books are to be found together in any
one public library. I bought "Gillies" for a few shillings in Glasgow,
and the Duke of Argyll has "Carswell," under lock and key, for it is
valuable, and has been lost. I lately attended the lectures of one of
the best of modern philologists, chiefly with a view to Gaelic as it
relates to Sanscrit. The Celtic tribes were placed by him in the front
ranks of the Aryan migration, the names of the most distinguished German
scholars were associated with Gaelic learning, but still in lectures
addressed to an English audience, of whom a large proportion must have
had "Celtic Crania," and all of whom use Gaelic words in their ordinary
speech, there was scarcely a word about the old languages of Great
Britain in early days, and yet Gaelic and Sanscrit are allied, and
Gaelic throws light on the relationship which exists between Sanscrit
and English.

Compare the form of the verb "to be" in the three languages. The Gaelic
verb is an assertion of existence, followed by the name of the person or
thing referred to; and if the corresponding English words be taken
instead of the verb, and the Gaelic sounds are spelt, the three
languages are like each other, and the

Gaelic is the simplest form.

| I am   | thou art | he is | English.             |
| ásmi   | ási      | ásti  | Sanscrit.            |
| hā-mee | hā-oo    | hā-ê  | Gaelic sound.        |
| is me  | is thee  | is he | literal translation. |

 

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

The past tense of the verb is an assertion of past being BHA, pronounced
VA.

Gaelic is closely related to the classical languages. Pritchard's
Eastern origin of the Celtic nations, and Armstrong's Gaelic dictionary,
and similar works, will shew how much there is of resemblance between
Gaelic, Latin, Greek, etc.; and it is generally admitted that a Keltic
language is at the foundation of the classical tongues. An eccentric
Gaelic schoolmaster is quoted in the West of Scotland Magazine, who used
to spout intelligible Gaelic imitations of Latin authors for hours--such
as, "Arma virumque cano." "Airm a's fir' se chanum." The dominie said he
was cracked, but there was method in his madness.

The following words which I have gathered from books and from my friends
appear to bear upon Gaelic-

68th Psalm, 4th verse, "Extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his
name JAH.

The numeral 1 is UN--like "un" (Fr.) "one." The numeral 5 coig, I cannot
trace in Panchan, though it has a resemblance to *cinq* and *quinque*,
which are traced in Sanskrit by experts, but 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10
resemble the Sanskrit numerals. The formation of higher numbers up to 20
is on the same principle--one ten, four ten, etc. Thence the Gaelic
counts by 20 and the Sanskrit by 10. The Gaelic says ten and two
twenties, or half a hundred--the Sanskrit says five tens.

Any Gaelic scholar may extend this list by a reference to books on
philology, but Gaelic ought most to resemble the oldest known Aryan
speech, if it be one of the oldest survivors of the Aryan family. There
is a likeness, but many surviving European languages are much nearer to
Sanskrit.

A vast number of places out of the Highlands still retain their Gaelic
names, and it is interesting to

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

[understand](errata.htm#15.md) them; for example, TINTOCK is the highest
mountain in Lanarkshire; and the name has a meaning in Gaelic, "The
house of the mist" (Tigh n' to-ag); and a local rhyme shews that to be
the true meaning of the name, which has no English meaning.

On Tintock tap there is a mist,  
And in the mist there is a kist,  
And in the kist there is a cup,  
And in the cup there is a drap  
Tak up the cup and drink the drap,  
And set the cup on Tintock tap.

There was a popular tale about this mountain which I have, failed to
get; but a cup, with some mysterious drink, is common in Celtic
traditions. There are cups taken from the fairies; cups from which all
sorts of drinks came; the cup of Fionn which healed diseases; the great
caldron of the Feinne, which is bidden somewhere; the kettle of the
"Korrigan" of Brittany; the St. Graal of mediæval romance, for which
there is no Scriptural authority; and the Ballan iochshlaint, or vessel
of balsam. And when we get back to Sanscrit mythology, a chief object of
worship was a drink, the juice of a plant, the "soma," to which all
sorts of virtues are attributed in the Vedas.

So lowland mythology is explained by Gaelic, and so is lowland
topography. "Craignethan" Castle has no meaning; but a similar Gaelic
sound means the crag of the rivulet, and correctly describes the site of
the ruin of Scott's castle of "Tillietudlem," in Lanarkshire.

CAM, in Cambridge, means the crooked, which is a correct description of
the river Cam; Bournmouth

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

means Watermouth, and is situated at the mouth of a "burn" or rivulet;
Bannockburn means *Cakewater* in Gaelic. In short, no history of the
English language is complete without its Celtic first chapter; and no
one has yet tried to write the Scotch Gaelic part of it.

Modern English is certainly more Teutonic than Celtic, but it is full of
Gaelic words, and they are creeping in still.

Here are a few words, chiefly written down as they occurred in
translating, and which seem to be common to Gaelic and English. Any
dictionary will give many more.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

All Gaelic words ending in *ear*, which mean a male individual who does
something, embody the Gaelic word *fear* (a man, or a male unit), which
word, when combined with another, is spelt *fhear*, and pronounced as
*êr* or ηρ, if a sheep's note is properly spelt μη. Thus,

|            |           |
|------------|-----------|
| Muill*ear* | Mill*er*, |

 

is a contraction for

|                 |                |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Mullinn*fhear*  | Mill*man*.     |
| Saigh-d*ear*    | Sold*ier*.     |
| Saighead*fhear* | Sagitt*a*rius. |

 

The Latin word thus seems to be founded upon *fhear* rather than *Vir*,
though vir is supposed to come from the Sanscrit Vira; but of the Aryan
languages (so far as I know) Gaelic alone explains how the V was lost,
for Gaelic inflections are often made at the beginning of words.

Supposing that the word for an archer to be a remnant of the old Keltic
of Italy, preserved in Latin, Sagittarius is made up of

Saighead-fhear-ius,  
Arrow   -man (with a termination.)

And if the g had the value which it has in many languages, the sounds
would be almost identical in Latin and Gaelic.

If this be right, the termination *er*, and the (now) Gaelic word
*fhear*, appear in most of the Aryan languages of Europe--Eng., Bak*er*;
Gaelic, Fuinead*air*; German, Bäek*er*; French, Boulang*er*; Norse,
Bag*er*; Spanish, Panad*er*o; Italian, Forn*ar*o; Swedish, Bag*ar*e;
Latin, Pist*or*: but Greek ἀρτοποιὸς will not do, though the words *am
fear*, the man, reappear in ἀνηρ, a man, and *aran*, bread, in ἀοτος.

It nowhere appears in Lapp, for *olmush* is the equivalent of *Fear*, a
man, and *laibbo* is a baker, though *hepush*, a horse, is like ἱππος.

Now, any English tradesman may be named by adding er to the proper
words, as trad*er*, railway-engine-boil*er*-rivet*er*. Any Gaelic
tradesmen may also be named, in like manner, by adding *fhear*, or
*ear*, or *air*, to other words; but neither in Gaelic nor in English
will these terminations properly apply to a trades*woman*. In English
the proper addition is seamstress, in French it is *euse*--and here
again is Gaelic--*Ise* is the equivalent of she,

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

and *esan* of he, and *aiche* is the termination which is common to both
genders, as--

Ban-fhaughl-*aiche*, a female seamstress,

but in English there are two ways of forming such words. We say horse
*man*, horse *woman*; but if we say rid*er*, we must add another word to
express a *female* rider; so the termination *er*, if Keltic, is
equivalent to *man* in horse *man*, which is Teutonic.

Any one who knows Gaelic can easily put a meaning on numbers of Italian
names. For example, "Monte, Soracte," Monadh, Sorachan (mountain, peak
or hillock), is a small peaked mountain standing alone near Rome. "Monte
Appennino," Monadh na Beinne (the mountain tract of the hill country),
is at least as descriptive in Gaelic as Italian, and the sounds are very
like still.

In like manner, the connection between Gaelic and any one of a large
class of European languages, can be shewn, but it has no apparent
relationship to Lapp. Hence, Gaelic is useful to a Sanscrit scholar, and
necessary to the full development of any system which treats of the
Aryan family of races and languages; and it is a very useful
accomplishment for any student of the Eastern languages, which pave the
way to promotion in India. It is also useful to a classical student who
wants to go deep into Greek and Latin.

No Frenchman can fully understand the origin of his own language without
knowing Gaelic, for French is still full of words, and especially
sounds, which seem to be Gaelic. If French be Latin, it is Latin spoken
with a Celtic brogue.

Du blè, corn, and *bleth*, to grind, are pronounced in the same way.
French sentences, which to the best-taught English tongues, are as hard
as *th*is and *th*at, and *th*e o*th*er *th*ing, to a Frenchman, are
easily pronounced by a Highlander. On dit, qu'un bon garçon gagnait cinq
cent, cinquante cinq écus, and such sounds, present little difficulty to
a Gaelic peasant; and there are Polish and Russian and Welsh liquids of
which the same is true. *Puill*, holes full of mud, has the same sound
as the Russian for dust, and the French *Mouillé*, wet, which are sore
puzzles for a Saxon, but easy for a Celt. *Eala gheal*, a white swan,
contains a Polish liquid sound, which a Polish lady assured me she had
never heard mastered by a foreigner, yet it

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

is one of the commonest sounds in Gaelic. So Gaelic is of the greatest
use in learning to speak and pronounce other languages.

He who can utter the following sentence must have a nimble tongue for
liquids--

"Laogh na laidhe an an lag an lochain air là luain 's ag òl leann laidir
á ladar."

In the specimen of "old Saxon," given by Latham (p. 46, Handbook of the
English Language), a few words which resemble Gaelic can be traced.

Spoken Gaelic has altered very little in the course of the last three
centuries in the islands.

Dean Monro's statistical account of the Western Islands was written in
Scotch, 1549, and the names are spelt phonetically. The names of the
islands and families, as now pronounced, could hardly be better
expressed for English ears. "Skibness; Ellan Ew; Lochebrune; M‘Enzie;
the haley isles of Flanayn; Ellan Vie Couil, perteining to M‘Cloyd;" and
some hundreds of names are so spelt as to express their present value.
Icelandic, which has also been shut up in islands, has altered but
little for many centuries.

To me it appears that a living language of this kind, which certainly is
a dialect of "Keltic," which was spoken in Great Britain and Ireland in
the days of Cæsar, and was also spoken in all the outlying corners of
Europe, in Spain, and Portugal, France, Jutland, in Italy, Greece, and
Asia Minor, and which is now spoken by settlers in America, and
Australia, and India, is an interesting study.

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

It is peculiarly interesting, for the same reason, that a great auk's
egg is now worth a large sum. Gaelic, like the great auk, will soon have
ceased to exist, and the process by which it is extinguished may serve
to explain the extinction of languages elsewhere.

Its very corruptions are lessons in the science of language. The manner
in which a new word is altered, when it is received into common use, is
a practical lesson, which holds good for all human speech, and serves to
test the rules laid down for phonetic changes.

The inflections at the beginning of words, which are an essential part
of spoken Gaelic, seem to be especially worthy of attention for their
singularity. There is no good reason to suppose that "Gaelic," "Welsh,"
or "Dutch" was the "language of Paradise" but there is no reason why
Gaelic should not contain remnants of some form of speech older than
Sanskrit, and this may be one example. But my wish is to call attention
to this subject, not to pronounce opinions on questions which require
hard study, and knowledge which I do not yet possess.

In the Highlands generally, I find the language rapidly mixing with
English; and striking illustrations of the changes which take place in
human speech, phonetic and grammatical, meet me at every step; but they
are all changes which tend to decay. I find that lectures are delivered
to Sunday-school children to prove that Gaelic is part of a divine
curse; and Highland proprietors tell me that it is "a bar to the
advancement of the people."

Let me endeavour to show that Gaelic is good for something more; it has
been shown above that it is good for something.

First, English is a "bar to the advancement " of proprietors,

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

if they cannot speak to those who pay their rents; and it is the want of
English, not the possession of Gaelic, which retards the advance of
those who seek employment where English is spoken. So Highland
proprietors should learn Gaelic and teach English.

Gaelic is no bar to advancement. It did not clog the steps of the Lord
Justice General, or his brother the Ambassador, or of the
Vice-Chancellor, or of dozens of other men of rank, whose learning
included Gaelic. It has not weighed in my slower race through life; and
it gave me a stock of sounds which occur in other languages, and which
an English tongue can rarely pronounce. It is worth learning, if only to
see the pleasure which shines like sun-light through a clouded Highland
face, when Gaelic is unexpectedly heard.

Some time ago I was walking along a lowland road, dressed in the genteel
chimney pot, and broad cloth of this age, and as I went, the sound of a
plaintive Gaelic song caught my ear. It came from a bevy of girls who
were working in a field by the road-side, and singing a lamentable love
song over their work. So I called out over the hedge, "*’S math sibh
fhéin a ghaladan*," "well done, girls." The whole field was in a pleased
commotion directly, for these were people from Skye; and we were friends
on the instant, by virtue of a cabalistic word of our common language,
and so it has been in thousands of cases.

Gaelic is the key to a Highlander's heart; and proprietors and
utilitarians should learn it before they condemn it. They would not so
easily part with their people if they knew them, and could talk with
them.

If Irish proprietors would try to speak Gaelic to their people they
would be better liked. Officers who speak Gaelic to Highland soldiers
command their affection.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

\[paragraph continues\] If officers in Highland regiments would try
more, they would have more recruits.

Without printed Gaelic I feel sure that I should now be enjoying the
blame of another MacPherson. I submit to my adverse critics that they
would not have believed in Gaelic stories without the originals, and
that Gaelic as now spoken in various districts was something worth
preservation, for they will find it nowhere else.

Let those who say that there is no Gaelic literature read Professor
O'Curry's Lectures, and they will there find that the best scholars only
distinguish between Scotch and Irish Gaelic as between dialects of the
same tongue, and that there is a mass of unexplored Gaelic literature
still extant. There are two Professors, one at the New Catholic
University; a Government Commission is employed about "the Brehon laws,"
as they are called, and a Gaelic MS. about "Danish invasions," forms one
of the historical series published under the authority of the Master of
the Rolls. All sorts of questions are sure to arise as these documents
are brought to light and read; and without Gaelic no scholar can give an
opinion of them. Questions relative to early Christianity may turn on
words in Gaelic manuscripts, and who is to say what may be found in such
an unexplored field? Old Irish prophecies have actually been spread
amongst the peasantry for political purposes. If it was important for
the interests of the State to found a chair of Sanscrit, which nobody
speaks, surely there ought to be some means of learning Gaelic devised
for England, where a large section of the people speak the language
still. Surely the few relies of Scotch Gaelic literature which remain
are worthy of more attention. Till rescued from oblivion, and placed in
safety by the patriotic exertions of Mr. Skene, their

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

very existence had been forgotten, and some valuable MSS., the property
of the Highland Society, have disappeared within the last sixty years.
It is surely a mistake to say that there is no literature in a language,
[and](errata.htm#16.md) to set about proving it to be true by allowing the
little which remains to be destroyed.

Without a common language men misunderstand each other, and those who
are employed in a country should be able to talk to its people. It is a
rule of the Danish Government that no official shall hold office in
Iceland unless he speaks both Danish and Icelandic, and the rule is
good. A philanthropist who cannot speak to the people, and judges from
what he sees, must describe the poor of the west as living in squalid
hovels, amidst peat-reek; silent, and dull; for they cannot speak to
him, and they are very poor, and they are awed into silence by the
broad-cloth, and black hat, and gold watch and chain of a government
gentleman who suffers from peat-reek. A few specimens of those most
mysterious of beings, which are found in all classes, men without
reason, may lead to the conclusion that the rest are but idiots of a
higher grade; but one who understands Gaelic may learn a lesson beneath
these lowly roofs. He may hear the story of Cinderella, and of the
black, rough-skinned herd; and the "idiots" who all rose to be princes,
and the song of the mighty fool who did his duty manfully and succeeded.
He may look about him and find that very many historical names have in
fact sprung from a cottage, and from such cottages; and if these are
turf heaps over which a man can walk, he may be reminded that without
Gaelic he can know as little of the better part of those who inhabit
them, as Gray knew of the minds of those who mouldered beneath the
mouldering heaps of a

country churchyard. The Registrar-General and the clergyman will prove
that those who live in direct contravention of all the "rules of
sanitary science" and "common decency," because they are too poor to
live otherwise, are at least as long-lived, chaste, and religious as any
class of Her Majesty's poor. Those who live in such houses claim their
descent from, and trace it to the warriors buried under stones, some of
which are figured above, and many of them are as proud of their ancestry
as the Icelanders, some of whom claim to be related to the Queen of
England, and live in similar buts. When they go elsewhere their
strongest desire is to return; their bodies are often carried "home"
when they die, far away; and history will show that many a distinguished
man began life in a black house, and there listened to stories, and

to better lessons first heard in Gaelic.

I have said this much, because there is a vague idea in English-speaking
society that a Celt is an inferior animal, and that is a "vulgar error."
An Englishman, say what he will, has a large cross of the Celt in his
composition, as the shape of his head proclaims. Many Lowlanders and the
people of the midland counties of England are "Celts," and a Frenchman
is not inferior to an Englishman in most things. The purest specimens of
Scandinavian blood are to be found in Iceland, and there are no signs of
superiority of race there; on the contrary, there is a strong
resemblance to the people of the West Highlands, and to many of their
peculiarities of temper and manner. I doubt if even the country whence
the Anglo Saxons came, can now shew any

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

superiority over the countries where Celt and Saxon, and good feeding,
have produced a good cross. In Norway, Iceland, France, Germany, and
Italy, a man of five feet ten inches feels himself above the average
size. He is below the average size of West Highland gentlemen. Whole
families of men above six feet high could be named. I know a Highlander,
who is a little over six feet, and measures fifty-six inches round the
chest, and who in his youth was "as strong as a bull." A London
drawing-room is the only place in Europe where a race of men better
grown than West Highland gentlemen is to be met. Having associated with
peasants in every country which I have visited, mixing with all classes
on equal terms, so far as I could, I have arrived at the conclusion that
a Celt is an average human animal, equal mentally and physically to any
other species of the genus homo similarly placed. Much the same can be
said of Lapps, though they are a small race, and I am no believer in the
natural superiority of any one race over another. It seems to be in the
nature of races to dislike and despise each other, and I would willingly
"speak up" for the minority, who cannot speak for themselves, "having no
English," and who are apt quietly to despise the Saxon fully as much as
he despises them. Both are wrong, as much and as surely as the members
and the stomach erred when they fell out. The one cannot suffer but the
other must ache.
