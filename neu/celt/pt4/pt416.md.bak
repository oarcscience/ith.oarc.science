### MYTHOLOGY--ARYAN THEORY.

I lately had the advantage of hearing the modern science of language
explained by a master of that art. Its principles, as I gathered them,
appear to be these. Men are different from brutes in that they are
gifted with reason, and having reason they are also gifted with

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

speech. Parrots have organs of speech, and speak, but they have no
language, because they have no reasonable ideas to express. Such ideas
as they have, they express in their own way, by tones, not words. Men
then being gifted with reason and the faculty of speech, began to speak;
and expressed their ideas by sounds, which are the roots of language.
Languages pass through stages of growth and decay, and so far as has
been ascertained, there are three stages, of which examples exist.

Languages whose words are all roots, which have neither verbs nor
adjectives, not terminations, such as Chinese, which, as it would seem,
has never grown, though much cultivated.

Languages in which one word is glued to another and becomes a
termination, and loses its independent meaning.

And languages which have passed through these two stages, where the
roots and terminations have become so intimately joined and altered by
time and use that it requires a practised workman to distinguish them,
and hunt them back to their sources.

All languages, it is assumed, have passed, or will pass, through these
three stages of growth and decay; and the modern languages of the great
Aryan family are in the third stage. Of the Aryan family of languages,
the Sanscrit, is the oldest known, and this system of roots and growths,
the principle on which letters change, and the framework of the whole
science, existed centuries ago amongst the sages of the East, where
writings have been discovered, read, and adopted, by modern
philosophers.

A philologist, then, with sacred and profane history pointing eastwards,
with Sanscrit books, and eastern learning at his command, with a stock
of roots gathered

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

in the East centuries ago, begins at some leaf or twig, some word, in
the West, and works backwards to find the root; or he starts at the
root, and works upwards fo the modern word, and so by patient grubbing,
and bold leaps, by force of intellect and power of speech, men strive to
reach the truth in this, as in other sciences. They use the faculties
which have been given them to solve this problem, as other men have used
the same implements to solve problems as hard. As geologists have dug
into the history of the world, and astronomers have scaled the stars, so
a philologist hops like a squirrel from bough to bough, and strives to
understand the growth of the great tree of human language.

Now, surely if it be a study worthy of philosophers to trace out the
sounds which are the seeds from which speech grew; it is at least as
interesting to trace the growth of untutored thoughts which words
express; and so this study of popular tales must come to take its place
beside the science of language, if that is to be admitted to a high
place in the mystic circle.

If men began to express ideas by language, they must have had ideas to
express, and if ever these early ideas, the growth of unaided minds, are
to be discovered, it will be by a process of patient inquiry, and bold
speculation, like that which has raised up the sciences of Philology,
Geology, and Astronomy.

When we hold a tradition, we have something like a modern word, or a
leaf; when we have ancient writings we have something like a Sanscrit
root, and as time goes on and knowledge increases, the connection
between the peasant's nursery tale and some old world belief will become
clearer and clearer. And when that has been done, and when many old
pagan beliefs have been

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

hunted out, the truth will certainly appear beyond it all by following
this road as well as another.

The science of philology has not yet proved, but it points to a single
common language, and an eastern origin for the human race; comparative
mythology points the same way, and this wonderful community of popular
tales throughout the world joins with them in pointing to a common
eastern origin for mankind.

And that origin certainly cannot be a gorilla, for in all their
researches men find no trace of primæval gorilla roots, languages,
myths, or tales.

Men are distinguished from gorillas, for they have intellects and tales;
birds still differ from men in that they cannot learn the use of their
organs of speech, though there was once a magpie who told tales of her
mistress, and was taken in by her superior cunning, and unjustly put to
death. On fine days the whole neighbourhood of a certain square in
London echoes to the most lamentable sounds of human woe--heart-rending
shrieks and wailings fill the air. It is a green parrot expressing his
delight at the bright sun and the fresh air, by repeating what he must
have learned in a very cross nursery.

Now if "storyology" be a science, it is worthy of a system and
systematic study, and the process might be somewhat like this;--Begin
anywhere; and read any collection, and there will appear a certain
number of incidents which are repeated over and over again. They are
never expressed twice in the same words, but they are clearly the same
nevertheless, and they are easily recognised.

Take, for example, the idea of a giant whose life is not in his body,
but stowed away elsewhere (No. IV., vol. i.), and wherever that idea
turns up hereafter, compare

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

it with the first mention of it; and so by degrees it will appear that
the notion of a man with his life elsewhere is very commonly associated
with certain other ideas which have to do with a hostile dragon, beasts,
birds, fish, and trees, earth, air, water, supernatural powers, and the
loves of a man and woman. When this cluster of ideas is commonly found
in one country, it becomes an incident belonging to the people of that
country, and all that specially belongs to that people and no other may
be removed, and then with a fossil incident picked out of the stratum in
which it was first found, the "storyologist" may proceed to pick out
other notions in the same way. When he has subjected any one collection
to this sifting, there will certainly remain a number of primæval fossil
incidents, and a lot of historical debris which may be left, in the
meantime, for historians to sift in their turn. With such a collection
of incidents stored and arranged, it is easy to recognise similar
specimens elsewhere, and it is startling to find them in some of their
resting places. No doubt hereafter a scientific nomenclature will be
devised. The incident which I have taken as an example might be called
the hieroglyphic incident, for it occurs, as I am told, in an Egyptian
papyrus, and the Norse giant with no heart in his body, and the Arabic
djinn who kept his life at the bottom of the circumambient ocean might
be called the Norse and Arabic varieties. And so when many collections
have been made and explored, it will be found out who has, and who has
not got this and that idea, and what ideas are common to all. I have
little doubt that this particular notion will be discovered to belong to
some ancient system of mythology, like that of Egypt, and to relate to a
deluge and a creation. It would seem to be very old, and it is very
widely

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

spread. The question is, who were the people who held this notion of a
common terminable life for all nature, and a man and a woman who
overcame the natural powers by the help of a superior intelligence, and
when and where did they live, if they lived before the Egyptians.

I have formed no theory on the subject, but it seems worth inquiry, and
this is one way to puzzle out some parts of the ancient history of the
human race, from the traces of the human mind. Let a sufficient number
of incidents be gathered together, and treated as roots, wherever they
may be found; exactly as AR and TRA are hunted through forests of Aryan
words, and storyology will become a science like any other ology, and it
is fully as amusing as most of that dusty tribe. It is more amusing to
read faces than it is to read books; it is quite as satisfactory to
catch a new idea as it is to land a fresh salmon, bag a pheasant, run a
fox to ground, or draw a badger, and the pursuit may best be carried on
in the open air, amongst the wildest of glens, and mountains, and
mountaineers.

And what were these first efforts of reason left to itself? Surely to
find out the reason of things.

In early youth, I was taught a definition which I have never been able
to forget.

Q. "What is a river?"

A. "A river is a stream of water running through the lowest accessible
levels of a country into the sea, and returning to it the water which
having evaporated had formed clouds and fallen over the land in rain."

A simple man in search of knowledge, who had found all that out for
himself, might well think he had got the two ends of his chain of
reasoning fast linked

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

together, and describe a circle in the sand, to express the discovery
completed.

The river runs because the rain falls; the rain falls because the rivers
runs, so the chain is endless and unbroken, and the river something
everlasting. Men having a tendency to admire the fruit of their own
brains might well sit down content, and mayhap fall down and worship the
river itself, or set up a circle, or a symbolical serpent with his tail
in his mouth, to express eternity, and exclaim--"how beautiful is this
great everlasting river, which is older than my grandfather, which flows
down from his lofty clouds in the air to water my fields, and return to
his native skies." And so the river might become a god, and acquire a
name, and a history, and temples, and priests, and a religious system,
and a form, mayhap that of a fish's tail tacked on to a human body.

But some other thinker might feel cramped within this water circle
flowing about the earth, and seek to know why the river was material,
and ran down northwards, and flew up and southwards, and suspect that
the water god had more to do than water fields. If he thought hard, he
might find out that water rose up when it was heated by fire, that the
sun was hot, and that the river flew through the air because the sun
shone; that the fields gave their increase, not because of the water
god, whose own watery regions produced nothing but weeds and fish, but
because the sun compelled the water to work, and then warmed the fields
into fertility. And so a new astronomical circle, and a larger
symbolical serpent, with his tail in his mouth, new priests, images and
ceremonies, might be set up in honour of the bountiful Sun God, who rose
and set to watch over the fields of his faithful worshippers. And then
the dethroned

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

river god, with his scaly tail, would sink in public estimation, and
might become "Abdallah of the sea," and his wife a mermaid, and then all
the history of the past religion would gradually sink into a nursery
tale.

Another thinker might upset the worship of fire, and point out that the
air in which the sun, and moon, and stars had their lofty being was
something greater than fire, for no animal, or man, or fire could live
without it, and a good blast of it would extinguish the best candle.

A fourth might discover, that without the earth all else was nought, and
that everything grew and had its being from the earth, and returns to
it. And so a whole host of elemental divinities might spring up from a
study of nature, flourish and decay, and so become the spirits of the
earth, and the air; the djinns of fire, and air, and water; Peris and
earthly ghouls dressed in their idol forms, and retaining shreds of
their former grandeur.

But as each new circle became too narrow for reason, one set of
despairing philosophers might come to think the whole world of nature a
fortuitous concurrence of atoms, and worship nothing at all; while a
second worshipped their own passions; and a third still pressed onwards,
and sought to know whence the atoms came, and why they concurred and how
the particular concurrence of atoms, of which they were composed,
managed to think about such things, or to think at all. Such thinkers
must be driven at last to say, "We cannot explain this; but we believe
that there is a reason greater than ours, which we cannot attain to,
beyond it all."

So nursery tales are often the debris of natural

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

religions, which are all fading away before the light of revealed
religion, but subsisted along with it before the flood. Plain men and
women are found dealing with heroes and heroines, mermaids, dragons,
great birds, and subterranean powers; the powers of water, fire, air,
and earth, who were once gods and goddesses; the elements personified,
worshipped, dethroned, and now degraded to be demons and hobgoblins,
fiends and fairies, ghosts and bogles, and monsters of land and sea. But
above and beyond all these there is always some dimly seen power greater
and more powerful than they; the hidden reason and cause towards which
every train of just reasoning must certainly tend, though it never can
reach it without its aid.

Jupiter was subject to the Fates; the world and its supporters stood
upon a tortoise, or rested upon the shoulders of Atlas, but what they
stood upon no one knew. Fairies are more powerful than mortal men, but
they are but "fallen angels," and the wise man who advised the
fisherman's son in the "Sea-maiden" was a greater power than he, or any
of the monsters which he destroyed, or the magic creatures of air,
earth, and water which aided him and his wife to overcome the evil
powers of the sea.
