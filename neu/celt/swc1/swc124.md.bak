### <span class="smallcaps">The Ghosts of Chapel-Street and St. Mary's Chapel-Yard</span>

Little more than fifty years ago, the building in Chapel-street, which
now serves as a dispensary, with the adjoining house at the entrance to
Vounderveor-lane, formed a mansion which belonged to, and was occupied
by, an elderly lady, Mrs. Baines. At that time there was, in the rear of
this mansion, a large garden, or rather orchard and garden, extending
westward nearly to New-road, and bounded on the [south](errata.htm#24.md)
by Vounderveor. The south side of the lane was an open field, and at its
west end there were no dwellings. Where the School of Art, the Methodist
vestries, and other houses stand, was all known as Mrs. Baines's
orchard. This pleasant spot, in which the lady took great delight, was
stocked with the choicest apple, pear, plum, and other fruit-trees then
known. The town-boys soon found out the fine flavour of Mrs. Baine's
fruit, which was to them all the sweeter for being stolen. When the
apples were ripe and most tempting, the mistress and her serving-man
watched the garden by turns—the man during the first part of the night,
and madam would descend in her night-dress every now and then, to see
that all was right, in the small hours of morning. One night Mrs.
Baines, suspecting that man John was rather careless in keeping guard,
sallied forth to see if he was attending to his duty; and, not finding
him anywhere about the garden, she went to a tree of highly-prized
apples and shook down a good quantity,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

intending to take them away, and thus prove to John that, through his
remissness, the fruit was stolen. But her man Jan, armed with an old
blunderbuss, charged with peas and small shot, was at no great distance
dozing under a hedge. The rustling of shaken branches, and noise of
falling apples, awoke him, and, seeing somebody, as he thought, stealing
apples from their favourite tree, he up with his gun and let fly at his
mistress, exclaiming at the same time, "Now you thief, I've paid ’e off
for keeping me out of bed to watch ’e! I know ’e I do, and will bring ’e
before his worship the mayor to-morrow!" "Lord help me, I'm killed!"
cried the lady, as she fell on the ground. Jan stayed to see no more,
but, frightened out of his wits, ran away and couldn't be found for
several days. At last he was discovered up in Castle-an-Dinas,
half-starved. By good luck the old lady's back was towards her man when
he fired, and the greatest portion of the charge took effect below her
waist. Doctor Giddy was fetched, and, after some delicate surgical
operations, which the lady bore with exemplary patience, pronounced her
fright to be more than the hurt.

However, a short time after the old lady got shot, she died; and then
she kept such ward and watch over her orchard that few were so bold as
to enter, after day-down, into the haunted ground, where the ghost of
Mrs. Baines was often seen under the tree where she was shot, or walking
the rounds of her garden. Everybody knew the old lady by her upturned
and powdered grey hair under a lace cap of antique pattern; by the long
lace ruffles hanging from her elbows; her short silk mantle, gold-headed
cane, and other trappings of old-fashioned pomp. There are many still
[living](errata.htm#25.md) in Penzance who remember the time when they
wouldn't venture on any account to pass through Vounderveor-lane after
nightfall, for fear of Mrs. Baine's ghost. Sometimes she would flutter
up from the garden or yard (just like an old hen flying before the
wind), and perch herself on the wall; then, for an instant, one might
get a glance of her spindle legs and high-heeled shoes before she
vanished. Her walking in the garden might have been put up with, but she
soon haunted all parts of the premises, and was often seen where least
expected both by night and at noonday. The ghost became to troublesome
at last, that no person could be found to occupy the house, where she
was all night long tramping about from room to room, slamming the doors,
rattling the furniture, and often making a fearful crash amongst glass
and crockery. Even when there was no living occupant in the house,
persons standing in Chapel-street, often saw through the windows a
shadowy form and lights glimmering in the parlours and bedrooms.

The proprietors, driven to their wits’ end, unwilling that such valuable
property should become worse than useless, all through the freaks of
this vexatious ghost, at last sent for a parson who was much famed in
this neighbourhood as an exorcist (we think the name of this reverend
ghost-layer was Singleton), that he might remove and lay the unresting
spirit;

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

and he succeeded (by what means our informant knoweth not) in getting
her away down to the sand-banks on the western green, which were then
spread over many acres of land where the waves now roll. Here, this
powerful parson, single-handed, bound her, to spin from the banks, ropes
of sand, for the term of a thousand years, unless she, before that time,
spun a sufficiently long and strong one to reach from St. Michael's
Mount to St. Clement's Isle. The encroaching sea having swept away the
sand-banks, Mrs. Baine's ghost is probably gone with them, as she hasn't
been heard of for some years, and, if she returns, the present occupiers
of the old abode wouldn't mind her.

Long after parson Singleton laid the old lady's ghost, many persons were
deterred from taking the house because there was a story current that
the spirit was confined to a closet in some out-of-the-way part of the
house, and that the door of this ghost's place was walled up and
plastered over, yet the sound of her spinning-wheel was frequently heard
in the upper regions of the old house.

About the time that Mrs. Baine's ghost carried on its freaks in the
above mansion, an open pathway passed through St. Mary's chapel-yard,
which was then often crossed, as it shortened the distance to the Quay;
but, for a long time, few persons liked to pass through the
burial-ground by night, because a ghostly apparition, arrayed in white,
was often seen wandering amongst the tombs, from which doleful sounds
were frequently heard. Sometimes the fearful figure was also met on the
path or seen in the chapel-porch. One dark and rainy night, however, a
sailor, who neither knew nor cared anything about the ghost of St.
Mary's, in taking the short cut through the chapel-yard, came as far as
the chapel-porch, when the ghost issued forth on the path and there
stood, bobbing its head and waving its shroudings before him.

"Holloa! who a or what are you!" said the sailor.

"I am one of the dead!" the ghost answered.

"If you are one of the dead, what the deuce do you do here above ground?
go along down below!" said the sailor, as he lifted his fist and dealt
the ghost a stunning blow over its head, which laid it sprawling on the
stones, where it remained sometime, unable to rise or descend, until a
person passing by assisted it to get on its legs, and discovered that a
frolicksome gentleman, called Captain Carthew, who then lived in the
house which is now Mrs. Davy's property, had long been diverting him-
self and frightening the town's-folk out of their wits by personating
the ghost, which was most effectually laid by jack-tar, and served out
for its tricks on the timid and the credulous.

From Penzance we take out course westward, keeping near the southern
coast, hence to the Land's-end. This route will bring us, at short
intervals, to many objects of interest,—grand and picturesque carns,
cliff-castles and caverns, celtic monuments, ancient hamlets and
mansions, with which quaint legends are associated, &c.
