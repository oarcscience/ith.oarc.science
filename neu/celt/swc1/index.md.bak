In the 19th century William Bottrell compiled three volumes of Cornish
folklore, legends and historical tales. This is the first book in that
series. Bottrell tells stories of giants, mermaids, and a gallery of
Cornish fairies including the spriggan, bucca, and the knackers, the
earth elementals who live in the tin-mines. He also describes Cornish
folk magic, and folklore about witches. The style is idiomatic, and the
episodic stories are told with touches of dialect and localized in
specific places in Cornwall. Attentive readers will notice an incredibly
politically incorrect passage where he uses language about Muslims and
Africans which will leave most shaking their heads. As per our policy
the book is presented uncut and unedited. However, the bulk of the
stories here are great fun to read and dimensionalize this little-known
Celtic byway.

<span class="small">PRODUCTION NOTES: Because a first edition was
unavailable at this time, I used the reset Frank Graham edition of 1970.
I quote the preface to that edition: 'We have not reproduced Bottrell's
book in facsimile, although it would have been considerably less
expensive...but we have included the whole work, except the List of
Subscribers.' The pagination matches this edition, not the original.
There were numerous typographic [errors](errata.md). It is unknown whether
they were in the first edition, or introduced in the modern typesetting.
Bottrell used creative spelling to reproduce Cornish dialect, including
multiple variants of the apostrophe (ca'nt, can't etc.); these I have
left intact. I hope to obtain a first edition at some point and redo the
pagination. --John Bruno Hare, 11/6/2008.</span>
