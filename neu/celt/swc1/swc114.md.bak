### <span class="smallcaps">Annual Visit of the West-Country Folks to the Pellar of Helston, to have their Protection Renewed</span>

Though Mathy lived many miles from Margaret’s new dwelling, he often
came to visit her that he might keep her garden-ground in order (as he
said), but more for the sake of a gossip about old times. He gave up his
share of the stream-work, and had but little more to do with smuggling.
The stream-work was kept by the smugglers more for its convenience in
their contraband dealings than for the sake of the tin. Soon after the
old Captn. stayed at home to cultivate his little quillets,—barley,
oats, and pillas, ever (rye-grass), and clover, were seen on his ground
in place of brambles, furze, griglans (heath), and gadjevraws (ox-eye
daisies). His cattle, having abundance of food, kept to their own
bounds, and but little troubled the neighbours. And Mathy lived in such
a sober, respectable way, that we never heard of him but once more;—that
was on the occasion of his yearly visit to the Pellar of Helston.

According to ancient usage, the folks from many parts of the west
country make their annual pilgrimage to some white witch of repute, for
the sake of having what they call "their protection renewed." The spring
is always chosen for this object, because it is believed that when the
sun is returning the Pellar has more power to protect them from bad luck
than at any other season.

As the Captn. was rather prone to indulge in a little too much drink at
such times, Aunt Joan persuaded her spouse to take along with him Jan
Tregear, that he might see the old man safe home: she couldn't well go
herself; besides, the good man much preferred her room to her company on
such an occasion, when he was sure to meet with many old cronies all as
fond of a drop as himself.

There used to be rare fun among the folks in going to the conjuror in
the spring, when they were sure to meet, at the wise man's abode,
persons of all ages and conditions, many from a great distance. Then the
inhabitants of the Scilly Isles came over in crowds for the purpose of
consulting the white witches of Cornwall, and that they might obtain
their protection, charms, spells, and counter-spells. Many of the
captains

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

of vessels, belonging to Hayle, St. Ives, and Swansea, often visited the
Pellar before they undertook a voyage, so that, with seaman and tinners,
there was sure to be great variety in the company.

The Captn. and Jan started from Zennor, the master carrying before him a
quarter of pork, and the man riding on a sack of corn, some hours before
the break of day. They left thus early, not so much for the sake of
arriving betimes at the Pellar's abode, as for keeping the when and
where of the conjuror a secret from the neighbours, many of whom were
become so wise in their own conceit as to laugh at the ancient custom,
even when they often resorted to the same practices themselves whenever
bad luck assailed them.

Though they arrived at the Pellar's by the middle of the forenoon, such
a crowd was already assembled that they waited long before their turn
came to be admitted to the presence of the wise man. The conjuror
received the people and their offerings, singly, in the room by courtesy
styled the hale (hall). Few remained closeted with him more than
half-an-hour, during which time some were provided with little bags of
earth, teeth, or bones taken from a grave. These precious relics were to
be worn, suspended from the neck, for the cure of prevention of fits,
and other mysterious complaints supposed to be brought on by witchcraft.
Others were furnished with a scrap of parchment, on which was written
the ABRACADABRA or the following charm:—

SATOR, AREPO, TENET, OPERA, ROTAS.

These charms were enclosed in a paper, curiously folded like a
valentine, sealed and suspended from the neck of the ill-wished,
spellbound, or otherwise ailing person. The last charm is regarded as an
instrument of great power, because the magical words read the same
backwards as forwards. A gritty substance called witch-powders, that
looked very much like pounded brick, was also given to those who
required it. An aged crone of the pellar blood, mother or sister of the
white witch in chief, received some of the women upstairs to cure such
of the least difficult cases, as simple charming would effect; but the
greatest part of them preferred the man, as his charms only were
powerful enough to unbewitch them.

Instead of the earthy powder, some are furnished with a written charm,
which varies according to the feelings of the recipients. Most of the
very religious folks have a verse of scripture, concluded with the
comfortable assurance that, by the help of the Lord, the White Witch
hopes to do them good.

But those who have no particular religious sentiments he furnishes with
a charm, of which the following is a literal copy:

On one side of a bit of paper, about an inch and a half by one inch,

NALGAH.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Here follows a picture of what must have been the conjuror's own
creation, as such an object was never seen by mortal eyes in the heavens
above, the earth beneath, nor in the waters under the earth. The only
object we can compare it to is a something which is a cross between a
headless cherub and a spread-eagle. Underneath what might have been
intended for angel or bird, there is an egg, on which the creature
appears to be brooding. There is another egg at the extremity of one of
the outstretched legs of the creature. This picture, which is the most
singular part of the charm, can only be represented by the aid of the
pencil. The word

TETRAGRAMMATON,

is under it. On the reverse,

JEHOVAH.  
JAH. ELOHIM.  
SHADDAY.  
ADONAY.  
HAVE MERCY ON A POOR WOMAN.

From the worn condition of the charm (which had been in use many years
before it came into our hands) it is difficult to make out the writing.

Another amulet, which is commonly given by the Pellar to his patients,
to be worn suspended from the neck, is a small bag of earth taken from a
man's grave.

Besides the above-mentioned precious charms, the Pellar gives his
neophytes powders, to throw over their children, or cattle, to preserve
them against witchcraft, ample directions as to the lucky and unlucky
times, and a green salve, which is said to be an excellent healing
ointment. I have talked with many who have visited the Pellar every
spring, for years running, that they might get their protection renewed.
Yet there is no finding out all that takes place at the time of this
important pilgrimage, as the directions are given to each individual
separately, and all are bound to preserve the greatest secrecy about
some portion of the charm, or it will do no good.

Others were supplied with blood stones, milpreves, or snake-stones, and
other trumpery, manufactured by the pellar family, to be worn as
amulets. The blue-stone rings, in which some fancied they saw the figure
of an adder, or when marked with yellow veins the pattern of a snake,
were particularly prized, because it was believed that those who wore
them were by that means safe from being h armed by any reptile of the
serpent tribe, and that man or beast, bit and envenomed, being given
some water to drink, wherein this stone had been infused, would
perfectly recover of the poison. The amulets, reliques, and charms
supplied by the white witch served to tranquillize the diseased fancy as
well as the bread pills, coloured waters, and other innocent compounds
of more

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

fashionable practitioners, or the holy medals and scapulars of other
professors. There are no new notions under the sun; the only difference
is the fashion in which they are disguised.

As Captn, Mathy brought the Pellar a liberal offering he was favoured
with an hour of the conjuror's valuable time.

"Come, Jan, boy," said the Captn., as he came out of the Peliar's
sanctum, well satisfied, "let’s be off homeward. I wish ’e well,
friends, and good luck to ’e all."

They soon arrived at the old wayside public-house near what is now
called the Buck's-head. Here, many other pilgrims to the Pellar were
collected, that they might bait themselves and their beasts.

After dinner, the afternoon was spent in telling witch stories. Everyone
present had many cases, each within his own experience, to vouch for.
They compared the merits of the different conjurors of repute, and all
agreed that none could [surpass](errata.htm#14.md) the Pellar of Helston.
Not even the "cunning man" of Bodmin nor the "white witch of Exeter"
could possess more power to lift a spell or to punish a witch, or to
find out who had stolen whatever was missed, and to put out the thief's
eye.

’Twas long after dark when Mathy and Jan left the inn. Then the old
Captn. was pretty well slewed (drunk), yet not so far gone but that he
could sit on horseback and keep his tongue going. After jogging along a
mile of two, the Captn, said, "Jacky, boy, I'm afraid I mayn't remember
all the conjuror told me to do; so now I'll tell ’e some things, and
mind thee doesn’t forget. The powder must be thrown over the backs of
the cattle, now and then, to prevent bad luck; but, of any spells of
witchcraft happed to strike, we must, after sunset, bring the ill-wished
beast into a ploughed field, there bleed it on straw, and, as the blood
and straw are burning together, the witch will either come bodily into
the field or her apparition will appear in the smoke plain enow for us
to know her. Many burn a calf alive to save the rest of their stock, and
that ensures them from bad luck for seven or nine years, I've forgotten
which, the same as bleeding a white hen on a mill-stone once in a while
prevents danger from the mill, for they say the mill will have blood
every seven years." Yet, with all the free talk about the cattle and
charms Mathy, drunk as he was, couldn't be got to say a word about the
ceremony which is said to be performed by the pellar, or priest of the
old one, to protect the persons of his patients against bad luck for the
next year.

There has always been profound secrecy observed respecting some of the
proceedings which take place between the white witch and his patients.

Master and man were so deep in the mysteries of witchcraft that they got
piskey-led when near St. Erth Praze; and, instead of taking the

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

road they intended, which would have brought them through St. Erth
church-town and out by Treloweth, they found themselves led down to
Hayle, and the old mare stopped at the door of the 'Standard' before
they discovered that they were on the wrong road.

The old inn, as usual, was all alive with sailors—drinking, singing,
dancing, and carousing. Here the Captn. was well known and as good as at
home, drinking the brandy with which he and his crew supplied the house.
Here they agreed they would rest awhile as the tide would suit for them
to cross the sands at any time till nearly daybreak. The jolly jack-tars
were delighted with the jovial old buck. He joined in the chorus of the
sailors’ roaring songs, or danced as long as he could stand. Nor did
Mathy spare the drink. But Jack Gregeer took care to keep pretty fresh,
as he was well aware of the danger of crossing Hayle sands then, which
was long before the causeway was built across the salt marsh. At that
time there was no artificial obstruction to the current which flowed up
to St. Erth bridge, and the quicksands, bars, and water-courses,
shifting with every tide and wind, made the crossing over to Lelant to
be dreaded even in broad daylight and at low water. About an hour before
day some men, on their way to work in Copperhouse, told Jan that they
had no time to spare, as the tide would soon be in. The smelters came
over two hours before work-time, that they might not have to take the
journey of several miles round by St. Erth church-town.

Captn. Mathy was mounted and set going with all speed. However drunk he
might be he could sit on horseback as steady as an oak, and to all
appearances as sober as a judge. The old grey mare, at such times, took
her own way, being well aware that she was, then, the wisest of the two.
It was clear starlight, and all went right till they were near enough to
the red muddy stream coming down from Lelant, to make out the posts and
balls, whitewashed, to serve as a guide to persons crossing the sands to
the village. Then Jan saw that they were too high up. They hadn't gone
many yards farther when the grey mare, determined to keep the lead, to
show herself the better horse, soused into a deep pit, which had been
washed out by the eddying tide, and was then full of red slime and slush
from the stamps and other tin-works up the bottom. The slime reached to
the saddle-girths. The old mare grunted and stood still, to think what
she had best do next. Mathy was so fast asleep that he only roused with
the shock to snore out, "Ah! Jackey boy, so we're come, are es? Dedn't
think we should have got home so soon. Now then, I'll get off and tumble
into bed alongside of my old ’oman. Drag off my boots a minute, west a,
before turn the mare in the craft?"

"Stay where you are, and don't ’e budge for your life," says Jan. "We
are still on Hayle sands, the old mare es stuck fast in a slime-pit, and
the tide es rising fast."

"Why thee art drunk, or dreaman," the Captn. replied; "here's the old
mare stopped at the door, and now I shall get off."

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

The tide was then flowing in and spreading over the sands like a rapid
river. Jack was aware of the danger of delay, but didn't know what way
to turn. If the Captn. got off in the mud there he would lie and die.
The old mare couldn't get out of the pit with his burthen on her back,
and not without help, even when disencumbered. By good luck, Mathy soon
fell asleep again; and it was all the same, for all that he cared,
whether he was at his own door, or fast in the pit of slime and
quicksand, with the tide rising round him.

By good luck, Jan Tregeer saw two men in great haste crossing over the
stream, on the stepping-stones a few hundred yards farther down. The
sands were two feet under water when Jan called to them "What cheer,
comrades? Come and help us, do. Here's Captn. Mathy Thomas fast asleep
and dead drunk on his old mare, stuck fast in a pit of slime and
quicksand. Corn and help us, do! The mud and sea is above the
saddle-girths," "Hold on," replied the men, "we'll get a clue of ropes
from the dock, and be to ’e in a crack." The men seeing the only way of
getting man and horse out of danger was to unhorse the rider, made a
loop in a rope's end, cast it over the Captn's head, pulled him off the
mare and out of the slime-pit in a moment. The shaking roused Mathy a
little. Whilst one of the men, with Jan, got the mare out of the pit,
the other held the old Captn, in a sitting position to keep his head
above water, which was two feet deep or more on the level sand. Next,
without opening his eyes, he shouted out, "Jacky boy! Jacky boy! woo!
Where art a, woo! Strike a light! strike a light! and fry some pork and
eggs. I'm hungry and cold rather; and how's the bed so wet as muck?" The
Captn. again fell fast asleep by the time he was once more settled on
horseback, and beating through the water, now so deep in places as to
float the horses with their riders and the two Lelant men holding fast
by the stirrups. At last they were all safely landed on the St. Erth
shore.

’Twas by a mere cat's jump they got off the sands in time to save
themselves from drowning. Many would prefer to swim their horses across
at high water(as was then often done), rather than to pass over the
sands between Lelant and Treleesec (dwelling on the dry land) or Carnsew
(rocks left dry) in that state of the tide. When once more on dry land
they passed round the salt-marsh at St. Erth Bridge, and came out into
the Penzance and Harle road at Treloweth. It was near sunrise when they
arrived at Rose-an-grouse smelting-house. They wer glad enow to rest at
the old inn of the "Lamb and Flag." Here the landlady provided them with
dry clothes and a good breakfast of pork and eggs, beef-steaks cooked on
tin, in the smelting-house close at hand, and many good things besides.

During the day, several persons came to the smelting-house with their
tin, which was then mostly carried on horses or pairs of moues (mules).
As all the carriers stopped at the public-house, to have a drink

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

with their pasties, there was a large number assembled at the "Lamb and
Flag" by noon, and more continued to arrive. Everyone knew the Captn.
and Jan, and all would treat them to drink because they had a narrow
escape from the dreaded quicksands of Hayle. Captn. Mathy made light of
the matter. It would, we said, have been all right with him and the mare
(she knew well enow what to do) if they had been left alone; for as soon
as the tide rose high enough she would swim across, as she had often
done before now, with half-a-dozen tubs of liquor and he on her back.
This he had often done for a wager, or when hard pressed by the riding
officer, who seldom ventured to follow Mathy and his mare through the
brine. As Captn. Mathy and his man Jan are now as good as at home, we
shall wish them fare-well. And what follows is merely an appendage to
their story.
