### <span class="smallcaps">Parson Spry, the Curate of Sennen & St. Levan, Half a Century Ago, and His Wooden Horse, and Dog "Sport"</span>

Before leaving this part of the town, let us cast a glance at the three
or four little cottage-like dwellings just opposite the lane leading to
the Well fields, on the higher side of the entrance to The Hollies.
These cottages were regarded as very genteel residences, half-a-century
ago, before the North Parade, and some score of other terraces, which
now form the most pleasant portions of the town, were ever thought of.
Then, the cottage nearest to The Hollies gate was the residence of the
Rev. William Spry, many years curate of Sennen and St. Levan. The
reverend gentleman was one of those eccentric, or independent,
characters who pay no regard either to conventional modes or to the
opinion of those who have no need to trouble themselves about their
harmless whims. His dapper little figure, dressed up in the most
anti-clerical not to say ridiculous, of costumes, must still be well
remembered by man in town and country. Notwithstanding his eccentric
vagaries, he was always a welcome guest, for the sake of his
never-failing good humour, quick repartee, and the droll stories of
which he was generally the hero. His most extravagant freaks were mostly
harmless, and always amusing, at least to the spectators (yet with all
the care taken to qualify his characteristics, we may have to make some
exception when the parson mounts his wooden horse).

When in the reading-room, public library, or any other place of resort
for gentleman of the town, parson Spry was always the centre of
attraction and fun. One day, in the library, he was, as usual, relating
some of his amusing drolls, when an elderly gentleman, General Tench
(who very much liked to hear himself talk), finding that he could not
have the chance to get in a word edgewise even, interrupted the parson
by saying, "Come, Mr. Spry; as you appear to know a great deal about
everything, be pleased to explain to me the difference between a major
and a minor canon?" "Pho! pho!" replied Mr. Spry, in his lisping accent,
"What a general! not to know the difference between a major canon and a
minor canon. Why a major canon is a great gun, and a minor canon is a
thun (son) of a can (gun), to be thure (sure)." The general wheeled on
his heels, and went away without firing anymore of his guns at the
parson for that day.

The rev. gentleman, finding the hire of a horse to take him to the scene
of his clerical duties, more than he could well afford out of his
slender income, took it into his head to have a velocipede, hoping, with
the assistance of that machine, to be able to ride out to the Land's-end
at his ease (hills excepted, when he would have to drag his horse). He
exercised his wooden steed, by way of breaking of it in, on the descent
from St. Just lane's end to Alverton. He was very proud of his steed,
when he found it would run down the hill with so much speed. The next

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

market day, early in the morning, the parson stationed himself, mounted
on his velocipede, on the top of Tul-tuf hill, to challenge anybody
coming from, or going to, the market to try a race, always down the hill
be it understood. Plenty of the farmers desired no better fun than to
try a race with the parson on his wooden horse; but their own nags, not
knowing what to make of the parson's queer beast, going on three legs
like the wind, in their fears and doubts about the nature of the thing
threw their riders into the ditch, and spring over the hedges, that they
might not be overtaken by what they must have thought a most
unnatural-looking affair. So the parson won the wager, and boasted long
and loud that his horse was the best in the west; but, in the last race
that Thursday morn, the three-legged Bucephalus attained such velocity
in descending the hill near Alverton that it became quite unmanageable
and fairly ran away with its gallant rider as fast as its wheels could
spin. When it came to Alverton water (there was no bridge over the water
which then worked the old factory) several market-women were on their
nags, in the midst of the pooled-up water, to let their horses drink and
breathe awhile, their heavy baskets of butter and eggs rested carelessly
in their knees, to ease their weary arms whilst having a chat, and
before they had time to seize their bridle-reins in dashed the parson,
on his horse, in the very midst of them. He tumbled over in the water,
with the machine between his legs. The women were thrown off their
horses, which galloped away—some home, some like mad into the town to
their accustomed yards and stables, others ran they didn't know where;
but fancy what a wreck was there, with the broken eggs, barm-jars,
butter, and baskets on the road, or floating down the stream! The women
were so exasperated that they half-killed the parson between them. In
the heat of their passion they pelted him with butter and eggs, then
rolled him in the mud, until luckily some gentlemen came to the rescue
of the parson and his steed.

The next Sunday, the reverend gentleman being unable to attend to his
duties at the Land's-end, his parishioners, as well as most of the
people of the west who had congregated at St. Levan church and along the
roads, hoping to see the parson racing his horse, were much
disappointed. The fame of his Thursday's adventure had spread far and
near, so that such a gathering was never seen before in the church
except at the feasten tide. Against the following Sunday the parson had
sufficiently recovered of his broken skin and his courage to be off
early in the morning, for fear of disappointing his congregation again.
The people waited long about the cliff and Rospletha-hill, looking out
in vain; at last, fearing some accident had happened, from seeing
neither sight nor sign of their pastor, a good number of them proceeded
along the road towards Penzance, two miles or more, when they saw the
parson's well-known dog, Sport, coming towards them. Sport testified his
joy at seeing some of his friends, and ran back, yelping and barking,
and looking behind him to beg the people to follow him fast. In a few
minutes, on turning

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the corner of Cotneywilley, they found the parson and his horse in a
deep pool of mud at the bottom of the hill, or rather the runaway steed
was deep in the muddy hole. The rider had contrived to scramble out and
shake himself just as they arrived. Mr. Ellis, of Trendrennen, being
among the people who came to the relief of their forlorn pastor, he was
helped along to that gentleman's house, which the parson usually made
his resting-place.

Mr. Spry never trusted his wooden horse to make such long journeys any
more, and the people of the two western parishes, who liked their parson
much, because he was very sociable (never wearied them with tiresome
platitudes, nor bothered them with what some call deep, that is,
inexplicable, dogmas and notions), were very indulgent, and never
complained whether he came early or late, or stayed away for weeks
together on account of bad weather.

The doings of the parson's handsome black dog Sport added much to the
interest of the Sunday's performances. Sport seemed to think that some
dogs belonging to his master's parishes had not so much right to enjoy
church privileges as himself. To others—larger dogs than himself—he was
more indulgent, and even condescended to wag his tail at them, but woe
to any audacious dog of a smaller size, that presumed to venture into
the more respectable, or parson's, portion of the church east of the rud
locks (rood loft). Sport would then show the rustic dogs the colour of
his teeth and drive them into the belfry, where the other country dogs
would follow to see fair play, or perhaps to give the town-bred puppy a
bite by the sly, if they saw their own comrade likely to get the worst
of the game.

One Sunday, a dog belonging to a farmer who sat near the chancel, seemed
inclined to come nearer the parson's ground than his dog liked. Both
dogs then said as plainly as looks could express, "Come then, to decide
which shall look the biggest, let’s try our right, down in the belfry,
by a quiet bit of a fight." Off walked the two dogs, began and continued
their fight without making much noise, until the parson was in the midst
of reading the second lesson. Then Sport gave some dreadful yells, which
so much alarmed his master that he stopped reading, bundled up his
surplice under his arm, ran in all haste down to the belfry, drove out
the country dog, and shut in his own by way of penance among the
shovels, brooms, pickaxes, bellropes, planks, and other lumber. When the
parson returned to the reading-desk, leaning over towards the old clerk,
he asked, "Where was I Josey?" (meaning the verse of the lesson at which
he left off). Uncle Josey, the clerk, being rather deaf, like most deaf
people spoke rather loud—loud enough to be heard all over the
church—when he intended only to whisper, "Where war ’e? What do ’e mean,
master? Why down in the belfry parting the dogs, to be sure!" Sport took
it in high dudgeon, to be imprisoned like a felon. When he found

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

barking and howling of no use towards procuring his release from durance
vile, he contrived to entangle himself in the bellrope (left dangling up
and down) by getting his head into the running noose, made by the sexton
for his foot, to assist in tolling the great bell, which Sport set a
ringing and soon rung himself out.

Another day, whilst the parson was reading the burial service over the
defunct, his dog Sport behaved himself in a very unseemly manner for
such a solemn occasion by kicking up a dust among the dry bones, howling
at the mourners, catching their dresses in his mouth, and renting off
yards of crape from the young widow, and other such like pranks. The
parson, reading, with one eye on the book, the other on the dog, at the
end of every portion where the clerk had to respond "Amen," the parson
called "Sport!" and Sport replied with a bark. At the conclusion, in the
same breath with the words, "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, I commit this
body to the ground," the parson called out louder than ever, "Sport!
Sport! come here;" turning quickly round at the same time as if to catch
the dog and bury him.
