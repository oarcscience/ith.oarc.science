# PREFACE

WHEN I am in my room looking upon the walls I have painted I see there
reflections of the personal life, but when I look through the windows I
see a living nature and landscapes not painted by hands. So, too, when I
meditate I feel in the images and thoughts which throng about me the
reflections of personality, but there are also windows in the soul
through which can be seen images created not by human but by the divine
imagination. I have tried according to my capacity to report about the
divine order and to discriminate between that which was self-begotten
fantasy and that which came from a higher sphere. These retrospects and

meditations are the efforts of an artist and poet to relate his own
vision to the vision of the seers and writers of the sacred books, and
to discover what element of truth lay in those imaginations.
