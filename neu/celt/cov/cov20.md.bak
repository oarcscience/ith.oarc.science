# CELTIC COSMOGONY

IN the beginning was the boundless Lir, an infinite depth, an invisible
divinity, neither dark nor light, in whom were all things past and to
be. There at the close of a divine day, time being ended, and the Nuts
of Knowledge harvested, the gods partake of the Feast of Age and drink
from a secret fountain. Their being there is neither life nor death nor
sleep nor dream, but all are wondrously wrought together. They lie in
the bosom of Lir, cradled in the same peace, those who hereafter shall
meet in love or war in hate. The Great Father and the Mother of the Gods
mingle together and Heaven and Earth are lost, being one in the Infinite
Lir.

Of Lir but little may be affirmed, and nothing can be revealed. In
trance alone the seer might divine beyond his ultimate vision this
being. It is a breath with many voices which cannot speak in one tone,
but utters

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

itself through multitudes. It is beyond the gods and if they were to
reveal it, it could only be through their own departure and a return to
the primeval silences. But in this is the root of existence from which
springs the sacred Hazel whose branches are the gods: and as the mystic
night trembles into dawn, its leaves and its blossoms and its starry
fruit burgeon simultaneously and are shed over the waters of space. An
image of futurity has arisen in the divine imagination: and Sinan, who
is also Dana, the Great Mother and Spirit of Nature, grows thirsty to
receive its imprint on her bosom, and to bear again her offspring of
stars and starry beings. Then the first fountain is opened and seven
streams issue like seven fiery whirlwinds, and Sinan is carried away and
mingled with the torrent, and when the force of the torrent is broken,
Sinan also meets death.

What other names Connla's Well and the Sacred Hazel have in Celtic
tradition may be discovered later, but here, without reference to names,
which only bewilder until their significance is made known, it is better
to explain with less of symbol this Celtic Cosmogenesis.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

We have first of all Lir, an infinite being, neither spirit nor energy
nor substance, but rather the spiritual form of these, in which all the
divine powers, raised above themselves, exist in a mystic union or
trance. This is the night of the gods from which Mananan first awakens,
the most spiritual divinity known to the ancient Gael, being the Gaelic
equivalent of that Spirit which breathed on the face of the waters. He
is the root of existence from which springs the Sacred Hazel, the symbol
of life ramifying everywhere: and the forms of this life are conceived
first by Mananan, the divine imagination. It throws itself into seven
forms or divinities, the branches of the Hazel; and these again break
out endlessly into leaves and blossoms and fruit, into myriads of divine
beings, the archetypes and ancestral begetters of those spirits who are
the Children of Lir. All these are first in the Divine Darkness and are
unrevealed, and Mananan is still the unuttered Word, and is in that
state the Chaldaic oracle of Proclus saith of the Divine Mind: "It had
not yet gone forth, but abode in the Paternal Depth, and in the adytum
of god-nourished Silence."

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But Mananan, while
one in essence with the Paternal Lir, is yet, as the divine imagination,
a separate being to whom, thus brooding, Lir seems apart, or covered
over with a veil, and this aspect of Lir, a mirage which begins to cover
over true being, is Dana, the Hibernian Mother of the Gods, or Sinan in
the antique Dinnshenchus, deity first viewed externally, and therefore
seeming to partake of the nature of substance, and, as the primal form
of matter, the Spirit of Nature. Mananan alone of all the gods exists in
the inner side of this spirit, and therefore it is called his mantle,
which, flung over man or god, wraps them from the gaze of embodied
beings. His mantle, the Faed Fia, has many equivalents in other
mythologies. It is the Aether within which Zeus runs invisibly, and the
Akasa through which Brahm sings his eternal utterance of joy. The mantle
of Mananan, the Aether, the Akasa, were all associated with Sound as a
creative power, for to the mystic imagination of the past the world was
upsung into being; and what other thought inspired the apostle who
wrote, "In the beginning was the Word"?

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

Out of the Divine Darkness Mananan has arisen, a brooding twilight
before dawn, in which the cloud images of the gods are thronging. But
there is still in Lir an immense deep of being, an emotional life too
vast, too spiritual, too remote to speak of, for the words we use to-day
cannot tell its story. It is the love yet unbreathed, and yet not love,
but rather a hidden unutterable tenderness, or joy, or the potency of
these, which awakens as the image of the divine imagination is reflected
in the being of the Mother, and then it rushes forth to embrace it. The
Fountain beneath the Hazel has broken. Creation is astir. The Many are
proceeding from the One. An energy or love or eternal desire has gone
forth which seeks through a myriad forms of illusion for the infinite
being it has left. It is Angus the Young, an eternal joy becoming love,
a love changing into desire, and leading on to earthly passion and
forgetfulness of its own divinity. The eternal joy becomes love when it
has first merged itself in form and images of a divine beauty dance
before it and lure it afar. This is the first manifested world, the
Tirnanoge or World of Immortal Youth.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The love is
changed into desire as it is drawn deeper into nature, and this desire
builds up the Mid-world or World of the Waters. And, lastly, as it lays
hold of the earthly symbol of its desire it becomes on Earth that
passion which is spiritual death. In another sense Angus may be
described as the passing into activity of a power latent in Lir, working
through the divine imagination, impressing its ideations on nature in
its spiritual state, and thereby causing its myriad transformations. It
is the fountain in which every energy has its birth, from the power
which lays the foundations of the world, down through love and every
form of desire to chemical affinity, just as Mananan is the root of all
conscious life, from the imperial being of the gods down to the
consciousness in the ant or amœba. So is Dana also the basis of every
material form from the imperishable body of the immortals to the
transitory husk of the gnat. As this divinity emerges from its
primordial state of ecstatic tenderness or joy in Lir, its divided rays,
incarnate in form, enter upon a threefold life of spiritual love, of
desire, and the dark shadow of love; and these three states have for

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

themselves three worlds into which they have transformed the primal
nature of Dana: a World of Immortal Youth: a Mid-world where everything
changes with desire: and which is called from its fluctuations the World
of the Waters: and lastly, the Earth-world where matter has assumed that
solid form when it appears inanimate or dead. The force of the fountain
which whirled Sinan away has been spent and Sinan has met death.

The conception of Angus as an all-pervading divinity who first connects
being with non-being seems removed by many aeons of thought from that
beautiful golden-haired youth who plays on the tympan surrounded by
singing birds. But the golden-haired Angus of the bards has a relation
to the earlier Eros, for in the mysteries of the Druids all the gods
sent bright witnesses of their boundless being, who sat enthroned in the
palaces of the Sidhe, and pointed the way to the Land of Promise to the
man who dared become more than man.

But what in reality is Angus and what is Dana, and how can they be made
real to us? They will not be gained by much reading of

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

the legendary tales, for they are already with us. A child sits on the
grass and the sunlight falls about it. It is lulled by the soft colour.
It grows dreamy, a dreaminess filled with a vague excitement. It feels a
pleasure, a keen magnetic joy at the touch of earth: or it lays its head
in a silent tenderness nigh a mother or sister, its mood impelling it to
grow nearer to something it loves. That tenderness in the big dreamy
heart of childhood is Angus, and the mother-love it divines is Dana; and
the form which these all-pervading divinities take in the heart of the
child and the mother, on the one side desire, on the other a profound
tenderness or pity, are nearest of all the moods of earth to the first
Love and the Mighty Mother, and through them the divine may be vaguely
understood. If the desire remains pure, through innocence, or by reason
of wisdom, it becomes in the grown being a constant preoccupation with
spiritual things, or in words I have quoted before where it is better
said, "The inexpressible yearning of the inner man to go out into the
infinite."

Of Dana, the Hibernian Mother of the gods, I have already said she is
the first

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

spiritual form of matter, and therefore Beauty. As every being emerges
out of her womb clothed with form, she is the Mighty Mother, and as
mother of all she is that divine compassion which exists beyond and is
the final arbiter of the justice of the gods. Her heart will be in ours
when ours forgive.
