# IMAGINATION

IN all I have related hitherto imagination was not present but only
vision. These are too often referred to as identical, and in what I have
written I have tried to make clear the distinction. If beyond my window
I see amid the manifolded hills a river winding ablaze with light,
nobody speaks of what is seen as a thing imagined, and if I look out of
a window of the soul and see more marvels of shining and shadow, neither
is this an act of imagination, which is indeed a higher thing than
vision, and a much rarer thing, for in the act of imagination that which
is hidden in being, as the Son in the bosom of the Father, is made
manifest and a transfiguration takes place like that we imagine in the
Spirit when it willed, "Let there be light." Imagination is not a vision
of something which already exists, and which in itself must be unchanged
by the act of seeing,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

but by imagination what exists in latency or essence is out-realised and
is given a form in thought, and we can contemplate with full
consciousness that which hitherto had been unrevealed, or only
intuitionally surmised. In imagination there is a revelation of the self
to the self, and a definite change in being, as there is in a vapour
when a spark ignites it and it becomes an inflammation in the air. Here
images appear in consciousness which we may refer definitely to an
internal creator, with power to use or remould pre-existing forms, and
endow them with life, motion and voice. We infer this because dream and
vision sometimes assume a symbolic character and a significance which is
personal to us. They tell us plainly, "For you only we exist," and we
cannot conceive of what is seen as being a reflection of life in any
sphere. In exploring the ancestry of the symbolic vision we draw nigh to
that clouded majesty we divine in the depths of our being, and which is
heard normally in intuition and conscience, but which now reveals
character in its manifestation as the artist in his work. I had a gay
adventure when I was a boy at the beginning of my mental travelling,
when I met, not a lion, but a symbolic vision in

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the path. I had read somewhere of one whose dreams made a continuous
story from night to night, and I was excited at this and wondered
whether I too could not build up life for myself in a fairyland of my
own creation, and be the lord of this in dream, and offset the petty
circumstance of daily life with the beauty of a realm in which I would
be king. I bent myself to this, walking about the country roads at night
in the darkness, building up in fantasy the country of sleep. I remember
some of my gorgeous fancies. My dream-world was self-shining. Light was
born in everything there at dawn, and faded into a coloured gloom at
eve, and if I walked across my lawns in darkness the grasses stirred by
my feet would waken to vivid colour and glimmer behind me in a trail of
green fire; or if a bird was disturbed at night in my shadowy woods it
became a winged jewel of blue, rose, gold and white, and the leaves
tipped by its wings would blaze in flakes of emerald flame, and there
were flocks of wild birds that my shouts would call forth to light with
glittering plumage the monstrous dusk of the heavens. Many other fancies
I had which I now forget, and some of them were intuitions about the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Many-Coloured
Land. After I had conceived this world, one night in a fury of effort I
willed that it should be my habitation in dream. But of all my dreams I
remember only two. In the first I saw a mass of pale clouds, and on them
was perched a little ape clutching at the misty substance with its
fingers and trying to fashion it to some form. It looked from its work
every now and then at something beyond and below the clouds, and I came
closer in my dream and saw that what the ape was watching was our earth
which spun below in space, and it was trying to model a sphere of mist
in mimicry of that which spun past it. While I was intent, this
grotesque sculptor turned suddenly, looking at me with an extraordinary
grimace which said clearly as words could say, "That is what you are
trying to do," and then I was whirled away again and I was the tiniest
figure in vast mid-air, and before me was a gigantic gate which seemed
lofty as the skies, and a shadowy figure filled the doorway and barred
my passage. That is all I can remember, and I am forced by dreams like
this to conclude there is a creator of such dreams within us, for I
cannot suppose that anywhere

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

in space or time a little ape sat on a cloud and tried to fashion it
into planetary form. The creator of that vision was transcendent to the
waking self and to the self which experienced the dream. for neither
self took conscious part in the creation. The creator of that vision was
seer into my consciousness in waking and in sleep, for what of the
vision I remember was half a scorn of my effort and half a warning that
my ambition was against natural law. The creator of that vision could
combine forms and endow them with motion and life for the vision was
intellectual and penetrated me with its meaning. Is it irrational to
assume so much. or that the vision indicated a peculiar character in its
creator, and that the ironic mood was not alien to it nor even humour? I
am rather thankful to surmise this of a self which waves away so many of
our dreams and joys, and which seems in some moods to be remote from the
normal and terrible as the angel with the flaming sword pointing every
way to guard the Tree of Life. In this dream some self of me, higher in
the tower of our being which reaches up to the heavens, made objective
manifestations of its thought; but there were moments when it seemed
itself to

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

descend, wrapping its memories of heaven about it like a cloth, and to
enter the body, and I knew it as more truly myself than that which began
in my mother's womb, and that it was antecedent to anything which had
body in the world. Here I must return to those imaginations I had
walking about the country roads as a boy, and select from these, as I
have done from vision, things upon which the reason may be brought to
bear. It is more difficult, for when there is divine visitation the
mortal is made dark and blind with glory and, in its fiery fusion with
the spirit, reason is abased or bewildered or spreads too feeble a net
to capture Leviathan, for often we cannot after translate to ourselves
in memory what the spirit said, though every faculty is eager to gather
what is left after the visitation even as the rabble in eastern legend
scramble to pick up the gold showered in the passing of the king. By the
time I was seventeen or eighteen my brain began to flicker with vivid
images. I tried to paint these, and began with much enthusiasm a series
of pictures which were to illustrate the history of man from his birth
in the Divine Mind where he glimmered first in the darkness of chaos in
vague and monstrous forms

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

growing ever nigher to the human, to men beasts and men birds, until at
last the most perfect form, the divine idea of man, was born in space. I
traced its descent into matter, its conflict with the elements, and
finally the series ended in a pessimistic fancy where one of our
descendants millions of years hence, a minute philosopher, a creature
less than three inches in height, sat on one of our gigantic skulls and
watched the skies ruining back into their original chaos and the stars
falling from their thrones on the height. Most of these pictures were
only the fancies of a boy, but in considering one of the series I began
to feel myself in alliance with a deeper consciousness, and that was
when I was trying to imagine the apparition in the Divine Mind of the
idea of the Heavenly Man. Something ancient and eternal seemed to
breathe through my fancies. I was blinded then by intensity of feeling
to the demerits of the picture, but I was excited in an extraordinary
way over what I had done, and I lay awake long into the night brooding
over it. I asked myself what legend I would write under the picture.
Something beyond reason held me, and I felt like one who is in a dark
room and hears the

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

breathing of another creature, and himself waits breathless for its
utterance, and I struggled to understand what wished to be said, and at
last, while I was preternaturally dilated and intent, something
whispered to me, "Call it the Birth of Aeon." The word "Aeon" thrilled
me, for it seemed to evoke by association of ideas, moods and memories
most ancient, out of some ancestral life where they lay hidden; and I
think it was the following day that, still meditative and clinging to
the word as a lover clings to the name of the beloved, a myth incarnated
in me, the story of an Aeon, one of the first starry emanations of
Deity, one pre-eminent in the highest heavens, so nigh to Deity and so
high in pride that he would be not less than a god himself and would
endure no dominion over him save the law of his own will. This Aeon of
my imagination revolted against heaven and left its courts, descending
into the depths where it mirrored itself in chaos, weaving out of the
wild elements a mansion for its spirit. That mansion was our earth and
that Aeon was the God of our world. This myth incarnated in me as a boy
walking along the country roads in Armagh. I returned to Dublin after a
fortnight and it was

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

a day or two after that I went into the Library at Leinster House and
asked for an art journal. I stood by a table while the attendant
searched for the volume. There was a book lying open there. My eye
rested on it. It was a dictionary of religions, I think, for the first
word my eye caught was "Aeon" and it was explained as a word used by the
Gnostics to designate the first created beings. I trembled through my
body. At that time I knew nothing of mystical literature and indeed
little of any literature except such tales as a boy reads, and the
imaginations which had begun to overwhelm me were to me then nothing but
mere imaginations, and were personal and unrelated in my mind with any
conception of truth, or idea that the imagination could lay hold of
truth. I trembled because I was certain I had never heard the word
before, and there rushed into my mind the thought of pre-existence and
that this was memory of the past. I went away hurriedly that I might
think by myself, but my thoughts drove me back again soon, and I asked
the librarian who were the Gnostics and if there was a book which gave
an account of their ideas. He referred me to a volume of Neander's
*Church History*, and there, in the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

section dealing with the Sabaeans, I found the myth of the proud Aeon
who mirrored himself in chaos and became the lord of our world. I
believed then, and still believe, that the immortal in us has memory of
all its wisdom, or, as Keats puts it in one of his letters, there is an
ancestral wisdom in man and we can if we wish drink that old wine of
heaven. This memory of the spirit is the real basis of imagination, and
when it speaks to us we feel truly inspired and a mightier creature than
ourselves speaks through us. I remember how pure, holy and beautiful
these imaginations seemed, how they came like crystal water sweeping
aside the muddy current of my life, and the astonishment I felt, I who
was almost inarticulate, to find sentences which seemed noble and full
of melody sounding in my brain as if another and greater than I had
spoken them; and how strange it was also a little later to write without
effort verse, which some people still think has beauty, while I could
hardly, because my reason had then no mastery over the materials of
thought, pen a prose sentence intelligently. I am convinced that all
poetry is, as Emerson said, first written in the heavens, that is, it is
conceived by a self

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

deeper than appears in normal life, and when it speaks to us or tells us
its ancient story we taste of eternity and drink the Soma juice, the
elixir of immortality.
