# EARTH

I THINK of earth as the floor of a cathedral where altar and Presence
are everywhere. This reverence came to me as a boy listening to the
voice of birds one coloured evening in summer, when suddenly birds and
trees and grass and tinted air and myself seemed but one mood or
companionship, and I felt a certitude that the same spirit was in all. A
little breaking of the barriers and being would mingle with being.
Whitman writes of the earth that it is rude and incomprehensible at
first. "But I swear to you," he cries, "that there are divine things
well hidden." Yet they are not so concealed that the lover may not
discover them, and to the lover nature reveals herself like a shy maiden
who is slowly drawn to one who adores her at a distance, and who is
first acknowledged by a lifting of the veil, a long-remembered glance, a
glimmering smile, and at last comes speech

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

and the mingling of life with life. So the lover of Earth obtains his
reward, and little by little the veil is lifted of an inexhaustible
beauty and majesty. It may be he will be tranced in some spiritual
communion, or will find his being overflowing into the being of the
elements, or become aware that they are breathing their life into his
own. Or Earth may become on an instant all faery to him, and earth and
air resound with the music of its invisible people. Or the trees and
rocks may waver before his eyes and become transparent, revealing what
creatures were hidden from him by the curtain, and he will know as the
ancients did of dryad and hamadryad, of genii of wood and mountain. Or
earth may suddenly blaze about him with supernatural light in some
lonely spot amid the hills, and he will find he stands as the prophet in
a place that is holy ground, and he may breathe the intoxicating
exhalations as did the sibyls of old. Or his love may hurry him away in
dream to share in deeper mysteries, and he may see the palace chambers
of nature where the wise ones dwell in secret, looking out over the
nations, breathing power into this man's heart or that man's brain, on
any who appear to their vision to wear

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the colour of truth. So gradually the earth lover realises the golden
world is all about him in imperishable beauty, and he may pass from the
vision to the profounder beauty of being, and know an eternal love is
within and around him, pressing upon him and sustaining with infinite
tenderness his body, his soul and his spirit.

I have obscured the vision of that being by dilating too much on what
was curious, but I desired to draw others to this meditation, if by
reasoning it were possible to free the intellect from its own fetters,
so that the imagination might go forth, as Blake says, "in uncurbed
glory." So I stayed the vision which might have been art, or the ecstasy
which might have been poetry, and asked of them rather to lead me back
to the ancestral fountain from which they issued. I think by this
meditation we can renew for ourselves the magic and beauty of Earth, and
understand the meaning of things in the sacred books which had grown
dim. We have so passed away from vital contact with divine powers that
they have become for most names for the veriest abstractions. and those
who read do not know that the Mighty Mother is that Earth on which they
tread and whose holy

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

substance they call common clay; or that the Paraclete is the strength
of our being, the power which binds atom to atom and Earth to Heaven: or
that the Christos is the Magician of the Beautiful and that it is not
only the Architect of the God-world but is that in us which sees beauty,
creates beauty, and it is verily wisdom in us and is our deepest self;
or that the Father is the fountain of substance and power and wisdom,
and that we could not lift an eyelash but that we have our being in Him.
When we turn from books to living nature we begin to understand the
ancient wisdom, and it is no longer an abstraction. for the Great Spirit
whose home is in the vast becomes for us a moving glamour in the
heavens, a dropping tenderness at twilight, a visionary light in the
hills, a voice in the heart. the Earth underfoot becomes sacred, and the
air we breathe is like wine poured out for us by some heavenly
cupbearer.

As we grow intimate with earth we realise what sweet and august things
await humanity when it goes back to that forgotten mother. Who would be
ambitious, who would wish to fling a name like Caesar's in the air, if
he saw what thrones and majesties awaited the

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

heavenly adventurer? Who would hate if he could see beneath the husk of
the body the spirit which is obscured and imprisoned there, and how it
was brother to his own spirit and all were children of the King? Who
would weary of nature or think it a solitude once the veil had been
lifted for him, once he had seen that great glory? Would they not long
all of them for the coming of that divine hour in the twilights of time,
when out of rock, mountain, water, tree, bird, beast or man the seraph
spirits of all that live shall emerge realising their kinship, and all
together, fierce things made gentle, and timid things made bold, and
small made great, shall return to the Father Being and be made one in
Its infinitudes.

When we attain this vision nature will melt magically before our eyes,
and powers that seem dreadful, things that seemed abhorrent in her will
reveal themselves as brothers and allies. Until then she is unmoved by
our conflicts and will carry on her ceaseless labours.

No sign is made while empires pass.  
The flowers and stars are still His care,  
The constellations hid in grass,  
The golden miracles in air. <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

Life in an instant will be rent  
When death is glittering, blind and wild,  
The Heavenly Brooding is intent  
To that last instant on Its child.

It breathes the glow in brain and heart.  
Life is made magical. Until  
Body and spirit are apart  
The Everlasting works Its will.

In that wild orchid that your feet  
In their next falling shall destroy,  
Minute and passionate and sweet,  
The Mighty Master holds His joy.

Though the crushed jewels droop and fade  
The Artist's labours will not cease,  
And from the ruins shall be made  
Some yet more lovely masterpiece.
