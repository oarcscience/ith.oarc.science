Notice

In WEST KERRY was partly re-written from articles which appeared in the
*Shanachie,* where some of IN WICKLOW also appeared; the remainder of
the Wicklow articles were originally published in the

Manchester Guardian.

The publishers desire to thank the editors of the *Manchester Guardian*
and the *Shanachie* for permission to reprint the articles which
appeared in their columns.
