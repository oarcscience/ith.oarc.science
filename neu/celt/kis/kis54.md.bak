V

Without hap or mishap we came at last to the domain of the King of
Senlabor. Baun went to sing for the King's foster-daughters, and Deelish
went to work at the little loom in the King's chamber. We were not long
at the court of the King of Senlabor when two youths came there from the
court of the King of Ireland--Dermott and Downal were their names. There
was a famous sword-smith with the King of Senlabor and these two came to
learn the trade from him. And my two foster-sisters fell so deeply in
love with the two youths that every night the pillow on each side of me
was wet with their tears.

I went to work in the King's kitchen. Now the King had a dish of such
fine earthware and with such beautiful patterns upon it that he never
let it be carried from the Kitchen to the Feast-Hall, nor from the
Feast-Hall to the Kitchen without going himself behind the servant who
carried it. One day the servant brought it into the Kitchen to be washed
and the King came behind the servant. I took the dish and cleaned it
with thrice-boiled water and dried it with cloths of three different
kinds. Then I covered it with sweet-smelling herbs and left it in a bin
where it was sunk in soft bran. The King was pleased to see the good
care I took of his dish, and he said before his servant that he would do
me any favor I would ask. There and then I told him about my two
foster-sisters Baun and Deelish, and how they were in love with the two
youths Dermott and Downal who had come from the court of the King of
Ireland. I asked that when these two youths were being given wives, that
the King should remember my foster-sisters.

The King was greatly vexed at my request. He declared that the two
youths had on their breasts the stars that denoted the sons of Kings and
that he intended they should marry his own two foster-daughters when the
maidens were of age to wed. "It may be," he said, "that these two youths
will bring what my Queen longs for--a berry from the Fairy Rowan Tree
that is guarded by the Giant Crom Duv."

The next day the King's Councillor was feeding the birds and I was
sifting the corn. I asked him what was the history of the Fairy Rowan
Tree that the Giant Crom Duv guarded and why it was that the Queen
longed for a berry of it. There and then he told me this story:--
