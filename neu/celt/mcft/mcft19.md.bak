# The Ridere of Riddles

THERE was a king once, and he married a great lady, and she departed on
the birth of her first son. And a little after this the king married
another wife, and she too had a son. The two lads grew up tall and
strong. Then it struck the queen that it was not her son who would come
into the kingdom; and she set it before her that she would poison the
eldest son. And so she sent advice to the cooks that they should put
poison in the drink of the heir; but as luck was in it, the youngest
brother heard them, and he told his brother not to take the draught, nor
to drink it at all; and so he did. But the queen wondered that the lad
was not dead; and she thought that there was not enough of poison in the
drink, and she asked the cook to put in more on the second night. It was
thus they did: and when the cook made up the drink, she said that be
would not be long alive after this draught. But his brother heard this
also, and told him likewise. The eldest thought be would put the draught
into a little bottle, and he said to his brother-" If I stay in this
house I have no doubt she will do for me some way or other, and the
quicker I leave the house the better. I will take the world for my
pillow, and there is no knowing what fortune will be on me. His brother
said that he would go with him, and they took themselves off to the
stable, and they put saddles on two horses and they took their soles out
of that.

They had not gone very far from the house when the eldest one said-"
There is no knowing if poison was in the drink at all, though we went
away. Try it in the horse's ear and we shall see." The horse did not go
far before he fell. "That was only a rattle-bones of a horse anyway,"
said the eldest one, and they got up together on the other horse, and so
they went forwards. " But," said he, "I can scarce believe that there is
any poison in the drink; let's try it on this horse." That he did, and
they went not far when the horse fell cold dead. They thought they'd
take the hide off him, and that it would keep them warm at night which
was close at hand. In the morning when they woke they saw twelve ravens
come and light on the carcase of the horse, and they were not long there
when they fell down dead.

They went and lifted the ravens, and they took then' with them, and the
first town they reached they gave the ravens to a baker, and they asked
him to make a dozen pies of the ravens. They took the pies with them,
and they went forward on their journey. About the mouth of night, and
when they were in a great thick wood, there came four and twenty robbers
who bade them to deliver up their purses; but they said that they had no
purse, but only a little food which they were carrying with them. "Good
is even meat !" said the robbers, and they began to eat it, but had not
eaten much when they fell hither and thither, all stone dead. When they
saw that the robbers were dead they ransacked their pockets, and got
much gold and silver. They went forward till they reached the Knight of
Riddles.

The house of the Knight of Riddles was in the finest place in that
country, and if his house was pretty, his daughter was prettier, and she
had twelve inaldens with her only less fair than she. Her like was not
on the surface of the world, altogether so handsome was she; and no one
would get her to marry but the man who could put a question to her
father that he could not solve. The brothers thought that they would go
and try to put a question to him' and the youngest was to stand in place
of gillie to the elder brother. They reached the house of the Knight of
Riddles and this was the question they put to him - " One killed two,
and two killed twelve, and twelve killed four and twenty, and two got
out of it;" and they were to be kept in great majesty and high honour
till he should solve the riddle.

They were thus a while with the Ridere, and try as he might he could not
guess the riddle. On a day of days came one of the maidens who were with
the knight's daughter to the gillie, and asked him to tell her the
question. He took her plaid from her and let her go, but he told her
nothing. The same thing happened to the twelve maidens, day after day,
and the gillie said to the last one that no creature had the answer to
the riddle but his master down below. One day after this came the
knight's daughter to the eldest brother, and looking her finest and
handsomest, and she asked him to tell her the question. And now there
was no refusing her, and he told her, but he kept her plaid. The Knight
of Riddles sent for him, and he gave him the answer of the riddle. And
the knight said that he had two choices to lose his head, or to be set
adrift in a crazy boat without food or drink, without oar or scoop. The
elder brother spoke, and he said - " I have another riddle to put to
thee before all these things happen." "Say on," said the knight. "
Myself and my gillie were one day in the forest shooting. My gillie
fired at a hare, and she fell, and he took her skin off*,* and let her
go; and so he did to twelve, he took their skins off and let them go.
And at last came a great fine hare, and I myself fired at her, and I
took her skin off, and I let her go." "Indeed thy riddle is not hard to
solve, my lad," said the knight, and he knew the lad knew he had not
really guessed the riddle, but had been told the answer. So he gave him
his daughter to wife, to make him hold his peace, and they made a great
hearty wedding that lasted a day and a year. The youngest one went home
now that his brother had got so well on his way, and the eldest brother
gave him every right over the kingdom that was at home.

Now there were near the march of the kingdom of the Knight of Riddles
three giants, and they were always murdering and slaying sume of the
knight's people, and taking spoil from them. On a day of days the Knight
of Riddles said to his son-in-law, that if the spirit of a man were in
him, he would go to kill the giants, as they were always bringing such
losses on the country. Well, so it was, he went and he met the giants,
and he came home with the three giants' heads, and he threw them at the
knight's feet.

"Thou art an able lad doubtless, and thy name hereafter is the Hero of
the White Shield." The name of the Hero of the White Shield went far and
near.

Meanwhile the brother of the Hero of the White Shield had wandered afar
in many countries, and after long years had come to the land of the
giants where the Hero of the White Shield was now dwelling, and the
knight's daughter with him. His brother came and he asked to make a
*covrag* or fight as a bull with him. The men began at each other, and
they took to wrestling from morning till evening. At last and at length,
when they were tired, weak, and spent, the Hero of the White Shield
jumped over a great rampart, and he asked the stranger to meet him in
the morning. This leap put the other to shame, and he said to him, "Well
may it be that thou wilt not be so supple about this time to-morrow. The
young brother now went to a poor little bothy that was near to the house
of the Hero of the White Shield, tired and drowsy, and in the morning
they dared the fight again. And the Hero of the White Shield began to go
back, till he went backwards into a river. "There must be some of my
blood in thee before that was done to me." "Of what blood art thou ?"
said the youngest. "'Tis I am son of Ardan, great King of the Albann." "
'Tis I am thy brother." It was now they knew each other. They gave luck
and welcome to each other, and the Hero of the White Shield now took him
into the palace, and she it was that was pleased to see him-the knight's
daughter. He stayed a while with them, and after that he thought that he
would go home to his own kingdom and when he was going past a great
palace that was there he saw twelve men playing at shinny over against
the palace. He thought he would go for a while and play shinny with them
; but they were not long playing shinny when they fell out, and the
weakest of them caught him and shook him as he would a child. He thought
it was no use for him to lift a hand amongst these twelve worthies, and
he asked them to whom they were sons. They said they were children of
the one father, the brother of the Hero of the White Shield, who had not
been heard of for many years. "I am your father," said he ; and he asked
them if their mother was alive. They said that she was. He went with
them till he found the mother, and he took her home with him and the
twelve sons ; and I don't know but that his seed are kings on Alba till
this very day.
