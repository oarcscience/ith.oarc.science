# The Fate of the Children of Lir

IT happened that the five Kings of Ireland met to determine who should
have the head kingship over them, and King Lir of the Hill of the White
Field expected surely he would be elected. When the nobles went into
council together they chose for head king, Dearg, son of Daghda, because
his father had been so great a Druid and he was the eldest of his
father's sons. But Lir left the Assembly of the Kings and went home to
the Hill of the White Field. The other kings would have followed after
Lir to give him wounds of spear and wounds of sword for not yielding
obedience to the man to whom they had given the over-lordship. But Dearg
the king would not hear of it and said: "Rather let us bind him to us by
the bonds of kinship, so that peace may dwell in the land. Send over to
him for wife the choice of the three maidens of the fairest form and
best repute in Erin, the three daughters of Oilell of Aran, my own three
bosom-nurslings."

So the messengers brought word to Lir that Dearg the king would give him
a foster-child of his foster-children. Lir thought well of it, and set
out next day with fifty chariots from the Hill of the White Field. And
he came to the Lake of the Red Eye near Killaloe. And when Lir saw the
three daughters of Oilell, Dearg the king said to him:

"Take thy choice of the maidens, Lir." '' I know not," said Lir, "which
is the choicest of them all ; but the eldest of them is the noblest, it
is she I had best take." " If so," said Dearg the king, "Ove is the
eldest, and she shall be given to thee, if thou willest." So Lir and Ove
were married and went back to the Hill of the White Field.

And after this there came to them twins, a son and a daughter, and they
gave them for names Fingula and Aod. And two more sons came to them,
Fiachra and Conn. When they came Ove died, and Lir mourned bitterly for
her, and but for his great love for his children he would have died of
his grief. And Dearg the king grieved for Lir and sent to him and said:
"We grieve for Ove for thy sake; but, that our friendship may not be
rent asunder, I will give unto thee her sister, Oifa, for a wife." So
Lir agreed, and they were united, and he took her with him to his own
house. And at first Oifa felt affection and honour for the children of
Lir and her sister, and indeed every one who saw the four children could
not help giving them the love of his soul. Lir doted upon the children,
and they always slept in beds in front of their father, who used to rise
at early dawn every morning and lie down among his children. But
thereupon the dart of jealousy passed into Oifa on account of this and
she came to regard the children with hatred and enmity. One day her
chariot was yoked for her and she took with her the four children of Lir
in it. Fingula was not willing to go with her on the journey, for she
had dreamed a dream in the night warning her against Oifa : but she was
not to avoid her fate. And when the chariot came to the Lake of the
Oaks, Oifa said to the people : "Kill the four children of Lir and I
will give you your own reward of every kind in the world." But they
refused and told her it was an evil thought she had. Then she would have
raised a sword herself to kill and destroy the children, but her own
womanhood and her weakness prevented her; so she drove the children of
Lir into the lake to bathe, and they did as Oifa told them. As soon as
they were upon the lake she struck them with a Druid's wand of spells
and wizardry and put them into the forms of four beautiful, perfectly
white swans, and she sang this song over them:

"Out with you upon the wild waves, children of the king!  
Henceforth your cries shall be with the flocks of birds."

And Fingula answered:

"Thou witch ! we know thee by thy right name !  
Thou mayest drive us from wave to wave,  
But sometimes we shall rest on the headlands  
We shall receive relief, but thou punishment.  
Though our bodies may be upon the lake,  
Our minds at least shall fly homewards."

And again she spoke : "Assign an end for the ruin and woe which thou
hast brought upon us."

Oifa laughed and said " Never shall ye be free until the woman from the
south be united to the man from the north, until Lairgnen of Connaught
wed Deoch of Munster; nor shall any have power to bring you out of these
forms.

Nine hundred years shall you wander over the lakes and streams of Erin.
This only I will grant unto you: that you retain your own speech, and
there shall be no music in the world equal to yours, the plaintive music
you shall sing." This she said because repentance seized her for the
evil she had done.

And then she spake this lay

"Away from me, ye children of Lir,  
Henceforth the sport of the wild winds  
Until Lairgnen and Deoch come together,  
Until ye are on the north-west of Red Erin.

"A sword of treachery is through the heart of Lir,  
Of Lir the mighty champion,  
Yet though I have driven a sword.  
My victory cuts me to the heart."

Then she turned her steeds and went on to the Hall of Dearg the king.
The nobles of the court asked her where were the children of Lir, and
Oifa said : " Lir will not trust them to Dearg the king." But Dearg
thought in his own mind that the woman had played some treachery upon
them, and he accordingly sent messengers to the Hall of the White Field.

Lir asked the messengers "Wherefore are ye come? "

"To fetch thy children, Lir," said they.

"Have they not reached you with Oifa ?" said Lir.

They have not," said the messengers; "and Oifa said it was you would not
let the children go with her."

Then was Lir melancholy and sad at heart, hearing these things, for he
knew that Oifa had done wrong upon his children, and he set out towards
the Lake of the Red Eye. And when the children of Lir saw him coming
Fingula sang the lay :

"Welcome the cavalcade of steeds  
Approaching 'the Lake of the Red Eye,  
A company dread and magical  
Surely seek after us.

"Let us move to the shore, O Aod,  
Fiachra and comely Conn,  
No host under heaven can those horsemen be  
But King Lir with his mighty household."

Now as she said this King Lir had come to the shores of the lake and
heard the swans speaking with human voices. And he spake to the swans
and asked them who they were. Fingula answered and said : "We are thy
own children, ruined by thy wife, sister of our own mother, through her
ill mind and her jealousy." "For how long is the spell to be upon you?"
said Lir. "None can relieve us till the woman from the south and the man
from the north come together, till Lairgnen of Connaught wed Deoch of
Munster."

Then Lir and his people raised their shouts of grief, crying, and
lamentation, and they stayed by the shore of the lake listening to the
wild music of the swans until the swans flew away, and King Lir went on
to the Hall of Dearg the king. He told Dearg the king what Oifa had done
to his children. And Dearg put his power upon Oifa and bade her say what
shape on earth she would think the worst of all. She said it would be in
the form of an air-demon. "It is into that form I shall put you," said
Dearg the king, and he struck her with a Druid's wand of spells and
wizardry and put her into the form of an air-demon. And she flew away at
once, and she is still an air-demon, and shall be so for ever.

But the children of Lir continued to delight the Milesian clans with the
very sweet fairy music of their songs, so that no delight was ever heard
in Erin to compare with their music until the time came appointed for
the leaving the Lake of the Red Eye.

Then Fingula sang this parting lay

"Farewell to thee, Dearg the king,  
Master of all Druids lore  
Farewell to thee, our father dear,  
Lir of the Hill of the White Field

"We go to pass the appointed time  
Away and apart from the haunts of men  
In the current of the Moyle,  
Our garb shall be bitter and briny,

"Until Deoch come to Lairgnen.  
So come, ye brothers of once ruddy cheeks  
Let us depart from this Lake of the Red Eye,  
Let us separate in sorrow from the tribe that has loved us."

And after they took to flight, flying highly, lightly, aerially till
they reached the Moyle, between Erin and Albain.

The men of Erin were grieved at their leaving, and it was proclaimed
throughout Erin that henceforth no swan should be killed. Then they
stayed all solitary, all alone, filled with cold and grief and regret,
until a thick tempest came upon them and Fingula said: "Brothers, let us
appoint a place to meet again if the power of the winds separate us."
And they said : " Let us appoint to meet, O sister, at the Rock of the
Seals." Then the waves rose up and the thunder roared, the lightning's
flashed, the sweeping tempest passed over the sea, so that the children
of Lir were scattered from each other over the great sea. There came,
however, a placid calm after the great tempest and Fingula found herself
alone, and she said this lay:

"Woe upon me that I am alive  
My wings are frozen to my sides.  
O beloved three, O beloved three,  
Who hid under the shelter of my feathers,  
Until the dead come back to the living  
I and the three shall never meet again ! "

And she flew to the Lake of the Seals and soon saw Conn coming towards
her with heavy step and drenched feathers, and Fiachra also, cold and
wet and faint, and no word could they tell, so cold and faint were they:
but she nestled them under her wings and said: "If Aod could come to us
now our happiness would be complete" But soon they saw Aod coming
towards them with dry head and preened feathers : Fingula put him under
the feathers of her breast, and Fiachra under her right wing, and Conn
under her left: and they made this lay:

"Bad was our stepmother with us,  
She played her magic on us,  
Sending us north on the sea  
In the shapes of magical swans.  
  
"Our bath upon the shore's ridge  
Is the foam of the brine-crested tide,  
Our share of the ale feast  
Is the brine of the blue-crested sea."

One day they saw a splendid cavalcade of pure white steeds coming
towards them, and when they came near they were the two sons of Dearg
the king who had been seeking for them to give them news of Dearg the
king and Lir their father. "They are well," they said, "and live
together happy in all except that ye are not with them, and for not
knowing where ye have gone since the day ye left the Lake of the Red
Eye." "Happy are not we," said Fingula, and she sang this song:

"Happy this night the household of Lir,  
Abundant their meat and their wine.  
But the children of Lir - what is their lot?  
For bed-clothes we have our feathers,  
And as for our food and our wine -  
The white sand and the bitter brine,  
Fiachra's bed and Conn's place  
Under the cover of my wings on the Moyle,  
Aod has the shelter of my breast,  
And so side by side we rest."

So the sons of Dearg the king came to the Hall of Lir and told the king
the condition of his children.

Then the time came for the children of Lir to fulfil their lot, and they
flew in the current of the Moyle to the Bay of Erris, and remained there
till the time of their fate, and then they flew to the Hill of the White
Field and found all desolate and empty, with nothing but unroofed green
raths and forests of nettles-no house, no fire, no dwelling-place. The
four came close together, and they raised three shouts of lamentation
aloud, and Fingula sang this lay:

Uchone ! it is bitterness to my heart  
To see my father's place forlorn -  
No hounds, no packs of dogs,  
No women, and no valiant kings

"No drinking-horns, no cups of wood,  
No drinking in its lightsome halls.  
Uchone ! I see the state of this house  
That its lord our father lives no more.

"Much have we suffered in our wandering years,  
By winds buffeted, by cold frozen;  
Now has come the greatest of our pain -  
There lives no man who knoweth us in the house where we were born."

So the children of Lir flew away to the Glory Isle of Brandan the saint,
and they settled upon the Lake of the Birds until the holy Patrick came
to Erin and the holy Mac Howg came to Glory Isle.

And the first night he came to the island the children of Lir heard the
voice of his bell ringing for matins, so that they started and leaped
about in terror at hearing it; and her brothers left Fingula alone.
"What is it, beloved brothers?" said she. "We know not what faint,
fearful voice it is we have heard." Then Fingula recited this lay:

Listen to the Cleric's bell,  
Poise your wings and raise  
Thanks to God for his coming,  
Be grateful that you hear him,

"He shall free you from pain,  
And bring you from the rocks and stones.  
Ye comely children of Lir  
Listen to the bell of the Cleric."

And Mac Howg came down to the brink of the shore and said to them "Are
ye the children of Lir?" "We are indeed," said they. "Thanks be to God!"
said the saint; "it is for your sakes I have come to this Isle beyond
every other island in Erin. Come ye to land now and put your trust in
me." So they came to land, and he made for them chains of bright white
silver, and put a chain between Aod and Fingula and a chain between Conn
and Fiachra.

It happened at this time that Lairgnen was prince of Connaught and he
was to wed Deoch the daughter of the king of Munster. She had heard the
account of the birds and she became filled with love and affection for
them, and she said she would not wed till she had the wondrous birds of
Glory Isle. Lairgnen sent for them to the Saint Mac Howg. But the Saint
would not give them, and both Lairguen and Deoch went to Glory Isle. And
Lairgnen went to seize the birds from the altar: but as soon as he had
laid hands on them their feathery coats fell off, and the three sons of
Lir became three withered bony old men, and Fingula, a lean withered old
woman without blood or flesh. Lairguen started at this and left the
place hastily, but Fingula chanted this lay:

Come and baptise us, O Cleric,  
Clear away our stains  
This day I see our grave -  
Fiachra and Conn on each side,  
And in my lap, between my two arms,  
Place Aod, my beauteous brother."

After this lay, the children of Lir were baptised. And they died, and
were buried as Fingula had said, Fiachra and Conn on either side, and
Aod before her face. A cairn was raised for them, and on it their names
were written in runes. And that is the fate of the children of Lir.
