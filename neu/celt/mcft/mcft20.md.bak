# The Tail

THERE was a shepherd once who went out to the hill to look after his
sheep. It was misty and cold, and he had much trouble to find them. At
last he had them all but one ; and after much searching he found that
one too in a peat hag, half drowned; so he took off his plaid, and bent
down and took hold of the sheep's tail, and he pulled ! The sheep was
heavy with water, and he could not lift her, so he took off his coat and
he *pulled !!* but it was too much for him, so he spit on his hands, and
took a good hold of the tail and he PULLED ! ! and the tail broke! and
if it had not been for that this tale would have been a great deal
longer.
