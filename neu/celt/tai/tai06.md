> NO TWO JOURNEYS to these islands are alike. This morning I sailed with
> the steamer a little after five o'clock in a cold night air, with the
> stars shining on the bay. A number of Claddagh fishermen had been out
> all night fishing not far from the harbour, and without thinking, or
> perhaps caring to think, of the steamer, they had put out their nets
> in the channel where she was to pass. Just before we started the mate
> sounded the steam whistle repeatedly to give them warning, saying as
> he did so--'If you were out now in the bay, gentlemen, you'd hear some
> fine prayers being said.'

> When we had gone a little way we began to see the light from the turf
> fires carried by the fishermen flickering on the water, and to hear a
> faint noise of angry voices. Then the outline of a large fishing-boat
> came in sight through the darkness, with the forms of three men who
> stood on the course. The captain feared to turn aside, as there are
> sandbanks near the channel, so the engines were stopped and we glided
> over the nets without doing them harm. As we passed close to the boat
> the crew could be seen plainly on the deck, one of them holding the
> bucket of red turf, and their abuse could be distinctly heard. It
> changed continually, from profuse Gaelic maledictions to the simpler
> curses they know in English. As they spoke they could be seen writhing
> and twisting themselves with passion against the light which was
> beginning to turn on the ripple of the sea. Soon afterwards another
> set of voices began in front of us, breaking out in strange contrast
> with the dwindling stars and the silence of the dawn.

> Further on we passed many boats that let us go by without a word, as
> their nets were not in the channel. Then day came on rapidly with cold
> showers that turned golden in the first rays from the sun, filling the
> troughs of the sea with curious transparencies and light.

>  

>  

> This year I have brought my fiddle with me so that I may have
> something new to keep up the interest of the people. I have played for
> them several tunes, but as far as I can judge they do not feel modern
> music, though they listen eagerly from curiosity. Irish airs like
> 'Eileen Aroon' please them better, but it is only when I play some jig
> like the 'Black Rogue'--which is known on the island--that they seem
> to respond to the full meaning of the notes. Last night I played for a
> large crowd, which had come together for another purpose from all
> parts of the island.

> About six o'clock I was going into the schoolmaster's house, and I
> heard a fierce wrangle going on between a man and a woman near the
> cottages to the west, that lie below the road. While I was listening
> to them several women came down to listen also from behind the wall,
> and told me that the people who were fighting were near relations who
> lived side by side and often quarrelled about trifles, though they
> were as good friends as ever the next day. The voices sounded so
> enraged that I thought mischief would come of it, but the women
> laughed at the idea. Then a lull came, and I said that they seemed to
> have finished at last.

> 'Finished!' said one of the women; 'sure they haven't rightly begun.
> It's only playing they are yet.'

> It was just after sunset and the evening was bitterly cold, so I went
> into the house and left them.

> An hour later the old man came down from my cottage to say that some
> of the lads and the 'fear lionta' ('the man of the nets'--a young man
> from Aranmor who is teaching net-mending to the boys) were up at the
> house, and had sent him down to tell me they would like to dance, if I
> would come up and play for them.

> I went out at once, and as soon as I came into the air I heard the
> dispute going on still to the west more violently than ever. The news
> of it had gone about the island, and little bands of girls and boys
> were running along the lanes towards the scene of the quarrel as
> eagerly as if they were going to a racecourse. I stopped for a few
> minutes at the door of our cottage to listen to the volume of abuse
> that was rising across the stillness of the island. Then I went into
> the kitchen and began tuning the fiddle, as the boys were impatient
> for my music. At first I tried to play standing, but on the upward
> stroke my bow came in contact with the salt-fish and oil-skins that
> hung from the rafters, so I settled myself at last on a table in the
> corner, where I was out of the way, and got one of the people to hold
> up my music before me, as I had no stand. I played a French melody
> first, to get myself used to the people and the qualities of the room,
> which has little resonance between the earth floor and the thatch
> overhead. Then I struck up the 'Black Rogue,' and in a moment a tall
> man bounded out from his stool under the chimney and began flying
> round the kitchen with peculiarly sure and graceful bravado.

> The lightness of the pampooties seems to make the dancing on this
> island lighter and swifter than anything I have seen on the mainland,
> and the simplicity of the men enables them to throw a naïve
> extravagance into their steps that is impossible in places where the
> people are self-conscious.

> The speed, however, was so violent that I had some difficulty in
> keeping up, as my fingers were not in practice, and I could not take
> off more than a small part of my attention to watch what was going on.
> When I finished I heard a commotion at the door, and the whole body of
> people who had gone down to watch the quarrel filed into the kitchen
> and arranged themselves around the walls, the women and girls, as is
> usual, forming themselves in one compact mass crouching on their heels
> near the door.

> I struck up another dance--'Paddy get up'--and the 'fear lionta' and
> the first dancer went through it together, with additional rapidity
> and grace, as they were excited by the presence of the people who had
> come in. Then word went round that an old man, known as Little Roger,
> was outside, and they told me he was once the best dancer on the
> island.

> For a long time he refused to come in, for he said he was too old to
> dance, but at last he was persuaded, and the people brought him in and
> gave him a stool opposite me. It was some time longer before he would
> take his turn, and when he did so, though he was met with great
> clapping of hands, he only danced for a few moments. He did not know
> the dances in my book, he said, and did not care to dance to music he
> was not familiar with. When the people pressed him again he looked
> across to me.

> 'John,' he said, in shaking English, 'have you got "Larry Grogan," for
> it is an agreeable air?'

> I had not, so some of the young men danced again to the 'Black Rogue,'
> and then the party broke up. The altercation was still going on at the
> cottage below us, and the people were anxious to see what was coming
> of it.

> About ten o'clock a young man came in and told us that the fight was
> over.

> 'They have been at it for four hours,' he said, 'and now they're
> tired.

> Indeed it is time they were, for you'd rather be listening to a man
> killing a pig than to the noise they were letting out of them.'

> After the dancing and excitement we were too stirred up to be sleepy,
> so we sat for a long time round the embers of the turf, talking and
> smoking by the light of the candle.

> From ordinary music we came to talk of the music of the fairies, and
> they told me this story, when I had told them some stories of my
> own:--

> A man who lives in the other end of the village got his gun one day
> and went out to look for rabbits in a thicket near the small Dun. He
> saw a rabbit sitting up under a tree, and he lifted his gun to take
> aim at it, but just as he had it covered he heard a kind of music over
> his head, and he looked up into the sky. When he looked back for the
> rabbit, not a bit of it was to be seen.

> He went on after that, and he heard the music again.

> Then he looked over a wall, and he saw a rabbit sitting up by the wall
> with a sort of flute in its mouth, and it playing on it with its two
> fingers!

>  

>  

> 'What sort of rabbit was that?' said the old woman when they had
> finished. 'How could that be a right rabbit? I remember old Pat Dirane
> used to be telling us he was once out on the cliffs, and he saw a big
> rabbit sitting down in a hole under a flagstone. He called a man who
> was with him, and they put a hook on the end of a stick and ran it
> down into the hole. Then a voice called up to them--

> "Ah, Phaddrick, don't hurt me with the hook!"

> 'Pat was a great rogue,' said the old man. 'Maybe you remember the
> bits of horns he had like handles on the end of his sticks? Well, one
> day there was a priest over and he said to Pat--"Is it the devil's
> horns you have on your sticks, Pat?" "I don't rightly know" said Pat,
> "but if it is, it's the devil's milk you've been drinking, since
> you've been able to drink, and the devil's flesh you've been eating
> and the devil's butter you've been putting on your bread, for I've
> seen the like of them horns on every old cow through the country." '

>  

>   
>    
> The weather has been rough, but early this afternoon the sea was calm
> enough for a hooker to come in with turf from Connemara, though while
> she was at the pier the roll was so great that the men had to keep a
> watch on the waves and loosen the cable whenever a large one was
> coming in, so that she might ease up with the water.

> There were only two men on board, and when she was empty they had some
> trouble in dragging in the cables, hoisting the sails, and getting out
> of the harbour before they could be blown on the rocks.

> A heavy shower came on soon afterwards, and I lay down under a stack
> of turf with some people who were standing about, to wait for another
> hooker that was coming in with horses. They began talking and laughing
> about the dispute last night and the noise made at it.

> 'The worst fights do be made here over nothing,' said an old man next
> me. 'Did Mourteen or any of them on the big island ever tell you of
> the fight they had there threescore years ago when they were killing
> each other with knives out on the strand?'

> 'They never told me,' I said.

> 'Well,' said he, 'they were going down to cut weed, and a man was
> sharpening his knife on a stone before he went. A young boy came into
> the kitchen, and he said to the man--"What are you sharpening that
> knife for?"

> "To kill your father with," said the man, and they the best of friends
> all the time. The young boy went back to his house and told his father
> there was a man sharpening a knife to kill him.

> "Bedad," said the father, "if he has a knife I'll have one, too."

> 'He sharpened his knife after that, and they went down to the strand.
> Then the two men began making fun about their knives, and from that
> they began raising their voices, and it wasn't long before there were
> ten men fighting with their knives, and they never stopped till there
> were five of them dead.

> 'They buried them the day after, and when they were coming home, what
> did they see but the boy who began the work playing about with the son
> of the other man, and their two fathers down in their graves.'

> When he stopped, a gust of wind came and blew up a bundle of dry
> seaweed that was near us, right over our heads.

> Another old man began to talk.

> 'That was a great wind,' he said. 'I remember one time there was a man
> in the south island who had a lot of wool up in shelter against the
> corner of a wall. He was after washing it, and drying it, and turning
> it, and he had it all nice and clean the way they could card it. Then
> a wind came down and the wool began blowing all over the wall. The man
> was throwing out his arms on it and trying to stop it, and another man
> saw him.

> "The devil mend your head!" says he, "the like of that wind is too
> strong for you."

> "If the devil himself is in it," said the other man, "I'll hold on to
> it while I can."

> 'Then whether it was because of the word or not I don't know, but the
> whole of the wool went up over his head and blew all over the island,
> yet, when his wife came to spin afterwards she had all they expected,
> as if that lot was not lost on them at all.'

> 'There was more than that in it,' said another man, 'for the night
> before a woman had a great sight out to the west in this island, and
> saw all the people that were dead a while back in this island and the
> south island, and they all talking with each other. There was a man
> over from the other island that night, and he heard the woman talking
> of what she had seen. The next day he went back to the south island,
> and I think he was alone in the curagh. As soon as he came near the
> other island he saw a man fishing from the cliffs, and this man called
> out to him--"Make haste now and go up and tell your mother to hide the
> poteen"--his mother used to sell poteen--"for I'm after seeing the
> biggest party of peelers and yeomanry passing by on the rocks was ever
> seen on the island." It was at that time the wool was taken with the
> other man above, under the hill, and no peelers in the island at all.'

> A little after that the old men went away, and I was left with some
> young men between twenty and thirty, who talked to me of different
> things. One of them asked me if ever I was drunk, and another told me
> I would be right to marry a girl out of this island, for they were
> nice women in it, fine fat girls, who would be strong, and have plenty
> of children, and not be wasting my money on me.

> When the horses were coming ashore a curagh that was far out after
> lobster-pots came hurrying in, and a man out of her ran up the
> sandhills to meet a little girl who was coming down with a bundle of
> Sunday clothes. He changed them on the sand and then went out to the
> hooker, and went off to Connemara to bring back his horses.

> A young married woman I used often to talk with is dying of a
> fever--typhus I am told--and her husband and brothers have gone off in
> a curagh to get the doctor and the priest from the north island,
> though the sea is rough.

> I watched them from the Dun for a long time after they had started.
> Wind and rain were driving through the sound, and I could see no boats
> or people anywhere except this one black curagh splashing and
> struggling through the waves. When the wind fell a little I could hear
> people hammering below me to the east. The body of a young man who was
> drowned a few weeks ago came ashore this morning, and his friends have
> been busy all day making a coffin in the yard of the house where he
> lived.

> After a while the curagh went out of sight into the mist, and I came
> down to the cottage shuddering with cold and misery.

> The old woman was keening by the fire.

> 'I have been to the house where the young man is,' she said, 'but I
> couldn't go to the door with the air was coming out of it. They say
> his head isn't on him at all, and indeed it isn't any wonder and he
> three weeks in the sea. Isn't it great danger and sorrow is over every
> one on this island?"

> I asked her if the curagh would soon be coming back with the priest.
> 'It will not be coming soon or at all to-night,' she said. 'The wind
> has gone up now, and there will come no curagh to this island for
> maybe two days or three. And wasn't it a cruel thing to see the haste
> was on them, and they in danger all the time to be drowned
> themselves?'

> Then I asked her how the woman was doing.

> 'She's nearly lost,' said the old woman; 'she won't be alive at all
> tomorrow morning. They have no boards to make her a coffin, and
> they'll want to borrow the boards that a man below has had this two
> years to bury his mother, and she alive still. I heard them saying
> there are two more women with the fever, and a child that's not three.
> The Lord have mercy on us all!'

> I went out again to look over the sea, but night had fallen and the
> hurricane was howling over the Dun. I walked down the lane and heard
> the keening in the house where the young man was. Further on I could
> see a stir about the door of the cottage that had been last struck by
> typhus. Then I turned back again in the teeth of the rain, and sat
> over the fire with the old man and woman talking of the sorrows of the
> people till it was late in the night.

>  

>  

> This evening the old man told me a story he had heard long ago on the
> mainland:--

> There was a young woman, he said, and she had a child. In a little
> time the woman died and they buried her the day after. That night
> another woman--a woman of the family--was sitting by the fire with the
> child on her lap, giving milk to it out of a cup. Then the woman they
> were after burying opened the door, and came into the house. She went
> over to the fire, and she took a stool and sat down before the other
> woman. Then she put out her hand and took the child on her lap, and
> gave it her breast. After that she put the child in the cradle and
> went over to the dresser and took milk and potatoes off it, and ate
> them. Then she went out. The other woman was frightened, and she told
> the man of the house when he came back, and two young men. They said
> they would be there the next night, and if she came back they would
> catch hold of her. She came the next night and gave the child her
> breast, and when she got up to go to the dresser, the man of the house
> caught hold of her, but he fell down on the floor. Then the two young
> men caught hold of her and they held her. She told them she was away
> with the fairies, and they could not keep her that night, though she
> was eating no food with the fairies, the way she might be able to come
> back to her child. Then she told them they would all be leaving that
> part of the country on the Oidhche Shamhna, and that there would be
> four or five hundred of them riding on horses, and herself would be on
> a grey horse, riding behind a young man. And she told them to go down
> to a bridge they would be crossing that night, and to wait at the head
> of it, and when she would be coming up she would slow the horse and
> they would be able to throw something on her and on the young man, and
> they would fall over on the ground and be saved.

> She went away then, and on the Oidhche Shamhna the men went down and
> got her back. She had four children after that, and in the end she
> died.

> It was not herself they buried at all the first time, but some old
> thing the fairies put in her place.

>  

>  

> 'There are people who say they don't believe in these things,' said
> the old woman, 'but there are strange things, let them say what they
> will. There was a woman went to bed at the lower village a while ago,
> and her child along with her. For a time they did not sleep, and then
> something came to the window, and they heard a voice and this is what
> it said--

> "It is time to sleep from this out."

> 'In the morning the child was dead, and indeed it is many get their
> death that way on the island.'

>  

>  

> The young man has been buried, and his funeral was one of the
> strangest scenes I have met with. People could be seen going down to
> his house from early in the day, yet when I went there with the old
> man about the middle of the afternoon, the coffin was still lying in
> front of the door, with the men and women of the family standing round
> beating it, and keening over it, in a great crowd of people. A little
> later every one knelt down and a last prayer was said. Then the
> cousins of the dead man got ready two oars and some pieces of
> rope--the men of his own family seemed too broken with grief to know
> what they were doing--the coffin was tied up, and the procession
> began. The old woman walked close behind the coffin, and I happened to
> take a place just after them, among the first of the men. The rough
> lane to the graveyard slopes away towards the east, and the crowd of
> women going down before me in their red dresses, cloaked with red
> pethcoats, with the waistband that is held round the head just seen
> from behind, had a strange effect, to which the white coffin and the
> unity of colour gave a nearly cloistral quietness.

> This time the graveyard was filled with withered grass and bracken
> instead of the early ferns that were to be seen everywhere at the
> other funeral I have spoken of, and the grief of the people was of a
> different kind, as they had come to bury a young man who had died in
> his first manhood, instead of an old woman of eighty. For this reason
> the keen lost a part of its formal nature, and was recited as the
> expression of intense personal grief by the young men and women of the
> man's own family.

> When the coffin had been laid down, near the grave that was to be
> opened, two long switches were cut out from the brambles among the
> rocks, and the length and breadth of the coffin were marked on them.
> Then the men began their work, clearing off stones and thin layers of
> earth, and breaking up an old coffin that was in the place into which
> the new one had to be lowered. When a number of blackened boards and
> pieces of bone had been thrown up with the clay, a skull was lifted
> out, and placed upon a gravestone. Immediately the old woman, the
> mother of the dead man, took it up in her hands, and carried it away
> by herself. Then she sat down and put it in her lap--it was the skull
> of her own mother--and began keening and shrieking over it with the
> wildest lamentation.

> As the pile of mouldering clay got higher beside the grave a heavy
> smell began to rise from it, and the men hurried with their work,
> measuring the hole repeatedly with the two rods of bramble. When it
> was nearly deep enough the old woman got up and came back to the
> coffin, and began to beat on it, holding the skull in her left hand.
> This last moment of grief was the most terrible of all. The young
> women were nearly lying among the stones, worn out with their passion
> of grief, yet raising themselves every few moments to beat with
> magnificent gestures on the boards of the coffin. The young men were
> worn out also, and their voices cracked continually in the wail of the
> keen.

> When everything was ready the sheet was unpinned from the coffin, and
> it was lowered into its place. Then an old man took a wooden vessel
> with holy water in it, and a wisp of bracken, and the people crowded
> round him while he splashed the water over them. They seemed eager to
> get as much of it as possible, more than one old woman crying out with
> a humorous voice--

> 'Tabhair dham braon eile, a Mhourteen.' ('Give me another drop,
> Martin.')

> When the grave was half filled in, I wandered round towards the north
> watching two seals that were chasing each other near the surf. I
> reached the Sandy Head as the light began to fail, and found some of
> the men I knew best fishing there with a sort of dragnet. It is a
> tedious process, and I sat for a long time on the sand watching the
> net being put out, and then drawn in again by eight men working
> together with a slow rhythmical movement.

> As they talked to me and gave me a little poteen and a little bread
> when they thought I was hungry, I could not help feeling that I was
> talking with men who were under a judgment of death. I knew that every
> one of them would be drowned in the sea in a few years and battered
> naked on the rocks, or would die in his own cottage and be buried with
> another fearful scene in the graveyard I had come from.

>  

>  

> When I got up this morning I found that the people had gone to Mass
> and latched the kitchen door from the outside, so that I could not
> open it to give myself light.

> I sat for nearly an hour beside the fire with a curious feeling that I
> should be quite alone in this little cottage. I am so used to sitting
> here with the people that I have never felt the room before as a place
> where any man might live and work by himself. After a while as I
> waited, with just light enough from the chimney to let me see the
> rafters and the greyness of the walls, I became indescribably
> mournful, for I felt that this little corner on the face of the world,
> and the people who live in it, have a peace and dignity from which we
> are shut for ever.

> While I was dreaming, the old woman came in in a great hurry and made
> tea for me and the young priest, who followed her a little later
> drenched with rain and spray.

> The curate who has charge of the middle and south islands has a
> wearisome and dangerous task. He comes to this island or Inishere on
> Saturday night--whenever the sea is calm enough--and has Mass the
> first thing on Sunday morning. Then he goes down fasting and is rowed
> across to the other island and has Mass again, so that it is about
> midday when he gets a hurried breakfast before he sets off again for
> Aranmore, meeting often on both passages a rough and perilous sea.

> A couple of Sundays ago I was lying outside the cottage in the
> sunshine smoking my pipe, when the curate, a man of the greatest
> kindliness and humour, came up, wet and worn out, to have his first
> meal. He looked at me for a moment and then shook his head.

> 'Tell me,' he said, 'did you read your Bible this morning?'

> I answered that I had not done so.

> 'Well, begod, Mr. Synge,' he went on, 'if you ever go to Heaven,
> you'll have a great laugh at us.'

>  

>  

> Although these people are kindly towards each other and to their
> children, they have no feeling for the sufferings of animals, and
> little sympathy for pain when the person who feels it is not in
> danger. I have sometimes seen a girl writhing and howling with
> toothache while her mother sat at the other side of the fireplace
> pointing at her and laughing at her as if amused by the sight.

> A few days ago, when we had been talking of the death of President
> McKinley, I explained the American way of killing murderers, and a man
> asked me how long the man who killed the President would be dying.

> 'While you'd be snapping your fingers,' I said.

> 'Well,' said the man, 'they might as well hang him so, and not be
> bothering themselves with all them wires. A man who would kill a King
> or a President knows he has to die for it, and it's only giving him
> the thing he bargained for if he dies easy. It would be right he
> should be three weeks dying, and there'd be fewer of those things done
> in the world.'

> If two dogs fight at the slip when we are waiting for the steamer, the
> men are delighted and do all they can to keep up the fury of the
> battle.

> They tie down donkeys' heads to their hoofs to keep them from
> straying, in a way that must cause horrible pain, and sometimes when I
> go into a cottage I find all the women of the place down on their
> knees plucking the feathers from live ducks and geese.

> When the people are in pain themselves they make no attempt to hide or
> control their feelings. An old man who was ill in the winter took me
> out the other day to show me how far down the road they could hear him
> yelling 'the time he had a pain in his head.'

>  

>  

> There was a great storm this morning, and I went up on the cliff to
> sit in the shanty they have made there for the men who watch for
> wrack. Soon afterwards a boy, who was out minding sheep, came up from
> the west, and we had a long talk.

> He began by giving me the first connected account I have had of the
> accident that happened some time ago, when the young man was drowned
> on his way to the south island.

> 'Some men from the south island,' he said, 'came over and bought some
> horses on this island, and they put them in a hooker to take across.
> They wanted a curagh to go with them to tow the horses on to the
> strand, and a young man said he would go, and they could give him a
> rope and tow him behind the hooker. When they were out in the sound a
> wind came down on them, and the man in the curagh couldn't turn her to
> meet the waves, because the hooker was pulling her and she began
> filling up with water.

> 'When the men in the hooker saw it they began crying out one thing and
> another thing without knowing what to do. One man called out to the
> man who was holding the rope: "Let go the rope now, or you'll swamp
> her."

> 'And the man with the rope threw it out on the water, and the curagh
> half-filled already, and I think only one oar in her. A wave came into
> her then, and she went down before them, and the young man began
> swimming about; then they let fall the sails in the hooker the way
> they could pick him up. And when they had them down they were too far
> off, and they pulled the sails up again the way they could tack back
> to him. He was there in the water swimming round, and swimming round,
> and before they got up with him again he sank the third time, and they
> didn't see any more of him.'

> I asked if anyone had seen him on the island since he was dead.

> 'They have not,' he said, 'but there were queer things in it. Before
> he went out on the sea that day his dog came up and sat beside him on
> the rocks, and began crying. When the horses were coming down to the
> slip an old woman saw her son, that was drowned a while ago, riding on
> one of them, She didn't say what she was after seeing, and this man
> caught the horse, he caught his own horse first, and then he caught

> 'Are you always afraid when you hear a dog crying?' I said.

> 'We don't like it,' he answered; 'you will often see them on the top

> (leather boots) on him and a new suit. Then two men saw him in another
> place.

> 'Do you see that straight wall of cliff?' he went on a few minutes
> later, pointing to a place below us. 'It is there the fairies do be

> There was a man of the name of Charley Lambert, and every horse he
> would ride in a race he would come in the first.

> The people in the country were angry with him at last, and this law
> was made, that he should ride no more at races, and if he rode, any
> one who saw him would have the right to shoot him. After that there
> was a gentleman from that part of the country over in England, and he
> was talking one day with the people there, and he said that the horses
> of Ireland were the best horses. The English said it was the English
> horses were the best, and at last they said there should be a race,
> and the English horses would come over and race against the horses of
> Ireland, and the gentleman put all his money on that race.

> Well, when he came back to Ireland he went to Charley Lambert, and
> asked him to ride on his horse. Charley said he would not ride, and
> told the gentleman the danger he'd be in. Then the gentleman told him
> the way he had put all his property on the horse, and at last Charley
> asked where the races were to be, and the hour and the day. The
> gentleman told him.

> 'Let you put a horse with a bridle and saddle on it every seven miles
> along the road from here to the racecourse on that day,' said Lambert,
> 'and I'll be in it.'

> When the gentleman was gone, Charley stripped off his clothes and got
> into his bed. Then he sent for the doctor, and when he heard him
> coming he began throwing about his arms the way the doctor would think
> his pulse was up with the fever.

> The doctor felt his pulse and told him to stay quiet till the next
> day, when he would see him again.

> The next day it was the same thing, and so on till the day of the
> races. That morning Charley had his pulse beating so hard the doctor
> thought bad of him.

> 'I'm going to the races now, Charley,' said he, 'but I'll come in and
> see you again when I'll be coming back in the evening, and let you be
> very careful and quiet till you see me.'

> As soon as he had gone Charley leapt up out of bed and got on his
> horse, and rode seven miles to where the first horse was waiting for
> him. Then he rode that horse seven miles, and another horse seven
> miles more, till he came to the racecourse.

> He rode on the gentleman's horse and he won the race.

> There were great crowds looking on, and when they saw him coming in
> they said it was Charley Lambert, or the devil was in it, for there
> was no one else could bring in a horse the way he did, for the leg was
> after being knocked off of the horse and he came in all the same.

> When the race was over, he got up on the horse was waiting for him,
> and away with him for seven miles. Then he rode the other horse seven
> miles, and his own horse seven miles, and when he got home he threw
> off his clothes and lay down on his bed.

> After a while the doctor came back and said it was a great race they
> were after having.

> The next day the people were saying it was Charley Lambert was the man
> who rode the horse. An inquiry was held, and the doctor swore that
> Charley was ill in his bed, and he had seen him before the race and
> after it, so the gentleman saved his fortune.

>  

>  

> After that he told me another story of the same sort about a fairy
> rider, who met a gentleman that was after losing all his fortune but a
> shilling, and begged the shilling of him. The gentleman gave him the
> shilling, and the fairy rider--a little red man--rode a horse for him
> in a race, waving a red handkerchief to him as a signal when he was to
> double the stakes, and made him a rich man.

> Then he gave us an extraordinary English doggerel rhyme which I took
> down, though it seems singularly incoherent when written out at
> length. These rhymes are repeated by the old men as a sort of chant,
> and when a line comes that is more than usually irregular they seem to
> take a real delight in forcing it into the mould of the recitative.
> All the time he was chanting the old man kept up a kind of snakelike
> movement in his body, which seemed to fit the chant and make it part
> of him.

>  

> THE WHITE HORSE

> My horse he is white,  
> Though at first he was bay,  
> And he took great delight  
> In travelling by night  
> And by day.

> His travels were great  
> If I could but half of them tell,  
> He was rode in the garden by Adam,  
> The day that he fell.

> On Babylon plains  
> He ran with speed for the plate,  
> He was hunted next day  
> By Hannibal the great.

> After that he was hunted  
> In the chase of a fox,  
> When Nebuchadnezzar ate grass,  
> In the shape of an ox.

> We are told in the next verses of his going into the ark with Noah, of
> Moses riding him through the Red Sea; then

> He was with king Pharaoh in Egypt  
> When fortune did smile,  
> And he rode him stately along  
> The gay banks of the Nile.

> He was with king Saul and all  
> His troubles went through,  
> He was with king David the day  
> That Goliath he slew.

> For a few verses he is with Juda and Maccabeus the great, with Cyrus,
> and back again to Babylon. Next we find him as the horse that came
> into Troy.

> When ( ) came to Troy with joy,  
> My horse he was found,  
> He crossed over the walls and entered  
> The city I'm told.

> I come on him again, in Spain,  
> And he in full bloom,  
> By Hannibal the great he was rode,  
> And he crossing the Alps into Rome.

> The horse being tall  
> And the Alps very high,  
> His rider did fall  
> And Hannibal the great lost an eye.

> Afterwards he carries young Sipho (Scipio), and then he is ridden by
> Brian when driving the Danes from Ireland, and by St. Ruth when he
> fell at the battle of Aughrim, and by Sarsfield at the siege of
> Limerick.

> He was with king James who sailed  
> To the Irish shore,  
> But at last he got lame,  
> When the Boyne's bloody battle was o'er.

> He was rode by the greatest of men  
> At famed Waterloo,  
> Brave Daniel O'Connell he sat  
> On his back it is true.

> \*\*\*

> Brave Dan's on his back,  
> He's ready once more for the field.  
> He never will stop till the Tories,  
> He'll make them to yield.

>   
> Grotesque as this long rhyme appears, it has, as I said, a sort of

> has great fame in the island. The old man himself is hoping that I

> All the morning I have been digging maidenhair ferns with a boy I met

> a week ago of a pain in his heart.

> 'We wouldn't have chosen to lose our father for all the gold there is

> Then he told me that a brother of his who is a stoker in the Navy had

> Here is one of them, as near the Irish as I am able to make it:--

>   
> RUCARD MOR

> I put the sorrow of destruction on the bad luck,  
> For it would be a pity ever to deny it,  
> It is to me it is stuck,  
> By loneliness my pain, my complaining.

> It is the fairy-host  
> Put me a-wandering  
> And took from me my goods of the world.

> At Mannistir na Ruaidthe  
> It is on me the shameless deed was done:  
> Finn Bheara and his fairy-host  
> Took my little horse on me from under the bag.

> If they left me the skin  
> It would bring me tobacco for three months,  
> But they did not leave anything with me  
> But the old minister in its place.

> Am not I to be pitied?  
> My bond and my note are on her,  
> And the price of her not yet paid,  
> My loneliness, my pain, my complaining.

> The devil a hill or a glen, or highest fort  
> Ever was built in Ireland,  
> Is not searched on me for my mare;  
> And I am still at my complaining.

> I got up in the morning,  
> I put a red spark in my pipe.  
> I went to the Cnoc-Maithe  
> To get satisfaction from them.

> I spoke to them,  
> If it was in them to do a right thing,  
> To get me my little mare,  
> Or I would be changing my wits.

> 'Do you hear, Rucard Mor?  
> It is not here is your mare,  
> She is in Cnoc Bally Brishlawn  
> With the fairy-men these three months.'

> I ran on in my walking,  
> I followed the road straightly,  
> I was in Glenasmoil  
> Before the moon was ended.

> I spoke to the fairy-man,  
> If it was in him to do a right thing,  
> To get me my little mare,  
> Or I would be changing my wits.

> 'Do you hear Rucard Mor?  
> It is not here is your mare,  
> She is in Cnoc Bally Brishlawn  
> With the horseman of the music these three months.'

> I ran off on my walking,  
> I followed the road straightly,  
> I was in Cnoc Bally Brishlawn  
> With the black fall of the night.

> That is a place was a crowd  
> As it was seen by me,  
> All the weavers of the globe,  
> It is there you would have news of them.

> I spoke to the horseman,  
> If it was in him to do the right thing,  
> To get me my little mare,  
> Or I would be changing my wits.

> 'Do you hear, Rucard Mor?  
> It is not here is your mare,  
> She is in Cnoc Cruachan,  
> In the back end of the palace.'

> I ran off on my walking,  
> I followed the road straightly,  
> I made no rest or stop  
> Till I was in face of the palace.

> That is the place was a crowd  
> As it appeared to me,  
> The men and women of the country,  
> And they all making merry.

> Arthur Scoil (?) stood up  
> And began himself giving the lead,  
> It is joyful, light and active,  
> I would have danced the course with them.

> They drew up on their feet  
> And they began to laugh,--  
> 'Look at Rucard Mor,  
> And he looking for his little mare.'

> I spoke to the man,  
> And he ugly and humpy,  
> Unless he would get me my mare  
> I would break a third of his bones.

> 'Do you hear, Rucard Mor?  
> It is not here is your mare,  
> She is in Alvin of Leinster,  
> On a halter with my mother.'

> I ran off on my walking,  
> And I came to Alvin of Leinster.  
> I met the old woman--  
> On my word she was not pleasing.

> I spoke to the old woman,  
> And she broke out in English:  
> 'Get agone, you rascal,  
> I don't like your notions.'

> 'Do you hear, you old woman?  
> Keep away from me with your English,  
> But speak to me with the tongue  
> I hear from every person.'

> 'It is from me you will get word of her,  
> Only you come too late--  
> I made a hunting cap  
> For Conal Cath of her yesterday.'

> I ran off on my walking,  
> Through roads that were cold and dirty.  
> I fell in with the fairy-man,  
> And he lying down in the Ruadthe.

> 'I pity a man without a cow,  
> I pity a man without a sheep,  
> But in the case of a man without a horse  
> It is hard for him to be long in the world.'

> PHELIM AND THE EAGLE

> On my getting up in the morning  
> And I bothered, on a Sunday,  
> I put my brogues on me,  
> And I going to Tierny  
> In the Glen of the Dead People.

> Of the race of the Clan Cleopas, the biggest rogues in the land.  
> That and my seven curses  
> And never a good day to be on you,

> teach us about God and the creation of the world. The people on the
> middle island were the last to keep a hold on the fire-worshipping, or
> whatever it was they had in those days, but in the long run a saint
> got in among them and they began listening to him, though they would
> often say in the evening they believed, and then say the morning after
> that they did not believe. In the end the saint gained them over and
> they began building a church, and the saint had tools that were in use
> with them for working with the stones. When the church was halfway up
> the people held a kind of meeting one night among themselves, when the
> saint was asleep in his bed, to see if they did really believe and no
> mistake in it.

> The leading man got up, and this is what he said: that they should go
> down and throw their tools over the cliff, for if there was such a man
> as God, and if the saint was as well known to Him as he said, then he
> would be as well able to bring up the tools out of the sea as they
> were to throw them in.

> They went then and threw their tools over the cliff.

> When the saint came down to the church in the morning the workmen were
> all sitting on the stones and no work doing.

> 'For what cause are you idle?' asked the saint.

> 'We have no tools,' said the men, and then they told him the story of
> what they had done.

> He kneeled down and prayed God that the tools might come up out of the
> sea, and after that he prayed that no other people might ever be as
> great fools as the people on the middle island, and that God might
> preserve theft dark minds of folly to them fill the end of the world.
> And that is why no man out of that island can tell you a whole story
> without stammering, or bring any work to end without a fault in it.

> I asked him if he had known old Pat Dirane on the middle island, and
> heard the fine stories he used to tell.

> 'No one knew him better than I did,' he said; 'for I do often be in

> 'I took the brush in my hand, and I had him tarred down to his feet

> 'A while ago a curagh went out to a ship from the big island, and

> 'I was to go out fishing tonight,' said the younger as he came in,

> They drank my health and our work began.

> 'Have you heard tell of the poet MacSweeny?' said the same man,
> sitting down near me.

> 'I have,' I said, 'in the town of Galway.'

> 'Well,' he said, 'I'll tell you his piece "The Big Wedding," for it's
> a fine piece and there aren't many that know it. There was a poor
> servant girl out in the country, and she got married to a poor servant
> boy. MacSweeny knew the two of them, and he was away at that time and
> it was a month before he came back. When he came back he went to see
> Peggy O'Hara--that was the name of the girl--and he asked her if they
> had had a great wedding. Peggy said it was only middling, but they
> hadn't forgotten him all the same, and she had a bottle of whisky for
> him in the cupboard. He sat down by the fire and began drinking the
> whisky. When he had a couple of glasses taken and was warm by the
> fire, he began making a song, and this was the song he made about the
> wedding of Peggy O'Hara.'

>

> He had the poem both in English and Irish, but as it has been found
> elsewhere and attributed to another folk-poet, I need not give it.

> We had another round of porter and whisky, and then the old man who
> had MacSweeny's wedding gave us a bit of a drinking song, which the
> scholar took down and I translated with him afterwards:--

> 'This is what the old woman says at the Beulleaca when she sees a man
> without knowledge--'Were you ever at the house of the Still, did you
> ever get a drink from it? Neither wine nor beer is as sweet as it is,
> but it is well I was not burnt when I fell down after a drink of it by
> the fire of Mr. Sloper.

> 'I praise Owen O'Hernon over all the doctors of Ireland, it is he put
> drugs on the water, and it lying on the barley.

> 'If you gave but a drop of it to an old woman who does be walking the
> world with a stick, she would think for a week that it was a fine bed
> was made for her.'

>  

>  

> After that I had to get out my fiddle and play some tunes for them
> while they finished their whisky. A new stock of porter was brought in
> this morning to the little public-house underneath my room, and I
> could hear in the intervals of our talk that a number of men had come
> in to treat some neighbors from the middle island, and were singing
> many songs, some of them in English or of the kind I have given, but
> most of them in Irish.

> A little later when the party broke up downstairs my old men got
> nervous about the fairies--they live some distance away--and set off
> across the sandhills.

> The next day I left with the steamer.
