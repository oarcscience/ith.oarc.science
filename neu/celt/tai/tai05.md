> A LETTER HAS come from Michael while I am in Paris. It is in English.

>  

> MY DEAR FRIEND,--I hope that you are in good health since I have heard
> from you before, its many a time I do think of you since and it was
> not forgetting you I was for the future.

> I was at home in the beginning of March for a fortnight and was very
> bad with the Influence, but I took good care of myself.

> I am getting good wages from the first of this year, and I am afraid I
> won't be able to stand with it, although it is not hard, I am working
> in a saw-mills and getting the money for the wood and keeping an
> account of it.

> I am getting a letter and some news from home two or three times a
> week, and they are all well in health, and your friends in the island
> as well as if I mentioned them.

> Did you see any of my friends in Dublin Mr.--or any of those gentlemen
> or gentlewomen.

> I think I soon try America but not until next year if I am alive.

> I hope we might meet again in good and pleasant health.

> It is now time to come to a conclusion, good-bye and not for ever,
> write soon--I am your friend in Galway.

> Write soon dear friend.

>  

>  

> Another letter in a more rhetorical mood.

>  

> MY DEAR MR. S.,--I am for a long time trying to spare a little time
> for to write a few words to you.

> Hoping that you are still considering good and pleasant health since I
> got a letter from you before.

> I see now that your time is coming round to come to this place to
> learn your native language. There was a great Feis in this island two
> weeks ago, and there was a very large attendance from the South
> island, and not very many from the North.

> Two cousins of my own have been in this house for three weeks or
> beyond it, but now they are gone, and there is a place for you if you
> wish to come, and you can write before you and we'll try and manage
> you as well as we can.

> I am at home now for about two months, for the mill was burnt where I
> was at work. After that I was in Dublin, but I did not get my health
> in that city.--
>
> Mise le mor mheas ort a chara.

>  

>  

> Soon after I received this letter I wrote to Michael to say that I was
> going back to them. This time I chose a day when the steamer went
> direct to the middle island, and as we came up between the two lines
> of curaghs that were waiting outside the slip, I saw Michael, dressed
> once more in his island clothes, rowing in one of them.

> He made no sign of recognition, but as soon as they could get
> alongside he clambered on board and came straight up on the bridge to
> where I was.

> 'Bh-fuil tu go maith?' ('Are you well?') he said. 'Where is your bag?'

> His curagh had got a bad place near the bow of the steamer, so I was
> slung down from a considerable height on top of some sacks of flour
> and my own bag, while the curagh swayed and battered itself against
> the side.

> When we were clear I asked Michael if he had got my letter.

> 'Ah no,' he said, 'not a sight of it, but maybe it will come next
> week.'

> Part of the slip had been washed away during the winter, so we had to
> land to the left of it, among the rocks, taking our turn with the
> other curaghs that were coming in.

> As soon as I was on shore the men crowded round me to bid me welcome,
> asking me as they shook hands if I had travelled far in the winter,
> and seen many wonders, ending, as usual, with the inquiry if there was
> much war at present in the world.

> It gave me a thrill of delight to hear their Gaelic blessings, and to
> see the steamer moving away, leaving me quite alone among them. The
> day was fine with a clear sky, and the sea was glittering beyond the
> limestone. Further off a light haze on the cliffs of the larger
> island, and on the Connaught hills, gave me the illusion that it was
> still summer.

> A little boy was sent off to tell the old woman that I was coming, and
> we followed slowly, talking and carrying the baggage.

> When I had exhausted my news they told me theirs. A power of
> strangers--four or five--a French priest among them, had been on the
> island in the summer; the potatoes were bad, but the rye had begun
> well, till a dry week came and then it had turned into oats.

> 'If you didn't know us so well,' said the man who was talking, 'you'd
> think it was a lie we were telling, but the sorrow a lie is in it. It
> grew straight and well till it was high as your knee, then it turned
> into oats. Did ever you see the like of that in County Wicklow?'

> In the cottage everything was as usual, but Michael's presence has
> brought back the old woman's humour and contentment. As I sat down on
> my stool and lit my pipe with the corner of a sod, I could have cried
> out with the feeling of festivity that this return procured me.

>  

>  

> This year Michael is busy in the daytime, but at present there is a
> harvest moon, and we spend most of the evening wandering about the
> island, looking out over the bay where the shadows of the clouds throw
> strange patterns of gold and black. As we were returning through the
> village this evening a tumult of revelry broke out from one of the
> smaller cottages, and Michael said it was the young boys and girls who
> have sport at this time of the year. I would have liked to join them,
> but feared to embarrass their amusement. When we passed on again the
> groups of scattered cottages on each side of the way reminded me of
> places I have sometimes passed when travelling at night in France or
> Bavaria, places that seemed so enshrined in the blue silence of night
> one could not believe they would reawaken.

> Afterwards we went up on the Dun, where Michael said he had never been
> before after nightfall, though he lives within a stone's-throw. The
> place gains unexpected grandeur in this light, standing out like a
> corona of prehistoric stone upon the summit of the island. We walked
> round the top of the wall for some time looking down on the faint
> yellow roofs, with the rocks glittering beyond them, and the silence
> of the bay. Though Michael is sensible of the beauty of the nature
> round him, he never speaks of it directly, and many of our evening
> walks are occupied with long Gaelic discourses about the movements of
> the stars and moon.

>  

>  

> These people make no distinction between the natural and the
> supernatural.

> This afternoon--it was Sunday, when there is usually some interesting
> talk among the islanders--it rained, so I went into the schoolmaster's
> kitchen, which is a good deal frequented by the more advanced among
> the people. I know so little of their ways of fishing and farming that
> I do not find it easy to keep up our talk without reaching matters
> where they cannot follow me, and since the novelty of my photographs
> has passed off I have some difficulty in giving them the entertainment
> they seem to expect from my company. To-day I showed them some simple
> gymnastic feats and conjurer's tricks, which gave them great
> amusement.

> 'Tell us now,' said an old woman when I had finished, 'didn't you
> learn those things from the witches that do be out in the country?'

> In one of the tricks I seemed to join a piece of string which was cut
> by the people, and the illusion was so complete that I saw one man
> going off with it into a corner and pulling at the apparent joining
> till he sank red furrows round his hands.

> Then he brought it back to me.

> 'Bedad,' he said, 'this is the greatest wonder ever I seen. The cord
> is a taste thinner where you joined it but as strong as ever it was.'

> A few of the younger men looked doubtful, but the older people, who
> have watched the rye turning into oats, seemed to accept the magic
> frankly, and did not show any surprise that 'a duine uasal' (a noble
> person) should be able to do like the witches.

> My intercourse with these people has made me realise that miracles
> must abound wherever the new conception of law is not understood. On
> these islands alone miracles enough happen every year to equip a
> divine emissary Rye is turned into oats, storms are raised to keep
> evictors from the shore, cows that are isolated on lonely rocks bring
> forth calves, and other things of the same kind are common.

> The wonder is a rare expected event, like the thunderstorm or the
> rainbow, except that it is a little rarer and a little more wonderful.
> Often, when I am walking and get into conversation with some of the
> people, and tell them that I have received a paper from Dublin, they
> ask me--'And is there any great wonder in the world at this time?'

> When I had finished my feats of dexterity, I was surprised to find
> that none of the islanders, even the youngest and most agile, could do
> what I did. As I pulled their limbs about in my effort to teach them,
> I felt that the ease and beauty of their movements has made me think
> them lighter than they really are. Seen in their curaghs between these
> cliffs and the Atlantic, they appear lithe and small, but if they were
> dressed as we are and seen in an ordinary room, many of them would
> seem heavily and powerfully made.

> One man, however, the champion dancer of the island, got up after a
> while and displayed the salmon leap--lying flat on his face and then
> springing up, horizontally, high in the air--and some other feats of
> extraordinary agility, but he is not young and we could not get him to
> dance.

> In the evening I had to repeat my tricks here in the kitchen, for the
> fame of them had spread over the island.

> No doubt these feats will be remembered here for generations. The
> people have so few images for description that they seize on anything
> that is remarkable in their visitors and use it afterwards in their
> talk.

> For the last few years when they are speaking of any one with fine
> rings they say: 'She had beautiful rings on her fingers like Lady--,'
> a visitor to the island.

>  

>  

> I have been down sitting on the pier till it was quite dark. I am only
> beginning to understand the nights of Inishmaan and the influence they
> have had in giving distinction to these men who do most of their work
> after nightfall.

> I could hear nothing but a few curlews and other wild-fowl whistling
> and shrieking in the seaweed, and the low rustling of the waves. It
> was one of the dark sultry nights peculiar to September, with no light
> anywhere except the phosphorescence of the sea, and an occasional rift
> in the clouds that showed the stars behind them.

> The sense of solitude was immense. I could not see or realise my own
> body, and I seemed to exist merely in my perception of the waves and
> of the crying birds, and of the smell of seaweed.

> When I tried to come home I lost myself among the sandhills, and the
> night seemed to grow unutterably cold and dejected, as I groped among
> slimy masses of seaweed and wet crumbling walls.

> After a while I heard a movement in the sand, and two grey shadows
> appeared beside me. They were two men who were going home from
> fishing. I spoke to them and knew their voices, and we went home
> together.

>  

>  

> In the autumn season the threshing of the rye is one of the many tasks
> that fall to the men and boys. The sheaves are collected on a bare
> rock, and then each is beaten separately on a couple of stones placed
> on end one against the other. The land is so poor that a field hardly
> produces more grain than is needed for seed the following year, so the
> rye-growing is carried on merely for the straw, which is used for
> thatching.

> The stooks are carried to and from the threshing fields, piled on
> donkeys that one meets everywhere at this season, with their black,
> unbridled heads just visible beneath a pinnacle of golden straw.

> While the threshing is going on sons and daughters keep turning up
> with one thing and another till there is a little crowd on the rocks,
> and any one who is passing stops for an hour or two to talk on his way
> to the sea, so that, like the kelp-burning in the summer-time, this
> work is full of sociability.

> When the threshing is over the straw is taken up to the cottages and
> piled up in an outhouse, or more often in a corner of the kitchen,
> where it brings a new liveliness of colour.

> A few days ago when I was visiting a cottage where there are the most
> beautiful children on the island, the eldest daughter, a girl of about
> fourteen, went and sat down on a heap of straw by the doorway. A ray
> of sunlight fell on her and on a portion of the rye, giving her figure
> and red dress with the straw under it a curious relief against the
> nets and oilskins, and forming a natural picture of exquisite harmony
> and colour.

> In our own cottage the thatching--it is done every year--has just been
> carried out. The rope-twisting was done partly in the lane, partly in
> the kitchen when the weather was uncertain. Two men usually sit
> together at this work, one of them hammering the straw with a heavy
> block of wood, the other forming the rope, the main body of which is
> twisted by a boy or girl with a bent stick specially formed for this
> employment.

> In wet weather, when the work must be done indoors, the person who is
> twisting recedes gradually out of the door, across the lane, and
> sometimes across a field or two beyond it. A great length is needed to
> form the close network which is spread over the thatch, as each piece
> measures about fifty yards. When this work is in progress in half the
> cottages of the village, the road has a curious look, and one has to
> pick one's steps through a maze of twisting ropes that pass from the
> dark doorways on either side into the fields.

> When four or five immense balls of rope have been completed, a
> thatching party is arranged, and before dawn some morning they come
> down to the house, and the work is taken in hand with such energy that
> it is usually ended within the day.

> Like all work that is done in common on the island, the thatching is
> regarded as a sort of festival. From the moment a roof is taken in
> hand there is a whirl of laughter and talk till it is ended, and, as
> the man whose house is being covered is a host instead of an employer,
> he lays himself out to please the men who work with him.

> The day our own house was thatched the large table was taken into the
> kitchen from my room, and high teas were given every few hours. Most
> of the people who came along the road turned down into the kitchen for
> a few minutes, and the talking was incessant. Once when I went into
> the window I heard Michael retailing my astronomical lectures from the
> apex of the gable, but usually their topics have to do with the
> affairs of the island.

> It is likely that much of the intelligence and charm of these people
> is due to the absence of any division of labour, and to the
> correspondingly wide development of each individual, whose varied
> knowledge and skill necessitates a considerable activity of mind. Each
> man can speak two languages. He is a skilled fisherman, and can manage
> a curagh with extraordinary nerve and dexterity He can farm simply,
> burn kelp, cut out pampooties, mend nets, build and thatch a house,
> and make a cradle or a coffin. His work changes with the seasons in a
> way that keeps him free from the dullness that comes to people who
> have always the same occupation. The danger of his life on the sea
> gives him the alertness of the primitive hunter, and the long nights
> he spends fishing in his curagh bring him some of the emotions that
> are thought peculiar to men who have lived with the arts.

> As Michael is busy in the daytime, I have got a boy to come up and
> read Irish to me every afternoon. He is about fifteen, and is
> singularly intelligent, with a real sympathy for the language and the
> stories we read.

> One evening when he had been reading to me for two hours, I asked him
> if he was tired.

> 'Tired?' he said, 'sure you wouldn't ever be tired reading!'

> A few years ago this predisposition for intellectual things would have
> made him sit with old people and learn their stories, but now boys
> like him turn to books and to papers in Irish that are sent them from
> Dublin.

> In most of the stories we read, where the English and Irish are
> printed side by side, I see him looking across to the English in
> passages that are a little obscure, though he is indignant if I say
> that he knows English better than Irish. Probably he knows the local
> Irish better than English, and printed English better than printed
> Irish, as the latter has frequent dialectic forms he does not know.

> A few days ago when he was reading a folk-tale from Douglas Hyde's
> *Beside the Fire*, something caught his eye in the translation.

> 'There's a mistake in the English,' he said, after a moment's
> hesitation, 'he's put "gold chair" instead of "golden chair."

> I pointed out that we speak of gold watches and gold pins.

> 'And why wouldn't we?' he said; 'but "golden chair" would be much
> nicer.'

> It is curious to see how his rudimentary culture has given him the
> beginning of a critical spirit that occupies itself with the form of
> language as well as with ideas.

> One day I alluded to my trick of joining string.

> 'You can't join a string, don't be saying it,' he said; 'I don't know
> what way you're after fooling us, but you didn't join that string, not
> a bit of you.'

> Another day when he was with me the fire burned low and I held up a
> newspaper before it to make a draught. It did not answer very well,
> and though the boy said nothing I saw he thought me a fool.

> The next day he ran up in great excitement.

> 'I'm after trying the paper over the fire,' he said, 'and it burned
> grand. Didn't I think, when I seen you doing it there was no good in
> it at all, but I put a paper over the master's (the school-master's)
> fire and it flamed up. Then I pulled back the corner of the paper and
> I ran my head in, and believe me, there was a big cold wind blowing up
> the chimney that would sweep the head from you.'

> We nearly quarrelled because he wanted me to take his photograph in
> his Sunday clothes from Galway, instead of his native homespuns that
> become him far better, though he does not like them as they seem to
> connect him with the primitive life of the island. With his keen
> temperament, he may go far if he can ever step out into the world.

> He is constantly thinking.

> One day he asked me if there was great wonder on their names out in
> the country.

> I said there was no wonder on them at all.

> 'Well,' he said, 'there is great wonder on your name in the island,
> and I was thinking maybe there would be great wonder on our names out
> in the country.'

> In a sense he is right. Though the names here are ordinary enough,
> they are used in a way that differs altogether from the modern system
> of surnames.

> When a child begins to wander about the island, the neighbours speak
> of it by its Christian name, followed by the Christian name of its
> father. If this is not enough to identify it, the father's
> epithet--whether it is a nickname or the name of his own father--is
> added.

> Sometimes when the father's name does not lend itself, the mother's
> Christian name is adopted as epithet for the children.

> An old woman near this cottage is called 'Peggeen,' and her sons are
> 'Patch Pheggeen,' 'Seaghan Pheggeen,' etc.

> Occasionally the surname is employed in its Irish form, but I have not
> heard them using the 'Mac' prefix when speaking Irish among
> themselves; perhaps the idea of a surname which it gives is too modern
> for them, perhaps they do use it at times that I have not noticed.

> Sometimes a man is named from the colour of his hair. There is thus a
> Seaghan Ruadh (Red John), and his children are 'Mourteen Seaghan
> Ruadh,' etc.

> Another man is known as 'an iasgaire' ('the fisher'), and his children
> are 'Maire an iasgaire' ('Mary daughter of the fisher'), and so on.

> The schoolmaster tells me that when he reads out the roll in the
> morning the children repeat the local name all together in a whisper
> after each official name, and then the child answers. If he calls, for
> instance, 'Patrick O'Flaharty,' the children murmur, 'Patch Seaghan
> Dearg' or some such name, and the boy answers.

> People who come to the island are treated in much the same way. A
> French Gaelic student was in the islands recently, and he is always
> spoken of as 'An Saggart Ruadh' ('the red priest') or as 'An Saggart
> Francach' ('the French priest'), but never by his name.

> If an islander's name alone is enough to distinguish him it is used by
> itself, and I know one man who is spoken of as Eamonn. There may be
> other Edmunds on the island, but if so they have probably good
> nicknames or epithets of their own.

> In other countries where the names are in a somewhat similar
> condition, as in modern Greece, the man's calling is usually one of
> the most common means of distinguishing him, but in this place, where
> all have the same calling, this means is not available.

>  

>  

> Late this evening I saw a three-oared curagh with two old women in her
> besides the rowers, landing at the slip through a heavy roll. They
> were coming from Inishere, and they rowed up quickly enough till they
> were within a few yards of the surf-line, where they spun round and
> waited with the prow towards the sea, while wave after wave passed
> underneath them and broke on the remains of the slip. Five minutes
> passed; ten minutes; and still they waited with the oars just paddling
> in the water, and their heads turned over their shoulders.

> I was beginning to think that they would have to give up and row round
> to the lee side of the island, when the curagh seemed suddenly to turn
> into a living thing. The prow was again towards the slip, leaping and
> hurling itself through the spray. Before it touched, the man in the
> bow wheeled round, two white legs came out over the prow like the
> flash of a sword, and before the next wave arrived he had dragged the
> curagh out of danger.

> This sudden and united action in men without discipline shows well the
> education that the waves have given them. When the curagh was in
> safety the two old women were carried up through the surf and slippery
> seaweed on the backs of their sons.

> In this broken weather a curagh cannot go out without danger, yet
> accidents are rare and seem to be nearly always caused by drink, Since
> I was here last year four men have been drowned on their way home from
> the large island. First a curagh belonging to the south island which
> put off with two men in her heavy with drink, came to shore here the
> next evening dry and uninjured, with the sail half set, and no one in
> her.

> More recently a curagh from this island with three men, who were the
> worse for drink, was upset on its way home. The steamer was not far
> off, and saved two of the men, but could not reach the third.

> Now a man has been washed ashore in Donegal with one pampooty on him,
> and a striped shirt with a purse in one of the pockets, and a box for
> tobacco.

> For three days the people have been trying to fix his identity. Some
> think it is the man from this island, others think that the man from
> the south answers the description more exactly. To-night as we were
> returning from the slip we met the mother of the man who was drowned
> from this island, still weeping and looking out over the sea. She
> stopped the people who had come over from the south island to ask them
> with a terrified whisper what is thought over there.

> Later in the evening, when I was sitting in one of the cottages, the
> sister of the dead man came in through the rain with her infant, and
> there was a long talk about the rumours that had come in. She pieced
> together all she could remember about his clothes, and what his purse
> was like, and where he had got it, and the same for his tobacco box,
> and his stockings. In the end there seemed little doubt that it was
> her brother.

> 'Ah!' she said, 'It's Mike sure enough, and please God they'll give
> him a decent burial.'

> Then she began to keen slowly to herself. She had loose yellow hair
> plastered round her head with the rain, and as she sat by the door
> sucking her infant, she seemed like a type of the women's life upon
> the islands.

> For a while the people sat silent, and one could hear nothing but the
> lips of the infant, the rain hissing in the yard, and the breathing of
> four pigs that lay sleeping in one corner. Then one of the men began
> to talk about the new boats that have been sent to the south island,
> and the conversation went back to its usual round of topics.

> The loss of one man seems a slight catastrophe to all except the
> immediate relatives. Often when an accident happens a father is lost
> with his two eldest sons, or in some other way all the active men of a
> household die together.

> A few years ago three men of a family that used to make the wooden
> vessels--like tiny barrels--that are still used among the people, went
> to the big island together. They were drowned on their way home, and
> the art of making these little barrels died with them, at least on
> Inishmaan, though it still lingers in the north and south islands.

> Another catastrophe that took place last winter gave a curious zest to
> the observance of holy days. It seems that it is not the custom for
> the men to go out fishing on the evening of a holy day, but one night
> last December some men, who wished to begin fishing early the next
> morning, rowed out to sleep in their hookers.

> Towards morning a terrible storm rose, and several hookers with their
> crews on board were blown from their moorings and wrecked. The sea was
> so high that no attempt at rescue could be made, and the men were
> drowned.

> 'Ah!' said the man who told me the story, 'I'm thinking it will be a
> long time before men will go out again on a holy day. That storm was
> the only storm that reached into the harbour the whole winter, and I'm
> thinking there was something in it.'

>  

>  

> Today when I went down to the slip I found a pig-jobber from Kilronan
> with about twenty pigs that were to be shipped for the English market.

> When the steamer was getting near, the whole drove was moved down on
> the slip and the curaghs were carried out close to the sea. Then each
> beast was caught in its turn and thrown on its side, while its legs
> were hitched together in a single knot, with a tag of rope remaining,
> by which it could be carried.

> Probably the pain inflicted was not great, yet the animals shut their
> eyes and shrieked with almost human intonations, till the suggestion
> of the noise became so intense that the men and women who were merely
> looking on grew wild with excitement, and the pigs waiting their turn
> foamed at the mouth and tore each other with their teeth.

> After a while there was a pause. The whole slip was covered with a
> mass of sobbing animals, with here and there a terrified woman
> crouching among the bodies, and patting some special favourite to keep
> it quiet while the curaghs were being launched.

> Then the screaming began again while the pigs were carried out and
> laid in their places, with a waistcoat tied round their feet to keep
> them from damaging the canvas. They seemed to know where they were
> going, and looked up at me over the gunnel with an ignoble desperation
> that made me shudder to think that I had eaten of this whimpering
> flesh. When the last curagh went out I was left on the slip with a
> band of women and children, and one old boar who sat looking out over
> the sea.

> The women were over-excited, and when I tried to talk to them they
> crowded round me and began jeering and shrieking at me because I am
> not married. A dozen screamed at a time, and so rapidly that I could
> not understand all that they were saying, yet I was able to make out
> that they were taking advantage of the absence of their husbands to
> give me the full volume of their contempt. Some little boys who were
> listening threw themselves down, writhing with laughter among the
> seaweed, and the young girls grew red with embarrassment and stared
> down into the surf.

> For a moment I was in confusion. I tried to speak to them, but I could
> not make myself heard, so I sat down on the slip and drew out my
> wallet of photographs. In an instant I had the whole band clambering
> round me, in their ordinary mood.

> When the curaghs came back--one of them towing a large kitchen table
> that stood itself up on the waves and then turned somersaults in an
> extraordinary manner--word went round that the ceannuighe (pedlar) was
> arriving.

> He opened his wares on the slip as soon as he landed, and sold a
> quantity of cheap knives and jewellery to the girls and the younger
> women. He spoke no Irish, and the bargaining gave immense amusement to
> the crowd that collected round him.

> I was surprised to notice that several women who professed to know no
> English could make themselves understood without difficulty when it
> pleased them.

> 'The rings is too dear at you, sir,' said one girl using the Gaelic
> construction; 'let you put less money on them and all the girls will
> be buying.'

> After the jewellery' he displayed some cheap religious
> pictures--abominable oleographs--but I did not see many buyers.

> I am told that most of the pedlars who come here are Germans or Poles,
> but I did not have occasion to speak with this man by himself.

>  

>  

> I have come over for a few days to the south island, and, as usual, my
> voyage was not favourable.

> The morning was fine, and seemed to promise one of the peculiarly
> hushed, pellucid days that occur sometimes before rain in early
> winter. From the first gleam of dawn the sky was covered with white
> cloud, and the tranquillity was so complete that every sound seemed to
> float away by itself across the silence of the bay. Lines of blue
> smoke were going up in spirals over the village, and further off heavy
> fragments of rain-cloud were lying on the horizon. We started early in
> the day, and, although the sea looked calm from a distance, we met a
> considerable roll coming from the south-west when we got out from the
> shore.

> A little later the steamer came in sight and lay to in the offing.

> some one stopped him and he began again pouring out a medley of rude

> The mode of reciting ballads in this island is singularly harsh. I

> was fond of songs, and began singing to show what he could do.

> The music was much like what I have heard before on the islands--a
> monotonous chant with pauses on the high and low notes to mark the
> rhythm; but the harsh nasal tone in which he sang was almost
> intolerable. His performance reminded me in general effect of a chant
> I once heard from a party of Orientals I was travelling with in a
> third-class carriage from Paris to Dieppe, but the islander ran his
> voice over a much wider range.

> His pronunciation was lost in the rasping of his throat, and, though
> he shrieked into my ear to make sure that I understood him above the
> howling of the wind, I could only make out that it was an endless
> ballad telling the fortune of a young man who went to sea, and had
> many adventures. The English nautical terms were employed continually
> in describing his life on the ship, but the man seemed to feel that
> they were not in their place, and stopped short when one of them
> occurred to give me a poke with his finger and explain gib, topsail,
> and bowsprit, which were for me the most intelligible features of the
> poem. Again, when the scene changed to Dublin, 'glass of whiskey,'
> 'public-house,' and such things were in English.

> When the shower was over he showed me a curious cave hidden among the
> cliffs, a short distance from the sea. On our way back he asked me the
> three questions I am met with on every side--whether I am a rich man,
> whether I am married, and whether I have ever seen a poorer place than
> these islands.

> When he heard that I was not married he urged me to come back in the
> summer so that he might take me over in a curagh to the Spa in County
> Glare, where there is 'spree mor agus go leor ladies' ('a big spree
> and plenty of ladies').

> Something about the man repelled me while I was with him, and though I
> was cordial and liberal he seemed to feel that I abhorred him. We
> arranged to meet again in the evening, but when I dragged myself with
> an inexplicable loathing to the place of meeting, there was no trace
> of him.

> It is characteristic that this man, who is probably a drunkard and
> shebeener and certainly in penury, refused the chance of a shilling
> because he felt that I did not like him. He had a curiously mixed

> I have come over again to Inishmaan, and this time I had fine weather
> for my passage. The air was full of luminous sunshine from the early

> We had had a good dinner and drink and were wrought up by this sudden

> I told them I was going back to Paris in a few days to sell my books

> When our excitement sobered down, Michael told me that one of the

> A little later in the day we set off, and I nearly laughed to see
> Michael's eagerness that I should turn out a good shot.

> We put the ferret down in a crevice between two bare sheets of rock,
> and waited. In a few minutes we heard rushing paws underneath us, then
> a rabbit shot up straight into the air from the crevice at our feet

> and fired.

> 'Buail tu é,' screamed Michael at my elbow as he ran up the rock. I
> had killed it.

> We shot seven or eight more in the next hour, and Michael was

> who is worse than an apostate.

> The women of this island are before conventionality, and share some of
> the liberal features that are thought peculiar to the women of Paris
> and New York.

> Many of them are too contented and too sturdy to have more than a
> decorative interest, but there are others full of curious
> individuality.

> This year I have got to know a wonderfully humorous girl, who has been
> spinning in the kitchen for the last few days with the old woman's
> spinning-wheel. The morning she began I heard her exquisite intonation
> almost before I awoke, brooding and cooing over every syllable she
> uttered.

> I have heard something similar in the voices of German and Polish
> women, but I do not think men--at least European men--who are always
> further than women from the simple, animal emotions, or any speakers
> who use languages with weak gutturals, like French or English, can
> produce this inarticulate chant in their ordinary talk.

> She plays continual tricks with her Gaelic in the way girls are fond
> of, piling up diminutives and repeating adjectives with a humorous
> scorn of syntax. While she is here the talk never stops in the
> kitchen. To-day she has been asking me many questions about Germany,
> for it seems one of her sisters married a German husband in America
> some years ago, who kept her in great comfort, with a fine 'capull
> glas' ('grey horse') to ride on, and this girl has decided to escape
> in the same way from the drudgery of the island.

> This was my last evening on my stool in the chimney corner, and I had
> a long talk with some neighbours who came in to bid me prosperity, and
> lay about on the floor with their heads on low stools and their feet
> stretched out to the embers of the turf. The old woman was at the
> other side of the fire, and the girl I have spoken of was standing at
> her spinning-wheel, talking and joking with every one. She says when I
> go away now I am to marry a rich wife with plenty of money, and if she
> dies on me I am to come back here and marry herself for my second
> wife.

> I have never heard talk so simple and so attractive as the talk of
> these people. This evening they began disputing about their wives, and
> it appeared that the greatest merit they see in a woman is that she
> should be fruitful and bring them many children. As no money can be
> earned by children on the island this one attitude shows the immense
> difference between these people and the people of Paris.

> The direct sexual instincts are not weak on the island, but they are
> so subordinated to the instincts of the family that they rarely lead
> to irregularity. The life here is still at an almost patriarchal
> stage, and the people are nearly as far from the romantic moods of
> love as they are from the impulsive life of the savage.

> The wind was so high this morning that there was some doubt whether
> the steamer would arrive, and I spent half the day wandering about
> with Michael watching the horizon.

> At last, when we had given her up, she came in sight far away to the
> north, where she had gone to have the wind with her where the sea was
> at its highest.

> I got my baggage from the cottage and set off for the slip with
> Michael and the old man, turning into a cottage here and there to say
> good-bye.

> In spite of the wind outside, the sea at the slip was as calm as a
> pool. The men who were standing about while the steamer was at the
> south island wondered for the last time whether I would be married
> when I came back to see them. Then we pulled out and took our place in
> the line. As the tide was running hard the steamer stopped a certain
> distance from the shore, and gave us a long race for good places at
> her side. In the struggle we did not come off well, so I had to
> clamber across two curaghs, twisting and fumbling with the roll, in
> order to get on board.

> It seemed strange to see the curaghs full of well-known faces turning
> back to the slip without me, but the roll in the sound soon took off
> my attention. Some men were on board whom I had seen on the south
> island, and a good many Kilronan people on their way home from Galway,
> who told me that in one part of their passage in the morning they had
> come in for heavy seas.

> As is usual on Saturday, the steamer had a large cargo of flour and
> porter to discharge at Kilronan, and, as it was nearly four o'clock
> before the tide could float her at the pier, I felt some doubt about
> our passage to Galway.

> The wind increased as the afternoon went on, and when I came down in

> wind howling in the walls. At last he telegraphed to Galway to know if
> he was wanted the next day, and we went into a public-house to wait
> for the reply.

> The kitchen was filled with men sitting closely on long forms ranged
> in lines at each side of the fire. A wild-looking but beautiful girl

> natives of Inishmaan were hanging about the door, miserably drunk. At
> the end of the kitchen the bar was arranged, with a sort of alcove
> beside it, where some older men were playing cards. Overhead there
> were the open rafters, filled with turf and tobacco smoke.

> This is the haunt so much dreaded by the women of the other islands,
> where the men linger with their money till they go out at last with
> reeling steps and are lost in the sound. Without this background of
> empty curaghs, and bodies floating naked with the tide, there would be

> where men sit, evening after evening, drinking bad whisky and porter,
> and talking with endless repetition of fishing, and kelp, and of the
> sorrows of purgatory.

> When we had finished our whiskey word came that the boat might remain.

> With some difficulty I got my bags out of the steamer and carried them
> up through the crowd of women and donkeys that were still struggling
> on the quay in an inconceivable medley of flour-bags and cases of
> petroleum. When I reached the inn the old woman was in great good

> groped my way back to the harbour, where, I was told, the old
> net-mender, who came to see me on my first visit to the islands, was
> spending the night as watchman.

> It was quite dark on the pier, and a terrible gale was blowing. There
> was no one in the little office where I expected to find him, so I
> groped my way further on towards a figure I saw moving with a lantern.

> It was the old man, and he remembered me at once when I hailed him and
> told him who I was. He spent some time arranging one of his lanterns,
> and then he took me back to his office--a mere shed of planks and
> corrugated iron, put up for the contractor of some work which is in
> progress on the pier.

> When we reached the light I saw that his head was rolled up in an
> extraordinary collection of mufflers to keep him from the cold, and
> that his face was much older than when I saw him before, though still
> full of intelligence.

> He began to tell how he had gone to see a relative of mine in Dublin
> when he first left the island as a cabin-boy, between forty and fifty
> years ago.

> He told his story with the usual detail:--

> We saw a man walking about on the quay in Dublin, and looking at us
> without saying a word. Then he came down to the yacht. 'Are you the
> men from Aran?' said he.

> 'We are,' said we.

> 'You're to come with me so,' said he. 'Why?' said we.

> Then he told us it was Mr. Synge had sent him and we went with him.
> Mr. Synge brought us into his kitchen and gave the men a glass of
> whisky all round, and a half-glass to me because I was a boy--though
> at that time and to this day I can drink as much as two men and not be
> the worse of it. We were some time in the kitchen, then one of the men
> said we should be going. I said it would not be right to go without
> saying a word to Mr. Synge. Then the servant-girl went up and brought
> him down, and he gave us another glass of whisky, and he gave me a
> book in Irish because I was going to sea, and I was able to read in
> the Irish.

> I owe it to Mr. Synge and that book that when I came back here, after
> not hearing a word of Irish for thirty years, I had as good Irish, or
> maybe better Irish, than any person on the island.

>

> I could see all through his talk that the sense of superiority which
> his scholarship in this little-known language gave him above the
> ordinary seaman, had influenced his whole personality and been the

> On one voyage he had a fellow-sailor who often boasted that he had

> One night we had a quarrel, and I asked him could he read a Greek book
> with all his talk of it.

> 'I can so,' said he.

> 'We'll see that,' said I.

> Then I got the Irish book out of my chest, and I gave it into his
> hand.

> 'Read that to me,' said I, 'if you know Greek.'

> He took it, and he looked at it this way, and that way, and not a bit
> of him could make it out.

> 'Bedad, I've forgotten my Greek,' said he.

> 'You're telling a lie,' said I. 'I'm not,' said he; 'it's the divil a
> bit I can read it.'

> Then I took the book back into my hand, and said to him--'It's the
> sorra a word of Greek you ever knew in your life, for there's not a
> word of Greek in that book, and not a bit of you knew.'

>  

>  

> He told me another story of the only time he had heard Irish spoken

> One night I was in New York, walking in the streets with some other

> 'What's that jargon?' said one of the men.

> 'It's no jargon,' said I.

> 'What is it?' said he.

> 'It's Irish,' said I.

> Then I went up to them, and you know, sir, there is no language like
> the Irish for soothing and quieting. The moment I spoke to them they
> stopped scratching and swearing and stood there as quiet as two lambs.

> Then they asked me in Irish if I wouldn't come in and have a drink,
> and I said I couldn't leave my mates.

> 'Bring them too,' said they.

> Then we all had a drop together.

>  

>  

> While we were talking another man had slipped in and sat down in the
> corner with his pipe, and the rain had become so heavy we could hardly
> hear our voices over the noise on the iron roof.

> The old man went on telling of his experiences at sea and the places
> he had been to.

> 'If I had my life to live over again,' he said, 'there's no other way
> I'd spend it. I went in and out everywhere and saw everything. I was

> 'There's no diversion at all in cards if you don't play for money'
> said the man in the corner.

> 'There was no use in my playing for money' said the old man, 'for I'd
> always lose, and what's the use in playing if you always lose?'

> Then our conversation branched off to the Irish language and the books
> written in it.

> He began to criticise Archbishop MacHale's version of *Moore's Irish
> Melodies* with great severity and acuteness, citing whole poems both

> 'A translation is no translation,' he said, 'unless it will give you

> From the verses he cited his judgment seemed perfectly justified, and

> In spite of his singular intelligence and minute observation his
> reasoning was medieval.

> I asked him what he thought about the future of the language on these

> 'It can never die out,' said he, 'because there's no family in the

> 'And the Gaelic League?' I asked him.

> 'The Gaelic League! Didn't they come down here with their organisers
