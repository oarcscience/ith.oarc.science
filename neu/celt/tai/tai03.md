> I AM IN Aranmor, sitting over a turf fire, listening to a murmur of
> Gaelic that is rising from a little public-house under my room.

> The steamer which comes to Aran sails according to the tide, and it
> was six o'clock this morning when we left the quay of Galway in a
> dense shroud of mist.

> A low line of shore was visible at first on the right between the
> movement of the waves and fog, but when we came further it was lost
> sight of, and nothing could be seen but the mist curling in the
> rigging, and a small circle of foam.

> There were few passengers; a couple of men going out with young pigs
> tied loosely in sacking, three or four young girls who sat in the
> cabin with their heads completely twisted in their shawls, and a
> builder, on his way to repair the pier at Kilronan, who walked up and
> down and talked with me.

> In about three hours Aran came in sight. A dreary rock appeared at
> first sloping up from the sea into the fog; then, as we drew nearer, a
> coast-guard station and the village.

> A little later I was wandering out along the one good roadway of the
> island, looking over low walls on either side into small flat fields
> of naked rock. I have seen nothing so desolate. Grey floods of water
> were sweeping everywhere upon the limestone, making at limes a wild
> torrent of the road, which twined continually over low hills and
> cavities in the rock or passed between a few small fields of potatoes
> or grass hidden away in corners that had shelter. Whenever the cloud
> lifted I could see the edge of the sea below me on the right, and the
> naked ridge of the island above me on the other side. Occasionally I
> passed a lonely chapel or schoolhouse, or a line of stone pillars with
> crosses above them and inscriptions asking a prayer for the soul of
> the person they commemorated.

> I met few people; but here and there a band of tall girls passed me on
> their way to Kilronan, and called out to me with humorous wonder,
> speaking English with a slight foreign intonation that differed a good
> deal from the brogue of Galway. The rain and cold seemed to have no
> influence on their vitality and as they hurried past me with eager
> laughter and great talking in Gaelic, they left the wet masses of rock
> more desolate than before.

> A little after midday when I was coming back one old half-blind man
> spoke to me in Gaelic, but, in general, I was surprised at the
> abundance and fluency of the foreign tongue.

> In the afternoon the rain continued, so I sat here in the inn looking
> out through the mist at a few men who were unlading hookers that had
> come in with turf from Connemara, and at the long-legged pigs that
> were playing in the surf. As the fishermen came in and out of the
> public-house underneath my room, I could hear through the broken panes
> that a number of them still used the Gaelic, though it seems to be
> falling out of use among the younger people of this village.

> The old woman of the house had promised to get me a teacher of the
> language, and after a while I heard a shuffling on the stairs, and the
> old dark man I had spoken to in the morning groped his way into the
> room.

> I brought him over to the fire, and we talked for many hours. He told
> me that he had known Petrie and Sir William Wilde, and many living
> antiquarians, and had taught Irish to Dr. Finck and Dr. Pedersen, and
> given stories to Mr. Curtin of America. A little after middle age he
> had fallen over a cliff, and since then he had had little eyesight,
> and a trembling of his hands and head.

> As we talked he sat huddled together over the fire, shaking and blind,
> yet his face was indescribably pliant, lighting up with an ecstasy of
> humour when he told me anything that had a point of wit or malice, and
> growing sombre and desolate again when he spoke of religion or the
> fairies.

> He had great confidence in his own powers and talent, and in the
> superiority of his stories over all other stories in the world. When
> we were speaking of Mr. Curtin, he told me that this gentleman had
> brought out a volume of his Aran stories in America, and made five
> hundred pounds by the sale of them.

> 'And what do you think he did then?' he continued; 'he wrote a book of
> his own stories after making that lot of money with mine. And he
> brought them out, and the divil a half-penny did he get for them.
> Would you believe that?'

> Afterwards he told me how one of his children had been taken by the
> fairies.

> One day a neighbor was passing, and she said, when she saw it on the
> road, 'That's a fine child.'

> Its mother tried to say 'God bless it,' but something choked the words
> in her throat.

> A while later they found a wound on its neck, and for three nights the
> house was filled with noises.

> 'I never wear a shirt at night,' he said, 'but I got up out of my bed,
> all naked as I was, when I heard the noises in the house, and lighted
> a light, but there was nothing in it.'

> Then a dummy came and made signs of hammering nails in a coffin. The
> next day the seed potatoes were full of blood, and the child told his
> mother that he was going to America.

> That night it died, and 'Believe me,' said the old man, 'the fairies
> were in it.'

> When he went away, a little bare-footed girl was sent up with turf and
> the bellows to make a fire that would last for the evening.

> She was shy, yet eager to talk, and told me that she had good spoken
> Irish, and was learning to read it in the school, and that she had
> been twice to Galway, though there are many grown women in the place
> who have never set a foot upon the mainland.

>  

>  

> The rain has cleared off, and I have had my first real introduction to
> the island and its people.

> I went out through Killeany--the poorest village in Aranmor--to a long
> neck of sandhill that runs out into the sea towards the south-west. As
> I lay there on the grass the clouds lifted from the Connemara
> mountains and, for a moment, the green undulating foreground, backed
> in the distance by a mass of hills, reminded me of the country near
> Rome. Then the dun top-sail of a hooker swept above the edge of the
> sandhill and revealed the presence of the sea.

> As I moved on a boy and a man came down from the next village to talk
> to me, and I found that here, at least, English was imperfectly
> understood. When I asked them if there were any trees in the island
> they held a hurried consultation in Gaelic, and then the man asked if
> 'tree' meant the same thing as 'bush,' for if so there were a few in
> sheltered hollows to the east.

> They walked on with me to the sound which separates this island from
> Inishmaan--the middle island of the group--and showed me the roll from
> the Atlantic running up between two walls of cliff.

> They told me that several men had stayed on Inishmaan to learn Irish,
> and the boy pointed out a line of hovels where they had lodged running
> like a belt of straw round the middle of the island. The place looked
> hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign
> of the people except these beehive-like roofs, and the outline of a
> Dun that stood out above them against the edge of the sky.

> After a while my companions went away and two other boys came and
> walked at my heels, till I turned and made them talk to me. They spoke
> at first of their poverty, and then one of them said--'I dare say you
> do have to pay ten shillings a week in the hotel?' 'More,' I answered.

> 'Twelve?'

> 'More.'

> 'Fifteen?'

> 'More still.'

> Then he drew back and did not question me any further, either thinking
> that I had lied to check his curiosity, or too awed by my riches to
> continue.

> Repassing Killeany I was joined by a man who had spent twenty years in
> America, where he had lost his health and then returned, so long ago
> that he had forgotten English and could hardly make me understand him.
> He seemed hopeless, dirty and asthmatic, and after going with me for a
> few hundred yards he stopped and asked for coppers. I had none left,
> so I gave him a fill of tobacco, and he went back to his hovel.

> When he was gone, two little girls took their place behind me and I
> drew them in turn into conversation.

> They spoke with a delicate exotic intonation that was full of charm,
> and told me with a sort of chant how they guide 'ladies and
> gintlemins' in the summer to all that is worth seeing in their
> neighbourhood, and sell them pampooties and maidenhair ferns, which
> are common among the rocks.

> We were now in Kilronan, and as we parted they showed me holes in
> their own pampooties, or cowskin sandals, and asked me the price of
> new ones. I told them that my purse was empty, and then with a few
> quaint words of blessing they turned away from me and went down to the
> pier.

> All this walk back had been extraordinarily fine. The intense insular
> clearness one sees only in Ireland, and after rain, was throwing out
> every ripple in the sea and sky, and every crevice in the hills beyond
> the bay.

>  

>  

> This evening an old man came to see me, and said he had known a
> relative of mine who passed some time on this island forty-three years
> ago.

> 'I was standing under the pier-wall mending nets,' he said, 'when you
> came off the steamer, and I said to myself in that moment, if there is
> a man of the name of Synge left walking the world, it is that man
> yonder will be he.'

> He went on to complain in curiously simple yet dignified language of
> the changes that have taken place here since he left the island to go
> to sea before the end of his childhood.

> 'I have come back,' he said, 'to live in a bit of a house with my
> sister. The island is not the same at all to what it was. It is little
> good I can get from the people who are in it now, and anything I have
> to give them they don't care to have.'

> From what I hear this man seems to have shut himself up in a world of
> individual conceits and theories, and to live aloof at his trade of
> net-mending, regarded by the other islanders with respect and
> half-ironical sympathy.

> A little later when I went down to the kitchen I found two men from
> Inishmaan who had been benighted on the island. They seemed a simpler
> and perhaps a more interesting type than the people here, and talked
> with careful English about the history of the Duns, and the Book of
> Ballymote, and the Book of Kells, and other ancient MSS., with the
> names of which they seemed familiar.

>  

>  

> ln spite of the charm of my teacher, the old blind man I met the day
> of my arrival, I have decided to move on to Inishmaan, where Gaelic is
> more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that
> is left in Europe.

> I spent all this last day with my blind guide, looking at the
> antiquities that abound in the west or north-west of the island.

> As we set out I noticed among the groups of girls who smiled at our
> fellowship--old Mourteen says we are like the cuckoo with its pipit--a
> beautiful oval face with the singularly spiritual expression that is
> so marked in one type of the West Ireland women. Later in the day, as
> the old man talked continually of the fairies and the women they have
> taken, it seemed that there was a possible link between the wild
> mythology that is accepted on the islands and the strange beauty of
> the women.

> At midday we rested near the ruins of a house, and two beautiful boys
> came up and sat near us. Old Mourteen asked them why the house was in
> ruins, and who had lived in it.

> 'A rich farmer built it a while since,' they said, 'but after two
> years he was driven away by the fairy host.'

> The boys came on with us some distance to the north to visit one of
> the ancient beehive dwellings that is still in perfect preservation.
> When we crawled in on our hands and knees, and stood up in the gloom
> of the interior, old Mourteen took a freak of earthly humour and began
> telling what he would have done if he could have come in there when he
> was a young man and a young girl along with him.

> Then he sat down in the middle of the floor and began to recite old
> Irish poetry, with an exquisite purity of intonation that brought
> tears to my eyes though I understood but little of the meaning.

> On our way home he gave me the Catholic theory of the fairies.

> When Lucifer saw himself in the glass he thought himself equal with
> God. Then the Lord threw him out of Heaven, and all the angels that
> belonged to him. While He was 'chucking them out,' an archangel asked
> Him to spare some of them, and those that were falling are in the air
> still, and have power to wreck ships, and to work evil in the world.

> From this he wandered off into tedious matters of theology, and
> repeated many long prayers and sermons in Irish that he had heard from
> the priests.

> A little further on we came to a slated house, and I asked him who was
> living in it.

> 'A kind of a schoolmistress,' he said; then his old face puckered with
> a gleam of pagan malice.

> 'Ah, master,' he said, 'wouldn't it be fine to be in there, and to be
> kissing her?'

> A couple of miles from this village we turned aside to look at an old
> ruined church of the Ceathair Aluinn (The Four Beautiful Persons), and
> a holy well near it that is famous for cures of blindness and
> epilepsy.

> As we sat near the well a very old man came up from a cottage near the
> road, and told me how it had become famous.

> 'A woman of Sligo had a son who was born blind, and one night she
> dreamed that she saw an island with a blessed well in it that could
> cure her son. She told her dream in the morning, and an old man said
> it was of Aran she was after dreaming.

> 'She brought her son down by the coast of Galway, and came out in a
> curagh, and landed below where you see a bit of a cove.

> 'She walked up then to the house of my father--God rest his soul--and
> she told them what she was looking for.

> 'My father said that there was a well like what she had dreamed of,
> and that he would send a boy along with her to show her the way.

> "There's no need, at all," said she; "haven't I seen it all in my
> dream?"

> 'Then she went out with the child and walked up to this well, and she
> kneeled down and began saying her prayers. Then she put her hand out
> for the water, and put it on his eyes, and the moment it touched him
> he called out: "O mother, look at the pretty flowers!"

> After that Mourteen described the feats of poteen drinking and
> fighting that he did in his youth, and went on to talk of Diarmid, who
> was the strongest man after Samson, and of one of the beds of Diarmid
> and Grainne, which is on the east of the island. He says that Diarmid
> was killed by the druids, who put a burning shirt on him,--a fragment
> of mythology that may connect Diarmid with the legend of Hercules, if
> it is not due to the 'learning' in some hedge-school master's ballad.

> Then we talked about Inishmaan.

> 'You'll have an old man to talk with you over there,' he said, 'and
> tell you stories of the fairies, but he's walking about with two
> sticks under him this ten year. Did ever you hear what it is goes on
> four legs when it is young, and on two legs after that, and on three
> legs when it does be old?'

> I gave him the answer.

> 'Ah, master,' he said, 'you're a cute one, and the blessing of God be
> on you. Well, I'm on three legs this minute, but the old man beyond is
> back on four; I don't know if I'm better than the way he is; he's got
> his sight and I'm only an old dark man.'

>  

>  

> I am settled at last on Inishmaan in a small cottage with a continual
> drone of Gaelic coming from the kitchen that opens into my room.

> Early this morning the man of the house came over for me with a
> four-oared curagh--that is, a curagh with four rowers and four oars on
> either side, as each man uses two--and we set off a little before
> noon.

> It gave me a moment of exquisite satisfaction to find myself moving
> away from civilisation in this rude canvas canoe of a model that has
> served primitive races since men first went to sea.

> We had to stop for a moment at a hulk that is anchored in the bay, to
> make some arrangement for the fish-curing of the middle island, and my
> crew called out as soon as we were within earshot that they had a man
> with them who had been in France a month from this day.

> When we started again, a small sail was run up in the bow, and we set
> off across the sound with a leaping oscillation that had no
> resemblance to the heavy movement of a boat.

> The sail is only used as an aid, so the men continued to row after it
> had gone up, and as they occupied the four cross-seats I lay on the
> canvas at the stern and the frame of slender laths, which bent and
> quivered as the waves passed under them.

> When we set off it was a brilliant morning of April, and the green,
> glittering waves seemed to toss the canoe among themselves, yet as we
> drew nearer this island a sudden thunderstorm broke out behind the
> rocks we were approaching, and lent a momentary tumult to this still
> vein of the Atlantic.

> We landed at a small pier, from which a rude track leads up to the
> village between small fields and bare sheets of rock like those in
> Aranmor. The youngest son of my boatman, a boy of about seventeen, who
> is to be my teacher and guide, was waiting for me at the pier and
> guided me to his house, while the men settled the curagh and followed
> slowly with my baggage.

> My room is at one end of the cottage, with a boarded floor and
> ceiling, and two windows opposite each other. Then there is the
> kitchen with earth floor and open rafters, and two doors opposite each
> other opening into the open air, but no windows. Beyond it there are
> two small rooms of half the width of the kitchen with one window
> apiece.

> The kitchen itself, where I will spend most of my time, is full of
> beauty and distinction. The red dresses of the women who cluster round
> the fire on their stools give a glow of almost Eastern richness, and
> the walls have been toned by the turf-smoke to a soft brown that
> blends with the grey earth-colour of the floor. Many sorts of
> fishing-tackle, and the nets and oil-skins of the men, are hung upon
> the walls or among the open rafters; and right overhead, under the
> thatch, there is a whole cowskin from which they make pampooties.

> Every article on these islands has an almost personal character, which
> gives this simple life, where all art is unknown, something of the
> artistic beauty of medieval life. The curaghs and spinning-wheels, the
> tiny wooden barrels that are still much used in the place of
> earthenware, the home-made cradles, churns, and baskets, are all full
> of individuality, and being made from materials that are common here,
> yet to some extent peculiar to the island, they seem to exist as a
> natural link between the people and the world that is about them.

> The simplicity and unity of the dress increases in another way the
> local air of beauty. The women wear red petticoats and jackets of the
> island wool stained with madder, to which they usually add a plaid
> shawl twisted round their chests and tied at their back. When it rains
> they throw another petticoat over their heads with the waistband round
> their faces, or, if they are young, they use a heavy shawl like those
> worn in Galway. Occasionally other wraps are worn, and during the
> thunderstorm I arrived in I saw several girls with men's waistcoats
> buttoned round their bodies. Their skirts do not come much below the
> knee, and show their powerful legs in the heavy indigo stockings with
> which they are all provided.

> The men wear three colours: the natural wool, indigo, and a grey
> flannel that is woven of alternate threads of indigo and the natural
> wool. In Aranmor many of the younger men have adopted the usual
> fisherman's jersey, but I have only seen one on this island.

> As flannel is cheap--the women spin the yarn from the wool of their
> own sheep, and it is then woven by a weaver in Kilronan for fourpence
> a yard--the men seem to wear an indefinite number of waistcoats and
> woollen drawers one over the other. They are usually surprised at the
> lightness of my own dress, and one old man I spoke to for a minute on
> the pier, when I came ashore, asked me if I was not cold with 'my
> little clothes.'

> As I sat in the kitchen to dry the spray from my coat, several men who
> had seen me walking up came in to me to talk to me, usually murmuring
> on the threshold, 'The blessing of God on this place,' or some similar
> words.

> The courtesy of the old woman of the house is singularly attractive,
> and though I could not understand much of what she said--she has no
> English--I could see with how much grace she motioned each visitor to
> a chair, or stool, according to his age, and said a few words to him
> till he drifted into our English conversation.

> For the moment my own arrival is the chief subject of interest, and
> the men who come in are eager to talk to me.

> Some of them express themselves more correctly than the ordinary
> peasant, others use the Gaelic idioms continually and substitute 'he'
> or 'she' for 'it,' as the neuter pronoun is not found in modern Irish.

> A few of the men have a curiously full vocabulary, others know only
> the commonest words in English, and are driven to ingenious devices to
> express their meaning. Of all the subjects we can talk of war seems
> their favourite, and the conflict between America and Spain is causing
> a great deal of excitement. Nearly all the families have relations who
> have had to cross the Atlantic, and all eat of the flour and bacon
> that is brought from the United States, so they have a vague fear that
> 'if anything happened to America,' their own island would cease to be
> habitable.

> Foreign languages are another favourite topic, and as these men are
> bilingual they have a fair notion of what it means to speak and think
> in many different idioms. Most of the strangers they see on the
> islands are philological students, and the people have been led to
> conclude that linguistic studies, particularly Gaelic studies, are the
> chief occupation of the outside world.

> 'I have seen Frenchmen, and Danes, and Germans,' said one man, 'and
> there does be a power a Irish books along with them, and they reading
> them better than ourselves. Believe me there are few rich men now in
> the world who are not studying the Gaelic.'

> They sometimes ask me the French for simple phrases, and when they
> have listened to the intonation for a moment, most of them are able to
> reproduce it with admirable precision.

>  

>  

> When I was going out this morning to walk round the island with
> Michael, the boy who is teaching me Irish, I met an old man making his
> way down to the cottage. He was dressed in miserable black clothes
> which seemed to have come from the mainland, and was so bent with
> rheumatism that, at a little distance, he looked more like a spider
> than a human being.

> Michael told me it was Pat Dirane, the story-teller old Mourteen had
> spoken of on the other island. I wished to turn back, as he appeared
> to be on his way to visit me, but Michael would not hear of it.

> 'He will be sitting by the fire when we come in,' he said; 'let you
> not be afraid, there will be time enough to be talking to him by and
> by.'

> He was right. As I came down into the kitchen some hours later old Pat
> was still in the chimney-corner, blinking with the turf smoke.

> He spoke English with remarkable aptness and fluency, due, I believe,
> to the months he spent in the English provinces working at the harvest
> when he was a young man.

> After a few formal compliments he told me how he had been crippled by
> an attack of the 'old hin' (i.e. the influenza), and had been
> complaining ever since in addition to his rheumatism.

> While the old woman was cooking my dinner he asked me if I liked
> stories, and offered to tell one in English, though he added, it would
> be much better if I could follow the Gaelic. Then he began:--

> There were two farmers in County Clare. One had a son, and the other,
> a fine rich man, had a daughter.

> The young man was wishing to marry the girl, and his father told him
> to try and get her if he thought well, though a power of gold would be
> wanting to get the like of her.

> 'I will try,' said the young man.

> He put all his gold into a bag. Then he went over to the other farm,
> and threw in the gold in front of him.

> 'Is that all gold?' said the father of the girl.

> 'All gold,' said O'Conor (the young man's name was O'Conor).

> 'It will not weigh down my daughter,' said the father.

> 'We'll see that,' said O'Conor.

> Then they put them in the scales, the daughter in one side and the
> gold in the other. The girl went down against the ground, so O'Conor
> took his bag and went out on the road.

> As he was going along he came to where there was a little man, and he
> standing with his back against the wall.

> 'Where are you going with the bag?' said the little man. 'Going home,'
> said O'Conor.

> "Is it gold you might be wanting?' said the man. 'It is, surely,' said
> O'Conor.

> 'I'll give you what you are wanting,' said the man, 'and we can
> bargain in this way--you'll pay me back in a year the gold I give you,
> or you'll pay me with five pounds cut off your own flesh.'

> That bargain was made between them. The man gave a bag of gold to
> O'Conor, and he went back with it, and was married to the young woman.

> They were rich people, and he built her a grand castle on the cliffs
> of Clare, with a window that looked out straight over the wild ocean.

> One day when he went up with his wife to look out over the wild ocean,
> he saw a ship coming in on the rocks, and no sails on her at all. She
> was wrecked on the rocks, and it was tea that was in her, and fine
> silk.

> O'Conor and his wife went down to look at the wreck, and when the lady
> O'Conor saw the silk she said she wished a dress of it.

> They got the silk from the sailors, and when the Captain came up to
> get the money for it, O'Conor asked him to come again and take his
> dinner with them. They had a grand dinner, and they drank after it,
> and the Captain was tipsy. While they were still drinking, a letter
> came to O'Conor, and it was in the letter that a friend of his was
> dead, and that he would have to go away on a long journey. As he was
> getting ready the Captain came to him.

> 'Are you fond of your wife?' said the Captain.

> 'I am fond of her,' said O'Conor.

> 'Will you make me a bet of twenty guineas no man comes near her while
> you'll be away on the journey?' said the Captain.

> 'I will bet it,' said O'Conor; and he went away.

> There was an old hag who sold small things on the road near the
> castle, and the lady O'Conor allowed her to sleep up in her room in a
> big box. The Captain went down on the road to the old hag.

> 'For how much will you let me sleep one night in your box?' said the
> Captain.

> 'For no money at all would I do such a thing,' said the hag.

> 'For ten guineas?' said the Captain.

> 'Not for ten guineas,' said the hag.

> 'For twelve guineas?' said the Captain.

> 'Not for twelve guineas,' said the hag.

> 'For fifteen guineas?' said the Captain.

> 'For fifteen I will do it,' said the hag.

> Then she took him up and hid him in the box. When night came the lady
> O'Conor walked up into her room, and the Captain watched her through a
> hole that was in the box. He saw her take off her two rings and put
> them on a kind of a board that was over her head like a chimney-piece,
> and take off her clothes, except her shift, and go up into her bed.

> As soon as she was asleep the Captain came out of his box, and he had
> some means of making a light, for he lit the candle. He went over to
> the bed where she was sleeping without disturbing her at all, or doing
> any bad thing, and he took the two rings off the board, and blew out
> the light, and went down again into the box.

>  

>  

> He paused for a moment, and a deep sigh of relief rose from the men
> and women who had crowded in while the story was going on, till the
> kitchen was filled with people.

> As the Captain was coming out of his box the girls, who had appeared
> to know no English, stopped their spinning and held their breath with
> expectation.

> The old man went on--

> When O'Conor came back the Captain met him, and told him that he had
> been a night in his wife's room, and gave him the two rings. O'Conor
> gave him the twenty guineas of the bet. Then he went up into the
> castle, and he took his wife up to look out of the window over the
> wild ocean. While she was looking he pushed her from behind, and she
> fell down over the cliff into the sea.

> An old woman was on the shore, and she saw her falling. She went down
> then to the surf and pulled her out all wet and in great disorder, and
> she took the wet clothes off her, and put on some old rags belonging
> to herself.

> When O'Conor had pushed his wife from the window he went away into the
> land.

> After a while the lady O'Conor went out searching for him, and when
> she had gone here and there a long time in the country, she heard that
> he was reaping in a field with sixty men.

> are not satisfied, and ask how long is left them before the twilight.

> The general knowledge of time on the island depends, curiously enough,
> on the direction of the wind. Nearly all the cottages are built, like
> this one, with two doors opposite each other, the more sheltered of
> which lies open all day to give light to the interior. If the wind is

> moving across the kitchen floor indicates the hour; as soon, however,
> as the wind changes to the south the other door is opened, and the
> people, who never think of putting up a primitive dial, are at a loss.

> This system of doorways has another curious result. It usually happens
> that all the doors on one side of the village pathway are lying open
> with women sitting about on the thresholds, while on the other side
> the doors are shut and there is no sign of life. The moment the wind
> changes everything is reversed, and sometimes when I come back to the
> village after an hour's walk there seems to have been a general flight
> from one side of the way to the other.

> In my own cottage the change of the doors alters the whole tone of the
> kitchen, turning it from a brilliantly-lighted room looking out on a
> yard and laneway to a sombre cell with a superb view of the sea.

> When the wind is from the north the old woman manages my meals with

> The general ignorance of any precise hours in the day makes it

> They seem to eat together in the evening, and sometimes in the
> morning, a little after dawn, before they scatter for their work, but
> during the day they simply drink a cup of tea and eat a piece of
> bread, or some potatoes, whenever they are hungry.

> For men who live in the open air they eat strangely little. Often when
> Michael has been out weeding potatoes for eight or nine hours without
> food, he comes in and eats a few slices of home-made bread, and then
> he is ready to go out with me and wander for hours about the island.

> They use no animal food except a little bacon and salt fish. The old
> woman says she would be very ill if she ate fresh meat.

> Some years ago, before tea, sugar, and flour had come into general

> it was towed out to the hooker and dragged on board in a half-drowned
> condition.

> The freedom of the sand seemed to give a stronger spirit of revolt,
> and some of the animals were only caught after a dangerous struggle.
> The first attempt was not always successful, and I saw one
> three-year-old lift two men with his horns, and drag another fifty
> yards along the sand by his tail before he was subdued.

> the road, I got in the way the walls would give me shelter.

> As I was looking round I saw a light in some trees two perches off,
> and thinking any sort of a house would be better than where I was, I
> got over a wall and went up to the house to look in at the window.

> I saw a dead man laid on a table, and candles lighted, and a woman
> watching him. I was frightened when I saw him, but it was raining
> hard, and I said to myself, if he was dead he couldn't hurt me. Then I
> knocked on the door and the woman came and opened it.

> 'Good evening, ma'am,' says I.

> 'Good evening kindly, stranger,' says she, 'Come in out of the rain.'
> Then she took me in and told me her husband was after dying on her,
> and she was watching him that night.

> 'But it's thirsty you'll be, stranger,' says she, 'Come into the
> parlour.' Then she took me into the parlour--and it was a fine clean
> house--and she put a cup, with a saucer under it, on the table before
> me with fine sugar and bread.

> When I'd had a cup of tea I went back into the kitchen where the dead
> man was lying, and she gave me a fine new pipe off the table with a
> drop of spirits.

> 'Stranger,' says she, 'would you be afeard to be alone with himself?'

> 'Not a bit in the world, ma'am,' says I; 'he that's dead can do no
> hurt,' Then she said she wanted to go over and tell the neighbours the
> way her husband was after dying on her, and she went out and locked
> the door behind her.

> I smoked one pipe, and I leaned out and took another off the table. I
> was smoking it with my hand on the back of my chair--the way you are
> yourself this minute, God bless you--and I looking on the dead man,
> when he opened his eyes as wide as myself and looked at me.

> 'Don't be afraid, stranger,' said the dead man; 'I'm not dead at all
> in the world. Come here and help me up and I'll tell you all about
> it.'

> Well, I went up and took the sheet off of him, and I saw that he had a
> fine clean shirt on his body, and fine flannel drawers.

> He sat up then, and says he--

> 'I've got a bad wife, stranger, and I let on to be dead the way I'd
> catch her goings on.'

> Then he got two fine sticks he had to keep down his wife, and he put
> them at each side of his body, and he laid himself out again as if he
> was dead.

> In half an hour his wife came back and a young man along with her.
> Well, she gave him his tea, and she told him he was tired, and he
> would do right to go and lie down in the bedroom.

> The young man went in and the woman sat down to watch by the dead man.
> A while after she got up and 'Stranger,' says she, 'I'm going in to
> get the candle out of the room; I'm thinking the young man will be

> Then the dead man got up, and he took one stick, and he gave the other

> That is my story.

>  

>  

> In stories of this kind he always speaks in the first person, with

> It has cleared, and the sun is shining with a luminous warmth that

> the low eastern portion of the island, nearly all the men, and all the
> oldest women, wearing petticoats over their heads, came out and joined
> in the procession.

> While the grave was being opened the women sat down among the flat
> tombstones, bordered with a pale fringe of early bracken, and began

> turn in the leading recitative, seemed possessed for the moment with a
> profound ecstasy of grief, swaying to and fro, and bending her
> forehead to the stone before her, while she called out to the dead
> with a perpetually recurring chant of sobs.

> All round the graveyard other wrinkled women, looking out from under
> the deep red petticoats that cloaked them, rocked themselves with the
> same rhythm, and intoned the inarticulate chant that is sustained by
> all as an accompaniment.

> The morning had been beautifully fine, but as they lowered the coffin
> into the grave, thunder rumbled overhead and hailstones hissed among
> the bracken.

> In Inishmaan one is forced to believe in a sympathy between man and
> nature, and at this moment when the thunder sounded a death-peal of
> extraordinary grandeur above the voices of the women, I could see the
> faces near me stiff and drawn with emotion.

> When the coffin was in the grave, and the thunder had rolled away
> across the hills of Clare, the keen broke out again more passionately
> than before.

> This grief of the keen is no personal complaint for the death of one
> woman over eighty years, but seems to contain the whole passionate
> rage that lurks somewhere in every native of the island. In this cry
> of pain the inner consciousness of the people seems to lay itself bare
> for an instant, and to reveal the mood of beings who feel their
> isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and
> seas. They are usually silent, but in the presence of death all
> outward show of indifference or patience is forgotten, and they shriek
> with pitiable despair before the horror of the fate to which they are
> all doomed.

> Before they covered the coffin an old man kneeled down by the grave
> and repeated a simple prayer for the dead.

> There was an irony in these words of atonement and Catholic belief
> spoken by voices that were still hoarse with the cries of pagan
> desperation.

> A little beyond the grave I saw a line of old women who had recited in
> the keen sitting in the shadow of a wall beside the roofless shell of
> the church. They were still sobbing and shaken with grief, yet they
> were beginning to talk again of the daily trifles that veil from them
> the terror of the world.

> When we had all come out of the graveyard, and two men had rebuilt the
> hole in the wall through which the coffin had been carried in, we
> walked back to the village, talking of anything, and joking of
> anything, as if merely coming from the boat-slip, or the pier.

> One man told me of the poteen drinking that takes place at some
> funerals.

> 'A while since,' he said, 'there were two men fell down in the
> graveyard while the drink was on them. The sea was rough that day, the
> way no one could go to bring the doctor, and one of the men never woke
> again, and found death that night.'

> The other day the men of this house made a new field. There was a
> slight bank of earth under the wall of the yard, and another in the
> corner of the cabbage garden. The old man and his eldest son dug out

> It is now nine days since rain has fallen, and the people are filled
> with anxiety, although the sun has not yet been hot enough to do harm.

> The drought is also causing a scarcity of water. There are a few

> is drawn off at once it is not very nauseous, but if it has lain, as

> taste are unendurable. The water for washing is also coming short, and
> as I walk round the edges of the sea, I often come on a girl with her
> petticoats tucked up round her, standing in a pool left by the tide
> and washing her flannels among the sea-anemones and crabs. Their red
> bodices and white tapering legs make them as beautiful as tropical
> sea-birds, as they stand in a frame of seaweeds against the brink of
> the Atlantic. Michael, however, is a little uneasy when they are in
> sight, and I cannot pause to watch them. This habit of using the sea
> water for washing causes a good deal of rheumatism on the island, for
> the salt lies in the clothes and keeps them continually moist.

> The people have taken advantage of this dry moment to begin the
> burning of the kelp, and all the islands are lying in a volume of grey
> smoke. There will not be a very large quantity this year, as the
> people are discouraged by the uncertainty of the market, and do not

> profit.

> The work needed to form a ton of kelp is considerable. The seaweed is
> collected from the rocks after the storms of autumn and winter, dried
> on fine days, and then made up into a rick, where it is left till the
> beginning of June.

> It is then burnt in low kilns on the shore, an affair that takes from
> twelve to twenty-four hours of continuous hard work, though I
> understand the people here do not manage well and spoil a portion of
> what they produce by burning it more than is required.

> Their shipping and transport is even more difficult than that of the

> Apart, however, from this primitive babble, the dexterity and power of

> by his single weight when it was swinging from the masthead, and
> preserved a humorous calm even in moments of the wildest excitement.
> Sometimes a large mare would come down sideways on the backs of the
> other horses, and kick there till the hold seemed to be filled with a
> mass of struggling centaurs, for the men themselves often leap down to

> and as they are not on their way to a fair, it is not of much
> consequence in what condition they come to land.

> There is only one bit and saddle in the island, which are used by the
> priest, who rides from the chapel to the pier when he has held the
> service on Sunday.

> The islanders themselves ride with a simple halter and a stick, yet
> sometimes travel, at least in the larger island, at a desperate
> gallop. As the horses usually have panniers, the rider sits sideways
> over the withers, and if the panniers are empty they go at full speed
> in this position without anything to hold to.

> More than once in Aranmor I met a party going out west with empty
> panniers from Kilronan. Long before they came in sight I could hear a
> clatter of hoofs, and then a whirl of horses would come round a corner
> at full gallop with their heads out, utterly indifferent to the
> slender halter that is their only check. They generally travel in
> single file with a few yards between them, and as there is no traffic
> there is little fear of an accident.

> Sometimes a woman and a man ride together, but in this case the man
> sits in the usual position, and the woman sits sideways behind him,
> and holds him round the waist.

> Old Pat Dirane continues to come up every day to talk to me, and at
> times I turn the conversation to his experiences of the fairies.

> He has seen a good many of them, he says, in different parts of the
> island, especially in the sandy districts north of the slip. They are
> about a yard high with caps like the 'peelers' pulled down over their
> faces. On one occasion he saw them playing ball in the evening just
> above the slip, and he says I must avoid that place in the morning or
> after nightfall for fear they might do me mischief.

> He has seen two women who were 'away' with them, one a young married
> woman, the other a girl. The woman was standing by a wall, at a spot
> he described to me with great care, looking out towards the north

> Another night he heard a voice crying out in Irish, 'mháthair tá mé
> marbh' ('O mother, I'm killed'), and in the morning there was blood on
> the wall of his house, and a child in a house not far off was dead.

> Yesterday he took me aside, and said he would tell me a secret he had
> never yet told to any person in the world.

> 'Take a sharp needle,' he said, 'and stick it in under the collar of
> your coat, and not one of them will be able to have power on you.'

> Iron is a common talisman with barbarians, but in this case the idea

> The fairies are more numerous in Mayo than in any other county, though
> they are fond of certain districts in Galway, where the following
> story is said to have taken place.

> 'A farmer was in great distress as his crops had failed, and his cow
> had died on him. One night he told his wife to make him a fine new
> sack for flour before the next morning; and when it was finished he
> started off with it before the dawn.

> 'At that time there was a gentleman who had been taken by the fairies,
> and made an officer among them, and it was often people would see him
> and him riding on a white horse at dawn and in the evening.

> 'The poor man went down to the place where they used to see the
> officer, and when he came by on his horse, he asked the loan of two
> hundred and a half of flour, for he was in great want.

> 'The officer called the fairies out of a hole in the rocks where they
> stored their wheat, and told them to give the poor man what he was
> asking. Then he told him to come back and pay him in a year, and rode
> away.

> 'When the poor man got home he wrote down the day on a piece of paper,
> and that day year he came back and paid the officer.'

> When he had ended his story the old man told me that the fairies have
> a tenth of all the produce of the country, and make stores of it in
> the rocks.

> It is a Holy Day, and I have come up to sit on the Dun while the
> people are at Mass.

> A strange tranquility has come over the island this morning, as
> happens sometimes on Sunday, filling the two circles of sea and sky
> with the quiet of a church.

> The one landscape that is here lends itself with singular power to

> On these rocks, where there is no growth of vegetable or animal life,

> The first group of men are coming out of the chapel, followed by a

> The silence is broken; I can hear far off, as if over water, a faint

> In the afternoon the sun came out and I was rowed over for a visit to
> Kilronan.

> As my men were bringing round the curagh to take me off a headland

> Every few hundred yards one of the rowers had to stop and bail, but

> When we were about half way across the sound we met a curagh coming

> After my weeks in Inishmaan, Kilronan seemed an imposing centre of

> I turned in for a moment to talk to the old couple in the hotel, and
> then moved on to pay some other visits in the village.

> Later in the evening I walked out along the northern road, where I met
> many of the natives of the outlying villages, who had come down to

> The women and girls, when they had no men with them, usually tried to

> 'Is it tired you are, stranger?' said one girl. I was walking very
> slowly, to pass the time before my return to the east.

> 'Bedad, it is not, little girl,' I answered in Gaelic, 'It is lonely I
> am.'

> 'Here is my little sister, stranger, who will give you her arm.'

> And so it went. Quiet as these women are on ordinary occasions, when
> two or three of them are gathered together in their holiday
> petti-coats and shawls, they are as wild and capricious as the women
> who live in towns.

> About seven o'clock I got back to Kilronan, and beat up my crew from
> the public-houses near the bay. With their usual carelessness they had
> not seen to the leak in the curagh, nor to an oar that was losing the
> brace that holds it to the toll-pin, and we moved off across the sound
> at an absurd pace with a deepening pool at our feet.

> A superb evening light was lying over the island, which made me
> rejoice at our delay. Looking back there was a golden haze behind the
> sharp edges of the rock, and a long wake from the sun, which was
> making jewels of the bubbling left by the oars.

> The men had had their share of porter and were unusually voluble,
> pointing out things to me that I had already seen, and stopping now
> and then to make me notice the oily smell of mackerel that was rising
> from the waves.

> They told me that an evicting party is coming to the island tomorrow
> morning, and gave me a long account of what they make and spend in a
> year and of their trouble with the rent.

> 'The rent is hard enough for a poor man,' said one of them, 'but this

> I asked afterwards who the island belonged to.

> 'Bedad,' they said, 'we've always heard it belonged to Miss - and she
> is dead.'

> When the sun passed like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea the cold
> became intense. Then the men began to talk among themselves, and
> losing the thread, I lay half in a dream looking at the pale oily sea
> about us, and the low cliffs of the island sloping up past the village

> Old Pat was in the house when I arrived, and he told a long story
> after supper:--

> There was once a widow living among the woods, and her only son living
> along with her. He went out every morning through the trees to get
> sticks, and one day as he was lying on the ground he saw a swarm of
> flies flying over what the cow leaves behind her. He took up his
> sickle and hit one blow at them, and hit that hard he left no single
> one of them living.

> That evening he said to his mother that it was time he was going out
> into the world to seek his fortune, for he was able to destroy a whole
> swarm of flies at one blow, and he asked her to make him three cakes
> the way he might take them with him in the morning.

> He started the next day a while after the dawn, with his three cakes
> in his wallet, and he ate one of them near ten o'clock.

> He got hungry again by midday and ate the second, and when night was
> coming on him he ate the third. After that he met a man on the road
> who asked him where he was going.

> 'I'm looking for some place where I can work for my living,' said the
> young man.

> 'Come with me,' said the other man, 'and sleep to-night in the barn,
> and I'll give you work to-morrow to see what you're able for.'

> The next morning the farmer brought him out and showed him his cows
> and told him to take them out to graze on the hills, and to keep good
> watch that no one should come near them to milk them. The young man
> drove out the cows into the fields, and when the heat of the day came
> on he lay down on his back and looked up into the sky. A while after
> he saw a black spot in the north-west, and it grew larger and nearer
> till he saw a great giant coming towards him.

> He got up on his feet and he caught the giant round the legs with his
> two arms, and he drove him down into the hard ground above his ankles,
> the way he was not able to free himself. Then the giant told him to do
> him no hurt, and gave him his magic rod, and told him to strike on the
> rock, and he would find his beautiful black horse, and his sword, and
> his fine suit.

> The young man struck the rock and it opened before him, and he found
> the beautiful black horse, and the giant's sword and the suit lying
> before him. He took out the sword alone, and he struck one blow with
> it and struck off the giant's head. Then he put back the sword into
> the rock, and went out again to his cattle, till it was time to drive
> them home to the farmer.

> When they came to milk the cows they found a power of milk in them,
> and the farmer asked the young man if he had seen nothing out on the
> hills, for the other cow-boys had been bringing home the cows with no
> drop of milk in them. And the young man said he had seen nothing.

> The next day he went out again with the cows. He lay down on his back
> in the heat of the day, and after a while he saw a black spot in the
> north-west, and it grew larger and nearer, till he saw it was a great
> giant coming to attack him.

> 'You killed my brother,' said the giant; 'come here, till I make a
> garter of your body.'

> The young man went to him and caught him by the legs and drove him
> down into the hard ground up to his ankles.

> Then he hit the rod against the rock, and took out the sword and
> struck off the giant's head.

> That evening the farmer found twice as much milk in the cows as the
> evening before, and he asked the young man if he had seen anything.
> The young man said that he had seen nothing.

> The third day the third giant came to him and said, 'You have killed
> my two brothers; come here, till I make a garter of your body.'

> And he did with this giant as he had done with the other two, and that
> evening there was so much milk in the cows it was dropping out of
> their udders on the pathway.

> The next day the farmer called him and told him he might leave the
> cows in the stalls that day, for there was a great curiosity to be
> seen, namely, a beautiful king's daughter that was to be eaten by a
> great fish, if there was no one in it that could save her. But the
> young man said such a sight was all one to him, and he went out with
> the cows on to the hills. When he came to the rocks he hit them with
> his rod and brought out the suit and put it on him, and brought out
> the sword and strapped it on his side, like an officer, and he got on
> the black horse and rode faster than the wind till he came to where
> the beautiful king's daughter was sitting on the shore in a golden
> chair, waiting for the great fish.

> When the great fish came in on the sea, bigger than a whale, with two
> wings on the back of it, the young man went down into the surf and
> struck at it with his sword and cut off one of its wings. All the sea
> turned red with the bleeding out of it, till it swam away and left the
> young man on the shore.

> Then he turned his horse and rode faster than the wind till he came to
> the rocks, and he took the suit off him and put it back in the rocks,
> with the giant's sword and the black horse, and drove the cows down to
> the farm.

> The man came out before him and said he had missed the greatest wonder
> ever was, and that a noble person was after coming down with a fine
> suit on him and cutting off one of the wings from the great fish.

> 'And there'll be the same necessity on her for two mornings more,'
> said the farmer, 'and you'd do right to come and look on it.'

> But the young man said he would not come.

> The next morning he went out with his cows, and he took the sword and
> the suit and the black horse out of the rock, and he rode faster than
> the wind till he came where the king's daughter was sitting on the
> shore. When the people saw him coming there was great wonder on them
> to know if it was the same man they had seen the day before. The
> king's daughter called out to him to come and kneel before her, and
> when he kneeled down she took her scissors and cut off a lock of hair
> from the back of his head and hid it in her clothes.

> Then the great worm came in from the sea, and he went down into the
> surf and cut the other wing off from it. All the sea turned red with
> the bleeding out of it, till it swam away and left them.

> That evening the farmer came out before him and told him of the great
> wonder he had missed, and asked him would he go the next day and look
> on it. The young man said he would not go.

> The third day he came again on the black horse to where the king's
> daughter was sitting on a golden chair waiting for the great worm.
> When it came in from the sea the young man went down before it, and
> every time it opened its mouth to eat him, he struck into its mouth,
> till his sword went out through its neck, and it rolled back and died.

> Then he rode off faster than the wind, and he put the suit and the
> sword and the black horse into the rock, and drove home the cows.

> The farmer was there before him and he told him that there was to be a
> great marriage feast held for three days, and on the third day the
> king's daughter would be married to the man that killed the great
> worm, if they were able to find him.

> A great feast was held, and men of great strength came and said it was
> themselves were after killing the great worm.

> But on the third day the young man put on the suit, and strapped the
> sword to his side like an officer, and got on the black horse and rode
> faster than the wind, till he came to the palace.

> The king's daughter saw him, and she brought him in and made him kneel
> down before her. Then she looked at the back of his head and saw the
> place where she had cut off the lock with her own hand. She led him in

> As the steamer drew near I moved down with the men to watch the
> arrival, though no one went further than about a mile from the shore.

> Two curaghs from Kilronan with a man who was to give help in
> identifying the cottages, the doctor, and the relieving officer, were
> drifting with the tide, unwilling to come to land without the support
> of the larger party. When the anchor had been thrown it gave me a
> strange throb of pain to see the boats being lowered, and the sunshine
> gleaming on the rifles and helmets of the constabulary who crowded
> into them.

> Once on shore the men were formed in close marching order, a word was

> After a while two of these pigs escaped from the drivers and began a

> They reached the line of the police. There was a slight scuffle, and

> The satisfaction of the people was immense. They shrieked and hugged

> Two hours later the other party returned, driving three lean cows

> Old Pat has told me a story of the goose that lays the golden eggs,

> A poor widow had three sons and a daughter. One day when her sons were

> flying in the trees. The next day they saw it again, and the eldest
> son told his brothers to go and get sticks by themselves, for he was

> He went after it, and brought it in with him when he came home in the

> meal they had for themselves;--I don't know if it ate the meal, but
> they divided what they had themselves; they could do no more.

> That night it laid a fine spotted egg in the basket. The next night it
> laid another.

> At that time its name was on the papers and many heard of the bird
> that laid the golden eggs, for the eggs were of gold, and there's no
> lie in it.

> When the boys went down to the shop the next day to buy a stone of
> meal, the shopman asked if he could buy the bird of them. Well, it was
> arranged in this way. The shopman would marry the boys' sister--a poor
> simple girl without a stitch of good clothes--and get the bird with

> Some time after that one of the boys sold an egg of the bird to a

> after getting it.

> 'Well,' said the gentleman, 'the man who eats the heart of that bird
> will find a purse of gold beneath him every morning, and the man who
> eats its liver will be king of Ireland.'

> The boy went out--he was a simple poor fellow--and told the shopman.

> Then the shopman brought in the bird and killed it, and he ate the
> heart himself and he gave the liver to his wife.

> When the boy saw that, there was great anger on him, and he went back
> and told the gentleman.

> 'Do what I'm telling you,' said the gentleman. 'Go down now and tell
> the shopman and his wife to come up here to play a game of cards with
> me, for it's lonesome I am this evening.'

> When the boy was gone he mixed a vomit and poured the lot of it into a

> the cards.

> The man came up with his wife and they began to play.

> The shopman won the first game and the gentleman made them drink a sup
> of the whiskey.

> They played again and the shopman won the second game. Then the

> This morning I had a long talk with an old man who was rejoicing over
> the improvement he had seen here during the last ten or fifteen years.

> Till recently there was no communication with the mainland except by
> hookers, which were usually slow, and could only make the voyage in
> tolerably fine weather, so that if an islander went to a fair it was
> often three weeks before he could return. Now, however, the steamer
> comes here twice in the week, and the voyage is made in three or four
> hours.

> The pier on this island is also a novelty, and is much thought of, as
> it enables the hookers that still carry turf and cattle to discharge
> and take their cargoes directly from the shore. The water round it,
> however, is only deep enough for a hooker when the tide is nearly
> full, and will never float the steamer, so passengers must still come
> to land in curaghs. The boat-slip at the corner next the south island
> is extremely useful in calm weather, but it is exposed to a heavy roll
> from the south, and is so narrow that the curaghs run some danger of
> missing it in the tumult of the surf.

> In bad weather four men will often stand for nearly an hour at the top
> of the slip with a curagh in their hands, watching a point of rock
> towards the south where they can see the strength of the waves that
> are coming in.

> The instant a break is seen they swoop down to the surf, launch their
> curagh, and pull out to sea with incredible speed. Coming to land Is
> attended with the same difficulty, and, if their moment is badly
> chosen, they are likely to be washed sideways and swamped among the
> rocks.

> This continual danger, which can only be escaped by extraordinary
> personal dexterity, has had considerable influence on the local
> character, as the waves have made it impossible for clumsy, foolhardy,
> or timid men to live on these islands.

> When the steamer is within a mile of the slip, the curaghs are put out
> and range themselves--there are usually from four to a dozen--in two
> lines at some distance from the shore.

> The moment she comes in among them there is a short but desperate
> struggle for good places at her side. The men are lolling on their
> oars talking with the dreamy tone which comes with the rocking of the
> waves. The steamer lies to, and in an instant their faces become
> distorted with passion, while the oars bend and quiver with the
> strain. For one minute they seem utterly indifferent to their own
> safety and that of their friends and brothers. Then the sequence is
> decided, and they begin to talk again with the dreamy tone that is
> habitual to them, while they make fast and clamber up into the
> steamer.

> While the curaghs are out I am left with a few women and very old men
> who cannot row. One of these old men, whom I often talk with, has some
> fame as a bone-setter, and is said to have done remarkable cures, both
> here and on the mainland. Stories are told of how he has been taken
> off by the quality in their carriages through the hills of Connemara,
> to treat their sons and daughters, and come home with his pockets full
> of money.

>

> Another old man, the oldest on the island, is fond of telling me
> anecdotes--not folktales--of things that have happened here in his
> lifetime.

> He often tells me about a Connaught man who killed his father with the
> blow of a spade when he was in passion, and then fled to this island
> and threw himself on the mercy of some of the natives with whom he was
> said to be related. They hid him in a hole--which the old man has
> shown me--and kept him safe for weeks, though the police came and
> searched for him, and he could hear their boots grinding on the stones
> over his head. In spite of a reward which was offered, the island was
> incorruptible, and after much trouble the man was safely shipped to
> America.

> This impulse to protect the criminal is universal in the west. It
> seems partly due to the association between justice and the hated
> English jurisdiction, but more directly to the primitive feeling of
> these people, who are never criminals yet always capable of crime,
> that a man will not do wrong unless he is under the influence of a
> passion which is as irresponsible as a storm on the sea. If a man has
> killed his father, and is already sick and broken with remorse, they
> can see no reason why he should be dragged away and killed by the law.

> Such a man, they say, will be quiet all the rest of his life, and if
> you suggest that punishment is needed as an example, they ask, 'Would
> any one kill his father if he was able to help it?'

> Some time ago, before the introduction of police, all the people of
> the islands were as innocent as the people here remain to this day. I
> have heard that at that time the ruling proprietor and magistrate of
> the north island used to give any man who had done wrong a letter to a
> jailer in Galway, and send him off by himself to serve a term of
> imprisonment.

> As there was no steamer, the ill-doer was given a passage in some
> chance hooker to the nearest point on the mainland. Then he walked for
> many miles along a desolate shore till he reached the town. When his
> time had been put through he crawled back along the same route, feeble
> and emaciated, and had often to wait many weeks before he could regain
> the island. Such at least is the story.

> It seems absurd to apply the same laws to these people and to the
> criminal classes of a city. The most intelligent man on Inishmaan has
> often spoken to me of his contempt of the law, and of the increase of
> crime the police have brought to Aranmor. On this island, he says, if
> men have a little difference, or a little fight, their friends take
> care it does not go too far, and in a little time it is forgotten. In
> Kilronan there is a band of men paid to make out cases for themselves;
> the moment a blow is struck they come down and arrest the man who gave
> it. The other man he quarreled with has to give evidence against him;
> whole families come down to the court and swear against each other
> till they become bitter enemies. If there is a conviction the man who
> is convicted never forgives. He waits his time, and before the year is
> out there is a cross summons, which the other man in turn never
> forgives. The feud continues to grow, till a dispute about the colour
> of a man's hair may end in a murder, after a year's forcing by the
> law. The mere fact that it is impossible to get reliable evidence in
> the island--not because the people are dishonest, but because they
> think the claim of kinship more sacred than the claims of abstract
> truth--turns the whole system of sworn evidence into a demoralising
> farce, and it is easy to believe that law dealings on this false basis
> must lead to every sort of injustice.

> While I am discussing these questions with the old men the curaghs
> begin to come in with cargoes of salt, and flour, and porter.

> To-day a stir was made by the return of a native who had spent five
> years in New York. He came on shore with half a dozen people who had
> been shopping on the mainland, and walked up and down on the slip in
> his neat suit, looking strangely foreign to his birthplace, while his
> old mother of eighty-five ran about on the slippery seaweed, half
> crazy with delight, telling every one the news.

> When the curaghs were in their places the men crowded round him to bid
> him welcome. He shook hands with them readily enough, but with no
> smile of recognition.

> He is said to be dying.

> Yesterday--a Sunday--three young men rowed me over to Inisheer, the
> south island of the group.

> The stern of the curagh was occupied, so I was put in the bow with my
> head on a level with the gunnel. A considerable sea was running in the
> sound, and when we came out from the shelter of this island, the
> curagh rolled and vaulted in a way not easy to describe.

> At one moment, as we went down into the furrow, green waves curled and
> arched themselves above me; then in an instant I was flung up into the
> air and could look down on the heads of the rowers, as if we were
> sitting on a ladder, or out across a forest of white crests to the
> black cliff of Inishmaan.

> The men seemed excited and uneasy, and I thought for a moment that we
> were likely to be swamped. In a little while, however I realised the
> capacity of the curagh to raise its head among the waves, and the
> motion became strangely exhilarating. Even, I thought, if we were
> dropped into the blue chasm of the waves, this death, with the fresh
> sea saltness in one's teeth, would be better than most deaths one is
> likely to meet.

> When we reached the other island, it was raining heavily, so that we
> could not see anything of the antiquities or people.

> For the greater part of the afternoon we sat on the tops of empty
> barrels in the public-house, talking of the destiny of Gaelic. We were
> admitted as travellers, and the shutters of the shop were closed
> behind us, letting in only a glimmer of grey light, and the tumult of
> the storm. Towards evening it cleared a little and we came home in a
> calmer sea, but with a dead head-wind that gave the rowers all they
> could do to make the passage.

>

> On calm days I often go out fishing with Michael. When we reach the
> space above the slip where the curaghs are propped, bottom upwards, on
> the limestone, he lifts the prow of the one we are going to embark in,
> and I slip underneath and set the centre of the foremost seat upon my
> neck. Then he crawls under the stern and stands up with the last seat
> upon his shoulders. We start for the sea. The long prow bends before
> me so that I see nothing but a few yards of shingle at my feet. A
> quivering pain runs from the top of my spine to the sharp stones that
> seem to pass through my pampooties, and grate upon my ankles. We
> stagger and groan beneath the weight; but at last our feet reach the
> slip, and we run down with a half-trot like the pace of bare-footed
> children.

> A yard from the sea we stop and lower the curagh to the right. It must
> be brought down gently--a difficult task for our strained and aching
> muscles--and sometimes as the gunnel reaches the slip I lose my
> balance and roll in among the seats.

> Yesterday we went out in the curagh that had been damaged on the day
> of my visit to Kilronan, and as we were putting in the oars the
> freshly-tarred patch stuck to the slip which was heated with the
> sunshine. We carried up water in the bailer--the 'supeen,' a shallow
> wooden vessel like a soup-plate--and with infinite pains we got free
> and rode away. In a few minutes, however, I found the water spouting
> up at my feet.

> The patch had been misplaced, and this time we had no sacking. Michael
> borrowed my pocket scissors, and with admirable rapidity cut a square
> of flannel from the tail of his shirt and squeezed it into the hole,
> making it fast with a splint which he hacked from one of the oars.

> During our excitement the tide had carried us to the brink of the
> rocks, and I admired again the dexterity with which he got his oars
> into the water and turned us out as we were mounting on a wave that
> would have hurled us to destruction.

> With the injury to our curagh we did not go far from the shore. After
> a while I took a long spell at the oars, and gained a certain
> dexterity, though they are not easy to manage. The handles overlap by
> about six inches--in order to gain leverage, as the curagh is
> narrow--and at first it was almost impossible to avoid striking the
> upper oar against one's knuckles. The oars are rough and square,
> except at the ends, so one cannot do so with impunity. Again, a curagh
> with two light people in it floats on the water like a nut-shell, and
> the slightest inequality in the stroke throws the prow round at least
> a right angle from its course. In the first half-hour I found myself
> more than once moving towards the point I had come from, greatly to
> Michael's satisfaction.

> This morning we were out again near the pier on the north side of the
> island. As we paddled slowly with the tide, trolling for pollock,
> several curaghs, weighed to the gunnel with kelp, passed us on their
> way to Kilronan.

> An old woman, rolled in red petticoats, was sitting on a ledge of rock
> that runs into the sea at the point where the curaghs were passing
> from the south, hailing them in quavering Gaelic, and asking for a
> passage to Kilronan.

> The first one that came round without a cargo turned in from some
> distance and took her away.

> The morning had none of the supernatural beauty that comes over the
> island so often in rainy weather, so we basked in the vague enjoyment
> of the sunshine, looking down at the wild luxuriance of the vegetation
> beneath the sea, which contrasts strangely with the nakedness above
> it.

> Some dreams I have had in this cottage seem to give strength to the
> opinion that there is a psychic memory attached to certain
> neighbourhoods.

> Last night, after walking in a dream among buildings with strangely
> intense light on them, I heard a faint rhythm of music beginning far
> away on some stringed instrument.

> It came closer to me, gradually increasing in quickness and volume
> with an irresistibly definite progression. When it was quite near the
> sound began to move in my nerves and blood, and to urge me to dance
> with them.

> I knew that if I yielded I would be carried away to some moment of
> terrible agony, so I struggled to remain quiet, holding my knees
> together with my hands.

> The music increased continually, sounding like the strings of harps,
> tuned to a forgotten scale, and having a resonance as searching as the
> strings of the cello.

> Then the luring excitement became more powerful than my will, and my
> limbs moved in spite of me.

> In a moment I was swept away in a whirlwind of notes. My breath and my
> thoughts and every impulse of my body, became a form of the dance,
> till I could not distinguish between the instruments and the rhythm
> and my own person or consciousness.

> For a while it seemed an excitement that was filled with joy, then it
> grew into an ecstasy where all existence was lost in a vortex of
> movement. I could not think there had ever been a life beyond the
> whirling of the dance.

> Then with a shock the ecstasy turned to an agony and rage. I Struggled
> to free myself, but seemed only to increase the passion of the steps I
> moved to. When I shrieked I could only echo the notes of the rhythm.

> At last with a moment of uncontrollable frenzy I broke back to
> consciousness and awoke.

> I dragged myself trembling to the window of the cottage and looked
> out. The moon was glittering across the bay, and there was no sound
> anywhere on the island.

>  

>  

> I am leaving in two days, and old Pat Dirane has bidden me goodbye. He
> met me in the village this morning and took me into 'his little tint,'
> a miserable hovel where he spends the night.

> I sat for a long time on his threshold, while he leaned on a stool
> behind me, near his bed, and told me the last story I shall have from
> him--a rude anecdote not worth recording. Then he told me with careful
> emphasis how he had wandered when he was a young man, and lived in a
> fine college, teaching Irish to the young priests!

> They say on the island that he can tell as many lies as four men:
> perhaps the stories he has learned have strengthened his imagination.
> When I stood up in the doorway to give him God's blessing, he leaned
> over on the straw that forms his bed, and shed tears. Then he turned
> to me again, lifting up one trembling hand, with the mitten worn to a
> hole on the palm, from the rubbing of his crutch.

> 'I'll not see you again,' he said, with tears trickling on his face,
> 'and you're a kindly man. When you come back next year I won't be in
> it. I won't live beyond the winter. But listen now to what I'm telling
> you; let you put insurance on me in the city of Dublin, and it's five
> hundred pounds you'll get on my burial.'

> This evening, my last in the island, is also the evening of the
> 'Pattern'--a festival something like 'Pardons' of Brittany.

> I waited especially to see it, but a piper who was expected did not
> come, and there was no amusement. A few friends and relations came
> over from the other island and stood about the public-house in their
> best clothes, but without music dancing was impossible.

> I believe on some occasions when the piper is present there is a fine
> day of dancing and excitement, but the Galway piper is getting old,
> and is not easily induced to undertake the voyage.

> Last night, St. John's Eve, the fires were lighted and boys ran about
> with pieces of the burning turf, though I could not find out if the
> idea of lighting the house fires from the bonfires is still found on
> the island.

> I have come out of an hotel full of tourists and commercial travelers,

>  

> One of my island friends has written to me:--

> DEAR JOHN SYNGE,--I am for a long time expecting a letter from you and
> I think you are forgetting this island altogether.

> Mr. - died a long time ago on the big island and his boat was on
> anchor in the harbour and the wind blew her to Black Head and broke
> her up after his death.

> Tell me are you learning Irish since you went. We have a branch of the
> Gaelic League here now and the people is going on well with the Irish
> and reading.

> I will write the next letter in Irish to you. Tell me will you come to
> see us next year and if you will you'll write a letter before you. All
> your loving friends is well in health
>
> .--Mise do chara go huan.

> Another boy I sent some baits to has written to me also, beginning his
> letter in Irish and ending it in English:--DEAR JOHN,--I got your
> letter four days ago, and there was pride and joy on me because it was
> written in Irish, and a fine, good, pleasant letter it was. The baits
> you sent are very good, but I lost two of them and half my line. A big
> fish came and caught the bait, and the line was bad and half of the
> line and the baits went away. My sister has come back from America,
> but I'm thinking it won't be long till she goes away again, for it is
> lonesome and poor she finds the island now.--I am your friend ...

> Write soon and let you write in Irish, if you don't I won't look on
> it.
