# Introduction

> In 1897, or thereabouts, as Mr. Yeats said in his interesting
> introduction to "The Well of the Saints," John Synge was eking out a
> scanty subsistence in Paris, endeavouring to support himself by
> literature, with no very definite idea as to his aims, but full of
> suppressed vitality awaiting an adequate outlet for expression. It was
> then his ambition, native Irishman though he was, to become a
> competent critic of French literature, from the French point of view.
> In this somewhat hazy state of mind, Mr. Yeats found him, and,
> according to his story; persuaded him to abandon his immediate and
> somewhat unprofitable critical purpose, and to turn to account the
> creative impulse, which had hitherto been lying dormant within him.
> The poet himself was fresh from a trip to the Aran Islands, and the
> rude but healthy atmosphere of them and of their people had taken
> possession of a nature ever keen to realise and appropriate new
> sensations, particularly those which carried with them a deep and
> noble spiritual import. How magnetic their appeal to the stranger must
> be was never more fully illustrated than in the intensity of the
> impression which Mr. Yeats had carried away with him from the islands
> and communicated to Synge,--though the result, as the poet tells me,
> of but a single day's stay on Aranmor.

> Here then was a new motive set before Synge, a new direction for his
> literary energies, and one wherein he repudiated the art of the
> decadents, based as it was on the complicated experience and
> adjustment of modern life, for a return to nature as fresh and sincere
> in its courage and originality as the previous return had been of
> Coleridge and Wordsworth to the simple standard of truth and beauty.
> On this motive he acted, and in 1898 we find him, for the first time,
> in the Aran islands.

> Picture this later Heine settling down in these wild and desolate
> islands, adapting himself to simpler and ruder conditions of life,
> taking the people as he found them, and yet somehow, despite the
> wandering spirit that possessed him, succeeding tolerably well in
> domesticating himself, so that we find him rocking the baby's cradle
> or joining eagerly and naturally in the story-telling circles of an
> evening by the flickering firelight.

> That he made himself at home and was as well-liked by the people with
> whom he stopped as one of themselves is evidenced by the kindly
> memories which many of them who have since emigrated to America have
> treasured up of his presence among them and the quality of his
> personal magnetism. That he was a strange man they felt, as one of
> them has confessed to me; but that he was likable and that he became
> known throughout the islands as the man who was staying at Patrick
> McDonagh's, is clear from the tone in which those Aran men and women
> whom I have met speak of him.

> Remember that to them he was simply a strange but kindly young man who
> was eager to learn all the Irish that they could teach him, and was
> fond of picking up strange stories of life in the islands from those
> who were prepared to tell them to him. And then remember also how many
> philologists and young poets and dramatists flocked to the islands,
> and especially to the home of Patrick McDonagh on the middle island of
> Inishmaan. Would it have been strange if among all of these, most of
> whom doubtless consciously told of their mission, the humble name of
> John Synge should have been all but forgotten? Again, he did not stay
> at Mr. McDonagh's cottage only. At first he went to the inn on
> Inishmore, the northern and largest island of the three. From
> Concannon's at The Seven Churches, he went over to Inishmaan realising
> that there, and there only, could he find the complete, whole-hearted
> life and temperament with which he sought to surround himself.

> It was in the McDonagh home that he found himself at last. Here he
> lived life as he had never lived it before, and the fruit of his
> experience is told in the pages of this book. It is to Inishmaan that
> we owe his two great tragedies. The stories were here told to him
> which formed the germs of "Riders to the Sea" and "In the Shadow of
> the Glen."

> I have met and talked with men and women who came from each of the
> three islands, and though Synge stopped elsewhere than the places I
> have mentioned,--at Thomas Connelly's, for example, on Inishmaan, and
> at Michael Powell's on Inishere, the southernmost island--all
> associate him with the household in which he was truly happy, the
> household of Patrick McDonagh on Inishmaan. It is of this family that
> he has most to tell in the following pages, and it is from the lips of
> one of Patrick McDonagh's sons that I have been told of those whose
> names figure so often in this book.

> The psychological situation in which he and others who have come to
> America after him found themselves in reading these pages for the
> first time must have been a rare one, for therein they found depicted
> the lives of relatives and friends whom they have not seen for many
> years, and in at least one case I have met with a man who figured
> personally in the little volume. One and all, they agree that John
> Synge has reflected faithfully and sympathetically the life which he
> saw, and, though once or twice Mr. McDonagh has called my attention to
> a story or incident which was not familiar to him and whose truth he
> was therefore inclined to question, it is quite clear that the
> dramatist was keen enough to discard such stories as might have been
> told him in an irresponsible mood. The only criticism that I have
> heard expressed was that Synge might have written a better book if he
> had told more about the sea and the birds and the storms, and less of
> the people, who, in their very quality of humanity, are slow to
> recognise the romantic beauty with which they are clothed in the eyes
> of strangers keen to feel and express life's spiritual values.

> The old story-teller whom Synge met on his first visit to the
> islands--a visit, by the way, which lasted only a month or six
> weeks,--is vividly remembered by the people whom I have met, as Pat
> Doran, the man who "could tell more lies in a day than four of us
> could in a month," and Synge's picture revived many old memories in
> their minds. That Doran had a sharply outlined personality is clear
> from the fact that Miss Costello, the daughter of the cess-collector
> of the islands, who comes from Kilronan on Inishmore, and who has told
> me much about the people, remembers him distinctly, though he was a
> native of Inishmaan and too infirm to leave the island at that time.

> "Michael," the boy who taught Synge Irish, is the son of Patrick
> McDonagh, and his real name is Martin. He has married and settled down
> on the island, though his elder brother has come to America. His
> brother remembers Synge well, and often taught him also. His wife is
> from Inishere, but does not remember Synge.

> These people have memories of many another who has gone to the islands
> in the past,--of John MacNeill and Stephen Barrett, well known Irish
> scholars and mighty fishermen,--of Father Eugene O'Growney, whose
> Irish text-books have become classic and circulate wherever Irish is
> spoken or studied,--of Lady Gregory, who came many times, endearing
> herself to the people by her simple kindliness and companionship,--of
> Finck, the German who has given us the only dictionary and grammar
> that we have of the Aran dialect,--and of Pedersen and Jeremiah
> Curtin,--while older memories of Kilronan folk go back to the days of
> Sir William Wilde and Petrie.

> The picture they draw of these men posted at the door of the cottage
> with notebook and pencil ready to dart out when a stranger passed and
> ask him the word in Irish for "bed" or "stone" or "mackerel" sheds a
> bright light on the way that Synge learnt his Gaelic, and it betokens
> a high quality of persevering endeavour that under these circumstances
> he should have mastered the idiom perfectly, and that he has bended it
> and moulded it to his uses in such a wonderful creative way.

> That people have not been slow to learn of these islands and their
> charm is instanced by the fact that Mr. McDonagh has been compelled to
> add rooms on to his cottage, and that even now people have to wait
> their turn to come and stay with the family who are, after all,
> responsible in a very direct manner for the stimulus which Synge
> translated by genius into the creative work of his plays.

> Yet with all the glamour of romance that Synge and others have cast
> over these islands, the people who have come to America express no
> desire to return permanently to their fatherland. "I'd like to be
> going back and seeing the old lady, and the islands, too, especially
> after reading this book. But I'm thinking two or three weeks would be
> enough, unless I was a rich man, and then maybe I'd like to stay for a
> year." Such is the feeling they express, and indeed it is a hard life
> they have escaped. "The wet is our glory," one man said. "We are in it
> all day, and then at night we can tumble into a feather bed so deep
> you can't see yourself." Doctors are scorned as is natural by a people
> whose life is one of continual struggle and danger. 'We send for the
> priest before the doctor if a man has a pain in his heart."

> And yet though this life of theirs has begot a stern tradition, so
> stern that the tale told in "Riders to the Sea" seems no strange or
> unusual happening to them, none the less, for all that, the family tie
> is deep and tender. When I told of my wish to go to these islands and
> to bring from America the messages of all who had left their homes in
> the old country so many years before, one said in a tone of simple
> beauty, "I'm thinking when the old lady hears that you come from her
> son, she sure will have a kiss of you first of all."

> And perhaps the pleasantest outcome of all that Synge has written in
> this little book about the Aran Islands is to rekindle in the hearts
> ot those who have left their homes the old memories of pleasant though
> arduous years amid their kin in the far-off isles of Aran, those isles
> from which on a clear and sunny morning, you may see, as it was given
> to Synge to see, far off on the horizon the Land of Heart's Desire.
