### CHAPTER III

### WHO WERE THE "ANCIENT BRITONS"?

But, before proceeding to recount the myths of the "Ancient Britons", it
will be well to decide what people, exactly, we mean by that loose but
convenient phrase. We have, all of us, vague ideas of Ancient Britons,
recollected, doubtless, from our school-books. There we saw their
pictures as, painted with woad, they paddled coracles, or drove scythed
chariots through legions of astonished Romans. Their Druids,
white-bearded and wearing long, white robes, cut the mistletoe with a
golden sickle at the time of the full moon, or, less innocently
employed, made bonfires of human beings shut up in gigantic figures of
wicker-work.

Such picturesque details were little short of the sum-total, not only of
our own knowledge of the subject, but also of that of our teachers.
Practically all their information concerning the ancient inhabit-ants of
Britain was taken from the Commentaries of Julius Caesar. So far as it
went, it was no doubt correct; but it did not go far. Caesar's interest
in our British ancestors was that of a general who was his own
war-correspondent rather than that of an exhaustive and painstaking
scientist. It has been reserved for modern archæologists, philologists,
and

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

ethnologists to give us a fuller account of the Ancient Britons.

The inhabitants of our islands previous to the Roman invasion are
generally described as "Celts". But they must have been largely a mixed
race; and the people with whom they mingled must have modified to
some--and perhaps to a large--extent their physique, their customs, and
their language.

Speculation has run somewhat wild over the question of the composition
of the Early Britons. But out of the clash of rival theories there
emerges one--and one only--which may be considered as scientifically
established. We have certain proof of two distinct human stocks in the
British Islands at the time of the Roman Conquest; and so great an
authority as Professor Huxley has given his opinion that there is no
evidence of any others. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

The earliest of these two races would seem to have inhabited our islands
from the most ancient times, and may, for our purpose, be described as
aboriginal. It was the people that built the "long barrows"; and which
is variously called by ethnologists the Iberian, Mediterranean, Berber,
Basque, Silurian, or Euskarian race. In physique it was short, swarthy,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, and long-skulled; its language belonged to the
class called "Hamitic", the surviving types of which are found among the
Gallas, Abyssinians, Berbers, and other North African tribes; and it
seems to have come originally from some part either of Eastern,
Northern, or Central Africa. Spreading thence, it was

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

probably the first people to inhabit the Valley of the Nile, and it sent
offshoots into Syria and Asia Minor. The earliest Hellenes found it in
Greece under the name of "Pelasgoi"; the earliest Latins in Italy, as
the "Etruscans"; and the Hebrews in Palestine, as the "Hittites". It
spread northward through Europe as far as the Baltic, and westward,
along the Atlas chain, to Spain, France, and our own islands. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) In many countries it reached a comparatively
high level of civilization, but in Britain its development must have
been early checked. We can discern it as an agricultural rather than a
pastoral people, still in the Stone Age, dwelling in totemistic tribes
on hills whose summits it fortified elaborately, and whose slopes it
cultivated on what is called the "terrace system", and having a
primitive culture which ethnologists think to have much resembled that
of the present hill-tribes of Southern India. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) It held our islands till the coming of the
Celts, who fought with the aborigines, dispossessed them of the more
fertile parts, subjugated them, even amalgamated with them, but
certainly never extirpated them. In the time of the Romans they were
still practically independent in South Wales. In Ireland they were long
unconquered, and are found as allies rather than serfs of the Gaels,
ruling their own provinces, and preserving their own customs and
religion. Nor, in spite of all the successive invasions of Great Britain
and Ireland,

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

are they yet extinct, or so merged as to have lost their type, which is
still the predominant one in many parts of the west both of Britain and
Ireland, and is believed by some ethnologists to be generally upon the
increase all over England.

The second of the two races was the exact opposite to the first. It was
the tall, fair, light-haired, blue- or gray-eyed, broad-headed people
called, popularly, the "Celts", who belonged in speech to the "Aryan"
family, their language finding its affinities in Latin, Greek, Teutonic,
Slavic, the Zend of Ancient Persia, and the Sanscrit of Ancient India.
Its original home was probably somewhere in Central Europe, along the
course of the upper Danube, or in the region of the Alps. The "round
barrows" in which it buried its dead, or deposited their burnt ashes,
differ in shape from the "long barrows" of the earlier race. It was in a
higher stage of culture than the "Iberians", and introduced into Britain
bronze and silver, and, perhaps, some of the more lately domesticated
animals.

Both Iberians and Celts were divided into numerous tribes, but there is
nothing to show that there was any great diversity among the former. It
is otherwise with the Celts, who were separated into two main branches
which came over at different times. The earliest were the Goidels, or
Gaels; the second, the Brythons, or Britons. Between these two branches
there was not only a dialectical, but probably, also, a considerable
physical difference. Some anthropologists even postulate a different
shape of skull. Without necessarily admitting this,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

there is reason to suppose a difference of build and of colour of hair.
With regard to this, we have the evidence of Latin writers--of
Tacitus, <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) who tells us that the
"Caledonians" of the North differed from the Southern Britons in being
larger-limbed and redder-haired, and of Strabo, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) who described the tribes in the interior
of Britain as taller than the Gaulish colonists on the coast, with hair
less yellow and limbs more loosely knit. Equally do the classic
authorities agree in recognizing the "Silures" of South Wales as an
entirely different race from any other in Britain. The dark complexions
and curly hair of these Iberians seemed to Tacitus to prove them
immigrants from Spain. <span id="fr_13"></span>[3](#fn_13.md)

Professor Rhys also puts forward evidence to show that the Goidels and
the Brythons had already separated before they first left Gaul for our
islands. <span id="fr_14"></span>[4](#fn_14.md) He finds them as two
distinct peoples there. We do not expect so much nowadays from "the
merest school-boy" as we did in Macaulay's time, but even the modern
descendant of that paragon could probably tell us that all Gaul was
divided into three parts, one of which was inhabited by the Belgae,
another by the Aquitani, and the third by those who called themselves
Celtae, but were termed Galli by the Romans; and that they all differed
from one another in language, customs, and laws. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[5](#fn_15.md) Of these, Professor Rhys identifies the
Belgae with the Brythons, and the Celtae with the Goidels, the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

third people, the Aquitani, being non-Celtic and non-Aryan, part of the
great Hamitic-speaking Iberian stock. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) The Celtae, with their Goidelic dialect of
Celtic, which survives to-day in the Gaelic languages of Ireland,
Scotland, and the Isle of Man, were the first to come over to Britain,
pushed forward, probably, by the Belgae, who, Caesar tells us, were the
bravest of the Gauls. <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) Here they
conquered the native Iberians, driving them out of the fertile parts
into the rugged districts of the north and west. Later came the Belgae
themselves, compelled by press of population; and they, bringing better
weapons and a higher civilization, treated the Goidels as those had
treated the Iberians. Thus harried, the Goidels probably combined with
the Iberians against what was now the common foe, and became to a large
degree amalgamated with them. The result was that during the Roman
domination the British Islands were roughly divided with regard to race
as follows: The Brythons, or second Celtic race, held all Britain south
of the Tweed, with the exception of the extreme west, while the first
Celtic race, the Goidelic, had most of Ireland, as well as the Isle of
Man, Cumberland, the West Highlands, Cornwall, Devon, and North Wales.
North of the Grampians lived the Picts, who were probably more or less
Goidelicized Iberians, the aboriginal race also holding out, unmixed, in
South Wales and parts of Ireland.

It is now time to decide what, for the purposes of this book, it will be
best to call the two different

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

branches of the Celts, and their languages. With such familiar terms as
"Gael" and "Briton", "Gaelic" and "British", ready to our hands, it
seems pedantic to insist upon the more technical "Goidel" and "Brython",
"Goidelic" and "Brythonic". The difficulty is that the words "Gael" and
"Gaelic" have been so long popularly used to designate only the modern
"Goidels" of Scotland and their language, that they may create confusion
when also applied to the people and languages of Ireland and the Isle of
Mari. Similarly, the words "Briton" and "British" have come to mean, at
the present day, the people of the whole of the British Islands, though
they at first only signified the inhabitants of England, Central Wales,
the Lowlands of Scotland, and the Brythonic colony in Brittany. However,
the words "Goidel" and "Brython", with their derivatives, are so clumsy
that it will probably prove best to use the neater terms. In this
volume, therefore, the "Goidels" of Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of
Man are our "Gaels" and the "Brythons" of England and Wales are our
"Britons".

We get the earliest accounts of the life of the inhabitants of the
British Islands from two sources. The first is a foreign one, that of
the Latin writers. But the Romans only really knew the Southern Britons,
whom they describe as similar in physique and customs to the Continental
Gauls, with whom, indeed, they considered them to be identical. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) At the time they wrote, colonies of Belgae
were still

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

settling upon the coasts of Britain opposite to Gaul. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) Roman information grew scantier as it
approached the Wall, and of the Northern tribes they seem to have had
only such knowledge as they gathered through occasional warfare with
them. They describe them as entirely barbarous, naked and tattooed,
living by the chase alone, without towns, houses, or fields, without
government or family life, and regarding iron as an ornament of value,
as other, more civilized peoples regarded gold. <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) As for Ireland, it never came under their
direct observation, and we are entirely dependent upon its native
writers for information as to the manners and customs of the Gaels. It
may be considered convincing proof of the authenticity of the
descriptions of life contained in the ancient Gaelic manuscripts that
they corroborate so completely the observations of the Latin writers
upon the Britons and Gauls. Reading the two side by side, we may largely
reconstruct the common civilization of the Celts.

Roughly speaking, one may compare it with the civilization of the
Greeks, as described by Homer. <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) Both
peoples were in the tribal and pastoral stage of culture, in which the
chiefs are the great cattle-owners round whom their less wealthy fellows
gather. Both wear much the same attire, use the same kind of weapons,
and fight in the same manner--from the war-chariot, a vehicle already
obsolete even in Ireland by the first century of the Christian era.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Battles are fought
single-handed between chiefs, the ill-armed common people contributing
little to their result, and less to their history. Such chiefs are said
to be divinely descended--sons, even, of the immortal gods. Their
tremendous feats are sung by the bards, who, like the Homeric poets,
were privileged persons, inferior only to the war-lord. Ancient Greek
and Ancient Celt had very much the same conceptions of life, both as
regards this world and the next.

We may gather much detailed information of the early inhabitants of the
British Islands from our various authorities. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Their clothes, which consisted, according
to the Latin writers, of a blouse with sleeves, trousers fitting closely
round the ankles, and a shawl or cloak, fastened at the shoulder with a
brooch, were made either of thick felt or of woven cloth dyed with
various brilliant colours. The writer Diodorus tells us that they were
crossed with little squares and lines, "as though they had been
sprinkled with flowers". They were, in fact, like "tartans", and we may
believe Varro, who tells us that they "made a gaudy show". The men alone
seem to have worn hats, which were of soft felt, the women's hair being
uncovered, and tied in a knot behind. In time of battle, the men also
dispensed with any head-covering, brushing their abundant hair forward
into a thick mass, and dyeing it red with a soap made of goat's fat and
beech ashes, until they looked (says Cicero's tutor Posidonius, who
visited Britain about

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 110 B.C.) less
like human beings than wild men of the woods. Both sexes were fond of
ornaments, which took the form of gold bracelets, rings, pins, and
brooches, and of beads of amber, glass, and jet. Their knives, daggers,
spear-heads, axes, and swords were made of bronze or iron; their shields
were the same round target used by the Highlanders at the battle of
Culloden; and they seem also to have had a kind of lasso to which a
hammer-shaped ball was attached, and which they used as the Gauchos of
South America use their bola. Their war-chariots were made of wicker,
the wooden wheels being armed with sickles of bronze. These were drawn
either by two or four horses, and were large enough to hold several
persons in each. Standing in these, they rushed along the enemy's lines,
hurling darts, and driving the scythes against all who came within
reach. The Romans were much impressed by the skill of the drivers, who
"could check their horses at full speed on a steep incline, and turn
them in an instant, and could run along the pole, and stand on the yoke,
and then get back into their chariots again without a moment's
delay". <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

With these accounts of the Roman writers we may compare the picture of
the Gaelic hero, Cuchulainn, as the ancient Irish writers describe him
dressed and armed for battle. Glorified by the bard, he yet wears
essentially the same costume and equipment which the classic historians
and geographers described more soberly. "His gorgeous raiment that he
wore in great conventions"

.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

consisted of "a fair crimson tunic of five plies and fringed, with a
long pin of white silver, gold-enchased and patterned, shining as if it
had been a luminous torch which for its blazing property and brilliance
men might not endure to see. Next his skin, a body-vest of silk,
bordered and fringed all round with gold, with silver, and with white
bronze, which vest came as far as the upper edge of his russet-coloured
kilt. . . . About his neck were a hundred linklets of red gold that
flashed again, with pendants hanging from them. His head-gear was
adorned with a hundred mixed carbuncle jewels, strung." He carried "a
trusty special shield, in hue dark crimson, and in its circumference
armed with a pure white silver rim. At his left side a long and
golden-hilted sword. Beside him, in the chariot, a lengthy spear;
together with a keen, aggression-boding javelin, fitted with hurling
thong, with rivets of white bronze." <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)
Another passage of Gaelic saga describes his chariot. It was made of
fine wood, with wicker-work, moving on wheels of white bronze. It had a
high rounded frame of creaking copper, a strong curved yoke of gold, and
a pole of white silver, with mountings of white bronze. The yellow reins
were plaited, and the shafts were as hard and straight as
sword-blades. <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md)

In like manner the ancient Irish writers have made glorious the halls
and fortresses of their mythical kings. Like the palaces of Priam, of
Menelaus, and of Odysseus, they gleam with gold

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

and gems. Conchobar, <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) the legendary
King of Ulster in its golden age, had three such "houses" at Emain
Macha. Of the one called the "Red Branch", we are told that it contained
nine compartments of red yew, partitioned by walls of bronze, all
grouped around the king's private chamber, which had a ceiling of
silver, and bronze pillars adorned with gold and carbuncles. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) But the far less magnificent accounts of
the Latin writers have, no doubt, more truth in them than such lavish
pictures. They described the Britons they knew as living in villages of
bee-hive huts, roofed with fern or thatch, from which, at the approach
of an enemy, they retired to the local *dún*. This, so far from being
elaborate, merely consisted of a round or oval space fenced in with
palisades and earth-works, and situated either upon the top of a hill or
in the midst of a not easily traversable morass. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28.md) We may see the remains of such strongholds
in many parts of England--notable ones are the "castles" of Amesbury,
Avebury, and Old Sarum in Wiltshire, Saint Catherine's Hill, near
Winchester, and Saint George's Hill, in Surrey--and it is probable that,
in spite of the Celtic praisers of past days, the "palaces" of Emain
Macha and of Tara were very like them.

The Celtic customs were, like the Homeric, those of the primitive world.
All land (though it may have theoretically belonged to the chief) was
cultivated in common. This community of possessions

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

is stated by Caesar <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) to have extended
to their wives; but the imputation cannot be said to have been proved.
On the contrary, in the stories of both branches of the Celtic race,
women seem to have taken a higher place in men's estimation, and to have
enjoyed far more personal liberty, than among the Homeric Greeks. The
idea may have arisen from a misunderstanding of some of the curious
Celtic customs. Descent seems to have been traced through the maternal
rather than through the paternal line, a very un-Aryan procedure which
some believe to have been borrowed from another race. The parental
relation was still further lessened by the custom of sending children to
be brought up outside the family in which they were born, so that they
had foster-parents to whom they were as much, or even more, attached
than to their natural ones.

Their political state, mirroring their family life, was not less
primitive. There was no central tribunal. Disputes were settled within
the families in which they occurred, while, in the case of graver
injuries, the injured party or his nearest relation could kill the
culprit or exact a fine from him. As families increased in number, they
became petty tribes, often at war with one another. A defeated tribe had
to recognize the sovereignty of the head man of the conquering tribe,
and a succession of such victories exalted him into the position of a
chief of his district. But even then, though his decision was the whole
of the law, he was little more than the mouthpiece of public opinion.
