### CHAPTER XXIII

### THE GODS AS KING ARTHUR'S KNIGHTS

It is not, however, by such fragments of legend that Arthur is best
known to English readers. Not Arthur the god, but Arthur the "blameless
king", who founded the Table Round, from which he sent forth his knights
"to ride abroad redressing human wrongs", <span
id="fr_451"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) is the figure which the name conjures
up. Nor is it even from Sir Thomas Malory's Morte Darthur that this
conception comes to most of us, but from Tennyson's Idylls of the King.
But Tennyson has so modernized the ancient tradition that it retains
little of the old Arthur but the name. He tells us himself that his poem
had but very slight relation to

         . . . "that gray king, whose name, a ghost,  
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain-peak,  
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him  
Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's . . ."; <span
id="fr_452"></span>[2](#fn_452.md)

but that he merely used the legend to give a substantial form to his
ideal figure of the perfect English gentleman--a title to which the
original Arthur could scarcely have laid claim. Still less does there
remain in it the least trace of anything that could suggest mythology.

As much as this, however, might be said of

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Malory's book. We
may be fairly certain that the good Sir Thomas had no idea that the
personages of whom he wrote had ever been anything different from the
Christian knights which they had become in the late French romances from
which he compiled his own fifteenth-century work. The old gods had been,
from time to time, very completely euhemerized. The characters of the
"Four Branches of the Mabinogi" are still recognizable as divine beings.
In the later Welsh stories, however, their divinity merely hangs about
them in shreds and tatters, and the first Norman adapters of these
stories made them still more definitely human. By the time Malory came
to build up his Morte Darthur from the foreign romances, they had
altered so much that the shapes and deeds of gods could only be
recognized under their mediæval knightly disguises by those who had
known them in their ancient forms.

We have chosen Malory's Morte Darthur, as almost the sole representative
of Arthurian literature later than the Welsh poems and prose stories,
for three reasons. Firstly, because it is the English Arthurian romance
*par excellence* from which all later English authors, including
Tennyson, have drawn their material. Secondly, because the mass of
foreign literature dealing with the subject of Arthur is in itself a
life-study, and could not by any possibility be compressed within the
limits of a chapter. Thirdly, because Malory's fine judgment caused him
to choose the best and most typical foreign tales to weave into his own
romance; and hence it is that we find most of our old British gods--both

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

those of the earlier cycle and those of the system connected with
Arthur--striding disguised through his pages.

Curiously enough, Sir Edward Strachey, in his preface to the "Globe"
edition of Caxton's Morte Darthur, uses almost the same image to
describe Malory's prose-poem that Matthew Arnold handled with such
effect, in his *Study of Celtic Literature*, to point out the real
nature of the Mabinogion. "Malory", he says, "has built a great,
rambling, mediæval castle, the walls of which enclose rude and even
ruinous work of earlier times." How rude and how ruinous these relics
were Malory doubtless had not the least idea, for he has completely
jumbled the ancient mythology. Not only do gods of the older and newer
order appear together, but the same deities, under very often only
slightly varying names, come up again and again as totally different
characters.

Take, for example, the ancient deity of death and Hades. As King
Brandegore, or Brandegoris (Brân of Gower), he brings five thousand
mounted men to oppose King Arthur; <span id="fr_453"></span>[1](#fn_453.md)
but, as Sir Brandel, or Brandiles (Brân of Gwales <span
id="fr_454"></span>[2](#fn_454).md), he is a valiant Knight of the Round
Table, who dies fighting in Arthur's service. <span
id="fr_455"></span>[3](#fn_455.md) Again, under his name of Uther
Pen-dragon (Uther Ben), he is Arthur's father; <span
id="fr_456"></span>[4](#fn_456.md) though as King Ban of Benwyk (the
"Square Enclosure", doubtless the same as Taliesin's *Caer Pedryvan* and

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Malory's
*Carbonek*), he is a foreign monarch, who is Arthur's ally. <span
id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) Yet again, as the father of Guinevere,
Ogyrvran has become Leodegrance. <span id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_458.md)
As King Uriens, or Urience, of Gore (Gower), he marries one of Arthur's
sisters, <span id="fr_459"></span>[3](#fn_459.md) fights against him, but
finally tenders his submission, and is enrolled among his knights. <span
id="fr_460"></span>[4](#fn_460.md) Urien may also be identified in the
Morte Darthur as King Rience, or Ryons, of North Wales, <span
id="fr_461"></span>[5](#fn_461.md) and as King Nentres of Garloth; <span
id="fr_462"></span>[6](#fn_462.md) while, to crown the varied disguises of
this Proteus of British gods, he appears in an isolated episode as
Balan, who fights with his brother Balin until they kill one
another. <span id="fr_463"></span>[7](#fn_463.md)

One may generally tell the divinities of the underworld in these
romances by their connection, not with the settled and civilized parts
of England, but with the wild and remote north and west, and the still
wilder and remoter islands. Just as Brân and Urien are kings of Gower,
so Arawn, under the corruptions of his name into "Anguish" and
"Anguissance", is made King of Scotland or Ireland, both countries
having been probably confounded, as the same land of the Scotti, or
Gaels. <span id="fr_464"></span>[8](#fn_464.md) Pwyll, Head of Annwn, we
likewise discover under two disguises. As Pelles, "King of the Foreign
Country" <span id="fr_465"></span>[9](#fn_465.md) and Keeper of the Holy
Grail, he is a personage of great mythological significance, albeit the
real nature of him and his surroundings has been overlaid with a
Christian veneer as foreign to the

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

original of Pelles as his own kingdom was to Arthur's knights. The Chief
of Hades figures as a "cousin nigh unto Joseph of Arimathie", <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_466.md) who, "while he might ride supported much
Christendom, and holy church". <span id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_467.md) He
is represented as the father of Elayne (Elen <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_468).md), whom he gives in marriage to Sir
Launcelot, bestowing upon the couple a residence called "Castle
Bliant", <span id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_469.md) the name of which, there
is good evidence to show, is connected with that of Pwyll's vassal
called Teirnyon Twryf Vliant in the first of the Mabinogi. <span
id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_470.md) Under his other name of "Sir
Pelleas"--the hero of Tennyson's *Idyll of Pelleas and Ettarre*--the
primitive myth of Pwyll is touched at a different point. After his
unfortunate love-passage with Ettarre (or Ettard, as Malory calls her),
Pelleas is represented as marrying Nimue, <span
id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_471.md) whose original name, which was Rhiannon,
reached this form, as well as that of "Vivien", through a series of
miscopyings of successive scribes. <span id="fr_472"></span>[7](#fn_472.md)

With Pelles, or Pelleas, is associated a King Pellean, or Pellam, his
son, and, equally with him, the Keeper of the Grail, who can be no other
than Pryderi. <span id="fr_473"></span>[8](#fn_473.md) Like that deity in
the Mabinogi of Mâth, he is defeated by one of the gods of light. The
dealer of the blow, however, is not Arthur, as successor to Gwydion, but
Balin, the Gallo-British sun-god Belinus. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[9](#fn_474.md)

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

Another dark deity, Gwyn son of Nudd, we discover under all of his three
titles. Called variously "Sir Gwinas", <span
id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) "Sir Guynas", <span
id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) and "Sir Gwenbaus" <span
id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_477) by Malory, the Welsh Gwynwas (or Gwyn.md)
is altogether on Arthur's side. The Cornish Melwas, split into two
different knights, divides his allegiance. As Sir Melias, <span
id="fr_478"></span>[4](#fn_478.md) or Meleaus, <span
id="fr_479"></span>[5](#fn_479) de Lile ("of the Isle".md), he is a Knight
of the Round Table, though, on the quarrel between Arthur and Launcelot,
he sides with the knight against the king. But as Sir Meliagraunce, or
Meliagaunce, it is he who, as in the older myth, captures Queen
Guinevere and carries her off to his castle. <span
id="fr_480"></span>[6](#fn_480.md) Under his Somerset name of Avallon, or
Avallach, he is connected with the episode of the Grail. King
Evelake <span id="fr_481"></span>[7](#fn_481.md) is a Saracen ruler who was
converted by Joseph of Arimathea, and brought by him to Britain. In his
convert's enthusiasm, he attempted the quest of the holy vessel, but was
not allowed to succeed. <span id="fr_482"></span>[8](#fn_482.md) As a
consolation, however, it was divinely promised him that he should not
die until he had seen a knight of his blood in the ninth degree who
should achieve it. This was done by Sir Percivale, King Evelake being
then three hundred years old. <span id="fr_483"></span>[9](#fn_483.md)

Turning from deities of darkness to deities of light, we find the
sky-god figuring largely in the Morte Darthur. The Lludd of the earlier
mythology is Malory's King Loth, or Lot, of Orkney, <span
id="fr_484"></span>[10](#fn_484.md)

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

through an intrigue with whose wife Arthur becomes the father of Sir
Mordred. Lot's wife was the mother also of Sir Gawain, whose birth
Malory does not, however, attribute to Arthur, though such must have
been the original form of the myth. <span
id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_485.md) Sir Gawain, of the Arthurian legend, is
the Gwalchmei of the Welsh stories, the successor of the still earlier
Lieu Llaw Gyffes, just as Sir Mordred--the Welsh Medrawt--corresponds to
Lieu's brother Dylan. As Sir Mordred retains the dark character of
Medrawt, so Sir Gawain, even in Malory, <span
id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_486.md) shows the attributes of a solar deity.
We are told that his strength increased gradually from dawn till high
noon, and then as gradually decreased again--a piece of pagan symbolism
which forms a good example of the appositeness of Sir Edward Strachey's
figure; for it stands out of the mediæval narrative like an ancient
brick in some more modern building.

The Zeus of the later cycle, Emrys or Myrddin, appears in the Morte
Darthur under both his names. The word "Emrys" becomes "Bors", and King
Bors of Gaul is made a brother of King Ban of Benwyck <span
id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_487.md)--that is, Brân of the Square Enclosure,
the ubiquitous underworld god. Myrddin we meet under no such disguise.
The ever-popular Merlin still retains intact the attributes of the
sky-god. He remains above, and apart from all the knights, higher even
in some respects than King Arthur, to whom he stands in much the same
position as Mâth does to Gwydion in the Mabinogi. <span

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mâth, he is an
enchanter, and, like Mâth, too, who could hear everything said in the
world, in however low a tone, if only the wind met it, he is practically
omniscient. The account of his final disappearance, as told in the Morte
Darthur, is only a re-embellishment of the original story, the
nature-myth giving place to what novelists call "a feminine interest".
Everyone knows how the great magician fell into a dotage upon the "lady
of the lake" whom Malory calls "Nimue", and Tennyson "Vivien"--both
names being that of "Rhiannon" in disguise. "Merlin would let her have
no rest, but always he would be with her . . . and she was ever passing
weary of him, and fain would have been delivered of him, for she was
afeard of him because he was a devil's son, and she could not put him
away by no means. And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her
in a rock whereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment, that
went under a great stone. So, by her subtle working, she made Merlin to
go under that stone to let her wit of the marvels there, but she wrought
so there for him that he never came out for all the craft that he could
do. And so she departed and left Merlin." <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md)

Merlin's living grave is still to be seen at the end of the *Val des
Fées*, in the forest of Brécilien, in Brittany. The tomb of stone is
certainly but a prosaic equivalent for the tower of woven air in which
the heaven-god went to his rest. Still, it is not quite so unpoetic as
the leather sack in which

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rhiannon, the
original of Nimue, caught and imprisoned Gwawl, the earlier Merlin, like
a badger in a bag. <span id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_490.md)

Elen, Myrddin's consort, appears in Malory as five different "Elaines".
Two of them are wives of the dark god, under his names of "King
Ban" <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_491.md) and "King Nentres". <span
id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_492.md) A third is called the daughter of King
Pellinore, a character of uncertain origin. <span
id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_493.md) But the two most famous are the ladies
who loved Sir Launcelot--"Elaine the Fair, Elaine the lovable, Elaine
the lily maid of Astolat", <span id="fr_494"></span>[5](#fn_494.md) and the
luckier and less scrupulous Elaine, daughter of King Pelles, and mother
of Sir Launcelot's son, Galahad. <span id="fr_495"></span>[6](#fn_495.md)

But it is time, now that the most important figures of British mythology
have been shown under their knightly disguises, and their place in
Arthurian legend indicated, to pass on to some account of the real
subject-matter of Sir Thomas Malory's romance. Externally, it is the
history of an Arthur, King of Britain, whom most people of Malory's time
considered as eminently a historical character. Around this central
narrative of Arthur's reign and deeds are grouped, in the form of
episodes, the personal exploits of the knights believed to have
supported him by forming a kind of household guard. But, with the
exception of a little magnified and distorted legendary history, the
whole cycle of romance may

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

be ultimately resolved into a few myths, not only retold, but recombined
in several forms by their various tellers. The Norman adapters of the
*Matière de Bretagne* found the British mythology already in process of
transformation, some of the gods having dwindled into human warriors,
and others into hardly less human druids and magicians. Under their
hands the British warriors became Norman knights, who did their deeds of
prowess in the tilt-yard, and found their inspiration in the fantastic
chivalry popularized by the Trouveres, while the druids put off their
still somewhat barbaric druidism for the more conventional magic of the
Latin races. More than this, as soon as the real sequence and *raison
d’être* of the tales had been lost sight of, their adapters used a free
hand in reweaving them. Most of the romancers had their favourite
characters whom they made the central figure in their stories. Sir
Gawain, Sir Percival, Sir Tristrem, and Sir Owain (all of them probably
once local British sun-gods) appear as the most important personages of
the romances called after their names, stories of the doughty deeds of
christened knights who had little left about them either of Briton or of
pagan.

It is only the labours of the modern scholar that can bring back to us,
at this late date, things long forgotten when Malory's book was issued
from Caxton's press. But oblivion is not annihilation, and Professor
Rhys points out to us the old myths lying embedded in their later
setting with almost the same certainty with which the geologist can

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

show us the fossils in the rock. <span id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_496.md)
Thus treated, they resolve themselves into three principal motifs,
prominent everywhere in Celtic mythology: the birth of the sun-god; the
struggle between light and darkness; and the raiding of the underworld
by friendly gods for the good of man.

The first has been already dealt with. <span
id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_497.md) It is the retelling of the story of the
origin of the sun-god in the Mabinogi of Mâth, son of Mâthonwy. For
Gwydion we now have Arthur; instead of Arianrod, the wife of the
superannuated sky-god Nwyvre, we find the wife of King Lot, the
superannuated sky-god Lludd; Lleu Llaw Gyffes rises again as Sir Gawain
(Gwalchmei), and Dylan as Sir Mordred (Medrawt); while the wise Merlin,
the Jupiter of the new system, takes the place of his wise prototype,
Mâth. Connected with this first myth is the second--the struggle between
light and darkness, of which there are several versions in the Morte
Darthur. The leading one is the rebellion of the evilly-disposed Sir
Mordred against Arthur and Sir Gawain; while, on other stages,
Balan--the dark god Brân--fights with Balin--the sun-god Belinus; and
the same Balin, or Belinus, gives an almost mortal stroke to Pellam, the
Pryderi of the older mythology.

The same myth has also a wider form, in which the battle is waged for
possession of a maiden. Thus (to seek no other instances) Gwynhwyvar was
contended for by Arthur and Medrawt, or, in an

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

earlier form of the myth, by Arthur and Gwyn. In the Morte Darthur,
Gwyn, under the corruption of his Cornish name Melwas into "Sir
Meliagraunce", still captures Guinevere, but it is no longer Arthur who
rescues her. That task, or privilege, has fallen to a new champion. It
is Sir Launcelot who follows Sir Meliagraunce, defeats and slays him,
and rescues the fair captive. <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_498.md) But
Sir Launcelot, it must be stated--probably to the surprise of those to
whom the Arthurian story without Launcelot and Queen Guinevere must seem
almost like the play of "Hamlet with Hamlet left out",--is unknown to
the original tradition. Welsh song and story are silent with regard to
him, and he is not improbably a creation of some Norman romancer who
calmly appropriated to his hero's credit deeds earlier told of other
"knights".

But the romantic treatment of these two myths by the adapters of the
*Matière de Bretagne* are of smaller interest to us at the present day
than that of the third. The attraction of the Arthurian story lies less
in the battles of Arthur or the loves of Guinevere than in the legend
that has given it its lasting popularity--the Christian romance of the
Quest of the Holy Grail. So great and various has been the inspiration
of this legend to noble works both of art and literature that it seems
almost a kind of sacrilege to trace it back, like all the rest of
Arthur's story, to a paganism which could not have even understood, much
less created, its mystical beauty. None the less is the whole story

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

directly evolved from primitive pagan myths concerning a miraculous
cauldron of fertility and inspiration.

In the later romances, the Holy Grail is a Christian relic of marvellous
potency. It had held the Paschal lamb eaten at the Last Supper; <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_499.md) and, after the death of Christ, Joseph
of Arimathea had filled it with the Saviour's blood. <span
id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_500.md) But before it received this colouring,
it had been the magic cauldron of all the Celtic mythologies--the
Dagda's "Undry" which fed all who came to it, and from which none went
away unsatisfied; <span id="fr_501"></span>[3](#fn_501.md) Brân's cauldron
of Renovation, which brought the dead back to life; <span
id="fr_502"></span>[4](#fn_502.md) the cauldron of Ogyrvran the Giant, from
which the Muses ascended; <span id="fr_503"></span>[5](#fn_503.md) the
cauldrons captured by Cuchulainn from the King of the Shadowy
City, <span id="fr_504"></span>[6](#fn_504.md) and by Arthur from the chief
of Hades; <span id="fr_505"></span>[7](#fn_505.md) as well as several other
mythic vessels of less note.

In its transition from pagan to Christian form, hardly one of the
features of the ancient myth has been really obscured. We may recount
the chief attributes, as Taliesin tells them in his "Spoiling of Annwn",
of the cauldron captured by Arthur. It was the property of Pwyll, and of
his son Pryderi, who lived in a kingdom of the other world called, among
other titles, the "Revolving Castle", the "Four-cornered Castle", the
"Castle of Revelry", the

*From the Drawing by E. Wallcousins*.  

 

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Kingly Castle",
the "Glass Castle", and the "Castle of Riches". This place was
surrounded by the sea, and in other ways made difficult of access; there
was no lack of wine there, and its happy inhabitants spent with music
and feasting an existence which neither disease nor old age could
assail. As for the cauldron, it had a rim of pearls around its edge; the
fire beneath it was kept fanned by the breaths of nine maidens; it
spoke, doubtless in words of prophetic wisdom; and it would not cook the
food of a perjurer or coward. <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_506.md) Here
we have considerable data on which to base a parallel between the pagan
cauldron and the Christian Grail.

Nor have we far to go in search of correspondences, for they are nearly
all preserved in Malory's romance. The mystic vessel was kept by King
Pelles, who is Pwyll, in a castle called "Carbonek", a name which
resolves itself, in the hands of the philologist, into *Caer bannawg*,
the "square" or "four-cornered castle"--in other words, the *Caer
Pedryvan* of Taliesin's poem. <span id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_507.md) Of
the character of the place as a "Castle of Riches" and a "Castle of
Revelry", where "bright wine was the drink of the host", we have more
than a hint in the account, twice given, <span
id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_508.md) of how, upon the appearance of the
Grail--borne, it should be noticed, by a maiden or angel--the hall was
filled with good odours, and every knight found on the table all the
kinds of meat and drink he could imagine as most

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

desirable. It could not be seen by sinners, <span
id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_509.md) a Christian refinement of the savage
idea of a pot that would not cook a coward's food; but the sight of it
alone would cure of wounds and sickness those who approached it
faithfully and humbly, <span id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_510.md) and in its
presence neither old age nor sickness could oppress them. <span
id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_511.md) And, though in Malory we find no
reference either to the spot having been surrounded by water, or to the
castle as a "revolving" one, we have only to turn from the Morte Darthur
to the romance entitled the *Seint Greal* to discover both. Gwalchmei,
going to the castle of King Peleur (Pryderi), finds it encircled by a
great water, while Peredur, approaching the same place, sees it turning
with greater speed than the swiftest wind. Moreover, archers on the
walls shoot so vigorously that no armour can resist their shafts, which
explains how it happened that, of those that went with Arthur, "except
seven, none returned from Caer Sidi". <span
id="fr_512"></span>[4](#fn_512.md)

It is noticeable that Arthur himself never attempts the quest of the
Grail, though it was he who had achieved its pagan original. We find in
Malory four competitors for the mantle of Arthur--Sir Pelleas, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[5](#fn_513.md) Sir Bors, Sir Percivale, and Sir
Galahad. <span id="fr_514"></span>[6](#fn_514.md) The first of these may be
put out of court at once, Sir Pelleas, who, being himself Pelles,

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

or Pwyll, the keeper of it, could have had no reason for such exertions.
At the second we may look doubtfully; for Sir Bors is no other than
Emrys, or Myrddin, <span id="fr_515"></span>[1](#fn_515.md) and, casting
back to the earlier British mythology, we do not find the sky-god
personally active in securing boons by force or craft from the
underworld. The other two have better claims--Sir Percivale and Sir
Galahad. "Sir Percivale" is the Norman-French name for Peredur, <span
id="fr_516"></span>[2](#fn_516.md) the hero of a story in the Red Book of
Hergest <span id="fr_517"></span>[3](#fn_517.md) which gives the oldest
form of a Grail quest we have. It is anterior to the Norman romances,
and forms almost a connecting-link between tales of mythology and of
chivalry. Peredur, or Sir Percivale, therefore, is the oldest, most
primitive, of Grail seekers. On the other hand, Sir Galahad is the
latest and youngest. But there is reason to believe that Galahad, in
Welsh "Gwalchaved", the "Falcon of Summer", is the same solar hero as
Gawain, in Welsh "Gwalchmei", the "Falcon of May". <span
id="fr_518"></span>[4](#fn_518.md) Both are made, in the story of "Kulhwch
and Olwen", sons of the same mother, Gwyar. Sir Gawain himself is, in
one Arthurian romance, the achiever of the Grail. <span
id="fr_519"></span>[5](#fn_519.md) It is needless to attempt to choose
between these two. Both have the attributes of sun-gods. Gwalchmei, the
successor of Lleu Llaw Gyffes, and Peredur Paladrhir, that is to say,
the "Spearman with the Long

What is important is that the quest of the Grail, once the chief
treasure of Hades, is still accomplished by one who takes in later
legend the place of Lleu Llaw Gyffes and Lugh Lamhfada in the earlier
British and Gaelic myths as a long-armed solar deity victorious in his
strife against the Powers of Darkness.
