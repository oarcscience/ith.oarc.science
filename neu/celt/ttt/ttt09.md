MAGIC THROUGH INTANGIBLE THINGS

 

> THE examples of belief in a man's tangible belongings as vehicles of
> black magic will have paved the way for examples of like belief about
> intangible things, as shadows, reflections, and names.

> The savage knows nothing of the action of the laws of interference of
> light or sound. The echoes of voices which the hillside flings back;
> the reflections which water casts; and the shadows which follow or
> precede, and which lengthen or shorten, a man's figure; all unite in
> supporting the theory of another self. The Basuto avoids the
> river-bank, lest, as his shadow falls on the water, a crocodile may
> seize it, and harm the owner. In Wetar Island. near Celebes.. the
> magicians profess to make a man ill by spearing or stabbing his
> shadow; the Arabs believe that if a hyena treads on a shadow, it
> deprives the man of the power of speech; and in modern Roumania the
> ancient custom of burying a victim as sacrifice to the earth-spirit
> under any new structure, has survival in the builder enticing some
> passer-by to draw near, so that his shadow is thrown on the
> foundation-stone, the belief being that he will die within the year.
> New England tribes call the soul *chermung* or shadow, and civilised
> speech indicates community of idea in the *skia* of the Greeks, the
> *manes* or *umbra* of the Romans, and the *shade* of our own language.
> But any due enlargement of this department of the subject would fill
> no small volume, since it involves the story of the origin and
> development of spiritual ideas ruling the life of man from the dawn of
> thought; and, moreover, those ideas find sufficing illustration in
> savage notions about names.

> Starting at the bottom of the scale, we have Mr. Brough Smyth's
> testimony that the Victoria black-fellows are very unwilling to tell
> their real names, and that this reluctance is due to the fear of
> putting themselves at the mercy of sorcerers. \[a\] Backhouse says
> that the Tasmanians showed great dislike to their names being
> mentioned.

> Among the Tshi-speaking tribes of West Africa, 'a man's name is always
> concealed from all but his nearest relatives, and to other persons he
> is always known by an assumed name,' a nickname, as we should say.
> \[b\] The Ewe-speaking peoples 'believe in a real and material
> connection between a man and his name, and that, by means of the name,
> injury may be done to' the man.' \[c\] Mr. Im Thurn says that,
> although the Indians of British Guiana have an intricate system of
> names, it is 'of little use in that the owners have a very strong
> objection to telling or using them, apparently on the ground that the
> name is part of the man, and that he who knows it has part of the
> owner of that name in his power. To avoid any danger of spreading
> knowledge of their names, one Indian, therefore, usually addresses
> another only according to the relationship of the caller and the
> called. But an Indian is just as unwilling to tell his proper name to
> a white man as to an Indian; and as, of course, between those two
> there is no relationship the term for which can serve as a proper
> name, the Indian asks the European to give him a name, which is
> usually written on a piece of paper by the donor, and shown by the
> Indian to any white who asks his name.' \[d\] The Indians of British
> Columbia--and the prejudice 'appears to pervade all tribes
> alike'--dislike telling their names; thus you never get a man's right
> name from himself, but they will tell each other's names without
> hesitation. \[e\] In correspondence with this, the Abipones of South
> America would nudge their neighbour to answer for them when any one
> among them was asked his name; and the natives of the Fiji Islands
> would get any third party who might be present to answer as to their
> names. \[f\] An Indian asked Dr. Kane whether his wish to know his
> name arose from a desire to steal it; and the Araucanians would not
> allow their names to be told to strangers lest these should be used in
> sorcery. Among the Ojibways, husbands and wives never told each
> other's names, and children were warned that they would stop growing
> if they repeated their own names. Of the Abipones just named,
> Dobriz-hoffer reports that they would knock at his door at night, and,
> when asked who was there, would not answer for fear of letting their
> names be known to any evilly-disposed listener. A like motive probably
> explains the reluctance of which Gregor speaks in his *Folk-Lore of
> the North-East of Scotland*, when 'folk calling at a house of the
> better class on business with the master or mistress had a very strong
> dislike to tell their names to the servant who admitted them.' While
> these sheets are passing through the press, my friend Mr. W. B. Yeats
> hands me a letter from an Irish correspondent, who tells of a
> fairy-haunted old woman living in King's County. Her tormentors, whom
> she calls the 'Fairy Band of Shinrone,' come from Tipperary. They pelt
> her with invisible missiles, hurl abuse at her, and rail against her
> family, both the dead and the living, until she is driven well-nigh
> mad. And all this spite is manifested because they cannot find out her
> name, for if they could learn that, she would be in their power.
> Sometimes sarcasm or chaff is employed, and a nickname is given her to
> entrap her into telling her real name,--all which she freely talks
> about, often with fits of laughter. But the fairies trouble her most
> at night, coming in through the wall over her bed-head, which is no
> laughing matter; and then, being a good Protestant, she recites
> chapters and verses from the Bible to charm them away. And although
> she has been thus plagued for years, she still holds her own against
> the 'band of Shinrone.' Speaking in general terms on this
> name-concealment custom, Captain Bourke says that 'the name of an
> American Indian is a sacred thing, never to be divulged by the owner
> himself without due consideration. One may ask a warrior of any tribe
> to give his name, and the question will be met with either a
> point-blank refusal, or the more diplomatic evasion that he cannot
> understand what is wanted of him. The moment a friend approaches, the
> warrior first will whisper what is wanted, and the friend can tell the
> name, receiving a reciprocation of the courtesy from the inquirer.'
> \[g\] Grinnell says that 'many Blackfeet. change their names every
> season. Whenever a Blackfoot counts a new coup (i.e. some deed of
> bravery), he is entitled to a new name,' in the same way that among
> ourselves a successful general or admiral sinks his name when raised
> to the peerage. 'A Blackfoot will never tell his name if he can avoid
> it, in the belief that if he should reveal it, he would be unlucky in
> all his undertakings.' \[h\] The warriors of the Plains Tribes 'used
> to assume agnomens or battle-names, and I have known some of them who
> had enjoyed as many as four or five; but the Apache name, once
> conferred, seems to remain through life, except in the case of the
> medicine-men, who, I have always suspected, change their names on
> assuming their profession, much as a professor of learning in China is
> said to do,' \[i\] and, it may be added, as among high dignitaries of
> the church, members of ecclesiastical orders, and so forth. But of
> this more presently. The foregoing reference to names of warriors
> permits the inclusion of a story told by Fraser in his *Tour to the
> Himalayas*. \[j\] In one of the despatches intercepted during our war
> with Nepaul, Gooree Sah had sent orders to 'find out the name of the
> commander of the British army; write it upon a piece of paper: take it
> and some rice and turmeric; say the great incantation three times;
> having said it, send for some plum-tree wood, and therewith burn it.'
> There is a story in the annals of British conquest in India to the
> effect that General Lake took a city with surprisingly little
> resistance, because his name signified in the native language
> 'Crocodile,' and there was an oracle that the city would be captured
> by that reptile. Phonetic confusion explains the honours paid to

> favourite name of Krishna, the popular incarnation of Vishnu. \[k\]

> Mr. J. H. Collens, in his *Guide to Trinidad*, published in 1887,
> tells the following story--

> A doctor in a remote district had one day assembled a number of negro
> children for vaccination. In the course of his duties he came to a
> little girl, when the following conversation ensued with the mother:--

> Doctor. Are you the child's mother?

> WOMAN. Yes, sir--is me darter.

> D And what is your name?

> W. Is me name?

> D. (rather impatiently). Yes; I asked you what is your name?

> W (hesitatingly). Dey does caal me Sal.

> D. Well; Sal what?

> W (assuringly, but with a suspicious side-glance at a neighbour who is
> intently taking all in). Dey does allus caal me Sal.

> D. (getting desperate). Oh, botheration! will you tell me your proper
> name or not?

> W. (with much reluctance approaching the doctor, whispers in the
> lowest possible tone of voice). Deiphine Segard.

> D. (with intense disgust). Then why couldn't you say so?

> Mr. Collens remarks that his 'medical friend

> now bears these little passages with more equanimity, for he has
> gained experience, and knows that the reason why the woman was so
> reluctant to utter her name aloud was that she believed she had an
> enemy in the room who would take advantage of the circumstance if she
> got hoId of her true name, and would work her all manner of harm. It
> is a fact that these people (the negro population of Trinidad)
> sdmetimes actually forget the names of their near relations from
> hearing and using them so little.'

> With this group of examples chosen from widely sundered sources, and
> with the ever-growing evidence of continuity of old ideas lurking in
> the veriest trifles, it may not be so far-fetched as at first sight it
> seems, to detect traces of the avoidance-superstition in the
> game-rhyme familiar to our childhood -

> 'What is your name?  
> Pudding and tame.  
> If you ask me again I'll tell you the same.'

> Ellis says, 'It appears strange that the birth-name only, and not an
> alias, should be believed capable of carrying some of the personality
> of the bearer elsewhere, since the latter preserves the subjective
> connection just as well as the real name. But the native view seems to
> be that the alias does not really belong to the man.' This view, which
> is universal through every stage of culture, takes practical effect
> from the time that the child is born and made the subject of
> name-giving ceremonies. In civilised communities, the 'baptismal name
> is the real name, the name registered in heaven,' and this belief is
> an integral part of the general body of customs which have for their
> object the protection of the infant from maleficent agents at the
> critical period of birth. 'The ancients,' says Aubrey, 'had a solemne
> time of giving names,--the equivalent to our christening.' \[l\]
> Barbaric, Pagan, and Christian folk-lore is full of examples of the
> importance of naming and other birth-ceremonies, in the belief that
> the child's life is at the mercy of evil spirits watching the chance
> of casting spells upon it, of demons covetous to possess it, and of
> fairies eager to steal it, and leave a 'changeling' in its place. This
> last-named superstition as to theft of the newly born by the 'little
> folk' is availed of as subject of humorous incident by the writer of
> the old mystery play of the 'Shepherds' (*Secunda Pastorum*), in the
> Towneley Collection.\[m\] While all the hinds except Mak have fallen
> asleep, he steals home with a sheep, which he pops into the cradle,
> telling his wife to feign lying-in. Then he returns to his mates, and,
> shamming sleep, says that they have roused him from a dream that his
> wife has given birth to a 'yong lad,' and so makes excuse to hasten to
> her. When he is gone, the sheep is missed, whereupon the shepherds
> follow Mak home, and are bidden to 'speke soft' because of the 'seke
> woman.' They are thus put off guard, but on leaving, one of them
> remembers that no gift had been made to the child, so they return for
> that kindly office. Despite Mak's entreaties not to, disturb the sleep
> of the 'lyttle day starne,' they 'lyft up the clowtt,' and discover
> strange likeness between the babe and the 'shepe.' Both Mak and his
> wife declare this metamorphosis to be the maliceful work of fairies,
> the woman saying that the boy

> 'Was takyn with an elfe.  
> I saw it myself  
> When the clok stroke tweilf  
> Was he forshapyn' (transformed).

> 'The hour of midnight,' says Brand, 'was looked on by our forefathers
> as the season when this species of sorcery was generally performed.'

> In Ireland the belief in changelings is as strong as it was in
> pre-Christian times; both there and in Scotland the child is carefully
> watched till the rite of baptism is performed, fishermen's nets being
> sometimes spread over the curtain openings to prevent the infant being
> carried off; while in West Sussex it is considered unlucky to divulge
> a child's intended name before baptism. \[n\] This reminds us of the
> incident in the Moray story, Nicht Nought Nothing, in which the queen
> would not christen the bairn till the king came back, saying, 'We will
> just call him Nicht Nought Nothing until his father comes home.' \[o\]

> Brand says that among Danish women precaution against evil spirits
> took the form of putting garlick, bread, salt, or some steel
> instrument as amulets about the house before laying the newborn babe
> in the cradle. \[p\] Henderson \[q\] says that in Scotland 'the little
> one's safeguard is held to lie in the placing of some article of
> clothing belonging to the father near the cradle,' while in South
> China a pair of the father's trousers are put near the bedstead, and a
> word-charm pinned to them, so that all evil influences may pass into
> them instead of harming the babe, \[r\] and in New Britain a charm is
> always hung in the house to secure the child from like peril. \[s\] In
> Ruthenia it is believed that if a wizard knows a man's baptismal name
> he can transform him by a mere effort of will. Parkyns says that it is
> the custom in Abyssinia 'to conceal the real name by which a person is
> baptized, and to call him only by a sort of nickname which his mother
> gives him on leaving the church. The baptismal names in Abyssinia are
> those of saints, such as Son of St. George, Slave of the Virgin,
> Daughter of Moses, etc. Those given by the mother are generally
> expressive of maternal vanity regarding the appearance or anticipated
> merits of the child. The reason for the concealment of the Christian
> name is that the Bouda cannot harm a person whose real name he does
> not know.' Should he, however, have learned the true name of his
> victim, he adopts a method of which illustrations have been given in
> the references to sympathetic magic. 'He takes a particular kind of
> straw, and muttering something over it bends it into a circle, and
> places it under a stone The person thus doomed is taken ill at the
> very moment of the bending of the straw, and should it by accident
> snap under the operation, the result of the attack will be the death
> of the patient.' \[t\] Parkyns adds that in Abyssinia all blacksmiths
> are looked upon as wizards or Boudas. Among the many characters in
> which the devil appears is that of Wayland the Smith, the northern
> Vulcan, but perhaps the repute attaching to the Boudas has no
> connection with that conception, and may be an example of th barbaric
> belief in the magic power of iron to which allusion has been made.
> They are credited with the faculty of being able to turn themselves
> into hyenas and other wild beasts, so that few people will venture to
> molest or offend a black smith. 'In all church services in Abyssinia,
> particularly in prayers for the dead, the baptismal name must be used.
> How they manage to hid it I did not learn; possibly by confiding it
> only to the priest.' \[u\] Mr. Theodore Bent says that it is a custom
> in the Cyclades to call a child Iron or Dragon or some other such name
> before christening takes place, the object being to frighten away the
> evil spirits. Travelling east wards, we find the Hindu belief that
> when i child is born an invisible spirit is born with it and unless

> the deepest object of reverence and worship, regarded it not merely as
> the dwelling-place of spirits, but as itself a living organism. That
> has been the barbaric idea about it everywhere; and little wonder. For
> the primitive mind associates life with motion; \[aq\] and if in
> rolling stone and waving branch it sees not merely the home and haunt
> of spirit, but spirit itself, how much more so in tumbling cataract,
> swirling rapid, and tossing sea, swallowing or rejecting alike the
> victim and the offering. Birthplace of life itself, and ever life's
> necessity; mysterious fluid endowed with cleansing and healing
> qualities, the feeling that invests it can only be refined, it cannot
> perish. And we therefore think with sympathy of that 'divine honour'
> which Gildas tells us out forefathers 'paid to wells and streams'; of
> the food-bringing rivers which, in the old Celtic faith, were
> 'mothers'; of the eddy in which the water-demon lurked; of the lakes
> ruled by lonely queens; of the nymphs who were the presiding genii of
> wells. Happily, the Church treated this old phase of nature-worship
> tenderly, adapting what it could not abolish, substituting the name of
> Madonna or saint for the pagan presiding deity of the spring. Most
> reasonable therefore, is the contention that the barbaric lustrations
> re appear in the rite at Christian fonts; that the brush of the pagan
> temple sprinkles the faithful with holy water, as it still sprinkles
> with benediction the horses in the *Palio* or prize races at Siena;
> \[ar\] and that the leprous Naaman repairing to the Jordan, together

> correspondences in the children dipped in wells to be cured of
> rickets, in the dragging of lunatics through deep water to restore
> their reason, and in the cripples who travel by railway to bathe their
> limbs in the well of St. Winifred in Flintshire. The influence which
