VARIANTS OF TOM TIT TOT

 

> THERE would be only profitless monotony in printing the full texts, or
> even in giving abstracts, of the numerous variants of this story which
> have been collected. A list of these, with such comment as may
> perchance be useful to a special class of readers, is supplied in the
> Appendix. Here it suffices to remark that in all of them the plot
> centres round the discovery of the name of the maleficent actor in the
> little drama, and to give a summary of a few of the most widely spread
> stories in which, as might be expected, a certain variety of incident
> occurs. These are chosen from Scotland, Tyrol, the Basque provinces,
> and the Far East, the variants from this last containing the
> fundamental idea in an entirely different plot. To these follow a
> Welsh variant in which our joy at the defeat of the demon or witch in
> most of the stories is changed into sorrow for the fairy.

> The Scotch 'Whuppity Stoorie' tells of a man who 'gaed to a fair ae
> day,' and was never more heard of. His widow was left with a 'sookin'
> lad bairn,' and a sow that 'was soon to farra.' Going to the sty one
> day, she saw, to her distress, the sow ready 'to gi'e up the ghost,'
> and as she sat down with her bairn and 'grat sairer than ever she did
> for the loss o' her am goodman,' there came an old woman dressed in
> green, who asked what she would give her for curing the sow. Then they
> 'watted thooms' on the bargain, by which the woman promised to give
> the green fairy anything she liked, and the sow was thereupon made
> well. To the mother's dismay the fairy then said that she would have
> the bairn. 'But, said she, 'this I'll let ye to wut, I canna by the
> law we leeve on take your bairn till the third day after this day; and
> no' then, if ye can tell me my right name.' For two days the poor
> woman wandered, 'cuddlin' her bairn,' when, as she came near an old
> quarry-hole, she heard the 'burring of a lint-wheel, and a voice
> lilting a song,' and then saw the green fairy at her wheel, 'singing
> like ony precentor '--

> 'Little kens our guid dame at hame

> That Whuppity Stoorie is my name.'

> Speeding home glad-hearted, she awaited the fairy's coming; and, being
> a 'jokus woman,' pulled a long face, begging that the bairn might be
> spared and the sow taken, and when this was spurned, offering herself.
> 'The deil 's in the daft jad,' quo' the fairy, 'wha in a' the earthly
> wand wad ever meddle wi' the likes o' thee?' Then the woman threw off
> her mask of grief, and, making 'a curchie down to the ground,' quo'
> she, 'I might hae had the wit to ken that the likes o' me is na fit to
> tie the warst shoe-strings o' the heich and mighty princess, Whuppity
> Stoorie.' 'Gin a fluff o' gunpouder had come out o' the grund, it
> couldna hae gart the fairy loup heicher nor she did; syne doun she
> came again, dump on her shoe-heels, and, whurlin' round, she ran

> down the brae, scraichin' for rage, like a houlet chased wi' the
> witches.' \[a\]

> In the Tyrolese story, a count, while hunting in a forest, is suddenly
> confronted by a dwarf with fiery red eyes and a beard down to his
> knees, who rolls his eyes in fury, and tells the count that he must
> pay for trespassing on the mannikin's territory either with his life
> or the surrender of his wife. The count pleads for pardon, and the
> dwarf so far modifies his terms as to agree that if within a month the
> countess cannot find out his name, she is to be his. Then, escorting
> the count to the forest bounds where stood an ancient fir-tree, it is
> bargained that the dwarf will there await the countess, who shall have
> three guesses three times, nine in all. The month expires, and she
> then repairs to the rendezvous to make her first round of guesses,
> giving the names, 'Janne,' 'Fichte,' and 'Fohre.' The dwarf shrieks
> with merriment over her failure, and when she returns to the castle
> she enters the chapel and offers earnest prayers for help in guessing
> the right name. But the next day, when she gives the names 'Hafer,'
> 'Pleuten,' and 'Turken,' repeats the failure, and calls forth the
> dwarf's unholy glee. When she comes to the tree on the third day, he
> is not there. So she wandered from the spot till she reached a lovely
> valley, and, seeing a tiny house, went on tiptoe, and peeping in at
> the window heard the dwarf singing his name in a verse as he hopped
> gaily on the hearth. The countess hurries back to the tree in high
> spirits, and when the dwarf appears she artfully withholds the secret
> she has learned till the last chance is hers. 'Pur,' she guesses, and
> the dwarf chortles; 'Ziege,'t then he bounds in the air;
> 'Purzinigele,' she shouts derisively, and then the dwarf rolling his
> red eyes in rage, doubles his fist, and disappears for ever in the
> darkness. \[b\]

> In Basque folk-tale, a mother is beating her lazy girl, when the lord
> of a castle hard by, who is passing at the time, asks what all the
> pother is about, and is told that the girl's beauty makes her saucy
> and indolent. Then follow the usual incidents, with the exception that
> a witch, instead of a demon, comes to aid the girl, to whom the lord
> then offers marriage if she can get a certain amount of work done
> within a given time, the witch's bargain being that the girl must
> remember her name, Marie Kirikitoun, a year and a day hence. The
> wedding takes place, and as the year end draws near, sadness falls on
> the bride, despite the holding of grand festivals to gladden her
> spirits. For she had forgotten the witch's name. At one of the
> feastings an old woman knocks at the door, and when a servant tells
> her that all the high jinks are kept up to make her mistress cheerful,
> the beldame says that if the lady had seen what she had seen, her
> laughter would run free enough. So the servant bids her come in, and
> then she tells how she had seen an old witch leaping and bounding from
> one ditch to another, and singing all the time, 'Houpa, houpa, Marie
> Kirikitoun, nobody will remember my name.' Whereupon the bride became
> merry-hearted, rewarded the old woman, and told the enraged witch her
> name when she came for fulfilment of the bargain.

> In *Sagas from the Far East*, a king sends his son on travel that he
> may gain all kinds of knowledge. The prince takes, as his favourite
> companion, the son of the prime minister, who, on their return
> journey, burning with envy at the superior wisdom of his royal
> comrade, entices him into a forest and kills him. As the prince dies,
> he utters the word, 'Abaraschika.' When the murderer reaches the
> palace, he tells the sorrowing king how the prince fell sick unto
> death, and that he had time to speak only the above word. Thereupon
> the king summoned his seers and magicians, and threatened them with
> death if they did not, within seven days, interpret the meaning of
> 'Abaraschika.' That time had well-nigh expired when a student came
> beckoning to them, bidding them not despair, for, while sleeping
> beneath a tree, he had heard a bird telling his young ones not to cry
> for food, since the Khan would slay a thousand men on the morrow
> because they could not find out the meaning of 'Abaraschika.' And the
> meaning, said the bird, was this:--'My bosom friend hath enticed me
> into a thick grove, and hath taken away my life.' So the seers and
> magicians hastened to reporl what they had heard to the king, who
> thereupon put the murderer to death. \[c\]

> The Welsh story (one of several closely allied in detail) tells that
> once upon a Lime the youth. ful heir of Ystrad, on adventure bent,
> wandered by the banks of the Gwyrfai stream that issues from Quellyn's
> lake. As night fell he hid him. self by a bush near the spot where the
> 'Tywyth Teg,' or 'Fair Family' (the 'Folk of the Re\~ Coat'), held
> their revels. The moon shone in r cloudless sky, and the youth had not
> long to wait before he saw the 'little people' trool forth to the
> dance. Among these was one who straightway kindled his love, for never
> mort graceful maiden or light-footed dancer had h seen. The longer he
> watched her, the hotter grew his desire, till, making resolve to seize
> her, he 'sprang like a lion into the middle of the circle' just when
> the fairies were most enjoying the swing of the dance, and carried her
> off in hii arms to Ystrad. 'Her companions vanished like a breath in
> July as they heard the shrill voice of their sister crying for help.'
> When the youth reached home he strove by every gentle art in his power
> to make the fairy happy, and she served him well in return, being
> obdurate only in one thing. 'He could in nowise prevail on her to tell
> him her name,' and vain were all his efforts to discover it, till one
> evening, as he was driving two of his cows to the meadow, he came
> again to the spot where he had captured the fairy. He hid himself, as
> before, in the thicket, and when the troop of the Red-coated appeared,
> he heard them saying to one another that when they last came thither a
> mortal had carried off their sister Penelope.\[d\] Glad-hearted, the
> youth hurried' home and called the fairy by her name, whereupon grief
> clouded her face. Her beauty and distress moved him the more to urge
> that she who had been his faithful serving-maid would become his wife;
> and although she long refused him, she at last consented, but only on
> his promising that if ever he struck her with iron she should be free
> to leave him. For years he kept his word, but, one day, as they went
> together to catch a wild horse in the field, he threw the bridle at
> him, and by mischance struck his fairy wife with the iron bit,
> whereupon she straightway vanished. \[e\]
