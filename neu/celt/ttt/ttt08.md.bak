MAGIC THROUGH TANGIBLE THINGS

 

> THE dread of being harmed through so intangible a thing as his name,
> which haunts the savage, is the extreme and more subtle form of the
> same dread which, for a like reason, makes him adopt precautions
> against cuttings of his hair, parings of his nails, his saliva,
> excreta, and the water in which his clothes--when he wears any--are
> washed, falling under the control of the sorcerer. Miss Mary Kingsley
> says that 'the fear of nail and hair clippings getting into the hands
> of evilly disposed persons is ever present to the West African: The
> Igalwa and other tribes will allow no one but a trusted friend to do
> their hair, and bits of nails or hair are carefully burnt or thrown
> away into a river. Blond., even that from a small cut on the finger.
> or from a fit of nose-bleeding, is most carefully covered up and
> stamped out if it has fallen on the earth. Blood is the life, and life
> in Africa means a spirit, hence the liberated blood is the liberated
> spirit, and liberated spirits are always whipping into people who
> don't want them. \[a\] Crammed with Pagan superstitions, the Italian
> who is reluctant to trust a lock of his hair to another stands on the
> same plane as the barbarian. Sometimes, as was the custom among the
> Incas, and as is still the custom among Turks and Esthonians, the
> refuse of hair and nails is preserved so that the owner may have them
> at the resurrection of the body. \[b\] In connection with this, one of
> my sons tells me that his Jamaican negro housekeeper speaks of the
> old-time blacks keeping their hair-cuttings to be put in a pillow in
> their coffins, and preserving the parings of their nails, because they
> would need them in the next world. It is a common superstition among
> ourselves that when children's teeth come out they should not be
> thrown away, lest the child has to seek for the lost tooth after
> death. On the other hand, it is an equally common practice to throw
> the teeth in the fire 'out of harm's way.'

> But the larger number of practices give expression to the belief in
> what is known as 'sympathetic magic'; as we say, 'like cures like,' Or
> more appositely, in barbaric theory, 'kills like.' Things outwardly
> resembling one another are believed to possess the same qualities,
> effects being thereby brought about in the man himself by the
> production of like effects in things belonging to him, or in images or
> effigies of him. The Zulu sorcerers, when they have secured a portion
> of their victim's dress, will bury it in some secret place, so that,
> as it rots away, his life may decay. In the New Hebrides it was the
> common practice to hide nail-parings and cuttings of hair, and to give
> the remains of food carefully to the pigs. 'When the *mae* snake
> carried away a fragment of food into the place sacred to a spirit, the
> man who had eaten of the food would sicken as the fragment
> decayed.\[c\] Brand tells that in a witchcraft trial in the
> seventeenth century, the accused  confessed 'having buried a glove of
> the said Lord Henry in the ground, so that as the glove did rot and
> waste, the liver of the said lord might rot and waste'; and the New
> Britain sorcerer of to-day will burn a castaway banana skin, so that
> the man who carelessly left it unburied may die a tormenting death. A
> fever-stricken Australian native girl told the doctor who attended her
> that 'some moons back, when the Goulburn blacks were encamped near
> Melbourne, a young man named Gibberook came behind her and cut off a
> lock of her hair, and that she was sure he had buried it, and that it
> was rotting somewhere. Her marm-bu-la (kidney fat) was wasting away,
> and when the stolen hair had completely rotted she would die.' She
> added that her name had been lately cut on a tree by some wild black,
> and that was another sign of death. Her name was Murran, which means
> 'a leaf,' and the doctor afterwards found that the figure of leaves
> had been carved on a gum-tree as described by the girl. The sorceress
> said that the spirit of a black fellow had cut the figure on the tree.
> \[d\]

> The putting of sharp stones in the foot-tracks of an enemy is believed
> to maim him, as a nail is driven into a horse's footprint to lame him,
> \[e\] while the chewing of a piece of wood is thought to soften the
> heart of a man with whom a bargain is being driven. Folk-medicine, the
> wide world through, is full of prescriptions based on sympathetic or
> antipathetic magic. Its doctrine of 'seals' or 'signatures' is
> expressed in the use of yellow flowers for jaundice, and of eye-bright
> for ophthalmia, while among the wonder-working roots there is the
> familiar mandrake of human shape, credited, in virtue of that
> resemblance, with magic power. In Umbria, where the peasants seek to
> nourish the consumptive on rosebuds and dew, the mothers take their
> children, wasted by sickness, to some boundary stone, perchance once
> sacred to Hermes, and pray to God to stay the illness or end the
> sufferer's life. The Cheroki make a decoction of the cone-flower for
> weak eyes because of the fancied resemblance of that plant to the
> strong-sighted eye of the deer; and they also drink an infusion of the
> tenacious burrs of the common beggars' lice, an Americai species of
> the genus *Desmodium*, to strengthen the memory. To ensure a fine
> voice, they boil crickets, and drink the liquor. In Suffolk and other
> parts of these islands, a common remedy for warts is to secretly
> pierce a snail or 'dodman with a gooseberry-bush thorn, rub the snail
> on the wart, and then bury it, so that, as it decays the wart may
> wither away.

> Chinese doctors administer the head, middle or roots of plants, as the
> case may be, to cure the complaints of their patients in the head
> body, or legs. And with the practice of the Zulu medicine-man, who
> takes the bones of the oldest bull or dog of the tribe, giving
> scrapings of these to the sick, so that their lives may b prolonged to
> old age, \[f\] we may compare that of doctors in the seventeenth
> century, who with lest logic, but perchance unconscious humour, gav
> their patients pulverised mummy to prolong their years. \[g\]'Mummie,'
> says Sir Thomas Browne, 'is become merchandise. Mizraim cures wounds,
> and Pharaoh is sold for balsams.' \[h\]

> In Plutarch's *Roman Questions*, which Dr. Jevons, in his valuable
> preface to the reprint of Philemon Holland's translation, \[i\]
> remarks 'may fairly be said to be the earliest formal treatise written
> on the subject of folk-lore,' reference is made to the Roman customs
> of not completely clearing the table of food, and 'never putting
> foorth the light of a lampe, but suffering it to goe out of the owne
> accord.' These obviously come under the head of sympathetic magic,
> 'being safeguards against starvation and darkness.' In Melanesia, if a
> man wounds another with an arrow, he will drink hot juices and chew
> irritat\~ ing leaves to bring about agony to the wounded, and he will
> keep his bow taut, pulling it at intervals to cause nerve-tension and
> tetanus in his victim. Here, though wide seas between them roll, we
> may compare the same philosophy of things at work. The 'sympathetic
> powder' used by Sir Kenelm Digby in the seventeenth century was
> believed to cure a wound if applied to the sword that inflicted it;
> and, to-day, the Suffolk farmer keeps the sickle with which he has cut
> himself free from rust, so that the wound may not fester. Here, too,
> lies the answer to the question that puzzled Plutarch. 'What is the
> reason that of all those things which be dedicate and consecrated to
> the gods, the custome is a Rome, that onely the spoiles of enemies
> conquered in the warres are neglected and suffered to run to decay in
> processe of time: neither is ther any reverence done unto them, nor
> repaired be they at any time when they wax olde?' Of course the custom
> is the outcome of the belief that the enemy's power waned as his
> armour rusted away.

> Equally puzzling to Plutarch was the custom among Roman women 'of the
> most noble an auncient houses' to 'carry little moones upon their
> shoes.' These were of the nature of amulets, designed to deceive the
> lunacy-bringing moon spirit, so that it might enter the crescent charm
> instead of the wearer. 'The Chaldeans diverted the spirit of disease
> from the sick man by providing an image in the likeness of the spirit
> to attract the plague.' \[j\] 'Make of it an image in his likeness
> (*i.e.* of Namtar, the plague); apply it to the living flesh of his
> body (i.e. of the sick man), may the malevolent Namtar who possesses
> him pass into the image.' \[k\] But the reverse effect was more
> frequently the aim. A Chaldean tablet records the complaint of some
> victim, that 'he who enchants images has charmed away my life by
> image'; and Ibn Khaldun, an Arabian writer of the fourteenth century,
> describes how the Nabathean sorcerers of the Lower Euphrates made an
> image of the person whom they plotted to destroy. They transcribed his
> name on his effigy, uttered magic curses over it, and then, after
> divers other ceremonies, left the evil spirits to complete the fell
> work. \[l\] In ancient Egyptian belief the ka of a living person could
> be transferred to a wax image by the repetition of formulae and there
> is no break in the long centuries between Accadian magic, which so
> profoundly influenced the West, and the practice of injuring a man
> through his image, which flourishes to-day. The Ojibways believe that
> 'by drawing the figure of any person in sand or clay, or by
> considering any object as the figure of a person, and then pricking it
> with a sharp stick or other weapon, or doing anything that would be
> done to the living body to cause pain or death, the person thus
> represented will suffer likewise.' \[m\] King James I., in his
> *Daemonology*, Book is. ch. v., speaks of 'the devil teaching how to
> make pictures of wax or clay, that by roasting thereof the persons
> that they bear the name of may be continually melted or dried away by
> sickness; and, as showing the continuity of the idea, there are
> exhibited in the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford, besides similar objects
> from the Straits Settlements, a 'Corp Creidh' or 'clay body' from the
> Highlands, and a pig's heart from Devonshire, with pins stuck in them.

> The assumed correspondence between physical phenomena and human
> actions is further shown in Dr Johnson's observation, when describing
> his visit to the Hebrides, that the peasants expect better crops by
> sowing their seed at the new moon; and he recalls from memory a
> precept annually given in the almanack, 'to kill hogs when the moon is
> waxing, that the bacon may prove the better in boiling.' With the
> ancient Roman custom of throwing images of the corn-spirit (doubtless
> substitutes of actual human offerings) into the river, so that the
> crops might be drenched with rain, we may compare the practice of the
> modern Servians and Thessalians, who strip a little girl naked, but
> wrap her completely in leaves and flowers, and then dance and sing
> round her, while bowls of water are poured over her to make the rain
> come. The life of man pulsates with the great heart of nature in many
> a touching superstition, as in the belief in the dependence of the
> earth's fertility on the vigour of the tree-spirit incarnated in the
> priest-king \[n\] in the group which connects the waning of the days
> with the decline of human years; and, pathetically enough, in the
> widespread notion, of which Dickens makes use in *David Copperfield*,
> that life goes out with the ebb-tide.

> 'I was on the point of asking him if he knew me, when he tried to
> stretch out his arm, and said te me, distinctly, with a pleasant
> smile, "Barkis is willin'."

> 'And, it being low water, he went out with the tide.'

> The general idea has only to be decked ii another garb to fit the
> frame of mind which still reserves some pet sphere of nature for the
> operation of the special and the arbitrary. 'The narrower the range of
> man's knowledge of physical causes, the wider is the field which he
> hat to fill up with hypothetical causes of a metaphysical or
> supernatural character.'

> We must not pass from these examples of belief in sympathetic
> connection, drawn from home at well as foreign sources, without
> reference to its significance in connection with food outside the
> prohibitions which are usually explained by the totem, that is,
> abstinence from the plant or animal which is regarded as the tribal
> ancestor.

> Captain Wells, who was killed near Chicago in 1812, and who was
> celebrated for his valour among the Indians, was cut up into many
> parts, which were distributed among the allied tribes, so that all
> might have the opportunity of getting a taste of the courageous
> soldier. For it is a common belief among barbaric folk that by eating
> the flesh of a brave man a portion of his courage is absorbed. The
> Botecudos sucked the blood of living victims that they might imbibe
> spiritual force, and among the Brazilian natives the first food given
> to a child, when weaning it, was the flesh of an enemy. \[o\]
> Cannibalism, the origin of which is probably due to a scarcity of
> animal food, therefore acquires this superadded motive, in which also
> lies the explanation of the eating of, or abstaining from, the flesh
> of certain animals. The lion's flesh gives courage, the deer's flesh
> causes timidity; and in more subtle form of the same idea, barbaric
> hunters will abstain from oil lest the game slip through their
> fingers. Contrariwise, the Hessian lad thinks that he may escape the
> conscription by carrying a baby girl's cap in his pocket: a symbolic
> way of repudiating manhood. \[p\]

> Most suggestive of all is the extension of the idea to the eating of
> the slain god, whereby his spirit is imbibed, and communion with the
> unseen secured. To quote Mr. Frazer, the savage believes that 'by
> eating the body of the god he shares in the god's attributes and
> powers; and when the god is a corn-god, the corn is his proper body;
> when he is a vine-god, the juice of the grape is his blood; and so, by
> eating the bread and drinking the wine, the worshipper partakes of the
> real body and blood of his god. Thus the drinking of wine in the rite
> of a vine-god, like Dionysus, is not an act of revelry; it is a solemn
> sacrament.' \[q\] Experience shows that people possessing intelligence
> above the ordinary often fail to see the bearing of one set of facts
> upon another set, especially if the application can be' made to their
> traditional beliefs, whether these are only mechanically held, or
> ardently defended. It is, therefore, not wholly needless to point out
> that Mr. Frazer's explanation is to be extended to the rites attaching
> to Christianity, transubstantiation being, laterally \[r\] or
> lineally, the descendant of the barbaric idea of eating the god,
> whereby the communicant becomes a 'partaker of the divine nature.' In
> connection with this we may cite Professor Robertson Smith's remark,
> that a notable application of the idea of eating the flesh or drinking
> the blood of another being, so that a man absorbs its nature or life
> into his own, is the rite of blood-brotherhood, the simplest form of
> which is in two men opening their veins and sucking one another's
> blood. 'Thenceforth their lives are not two, but one. ' \[s\] Among
> the Unyamuezi the ceremony is performed by cutting incisions in each
> other's legs and letting the blood trickle together. \[t\] Fuller
> reference. to this widely diffused rite will, however, have more
> fitting place later on, when treating of the custom of the exchange of
> names which, as will be seen, often goes with it. Belief in virtue
> inhering in the dead man's body involves belief in virtue in his
> belongings, in which is the key to the belief in the elEcacy of relics
> as vehicles of supernatural power. Here the continuity is clearly
> traceable. There is no fundamental difference between the savage who
> carries about with him the skull-bones of his ancestor as a charm or
> seat of oracle, and the Buddhist who places the relics of holy men
> beneath the tope, or the Catholic who deposits the fragments of saints
> or martyrs within the altar which their presence sanctifies; while the
> mother, treasuring her dead child's lock of hair, witnesses to the
> vitality of feelings drawn from perennial springs in human nature.
> Well-nigh every relic which the Church safeguards beneath her shrines,
> or exhibits, at stated seasons, for the adoration of the crowd, is
> spurious, \[u\] yet no amount of ridicule thrown on these has impaired
> the credulity whose strength lies in the dominance of the wish to
> believe over the desire to know. \[v\]

> In 'Whuppity Stoorie' the widow and the witch 'watted thooms' over
> their bargain. Man's saliva plays a smaller, but by no means inactive,
> part in his superstitions. A goodly-sized book might be written on the
> history and ethnic distribution of the customs connected with it.
> Employed as vehicle of blessing or cursing, of injury or cure, by
> peoples intellectually as far apart as the Jews, the South Sea
> Islanders, the medieval Christians, and the Central Africans of
> to-day, the potencies of this normally harmless secretion have been
> most widely credited. \[w\] Among ourselves it is a vehicle of one of
> the coarsest forms of assault, or the degenerate representative of the
> old luck-charm in the spitting on money by the cabman or the
> costermonger. Among certain barbaric races, however, the act expresses
> the kindliest feeling and the highest compliment. Consul Petherick
> says that a Sudanese chief, after grasping his hand, spat on it, and
> then did the like to his face, a form of salute which the consul
> returned with interest, to the delight of the recipient. Among the
> Masai the same custom is universal; and while it is bad form to kiss a
> lady, it is *comme il faut* to spit on her.\[x\] authority who reports
> this adds an account of certain generative virtues with which saliva,
> especially if administered by a white man, is accredited. \[y\] But it
> is as a prophylactic, notably in the form of fasting spittle, and as a
> protection against sorcery and all forms of black magic, that we meet
> with frequent references to it in ancient writers, and in modern books
> of traveL 'Spittle,' says Brand, 'was esteemed a charm against all
> kinds of fascination, \[z\] notably against the evil eye, the remedy
> for which, still in vogue among the Italians, is to spit three times
> upon the breast, as did the urban maiden in Theocritus when she
> refused her rustic wooer. It came out in the course of a murder trial
> at Philippopolis, that the Bulgarians believe that spitting gives
> immunity from the consequences of perjury. \[aa\] An example of its
> use in benediction occurs, as when the Abomel of Alzpirn spat on his
> clergy and laity; but more familiar are the cases of its application
> in baptism and name-giving. Seward says that 'the custom of nurses
> lustrating the children by spittle was one of the ceremonies used on
> the Dies Nominalis, the day the child was named; so that there can be
> no doubt of the Papists deriving this custom from the heathen nurses
> and grandmothers. They have indeed christened it, as it were, by
> flinging in some Scriptural expressions; but then they have carried it
> to a more filthy extravagance by daubing it on the nostrils of adults
> as well as of children.' \[ab\] Ockley tells that when Hasan was born,
> his grandfather, Mohammed, spat in his mouth as he named him; and
> Mungo Park thus describes the name-giving ceremony among the Mandingo
> people. 'A child is named when it is seven or eight days old. The
> ceremony commences by shaving the head. The priest offers a prayer, in
> which he solicits the blessing of God upon the child and all the
> company, and then whispering a few sentences in the child's ear, spits
> three times in his face, after which, pronouncing his name aloud, be
> returns the child to its mother.'

> All which, of course, has vital connection with the belief in inherent
> virtue in saliva, and therefore with the widespread group of customs
> which have for their object the prevention of its falling within the
> power of the sorcerer. Suabian folk-medicine prescribes that the
> saliva should at once be trodden into the ground lest some
> evil-disposed. person use it for sorcery. As the result of extensive
> acquaintance with the North American Indians, Captain Bourke says that
> all of them are careful to spit into their cloaks or blankets and Kane
> adds his testimony that the natives of Columbia River are never seen
> to spit without carefully stamping out the saliva. This they do lest
> an enemy should find it, and work injury through it. The chief officer
> of the 'king' of Congo receives the royal saliva in a rag, which he
> doubles up and kisses; while in Hawaii the guardianship of the
> monarch's expectorations was intrusted only to a chief of high rank,
> who held the dignified office of spittoon-bearer to the king, and who,
> like his fellow-holders of the same trust under other Polynesian
> rulers, buried the saliva beyond the reach of malicious medicine-men.
> Finally, as bearing on the absence of any delimiting lines between a
> man's belongings, there may be cited Brand's reference to Debrio. He
> 'portrays the manners and ideas of the continent, and mentions that
> upon those hairs which come out of the head in combing they spit
> thrice before they throw them away.' \[ac\]

> The reluctance of savages to have their portraits taken is explicable
> when brought into relation with the group of confused ideas under
> review. Naturally, the man thinks that virtue has gone out of him,
> that some part of his vulnerable self is put at the mercy of his
> fellows, when he sees his 'counterfeit presentment' on a sheet of
> paper, or peering from out magic glass. The reluctance of unlettered
> people among ourselves to have their likenesses taken is not uncommon.
> From Scotland to Somerset \[ad\] there comes evidence about the
> ill-health or ill-luck which followed the camera, of folks who 'took
> bad and died' after being 'a-tookt.' These facts will remove any
> surprise at Catlin's well known story of the accusation brought
> against him by the Yukons that he had made buffaloes scarce by putting
> so many pictures of them in his book. \[ae\]
