THE NAME AND THE SOUL

 

> AT the close of this survey of evidence that, in barbaric psychology,
> the name is believed to be an integral part of a man, the question
> which suggests itself is, *What part*?

> The importance attached by the ancient Egyptians to the name in
> connection with its owner's personality has been already referred to.
> They had no doubt whatever that if the name was blotted out, the man
> ceased to exist. In their composite and conglomerate theories of the
> individual we have refinements of distinction which surpass anything
> known in cognate barbaric ideas. The Hidatsa Indians believe that
> every human being has four souls which at death depart one after the
> other. But this is simplicity itself compared to Egyptian ontology. In
> this we find (1) the *sahn*, or spiritual body; then (2) the *ka*, or
> double (other-self), which, although its normal dwelling-place was the
> tomb, could wander at will, and even take up its abode in the statue
> of a man. It could eat and drink, and, if the sweet savour of incense
> and other ethereal offerings failed, could content itself with feeding
> on the viands painted on the walls of the tomb. Then there was (3) the
> *ba*, or soul, about which the texts reveal opposing views, but which
> is usually depicted as a bird with human heads and hands. To this
> follow (4) the *ab*, or heart, held to be the source both of life and
> of good and evil in the life, and, as the seat of vital power, without
> which there could be no resurrection of the body, jealously guarded
> against abstraction by the placing of heart-shaped amulets on the
> mummy. \[a\] Next in order is (5) the *khaibit* or shadow; then (6)
> the *khu* or shining covering of the spiritual body which dwelt in
> heaven with the gods; and (7) the *sekhem* or personified power of the
> man.

> Last, but not least, was (8) the REN or name that 'part of the
> immortal Ego, without which no being could exist.' Extraordinary
> precautions were. taken to prevent the extinction of the *ren* and in
> the pyramid texts we find the deceased making supplication that it may
> flourish 'germinate' along with the names of the gods. \[b\] The basal
> connection between this practice ar that of the importance attached to
> the record the name in the 'Lamb's Book of Life' as ensuing admission
> to heaven, \[c\] which is a canon popular modern belief, is too
> obvious for comment. Among the Pacific races, Bancroft tells us, 'the
> name assumes a personality, it is the shadow spirit or other-self of
> the flesh-and-blood person. Civilised and savage are at one in their
> identification of the soul with something intangible, breath, shadow,
> reflection, flame, and so fort But it is the cessation of breathing
> which, the long-run, came to be noted as the neve failing
> accompaniment of death; and where the condensation of the exhaled
> breath is visible, there would be support lent to the theory of souls
> as gaseous or ethereal. In every language, from that of the barbaric
> Aino to classic Greek and modern English, the word for 'spirit' and
> for 'breath' is the same. Hence, the unsubstantial 'name' falls into
> line with the general nebulous conception of spirit, and, were
> barbaric languages less mutable, it might be possible to find some
> help to an equation between 'name' and 'soul' in them. But as even
> seemingly stable things like numerals and personal pronouns undergo
> rapid change among the lower races, 'two or three generations
> sufficing to alter the whole aspect of their dialects among the wild
> and unintelligent tribes of Siberia, Africa, and Siam,' the search is
> hopeless. Some light, however, is thrown upon the matter by languages
> in which favourable circumstances have preserved traces of family
> likeness and of mutations. In asking the question, whether there be
> any evidence from philology to show what part of a man his name is
> supposed to be, Professor Rhys has been first in the field to supply
> materials for an answer. He says that 'as regards the Aryan nations,
> \[d\] we seem to have a clue in an interesting group of words from
> which I select the following: Irish *ainm*, "a name," plural *anmann*;
> Old Welsh *anu*, now *enw*, also a name; Old Bulgarian *ime*; Old
> Russian *emnes*, *emmens*, accusative *emnan*, and Armenian
> *anwan*--all meaning "a name." To these some scholars would add, and
> rightly, I think, the English word name itself, the Latin *nomen*,
> Sanskrit *naman*, and the Greek όνομα; but, as some others find a
> difficulty in thus grouping these last-mentioned words, I abstain from
> laying any stress on them. In fact, I have every reason to be
> satisfied with the wide extent of the Aryan world covered by the other
> instances which I have enumerated as Celtic, Prussian, Bulgarian, and
> Armenian. Now, such is the similarity between Welsh *enw*, "name," and
> *enaid*, "soul," that I cannot help referring the two words to one and
> the same origin, especially when I see the same or rather greater
> similarity illustrated by the Irish words *ainm*, "name," and *anim*,
> "soul."

> This similarity between the Irish words so pervades the declension of
> them, that a beginner frequently falls into the error of confounding
> them as medieval texts. Take, for instance the genitive singular
> *anma*, which may mean either "animae" or "nominis"; the nominative
> plural *anmanna*, which may be either "animae or "nomina"; and
> *anmann*, either "animarum or "nominum," as the dative *anmannaib* may
> like-wise be either "animabus" or "nominibus." In fact, one is tempted
> to suppose that the partis differentiation of the Irish forms was only
> brought about under the influence of Latin with its distinct forms of
> *anima* and *nomen*. Be that as it may, the direct teaching of the
> Celtic vocables is that they are all to be referred to the same origin
> in the Aryan word for breath or breathing, which is represented by
> such words as Latin *anima*, Welsih *anadl*, "breath," and Gothic
> *anan*, "blow" or "breathe," whence the compound preterite *uz*-on
> twice used in the fifteenth chapter of St. Mark's Gospel to render
> εξέπνενσε, "gave up the ghost." Lastly, the lesson which the words in
> question contain for the student of man is that the Celts, and certain
> other widely separated Aryans, unless we should rather say the whole
> Aryan family, believed at one time not only that the name was a part
> of the man, but that it was that part of him which is termed the soul,
> the breath of life, or whatever you may choose to define it as
> being.\[e\]

> The important bearing of this evidence from language on all that has
> preceded is too clear to need enlarged comment. It adds another item
> to the teeming mass of facts witnessing to the psychical as well as
> the physical unity of man. It has become a truism that at the same
> intellectual level, however wide the zones that separate him, he
> explains the same phenomena in much the same way; any set of facts
> gathered in one quarter being complementary to any set of facts
> gathered in another quarter.

> One by one the theories armed with assumption of the presence of
> caprice and elements of disorder in the universe have been defeated
> until they reached their last stand in the citadel of Mansoul. From
> that final retreat they are being ousted, because man's extension of
> the methods of inquiry into his surroundings to his inner nature makes
> clear that he is no exception amongst animated beings, but has his
> place in the universal order.
