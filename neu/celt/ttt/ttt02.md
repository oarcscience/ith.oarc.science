INTRODUCTION

 

> IN commenting on the prominent example of the conversion of the old
> epics into allegories which is supplied by Tennyson's *Idylls of the
> King*, whereby the legends 'lose their dream reality without gaining
> the reality of ordinary life,' Mr. Leslie Stephen remarks that 'as
> soon as the genuine inhabitants of Fairyland can be interpreted as
> three virtues or three graces, they cease to fascinate' him. With that
> confession most people will agree. For alike to those who told the
> story, and to their hearers, these 'inhabitants of Fairyland' were no
> buckram-clad personifications of Moralities like the characters in the
> Mystery Plays of four centuries ago. They were real dwellers in a real
> Wonderland, whose limits are only those of the broad, deep convert
> them into vehicles of edification is not merely to empty them of their
> primitive significance, but to make vain the attempt to understand the
> conditions which gave birth and long renown to saga and fireside tale.
> In the dim past when these were woven out of old traditions, no sharp
> lines severed nature from super-nature; troll and fairy were part of
> the vagaries which seemed to make up the sum of things at whose core
> it entered not the mind of man to conceive that unbroken order might
> be found. Their old mythologies, full of crude and coarse detail, were
> no fables to the ancient Greeks slowly rising above the barbaric level
> of ancestors on a plane with the Gold Coast savage who believes his
> medicine-man when, handing on the traditional cosmogony of the tribe,
> he tells how the world was made by a big spider. The healthynatured
> child, who in many things represents the savage stage of thinking,
> listens without question to the stories of the Giant who hid his heart
> in a duck's egg on an island out of harm's way, as he vainly hoped;
> and of Beauty and the Beast, where the princess's curiosity led to the
> retransformation of the enchanted prince to the shape of loathly
> monster.

> To the secular arm, therefore, be delivered any and every book which,
> catering for the youngsters, throttles the life of the old folk-tales
> with coils of explanatory notes, and heaps on their maimed corpses the
> dead weight of bibliographical appendices. Nevertheless, that which
> delighted our childhood may instruct our manhood; and notes,
> appendices, and all the gear of didactic exposition, have their place
> elsewhere in helping the student, anxious to reach the seed of fact
> which is covered by the pulp of fiction. For, to effect this is to
> make approach to man's thoughts and conceptions of himself and his
> surroundings, to his way of looking at things, and to explanation of
> his conduct both in work and play. Hence the folk-tale and the game
> are alike pressed into the service of study of the human mind. Turn
> where we may, the pastimes of children are seen to mimic the serious
> pursuits of men. Their dances and romps, their tin soldiers, guns, and
> trumpets, the dolls and other apparatus of the nursery, and the
> strategic combats of the playground, have a high antiquity. The game
> of 'Buck, buck, how many fingers do I hold up?' was played in the
> streets of Imperial Rome. The ancient Greek 'ostrakinda,' or 'game of
> the shell,' has its counterpart in one played among the Navajoes of
> New Mexico. 'Hot cockles' is depicted on Egyptian wall-paintings, and
> a wooden toy-bird with wheels under its wings, found in the Faym
> cemetery, is identical with specimens in use among Yakut and Aino
> children. The players of 'All Round the Mulberry Tree' probably
> represent a dance of old round a sacred bush; 'Green Gravel' and
> 'Jenny Jones' are funeral games; 'Forfeits' are relics of divination;
> and 'Cat's Cradle' belongs to the string puzzles which are played all
> the world over by savage and civilised.

> Whether game and story embody serious elements, or are the outcome of
> lighter moods, it is this trivial or earnest purpose that we strive to
> reach. And, notably in the analysis of tales, that effort has been
> well justified in bringing us, often when least suspected, near some
> deposit of early thought, near some guesses at a philosophy which
> embraces all life in a common origin and destiny; and in putting us
> into touch with instinctive feelings of the Un-cultured mind whose
> validity has been proved by reason and experience.

> A superficial acquaintance with folk-tales reveals the fact that many
> of them are capable of division into a series of well-marked groups
> united by a common *motif*, round which imagination has played,
> 'truth' being thus 'embodied in a tale.' And the interest in this
> cardinal feature is the greater if it can be shown to contain some
> primitive philosophy of things which 'has expressed itself in beliefs
> that have ruled man's conduct, and in rites and ceremonies which are
> the 'outward and visible signs' of the beliefs. Several groups answer
> to this requirement. One of them centres round the tale, referred to
> above, of 'the Giant who had no Heart in his Body,' variants of which
> have been found from India to the Highlands, and from the Arctic
> seaboard to Africa. The fundamental idea in this group is the
> widespread barbaric belief in the separateness of the soul or heart or
> strength, or whatever

> else is denominated the seat of life, from the body, whose fate is
> nevertheless bound up with that of the soul. In the Norse example, a
> princess wooed by a giant wheedles him, in Delilah--like fashion, into
> making known in what secret place his heart is hidden. lie tells her
> that it is in an egg in a duck swimming in a well in a church on an
> island, all which she straightway repeats to her true love who has
> stolen into the castle to rescue her. With the aid of a number of
> helpful animals, a common feature of folk-tales, the lover gets the
> egg, and as he squeezes it the giant bursts to pieces. Fantastic as
> all this seems, it is only the accretion of varying detail round a
> serious belief of which living examples are found throughout the
> world. Obviously that belief lies at the base of the argument by which
> Herbert Spencer, Tylor, and others of their school show how theories
> of the soul and future life were elaborated from barbaric conceptions
> of the 'other self' which quitted the body for a time in sleep and
> dreams and swoons, leaving it at death to. return no more, although
> fitfully visiting its old haunts to help or harm the living. But more
> than bare hint on these matters lies beyond the purpose of this
> reference, which is designed to make easier the passage to the
> significance of the central idea of another group of folk-tales, the
> masterpiece among which gives its title to this volume.
