TABOO

 

> TABOO is the dread tyrant of savage life. Among civilised peoples,
> under the guise of customs whose force is stronger than law, it rules
> in larger degree than most persons care to admit. But among barbaric
> communities it puts a ring. fence round the simplest acts, regulates
> all intercourse by the minutest codes, and secures obedience to its
> manifold prohibitions by threats of punishment to be inflicted by
> magic and other apparatus of the invisible. It is the Inquisition of
> the lower culture, only more terrible and effective than the infamous
> 'Holy Office.' Nowhere, perhaps, does it exert more constant sway than
> in the series of customs which prohibit (a) persons related in certain
> degrees by blood or marriage from addressing one another by name, or
> from even looking at one another, and which further prohibit (b) the
> utterance of the names of individuals of high rank, as priests and
> kings, as also (c) of the dead, and (d) of gods and spiritual beings
> generally.

> TABOO BETWEEN RELATIVES

> Among the Central Australians a man may not marry or speak to his
> mother-in-law. He may speak to his mother at all times, but not to his
> sister if she be younger than himself. A father may not speak to his
> daughter after she becomes a woman.\[a\] The name of his father-in-law
> is taboo to the Dyak of Borneo, and among the Omahas of North America
> the father- and mother-in-law do not speak to their son-in-law or
> mention his name. \[b\] The names of mothers-in-law are never uttered
> by the Apache, and it would be very improper to ask for them by name.
> \[c\] In the Bougainville Straits the men would only utter the names
> of their wives in a low tone, as though it was not the proper thing to
> speak of women by name to others.\[d\] In East Africa, among the
> Barea, the wife never utters the name of her husband, or eats in his
> presence; and even among the Beni Amer, where the women have extensive
> privileges and great social power, the wife is still not allowed to
> eat in the husband's presence, and mentions his name only before
> strangers. \[e\] In the Banks Islands the rules as to avoidance are
> very minute. 'A man who sits and talks with his wife's father will not
> mention his name, much less the name of his mother-in-law; and the
> like applies to the wife, who, further, will on no account name her
> daughter's husband.' \[f\] But these prohibitions are not found in all
> the Melanesian islands. Among the Sioux or Dacotas the father- or
> mother-in-law must not call their sons-in-law by name, and *vice
> versa*; while the Indians east of the Rockies regard it as indecent
> for either fathers- or mothers-in-law to look at, or speak- to, their
> sons- or daughters-in-law. It was considered a gross breach of
> propriety among the Blackfoot tribe for a man to meet his
> mother-in-law; and if by any mischance he did so, or, what was worse,
> if he spoke to her, she demanded a heavy payment, which he was
> compelled to make. \[g\] In New Britain a man must under no
> circumstances speak to his mother-in-law; he must go miles out of his
> way not to meet her, and the penalty for breaking an oath is to be
> forced to shake hands With her. \[h\] In some parts of Australia the
> mother-in-law does not allow the son-in-law to see her, but hides
> herself at his approach, or covers herself with her clothes if she has
> to pass him. Even Pund-jel, the Australian Creator of all things, has
> a wife whose face he has never seen. \[i\] Sometimes circumlocutory
> phrases are used, although, as will be seen presently, these are more
> usually applied to supernatural beings. For example, among the Amazulu
> the woman must not call her husband by name; therefore, when speaking
> of him, she will say, 'Father of So-andso,' meaning one of her
> children. As the Hindu wife is never, under any circumstances, to
> mention her husband's name, she calls him 'He,' 'The Master,' 'Swamy,'
> etc. An old-fashioned Midland cottager's wife rarely speaks of her
> husband by name, the pronoun 'he,' supplemented by 'my man,' or 'my
> master,' is sufficient distinction. G-regor says that 'in Buckie there
> are certain family names that fishermen will not pronounce,' the folk
> in the village of Coull speaking of 'spitting out the bad name.' If
> such a name be mentioned in their hearing, they spit, or, in- the
> vernacular, 'chiff,' and the man who bears the dreaded name is called
> a 'chifferoot.' When occasion to speak of him arises, a circumlocutory
> phrase is used, as. 'The man it diz so in so,' or 'The laad it lives
> at such and such a place.' As further showing how barbaric ideas
> persist in the heart of civilisation, there is an overwhelming feeling
> against hiring men bearing the reprobated names as hands for the boats
> in the herring fishing season; and when they have been hired before
> their names were known, their wages have been refused if the season
> has been a failure. 'Ye hinna hid sic a fishin' this year is ye hid
> the last,' said a woman to the daughter of a famous fisher. 'Na, na!
> faht wye cud we? We wiz in a chifferoot's 'oose, we cudnae hae a
> fushin'.' In some of the villages on the east coast of Aberdeenshire
> it was accounted unlucky to meet any one of the name of Whyte when
> going to sea. Lives would be lost, or the catch of fish would be poor.
> \[j\] In the Story of Tangalimbibo '\[k\] the heroine speaks of things
> done 'knowingly by people whose names may not be mentioned'; upon
> which Mr. Theal remarks, 'no Kaffir woman may pronounce the names of
> any of her husband's male relatives in the ascending line; she may not
> even pronounce any word in which the principal syllable of his name
> occurs.' \[l\] Some further examples of this extension of the general
> superstition to parts of the name will be given further on when
> dealing with higher principalities and powers. Meanwhile, the curious
> set of avoidance-customs just illustrated naturally prompt inquiry as
> to their origin. Upon this little, if any, light can be thrown. The
> relation of these customs to the general system of taboo is obvious,
> but what motive prompted this particular, and to us whimsical, code of
> etiquette, remains a problem not the less difficult of solution in the
> face of the wide distribution of the custom. Long before any
> systematic inquiry into social usages was set afoot, and before any
> importance was attached to the folk-tale as holding primitive ideas in
> solution, the taboo-incident was familiar in stories of which 'Cupid
> and Psyche,' and the more popular 'Beauty and the Beast,' are types.

> gives us a gossipy story on this matter, which is of some value. He
> says that some of the old lonian colonists brought no women with them,
> but took wives of the women of the Carians, whose fathers they had
> slain. Therefore the women made a law to themselves, and handed it
> down to their daughters, that they should never sit at meat with their
> husbands, and that none should call her husband by name. \[m\]
> Disregarding the explanation of the formulating of social codes by
> women bereaved of husbands and lovers, which Herodotus, assuming this
> to be an isolated case, appears to suggest, we find in the reference
> to the abducting of the Carians an illustration of the ancient
> practice of obtaining wives by forcible capture, and the consequent
> involuntary mingling of people of alien race and speech. That,
> however, carries us but a little, if any, way towards explaining the
> avoidance-customs, the origin of which remains a perplexing problem.
> In an important paper on the 'Development of Institutions applied to
> Marriage and Descent, \[n\]

> Professor Tylor formulated an ingenious method, the pursuit of which
> may help us toward a solution. He shows that the custom cannot arise
> from local idiosyncrasies, because in cataloguing some three hundred
> and fifty peoples he finds it in vogue among sixty-six peoples widely
> distributed over the globe; that is, he finds forty-five examples of
> avoidance between the husband and his wife's relations; thirteen
> examples between the wife and her husband's relations; and eight
> examples of mutual avoidance. The schedules also show a relation
> between the avoidance-customs and 'the customs of the world as to
> residence after marriage.' Among the three hundred and fifty peoples
> the husband goes to live with his wife's family in sixty-five
> instances, while there are one hundred and forty-one cases in which
> the wife takes up her abode with her husband's family. Thus there is a
> well-marked preponderance indicating that ceremonial avoidance by the
> husband is in some way connected with his living with his wife's
> family, and *vice versa* as to the wife and the husband's family. The
> reason of this connection 'readily presents itself, inasmuch as the
> ceremony of not speaking to and pretending not to see some well-known
> person close by, is familiar enough to ourselves in the social rite
> which we call "cutting." This indeed with us implies aversion, and the
> implication comes out even more strongly in objection to utter the
> name ("we never mention her," as the song has it).' It is different,
> however, in the barbaric custom, for here the husband is none the less
> on friendly terms with his wife's people because they may not take any
> notice of one another. As the husband has intruded himself among a
> family which is not his own, and into a house where he has no right,
> it seems not difficult to understand their marking the difference
> between him and themselves by treating him formally as a stranger.
> John Tanner, the adopted Ojibwa, describes his being taken by a
> friendly Assineboin into his lodge, and seeing how at his companion's
> entry the old father- and mother-in-law covered up their heads in
> their blankets till their son-inlaw got into the compartment reserved
> for him, where his wife brought him his food. So like is

> The working of the human mind in all stages of civilisation that our
> own language conveys in a familiar idiom the train of thought which
> governed the behaviour of the parents of the Assineboin's wife. We
> have only to say that they do not recognise their son-in-law, and we
> shall have condensed the whole proceeding into a single word. A
> seemingly allied custom is that of naming the father after the child,
> this being found among peoples practising avoidance-customs, where a
> status is given to the husband only on the birth of the first child.
> The naming of him as father of 'So-and-so' is a recognition of
> paternity, and also a recognition of him by the wife's kinsfolk.

> To refer to these strange and unexplained customs is to bring home the
> salutary fact that perchance we may never get at the back of many a

> Euphemisms and Name-Changes

> Persons and things cannot remain nameless, and avoidance of one set of
> names compels the use of others. Hence ingenuity comes into play to
> devise substitutes, roundabout phrases, euphemisms, and the like. Many
> motives are at work in the selection. (i) Both dead and living things
> are often given complimentary names in 'good omen words,' as the
> Cantonese call them, in place of names that it is believed will grate
> or annoy, such mode of flattery being employed to ward off possible
> mischief, and also through fear of arousing jealousy or spite in
> maleficent spirits.(ii) Names are also changed with the object of
> confusing or deceiving the agents of disease, and even death itself.
> (iii) Certain rites, notably that of blood-brotherhood, are
> accompanied by exchange of names or adoption of new names; while in
> near connection with this is the substitution of new names for
> birth-names at the initiation ceremonies to which reference has been
> made.

> i\) The flattering and cajoling words in which barbaric man addresses
> the animals he desires to propitiate, or designs to kill, are due to
> belief in their kinship with him, and in the transmigration of souls
> which makes the beat a possible embodiment of some ancestor or another
> animal. Hence the homage paid to it while the man stands ready to
> spear or shoot it. Throughout the northern part of Eurasia, the bear

> Swedes, Lapps, Finns, and Esthonians apply the tenderest and most
> coaxing terms to him. The Swedes and Lapps avert his wrath by calling
> him the 'old man' and 'grandfather'; the Esthon speak of him as the
> 'broad footed,' but it is among the Finns that we find the most
> euphemistic names applied to him The forty sixth rune of the
> *Kalevala* has for its theme the capture and killing of the 'sacred
> Otso,' who is also addressed as the 'honey eater,' the 'fur-robed,'
> the 'forest apple,' who gives his life 'a sacrifice to Northland.'
> When he is slain, Wäinämöinen, the old magician-hero of the story,

> Tore his breast upon the branches,  
> Freely gave his life to others.'

> Thorpe says that in Swedish popular belief there are certain animals
> which should not at any time be spoken of by their proper names, but
> always with kind allusions. 'If any one speaks slightingly to a cat,
> or beats her, her name must not be uttered, for she belongs to the
> hellish crew, and is intimate with the Berg-troll in the mountains,
> where she often goes. In speaking of the cuckoo, the owl, and the
> magpie, great caution is necessary, lest one should be ensnared, as
> they are birds of sorcery. Such birds, also snakes, one ought not to
> kill without cause, lest their death be avenged; \[o\] and, in like
> manner, Mohammedan women dare not call a snake by its name lest it
> bite them.' The Swedes fear to tread on a toad, because it may be an
> enchanted princess. The fox is called 'blue-foot,' or 'he that goes in
> the forest'; among the Esthonians he is 'grey-coat'; and in
> Mecklenburg, for twelve days after Christmas, he goes by the name
> 'long-tail.' In<sup>1</sup> Sweden the seal is 'brother Lars,' and
> throughout Scandinavia the superstitions about wolves are numerous. In
> some districts during a portion of the spring the peasants dare not
> call that animal by his usual name, Varg, lest he carry off the
> cattle, so they substitute the names Ulf, Grahans, or 'gold-foot,'
> because in olden days, when dumb creatures spoke, the wolf said

> 'If thou callest me *Varg*, I will be wroth with thee,  
> But if thou callest me *of gold*, I will be kind to thee.'

> The Claddagh folk of Gaiway would not go out to fish if they saw a
> fox, \[p\] and the name is as unlucky as the thing. Hence Livonian
> fishermen (and the same superstition is prevalent from Ireland to
> Italy) fear to endanger the success of their nets by calling certain
> animals, as the hare, pig, dog, and so forth, by their common names;
> while the Esthonians fear to mention the hare lest their crops of flax
> should fail. In Annam the tiger is called 'grandfather' or 'lord'; and
> both in Northern Asia and Sumatra the same device of using some

> forbidden swine's flesh, they avoid the word pig altogether, and call
> that animal *dabchar acheer*, "the other thing." In Canton the
> porpoise or river-pig is looked upon as a creature of ill-omen, and on
> that account its name is tabooed.' \[q\]

> 'little pig' or 'little dog.' In India, especially when several male
> children have died in the family, boys are dressed as girls to avert
> further misfortune: sometimes a nose-ring is added as further device.
> Pausanias tells the story of the young Achilles wearing female attire
> and living among maidens, \[t\] and to this day the peasants of Achill
> Island (on the north-west coast of Ireland) dress their boys as girls
> till they are about fourteen years old to deceive the boy seeking
> devil. In the west of Ireland some phrase invocative of blessing
> should be used on entering a cottage, or meeting a peasant, or
> saluting a child, because this shows that one has no connection with
> the fairies, and will not bring bad luck. 'Any one who did not give
> the usual expressions, as *Màmdeud*, "God save you"; *Slaunter*, "your
> good health"; and *Boluary*, "God bless the work," was looked on with
> suspicion.' \[t\] A well-mannered Turk will not pay a compliment
> without uttering 'Mashallah'; an Italian will not receive one without
> saying the protective 'Grazia a Deó'; and the English peasant-woman
> has her 'Lord be wi' us' ready when flattering words are said about
> her babe. In each case the good power is invoked as protector against
> the dangers of fascination and other forms of the black art. \[u\]

> A survival of this feeling exists in the modern housewife's notion,
> that if she comments on the luck attaching to some household god,
> 'pride goes before a fall.' She may have exulted over the years in
> which a favourite china service has remained intact, and the next day,
> as she reaches down some of the pieces, the memory of her vaunting
> causes the hand to tremble, and the precious ware is smashed to atoms
> on the floor. It has been often remarked that if any mishaps attend a

> induces an anxious feeling on the part of those responsible for her
> safety, which often unnerves them in a crisis, and brings about the
> very calamity which they fear, and which under ordinary conditions
> could be averted.

> Among the Hindus, when a parent has lost a child by disease, which, as
> is usually the case, can be attributed to fascination or other
> demoniacal influence, it is a common practice to call the next baby by
> some opprobrious name, with the intention of so depreciating it that
> it may be regarded as worthless, and so protected from the evil eye of
> the envious. Thus a male child is called Kuriya, or 'dunghill';
> Khadheran or Ghasita, 'He that has been dragged along the ground';
> Dukhi or Dukhita, 'The afflicted one'; Phatingua, 'grasshopper';
> Jhingura, 'cricket'; BhIkra or BhIkhu, 'beggar'; Gharib, 'poor'; and
> so on. So a girl is called Andhri, 'blind'; Tinkouriyâ or
> Chhahkauriyâ, 'She that was sold for three or six cowry shells';
> Dhuriyâ, 'dusty'; Machhiyâ, 'fly,' and so on. All this is connected
> with what the Scots call 'fore-speaking,' when praise beyond measure,
> praise accompanied with a sort of amazement or envy, is considered
> likely to be followed by disease or accident. \[v\] In keeping with
> this is the story of the pessimist invalid who, admitting himself
> better to-day, added that he would not be so well to-morrow!

> \(ii\) In barbaric belief both disease and death are due to maleficent
> agents, any theory of natural causes being foreign to the savage mind;
> hence euphemisms to avert tile evil. The Dyaks of Borneo call the
> smallpox 'chief' or 'jungle leaves,' or say, 'Has he left you? ' \[w\]
> while the Cantonese speak of this 'Attila of the host of diseases' as
> 'heavenly flower' or 'good intention,' and deify it as a goddess. The
> Greeks call it Εύλογία, or 'she that must be named with respect.'
> 'Similarly, the Chinese deem ague to be produced by a ghost or spirit,
> and for fear of offending him they will not speak of that disease
> under its proper name.' \[x\] De Quincey has remarked on the avoidance
> of all mention of death as a common euphemism; and of this China is
> full of examples. In the *Book of' Rites* it is called 'the great
> sickness,' and when a man dies, he is said to have 'entered the
> measure,' certain terms being also applied in the case of certain
> persons. For example, the Emperor's death is called *pang*, 'the
> mountain has fallen'; when a scholar dies he is *pat luk*, 'without
> salary or emolument.' 'Collins' are tabooed under the term 'longevity
> boards.' \[y\] Mr. Giles says that 'boards of old age,' and 'clothes
> of old age sold here,' are common shop-signs in every Chinese city;
> death and burial being always, if possible, spoken of euphemistically
> in some such terms as these. \[z\]

> The belief that spirits know folks by their names further explains the
> barbaric attitude towards disease and death. In Borneo the name of a
> sick child is changed so as to confuse or deceive the spirit of the
> disease; the Lapps change a child's baptismal name if it falls ill,
> and rebaptize it at every illness, as if they thought to bamboozle the
> spirit by this simple stratagem of an alias. \[aa\] When the life of a

> seeks to get rid of his name, and sends to another member of the
> tribe, who goes to the chief and buys a new name, which is given to
> the patient. With the abandonment of the old name it is believed that

> patient becomes related to the Kwapa who purchased it. Any Kwapa can

> bad luck to attempt such a thing for the fifth time.' \[ab\] The
> Rabbis recommended the giving secretly of a new name, as a means of
> new life, to him who is in danger of dying.\[ac\] The Rev. Hilderic
> Friend vouches for the genuineness of the following story, the bearing
> of which on the continuity of barbaric and quasi-civilised ideas is
> significant:--'In the village of S--, near Hastings, there lived a
> couple who had named their first-born girl Helen. The child sickened
> and died, and when another daughter was born, she was named after her
> dead sister. But she also died, and on the birth of a third daughter
> the cherished name was repeated. This third Helen died, "and no
> wonder," the neighbours said; "it was because the parents had used the
> first child's name for the others." About the same time a neighbour
> had a daughter, who was named Marian because of her likeness toa dead
> sister. She showed signs of weakness soon after birth, and all said
> that she would die as the three Helens had died, because the name
> Marian ought not to have been used. It was therefore tabooed, and the

> As already observed, the importance and sanctity attached to blood

> covenants sealed by the drinking, or interfusing, or offering of
> blood. Any full account of these rites, notably on their sacrificial

> names, which sometimes accompanies them.

> Mr. Herbert Spencer remarks, that 'by absorbing each other's blood,

> its owner, 'to exchange names is to establish some participation in

> treaty with Colonel M'Kee, an American officer, as to certain
> concessions, he desired some ceremony of brotherhood to make the
> covenant binding, and, after some parleying, proposed an exchange of

> either, and to the day of his death insisted that his name, and,
> therefore, his identity, was lost. \[ah\] There is no small pathos in

> man's trickery, and in the utter muddle of his mind as to who and what

> TABOO ON NAMES OF KINGS AND PRIESTS

>  

> Avoidance and veneration superstitions gather force with the ascending
> rank of individuals. The divinity that 'doth hedge' both king and
> priest, which two offices were originally blended in one man,
> increases the power of the taboo. Until Mr. Frazer published his
> *Golden Bough*, the significance of this taboo, as applied to royal
> and sacerdotal persons, was somewhat obscure. But the large, indeed
> overcrowding, array of examples which his industry has collected and
> his ingenuity interpreted, make it clear that the priest-king was
> regarded as the incarnation of supernatural powers on whose unhindered
> and effective working the welfare of men depended. That being the
> belief, obviously the utmost care was used to protect in every
> possible way the individual in whom those powers were incarnated. As
> the *Golden Bough* does not come under the head of popular books in
> the sense of being widely read, although, within a limited circle,
> often quoted, it may be well to explain this barbaric theory of the
> spirit indwelling in man by citing the typical example which Mr.
> Frazer has chosen, and which gives its title to his book.

> Three miles from Aricia, an old town on the Alban Hills, a few miles
> from Rome, there was a famous grove and temple dedicated to Diana. The
> temple was on the northern shore of the lake under the cliffs on which
> the modern village of Nemi stands. The priest of that temple, which
> was held in high repute throughout Italy, was called Rex Nemorensis,
> or 'King of the Grove,' and, at least in later times, he was always a
> runaway slave. The strangest feature of the business was that he must
> be a murderer, because he could obtain the priestly office only by
> killing the man who held it, and, therefore, when he had secured it,
> he had to be always on the alert against being attacked. Lord
> Macaulay, in his poem of the 'Battle of Lake Regillus' (*Lays of
> Ancient Rome*), refers to this curious custom

> 'From the still, glassy lake that sleeps  
> Beneath Aricia's trees--  
> Those trees in whose dim shadow  
> The ghostly priest doth reign,  
> The priest who slew the slayer,  
> And shall himself be slain.'

> This priest-king kept special guard over a sacred tree, and if any
> runaway slave could succeed in breaking-off a branch from it, the
> priest was compelled to fight him in single combat. The existence of
> this custom within historical times is proved by the circumstance that
> the Emperor Caligula gave orders that the Rex Nemorensis, who during
> his reign had long been left unassailed, should be attacked and
> killed. But its origin and reason had then become forgotten, and it is
> only in our time that its connection with the groups of rites and
> ceremonies gathering round certain phases of nature-worship, notably
> tree-worship, has been established. In the general application of the
> barbaric conception of life indwelling in all things, and especially
> active where motion was apparent, and where growth, maturity, and
> decline marked the object, the tree was believed to be the abode of a
> spirit, while the priest was regarded as an incarnation of the
> tree-spirit on which the fruitfulness of the soil depended. We have
> seen how universal is the barbaric belief in real and vital connection
> between one living thing and another, and also between one non-living
> thing and another; and it is therein that the key is found to the
> belief that if the Rex Nemorensis was suffered to live on until he
> became decrepit by age, then the earth would become old and feeble
> also, the trees yielding no fruit and the fields no harvest.
> Therefore, to prevent this, the priest-king, as an incarnated god, was
> not allowed to reach old age; and when his waning strength was proved
> by his inability to hold his own against the aggressor, he was killed,
> and the divine spirit, with its power and vigour unimpaired, was
> believed to pass into his slayer and successor. The sacred tree, it
> may be added, from which the runaway slave sought to break off the
> 'Golden Bough '--the parasitic mistletoe, Mr. Frazer suggests--was
> probably an oak, the worship of which was general among the
> Aryan-speaking peoples of Europe. Tradition averred that the fateful
> branch which Aeneas plucked at the sibyl's bidding, before he essayed

> as, examined according to the custom of other nations, would be
> thought ridiculous and impertinent.' Like the high pontiff of the
> Zapotecs in South Mexico, his feet must never touch the ground; the
> sun must never shine on his naked head; he was required to sit
> motionless all the day so that tranquillity might be assured to his

> The children of every god came unto him in tears, Isis came with her

> make the dead to live. And she spake, saying, 'What hath come to pass,

> thing which thou hast created bath lifted up his head against thee.
> Verily it shall be cast forth by my healing words of power, and I will

> serpent which I saw not. Is it fIre? Is it water? I am colder than
> water, I am hotter than fire. All my flesh sweateth, I quake, my eye
> hath no strength, I cannot see the sky, and the sweat rusheth to my
> face even as in the time of summer.' Then said Isis unto Râ, 'O tell
> me thy name, holy father, for whosoever shall be delivered by thy name
> shall live.' \[And Râ said\], 'I have made the heavens and the earth,
> I have ordered the mountains, I have created all that is above them, I
> have made the water, I have made to come into being the great and wide

> the other on the left. Now, if any one were to go within and learn the

> from alarm and bewilderment he would lose his presence of mind and
> forget the Name.

> 'Now Jeshu left Upper Galilee and came secretly to Jerusalem, and he
> went into the Temple, and learned there the holy writing; and after he
> had written the incommunicable Name on parchment he uttered it, with
> intent that he might feel no pain, and then he cut into his flesh and
> hid the parchment with its inscription thereon. Then he uttered the
> Name once more, and made so that his flesh healed up again. And when
> he went out at the door the lions roared, and he forgot the Name.
> Therefore he hasted outside the town, cut into his flesh, took the
> writing out, and when he had studied the signs he retained the Name in
> his memory.' \[bv\]

> The second legend, which tells of an aerial conflict between Jeshu and
> Judas before Queen Helena (!), says that 'when Jeshu had spoken the
> incommunicable Name, there came a wind and raised him between heaven
> and earth. Thereupon Judas spake the same Name, and the wind raised
> him also between heaven and earth. And they flew, both of them, around
> in the regions of the air, and all who saw it marvelled. Judas then
