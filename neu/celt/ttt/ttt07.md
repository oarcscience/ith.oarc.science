BARBARIC IDEAS ABOUT NAMES

 

> BEFORE the discovery of iron; before the invention of the art of
> spinning; before the formulation of the theory of spirits, against
> whose wiles mortals might successfully plot,--men had found the
> necessity of inventing signs or symbols wherewith to distinguish one
> another. Among these was the choice of personal names, and it is in
> this that the justification exists for assuming the name-incident in
> 'Tom Tit Tot' to be probably the most archaic element in the story.
> Barbaric man believes that his name is a vital part of himself, and
> therefore that the names of other men and of superhuman beings are
> also vital parts of themselves. He further believes that to know the
> name is to put its owner, whether he be deity, ghost, r mortal, in the
> power of another, involving risk of harm or destruction to the named.
> He therefore takes all kinds of precautions to conceal his name, often
> from his friend, and always from his foe. This belief, and the
> resulting acts, as will be shown presently, are a part of that general
> confusion between the objective and the subjective--in other words,
> between names and things or between symbols and realities--which is a
> universal feature of barbaric modes of thought. This confusion
> attributes the qualities of living things to things not living; it
> lies at the root of all fetishism and idolatry; of all witchcraft,
> shamanism, and other instruments which are as keys to the invisible
> kingdom of the dreaded. Where such ideas prevail, everything becomes a
> vehicle of magic, and magic, be it remembered, rules the life of the
> savage. It is, as Adolf Bastian aptly remarks, 'the physics of mankind
> in a state of nature,' because in the perception, however blurred or
> dim, of some relation between things, science is born. To look for any
> consistency in barbaric philosophy is to disqualify ourselves for
> understanding it, and the theories of it which aim at symmetry are
> their own condemnation. Yet that philosophy, within its own irregular
> confines, works not illogically. Ignorant of the properties of things,
> but ruled by the superficial likenesses which many exhibit, the
> barbaric mind regards them as vehicles of good or evil, chiefly evil,
> because things are feared in the degree that they are unknown, and
> because, where life is mainly struggle, man is ever on the watch
> against malice-working agencies, wizards, medicine-men, and all their
> kin. That he should envisage the intangible--that his name should be
> an entity, an integral part of himself, may the less surprise us when
> it is remembered that language, from the simple phrases of common life
> to the highest abstract terms, rests on the concrete. To 'apprehend' a
> thing is to 'seize' or 'lay hold' of it; to 'possess' a thing is to
> 'sit by' or 'beset' it. To call one man a 'sycophant' is to borrow the
> term 'fig-blabber,' applied by the Greeks to the informer against
> those who broke the Attic law prohibiting the export of figs; to call
> another man 'supercilious' is to speak of him as 'raising his
> eyebrows'; while, as we all know, the terms 'disaster' and 'lunatic'
> preserve the old belief in the influence of the heavenly bodies on
> human life. Even the substantive verb 'to be,' the 'most bodiless and
> colourless of all our words,' is made up of the relics of several
> verbs which once had a distinct physical significance. 'Be' contained
> the idea of 'growing'; 'am, art, is,' and 'are,' the idea of
> 'sitting'; 'was' and 'were,' that of 'dwelling' or 'abiding.'
