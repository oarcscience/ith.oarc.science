WORDS OF POWER

 

> THERE is no essential difference between Names of Power and Words of
> Power, and the justification of any division lies wholly in its
> convenience. For although the implication may be that the one is
> associated with persons, and the other with things, we have sufficing
> evidence of the hopeless entanglement of the two in the barbaric mind.
> Both are regarded as effective for weal or woe through the magic power
> assumed to inhere in the names, and through the control obtained over
> them through knowledge of those names. In examining this attitude, it
> may be well to bear in mind what has been said already concerning
> magic as a primitive form of science; bad science, it is true, yet
> possessing the saving grace of some perception of possible relations
> between phenomena. For here the apparatus of the priest--prayer,
> sacrifice, and so forth--is superseded, or, at least, suspended, in
> favour of the apparatus of the sorcerer with his 'whole bag of tricks
> '--spells, incantations, curses, passwords, charms, and other
> machinery of white or black magic. In his invaluable Asiatic Studies,
> Sir Alfred Lyall remarks that among the lower religions 'there seem
> always to have been some faint sparks of doubt as to the efficacy of
> prayer and offerings, and thus as to the limits within which deities
> can or will interpose in human affairs, combined with embryonic
> conceptions of the possible capacity of man to control or guide Nature
> by knowledge and use of her ways, or with some primeval touch of that
> feeling which now rejects supernatural interference in the order and
> sequence of physical processes. Side by side with that universal
> conviction which ascribed to divine volition all effects that could
> not be accounted for by the simplest experience, and which called them
> miracles, omens, or signs of the gods, there has always been a remote
> manifestation of that less submissive spirit which locates within man
> himself the power of influencing things, and which works vaguely
> toward the dependence of man on his own faculties for regulating his
> material surroundings. \[a\]

> Words of Power, broadly classified, may be divided, with more or less
> unavoidable overlapping, into (a) Creative Words; (b) Mantrams and
> their kin; (c) Passwords; (d) Spells or Invocations for conjuring up
> the spirit of the dead, or for exorcising demons, or for removing
> spells on the living; and (e) Cure-Charms in formulae or magic words.
> Of each of these five intermingled classes a few examples will
> suffice.

> \(a\) CREATIVE WORDS

> The confusion of person and thing meets us at starting, and the
> deification of speech itself warrants its inclusion in this section.
> Probably the most striking example of such deification is the Hindu
> goddess Vãc, who is spoken of in the Rig Veda \[b\] as 'the greatest
> of all deities; the Queen, the first of all those worthy of worship,'
> and in one of the Brahmanas, or sacerdotal commentaries on the Vedas,
> as the 'mother '\[c\] of those sacred books. Another hymn to her
> declares that when she was first sent forth, all that was hidden, all
> that was best and highest, became disclosed through love. \[d\] By
> sacrifice Speech was thought out and found, and he who sacrifices to
> her 'becomes strong by speech, and speech turns unto him, and he makes
> speech subject unto himself.' \[e\] When Vãc declares--

> 'Whom I love I make mighty, I make him a Brãhman, a Seer, and Wise. .

> I have revealed the heavens to its inmost depths, I dwell in the
> waters and in sea,  
> Over all I stand, reaching by my mystic power to the height beyond.  
> I also breathe out like the wind, I first of all living things.  
> Beyond the heavens and this earth I have come to this great power,'
> \[f\]

> echoes of the sublime claims of Wisdom in the Book of Proverbs haunt
> the ear.

> 'The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of
> old.  
> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, ever the earth
> was.  
> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no
> fountains abounding with water.  
> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: am was daily his
> delight.' \[g\]

> In the Wisdom of Solomon, the high place of 'Chockmah' or Wisdom, as
> co-worker with the Deity, is still more prominent; in the Targums
> 'Memra' or 'Word' is one of the phrases substituted by the Jews for
> the great Name; while the several speculations concerning the nature
> and functions of Wisdom in the canonical and apocryphal books took
> orderly shape in t:he *Logos*, the Incarnate Word of God, of Saint
> John's Gospel. In Buddhism, *Manjusri* is the personification of
> Wisdom, \[h\] although in this connection we have to remark that this
> religion has no theory of the origin of things, and that for the
> nearest approach to the *Vãc* of Hinduism (as the possible influence
> of which on the wisdom the Book of Proverbs, and through it on Logos,
> nothing can be said here) we must cross into ancient Persia, in whose
> sacred books we read of Honovar or *Ahuna-variya*, the 'Creating Word'
> or the 'Word Creator.' When Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) asks Ahuramazda,
> the Good God of the Parsi religion, which was the word that he spoke
> 'before the heavens, the water, the earth, and so forth,' Ahuramazda
> answers by dwelling on the sacred Honovar, the mispronunciation of
> which subjects a man to dire penalties, while 'whoever in this my
> world supplied with creatures takes off in muttering a part of the
> Ahuna-variya, either a half, or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth of
> it, his soul will I, who am Ahuramazda, separate from paradise to such
> a distance in width and breadth as the earth is.' \[i\] In his
> translation of *Salaman and Absal*, wherein these lines occur,

> '. . . The Sage began,  
> O last new vintage of the vine of life  
> Planted in Paradise; O Master-stroke,  
> And all-concluding flourish of the Pen,  
> KUN-FA-YAKUTN,

> Edward FitzGerald appends as note on Kun-fa-Yakun, 'Be, and it is--the
> famous word of Creation stolen from Genesis by the Kurán.' In that
> book we read, 'The Originator of the heavens and the earth when He
> decrees a matter He doth but say, unto it, "BE," and it is,' \[j\]--a
> declaration which the Genesis creation-legend, doubtless a transcript
> \[k\] of Accadian originals, anticipates in the statement, 'And Elohim
> said, Let there be light, and there was light.' In this connection the
> three shouts of the Welsh, which created all things, should be noted.

> \(b\) MANTRAMS

> Dr. Wallis Budge remarks that among the magic formulae of which the
> ancient Egyptians made use for the purpose of effecting results
> outside man's normal power, was repetition of the names of gods and
> supernatural beings, certain ceremonies accompanying the same. For
> they believed that every word spoken under given circumstances must be
> followed by some effect good or bad. The same idea prompts the belief
> of the Irish peasant that a curse once uttered must alight on
> something; it will float in the air seven years, and may descend any
> moment on the party it was aimed at \[l\] Allied to this is the old
> Scandinavian belief that a curse is powerful unless it can be turned
> back, when it will harm its utterer, for harm some one it must. \[m\]
> The origin of the Egyptian superstition lies further back than Dr.
> Budge suggests, although he is probably correct in assuming that its
> development received impetus from the belief that the world and all
> things therein came into being immediately after Thoth, the god of
> writing, especially of sacred literature, had interpreted in words the
> will of the Deity in respect of the creation, and that creation was
> the result of the god's command. \[n\]

> Belief in the virtue of mystic phrases, faith in whose efficacy would
> seem to be increased in the degree that the utterers do not know their
> meaning, is world-wide. The old lady who found spiritual 'comfort in
> 'that blessed word, Mesopotamia,' has her representatives in both
> hemispheres, in the *matamanik* of the Red Indian and the *karakias*
> of the New Zealander, \[o\] while the Roman Catholic can double the
> number of beads on his rosary by exchanging strings with the Tibetan.
> The latter, as we know, fills his 'praying-wheels,' more correctly,
> praising-wheels, with charms or texts from his sacred books, the words
> of wonder-working power frequently placed therein, or emblazoned on
> silk flags, being 'Om Mani padme hum,' 'Ah, the jewel in the lotus,'
> i.e. 'the self-creative force is in the kosmos.'

> But most typical of all are the sacred formulas of the Hindus, the
> *mantrams* which are believed 'to enchain the power of the gods
> themselves.' They are charged with both bane and bliss; there is
> nothing that can resist their effect. At their bidding the demons will
> enter a man or be cast out of him, and the only test of their efficacy
> is supplied by themselves, since a stronger *mantram* can neutralise a
> weaker. 'The most famous and the most efficacious mantrani for taking
> away sins, whose power is so great that the very gods tremble at it,
> is that which is called the *gayatri*. It is so ancient that the Vedas
> themselves were born from it Only a Brahmin has the right to recite
> it, and he must prepare himself by the most profound meditation. It is
> a prayer in honour of the sun. There are several other *mantrams*
> which are called *gayatri*, but this is the one most often used.'
> \[p\] Next in importance to the *gayatri*, the most powerful
> *mantram*, is the monosyllable OM or AUM, to which reference has been
> made. But, all the world over, that which may have been the outcome of
> genuine aims has become the tool of necromancers, soothsayers, and
> their kin. These recite the mystic charms for the ostensible purpose
> of fortune-telling, of discovering stolen property, hidden treasure,
> and of miracle-mongering generally. Certain *mantrams* are credited
> with special power in the hands of those who have the key to the true
> pronunciation, reminding us of the race--test in the pronunciation of
> the old word *Shibboleth*. \[q\] To the rishis or sorcerers who know
> how to use and apply these *bija-aksharas*, as such *mantrams* are
> called, nothing is impossible. Dubois quotes the following story in
> proof of this from the Hindu poem, *Brahmottara-Kanda*, composed in
> honour of Siva:--'Dasarha, King of Madura, having married Kalavali,
> daughter of the King of Benares, was warned by the princess on their
> wedding-day that he must not exercise his rights as a husband, because
> the *mantram of the five letters* which she had learned had so
> purified her that no man could touch her save at the risk of his life,
> unless he had been himself cleansed from all defilement by the same
> word-charm. The princess, being his wife, could not teach him the
> *mantram*, because by so doing she would become his guru, and,
> consequently, his superior. So the next day both husband and wife went
> in quest of the great Rishi, or penitent Garga, who, learning the
> object of their visit, bade them fast one day and bathe the following
> day in the holy Ganges. This being done, they returned to the Rishi,
> who made the husband sit down on the ground facing the East, and,
> having seated himself by his side, but with face to the West,
> whispered these two words in his ear, "Namah Sivaya." Scarcely had
> Dasarha heard these marvellous words before a flight of crows was seen
> issuing from different parts of his body, these birds being the sins
> which he had committed.' \[r\]

> That the *mantrams* do not now work the startling effects of which
> tradition tells, is explained by the Brahmins as due to mankind now
> living in the Kali-Yuga, or Fourth Age of the World, a veritable age
> of Iron; but they maintain that it is still not uncommon for miracles
> to be wrought akin to that just narrated, and to this which follows.
> Siva had taught a little bastard boy the mysteries of the
> *bjja-akshara* or *mantram* of the five letters. The boy was the son
> of a Brahmin widow, and the stain on his birth had caused his
> exclusion from a wedding-feast to which others of his caste had been
> invited. He took revenge by pronouncing two or three of the mystic
> letters through a crack in the door of the room where the guests were
> assembled. Immediately all the dishes that were prepared for the feast
> were turned into frogs. Consternation spread among the guests, all
> being sure that the mischief was due to the little bastard, so,
> fearing that worse might happen, they rushed with one accord to invite
> him to come in. As he entered, they asked his pardon for the slight,
> whereupon he pronounced the same words backwards, \[s\] and the cakes
> and other refreshments appeared, while the frogs vanished. 'I will
> leave it,' remarks the Abbé, 'to some one else to find, if he can,
> anything amongst the numberless obscurations of the human mind that
> can equal the extravagance of this story, which a Hindu would
> nevertheless believe implicitly.' Were that veracious recorder of
> Oriental belief and custom alive, he would be supplied from the
> narratives of proceedings at spiritualist séances with examples of
> modern credulity as strong as those which he collected in the land on
> which the Mahatmas look down from their inaccessible peaks.

>  

> \(c\) PASSWORDS

> The famous Word of Power, 'Open, Sesame,' pales before the passwords
> given in the *Book of the Dead*, or, more correctly, *The Chapters of
> Coming Forth by Day*. This oldest of sacred literature, venerable four
> thousand years B.C., contains the hymns, prayers, and magic phrases to
> be used by Osiris (the common name given to the immortal counterpart
> of the mummy \[t\]) in his journey to Amenti, the underworld that led
> to the Fields of the Blessed. To secure unhindered passage thither,
> the deceased must know the secret and mystical names of the Gods of
> the Northern and Southern Heaven, of the Horizons, and of the Empyreal
> Gate. 'As the Egyptian made his future world a counterpart of the
> Egypt which he knew and loved, and gave to it heavenly counterparts of
> all the sacred cities thereof, he must have conceived the existence of
> a waterway like the Nile, whereon he might sail and perform his
> desired voyage.' Strangest evidence of the Egyptian extension of
> belief in Words of Power is furnished in the requirement made of the
> deceased that he shall tell the names of every portion of the boat in
> which he desires to cross the great river flowing to the underworld.
> Although there is a stately impressiveness throughout the whole
> chapter, the citation of one or two sentences must suffice. Every part
> of the boat challenges the Osiris:--

> 'Tell me my name,' saith the Rudder. 'Leg of Hapiu is thy name.'

> 'Tell me my name,' saith the Rope. 'Hair, with which Anubis finisheth
> the work of my embalmment, is thy name.'

> 'Tell us our names, say the Oar-rests. 'Pillars of the underworld is
> your name.'

> And so on; hold, mast, sail, blocks, paddles, bows, keel, and hull
> each putting the same question, the sailor, the wind, the river, and
> the river-banks chiming in, and the Rubric ending with the assurance
> to the deceased that if 'this chapter be known by him,' he shall 'come
> forth into Sekhet-Aarru, and bread, wine, and cakes shall be given him
> at the altar of the great god, and fields, and an estate . . . and his
> body shall be like unto the bodies of the gods.' \[u\]

> But the difficulties of the journey are not ended, because ere he can
> enter the Hall of the Two Truths, that is, of Truth and Justice, where
> the god Osiris and the forty-two judges of the dead are seated, and
> where the declaration of the deceased, that he has committed none of
> the forty-two sins, \[v\] is tested by weighing his heart in the
> scales against the symbol of truth, Anubis requires him to tell the
> names of every part of the doors, the bolts, lintels, sockets,
> woodwork, threshold, and posts; while the floor forbids him to tread
> on it until it knows the names of the two feet wherewith he would walk
> upon it. These correctly given, the doorkeeper challenges him, and,
> that guardian satisfied, Osiris bids the deceased approach and partake
> of 'the sepulchral meal.' Then after more name-tests are applied,
> those of the watchers and heralds of the seven ants or mansions, and
> of the twenty-one pylons of the domains of Osiris, the deceased 'shall
> be among those who follow Osiris triumphant. The gates of the
> underworld shall be opened unto him, and a homestead shall be given
> unto him, and the followers of Horus who reap therein shall proclaim
> his name as one of the gods who are therein.'

> \(d\) SPELLS AND AMULETS

> In the famous scene in *Macbeth*, when the witches make the 'hellbroth
> boil and bubble' in their 'caldron,' Shakespeare drew upon the
> folk-lore of his time. Two years before he came to London, Reginald
> Scot had published his *Discoverie of Witchcraft*, a work which, in
> Mr. Lecky's words, 'unmasked the imposture and delusion of the system
> with a boldness that no previous writer had approached, and an ability
> which few subsequent writers have equalled.' In that book may be found
> the record of many a strange prescription, of which other dramatists
> of Shakespeare's period, notably Middleton, Heywood, and Shadwell,
> made use in their thaumaturgic machinery. Scot's exposure of the
> 'impietie of inchanters' and the 'knaverie of conjurers' is
> accompanied by examples of a number of spells for raising the various
> grades of spirits, from the ghost of a suicide to the innumerable
> company of demons. In each case the effectiveness of the spell depends
> on the utterance of names which are a jumble of strange or
> manufactured tongues. For example, the spirits of the 'Airy Region'
> are conjured by 'his strong and mighty Name, Jehovah,' and by his
> 'holy Name, Tetragrammaton,' and by all his 'wonderful Names and
> Attributes, Sadat, Ollon, Emillat, Athanatos, Paracletus.' Then the
> exorcist, turning to the four quarters, calls the names, 'Gerson,
> Anek, Nephrion, Basannah, Cabon,' whereupon the summoned spirits,
> casting off their phantasms, will stand before him in human form to do
> his bidding, to bestow the gift of invisibility, foreknowledge of the
> weather, knowledge of the raising and allaying of storms, and of the
> language of birds. Then the exorcist dismisses them to their aerial
> home, in 'the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. \[w\]

> The witch of Endor secured the appearance of Samuel by the mere
> invocation of his name, a far simpler process \[x\] than availed the
> medieval necromancer, for he had to go to the grave at midnight with
> candle, crystal, and hazel wand on which the Name of God was written,
> and then, repeating the words, 'Tetragrammaton, Adonai, Agla, Crabon,'
> to strike on the ground three times with his wand, thereby conjuring
> the spirit into the crystal.

> The importance which the ancient Egyptians attached to dreams is well
> known. It was the universal belief that they were sent by the gods;
> and as matters of moment hinged on them, magic was brought into play
> to secure the desired dream. Among the formulae used for this purpose
> which survive is the following:--Take a cat, black all over, which has
> been killed: prepare a tablet, and write these words with a solution
> of myrrh, also the dream desired, which put in the mouth of the
> cat:--' Keimi, Keimi, I am the Great One, in whose mouth rests Mommon,
> Thoth, Nanumbre, Karikha …. the sacred Lanieê ien aëo eieeieiei
> aoeeo,' and so on in a string of meaningless syllables which were
> supposed to convey the hidden name of the god, and thereby make him
> subject to the magician. Then, as the conclusion, 'Hear me, for I
> shall speak the great Name, Thoth. Thy name answers to the seven
> vowels.'

> The Babylonian libraries have yielded a large number of incantations
> for use against evil spirits, sorcery, and human ills generally, the
> force of the magic conjurations being increased in the degree that
> they are unintelligible. For it is needful to preserve the old form of
> the name, because, although the meaning may be lost, another name, or
> a variation of it, would not possess the same virtue.

> The courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep,'

> these references to the superstitions that dominated the ancient
> civilisations of the East, and through them, in their elaborated
> magical forms, of the West, are of service to-day. That they persisted

> history is perception of the orderly sequence of phenomena; and that
> persistence also explains why like confusion prevails in communities

> unseen by the power of spoken words. The terrible curses which
> accompanied the once-dreaded excommunication have their pale echoes in
> our Commination Service (which to most persons nowadays only suggests
> the 'Jackdaw of Rheims'), and both are the outcome of the barbaric
> belief that the utterance of the word has a direct effect on the man
> against whom it is spoken. The belief in that power was extended to
> the written word. Reginald Scot gives the following charm 'against
> thieves,' which 'must never be said, but carried about one':--'I doo
> go, and I doo come unto you with the love of God, with the humility of
> Christ, with the holmes of our blessed ladle, with the faith of
> *Abraham*, with the justice of *Isaac* with the vertue of David, with

> To this class belong Gnostic amulets with the\~ cabalistic
> inscriptions; the Jewish phyIacteries or frontlets, whose virtue was
> supposed to rest in the texts shut up in the leathern case; amulets
> with the secret name of God chased on then worn by those very barbaric
> Christians, the Abyssinians, to avert the evil eye and ward off,

> effective talisman. Mr. Elworthy tells of a fright which he

> Iliad or the Aeneid; but, changing only the instrument while retaining
> the belief, *Sortes Homericae* and *Sortes Virgilinae* have been

> not be stolen from his tomb; while on others his name was engraved,
> because the blotting-out of a man's name brought with it his
> extinction. There is nothing new under the sun. At the burial of the

> \(e\) CURE-CHARMS

>  

> As gods of healing, both Apollo and Aesculapius were surnamed Paean,
> after the physician to the Olympian deities, and the songs which
> celebrate the healing power of Apollo were also called by that name.
> Ever in song have the deeper emotions found relief and highest
> expression, while the words themselves have been credited with magic
> healing power. The earliest fragment in the Book of Genesis is the
> song in which Lamech chants the 'slaying of a man to his wounding';
> and as the word charm (Lat. carmen, a song) itself indicates, the old
> incantations were cast in metrical form. Songs are the salve of
> wounds. When Odysseus was maimed by the boar's tusk, his kinsfolk sang
> a song of healing; and when Wäinamöinen, the hero-minstrel of the
> Kalevala, cut his knee in hewing the wood for the magic boat, he could
> heal the wound only by learning the mystic words that chant the secret
> of the birth of iron, while he could finish the stern and forecastle
> only by descending to Tuoni (the Finnish underworld) to learn the
> 'three lost words of the master.' \[ac\] The same old hero, when
> challenged to trial of song by the boastful youngster Joukahainen,
> plunges him deep in morass by the power of his enchantment, and
> releases him only on his promising to give him his sister Aino in
> marriage. \[ad\] In his Art of Poesie, written three centuries ago,
> Puttenham quaintly says that poetry 'is more ancient than the
> artificiall of the Greeks and Latines, coming by instinct of nature,
> and used by the savage and uncivill, who were before all science and
> civiltie. This is proved by certificate of merchants and travellers .
> . . affirming that the American, the Perusine, and the very canniball,
> do sing, and also say, their highest and holiest matters in certain

> being uttered, and then followed by these words: 'Even as this nail is
> firm in the wall and is not felt, so let the teeth of So-and-so, son
> of So-and-so, be firm in his mouth, and give him no pain.' In
> North-German charm-cures the three maidens (perchance echoes of the
> Norns) who dwell in green or hollow ways gathering herbs and flowers
> to drive away diseases may re-appear in the disguise to which we are
> accustomed in the angels of many a familiar incantation, as in this
> for scalds or burns--

> 'There were three angels came from East and West--  
> One brought fire and another brought frost,  
> And the third it was the Holy Ghost,  
> Out fire, in frost, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.'

> Brand gives a long list of saints whose names are invoked against

> whooping-cough to a house where the master and mistress are so named.
> 'The child must ask, or rather demand, bread and

> butter. Joseph must cut the bread, Mary must spread the butter and
> give the slice to the child, then a cure will certainly follow. In

> Society of St. Osmund--based on the theory that not only unclean
> swine, but the sweet flowers themselves, are the habitat of evil
> spirits. In the *Services of Holy Week from the Sarum Missal* the
> 'Clerks' are directed to 'venerate the Cross, with feet unshod,' and
> to perform other ceremonies which are preceded by the driving of the
> devil out of flowers through the following 'power of the word':

> 'I exorcise thee, creature of flowers or branches: in the Name of

> Lord, and in the power of the+Holy Ghost; and henceforth let all
> strength of the adversary, all the host of the devil, every power of
> the enemy, every assault of fiends, be expelled and utterly driven
> away from this creature of flowers or branches.' Here the flowers and
