TO IVOR AND MERTHYR.

My dear Children,

Infants as you yet are, I feet that I cannot dedicate more fitly than to
you these venerable relics of ancient lore, and I do so in the hope of
inciting you to cultivate the Literature of "Gwyllt Walia," in whose
beautiful language you are being initiated, and amongst whose free
mountains you were born.

May you become early imbued with the chivalric and exalted sense of
honour, and the fervent patriotism for which its sons have ever been
celebrated.

May you learn to emulate the noble qualities of Ivor Hael, and the firm
attachment to your Native Country, which distinguished that Ivor Back,
after whom the elder of you was named.

I am,

Your affectionate Mother,

C. E. GUEST.

Dowlais, *August* 29*th*, 1838.
