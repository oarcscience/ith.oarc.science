<p align="CENTER">TO IVOR AND MERTHYR</i>.</p> <i>
<p>My dear Children,</p> 
<p>Infants as you yet are, I feet that I cannot dedicate more fitly than to you these venerable relics of ancient lore, and I do so in the hope of inciting you to cultivate the Literature of "Gwyllt Walia," in whose beautiful language you are being initiated, and amongst whose free mountains you were born.</p> 
<p>May you become early imbued with the chivalric and exalted sense of honour, and the fervent patriotism for which its sons have ever been celebrated.</p> 
<p>May you learn to emulate the noble qualities of Ivor Hael, and the firm attachment to your Native Country, which distinguished that Ivor Back, after whom the elder of you was named.</p> 
<p>I am,</p> 
<p>Your affectionate Mother</i>,</p> <i>
<p align="RIGHT">C. E. GUEST</i>.</p> <i>
<p>Dowlais</i>, <i>August</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1838.</p>
