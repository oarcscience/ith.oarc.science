This is Lady Guests' translation of the Mabinogion. The Mabinogion is a
cycle of Welsh legends collected in the Red Book of Hergest, a
manuscript which is in the library of Oxford University. Mabinogion
means 'tales of youth'; although this appellation only applies to a few
of the stories, Lady Guest appropriated it as the title of this book,
and *The Mabinogion* is now used as the name of the entire collection.
The stories are based on historical characters and incidents from the
dark ages in Wales and environs, embellished with supernatural and
folklore elements. Throughout there are echoes of primordial Celtic
mythology and folklore, including the ancient gods and goddesses.

The first five tales are Welsh versions of incidents from the Arthurian
canon. The Mabinogion *per se* consists of the four connected narratives
(called 'the branches') from Pwll, Prince of Dyved, through Math, the
Son of Mathonwy. Following these are three additional stories, including
the legend of one of the most famous bards of Wales, Taliesin.

The Mabinogion is one of the masterpieces of world literature, and a
must-read for anyone who wants to have an understanding of Celtic lore.

One minor barrier for some readers may be the spelling of Welsh,
particularly in place names and names of people. In a nutshell, 'w' and
'y' are vowels, pronounced like 'u' and 'i' respectively. Technically,
double 'l' is voiceless; rest assured, 'Ll' at the start of a word is
not a typo. So 'Pwyll', which on the face of it doesn't appear to have
any vowels, can be thought of as being pronounced *approximately* like
'poo-eel'.

*PRODUCTION NOTES*: This version is up to current site standards, and
includes anchored page numbers, linked foot- and end-notes, and so on.
This version includes all of the endnotes which are omitted from
previous etexts of this book, and corrects several errors in the body
text. [Unicode](../../../unicode.md) is used through this text to display
archaic orthography.
