### NOTES TO THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN.

<span id="xref_3a">3a</span> ARTHUR.--*Page* [3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

AMONG the various characters introduced into the foregoing tale, none is
more strictly and successfully maintained than that of Arthur. In him we
see the dignified and noble-hearted sovereign, the stately warrior, and
the accomplished knight, courteous of demeanour and dauntless in arms.
And whilst the lofty bearing of the monarch himself excites our
admiration, we are scarcely less struck with the devoted attachment
evinced towards him by his knights, who are ever solicitous that he
should be the last to encounter danger, and ever ready themselves to
dare the most perilous adventures to uphold the dignity of his crown.
But it is not merely the consistency observed in these several
characters that arrests our attention in this and similar compositions
professing to record the achievements of Arthur and his knights; we are
also forcibly struck with the powerful influence which those legends
exercised over society, and the ascendancy which their principal hero so
decidedly maintained. Nor can we withhold our wonder at the singular
destiny which has awaited this extraordinary being. Whilst by some his
very existence has been called in question, his name has become
celebrated throughout the civilised world; and his exploits, whether
fabulous or real, have afforded the most ample and interesting materials
to the poet, the antiquary, and the historian. To this very day the
memory of the mighty warrior, "whose sword extended from Scandinavia to
Spain," exercises a power over our imagination which we are as unable as
we are unwilling to dispel. His image adorned our earliest visions of
Chivalry and Romance, and though the weightier cares of maturer age must
supervene, they serve but to deepen, not to efface the impression; and
while in the eddying stream of life we pause to look back upon the days
when Caerlleon and its Round Table formed to us an ideal

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

world, we feel that, in our hearts at least, "King Arthur is not dead."

The real history of this chieftain is so veiled in obscurity, and has
led to so much unsatisfactory discussion, that I shall in this place
only consider him with reference to the position which he occupies in
the regions of Fiction.

Amongst the many incidents of a highly imaginative character, in the
legendary history of Arthur, we may more particularly notice his
introduction upon the scene of his exploits.

During the turbulent times which followed the death of Uther Pendragon,
the nobles of Britain assembled to elect a successor to him, but, after
protracted debate, they were unable to come to any decision upon the
subject. At length a large stone was discovered near the place of
assembly, in which was a sword fastened as it were in a sheath. Around
it was an inscription in gold letters, signifying that whoever should
draw out that sword was rightful heir to the throne. After all those who
were ambitious of this dignity had made the attempt in vain, Arthur, who
was previously unknown, came forward, and drew out the sword from the
stone as easily as he would have drawn it out of the scabbard. He was
thereupon immediately acknowledged king.

Being thus placed at the head of the Chivalry of Britain, he proceeded
in a glorious and triumphant career, until, by the treachery of his
nephew, Modred, he sustained a defeat in the battle of Camlan.

After witnessing the destruction of his army in that fatal conflict,
Arthur, finding himself mortally wounded, delivered his sword to
Caliburn one of his knights, with a request that he would cast it into a
certain lake. The knight, thus commissioned, proceeded to the appointed
spot, and, standing upon the bank, flung the sword forward with all his
might. As it was descending, a hand and arm came out of the lake, and
seizing it by the hilt brandished it three times, and disappeared with
it in the water.

Arthur was afterwards conducted by the Knight to the border of the lake,
where he found a little bark moored, in which were Viviane, the Lady of
the Lake, and Morgan le Fay, and other ladies, who carried him off to
the Island of Avalon, in Fairy-laud, where it was affirmed that he was
healed of his wounds, and continued to live in all the splendour of that
luxurious country, waiting for the time when he should return once more
to take possession of his ancient dominions.

In confirmation of this idea it was asserted that the place of his

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

sepulture was not known. This tradition was current for many ages, and
is found among the Welsh, in the Memorials of the Graves of the
Warriors,--

"The grave of March is this, and this the grave of Gwythyr.  
Here is the grave of Gwgawn Gleddyfrudd  
But unknown is the grave of Arthur." <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

Our English ears are so familiarized with the name of *King* Arthur,
that it seems impossible to give him the appellation of Emperor, by
which he is designated in the original Welsh, and to which, according to
the old Romances, he was fully entitled, since once upon a time, "at
crystemas," he was crowned "Emperour with creme as it bylongeth to so
hyhe astate."--Morte d'Arthur.

We find the title of Emperor bestowed upon Arthur in Llywarch Hên's
Elegy upon Geraint ab Erbin.

"At Llongborth were slain to Arthur  
Valiant men, who hewed down with steel;  
He was the emperor, and conductor of the toil of war."  
                                        OWEN'S Heroic Elegies.

 

<span id="xref_3b">3b</span> CAERLLEON UPON USK.--Page
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

THIS place derives its name from the circumstance of its being the
station of the Second Legion (Legio Secunda Augusta) during the dominion
of the Romans. The name by which they originally called it was Isca
Silurum, evidently from its situation upon the river Usk; but by later
Latin writers it is named Urbs Legionum, which probably is a translation
of the Welsh Caer-lleon, and not the original of that appellation. This
place still exhibits many traces of Roman magnificence, and among others
the remains of an amphitheatre. It is natural to suppose that, upon the
departure of the Legions, Caerlleon would attract the attention of the
native Sovereigns, who were at that time beginning to resume their
power; accordingly, tradition informs us that it was the principal
residence of King Arthur; and the amphitheatre is still called Arthur's
Round Table. In confirmation of this traditionary evidence, Nennius
asserts that one of Arthur's battles was fought at *Cairlion*.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

In the old English version of this tale the opening scene is laid at
Cardiff.

"He made a feste, the soth to say,  
Opon the Witsononday,  
At Kerdyf, that es in Wales."--line 17.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And on a
subsequent occasion we find the City of Chester named--

"The kyng that time at Cester lay."--line 1567.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the French
Copy,-

"Q' li rois cort a cestre tint."

Of CHESTER it may be remarked, that it bears in Welsh the name of
*Caerlleon Gawr*, which seems to indicate its having been the station of
the Twentieth Legion, called *Legio Vicesima Valens Victrix*, the word
*Gawr* being nearly equivalent to the Latin *Valens*.

 

<span id="xref_3c">3c</span> OWAIN THE SON OF URIEN.--*Page*
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

OWAIN AB URIEN RHEGED.--AMONGST all the characters of ancient British
history, none is more interesting, or occupies a more conspicuous place,
than the hero of this tale. Urien, his father, was prince of Rheged, a
district comprising the present Cumberland and part of the adjacent
country. His valour and the consideration in which he was held, are a
frequent theme of Bardic song, and form the subject of several very
spirited odes by Taliesin, particularly those upon the battles of
Gwenystrad and Argoed Llwyfein, which are given, with English
translations, in the Myvyrian Archaiology, i. 52, 3, 4. The name of
Fflamddwyn, the flame-bearer, which occurs in these poems, is supposed
to be that by which the Welsh designated Ida, the Anglian King of
Northumberland. In the Appendix to Gale's Nennius, it is mentioned that
Urien was one of the four Northern princes who opposed the progress of
Deodric the Son of Ida. Urien besieged the latter in the island of
Lindisfarne. The other princes were Rhydderch Hael, Gwallawc ap Llenawc,
and Morcant, <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) the latter of whom being
jealous of Urien's military skill, in which he is

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

said to have excelled all the other kings, procured his assassination
during the expedition.

According to Llywarch Hen's Elegy upon Urien Rheged, this event occurred
in a place called Aberlleu. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

The Triads mention Llovan Llawdivo as the assassin. Of him little is
known; but that he was a person of some note is evident from the
circumstance of his grave being recorded.

"The grave of Llovan Llawdivo  
is on the strand of Menai, where makes the wave a sullen sound." <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md)

"The Genealogy of the Saints records that Urien came into South Wales,
and Was instrumental with the sons of Ceredig ab Cunedda, and his
nephews, in expelling the Gwyddelians, who had gained a footing there
from about the time of Maxen Wledig."--Camb. Biog.

The old Romancers connect him with South Wales, and call him King Uryens
of Gore, evidently intended for Gower in Glamorganshire.

Thus it is recorded in the Morte d'Arthur, "Thenne the Kyng remeued in
to Walys, and lete crye a grete feste that it shold be holdyn at
Pentecost after the incoronacion of hym at the Cyte of Carlyon, vnto the
feste come kyng Lott of Lowthean, and of Orkeney with fiue C knygtes
with hym. Also there come to the feste kynge Uryens of gore with four C
knyghtes with hym."

But to return to Owain; it appears from the manner in which he is always
mentioned by contemporary Bards, that he greatly distinguished himself
in his country's cause, subsequently to the death of his father, but
with what ultimate success we are not acquainted.

There exists an ancient Poem, printed among those of Taliesin, called
the Elegy of Owain ap Urien, and containing several very beautiful and
spirited passages. It commences,

The soul of Owain ap Urien  
May its Lord consider its exigencies,--  
Reged's chief the green turf covers."

In the course of this Elegy, the Bard bursts forth with all the energy
of the Awen,

"Could Lloegria sleep with the light upon her eyes?" <span
id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5.md)

 

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Alluding to the
incessant warfare with which this chieftain, during his lifetime, had
harassed his Saxon foes.

In the Myvyrian Archaiology (II. 80) we have the following Triad
relating to him.

"Three Knights of battle were in the Court of Arthur; Cadwr, the Earl of
Cornwall; Lancelot du Lac; <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) and Owain
the son of Urien Rheged. And this was their characteristic, that they
would not retreat from battle, neither for Spear, nor for Arrow, nor for
Sword, and Arthur never had shame in battle, the day he saw their faces
there, and they were called the Knights of Battle."

Owain is also mentioned with Rhun mab Maelgwn, and Rhufawn befr mab
Deorath Wledig, as one of the Three blessed Kings; <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) and in the 52nd Triad, we are informed that
his Mother's name was Modron, the daughter of Afallach, and that he was
born a twin with his sister Merwydd, or Morvyth, to whom Cynon ap
Clydno's attachment is well known.

His place of sepulture is thus mentioned in the Graves of the Warriors.

"The grave of Owain ap Urien is of quadrangular form,  
Under the turf of Llan Morvael."

Frequent allusions are made to Owain by the Bards of the Middle Ages,
especially by Lewis Glyn Cothi, who in an ode to Gruffudd ap Nicholas, a
powerful chieftain of Carmarthenshire, and one of the descendants of
Urien Rheged, has, among other things, the following passage:

"Gruffudd will give three ravens of one hue,  
And a white lion to Owain, \[his son\]."--I. 133.

The Editor of the works of Glyn Cothi supposes that "this expression may
allude to Griffith presenting his son with a shield, with his own arms
emblazoned upon it, and the royal lion for a

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

crest," The three ravens undoubtedly apply to the armorial bearings of
Urien Rheged, which are still borne by his descendants of the House of
Dynevor; the lion also may have been an heraldic bearing of the family,
but I am inclined to think that the Bard here intended an allusion to
one of the principal incidents of the Lady of the Fountain. That he was
acquainted with this Tale is evident, from some lines occurring in one
of his Poems, addressed to Thomas ap Philip of Picton Castle, in which
Owain and Luned are mentioned together.

In the early French compositions, called Lays and Fabliaux, Owain's name
frequently occurs. He is mentioned in the Lay of Lanfal, and in Court
Mantel, where he is particularized for his love of dogs and hawks.

"Li rois prit par la destre main  
L'amiz monsegnor Ivain,  
Qui au roi Urien fu filz,  
Et bons chevaliers et hardiz  
Qui tant ama chiens et oisiaux."  
  (Fab. MSS. du roi, n. 7615, fol. 114 recto, col. 3.)

He acts a conspicuous part in the Romances of the Round Table; and it is
on such authority that Ste. Palaye celebrates him, "pour avoir introduit
l'usage des fourrures ou zibelines aux manteaux, des ceintures aux
robes, et des boucles pour attacher les éperons et Den, et pour avoir
encore inventé la mode des gants."

 

<span id="xref_3d">3d</span> KYNON THE SON OF CLYDNO.--*Page*
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

CYNON AP CLYDNO EIDDIN.--This ancient British Warrior is celebrated in
the Triads as one of the Three wisely-counselling Knights of Arthur's
Court.

'Three counselling Knights were in the Court of Arthur, which were Cynon
the son of Clydno Eiddin, Aron the son of Kynfarch ap Meirchion gul, and
Llywarch hen the son of Elidir Lydanwyn. And these three knights were
the Counsellors of Arthur, and whatever dangers threatened him in any of
his wars, they counselled him, so that none was able to overcome Arthur;
and thus he conquered all the nations through three things which
followed him; and these were, Good hope, and the consecrated arms which
had been sent him, and the virtue of his warriors; and through these he
came to wear twelve crowns upon his head, and he became Emperor of
Rome."

And in another place it is added,

"And he had nothing but success when he acted by the advice

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

which he received from them, and reverses when he did not follow their
counsel."

Kynon is also called one of the three ardent Lovers, on account of his
passion for Morvyth, daughter of Urien Rheged, and sister of Owain, the
Hero of this Tale.

"The three ardent lovers of the Island of Britain, Caswallawn the son of
Beli for Flur the daughter of Mugnach Gorr, and Trystan the son of
Talluch for Yseult the wife of March Meirchawn his uncle, and Kynon the
son of Clydno Eiddin for Morvyth the daughter of Urien."

This warrior is mentioned by Aneurin,

"And Kynon------like rushes they fell before his hand.------  
O son of Clydno, a song of lasting praise will I sing unto thee."

And it is probable that he was one of the three, who, together with the
Bard himself, escaped from the disastrous battle of Cattraeth.

The Warriors who went to Cattraeth were renowned;  
Wine and Mead out of golden goblets was their beverage.  
That year was to them. one of exalted dignity,  
Three warriors and three score and three hundred, wearing the golden
torques-------  
Of those who marched forth after the excess of revelling,  
But three escaped from the conflict of gashing weapons;  
The two War-dogs of Aeron and *Kynon* the dauntless,  
(And I myself from the spilling of blood) worthy are they of my song."

Gray has given a poetical version of this passage in his fragments,
commencing with the words, "To Cattraeth's vale in glittering row."

Also, in another poem by Aneurin, named the Gwarchan (or Incantation) of
Cynvelyn, are the following lines:

"Three Warriors and three score and three hundred,  
To the conflict of Cattraeth went forth.  
Of those who hastened from the banquet of mead,  
Three only returned,  
Kynon, and Kadreith, and Katlew of Catnant,  
And I myself from the shedding of blood."

Kynon is frequently mentioned by the bards of the Middle Ages, and
celebrated both for his bravery and for his devotion as a lover.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is in the
latter character that be is alluded to by Gruffudd ap Meredith, in the
beginning of the fourteenth Century, who compares the force of his own
passion to that of Kynon for Morvyth, and that of Uther Pendragon for
the fair Ygrayne.

"As the sigh of Uther for the love of Ygraine, the fair and splendid,  
And the sigh of Kynon for the love of the beauteous daughter of Urien,  
Such is the sigh of the bard for the lovely object of his affections.  
                                                       Myv. Arch.

In the Memorials of the Graves of the Warriors, the following stanza
records the place of the sepulture of Kynon.

"The grave of a warrior of high renown  
Is in a lofty region--but a lowly bed,  
The grave of Kynon the son of Clydno Eiddin."

In another stanza, the term lowly bed seems to be explained, and it
would appear that a little hollow among the mountains was meant:

Whose is the grave beneath the hill?  
It is the grave of a warrior valiant in the conflict  
The grave of Kyrion the son of Clydno Eiddin."

 

<span id="xref_3e">3e</span> CLYDNO.--*Page* [3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

CLYDNO EIDDIN, the father of Cynon.--But little is known of the history
of this Chieftain, although as late as the fourteenth Century, his name
is found recorded by the Bards, in such terms as to make it evident that
he still continued to [occupy](errata.htm#0.md) a place of considerable
distinction among the heroes of the Principality, as may be seen in a
poem by Risierdyn, a bard who flourished about the year 1300. In this
poem, which records the burial of Hywel ap Gruffudd in the Church of St.
Benno, that Warrior is compared in point of bravery, to Clydno.

"The red-weaponed chief, the ruler of the golden region of costly
wine,  
Saint Beuno's blessed choir now conceals;  
The mighty high-famed leader, daring as *Clydno*.  
Silent are his remains within their oaken cell."  
                                        Myv. Arch. I. 432.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span id="xref_3f">3f</span> KAI THE SON OF KYNER.--*Page*
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

CAI AP CYNYR.--According to the Welsh pedigrees, Kai was the son of
Cynyr Cainvarvawc, the son of Gwron, the son of Cunedda Wledig. In the
Triads he is called one of the three diadem'd chiefs of battle, and is
said to have been possessed of magical powers, by which he could
transform himself into any shape he pleased. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) Of his real history, however, nothing is
known. It is supposed that Caer Gai, in North Wales, bear his name; and
it was the opinion of Iolo Morganwg, that the place of his sepulture was
at Cai Hir, at Aberavan, in Glamorganshire.

In the Brut he is called the *Dapifer*, or Sewer of King Arthur. And in
the French Romances he is mentioned as the Seneschal, and is styled
*Messire Queux*, and *Maitre Queux*, or *Keux*--the original name being
evidently altered in this manner in order to adapt it to his office of
Chief of the Cooks. In these productions, his general character is a
compound of valour and buffoonery: always ready to fight, and generally
getting the worst of the battle.

There is much that is very entertaining concerning him in the Morte
d'Arthur, particularly a story of his want of courtesy to Sir Gareth,
Gwalchmai's (Gawain's) brother, which led him into trouble.

"Whan Arthur held his round table moost plenour, it fortuned that he
commaunded that the hyhe feest of Pentecost shold be holden at a cyte
and a Castel the whiche in tho dayes was called kynke kenadonne upon the
sondes that marched nyghe walys." Upon this occasion, a youth who would
not declare his name, presented himself before Arthur, and craved a
boon, which the monarch immediately promised to grant. The boon he asked
was, that he should be allowed meat and drink for the space of a
twelvemonth in the King's palace. This the King considered a very
unworthy petition, and counselled him to ask something more honourable,
but the youth still persisted in his request. "Well sayde the kynge ye
shal haue mete and drynke ynouz, I neuer deffended y<sup>t</sup> none,
nother my frende ne my foo." "Thenne the kyng betook hym to sir Kay the
steward and charged hym that he shold gyue hym of al manner of metes and
drynkes of the best, and also that he hadde al maner of fyndynge as
though he were a lordes sone. That shal lytel nede sayd syr Kay to doo
suche

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

cost upon hym. For I dare undertake he is a vylayne borne, and neuer
will make man, for and he had come of gentylmen he wold haue axed of you
hors and armour, but such as he is so he asketh. And sythen he hath no
name, I shall yeue hym a name that shall be Beaumayns that is fayre
handes, and in to the kechen I shalle brynge hym, and there he shalle
haue fatte broweys euery day y<sup>t</sup> he shall be as fatte by the
twelue monethes ende as a porke hog." So Sir Kai "scorned hym and mocked
hym."

At the end of the twelvemonth, Beaumayns desired to be knighted, in
order to achieve a certain perilous adventure; <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) and Sir Kai called him a "kechyn knave." And
when the young man left the Court, to set out on his expedition, Kai
armed himself and followed him, thinking to vanquish him without
difficulty, and bring him to disgrace. But Beaumayns unhorsed Sir Kai,
and took possession of his arms, with which he performed several gallant
exploits to the great surprise of all, inasmuch as he was taken by his
shield to be Sir Kai, whose prowess was by no means in high repute.
Afterwards Beaumayns proved to be Sir Gareth of Orkney, the son of King
Lot, and brother of Sir Gawain.

 

<span id="xref_3g">3g</span> GWENHWYVAR.--Page [3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

ACCORDING to the Welsh Legends, Arthur had three queens, one of whom was
daughter of Gwythyr ap Greidiol, another of Gwryd Gwent, and a third of
Gogyrvan Gawr; and each of them bore the name of Gwenhwyvar. Concerning
the latter lady, <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) the following
couplet is still current in the Principality:--

"Gwenhwyvar, the daughter of Gogyrvan the Giant,  
Bad when little, worse when great."

This confusion of names and persons is only what might be expected from
the mass of traditionary matter that has accumulated among the Welsh. As
the exploits of Arthur began to assume a fabulous character, it is
evident that many of the more ancient legends of Britain became blended
with those of the Round Table, and perhaps

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

some of the mythological traditions of the Druidic age are to be found
amongst them. This continual accession of fable tends to render still
more obscure that which a redundancy of imagination had already
sufficiently involved.

The name of Gwenhwyvar, under the various forms of *Guenever*,
*Genievre*, and *Geneura*, must be familiar to all who are conversant
with chivalric lore. And it is to her adventures, and those of her true
knight, Sir Lancelot, that Dante alludes in the beautiful episode of
Francesca da Rimini.

 

<span id="xref_3h">3h</span> PORTER.--*Page* [3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

THE absence of a Porter was formerly considered as an indication of
hospitality, and as such is alluded to by Rhys Brychan, a bard who
flourished at the close of the fifteenth century.

"The stately entrance is without porters,  
And his mansions are open to every honest man."

Lewis Glyn Cothi also (about 1450), in an eulogium upon Owain, the son
of Gruffudd ap Nicholas, says, that his establishment was complete in
every respect, with the exception of a Porter:--

"Every officer there is to the great Knight  
Of the South, except a Porter."--I. 139.

 

<span id="xref_3i">3i</span> GLEWLWYD GAVAELVAWR.--*Page*
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

"THE dusky hero of the mighty grasp" is said to have escaped from the
battle of Camdan by means of his extraordinary strength and stature.
There is nothing of his real history known: indeed, from the
construction of his name, he appears to be altogether a fictitious
character; and it is not impossible that he may be one of those
mythological personages who formed the subjects of the Welsh legendary
tales, before the adventures of Arthur had assumed the character of
fiction, and that when those adventures became objects of fabulous
composition, this and other ancient Druidical traditions were
incorporated with them.

Among the Bardic remains there is a poem, called a Dialogue betwixt
Arthur and Kai, and Glewlwyd, some lines in which are considered by
Davies to have reference to some Druidical mysteries. Although it may
appear presumptuous to differ from

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

so high an authority, I shall venture to give the following translation-

"Who is the Porter?  
Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr.  
Who is it that asks?  
Arthur and the blessed Kai.  
If thou shouldst bring with thee  
The best wine in the world,  
Into my house thou shalt not come,  
Unless it be by force, &c."

 

<span id="xref_3j">3j</span> ON A SEAT OF GREEN RUSHES.--Page
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

THE use of green rushes in apartments was by no means peculiar to the
Court of Caerleon upon Usk. Our ancestors had a great predilection for
them, and they seem to have constituted an essential article, not only
of comfort but of luxury. The custom of strewing the floor with rushes
is well known to have existed in England during the Middle Ages, and
that it also prevailed in the Principality we have evidence from
allusions which occur in the works of native writers. Of this, one
example will suffice, from a tale written apparently in the 14th
Century; and as the passage contains several curious traits of ancient
manners, I shall give it at some length.

In this tale Davydd ap Owain Gwynedd, Prince of North Wales, wishing to
send an embassy to Rhys, Prince of South Wales, and having fixed upon
Gwgan the Bard as a proper person for that mission, despatches a
messenger called *y Paun Bach* (the Little Peacock) in search of him.
This person, after a long and tedious journey, arrives towards the close
of evening at a house in a wooded valley, where he hears the tuning of a
harp. From the style of playing, and the modulation, he supposes that
the performer can be no other than Gwgan himself. In order to ascertain
if his surmise is correct, be addresses him in a rambling high-flown
style of language. The Bard answers him in the same strain, and asks him
what he requires. To which Y Paun Bach thus replies:--"I want lodging
for to-night ...... And that not better than I know how to ask for.
...... A lightsome hall, floored with tile, and swept, in which there
has been neither flood nor rain-drop for the last hundred years, dressed
with *fresh green rushes*, laid so evenly that one rush be not higher
than the other the height of a gnat's eye, so that my foot should not
slip either backward or forward the space of a mote in the sunshine

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

of June. Then I would have a chair with a cushion beneath me, and a

Bach then goes on to describe the entertainment he desires to have. The

In France, the practice of strewing rushes on the floor was also
prevalent. We find the Seigneur Amanieu des Escas giving his
instructions to the young men of his household on the Art of Love, "dans
sa salle bien jonchée."--Poésies Provençales, cited by Ste. Palaye, I.

<span id="xref_3k">3k</span> FLAME-COLOURED SATIN.--Page
[3](mab05.htm#page_3.md).

THE literal translation of this expression is yellow-red. With regard to
this mixture of colours, Ellis, in his notes to Way's Fabliaux, remarks,
"The old French writers speak also of *pourpre* and *écarlate blanches*
(*white crimson*); of *pourpre sanguine* (*sanguine crimson*); and, in
the Fabliau de Gautier d'Aupais, mention is made of "*un vert mantel
porprin*, (*a mantel of green crimson*)." Hence, M. Le Grand
conjectures, "that the crimson dye being, from its costliness, used only
on cloths of the finest manufacture, the term crimson came at length to
signify, not the *colour*, but the *texture*, of the stuff. Were it
allowable to attribute to the Weavers of the Middle Ages the art now
common amongst us, of making what are usually called *shot* silks (or
silks of two colours, predominating interchangeably as in the neck of
the drake or pigeon), the contradictory compounds above given (*white*
crimson, *green* crimson, &c.) would be easily accounted for." II. 227.

LITERALLY, "desert places, and the extremities of the earth." It is
possible that some peculiar district of romantic geography was intended
to be here alluded to, since we find that "la terre deserte" was
formerly a kingdom of no inconsiderable importance, the sovereign of
which, named Claudas, overran the territories of King Ban of Benoic, one
of Arthur's allies in Gaul. And in the Morte d'Arthur, it is said that
Arthur, being wounded in the battle of Camlan, was conveyed to the
Island of Avalon "in a shyppe wherin were thre quenes, that one was kyng
Arthurs syster quene Morgan le fay, the other was the quene of North
galys, the thyrd was the quene of the waste londes. Also there was
Nynyue (Viviane) the chyef lady of the lake," &c.

 

<span id="xref_4b">4b</span> TREES OF EQUAL GROWTH.--*Page*
[4](mab05.htm#page_4.md).

THIS species of scenery appears to have been much admired by our
ancestors.

A similar description occurs in a chivalric tale of considerable
interest, by Gruffydd ab Adda, a Bard who was killed at Dolgellau, about
1370.

"In the furthermost end of this forest he saw a level green valley, and
trees of equal height, &c."

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

Chaucer describes a bower in the same style, in his Flour and Leaf. It
was composed of "sicamour and eglatere,"

Wrethen in fere so well and cunningly  
That every branch and leafe grew by mesure  
Plaine as a bord, of *an height by and by*."

The whole account which he gives us of the "pleasaunt herber" is very
poetical, particularly the following beautiful lines, descriptive of the
avenues of "okes" which led to it.

"In which were okes great, streight as a line,  
Under the which the grasse so fresh of hew  
Was newly sprong, and an eight foot or nine  
Every tree well fro his fellow grew,  
With branches brode, laden with leves new,  
That sprongen out agen the sunne-shene,  
Some very red, and some a glad light grene."

PALI MELYN.--The exact signification of the word Pali in the original is
not quite obvious, as it sometimes seems to imply satin and sometimes
velvet, according to the rank of the persons who are represented as
wearing it. Nor is the question so immaterial as at first sight it may
appear; for, in the best days of Chivalry, the most exact etiquette was
observed by the different grades of society with regard to the materials
of which their dress was composed. Ste. Palaye mentions that, on
occasions where the Knights wore cloth of damask, the Squires were
restricted to dresses of satin; and where the Knights were clothed in
velvet, the Squires could only appear in cloth of damask. The colour of
scarlet was permitted to be worn only by Knights. (I. 247, 283.)

 

<span id="xref_5a">5a</span> SINEWS OF THE STAG.--*Page*
[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

MOSELEY, in his work upon Archery, says that "bowstrings were composed
from the sinews of beasts, and on that account are termed '*Nervus*,'
νευρά." "It was customary for this purpose," says he, "to select the
sinews of several of those kinds of animals remarkable for their
strength or activity, such as Bulls, Lions, Stags, &c., and from those
particular parts of each animal in which their respective strength was
conceived to lie. From Bulls, the sinews about the back and shoulders
were collected; and from Stags, they took those of the legs."

<span id="xref_5b">5b</span> BONE OF THE WHALE.--Page 5.

A SIMILAR substance is mentioned in the ancient Romance of "The Erle of
Tolous,"--

"Hur hondys whyte as whallys bonne,"--verse 355.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Upon which Ritson
has the following note:--"This allusion is not to what we now call
*whale-bone*, which is well known to be *black*, but to the *ivory* of
the horn or tooth of the *Narwhal*, or *Sea-unicorn*, which seems to
have been mistaken for the *whale*. The similé is a remarkable
favourite. Thus, in *Syr Eglamour of Artoys*,

"The erle had no chylde but one,  
A mayden *as white as whalës bone*.'

Again, in *Syr Isembras*,

'His wyfe *as white as whalës bone*.'

Again, in 'The Squyr of low degree,'

'Lady *as white as whalës bone*.'

It even occurs in Skelton's and Surrey's Poems; and, what is still more
extraordinary, in Spenser's *Faëry Quene*, and Shakespeare's *Love's
Labour Lost* (if, in fact, that part of it ever received the
illuminating touch of our great dramatist). Mister Steevens, in his Note
on the last instance, observes that *whales* 'is the Saxon genitive
case,' meaning that it requires to be pronounced as a dissyllable (thus,
*whalës*, or, more properly, *whaleës*), which it certainly is, in every
instance."--Rit. Met. Rom. III. 343, 344.

 

<span id="xref_5c">5c</span> WINGED WITH PEACOCK'S FEATHERS.--*Page*
[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

THAT it was fashionable to feather arrows in this manner, we learn from
the following description of the Yeman who attended upon the Knight, in
the Prologue to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

"A shefe of peacock arwes bright and kene  
Under his belt he bare ful thriftily,  
Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:  
His arwes drouped not with fetheres low,  
And in his hond he bare a mighty bowe."--line 104-8.

In a Wardrobe account, 4th of Ed. II., the following entry occurs "Pro
duodecim flecchiis cum pennis de pavone emptis pro rege, de

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 12 den'." For
twelve arrows with peacock's feathers, bought for the King, twelvepence.

There was much art and care required in the construction and feathering
of arrows. That the Welsh archers paid much attention to their
equipments may be seen in an interesting passage from the composition
already noticed, [p. 43](#page_43.md). In this Tale the messenger from the
Court of North Wales, who appears to be a skilful archer, on being told
by Gwgan the Bard that a robber will ride away with his horse, answers,
"But what if I were opposite to him in yonder Wood, with a bow of red
yew in my hand, ready bent, with a tough tight string, and a straight
round shaft with a compass-rounded neck, and long slender feathers
fastened on with green silk, and a steel head heavy and thick, and an
inch across, of a green blue temper, that would draw blood out of a
weathercock; and with my foot to a hillock, and an oak behind me, and
the wind to my back, and the sun to my side, and the maid I love best on
the footpath hard by looking at me, and I conscious of her being there;
then would I shoot him such a shot, so strong and long-drawn, so low and
sharp, that it would be no more avail to him there were between him and
me a breastplate and Milan hauberk, than a tuft of fern, or a kiln mat,
or a herring net."

It is well known that bows and arrows formed a subject of legislation in
England, and among the Welsh Laws we find the following clause---

"Three weapons by law:--A sword, a spear, and a bow with twelve arrows
in a quiver. And it is required of every master of a family to keep them
in readiness against the attacks of a foreign army, and of strangers,
and other depredators."

 

<span id="xref_5d">5d</span> GOLDEN HEADS.--BLADES OF GOLD.--Page
[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

To Knights and to their families was exclusively confined the privilege
of decorating their dress, their arms, and the accoutrements of their
horses with gold; Squires being only permitted the use of silver.--Ste.
Palaye, I. 247, 283. By the sumptuary laws of Ed. III. (an. 27. c. ix.
x. xi. xii.) Esquires were to possess property of at least 200 marks
yearly value, before they could be permitted to wear "cloth of silk and
of silver, ribband, girdle, and other apparel reasonably garnished with
silver." And Knights, their wives, daughters, and children, were not
entitled to wear "cloth of gold, nor cloths, mantle, nor gold furred
with miniver, nor of ermins, nor

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

no apparel bordered of stone, nor otherwise," if their possessions were
below the yearly value of 251 marks. But to such Knights and Ladies as
possessed 400 marks annually, there was no restriction as to dress,
except with respect to "ermins and letuses and apparel of pearl and
stone," which they might only wear upon the head. Merchants and
burgesses of 500 marks had the same privilege of dress as Esquires of
200 markland. Hence perhaps it may be inferred that the two Youths
mentioned in this Tale were of knightly origin.

That the gilding of bows was customary in the 14th Century, we have the
authority of Davydd ap Gwilym. In lines addressed to his fair
countrywomen against gaudiness of dress, and which have been thus
elegantly rendered by Arthur Johnes, Esq., in his Poetical Translation
of the Works of that celebrated Bard, he says:--

"The vilest bow that e'er was framed of Yew,  
That in the hand abruptly snaps in two,  
When all its faults are varnished o'er with gold,  
Looks strong, and fair, and faultless, and--is sold."--(p. 412.)

Lewis Glyn Cothi has the following line,

"With gold shall be adorned thy fingers, thy sword, and thy mantle."

And examples might be multiplied to almost any extent.

Where arrow-heads, and the blades of weapons are mentioned as golden, it
is very evident that in many instances steel inlaid with gold is meant.
Thus, the Bard above alluded to says,--

"A gold Brigandine like the casting of a Dragon's skin."

And subsequently this gold Brigandine is said to be of steel,--

Good is the band of this steel vestment.--(I. 158.)

[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

IN the English Romance of "Ywayne and Gawain," paraphrased from the
French "Chevalier an Lyon," we find a similar picture. In a beautiful
city, named in English the "Castel of the Hevy Sorrow," and in the
French the "Chastel de Pesme Auenture," the hero, Ywayne or Owen, finds
a number of ladies, "wirkand silk and gold wir." They are very meanly
attired, and inform Owen that they were once of great estate in the
country of Mayden-land, whence they were sent as hostages by their
sovereign. They complain that they have to work very hard, and for a
very slight remuneration; the best of them receiving only "four penys"
in a week, which was scarce sufficient to maintain them, whereas they
consider that they might earn "fourty shilling."

 

<span id="xref_5f">5f</span> MORE LOVELY THAN GWENHWYVAR.--*Page*
[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

THIS was the highest compliment that Kynon could pay to the beauty of
these four-and-twenty damsels, since Gwenhwyvar is celebrated in the
Triads (with Enid and Tegau Euron,) as one of the three fair ladies of
Arthur's Court.

Lewis Glyn Cothi, in extolling the charms of Annes, the daughter of
John, of Caerlleon upon Usk, has the following allusion to this Triad:--

The beauteous and amiable Annes is where Tegau was,  
Where Gwenhwyvar was, with all her charms;  
Where Enid was seen, wearing azure robes,  
Where the Castle of the valorous Arthur stands."

 

<span id="xref_5g">5g</span> THEY ROSE UP AT MY COMING.--*Page*
[5](mab05.htm#page_5.md).

IT was very usual in the chivalric days, for the ladies to perform those
courteous offices for the Knights, even where there were male
attendants, to whom we may consider that they would have been more
appropriately assigned. Ste. Palaye tells its, "Les jeunes demoiselles .
. . . prévenoient de civilité les chevaliers qui arrivoient dans les
châteaux; suivant nos romanciers, elles les désarmoient au retour des
tournois et des expéditions de guerre, leur donnoient de nouveaux habits
et les servoient à table. Les exemples en sont trop souvent et trop
uniformément répétés, pour nous permettre de révoquer en doute la
réalité de cet usage." (I. 10.) I should imagine, however, it was the
absence of male assistance that induced the damsels in Kynon's story to
extend their cares to his horse, for I am not aware that in general
their courtesy went so far.

<span id="xref_5h">5h</span> GOLD BAND UPON THE MANTLE.--*Page*

THE word in the original Welsh is *gorffoys*, which is evidently the
same as *orfrays*, or *aurifrigia*. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)
This was a kind of fretwork, or embroidery of gold, and is mentioned
thus in the playful description of the allegorical figure of Idlenesse,
which occurs in the Romaunt of the Rose:

"And of fine orfrais had she eke  
A chapelet, so semely on,  
Ne wered never maide upon;  
And faire above that chapelet  
A rose garlonde had she set."--562-6.

 

<span id="xref_6a">6a</span> BUFFALO HORN.--*Page*
[6](mab05.htm#page_6.md).

DRINKING-HORNS of this material are frequently mentioned by the Bards,
and appear to have been made use of by the Welsh in all their banquets.
There is still extant in the Welsh language, a spirited poem by Owain
Kyveiliog, Prince of Powis, called the Hirlas, a name by which his
drinking-horn was known, and which he describes as

"The highly honoured buffalo-horn Hirlas, enriched with ancient silver."

In the course of this poem, one passage occurs of a highly dramatic
character. The Prince having sent round the horn to several chieftains,
at length orders it to be filled with the choicest beverage, and borne
to Tudur and Moreiddig, at the same time expatiating with gratitude and
admiration upon their valour, and the eminent services they had tendered
him in the arduous conflicts ill which he had been engaged. Turning
round in the fulness of his heart to address them personally, he
perceives their places vacant; and suddenly recollecting that they had
both fallen in one of the late encounters, he bursts out in a pathetic
strain of lamentation, "The wail of death has been heard, they both have
departed!--O, lost Moreiddig, how greatly shall I miss thee!"

<span id="xref_8a">8a</span> FOUNTAIN.--*Page* [8](mab05.htm#page_8.md).

Forest also lay the Val sans Retour, or the Vallon des Faux Amans.

<span id="xref_10a">10a</span> AN ADVENTURE SO MUCH TO HIS OWN

SIR KAI'S uncourteous speech was proverbial. In Ywain and Gawin, we are

"And than als smertly sayd Sir Kay;  
He karpet to tham wordes grete."

And so rude was his manner, that at length

"The quene answered, with milde mode,

<span id="xref_12a">12a</span> BLACK KNIGHT.--*Page*
[12](mab05.htm#page_12.md).

We have the name of the Black Knight given us both in the English and in
the French version. In the former, the appellation of *Salados the
rouse* is bestowed upon him, and in the latter he is called *Elcadoc le
rous*, which bears some resemblance to the Welsh Cadoc or Cattwg.

<span id="xref_12b">12b</span> MAIDEN.--*Page* [12](mab05.htm#page_12.md).

THIS maiden, whose name we subsequently find to be Luned, is supposed,
in the Notes to Jones's Welsh Bards, to be the same person as Elined the
daughter of Brychan; although from the accounts transmitted to us of
that illustrious lady, she appears to have differed much in disposition
and pursuits from the handmaid of the Lady of the Fountain. Mr. Rees, in
his valuable Essay on the Welsh Saints, has the following notice
concerning her:--

"Elined, the Almedha of Giraldus Cambrensis, who says that she suffered
martyrdom upon a hill called Penginger, near Brecknock, which the
Historian of that County, so often quoted, identifies with Slwch.

'Crug gorseddawl,' <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) mentioned after
the name of Elined in the Myvyrian Archaiology, has been taken for
Wyddgrug, or Mold, in Flintshire; but it may be no more than a
descriptive appellation of Slwch, on which there were lately some
remains of a British Camp. Cressy, speaking of St. Almedha, says, 'This
devout virgin, rejecting the proposals of an earthly prince, who sought
her in marriage, and espousing herself to the eternal king, consummated
her life by a triumphant martyrdom. The day of her solemnity is
celebrated every year on the firstday of August.'"--(149-50.)

The beauty of Luned was much celebrated amongst the Bards of the Middle
Ages. Gruffudd ap Meredydd, who flourished between 1290 and 1340, thus
alludes to her charms, in an Elegy on Gwenhwyvar of Anglesey:--

"Alas, for the loss of her who was equal to Luned, that gem of light!"

And Dafydd ap Gwilym mentions her in the same strain.

She is in the French Romances generally called Lunette, and in the Morte
d'Arthur she acts a conspicuous part in the story of Sir Gareth of
Orkney, who undertook the adventure of the "Castel

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

peryllous" on her behalf, and whose illtreatment by Sir Kai is related,
[p. 40](#page_40.md). Sir Gareth took his full revenge upon Sir Kai, but
his conduct under the taunts he received from Luned, who called. him a
*kechen knaue*, and used towards him very discourteous language,
considering that he was taking up her quarrel, is generous and
high-minded in the extreme. It ended in Sir Gareth marrying Luned's
sister, Dame Lyones, of the Castel peryllous; and in Luned herself, who
is also called the "daymoysel saueage," becoming the wife of Sir
Gaherys, who was Sir Gareth's brother. And these nuptials were
solemnized with great pomp and splendour at King Arthur's Court. See
Morte d'Arthur, Book VII. Compare Mr. Tennyson's poem of Gareth and
Lynette in the Idylls of the King.

 

<span id="xref_13a">13a</span> WHATEVER IS IN MY POWER.--*Page*
[13](mab05.htm#page_13.md).

IT appears rather extraordinary at first sight that Luned should take so
lively an interest in Owain, and give herself so much trouble to forward
his suit with the Countess, and also that she should express herself so
well acquainted with his character. But from the English Metrical
Romance, we find that they were old friends, Luned having been on an
embassy to Arthur's Court some time previously.

 

<span id="xref_13b">13b</span> TAKE THIS RING.--*Page*
[13](mab05.htm#page_13.md).

THE ring is enumerated among the "Thirteen Rarities of Kingly Regalia of
the Island of Britain, which were formerly kept at Caerlleon, on the
river Usk, in Monmouthshire. These curiosities went with Myrddin the son
of Morvran, into the house of Glass, in Enlli, or Bardsey Island. It has
also been recorded by others that it was Taliesin, the Chief of the
Bards, who possessed them."

"The Stone of the Ring of Luned, which liberated Owen the son of Urien
from between the portcullis and the wall. Whoever concealed that stone,
the stone or bezel would conceal him."

The properties of this magical ring, will, doubtless, call to mind the
ring of Gyges, which was most probably the prototype from which it was
indirectly derived.

 

<span id="xref_13c">13c</span> HORSEBLOCK.--*Page*
[13](mab05.htm#page_13.md).

ELLIS, in his Notes to Way's Fabliaux, has the following remarks upon
horseblocks, which are mentioned in a vast number of the old Romances:
"They were frequently placed on the roads and in the forests, and were
almost numberless in the towns. Many of them still remain in Paris,
where they were used by the magistrates in order to mount their mules,
on which they rode to the courts of

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

justice. On these blocks, or on the tree which was generally planted
near them, were usually suspended the shields of those Knights who
wished to challenge all comers to feats of arms. They were also
sometimes used as a place of judgment, and a rostrum, on which the
barons took their seats when they determined the differences between
their vassals, and from whence the publick criers made proclamations to
the people."--(II. 229.)

<span id="xref_13d">13d</span> PAINTED WITH GORGEOUS COLOURS.--*Page*
[13](mab05.htm#page_13.md).

THIS custom of painting figures upon the panels of rooms was much
practised and esteemed at the time when we may suppose that this Tale
was put into its present dress. Chaucer has several instances, of which
we may notice more particularly the allegorical figures on the wall, at
the opening of the Romaunt of the Rose, and the far more interesting and
descriptive representations in the Temples of Mars, Venus, and Diana, in
the "Knightes Tale." The paintings at the Temple of Mars were executed
with so much art that even sounds were emitted by them.

"First on the wall was peinted a forest  
In which ther wonneth neyther man ne best  
With knotty knarry barrein trees old  
Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to behold,  
In which ther ran a romble and a swough,  
As though a storme shuld bresten every bough," &c.--(1977.)

 

<span id="xref_14a">14a</span> SENDALL.--*Page* [14](mab05.htm#page_14.md).

THIS Word is the same as that in the original Welsh, and is used by the
old writers to signify a thin kind of silk like cyprus. The dress of the
"*Doctour of Phisike*," one of the pilgrims to Canterbury, was, no
doubt, a handsome one, and of him we are told--

"In sanguine and in perse he clad was alle  
Lined with taffata and with sendalle."--(441.)

 

<span id="xref_15b">15b</span> SHE WASHED OWAIN'S HEAD.--*Page*
[15](mab05.htm#page_15.md).

HOWEVER these personal services may appear to be at variance with the
manners of the present day, it is clear that they were in perfect
accordance with those of our ancestors. Of this, the following passage
from the Life of Merlin will afford an example:--

"When. they went to the palace and had disarmed themselves,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King Leodagan made
his daughter Genievre (Gwenhwyvar) take the richest cloths which were in
the house, and warm water, and fair basins of silver, and made them be
placed before King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Boors; and his
daughter would wait upon Arthur, and would wash his neck and his face;
but he would not allow thereof, till Leodagan and Merlin requested him,
and made him accept the lady's service. The damsel washed his face right
humbly, and then she wiped it with a fine towel, full gently; and then
she went and ministered in like manner to the other twain."

 

<span id="xref_15a">15a</span> COUNTESS.--*Page*
[15](mab05.htm#page_15.md).

THE English Version gives this Countess the title of

"The riche lady Alundyne,  
The dukes doghter of Landuit."--line 1255.

And it is very satisfactory to find that she was not that Penarwen,
daughter of Culfynawyt Prydein, who is mentioned as Owain's wife in the
Triads, though in terms which are anything but complimentary. Perhaps
Penarwen may have been a subsequent wife, since we may infer that Owain
survived the Lady of the Fountain, from the circumstance so naively
mentioned in the text, of her continuing to be his wife as long as she
lived.

In Owen's Llywarch Hên, it is stated that after the death of Penarwen,
Owain, was married to Denyw, the daughter of Llewddyn Luyddawg of
Edinburgh, by whom he had Kendeyrn Garthwys, the celebrated St.
Kentigern, who founded the Cathedral at Glasgow.

THIS trait of manners is very characteristic of the times in which the
present Tale was written. It was very usual for widows and heiresses in
the troublous days of Knight-errantry to marry those whose strength and
valour rendered them best able to defend and preserve to them their
possessions. Ste. Palaye, in enumerating the advantages of the order of
Knighthood, does not forget to mention this easy mode of advancing to
fortune.--(I. 267, 326.)

 

<span id="xref_18b">18b</span> GWALCHMAI.--Page 18.

GWALCHMAI AP GWYAR.--This ancient British name, Gwalchmai, which
signifies the *Hawk of Battle*, is in the French Romances changed

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

into the not very similar form of Gawain, having first been Latinized
into Walganus and Walweyn. In the Triads, he is mentioned in the
following manner:--

"There were three golden-tongued Knights in the Court of Arthur:
Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar; Drudwas the son of Tryffin, and Eliwlod the
son of Madog ap Uthur. For there was neither King, nor Earl, nor Lord,
to whom these came, but would listen to them before all others; and
whatever request they made, it would be granted them, whether willingly
or unwillingly; and thence were they called the *Golden Tongued*."

As a proof of the high estimation in which Gwalchmai's powers of
persuasion were held, the following translation from the Myvyrian
Archaiology (I. 178) may be adduced:--

 

HERE ARE ENGLYNS

Between Trystan the son of Tallwch, and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar,
after Trystan had been absent three years from Arthur's Court, in
displeasure, and Arthur had sent eight-and-twenty warriors to seize him,
and bring him to Arthur, and Trystan smote them all down, one after
another, and came not for any one, but for Gwalchmai with the Golden
Tongue.

GWALCHMAI.

Tumultuous is the nature of the wave,  
When the sea is at its height--  
Who art thou, mysterious warrior?

TRYSTAN.

Tumultuous are the waves and the thunder.  
In their bursting forth let them be tumultuous.  
In the day of conflict I am Trystan.

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan of the faultless speech,  
Who, in the day of battle, would not retreat,  
A companion of thine was Gwalchmai.

TRYSTAN.

I would do for Gwalchmai in that day,  
In the which the work of slaughter is let loose,  
That which one brother would not do for another. <span id="page_58">p.
58</span>

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan, endowed with brilliant qualities,  
Whose spear has oft been shivered in the toil of war,  
I am Gwalchmai the nephew of Arthur.

TRYSTAN.

Gwalchmai, there swifter than Mydrin,  
Shouldst thou be in danger,  
I would cause blood to flow till it reached the knees.

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan, for thy sake would I strive  
Until my wrist should fail me;  
Also for thee I would do my utmost.

TRYSTAN.

I ask it in defiance,  
I ask it not through fear,--  
Who are the warriors before me?

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan, of distinguished qualities,  
Are they not known to thee?  
It is the household of Arthur that comes.

TRYSTAN.

Arthur will I not shun,  
To nine hundred combats will I dare him,--  
If I am slain, I will also slay.

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan, the friend of damsels,  
Before commencing the work of strife,  
The best of all things is peace.

TRYSTAN.

Let me but have my sword upon my thigh,  
And my right hand to defend me,  
And I myself will be more formidable than they all.

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan of brilliant qualities,  
Before exciting the tumult of conflict,--  
Reject not Arthur as a friend. <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

TRYSTAN.

Gwalchmai, for thy sake will I deliberate,  
And with my mouth I utter it.  
As I am loved, so will I love.

GWALCHMAI.

Trystan, of aspiring mind,  
The shower wets a hundred oaks.  
Come to an interview with thy kinsman.

TRYSTAN.

Gwalchmai, of persuasive answers,  
The shower wets a hundred furrows.  
I will go where'er thou wilt.

Then came Trystan with Gwalchmai to Arthur.

GWALCHMAI.

Arthur, of courteous replies,  
The shower wets a hundred heads.  
Here is Trystan, be thou joyful.

ARTHUR.

Gwalchmai, of faultless answers,  
The shower wets a hundred dwellings.  
A welcome to Trystan, my nephew.

Worthy Trystan, chief of the host,  
Love thy race, remember the past  
Am I not the Chief of the Tribe?

Trystan, leader of onsets,  
Take equal with the best,  
But leave the sovereignty to me.

Trystan, wise and mighty chieftain,  
Love thy kindred, none shall harm thee,  
Let there be no coldness between friend and friend.

TRYSTAN.

Arthur, to thee will I attend,  
To thy command will I submit,  
And that thou wishest will I do.

In one Triad we find Gwalchmai extolled as one of the three most
courteous men towards guests and strangers; and from another we learn
that be added scientific attainments to his other remarkable qualities.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

"The three learned ones of the island of Britain, Gwalchmai ab Gwyar,
and Llecheu ab Arthur, and Rhiwallon with the broom-bush hair; and there
was nothing of which they did not know the elements and the material
essence."

William of Malmsbury says, that during the reign of William the
Conqueror (A.D. 1086) the tomb of Gwalchmai, or *Walwen*, as he calls
him, was discovered on the sea-shore, in a certain province of Wales
called Rhôs, which is understood to be that still known by the same
name, in the county of Pembroke, where there is a district called in
Welsh Castell Gwalchmai, and in English Walwyn's Castle.

In the Graves of the Warriors a similar locality is indicated:--

The grave of Gwalchmai is in Pyton,  
Where the ninth wave flows."

The Romances make Gawain one of the four sons of King Lot of Orkney, and
of Morgawse, sister to King Arthur; and in them the character for
courtesy given to him in the Triads is fully maintained. So proverbial,
indeed, was he for this quality, that the highest praise the Squier
could bestow upon the address of the Knight who rode the "stede of bras"
was,

That Gawain with his olde curtesie,  
Though he were come agen out of faerie  
Ne coude him not amenden with a word."--line 10410.

 

<span id="xref_20a">20a</span> SATIN ROBE OF HONOUR.--*Page*
[20](mab05.htm#page_20.md).

THIS species of honourable dress could only be worn by knights; and,
according to Ste. Palaye, was generally the gift of the sovereign, who
accompanied it with a palfrey, or, at least, with a horse's bit, either
golden or gilded. His words are, "Le manteau long et trainant qui
enveloppoit toute la personne, étoit reservé particulièrement au
chevalier, comme la plus auguste et la plus noble décoration qu'il pût
avoir lorsqu'il n'étoit point paré de ses armes .... on l'appeloit le
manteau d'honneur."--(I. 287.)

 

<span id="xref_20b">20b</span> EARL OF RHANGYW.--*Page*
[20](mab05.htm#page_20.md).

PROBABLY this is meant for the Earl of Anjou, and was originally written
*Iarll yr Angyw*, the Welsh particle yr, in its contracted form *'r*,
being by some error of the transcriber incorporated with Angyw, which is
the Welsh name for Anjou. What renders this the more likely is, that the
Earldom of Anjou, or Angyw, was

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

according to the Brut, one of the possessions of Arthur, who bestowed it
upon his seneschal Sir Kai.

IT would be vain to attempt to find English terms corresponding
precisely with those used in the Welsh text, to designate the various
kinds of arms which the knights fought with, in this Tale.

 

<span id="xref_21a">21a</span> COUSIN.--*Page* [21](mab05.htm#page_21.md).

THE following genealogical table will explain this consanguinity, as
given in the Welsh Pedigrees.

<span id="img_06100"></span> ![Genealogical chart](img/06100.jpg.md)  
Genealogical chart

From very remote periods down to the time of Elizabeth, the Welsh kept
up their Pedigrees with much care, and many copies of them are extant
both in public and private collections; and although in these occasional
discrepancies may be perceived, yet, in general, their authenticity is
well established. It must be allowed, that it appears somewhat
extraordinary that these family records should be transmitted with such
accuracy through so many generations. But when we consider the
imperative obligations of the Welsh Laws upon this subject, we are no
longer surprised at the existence of such ancient documents, nor at the
solicitude of the Welsh to preserve them.

"It has been observed," says the Essayist on Welsh Pedigrees, in the
Transactions of the Cymmrodorion Society, "that genealogies were
preserved as a matter of necessity, under the ancient British
constitution. A man's pedigree was to him of the first importance, as
thereby be was enabled to ascertain and prove his birthright, and claim
the privileges which the law attached to it. Every one was obliged to
show his descent through nine generations, in order to be acknowledged a
free native, by which right he claimed his portion of land in the
community. He was also affected with respect to legal Process in his
collateral affinities through nine degrees; for instance, every murder
committed had a fine levied on the relations of the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

murderer, divided into nine degrees; his brother paying the greatest,
and the *ninth* in relationship the least. The fine thus levied was in
the same proportions distributed among the relations of the victim. A
person beyond the *ninth* descent formed a new family; every family was
represented by its elder, and these elders from every family were
delegates to the national council."

 

<span id="xref_21b">21b</span> GIVE ME YOUR SWORDS.--*Page*
[21](mab05.htm#page_21.md).

THIS modesty, in disclaiming praise, and attaching merit to others, was
one of the most esteemed qualities of knighthood. Ste. Palaye quotes
from Olivier de la Marche (Mém. i. 315), a contest of generosity
somewhat similar to that between Owain and Gwalchmai. "Jacques de Lalain
et Piétois, en 1450, ayant fait armes à pied, se renverserent lun sur
l'autre; ils furent relevés par les escortes et amenés aux juges qui les
firent toucher ensemble en Signe de paix. Comme Lalain, par modestie,
voulut envoyer son bracelet, suivant la convention faite pour le prix,
Pietois déclara qu'ayant ete aussi bien que lui porté par terre, il se
croiroit également obligé de lui donner le sien. Ce nouveau combat de
politesse finit par ne plus parler de bracelet, et par former une
etroite liaison d'amitié entre ces genereux ennemis."--(I. 150.)

 

<span id="xref_21c">21c</span> BANQUET.--*Page* [21](mab05.htm#page_21.md).

A FEAST which took three years to prepare, and three months to consume,
appears in our degenerate days as something quite enormous; but it is a
trifle to what we read in another of the Mabinogion, where a party spend
eighty years in listening to the songs of the birds of Rhianon, that
charm away the remembrance of their sorrows.

 

<span id="xref_21d">21d</span> A DAMSEL ENTERED, UPON A BAY
HORSE.--*Page* [21](mab05.htm#page_21.md).

THE custom of riding into a hall, while the Lord and his guests sat at
meat, the memory of which is still preserved in the coronation
ceremonials of this country, might be illustrated by innumerable
passages of ancient Romance and History. But I shall content myself with
a quotation from Chaucer's beautiful and half-told Tale of Cambuscan.

And so befell that after the thridde cours  
While that this king sit thus in his nobley,  
Herking his ministralles hir thinges pley  
Beforne him at his bord deliciously, <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>  
In at the halle dore al sodenly  
Ther came a knight upon a stede of bras,  
And in his hond a brod mirrour of glas;  
Upon his thombe he had of gold a ring,  
And by his side a naked swerd hanging:  
And up be rideth to the highe bord.  
In all the halle ne was ther spoke a word,  
For mervaille of this knight; him to behold  
Ful besily they waiten yong and old."--10,390-10,401.

 

<span id="xref_22a">22a</span> AND ANOINT HIM WITH THIS BALSAM.--*Page*
[22](mab05.htm#page_22.md).

THE healing art was always confined to females in chivalric times, a
principal part of whose education it formed, and to the -wives and
daughters of knights was confided the care of such as were sick or
wounded. Of this, the instances are so numerous, that it is needless to
adduce any here.

We find, from the English metrical version of this Tale, that the
ointment here mentioned, was the gift of Morgant le sage, very probably
the same as Morgan le fay, who was sister of King Arthur, and wife to
Urien Rheged, and whose skill in magic was justly celebrated, as the
adventure of the Manteau mal taillé will unfortunately prove.

 

<span id="xref_23a">23a</span> WRESTED FROM HER BY A YOUNG EARL.--*Page*
[23](mab05.htm#page_23.md).

THE name of this invader is in Ywain and Gawin, "The ryche eryl, syr
Alers,"--line 1871; and the "Cuens Alers," in the Chevalier au Lion.

 

<span id="xref_24a">24a</span> A BEAUTIFUL BLACK STEED.--*Page*
[24](mab05.htm#page_24.md).

THE name of Owain's horse is recorded, with the epithet of
"irrestrainable" (*Anrheithfarch*), but we cannot venture to affirm that
the *Carn Aflawg* (or grasping-hoofed) of the Triads, was either the
charger which he received from the Lady of the Castle, or that which met
with so disastrous a fate at the falling of the portcullis.

 

<span id="xref_25a">25a</span> WENT ON HIS WAY, AS BEFORE.--*Page*
[25](mab05.htm#page_25.md).

THE story of this adventure, as well as that of the fountain, appears to
have been popular in the Principality, during the Middle Ages, as it is
alluded to in an Ode addressed to Owain Glendower, by

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gruffydd Llwyd ab
Davydd ab Einion, one of his Bards, about the year 1400.

Of this, the following translation is given in Jones's Welsh Bards, I.
41:--

"On sea, on land, thou still didst brave  
The dangerous cliff, and rapid wave;  
Like *Owain*, who subdued the knight,  
And the fell dragon put to flight,  
  Yon moss-grown fount beside;  
The grim, black warrior of the flood,  
The dragon, gorged with human blood,  
  The water's scaly pride."

 

<span id="xref_25b">25b</span> STONE VAULT.--*Page*
[25](mab05.htm#page_25.md).

THIS part of the Tale is by no means clearly expressed, but it is
evidently intended to be understood that Luned was incarcerated in a
stone cell, near which Owain chanced to halt for the night. We
subsequently find that he shut up the Lion in the same place, during his
contest with Luned's persecutors.

 

<span id="xref_27a">27a</span> A MONSTER.--*Page*
[27](mab05.htm#page_27.md).

THIS monster is in the English called "Harpyns of Mowntain," and he is,
moreover, said to have been "a devil of mekil pryde." According to this
and the French version, the good knight (who, it appears, had married a
sister of Sir Gawain) was, originally, the, father of "sex knyghts," two
of whom Harpyns had already slain, while he threatened to put the
remaining four to death, unless their sister was given "hym to wyve."
The costume of the Harpyns and the four young men is very
characteristic.

"With wreched ragges war thai kled  
And fast bunden thus er thai led:  
The geant was both large and lang,  
And bar a lever of yren ful strang,  
Tharwith he bet them bitterly,  
Grete rewth it was to her tham cry,  
Thai had no thing tham for to hyde.  
A dwergh yode on the tother syde;  
He bar a scowrge with cordes ten,  
Thar-with he bet tha gentil men."

 

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

And further on, it is said of the giant,

"Al the armure he was yn  
Was noght bot of a bul-skyn."

 

<span id="xref_29a">29a</span> STATE OF STUPOR.--*Page*
[29](mab05.htm#page_29.md).

THE literal meaning of this passage is not advantageous to the
four-and-twenty ladies, as it gives them a character for anything but
sobriety. It is possible, however, that allusion is made to some act of
necromancy (not by any means unusual in the old writers of romance), by
which they were thrown into a state of insensibility.

 

<span id="xref_29b">29b</span> HOSPICE.--*Page* [29](mab05.htm#page_29.md).

SPYTTY.--This term is derived from the Latin word Hospitium, and is used
to designate those establishments which were erected and maintained by
the monks for the reception of travellers. They bore some remote
resemblance to our present inns, and were generally placed in secluded
spots at a distance, from any town. Several places in Wales retain the
recollection of these hospitable institutions in the name they still
bear, as Spytty Ivan, Spytty Cynvyn, &c.

<span id="xref_30a">30a</span> RAVENS.--*Page* [30](mab05.htm#page_30.md).

As some explanation of this strange expression, it may, be noticed, that
in another of the Mabinogion, called the "Dream of Rhonabwy," Owain is
represented as having an army of Ravens in his service, which are
engaged in combat with some of Arthur's attendants. But in that, as well
as in the present Tale, the adventure is introduced with an abruptness
that can only be accounted for by supposing that the story was well
known, and that it formed a part of that great store of Romance which
existed among the Welsh, and which furnished to the other nations of
Europe the earliest materials of imaginative composition. This Raven
Army of the Prince of Rheged has evidently a connection with the
armorial hearings of that house already alluded to.

Morken. Perhaps he is the Morcant, who caused the death of Urien Rheged.

Probably it is through a confusion of names, by no means unusual in
those days, that Urien's wife, Morgan le Fay, is by the old romancers
accused of an attempt to assassinate him.

substitution of Cambria for Lloegria \[England\], was taken as the
subject of a speech to rouse the Welsh to the due consideration of their
literature, by the Rev. Thomas Price of Crickhowel, at the Meeting <span

in the Autumn of 1835. The effect it produced was quite electric.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[36:1](mab06.htm#fr_6.md) Lancelot du Lac is
generally considered as an exception to the general rule, that all the
heroes of the Arthurian Romances are of Welsh origin. But it has been
suggested to me by a learned Antiquary, that this distinction does not
really exist, the name of Lancelot being nothing more than a translation
of Paladr-ddellt (splintered spear), which was the name of a knight of
Arthur's Court, celebrated in the Triads.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[36:2](mab06.htm#fr_7.md) The arrangement of ancient
pedigrees is at all times attended with difficulty, but vain indeed
would be the attempt to reconcile the genealogies of Romance with those
of history.

In Morte d'Arthur, Owain's Mother is Morgan le Fay, sister to King
Arthur.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[40:1](mab06.htm#fr_8.md) Kai's horse, according to
the Welsh authorities, was called *Gwineu gwddwf hir*, the *long-necked

<span id="fn_9"></span>[41:1](mab06.htm#fr_9.md) It is somewhat singular
that this adventure was undertaken on behalf of Luned, who, under the
title of the damoysel saueage, rode to Arthur's Court, to beseech the
championship of some of the Knights of the Table rounde, for her' sister
dame Lyones, of the Castel peryllous. The story is again referred to in
a subsequent Note.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[41:2](mab06.htm#fr_10.md) According to the
Romances, Arthur's Queen was daughter of King Leodegrance.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[44:1](mab06.htm#fr_11.md) We trace the customs of
a country in what may appear accidental expressions. Thus a cushion in a
chair was one of the requisites of a Welsh establishment.

Three things proper for a man to have in his house,--

A virtuous wife,  
His cushion in his chair,  
And his harp in tune.

In like manner it is particularly mentioned in the present tale, that
Arthur had "a cushion of red satin under his elbow," [p.
3](mab05.htm#page_3.md); and that at the Castle where Kynon was received,
on his way to the adventure of the Fountain, the maidens, in doing him
honour, " placed cushions both beneath and around him," when he sat down
to meat, [p. 6](mab05.htm#page_6.md). In this latter instance, the cushions
we find were covered with red linen.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[44:2](mab06.htm#fr_12.md) Swans appear to have
been a great dainty in those days. Of the luxurious Monk in the
Pilgrimage to Canterbury, Chaucer tells us, "A fat swan loved he best of
any rost."--line 206.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[44:3](mab06.htm#fr_13.md) Uniformity of dress in
those who held the same office, appears to be dwelt upon with much
satisfaction by the writers of the Middle Ages. In Geoffrey of Monmouth,
the thousand young noblemen, who, at Arthur's Coronation Banquet,
assisted Kai in serving up the dishes, were clothed like him in robes of
Ermine. The same writer proceeds to tell us, that "at that Time Britain
was arrived to such a pitch of Grandeur, that whether we respect its
Affluence of Riches, Luxury of Ornaments, or Politeness of Inhabitants,
it far surpassed all other Kingdoms." And he adds, "The Knights in it
that were famous for Feats of Chivalry, wore their Clothes and Arms all
of the same colour and Fashion. And the Women also no less celebrated
for their Wit, wore all the same Kind of Apparel."--Thompson's
Translation.

In the Procession to Canterbury, Chaucer relates that

"An HABERDASHER, and A CARPENTER,  
A WEBBE, a DYER, and a TAPISER,  
Were alle yclothed in o livere,  
Of a solemne and grete fraternite."--line 363.
