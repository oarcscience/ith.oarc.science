### LLYN DULYN IN SNOWDON.

THE extraordinary property of producing rain, when spilt upon a stone,
is attributed to the waters of Llyn Dulyn, in Snowdon, according to the
following account, which is translated from the Greal, a Welsh Magazine,
published in London, 1805.

"There is a lake in the mountains of Snowdon, called Dulyn, in a rugged
valley, encircled by high steep rocks. This lake is extremely black, and
its fish are deformed and unsightly, having large heads and small
bodies. No wild swans are ever seen alighting upon it (such as are on
all the other lakes in Snowdon), nor ducks, nor any bird whatever. And
there is a causeway of stones leading into this lake; and if any one
goes along this causeway, even when it is hot sunshine, and throws water
so as to wet the furthest stone, which is called the Red Altar \[yr
Allawr Goch\], it is a chance if it do not rain before night. Witness,
T. Prys, of Plas Iolyn, and Sion Davydd, of Rhiwlas, in Llan Silin."
