The Well of Fionn Ma-Coul

> THE ancient churches and cells of the saints were generally placed in
> the vicinity of a well, which then became sanctified and endowed with
> miraculous healing power. Or the well may have been held sacred by the
> Druids, and the scene of their pagan rites; therefore selected by the
> saint specially as his dwelling-place, so that he might bring it under
> the fosterage and holy influence of Christianity.

> The grave of the great Fionn was laid by a celebrated well in the
> County Cork, and it is certain that a massive human jawbone was found
> there not long ago, far exceeding in size the bones of the present
> race of men. This jawbone was sent to London to be inspected by the
> learned philosophers, but was never returned--a areat and grievous
> wrong to the renowned Irish chief, for no doubt the mighty Fionn will
> want it badly at the last day, when he is gathering up his bones to
> appear before the Lord.
