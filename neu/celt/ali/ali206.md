Kil-na-Greina

> Tober Kil-na-Greina (the well of the fountain of the sun) was
> discovered only about eighty years ago, by a strange chance in the
> County Cork.

> The land was a desolate marsh, no one built on it, and nothing grew on
> it or near it. But a large grey stone lay there, with a natural hollow
> in the centre that would hold about a gallon of water, and close by
> were the remains of an old pagan fort.

> One day, the farmer who owned the land carried off this great grey
> stone to use as a drinking trough for his cattle. But not long after
> all the cattle grew sick, and then all the children sickened, so the
> farmer said there was ill luck in the business, and he carried back
> the stone to its old place, on which all the household recovered their
> health. Thereupon the farmer began to think there must he something
> wonderful and mysterious in the locality, so he had the marsh
> thoroughly drained, after which process they came upon an ancient
> stone circle, and in the midst was a well of beautiful fresh water.
> Some people said there was writing on the stones, and strange
> carvings; but it was generally believed to be a Druid temple and
> oracle, for there was a tradition that a woman called the
> *Ban-na-Naomha* (the nymph of the well) had once lived there--and that
> she had the gift of prophecy, and uttered oracles to those who sought
> her at the shrine by the well; and there was a little wooden image of
> her, also, that used to speak to the people--so it was said and
> believed. It is certain, however, that a pagan temple once existed
> there, for which reason St. Patrick cursed the land and turned it into
> a marsh, and the well was hidden for a thousand years, according to
> St. Patrick's word.

> On the discovery of the well the whole country flocked to it for
> cures. Tents were erected and a pattern was organized, which went on
> for some years with great success, and many authentic instances are
> recorded of marvellous miracles performed there.

> The ritual observed was very strict at the beginning, three draughts
> of water were taken by the pilgrims, the number of drinks three, the
> number of rounds on their knees were three, thus making the circuit of
> the well nine times. After each round the pilgrim laid a stone on the
> ancient altar in the Druid circle, called "the well of time sun," and
> these stones, named in Irish "the stones of the sun," are generally
> pure white, and about the size of a pigeon's egg. They have a
> beautiful appearance after rain when the sun shines on them, and were
> doubtless held sacred to the sun in pagan times. The angels will
> reckon these stones at the last day, but each particular saint will
> take charge of his own votaries and see that the stones are properly
> counted, for each man will receive forgiveness according to their
> number.

> But gradually the revelry at the pattern gave occasion for so much
> scandal, that the priest denounced the well from the altar, along with
> all the wickedness it fostered and encouraged. Still the people would
> not give up the pattern, and the drinking, and dancing, and gambling,
> and fighting went on worse than ever, until one day a man was killed.
> After this a curse seemed to have fallen on the place. The well lost
> all its miraculous powers, no cures were effected; the maimed, the
> halt, and the blind prayed before it, and went the rounds, and piled
> the stones as usual, but no help came, and worst sign of all, a great
> pagan stone on which a cross had been erected, fell down of its own
> accord, and the cross lay shattered on the ground. Then all the people
> knew that the curse of blood and of St. Patrick was indeed over the
> well; so it was deserted, and the tents were struck, and no pattern
> was ever held there any more, for the virtue of healing had gone from
> "the fountain of the sun," and never has come back to it through all
> the years.

> Even the *Ban-Naomha,* the nymph of the fountain, who used to manifest
> herself occasionally to the regenerate under the form of a trout,
> disappeared at the same time, and though she may be heard of at other
> sacred wells, was never again seen by the devout pilgrims who watched
> for her appearance at time
>
> Tober-kil-na-Greina.
