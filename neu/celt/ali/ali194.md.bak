Charm for the Fairy Stroke

> THERE is a very ancient and potent charm which may be tried with great
> effect in case of a suspected fairy-stroke.

> Place three rows of salt on a table in three lines, three equal
> measures to each row. The person performing the spell then encloses
> the rows of salt with his arm, leaning his head down over them, while
> he repeats the Lord's Prayer three times over each row--that is, nine
> times in all. Then he takes the hand of the one who has been
> fairy-struck, and says over it, "By the power of the Father, and of
> the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, let this disease depart, and the
> spell of the evil spirits be broken! I adjure, I command you to leave
> this man \[naming him\]. In the name of God I pray; in the name of
> Christ I adjure; in the name of the Spirit of God I command and compel
> you to go back and leave this man free! AMEN! AMEN! AMEN!"
