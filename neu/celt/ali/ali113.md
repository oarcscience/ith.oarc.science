For the Mad Fever

> Three stones must be charmed by the hands of a wise fairy doctor, and
> cast by his hand, saying as he does so--"The first stone I cast is for
> the head in the mad fever; the second stone I cast is for the heart in
> the mad fever; the third stone I cast is for the back in the mad
> fever.

> "In the name of the Trinity, let peace come. AMEN."
