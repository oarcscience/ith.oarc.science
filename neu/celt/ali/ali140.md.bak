For the Falling Sickness

> Take a hank of grey yarn, a lock of the patient's hair, some parings
> of his nails, and bury them deep in the earth, repeating, in Irish, as
> a burial service, "Let the great sickness lie there for ever. By the
> power of Mary and the soul of Paul, let the great sickness lie buried
> in the clay, and never more rise out of the ground. AMEN."

> If the patient, on awaking from sleep, calls out the name of the
> person who uttered these words, his recovery is certain.

> If a person crosses over the patient while he is in a fit, or stands
> between him and the fire, then the sickness will cleave to him and
> depart from the other that was afflicted.
