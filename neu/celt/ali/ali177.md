Divination

> In ancient Pagan times in Ireland the poets were supposed to possess
> the gift of prophecy, and by certain means could throw themselves into
> a state in which they had lucid vision of coming events. This state,
> called *Imbas for Osna,* was produced by incantations and the offering
> of the flesh of a red pig, a dog, or a cat to their idols. Then the
> poet, laying the two palms of his hands on his two cheeks, lay down
> and slept; his idol gods being beside him. And when he awoke he could
> see all things and foretell all things. He could make verses with the
> ends of his fingers, and repeat the same without studying, and in this
> way proved his right to be chief poet at the court of the king. Also
> he laid his staff upon the head of a person, and thus he found out his
> name, and the name of his father and mother, and all unknown things
> that were proposed to him. And this prophetic power was also obtained
> by *Imbas for Osna,* though a different kind of offering was made to
> the idol.

> But Patrick abolished these practices, and declared that whoever used
> them should enjoy neither heaven nor earth; and he substituted for
> them the *Corus Cerda* (the Law of Poetry), in which no offering was
> made to demons; for the profession of the poet, he said, was pure, and
> should not be subject to the power of the devil. He left to the poets,
> however, the gift of extemporaneous recital, because it was acquired
> through great knowledge and diligent study, but all other rites he
> strictly forbade to the poets of Erin.
