The Weasel

> Weasels are spiteful and malignant, and old withered witches sometimes
> take this form. It is extremely unlucky to meet a weasel the first
> thing in the morning; still it would be hazardous to kill it, for it
> might be a witch and take revenge. Indeed one should be very cautious
> about killing a weasel at any time, for all the other weasels will
> resent your audacity, and kill your chickens when an opportunity
> offers. The only remedy is to kill one chicken yourself, make the sign
> of the cross solemnly three times over it., then tie it to a stick
> hung up in the yard, and the weasels will have no more power for evil,
> nor the witches who take their form, at least during the year, if the
> stick is left standing; but the chicken may be eaten when the sun goes
> down.

> A goose is killed on St. Michael's Day because the son of a king,
> being then at a feast, was choked by the bone of a goose; but was
> restored by St. Patrick. Hence the king ordered a goose to be
> sacrificed every year on the anniversary of the day to commemorate the
> event, and in honour of St. Michael.

> A fowl is killed on St. Martin's Day, and the blood sprinkled on the
> house. In Germany a black cock is substituted.

> A crowing hen, a whistling girl, and a black cat, are considered most
> unlucky. Beware of them in a house.

> If a cock comes on the threshold and crows, you may expect visitors.

> To see three magpies on the left hand when on a journey is unlucky;
> but two on the right hand is a good omen.

> If you hear the cuckoo on your right hand you will have luck all the
> year after.

> Whoever kills a robin redbreast will never have good luck were they to
> live a thousand years.

> A water wagtail near the house betokens bad news on its way to you.

> If the first lamb of the season is born black, it foretells mourning
> garments for the family within the year.

> It is very lucky for a hen and her chickens to stray into your house.
> Also it is good to meet a white lamb in the early morning with the
> sunlight on its face.

> It is unlucky to meet a magpie, a eat, or a lame woman when going a
> journey. Or for a cock to meet a person in the doorway and crow before
> him--then the journey should be put off.

> If one magpie comes chattering to your door it is a sign of death; but
> if two prosperity will follow. For a magpie to come to the door and
> look at you is a sure death-sign, and nothing can avert the doom.

> A flight of rooks over an army betokens defeat; if over a house, or
> over people when driving or walking, death will follow.

> It is very unlucky to ask a man on his way to fish where he is going.
> And many would turn back, knowing that it was an evil spell.

> When a swarm of bees suddenly quits the hive it is a sign that death
> is hovering near the house. But the evil may be averted by the
> powerful prayers and exorcism of the priest.

> The shoe of a horse or of an ass nailed to the door-post will bring
> good luck; because these animals were in the stall when Christ was
> born, and are blessed for evermore. But the shoe must be found, not
> given, in order to bring luck.

> In whatever quarter you are looking when you first hear the cuckoo in
> the season, you will be travelling in that direction before the year
> is over.

> It was the privilege of the chief bards to wear mantles made of birds'
> plumage. A short cape flung on the shoulders made of mallards' necks
> and crests must have been very gorgeous in effect, glittering like
> jewels, when the torch-light played on the colours at the festivals.
