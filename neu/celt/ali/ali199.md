The Sacred Trout

> The water of the sacred well must never be used for household
> purposes--washing, or the like. But after the well was cursed by the
> priest, and the tents were struck, and no pattern was held there any
> longer, it lost all its sanctity, and was no longer held sacred by the
> people, who began to fill their pails, and carry the water away home
> for cooking and household use while also they all washed their clothes
> down at the well, just as if no sanctity had ever been in the water.

> However, one day a woman having put down a pot of water to boil, found
> that no amount of fire would heat it. Still it remained ice-cold, as
> if just drawn from the well. So she looked carefully into the pot, and
> there beheld the Sacred Speckled Trout sailing round and round quite
> contented and happy. On seeing this, she knew that the curse was
> lifted from the well, and she ran and told the priest. His reverence
> having seen the Sacred Trout with his own eyes, ordered it to be
> carried back to the well, the water of which at once regained all its
> sacred powers by the blessing of the priest; and he gave the people
> leave thenceforth to hold their pattern there, so as they behaved
> themselves like decent, God-fearing Christians for the future. But the
> water was not allowed to be carried away any more to their houses for
> household purposes; the desecration of the holy water of a sacred well
> being strictly forbidden as dangerous and unlucky.
