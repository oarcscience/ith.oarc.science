The Wake Orgies

> FROM ancient times the wakes, or funeral games, in Ireland were held
> with many strange observances carried down by tradition from the pagan
> era. Some of the rites, however, were so revolting and monstrous that
> the priesthood used all their influence to put them down. The old
> funeral customs, in consequence, have now been discontinued almost
> entirely amongst the people, and the ancient traditional usages are
> unknown to the new generation, though the elders of the village can
> yet remember them. An old man still living thus described to an
> inquiring antiquary and lover of folk-lore, his experience of the
> ceremonial of a wake at which he had been present in the South of
> Ireland, when he was quite a youth, some fifty years before.

> "One dark winter's night, about seven o'clock, a large party of us,"
> he said, "young men and women, perhaps thirty or more, set out across
> the mountain to attend a wake at the house of a rich farmer, about
> three miles off. All the young men carried lighted torches, fcr the
> way was rugged and dangerous; and by their light we guided the women
> as best we could over the deep clefts and across the rapid streams,
> swollen by the winter's rain. The girls took off their shoes and
> stockings and walked barefoot, but where the water was heavy and deep
> the men carried them across in their arms or on their backs. In this
> way we all arrived at last at the farmhouse, and found a great
> assemblage in the large barn, which was hung throughout with branches
> of evergreen and festoons of laurel and holly.

> "At one end of the barn, on a bed decorated with branches of green
> leaves; lay the corpse., an old woman of eighty, the mother of the man
> of the house. He stood by the head of the dead woman, while all the
> near relatives had seats round. Then the mourning women entered and
> sat down on the ground in a circle, one in the centre cloaked and
> hooded, who began the chant or funeral wail, all the rest,joining in
> chorus. After an interval there would come a deep silence; then the
> chant began again, and when it was over the women rose up and went
> out, leaving the place free for the next corners, who acted a play
> full of ancient symbolic meaning. But, first, whisky was served round,
> and the pipers played; for every village had sent their best player
> and singer to honour the wake.

> "When a great space was cleared in the centre of the barn, the first
> set of players entered. They wore masks and fantastic garments, and
> each carried a long spear and a bit of plaited straw on the arm for a
> shield. At once they began to build a fort, as it were, marking out
> the size with their spears, and using some rough play with the
> spectators. While thus engaged a band of enemies appeared, also masked
> and armed. And now a great fight began and many prisoners were taken;
> but to save slaughter a horn was blown, and a fight demanded between
> the two best champions of the hostile forces. Two of the finest young
> men were then selected and placed at opposite ends of the barn, when
> they ran a tilt against one another with their spears, uttering
> fierce, loud cries, and making terrible demonstrations. At length one
> fell down as if mortally wounded; then all the hooded women came in
> again and keened over him, a male voice at intervals reciting his
> deeds, while the pipers played martial tunes. But on its being
> suggested that perhaps he was not dead at all, an herb doctor was sent
> for to look at him; and an aged man with a flowing white beard was led
> in, carrying a huge bundle of herbs. With these he performed sundry
> strange incantations, until finally the dead man sat up and was
> carried off the field by his comrades, with shouts of triumph. So
> ended the first play.

> "Then supper was served and more whisky drunk, after which another
> play was acted of a different kind. A table was set in the middle of
> the barn, and two chairs, while all the people, about a hundred or
> more, gathered round in a circle. Then two men, dressed as judges,
> took their seats, with guards beside them, and called on another man
> to come forth and address the people. On this a young man sprang on
> the table and poured forth an oration in Irish, full of the most
> grotesque fun and sharp allusions, at which the crowd roared with
> laughter. Then he gave out a verse like a psalm, in gibberish Irish,
> and bade the people say it after him. It ran like this, being
> translated--

> "'Yellow Macauly has come from Spain,  
> He brought sweet music out of a bag,  
> Sing
>
> See-saw, Sulla Vick Dhau,  
> Sulla, Sulla Vick Dhau righ.'

> (That is, Solomon, son of David the King.)

> "If any one failed to repeat this verse after him he was ordered to
> prison by the judges, and the guards seized him to cut off his head;
> or if any one laughed the judge sentenced him, saying in Irish, 'Seize
> that man, he is a pagan: he is mocking the Christian faith. Let him
> die!'

> "After this the professional story-teller was in great force, and held
> the listeners enchained by the wonders of his narration and the
> passionate force of his declamation. So the strange revelry went on,
> and the feasting and the drinking, till sunrise, when many of the
> guests returned to their homes, but others stayed with the family till
> tile coffin was lifted for the grave."

> \*

> Full details of these strange wake orgies can seldom be obtained, for
> the people are afraid of the priesthood, who have vehemently denounced
> them. Yet the peasants cling to them with a mysterious reverence, and
> do not see the immorality of many of the wake practices. They accept
> them as mysteries, ancient usages of their forefathers, to be sacredly
> observed, or the vengeance of the dead would fall on them.

> According to all accounts an immense amount of dramatic talent was
> displayed by the actors of these fantastic and symbolic plays. An
> intelligent peasant, who was brought to see the acting at the Dublin
> theatre, declared on his return: "I have now seen the great English
> actors, and heard plays in the English tongue, but poor and dull they
> seemed to me after the acting of our own people at the wakes and
> fairs; for it is a truth, the English cannot make us weep and laugh as
> I have seen the crowds with us when the players played and the poets
> recited their stories."

> The Celts certainly have a strong dramatic tendency, and there are
> many peasant families in Ireland who have been distinguished for
> generations as bards and actors, and have a natural and hereditary
> gift for music and song.

> On the subject of wake orgies, a clever writer observes that they are
> evidently a remnant of paganism, and formed part of those Druidic
> rites meant to propitiate the evil spirits and the demons of darkness
> and doom; for the influence of Druidism lasted long after the
> establishment of Christianity. The Druid priests took shelter with the
> people, and exercised a powerful and mysterious sway over them by
> their magic spells. Druid practices were known to exist down to the
> time of the Norman invasion in the twelfth century, and even for
> centuries after; and to this Druidic influence may be traced the
> sarcasms on Christianity which are occasionally introduced into the
> mystery plays of the wake ceremonial. As in the one called "HoId the
> Light," where the passion of the Lord Christ is travestied with
> grotesque imitation. The same writer describes the play acted at wakes
> called "The Building of the Ship," a symbolic rite still older than
> Druidism, and probably a remnant of the primitive Arkite worship. This
> was followed by a scene called "Drawing the Ship out of the Mud." It
> was against these two plays that the anathemas of the Church were
> chiefly directed, in consequence of their gross immorality, and they
> have now entirely ceased to form any portion of the wake ceremonial of
> Ireland. Hindu priests would recognize some of the ceremonies as time
> same which are still practised in their own temples; and travellers
> have traced a similarity also in these ancient usages to the "big
> canoe games" of the Mandan Indians.

> In the next play, the Hierophant, or teacher of the games, orders all
> the men out of the room; a young girl is then dressed with a hide
> thrown over her, and horns on her head, to simulate a cow, while her
> maidens form a circle and slowly dance round her to music, on which a
> loud knocking is heard at the door. "Who wants to enter?" asks the
> Hierophant. He is answered, "The guards demand admittance for the bull
> who is without." Admittance is refused, and the maidens and the cow
> affect great alarm. Still the knocking goes on, and finally the door
> is burst open and the bull enters. He also is robed with a hide and
> wears horns, and is surrounded by a band of young men as his guards.
> He endeavours to seize the cow, who is defended by her maidens,
> forming the dramatic incidents of the play. A general mock fight now
> takes place between the guards and the maidens, and the scene ends
> with uproarious hilarity and the capture of the cow.

> There are other practices mentioned by writers on the subject, who
> trace in the Irish observances a tradition of the Cabyric rites, and
> also a striking similarity to the idolatrous practices of Hindustan as
> described in the "Asiatic Researches," and in Moore's "Hindu
> Pantheon."

> It is remarkable also that in the Polynesian Islands the funeral rites
> were accompanied by somewhat similar ceremonies. These the early
> missionaries viewed with horror, and finally succeeded in extirpating
> them.

> These ancient funeral rites have now disappeared in Ireland; still the
> subject remains one of intense interest to the ethnologist and
> antiquary, who will find in the details indications of the oldest
> idolatries of the world, especially of that primitive religion called
> Arkite, as in the dramatic performance called "The Building of the
> Ship," where one man prostrates himself on the ground as the ship,
> while two others sit head and foot to represent the prow and stern.
> This ship drama is, perhaps, a fragment of the earliest tradition of
> humanity represented by a visible symbol to illustrate the legend of
> the Deluge.
