The Doom

> THERE was a young man of Innismore, named James Lynan, noted through
> all the island for his beauty and strength. Never a one could beat him
> at hunting or wrestling, and he was, besides, the best dancer in the
> whole townland. But he was bold and reckless, and ever foremost in all
> the wild wicked doings of the young fellows of the place.

> One day he happened to be in chapel after one of these mad freaks, and
> the priest denounced him by name from the altar.

> "James Lynan," he said, "remember my words; you will come to an ill
> end. The vengeance of God will fall on-you for your wicked life; and
> by the power that is in me I denounce you as an evil liver and a limb
> of Satan, and accursed of all good men."

> The young man turned pale, and fell on his knees before all the
> people, crying out bitterly, "Have mercy, have mercy; I repent, I
> repent," and he wept like a woman.

> "Go now in peace," said the priest," and strive to lead a new life,
> and I'll pray to God to save your soul."

> From that day forth James Lynan changed his ways. He gave up drinking,
> and never a drop of spirits crossed his lips. And he began to attend
> to his farm and his business, in place of being at all the mad revels
> and dances and fairs and wakes in the island. Soon after he married a
> nice girl, a rich farmer's daughter, from the mainland, and they had
> four fine children, and all things prospered with him.

> But the priest's words never left his mind, and he would suddenly turn
> pale and a shivering would come over him when the memory of the curse
> came upon him. Still he prospered, and his life was a model of
> sobriety and order.

> One day he and his wife and their children were asked to the wedding
> of a friend about four miles off; and James Lynan rode to the place,
> the family going on their own car. At the wedding he was the life of
> the party as he always was; but never a drop of drink touched his
> lips. When evening came on, the family set out for the return home
> just as they had set out; the wife and children on the car, James
> Lynan riding his own horse. But when the wife arrived at home, she
> found her husband's horse standing at the gate riderless and quite
> still. They thought he might have fallen in a faint, and went back to
> search; when he was found down in a hollow not five perches from his
> own gate, lying quite insensible and his features distorted
> frightfully, as if seized while looking on some horrible vision.

> They carried him in, but he never spoke. A doctor was sent for, who
> opened a vein, but no blood came. There he lay like a log, speechless
> as one dead. Amongst the crowd that gathered round was an old woman
> accounted very wise by the people.

> "Send for the fairy doctor," she said; "he is struck."

> So they sent off a boy on the fastest horse for the fairy man. He
> could not come himself, but he filled a bottle with a potion. Then he
> said--"Ride for your life; give him some of this to drink and sprinkle
> his face and hands also with it. But take care as you pass the lone
> bush on the round hill near the hollow, for the fairies are there and
> will hinder you if they can, and strive to break the bottle."

> Then the fairy man blew into the mouth and the eyes and the nostrils
> of the horse, and turned him round three times on the road and rubbed
> the dust off his hoofs.

> "Now go," he said to the boy; "go and never look behind you, no matter
> what you hear."

> So the boy went like the wind, having placed the bottle safely in his
> pocket; and when he came to the lone bush the horse started and gave
> such a jump that the bottle nearly fell, but the boy caught it in time
> and held it safe and rode on. Then he heard a cluttering of feet
> behind him, as of men in pursuit; but he never turned or looked, for
> he knew it was the fairies who were after him. And shrill voices cried
> to him, "Ride fast, ride fast, for the spell is cast!" Still he never
> turned round, but rode on, and never let go his hold of the fairy
> draught till he stopped at his master's door, and handed the potion to
> the poor sorrowing wife. And she gave of it to the sick man to drink,
> and sprinkled his face and hands, after which he fell into a deep
> sleep. But when he woke up, though he knew every one around him, the
> power of speech was gone from him; and from that time to his death,
> which happened soon after, he never uttered word more.

> So the doom of the priest was fulfilled--evil was his youth and evil
> was his fate, and sorrow and death found him at last, for the doom of
> the priest is as the word of God.
