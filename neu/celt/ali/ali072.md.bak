The Banshee

> THE Banshee means, especially, the woman of the fairy race, from
> *van,* "the Woman--the Beautiful;" the same word from which comes
> *Venus.* Shiloh-Van was one of the names of Buddha--"the son of the
> woman;" and some writers aver that in the Irish--*Sullivan*
> (Sulli-van), may be found this ancient name of Buddha.

> As the Leanan-Sidhe was the acknowledged *spirit of life,* giving
> inspiration to the poet and the musician, so the Ban-Sidhe was the
> *spirit of death,* the most weird and awful of all the fairy powers.

> But only certain families of historic lineage, or persons gifted with
> music and song, are attended by this spirit; for music and poetry are
> fairy gifts, and the possessors of them show kinship to the spirit
> race--therefore they are watched over by the spirit of life, which is
> prophecy and inspiration; and by the spirit of doom, which is the
> revealer of the secrets of death.

> Sometimes the Banshee assumes the form of some sweet singing virgin of
> the family who died young, and has been given the mission by the
> invisible powers to become the harbinger of coming doom to her mortal
> kindred. Or she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched
> beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face; or flying past in the
> moonlight, crying bitterly: and the cry of thus spirit is mournful
> beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some
> member of the family whenever it. is heard in the silence of the
> night.

> \*

> The Banshee even follows the old race across the ocean and to distant.
> lands; for space and the offer no hindrance to the mystic power which
> is selected and appointed to bear the prophecy of death to a family.
> Of this a well authenticated instance happened a few years ago, and
> many now living can attest the truth of the narrative.

> A branch of the ancient race of the O'Gradys had settled in Canada,
> far removed, apparently, from all the associations, traditions, and
> mysterious influences of the old land of their fore-fathers.

> But one night a strange and mournful lamentation was heard outside the
> house. No word was uttered, only a bitter cry, as of one in deepest
> agony and sorrow, floated through the air.

> Inquiry was made, but no one had been seen near the house at the time,
> though several persons distinctly heard the weird, unearthly cry, and
> a terror fell upon the household, as if some supernatural influence
> had overshadowed them.

> Next day it so happened that the gentleman and his eldest son went out
> boating. As they did not return, however, at the usual time for
> dinner, some alarm was excited, and messengers were sent down to the
> shore to look for them. But no tidings came until, precisely at the
> exact hour of the night when the spirit-cry had been heard the
> previous evening, a crowd of men were seen approaching the house,
> bearing with them the dead bodies of the father and the son, who had
> both been drowned by the accidental upsetting of the boat, within
> sight of land, but not near enough for any help to reach them in time.

> Thus the Ban-Sidhe had fulfilled her mission of doom, after which she
> disappeared, 'and the cry of the spirit of death was heard no more.

> \*

> At times the spirit-voice is heard in low and soft lamenting, as if
> close to the window.

> Not long ago an ancient lady of noble lineage was lying near the
> death-hour in her stately castle. One evening, after twilight., she
> suddenly unclosed her eyes and pointed to the window, with a happy
> smile on her face. All present looked in the direction, but nothing
> was visible. They heard, however, the sweetest music, low, soft, and
> spiritual, floating round the house, and at times apparently close to
> the window of the sick room.

> Many of the attendants thought it was a trick, and went out to search
> the grounds; but nothing human was seen. Still the wild plaintive
> singing went on, wandering through the trees like the night wind--a
> low, beautiful music that never ceased all through the night.

> Next morning the noble lady lay dead; then the music ceased, and the
> lamentation from that hour was heard no more.

> \*

> There was a gentleman also in the same country who had a beautiful
> daughter, strong and healthy, and a splendid horsewoman. She always
> followed the hounds, and her appearance at the hunt attracted
> unbounded admiration, as no one rode so well or looked so beautiful.

> One evening there was a ball after the hunt, and the young girl moved
> through the dance with the grace of a fairy queen.

> But that same night a voice came close to the father's window, as if
> the face were laid close to the glass, and he heard a mournful
> lamentation and a cry; and the words rang out on the air--"In three
> weeks death; in three weeks the grave--dead--dead--dead!"

> Three times the voice came, and three times he heard the words; but
> though it. was bright moonlight, and he looked from the window over
> all the park, no form was to be seen.

> Next day, his daughter showed symptoms of fever, and exactly in three
> weeks, as the Ban-Sidhe had prophesied, the beautiful girl lay dead.

> The night before her death soft music was heard outside the house,
> though no word was spoken by the spirit-voice, and the family said the
> form of a woman crouched beneath a tree, with a mantle covering her
> head, was\~ distinctly visible. But on approaching, the phantom
> disappeared, though the soft, low music of the lamentation continued
> till dawn.

> Then the angel of death entered the house with soundless feet, and he
> breathed upon the beautiful face of the young girl, and she rested in
> the sleep of the dead, beneath the dark shadows of his wings.

> Thus the prophecy of the Banshee came true, according to the time
> foretold by the spirit-voice.
