Edain the Queen

> Now it happened that the king of Munster one day saw a beautiful girl
> bathing, and he loved her and made her his queen. And in all the land
> was no woman so lovely to look upon as the fair Edain, and the fame of
> her beauty came to the ears of the great and powerful chief and king
> of the Tuatha-de-Danann, Midar by name. So he disguised himself and
> went to the court of the king of Munster, as a wandering bard, that he
> might look on the beauty of Edain. And he challenged the king to a
> game of chess.

> "Who is this man that I should play chess with him? "said the king.

> "Try me," said the stranger; "you will find me a worthy foe." Then the
> king said--

> " But the chess-board is in the queen's apartment, and I cannot
> disturb her."

> However, when the queen heard that a stranger had challenged the king
> to chess, she sent her page in with the chess-board, and then came
> herself to greet the stranger. And Midar was so dazzled with her
> beauty, that he could not speak, he could only gaze on her. And the
> queen also seemed troubled, and after a time she left them alone.

> "Now, what shall we play for?" asked the king.

> "Let the conqueror name the reward," answered the stranger, "and
> whatever he desires let it be granted to him."

> "Agreed," replied the monarch.

> Then they played the game arid the stranger won. "What is your demand
> now?" cried the king. "I have given my word that whatever you name
> shall be yours."

> "I demand the Lady Edain, the queen, as my reward," replied the
> stranger. "But I shall not ask you to give her up to me till, this day
> year." And the stranger departed.

> Now the king was utterly perplexed and confounded, but he took good
> note of the time, and on that night just a twelvemonth after, he made
> a great feast at Tara for all the princes, and he placed three lines
> of his chosen warriors all round the palace, and forbade any stranger
> to enter on pain of death. So all being secure, as he thought, he took
> his place at the feast with the beautiful Edain beside him, all
> glittering with jewels and a golden crown on her head, and the revelry
> went on till midnight. Just then, to his horror, the king looked up,
> and there stood the stranger in the middle of the hall, but no one
> seemed to perceive him save only the king. He fixed his eyes on the
> queen, and coming towards her, he struck the golden harp he had in his
> hand and sang in a low sweet voice--

> "O Edain, wilt thou come with me  
> To a wonderful palace that is mine?  
> White are the teeth there, and black the brows,  
> And crimson as the mead are the lips of the lovers.

> "O woman, if thou comest to my proud people,  
> 'Tis a golden crown shall circle thy head,  
> Thou shalt dwell by the sweet streams of my land,  
> And drink of the mead and wine in the arms of thy lover."

> Then he gently put his arm round the queen's waist, and drew her up
> from her royal throne, and went forth with her through the midst of
> all the guests, none hindering, and the king himself was like one in a
> dream, and could neither speak nor move. But when he recovered
> himself, then he knew that the stranger was one of the fairy chiefs of
> the Tuatha-de-Danann who had carried off the beautiful Edain to his
> fairy mansion. So he sent round messengers to all the kings of Erin
> that they should destroy all the forts of the hated Tuatha race, and
> slay and kill and let none live till the queen, his young bride, was
> brought back to him. Still she came not. Then the king out of revenge
> ordered his men to block up all the stables where the royal horses of
> the Dananna were kept, that so they might die of hunger; but the
> horses were of noble blood, and no bars or bolts could hold them, and
> they broke through the bars and rushed out like the whirlwind, and
> spread all over the country. And the kings, when they saw the beauty
> of the horses, forgot all about the search for Queen Edain, and only
> strove how they could seize and hold as their own some of the fiery
> steeds with the silver hoofs and golden bridles. Then the king raged
> in his wrath, and sent for the chief of the Druids, and told him he
> should be put to death unless he discovered the place where the queen
> lay hid. So the Druid went over all Ireland, and searched, and made
> spells with oghams, and at last, having carved four oghams on four
> wands of a hazel-tree, it was revealed to him that deep down in a hill
> in the very centre of Ireland, Queen Edain was hidden away in the
> enchanted palace of Midar the fairy chief.

> Then the king gathered a great army, and they circled the hill, and
> dug down and down till they came to the very centre; and just as they
> reached the gate of the fairy palace, Midar by his enchantments sent
> forth fifty beautiful women from the hillside, to distract the
> attention of the warriors, all so like the queen in form and features
> and dress, that the king himself could not make out truly, if his own
> wife were amongst them or not. But Edain, when she saw her husband so
> near her, was touched by love of him in her heart, and the power of
> the enchantment fell from her soul, and she came to him, and he lifted
> her up on his horse and kissed her tenderly, and brought her back
> safely to his royal palace of Tara, where they lived happily ever
> after.

>  

> But soon after the power of time Tuatha-de-Danann was broken for ever,
> and the remnant that was left took refuge in the caves where they
> exist to this day, and practise their magic, and work spells, amid are
> safe from death until the judgment day.
