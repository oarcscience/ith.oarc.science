Music

> Music formed the chief part of education in ancient Ireland as in
> Greece, where the same word signified a song and a law. Laws,
> religion, sciences, and history were all taught in music to the Irish
> people by the *Ollamhs,* or learned men. The Poets chanted the
> *Ros-Catha,* or song of battle, to incite the warriors to deeds of
> bravery. The Bards recited the deeds of the chiefs, or pleasant tales
> of love, at the festivals, and struck the harp to sustain the voice.
> The Brehons intoned the *law* in a recitative or monotone chant,
> seated on an eminence in the open air, while all the people were
> gathered round to listen. The Senachie chanted the history,
> genealogies, and traditions of the tribe, and the female mourners were
> instructed by the poets in the elegiac measure, or funeral wail over
> the dead.

> The poet-power was also believed to confer the gift of prophecy; and
> no great expedition was undertaken by the tribe without the advice and
> sanction of the bard, and especially. of the poet-priestess of the
> tribe. Thus Ethna the poetess stood on a bight stone at the battle of
> Moytura, and gave inspiration by her chants to the warriors of the
> Tuatha-de-Dananns, and stimulated their courage by her prophecies of
> victory; and the stone she stood on is in existence to this day on the
> plain of the battle, and is still called by the people "the Stone of
> the Prophetess."
