The Bride's Well

> NEAR the last-named well is the Bride's Well, *Tober Breda* (the holy
> well of St. Bridget). There is a stone oratory here of fabulous
> antiquity, with a doorway fashioned after the Egyptian model, sloping
> towards the top; also an ancient white-thorn covered with votive
> offerings, amongst which one may see many a long lock of the splendid
> dark hair of the Irish southern women, who adopt this antique
> traditional symbol of self-sacrifice to show their gratitude to the
> patron saint.

> St. Bridget took the name of time pagan goddess Brighita in order to
> destroy and obliterate the idolatrous rites and transfer the devotion
> of the people to the Christian ceremonies, and *Tober-Breda* is now
> considered of the highest sanctity, being under the Special patronage
> of St. Bridget.
