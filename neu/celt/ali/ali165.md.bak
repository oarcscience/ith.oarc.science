Fairy Power

> It is on Fridays that the fairies have the most power to work evil;
> therefore Friday is an unlucky day to begin work, or to go on a
> journey, or to have a wedding; for the spirits are then present
> everywhere, and hear and see everything that is going on, and will mar
> and spoil all they can, just out of malice and jealousy of the mortal
> race.

> It is then they strike cattle with their elfin sorrows, lame a horse,
> steal the milk, and carry off the handsome children, an ugly
> changeling in exchange, who is soon known to fairy sprite by its
> voracious appetite, without iany natural increase in growth.

> This superstition makes the peasant-women often very crueI towards
> weakly children; and the trial by fire is sometimes resorted to in
> order to test the nature of the child who is suspected of being a
> changeling. For this purpose a fairy woman is usually sent for, who
> makes a drink for the little patient of certain herbs of whose power
> she alone has the secret knowledge, and a childless woman is
> considered the best to make the potion. Should there be no improvement
> in the child after the treatment with herbs, then the witch-women
> sometimes resorts to terrible measures to test the fairy nature of the
> sufferer.

> A child who was suspected of being a change because he was wasted and
> thin and always restless and fretful was ordered by the witch-woman to
> be placed for three nights on a shovel outside the door from sunset to
> sunrise, during which he was given foxglove to chew, and cold water
> was flung over him to banish the fire-devil. The screams of the child
> at night was frightful, calling on his mother to come and take him in;
> but the fairy doctor told the mother not to fear; the fairies were
> certainly tormenting him, but by the third night their power would
> cease, and the child, would be quite restored. However, on the third
> night the poor little child lay dead.
