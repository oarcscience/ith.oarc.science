Fairy Nature

> THE *Siodh-Dune,* or the Mount of Peace, is also a favourite resort of
> the fairies. It is an ancient, sacred place, where the Druids in old
> time used to retire to pray, when they desired solitude: and the
> fairies meet there every seven years to perform the act of lamentation
> and mourning for having been cast out of heaven.

> Earth, lake, and hill are peopled by these fantastic, beautiful gods
> of earth; the wilful, capricious child-spirits of the world. The Irish
> seem to have created this strange fairy race after their own image,
> for in all things they strangely resemble time Irish character.

> The Sidhe passionately love beauty and luxury, and hold in contempt
> all the mean virtues of thrift, and economy. Above all things they
> hate the close, niggard hand that gathers the last grain, and drains
> the last drop in the milk-pail, and plucks the trees bare of fruit,
> leaving nothing for time spirits who wander by in the moonlight. They
> like food and wine to be left for them at night, yet they are very
> temperate; no one ever saw an intoxicated fairy.

> But people should not sit up too late; for time fairies like to gather
> round the smouldering embers after the family are in bed, and drain
> the wine-cup, and drink the milk which a good house-wife always leaves
> for them, in case the fairies should come in and want their supper. A
> vessel of pure water should also be left for them to bathe in, if they
> like. And in all things the fairies are fond of being made much of,
> and flattered and attended to; and the fairy blessing will come back
> in return to the giver for what-ever act of kindness he has done to
> the spirits of the hill and the cave. Some unexpected good fortune or
> stroke of luck will come upon his house or his children; for the fairy
> race is not ungrateful, and is powerful over man both for good amid
> evil.

> Therefore be kind to the wayfarer, for he may be a fairy prince in
> disguise, who has come to test the depth of your charity, and of the
> generous nature that can give liberally out of pure love and
> kindliness to those who are in need, and not in hope of a reward.

> If treated well, the fairies will discover the hidden pot of gold, and
> reveal the mysteries of herbs, amid give knowledge to the fairy women
> of the mystic spells that can cure disease, and save life, amid make
> the lover loved.

> All they ask in return is to be left in quiet possession of the rath
> and the hill and the ancient hawthorn trees that have been theirs from
> time immemorial, and where they lead a joyous life with music and
> dance, and charming little suppers of the nectar of flowers, down in
> the crystal caves, lit by the diamonds that stud the rocks.

> But some small courtesies they require. Never drain your wine-glass
> at. a feast, nor the poteen flask, nor the milk-pail; and never rake
> out all the fire at night, it looks mean, and the fairies like a
> little of everything going, and to have the hearth comfortable and
> warm when they come in to hold a council after all the mortal people
> have gone to bed. In fact, the fairies are born aristocrats, true
> ladies and gentlemen, and if treated with proper respect are never in
> time least malignant or ill-natured.

> All the traditions of the fairies show that they love beauty and
> splendour, grace of movement, music and pleasure; everything, in fact,
> that is artistic, in contradistinction to violent, brutal enjoyment.
> Only an Aryan people, therefore, could have invented the Sidhe race.
