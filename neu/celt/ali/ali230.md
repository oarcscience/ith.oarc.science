Sketches of the Irish Past

The Bardic Race

> THE magi, the Sephoe, the gymnosophists, and the Irish adepts, held
> much the same creed and the same dogmas with regard to the conduct of
> life necessary to heighten the spiritual power. They all abstained
> from animal food at such times as the rush of inspiration was on them
> and the madness of prophetic rage; and at all times they favoured
> solitude, living apart in the House of Learning or Bardic College,
> where they admitted no obtrusive intimacies with lower intellects to
> disturb their lofty and exalted moods of thought. The means, also, by
> which they obtained mastery over diseases and the minds of men, with
> the strange and subtle use they made of herbs, were all kept secret
> amongst themselves; for they held that the prying eyes of shallow
> unbelievers should never be suffered to intrude upon the sacred
> mysteries. And it is certain that the bards possessed strange and
> mystic powers of wisdom beyond and above all other men. It was
> therefore very dangerous to offend a poet. If any one refused him a
> request he would take the lobe of the person's ear and grind it
> between his fingers, and the man would die. Yet the bards were capable
> of much human emotion, and were the sweet singers of sympathy when
> sorrow touched a household.

> The following elegy from the Irish, written about two hundred years
> ago by the Ard-Filé, or chief poet of the tribe, has many natural,
> pathetic touches, and when chanted in Irish to the harp had power to
> melt the hearts of all the hearers to tears.

>  

> AN ELEGY.

> O Boyne, once famed for battles, sports, and conflicts,  
> And great heroes of the race of Conn,  
> Art thou grey after all thy blooms?  
> O agèd old woman of grey-green pools,  
> O wretched Boyne of many tears.  
>   
> Where is the glory of thy sires?  
> The glory of Art with the swift arrow;  
> Of Meiltan, with the swift-darting spears;  
> Of the lordly race of the O'Neil?  
> To thee belonged red victory,  
> When the Fenian wrath was kindled,  
> And the heroes in thousands rode to war,  
> And the bridles clanked on the steeds.  
>   
> O river of kings and the sons of kings,  
> Of the swift bark and the silver fish,  
> I lay my blessing on thee with my tears,  
> For thou art the watcher by a grave--  
> My treasures lie in the earth at thy side--  
> O Boyne of many tears.  
>   
> My sons lie there in their strength,  
> My little daughter in her beauty--  
> Rory, and Brian, and Rose--  
> These have I given against my will,  
> My blood, my heart, my bone and kin,  
> My love and my life, to the grave.  
>   
> The blessing of men was on them,  
> The blessings of thousands that loved them,  
> From Kells of the Crosses to Drogheda--  
> Eight thousand blessings to Dowth of the Trees.  
> Peace be on the earth where they lie!  
> By the royal stream of the kings,  
> In the land of the great O'Neil.

> The Bardic song amongst all nations was the first expression of the
> human soul, with all its strong, passionate emotions and heroic
> impulses. It is remarkable that, although several invasions of Ireland
> are on record, yet but one language seems to have existed there from
> the earliest times down to the coming of the Anglo-Normans in the
> twelfth century, The Bards held it as their peculiar duty to raise
> this language to the highest perfection, and the laws of Celtic
> poetry, especially, were most elaborate and the structure of the verse
> exceedingly difficult. Ten years of study were allowed the students at
> the Druids' College to gain perfection in the art, and also to
> practise the memory; for at the royal festivals the Ard-Filé was
> expected to recite fully and perfectly whatever heroic tale might be
> called for by the king at the banquet. On great occasions also, when
> the meeting was held in the open air, the chiefs sat round in a circle
> on mounds of turf, to the accompaniment of the harp, the chorus
> joining in the while the bards, standing in the centre, recited the
> heroic narrative lyrical portions at intervals, and a circle of
> harpists at the outermost ring of the assemblage introduced occasional
> symphonies of pure instrumental music to give the bards time for rest
> between the parts of the recitation.

> There were three chief measures in music in use amongst the
> poets--"the Sorrowful," or the chant for the dead; "the Delightful,"
> reserved for dances and festivities; and "the Reposing," devoted
> entirely to love sonnets and the plaintive softness of lyrical
> expression. But the *Ross- Catha,* or battle-hymn, was the great
> war-song to which the warriors marched to battle, and which inspired
> them with the heroic madness that braved death for victory.

> Everything connected with the bards is interesting. They were so
> gifted, so learned, and so beautiful. For even genius was not
> considered enough, without beauty, to warrant a young man being
> enrolled in the ranks of the poets. A noble, stately presence was
> indispensable, and the poet was required not only to be gifted, but to
> be handsome. Then he was promoted through all the grades until he
> reached the last and highest, called "The Wisdom of the Gods," but the
> knowledge then acquired by the initiated was kept sacred from the
> crowd, and the adept swore by the sun, the stars, and the hosts of
> heaven never to reveal the mysteries acquired by his initiation, to
> the profane.

> The high-born maidens amongst the noble families were also trained by
> the Druids in poetry and music, and in the exercise of the chase, such
> as archery and throwing the lance, to give their bodies health, vigour
> and beauty, while those endowed with peculiar intellect were admitted
> into the bardic orders, and became the priestess, prophetess, or
> poetess of the tribe; who inspired men by her eloquence and had power
> by her incantations over the deep mysteries of life. Such was Eodain,
> the chief poetess of Erin, the guide and inspirer of Eugene, the king
> of the South, the prophetess of her nation, who saved him and his
> kingdom from ruin by her wisdom, and redeemed him by her counsels from
> his dissolute and evil life.
