The Story of Breccan

> The story of Breccan is related in Cormac's Glossary. He was a
> merchant who traded between Ireland and Scotland with fifty corracles.
> Now there was a great whirlpool at Rathlin Island caused by the
> meeting of the seas, and they formed a caldron vast enough to swallow
> all Ireland. And it happened on a time that Breccan and all his
> corracles were lost and engulfed in this caldron. Not a man was left
> to tell the tale of how or where they had perished. Thus it was that
> the skull of a small animal being discovered on the beach, it was
> brought to the blind poet, who laying his staff on it obtained the
> inner vision by which he revealed the fate of Breccan and his fifty
> corracles.
