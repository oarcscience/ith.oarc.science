Introduction

> THE ancient legends of all nations of the world, on which from age to
> age the generations of man have been nurtured, bear so striking a
> resemblance to each other that we are led to believe there was once a
> period when the whole human family was of one creed and one language.
> But with increasing numbers came the necessity of dispersion; and that
> ceaseless migration was commenced of the tribes of the earth from the
> Eastern cradle of their race which has now continued for thousands of
> years with undiminished activity.

> From the beautiful Eden-land at the head of the Persian Gulf, where
> creeds and culture rose to life, the first migrations emanated, and
> were naturally directed along the line of the great rivers, by the
> Euphrates and the Tigris and southward by the Nile; and there the
> first mighty cities of the world were built, and the first mighty
> kingdoms of the East began to send out colonies to take possession of
> the unknown silent world around them. From Persia, Assyria, and Egypt,
> to Greece and the Isles of the Sea, went forth the wandering tribes,
> carrying with them, as signs of their origin, broken fragments of the
> primal creed, and broken idioms of the primal tongue--those early
> pages in the history of the human race, eternal and indestructible,
> which hundreds of centuries have not been able to obliterate from the
> mind of man. But as the early tribes diverged from the central parent
> stock, the creed and the language began to assume new forms, according
> as new habits of life and modes of thought were developed amongst the
> wandering people, by the influence of climate and the contemplation of
> new and striking natural phenomena in the lands where they found a
> resting-place or a home. Still, amongst all nations a basis remained
> of the primal creed and language, easily to be traced through all the
> mutations caused by circumstances in human thought, either by higher
> culture or by the debasement to which both language and symbols are
> subjected amongst rude and illiterate tribes.

> To reconstruct the primal creed and language of humanity from these
> scattered and broken fragments, is the task which is now exciting so
> keenly the energies of the ardent and learned ethnographers of Europe;
> as yet, indeed, with but small success as regards language, for not
> more, perhaps, than twenty words which the philologists consider may
> have belonged to the original tongue have been discovered; that is,
> certain objects or ideas are found represented in all languages by the
> same words, and therefore the philologist concludes that these words
> must have been associated with the ideas from the earliest dawn of
> language and as the words express chiefly the relations of the human
> family to each other, they remained fixed in the minds of the
> wandering tribes, untouched and unchanged by all the diversities of
> their subsequent experience of life.

> Meanwhile, in Europe there is diligent study of the ancient myths,
> legends, and traditions of the world, in order to extract from them
> that information respecting the early modes of thought prevalent
> amongst the primitive race, and also the lines of the first
> migrations, which no other monuments of antiquity are so well able to
> give. Traditions, like rays of light, take their colour from the
> medium through which they pass; but the scientific mythographic
> student knows how to eliminate the accidental addition from the true
> primal basis, which remains fixed and unchangeable; and from the
> numerous myths and legends of the nations of the earth, which bear so
> striking a conformity to each other that they point to a common
> origin, he will be able to reconstruct the first articles of belief in
> the creed of humanity, and to pronounce almost with certainty upon the
> primal source of the lines of human life that now traverse the globe
> in all directions. This source of all life, creed, and culture now on
> earth, there is no reason to doubt, will be found in *Iran,* or Persia
> as we call it, and in the ancient legends and language of the great
> Iranian people, the head and noblest type of the Aryan races. Endowed
> with splendid physical beauty, noble intellect, and a rich musical
> language, the Iranians had also a lofty sense of the relation between
> man and the spiritual world. They admitted no idols into their
> temples; their God was the One Supreme Creator and Upholder of all
> things, whose symbol was the sun and the pure, elemental fire. But as
> the world grew older and more wicked the pure primal doctrines were
> obscured by human fancies, the symbol came to be worshipped in place
> of the God, and the debased idolatries of Babylon, Assyria, and the
> Canaanite nations were the result. Egypt--grave, wise, learned,
> mournful Egypt--retained most of the primal truth; but truth was held
> by the priests as too precious for the crowd, and so they preserved it
> carefully for themselves and their own caste. They alone knew the
> ancient and cryptic meaning of the symbols; the people were allowed
> only to see the outward and visible sign.

> From Egypt, philosophy, culture, art, and religion came to Greece, but
> the Greeks moulded these splendid elements after their own fashion,
> and poured the radiance of beauty over the grave and gloomy mysticism
> of Egypt. Everything hideous, terrible, and revolting was banished
> from the Greek Mythology. The Greeks constructed no theory of a devil,
> and believed in no hell, as a distinct and eternal abode for the lost
> souls of men. The Greek gods were divinely beautiful, and each
> divinity in turn was ready to help the mortal that invoked him. The
> dead in Hades mourned their fate because they could no longer enjoy
> the glorious beauty of life, but no hard and chilling dogmas doomed
> them there to the tortures of eternal punishment. Earth, air, the
> heavens and the sea, the storms and sunshine, the forests and flowers
> and the purple grapes with which they crowned a god, were all to the
> Greek poet-mind the manifestations of an all-pervading spiritual power
> and life. A sublime Pantheism was their creed, that sees gods in
> everything, yet with one Supreme God over all. Freedom, beauty, art,
> light, and joy, were the elements of the Greek religion, while the
> Eternal Wisdom, the Great Athene of the Parthenon, was the peculiar
> and selected divinity of their own half divine race.

> Meanwhile other branches of the primal Iranian stock were spreading
> over the savage central forests of Europe, where they laid the
> foundation of the great Teuton and Gothic races, the destined
> world-rulers; but Nature to them was a gloomy and awful mother, and
> life seemed an endless warfare against the fierce and powerful
> elemental demons of frost and snow and darkness, by whom the beautiful
> Sun-god wars slain, and who reigned triumphant in that fearful season
> when the earth was iron and the air was ice, and no beneficent God
> seemed near to help. Hideous idols imaged these unseen powers, who
> were propitiated by sanguinary rites; and the men and the god they
> fashioned were alike as fierce and cruel as the wild beasts of the
> forest, and the aspects of the savage nature around them.

> Still the waves of human life kept rolling westward until they surged
> over all the lands and islands of the Great Sea, and the wandering
> mariners, seeking new homes, passed through the Pillars of Hercules
> out into the Western Ocean, and coasting along by the shores of Spain
> and France, founded nations that still bear the impress of their
> Eastern origin, and are known in history as the Celtic race; while the
> customs, usages, and traditions which their forefathers had learnt in
> Egypt or Greece were carefully preserved by them, and transmitted as
> heirlooms to the colonies they founded. From Spain the early mariners
> easily reached the verdant island of the West in which we Irish are
> more particularly interested. And here in our beautiful Ireland the
> last wave of the great Iranian migration finally settled. Further
> progress was impossible--the unknown ocean seemed to them the limits
> of the world. And thus the wanderers of the primal race, with their
> fragments of the ancient creed and mythic poet-lore, and their
> peculiar dialect of the ancient tongue, formed, as it were, a sediment
> here which still retains its peculiar affinity with the parent
> land--though the changes and chances of three thousand years have
> swept over the people, the legends, and the language. It is,
> therefore, in Ireland, above all, that the nature and origin of the
> primitive races of Europe should be studied. Even the form of the
> Celtic head shows a decided conformity to that of the Greek races,
> while it differs essentially from the Saxon and Gothic types. This is
> one of the many proofs in support of the theory that the Celtic people
> in their westward course to the Atlantic travelled by the coasts of
> the Mediterranean, as all along that line the same cranial formation
> is found. Philologists also affirm that the Irish language is nearer
> to Sanskrit than any other of the living and spoken languages of
> Europe; while the legends and myths of Ireland can be readily traced
> to the far East, but have nothing in common with the fierce and weird
> superstitions of Northern mythology.

> This study of legendary lore, as a foundation for the history of
> humanity, is now recognized as such an important branch of ethnology
> that a journal entirely devoted to comparative mythology has been
> recently started in Paris, to which all nations are invited to
> contribute--Selaves, Teutons, and Celts, Irish legends being
> considered specially important, as containing more of the primitive
> elements than those of other Western nations. All other countries have
> been repeatedly overwhelmed by alien tribes and peoples and races, but
> the Irish have remained unchanged, and in place of adopting readily
> the usages of invaders they have shown such remarkable powers of
> fascination that the invaders themselves became *Hibernicis ipsis
> Hiberniores.* The Danes held the east coast of Ireland for three
> hundred years, yet there is no trace of Thor or Odin or the Frost
> Giants, or of the Great World-serpent in Irish legend; but if we go
> back in the history of the world to the beginning of things, when the
> Iranian people were the only teachers of humanity, we come upon the
> true ancient source of Irish legend, and find that the original
> materials have been but very slightly altered, while amongst other
> nations the ground-work has been overlaid with a dense palimpsest of
> their own devising, suggested by their peculiar local surroundings.

> Amongst the earliest religious symbols of the world are the Tree, the
> Woman, and the Serpent--memories, no doubt, of the legend of Paradise;
> and the reverence for certain sacred trees has prevailed in Persia
> from the most ancient times, and become diffused among all the Iranian
> nations. It was the custom in Iran to hang costly garments on the
> branches as votive offerings; and it is recorded that Xerxes before
> going to battle invoked victory by the Sacred Tree, and hung jewels
> and rich robes on the boughs. And the poet Saadi narrates an anecdote
> concerning trees which has the true Oriental touch of mournful
> suggestion:--He was once, he says, the guest of a very rich old man
> who had a son remarkable for his beauty. One night the old man said to
> him, "During my whole life I never had but this son. Near this place
> is a Sacred Tree to which men resort to offer up their petitions. Many
> nights at the foot of this tree I besought God until He bestowed on me
> this son." Not long after Saadi overheard this young man say in a low
> voice to his friend, "how happy should I be to know where that Sacred
> Tree grows, in order that I might implore God for the death of my
> father."

> The poorer class in Persia, not being able to make offerings of costly
> garments, are in the habit of tying bits of coloured stuffs on the
> boughs, and these rags are considered to have a special virtue in
> curing diseases. The trees are often near a well or by a saint's
> grave, and are then looked upon as peculiarly sacred.

> This account might have been written for Ireland, for the belief and
> the ceremonial are precisely similar, and are still found existing to
> this day both in *Iran* and in *Erin.* But all trees were not held
> sacred--only those that bore no eatable fruit that could nourish men;
> a lingering memory of the tree of evil fruit may have caused this
> prejudice, while the Tree of Life was eagerly sought for, with its
> promised gift of immortality. In Persia the plane-tree was specially
> reverenced; in Egypt, the palm; in Greece, the wild olive; and the oak
> amongst the Celtic nations. Sometimes small tapers were lit amongst
> the branches, to simulate by fire the presence of divinity. It is
> worthy of note, while on the subject of Irish and Iranian affinities,
> that the old Persian word for tree is *dar,* and the Irish call their
> sacred tree, the oak, *darragh.*\*

> The belief in a race of supernatural beings, midway between man and
> the Supreme God, beautiful and beneficent, a race that had never known
> the weight of human life, was also part of the creed of the Iranian
> people. They called them *Peris,* or *Feroüers* (fairies); and they
> have some pretty legends concerning the beautiful *Dukhtari Shah
> Perian,* the" Daughter of the King of the Fairies," for a sight of
> whose beauty men pine away in vain desire, but if it. is granted to
> them once to behold her, they die. Every nation believes in the
> existence of these mysterious spirits, with mystic and powerful
> influence over human life and actions, but each nation represents them
> differently, according to national habits and national surroundings.
> Thus, the Russians believe in the phantom

> The *Sidhe,* or Fairies, of Ireland, still preserve all the gentle
> attributes of their ancient. Persian race, for in the soft and equable
> climate of Erin there were no terrible manifestations of nature to be

> there was something irresistibly fascinating in the belief that gentle
> spirits were around, filled with sympathy for the mortal who suffered
> wrong or needed help. But the fairies were sometimes wilful and
> capricious as children, and took dire revenge if any one built over
> their fairy circles, or looked at them when combing their long yellow
> hair in the sunshine, or dancing in the woods, or floating on the
> lakes. Death was the penalty to all who approached too near, or pried
> too curiously into time mysteries of nature.

> call the dread goddesses "the Eumenides." Their voices were heard in
> the mountain echo, amid their forms seen in the purple and golden
> mountain mist; they whispered amidst the perfumed hawthorn branches;
> the rush of the autumn leaves was the scamper of little elves--red,
> yellow, and brown--wind-driven, and dancing in their glee; and the
> bending of the waving barley was caused by the flight of the Elf King
> and his Court across the fields. They danced with soundless feet, and
> their step was so light that the drops of dew they danced on only
> trembled, but did not break. The fairy music was low and sweet,"
> blinding sweet," like that of the great god Pan by the river; they
> lived only on time nectar in the cups of time flowers, though in their
> fairy palaces sumptuous banquets were offered to the mortals they
> carried off--but woe to the mortal who tasted of fairy food; to eat
> was fatal. All the evil in the world has come by eating.; if Eve had
> only resisted that apple our race might still be in Paradise. The
> Sidhe look with envy on the beautiful young human children, and steal

> fairies are obliged to deliver up a victim to the Evil One, and to
> save their own people they try to abduct some beautiful young mortal
> girl, and her they hand over to the Prince of Darkness.

> Dogmatic religion and science have long since killed the mytho-poetic
> faculty in cultured Europe. It only exists now, naturally and
> instinctively, in children, poets, and the childlike races, like the

> day the old mythology holds its ground with a force and vitality
> untouched by any symptoms of weakness or decay. The Greeks, who are of

> but the Irish, without culture, are eternal children, with all the
> childlike instincts of superstition still strong in them, and capable

> never, like the Greeks, attained to the conception of a race of beings
> nobler than themselves--men stronger and more gifted, with the
> immortal fire of a god in their veins; women divinely beautiful, or
> divinely inspired; but, also, the Irish never defaced the image of God
> in their hearts by infidelity or irreligion. One of the most beautiful
> and sublimely touching records in all human history is that of the
> unswerving devotion of the Irish people to their ancient faith,
> through persecutions and penal enactments more insulting and degrading
> than were ever inflicted in any other land by one Christian sect upon
> another.

> With this peculiarly reverential nature it would be impossible to make
> the Irish a nation of sceptics, even if a whole legion of German
> Rationalists came amongst them to preach a crusade against, all belief
> in the spiritual and the unseen. And the old traditions of their race
> have likewise taken firm hold in their hearts, because they are an
> artistic people, and require objects for their adoration and love, not
> mere abstractions to be accepted by their reason. And they are also a
> nation of poets; the presence of God is ever near them, and the saints
> and angels, and the shadowy beings of earth and air are perpetually
> drawing their minds, through mingled love and fear, to the infinite
> and invisible world. Probably not one tradition or custom that had its
> origin in a religious belief has been lost in Ireland during the long
> course of ages since the first people from Eastern lands arrived and
> settled on our shores. The Baal fires are still lit at Midsummer,
> though no longer in honour of the sun, but of St. John; and the
> peasants still make their cattle pass between two fires--not, indeed,
> as of old, in the name of Moloch, but of some patron saint. That all
> Irish legends point, to the East for their origin, not to the North,
> is certain; to a warm land, not one of icebergs, and thunder crashes
> of the rending of ice-hound rivers, but to a region where the shadow
> of trees, and a cool draught from the sparkling well were life-giving
> blessings. Well-worship could not have originated in a humid country
> like Ireland, where wells can be found at every step, and sky and land
> are ever heavy and saturated with moisture. It must have come from an
> Eastern people, wanderers in a dry and thirsty land, where the
> discovery of a well seemed like the interposition of an angel in man's
> behalf.

> We are told also by the ancient chroniclers that serpent-worship once
> prevailed in Ireland, and that St. Patrick hewed down the serpent idol
> *Crom-'ruadh* (the great worm) and cast it into the Boyne (from whence
> arose the legend that St. Patrick banished all venomous things from
> the island). Now as the Irish never could have seen a serpent, none
> existing in Ireland, this worship must have come from the far East,
> where this beautiful and deadly creature is looked upon as the symbol
> of the Evil One, and worshipped and propitiated by votive offerings,
> as all evil things were in the early world, in the hope of turning
> away their evil hatred from man, and to induce them to show mercy and
> pity; just as the Egyptians propitiated the sacred crocodile by subtle
> flatteries and hung costly jewels in its ears. The Irish, indeed, do
> not seem to have originated any peculiar or national cultus. Their
> funeral ceremonies recall those of Egypt and Greece and other ancient
> Eastern climes, from whence they brought their customs of the Wake,
> the death chant, the mourning women, and the funeral games. In Sparta,
> on the death of a king or great chief, they had a wake and "keen" not
> common to the rest of Greece, but which they said they learned from
> the Phoenicians; and this peculiar usage bears a striking resemblance
> to the Irish practice. All the virtues of the dead were recited, and
> the Greek "Eleleu," the same cry as the "UI-lu-lu" of the Irish, was
> keened over the corpse by the chorus of hired mourning women. The
> custom of selecting women in place of men for the chorus of
> lamentation prevailed throughout all the ancient world, as if an open
> display of grief was thought beneath the dignity of man. It was
> Cassandra gave the keynote for the wail over Hector, and Helen took
> the lead in reciting praises to his honour. The death chants in Egypt,
> Arabia, and Abyssinia all bear a marked resemblance to the Irish;
> indeed the mourning cry is the same in all, and the Egyptian
> lamentation" Hi-loo-loo! Hi-loo-loo! "cried over the dead, was
> probably the original form of the Irish wail.

> The Greeks always endeavoured to lessen the terrors of death, and for
> this reason they established funeral games, and the funeral ceremonies
> took the form of a festival, where they ate and drank and poured
> libations of wine in honour of the dead. The Irish had also their
> funeral games and peculiar dances, women they threw off their upper
> garments, and holding hands in a circle, moved in a slow measure round
> a woman crouched in the centre, with her hands covering her face.
> Another singular part of the ceremony was the entrance of a woman
> wearing a cows head and horns, as it appears upon the scene in the
> Prometheus of Aeschylus. This woman was probably meant to represent
> the horned or crescented moon, the antique Diana, the Goddess of
> Death. The custom of throwing off the garments no doubt originally
> signified tile casting off the garment of the flesh. We brought
> nothing into this world, and it is certain we carry nothing out. The
> soul must stand unveiled before God.

> In the islands off the West Coast of Ireland, where the most ancient
> superstitions still exist, they have a strange custom. No funeral wail
> is allowed to be raised until three hours have elapsed from the moment
> of death, because, they say, the sound of the cries would hinder the
> soul from speaking to God when it stands before Him, and waken up the
> two great dogs that are watching for the souls of the dead in order
> that they may devour them--and the Lord of heaven Himself cannot
> hinder them if once they waken. This tradition of watching by the dead
> in silence, while the soul stands before God, is a fine and solemn
> superstition, which must have had its origin amongst a people of
> intense faith in the invisible world, and is probably of great.
> antiquity.

> The sound of the Irish keen is wonderfully pathetic. No one could
> listen to the long-sustained minor wail of the "Ul-lu-lu" without
> strong. emotion and even tears; and once heard it can never be
> forgotten. Nor is there anything derogatory to grief in the idea of

> aspect of the mourning women crouched around the bier with shrouded
> heads, as they rock themselves to and fro and intone the solemn,
> ancient death-song with a measured cadence, sometimes rising to a
> piercing wail. They seem like weird and shadowy outlines of an
> old-world vision, and at once the imagination is carried back to the
> far-distant East, and the time when all these funeral symbols had a
> mysterious and awful meaning. Sometimes a wail of genuine and bitter
> grief interrupts the chant of the hired mourners. An Irish keen which
> was taken down from the lips of a bereaved mother some years ago, runs
> thus in the literal English version--

> "O women, look on me! Look on me, women! have you ever seen any sorrow
> like mine? Have you ever seen the like of me in my sorrow? Arrah,
> then, my darling, my darling, 'tis your mother that calls you. How

> and your hair was heavy as the wing of a raven, and your skin was
> whiter than the hand of a lady. Is it the stranger must carry me to my
> grave, and my son lying here?"

> This touching lament is so thoroughly Greek in form and sentiment that

> Even the "Arrah" reminds one of a Greek word used frequently by the
