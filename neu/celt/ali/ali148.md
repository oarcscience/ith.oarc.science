For Hip Disease

> Take three green stones, gathered from a running brook, between
> midnight and morning, while no word is said. In silence it must be
> done. Then uncover the limb and rub each stone several times closely
> downwards from the hip to the toe, saying in Irish--

> "Wear away, wear away,  
> There you shall not stay,  
> Cruel pain--away, away."
