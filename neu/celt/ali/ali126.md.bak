A Very Ancient Charm Against Wounds or Poisons

> "The poison of a serpent, the venom of the dog, the sharpness of the
> spear, doth not well in man. The blood of one dog, the blood of many
> dogs, the blood of the hound of Fliethas--these I invoke. It is not a
> wart to which my spittle is applied. I strike disease; I strike
> wounds. I strike the disease of the dog that bites, of the thorn that
> wounds, of the iron that strikes. I invoke the three daughters of
> Fliethas against the serpent.

> Benediction on this body to be healed; benediction on the spittle;
> benediction on him who casts out the disease. In the name .of God.
> AMEN,"
