For Pains in the Body

> Rub the part affected with flax and tow, heated in the fire, repeating
> in Irish--

> "In the name of a rough man and a mild woman, and of the Lamb of God,
> be healed from your pains and your sins. So be it. AMEN."

> This custom refers to the tradition that one day the Lord Christ,
> being weary, asked leave to rest in a house, but was refused by the
> master of the house, a rough, rude man. Then the wife, being a mild
> woman, had pity on the wayfarer, and brought Him in to rest, and gave
> Him a cup of water to drink, and spake kindly to Him. After which the
> man was suddenly taken with severe pains, and seemed like to die in
> his agony.

> On this Christ called for some flax and tow, and, breathing on it,
> placed it on the part affected, by which means the man was quite
> healed. And then the Lord Christ went His way, but not before the man
> had humbly asked pardon for his rudeness to a stranger.

> The tradition of this cure has remained ever since, and a hot plaster
> of flax and tow is used by the peasantry invariably for all sudden
> pains, and found to be most efficacious as a cure.
