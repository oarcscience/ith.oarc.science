Legends of Animals

> THERE are no traces in Irish legend of animal worship, but many
> concerning the influence of animals upon human life, and of their
> interference with human affairs.

> The peasants believe that the domestic animals know all about us,
> especially the dog and the cat. They listen to everything that. is
> said; they watch the expression of the face, and can even read the
> thoughts. The Irish say it is not safe to ask a question of a dog, for
> he may answer, and should he do so the questioner will surely die.

> The position of the animal race in the life scheme is certainly full
> of mystery. Gifted with extraordinary intelligence, yet with dumb
> souls vainly struggling for utterance, they seem like prisoned spirits
> in bondage, suffering the punishment., perhaps, for sin in some former
> human life, and now waiting the completion of the cycle of expiation
> that will advance them again to the human state.

> The three most ancient words in the Irish language are, it is said,
> *Tor,* a tower; *Cu,* a hound, and *Bo,* a cow. The latter word is the
> same as is found in the Greek *Bosphorus,* and in the nomenclature of
> many places throughout Europe.
