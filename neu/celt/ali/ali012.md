The Fairy Race

> THE *Sidhe,* or spirit race, called also the *Feadh-Ree,* or fairies,
> are supposed to have been once angels in heaven, who were cast out by
> Divine command as a punishment for their inordinate pride.

> Some fell to earth, and dwelt there, long before man was created, as
> the first gods of the earth. Others fell into the sea, and they built
> themselves beautiful fairy palaces of crystal and pearl underneath the
> waves; but on moonlight nights they often come up on the land, riding
> their white horses, and they hold revels with their fairy kindred of
> the earth, who live in the clefts of the hills, and they dance
> together on the greensward under the ancient trees, and drink nectar
> from the cups of the flowers, which is the fairy wine.

> Other fairies, however, are demoniacal, and given to evil and
> malicious deeds; for when cast out of heaven they fell into hell, and
> there the devil holds them under his rule, and sends them forth as he
> wills upon missions of evil to tempt the souls of men downward by the
> false glitter of sin and pleasure. These spirits dwell under the earth
> and impart their knowledge only to certain evil persons chosen of the
> devil, who gives them power to make incantations, and brew love
> potions, and to work wicked spells, and they can assume different
> forms by their knowledge and use of certain magical herbs.

> The witch women who have been taught by them, and have thus become
> tools of the Evil One, are the terror of the neighbourhood; for they
> have all the power of the fairies and all the malice of the devil, who
> reveals to them secrets of times and days, and secrets of herbs, and
> secrets of evil spells; and by the power of magic they can effect all
> their purposes, whether for good or ill.

> The fairies of the earth are small and beautiful. They passionately
> love music and dancing, and live luxuriously in their palaces under
> the hills and in the deep mountain caves; and they can obtain all
> things lovely for their fairy homes, merely by the strength of their
> magic power. They can also assume all forms, and will never know death
> until the last day comes, when their doom is to vanish away--to be
> annihilated for ever. But they are very jealous of the human race who
> are so tall and strong, and to whom has been promised immortality. And
> they are often tempted by the beauty of a mortal woman and greatly
> desire to have her as a wife.

> The children of such marriages have a strange mystic nature, and
> generally become famous in music and song. But they are passionate,
> revengeful, and not easy to live with. Every one knows them to be of
> the Sidhe or spirit race, by their beautiful eyes and their bold,
> reckless temperament.

> The fairy king and princes dress in green, with red caps bound on the
> head with a golden fillet. The fairy queen and the great court lathes
> are robed in glittering silver gauze, spangled with diamonds, and
> their long golden hair sweeps the ground as they dance on the
> greensward.

> Their favourite camp and resting-place is under a hawthorn tree, and a
> peasant would die sooner than cut down one of the ancient hawthorns
> sacred to the fairies, and which generally stands in the centre of a
> fairy ring. But the people never offer worship to these fairy beings,
> for they look on the Sidhe as a race quite inferior to man. At the
> same the they have an immense dread and fear of the mystic fairy
> power, and never interfere with them nor offend them knowingly.

> The Sidhe often strive to carry off the handsome children, who are
> then reared in the beautiful fairy palaces under the earth, and wedded
> to fairy mates when they grow up.

> The people dread the idea of a fairy changeling being left in the
> cradle in place of their own lovely child; and if a wizened little
> thing is found there, it is sometimes taken out at night and laid in
> an open grave till morning, when they hope to find their own child
> restored, although more often nothing is found save the cold corpse of
> the poor outcast.

> Sometimes it is said the fairies carry off the mortal child for a
> sacrifice, as they have to offer one every seven years to the devil in
> return for the power he gives them. And beautiful young girls are
> carried off, also, either for sacrifice or to be wedded to the fairy
> king.

> The fairies are pure and cleanly in their habits, and they like above
> all things a pail of water to be set for them at night, in case they
> may wish to bathe.

> They also delight in good wines, and are careful to repay the donor in
> blessings, for they are truly upright and honest. The great lords of
> Ireland, in ancient times, used to leave a keg of the finest Spanish
> wine frequently at night out on the window-sill for the fairies, and
> in the morning it was all gone.

> Fire is a great preventative against fairy magic, for fire is the most
> sacred of all created things, and man alone has power over it. No
> animal has ever yet attained the knowledge of how to draw out the
> spirit of fire from the stone or the wood, where it has found a
> dwelling-place. If a ring of fire is made round cattle or a child's
> cradle, or if fire is placed under the churn, the fairies have no
> power to harm. And the spirit of the fire is certain to destroy all
> fairy magic, if it exist.
