Fairy Doctors

> The fairy doctors are generally females. Old women, especially, are
> considered to have peculiar mystic and supernatural power. They cure
> chiefly by charms and incantations, transmitted by tradition through
> many generations; and by herbs, of which they have a surprising
> knowledge.

> The fairies have an aversion to the sight of blood; and the peasants,
> therefore, have a great objection to being bled, lest "the good
> people" would be angry. Besides, they have much more faith in charms
> and incantations than in any dispensary doctor that ever practised
> amongst them.
