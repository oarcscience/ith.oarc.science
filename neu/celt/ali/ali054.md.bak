May-Day Superstitions

> THE marsh marigold is considered of great use in divination, and is
> called "the shrub of Beltaine." Garlands are made of it for the cattle
> and the door-posts to keep off the fairy power. Milk also is poured on
> the threshold, though none would be given away; nor fire, nor
> salt--these three things being sacred. There are many superstitions
> concerning May-the. It is not safe to go on the water the first Monday
> in May. Hares found on May morning are supposed to be witches, and
> should be stoned.

> If the fire goes out on May morning it is considered very unlucky, and
> it cannot be re-kindled except by a lighted sod brought from the
> priest's house. And the ashes of this blessed turf are afterwards
> sprinkled on the floor and the threshold of the house. Neither fire,
> nor water, nor milk, nor salt should he given away for love or money,
> and if a wayfarer is given a cup of milk, he must drink it in the
> house, and salt must he mixed with it. Salt and water as a drink is at
> all times considered a potent. Charm against evil, if properly
> prepared by a fairy doctor and the magic words said over it.

> One day in May a young girl lay down to rest at noontide on a fairy
> rath and fell asleep--a thing of great danger, for the fairies are
> strong in power during the May month, and are particularly on the
> watch for a mortal bride to carry away to the fairy mansions, for they
> love the sight of human beauty. So they spirited away the young
> sleeping girl, and only left a shadowy resemblance of her lying on the
> rath. Evening came on, and as the young girl had not returned, her
> mother sent out messengers in all directions to look for her. At last
> she was found on the fairy rath, lying quite unconscious, like one
> dead.

> They carried her home and laid her on her bed, but she neither spoke
> nor moved. So three days passed over. Then they thought it right to
> send for the fairy doctor. At once he said that she was fairy struck,
> and he gave them a salve made of herbs to anoint her hands and her
> brow every morning at sunrise, and every night when the moon rose; and
> salt was sprinkled on the threshold and round her bed where she lay
> sleeping. This was done for six days and six nights, and then the girl
> rose up suddenly and asked for food. They gave her to eat, but asked
> no questions, only watched her that she should not quit the house.
> Amid then she fixed her eyes on them steadily and said--

> "Why did you bring me back? I was so happy. I was in a beautiful
> palace where lovely ladies and young princes were dancing to the
> sweetest music; and they made me dance with them, and threw a mantle
> over me of rich gold: and now it is all gone, and you have brought me
> back, and I shall never, never see the beautiful palace more."

> Then the mother wept and said--

> "Oh, child, stay with me, for I have no other daughter, and if the
> fairies take you from me I shall die."

> When the girl heard this, she fell on her mother's neck and kissed
> her, and promised that she would never again go near the fairy rath
> while she lived, for the fairy doctor told her that if ever she lay
> down there again and slept, she would never return alive to her home
> any more.
