St. Ciaron

> This eminent saint died at the early age of thirty-three; and it is
> said that his death was caused by the prayers of the other saints of
> Ireland, who were jealous of his power and fame for sanctity. St.
> Ciaron knowing that death was coming upon him, composed a verse which
> ha-s been preserved as an appeal against the cruel fate that ended his
> life while he was yet in his prime. And the pathos of the quatrain is
> very tender and natural--

> "I ask is it right, O King of Stars,  
> To reap a cornfield before it is ripe?  
> It is eating fruit before the time,  
> It is plucking the blossom from a hazel when it is white."
