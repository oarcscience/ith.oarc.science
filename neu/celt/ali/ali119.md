For the Great Worm\*

> "I kill a hound. I kill a small hound. I kill a deceitful hound. I
> kill a worm, wherein there is terror; I kill all his wicked brood.
> Seven angels from Paradise will help me, that I may do valiantly, and
> give no more time to the worm to live than while I recite this prayer.
> AMEN."

>  

> \* The ancient serpent-idol was called in Irish, "The Great Worm." St.
> Patrick destroyed it, and had it thrown into the sea. There are no
> serpents now to be found in Ireland, not even grass snakes or
> scorpions.
