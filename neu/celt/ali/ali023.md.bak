The Bride's Death-Song

> ON a lone island by the West Coast there dwelt an old fisherman and
> his daughter, and the man had power over the water spirits, and he
> taught his daughter the charms that bind them to obey.

> One day a boat was driven on the shore, and in it was a young handsome
> gentleman, half dead from the cold and the wet. The old fisherman
> brought him home and revived him, and Eileen the daughter nursed and
> watched him. Naturally the two young people soon fell in love, and the
> gentleman told the girl he had a beautiful house on the mainland ready
> for her, with plenty of everything she could desire--silks to wear and
> gold to spend. So they were betrothed, and the wedding day was fixed.
> But Dermot, the lover, said he must first cross to the mainland and
> bring back his friends and relations to the wedding, as many as the
> boat would hold.

> Eileen wept and prayed him not to leave, or at least to take her to
> steer the boat, for she knew there was danger coming, and she alone
> could have power over the evil spirits and over the waves and the
> winds. But she dared not tell the secret of the spell to Dermot or it
> would fail, and the charm be useless for ever after.

> Dermot, however, only laughed at her fears, for the day was bright and
> clear, and he scorned all thought of danger. So he put off from the
> shore, and reached the mainland safely, and filled the boat with his
> friends to return to the island for the wedding. All went well till
> they were within sight of the island, when suddenly a fierce gust of
> wind drove the boat on a rock, and it was upset, and all who were in
> it perished.

> Eileen heard the cry of the drowning men as she stood watching on the
> beach, but could give no help. And she was sore grieved for her lover,
> and sang a funeral wail for him in Irish, which is still preserved by
> the people. Then she lay down and died, and the old man, her father,
> disappeared. And from that day no one has ever ventured to live on the
> island, for it is haunted by the spirit of Eileen. And the mournful
> music of her wail is still heard in the nights when the winds are
> strong and the waves beat upon the rocks where the drowned men lay
> dead.

> The words of the song are very plaintive and simple, and may be
> translated literally--

> "I a virgin and a widow mourn for my lover.  
> Never more will he kiss me on the lips;  
> The cold wave is his bridal bed,  
> The cold wave is his wedding shroud.  
> O love, my love, had you brought me in the boat  
> My spirit and my spells would have saved from harm.  
> For my power was strong over waves and wind,  
> And the spirits of evil would have feared me.  
> O love, my love, I go to meet you in heaven.  
> I will ask God to let me see your face.  
> If the fair angels give me back my lover,  
> I will not envy the Almighty on His throne."
