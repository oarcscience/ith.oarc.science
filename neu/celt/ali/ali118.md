How to have Money Always

> Kill a black cock, and go to the meeting of three cross-roads where a
> murderer is buried. Throw the dead bird over your left shoulder then
> and there, after nightfall, in the name of the devil, holding a piece
> of money in your hand all the while. And ever after, no matter what
> you spend, you will always find the same piece of money undiminished
> in your pocket.
