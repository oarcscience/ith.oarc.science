Charms by Crystals

> The charms by crystals are of great antiquity in Ireland--a mode of
> divination, no doubt, brought from the East by the early wandering
> tribes. Many of these stones have been found throughout the country,
> and are held in great veneration. They are generally globular, and
> appear to have been originally set in royal sceptres or sacred
> shrines. A very ancient crystal globe of this kind, with miraculous
> curative powers, is still to be seen at Currahmore, the seat of the
> Marquis of Waterford, and it is believed to have been brought from the
> Holy Land by one of the Le Poers, who had it as a gift from Godfrey de
> Bouillon. The ball is of rock crystal, a little larger than an orange,
> and is circled round the middle by a silver band. It is still
> constantly borrowed by the people to effect. cures upon cattle
> suffering from murrain or other distempers. This is done by placing
> the ball in a running stream, through which the cattle are driven
> backwards and forwards many times.

> The peasants affirm that the charm never fails in success, and the
> belief in its miraculous powers is so widespread that people from the
> most distant parts of Ireland send to Currahmore to borrow it. Even to
> this day the faith in its magic power continues unabated, and requests
> for the loan come from every quarter. The Marquis of Waterford leaves
> it in the care of his steward, and it is freely lent to all coiners;
> but to the credit of the people it may be noted, that the magic
> crystal is always brought back to Currahmore with the most scrupulous
> care.\*
