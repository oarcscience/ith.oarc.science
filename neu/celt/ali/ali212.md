Lough Neagh

> WONDERFUL tales are related about the formation of Lough Neagh; and
> the whole country round abounds with traditions. One of them affirms
> that the great Fionn Ma-Coul, being in a rage one day, took up a
> handful of earth and flung it into time sea; and the handful was of
> such a size that where it fell it formed the Isle of Man, and the
> hollow caused by its removal became the basin of the present Lough
> Neagh.

> Another legend is the a holy well once existed in the locality,
> blessed and sanctified by a saint with wonderful miraculous powers of
> healing; provided that every patient on leaving, after cure, carefully
> closed the wicket-gate that shut in the well. But once, however, a
> woman having forgotten this information, left the gate open, when
> instantly the indignant waters sprang from their bed and pursued the
> offender, who fled in terror before the advancing waves, until at last
> she sank down exhausted, when the waters closed over her, and she was
> no more seen. But along the track of her fight the waters remained,
> and formed the great lake now existing, which is exactly the length
> the woman traversed in her flight from the angry spirit of the lake.

> Mysterious influences still haunt the locality all round Lough Neagh;
> for it is the most. ancient dwelling-place of the fairies, and when
> they pass at night, from one island to another, soft music is heard
> floating by, and then the boatmen know that the

> fairies are out for a pleasure trip; and one man even averred that he
> saw them going by in the track of the moonbeam, a crowd of little men
> all dressed in green with red caps, and the ladies in silver gossamer.
> And he liked these pretty creatures, and always left a little *poteen*
> for them in the bottle when he was on the island. In return for which
> attention they gave him the best of good luck in fishing and in
> everything else; for never a gauger came next or nigh his place while
> the fairies protected him, and many a time they led the gauger into a
> bog, and otherwise discomfited him, when he and his men were after a
> still.

> So the fisherman loved his little friends, and they took great care of
> him; for even in the troublous times of '98, when the wreckers were
> all over the country, they did him no harm; though indeed the same
> wreckers knew where to find a good glass of something when they came
> his way, and he always gave it to them with a heart and a half; for
> didn't they tell him they were going to free Ireland from the
> Sassenach tyranny.

> Down deep, under the waters of Lough Neagh, can still be seen, by
> those who have the gift of fairy vision, the columns and walls of the
> beautiful palaces once inhabited by the fairy race when they were the
> gods of the earth; and this tradition of a buried town beneath the
> waves has been prevalent for centuries amongst the people.

> Giraldus Cambrensis states, that in his time the tops of towers,
> "built after the fashion of the country," were distinctly visible in
> calm, clear weather, under the surface of the lake; and still the
> fairies haunt the ruins of their former splendour, and hold festivals
> beneath the waters when the full moon is shining; for the boatmen,
> coming home late at night, have often heard sweet music rising up from
> beneath the waves and the sound of laughter, and seen glimmering
> lights far down under the water, where the ancient fairy palaces are
> supposed to be.
