Mysteries of Fairy Power

The Evil Stroke

> SOME persons are possessed naturally with the power of the Evil
> Stroke, but it is not considered at all so unlucky as the Evil Eye;
> for the person who has it does not act from intentional malice but
> from necessity, from a force within him which acts without his will,
> and often to his deep regret: as in hurling matches, where a chance
> stroke of his may do serious injury, and even the dust of the earth
> raised by his foot has blinded his opponent for a week.

> One day a young man, while wrestling with another in play at a fair,
> where they met by chance, struck him on the arm, which immediately
> became fixed and powerless as stone. His friends brought him home, but
> nothing would restore the power of the arm or bring back the life; so
> after he had lain in this state for three days his family sent for the
> young man who had struck him, to ask for his help. When, he came and
> saw the arm stiff as stone, he anointed it all over with spittle,
> making also the sign of the cross; and after some time the arm began
> to move again with life, and finally was quite restored. But the young
> man of the Evil Stroke was so dismayed at this proof of the strange
> power in him, that he would never again join in sports for fear of
> some unlucky accident.

> The power, however, is sometimes very useful, as in the case of attack
> from a bull or a ferocious dog; for a touch from the hand of a person
> possessing the Evil Stroke at once quells the madness in the animal,
> who will crouch down trembling with fear, and become as incapable of
> doing injury as if suddenly and powerfully mesmerized.

> But the power does not come by volition, only at intervals; and the
> person possessing it does not himself know the moment when it can be
> effectively exercised.

> Women, also, have the mysterious gift of this strange occult force,
> and one young girl was much dreaded in the country in consequence; for
> anything struck by her, beast or man, became instantly paralyzed, as
> if turned to stone. One day, at a hurling match, she threw a lump of
> clay at the winner in anger, because her own lover had failed to win
> the prize. Immediately the young victor fell down stunned and
> lifeless, and was so carried

> his mother. Then they sent in all haste for the young girl to restore
> him to consciousness; but she was so frightened at her own evil work
> that she went and hid herself. Finding it then impossible to bring
> her, his friends sent for the fairy doctor, who, by dint of many
> charms and much stroking, at last restored the young man to life. The
> girl, however, was in such dread of the curses of the mother, that she
> fled, and took service in a distant part of the country. And all the
> people rejoiced much over her departure from amongst them.

> Yet it was considered lucky in some ways to have a fairy-stricken
> child in the house, for the fairies generally did a good turn by the
> family to compensate for the evil. And so there was always plenty of
> butter in the churn, and the cattle did not sicken wherever there was
> a stricken child.

> \*

> It is also lucky to employ a half-simpleton about the farm, and to be
> kind to the deaf and dumb, and other afflicted creatures. No one in
> Ireland would harm them or turn them out of their way, and they always
> get. food and drink for the asking, without any payment being thought
> of or accepted.
