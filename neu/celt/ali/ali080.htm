<P ALIGN="CENTER">Legends of Animals</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THERE are no traces in Irish legend of animal worship, but many concerning the influence of animals upon human life, and of their interference with human affairs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The peasants believe that the domestic animals know all about us, especially the dog and the cat. They listen to everything that. is said; they watch the expression of the face, and can even read the thoughts. The Irish say it is not safe to ask a question of a dog, for he may answer, and should he do so the questioner will surely die.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The position of the animal race in the life scheme is certainly full of mystery. Gifted with extraordinary intelligence, yet with dumb souls vainly struggling for utterance, they seem like prisoned spirits in bondage, suffering the punishment., perhaps, for sin in some former human life, and now waiting the completion of the cycle of expiation that will advance them again to the human state.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three most ancient words in the Irish language are, it is said, <I>Tor, </I>a tower; <I>Cu, </I>a hound, and <I>Bo, </I>a cow. The latter word is the same as is found in the Greek <I>Bosphorus, </I>and in the nomenclature of many places throughout Europe.</BLOCKQUOTE>
