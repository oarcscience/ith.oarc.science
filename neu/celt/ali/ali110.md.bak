For the Night-Fire (the Fever)

> "God save thee, Michael, archangel! God save thee!

> "What aileth thee, O man?"

> "A headache and a sickness and a weakness of the heart. O Michael,
> archangel, canst thou cure me, O angel of the Lord?"

> "May three things cure thee, O man. May the shadow of Christ fall on
> thee! May the garment of Christ cover thee May the breath of Christ
> breathe on thee! And when I come again thou wilt be healed."

> These words are said over the patient while his arms are lifted in the
> form of a cross, and water is sprinkled on his head.
