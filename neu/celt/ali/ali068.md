The Poet and the King

> NUADHE, the celebrated poet, is remembered in history by a memorable
> exercise of his malific power, and the punishment that fell on him in
> consequence; for Heaven is just, and even a bard cannot escape the
> penalty due for sin.

> He was nephew to Caer, the king of Connaught, who reared him with all
> kindness and gentleness as his own son. But by an evil fate the wife
> of Caer the king loved the young man; and she gave him a silver apple
> in proof of her love, and further promised hum the kingdom and herself
> if he could overthrow Caer and make the people depose him from the
> sovranty.

> "How can I do this?" answered Nuadhé, "for the king has ever been kind
> to me."

> "Ask him for some gift," said the queen, "that he will refuse, and
> then put a blemish on him for punishment, that so he can be no longer
> king;"for no one with a blemish was ever suffered to reign in Erin.

> "But hue refuses me nothing," answered Nuadhé.

> " Try him," said the queen. "Ask of him the dagger he brought from
> Alba, for he is under a vow never to part with it."

> So Nuadhé went to him, and asked for the dagger that came out of Alba
> as a gift.

> "Woe is me!" said the king. "This I cannot grant; for I am under a
> solemn vow never to part with it, or give it to another."

> Then the poet by his power made a satire on him, and this was the form
> of the imprecation--

> ''Evil death, and a short life  
> Be on Caer the king!  
> Let the spears of battle wound him,  
> Under earth, under ramparts, under stones,  
> Let the malediction be on him!"

> And when Caer rose up in the morning he put his hand to his face and
> found it was disfigured with three blisters, a white, a red, and a
> green. And when he saw the blemish he fled away filled with fear that
> any man should see him, and took refuge in a fort with one of his
> faithful servants, and no one knew where he lay hid.

> So Nuadhé took the kingdom and held it for a year, and had the queen
> to wife. But then grievous to him was the fate of Caer, and he set
> forth to seach for him.

> And he was seated in the king's own royal chariot, with the king's
> wife beside him, and the king's greyhound at his feet, and all the
> people wondered at. the beauty of the charioteer.

> Now Caer was in the fort where he had found shelter, and when he saw
> them coming he said--

> "Who is this that is seated in my chariot in the place of the
> champion, and driving my steeds?"

> But when he saw that it was Nuadhé he fled away and hid himself for
> shame.

> Then Nuadhé drove into the fort in the king's chariot, and loosed the
> dogs to pursue Caer. And they found him hid under the flagstone behind
> the rock even where the dogs tracked him. And Caer fell down dead from
> shame on beholding Nuadhé, and the rock where he fell flamed up amid
> simivered into fragments, and a splinter leaped up high as a man, and
> struck Nuadhé on the eyes, and blinded him for life. Such was the
> punishment decreed, and just and right was the vengeance of God upon
> the sin of the poet.
