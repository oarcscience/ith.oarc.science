An Irish Adept of the Islands

> SOME persons, even at the present day amongst the peasants, have
> strange gifts and a knowledge of the hidden mysteries, but they can
> only impart this knowledge when they know that death is on them, and
> then it must be to a female, to an unmarried man, or to a childless
> woman, for these are the most susceptible to the mysterious power by
> which miracles can be worked.

>  

> A man now living at Innis-Sark has this strange and mystic gift. he
> can heal diseases by a word, even at a distance, and his glance sees
> into the very heart, and reads the secret thoughts of men. He never
> touched beer, spirits, or meat, in all his life, but has lived
> entirely on bread, fruit, and vegetables. A man who knew him thus
> describes him--" Winter and summer his dress is the same, merely a
> flannel shirt and coat. he will pay his share at a feast, but neither
> eats nor drinks of the food and drink set before him. He speaks no
> English, and never could be made to learn the English tongue, though
> he says it might be used with great effect to curse one's enemy. He
> holds a burial-ground sacred, and would not carry away so much as a
> leaf of ivy from a grave. And he maintains that the people are right
> in keeping to their ancient usages, such as never to dig a grave on a
> Monday; and to carry the coffin three times round the grave, following
> the course of the sun, for then the dead rest in peace. Like the
> people, also, he holds suicides as accursed; for they believe that all
> the dead who have been recently buried turn over on their faces if a
> suicide is laid amongst them.

>  

> "Though well off he never, even in his youth, thought of taking a
> wife, nor was he ever known to love a woman. He stands quite apart
> from life, and by this means holds his power over the mysteries. No
> money will tempt him to impart this knowledge to another, for if he
> did he would be struck dead--so he believes. He would not touch a
> hazel stick, but carries an ash wand, which he holds in his hand when
> he prays, laid across his knees, and the whole of his life is devoted
> to works of grace and charity."

>  

> Though now an old man he has never had a day's sickness. No one has
> ever seen him in a rage, nor heard an angry word from his lips but
> once; and then being under great irritation, he recited the Lord's
> Prayer backwards, as an imprecation on his enemy. Before his death he
> will reveal the mystery of his power, but not till the hand of death
> is on him for certain.
