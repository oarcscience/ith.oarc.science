Various Superstitions and Cures

> THERE is a book, a little book, and the house which has it will never
> be burned; the ship that holds it will never founder; the woman who
> keeps it in her hand will be safe in childbirth. But none except a
> fairy man knows the name of the book, and he will not reveal it for
> love or money; only on his death-bed will he tell the secret of the
> name to the one person he selects.

> The adepts and fairy doctors keep their mysteries very secret, and it
> is not easy to discover the word of a charm, for the operator loses
> his power if the words are said without the proper preliminaries, or
> if said by a profane person without faith, for the operator should not
> have uttered the mystery in the hearing of one who would mock, or
> treat the matter lightly; therefore he is punished.

> Some years ago an old man lived in Mayo who had great knowledge of
> charms, and of certain love philtres that no woman could resist. But
> before his death he enclosed the written charms in a strong iron box,
> with directions that no one was to dare to open it except the eldest
> son of an eldest son in a direct line from himself.

> Some people pretend that they have read the charms; and one of them
> has the strange power to make every one in the house begin to dance,
> and they can never cease dancing till another spell has been said over
> them.

> But the guardian of the iron box is the only one who knows the magic
> secret of the spell, and he exacts a good price before he utters it,
> and so reveals or destroys the witchcraft of the dance.

> The juice of deadly night-shade distilled, and given in a drink, will
> make the person who drinks believe whatever you will to tell him, and
> choose him to-believe.

> power to cure dropsy.

> The touch from the hand of a seventh son cures the bite of a mad dog.
> This is also an Italian superstition.

> The hand of a dead man was a powerful incantation, But it was chiefly
> used by women. The most eminent fairy women always collected the
> mystic herbs for charms and cures by the light of a candle held by a
> dead man's hand at midnight or by the full moon.

> When a woman first takes ill in her confinement, unlock instantly
> every press and drawer in the house, but when the child is born, lock
> them all up again at once, for if care is not taken the fairies will
> get in and hide in the drawers and presses, to be ready to steal away
> the little mortal baby when they get the opportunity, and place some
> ugly, wizened changeling in the cradle beside the poor mother.
> Therefore every key should be turned, every lock made fast.; and if
> the fairies are hidden inside, let them stay there until all danger is
> over for the baby by the proper precautions being taken, such as a red
> coal set. under the cradle, and a branch of mountain ash tied over it,
> or of the alder-tree, according to the sex of the child, for both
> trees have mystic virtues, probably because of the ancient
> superstition that the first man was created from an alder-tree, and
> the first woman from the mountain ash.

> The fairies, however, are sometimes successful in carrying off a baby,
> and the mother finds in the morning a poor weakly little sprite in the
> cradle in place of her own splendid child. But should time mortal
> infant happen to grow up ugly, the fairies send it back, for they love
> beauty above all timings; and the fairy chiefs greatly desire a
> handsome mortal wife, so that a handsome girl must be well guarded, or
> they will carry her off. The children of such unions grow up beautiful
> and clever, but are also wild, reckless and extravagant. They are
> known at once by the beauty of their eyes and hair, and they have a
> magic fascination that no one can resist, and also a fairy gift of
> music and song.

> only are they cured of their ailment, but are as free from sin as time
> angels in heaven.
