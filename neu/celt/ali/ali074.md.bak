Death Signs

> In one Irish family a cuckoo always appears before a death. A. lady
> who arrived on a visit at a house observed one morning a cuckoo
> perched. on the window-sill, but she felt. no alarm, for there was no
> sickness in the family. Next day, however, one of the sons was carried
> home dead. He had been thrown from his horse when hunting, and killed
> on the spot.

> In another family a mysterious sound is heard like the crashing of
> boards, and a rush of wind seems to pass through the. house., yet
> nothing is broken or disturbed. The death of an officer in the Crimea
> was in this way announced to his family, for the news came immediately
> after the warning sound, and then they knew that the rush of the wind
> was the spirit of the dead which had passed by them, but wit-bout
> taking any visible form.
