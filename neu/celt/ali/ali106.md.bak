To Cause Love

> Ten leaves of the hemlock dried and powdered and mixed in food or
> drink will make the person you like to love you in return.

> Also keep a sprig of mint in your hand till the herb grows moist and
> warm, then take hold of the hand of the woman you love, and she will
> follow you as long as the two hands close over the herb. No invocation
> is necessary; but silence must be kept between this two parties for
> ten minutes, to give the charm time to work with due efficacy.
