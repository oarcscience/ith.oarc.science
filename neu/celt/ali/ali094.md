Concerning Birds

> IN all countries superstitions of good or evil are attached to certain
> birds. The raven, for instance, has a wide-world reputation as the
> harbinger of evil and ill-luck. The wild geese portend a severe
> winter; the robin is held sacred, for no one would think of harming a
> bird who bears on his breast the blessed mark of the blood of Christ;
> while the wren is hunted to death with intense and cruel hate on St.
> Stephen's Day.
