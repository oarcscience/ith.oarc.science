For A Sprain

> In the Western Isles the following charm is used for a sprain--

> A strand of black wool is wound round and round the ankle, while the
> operator recites in a low voice--

> "The Lord rade and the foal slade,  
> He lighted and He righted;  
> Set joint to joint and bone to bone,  
> And sinew unto sinew.  
> In the name of God and the Saints,  
> Of Mary and her Son,  
> Let this man be healed. AMEN."

> A. similar charm was used in Germany in the tenth century, according
> to Jacob Grimm.
