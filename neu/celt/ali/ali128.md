For a Wound

> Close the wound tightly with the two fingers, and repeat these words
> slowly--

> "In the name of the Father, Son, and holy Mary. The wound was red, the
> cut was deep, and the flesh was sore; but there will be no more blood,
> and no more pain, till the blessed Virgin Mary bears a child again."
