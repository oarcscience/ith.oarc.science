A Holy Well

> ON the north side of Lough Neagh there is still a holy well of great
> power and sanctity. Three ancient white-thorn trees overshadow it, and
> about a mile distant is the fragmentary ruin of a wooden cross,
> erected in the olden time to mark the limit of the sacred ground.

> It was the custom up to a recent. date for the pilgrims to go round
> this well thirteen times barefoot on the 27th of June, drink of the
> water, wash in it, and then, holding themselves freed from all past
> sin, return to the old worldly life, and begin again after the usual
> fashion the old routine of business or pleasure, or reckless folly,
> conscious that they could come once more the following year and clear
> off all the accumulated stains of an ill life by a lavation in the
> holy well.

> A number of yellow crystals are found near, which the people say grow
> in the rocks in one night upon Midsummer Eve. And these crystals have
> power to avert all evil and bring luck and blessing to a house and
> family, and certain words are said while gathering them, known only to
> the adepts. The crystals are, however, very plentiful, and are found
> scattered for a space of two miles round the well, and in the crannies
> of the rocks. When burned in a crucible they become pure lime in one
> hour, and the powder ferments with spirits of vitriol; yet the waters
> of the well when analyzed present no appearance of lime.

> At one time an effort was made to change the name of Lough Neagh to
> Lough Chichester, in honour of the Lord Deputy, Sir Arthur Chichester,
> but the Irish would not accept the new baptism, and the old name still
> remains unchanged.
