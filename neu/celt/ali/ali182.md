St. Martin

> ST.. MARTIN was a bad man before his conversion, and, above all, was
> exceedingly close-fisted, as they say, to the poor; giving nothing and
> grasping all. So he was very rich but hated by every one.

> One day, when going out, he charged the servant to have a fine batch
> of loaves ready made and baked by the time he returned. While she was
> kneading the dough in came a poor man and begged for some as he was
> hungry; but she told him she dare not give away anything or the master
> would beat her. Still the poor man begged the harder, and at last she
> gave him dough enough for a couple of loaves. However, when the girl's
> back was turned, he threw the dough into the oven and went his way
> without a word.

> Now when the dough was ready, the girl opened the oven to put in the
> loaves, but, behold, it was already quite full of baked bread, and
> would hold no more. So when Martin came home she told him all the
> truth; and his heart smote him, and he cried out, "An Angel of the
> Lord has been here; God has sent his messenger to rebuke me of my
> sins!" And he ran out to search for the man along the road, and at
> last saw him a great way off. Then Martin flung off his coat that he
> might run the faster; and when he came up to the man he fell on his
> knees before him on the ground, and cried out," Oh, my Lord, I repent
> me of my sins; pray to God for me, for I know you are His angel." And
> from that moment Martin's heart was changed, and the devil left him;
> and he became a true saint, and servant of God, and, above all, the
> saint and patron of the poor.

> Nevertheless, St. Bridget was offended with St. Martin, because she
> thought he did not receive her with sufficient hospitality and
> consideration. Perhaps some of the old stinginess of nature still
> clung to him. And she thus pronounced her malediction over him--

> "Oh, little man, the sea-wave shall come up over thy house, and thy
> name shall lie in ashes, while my name and fame shall be glorious all
> over the world."

> And this was fulfilled; for time sea actually broke in and covered the
> saint's dwelling; and the house of St. Martin can still be seen low
> down beneath the waves, but. if any one tries to reach it. the house
> fades away into the mist and is seen no more.

> There is an old superstition still observed by time people, that blood
> must be spilt on St. Martin's Day; so a goose is killed, or a black
> cock, and the blood is sprinkled over the floor and on the threshold.
> And some of the flesh is given to the first beggar that comes by, in
> the name and in honour of St. Martin.

> In the Arran Isles St. Martin's Day is observed with particular
> solemnity, and it was held necessary, from ancient times, to spill
> blood on the ground in honour of the saint. For this purpose a cock
> was sacrificed; but if such could not be procured people have been
> known to cut their finger in order to draw blood, and let it fall upon
> the earth. The custom arose in this way:--St. Martin, having given
> away all his goods to the poor, was often in want of food, and one day
> he entered a widow's house and begged for something to eat. The widow
> was poor, and having no food in the house, she sacrificed her young
> child, boiled it, and set it before the saint for supper. Having
> eaten, and taken his departure, the woman went over to the cradle to
> weep for her lost child; when lo! there he was, lying whole and well,
> in a beautiful sleep, as if no evil had ever happened to him; and to
> commemorate this miracle and from gratitude to the saint, a sacrifice
> of some living thing is made yearly in his honour. The blood is poured
> or sprinkled on the ground, and along the door-posts, and both within
> and without the threshold, and at the four corners of each room in the
> house.

> For this symbol of purification by blood the rich farmers sacrifice a
> sheep; while time poorer people kill a black cock or a white hen, and
> sprinkle the blood according to ancient usage. Afterwards the whole
> family dine upon the sacrificial victim.

> In some places it was the custom for the master of the house to draw
> across on the arm of each member of the family and mark it out us
> blood. This was a very sacred sign which no fairy or evil spirit, were
> they ever so strong, could overcome; and whoever was signed with the
> blood was safe.

> There is a singular superstition forbidding work of a certain kind to
> be done on St. Martin's Day, time 11th of November. No woman should
> spin on that day; no miller should grind his corn, and no wheel should
> be turned. And this custom was long held sacred, and is still observed
> in the Western Islands.
