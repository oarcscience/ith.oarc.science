Sliabh-Mish, County Kerry

> EVERY one knows that Sliabh-Mish, County Kerry, is haunted. The figure
> of a man, accompanied by a huge black dog*,* is frequently seen
> standing on a high crag, but as the traveller approaches, the forms
> disappear, although they rise up again before him on another crag, and
> so continue appearing and appearing as he journeys on. Many travellers
> have seen them but no one has ever yet been able to meet the man and
> the dog face to face on the mountain side, for they seem to melt away
> in the mist, and are seen no more on reaching the spot. It happened,
> once upon a time, that a man journeying alone over the mountain path,
> took out his snuff-box to solace himself with a pinch, and was putting
> it up again in his waistcoat pocket, when he heard a voice near him
> saying, "Not yet! not yet! I am near you, wait."

> He looked round, but not a soul was to be seen. however, he thought it
> right to be friendly, so he shook some snuff from the box in the palm
> of his hand and held it out in the air. But his hair stood on end, and
> he trembled with fright, when he felt invisible fingers on his hand
> picking up the snuff, and when he drew it back the snuff had
> disappeared.

> "God and the saints between us and harm!" exclaimed the poor man,
> ready to drop down from terror.

> "Amen," responded the clear voice of some invisible speaker close
> beside him.

> Then the man quickly made the sign of the cross over the hand touched
> by the spirit, and so went on his way unharmed.
