Fairy Justice

A Legend of Shak Island.

> THE "Red-haired Man," although he is considered very unlucky in actual
> life, yet generally acts in the fairy world as the benevolent *Deus ex
> machina,* that saves and helps and rescues the unhappy mortal, who
> himself is quite helpless under the fairy spells.

> There was a man in Shark Island who used to cross over to Boffin \[a\]
> to buy tobacco, but when the weather was too rough for the boat his
> ill-temper was as bad as the weather, and he used to beat his wife,
> and fling all the things about, so that no one could stand before him.
> One day a man came to him.

> "What will you give me if I go over to Boffin," said he, "and bring
> you the tobacco?"

> "I will give you nothing," said the other. "Whatever way you go I can
> go also."

> "Then come with me to the shore," said the first man, "and I'll show
> you how to get across; but as only one can go, you must go alone."

> And as they went down to the sea, they saw a great company of horsemen
> and ladies galloping along, with music and laughter.

> "Spring up now on a horse and you will get across," said the first
> man.

> So the other sprang up as he was told, and in an instant they all
> jumped right across the sea and landed at Boffin. Then he ran to buy
> the tobacco and was back again in a minute, and found all the same
> company by the sea-shore. He sprang again upon a horse and they all
> jumped right into the sea, but suddenly stopped midway between the two
> islands, where there was a great rock, and beyond this they could not
> force the horses to move. Then there was great disquietude amongst
> them, and they called a council.

> "There is a mortal amongst us," they said. "Let us drown him." And
> they carried the man up to the top of the rock and cast him down; and
> when he rose to the surface again they caught him by the hair, and
> cried--

> "Drown him! Drown him! We have the power over life and death; he must
> be drowned."

> And they were going to cast him down a second time, when a red-haired
> man pleaded for him, and carried him off with a strong hand safe to
> shore.

> "Now," said he, "you are safe, but mind, the spirits are watching you,
> and if ever again you beat your poor good wife, and knock about the
> things at home just to torment her out of her life, you will die upon
> that rock as sure as fate." And He vanished.

> So from that time forth the man was as meek as a mouse, for he was
> afraid; and whenever he went by the rock in his boat he always stopped
> a minute, and said a little prayer for his wife with a "God bless
> her." And this kept away the evil, and they both lived together
> happily ever after to a great old age.

> This is but a rude tale. Yet the moral is good, and the threat of
> retributive justice shows a laudable spirit of indignation on the part
> of the fairy race against the tyranny of man over the weaker vessel.

>  

> \[a\] The correct names for these islands are Innis-Erk (the Island of
> St. Erk), and Innis-bo-finn (the Island of the White Cow).
