Irish Nature

> THE Irish show their Aryan descent by the same characteristics as the
> Fairy race, for they also love everything that is artistic--the
> fascinations of life, beauty of form, music, poetry, song, splendour,
> and noble pleasures. Their kings in ancient times were elected for
> their personal beauty as much as for their chivalrous qualities. No
> man with a blemish or a deformity was allowed to reign. Then, their
> appreciation of intellect proved the value they set on the spiritual
> and ideal above the material and the brutal. The poet ranked next to
> the princes of the land. his person was sacred in battle; he was
> endowed with an estate, so that his soul might be free from sordid
> cares; and his robe of many colours, and the golden circlet on his
> brow at the festivals, showed his claim and right to rank next to
> royalty, and to sit at the right hand of the king. poetry, learning,
> music, oratory, heroism, and splendour of achievement--these were the
> true objects of homage and admiration amongst the ancient Irish.

> There was nothing brutal in their ideal of life; no hideous images or
> revolting cruelties; and the beautiful and graceful Sidhe race, with
> their plaintive music and soft melancholy, and aspirations for a lost
> heaven, is the expression in a graceful and beautiful symbol of the
> instinctive tendencies of the Irish nature to all that is most divine
> in human intellect, and soft and tender in human emotion.

> Ireland is a land of mists and mystic shadows; of cloud-wraiths on the
> purple mountains; of weird silences in the lonely hills, and fitful
> skies of deepest gloom alternating with gorgeous sunset splendours.
> All this fantastic caprice of an ever-varying atmosphere stirs the
> imagination, and makes the Irish people strangely sensitive to
> spiritual influences. They see visions and dream dreams, and are
> haunted at all times by an ever-present sense of the supernatural. One
> can see by the form of the Irish head--a slender oval, prominent at
> the brows and high in the region of veneration, so different from the
> globular Teutonic head--that the people are enthusiasts, religious,
> fanatical; with the instincts of poetry, music, oratory, and
> superstition far stronger in them than the logical and reasoning
> faculties. They are made for worshippers, poets, artists, musicians,
> orators; to move the world by passion, not by logic. Scepticism will
> never take root in Ireland; infidelity is impossible to the people. To
> believe fanatically, trust implicitly, hope infinitely, and perhaps to
> revenge implacably--these are the unchanging and ineradicable
> characteristics of Irish nature, of Celtic nature, we may say; for it
> has been the same throughout all history and all ages. And it is these
> passionate qualities that make the Celt the great motive force of the
> world, ever striving against limitations towards some vision of ideal
> splendour; the restless centrifugal force of life, as opposed to the
> centipetal, which is ever seeking a calm quiescent rest within its
> appointed sphere.

> The very tendency to superstition, so marked in Irish nature, arises
> from an instinctive dislike to the narrow limitations of common sense.
> It is characterized by a passionate yearning towards the vague, the
> mystic, the invisible, and the boundless infinite of the realms of
> imagination. Therefore the *Daine-Sidhe,* the people of the fairy
> mansions, have an irresistible attraction for the Irish heart. Like
> them, the Irish love youth, beauty, splendour, lavish generosity,
> music and song, the feast and the dance. The mirth and the reckless
> gaiety of the national temperament finds its true exponent in the mad
> pranks of the *Phouka* and the *Leprehaun,* the merry spirits that
> haunt the dells and glens, and look out at the wayfarer from under the
> dock-leaf with their glittering eyes. The inspiration that rises to
> poetry under the influence of excitement is expressed by the belief in
> the *Leanan-Sidhe,* who gives power to song; while the deep pathos of
> Irish nature finds its fullest representation in the tender,
> plaintive, spiritual music of the wail and lamentation of the
>
> Ban-Sidhe.
