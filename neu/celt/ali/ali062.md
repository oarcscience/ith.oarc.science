The Fairy Doctress

> But all this the time fairies were not idle; for it was at this very
> season of dances and festivals, when the mortals around them were
> happiest, that Finvarra the king and his chosen band were on the watch
> to carry off the prettiest girls to the fairy mansions.

> There they kept them for seven years, and at the end of time the, when
> they grew old and ugly, they were sent back, for the fairies love
> nothing so much as youth and beauty. But as a compensation for the
> slight put on them, the women were taught all the fairy secrets and
> the magical mystery that lies in herbs, and the strange power they
> have over diseases. So by this means the women became all-powerful,
> and by their charms or spells or potions could kill or save as they
> chose.

> There was a woman of the islands greatly feared, yet respected by the
> people for her knowledge of herbs, which gave her power over all
> diseases. But she never revealed the nature of the herb, and always
> gathered the leaves herself at night and hid them under the eaves of
> the house. And if the person who carried the herb home let it fall to
> the ground by the way, it lost its power; or if they talked of it or
> showed it to any one, all the virtue went out of it. It was to be used
> secretly and alone, and then the cure would be perfected without fail.

> One time, a man who was told of this came over from the mainland in a
> boat with two other men to see the fairy woman; for he was lame from a
> fall and could do no work.

> Now the woman knew they were coming, for she had a knowledge of all
> things through the power of divination she had learned from the
> fairies, and could see and hear though no man told her. So she went
> out and prepared the herb, and made a salve and brewed a potion, and
> had all ready for the man and his friends.

> When they appeared she stood at the door and cried, "Enter! This is
> the lucky day and hour; have no fear, for you will be cured by the
> power that is in me, and by the herb I give you."

> Then the man bowed down before her, and said, "Oh, mother, this is my
> case." And he told her, that being out one day on the mountains, he
> slipped and fell on his face. A mere slight fall, but when he rose up
> his leg was powerless though no bone seemed broken.

> "I know how it happened," she said. "You trod upon a fairy herb under
> which the fairies were resting, amid you disturbed them and broke in
> the top of their dwelling, so they were angry and struck you on the
> leg amid lamed you out of spite. But my power is greater than theirs.
> Do as I tell you and you will soon be cured."

> So she gave him the salve and the bottle of potion, and bade him take
> it home carefully and use it in silence and alone, and in three days
> the power of the limb would come back to him.

> Then the man offered her silver; but she refused.

> "I do not sell my knowledge," she said, "I give it. And so the
> strength and the power remain with me."

> On this the men went their way. But after three days a message came
> from the man to say that he was cured. And he sent the wise woman a
> handsome present also; for a gift works no evil, though to sell the
> sacred power and mysteries of knowledge for money would be fatal; for
> then the spirit of healing that dwelt in the woman would have fled
> away and returned no more.
