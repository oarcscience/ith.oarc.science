Concerning Living Creatures

The Cricket

> THE crickets are believed to be enchanted. People do not like to
> express an exact opinion about them, so they are spoken of with great
> mystery and awe, and no one would venture to kill them for the whole
> world. But they are by no means evil; on the contrary, the presence of
> the cricket is considered lucky, and their singing keeps away the
> fairies at night, who are always anxious, in their selfish way, to
> have the whole hearth left clear for themselves, that they may sit
> round the last embers of the fire, and drink the cup of milk left for
> them by the farmer's wife, in peace and quietness. The crickets are
> supposed to be hundreds of years old, and their talk, could we
> understand it, would no doubt be most interesting and instructive.
