<BLOCKQUOTE>"The poison of a serpent, the venom of the dog, the sharpness of the spear, doth not well in man. The blood of one dog, the blood of many dogs, the blood of the hound of Fliethas--these I invoke. It is not a wart to which my spittle is applied. I strike disease; I strike wounds. I strike the disease of the dog that bites, of the thorn that wounds, of the iron that strikes. I invoke the three daughters of Fliethas against the serpent. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Benediction on this body to be healed; benediction on the spittle; benediction on him who casts out the disease. In the name .of God. AMEN,"</BLOCKQUOTE>
