St Patrick and the Serpent

> There is a lake in one of the Galtee mountains where there is a great
> serpent. chained to a rock, and he may be heard constantly crying out,
> "O Patrick, is the *Luan,* or Monday, long from us?" For when St..
> Patrick cast this serpent into the lake he bade him be chained to the
> rock till *La-an-Luan* (The Day of Judgment). But the serpent mistook
> the word, and thought the saint meant *Luan,* Monday.

> So he still expects to be freed from one Monday to another, and the
> clanking of his chains on that day is awful to hear as he strives to
> break them and get free.

> In another lake there is a huge-winged creature, it is said, which
> escaped the power of St. Patrick, and when he gambols in the water
> such storms arise that no boat can withstand the tumult of the waves.
