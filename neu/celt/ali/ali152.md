For the Fairy Dart

>  Fairy darts are generally aimed at the fingers, causing the joints to
> swell and grow red and inflamed. An eminent fairy-woman made the cure
> of fairy darts her specialty, and she was sent for by all the country
> round, and was generally successful. But she had no power unless
> *asked* to make the cure, and she took no reward at the time; not till
> the patient was cured, and the dart extracted. The treatment included
> a great many prayers and much anointing with a salve, of which she
> only had the secret. Then she proceeded to extract the dart. with
> great solemnity, working with a small instrument, on the point of
> which she finally produced the dart. This proved to be a bit of flax
> artfully laid under the skin by the malicious fairies, causing all the
> evil, and of course on seeing the flax no one could doubt the power of
> the operator, and the grateful patient paid his fee,
