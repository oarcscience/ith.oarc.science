Legend of Neal-Mor

> THERE is a great hole or well near the river Suir, always filled with
> water, whose depth no man has yet fathomed. Near it is a castle, which
> in old times belonged to a powerful chief called *.Neal-rnor.* One day
> while his servants were saving the hay, a violent tempest of wind and
> rain came on, which quite destroyed the crop. Then Neal-mor was filled
> with rage, and he mounted his horse and drew his sword, and rode forth
> to the field; and there he challenged the Lord God Himself to battle.
> And he swung his sword round his head and struck at the air, as if he
> would kill and slay the Great Invisible Spirit. On which suddenly a
> strange thing happened, for a great whirlwind arose and the earth
> opened, and Neal-mor, still astride on his horse and with his sword in
> his hand, was lifted high up into the air and then cast down alive
> into the great hole, called *Poul-mor,* which may be seen to this day,
> and the castle is still standing by the margin. But no trace of
> Neal-mor or his steed was ever again beheld. They perished utterly by
> the vengeance of God.

> But some time after his disappearance, a rude stone figure seated on a
> horse, was cast up out of the earth; and then all men knew the fate of
> the terrible chief who had braved the wrath of God, for here was his
> image and the sign of his destruction. The Stone figure is still
> preserved at the castle,. and tradition Says that if it were removed,
> the whole castle would crumble to pieces in a single night and be cast
> into the
>
> Poul-mor.
