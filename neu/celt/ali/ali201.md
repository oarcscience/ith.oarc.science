The Grilled Trout

> IN Sligo there is a well called *Tober-na-alt,* beautifully shadowed
> by trees, the branches of which are thickly hung with all sorts of
> votive offerings from those who have been cured by the water; and
> miracle-men attended, who professed to heal diseases by charms,
> prayers, and incantations.

> A man who had been born blind once recited his experiences there. "Oh,
> Christians, look on me! I was blind from my birth and saw no light
> till I came to the blessed well; now I see the water and the speckled
> trout down at the bottom, with the white cross on his back. Glory be
> to God for the cure." And when the people heard that he could really
> see the speckled trout, of course they all believed in the miracle.
> For a tradition exists that a sacred trout has lived there from time
> immemorial, placed in the well by the saint who first. sanctified the
> water. Now there was an adventurous man who desired much to get
> possession of this trout, and he watched it till at last he caught it
> asleep. Then he carried it off and put it on this gridiron. The trout
> bore the grilling of one side very patiently; but when the man tried
> to turn it on the fire, the trout suddenly jumped up and made off as
> hard as it could back to the well, where it still lives, and can be
> seen at times by those who have done proper penance and paid their
> dues to the priest, with one side all streaked and marked brown by the
> bars of the gridiron, which can never be effaced.
