The Fatal Love-Charm

> A POTENT love-charm used by women is a piece of skin taken from the
> arm of a corpse and tied on the person while sleeping whose love is
> sought. The skin is then removed after some time, and carefully put
> away before the sleeper awakes or has any consciousness of the
> transaction. And as long as it remains in the woman s possession the
> love of her lover will be unchanged. Or the strip of skin is placed
> under the head to dream on, in the name of the Evil One, when the
> future husband will appear in the dream.

> A young girl who was servant in the large and handsome house of a rich
> family tried this charm for fun, thinking she would dream of one of
> her fellow-servants, and next morning her mistress asked the result.

> "Throth, ma'am," she answered, "there never was such a foolish trick,
> for it was of the master himself I was dreaming all night, and of no
> one else."

> Soon after the lady died, and the girl, remembering her dream, watched
> her opportunity to tie a piece of skin taken from a corpse recently
> buried round the arm of her master while he slept. After this he
> became violently in love with the girl, though she was exceedingly
> ugly, and within the year he married her, his love all the while
> remaining fervent and unchanged.

> But exactly one year and a day after her marriage her bedroom took
> fire by accident, and the strip of skin, which she had kept carefully
> hidden in her wardrobe, was burnt, along with all her grand
> wedding-clothes. Immediately the magic charm was broken, and the
> hatred of the gentleman for his low-born wife became as strong as the
> love he had once felt for her.

> In her rage and grief at finding nothing but coldness and insult, she
> confessed the whole story; and, in consequence, the horror she
> inspired amongst the people was so great that no one would serve her
> with food or drink, or sit near her, or hold any intercourse with her;
> and she died miserably and half mad before the second year was out--a
> warning and a terror to all who work spells in the name of the Evil
> One.
