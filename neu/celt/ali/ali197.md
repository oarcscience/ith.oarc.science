The Holy Wells

> THERE is no superstition stronger in Ireland than a belief in the
> curative power of the sacred wells that are scattered over the
> country; fountains of health and healing which some saint had blessed,
> or by which some saint had dwelt in the far-off ancient times. But
> well-worship is even older than Christianity. It is part of the early
> ritual of humanity, brought from the Eastern lands by the first Aryan
> tribes who migrated westward, passing along from the Mediterranean to
> time Atlantic shores.

> The Delphic oracle in its origin was nothing more than a holy well,
> shadowed by trees, on which were hung the votive offerings of the
> praying peasants, long before the rival kings brought to the sacred
> spot their votive tributes of silver and gold, and crowns of precious
> stones.

> In Ireland the beautiful, picturesque, and tree-shadowed wells of the
> country were held sacred by the Druid priests, as is evident from the
> many remarkable Druidical remains that have been found in their
> vicinity--ruins of temples and pillar-stones, and stones with strange
> carvings. Much also of the ancient Druidic ceremonial has been
> preserved by time people, such as the symbolic dances, the traditions
> of sun-worship, and other pagan rites, which were incorporated into
> the Christian ritual of well-worship by the early converts, and are
> still retained, though, through the lapse of ages, they have entirely
> lost their original significance, and are now only practised as
> ancient customs, for which the Irish have great reverence, as having
> come down to them from their forefathers. The ceremonial is the same
> at all these places of devout pilgrimage. The pilgrims go round the
> well a certain number of times, either three or nine, creeping on
> their hands and knees, but always from east to west, following the
> apparent motion of the sun, and reciting paters and ayes all the time.
> At the close of each round they build up a small pile of stones; for
> at the last day the angels will reckon these stones, and he who has
> said the most prayers will have the highest place in heaven, each
> saint keeping count for his own votaries. The patient then descends
> the broken steps to the well and, kneeling down, bathes his forehead
> and hands in the water, after which oblation the pain or disease he
> suffered from will be gradually removed, and depart. from him for
> evermore.

> At some wells there is often a rude stone monument of the ancient
> times, and the eyes of the pilgrim must be kept steadily fixed on it
> while reciting the prayers.

> Whenever a white-thorn or an ash-tree shadows the place, the well is
> held to be peculiarly sacred; and on leaving, having first drunk of
> the water, the patient ties a votive offering to time
> branches--generally a coloured handkerchief or a bright red strip cut
> from a garment; and these offerings are never removed. They remain for
> years fluttering in the wind and the rain, just as travellers have
> described the votive offerings on the sacred trees that shadow the
> holy wells of Persia. They are signs and tokens of gratitude to the
> patron saint, and are meant to show the devil that he has no longer
> power to harm the praying pilgrim, or torment him with pains and aches
> as heretofore. It is not supposed that the water of the well has any
> natural medicinal properties. The curative efficacy is wholly due to
> the observance of the ritual in honour of the saint, whose spirit and
> influence is still over the well, by which he lived, and of which he
> drank while living on the earth.
