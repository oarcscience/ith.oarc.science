<BLOCKQUOTE>THE three great sources of knowledge respecting the shrouded part of humanity are the language, the mythology, and the ancient monuments of a country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>From the language one learns the mental and social height to which a nation had reached at any given period in arts, habits, and civilization, with the relation of man to man, and to the material and visible world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The mythology of a people reveals their relation to a spiritual and invisible world; while the early monuments are solemn and eternal symbols of religious faith---rituals of stone in cromlech, pillar, shrine and tower, temples and tombs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The written word, or literature, comes last, the fullest and highest expression of the intellect and culture, and scientific progress of a nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Irish race were never much indebted to the written word. The learned class, the ollamhs, dwelt apart and kept their knowledge sacred. The people therefore lived entirely upon the traditions of their forefathers, blended with the new doctrines taught by Christianity; so that the popular belief became, in time, an amalgam of the pagan myths and the Christian legend, and these two elements remain indissolubly united to this day. The world, in fact, is a volume, a serial rather going<I> </I>on for six thousand years, but of which the Irish peasant has scarcely yet turned the first age.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The present work deals only with the mythology, or the fantastic creed of the Irish respecting the invisible world--strange and mystical superstitions, brought thousands of years ago from their Aryan home, but which still, even in the present time, affect all the modes of thinking and acting in the daily life of the people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Amongst the educated classes in all nations, the belief in the supernatural, acting directly on life and constantly interfering with the natural course of human action, is soon dissipated an gradually disappears, for the knowledge of natural laws solves many mysteries that were once inexplicable; yet much remains unsolved, even to the philosopher, of the mystic relation between the material and the spiritual world. Whilst to the masses--the uneducated--who know nothing of the fixed eternal laws of nature, every phenomenon seems to result from the direct action of some non-human power, invisible though ever present; able to confer all benefits, yet implacable if offended, and therefore to be propitiated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The superstition, then, of the Irish peasant is the instinctive belief in the existence of certain unseen agencies that influence all human life; and with the highly sensitive organization of their race, it is not wonderful that the people live habitually under the shadow and dread of invisible powers which, whether working for good or evil, are awful and mysterious to the uncultured mind that sees only the strange results produced by certain forces, but knows nothing of approximate causes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Many of the Irish legends, superstitions, and ancient charms now collected were obtained chiefly from oral communications made by the peasantry themselves, either in Irish or in the Irish-English which preserves so much of the expressive idiom of the antique tongue.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These narrations were taken down by competent persons skilled in both languages, and as far as possible in the very words of the narrator; so that much of the primitive simplicity pf the style has been retained, while the legends have a peculiar and special value as coming direct from the national heart.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a few years such a collection would be impossible, for the old race is rapidly passing away to other lands, and in the vast working-world of America, with all the new influences of light and progress, the young generation, though still loving the land of their fathers, will scarcely find leisure to dream over the fairy-haunted hills and lakes and raths of ancient Ireland.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I must disclaim, however, all desire to be considered a melancholy <I>Laudatrix temporis acti. </I>These studies of the Irish past are simply the expression of my<I> </I>love for the beautiful island that gave me my<I> </I>first inspiration, my quickest intellectual impulses, and the strongest and, best sympathies with genius and country possible to a woman's nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>
