Lough Foyle

> LOUGH FOYLE means the borrowed lake, for in old times there were two
> weird sisters dwelling beyond the Shannon, who were skilled in
> necromancy. And the elder sister said to the younger--"Give me the
> loan of your silver lake, for I have none; and I

> promise to restore it to you next Monday."

> So the younger, being good-natured, rolled up the lake in a sheet and
> despatched it over hills and dales to her sister. But when the time
> came for return, the elder sister, being deceitful and cunning, made
> answer to the messenger sent for it--

> "Truly, I said Monday, but I meant. the Day of Judgment. So I shall
> keep the lake till then."

> And the lake therefore remains in her Country to this day, while the
> great hollow whence it was taken can still be seen in Connaught, bare
> and barren, waiting for the waters that never will return.
