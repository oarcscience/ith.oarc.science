The Fairy Rath

> THE ancient rath, or fort, or liss, generally enclosed about half an
> acre, and had two or more ramparts, formed by the heads of the tribe
> for defence. But when the race of the chieftains died out, then the
> Sidhe crowded into the forts, and there held their councils and revels
> and dances; and if a man put his ear close to time ground at night he
> could hear the sweet fairy music rising up from under the earth.

> The rath ever after is sacred to the fairies, and no mortal is allowed
> to cut down a tree that grows on it, or to carry away a stone. But.
> dangerous above all would it be to build on a fairy rath. If a man
> attempted such a rash act, the fairies would put a blast on his eyes,
> or give him a crooked mouth for no human hand should dare to touch
> their ancient dancing grounds.

> It is not right, the people say, to sing or whistle at night that old
> air, "The pretty girl milking her cow; "for it is a fairy tune, and
> the fairies will not suffer a mortal to sing their music while they
> are dancing on the grass. But if a person sleeps on the rath the music
> will enter into his soul, and when he awakes he may sing the air he
> has heard in his dreams.

> In this way the bards learned their songs, and they were skilled
> musicians, and touched the harp with a master hand, so that time
> fairies often gathered round to listen, though invisible to mortal
> eyes.
