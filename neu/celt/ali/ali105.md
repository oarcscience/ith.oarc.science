Love Dreams

> The girl who wishes to see her future husband must go out and gather
> certain herbs in the light of the full moon of the new year, repeating
> this charm--

> "Moon, moon, tell unto me  
> When my true love I shall see?  
> What fine clothes am I to wear?  
> How many children shall I bear?  
> For if my love comes not to me  
> Dark and dismal my life will be."

> Then the girl, cutting three pieces of clay from the sod with a
> black-hafted knife, carries them home, ties them up in the left
> stocking with the right garter, places the parcel under her pillow,
> and dreams a true dream of the man she is to marry and of all her
> future fate.
