The Dance of the Dead

> It is especially dangerous to be out late on the last, night of
> November, for it is the closing scene of the revels--the last night
> when the dead have leave to dance on the hill with the fairies, and
> after that they must all go back to their graves and lie in the chill,
> cold earth, without music or wine till the next November comes round,
> when they all spring up again in their shrouds and rush out into the
> moonlight with mad laughter.

> One November night, a woman of Shark island, coming home late at the
> hour of the dead, grew tired and sat down to rest, when presently a
> young man came up and talked to her.

> "Wait a bit," he said, "and you will see the most beautiful dancing
> you ever looked on there by the side of the hill."

> And she looked at him steadily. He was very pale, and seemed sad.

> "Why are you so sad?" she asked, "and as pale as if you were dead?"

> "Look well at me," he answered. "Do you not know me?"

> "Yes, I know you now," she said. "You are young Brien that was drowned
> last year when out fishing. What are you here for?"

> "Look," he said, "at the side of the hill and you will see why I am
> here."

> And she looked, and saw a great company dancing to sweet music; and
> amongst them were all the dead who had died as long as she could
> remember--men, women, and children, all in white, and their faces were
> pale as the moonlight.

> "Now," said the young man, "run for your life; for if once the fairies
> bring you into the dance you will never be able to leave them any
> more."

> But while they were talking, the fairies came up and danced round her
> in a circle, joining their hands. And she fell to the ground in a
> faint, and knew no more till she woke up in the morning in her own bed
> at home. And they all saw that her face was pale as the dead, and they
> knew that she had got the fairy-stroke. So the herb doctor was sent
> for, and every measure tried to save her, but without avail, for just
> as the moon rose that night, soft, low music was heard round the
> house, and when they looked at the woman she was dead.

> It is a custom amongst the people, when throwing away water at night,
> to cry out in a loud voice, "Take care of the water;" or, literally
> from the Irish, "Away with yourself from the water "---for they say
> the spirits of the dead last buried are then wandering about, and it
> would be dangerous if the water fell on them.

> One dark winter's night a woman suddenly threw out a pail of boiling
> water without thinking of the warning words. Instantly a cry was heard
> as of a person in pain, but no one was seen. However, the next night a
> black lamb entered the house, having the back all fresh scalded, and
> it lay down moaning by time hearth and died. Then they all knew this
> was the spirit that had been scalded by the woman. And they carried
> the dead lamb out reverently and buried it deep in the earth. Yet
> every night at the same hour it walked again into the house and lay
> down and moaned and died. And after this had happened many times, the
> priest was sent for, and finally, by the strength of his exorcism, the
> spirit of the dead was laid to rest, and the black lamb appeared no
> more. Neither was the body of the dead lamb found in the grave when
> they searched for it, though it had been laid by their own hands deep
> in the earth and covered with the clay.

> \*

> Before an accident happens to a boat, or a death by drowning, low
> music is often heard, as if under the water, along with harmonious
> lamentations, and then every one in the boat knows that some young man
> or beautiful young girl is wanted by the fairies, and is doomed to
> die. The best safeguard is to have music and singing in the boat, for
> the fairies are so enamoured of the mortal voices and music that they
> forget to weave the spell till the fatal moment has passed, and then
> all in the boat are safe from harm.
