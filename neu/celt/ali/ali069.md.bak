The Sidhe Race

> THE Sidhe dwell in the Sifra, or fairy palace of gold and crystal, in
> the heart of the hill, and they have been given youth, beauty, joy,
> and the power over music, yet they are often sad; for they remember
> that they were once angels in heaven though now cast down to earth,
> and though they have power over all the mysteries of Nature, yet they
> must die without hope of regaining heaven, while mortals are certain
> of immortality. Therefore this one sorrow darkens their life, a
> mournful envy of humanity; because, while man is created immortal, the
> beautiful fairy race is doomed to annihilation.

> One day a great fairy chief asked Columb-Kille if there were any hope
> left to the Sidhe that one day they would regain heaven and be
> restored to their ancient place amongst the angels. But the saint
> answered that hope there was none; their doom was fixed, and at the
> judgment-day they would pass through death into annihilation; for so
> had it been decreed by the justice of God.

> On hearing this the fairy chief fell into a profound melancholy, and
> he and all his court sailed away from Ireland, and went back to their
> native country of Armenia, there to await the coming of the terrible
> judgment-day, which is fated to bring the fairy race certain death on
> earth, without any hope of regaining heaven.

> The West of Ireland is peculiarly sacred to ancient superstitions of
> the Sidhe race. There is a poetry in the scenery that touches the
> heart of the people; they love the beautiful glens, the mountains
> rising like towers from the sea, the islands sanctified by the memory
> of a saint, and the green hills where Finvarra holds his court. Every
> lake and mountain has its legend of the spirit-land, some holy
> traditions of a saint, or some historic memory of a national hero who
> flourished in the old great days when Ireland had native chiefs and
> native swords to guard her; and amongst the Western Irish, especially,
> the old superstitions of their forefathers are reverenced with a
> solemn faith and fervour that is almost a religion. Finvarra the king
> is still believed to rule over all the fairies of the west, and
> *Onagh* is the fairy queen. Her golden hair sweeps the ground, and she
> is robed in silver gossamer all glittering as if with diamonds, but
> they are dew-drops that sparkle over it.

> The queen is more beautiful than any woman of earth, yet Finvarra
> loves the mortal women best, and wiles them down to his fairy palace
> by the subtle charm of the fairy music, for no one who has heard it
> can resist its power, and they are fated to belong to the fairies ever
> after. Their friends mourn for them as dead with much lamentation, but
> in reality they are leading a joyous life down in the heart of the
> bill, in the fairy palace with the silver columns and the crystal
> walls.

> Yet sometimes they are not drawn down beneath the earth, but remain as
> usual in the daily life, though the fairy spell is still on them; and
> the young men who have once heard the fairy harp become possessed by
> the spirit of music which haunts them to their death, and gives them
> strange power over the souls of men. This was the case with Carolan,
> the celebrated bard. He acquired all the magic melody of his notes by
> sleeping out on a fairy rath at night, when the fairy music came to
> him in his dreams; and on awaking he played the airs from memory. This
> it was that he had power to madden men to mirth, or to set them
> weeping as if for the dead, and no one ever before or since played the
> enchanting fairy music like Carolan, the sweet musician of Ireland.

> There was another man also who heard the fairy music when sleeping on
> a rath, and ever after he was haunted by the melody day and night,
> till he grew mad and had no pleasure in life, for he longed to be with
> the fairies again that he might hear them sing. So one day, driven to
> despair by the madness of longing, he threw himself from the cliff
> into the mountain lake near the fairy rath, and so died and was seen
> no more.

> In the Western Islands they believe that the magic of fairy-music is
> so strong that whoever hears it cannot choose but follow the sound,
> and the young girls are drawn away by the enchantment, and dance all
> night with Finvarra the king, though in the morning they are found
> fast asleep in bed, yet with a memory of all they had heard and seen;
> and some say that, while with the fairies, the young women learn
> strange secrets of love potions, by which they can work spells and
> dangerous charms over those whose love they desire, or upon any one
> who has offended and spoken ill of them.

> It is a beautiful idea that the Irish airs, so plaintive, mournful,
> and tear-compelling, are but the remembered echoes of that spirit
> music which had power to draw souls away to the fairy mansions, and
> hold them captive by the sweet magic of the melody.
