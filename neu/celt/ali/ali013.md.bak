The Trial by Fire

> THE ordeal by fire is the great test adopted by the peasants to try if
> a child or any one is fairy-struck. There was a man in Mayo who was
> bedridden for months and months, and though he ate up all the food
> they brought him, he never grew a bit stronger, and on Sundays when
> they went to mass, they locked him up and left him alone in the place
> with plenty of food. Now there was a fine field close by, and one
> Sunday, coming home from mass earlier than usual, they saw a great
> company of people bowling in the field, and the sick man amongst them,
> but at that moment he vanished away; and when the family reached home,
> there was the sick man lying fast asleep in his bed.

> "Get up," they said, "for we have seen you bowling with the fairies,
> and you sha'n't eat or drink any more at our expense."

> But he refused, and said he was too ill to move. Then they made down a
> large fire of turf and said, "Get up, or we'll lay you on the fire and
> break the fairy spell." And they took hold of him to burn him. Then he
> was frightened, and rose up and went out at the door, and they watched
> him till he stopped in the field where the hurlers played, and lay
> down there in the grass; but when they went up to him He was dead.

> A man going to his work one morning early saw two women going up to a
> house, and one said, "There is a beautiful boy in this house, go in
> and hand it out to me, and we'll leave the dead child in its place."
> And the other went in at the window as she was told, and handed out a
> sleeping child, and took the dead child and laid it in the bed within.
> Now the man saw it was fairy work, and he went over and made the sign
> of the cross on the sleeping child, whereupon the two women shrieked
> as if they had been struck, and fled away, dropping the child on the
> grass. Then the man took it up gently, and put it under his coat, and
> went away to his wife.

> "Here," he said, "take care of this child till I come back, and burn a
> turf beside the cradle to keep off the fairies."

> When he passed by the house again, where he had seen the two women, he
> heard a great crying and lamentation; and he entered in and asked what
> ailed them.

> "See here," said, the mother, "my child is dead in its cradle. It died
> in the night, and no one near." And she wept bitterly.

> "Be comforted," said the man; "this is a fairy changeling, your child
> is safe!" and he told her the story. "Now," He said,." if you don't
> believe me, just lay this dead child on the fire, and we'll see what
> will happen."

> So she made down a good fire, and took the dead child in her arms, and
> laid it on the hot turf, saying, "Burn, burn, burn--if of the devil,
> burn; but if of God and the Saints, be safe from harm." And the child
> no sooner felt the fire than it sprang up the chimney with a cry and
> disappeared.
