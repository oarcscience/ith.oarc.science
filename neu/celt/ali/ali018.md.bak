The Farmer Punished

> THE fairies, with their free, joyous temperament and love of beauty
> and luxury, hold in great contempt the minor virtues of thrift and
> economy, and, above all things, abhor the close, hard, niggardly
> nature that spends grudgingly and never gives freely. Indeed, they
> seem to hold it as their peculiar mission to punish such people, and
> make them suffer for the sins of the hard heart and niggard hand, as
> may be seen by the following tale:--

> A farmer once lived near the Boyne, close to an old churchyard. He was
> very rich, and had crops and cattle, but was so hard and avaricious
> that the people hated him; for his habit was to get up very early in
> the morning and go out to the fields to watch that no one took a
> cabbage or a turnip, or got a cup of milk when the cows were being
> milked, for the love of God and the saints.

> One morning, as he was out as usual by sunrise spying about the place,
> he heard a child crying bitterly--

> "Oh, mother, mother! I am hungry. Give me something, or I'll die."

> "Hush, darling," said the mother, "though the hunger is on you, wait;
> for the farmer's cow will be milked presently, and I'll knock down the
> pail so the milk will be spilt upon the ground, and you can drink your
> fill." \[a\]

> When the farmer heard this he sent a stout man to watch the girl that
> milked, and to tie the cow's feet that she should not kick. So that
> the no milk was spilled upon the ground.

> Next morning he went out again by sunrise, and, he heard the child
> crying more bitterly even than before--

> "Mother, mother! I am hungry. Give me to eat."

> "Wait, my child," said the mother; "the farmer's maid bakes cakes
> to-day, and I'll make the dish to fall just as she is carrying them
> from the griddle. So we shall have plenty to eat this the."

> Then the farmer went home and locked up the meal, and said--

> "No cakes shall be baked to-day, not till the night." But the cry of
> the child was in his ears, and he could not rest.

> So early in the morning he was out again, and bitter was the cry of
> the child as he passed the copse--

> "Mother, mother!" it said, "I have had no milk, I have had no cake;
> let me lay down my head on your breast and die."

> "Wait," said the mother, "some one will die before you, my darling.
> Let the old man look to his son, for he will be killed in battle
> before many days are over; and then the curse will be lifted from the
> poor, and we shall have food in plenty."

> But the farmer laughed. "There is no war in Ireland now," he said to
> himself. "How then can my son be killed in battle?" And he went home
> to his own house, and there in the courtyard was his son cleaning his
> spear and sharpening his arrows. He was a comely youth, tall and
> slender as a young oak-tree, and his brown hair fell in long curls
> over his shoulders.

> "Father," he said, "I am summoned by the king, for he is at war with
> the other kings. So give me the swiftest horse you have, for I must be
> off to-night to join the king's men. And see, I have my spears and
> arrows ready."

> Now at that the in Ireland there were four great kings, and each of
> them had two deputies. And the king of Leinster made a great feast for
> the deputies, and to seven of them he gave a brooch of gold each, but
> to the eighth only a brooch of silver, for, he said, the man is not a
> prince like the others. Then the eighth deputy was angry, and he
> struck the king's page full in the face for handing him the brooch. On
> this all the knights sprang up and drew their swords, and some took
> one part and some another, and there was a great fight in the hall.
> And afterwards the four kings quarrelled, and the king of Leinster
> sent out messengers to bid all his people come to help him. So the
> farmer's son got the message as well as the others, and he made ready
> at once to join the battle with a proud heart for the sake of the king
> and a young man's love of adventure.

> Then the farmer was filled with rage.

> "This is the wicked work of the witch woman," he said; "but as I would
> not give her the milk to spill, for the cakes when baked, so I will
> not give her the life of my only son."

> And he took large stones and built up great walls the height of a man,
> round a hut, and set a great stone at the top to close it, only
> leaving 'places for a vessel of food to be handed down. And he placed
> the lad within the hut.

> "Now," he said," the king shall not have him, nor the king's men; he
> is safe from the battle and the spears of the warriors."

> So the next morning he rose up quite content, and was out at sunrise
> as usual; and as he walked by the churchyard, he heard the child
> laughing. And the mother said--

> "Child, you laugh by a grave. For the farmer's son will be laid in
> that ground before three days are over, and then the curse will he
> lifted from the poor. He would not let the milk be spilled, nor the
> cakes to be baked, but he cannot keep his son from death. The spell is
> on him for evil."

> Then a voice said--

> "But his father has walled him round in a hut with strong walls, high
> as a man. how then can he die in battle?"

> And the woman answered--

> "I climbed the hut last night and gave him nine stones, and bade him
> throw them one by one over his left shoulder, and each the a stone of
> the wall would fall down, till free space was left him to escape, and
> this he did; and before sunrise this morning he fled away, and has
> joined the king's army; but his grave is ready, and in three days he
> will be in this ground, for his doom is spoken."

> When the farmer heard these words, he rushed like mad to the hut, and
> called his son by name; but no answer came. Then he climbed up and
> looked in through the hole at the top, but no sign of his son was
> there. And he wrung his hands in despair, and went home and spake no
> word, but sat moaning with his head buried in his hands.

> And on the third day he heard the steps of men outside, and he rose
> up, for he knew they were bearing the body of his dead son to the
> door. And he went out to meet them, and there lay the corpse of the
> young man on the bier, pale and beautiful, struck through and through
> by a spear, even as he had died in battle.

> And they laid him in the churchyard, just as the witch-woman had
> foretold, while all the people wept, for the young man was noble to
> look upon, and of a good and upright spirit.

> But the father neither spoke nor wept his mind was gone, and his heart
> was broken. And soon he lay down and died, un-pitied by all; for he
> was hard and cruel in his life, and no man wept for him; and all the
> riches he had gathered by grinding down the poor melted away, and his
> race perished from the land, and his name was heard of no more, and no
> blessing rested on his memory.

> \[a\] The fairies have a right to whatever is spilt or falls upon the
