The Well of Worship

> AT *Tober Mire,* the well of the field of worship, County Cork, there
> are also many pagan monuments, and it is evident that the vicinity was
> one of time strongholds of the Druids in ancient times, where they had
> a temple, a burial-ground, and stones for sacrifice: a much larger
> population existed also round the temple than can now be numbered in
> the same locality.
