Festivals

Candlemas

> CANDLEMAS day, the 2nd of February, used to be held in the old pagan
> times as a kind of saturnalia, with dances and torches and many unholy
> rites. But these gave occasion to so much ill conduct that in the
> ninth century the Pope abolished the festival, and substituted for it
> the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin, when candles were
> lit in her honour. Hence the name of Candlemas.
