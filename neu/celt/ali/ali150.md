For Epilepsy

> Take nine pieces of young elder twig; run a thread of silk of three
> strands through the pieces, each piece being an inch long. Tie this
> round the patient's neck next the skin. Should the thread break and
> the amulet fall, it must be buried deep in the earth and another
> amulet made like the first, for if once it touches the ground the
> charm is lost.

> Another.

> Take nine pieces of a dead man's skull, grind them to powder, and then
> mix with a decoction of wall rue. Give the patient a spoonful of this
> mixture every morning fasting, till the whole potion is swallowed.
> None must be left, or the dead man would come to look for the pieces
> of his skull.
