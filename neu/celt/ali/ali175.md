St Patrick and the Princesses

> One day the two daughters of the King of Meath, named Ethna and
> Fedalma, went down to the river to bathe, and there they beheld St.
> Patrick and his band of converts all draped in white robes, for they
> were celebrating morning prayers. And the princesses seeing strange
> men in white garments thought they were of the race of the male
> fairies, the *Daine-Sidhe.* And they questioned them. Then St. Patrick
> expounded the truth to them, and the maidens asked him many questions:
> "Who is your God? Is He handsome? Are His daughters as handsome as we
> are? Is He rich? Is He young or aged? Is he to die, or does He live
> for ever?"

> Now St. Patrick having satisfied them on all these points the maidens,
> Ethna and Fedalma, were baptized, and became zealous workers for the
> Christian cause.
