Seanchan the Bard and the King of the Cats

> THERE is an amusing legend preserved in Ossianic tradition of the
> encounter between Seanciman, the celebrated chief poet of Ireland,
> amid the King of all the Cats, who dwelt in a cave near Clonmacnoise.

> In ancient Ireland the men of learning were esteemed beyond all other
> classes; all the great ollaves and professors and poets held the very
> highest social position, and took precedence of the nobles, and ranked
> next to royalty. The leading men amongst them lived luxuriously in the
> great Bardic House; and when they went abroad through the country they
> travelled with a train of minor bards, fifty or more, and were
> entertained free of cost by the kings amid chiefs, who considered
> themselves highly honoured by the presence of so distinguished a
> company at their court. If the receptions were splendid and costly,
> the praise of the entertainer was chanted by all the poets at the
> feast; but if any slight were offered, then the Ard-File poured forth
> his stinging satire in such bitter odes, that many declared they would
> sooner die than incur the anger of the poets or be made the subject of
> their scathing satire.

> All the learned men and professors, the ollaves of music, poetry,
> oratory, and of the arts and sciences generally, formed a great Bardic
> Association, who elected their own president, with the title of Chief
> Poet of all Ireland, and they also elected chief poets for each of the
> provinces. Learned women, likewise, and poetesses, were included in
> the Bardic Association, with distinct and recognized privileges, both
> as to revenue and costly apparel. Legal enactments even were made
> respecting the number of colours allowed to be worn in their
> mantles--the poet being allowed six colours, and the poetess five in
> her robe and mantle; the number of colours being a distinct
> recognition and visible sign of rank, and therefore very highly
> esteemed. But, in the, as a consequence of their many and great
> privileges, the pride and insolence of the learned class, the ollamhs,
> poets, and poetesses, became so insufferable, that even the kings
> trembled before them. This is shown in the Ossianic tale, from which
> we may gather that Seanchan the Bard, when entertained at the court of
> King Guaire, grew jealous of the attention paid to the nobles while he
> was present. So he sulked at the festival, and made himself eminently
> disagreeable, as will be seen by the following legend:--

> When Seanchan, the renowned Bard, was made *Ard-Filé,* or Chief Poet
> of Ireland, Guaire, the king of Connaught, to do him honour, made a
> great feast for him and the whole Bardic Association. And all the
> professors went to the king's house, the great ollaves of poetry and
> history and music, and of the arts and sciences; and the learned, aged
> females, Grug and Grag and Grangait: and all the chief poets and
> poetesses of Ireland, an amazing number. But Guaire tile king
> entertained them all splendidly, so that the ancient pathway to his
> palace is still called "The Road of the Dishes."

> And each day he asked, "How fares it with my noble guests?" But they
> were all discontented, and wanted things he could not get for them. So
> he was very sorrowful, and prayed to God to be delivered from "the
> learned men and women, a vexatious class."

> Still the feast went on for three days and three nights. And they
> drank and made merry. And the whole Bardic Association entertained
> tile nobles with the choicest music and professional accomplishments.

> But Seanchan sulked and would neither eat nor drink, for he was
> jealous of the nobles of Connaught. And when he saw how much they
> consumed of tile best meats and wine, he declared he would taste no
> food till they and their servants were all sent away out of the house.

> And when Guaire asked him again, "how fares my noble guest, and this
> great and excellent people?" Seanchan answered, "I have never had
> worse days, nor worse nights, nor worse dinners in my life." And he
> ate nothing for three whole days.

> Then the king was sorely grieved that the whole Bardic Association
> should be feasting and drinking while Seanchan, the chief poet of
> Erin, was fasting and weak. So he sent his favourite serving-man, a
> person of mild manners and cleanliness, to offer special dishes to the
> bard.

> "Take them away," said Seanchan; "I'll have none of them."

> "And why, oh, Royal Bard?" asked the servitor.

> "Because thou art an uncomely youth," answered Seanchan. "Thy
> grandfather was chip-nailed--I have seen him; I shall eat no food from
> thy hands."

> Then the king called a beautiful maiden to him, his foster daughter,
> and said, "Lady, bring thou this wheaten cake and this dish of salmon
> to the illustrious poet, and serve him thyself." So the maiden went.

> But when Seanchan saw her he asked: "Who sent thee hither, and why
> hast thou brought me food?"

> "My lord the king sent me, oh, Royal Bard," she answered, "because I
> am comely to look upon, and he bade me serve thee with food myself."

> "Take it away," said Seanchan, "thou art an unseemly girl, I know of
> none more ugly. I have seen thy grandmother; she sat on a wall one day
> and pointed out the way with her hand to some travelling lepers. How
> could I touch thy food?" So the maiden went away in sorrow.

> And then Guaire the king was indeed angry, and he exclaimed, "My
> malediction on the mouth that uttered that! May the kiss of a leper be
> on Seanchan's lips before he dies!"

> Now there was a young serving-girl there, and she said to Seanchan,
> "There is a hen's egg in the place, my lord, may I bring it to thee,
> oh, Chief Bard?"

> "It will suffice," said Seanchan; "bring it that I may eat."

> But when she went to look for it, behold the egg was gone.

> "Thou hast eaten it," said the bard, in wrath.

> "Not so, my lord," she answered; "but the mice, the nimble race, have
> carried it away."

> "Then I will satirize them in a poem," said Seanchan; and forthwith he
> chanted so bitter a satire against them that ten mice fell dead at
> once in his presence.

> "Tis well," said Seanchan; "but the cat is the one most to blame, for
> it was her duty to suppress the mice. Therefore I shall satirize the
> tribe of the cats, and their chief lord, Irusan, son of Arusan. For I
> know where he lives with his wife Spit-fire, and his daughter
> Sharp-tooth, with her brothers, the Purrer and the Growler. But I
> shall begin with Irusan himself, for he is king, and answerable for
> all the cats."

> And he said--"Irusan, monster of claws, who strikes at the mouse, but
> lets it go; weakest of cats. The otter did well who bit off the tips
> of thy progenitor's ears, so that every cat since is jagged-eared. Let
> thy tail hang down; it is right, for the mouse jeers at thee."

> Now Irusan heard these words in his cave, and he said to his daughter,
> Sharp-tooth: "Seanchan has satirized me, but I will be avenged."

> "Nay, father," she said," bring him here alive, that we may all take
> our revenge."

> "I shall go then and bring him," said Irusan; "so send thy brothers
> after me."

> Now when it was told to Seanchan that the King of the Cats was on his
> way to come and kill him, he was timorous, and besought Guaire and all
> the nobles to stand by and protect him. And before long a vibrating,
> impressive, impetuous sound was heard, like a raging tempest of fire
> in full blaze. And when the cat appeared he seemed to them of the size
> of a bullock; and this was his appearance--rapacious, panting,
> jagged-eared, snub-nosed, sharp-toothed, nimble, angry, vindictive,
> glare-eyed, terrible, sharp-clawed. Such was his similitude. But he
> passed on amongst them, not minding till he came to Seanchan; and him
> he seized by the arm and jerked him up on his back, and made off the
> way he came before any one could touch him; for he had no other object
> in view but to get hold of the poet.

> Now Seanchan, being in evil plight, had recourse to flattery. "Oh,
> Irusan," he exclaimed, "how truly splendid thou art, such running,
> such leaps, such strength, and such agility! But what evil have I
> done, oh, Irusan, son of Arusan? spare me, I entreat. I invoke the
> saints between thee and me, oh, great King of the Cats."

> But not a bit did the cat let go his hold for all this fine talk, but
> went straight on to Clonmacnoise where there was a forge; and St.
> Kieran happened to be there standing at the door.

> "What!" exclaimed the saint; "is that the Chief Bard of Erin on the
> back of a cat? Has Guaire's hospitality ended in this?" And he ran for
> a red-hot bar of iron that was in the furnace, and struck the cat on
> the side with it, so that the iron passed through him, and he fell
> down lifeless.

> "Now my curse on the hand that gave that blow!" said the bard, when he
> got upon his feet.

> "And wherefore?" asked St. Kieran.

> "Because," answered Seanchan, "I would rather Irusan had killed me,
> and eaten me every bit, that so I might bring disgrace on Guaire for
> the bad food he gave me; for it was all owing to his wretched dinners
> that I got into this plight."

> And when all the other kings heard of Seanchan's misfortunes, they
> sent to beg he would visit their courts. But he would have neither
> kiss nor welcome from them, and went on his way to the bardic mansion,
> where the best of good living was always to be had. And ever after the
> kings were afraid to offend Seanchan.

> So as long as he lived he had the chief place at the feast, and all
> the nobles there were made to sit below him, and Seanchan was content.
> And in time he and Guaire were reconciled; and Seanchan and all the
> ollamhs, and the whole Bardic Association, were feasted by the king
> for thirty days in noble style, and had the choicest of viands and the
> best of French wines to drink, served in goblets of silver. And in
> return for his splendid hospitality the Bardic Association decreed,
> unanimously, a vote of thanks to the king. And they praised him in
> poems as "Guairo the Generous," by which name he was ever after known
> in history, for the words of the poet are immortal.
