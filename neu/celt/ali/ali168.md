To Attract Bees

> Gather foxglove, raspberry leaves, wild marjorum, mint, camomile, and
> valerian; mix them with butter made on May Day, and let the herbs also
> be gathered on May Day. Boil them all together with honey; then rub
> the vessel into which the bees should gather, both inside and out,
> with the mixture; place it in the middle of a tree, and the bees will
> soon come. Foxglove or "fairy fingers" is called "the great herb" from
> its wondrous properties.
