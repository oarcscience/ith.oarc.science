The Changeling

> A WOMAN was one night lying awake while her husband slept, when the
> door suddenly opened and a tall dark man entered, of fierce aspect.,
> followed by an old hag with a child in her arms--a little, misshapen,
> sickly-looking little thing. They both sat down by the fire to warm
> themselves, and after some time the man looked over at the cradle that
> stood beside the mother's bed with her boy in it, and kept his eyes on
> it for several minutes. Then he rose, and when the mother saw him
> walking over direct to the cradle, she fainted and knew no more.

> When she came to herself she called to her husband, and bade him light
> a candle; thus he did, on which the old hag in the Corner rose up at
> once and blew it out. Then he lit it a second time, and it. was blown
> out; and still a third time he lit the candle, when again it was blown
> out, and a great peal of laughter was heard in the darkness.

> On this the man grew terribly angry, and taking up the tongs he made a
> blow at the hag; but she slipped away, and struck him on the arm with
> a stick she held in her hand. Then he grew more furious, and beat her
> on the head till she roared, when he pushed her outside and locked the
> door.

> After this he lit the candle in peace; but when they looked at the
> cradle, lo! in place of their own beautiful boy, a hideous little
> creature, all covered with hair, lay grinning at them. Great was their
> grief and lamentation, and both the man and his wife wept and wailed
> aloud for the loss of their child, and the cry of their sorrow was
> bitter to hear.

> Just then the door suddenly opened, and a young woman came in, with a
> scarlet handkerchief wound round her head.

> "What are you crying for," she asked, "at this time of night, when
> every one should be asleep?"

> "Look at this child in the cradle," answered the man, "and you will
> cease to wonder why we mourn and are sad at heart." And he told her
> all the story.

> When the young woman went over to the cradle and looked at the child,
> she laughed, but said nothing.

> "Your laughter is stranger than our tears," said the man. "Why do you
> laugh in the face of our sorrows?"

> "Because," she said, "this is my child that was stolen from me
> to-night; for I am one of the fairy race, and my people, who live
> under the fort on the hill, thought your boy was a fine child, and so
> they changed the babies in the cradle; but. after all I would rather
> have my own, ugly as he is, than any mortal child in the world. So now
> I'll tell you how to get back your own son, and I'll take away mine at
> once. Go to the old fort on the hill when the moon is full, and take
> with you three sheafs of corn and some fire, and burn them one after
> the other. And when the last sheaf is burning, an old man will come up
> through the smoke, and he will ask you what it is you desire. Then
> tell him you must have your child back, or you will burn down the
> fort, and leave no dwelling-place for his people on the hill. Now, the
> fairies cannot stand against the power of fire, and they will give you
> back your child at the mere threat of burning the fort. But mind, take
> good care of him after, and tie a nail from a horse-shoe round his
> neck, and then he will be safe."

> With that the young woman took up the ugly little imp from the cradle
> in her arms, and was away before they could see how she got out of the
> house.

> Next night, when the moon was full, the man went to the old fort with
> the three sheafs of corn and the fire, and burned them one after the
> other; and as the second was lighted there came up an old man and
> asked him what was his desire.

> "I must have my child again that was stolen," he answered, "or I'll
> burn down every tree on the hill, and not leave you a stone of the
> fort where you can shelter any more with your fairy kindred."

> Then the old man vanished, and there was a great silence, but no one
> appeared.

> On this the father grew angry, and he called out in a loud voice, "I
> am lifting the third sheaf now, and I'll burn and destroy and make
> desolate your dwelling-place, if my child is not retuned."

> Then a great tumult and clamour was heard in the fort, and a voice
> said, "Let it be. The power of the fire is too strong for us. Bring
> forth the child."

> And presently the old man appeared, carrying the child in his arms.

> "Take him," he said. "By the spell of the fire, and the corn you have
> conquered. But take my advice, draw a circle of fire, with a hot coal
> this night, round the cradle when you go home, and the fairy power
> cannot touch him any more, by reason of the fire.

> So the man did as he was. desired, and by the spell of fire and of
> corn the child was saved from evil, and he grew and prospered. And the
> old fort stands to this day safe from harm, for the man would allow no
> hand to move a stone or harm a tree; and the fairies still dance there
> on the rath, when the moon is full, to the music of the fairy pipes,
> and no one hinders them.
