A Cure for Cattle

> Take nine leaves of the male crowfoot, plucked on a Sunday night;
> bruise them on a stone tht never was moved since the world began, and
> never can be moved. Mix with salt and spittle, and apply the plaster
> to the ear of the sick beast. Repeat this three times for a man, and
> twice for a horse.
