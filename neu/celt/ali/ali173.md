The Well of the Book

> When St. Patrick was one time amongst the Pagan Irish they grew very
> fierce and seemed eager to kill him. Then his life being in great
> danger, he kneeled down before them and prayed to God for help and for
> the conversion of their souls. And the fervour of the prayer was so
> great that as the saint rose up the mark of his knees was left deep in
> the stone, and when the people saw the miracle they believed.

> Now when he came to the next village the people said if he performed
> some wonder for them they also would believe and pray to his God. So
> St. Patrick drew a great circle on the ground and bade them stand
> outside it; and then he prayed, and lo! the water rushed up from the
> earth, and a well pure and bright as crystal filled the circle. And
> the people believed and were baptized.

> The well can be seen to this day, and is called *Tober-na-Lauer* (The
> Well of the Book), because St. Patrick placed his own prayer-book in
> the centre of the circle before the water rose.
