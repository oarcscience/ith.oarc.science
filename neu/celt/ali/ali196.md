The Fairy Rath

> THE fairies, beside being revengeful, are also very arrogant, and
> alIow no interference with their old-established rights.

> There is a rath in the Queen's County, only four yards in diameter,
> but held so sacred as the fairies' dancing ground that no one dared to
> remove a handful of earth from the mound; and at night the sweetest
> low music may be heard floating round the hill, as if played by silver
> bagpipes.

> One evening a boy lay down on the rath to listen to the music, and,
> without thinking, began to gather up balls of the clay and fling them
> hither and thither in sport, when suddenly he was struck down by a
> violent blow and became senseless.

> There he was found by his people, who went to search for him; and when
> he came to himself he bleated like a calf, and it was a long time
> before he recovered his reason, for the power of the fairies is great,
> and none can resist it.
