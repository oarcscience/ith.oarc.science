Superstitions Concerning the Dead

> MANY strange spells are effected by the means of a dead man's
> hand--chiefly to produce butter in the churn. The milk is stirred
> round nine times with the dead hand, the operator crying aloud all the
> time, "Gather! gather! gather." While a secret form of words is used
> which none but the initiated know.

>  

> Another use is to facilitate robberies. If a candle is placed in a
> dead hand, neither wind nor water can extinguish it. And if carried
> into a house the inmates will sleep the sleep of the dead as long as
> it remains under the roof, and no power on earth can wake them while
> the dead hand holds the candle.

>  

> For a mystic charm, one of the strongest known is the hand of an
> unbaptized infant fresh taken from the grave in the name pf the Evil
> One.

>  

> A dead hand is esteemed also a certain cure for most diseases, and
> many a time sick people have been brought to a house where a corpse
> lay that the hand of the dead might be laid on them.

> \*

> The souls of the dead who may happen to die abroad, greatly desire to
> rest in Ireland. And the relations deem it their duty to bring back
> the body to be laid in Irish earth. But even then the dead will not
> rest peaceably unless laid with their forefathers and their own
> people, and not amongst strangers.

> A young girl happened to die of a fever while away on a visit to some
> friends, and her father thought it safer not to bring her home, but to
> have her buried in the nearest churchyard. However, a few nights after
> his return home, he was awakened by a mournful wail at the window, and
> a voice cried, "I am alone; I am alone; I am alone!" Then the poor
> father knew well what it meant, and he prayed in the name of God that
> the spirit of his dead child might rest in peace until the morning.
> And when the day broke he arose and set off to the strange burial
> ground, and there he drew the coffin from, the earth, and had it
> carried all the way back from Cork to Mayo; and after he had laid time
> dead in the old graveyard beside his people and his kindred, the
> spirit of his child had rest, and the mournful cry was no more heard
> in the night.

> \*

> The corner of a sheet that has wrapped a corpse is 'a cure for
> headache if tied round the head.

>  

> The ends of candles used at wakes are of great efficacy in curing
> burns.

>  

> A piece of linen wrap taken from a corpse will cure the swelling of a
> limb if tied round the part affected.

>  

> It is believed that the spirit of the dead last buried has to watch in
> the churchyard until another corpse is laid there; or has to perform
> menial offices in the spirit world, such as carrying wood and water
> until the next spirit comes from earth. They are also sent on messages
> to earth, chiefly to announce the coming death of some relative, and
> at this they are glad, for then their time of peace and rest will come
> at last.

>  

> If any one stumbles at a grave it is a bad omen; but if he falls and
> touches the clay, he will assuredly die before the year is out.

>  

> Any one meeting a funeral must turn back and walk at least four steps
> with the mourners.

>  

> If the nearest relative touches the hand of a corpse it will utter a
> wild cry if not quite dead.

>  

> On Twelfth Night the dead walk, and on every tile of the house a soul
> is sitting, waiting for your prayers to take it out of purgatory.

>  

> There are many strange superstitions in the western islands of
> Connemara. At night the dead can be heard laughing with the fairies
> and spinning the flax. One girl declared that she distinctly heard her
> dead mother's voice singing a mournful Irish air away down in the
> heart of the hill. But after a year and a day the voices cease, and
> the dead are gone for ever.

> \*

> It is a custom in the West, when a corpse is carried to the grave, for
> the bearers to stop half way, while the nearest relatives build up a
> small monument of loose stones, and no hand would ever dare to touch
> or disturb this monument while the world lasts.

> When the grave is dug, a cross is made of two spades, and the coffin
> is carried round it three times before being placed in the clay. Then
> the prayers for the dead are said, all the people kneeling with
> uncovered head.
