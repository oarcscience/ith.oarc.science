The Poet's Spell

> A VERY ancient. story, as old as the tenth century, is narrated, and
> firmly believed by the people, that once on a time when the reapers
> were at work, a fine handsome young married woman, who was in the
> field with them, suddenly fell down dead. This caused a great fear and
> consternation, especially as it was asserted that just before the
> fatal event, a fairy blast had passed over the field, carrying a cloud
> of dust and stones with it; and there could be no doubt but that the
> fairies had rushed by in the cloud, and struck the woman dead as they
> passed.

> Then her people sent for the great wise poet of the tribe, who was
> reputed to have the power by his song to break the strongest fairy
> spells: and he chanted low music over her, and uttered mystic
> incantations, the words of which no man heard; but after a while the
> woman unclosed her eyes and rose up, restored to life.

> When they questioned her, she told them all she knew.

> "In sickness I was," she said, "and I appeared to be dead, for I could
> neither speak nor move, till the song of the poet gave me power. Then
> the life rose up in me again, and the strength, and I was healed."
