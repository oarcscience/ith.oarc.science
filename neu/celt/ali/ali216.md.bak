The Lake of Revenge

> NEAR the great mountain of Croagh-Patrick there is a lake called
> *Clonveneagh,* or the Lake of Revenge, to which evil-disposed persons
> used to resort in order to imprecate maledictions on their enemies. It
> was the custom also to erect monuments round the well by placing on
> end a long flagstone, and heaping round it a pyramid of sand in order
> to keep it fixed firmly in its place. Over these pillar-stones certain
> mystic rites were then performed by the pilgrims, and prayers were
> said which took the form of the most terrible imprecations. It was
> therefore with awe and terror that one man said of another," He has
> been cursed by the stone."
