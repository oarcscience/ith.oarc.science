<P ALIGN="CENTER">Charm for the Fairy Stroke</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>THERE is a very ancient and potent charm which may be tried with great effect in case of a suspected fairy-stroke.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Place three rows of salt on a table in three lines, three equal measures to each row. The person performing the spell then encloses the rows of salt with his arm, leaning his head down over them, while he repeats the Lord's Prayer three times over each row--that is, nine times in all. Then he takes the hand of the one who has been fairy-struck, and says over it, "By the power of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, let this disease depart, and the spell of the evil spirits be broken! I adjure, I command you to leave this man [naming him]. In the name of God I pray; in the name of Christ I adjure; in the name of the Spirit of God I command and compel you to go back and leave this man free! AMEN! AMEN! AMEN!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
