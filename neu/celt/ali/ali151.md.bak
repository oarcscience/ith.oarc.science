For Depression of Heart

>  When a person becomes low and depressed and careless about
> everything, as if all vital strength and energy had gone, he is said
> to have got a fairy blast. And blast-water must be poured over him by
> the hands of a fairy doctor while saying, "In the name of the saint
> with the sword, who has strength before God and stands at His right
> hand." Great care being taken that- no portion of the water is
> profaned. Whatever is left after the operation, must be poured on the
> fire.
