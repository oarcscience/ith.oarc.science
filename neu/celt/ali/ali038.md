Raithlin Island

> THERE is an old ruin called Bruce's Castle on this island, and the
> legend runs that Bruce and his chief warriors lie in an enchanted
> sleep in a cave of this rock on which stands the castle, and that one
> day they will rise up and unite the island to Scotland.

> The entrance to this cave is visible only once in seven years. A man
> who happened to be travelling by at the time discovered it, and
> entering in he found himself all at once in the midst of the
> heavy-handed warriors, he looked down and saw a sabre half unsheathed
> in the earth at his feet, and on his attempting to draw it every man
> of time sleepers lifted up his head and put his hand on his sword. The
> man being much alarmed fled from the cave, but he heard voices calling
> fiercely after him: "Ugh! ugh! Why could we not be left to sleep?" And
> they clanged their swords on the ground with a terrible noise, and
> then all was still, and the gate of the cave closed with a mighty
> sound like a clap of thunder.
