Legends of the Saints

St. Patrick

> MANY saints in old time used to come and take up their abode in the
> wild desolate Western Islands for the rest and sanctity of solitude,
> and innumerable evidences of their presence still remain in the
> ancient ruins of the so-called cells or churches built in the rudest
> form, but always placed in a picturesque locality beside a well, which
> ever since has been held sacred, and no woman is allowed to wash her
> feet in the water.

> In one of these islands is a stone bed called "The Bed of the Holy
> Ghost," and many people go from the mainland to lie a night in this
> bed, though the sea is always rough and dangerous, believing that it
> heals all diseases, and it brings good luck to all, and to women the
> blessing of children.

> If the lark sings on St. Bridget's Day it is a good omen, and a sign
> of fine weather. And whoever hears it the first. thing in the morning
> will have god luck in all he does for that whole day. St. Bridget was
> granted by the Lord to have every second Sunday fine so that. she
> might preach to the converts that came to her.

> Then St. Patrick greatly desired that his day should also be fine so
> that the people might gather together in remembrance of him, and this
> also was granted. So from that time forth the Saints! Day, the 17th of
> March, is always fine, for so it was decreed from the ancient times
> when he was upon earth.

> On St. Patrick's Day it is the usage in the islands to affix large
> crosses made of straw and flowers on the door-posts, and a black cock
> is sacrificed in honour of the saint, though no one can tell why it is
> considered necessary that blood should be spilt, except that the idea
> of sacrifice is found in all religions and rituals of worship. At
> first the object most loved or most prized was sacrificed--a child, or
> a costly jewel. Then the human sacrifice began to be replaced by the
> offering of an animal, who was made the medium of expiation. And the
> god was satisfied so that blood was spilled to purify from sin.

> It is remarkable that relics of this ancient ritual of sacrifice can
> still be found even in the enlightened households of this advanced
> nineteenth century. An ox is still slaughtered at Christmas, though
> Baal is forgotten; and a lamb is sacrificed at Easter, as the Druids
> offered the firstlings of time flock to the Sun-god; while a goose is
> slain on St. Michael's Day as a burnt-offering to the saint.
