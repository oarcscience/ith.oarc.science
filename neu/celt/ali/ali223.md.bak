The Hurling Match

> THE fairies, with their true artistic love of all the gentle graces of
> life, greatly dislike coarse and violent gestures, and all athletic
> sports, such as hurling and wrestling; and they often try to put an
> end to them by some evil turn.

> One day a great cloud of dust came along the road during a hurling
> match and stopped the game. On this the people grew alarmed, for they
> said the fairies are out hunting and will do us harm by blinding us;
> and thousands of the Sidhe swept by, raising a terrific dust, though
> no mortal eye could them.

> Then one man, a good player and musician, ran for his fiddle and began
> to play some vigorous dance tunes, "for now," said "the fairies will
> begin to dance and forget us, and they will be off in no time to hold
> a revel on the rath to the music of their own fairy pipes."

> And so it was, for at once the whirlwind of dust swept on to the hill
> of the fairy rath, and the hurling ground was left clear for the game
> to go on again in safety.

> It must be acknowledged that the fairies are a little selfish; or they
> would not have interfered with the great national sport of hurling,
> which is the favourite amusement of the country, and used to be held
> as a high festival, and arranged with all the ceremonial of a
> tournament; at least before the bad times destroyed all the fun and
> frolic of the peasant life.

> The prettiest girl of the village was chosen as the hurling girl--the
> *Colleen-a-bhailia*. Dressed in white, and accompanied by her maidens,
> she proceeded to the hurling ground, the piper and fiddlers going
> before her playing gay dance tunes.

> There she was met by the procession of the young men surrounding the
> chief hurler--always a stalwart youth of over six feet. And the youth
> and the maiden joined hands and began the dance--all the people
> cheering.

> This was called the opening of the hurling. And for the next match
> another pair would be selected, each village girl anxiously hoping to
> be the *Colleen-a-bhailia* chosen to lead the ceremonial dance for the
> second or following games. Naturally the hurling tournament ended with
> a festive supper, much love-making, and many subsequent marriages
> between the pretty colleens and stalwart young hurlers, despite all
> the envy and jealousy o the fairies, who maliciously tried to mar the
> pleasures of the festival.
