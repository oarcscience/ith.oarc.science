The Hen's Castle

> AT the head of Lough Corrib, deep in the water about a gunshot from
> the land, stands the ancient castle of *Caisleen-na-Cearca,* said to
> have been built in one night by a cock and a hen, but in reality it
> was founded by the ill-fated Roderick O'Connor, the last king of
> Ireland. Strange lights are sometimes seen flitting through it, and on
> some particular midnight a crowd of boats gather round it, filled with
> men dressed in green with red sashes. And they row about till the cock
> crows, when they suddenly vanish and the cries of children are heard
> in the air. Then the people know that there has been a death somewhere
> in the region, and that the Sidhe have been stealing the young mortal
> children, and leaving some ill-favoured brat in the cradle in place of
> the true child.

> The old castle has many historic memories; the celebrated *Graina
> Uaile*, the great chieftainess of the West, made it her abode for some
> time, and carried thither the young heir of Howth, whom she had
> abducted from Howth Castle, when on one of her piratical expeditions.
> Afterwards, during the Wars of Elizabeth, a distinguished lady of the
> sept of the O'Flaherties, Bevinda O'Flahertie, shut herself up there
> with her only daughter and heiress, and a following of twenty resolute
> men. But further to ensure her safety, she wrote to the Queen,
> requesting permission to arm the guard; Queen Elizabeth in return sent
> an autograph letter granting the request, but addressed to "her good
> friend, Captain Bevan O'Flahertie," evidently thinking that the
> custodian of such a castle must certainly be a man.

> In the solemn solitude of this picturesque and stately
> *Caisleen-na-Cearca,* the great lake fortress of Lough Corrib, with
> its rampart of purple mountains and its water pathway fifty miles
> long, the young heiress grew up tall and beautiful, the pride of the
> west. And in due time she married Blake of Menlo Castle. And from this
> historic pair is descended the present baronet and owner of the
> property, Sir John Blake of Menlo.

> Cromwell ruthlessly dismantled the castle, and it has remained a ruin
> ever since; but the massive walls, and the beautiful twelfth century
> ornamentation of doors and windows still attest the ancient grandeur
> of the edifice, before "the curse of Cromwell fell upon it, and upon
> the country and on the people of Ireland.
