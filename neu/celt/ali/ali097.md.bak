The Raven and Water Wagtail

> If ravens come cawing about a house it is a sure sign of death, for
> the raven is Satan's own bird; so also is the water wagtail, yet
> beware of killing it, for it has three drops of the devil's blood in
> its little body, and ill-luck ever goes with it, and follows it.
