Concerning Cows

> THE most singular legends of Ireland relate to bulls and cows, and
> there are hundreds of places all commencing with the word *Bo* (one of
> the most ancient words in the Irish language), which recall some
> mystic or mythical story of a cow, especially of a white heifer, which
> animal seems to have been an object of the greatest veneration from
> all antiquity.

> In old times there arose one day a maiden from the sea, a beautiful
> Berooch, or mermaid, and all the people on the Western Coast of Erin
> gathered round her and wondered at her beauty. And the great chief of
> the land carried her home to his house, where she was treated like a
> queen.

> And she was very gentle and wise, and after some time she acquired the
> language, and could talk to the people quite well in their own Irish
> tongue, to their great delight and wonder. Then she informed them that
> she had been sent to their country by a great spirit, to announce the
> arrival in Ireland of the three sacred cows*--Bo-Finn, Bo-Ruadh,* and
> *Bo-Dhu*--the white, the red, and the black cows, who were destined to
> fill the land with the most splendid cattle, so that the people should
> never know want while the world lasted.

> This was such good news that the people in their delight carried the
> sea-maiden from house to house in procession, in order that she might
> tell it herself to every one; and they crowned her with flowers, while
> the musicians went before her, singing to their harps.

> After dwelling with them a little longer she asked to be taken back to
> the sea, for she had grown sad at being away so long from her own
> kindred. So, on May Eve, a great crowd accompanied her down to the
> strand, where she took leave of them, telling them that on that day
> year they should all assemble at the same place to await the arrival
> of the three cows. Then she plunged into the sea and was seen no more.

> However, on that day year all the people of Ireland assembled on the
> shore to watch, as they had been directed by the beautiful sea-maiden;
> and all the high cliffs and all the rocks were covered with anxious
> spectators from the early dawn. Nor did they wait in vain. Exactly at
> noon the waves were stirred with a mighty commotion, and three cows
> rose up from the sea--a white, a red, and a black--all beautiful to
> behold, with sleek skins, large soft eyes, and curved horns, white as
> ivory. They stood upon the shore for a while, looking around them.
> Then each one went in a different direction, by three roads; the black
> went south, the red went north, and the milk-white heifer--the
> *Bo-Finn*--crossed the plain of Ireland to the very centre, where
> stood the king's palace. And every place she passed was named after
> her, and every well she drank at was called *Lough-na-Bo,* or
> *Tober-Bo-Finn* (the well of the white cow), so her memory remains to
> this day.

> In process of time the white heifer gave birth to twins, a male and
> female calf, and from them descended a great race, still existing in
> Ireland; after which the white cow disappeared into a great cave by
> the sea, the entrance to which no man knows. And there she remains,
> and will remain, in an enchanted sleep, until the true king of Eirè,
> the lord of Ireland, shall come to waken her; but the lake near the
> cave is still known as *Lough-na-Bo-banna* (the lake of the snow-white
> cow). Yet some say that it was the king's daughter was carried off by
> enchantment to the cave, in the form of a cow, and she will never
> regain her form until she sleeps on the summit of each of the three
> highest mountains in Ireland; but only the true king of Eiré can wake
> her from her sleep, and bring her to "the rock of the high place,"
> when she will be restored at last to her own beautiful form.

> Another legend says that a red-haired woman struck the beautiful
> Bo-Finn with her staff, and smote her to death; and the roar which the
> white cow gave in dying was heard throughout the whole of Ireland, and
> all the people trembled. This is evidently an allegory. The beautiful
> Bo-Finn--the white cow--is Ireland herself; and the red-haired woman
> who smote her to death was Queen Elizabeth, "in whose time, after her
> cruel wars, the cry of the slaughtered people was heard all over the
> land, and went up to heaven for vengeance against the enemies of
> Ireland; and the kingdom was shaken as by an earthquake, by the roar
> of the oppressed against the tyrant."

> The path of the white cow across Ireland is marked by small rude stone
> monuments, still existing. They show the exact spot where she rested
> each night and had her bed, and the adjoining lands have names
> connected with the tradition--as, "The plain of the Fenian cows;" "The
> hill of worship;" "The pool of the spotted ox," called after him
> because he always waited to drink till the white cow came, for they
> were much attached to each other.

> There are also Druid stones at one resting-place, with Ogham marks on
> them. Some time ago an endeavour was made to remove and carry off the
> stones of one of the monuments; but the man who first put a spade in
> the ground was "struck," and remained bedridden for seven years.

> The plain of the death of time *Bo-banna* (the white Cow), where she
> gave the roar that shook all Ireland is called "the plain of
> lamentation." It never was tilled, and never will be tilled. The
> people hold it as a sacred spot, and until recently it was the custom
> to have dances there every Sunday. But these old usages are rapidly
> dying out; for though meant originally as mystic ceremonies, yet by
> degrees they degenerated to such licentious revelry that the wrath of
> the priesthood fell on them, and they were discontinued.

> There is a holy well near "the plain of lamentation," called
> *Tobar-na-Bo* (the well of the white cow); and these ancient names,
> coming down the stream of time from the far-off Pagan era, attest the
> great antiquity of time legend of the coming to Ireland of the mystic
> and beautiful
>
> Bo-Finn.

> There is another legend concerning the arrival of the three cows--the
> white, the red, and the black--which is said to be taken from the Book
> of Enoch.

> Four cows sprang at once from the earth--two white, a red, and a
> black--and one of the four went over to the white cow and taught it a
> mystery. And it trembled and became a man, and this was the first man
> that appeared in Erin. And the man fashioned a ship and dwelt there
> with the cows while a deluge covered the earth. And when time waters
> ceased, the red and the black cows went their way, but the white
> remained.

> The story is supposed by Bryant to be a literal rendering of some
> ancient hieroglyph, descriptive of the three races of mankind, and of
> the dispersion of the primal human family.
