To Win Love

> "O Christ, by your five wounds, by the nine orders of angels, if this
> woman is ordained for me, let me hold her hand now, and breathe her
> breath. O my love, I set a charm to the top of your head; to the sole
> of your foot; to each side of your breast, that you may not leave me
> nor forsake me. As a foal after the mare, as a child after the mother,
> may you follow and stay with me till death comes to part us asunder.
> AMEN."

> Another.

> A charm of most desperate love, to be written with a raven's quill in
> the blood of the ring finger of the left hand.

> "By the power that Christ brought from heaven, mayest thou love me,
> woman! As the sun follows its course, mayest thou follow me. As light
> to the eye, as bread to the hungry, as joy to the heart, may thy
> presence be with me, O woman that I love, till death comes to part us
> asunder."
