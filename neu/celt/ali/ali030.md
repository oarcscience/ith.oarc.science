Legends of the Dead in the Western Islands

> WHEN young people die, either men or women, who were remarkable for
> beauty, it is supposed that they are carried off by the fairies to the
> fairy mansions tinder the earth, where they live in splendid palaces
> and are wedded to fairy queens or princes. But sometimes, if their
> kindred greatly desire to see them, they are allowed to visit the
> earth, though no enchantment has yet been discovered powerful enough
> to compel them to remain or resume again the mortal life.

> Sometimes when the fishermen are out they meet a strange boat filled
> with people; and when they look on them they know that they are the
> dead who have been carried off by the fairies with their wiles and
> enchantments to dwell in the fairy palaces.

> One day a man was out fishing, but caught nothing; and was just
> turning home in despair at his ill-luck when he suddenly saw a boat
> with three persons in it; and it seemed to him that they were his
> comrades, the very men who just a year before had been drowned in that
> spot, but whose bodies were never recovered, and he knew that he
> looked upon the dead. But the men were friendly, and called out to
> him--

> "Cast your line as we direct, and you will have luck."

> So he cast his line as they bade him, and presently drew up a fine
> fish.

> "Now, cast again," they said, "and keep beside us, and row to shore,
> but do not look on us."

> So he did as directed and hauled tip fish after fish till his boat was
> full, and then he drew it up to the landing-place.

> "Now," they said, "wait and see that no one is about before you land."

> So the man looked up and down the shore, but saw no one; then he
> turned to land his fish, when, behold, the men and the second boat had
> vanished, and he saw them no more. however, he landed his fish with
> much joy and brought them all safely home, though the wise people said
> that if he had not turned away his head that time, but kept his eyes
> steadily on the men till he landed, the enchantment would have been
> broken that held them in fairy-land, and the dead would have been
> restored to the earthly life, and to their kindred in the island who
> mourned for them.
