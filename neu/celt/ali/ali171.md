Relics

> If a false oath is taken upon a relic the vengeance of God falls upon
> the swearer, and the doom that few can bear and live rests upon him
> and upon all his descendants even to the seventh generation. They are
> shunned by the people, and looked upon as unlucky and accursed. There
> are some living even now from whom the curse of the past is not
> lifted, because the seventh generation has not yet passed by.
