Sacred Trees

> THE large old hawthorns, growing singly in a field or by an ancient
> well, are considered very sacred; and no one would venture to cut them
> down, for the fairies dance under the branches at night, and would
> resent being interfered with.

>  There is a holy Stone in an island of the Shannon, called St.
> Patrick's Stone. It is shadowed by an aged hawthorn, the per­fume of
> which can be scented far off on the mainland in the flowering season.
> At the top of this stone is a large hollow, always filled with water
> by the rain or the dew, which is kept from evaporation by the heavy
> shadows of the branching haw­thorn, it is believed that the water of
> this hollow has great healing power, and sometimes when a patient is
> brought from a distance, a rude stone aimed is built under the tree,
> and there he is laid till the cure is completed by the water of the
> Holy Stone. On leaving he ties a votive offering to the tree, which is
> always covered with these memorials of gratitude.

>  In autumn the people go to bewail the dead at St. Patrick's Stone and
> the mournful Irish chant may be often heard rising up in the still
> evening air with weird and solemn effect.
