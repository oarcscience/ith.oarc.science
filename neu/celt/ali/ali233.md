Early Irish Art

> EARLY Irish art illustrates in a very remarkable manner those
> distinctive qualities of Irish nature, which we know from the
> legendary traditions have characterized our people from the earh est
> times. The earnest religious faith, the love of gorgeous colouring,
> the tendency to express ideas by symbol, and the vivid imagination
> that delights in the strange and unusual, often fantastic and
> grotesque, in place of the absolute and real, combined with the
> patient. and minute elaboration of details, so truly Oriental in its
> spirit, specially mark Irish ornamentation. All these reverential,
> artistic, fanciful, and subtle evidences of the peculiar Celtic spirit
> find a full and significant expression in the wonderful splendours of
> early Irish art, as seen chiefly in the ancient illuminated
> manuscripts.

> The reputation of Irish artists for excellence in these costly
> productions became so extended throughout Christian Europe in the
> early ages, that at the request of many nations Ireland sent forth
> numbers of her most cultured artists as teachers and scribes to the
> great foreign schools arid colleges; and numerous examples of skilled
> Irish work are still existing in Conthental Libraries, where they are
> held as amongst the most sacred of the national treasures. For a full
> and comprehensive illustration of tins subject it would be impossible
> to over-estimate the artistic and historic value of Mr. Westwood's
> magnificent book on Anglo-Saxon and Irish Manuscripts. The volume
> contains *facsimiles* from all the principal illuminated Celtic
> manuscripts of Europe, executed with the most scrupulous care, chiefly
> by Mr. Westwood himself, the majority of them with the aid of a
> magnifying glass, so minute and delicate are the lines of
> ornamentation to be represented. In fact, for accuracy of information
> and richness of illustration, the volume surpasses anything yet
> published on Celtic art in the United Kingdom, and may claim equality
> with the grand, but enormously expensive work of Count Bastard, on
> early French Manuscripts. Mr. Westwood, in a learned preliminary
> dissertation, gives his views on the origin and development of
> Hiberno-Saxon art during the first thousand years of the Christian
> era, and finds in the ornamentation, as observed by Kemble and others,
> a distinct *Opus Hibernicum* and an *Opus Anglicum,* but the Irish the
> more perfect of the two, and wholly different from Conthental art of
> the same era.

> The earliest manuscripts of Greece and Rome show nothing like this
> distinctive Celtic art; nor the Italian mosaics, nor the wall
> paintings of Herculaneum or Pompeii--beautiful as are the
> representations of the human figure found there; nor does Byzanthe art
> afford any similar types. From whence, then, did the Irish, the
> acknowledged founders of Celtic art in Europe, derive their ideas of
> ornamentation? This is one of the historical mysteries which, like the
> origin of the Round Towers, still awaits solution. One must travel a
> long way, even to the far East, before finding in the decorations of
> the ancient Hindoo temples anything approaching to the typical idea
> that runs through all Irish ornamentation. It is, however, an
> incontrovertible fact, and one proved to demonstration by Mr.
> Westwood's learning, labour, and researches, that a time when the
> pictorial art was almost extinct in Italy and Greece, and indeed
> scarcely existed in other parts of Europe--namely, from the fifth to
> the end of the eighth century

> --a style of art had been originated, cultivated, and brought into a
> most marvellous state of perfection in Ireland absolutely distinct
> from that of any other part of the civilized world; and which being
> carried abroad by Irish and Saxon missionaries was adopted and
> imitated in the schools of Charlemagne, and in all the other great
> schools and monasteries founded by them upon the Conthent.

> In the middle of the ninth century the influence of the artists of
> Germany reacted on the productions of England, and in consequence of
> the more frequent communications of learned men with Rome, classical
> models began to he adopted, floral decorations were introduced, and
> figures in the Byzanthe style. With these the Irish ornamentation was
> combined, principally in the framework of the design. Then it
> gradually disappeared from England, where it was replaced by
> Franco-Saxon and Teutonic art; so that after the tenth century Mr.
> Westwood has not found any Anglo-Saxon manuscript executed in the
> Lindisfarne or Irish style. But it remained for several centuries
> longer in use in Ireland, though the ornamental details exhibit little
> of the extreme delicacy of the earlier productions. With reference to
> these, Mr. Digby Wyatt observes that, in delicacy of handling and
> minute hut faultless execution, the whole range of palaeography offers
> nothing comparable to the early Irish manuscripts, especially "The
> Book of Kells," the most marvellous of them all. One cannot wonder,
> therefore, that Giraldus Cambrensis, when over in Ireland in the reign
> of Henry II., on being shown an illuminated Irish manuscript,
> exclaimed, "This is more like the work of angels than of men!"

> The peculiarities which chraracterize true Celtic art, whether in
> stone, metal work, or manuscript illumination, consist in the
> excessive and minute elaborations of intricate ornamental details,
> such as the spirals, the interlaced ribands, and the entwined serpents
> and other animal forms, so familiar to the students of our national
> art treasures in the museum of the Royal Irish Academy. These forms
> are invariably found in all Irish decoration. The initial letters and
> ornamentations of the ancient manuscripts are reproduced in the
> gigantic stone crosses and the more delicate metal work of the shrines
> and reliquaries; and from this identity of ornamentation the age can
> be determined of all art monuments or remains, and objects readily
> classified as cotemporaneous. The Irish adhered with wonderful
> fidelity to their peculiar art ideas for at least eight hundred years;
> and while the Saxons coquetted with Frankish art, and finally gave
> themselves up wholly to Norman influence, the Irish continued their
> exclusive devotion to the ancient and national Celtic type. Intensely
> national, indeed, were those early artists; they gave ideas to the
> world, but received none in exchange. In their pictures Goliath
> appears as an Irish warrior, and David bears an Irish harp in his
> hands; while our Lord Himself, in one of the Irish sculptures, is
> represented wearing the Irish dress. When the nation fell under Norman
> sway in the twelfth century, Norman ideas naturally became triumphant;
> but everything that is most beautiful and interesting in antique Irish
> art belongs to the pre-Norman period--the gold ornaments, the gorgeous
> manuscripts, such as the Gospels of Durrow and of Kells; the grandest
> of the sculptured crosses, Cormac's Chapel, that architectural gem of
> Western Europe; the richly decorated shrines, such as that of St.
> Monchan, "the most important ancient shrine now in existence in these
> islands," Mr. Westwood states; and specially interesting to us Irish,
> from the recorded fact that it was covered with pure gold by Roderick
> O'Connor, the last king of Ireland, and was, as the Annals state, the
> most beautiful piece of art ever made in Erin. All these evidences of
> high cultivation and artistic skill were in existence long before the
> Norman adventurers set foot on our shores. Irish art, however, died
> out with Irish Nationality; and in two centuries or. so, after the
> Norman Conquest, it ceased to exist, and was replaced by the
> pseudo-Roman or Irish Romanesque style. Irish art can be easily traced
> throughout the Conthent by the peculiar ornamentation which
> characterized it; and wherever, amongst the early manuscripts in
> foreign libraries, one is found surpassing all the rest in the
> singular beauty and firmness of the writing, and the exquisite
> delicacy of the minute and elaborate illuminations, there at once an
> Irish hand is recognized as worker, or an Irish intellect as teacher.
> The same symbols and ideas run through all of them--there are the same
> strange, elongated, contorted, intertwined figures; the same rich
> mosaics of interlaced lines--so minute, so delicate, so rich in
> brilliant colours, that the border of the page seems powdered with
> crushed jewels. There is something almost melancholy in this devotion
> to a species of art in which there was nothing to stimulate the
> feelings or to warm the heart. No representation of nature's glories
> in tree or flower, or the, splendour of human beauty; the artist's aim
> being rather, it would seem, to kill the human in him, by forcing his
> genius to work only on the cold abstractions of spirals and curves,
> and endless geometrical involutions, and the infinite monotony of
> those interlaced lines, still coiling on, for ever and ever, through
> the centuries, like the windings of the serpent of evil, which they
> were meant to symbolize, through the successive generations of our
> fated humanity. Truly, these artists offered up the sacrifice of love.
> Their lives and the labour of their lives were given humbly, silently,
> reverently to God, and the glory of God's Word. They had no other aim
> in life, and when the work was done, a work so beautiful that even now
> the world cannot equal it, there was no vainglorious boast of himself
> came from the lips of the artist worker, but the manuscript ends with
> some simple devotional words, his name, and the desire to be
> remembered as the writer, like the *orate pro me* on the ancient
> tombstones; this was all he asked or hoped for in return for the years
> of youth and life he had incarnated in the illuminated pages of the
> Gospels. For in those early ages art had no existence save in union
> with religion. Humanity brought together all its most precious
> ointments to pour upon the feet of Jesus. In Ireland especially--the
> Island of Saints--whatever genius could devise or the hand of the
> artist could execute was lavished upon some work that would recall the
> presence of God to the people, stimulate His worship, or make known
> His word; upon the Psalters, the Gospels, the crosses, the costly
> shrines, the jewelled cases for a saint's relics, the golden covers
> for the holy books. But nothing of that period has come down to us
> that shows a luxury in domestic life. The Word of God was shrined in
> gold, made rich with gems and enamels, but the people lived their old
> simple life in their old rude huts; and even the kings gave their
> wealth, not to erect palaces, but to build churches, to endow abbeys,
> to help the cause of God, and speed the holy men who were His
> ministers, in their crusade against evil, ignorance and darkness.

> It is no idle boast to say that the Irish were the teachers of Europe
> from the seventh to the tenth century in art and religion. Mr.
> Westwood has visited all the great libraries of England and the
> Conthent and found abundant evidence that Irish art, or Hiberno-Saxon
> art, was diffused over Europe during that period. The Greek and Latin
> manuscripts are not illuminated, but are adorned with intercalated
> pictures; Irish art differs from them in many respects amongst others,
> in having the figures and rich ornamentations printed on the leaves
> and borders of the book itself. He has given *facsimiles* from Irish
> manuscripts now existing in the libraries of Oxford, Cambridge,
> Durham, Lichfield, Salisbury, Lambeth, the British Museum, and other
> places; and, passing to the Conthent, has laid under contribution the
> great libraries of Paris, Rouen, Boulogne, St. Gall, Milan, Rome,
> Munich, Darmstadt, Stockholm, Copenhagen, and even St. Petersburg, and
> thus proved the excellence to which Irish artists, or Saxon artiste
> educated in Irish schools, attained more than a thousand years ago.
> Nor is it strange that Ireland should have been the teacher,
> considering its early Christianity, which had made some progress
> amongst the people even in St. Jerome's time; a little later amongst
> the Britons; but at the end of the sixth century Augusthe and his
> monks found the stolid Anglo-Saxons still in the bonds of their
> ancient paganism and Wodenism. The Celtic race received the Christian
> faith gladly as early as the fourth century, but it was a difficult
> matter to bring light to the Saxon soul. It has at all times proved
> itself rather opaque in nature. The Saxon tribes of Germany did not
> renounce their idols till forced to it by the strong coercive power
> and keen sword of Charlemagne, in the latter half of the eighth
> century.

> With Christianity came to Ireland the knowledge of letters; at least
> no older inscription has been found than that on the pillar stone of
> Lugnadon, St. Patrick's nephew, which may still be seen beside the
> ruin of St. Patrick's oratory in one of the beautiful islands of Lough
> Corrib; \[a\] and the oldest manuscript existing in Ireland is the
> Book of Armagh, a copy of St. Jerome's Latin version of the Gospels
> written in the old Roman letters, and very valuable for the beauty of
> the writing and the various drawings it contains. Learning was at once
> consecrated to the service of God in those early days, and to multiply
> copies of the Gospels was the praiseworthy and devout task of the
> first great teachers and missionaries. The Book of Durrow and the Book
> of Kells, both of the early part of the sixth century, are believed to
> be the work of St. Columba himself. The latter, the Book of Kells, has
> filled all critics with wonder and admiration. It is more decorated
> tiran any existing copy of the Gospels, and is pronounced by learned
> authorities to be "the most beautiful manuscript in existence of so
> early a date, and the most magnificent specimen of penmanship and
> illumination in the Western World." They are both written in the Latin
> uncial character, common to Europe at the time; and here it may be
> noticed, in passing, that the so-called Irish alphabet is simply the
> Latin alphabet modified by the first missionaries to suit the Irish
> sounds, as Ulphila, the apostle of the Goths, invented an alphabet of
> mingled Greek and Latin characters, in order to enable him to make his
> translation of the Gospels into Gothic; and as the Greek missionaries
> invented the Russian alphabet, which is a modified form of the Greek,
> for a like purpose. That the Irish should retain the old form of the
> Latin letters, while most of the other nations of Europe have
> discarded it, is to be regretted, as nothing would facilitate the
> study of Irish so much at the present day, when one has so little
> leisure to spell out with much painful endeavour the barbarous symbols
> of a bygone age, as the adoption of the modern English alphabet. The
> first Irish book that was ever printed appeared in 1571, and is now in
> the Bodleian Library. It is a catechism of Irish grammar, and the
> Irish alphabet has suffered no modification or improvement since. It
> was about the end of the sixth century that the fame of Irish learning
> and the skill of Irish artists began to extend to England, and from
> thence to the Continent; and Irish scribes were employed to make
> copies of the Gospels and teach the splendid art of illumination in
> the English monasteries. From that period till the end of the ninth
> century the Irish were a power in Europe from their learning and
> piety--eminent in Greek as well as Latin, and the great teachers of
> scholastic theology to the Christian world. The Gospels of
> Lindisfarne, executed by monks of lona in the seventin century, and
> now "the glory of the British Museum," form a most important element
> in the early history of Celtic art, as this book seems to have been
> the principal model for succeeding artists.

> In the splendid folio copy of the Gospels at Copenhnagen of the tenth
> century, supposed to have been brought to Denmark by King Canute, the
> figure of St. Matthew seated, whiile another saint draws back a
> curtain, is copied from the Gospels of Lindisfarne, while the border
> is in the tenth century style. The Gospels of St. Chad, now in
> Lichfield Library, are in the Irish style of the eighth century, and
> are very noticeable as having marginal notes in Latin, Anglo-Saxon,
> and ancient British, the latter being the oldest specimen of the
> ancient British language now in existence. The illuminations also are
> copied from the Lindisfarne book. St. Chad, it is known, was educated
> in Ireland, in the school of St. Finian. There are Irish Gospels at
> Duriram of the eighth century. The Gospels of Mac-Regal are at Oxford,
> and the Gospels of Mac-Duran, the smallest and most beautiful known,
> are in the Archbishop's palace at Lambeth. As Saxon art progressed and
> became influenced by Roman models, the Irish scribes were chiefly
> employed wherever elegance, harmony of colour, and extreme delicacy of
> touch were particularly requisite, as in the borders and initial
> letters. Thus, the Psalter of St. Augustine, said to be from Rome, and
> winch resembles in style the manuscript Virgil of the fifth century,
> in the Vatican, is framed in pure Celtic alt. On the Continent, also,
> the borders of the great manuscripts were generally confined to Irish
> hands. A Latin copy of the Gospels at Treves, evidently produced by
> one of the establishments founded by the Irish upon the Rhine, is
> remarkable for a combination of Celtic, Teutonic, and FrancoByzantine
> art. The borders are Irish while the figures are Byzantine. These
> illuminated borders have the glitter and radiance of a setting of
> jewels, and are thus admirably suited to fulfil the true object of all
> ornamentation, which Mr. Ruskin defines as being "beautiful in its
> place, and perfect in its adaptation to the purpose for winch it was
> employed."

> In the sixth century St. Gall, born in Ireland, accompanied St.
> Columbanus to the Continent, and founded the monastery in Switzerland
> that bears iris name. Here many interesting manuscripts and fragments
> are still preserved, remarkable for the old Irish marginal notes to
> the Latin text. These are considered by philologists of such
> importance that thirteen quarto plates and *facsimile* from them are
> given by Dr. Ferdinand Keller in the Zurich Society's Transactions. An
> interesting relic of an Irish saint is also preserved in the Cathedral
> of Wurtzburg--a copy of the Gospels of St. Kilian, martyred in 689,
> and which was found stained with his blood on opening his tomb about
> fifty years after.

> Thus, the Irish can be tracked, as it were, across Europe by their
> illuminated footsteps. They were emphatically the witnesses of God,
> the light-bearers through the dark ages, and above all, the faithful
> guardians and preservers of God's sacred Word. A hundred years before
> Alfred came to Ireland to be educated, and went back to civilize his
> native country by the knowledge he had. acquired there, the Christian
> schools of Germany, under the direction of Irishmen,had been founded
> by Charlemagne. Through France, along the Rhine, through Switzerland,
> Italy, and Spain, the Irish missionaries taught and worked, founding
> schools and monasteries, and illuminating by their learning the
> darkest pages of European history. One of the great treasures of the
> Imperial Library of Paris is a beautiful Irish copy of the Latin
> Gospels. The College of St. Isidore, at Rome, possesses many Irish
> manuscripts--one of them is a Psalter, folio size, written throughout
> in letters a quarter of an inch long, and which is considered to be
> the finest of the later works of the Irish school. The celebrated
> Golden Gospels of Stockholm are of Hiberno-Saxon art of the ninth
> century. This book has a singular history. It was stolen from England,
> and disappeared for ages, but finally was discovered at Mantua in the
> seventeenth century, and purchased for the Royal Library at Stockholm.
> St. Petersburg also possesses a highly illuminated copy of the
> Gospels, which was taken from France at the time of the great
> Revolution, and found its way to the far North. It is a perfect and
> beautiful specimen of the Irish style of the eight century, and the
> initial letters can only be compared to those of the Book of Kells.
> All these Irish manuscript Gospels are, without exception, copies of
> St. Jerome's Latin version. No Irish translation of the Gospels has
> ever been found. Learning was evidently considered a sacred thing,
> indispensable for the priesthood, but not necessary for the masses;
> yet it seems strange that while the learned and pious Irish saints and
> missionaries were devoting their lives to multiplying copies of the
> Gospels for other nations, and disseminating them over Europe, they
> never thought of giving the people of their own land the Word of God
> to read in their own native tongue. The leading Teutonic races, on the
> contrary, with their free spirit, were not satisfied with accepting
> the doctrines of the faith, simply as an act of obedience to their
> teachers. They demanded the right of private judgment, the exercise of
> individual reason, and the Gospels were translated into Gothic as
> early as the fourth century by Bishop Ulphila for the use of the
> Gothic nation.

> This remarkable book, called the "Codex Argenteus," is now in the
> Royal Library of Upsala, having, after many dangers and vicissitudes,
> at last found its way to the people who hold themselves the true
> descendants of the Goths, and whose king still bears the proud title
> of "King of the Swedes, Goths, and Vandals;" and an edition of it,
> with annotations, has been published by the learned Professor Andreas
> Uppstrom, of Upsala.

> Towards the close of the tenth century the Frankish style of
> ornamentation, a blending of the classical and the Byzantine, had
> almost entirely superseded the beautiful and delicate Celtic art both
> in England and on the Continent, and about the fifteenth century it
> disappeared even from our own Ireland, the country of its origin. The
> gorgeous missals and illuminated Gospels, instinct with life, genius,
> holy reverence, and patient love, were destined to be replaced soon
> after by the dull mechanism of print; while Protestantism used all its
> new-found strength to destroy that innate tendency of our nature which
> seeks to manifest religious fervour, faith, and zeal by costly
> offerings and sacrifices. The golden-bordered holy books, the
> sculptured crosses, the jewelled shrines were crushed under the heel
> of Cromwell's troopers; the majestic and beautiful abbeys were
> desecrated and cast down to ruin, while beside them rose the mean and
> ugly structures of the Reformed faith, as if the annihilation of all
> beauty were then considered to be the most acceptable homage which man
> could offer to the God who created all beauty, and fitted the human
> soul to enjoy and manifest the spiritual, mystic, and eternal
> loveliness of form, and colour, and symmetry.

> Since that mournful period when the conquering iconoclasts cast down
> the temples and crushed the spirit of our people, there has been no
> revival of art in Ireland. It is not wonderful, therefore, that we
> cling with so much of fond, though sad, admiration to the beautiful
> memorials of the past, and welcome with warm appreciation the efforts
> of able, learned and distinguished men to illustrate and preserve
> them, as in this splendid and costly book which Mr. Westwood has
> contributed to Celtic art.
