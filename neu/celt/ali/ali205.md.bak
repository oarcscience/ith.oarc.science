St. Seenan's Well

> THERE is a place on the shore of Scattery Island, where, according to
> the most ancient tradition, a sacred well once existed, with
> miraculous curative powers. But no one could ever discover the place,
> for at high water the sea covered every point up to the edge of the
> land, and the shifting sand made all efforts to find the locality of
> the well vain and fruitless.

> But one day a young man who was lame in both legs from the effects of
> a fall, and much disabled in consequence, was going aIong the shore
> with some companions, when he suddenly sank up to his waist in the
> sand. With much difficulty, and after a long while, his comrades
> managed to haul him up, when to their amazement they found that his
> legs were now quite straight, and he stood up before them four inches
> taller than before he sank down into the sand.

> So at once they knew that the sacred well must have worked the cure,
> and they dug and dug and cleared away the sand, till at last they came
> on some ancient steps, and down below lay the well, clear and fresh,
> and untouched by the salt of the sea, the holy well of St. Seenan,
> that their fathers and forefathers had vainly looked for.

> Now there was great rejoicing in the country when the news spread; and
> all the people from far and near who had pains and ailments rushed off
> to the well and drank of the waters and poured libations of it over
> their persons, wherever the pain or the disease lay, and in a short
> time wonderful cures were effected. So next day still greater crowds
> arrived to try their good luck. But when they came to the place, not a
> vestige of the well could be found. The sand and the sea had covered
> all, and from that day to this the holy well of St. Seenan has never
> been seen by mortal eyes.
