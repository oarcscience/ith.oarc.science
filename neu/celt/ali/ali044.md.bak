Fairy Wiles

> WHEN the fairies steal away a beautiful mortal child they leave an
> ugly, wizened little creature in its place. And these fairy
> changelings grow up malicious and wicked, and have voracious
> appetites. The unhappy parents often try the test of fire for the
> child, in this wise--placing it in the centre of the cabin, they light
> a fire round it, and fully expect to see it changed into a sod of
> turf. But if the child survives the ordeal it is accepted as one of
> the family, though very grudgingly; and it is generally hated by all
> the neighbours for its impish ways. But the children of the Sidhe and
> a mortal mother are always clever and beautiful, and specially excel
> in music and dancing. They are, however, passionate and willful, and
> have strange, moody fits, when they desire solitude above all things,
> and seem to hold converse with unseen spiritual beings.

>  Fine young peasant women are often carried off by the fairies to
> nurse their little fairy progeny. But the woman is allowed to come
> back to her own infant after sunset. however, on entering the house,
> the husband must at once throw holy water over her in the name of God,
> when she will be restored to her own shape. For sometimes she comes
> with a hissing noise like a serpent; then she appears black, and
> shrouded like one from the dead; and, lastly, in her own shape, when
> she takes her old place by the fire and nurses her baby; and the
> husband must ask no questions, but give her food in silence. If she
> falls asleep the third night, all will be well, for the husband at
> once ties a red thread across the door to prevent the fairies coming
> in to carry her off, and if the third night passes over safely the
> fairies have lost their power over her for evermore.
