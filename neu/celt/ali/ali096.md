The Wren

> The wren is mortally hated by the Irish; for on one occasion, when the
> Irish troops were approaching to attack a portion of Cromwell's army,
> the wrens came and perched on the Irish drums, and by their tapping
> and noise aroused the English soldiers, who fell on the Irish troops
> and killed them all. So ever since the Irish hunt the wren on St.
> Stephen's Day, and teach their children to run it through with thorns
> and kill it whenever it can be caught. A dead wren was also tied to a
> pole and carried from house to house by boys, who demanded money; if
> nothing was given the wren was buried on the door-step, which was
> considered a great insult to the family and a degradation.
