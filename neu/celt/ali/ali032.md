Kathleen

> A young girl from Innis-Sark had a lover, a fine young fellow, who met
> his death by an accident, to her great grief and sorrow.

> One evening at sunset, as she sat by the roadside. crying her eyes
> out, a beautiful lady came by all in white, and tapped her on the
> cheek.

> "Don't cry, Kathleen," she said, "your lover is safe. Just take this
> ring of herbs and look through it and you will see him. He is with a
> grand company, and wears a golden circlet on his head and a scarlet
> sash round his waist."

> So Kathleen took the ring of herbs and looked through it, and there
> indeed was her lover in the midst of a great company dancing on the
> hill; and he was very pale, but handsomer than ever, with the gold
> circlet round his head, as if they had made him a prince.

> "Now," said the lady, "here is a larger ring of herbs. Take it, and
> whenever you want to see your lover, pluck a leaf from it and burn it;
> and a great smoke will arise, and you will fall into a trance; and in
> the trance your lover will carry you away to the fairy rath, and there
> you may dance all night with him on the greensward. But say no prayer,
> and make no sign of the cross while the smoke is rising, or your lover
> will disappear for ever."

> From that time a great change came over Kathleen. She said no prayer,
> and cared for no priest, and never made the sign of the cross, but
> every night shut herself up in her room, and burned a leaf of the ring
> of herbs as she had been told; and when the smoke arose she fell into
> a deep sleep and knew no more. But in the morning she told her people
> that, though she seemed to be lying in her bed, she was far away with
> the fairies on the hill dancing with her lover. And she was very happy
> in her new life, and wanted no priest nor prayer nor mass any more,
> and all the dead were there dancing with the rest, all the people she
> had known; and they welcomed her and gave her wine to drink in little
> crystal cups, and told her she must soon come and stay with them and
> with her lover for evermore.

> Now Kathleen's mother was a good, honest, religious woman, and she
> fretted much over her daughter's strange state, for she knew the girl
> had been fairy-struck. So she determined to watch; and one night when
> Kathleen went to her bed as usual all alone by herself in the room,
> for she would allow no one to be with her, the mother crept up and
> looked through a chink in the door, and then she saw Kathleen take the
> round ring of herbs from a secret place in the press and pluck a leaf
> from it and burn it, on which a great smoke arose and the girl fell on
> her bed in a deep trance.

> Now the mother could no longer keep silence, for she saw there was
> devil's work in it; and she fell on her knees and prayed aloud--

> "O Maia, mother, send the evil spirit away from the child!" And she
> rushed into the room and made the sign of the cross over the sleeping
> girl, when immediately Kathleen started up and screamed--

> "Mother! mother! the dead are coming for me. They are here! they are
> here!"

> And her features looked like one in a fit. Then the poor mother sent
> for the priest, who came at once, and threw holy water on the girl,
> and said prayers over her; and he took the ring of herbs that lay
> beside her and cursed it for evermore, and instantly it fell to powder
> and lay like grey ashes on the floor. After this Kathleen grew calmer,
> and the evil spirit seemed to have left her, but she was too weak to
> move or to speak, or to utter a prayer, and before the clock struck
> twelve that night she lay dead.
