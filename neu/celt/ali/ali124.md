For the Red Rash

> "Who will heal me from the red, thirsty, shivering cold disease that
> came from the foreigner, and kills people with its poisonous pain?"
> "The prayer of Mary to her Son, the prayer of Columbkill to God; these
> will heal thee. AMEN."

> Another.

> Say this oration three times over the patient, making the sign of the
> cross each time--

> "Bridget, Patrick, Solomon, and the great Mary, banish this redness
> off you."

> Then take butter, breathe on it quite close, and give it to the person
> to chafe himself therewith.

> To ascertain if he will recover, put a handful of yarrow in his hand
> while he is sleeping; if it is withered in the morning he will die;
> but if it remains fresh the disease will leave him.
