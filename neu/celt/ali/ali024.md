The Child's Dream

> THE island of Innis-Sark (Shark Island) was a holy and peaceful place
> in old times; and so quiet that the pigeons used to come and build in
> a great cave by the sea, and no one disturbed them. And the holy
> saints of God had a monastery there, to which many people resorted
> from the mainland, for the prayers of the monks were powerful against
> sickness or evil, or the malice of an enemy.

> Amongst others, there came a great and noble prince out of Munster,
> with his wife and children and their nurse; and they were so pleased
> with the island that they remained a year or more; for the prince
> loved fishing, and often brought his wife along with him.

> One day, while they were both away, the eldest child, a beautiful boy
> of ten years old, begged his nurse to let him go amid see the pigeons'
> cave, but she refused.

> "Your father would be angry," she cried, "if you went without leave.
> Wait till he comes home, and see if he will allow you."

> So when the prince returned, the boy told him how he longed to see the
> cave, and the father promised to bring him next day.

> The morning was beautiful and the wind fair when they set off. But the
> child soon fell asleep in the boat, and never wakened all the time his
> father was fishing. The sleep, however, was troubled, and many a time
> he started and cried aloud. So the prince thought it better to turn
> the boat and land, and then' the boy awoke.

> After dinner the father called for the child. "Tell me now," he said,
> "why was your sleep troubled, so that you cried out bitterly in your
> dream."

> "I dreamed," said the boy, "that I stood upon a high rock, and at the
> bottom flowed the sea, but the waves made no noise; and as I looked
> down I saw fields and trees and beautiful flowers and bright birds in
> the branches, and I longed to go down and pluck the flowers. Then I
> heard a voice, saying, 'Blessed are the souls that come here, for this
> is heaven.'

> "And in an instant I thought I was in the midst of the meadows amongst
> the birds and the flowers; and a lovely lady, bright as an angel, came
> up to me, and said, 'What brings you here, dear child; for none but
> the dead come here.'

> "Then she left me, and I wept for her going; when suddenly all the sky
> grew black, and a great troop of wild wolves came round me, howling
> and opening their mouths wide as if to devour me. And I screamed, and
> tried to run, but I could not move, a the wolves came closer, and I
> fell down like one dead with fright when, just then, the beautiful
> lady came again, and took my hand and kissed me.

> "'Fear not,' she said, 'take these flowers, they come from heaven. And
> I will bring you to the meadow where they grow.'

> "And she lifted me up into the air, but I know nothing more; for then
> the boat stopped and you lifted me on shore, but my beautiful flowers
> must have fallen from my hands, for I never saw them more. And this is
> all my dream; but I would like to have my flowers again, for the lady
> told me they had the secret that would bring me to heaven."

> The prince thought no more of the child's dream, but went off to fish
> next day as usual, leaving the boy in the care of his nurse. And again
> the child begged and prayed her so earnestly to bring him to the
> pigeons' cave, that at last she consented; but told him he must not go
> a step by himself, and she would bring two of the boys of the island
> to take care of him.

> So they set off, the child and his little sister with the nurse. And
> the boy gathered wild flowers for his sister, and ran down to the edge
> of the cave where the cormorants were swimming; but there was no
> danger, for the two young islanders were minding him.

> So the nurse was content, and being weary she fell asleep. And the
> little sister lay down beside her, and fell asleep likewise.

> Then the boy called to his companions, the two young islanders, and
> told them he must catch the cormorants. So away they ran, down the
> path to the sea, hand in hand, and laughing as they went. Just then a
> piece of rock loosened and fell beside them, and trying to avoid it
> they slipped over the edge of the narrow path down a steep place,
> where there was nothing to hold on by except a large bush, in the
> middle of the way. They got hold of this, and thought they were now
> quite safe, but the bush was not strong enough to bear their weight,
> and it was torn up by the roots. And all three fell straight down into
> the sea and were drowned.

> Now, at the sound of the great cry that came up from the waves, the
> nurse awoke, but saw no one. Then she woke up the little sister. "It
> is late," she cried, "they must have gone home. We have slept too
> long, it is already evening; let us hasten and overtake them, before
> the prince is back from the fishing."

> But when they reached home the prince stood in the doorway. And he was
> very pale, and weeping.

> "Where is my brother?" cried the little girl.

> "You will never see your brother more," answered the prince. And from
> that day he never went fishing any more, but grew silent and
> thoughtful, and was never seen to smile. And in a short the he and his
> family quitted the island, never to return.

> But the nurse remained. And some say she became a saint, for she was
> always seen praying and weeping by the entrance to the great sea cave.
> And one day, when they came to look for her, she lay dead on the
> rocks. And in her hand she held some beautiful strange flowers freshly
> gathered, with the dew on them. And no one knew how the flowers came
> into her dead hand. Only some fishermen told the story of how the
> night before they had seen a bright fairy child seated on the rocks
> singing; and he had a red sash tied round his waist, and a golden
> circlet binding his long yellow hair. And they all knew that he was
> the prince's son, who had been drowned in that spot just a twelvemonth
> before. And the people believe that he had brought the flowers from
> the spirit-land to the woman, and given them to her as a death sign,
> and a blessed token from God that her soul would be taken to heaven.
