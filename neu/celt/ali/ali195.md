The Farmer's Fate

> THE peasants have the greatest dread of the fairy-stroke, and consider
> it the most dangerous indication of fairy hostility. When a person is
> struck, he becomes wholly insensible to external things, as if his
> soul had been taken Out of him and carried away.

> A farmer once began to build a barn on a fairy circle, to the great
> horror of the neighbours, who warned him of the danger; but he only
> laughed at their nonsense, and built and finished his barn on the
> fairy rath.

> However, riding home one evening after sunset, he was suddenly
> "struck," and fell insensible to the ground. They carried him home and
> laid him on his bed, where he lay for several days, his eyes fixed and
> staring without any motion of the eyelids, and no indication of life
> remaining, except his colour, which never changed.

> All the doctors came and looked at him, but could do nothing. There
> was no fracture nor injury of any kind to his frame; so the doctors
> shook their heads and went their way, saying they would call again in
> a day or two. But. the family objected to delay, and sent at once for
> the great fairy doctor of the district. The moment he came he threw
> herbs on the fire, when a fragrant smell filled the room like church
> incense. Then he pounded some herbs and mixed a liquid with them, but
> what the herbs were, no one knew. And with this mixture he touched the
> brow and the lips and the hands of the man, and sprinkled the rest
> over his insensible form. After this he told them to keep silence
> round him for two hours, when he would return and finish the cure. And
> so it happened, for in two hours the life came back to the man, though
> he could not speak. But strength came gradually; and by the next day
> he rose up, and said he had dreamed a dream, and heard a voice saying
> to him, "Pull down the barn, for ill-luck is on it." Accordingly he
> gave orders to his men, and every stick and stone was carried away,
> and the fairy rath left free again for the fairies to dance on, as in
> the olden time, when they were the gods of the earth, long before men
> came to dispute their rights, and take possession of their ancient
> pleasure grounds--an indignity no high-spirited fairy could calmly
> endure. For in their councils they had decreed that the fairy rath, at
> least, should be sacred for all time, and woe to the man who builds
> his house thereon. An evil fate is on him and on the house for
> evermore. Down it must come, or the evil spell will never be lifted.
> There is no hope for it, for the most dangerous and subtle of all
> enemies is an angry fairy.

> Nor should the paths even be crossed by work of human hand, which the
> fairies traverse from one palace to another. Their line of march must
> not be impeded. Finvarra and his men would resent such a gross insult
> to the royal fairy rights, and severely punish audacious and offending
> mortal. Not even the Grand Jury would be allowed to interfere, for if
> they did, every man of them would be demolished in some way or other
> by fairy power.
