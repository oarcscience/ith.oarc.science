Against Enemies

> Three things are of the Evil One--

> An evil eye;  
> An evil tongue;  
> An evil mind.

> Three things are of God; and these three are what Mary told to her
> Son, for she heard them in heaven--

> The merciful word;  
> The singing word;  
> And the good word.

> May the power of these three holy things be on all the men and women
> of Erin for evermore.
