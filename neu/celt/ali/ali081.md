Concerning Dogs

> SOME very weird superstitions exist in Ireland concerning the howlings
> of dogs. It a dog is heard to howl near the house of a sick person,
> all hope of his recovery is given up, and the patient himself sinks
> into despair, knowing that his doom is sealed. But the Irish are not
> alone in holding this superstition. The Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks,
> and Romans all looked on the howling of the dog as ominous. The very
> word *howling* may be traced in the Latin *ululu,* the Greek
> *holuluzo,* the hebrew *hululue,* and the Irish *ulluloo.* In Ireland
> the cry raised at the funeral ceremony was called the *Caoin,* or
> keen, probably from *χυων,* a dog. And this doleful lamentation was
> also common to other nations of antiquity. The Hebrews, Greeks, amid
> Romans had their hired mourners, who, with dishevelled hair and
> mournful cadenced hymns, led on the melancholy parade of death. Thus
> the Trojan women keened over Hector, the chorus being led by the
> beautiful Helen herself.

> The howling of the dog was considered by these nations as the first
> note of the funeral dirge and the signal that the coming of death was
> near.

> But the origin of the superstition may be traced back to Egypt, where
> dogs and dog-faced gods were objects of worship; probably because
> Sirius, the Dog-star, appeared precisely before the rising of the
> Nile, amid thereby gave the people a mystic and supernatural warning
> to prepare for the overflow.

> The Romans held that the howling of dogs was a fatal presage of evil,
> and it is noted amongst the direful omens that preceded the death of
> Caesar. Horace also says that Canidia by her spells and sorceries
> could bring ghosts of dogs from hell; and Virgil makes the dog to howl
> at the approach of Hecate.

> It is remarkable that when dogs see spirits (and they are keenly
> sensitive to spirit influence) they never bark, but only growl. The
> Rabbins say that "when the Angel of Death enters a city the dogs do
> howl. But when Elias appears then the dogs rejoice and are merry." And
> Rabbi Jehuda the Just states, that once upon a the when the Angel of
> Death entered a house the dog howled and fled; but being presently
> brought back he lay down in fear and trembling, and so died.

> This strange superstition concerning the howling of dogs, when, as is
> supposed, they are conscious of the approach of the Spirit of Death,
> and see him though he is shrouded and invisible to human eyes, may be
> found pervading the legends of all nations from the earliest period
> down to the present the; for it still exists in full force amongst all
> classes, the educated, as well as the unlettered peasantry; and to
> this day the howling of a dog where a sick person is lying is regarded
> in Ireland in all grades of society with pale dismay as a certain sign
> of approaching death.

> The Irish may have obtained the superstition through Egypt, Phoenicia,
> or Greece, for it is the opinion of some erudite writers that the
> Irish wolf-dog *(Canis gracius Hibernicus)* was descended from the
> dogs of Greece.

> It is strange and noteworthy that although the dog is so faithful to
> man, yet it is never mentioned in the Bible without an expression of
> contempt; and Moses in his code of laws makes the dog an unclean
> animal, probably to deter the Israelites from the Egyptian worship of
> this animal. It was the lowest term of offence--" Is thy servant a
> dog?" False teachers, persecutors, Gentiles, unholy men, and others
> sunk in sin and vileness were called dogs; while at the same the
> strange prophetic power of these animals was universally acknowledged
> and recognized.

> The Romans sacrificed a dog at the Lupercalia in February. And to meet
> a dog with her whelps was considered in the highest degree unlucky. Of
> all living creatures the name of "dog" applied to any one expressed
> the lowest form of insult, contempt, and reproach. Yet, of all
> animals, the dog has the noblest qualities, the highest intelligence,
> and the most enduring affection for man.

> The Irish wolf-dog had a lithe body, a slender head, and was fleet as
> the wind. The form of the animal is produced constantly in Irish
> ornamentation, but the body always terminates in endless twisted
> convolutions. The great Fionn MaCoul had a celebrated dog called
> "Bran," who is thus described in the bardic legends: "A ferocious,
> small-headed, white-breasted, sleek-haunched hound; having the eyes of
> a dragon, the claws of a wolf, the vigour of a lion, and the venom of
> a serpent."

> In the same poem Fionn himself is described in highly ornate bardic
> language, as he leads the hound by a chain of silver attached to a
> collar of gold: "A noble, handsome, fair-featured Fenian prince;
> young, courteous, manly, puissant; powerful in action; the tallest of
> the warriors; the strongest of the champions; the most beautiful of
> the human race."

> Bran, like his master, was gifted in a remarkable degree with the
> foreknowledge of evil, and thus he was enabled to give his young lord
> many warnings to keep him from danger.

> Once, when victory was not for the Fenian host, Bran showed the
> deepest sorrow.

> "He came to Fionn, wet and weary, and by this hand," says the
> chronicler, "his appearance was pitiful. He lay down before the chief,
> and cried bitterly and howled.

> " ''Tis likely, my dog,' saith Fionn, 'that our heads are in great
> danger this day.'"

> Another time, the Fenian host having killed a huge boar, Ossian, the
> bard and prophet, ordered it to be burnt as of demon race. Bran,
> hearing this, went out readily and knowingly, and he brings in three
> trees in his paw; no one knew from whence; but the trees were put into
> the fire and the great pig was burnt, and the ashes of the beast were
> cast into the sea.

> The Fenian princes generally went to the hunt accompanied altogether
> by about three thousand hounds; Bran leading, the wisest and fleetest
> of all. The chiefs formed a goodly army, a thousand knights or
> more--each wearing a silken shirt and a *chotan* of fine silk, a green
> mantle and fine purple cloak over to protect it; a golden diademed
> helmet on the head, and a javelin in each man's hand.

> Once, a chief, being jealous of the splendour of the Fenian princes,
> became their bitter enemy, and set himself to curse Bran above all
> hounds in the land.

> But Fionn answered, "If thou shouldest curse Bran, my wise,
> intelligent dog, not a room east or west in thy great mansion but I
> will burn with fire."

> So Bran rested on the mountain with Fionn, his lord and master, and
> was safe from harm.

> Yet, so fate decreed, Bran finally met his death by means of a woman.
> One day a snow-white hart, with hoofs that shone like gold, was
> scented on the hill, and all the hounds pursued, Bran leading. hour
> after hour passed by, and still the hart fled on, the hounds
> following, till one by one they all dropped off from weariness, and
> not one was left save Bran. Then the hart headed for the lake, and
> reaching a high cliff, she plunged from it straight down into the
> water; the noble hound leaped in at once after her, and seized the
> hart as she rose to the surface; but at that instant she changed into
> the form of a beautiful lady, and laying her hand upon the head of
> Bran, she drew him down beneath the water, and the beautiful lady and
> Fionn's splendid hound disappeared together and were seen no more. But
> in memory of the event the cliff from which he leaped is called
> Coegg-y-Bran; while the lake and the castle beside it are called
> *Tiernach Bran* (the lordship of Bran) to this day. So the name and
> memory of Fionn's hound, and his wisdom and achievements are not
> forgotten by the people; and many dogs of the chase are still called
> after him, for the name is thought to bring luck to the hunter and
> sportsman. But the *C'ailleach Biorar* (the Hag of the Water) is held
> in much dread, for it is believed that she still lives in a cave on
> the hill, and is ready to work her evil spells whenever opportunity
> offers, and her house is shown under the cairn, also the beaten path
> she traversed to the lake. Many efforts have been made to drain the
> lake, but the Druid priestess, the hag of the Water, always
> interferes, and casts some spell to prevent the completion of the
> work. The water of the lake has, it is said, the singular property of
> turning the hair a silvery white; and the great Fionn having once
> bathed therein, he emerged a withered old man, and was only restored
> to youth by means of strong spells and incantations.

> In Cormac's Glossary there is an interesting account of how the first
> lapdog came into Ireland, for the men of Britain were under strict
> orders that no lapdog should be given to the Gael, either of
> solicitation or of free will, for gratitude or friendship.

> Now it- happened that Cairbré Musc went to visit a friend of his in
> Britain, who made him right welcome and offered him everything he
> possessed, save only his lapdog, for that was forbidden by the law.
> Yet this beautiful lapdog was the one only possession that Cairbré
> coveted, and he laid his plans cunningly to obtain it.

> There was a law at that the in Britain to this effect: "Every criminal
> shall be given as a forfeit for his crime to the person he has
> injured."

> Now Cairbré had a wonderful dagger, around the haft of which was an
> adornment of silver and gold. It was a precious jewel, and he took fat
> meat and rubbed it all over the haft, with much grease. Then he set it
> before the lapdog, who began to gnaw at the haft, and continued
> gnawing all night till the morning, so that the haft was spoiled and
> was no longer beautiful.

> Then on the morrow, Cairbró made complaint that his beautiful dagger
> was destroyed, and he demanded a just recompense.

> "That is indeed fair," said his friend, "I shall pay a price for the
> trespass."

> "I ask no other price," said Cairbré, "than what the law of Britain
> allows me, namely, the criminal for his crime."

> So the lapdog was given to Cairbré, and it was called ever after
> *Mug-Eimé,* the slave of the haft, which name clung to it because it
> passed into servitude as a forfeit for the trespass.

> Now when Cairbré brought it back to Erin with him, all the kings of
> Ireland began to wrangle and contend for possession of the lapdog, and
> the contention at last ended in this wise--it was agreed that the dog
> should abide for a certain the in the house of each king. Afterwards
> the dog littered, and each of them had a pup of the litter, amid from
> this stock descends every lapdog in Ireland from that time till now.

> After a long while the lapdog died, and the bare skull being brought
> to the blind poet Maer to try his power of divination, he at once
> exclaimed, through the prophetic power and vision in him, "O Mug-Eimé!
> this is indeed the head of Mug-Eimé, the slave of the haft, that was
> brought into Ireland and given over to the fate of a bondsman, and to
> the punishment of servitude as a forfeit."

> The word hound entered into many combinations as a name for various
> animals. Thus the rabbit was called, "the hound of the brake;" the
> hare was the "brown hound;" the moth was called "the hound of fur,"
> owing to the voracity with which it- devoured raiment. And the otter
> is still called by the Irish *Madradh-Uisgue* (the dog of the water).

> The names of most creatures of the animal kingdom were primitive, the
> result evidently of observation. Thus the hedgehog was named "the ugly
> little fellow." The ant was the "slender one." The trout, *Breac,* or
> "the spotted," from the skin. And the wren was called "the Druid
> bird," because if any one understood the chirrup, they would have a
> knowledge of coming events as foretold by the bird.
