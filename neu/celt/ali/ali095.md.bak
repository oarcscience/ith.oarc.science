The Magpie

> There is no Irish name for the Magpie. It is generally called
> *Francagh,* a Frenchman, though no one knows why. Many queer tales are
> narrated of this bird, arising from its quaint ways, its adroit
> cunning and habits of petty larceny. Its influence is not considered
> evil, though to meet one alone in the morning when going a journey is
> an ill omen, but to meet more than one magpie betokens good fortune,
> according to the old rhyme which runs thus--

> "One for Sorrow,  
> Two for Mirth,  
> Three for Marriage,  
> Four for a Birth."
