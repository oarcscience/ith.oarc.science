Scenes at a Holy Well

> SCENES of holy faith, of tender love, and human pity are, however,
> happily more frequent amongst the devotees at the holy wells of
> Ireland than the fierce mutterings of malediction. At these sacred
> places may be seen the mother praying for her child, the girl for her
> lover, the wife for her husband; going the rounds on their bare knees,
> with the crucifix in their clasped hands and their eyes raised to
> heaven in silent prayer, with a divine faith that this prayer will be
> answered; and who can say but that the fervour of the supplication has
> often brought down the blessing of healing for the sick, or comfort
> for the sorrowing? The picturesque grouping round the holy well, the
> background of purple mountains, the antique stone cross at which the
> pilgrims kneel, the costumes and often the beautiful faces of the
> praying women, with their long dark hair and purple Irish eyes, form a
> scene of wonderful poetic and dramatic interest, which has been
> immortalized by Sir Frederick Burton in his great national picture,
> *The Blind Girl at the Holy Well--*a work that at once made the young
> painter famous, and laid the foundation of the subsequent career of
> this distinguished and perfect artist.
