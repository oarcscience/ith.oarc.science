For the Evil Eye

> This is a charm Mary gave to St. Bridget, and she wrote it down, and
> hid it in the hair of her head, without deceit--

> "If a fairy, or a man, or a woman hath overlooked thee, there are
> three greater in heaven who will cast all evil from thee into the
> great and terrible sea. Pray to them, and to the seven angels of God,
> and they will watch over thee. AMEN."
