The Holy Well and the Murderer

> THE Well of St. Brendan, in High Island, has great virtue, but the
> miraculous power of the water is lost should a thief or a murderer
> drink of it. Now a cruel murder had been committed on the mainland,
> and the priest noticed the people that if the murderer tried to
> conceal himself in the island no one should harbour him or give him
> food or drink. It happened at that the there was a woman of the island
> afflicted with pains in her limbs, and she went to the Holy Well to
> make the stations and say the prayers, and so get cured. But many a
> day passed and still she got no better, though she went round and
> round the well on her knees, and recited the paters and aves as she
> was told.

> Then she went to the priest and told him the story, and he perceived
> at once that the well had been polluted by the touch of some one who
> had committed a crime. So he bade the woman bring him a bottle of the
> water, and she did as he desired. Then having received the water, he
> poured it out, and breathed on it three times in the name of the
> Trinity; when, lo! the water turned into blood.

> "Here is the evil," cried the priest. "A murderer has washed his hands
> in the well."

> He then ordered her to make a fire in a circle, which she did, and he
> pronounced some words over it; and a mist rose up with the form of a
> spirit in the midst, holding a man by the arm.

> "Behold the murderer," said the spirit; and when the woman looked on
> him she shrieked--"It is my son! my son!" and she fainted.

> For the year before her son had gone to live on the mainland, and
> there, unknown to his mother, he had committed the dreadful murder for
> which the vengeance of God lay on him. And when she came to herself
> the spirit of the murderer was still there.

> "Oh, my Lord! let him go, let him go! "she cried.

> "You wretched woman!" answered the priest. "How dare you interpose
> between God and vengeance. This is but the shadowy form of your son;
> but before night he shall be in the hands of the law, and justice
> shall be done."

> Then the forms and the mist melted away, and the woman departed in
> tears, and not long after she died of a broken heart.

> But the well from that time regained all its miraculous powers, and
> the fame of its cures spread far and wide through all the islands.
