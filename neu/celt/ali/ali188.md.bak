Relics for Clearing from Guilt

> Another relic held in reverence for swearing on by an accused person
> is St. Finian's Dish. This was found about one hundred and fifty years
> ago, buried in the ruins of an old abbey. It is of silver with stones
> set in it, which, the people say, are the eyes of Christ looking at
> them while they swear. And when the dish is shaken a rattling noise is
> heard, which they believe is made by the Virgin Mary s bones that are
> enclosed therein.

> Should a false oath be taken on the relic, the perjurer will at once
> be stricken by disease, and die before the year is out. And so great
> is the terror inspired by this belief, that men have fainted from fear
> when brought up to swear on it. This is done by placing the hand on
> the cross that is engraved in the centre of the dish, while the two
> eyes of Christ are fixed on the swearer who comes for clearance from
> guilt.

> The *Ghar-Barra,* or Crosier of St. Barry, is also a holy relic once
> overlaid with gold, on which it was the custom to take a clearing
> oath; as the people held it in great reverence, and, nothing was more
> dreaded than the consequence of a false oath on the *GharBarra.* Once
> a man who swore falsely thereon had his mouth turned awry, and it so
> remained to his life's end, a proof of the saint's hatred for the sin
> of perjury. The relic is kept covered carefully with green cloth, and
> whoever is brought to take a clearing oath thereon must first lay down
> a small piece of silver for the guardian of the shrine.
