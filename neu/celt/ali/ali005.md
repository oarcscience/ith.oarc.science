A Wolf Story

> TRANSFORMATION into wolves is a favourite subject of Irish legend,
> and, many a wild tale is told by the peasants round the turf fire in
> the winter nights of strange adventures with wolves. Stories that had
> come down to them from their forefathers in the old times long ago;
> for there are no wolves existing now in Ireland. A young farmer, named
> Connor, once missed two fine cows from his herd, and no tale or
> tidings could be heard of them anywhere. So he thought he would set
> out on a search throughout the country; and he took a stout blackthorn
> stick in his hand, and went his way. All day he travelled miles and
> miles, but never a sign of the cattle. And the evening began to grow
> very dark, and he was wearied and hungry, and no place near to rest
> in; for he was in the midst of a bleak, desolate heath, with never a
> habitation at all in sight, except a long, low, rude shieling, like
> the den of a robber or a wild beast. But a gleam of light came from a
> chink between the boards, and Connor took heart and went up and
> knocked at the door. It was opened fit once by a tall, thin,
> grey-haired old man, with keen, dark eyes.

> "Come in," he said, "you are welcome. 'We have been waiting for you.
> This is my wife," and he brought him over to the hearth, where was
> seated an old, thin, grey woman, with long, sharp teeth and terrible
> glittering eyes.

> "You are welcome," she said. "We have been waiting for you--it is time
> for supper. Sit down and eat with us."

> Now Connor was a brave fellow, but he was a little dazed at first at
> the sight of this strange creature. However, as he had his stout stick
> with him, he thought he could make a fight for his life any way, and,
> meantime, he would rest and eat, for he was both hungry and weary, and
> it was now black night, and he would never find his way home even if
> he tried. So he sat down by the hearth, while the old grey woman
> stirred the pot on the fire. But Connor felt that she was watching him
> all the time with her keen, sharp eyes.

> Then a knock came to the door. And the old man rose up and opened it.
> When in walked a slender, young black wolf, who immediately went
> straight across the floor to an inner room, from which in a few
> moments came forth a dark, slender, handsome youth, who took his place
> at the table and looked hard at Connor with his glittering eyes.

> "You are welcome," he said, "we have waited for you."

> Before Connor could answer another knock was heard, and in came a
> second wolf, who passed on to the inner room like the first, and soon
> after, another dark, handsome youth came out and sat down to supper
> with them, glaring at Connor with his keen eyes, but said no word.

> "These are our Sons," said the old man, "tell them what you want, and
> what brought you here amongst us, for we live alone and don't care to
> have spies and strangers coming to our place."

> Then Connor told his story, bow he had lost his two fine cows, and had
> searched all day and found no trace of them; and he knew nothing of
> the place he was in, nor of the kindly gentleman who asked him to
> supper; but if they just told him where to find his cows he would
> thank them, and make the best of his way home at once.

> Then they all laughed and looked at each other, and the old hag looked
> more frightful than ever when she showed her long, sharp teeth.

> On this, Connor grew angry, for he was hot tempered; and he grasped
> his blackthorn stick firmly in his hand and stood up, and bade them
> open the door for him; for he would go his way, since they would give
> no heed and only mocked him.

> Then the eldest of the young men stood up. "Wait," he said, "we are
> fierce and evil, but we never forget a kindness. Do you remember, one
> day down in the glen you found a poor little wolf in great agony and
> like to die, because a sharp thorn had pierced his side? And you
> gently extracted the thorn and gave him a drink, and went your way
> leaving him in peace and rest?"

> "Aye, well do I remember it," said Connor, "and how the poor little
> beast licked my hand in gratitude."

> "Well," said the young man, "I am that wolf, and I shall help you if I
> can, but stay with us to-night and have no fear."

> So they sat down again to supper and feasted merrily, and then all
> fell fast asleep, and Connor knew nothing more till he awoke in the
> morning and found himself by a large hay-rick in his own field.

> "Now surely," thought he, "the adventure of last night was riot all a
> dream, and I shall certainly find my cows when I go home; for that
> excellent, good young wolf promised his help, and I feel certain he
> would not deceive me."

> But when he arrived home and looked over . the yard and the stable and
> the field, there was no sign nor sight of the cows. So he grew very
> sad and dispirited. But just then he espied in the field close by
> three of the most beautiful strange cows he had ever set eyes on.
> "These must have strayed in," he said, "from some neighbour's ground;"
> and he took his big stick to drive them out of the gate off the field.
> But when he reached the gate, there stood a young black wolf watching;
> and when the cows tried to pass out at the gate he bit at them, and
> drove them back. Then Connor knew that his friend the wolf had kept
> his word. So he let the cows go quietly back to the field; and there
> they remained, and grew to be the finest in the whole country, and
> their descendants are flourishing to this day, and Connor grew rich
> and prospered; for a kind deed is never lost, but brings good luck to
> the doer for evermore, as the old proverb says:

> "Blessings are won,  
> By a good deed done."

> But never again did Connor find that desolate heath or that lone
> shieling, though he sought far and wide, to return his thanks, as was
> due to the friendly wolves; nor did he ever again meet any of the
> family, though he mourned much whenever a slaughtered wolf was brought
> into the town for the sake of the reward, fearing his excellent friend
> might be the victim. At that time the wolves in Ireland had increased
> to such an extent, owing to the desolation of the country by constant
> wars, that a reward was offered and a high price paid for every wolf's
> skin brought into the court of the justiciary; and this was in the
> time of Queen Elizabeth, when the English troops made ceaseless war
> against the Irish people, and there were more wolves in Ireland than
> men; and the dead lay unburied in hundreds on the highways, for there
> were no hands left to dig them graves.
