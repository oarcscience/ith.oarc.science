The Royal Steed

> Of the great breed of splendid horses, some remained for several
> centuries, and were at once known by their noble shape and qualities.
> The last of them belonged to a great lord in Connaught, and when he
> died, all his effects being sold by auction, the royal steed came to
> the hammer, and was bought up by an emissary of the English
> Government, who wanted to get possession of a specimen of the
> magnificent ancient Irish breed, in order to have it transported to
> England.

> But when the groom attempted to mount the high-spirited animal, it
> reared, and threw the base-born churl violently to the ground, killing
> him on the spot.

> Then, fleet as time wind, the horse galloped away, and finally plunged
> into the lake and was seen no more. So ended the great race of the
> mighty Tuatha-de-Danann horses in Ireland, the like of which has never
> been seen since in all the world for majesty and beauty.

> Sometimes the cave fairies make a straight path in the sea from one
> island to another, all paved with coral, under the water; but no one
> can tread it except time fairy race. Fishermen coming home late at
> night, on looking down, have frequently seen them passing and
> re-passing--a black band of little men with black dogs, who are very
> fierce if any one tries to touch them.

> There was an old man named Con, who lived on an island all alone,
> except for a black dog who kept him company. Now all the people knew
> right well that he was a fairy king, and could walk the water at night
> like the other fairies. So they feared him greatly, and brought him
> presents of cakes and fowls, for they were afraid of him and of his
> evil demon, the dog. For often, men coming home late have heard the
> steps of this dog and his breathing quite close to them, though they
> could not see him; and one man nearly died of fright, and was only
> saved by the priest who came and prayed over him.

> But the cave fairies can assume many forms.

> One summer's evening, a young girl, the daughter of the man who owned
> the farm, was milking time cows in the yard, when three beautiful
> ladies, all in white, suddenly appeared, and asked her for a drink of
> milk. Now time girl knew well that milk should not be given away
> without using some precaution against fairy wiles, so she hesitated,
> fearing to bring ill-luck on the cows.

> "Is that time way you treat us?" said one of the ladies, and she
> slapped the girl on the face.

> "But you'll remember us," said the second lady, and she took hold of
> the girl's thumb and twisted it out of joint.

> "And your lover will be false to you," said the third, and with that
> she turned the girl's mantle crooked, the back to the front.

> Then the first lady took a vessel and milked the cow, and they all
> drank of the milk as much as they wanted; after which they turned to
> the girl and bade her beware of again offending the spirits of the
> cave, for they were very powerful, and would not let her off so easily
> another time.

> The poor girl fainted from fright, and was found quite senseless when
> they came to look for her; but the white ladies had disappeared.
> Though the story must have been true, just as she told it when she
> came to her senses, for not a drop of milk was left in the pail, nor
> could a drop more be got from the cows all that evening.
