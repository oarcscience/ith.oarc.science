St. Bridget

> AT one time a certain leper came to St. Bridget to beg a cow from her.

> "Which would you prefer?" said the holy Bridget, "to be healed of your
> disease or to have the cow?"

> "I would be healed," he answered.

> Then she touched him, and he became whole and went away rejoicing.

> After this Bridget's fame spread all over Ireland; and a man of the
> Britons, and his son, came to be healed; but she was at Mass, and sent
> to them to wait till Mass was over.

> Now the Britons are a hasty people, and the man said," You healed your
> own people yesterday and you shall heal us to-day."

> Then Bridget came forth and prayed over them, and they were healed.

> Another time, two lepers came to beg, and Bridget said, "I have but
> this one cow--take it between you and go in peace."

> But one leper was proud, and made answer: "1 shall divide my goods
> with no man. Give me the cow and I shall go."

> And she gave it to him.

> Then the other leper said, "Give me your prayers, holy Bridget, I ask
> no more."

> And she gave him her blessing. And as he turned to depart a man came
> in, and offered a cow as a present to the holy woman.

> "Now the Lord has blessed you," she said to the humble leper. "Take
> this cow and depart to your home."

> So the man drove time cow before him, and presently came up with the
> proud leper just at the ford of the river. "Cross you first," said the
> proud leper, "there is not room for two," and the humble leper crossed
> in safety with his cow; but when the other entered the ford, the river
> rose, and he and his cow were carried away and drowned, for the
> blessing of St. Bridget. was not on him.

> Another time, two lepers came to be healed, and Bridget ordered one of
> them to wash the other; which he did, and the man was healed.

> "Now," she said, "do to your comrade as he has done to you; wash him
> with water that he may be made clean of his leprosy."

> "Oh, veiled woman," he answered, "why should I, that am clean now in
> body and limb, touch this filthy leper of the blue-grey skin? Ask me
> not to do this thing."

> Then Bridget took water and washed time leper herself. Immediately the
> other who had been healed, cried out, "A fire is raging under my
> skin;" and the disease came again on him worse than ever. Thus was he
> punished for his pride.

> The lark is sacred to St. Bridget because its song woke her every
> morning to prayers, when she had service for the women who were her
> converts.

> The influence of St. Bridget remains a permanent power in Ireland even
> to this day, and she is much feared by the enemy of souls and the
> ill-doer. When Earl Strongbow was dying, he affirmed that he saw St.
> Bridget approaching his bed, and she struck him on the foot, and the
> wound she gave him mortified, and of this he died. This happened six
> hundred years after Bridget's death.

> St. Bridget, throughout her long life, held the highest position and
> dignity in the Irish Church. She erected a temple in Kildare, ordained
> bishops, and was head and chief of all the sacred virgins.

> She also held equal rank with the archbishop; if he had an episcopal
> chair *(cathedra episcopalis), so* St. Bridget had a virginal chair
> *(cathedra puellaris),* and was pre-eminent above all the abbesses of
> Ireland, or of the Scots, for sanctity and power.
