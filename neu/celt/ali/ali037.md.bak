The Fenian Knights  
A Legend of the West

> THERE is a fort near the Killeries in Connemara called
> *Lis-na-Keeran.* One day the powerful chief that lived there invited
> the great Fionn Ma-Coul, with his son Oscar and a band of Fenian
> knights, to a great banquet. But when the guests arrived they found no
> chairs prepared for them, only rough benches of wood placed round the
> table.

> So Oscar and his father would take no place, but stood watching, for
> they suspected treachery. The knights, however, fearing nothing, sat
> down to the feast, but were instantly fixed to the benches so firmly
> by magic, that they could neither rise nor move.

> Then Fionn began to chew his thumb, from which he always derived
> knowledge of the future, and by his magic power he saw clearly a great
> and terrible warrior riding fiercely towards the fort, and Fionn knew
> that unless he could be stopped before crossing a certain ford, they
> must all die, for they had been brought to Lis-na-Keeran only to be
> slain by their treacherous host; and unless the warrior was killed and
> his blood sprinkled on the Fenian knights, they must remain fixed on
> the wooden benches for ever.

> So Oscar of the Lion heart rushed forth to the encounter. And he flung
> his spear at the mighty horseman, and they fought desperately till the
> setting of the sun. Then at last Oscar triumphed; victory was his; and
> he cut off the head of his adversary, and carried it on his spear all
> bleeding to the fort, where he let the blood drop down upon the Fenian
> knights that were transfixed by magic. On this they at once sprang up
> free and scatheless, all except one, for on him unhappily no blood had
> fallen, and so he remained fixed to the bench. His companions tried to
> drag him up by main force, but as they did so time skin of his thighs
> was left on the bench, and he was like to die.

> Then they killed a sheep, and wrapped the fleece round him warm from
> the animal to heal him. So he was cured, but ever after, strange to
> relate, seven stone of wool were annually shorn from his body as long
> as he lived.

> \*

> The manner in which Fionn learned the mystery of obtaining wisdom from
> his thumb was in this wise.

> It happened one time when he was quite a youth that he was taken
> prisoner by a one-eyed giant, who at first was going to kill him, but
> then he changed his mind and sent him to the kitchen to mind the
> dinner. Now there was a great and splendid salmon broiling on the
> fire, and the giant said--

> "Watch that salmon till it is done; but if a single blister rise on
> the skin you shall be killed."

> Then the giant threw himself dowim to sleep while waiting for the
> dinner.

> So Fionn watched the salmon with all his eyes, but to his horror saw a
> blister rising on the beautiful silver skin of the fish, and in his
> fright and eagerness he pressed his thumb down on it to flatten it;
> then the pain of the burn being great, he clapped the thumb into his
> mouth and kept it there to, suck out the fire. When he drew it back,
> however, he found, to his surprise that he had a knowledge of all that
> was going to happen to him, and a clear sense of what he ought to do.
> And it came into his mind that if he put out the giant's eye with an
> iron rod heated in the fire, he could escape from the monster. So he
> heated the rod, and while the giant slept he plunged it. into his eye,
> and before the horrid being recovered from the shock, Fionn escaped,
> and was soon back safe amongst his own people, the Fenman knights; and
> ever after in moments of great peril and doubt, when he put his thumb
> into Imis mouth and sucked it, the vision of the future came on him,
> and he could foresee clearly whatever danger lay in his path, and know
> to avoid it. But it was only in such extreme moments of peril that
> this mystic power was granted to him. And thus he was enabled to save
> his own life and the lives of his chosen Fenian guard when all hope
> seemed well-nigh gone.
