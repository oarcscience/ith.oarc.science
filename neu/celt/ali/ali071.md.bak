Poetic Inspiration

Eodain the Poetess

> THE *Leanan-Sidhe,* or the spirit of life, was supposed to be the
> inspirer of the poet and singer, as the *Ban-Sidhe* was the spirit of
> death, the foreteller of doom.

> The Leanan-Sidhe somethes took the form of a woman, who gave men
> valour and strength in the battle by her songs. Such was Eodain the
> poetess, by whom Eugene, king of Munster, gained complete victory over
> his foes. But afterwards he gave himself up to luxury and pleasure,
> and went away to Spain, where he remained nine years, and took to wife
> the daughter of the king of Spain. At the end of that the he returned
> to Ireland with a band of Spanish followers. But he found his kingdom
> plundered and ruined, and the revellers and drunkards were feasting in
> his banquet hall, and wasting his revenues for their pleasures while
> the people starved. And the whole nation despised the king, and would
> not hear his words when he sat down in his golden chair to give just
> judgment for iniquity. Then Eugene the king, in his deep sorrow and
> humiliation, sent for Eodain the poetess to come and give him counsel.
> So Eodain came to him, and upheld him with her strong spirit, for she
> had the power within her of the poet and the prophet, and she said--

> "Arise now, O king, and govern like a true hero, and bring confusion
> on the evil workers. Be strong and fear not, for by strength and
> justice kings should rule."

> And Eugene the king was guided by her counsel and was successful. And
> he overthrew his enemies and brought back peace and order to the land.
> For the strength of the Leanan Sidhe was in the words of Eodain, the
> power of the spirit of life which is given to the poet and the
> prophet, by which they inspire and guide the hearts of men.
