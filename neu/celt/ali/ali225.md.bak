The Fairy Spy

> SOMETIMES the fairies appear like old men and women, and thus gain
> admission to houses that they may watch and spy, and bewitch the
> butter, and abduct the children, and carry off the young girls for
> fairy brides.

> There was a man in the west who was bedridden for seven years, and
> could do no work and had to be lifted by others when he moved. Yet the
> amount of food he consumed was enormous, and as every one pitied him,
> people were constantly bringing him all sorts of good things; and he
> ate up everything but grew no stronger.

> Now on Sundays when the family went to mass, they locked him up, but
> left him plenty of food, for there was no one in the house to help
> him. One Sunday, however, they left chapel earlier than usual, and as
> they were going by the shore they saw a great crowd of strangers
> hurling, and in the midst of them, hurling and running and leaping,
> was the sick man, as well and jolly as ever a man could be. They
> called out to him, on which he turned round to face them, but that
> instant he disappeared.

> So the family hastened home, unlocked the door, and went straight up
> to the room, where they found the man in bed as usual, thin and weak
> and unable to move; but he had eaten up all the food and was now
> crying out for more. On this the family grew very angry and cried,
> "You have been deceiving us. You are in league with the witch-folk;
> but we'll soon see what you really are, for if you don't get up out of
> that bed at once, we'll make down a fire and lay you on it, and make
> you walk."

> Then he cried and roared: but they seized him to drag him to the fire.
> So when he saw they were in earnest he jumped up and rushed to the
> door, and before they could touch him he had disappeared, and was seen
> no more.

> Now, indeed, they knew that he was in league with the devil, and they
> burned hIs bed and everything belonging to him, and poured holy water
> on the room. And when all was burned, nothing remained but a black
> stone with strange signs on it. And by this, no doubt, he performed
> his enchantments. And the people were afraid of it and gave it to the
> priest, who has it to this day, so there can be no doubt as to the
> truth of the story.

> And the priest knows the hidden meaning of the strange signs which
> give power to the stone; but will reveal the secret to no one, lest
> the people might try to work devil's magic with it, and unlawful
> spells by the power of the stone and the power of the signs.
