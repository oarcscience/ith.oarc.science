To Find Stolen Goods

> Place two keys on a sieve, in time form of a cross. Two men hold the
> sieve, while a third makes the sign of time cross on time forehead of
> the suspected party, and calls out his name loudly, three times over.
> If innocent, the keys remain stationary; but if guilty, the keys
> revolve slowly round time sieve, and then there is no doubt as to who
> is the thief.
