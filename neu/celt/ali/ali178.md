The Blind Poet

> As a proof of the magnetic, lucid vision obtained by the great ollamhs
> of poetry, it is recorded of the blind poet, Louad Dall, that his
> attendants having brought him the skull of an animal found upon the
> strand, they asked him to declare its history. And thereupon placing
> the end of his wand upon the skull, he beheld with the inner vision,
> and said--

> "The tempestuous waters have destroyed Breccan, and this is the skull
> of. his lapdog; and but little of greatness now remains, for Breccan
> and his people have perished in the waves."

> And this was "divination by the staff "--a power possessed only by the
> chief poets, and by none else.
