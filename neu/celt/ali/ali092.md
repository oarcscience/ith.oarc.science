The Wicked Widow

> THE evil spells over milk and butter are generally practised by women,
> and arise from some feeling of malice or envy against a prosperous
> neighbour. But the spell will not work unless some portion of the milk
> is first given by consent. The people therefore are very reluctant to
> give away milk, unless to some friend that they could not suspect of
> evil. Tramps coming in to beg for a mug of milk should always be
> avoided, they may be witches in disguise; and even if milk is given,
> it must be drunk in the house, and not carried away out of it. In
> every case the person who enters must give a hand to the churn, and
> say, "God bless all here."

> A young farmer, one of the fine handsome fellows of the West, named
> Hugh Connor, who was also well off and rich, took to wife a pretty
> young girl of the village called Mary, one of the Leydons, and there
> was no better girl in all the country round, and they were very
> comfortable and happy together. But Hugh Connor had been keeping
> company before his marriage with a young widow of the place, who had
> designs on him, and was filled with rage when Mary Leydon was selected
> for Connor's bride, in place of herself. Then a desire for vengeance
> rose up in her heart, and she laid her plans accordingly. First she
> got a fairy woman to teach her some witch secrets and spells, and then
> by great pretence of love and affection for Mary Connor, she got
> frequent admission to the house, soothing and flattering the young
> wife; and on churning days she would especially make it a point to
> come in and offer a helping hand, and if the cakes were on the
> griddle, she would sit down to watch and turn them. But it so happened
> that always on these days the cakes were sure to be burned and
> spoiled, and the butter would not rise in the churn, or if any did
> come, it was sour and bad, and of no use for the market. But still the
> widow kept on visiting, and soothing, and flattering, till Mary Connor
> thought she was the very best friend to her in the whole wide world,
> though it was true that whenever the widow came to the house something
> evil happened. The best dish fell down of itself off the dresser and
> broke; or the rain got in through the roof, and Mary's new cashmere
> gown, a present that had come to her all the way from Dublin, was
> quite ruined and spoiled. But worse came, for the cow sickened, and a
> fine young brood of turkeys walked straight into the lake and got
> drowned. And still worst of all, the picture of the Blessed Virgin
> Mother, that was pinned up to the wall, fell down one day, and was
> blown into the fire and burned.

> After this, what luck could be on the house? and Mary's heart sank
> within her, and she fairly broke down, and cried her very life out in
> a torrent of tears.

> Now it so happened that an old woman with a blue cloak, and the hood
> of it over her head, a stranger, was passing by at the time, and she
> stepped in and asked Mary kindly what ailed her. So Mary told her all
> her misfortunes, and how everything in the house seemed bewitched for
> evil.

> "Now," said the stranger, "I see it all, for I am wise, and know the
> mysteries. Some one with the Evil Eye comes to your house. We must
> find out who it is."

> Then Mary told her that the nearest friend she had was the widow, but
> she was so sweet and kind, no one could suspect her of harm.

> "We'll see," said the stranger, "only do as I bid you, and have
> everything ready when she comes."

> "She will be here soon," said Mary, "for it is churning day, and she
> always comes to help exactly at noon."

> "Then I'll begin at once; and now close the door fast," said the
> stranger.

> And with that she threw some herbs on the fire, so that a great smoke
> arose. Then she took all the plough irons that were about, and one of
> them she drove into the ground close beside the churn, and put a live
> coal beside it; and the other irons she heated red-hot in the fire,
> and still threw on more herbs to make a thick smoke, which Mary
> thought smelt like the incense in the church. Then with a hot iron rod
> from the fire, the strange woman made the sign of the cross on the
> threshold, and another over the hearth. After which a loud roaring was
> heard outside, and the widow rushed in crying out that a hot stick was
> running through her heart, and all her body was on fire. And then she
> dropped down on the floor in a fit, and her face became quite black,
> amid her limbs worked in convulsions.

> "Now," said the stranger, "you see who it is put the Evil Eye on all
> your house; but the spell has been broken at last. Send for the men to
> carry her back to her own house, and never let that witch-woman cross
> your threshold again."

> After this the stranger disappeared, and was seen no more in the
> village.

> Now when all the neighbours heard the story, they would have no
> dealings with the widow. She was shunned and hated; and no respectable
> person would be seen talking to her, and she went by the name of the
> Evil Witch. So her life was very miserable, and not long after she
> died of sheer vexation and spite, all by herself alone, for no one
> would go near her; and the night of the wake no one went to offer a
> prayer, for they said the devil would be there in person to look after
> his own. And no one would walk with her coffin to the grave, for they
> said the devil was waiting it the churchyard gate for her; and they
> firmly believe to this lay that her body was carried away on that
> night from the graveyard by the powers of darkness. But no one
> ventured to test the truth of the story by opening the coffin, so the
> weird legend remains still unsolved.

> But as for Hugh Connor and the pretty Mary, they prospered after that
> in all things, and good luck and the blessing of God seemed to be
> evermore on them and their house, and their cattle, and their
> children. At the same time, Mary never omitted on churning days to put
> a red-hot horse-shoe under the churn according as the stranger had
> told her, who she firmly believed was a good fairy in disguise, who
> came to help her in the time of her sore trouble and anxiety.
