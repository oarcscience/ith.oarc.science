Our Ancient Capital

> The history of Dublin, so admirably narrated by Mr. Gilbert in his
> learned and. instructive volumes, \[a\] begins the modern period of
> Irish history when Ireland became indissolubly united with time
> British Empire--the greatest empire of the world--and legendary lore,
> like all the ancient usages and superstitions, began to fade and
> perish before advancing civilization, as the luxurious undergrowth of
> a primeval forest before advancing culture.

> A sketch of the rise of the capital of Ireland, with all the changes
> produced in Irish life by the new modes of thought and action
> introduced by Norman influence, forms therefore a fitting close to the
> legendary and early-historic period, so full of poetry and charm for
> the imagination, with its splendour of kings and bards, its shadowy
> romance and mist-woven dreams, and its ideal fairy world of beauty and
> grace, of music and song; when the people lived the free, joyous life
> of the childhood of humanity under their native princes, and the
> terrible struggle of a crushed and oppressed nation against a foreign
> master had not yet begun; the struggle that has lasted for seven
> centuries, and still goes on with exhaustless force and fervour.

> The history of cities is the history of nations--the most perfect
> index of the social altitude, mental development, physical perfection,
> and political freedom, which at any given period a people may have
> attained. Every stone within a city is a hieroglyphic of the century
> that saw it raised. By it we trace human progression through all its
> phases; from the first rude fisher's hut, the altar of the primitive
> priest, the mound of the first nomad warrior, the stone fortalice or
> simple fane of the early Christian race, up to the stately and
> beautiful temples and palaces which evidence the luxury and refinement
> of a people in its proudest excess, or human genius in its climax of
> manifestation.

> Thus Babylon, Thebes, Rome, Jerusalem, are words that express nations.
> The ever-during interest of the world circles round them, for their
> ruins are true and eternal pages of human history. Every fallen column
> is a fragment of a past ritual, or a symbol of a dynasty. The very
> dust is vital with great memories, and a philosopher, like the
> comparative anatomist, might construct the entire life of a
> people--its religion, literature, and laws--from these fragments of
> extinct generations--these fossil paleographs of man.

> Statue and column, mausoleum and shrine, are trophies of a nation's
> triumphs or its tragedies. The young children, as they gaze on them,
> learn the story of the native heroes, poets, saints, and martyrs,
> leaders and lawgivers, who have flung their own glory as a regal
> mantle over their country. Spirits of the past, from the phantom-land,
> dwell in the midst of them. We feel their presence, and hear their
> words of inspiration or warning, alike in the grandeur or decadence of
> an ancient city.

> Modern capitals represent also, not only the history of the past, but
> the living concentrated will of the entire nation. Thus is it with
> London, Berlin, and Vienna, while Paris, the *cité verbe,* as Victor
> Hugo calls her, represents not only the tendencies of France, but of
> Europe.

> Dublin, however, differs from all other capitals, past or present, in
> this wise--that by its history we trace, not the progress of the
> native race, but the triumphs of its enemies; and that the
> concentrated will of Dublin has always been in antagonism to the
> feelings of a large portion of the nation.

> The truth is, that though our chief city of Ireland has an historical
> existence older than Christianity, yet this fair *Ath-Cliath* has no
> pretension to be called our ancient mother. From first to last, from a
> thousand years ago till now, Dublin has held the position of a foreign
> fortress within the kingdom; and its history has no other emblazonment
> beyond that of unceasing hostility or indifference to the native race.

> "The inhabitants are mere English, though of Irish birth," wrote
> Hooker, three hundred years ago. "The citizens," says Holingshed,
> "have from time to time so galled the Irish, that even to this day the
> Irish fear a ragged and jagged black standard that the citizens have,
> though almost worn to the stumps." Up to Henry the Seventh's reign, an
> Englishman of Dublin was not punished for killing an Irishman, nor
> were Irishmen admitted to any office within the city that concerned
> the government either of the souls or bodies of the citizens. The
> Viceroys, the Archbishops, the Judges, the Mayors, the Corporations,
> were all and always English, down to the very guild of tailors, of
> whom it stands on record that they would allow no Irishman to be of
> their fraternity. As the American colonists treated the red man, as
> the Spaniards of Cortez treated the Mexicans, as the English colony of
> India treated the ancient Indian princes, tribes, and people, so the
> English race of Dublin treated the Irish nation. They were a people to
> be crushed, ruined, persecuted, tormented, extirpated; and the Irish
> race, it must be confessed, retorted the hatred with as bitter an
> animosity. The rising of 1641 was like all Irish attempts--a wild,
> helpless, disorganized effort at revenge; and seven years later we
> read that Owen Roe O'Neil burned the country about Dublin, so that
> from one steeple there two hundred fires could be seen at once.

> This being the position of a country and its capital, it is evident
> that no effort for national independence could gain nourishment in
> Dublin. Our metropolis is associated with no glorious moment of a
> nation's career, while in all the dark tragedies of our gloomy history
> its name and influence predominate. Dublin is connected with Irish
> patriotism only by the scaffold and the gallows. Statue and column do
> indeed rise there, but not to honour the sons of the soil. The public
> idols are foreign potentates and foreign heroes. Macaulay says
> eloquently on this subject, "The Irish people are doomed to see in
> every place the monuments of their subjugation; before the
> senate-house, the statue of their conqueror--within, the walls
> tapestried with the defeats of their fathers."

> No public statue of an illustrious Irishman until recently ever graced
> the Irish capital. No monument exists to which the gaze of the young
> Irish children can be directed, while their fathers tell them, "This
> was to the glory of your countrymen." Even the lustre Dublin borrowed
> from her great Norman colonists has passed away. her nobility are
> remembered only as we note the desecration of their palaces; the most
> beautiful of all our metropolitan buildings but reminds us that there
> the last remnant of political independence was sold: the stately
> Custom-mouse, that Dublin has no trade; the regal pile of Dublin
> Castle, that it was reared by foreign hands to "curb and awe the
> city."

> It is in truth a gloomy task to awaken the memories of Dublin, even of
> this century. There, in that obscure house of Thomas Street, visions
> rise of a ghastly night-scene, where the young, passionate-hearted
> Geraldine was struggling vainly in death-agony with his betrayers and
> captors. Pass on through the same street, and chose by St. Catherine's
> Church you can trace the spot where the gallows was erected for Robert
> Emmet. Before that sombre prison pile two young brothers, handsome,
> educated, and well-born, and many a fair young form after them,
> expiated by death their fatal aspirations for Irish freedom. Look at
> that magnificent portal, leading now to the tables of the
> money-changers; through it, not a century ago, men, entrusted with the
> nation's rights, entered to sell them, and came forth, not branded
> traitors, but decorated, enriched, and rewarded with titles, pensions,
> and honours.

> Yet the anomalous relation between our country and its capital springs
> naturally from the antecedents of both. Dublin was neither built by
> the Irish nor peopled by the Irish; it is a Scandinavian settlement in
> the midst of a southern nation. Long even before the Norman invasion
> two races existed in Ireland, as different as the lines of migration
> by which each had reached it; and though ages have rolled away since
> Scythian and Southern first met in this distant land, yet the
> elemental distinctions have never been lost: the races have never
> blended into one homogeneous nationality. Other nations, like the
> English, have blended with their conquerors, and progression and a
> higher civilization have been the result. Roman, Saxon, Dane, and
> Norman, each left their impress on the primitive Briton; and from
> Roman courage, Saxon thrift, and Norman pride has been evolved the
> strong, wise, proud island-nation that rules the world--the
> Ocean-Rome. A similar blending of opposite elements, but in different
> proportions, has produced Scotch national character--grave, wise,
> learned, provident, industrious, and unconquerably independent. But
> the Irish race remains distinct from all others, as Jew or Zincali. It
> has no elective affinities, enters into no new combinations, forms no
> new results, attracts to itself no Scythian qualities of stern
> self-reliance and the indomitable pride of independence, but still
> retains all the old virtues and vices of their semi-oriental nature,
> which make the history of Ireland so sad a record of mere passionate
> impulses ending mostly in failure and despair. The English, slow in
> speech and repellent in manner, are yet able not only to rule
> themselves well and ably, but to rule the world; while the Irish, so
> fascinating, eloquent, brave, and gifted, have never yet achieved a
> distinctive place in the political system of Europe. We had even the
> advantage of an earlier education; we taught England her letters,
> Christianized her people, sheltered her saints, educated her princes;
> we give her the best generals, the best statesmen, the best armies;
> yet, withal, we have never yet found the strength to govern our own
> kingdom. Ethnologists will tell you this comes of race. It may be so.
> Let us then sail on the stream of time to Ararat, and try to find our
> ancestry amongst the children of the eight primal gods, as the
> ancients termed them, who there stepped forth from their ocean prison
> to people the newly baptized world.

> A very clever German advises all reviewers to begin from the Deluge,
> so that by no possibility can a single fact, direct or collateral,
> escape notice connected with the matter in hand. When treating of
> Ireland this rule becomes a necessity. Our nation dates from the
> dispersion, and our faults and failings, our features and our speech,
> have an authentic hereditary descent of four thousand years. Other
> primitive nations have been lost by migration, annihilated by war,
> swallowed up in empires, overwhelmed by barbarians: thus it was that
> the old kingdoms of Europe changed masters, and that the old nations
> and tongues passed away. Here only, in this island prison of the
> Atlantic, can the old race of primitive Europe be still found existing
> as a nation, speaking the same tongue as the early tribes that first
> wandered westward, when Europe itself was an unpeopled wilderness.

> We learn from sacred record that the first migrations of the human
> family, with "one language and one speech," were *from* the East; and
> every successive wave of population has still flowed from the rising
> towards the setting sun. The progression of intellect and science is
> ever westward. The march of humanity is opposed to the path of the
> planet. Life moves contrary to matter. A. metaphor, it may be, of our
> spirit exile--this travelling "daily further from the East;" yet, when
> at the farthest limit, we are but approaching the glory of the East
> again.

> Gradually, along the waters of the Mediterranean, the beautiful
> islands on its bosom serving as resting-places for the wanderers, or
> bridges for the tribes to pass over, the primal families of the
> Japhetian race reached in succession the three great Peninsulas of the
> Great Sea, in each leaving the germ of a mighty nation.. Still onward,
> led by the providence of God, they passed the portals of the Atlantic,
> coasted the shores of the vine-clad France, and so reached at length
> the "Isles of the Setting Sun," upon the very verge of Western Europe.

> But many centuries may have elapsed during the slow progression of
> these maritime colonies, who have left their names indelibly stamped
> on the earth's surface, from lonia to the Tartessus of Spain; and
> Miriam may have chanted the death-song of Pharaoh, and Moses led forth
> the people of God, before the descendants of the first navigators
> landed amidst the verdant solitudes of Ireland.

> The earliest tribes that reached our island, though removed so far
> from the centre of light and wisdom, must still have been familiar
> with all science necessary to preserve existence, and to organize a
> new country into a human habitation. They cleared the forests, worked
> the mines, built chambers for the dead, after the manner of their
> kindred left in Tyre and Greece, wrought arms, defensive and
> offensive, such as the heroes of Marathon used against the long-haired
> Persians; they raised altars and. pillar-stones, still standing
> amongst us, mysterious and eternal symbols of a simple primitive
> creed; they had bards, priests, and lawgivers, the old tongue of
> Shinar, the dress of Nineveh, and the ancient faith whose ritual was
> prayer and sacrifice.

> The kindred races who remained stationary, built cities and temples,
> still a world's wonder, and arts flourished amongst them impossible to
> the nomads of the plains, or the wanderers by the ocean islands; but
> the destiny of dispersion was still on the race, and from these
> central points of civilization, tribes and families constantly went
> forth to achieve new conquests over the yet untamed earth.

> Whatever wisdom the early island colonizers had brought with them,
> would have died out for want of nourishment, had not these new tribes,
> from countries where civilization had become developed and permanent,
> constantly given fresh impulses to progress. With stronger and more
> powerful arts and arms, they, in succession, gained dominion over
> their weaker predecessors, and by commerce, laws, arts, and learning,
> they organized families into nations, enlightening while they
> subjugated.

> The conquest of Canaan gave the second great impetus to the human
> tides ever flowing westward. Irish tradition has even, in a confused
> manner, preserved the names of two amongst the leaders of the Sidonian
> fugitives who landed in Ireland. Partholan, with his wife Elga, and
> Gadelius, with his wife Scota.

> "This Gadelius," say the legends, "was a noble gentleman, right wise,
> valiant, and well spoken, who, after Pharaoh was drowned, sailed for
> Spain, and from thence to Ireland, with a colony of Greeks arid
> Egyptians, and iris wife Scota, a daughter of Pharaoh's; and he taught
> letters to the Irish, and warlike feats after the Greek and Egyptian
> manner."

> These later tribes brought with them the Syrian arts and civilization,
> such as dyeing and weaving, working in gold, silver, and brass,
> besides the written characters, the same that Cadmus afterwards gave
> to Greece, and which remained in use amongst the Irish, it is said,
> until modified by Saint Patrick into their present form, to assimilate
> them to the Latin.

> Continued intercourse with their Syrian kindred soon filled Ireland
> with the refinement of a luxurious civilization. From various sources,
> we learn that in those ancient times, the native dress was costly and
> picturesque, and the habits and modes of living of the chiefs and
> kings splendid and Oriental. The highborn and the wealthy wore tunics
> of fine linen of immense width, girdled with gold and with flowing
> sleeves after the Eastern fashion. The fringed cloak, or *cuchula,*
> with a hood, after the Arab mode, was clasped on the shoulders with a
> golden brooch. Golden circlets, of beautiful and classic form,
> confined their long, flowing hair, and, crowned with their diadems,
> the chiefs sat at the banquet, or went forth to war. Sandals upon the
> feet, and bracelets and signet rings, of rich and curious workmanship,
> completed the costume. The ladies wore the silken robes and flowing
> veils of Persia, or rolls of linen wound round the head like the
> Egyptian Isis, the hair curiously plaited down the back and fastened
> with gold or silver bodkins, while the neck and arms were profusely
> covered with jewels. \[b\]

> For successive centuries, this race, half Tyrian and half Greek, held
> undisputed possession of Ireland, maintaining, it is said, constant
> intercourse with the parent state, and, when Tyre fell, commercial
> relations were continued with Carthage. Communication between such
> distant lands was nothing to Phoenician enterprise. Phoenicians in the
> service of an Egyptian king had sailed round Africa and doubled the
> Cape of Good Hope two thousand years before the Portuguese. The same
> people built the navy of King Solomon a thousand years before Christ;
> and led the fleet to India for the gold necessary for the Temple.
