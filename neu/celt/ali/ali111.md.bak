For a Pain in the Side

> "God save you, my three brothers, God save you! And how far have ye to
> go, my three brothers?"

> "To the Mount of Olivet, to bring back gold for a cup to hold the
> tears of Christ."

> "Go, then. Gather the gold; and may the tears of Christ fall on it,
> and thou wilt be cured, both body and soul."

> These words must be said while a drink is given to the patient.
