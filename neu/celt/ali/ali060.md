A Terrible Revenge

> THE fairies often take a terrible revenge if they are ever slighted or
> offended. A whole family once came under their ban because a fairy
> woman had been refused admittance into the house. The eldest boy lost
> his sight for some the, and though he recovered the use of his eyes
> yet they always had a strange expression, as if he saw some terrible
> object in the distance that scared him. And at last the neighbours
> grew afraid of the family, for they brought ill-luck wherever they
> went, and nothing prospered that they touched.

> There were six children, all wizened little creatures with withered
> old faces and thin crooked fingers. Every one knew they were fairy
> changelings, and the smith wanted to put them on the anvil, and the
> wise women said they should be passed through the fire; but destiny
> settled the future for them, for one after another they all pined away
> and died, and the ban of the fairies was never lifted from the
> ill-fated house till the whole family lay in the grave.
