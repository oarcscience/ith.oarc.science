The White Stones

> At many of the wells quantities of beautiful white stones are found
> that glitter in the sun, and these are highly esteemed by the pilgrims
> to build up their prayer monuments.

> One day some women were eagerly collecting these stones, after each
> round of praying, in order to build up a monument; when suddenly a
> strain of soft, exquisite music seemed to rise up from the water and
> float by them. In their joy and wonder the women clapped their hands
> and laughed aloud, when instantly the music ceased and the pile of
> stones fell down. By which sign they knew that they should not have
> laughed while the angels were singing; and they fell on their knees
> and prayed.

> \*

> A holy well once lost all its power because a murder had been
> committed near it; and another because it was cursed by a priest in
> consequence of the immorality that prevailed at the patterns.
