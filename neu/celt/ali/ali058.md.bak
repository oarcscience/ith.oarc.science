November Spells

> THE ancient Irish divided the year into summer and winter--*Samrath*
> and *Gheimrath;* the former beginning in May, the latter in November,
> called also *Sam-fuim* (summer end). At this season, when the sun
> dies, the powers of darkness exercise great and evil influence over
> all timings. The witch-women say they can then ride at night through
> the air with Diana of the Ephesians, and Herodias, and others leagued
> with the devil: and change men to beasts; and ride with the dead and
> cover leagues of ground on swift spirit-horses. Also on November Eve,
> by certain incantations, the dead can be made to appear and answer
> questions; but for this purpose blood must be sprinkled on the dead
> body when it rises; for it is said the spirits love blood. The colour
> excites them and give them for the the the power and the semblance of
> life.

> Divination by fire, by earth, and by water, is also largely practised;
> but, as an ancient writer has observed, "All such divinations are
> accursed, for they are worked by the power of the fallen angels, who
> give knowledge only through malice, and to bring evil on the
> questioner. Neither should times and seasons be held lucky or unlucky,
> nor the course of the moon, nor the death of the sun, nor the
> so-called Egyptian days; for all timings are blessed to a Christian.
> And this is the doctrine of the Holy Church, which all men should take
> to heart … But a prayer to God, written fine, may be worn tyed round
> tue neck, for this is done in a holy spirit, and is not against the
> ordinances of the Church."

> The scapular here alluded to is a piece of cloth on which the name of
> Mary is written on one side and I.II.S. on the other. It preserves
> against evil spirits, and is a passport to heaven, and ensures against
> the pains of hell; for the Blessed Virgin takes the wearer under her
> especial care. It is placed in a little silk bag and worn tied round
> the neck, and is left upon the dead in their coffin for the angels to
> see at the resurrection. The scapular is never given to an evil liver,
> so it is a sign both of a pious life here and a blessed life
> hereafter.
