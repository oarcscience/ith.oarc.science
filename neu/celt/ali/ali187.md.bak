Swearing Stones and Relics

The Cremave

> IN the old churchyard of the monastery at Saints' Island, there is an
> ancient black marble flagstone; and the monks gave it power as *A
> Revealer of Truth,* and it is called the *Cremave,* or Swearing Stone.

> Any one suspected of sin or crime is brought here from the country
> round, and if the accused swears falsely, the stone has the power to
> set a mark upon him and his race for seven generations. But if no mark
> appears then he is known to be innocent; and as long as the world
> lasts, the stone is to have this power, for so the monks decreed; and
> with many holy and mystic ceremonies they gave iii consecration, as
> the "Revealer of Truth." And though the English burned the monastery
> and defaced the altar and carried off the holy vessels, yet they had
> no power over the .Cremave, or Swearing Stone, which remains to this
> day.

> Many years ago, so runs the tale, a murder was committed us the
> neighbourhood, and a certain man being suspected as the murderer, he
> was forced to go to the" clearing stone"; for the people said, "If he
> is innocent, the Cremave will clear him; and if guilty, let him suffer
> for his crime."

> So, on the appointed day, he went with his friends and the accuser to
> the Swearing Stone; and there he was met by the priest, who adjured
> him to speak the truth in presence of all the people and before the
> face of God.

> The man laid his hand upon the stone, and solemnly swore that he was
> innocent; but instantly his right arm was shrivelled up, his feet
> failed, and he was carried home a miserable cripple, and so remained
> to the end of his life.

> Some weeks after a daughter was born to him, who bore across her
> forehead the impress. of a bloody hand; and every one of his
> descendants have some strange mark, by which the people know that the
> race is accursed to the seventh generation; after which time the doom
> will be lifted, and the expiation made for the crime and the perjury
> will be considered sufficient by the Lord in heaven, who will then
> grant to the race pardon and grace at last.
