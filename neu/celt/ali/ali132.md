For Pains

> "I kill the evil; I kill the worm in the flesh, the worm in the grass.
> I put a venomous charm in the murderous pain. The charm that was set
> by Peter and Paul; the charm that kills the worm in the flesh, in the
> tooth, in the body."

> This oration to be said three times, while the patient is rubbed with
> butter on the place of the pain.

> Another.

> A happy mild charm, a charm which Christ discovered. The charm that
> kills the worm in the flesh.

> "May Peter take, may Paul take, may Michael take, the pain away, the
> cruel pain that kills the back and the life, and darkens the eyes."

> This oration written, and tied to a hare's foot, is always to be worn
> by the person afflicted, hung round the neck.
