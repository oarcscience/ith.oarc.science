St. Kieran

> ST. KIERAN, also, did good service five hundred years after his death;
> for when a great chief and his band plundered Clonmacnoise and carried
> off the jewels from the shrine, the spirit of St. Kieran was seen in
> the doorway, crosier in hand, striking at the plunderers; and when
> they fled to their boat, St. Kieran raised up a strong wind that drove
> back the boat, and finally the chief robber was taken and put to
> death, having first confessed his crime, and testified as to St.
> Kieran's wrath against him.
