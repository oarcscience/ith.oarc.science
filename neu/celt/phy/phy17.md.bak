ERY many years ago, during the period when that redoubtable warrior
William the Norman was following up his successful battle of Hastings,
and making good his possession of the good land of England, there was a
certain Irish chieftain named BRODAR MERUNE, who, being a regular "broth
of a boy," fond of the best of good living, and keeping open house,
found himself, at the period of our story, like many more of his
hospitable and improvident countrymen of these degenerate days, a trifle
short of cash; and it being long prior to the invention of loan
societies, limited banks, or even bill-stamps, he had none of the
facilities for obtaining accommodation or "flying a kite" that are now
enjoyed by his descendants.

Money, however, Brodar Merunc must have by some means or other, for his
needs were pressing, so going to his strong chest, he brought forth the
family jewels--real Irish diamonds--and determined on them to negotiate
a loan. But, unfortunately, none of his countrymen were in a position to
assist him; every one was as hard up as he was himself. Among his
retainers was one Crorty, who had frequently visited the neighbouring
island of Man when engaged in fishing expeditions, and he informed his

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

master that at the foot of Grebah Mountain, not very far from the port
of Peel in that island, there resided a rich old curmudgeon of a jarl
named Haco, who, not being possessed of the same amount of personal
courage and daring as his brother nobles, thought it better to remain
quietly at home when they went forth on their marauding and piratical
expeditions. Jarl Haco, though fond of quiet and of a timorous
disposition, was, if not *hot*-headed, very *long*-headed, and the
talents that his neighbours employed in planning and carrying out
predatory expeditions to the neighbouring coasts of England and Wales,
he devoted to mercantile matters, and as he was careful, cunning, and a
smart man of business, he soon became the richest man in Ellan Vannin.

Always ready to lend his more valiant and pugnacious friends money when
they required the sinews of war for the fitting out of some fresh for
taking good care always to have ample security in hand--Jan Haco, of
Grebah Castle, was, in fact, an *Attenboronian* baron--a medieval
moneylender.

On hearing of the Lord of Grebah, Brodar Merune determined to take his
family jewels and set sail for the Isle of Man, for the purpose of
obtaining a supply of the necessary means of keeping open house a little
longer, by raising a loan. The winds were propitious, and he soon
arrived at Peel, where he landed without delay, and set forth in quest
of Jarl Haco, who he found at his castle at the foot of Grebah Mountain.
He showed him a specimen of the glittering jewels, and had no difficulty
in coming to terms for the much-required advance, being, like many
others in a similar strait, not over particular as to conditions so long
as he could actually get the cash.

It was agreed that Jan Haco should send down the sum required by one of
his own servants to the ship of Brodar Merune at Peel, where, on
receiving from him the remainder of the jewels, he was to hand over the
bags of coin.

On arriving at Peel with the money in his possession, Jan Haco's
messenger, Quiggar by name, proceeded to the vessel of the Irish baron,

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

who, seeing that he was alone (for the old Manx money-lender had not for
one moment suspected treachery on the part of his Celtic client), was
suddenly tempted to try and possess himself of the money without parting
with his family jewels. Inviting the messenger on board, he very
obsequiously handed him down into the cabin, and bidding the attendants
bring refreshments, the table was soon laden with flagons, cups, and all
the concomitants for brewing *potteen*.

"Are ye dhry?" said Brodar Merune, giving the messenger a seat and
helping to place the money-bags on the cabin table. "Sit down, man, and
be asy. Its time enough to do business when ye’ve washed your throat and
got breath, for it's a smart bit of a walk ye have had, and carrying
thim heavy bags too. Here, boy! be sharp now and bring the hot wather,
and mind it boils. Don't ye see the gentleman's exhausted with fatague?
and well he may be, carrying such a weight on him. All goold too. Sure
it's lucky the folks are honest in these parts, or ye might have had
throuble on the road. Faith! ye would in my counthry if it was known
what it was ye were carrying."

It was not long before a jorum of hot strong whiskey-punch was brewed
and placed before the Baron and his guest, who enjoyed it famously, for
it was but little of the good things of this life he ever saw or tasted
at Grebah Castle.

Brodar Merune, who had a hard and well-seasoned head himself, and could
drink enough to wash a horse, saw that his guest's bowl was frequently
replenished, and after a little time produced the jewels and proposed to
count out the contents of the money-bags.

The table was soon covered with little piles of coin and the Irish
diamonds, which latter shone and sparkled most brilliantly, like
twinkling stars of the first magnitude, before the eyes of the unwary
Manxman, who was emptying his goblet as fast as it was replenished, for
the liquor was good.

By the time the fifth brewing was disposed of, the gold and the jewels
all seemed to be dancing on the board together, and Quiggar found it
difficult to distinguish which was which. He had long since lost all
count

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

of the reckoning, as the Baron told over and piled up the golden coins
before him, till at length, being completely overpowered with the too
seductive liquor, his head fell forward on his bosom, and presently a
loud snorting snore informed his host that the potteen had done its
work.

THE EFFECTS OF POTTEEN.  

Calling several of his crew he bid them carefully carry the prostrate
Quiggar upon deck, and, hoisting him over the side, they laid him
comfortably

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

in a snug place on the shore, when Brodar gave orders to prepare for
immediate departure.

The vessel had been lying for some days in Peel Harbour while Brodar
Merune was negotiating his business with the Jarl of Grebah, and the
crew had been engaged in refitting and setting up the rigging and other
repairs requisite to be done in port. Such was now the hurry to get the
ship to sea, with the money Brodar Merune had so dishonestly secured,
before Jarl Haco's messenger could recover from his drunken fit and get
to his master with the news of his loss, or obtain assistance from his
countrymen in Peel to stop the vessel's departure, that neither he nor
his companions had paid any heed to the warning given to them by some of
the crew of a Manx ship laying alongside, who told them to kindle a fire
and carry a burning brand all over the vessel to drive out the fairies,
bugganes, witches, and other spirits that may be hidden on board before
sailing, and which could only be done by fresh kindled fire and while
the ship was still in contact with the shore. Such has been, and is
indeed now, the custom with Manx sailors and fishermen from time
immemorial.

Brodar Merune just then heeded nothing of fairies, witches, or bugganes,
and thought only of making off as quickly as he could with the
money-bags of the Jarl of Grebah, which he had so cleverly, as he
thought, succeeded in getting possession of.

The anxiety of Brodar Merune to get to his own country across the sea
was so great, he could pay no attention to anything but getting his
vessel under weigh, and his only thought was to hurry on his departure.
