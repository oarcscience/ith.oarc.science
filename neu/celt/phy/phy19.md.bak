### CHAPTER III.

DESIGN for the church was settled, which those who are acquainted with
the primitive barn-like simplicity of the ecclesiastical architecture of
the Isle of Man will readily understand did not occupy much time in
doing. The work was commenced without delay. Jarl Haco very liberally
gave the stone for the building the church for nothing, pointing out a
spot on his property from which it was to be quarried by the baron's
men. Curiously enough, the old Jarl had long been wanting some rugged
rocks cleared away from that spot, to carry out some improvements he
wished to make, but he begrudged the expense. How very lucky some people
are in being able to make the carrying out of their own selfish purposes
and designs bear the appearance of an act of charity. He furthermore
promised to present to the church a stained-glass window, which he
intended should bear his own name, be a memorial of his own
glorification, and he quite anticipated the pleasure he should
experience in contemplating his own munificent gift when seated in the
church.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Many were the difficulties the builders of this church had to contend
against in its construction, for the vicious little buggane had not
forgotten either his bruises, when Saint Trinion pitched him neck and
crop out of the Irish baron's ship on to the rocks, and disappointed him
of his intention of wrecking the vessel, or of the oath he had sworn
that "The sainted bishop should never have a whole church in Ellan
Vannin."

All the vengeful little elf could do to thwart the efforts of the
workmen he did. The horses that drew the stone from the quarry were
lamed in various ways. The quarrymen were continually being hurt by
stones falling on them, pushed out of their places by the naughty
sprite. These were his works by day. During the night he was still more
active; and frequently, when the workmen came to renew their labours in
the morning, they would find the greater part of the work done on the
previous day all destroyed and cast down to the ground.

At last, so palpable was it that some unseen hand was at work
frustrating their efforts, and that the accidents and mischief were
caused by some supernatural power, that the head man of the work,
getting quite disheartened at seeing day after day his own and his
fellow workmen's labours so frustrated, bethought him to apply to the
leaden image of saint Trinion, which Brodar Merune had set up in a
shrine close by, and ask the holy man what he had better do. It was the
identical image of the saint that Brodar so luckily had in his pocket on
the night of the storm.

The saint soon heard the petitions addressed to him, and immediately
making his appearance, informed the suppliant foreman that it was the
work of the buggane, and gave him the following instructions how to act
in order to prevent any further mischief.

In the first place, the building and works must never be left at night
but so soon as the workmen had finished their days work, some one must
mount guard to watch and keep up a blazing fire of wood from the rowan
tree, the fumes of which, when burning, would render powerless all
fairies, bugganes, or evil spirits of every description. In the daytime

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

every man was to wear in his hat or cap a sprig of the rowan tree, a
bunch of wormwood, and a feather from a sea gull's wing, tied together
with a strip of the skin taken from the belly of a conger eel. The same
charm was to be fixed in the headgear of each of the horses.

This advice of the saint was followed, and both plans adopted with
perfect success, the buggane's power being completely checkmated
thereby, as promised by the holy man. The building of the church from
this time forth made great and rapid progress.

The buggane, possessed of an energy and perseverance worthy of a better
cause, never for one instant ceased watching; but while the men and the
horses were protected by the charm in their hats and headgear they were
safe against his designs.

Sometimes a man grew careless and laid aside his hat and its protecting
sprigs, and so surely as any one did so some fatality would happen to
him. After some time the men, learning by experience the consequences of
neglect, took care to keep their charms always in their hats, and their
hats always on their heads. At night the smoke and fumes of the burning
rowan-tree wood drove him far from the building, for he could not
approach or come in contact with its mystic odours.

Night after night did the persevering little buggane hover round and
round the now rapidly progressing church, keeping a sharp eye upon his
enemy the watchman. At last, after a long while, and just as the church
was on the point of completion, his vigilance and pertinacity were
rewarded. One night an opportunity presented itself, which he lost not
one moment in taking advantage of. Great efforts had been made by all
hands to get the building completed by a certain time, as Brodar Merune
had sent word that he intended to come specially to the Isle of Man to
be present at the opening and consecration of the church when finished;
and the day being fixed, the work was hurried on at the last so as to
have all ready by the day of his expected arrival. Every one had been
very hard at work all one day to get the roof covered in, and at
nightfall it was very nearly completed; only some very trifling matters
being left

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

undone, which the foreman himself intended to come early the next
morning, and finish before the arrival of the abbot and priests from
Saint Germains and Rushen Abbey, with Brodar Merune and many other
nobles, for the consecration ceremonies.

The watchman on duty that night had been one of those engaged hard at
work all day, for every man that could be got had been employed in the
finishing of the church, and the preparations for the morrow's services.
The poor fellow was quite tired out with his labours, so after making up
a roaring fire of the rowan-tree wood, he thought he might safely take a
short nap--just a few winks and a nod--to recruit exhausted nature. He
lay down near the fire, and made himself as comfortable as circumstances
would permit. He was soon sound asleep and snoring. Now at last the
buggane's opportunity had arrived, and all his patience was about to
receive its reward in success.

The watchful little sprite had been closely eyeing his enemy, regarding
every movement of the man. No sooner did he lie down and fall asleep
than the buggane hastened to summon a number of his brother elves, and
proceeded, with their help to work out his own long-cherished revenge.

As long as the fire burned they could do nothing, so their first efforts
were directed to extinguish it. One little buggane, more knowing than
the others, raised a great wind, which blew the flames and made the fire
burn briskly, and the dreaded rowan-tree wood was quickly consumed, all
the elfin throng taking care to keep at a respectful distance, and on
the windward side of the fire, so as not to get within reach of its
magic vapours. The watchman was tired, and slept soundly in spite of the
wind and the crackling and roaring of the fierce-burning fire, and not
waking up to add more fuel, it soon burnt itself out. As the fire got
lower and lower, the bugganes drew nearer and nearer, and became more
daring. At last all was out except a few dying embers. The elves warily
approached quite close, and, following the example of the knowing little
fellow who raised the wind, they all began spitting on the ashes till
every spark was quenched.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

The moment the last spark died out they gave a loud unearthly yell,
which awoke the sleeping watchman, who was frightened out of his wits at
seeing himself surrounded by such a number of horrid-looking little
bugganes, dancing, leaping, shouting, and turning somersaults, that
would have made a modern acrobat or music-hall gymnast give up his
profession in despair of ever being able to equal. He looked all round
for a way to escape, but before the poor fellow could gain the door and
rush out of the building, they all together lifted the roof off the
church and dashed it to the ground in ten thousand pieces, burying the
unlucky watchman in the ruins.

The zealous foreman of the works was the first to arrive at the church
in the early morning, and when he drew near he soon discovered what the
bugganes had done, and that Saint Trinion's foe had been as good as his
word.

Not seeing anything of the watchman, he shouted his name, and was
answered by a groan from beneath the ruin of the shattered roof. He
immediately ran off to hasten the arrival of the workmen, with whose
assistance he proceeded to extricate their unfortunate comrade from his
very unpleasant predicament. The poor man, though sadly bruised and
battered, besides having what few wits he ever possessed frightened out
of him, was not killed, and, fortunately, not seriously hurt, having
been protected by two large beams, which in falling had done so
crosswise (it was supposed by the intervention of Saint Trinion), and
formed a shield that prevented the other timbers and materials from
crushing or suffocating him. After some delay and much exertion he was
extricated, and having partaken of a refreshing and invigorating
cordial, he told them all that had happened, and how the whole church
had been filled with "wee folk," who had lifted the roof and destroyed
it.

Intelligence of the disaster was immediately despatched to Peel, where
Brodar Merune with the monks and abbot of St. Germain's cathedral were
preparing to set out in solemn procession to the new church to perform
the ceremonies of opening and consecration.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

On hearing the news the hot-headed Irish baron swore terribly, and
greatly shocked the holy monks and abbot with his very strong language.
Calling for a horse, he mounted, set off at full gallop, and soon
arrived on the spot, where he saw for himself the devastation that had
been committed by his old tormentor the buggane and his helpmates.

After going round the building and hearing from the bruised watchman and
others the full particulars, he turned to the abbot, who, with some of
the less corpulent friars, had by that time arrived at the ruined
church, and said, addressing his reverence-

"Well, and shure it isn't me that's to blame at all. I've kept my word,
your riverence, honour bright. Neither the holy Saint Trinion, nor your
own Saint Germain, nor Ould Nick himself; can say I haven't fulfilled me
vow. Sorry it is that I am, that so fine and illigant a new chur-uch
should be so spoiled intirely; but there it is, and so it must remain
for me, as I've no more putty jewels to sell nor money to spind for new
roofs."

"Ah but, my son," solemnly rejoined the abbot, who had promised the
living of St. Trinion's church to a special friend of his, and had no
desire to lose his little bit of patronage, "I cannot consecrate a
church with no roof on it, and the blessed Saint Trinion of holy memory
expects you to complete him a proper church and shrine in accordance
with your vow."

"Faith, so I did," replied Brodar; "and if that holy and sainted
individual cannot look after his own interests sharp enough to prevent a
dirty lot of little spalpeen Manx bugganes from playing such divarshions
with it when it is done, it's no fault of mine, and bad cess to the
groat more that I'll spind on it at all. If he wants a roof to cover his
shrine he had better put one on himself; for I shan't."

So saying he remounted his horse and rode towards Peel, leaving the
abbot and the monks all contemplating the ruined building.

"Och! but if iver they make a saint of me," he muttered as he rode
along--"and it's small chance of that same, I'm thinking--but if iver
they do, I'll take better care of the church that may be built for me
than to let a blackguard little buggane play such bedivilment with it as
that, indade."

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

Brodar Merune was quite inexorable on the subject of restoring the roof
of the church, therefore the abbot, desirous both of pleasing Saint
Trinion and saving his protégé from disappointment on the matter of his
expectant living, applied to Jarl Haco, asking him to do the necessary
work, promising him a large amount of indulgences and dispensations; but
the lord of Grebah loved his money too well, and turned a deaf ear to
the venerable man's request.

The building was consequently left in its unfinished state, and so
remained for some centuries, going gradually to ruin and decay.
