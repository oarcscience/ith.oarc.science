# PREFACE

The wonders of the Isle of Man, according to Nennius, are "a strand
without a sea . . . . a ford which is far from the sea, and which fills
when the tide flows, and decreases when the tide ebbs"; and "a stone
which moves at night in Glen Cinden, and though it should be cast into
the sea, yet at morning's dawn it would be found in the same valley." I
cannot display such wonders as these in this little Compilation, yet I
think there will be found in it many quaint and curious "things not
generally known"; and I trust that it may not only interest Manx Folk
and Visitor Folk, but that it may be accepted as a contribution--though
an insignificant one--to the science of Folk-Lore.

Thanks are due to the many kind friends <span

and to Professor Rhys and Mr. Alfred Nutt, for assistance in Chapter 1.

A. W. MOORE.

Cronkbourne, June, 1891.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[vii:1](fim02.htm#fr_8.md) In some cases the name of
the contributor has been attached; but in others, as similar information
has been given by so many different persons, this has not been
practicable. Stories told to the writer, which have not been committed
to writing by the teller, are marked *Oral*.
