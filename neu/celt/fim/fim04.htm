Before that time, there is an epoch during which the place of history is usually supplied by tales of imaginary personages, whose doings are calculated to gratify the national pride. An unfailing characteristic of such an epoch is the personification of the race in an eponym, who is its supposed ancestor and founder. Thus, in the Isle of Man, we have the famous magician and navigator Manannan Mac Lir in this capacity, and there are various other mythical personages connected with the Island, all of whom appear in ancient Irish tales, though nothing can be discovered with regard to them from purely native sources of early date. In fact, the Isle of Man was so intimately associated with Ireland till the coming of the Northmen, that it is not likely that it would have any early myths distinct from those in Ireland. It is, therefore, to the early Irish legends that we have to refer for any mention of the Isle of Man, and they tell us that it was considered to be a sort of Fairy-land to which the Irish gods and heroes occasionally resorted. In the legends of the heroic period in Ireland, we find the deities and heroes called Lug, C&uacute;chulainn, C&uacute;roi, and C&uacute;lann connected with Man as well as Manannan; while, in the later or Ossianic Cycle of legends, we have Finn and his son Oisin, who, in the only really early native legend, are made to associate with the Scandinavian Oree. But of all these deities, the most important in Man is Manannan, about whom many tales have accumulated. To understand his place in the Legendary History of Ireland we must bear in mind that, according to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the <i>Leabhar Gabhala</i>, or Book of Invasions (a compilation of the late 10th or early 11th century), there were five conquests of Ireland, the first by Parthol or Bartholemew, and his followers; the second by Nemed and his followers; the third by the Firbolg; the fourth by the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann; the fifth by the Milesians. It is with the fourth body of invaders, the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, who conquered the Firbolg, that Manannan is connected. In the legendary and romantic literature of Ireland the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann are celebrated as magicians. By the Milesians and their descendants they were regarded as belonging to the spirit world, and, in the imagination of the people, they became Fairies, who were supposed to lie in splendid palaces in the interior of green hills. There can be little doubt that the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann represent the Olympus of the ancient Irish, that hierarchy of divine beings which the Celts possessed as well as other Aryan people. In this hierarchy Manannan occupied the position of god of the sea. But as early as the 9th and 10th centuries of our era he had suffered the change known as euhemerisation, from an immortal he had become a mortal. It is thus we meet him in one of the oldest monuments of Irish literature, the so-called glossary of Cormac, King-bishop of Cashel, killed in 903:--"Manannan Mac Lir, a celebrated merchant who was in the Isle of Man. He was the best pilot that was in the west of Europe. He used to know, by studying the heavens, the period which would be the fine weather and the bad weather, and when each of these two times would change. <i>Inde Scoti et Brittones eum deum vocaverunt maris</i>, <i>et inde filium maris esse dixerunt</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Maclir</i>, 'son of sea.' <i>Et de nomine Manannan </i>the Isle of Man <i>dictus est</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This theory of the Isle of Man being named after Manannan, when so called, has been shown to be highly improbable by Professor Rhys, who thinks that "Manannan gave his original name corresponding to <i>Mann </i>and its congeners to the Island, making it <i>Manavia Insula. </i>. . . for which we have in Welsh and Irish respectively <i>Manaw </i>and <i>Manann. </i>Then from these names of the Island the god derives his in its attested forms of Manawydan and Manannan, which would seem to mark an epoch when he had become famous in connection with the Isle of Man."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>To Cormac's account, O'Donovan has added the following note:--"He was the son of Allot, one of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>chieftains. He was otherwise called Orbsen, whence Loch Orbsen, now Lough Corrib. He is still vividly remembered in the mountainous district of Derry and Donegal, and is said to have an enchanted castle in Lough Foyle. According to the traditions in the Isle of Man and the Eastern counties of Leinster, this first man of Man rolled on three legs like a wheel through the mist."</p>  
<p>We can follow the process of euhemerisation in later texts. Thus, according to the Book of Fermoy, a MS. of the 14th to the 15th century, "he was a pagan, a lawgiver among the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, and a necromancer possessed of power to envelope himself and others in a mist, so that they could not be seen by their enemies." The Book of Lecan (14th century) mentions a Manannan whom it calls "son of Athgus, King of Manain (Man) and the islands of the Galls" (the Western Isles), who "came with a great fleet to pillage and devastate the Ultonians, to avenge the children of Uisnech," These children of Uisnech, when compelled to fly "from Erinn," had sailed eastwards. and conquered "what was from the Isle of Man northwards of Albain," and after having killed Gnathal, King of the country, were induced to return to Ireland under a pledge of safety from Conchobar, King of Ulster. The sons of Gnathal, who also sought the protection of Conchobar, "killed the sons of Uisnech," in consequence of which Gaiar, the grandson of Uisnech, banished Conchobar to the islands of Orc and Cat (the Orkneys and Caithness), and Gaiar having reigned over Ulster for a year, went into Scotland with Manannan, and died there. The 15th century version of a story called "The exile of the children of Uisnech" tells us that Gaiar was assisted against Conchobar by Manannan, who was the fourth of his name and dynasty who had ruled in Man.</p>  
<p>O'Flaherty speaks of him in his <i>Ogygia</i> as follows: "The merchant Orbsen was remarkable for carrying on a commercial intercourse between Ireland and Britain. He was commonly called Mananan Mac Lir, that, is, Mananan, on account of his intercourse with the Isle of Man; and Mac Lir, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>sprung from</i> the sea, because he was an expert diver; besides, he understood the dangerous parts of harbours; and, from his prescience of the change of weather, always avoided tempests.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The same author, in his <i>West Connaught</i>, states that Orbsen's proper name was Manannan, and that Lough Orbsen was called from him, because when his grave was being dug the lake broke forth; and he says that, at the adjacent <i>Magh Uillin</i>, "Uillin, grandchild of Nuadh (silver-hand), King of Ireland twelve hundred years before Christ's birth, overthrew in battle,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and had the killing of Orbsen Mac Alloid, commonly called Mananan (the Mankish man), Mac Lir (son of the sea) for- his skill in seafaring."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Keating, in his <i>General History of Ireland</i>, written early in the 17th century, gives Manannan's genealogy as follows: "Mananan, the son of Alladh, the son of Elathan, son of Dalboeth, an immediate descendant of Nemedius, the pro genitor of the Tuatha de Danans in Ireland; that weird and mystic colony who never, through the lapse of ages, have relinquished their dominion over the superstitions of the peasantry of Ireland; but who are still believed to rule the spirit or fairy land of Erin; to reign paramount in the <i>lis</i>, the cave, the mine to occupy genii palaces in the deepest recesses of the mountains, and under the deep water of our lakes."</p>  
<p>But supplementing this pseudo-historical account of Manannan, we find numerous romantic references to him at all stages of Irish literature. Thus, the "Sick-bed of C&uacute;chulainn," a tale which goes back, substantially, to the fifth century of our era, although we only possess it in transcripts of the 11th century, relates that Manannan became jealous of C&uacute;chulainn, with whom his wife Fand had fallen in love. He shook a cloak of invisibility of forgetfulness between the two and carried off Fand with himself to fairy-land, whereupon <A HREF="errata.htm#0">C&uacute;chulainn</A> returned to his own wife.</p>  
<p>Professor Rhys remarks of him that "In Irish literature he appears mostly as King of the Fairies in the Land of Promise, a mysterious country in the lochs or the sea. His character seems to have been a most contradictory one--many tricky actions are ascribed to him, while he was very strict about other people's morality. At his court no one's food would get cooked if, while it was on the fire, any one told an untrue story, and he is said to have banished three men from fairy-land to the Irish court of Tara for lying or acting unjustly. . . . In the Welsh Mabinogi, bearing the name of Manannan's counterpart, Manawydan, the latter is not much associated with the sea, excepting, perhaps, his sojourn . . . in the lonely Isle of Gresholm. It makes him, however, take to agriculture, especially the growing of wheat. . . . He is also called one of the three Golden Cordwainers of Britain, owing to his having engaged successively in the making of saddles, shields, and shoes. . . . The sinister aspect of Manannan is scarcely reflected by Manawydan, who is represented as gentle, scrupulously just, and always a peacemaker; neither is he described as a magician; but he is made to baffle utterly one of the greatest wizards known to Welsh literature." It would</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>appear also that he was connected with the other world, and he figures as one of the three landless monarchs of Britain. He had, however, a huge prison in the shape of a bee-hive, the walls of which consisted of human bones. King Arthur was once incarcerated there for three months.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Gaelic Manannan is represented in Brythonic (Welsh) literature by Manawydan, but it is uncertain if there really was a Brythonic sea-god corresponding to the Gaelic one, or if the Welsh tales are not simply literary adaptations of Irish ones. Professor Rhys favours the former view.</p>  
<p>The connection of Manannan with the Isle of Man probably arose in this way. It was the practice of the earliest Irish to represent their divinities as living in Islands to which, under exceptional circumstances, mortals might sail. It is uncertain if this conception of the Island home of divinities is really older or not than that which figures them as dwelling in the hollow hills. All one can say is that we find it earlier in the Irish texts. It has been well studied by Professor Zimmer in his admirable essay on the Brendan voyage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in which he shows that a number of texts which have come down to us are still completely pagan in conception, and reflect a belief which must still have been officially dominant in parts of Ireland as late as the sixth century. Unofficially these beliefs linger in the traditions respecting Hy Breasil. But, as a rule, the Gaelic peasant figures "Faery" as inside a hill, or under the water, and probably this belief is the older of the two.</p>  
<p>Manannan MacLir is an actor in so many of the ancient Irish heroic tales that it is impossible, with a due regard to space, to give more than outline of a few of them as we have done. The magic powers of his sword are frequently mentioned, <i>e.g.</i>, in the curious tale of Diarmait and Grainne. Those interested in such matters will find in Vol. III. of the Ossianic Society's Publications a marvellous romance of the adventures of Cormac MacArt in the fairy palace of Manannan in Man; but enough will have been given to exhibit Manannan in his various attributes as King, warrior, trader, navigator, and magician; and to show that his connection with the Isle of Man was supposed to have begun after he and his Tuatha d&eacute; Dananns were defeated by the Milesians, when he was chosen by the warriors as their leader, and that he and they were supposed to have taken refuge in the Western Isles and Man, whose inhabitants acknowledged him as their ruler.</p>  
<p>From purely local sources we glean the following information about Manannan; but it must be remembered that in its</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>present form it is all of comparatively recent origin, as the "Supposed True Chronicle of Man," and "The Traditionary Ballad," both probably date from the sixteenth century, though doubtless founded on older traditions. The former tells us that "he was the first man that had Mann, or ever was ruler of Mann, and the land was named after him," and that "he reigned many years, and was a Paynim, and kept, by necromancy, the Land of Man under mists, and if he dreaded any enemies, he would make of one man to seem an hundred by his art magick, and he never had any form of the comons; but each one to bring a certain quantity of green rushes on Midsummer Eve--some to a place called Warfield (now South Barrule), and some to a place called Man,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and yet is so called. And long after St. Patrick disturbed him, the said Manannan, and put Christian folks into the said land."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The ballad gives practically the same account. More recent tradition has endowed him with the stature of a giant, who by his strength and ferocity became the terror of the whole Island. It is said that he used to transport himself with great ease across the gorge between Peel Castle and Contrary Head. On one occasion, either for amusement or in a fit of rage, he lifted a large block of granite from the Castle rock, and though it was several tons in weight, he hurled it with the greatest ease against the slope of the opposite hill, about three miles distant, where it is seen to this day, having, as an evidence of the truth of the story, the print of his hand on it. His grave is said to be the green mound, thirty yards long, outside the walls of Peel Castle.</p>  
<p>The connection of Lug (an Irish divinity, corresponding partly to Hermes, partly to Apollo) with Manannan and Man, is said to have been a close one, as will be seen from the following account of him; and, as will be shown later, his cult had spread to Man as well as to other Celtic lands (see "August I." chap. vi). Lug is thus described: "Like to the setting sun was the splendour of his countenance and his forehead; and they were not able to look in his face from the greatness of its splendour. And he was <i>Lugh Lamh-fada</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and (his army was) the Fairy Cavalcade from the land of Promise, and his own foster brothers, the sons of Manannan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>" He is said to have been brought up at the Court of Manannan, here called the Land of Promise, which in many of the ancient tales is identified with Man. Lug was famous for his mighty blows, and his spear became one of the</p>

<p>treasures of the <A HREF="errata.htm#1">Tuatha</A> D&eacute; Danann. When he fought against the sons of Turenn and imposed upon them the impossible eric-fine of procuring certain fabulous weapons, he rode Enbarr of the flowing mane, Manannan's steed, who was "as swift as the clear, cold wind of spring," and travelled with equal ease on land and sea. He wore Manannan's coat of mail, through, or above and below which no one could be wounded; also his breast-plate, which no weapon could pierce. His helmet had two glittering precious stones set in front, and one behind, and Manannan's sword, called "The Answerer," hung at his side. From the wound of this sword no one ever recovered, and those who were opposed to it in the battle-field were so terrified by looking at it, that their strength left them. He was accompanied by his foster brothers, and by the Fairy Host, as already mentioned. The sons of Turenn were told that they could not obtain the eric-fine without the help either of Lug or Manannan, and they were advised to ask Lug for the loan of Manannan's steed, and if he refused, for his canoe, the "Wave Sweeper."</p>  
<p>Lug, the great warrior of the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, has his counterpart among the Ultonians in C&uacute;chulainn, who is said to have been the son of Lug, or Lug re-born. It is only in the story of "The Isle of Falga," given below, that he is mentioned in connection with the Isle of Man, though there were formerly songs sung about him, and there is a tradition to the effect that he was called "King of the Mists," like Manannan. His adversary, C&uacute;roi Mac Daire, was a great magician. The following tale gives an account of their rivalry for the fair daughter of the king of Man.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE STORY OF THE ISLE OF FALGA.</h4>  
<p>The Isle of Falga is variously supposed to have been the Isle of Man, or <i>Insi Gall</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the Western Isles. C&uacute;chulainn and the heroes of Ulster once on a time resolved to go on a plundering expedition to the Isle of the Men of Falga, a fairy land ruled by Mider as its King. C&uacute;roi, who was a great magician, insinuated himself among the raiders in disguise, and by means of his arts he succeeded in leading the Ultonians into Mider's stronghold, after they had repeatedly failed in their attempts. He did this on the condition that he was to have of the plunder the jewel that pleased him best. They brought away from Mider's castle Mider's daughter, Bl&aacute;thnat, as she was a damsel of exceeding beauty; also Mider's three cows and his cauldron, which were objects of special value and virtues. When they came to the division of the spoils, the mean-looking man in grey, who had led the victorious assault, said that the jewel he chose was Bl&aacute;thnat, whom he took to himself.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> C&uacute;chulainn complained that he had deceived them, as he had only specified a jewel, which he insisted on interpreting in no metaphorical sense; but, by means of his magic, the man in grey managed to carry the girl away unobserved. C&uacute;chulainn pursued, and the dispute came to be settled by a duel on the spot, in which C&uacute;chulainn was so thoroughly vanquished that C&uacute;roi left him on the field bound hand and foot, after having cut off his long hair, which forced C&uacute;chulainn to hide himself for a whole year in the wilds of Ulster, while C&uacute;roi carried away to his stronghold of Caher Conree both Bl&aacute;thnat and her father's cows and cauldron. Later it would appear that C&uacute;chulainn got the better of C&uacute;roi, and took Bl&aacute;thnat away from him, for Bl&aacute;thnat proved a faithless wife to C&uacute;roi and plotted with C&uacute;chulainn to kill him. At the time fixed upon by her, namely, November eve, C&uacute;chulainn and his followers stationed them selves at the bottom of the hill, watching the stream that came down past C&uacute;roi's fort; nor had they to wait long before they observed its waters turning white: it was the signal given by Bl&aacute;thnat, for she had agreed to empty the milk of Mider's three cows from Mider's cauldron into the stream, which has ever since been called the Finnghlais, or White Brook. The sequel was that C&uacute;chulainn entered C&uacute;roi's fort unopposed, and slew its owner, who happened to be asleep with his head on Bl&aacute;thnat's lap. C&uacute;chulainn took away Bl&aacute;thnat, with the famous cows and cauldron; but he was not long to have possession of his new wife, for C&uacute;roi's poet and harper, called Ferceirtne, resolved to avenge his master; so he paid a visit to C&uacute;chulainn and Bl&aacute;thnat in Ulster, where he was gladly received by them; but one day, when the Ultonian nobles happened to be at a spot bordering on a high cliff, Ferceirtne suddenly clasped his arms round Bl&aacute;thnat, and flinging himself over the cliff they died together.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> This old story has been embodied in a poem, called "Blanid,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by Robert D. Joyce, of which the following, lines describing the combat between C&uacute;roi and C&uacute;chulainn are perhaps the best:--</p>

<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"I come to win back thy misgotten prize,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mine own beloved, the bloom-bright Maid of Man!"<br> "Thou com&#8217;st to dye this grass with ruddy dyes<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy best blood," cried C&uacute;roi, "and to ban<br> All knighthood with thy word forsworn!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes Shall see the fight, so let him take who can!<br> Lo! there she stands, with her fear-whitened face;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Look thy last on her now, and take thy place!"<A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Meanwhile, as one who on a wreck doth stand,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That the wide wallowing waves toss to and fro,<br> And sees the saving boat put from the land,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now high, now in the sea-trough sunken low,<br> Trembling &#8217;tween fear and hope, each lily hand<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pressed on her heart, as if to hide her woe,<br> And pale as one who had forsaken life,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Young Blanid stood to watch the coming strife.</p>

<p>Then sprang they to their feet, and warily<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Looked in each other's eyes with look of hate,<br> And crossed their jarring swords, and with bent knee<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fought a long time, their burning ire to sate,<br> Till like a storm-uprooted stately tree<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Cuhullin fell, and C&uacute;roi stood elate,<br> Eyeing him as the hunter eyes the hoar,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That fighting falls, but yet may rise once more.</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Another mythic Irish figure connected with the Isle of Man is Culann, the smith, who in this capacity may be compared with Heph&#339;stus, or Vulcan. Culann was, however, also a Divine and Prophet. He was the possessor of a terrible hound, which was slain by the youthful Setanta; who was in consequence called C&uacute;-Chulainn, <i>i.e.</i>, Culann's hound. Culann is said to have lived for a time in the Isle of Man, where he manufactured sword, spear, and shield of such transcendent excellence for Conchobar, that he was invited by him to dwell in his realm. The story about this may perhaps be found of sufficient interest to be related at length:--Conchobar, who had not yet become King of Ulster, but was an ambitious young man seeking to gain a kingdom, consulted the famous oracle at Clogher as to how he might best attain his end. The oracle advised him to proceed to the Isle of Man and get Culann to make these weapons for him. Conchobar did so, and prevailed on Culann to begin his task; but, while awaiting its completion, he sauntered one morning along the shore, and in the course of his walk met with a mermaid fast asleep on the beach. He promptly bound the syren, but she, on waking and perceiving what had happened, besought him to liberate her; and to induce him to yield to her petition, she informed him that she was Teeval, the Princess of the Ocean; and promised that if he caused Culann to form her representation on the shield surrounded with this inscription, 'Teeval, Princess of the Ocean,' it would possess such extraordinary powers that when ever he was about engaging his enemy in battle, and looked upon her figure on the shield, read the legend, and invoked her name, his enemies would diminish in strength, while he and his people would acquire a proportionate increase in theirs. Conchobar had the shield made according to the advice of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Teeval, and, on his return to Ireland, such extraordinary success attended his arms, that he won the kingdom of Ulster. Culann accepted Conchobar's offer, referred to above, and settled on the plain of Murthemne, which was fabled to have been formerly situated beneath the sea. It was here that he was visited by Conchobar, accompanied by his Court and C&uacute;chulainn.</p>  
<p>Of the later legends, which form a cycle entirely distinct from that of the heroic age, Finn, the son of Cumall (Finn MacCumaill), is the chief hero. He is said to have been the chief of a band of mercenaries, or robbers, called Fianns, and to have flourished in the second part of the third century. If this were so, he lived on the very threshold of the historical period in Ireland. Ossin, his son, was a famous warrior and a great poet. in both of which roles he only reproduced the character of his father, who was not merely celebrated as a warrior and huntsman, but especially as a poet and diviner, as already stated. Finn is connected with the Scandinavian Orree in a Manx heroic poem, and if, as has recently been conjectured.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Finn is identical with Kettle Finn, a Norseman who yielded great influence in Ireland and Man about the middle of the ninth century, the connection is a very natural one. The poem referred to above is undoubtedly the oldest known poetical composition in the Manx language. We append it, together with some interesting notes by Deemster Peter John Heywood, who died in 1790. It is not known by whom the spirited English translation was made. With the exception of lines 9 and 10, which rendered literally are--</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Full threescore whelps, and not one less,<br> With three old dames to look after them,"</FONT></DIR></p>

<p>There are only two Scandinavian tales remaining on record in Man. They are <i>Sigurd Fafni's Bane</i> and <i>The Punishment of Loki</i>. These tales have been preserved neither by tradition, nor by written record, but by having been carved on stone. Both are found on a stone in Kirk Andreas Church-yard, and the first only on a stone in Malew Church-yard.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> We take the following abstract of the two tales, which are mythologico-historical lays in the Elder Edda, from an account of the Andreas stone given by Mr. G. F. Black in the <i>Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE STORY OF SIGURD FAFNI'S BANE.</h4>  
<p>"There was a king named Sigmund V&ouml;lsungsson, who married Hiordis, a daughter of King Eylimi, for his second wife. Some time after his marriage Sigmund was attacked in his kingdom by King Lingvi Hundingsson and his brothers, and was mortally wounded through being opposed by a one-eyed man, with a broad-brimmed hat and blue cloak (Odin), who held his spear against the sword of Sigmund, which was shivered into fragments. At night, Hiordis came to the battle- stead and asked Sigmund whether he could be healed, but he did not wish to be healed, for his good fortune had forsaken him since Odin had broken his sword, of which he requested Hiordis to .collect the fragments, and give them to the son she would bear, who should become the greatest of the V&ouml;lsung race. Hiordis was carried off by Alf, son of King Hialprek of Denmark, who had just landed at the battle-stead with a band of Vikings, and who married her after she gave birth to Sigmund's child. This child was named Sigurd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and grew up in Hialprek's court, under the care of the dwarf Regin, who taught him all the branches of knowledge known at that time. He also urged him to demand his father's treasure of <A HREF="errata.htm#2">Hialprek</A>, but Sigurd only asked a horse of the king, who allowed him to choose one; and Odin, in the guise of an old man with a long beard, aided him to find out Grana, that was of Sleipnir's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> race. Regin then counselled Sigurd to go in quest of Fafni's gold, of which he gave him the following account:--</p>  
<p>"Hreidmar had three sons, Fafni the Dragon, Ottur, and Regin the dwarf-smith. Ottur could transform himself into an otter, under which form he was in the habit of catching fish in Andvari's waterfall, so called from a dwarf of that name. One day as Ottur was sitting with his eyes shut eating a salmon, Odin, H&#339;nir, and Loki passed by; and Loki cast a stone at Ottur and killed him. The &AElig;sir (gods) then skinned him, and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>came well satisfied with their prize to Hreidmar's dwelling. Hreidmar caused them to be seized, and compelled them to redeem themselves with as much gold as would both fill and cover the otter's skin. To obtain the gold Loki borrowed R&aacute;n's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> net, cast it into the waterfall, and caught in it the dwarf Andvari, who was accustomed to fish there under the form of a pike. The dwarf was compelled to give all his gold-hoard as the price of his liberty; but on Loki taking from him his last ring, with which he hoped to redeem his fortune, he foretold that it should prove the bane of all its possessors. With this gold the &AElig;sir covered the otter's skin; but on Hreidmar perceiving a hair of the beard still uncovered, Odin threw on it the ring of Andvari. Fafni afterwards slew his father Hreidmar, took possession of the gold, became one of the worst of serpents, and now watched over his treasures at Gnitaheid."</p>  
<p>Sigurd then asked Regin to forge him a sword, and Regin forged one that could cleave an anvil, and cut through floating wool. Armed with this weapon Sigurd fared forth, first to his maternal uncle Grip, who spaed his fortune. He then sailed with a large fleet collected for him by King Hialprek to avenge his father's death. During a storm they were hailed by an old man (Odin) from a cliff, whom they took on board. He told them his name was Hnikar, together with many other things. The storm abating, he stepped ashore and vanished. Hunding's son, with a large army, encountered Sigurd, but were all slain, and Sigurd returned with great honour. Sigurd now expressed a wish to slay the dragon Fafni, whose lair had been pointed out to him by Regin. After a hard fight Sigurd pierces the dragon through the body, but nevertheless it holds a long conversation with its slayer, in which it answers Sigurd's questions relative to the Norns and &AElig;sir but strives in vain to dissuade him from taking the gold.</p>  
<p>After the death of Fafni, Regin cut out his heart, and told Sigurd to roast it for him while he took a sleep. Sigurd took the heart and roasted it on a spit, and when he thought it roasted enough, and as the blood frothed from it, he touched it with his finger to see if it were quite done. He burned his finger, and put it in his mouth, and when Fafni's heart's blood touched his tongue, he understood the language of birds. He heard a bird telling its companions that Sigurd should himself eat the dragon's heart. A second bird said that Regin would deceive him; a third said that he ought to kill Regin; another one counsels that he should take the dragon's treasure. All these things Sigurd performs, and rides off with the treasure on Grana's back."</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>In the upper left-hand corner of what, for convenience, we may call the front of the stone, is carved the figure of Sigurd roasting the heart of Fafni. Only the upper part of Sigurd's body is now visible on the stone, the remainder being broken off. In his left hand Sigurd is represented holding a spit containing the heart of Fafni, which is divided into three gobbets, while at the same time he inserts the finger of his right hand into his mouth. The flames are represented by three small isosceles triangles, one for each gobbet. Immediately above Sigurd's shoulders is shown the head and neck of one of the talking birds which warned him of Regin's intended treachery, and counselled him to forestall the deceiver by cutting off his head. The head of the bird is shown with the neck stretched forward, and the beak open as if addressing Sigurd.</p>  
<p>The head and neck of Sigurd's horse Grana is also shown above that of the bird. The whole subject is thus referred to in <i>Fafnism&aacute;l</i>:--</p>  
<p>The first bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> says:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"There sits Sigurd sprinkled with blood<br> Fafni's heart at the fire he roasts.<br> Wise methinks were the ring-dispenser,<br> If he the glistening life-pulp ate."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Second bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"There lies Regin communing with himself;<br> He wilt beguile the youth who in him trusts:<br> In rage he brings evil words together,<br> The framer of evil will avenge his brother."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Third bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"By the head shorter, let him the hoary sage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> Send hence to Hell; all the gold then can he<br> Possess atone, the mass that under Fafni lay."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Fourth bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"He would, methinks, be prudent,<br> If he could have your friendly counsel, my sisters!<br> If he would bethink himself and Hugin gladden.<br> There I expect the wolf where his ears I see."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Fifth bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Not so prudent is that tree of battle,<br> As I that warlike leader had supposed.<br> If he one brother lets depart,<br> Now he the other has of life bereft."</FONT> <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></DIR></p>  
<p>Sixth bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">He is most simple, if he longer spares<br> That people's pest. There lies Regin,<br> Who has betrayed him. He cannot guard against it."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Seventh bird:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"By the head shorter let him<br> Make the ice-cold J&ouml;tun,<br> And of his rings deprive him; then of that treasure thou,<br> Which Fafni owned, sole lord wilt be."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>Sigurd replies:</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Fate shall not so resentless be,<br> That Regin shall my death-word bear;<br> For the brothers both shall speedily<br> Go hence to Hell."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>In the lowest left-hand corner is shown the upper half of a human figure, holding a sword at arm's length. It no doubt represents Sigurd, but whether before or after slaying the dragon, it is impossible to say.</p>  
<p>An historical connection with this tale of Sigurd Fafni's Bane has been suggested by Professor Browne, which, though not strictly in place in a book of this kind, is so interesting and suggestive that it may be briefly narrated--Among the coins found when digging the foundations of the tower at Andreas Church was one, either of Aulaf Sihtric's son, surnamed the Red, who was King of Northumbria 941-945, and King of Dublin till the battle of Tara in 980, or of Aulaf Godfrey's son, Sihtric's brother's son, who was King of Northumbria till 941. Now, the Sigurd of Sigurd Fafni's Bane was the great-great-grandfather of these two Aulafs, and it is, therefore, a reasonable surmise that the crosses both at Andreas and Malew are memorials to the memory of one -of them. This is particularly interesting to historians as showing the connection of these Aulafs, probably that of Aulaf Sihtric's son with Man, and of equal interest to arch&aelig;ologists as demonstrating that these crosses are of much earlier date than has generally been supposed.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE STORY OF THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKI.</h4>  
<p>After Loki had enraged the gods by his many treacheries, he was chased by them, and took refuge in the waterfall of Frarangr, where he was caught by the gods in a net under the form of a salmon. After his capture he changed to his human form, and as a punishment the gods caused him to be bound to a rock with the entrails of his own son Nari. After he was bound Skadi (a goddess, daughter of Thiassi and the wife of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Nj&ouml;rd) took a venomous serpent and fastened it up over Loki's head. The venom dropped down from it on to Loki's face. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat beside him, and held a basin under the serpent's head to catch the venom, and when the basin was full she took it away to empty it. Meanwhile the venom dropped on Loki, who shrank from it so violently that the whole earth trembled.</p>  
<p>Of all the mythical personages mentioned in this chapter, the only one remaining in the Folk-Lore of the present day is Manannan, and even about him comparatively little is known. He is usually called <i>Maninagh</i> "the Manxman," and is supposed to have been the first man in Man, which he protected by a mist. If, however, his enemies succeeded in approaching in spite of this, he threw chips into the water, which became ships. His stronghold was Peel Castle, and he was able to make one man on its battlements appear as a thousand. Thus he routed his enemies. These, together with the notion that he went about on three legs at a great pace, are all the popular ideas about Manannan which still survive.</p>
