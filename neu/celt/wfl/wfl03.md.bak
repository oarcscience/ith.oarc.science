I.

THE Gwragedd Annwn (literally, wives of the lower world, or hell) are
the elfin dames who dwell under the water. I find no resemblance in the
Welsh fairy to our familiar mermaid, beyond the watery abode, and the
sometimes winning ways. The Gwragedd Annwn are not fishy of aspect, nor
do they dwell in the sea. Their haunt is the lakes and rivers, but
especially the wild and lonely lakes upon the mountain heights. These
romantic sheets are surrounded with numberless superstitions, which will
be further treated of. In the realm of faerie they serve as avenues of
communication between this world and the lower one of annwn, the shadowy
domain presided over by Gwyn ap Nudd, king of the fairies. This
sub-aqueous realm is peopled by those children of mystery termed Plant
Annwn, and the belief is current among the inhabitants of the Welsh
mountains that the Gwragedd Annwn still occasionally visit this upper
world of ours. \['Archaeologia Cambrensis,' 2<sup>nd</sup> Se., iv.,
253\] The only reference to Welsh mermaids I have either read or heard
is contained in Drayton's account of the Battle of Agincourt. There it
is mentioned, among the armorial ensigns of the counties of Wales:

As Cardigan, the next to them that went,  
Came with a mermaid sitting on a rock

\[There is in 'Cymru Fu' a mermaid story, but its mermaid feature is
apparently a modern embellishment of a real incident, and without value
here.\]

II\.

Crumlyn Lake, near the quaint village of Briton Ferry, is one of the
many in Wales which are a resort of the elfin dames. It is also believed
that a large town lies swallowed up there, and that the Gwragedd Annwn
have turned the submerged walls to use as the superstructure of their
fairy palaces. Some claim to have seen the towers of beautiful castles
lifting their battlements beneath the surface of the dark waters, and
fairy bells are at times heard ringing from these towers. The way the
elfin dames first came to dwell there was this: A long, ay, a very long
time ago, St. Patrick came over from Ireland on a visit to St. David of
Wales, just to say 'Sut yr y'ch chwi?' (How d'ye do?); and as they were
strolling by this lake conversing on religious topics in a friendly
manner, some Welsh people who had ascertained that it was St. Patrick,
and being angry at him for leaving Cambria for Erin, began to abuse him
in the Welsh language, his native tongue. Of course such an insult could
not go unpunished, and St. Patrick caused his villifiers to be
transformed into fishes; but some of them being females, were converted
into fairies instead. It is also related that the sun, on account of
this insolence to so holy a man, never shed its life-giving rays upon
the dark waters of this picturesque lake, except during one week of the
year. This legend and these magical details are equally well accredited
to various other lakes, among them Llyn Barfog, near Aberdovey, the town
whose 'bells' are celebrated in immortal song.

III\.

Llyn Barfog is the scene of the famous elfin cow's descent upon earth,
from among the droves of the Gwragedd Annwn. This is the legend of the
origin of the Welsh black cattle, as related to me in Carmarthenshire:
In times of old there was a band of elfin ladies who used to haunt the
neighbourhood of Llyn Barfog, a lake among the hills just back of
Aberdovey. It was their habit to make their appearance at dusk clad all
in green, accompanied by their milk-white hounds. Besides their hounds,
the green ladies of Llyn Barfog were peculiar in the possession of
droves of beautiful milk-white kine, called Gwartheg y Llyn, or kine of
the lake. One day an old farmer, who lived near Dyssyrnant, had the good
luck to catch one of these mystic cows, which had fallen in love with
the cattle of his herd. From that day the farmer's fortune was made.
Such calves, such milk, such butter and cheese, as came from the
milk-white cow never had been seen in Wales before, nor ever will be
seen again. The fame of the Fuwch Gyfeiliorn (which was what they called
the cow) spread through the country round. The farmer, who had been
poor, became rich; the owner of vast herds, like the patriarchs of old.
But one day he took it into his silly noddle that the elfin cow was
getting old, and that he had better fatten her for the market. His
nefarious purpose thrived amazingly. Never, since beef steaks were
invented, was seen such a fat cow as this cow grew to be. Killing day
came, and the neighbours arrived from all about to witness the
taking-off of this monstrously fat beast. The farmer had already counted
up the gains from the sale of her, and the butcher had bared his red
right arm. The cow was tethered, regardless of her mournful lowing and
her pleading eyes; the butcher raised his bludgeon and struck fair and
hard between the eyes; when lo! a shriek resounded through the air,
awakening the echoes of the hills, as the butcher's bludgeon went
through the goblin head of the elfin cow, and knocked over nine
adjoining men, while the butcher himself went frantically whirling
around trying to catch hold of something permanent. Then the astonished
assemblage beheld a green lady standing on a crag high up over the lake,
and crying with a loud voice:

Dere di felen Emion,  
Cyrn Cyfeiliorn-braith y Llyn,  
A'r foci Dodin,  
Codwch, dewch adre.

Come yellow Anvil, stray horns,  
Speckled one of the lake,  
And of the hornless Dodlin,  
Arise, come home.

Whereupon not only did the elfin cow arise and go home, but all her
progeny to the third and fourth generations went home with her,
disappearing in the air over the hill tops and returning nevermore. Only
one cow remained of all the farmer's herds, and she had turned from
milky white to raven black. Whereupon the farmer in despair drowned
himself in the lake of the green ladies, and the black cow became the
progenitor of the existing race of Welsh black cattle.

This legend appears, in a slightly different form, in the 'Iola MSS.,'
as translated by Taliesin Williams, of Merthyr: \[Llandovery, published
for the Welsh MSS. Society, 1848.\] 'The milk-white milch cow gave
enough of milk to every one who desired it; and however frequently
milked, or by whatever number of persons, she was never found deficient.
All persons who drank of her milk were healed of every illness; from
fools they became wise; and from being wicked, became happy. This cow
went round the world; and wherever she appeared, she filled with milk
all the vessels that could be found, leaving calves behind her for all
the wise and happy. It was from her that all the milch cows in the world
were obtained. After traversing through the island of Britain, for the
benefit and blessing of country and kindred, she reached the Vale of
Towy; where, tempted by her fine appearance and superior condition, the
natives sought to kill and eat her; but just as they were proceeding to
effect their purpose, she vanished from between their hands, and was
never seen again. A house still remains in the locality, called Y Fuwch
Laethwen Lefrith (The Milk-white Milch Cow.)'

lV.

The legend of the Meddygon Myddfai again introduces the elfin cattle to
our notice, but combines with them another and a very interesting form
of this superstition, namely, that of the wife of supernatural race. A
further feature gives it its name, Meddygon meaning physicians, and the
legend professing to give the origin of certain doctors who were
renowned in the thirteenth century. The legend relates that a farmer in
the parish of Myddfai, Carmarthenshire, having bought some lambs in a
neighbouring fair, led them to graze near Llyn y Fan Fach, on the Black
Mountains. Whenever he visited these lambs three beautiful damsels
appeared to him from the lake, on whose shores they often made
excursions. Sometimes he pursued and tried to catch them, but always
failed; the enchanting nymphs ran before him and on reaching the lake
taunted him in these words:

Cras dy fara,  
Anhawdd ein dala;

which, if one must render it literally, means:

Bake your bread,  
'Twill be hard to catch us;

but which, more poetically treated, might signify

Mortall, who eatest baken bread,  
Not for thee is the fairy's bed!

One day some moist bread from the lake came floating ashore. The farmer
seized it, and devoured it with avidity. The following day, to his great
delight, be was successful in his chase, and caught the nymphs on the
shore. After talking a long time with them, he mustered up the courage
to propose marriage to one of them. She consented to accept him on
condition that he would distinguish her from her sisters the next day.
This was a new and great difficulty to the young farmer, for the damsels
were so similar in form and features, that he could scarcely see any
difference between them. He noted, however, a trifling singularity in
the strapping of the chosen one's sandal, by which he recognized her on
the following day. As good as her word, the gwraig immediately left the
lake and went with him to his farm. Before she quitted the lake she
summoned therefrom to attend her, seven cows, two oxen, and one bull.
She stipulated that she should remain with the farmer only until such
time as he should strike her thrice without cause. For some years they
dwelt peaceably together, and she bore him three sons, who were the
celebrated Meddygon Myddfai. One day, when preparing for a fair in the
neighbourhood) the farmer desired her to go to the held for his horse.
She said she would, but being rather dilatory, he said to her humorously
Dos, dos, dos,' i.e., 'Go, go, go,' and at the same time slightly tapped
her arm three times with his glove.

... The blows were slight--but they were blows. The terms of the
marriage contract were broken, and the dame departed, summoning with her
her seven cows, her two oxen, and the bull. The oxen were at that moment
ploughing in the field, but they immediately obeyed her call and dragged
the plough after them to the lake. The furrow, from the field in which
they were ploughing to the margin of the lake, is still to be seen--in
several parts of that country--at the present day. After her departure,
the gwraig annwn once met her three sons in the valley now called Cwm
Meddygon, and gave them a magic box containing remedies of wonderful
power, through whose use they became celebrated. Their names were
Cadogan, Gruffydd and Emion, and the farmer's name was Rhiwallon.
Rhiwallon and his sons, named as above, were physicians to Rhys Gryg,
Lord of Dynevor, and son of the last native prince of Wales. They lived
about 1230, and dying, left behind them a compendium of their medical
practice. 'A copy of their works is in the Welsh School Library in
Gray's Inn Lane.' \['Cambro Briton,' ii., 315\]

V.

In a more polished and elaborate form this legend omits the medical
features altogether, but substitutes a number of details so peculiarly
Welsh that I cannot refrain from presenting them. This version relates
that the enamoured farmer had heard of the lake maiden, who rowed up and
down the lake in a golden boat, with a golden oar. Her hair was long and
yellow, and her face was pale and melancholy. In his desire to see this
wondrous beauty, the farmer went on New Year's Eve to the edge of the
lake, and in silence awaited the coming of the first hour of the new
year. It came, and there in truth was the maiden in her golden boat,
rowing softly to and fro. Fascinated, he stood for hours beholding her,
until the stars faded out of the sky, the moon sank behind the rocks,
and the cold gray dawn drew nigh; and then the lovely gwraig began to
vanish from his sight. Wild with passion, and with the thought of losing
her for ever, he cried aloud to the retreating vision, 'Stay! stay Be my
wife.' But the gwraig only uttered a faint cry, and was gone. Night
after night the young farmer haunted the shores of the lake, but the
gwraig returned no more. He became negligent of his person; his once
robust form grew thin and wan; his face was a map of melancholy and
despair. He went one day to consult a soothsayer who dwelt on the
mountain, and this grave personage advised him to besiege the damsel's
heart with gifts of bread and cheese. This counsel commending itself
strongly to his Welsh way of thinking, the farmer set out upon an
assiduous course of casting his bread upon the waters, accompanied by
cheese. He began on Midsummer eve by going to the lake and dropping
therein a large cheese and a loaf of bread. Night after night he
continued to throw in loaves and cheeses, but nothing appeared in answer
to his sacrifices. His hopes were set, however, on the approaching New
Year's eve. The momentous night arrived at last. Clad in his best array,
and armed with seven white loaves and his biggest and handsomest cheese,
he set out once more for the lake.

<span id="img_06"></span> ![](img/06.jpg)

There he waited till midnight, and then slowly and solemnly dropped the
seven loaves into the water, and with a sigh sent the cheese to keep
them company. His persistence was at length rewarded. The magic skiff
appeared; the fair gwraig guided it to where he stood; stepped ashore,
and accepted him as her husband. The before-mentioned stipulation was
made as to the blows; and she brought her dower of cattle. One day,
after they had been four years married, they were invited to a
christening. In the midst of the ceremony the gwraig burst into tears.
Her husband gave her an angry look, and asked her why she thus made a
fool of herself. She replied, 'The poor babe is entering a world of sin
and sorrow; misery lies before it. Why should I rejoice?' He pushed her
pettishly away. ' I warn you, husband,' said the gwraig; ' you have
struck me once.' After a time they were bidden to the funeral of the
child they had seen christened. Now the gwraig laughed, sang, and danced
about. The husband's wrath again arose, and again he asked her why she
thus made a fool of herself. She answered, 'The dear babe has escaped
the misery that was before it' and gone to be good and happy for ever.
Why should I grieve?' Again he pushed her from him, and again she warned
him; he had struck her twice. Soon they were invited to a wedding; the
bride was young and fair, the groom a tottering, toothless, decrepit old
miser. In the midst of the wedding feast the gwraig annwn burst into
tears, and to her husband's question why she thus made a fool of herself
she replied, 'Truth is wedded to age for greed, and not for love-summer
and winter cannot agree--it is the diawl's compact.' The angry husband
thrust her from him for the third and last time. She looked at him with
tender love and reproach, and said, 'The three blows are struck-husband,
farewell!' He never saw her more, nor any of the flocks and herds she
had brought him for her dowry.

In its employment of the myth to preach a sermon, and in its
introduction of cheese, this version of the legend is very Welsh indeed.
The extent to which cheese figures in Cambrian folk-lore is surprising;
cheese is encountered in every sort of fairy company; you actually meet
cheese in the Mabinogion, along with the most romantic forms of beauty
known in story. And herein again is illustrated Shakespeare's accurate
knowledge of the Cambrian goblins. Heaven defend me from that Welsh
fairy!' says Falstaff, 'lest he transform me to a piece of cheese
'\['Merry Wives of Windsor', Act. V., Sc. 5\] Bread is found figuring
actively in the folk-lore of every country, especially as a sacrifice to
water-gods; but cheese is, so far as I know, thus honoured only in
Cambria.

VI\.

Once more this legend appears, this time with a feature I have nowhere
else encountered in fairy land, to wit, the father of a fairy damsel.
The son of a farmer on Drws Coed farm was one foggy day looking after
his father's sheep, when crossing a marshy meadow he beheld a little
lady behind some rising ground. She had yellow hair, blue eyes and rosy
cheeks. He approached her, and asked permission to converse; whereupon
she smiled sweetly and said to him, 'Idol of my hopes, you have come at
last!' They there and then began to 'keep company,' and met each other
daily here and there along the farm meadows. His intentions were
honourable; he desired her to marry him. He was sometimes absent for
days together, no one knew where, and his friends whispered about that
he had been witched. Around the Turf Lake (Llyn y Dywarchen) was a grove
of trees, and under one of these one day the fairy promised to be his.
The consent of her father was now necessary. One moonlight night an
appointment was made to meet in this wood. The father and daughter did
not appear till the moon had disappeared behind the hill. Then they both
came. The fairy father immediately gave his consent to the marriage, on
one condition, namely, that her future husband should never hit her with
iron. ' If ever thou dost touch her flesh with iron she shall be no more
thine, but she shall return to her own.' They were married--a
good-looking pair. Large sums of money were brought by her, the night
before the wedding, to Dnvs Coed. The shepherd lad became wealthy, had
several handsome children, and they were very happy. After some years,
they were one day out riding, when her horse sank in a deep mire, and by
the assistance of her husband, in her hurry to remount, she was struck
on her knee by the stirrup of the saddle. Immediately voices were heard
singing on the brow of the hill, and she disappeared, leaving all her
children behind. She and her mother devised a plan by which she could
see her beloved, but as she was not allowed to walk the earth with man,
they floated a large turf on the lake, and on this turf she stood for
hours at a time holding converse with her husband. This continued until
his death \['Cymru Fu,' 476\].

VII

The didactic purpose again appears in the following legend, which,
varying but little in phraseology, is current in the neighbourhood of a
dozen different mountain lakes: In other days, before the Cymry had
become reconciled to their Saxon foe, on every New Year's morning a door
was found open in a rock hard by the lake. Those mortals who had the
curiosity and the resolution to enter this door were conducted by a
secret passage to a small island in the middle of the lake. Here they
found a most enchanting garden, stored with the choicest fruits and
flowers, and inhabited by the Gwragedd Annwn, whose beauty could be
equalled only by the courtesy and affability which they exhibited to
those who pleased them. They gathered fruit and flowers for each of
their guests, entertained them with the most exquisite music, disclosed
to them many secrets of futurity, and invited them to stay as long as
they liked. 'But,' said they, ' the island is secret, and nothing of its
produce must be carried away.' The warning being heeded, all went well.
But one day there appeared among the visitors a wicked Welsh-man, who,
thinking to derive some magical aid therefrom, pocketed a flower with
which he had been presented, and was about to leave the garden with his
prize. But the theft boded him no good. As soon as he had touched
unhallowed ground the flower vanished, and he lost his senses. However,
of this abuse of their hospitality the Gwragedd Annwn took no notice at
the time. They dismissed their guests with their accustomed courtesy,
and the door was closed as usual. But their resentment was bitter; for
though the fairies of the lake and their enchanted garden undoubtedly
occupy the spot to this day, the door which led to the island has never
been reopened.

VIII

In all these legends the student of comparative folk-lore traces the
ancient mythology, however overlain with later details. The
water-maidens of every land doubtless originally were the floating
clouds of the sky, or the mists of the mountain. From this have come
certain fair and fanciful creations with which Indo-European folk-lore
teems, the most familiar of which are Undine, Melusina, Nausicaa, and
the classic Muse. In Wales, as in other lands, the myth has many forms.
The dispersion of dark clouds from the mountains, by the beams of the
rising sun, or the morning breezes, is localized in tile legend of the
Men of Ardudwy. These men make a raid on the maidens of the Vale of
Clwyd, and are pursued and slaughtered by the latter's fathers and
brothers. The maidens thereupon cast themselves headlong into the lake,
which is thenceforth called the Maidens Lake, or Llyn y Morwynion. In
another legend, the river mist over the Cynwal is the spirit of a
traitress who perished long ago in the lake. She had conspired with the
sea-born pirates of the North (the ocean storms) to rob her Cambrian
lord of his domains. She was defeated by the aid of a powerful enchanter
(the sun), and fled up the river to the lake, accompanied by her
maidens, who were drowned with her there. \['Arch. Camb.,' 4th Se.,
vii., 251\]

IX\.

As the mermaid superstition is seemingly absent in Wales, so there are
no fairy tales of maidens who lure mortals to their doom beneath the
water, as the Dracae did women and children, and as the Nymph of the
Lurley did marriageable young men. But it is believed that there are
several old Welsh families who are the descendants of the Gwragedd
Annwn, as in the case of the Meddygon Myddfai. The familiar Welsh name
of Morgan is sometimes thought to signify, 'Born of the Sea.' Certainly
môr in Welsh means sea, and gân a birth. It is curious, too, that a
mermaid is called in Basse Bretagne 'Mary Morgan.' But the class of
stories in which a mortal marries a water-maiden is large, and while the
local details smack of the soil, the general idea is so like in lands
far remote from each other as to indicate a common origin in
pre-historic times. In Wales, where the mountain lakes are numerous,
gloomy, lonely, and yet lovely; where many of them, too, show traces of
having been inhabited in ancient times by a race of lake-dwellers, whose
pile-supported villages vanished ages ago; and where bread and cheese
are as classic as beer and candles, these particulars are localized in
the legend. In the Faro Islands, where the seal is a familiar yet
ever-mysterious object, with its human-like eyes, and glossy skin, the
wife of supernatural race is a transformed seal. She comes ashore every
ninth night, sheds her skin, leaves it on the shore, and dances with her
fairy companions. A mortal steals her sealskin dress, and when day
breaks, and her companions return to their abode in the sea, compels her
to remain and be his wife. Some day he offends her; she recovers her
skin and plunges into the sea. In China, the superstition appears in a
Lew-chewan legend mentioned by Dr. Dennys, \['Folk-Lore of China,' 99\]
which relates how a fairy in the guise of a beautiful woman is found
bathing in a man's well. He persuades her to marry him, and she remains
with him for nine years, at the end of which time, despite the affection
she has for their two children, she 'glides upwards into a cloud' and
disappears.
