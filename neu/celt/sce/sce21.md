11\. THESE Subterraneans have Controverƒies, Doubts, Diƒputs, Feuds, and
Siding of Parties; there being ƒome Ignorance in all Creatures, and the
vaƒteƒt created Intelligences not compaƒƒing all Things. As to Vice and
Sin, whatever their own Laws be, ƒure, according to ours, and Equity,
natural, civil, and reveal'd, they tranƒgreƒs and commit Acts of
Injuƒtice, and Sin, by what is above ƒaid, as to their ƒtealling of
Nurƒes to their Children, and that other ƒort of Plaginiƒm in catching
our Children away, (may ƒeem to heir ƒome Eƒtate in thoƒe inviƒible
Dominions,) which never returne. For the Inconvenience of their Succubi,
who tryƒt with Men, it is abominable; but for Swearing and Intemperance,
they are not obƒerved ƒo ƒubjct to thoƒe Irregularities, as to Envy,
Spite, Hypocracie, Lieing, and Diƒƒimulation.
