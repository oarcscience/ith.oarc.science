# DEDICATION

### TO

### ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON,

O Louis! you that like them maist,  
Ye're far frae kelpie, wraith, and ghaist,  
And fairy dames, no unco chaste,  
       And haunted cell.  
Among a heathen clan ye're placed,  
       That kens na hell!

Ye hae nae heather, peat, nor birks,  
Nae troot in a' your burnies lurks,  
There are nae bonny U. P. kirks,  
       An awfa' place!  
Nane kens the Covenant o' Works  
       Frae that of Grace!

But whiles, maybe, to them ye'll read  
Blads o' the Covenanting creed,  
And whiles their pagan wames ye'll feed  
       On halesome parritch;  
And sync ye'll gar them learn a screed  
       O' the Shorter Carritch.

Yet thae uncovenanted shavers  
Hae rowth, ye say, o' clash and clavers  
O' gods and etins--auld wives' havers,  
       But their delight ;  
The voice d him that tells them quavers  
       Just wi' fair fright.

And ye might tell, ayont the faem,  
Thae Hieland clashes o' oor hame.  
To speak the truth, I tak' na shame  
       To half believe them;  
And, stamped wi' TUSITALA'S name,  
       They'll a' receive them.

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

 

And folk to come, ayont the sea,  
May hear the yowl of the Banshie,  
And frae the water-kelpie flee,  
        Ere a' things cease,  
And island bairns may stolen be  
        By the Folk o' Peace.

Faith, they might steal *me*, wi' ma will,  
And, ken'd I ony Fairy hill,  
I'd lay me down there, snod and still,  
        Their land to win,  
For, man, I've maistly had my fill  
        O' this world's din.

### The Fairy Minister

IN MEMORY OF  
THE: REV. ROBERT KIRK,  
*WHO WENT TO HIS OWN HERD*, AND ENTERED INTO  
THE LAND OF THE PEOPLE OF PEACE,  
IN THE YEAR OF GRACE SIXTEEN  
HUNDRED AND NINETY-TWO,  
AND OF HIS AGE  
FIFTY-TWO.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

People of Peace! A peaceful man,  
  Well worthy of your love was he,  
Who, while the roaring Garry ran  
  Red with the life-blood of Dundee,  
While coats were turning, crowns were falling,  
  Wandered along his valley still,  
And heard your mystic voices calling  
  From fairy knowe and haunted hill.  
He heard, he saw, he knew too well  
  The secrets of your fairy clan;  
You stole him from the haunted dell,  
  Who never more was seen of man.  
Now far from heaven, and safe from hell,  
  Unknown of earth, he wanders free.  
Would that he might return and tell  
  Of his mysterious company!  
For we have tired the Folk of Peace  
  No more they tax our corn and oil  
Their dances on the moorland cease,  
  The Brownie stints his wonted tail.  
No more shall any shepherd meet  
  The ladies of the fairy clan,  
Nor are their deathly kisses sweet  
  On lips of any earthly man.  
And half I envy him who now,  
  Clothed in her Court's enchanted green,  
By moonlit loch or mountain's brow  
  Is Chaplain to the Fairy Queen.  
                                       A. L.
