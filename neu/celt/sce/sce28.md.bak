### NOTE.

IN trying to collect evidence as to the Rerrick "evil spirit" from
Kirk-Session Records, I have been most kindly assisted by the Rev. Mr.
M'Conachie, Minister of Rerrick. Mr. M'Conachie finds that only two
parishes in the Stewartry, Kells and Girthon, have records containing
the years 1695, 1696. The records of Rerrick do not go so far back. We
are therefore left to the pamphlet of 1696, by Telfair, which is an
unusually business-like statement, the names of attesting witnesses
being added in the marginal notes. For phenomena similarly similar to
those of Rerrick, *Obeah*, by Mr. H. J. Bell, may be consulted.
(*Obeah*, Sampson Low & Co., London, 1889, p. 93.)
