THESE Subterraneans have Controver&#131;ies, Doubts, Di&#131;puts, Feuds, and Siding of Parties; there being &#131;ome Ignorance in all Creatures, and the va&#131;te&#131;t created Intelligences not compa&#131;&#131;ing all Things. As to Vice and Sin, whatever their own Laws be, &#131;ure, according to ours, and Equity, natural, civil, and reveal'd, they tran&#131;gre&#131;s and commit Acts of Inju&#131;tice, and Sin, by what is above &#131;aid, as to their &#131;tealling of Nur&#131;es to their Children, and that other &#131;ort of Plagini&#131;m in catching our Children away, (may &#131;eem to heir &#131;ome E&#131;tate in tho&#131;e invi&#131;ible Dominions,) which never returne. For the Inconvenience of their Succubi, who try&#131;t with Men, it is abominable; but for Swearing and Intemperance, they are not ob&#131;erved &#131;o &#131;ubjct to tho&#131;e Irregularities, as to Envy, Spite, Hypocracie, Lieing, and Di&#131;&#131;imulation.</P>
