7\. THEY are ƒaid to have ariƒtocraticall Rulers and Laws, but no
diƒcernible Religion, Love, or Devotion towards God, the bleƒƒed Maker
of all: they diƒappear whenever they hear his Name invocked, or the Name
of JESUS, (at

which

which all do bow willinglie, or by conƒtraint, that dwell above or
beneath within the Earth, Philip. 2. 10;) nor can they act ought at that
Time after hearing of that ƒacred Name. The TABHAISVER, or Seer, that
correƒponds with this kind of Familiars, can bring them with a Spel to
appear to himƒelfe or others when he pleaƒes, as readily as Endor Witch
to thoƒe of her Kind. He tells, they are ever readieƒt to go on hurtfull
Errands, but ƒeldome will be the Meƒƒengers of great Good to Men. He is
not terrified with their Sight when he calls them, but ƒeeing them in a
ƒurpryze (as often he does) frights him extreamly. And glaid would he be
quite of ƒuch, for the hideous Spectacles ƒeen among them; as the
torturing of ƒome Wight, earneƒt ghoƒtly ƒtairing Looks, Skirmiƒhes, and
the like. They do not all the Harme which appearingly they have Power to
do; nor are they perceaved to be in great Pain, ƒave that they are
uƒewally ƒilent and ƒullen. They are ƒaid to have many pleaƒant toyiƒh
Books; but the operation of theƒe Peices only appears in ƒome Paroxiƒms
of antic corybantic Jolity, as if

raviƒht and prompted by a new Spirit entering into them at that Inƒtant,
lighter and mirrier than their own. Other Books they have of involved
abƒtruƒe Senƒe, much like the Roƒurcian \[Roƒycrucian\] Style. They have
nothing of the Bible, ƒave collected Parcells for Charms and counter
Charms; not to defend themƒelves withall, but to operate on other
Animals, for they are a People invulnerable by our Weapons; and albeit
Were-wolves and Witches true Bodies are (by the union of the Spirit of
Nature that runs thorow all, echoing and doubling the Blow towards
another) wounded at Home, when the aƒtrial aƒƒumed Bodies are ƒtricken
elƒewhere; as the Strings of a Second Harp, tune to ane uniƒon, Sounds,
though only ane be ƒtruck; yet theƒe People have not a ƒecond, or ƒo
groƒs a Bodie at all, to be ƒo pierced; but as Air, which when divyded
units againe; or if they feel Pain by a Blow, they are better Phyƒicians
than wee, and quickly cure it. They are not ƒubject to ƒore Sickneƒƒes,
but dwindle and decay at a certain Period, all about ane Age. Some ƒay
their continual Sadneƒs is becauƒe of

their

their pendulous State, (like thoƒe Men, Luc. 13. 2. 6.) as uncertain
what at the laƒt Revolution will become of them, when they are lock't up
into ane unchangeable Condition; and if they have any frolic Fitts of
Mirth, 'tis as the conƒtrained grinning of a Mort-head, or rather as
acted on a Stage, and moved by another, ther \[than?\] cordially comeing
of themƒelves. But other Men of the Second Sight, being illiterate, and
unwary in their Obƒervations, learn from thoƒe; one averring thoƒe
ƒubterranean People to be departed Souls, attending awhile in this
inferior State, and clothed with Bodies procured throwgh their Almƒdeeds
in this Lyfe; fluid, active, ætheriall Vehicles to hold them, that they
may not ƒcatter, or wander, and be loƒt in the Totum, or their firƒt
Nothing; but if any were ƒo impious as to have given no Alms, they ƒay
when the Souls of ƒuch do depairt, they ƒleep in an unaictve State till
they reƒume the terreƒtriall Bodies again: others, that what the
Low-countrey Scotts calls a Wreath, and the Irish TAIBHSHE <span

Time, will be pacified by the Death of any other Creature inƒtead of the

(as is ƒaid,) that ƒurelie theƒe are a numerous People by them ƒelves,
having their own Polities. Which Diverƒities of Judgments may occaƒion
ƒeverall Inconƒonancies in this Rehearƒall, after the narroweƒt Scrutiny
made about it.
