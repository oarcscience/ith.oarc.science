3\. THEY are clearly ƒeen by theƒe Men of the SECOND SIGHT to eat at
Funeralls \[and\] Banquets; hence many of the Scottiƒh-Iriƒh will not

teaƒt

teaƒt Meat at theƒe Meittings, leƒt they have Communion with, or be
poyƒoned by, them. So are they ƒeen to carrie the Beer or Coffin with
the Corps among the midle-earth Men to the Grave. Some Men of that
exalted Sight (whither by Art or Nature) have told me they have ƒeen at
theƒe Meittings a Doubleman, or the Shape of ƒome Man in two places;
that is, a ƒuperterranean and a ƒubterranean Inhabitant, perfectly
reƒembling one another in all Points, whom he notwithƒtanding could
eaƒily diƒtinguiƒh one from another, by ƒome ƒecret Tockens and
Operations, and ƒo go ƒpeak to the Man his Neighbour and Familiar,
paƒƒing by the Apparition or Reƒemblance of him. They avouch that every
Element and different State of Being have Animals reƒembling theƒe of
another Element; as there be Fiƒhes ƒometimes at Sea reƒembling Monks of
late Order in all their Hoods and Dreƒƒes; ƒo as the Roman invention of
good and bad Dæmons, and guardian Angells particularly aƒƒigned, is
called by them an ignorant Miƒtake, ƒprung only from this Originall.
They call this Reflex-man a Co-walker, every way like the

Man,

\[paragraph continues\] Man, as a Twin-brother and Companion, haunting
him as his ƒhadow, as is oft ƒeen and known among Men (reƒembling the
Originall,) both before and after the Originall is dead, and wes alƒo
often ƒeen of old to enter a Hous, by which the People knew that the
Perƒon of that Liknes wes to Viƒite them within a few days. This Copy,
Echo, or living Picture, goes att laƒt to his own Herd. It accompanied
that Perƒon ƒo long and frequently for Ends beƒt known to it ƒelfe,
whither to guard him from the ƒecret Aƒƒaults of ƒome of its own Folks,
or only as ane ƒportfull Ape to counterfeit all his Actions. However,
the Stories of old WITCHES prove beyond contradiction, that all Sorts of
People, Spirits which aƒƒume light aery Bodies, or crazed Bodies coacted
by forrein Spirits, ƒeem to have ƒome Pleaƒure, (at leaƒt to aƒƒwage
from Pain or Melancholy,) by friƒking and capering like Satyrs, or
whiƒtling and ƒcreeching (like unlukie Birds) in their unhallowed
Synagogues and Sabboths. If invited and earneƒtly required, theƒe
Companions make themƒelves knowne and familiar to Men; other wiƒe, being

in a different State and Element, they nather can nor will eaƒily
converƒe with them. They avouch that a Heluo, or Great-eater, hath a
voracious Elve to be his attender, called a Joint-eater or Juƒt-halver,
feeding on the Pith or Quinteƒƒence of what the Man eats; and that
therefoir he continues Lean like a Hawke or Heron, notwith ƒtanding his
devouring Appetite: yet it would ƒeem that they convey that ƒubƒtance
elƒewhere, for theƒe Subterraneans eat but little in their Dwellings;
there Food being exactly clean, and ƒerved up by Pleaƒant Children, lyke
inchanted Puppets. What Food they extract from us is conveyed to their
Homes by ƒecret Paths, as ƒume ƒkilfull Women do the Pith and Milk from
their Neighbours Cows into their own Chiefe-hold thorow a Hair-tedder,
at a great Diƒtance, by Airt Magic, or by drawing a ƒpickot faƒtened to
a Poƒt which will bring milk as farr of as a Bull will be heard to
roar. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) The Chiefe made of the
remaineing Milk of a Cow thus ƒtrain'd will ƒwim in Water like a Cork.
The Method they take to recover their Milk is a

bitter chyding of the ƒuƒpected Inchanters, charging them by a counter
Charme to give them back their own, in God, or their Maƒter's Name. But
a little of the Mother's Dung ƒtroakit on the Calves Mouth before it
ƒuck any, does prevent this theft.
