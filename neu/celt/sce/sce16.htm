<P>6. THERE Men travell much abroad, either pre&#131;aging or aping the di&#131;mall and tragicall Actions of &#131;ome among&#131;t us; and have al&#131;o many di&#131;a&#131;torous Doings of their own, as Convocations, Fighting, Ga&#131;hes, Wounds, and Burialls, both in the Earth and Air. They live much longer than wee; yet die at la&#131;t, or [at] lea&#131;t vani&#131;h from that State. 'Tis ane of their Tenets, that nothing peri&#131;heth, but (as the Sun and Year) every Thing goes in a Circle, le&#131;&#131;er or greater, and is renewed and refre&#131;hed in its Revolutions; as 'tis another, that every Bodie in the Creation moves, (which is a &#131;ort of Life;) and that nothing moves, but [h]as another Animal moving on it; and &#131;o on, to the utmo&#131;t minute&#131;t Corpu&#131;cle that's capable to be a Receptacle of Life.</P>
