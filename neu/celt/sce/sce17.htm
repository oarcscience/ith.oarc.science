<P>7. THEY are &#131;aid to have ari&#131;tocraticall Rulers and Laws, but no di&#131;cernible Religion, Love, or Devotion towards God, the ble&#131;&#131;ed Maker of all: they di&#131;appear whenever they hear his Name invocked, or the Name of JESUS, (at</P>

<P>which all do bow willinglie, or by con&#131;traint, that dwell above or beneath within the Earth, Philip. 2. 10;) nor can they act ought at that Time after hearing of that &#131;acred Name. The TABHAISVER, or Seer, that corre&#131;ponds with this kind of Familiars, can bring them with a Spel to appear to him&#131;elfe or others when he plea&#131;es, as readily as Endor Witch to tho&#131;e of her Kind. He tells, they are ever readie&#131;t to go on hurtfull Errands, but &#131;eldome will be the Me&#131;&#131;engers of great Good to Men. He is not terrified with their Sight when he calls them, but &#131;eeing them in a &#131;urpryze (as often he does) frights him extreamly. And glaid would he be quite of &#131;uch, for the hideous Spectacles &#131;een among them; as the torturing of &#131;ome Wight, earne&#131;t gho&#131;tly &#131;tairing Looks, Skirmi&#131;hes, and the like. They do not all the Harme which appearingly they have Power to do; nor are they perceaved to be in great Pain, &#131;ave that they are u&#131;ewally &#131;ilent and &#131;ullen. They are &#131;aid to have many plea&#131;ant toyi&#131;h Books; but the operation of the&#131;e Peices only appears in &#131;ome Paroxi&#131;ms of antic corybantic Jolity, as if</P>

Other Books they have of involved ab&#131;tru&#131;e Sen&#131;e, much like the Ro&#131;urcian [Ro&#131;ycrucian] Style. They have nothing of the Bible, &#131;ave collected Parcells for Charms and counter Charms; not to defend them&#131;elves withall, but to operate on other Animals, for they are a People invulnerable by our Weapons; and albeit Were-wolves and Witches true Bodies are (by the union of the Spirit of Nature that runs thorow all, echoing and doubling the Blow towards another) wounded at Home, when the a&#131;trial a&#131;&#131;umed Bodies are &#131;tricken el&#131;ewhere; as the Strings of a Second Harp, tune to ane uni&#131;on, Sounds, though only ane be &#131;truck; yet the&#131;e People have not a &#131;econd, or &#131;o gro&#131;s a Bodie at all, to be &#131;o pierced; but as Air, which when divyded units againe; or if they feel Pain by a Blow, they are better Phy&#131;icians than wee, and quickly cure it. They are not &#131;ubject to &#131;ore Sickne&#131;&#131;es, but dwindle and decay at a certain Period, all about ane Age. Some &#131;ay their continual Sadne&#131;s is becau&#131;e of</P>

But other Men of the Second Sight, being illiterate, and unwary in their Ob&#131;ervations, learn from tho&#131;e; one averring tho&#131;e &#131;ubterranean People to be departed Souls, attending awhile in this inferior State, and clothed with Bodies procured throwgh their Alm&#131;deeds in this Lyfe; fluid, active, &aelig;theriall Vehicles to hold them, that they may not &#131;catter, or wander, and be lo&#131;t in the Totum, or their fir&#131;t Nothing; but if any were &#131;o impious as to have given no Alms, they &#131;ay when the Souls of &#131;uch do depairt, they &#131;leep in an unaictve State till they re&#131;ume the terre&#131;triall Bodies again: others, that what the Low-countrey Scotts calls a Wreath, and the Irish TAIBHSHE&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or Death's Me&#131;&#131;enger, (ap-</P>
