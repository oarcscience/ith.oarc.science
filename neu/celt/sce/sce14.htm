<P>4. THEIR Hou&#131;es are called large and fair, and (unle&#131;s att &#131;ome odd occa&#131;ions) unperceaveable by vulgar eyes, like Rachland, and other inchanted I&#131;lands, having fir Lights, continual Lamps, and Fires, often &#131;een without Fuel to &#131;u&#131;tain them. Women are yet alive who tell they were taken away when in Child-bed to nur&#131;e Fairie Children, a lingering voracious Image of their (them?) being left in their place, (like their Reflexion in a Mirrour,) which (as if it were &#131;ome in&#131;atiable Spirit in ane a&#131;&#131;umed Bodie) made fir&#131;t &#131;emblance to devour the Meats that it cunningly carried by, and then left the Carca&#131;e as if it expired and departed thence by a naturall and common Death. The Child, and Fire, with Food and other Nece&#131;&#131;aries, are &#131;et before the Nur&#131;e how &#131;oon &#131;he enters; but &#131;he nather perceaves any Pa&#131;&#131;age</P>

<P>out, nor &#131;ees what tho&#131;e People doe in other Rooms of the Lodging. When the Child is wained, the Nur&#131;e dies, or is conveyed back, or gets it to her choice to &#131;tay there. But if any Superterraneans be &#131;o &#131;ubtile, as to practice Slights for procuring a Privacy to any of their Mi&#131;teries, (&#131;uch as making u&#131;e of their Oyntments, which as Gyge&#131;'s Ring makes them invi&#131;ible, or nimble, or ca&#131;ts them in a Trance, or alters their Shape, or makes Things appear at a va&#131;t Di&#131;tance, &amp;c.) they &#131;mite them without Paine, as with a Puff of Wind, and bereave them of both the naturall and acquired Sights in the twinkling of ane Eye, (both the&#131;e Sights, where once they come, being in the &#131;ame Organ and in&#131;eparable,) or they &#131;trick them Dumb. The Tramontains to this Day put Bread, the Bible, or a piece of Iron, in Womens Beds when travelling, to &#131;ave them from being thus &#131;tollen; and they commonly report, that all uncouth, unknown Wights are terrifyed by nothing earthly &#131;o much as by cold Iron. They delyver the Rea&#131;on to be that Hell lying betwixt the chill Tempe&#131;ts, and the Fire Brands of &#131;calding</P>
