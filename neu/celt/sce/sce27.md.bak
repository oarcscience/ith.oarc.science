------------------------------------------------------------------------

My LORD, after narrow Inquiƒition, hath delivered many true and
remarkable obƒerves on this Subject; yet to encourage a further
Scrutiny, I crave leave to ƒay,

THAT 1. But a few Women are endued with this Sight in reƒpect of Men,
and their Predictions not ƒo certane.

2\. This Sight is not criminal, ƒince a Man can come by it unawares, and
without his Conƒent; but it is certaine he ƒie more fatall and fearfull
Things than he do gladƒome.

3\. THE Seers avouch, that ƒeveralls who go

to

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

to the *Siths*, (or People at Reƒt, and, in reƒpect of us, in Peace,)
before the natural Period of their Lyfe expyre, do frequently appear to
them.

4\. A VEHEMENT Deƒyre to attain this Airt is very helpfull to the
Inquyrer; and the Species of ane Abƒent Friend, which appears to the
Seers, as clearly as if he had ƒent his lively Picture to preƒent it
ƒelfe before him, is no phantaƒtick Shaddow of a ƒick Apprehenƒion, but
a reality, and a Meƒƒinger, coming for unknown Reaƒons, not from the
originall Similitude of it ƒelfe, but from a more ƒwift and pragmantick
People, which recreat them ƒelves in offering ƒecret Intelligence to
Men, tho generally they are unacquainted with that Kind of
Correƒpondence, as if they had lived in a different element from them.

5\. THO my Collections were written long before I ƒaw My Lord of
Tarbett's, yet I am glad that his deƒcriptions and mine correƒpond ƒo
nearly. The Maid my Lord mentions, who ƒaw her Image ƒtill before her,
ƒuteth with the CO-WALKER named in my Account; which tho

ƒome

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

ƒome, at firƒt Thought, might conjecture to be by the Refraction of a
Cloud or Miƒt, as in the Parelij, (the whole Air and every Drop of Water
being a Mirrour to returne the Species of Things, were our viƒive
Faculty ƒharpe enough to apprehend them,) or a naturall Reflexion, from
the ƒame Reaƒons that an Echo can be redoubled by Airt; yet it were more
faƒable (*(?) fafable in original--JBH*) to impute this Second Sight to
a Quality infuƒed into the Eye by ane Unction: for Witchies have a
ƒleepie Oyntment, that, when applyed, troubles their Fantaƒies,
advancing it to have unuƒuall Figures and Shapes repreƒented to it, as
if it were a Fit of Fanaticiƒm, Hypocondriack Melancholly, or Poƒƒeƒƒion
of ƒome inƒinuating Spirit, raiƒing the Soul beyond its common Strain,
if the palpable Inƒtances and Realities ƒeen, and innocently objected to
the Senƒes did not diƒprove it, make the Matter a palpable Verity, and
no Deception; yet ƒince this Sight can be beƒtowed without Oyntment, or
dangerous Compact, the Qualification is not of ƒo bad an Originall.
Therefore,

6\. By my Lord's good Leave, I preƒume to

ƒay

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

ƒay, that this Sight can be no Quality of the Air nor of the Eyes;
becaus, 1. such as live in the ƒame Air, and ƒie all other Things as
farr off and as clearly, yet have not the SECOND SIGHT. 2. A SEER can
give another Perƒon this Sight tranƒiently, by putting his Hand and Foot
in the Poƒture he requires of him. 3. The unƒullied Eyes of Infants can
naturally perceave no new unaccuƒtomed Objects, but what appear to other
Men, unleƒs exalted and clarified ƒome Way, as Ballaam's Aƒs for a Time;
tho in a Witches Eye the Beholder cannot ƒie his own Image reflected, as
in the Eyes of other People; ƒo that Defect of Objects, as well as
Diverƒities of the Subject, may appear differently on ƒeverall Tempers
and Ages. 4. Tho alƒo ƒome are of ƒo venemous a Conƒtitution, by being
radicated in Envy and Malice, that they pierce and kill (like a
Cockatrice) whatever Creature they firƒt ƒet their Eye on in the
Morning; ƒo was it with Walter Grahame, ƒome Time living in the Paroch
wherein now I am, who killed his own Cow after commending its Fatneƒs,
and

ƒhot

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

ƒhot a Hair with his Eyes, having praiƒed its ƒwiftneƒs, (ƒuch was the
Infection of ane evill Eye;) albeit this was unuƒuall, yet he ƒaw no
Object but what was obvious to other Men as well as to himƒelfe. 5. If
the being tranƒported to live in another Countrey did obƒcure the Second
Sight, nather the Parƒon nor the Maid needed be much troubled for her
Reflex-ƒelfe; a little Peregrination, and going from her wonted Home,
would have ƒalved her Fear. Wherefore,

7\. SINCE the Things ƒeen by the Seers are real Entities, the Preƒages
and Predictions found true, but a few endued with this Sight, and thoƒe
not of bad Lyves, or addicted to Malifices, the true Solution of the
Phænomenon ƒeems rather to be, the courteous Endeavours of our fellow
Creatures in the Inviƒible World to convince us, (in Oppoƒition to
Sadduce's, Socinians, and Atheiƒts,) of a Deity; of Spirits; of a
poƒƒible and harmleƒs Method of Correƒpondence betwixt Men and them,
even in this Lyfe; of their Operation for our Caution and Warning; of
the Orders and Degrees

of

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

of Angells, whereof one Order, with Bodies of Air condenƒed and
curiouƒly ƒhap't, may be nixt to Man, ƒuperior to him in Underƒtanding,
yet unconfirmed; and of their Region, Habitation, and Influences on Man,
greater than that of Starrs on inanimat Bodies; a Knowledge (belike)
reƒerved for theƒe laƒt atheiƒtick Ages, wherein the Profanity of Mens
Lives hath debauched and blinded their Underƒtanding, as to MOSES,
JESUS, and the Prophets, (unleƒs they get Convictions from Things
formerly known,) as from the Regions of the Dead: nor doth the ceaƒing
of the Viƒions, upon the Seers Tranƒmigration into forrein Kingdoms,
make his Lordƒhip's Conjecture of the Quality of the Air and Eye a white
(*while (?)--JBH*) the more probable; but, on the Contrary, it confirms
greatly my Account of ane Inviƒible People, guardian over and care-full
of Men, who have their different Offices and Abilities in diƒtinct
Counterey's, as appears in Dan. 10. 13. viz. about Iƒraels, Grecia's,
and Perƒia's aƒƒiƒtant Princes, whereof who ƒo prevaileth giveth
Dominion and Aƒcendant to his Pupills and Vaƒƒalls over

the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the oppoƒite Armies and Countreys; ƒo that every Countrey and Kingdom
having their topical Spirits, or Powers aƒƒiƒting and governing them,
the SCOTTISH SEER baniƒhed to America, being a Stranger there, as well
to the inviƒible as to the viƒible Inhabitants, and wanting a
Fimiliarity of his former Correƒpondents, he could not have the Favour
and Warnings, by the ƒeverall Viƒions and Predictions which were wont to
be granted him by theƒe Acquantances and Favourites in his own Countrey.
For if what he wont to ƒie were Realities, (as I have made appear,)
'twere too great ane Honour for Scotland to have ƒuch ƒeldom-ƒeen
Watchers and predominant Powers over it alone, acting in it ƒo
expreƒƒly, and all other Nations wholly deƒtitute of the lyke; tho,
without all peradventure, all other People wanted the right Key of their
Cabinet, and the exact Method of Correƒpondence with them, except the
ƒagacious active Scots, as many of them have retained it of a long Time,
and by Surpryƒes and Raptures do often foirtell what in Kyndneƒs is
really repreƒented to them at

ƒeverall

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

ƒeverall Occaƒions. To which Purpoƒe the learned lynx-ey'd Mr. Baxter,
on Rev. 12. 7. writting of the Fight betwixt Michaell and the Dragon,
gives a verie pertinent Note, viz. That he knows not but ere any great
Action (eƒpeciall tragicall) is don on Earth, that firƒt the Battell and
Victory is acted and atchieved in the Air betwixt the good and evill
Spirits: Thus he. It ƒeems theƒe were the mens Guardians; and the lyke
Battells are oft tymes perceav'd in a Loaft (*sic--JBH*) in the
Nycht-time; the Event of which myght eaƒily be repreƒented by ƒome one
of the Number to a Correƒpondent on Earth, as frequently the Report of
great Actions have been more ƒwiftly caried to other Countreys than all
the Airt of us Mortals could poƒƒibly diƒpatch it. St. Auƒtine,
(*Augustine?--JBH*) on Mark, 9. 4. giveth no ƒmall Intimation of this
Truth, averring that Elias appeared with Jeƒus on the Mount in his
proper Bodie, but Moƒes in ane aereall Bodie, aƒƒumed like the Angels
who appeared, and had Ability to eat with Abraham, tho no Neceƒƒity on
the Account of their Bodies. As lyke wife the late Doctrine of the
Pre-exiƒtence

of

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of Souls, living into aereall Vehicles, gives a ƒingular Hint of the
Poƒƒibility of the Thing, if not a direct Prooff of the whole Aƒƒertion;
which yet moreover may be illuminated by diverƒe other Inƒtances of the
lyke Nature, and as wonderfull, beƒides what is above ƒaid. As,

8\. THE inviƒible Wights which haunt Houƒes ƒeem rather to be ƒome of
our ƒubterranean Inhabitants, (which appear often to Men of the Second
Sight,) than evill Spirits or Devills; becauƒe, tho they throw great
Stones, Pieces of Earth and Wood, at the Inhabitants, they hurt them not
at all, as if they acted not malitiouƒly, like Devills at all, but in
Sport, lyke Buffoons and Drolls. All Ages have affoorded ƒome obƒcure
Teƒtimonies of it, as Pythagoras his Doctrine of Tranƒmigration;
Socrates's Dæmon that gave him \[Warning\] of future Dangers; Platoe's
claƒƒing them into various vehiculated Specieƒes of Spirits; Dioniƒius
Areopagita's marƒhalling nyne Orders of Spirits, ƒuperiour and
ƒubordinate; the Poets their borrowing of the Philoƒophers, and add-

ing

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

ing their own Fancies of Fountain, River, and Sea Nymphs, Wood, Hill,
and Montain Inhabitants, and that every Place and Thing, in Cities and
Countreys, had ƒpeciall inviƒible regular Gods and Governours. Cardan
ƒpeaks of his Father his ƒeeing the Species of his Friend, in a
moon-ƒhyn Night, riding fiercely by his Window on a white Horƒe, the
verie Night his Friend dy'd at a Vaƒt Diƒtance from him; by which he
underƒtood that ƒome Alteration would ƒuddenly enƒue. Cornelius
Aggrippa, and the learned Dr. Mor, have ƒeverall Paƒƒages tending that
Way. The Noctambulo's themƒelves would appear to have ƒome forrein
joquing Spirit poƒƒeƒƒing and ƒupporting them, when they walk on deep
Waters and Topes of Houƒes without Danger, when aƒleep and in the dark;
for it was no way probable that their Apprehenƒion, and ƒtrong
Imagination ƒetting the Animal Spirits a work to move the Body, could
preƒerve it from ƒinking in the Deepth, or falling down head-long, when
aƒleep, any more than when awake, the Body being then as ponderous as
before; and it is hard

to

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

to attribute it to a Spirit flatelie evill and Enemy to Man, becauƒe the
Noctambulo returns to his own Place ƒafe. And the moƒt furious Tribe of
the Dæmons are not permitted by Providence to attacke Men ƒo frequently
either by Night or by Day: For in our Highlands, as there may be many
fair Ladies of this aereal Order, which do often tryƒt with laƒcivious
young Men, in the quality of Succubi, or lightƒome Paramours and
Strumpets, called *Leannain Sith*, or familiar Spirits (in Dewter. 18.
11.); ƒo do many of our Hyghlanders, as if a ƒtrangling by the Night
MARE, preƒƒed with a fearfull. Dream, or rather poƒƒeƒƒed by one of our
aereall Neighbours, riƒe up fierce in the Night, and apprehending the
neereƒt Weapons, do puƒh and thruƒt at all Perƒons in the ƒame Room with
them, ƒometymes wounding their own Comerades to dead. The lyke whereof
fell ƒadly out within a few Miles of me at the writting, hereof I add
but one Inƒtance more, of a very young Maid, who lived neir to my laƒt
Reƒidence, that in one Night learned a large Peice of Poeƒy, by

the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the frequent Repetition of it, from one of our nimble and courteous
Spirits, whereof a Part was pious, the reƒt ƒuperƒtitious, (for I have a
Copy of it,) and no other Perƒon was ever heard to repeat it before, nor
was the Maid capable to compoƒe it of herƒelf,

9\. He demonƒtrated and made evident to Senƒe this extraordinary Viƒion
of our Tramontain Seers, and what is ƒeen by them, by what is ƒaid
above, many haveing ƒeen this ƒame Spectres and Apparitions at once,
haveing their viƒive Faculties entire; for *non eƒt diƒputandum de
guƒtu*. Itt now remaines to ƒhew that it is not unfutable to Reaƒon nor
the Holy Scriptures.

FIRST, That it is not repugnant to Reaƒon, doeth appear from this, that
it is no leƒs ƒtrange for Immortal Sparks and Souls to come and be
immerƒed into groƒs terreƒtrial elementary Bodies, and be ƒo propagated,
ƒo nouriƒhed, ƒo fed, ƒoe cloathed as they are, and breathe in ƒuch ane
Air and World prepared for them, then for Hollanders or Hollow-cavern
Inhabitants to live and traffick among us, in another

State

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

State of Being, without our Knowledge. For Raymond de Subinde, in his 3d
Booke, Chap. 12. argues quaintly, that all Sorts of Living Creatures
have a happie rational Politie of there own, with great Contentment;
which Government and mutual Converƒe of theirs they all pride and pluim
themƒelves, becauƒe it is as unknown to Man, as Man is to them. Much
more, that the Sone of the HIGHEST SPIRIT ƒhould aƒƒume a Bodie like
ours, convinces all the World that no other Thing that is poƒƒible needs
be much wondered at.

2\. The Manucodiata, or Bird of Paradiƒe, living in the higheƒt Region
of the Air; common Birds in the ƒecond Region; Flies and Inƒects in the
loweƒt; Men and Beaƒts on the Earth's Surface; Worms, Otters, Badgers,
in Waters; lyke wiƒe Hell is inhabited at the Centre, and Heaven in the
Circumference: can we then think the middle Cavities of the Earth
emptie? I have ƒeen in Weems, (a Place in the Countie of Fyfe, in
Scotland,) divers Caves cut out as vaƒt Temples under Ground; the lyke
is a Countie of England;

in

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

in Malta is a Cave, wherein Stons of a curious Cut are thrown in great
Numbers every Day; ƒo I have had barbed Arrow-heads of yellow Flint,
that could not be cut ƒo ƒmall and neat, of ƒo brittle a Subƒtance, by
all the Airt of Man. It would ƒeem therefoir that theƒe mention'd Works
were done by certaine Spirits of pure Organs, and not by Devills, whoƒe
continual Torments could not allow them ƒo much Leaƒure. Beƒides theƒe,
I have found fyve Curioƒities in Scotland, not much obƒerv'd to be
elƒewhere. 1. The Brounies, who in ƒome Families are Drudges, clean the
Houƒes and Diƒhes after all go to Bed, taking with him his Portion of
Food and removing befor Day-break. 2. The Maƒon Word, which tho ƒome
make a Miƒterie of it, I will not conceal a little of what I know. It is
lyke a Rabbinical Tradition, in way of Comment on Jachin and Boaz, the
two Pillars erected in Solomon's Temple, (1 Kings, 7. 21.) with ane
Addition of ƒome ƒecret Signe delyvered from Hand to Hand, by which they
know and become familiar one with another. 3. This Second

Sight

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

Sight, ƒo largely treated of before. 4. Charmes, and curing by them very
many Diƒeaƒes, ƒometimes by transferring the Sicknes to another. 5. A
being Proof of Lead, Iron, and Silver or a Brieve making Men
invulnerable. Divers of our Scottiƒh Commanders and Souldiers have been
ƒeen with blue Markes only, after they were ƒhot with leaden Balls;
which ƒeems to be an Italian Trick, for they ƒeem to be a People too
currious and magically inclyned. Finally Iris-men, our Northern-Scotiƒh,
and our Athole Men are ƒo much addicted to and delighted with Harps and
Muƒick, as if, like King Saul, they were poƒƒeƒƒed with a forrein
Spirit, only with this Difference, that Muƒick did put Saul's
Pley-fellow a ƒleep, but rouƒed and awaked our Men, vanquiƒhing their
own Spirits at Pleaƒure, as if they were impotent of its Powers, and
unable to command it; for wee have ƒeen ƒome poor Beggers of them,
chattering their Teeth for Cold, that how ƒoon they ƒaw the Fire, and
heard the Harp, leapt thorow the Houƒe like Goats and Satyrs. As there
paralell Stories in all Countries and Ages

reported

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

reported of theƒe our obƒcure People, (which are no Dotages,) ƒo is it
no more of Neceƒƒitie to us fully to know their Beings and Manner of
Life, then to underƒtand diƒtinctly the Politic of the nyne Orders of
Angels; or with what Oyl the Lamp of the Sun is maintained ƒo long and
regularlie; or why the Moon is called a great Luminary in Scripture,
while it only appears to be ƒo; or if the Moon be truly inhabited,
becauƒe Teleƒcopes diƒcover Seas and Mountains in it, as well as flaming
Furniƒhes in the Sun; or why the Diƒcovery of America was look't on as a
Fairie Tale, and the Reporters hooted at as Inventors of ridiculous
Utopias, or the firƒt probable Aƒƒerters puniƒhed as Inventures of new
Gods and Worlds; or why in England the King cures the Struma by
ƒtroaking, and the Seventh Son in Scotland; whither his temperat
Complexion conveys a Balƒome, and ƒucks out the corrupting Principles by
a frequent warme ƒanative Contact, or whither the Parents of the Seventh
Child put furth a more eminent Virtue to his Production than to all the
Reƒt, as being the

certain

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

certain Meridian and hight to which their Vigour aƒcends, and from that
furth have a graduall declyning into a feebleneƒs of the Bodie and its
Production. And then, 1. Why is not the 7th Son infected himƒelfe by
that Contagion he extracts from another? 2. How can continual ƒtroaking
with a cold Hand have ƒoe ƒtrong a natural Operation, as to exhale all
the Infections warming corroding Vapours. 3. Why may not a 7th Daughter
have the ƒame Vertue? So that it appears, albeit, a happie natural
Conƒtitution concurre, yet ƒomething in it above Nature. Therefore every
Age hath left ƒome ƒecret for its Diƒcoverie; who knows but this
Entercourƒe bewixt the two Kinds of rationall Inhabitants of the ƒame
Earth may be not only beleived ƒhortly, but as friely entertain'd, and
as well known, as now the Airt of Navigation, Printing, Limning, riding
on Saddles with Stirrups, and the Diƒcoveries of Microƒcopes, which were
ƒometimes a great a Wonder, and as hard to be beleived.

10\. THO I will not be ƒo curious nor ƒo peremptorie as he who will
prove the Poƒi-

bility

<span id="page_68 ">p. 68</span>

bility of the Philoƒopher's Stone from Scripture, Job, 28. 1. 2. Job,
22. 24. 25.; or the Pluralitie of Worlds, from John, 14. 2. and Hebrews
ii. 3.; nor the Circulation of Blood from Eccles. 12. and 6.; nor the
Taniƒmanical Airt, from the Blind and Lame mentioned in 2d of Samuel, 5.
6. yet I humblie propoƒe theƒe Paƒƒages which may give ƒome Light to our
Subject at leaƒt, and ƒhow that this Polity and Rank of People is not a
Thing impoƒƒible, nor the modeƒt and innocent Scrutiny of them
impertinent or unƒafe. The Legion or Brigad of Spirits (mentioned Mark,
5. 10.) beƒought our Saviour not to ƒend them away out of the Countrey;
which ƒhows they were DÆMONES LOCI, Topical Spirits, and peculiar
Superintendents and Superviƒors aƒƒign'd to that Province. And the Power
over the Nations granted (Rev. 2. 26.) to the Conquerors of Vice and
Infidelitie, Sound ƒomewhat to that Purpoƒe. Tobit had a Dæmon attending
Marriage, Chap. 6. Verƒe, 15; and in Matth. 4. and 5. ane evill Spirit
came in a Viƒible Shape to tempt our Saviour, who himƒelfe

denyed

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

denyed not the ƒenƒible appearing of Ghoƒts to our Sight, but ƒaid,
their Bodies were not compoƒed of Fleƒh and Bones, as ours, Luke, 24-
39. And in Philip. 2. 10. our verie Subterraneans are expreƒƒly ƒaid to
bow to the Name of JESUS. Eliƒha, not intellectually only, but ƒenƒibly,
ƒaw Gehazi when out of the Reach of ane ordinary View. It wants not good
Evidents that there are more managed by God's Spirits, good, evill, and
intermediate Spirits, among Men in this World, then we are aware of; the
good Spirits ingeƒting fair and heroick Apprehenƒions and Images of
Vertue and the divyne Life, thereby animating us to act for a higher
Happines, according to our Improvement; and relinquiƒhing us as
ƒtrangely upon our Neglect, or our embraceing the deceatfull ƒyrene-like
Pictures and Repreƒentations of Pleaƒures and Gain, preƒented to our
Imaginations by evill and ƒportfull Angells, to allure to ane
unthinking, ungenerous, and ƒenƒual Lyfe; non of them having power to
compell us to any Miƒdemeanour without our flat Conƒent. Moreover, this
Life

of

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

of ours being called a Warfair, and God's ƒaying that at laƒt there will
be no Peace to the Wicked, our buƒƒie and ƒilent Companions alƒo being
called *Siths*, or *People at Reƒt and Quiet*, in reƒpect of us; and
withall many Ghoƒts appearing to Men that want this Second Sight, in the
very Shapes, and ƒpeaking the ƒame Language, they did when incorporate
and alive with us; a Matter that is of ane old impreƒcriptible
Tradition, (*our Highlanders* making ƒtill a Diƒtinction betwixt *Sluagh
Saoghalta* and *Sluagh Sith*, averring that the Souls goe to the *Sith*
when diƒlodged;) many real Treaƒures and Murders being diƒcovered by
Souls that paƒs from among our ƒelves, or by the Kindneƒs of theƒe our
airie Neighbours, non of which Spirits can be altogither inorganical. No
leƒs than the Conƒeits about Purgatory, or a State of Reƒcue; the
*Limbus Patrum et Infantum*, Inventions, \[which\] tho miƒapplyed, yet
are not Chimæras, and altogither groundleƒs. For *ab origine*, it is
nothing but blanƒh and faint Diƒcoveries of this SECRET REPUBLICK Of
ours here treated on, and additional Fictions

of

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

of Monks doting and crazied Heads, our Creed ƒaying that our Saviour
deƒcended εἰς ᾅδου, to the inviƒible Place and People. And many Divines
ƒuppoƒing that the Deity appear'd in a viƒible Shape ƒeen by Adam in the
Cooll of the Day, and ƒpeaking to him with ane audible voice. And Jeƒus,
probably by the Miniƒtery of inviƒible Attendants, conveying more meat
of the ƒame Kind to the fyve Thowƒand that wes fed by him with a very
few Loaves and Fiƒhes, (for a new Creation it was not.) The Zijmjiim and
Ochim, in Iƒa. 13. 21. 22. Thes Satyres, and doolfull unknown Creatures
of Iƒlands and Deƒerts, ƒeem to have a plain Proƒpect that Way. Finally,
the eternal Happineƒs enjoyed in the 3d Heavens, being more myƒterious
than moƒt of Men take it to be. It is not a ƒenƒe whollie adduced to
Scripture to ƒay, that this SIGHT, and the due Objects of it, hath ƒome
Veƒtige in holy Write, but rather 'tis modeƒtly deduced from it.

11\. It only now remains to anƒear the obvious Objections againƒt the
Reality and Lawfullneƒs of this Speculation.

Queƒtion

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

QUESTION 1. How do you ƒalve the Second Sight from Compact and
Witchcraft?

ANSWER, Tho this Correƒpondence with the Intermediate Unconfirm'd People
(betwixt Man and Angell) be not ordinary to all of us who are
Superterraneans, yet this SIGHT falling ƒome Perƒons by Accident, and
its being connatural to others from their Birth, the Derivation of it
cannot always be wicked. A too great Curioƒitie, indeed, to acquyre any
unneceƒƒary Airt, may be blameworthy; but diverƒe of the SECRET
COMMONWEALTH may, by Permiƒƒion, diƒcover themƒelves as innocently to
us, who are in another State, as ƒome of us Men do to Fiƒhes, which are
in another Element, when we plunge and dive into the Bottom of the Seas,
their native Region; and in Proceƒs of Time we may come to converƒe as
familiarly with theƒe nimble and agile Clans (but with greater Pleaƒure
and Profit,) as we do now with the Chino's Antipodes.

QUESTION 2. Are they ƒubject to Vice, Lusts? Paƒƒion, and Injuƒtice, as
we who live on the Surface of the Earth?

Anƒwer

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

ANSWER. The Seers tell us that theƒe wandering Aereal People have not
ƒuch an Impetus and fatall Tendency to any Vice as Men, as not being
drenched into ƒo groƒs and dregy Bodies as we, but yet are in ane
imperfect State, and ƒome of them making better Eƒƒays for heroick
Actions than others; having the ƒame Meaƒures of Vertue and Vice as wee,
and ƒtill expecting advancement to a higher and more ƒplendid State of
Lyfe. One of them is ƒtronger than many Men, yet do not incline to hurt
Mankind, except by Commiƒƒion for a groƒs Miƒdemeanour, as the
deƒtroying Angell of Ægypt, and the Aƒƒyrians, Exod. 12. 29. 2 Kings,
10. 35. They haunt moƒt where is moƒt Barbaritie; and therefoir our
ignorant Anceƒtors, to prevent the Inƒults of that ƒtrange People, uƒed
as rude and courƒe a Remedie; ƒuch as Exorciƒms, Donations, and Vows:
But how ƒoon ever the true Piety prevailed in any Place, it did not put
the Inhabitants beyond the Reach and Awthoritie of theƒe ƒubtile
inferiour Co-inhabitants and Colleagues of ours: The FATHER OF ALL
SPIRITS, and the Perƒon

himƒelfe

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

himƒelfe, having the only Command of his Soul and Actions, a concurrance
they may have to what is virtuously done; for upon committing of a foul
Deed, one will find a Demure upon his Soul, as if his cheerfull Collegue
had deƒerted him.

QUESTION 3. Do theƒe airie Tribes procreate? If ƒo, how are they
nouriƒhed, and at what period of Time do they die?

ANSWER. Suppoƒing all Spirits to be created at once in the Beginning,
Souls to pre-exist and to circle about into ƒeveral States of
Probationƒhip; to make them either totally unexcuƒable, or perfectly
happie againƒt the laƒt Day, ƒolves all the Difficulties. But in very
Deed, and ƒpeaking ƒuteable to the Nature of Things, there is no more
Abƒurditie for a Spirit to inform ane Infant in Bodie of Airs, than a
Bodie compoƒed of dull and druƒie Earth; the beƒt of Spirits have
alwayes delyghted more to appear into aereal, than into terreƒtrial
Bodyes. They feed moƒt what on Quinteƒƒences, and aetheriall Eƒƒences.

ficially conveyed, (as Air and Oyl ƒink into our Bodies,) to make them
vigorous and freƒh. And this ƒhorter Way of conveying a pure Aliment,
(without the uƒuall Digeƒtions,) by tranƒfuƒing it, and tranƒpyring
thorow the Pores into the Veins, Arteries, and Veƒƒells that ƒupplie the
Bodie, is nothing more abƒurd, than ane Infant's being fed by the Navel
before it is borne, or than a Plant, which groweth by attracting a
livelie juice from the Earth thorow many ƒmall Roots and Tendons, whose
courƒer Pairts be adapted and made connatural to the Whole, doth quickly
coaleƒce by the ambient Cold; and ƒo are condenƒ'd and bak'd up into a
confirm'd Wood in the one, and ƒolid Bodie of the Fleƒh and Bone in the
other. A Notion which, if intertained and approv'd, may ƒhew that the
late Invention of ƒoaking and tranƒfuƒing (not Blood, but) athereal
virtuall Spirits, may be uƒefull both for Nouriƒhment and Health,
whereof is a Veƒtige in the damnable Practiƒe of evill Angells, their
ƒucking of Blood and Spirits out of Witches Bodys (till they drew them
into a deform'd and dry Leanneƒs,) to ƒeid their own

Vehicles

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Vehicles withall, leaving what we call the
Witches Mark behind; a Spot that I have ƒeen, as a ƒmall Mole, horny,
and brown-coloured; throw which Mark, when a large Braƒs Pin was thruƒt
(both in Buttock, Noƒe, and Rooff of the Mouth,) till it bowed and
become crooked, the Witches, both Men and Women, nather felt a Pain, nor
did bleed, nor knew the preciƒe Time when this was adoing to them,
(there Eyes only being covered.) Now the Air being a Body as well as
Earth, no Reaƒon can be given why there may not be Particles of more
vivific Spirit form'd of it for Procreation, then is poƒƒible to be of
Earth, which takes more Time and Pains to rarify and ripen it, ere it
can come to have a prolific Virtue. And if our Aping Darlings did not
thus procreate, there whole Number would be exhauƒted after a
conƒiderable Space of Time. For tho they are of more refyned Bodies and
Intellectualls than wee, and of far leƒs heavy and corruptive Humours,
(which cauƒe a Diƒƒolution,) yet many of their Lives being diƒƒonant to
right Reaƒon and their own Laws,

and their Vehicles not being wholly frie of Luƒt and Paƒƒion, eƒpecially
of the more ƒpirituall and hautie Sins they paƒs (after a long healthy
Lyfe) into one Orb and Receptacle fitted for their Degree, till they
come under the general Cognizance of the laƒt Day.

QUESTION 4. Doth the acquiring of this Second Sight make any Change on
the Acquirers Body, Mind, or Actions?

ANSWER. All uncouth SIGHTS enfeebles the SEER. Daniel, tho familiar with
divyne Viƒions, yet fell frequently doun without Strength, when dazzled
with a Power which had the Aƒcendant of, and paƒƒed on him beyond his
Comprehenƒion, Chap. 10. 8. 17. So our SEER is put in a Rapture,
Tranƒport, and ƒort of Death, as diveƒted of his Body and all its
Senƒes, when he is firƒt made participant of this curious Peice of
Knowledge: But it maketh no Wramp or Strain in the Underƒtanding of any;
only to the Fancy's of clownish or illiterate Men, it creates ƒome
Affrightments and Diƒturbances, becauƒe of the Strongneƒs of the Showes,
and their Unacquaintedneƒs with them. And as for their

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

their Lyfe, the Perƒons endued with this Rarity are, for the moƒt Part,
candid, honeƒt, and ƒociable People. If any of them be ƒubject to
Immoralities, this obƒtruƒe Skill is not to be blamed for it; for unleƒs
themƒelves be the Tempters, the Colonies of the Inviƒible Plantations,
with which they intercommune, do provoke them by no Villainy or
Malifice, nather at their firƒt Acquaintance nor after a long
Familiarity.

QUESTION 5. Doth not Sathan interpoƒe in ƒuch Caƒes by many ƒubtile
unthought Inƒinuations, as to him who let the Fly, or Familiar, go out
of the Box, and yet found the Fly of his own putting in, as ƒerviceable
as the other would have been?

ANSWER. The Goodneƒs of the Lyfe, and Deƒigns of the ancient Prophets
and Seers, was one of the beƒt Prooffs of their Miƒƒion. <span
