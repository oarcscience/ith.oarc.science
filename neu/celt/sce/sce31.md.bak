bien informée."--M. A. BARTH, in *Mélusine*.

VI\. **THE ATTIS OF CAIUS VALERIUS CATULLUS**. Translated into English

Tree-Worship, and on the Galliambic Metre. By GRANT ALLEN, B.A.,
formerly Postmaster of Merton College, Oxford. (xvi, 154 pp.) 1892.
7*s*. 6*d*.

"The paramount interest of this book lies in its two disquisitions upon
thc meaning of the Attis myth and upon the meaning of
tree-worship."--*Speaker*.

"As a contribution to folk-lore it is of real value and interest, and to
a considerable extent new in the line it takes."--*Literary World*.

"This theory, in which 'the ghost plays . . . the same part that guano
and phosphates play to-day,' when stated thus baldly sounds strange, but
when read in the author's own vivacious narrative, along with the
excellent illustrations which he brings forward, it is singularly
attractive."--*Bookman*.

"Highly interesting, and at this time will probably fall in with
prevailing opinions."--ROBINSON ELLIS in *The Academy*.

"Whether readers adopt Mr. Allen's conclusions or not, all must agree
that he has propounded a most interesting theory, and stated it in a
manner forcible and stimulating to thought."--*Nation*.

PHILEMON HOLLAND. Now again Edited by FRANK BYRON JEVONS, MA., Classical

Eating of Beans. (cxxviii. 170 pp.) 1892. 10*s*.

"Mr. Jevons's essay is learned and interesting, and in some cases he has
probably found out the reason of behaviour which the Romans could not
account for themselves."--Daily News, Jan. 10, 1893.

"All antiquaries and folk-lorists will thank him for enabling them to
peruse in a convenient form that part of Plutarch's 'Moralio' which
bears upon their science."--*Daily Chronicle*, Jan. 6, 1893.

"An admirable essay on Roman religion and on the characteristics of
Aryan religion."--*Glasgow Herald*, Jan. 5, 1893-

"Holland's quaintness and homely vigour make his translations delightful
reading. A most valuable and interesting introduction is supplied by a
sound scholar and shrewd thinker, Mr. F. B. Jevons."--*Athenæum*, Jan.
7, 1893.

"Holland's translation, a delightful piece of Elizabethan English, as
Mr. Jevons says, provides a seemly garb for Plutarch's ancient
reasonings. Mr. Jevons's own contribution to the volume is, as a help
towards a true interpretation, of scarcely less value than the
translation itself."--*Scotsman*, Dec. 26, 1892.

"Mr. Jevons's introduction is at once learned and readable."--*Times*,
Dec. 22, 1892.

"The editor has supplied an excellent commentary upon some of the most
striking parts in a series of dissertations on Italian cults, myths,
taboos, man-worship, Aryan marriage, sympathetic magic, and the eating
of beans. The mere titles of these essays show the curiosity and
interest of the problems dealt with in the text."--*Manchester
Guardian*, Jan. 10, 1893
