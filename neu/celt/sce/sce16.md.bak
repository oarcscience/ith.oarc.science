6\. THERE Men travell much abroad, either preƒaging or aping the diƒmall
and tragicall Actions of ƒome amongƒt us; and have alƒo many diƒaƒtorous
Doings of their own, as Convocations, Fighting, Gaƒhes, Wounds, and
Burialls, both in the Earth and Air. They live much longer than wee; yet
die at laƒt, or \[at\] leaƒt vaniƒh from that State. 'Tis ane of their
Tenets, that nothing periƒheth, but (as the Sun and Year) every Thing
goes in a Circle, leƒƒer or greater, and is renewed and refreƒhed in its
Revolutions; as 'tis another, that every Bodie in the Creation moves,
(which is a ƒort of Life;) and that nothing moves, but \[h\]as another
Animal moving on it; and ƒo on, to the utmoƒt minuteƒt Corpuƒcle that's
capable to be a Receptacle of Life.
