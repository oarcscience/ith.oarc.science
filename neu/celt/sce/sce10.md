OR,

A Treatiƒe diƒplayeing the Chiefe Curioƒities  
as they are in Uƒe among diverƒe of the  
People of Scotland to this Day;  
SINGULARITIES for the  
moƒt Part peculiar to  
that Nation.

A Subject not heretofore diƒcourƒed of by any of our  
Writters; and yet ventured on in an Eƒƒay

Then a Spirit paƒƒed before my Face, the Hair of my Fleƒh ƒtood up; it
ƒtood ƒtill, but I could not diƒcerne the Forme thereof; ane Image was
before mine Eyes.--Job, 4. 15, 16.

This is a REBELLIOUS PEOPLE, which ƒay to the Siers, ƒie not; and to the
Prophets, propheƒie not unto us right Things, bot ƒpeak unto us ƒmoothe
Things.--Iƒaiah, 30. 9, 10.

And the Man whoƒe Eyes were open hath ƒaid.--Numbers, 24. 15.

For now we ƒie thorough a Glaƒs darkly, but then Face to Face.--1
Corinth. 13. 12.

It doth not yet appear what we ƒhall be; but we ƒhall be lyke God, and
ƒie him as he is.--1 John, 3. 2.

Μη γιγιαντες μαιωδησονται ὑποκατωδεν ὑδατος και των γειτονων
αυτον;--Job, 26. 5 (Septuag.).
