### V. FAIRIES AND PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.

The Fairy belief, we have said, is a composite thing. On the materials
given by tradition, such as the memory, perhaps, of a pre-historic race,
and by old religion, as in the thoughts about the pre-Christian Hades,
poetry and fancy have been at work. Consumption, lingering disease,
unexplained disappearances, sudden deaths, have been accounted for by
the agency of the Fairies, or People of Peace. If the superstition
included no more than this, we might regard it as a natural result of
imagination, dealing with facts quite natural in the ordinary course of
things. But there are elements in the belief which cannot be so easily
dismissed. We must ask whether the abnormal phenomena which have been so
frequently discussed, fought over, forgotten, and revived, do not enter
into the general mass of folk-lore. They appear most notably in the two
branches of Browniedom--of "Pixies," as they say in Devonshire, who
haunt the house, and in the

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

alleged examples of the second sight. The former topic is the more
obscure, if not the more curious. Let us examine the occurrences, then,
which may have begotten the belief in Brownies, and in house-haunting
Pixies or Fairies. These appearances may be alleged, on one hand, to be
actual facts in Nature, the workings of some yet unexplained forces; or
they may merely be the consequences of some very old traditional method
of imposture, vulgar in itself, but still historical. That form of
imposture, again, may be wrought either by conscious agents, or
unconsciously and automatically by persons under the influence of
somnambulism; or, finally, the phenomena may in various cases be due to
any one of these three agencies, all of which may possibly be *veræ
causæ*, as conscious imposture and trickery is certainly one *vera
causa*.

In Mr. Kirk's book we meet "the invisible Wights which haunt Houses, . .
. throw great Stones, Pieces of Earth and Wood at the Inhabitants," but
"hurt them not at all." As we have said, Major (1518) calls these wights
"Fauni or Brobne"--that is, Brownies--and says that they thrash as much
grain in one

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

night as twenty men could do, and throw stones about. The legend of
their working was common in Scotland, and a correspondent says that in
Devonshire the belief in Pixies who set the house in order exists among
the grandparents of the present generation. But the sportive is more
common than the kindly aspect of Brownies. Through history we constantly
find them causing objects to move without visible contact, and "acting
in sport, like Buffoons and Drolls." In his *Letters on Demonology* (p.
377) Scott gives instances where the buffoon or droll was detected, and
confessed that the rattlings of plates and movements of objects were
caused by an apparatus of threads or horsehair. He also quotes the
famous doings of "The Just Devil of Woodstock" in 1649, which so
perplexed and discomfited the Cromwellian Commissioners. He accounts for
those annoyances by the confessions of Joe Collins of Oxford, "Funny
Joe," which he quotes from Hone's *Every-Day Book*, while Hone quotes
from the *British Magazine* of 1747. But the writer in the *British
Magazine* gives no references or authorities for the authenticity of
Funny Joe's confessions, nor even for the existence of Joseph.

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Scott could not find his original in the
pamphlets of the British Museum, and some of the statements attributed
to Joe do not tally with the official account, and other contemporary
documents collected in Sir Walter's *Woodstock*. Joe pretends, for
example, to have been secretary to the Commission under the name of
Giles Sharpe; but in the other accounts the secretary is named Browne. A
Royalist Brownie or Polter-geist lies under shrewd suspicion, but Joe's
own existence is unproved, and his alleged evidence is of no value.
However, no sane person can dream of doubting that many a Brownie has
been as much in flesh and blood as the Brownie of Bodsbeck in Hogg's
story.

There remain the less easily explicable tales of strange and humorous
disturbances, accompanied by loud sounds, rappings, the moving of
objects without visible contact, and so forth. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) Perhaps we may best examine these by taking
modern instances, collected by the Psychical Society, in the first
place, and then comparing them with cases recorded at distant times and
in remote places. Some curious common features

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

will be observed, and the evidence has at least the value of undesigned
coincidence. Glanvil, Telfair (minister of Rerrick), the Wesleys, Dr.
Adam Clarke, Increase Mather, were not modern students of psychical
research. The modern Psychical Researchers, we fear, are not students of
old legendary lore, which they dismiss on evidence not first-hand nor
scientifically valid. Thus they do not seem to be aware that they are
describing, almost in identical terms, phenomena identical with those
noted by Telfair, Mather, Lavater, and the rest, and by those ancients
attributed to devils. The modern recorders axe not consciously copying
from old accounts; the coincidences therefore have their value, as
proving that certain phenomena have occurred and recurred. Now those
phenomena may be due to conscious or to hysterical imposture, but they
have been frequent and common enough to keep alive, and probably to
originate, a part of the Fairy belief--that part which is concerned with
Brownies and house-haunting Pixies, or Domovoys. These, again,
correspond to the tricky beings described by Mr. Leland in his *Etruscan
Remains* as survivals of old Roman and Etruscan popular religions, while
we find

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

similar occurrences in the Empire of the Incas not long after the
Spanish conquest of Peru. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

Beginning, then, with what is nearest to us in time, we take Mr. F. W.
H. Myers's essays "On the Alleged Movement of Objects without Contact,
occurring not in the Presence of a Paid Medium." <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) The alleged phenomena are, of course, as
common as blackberries in the presence of paid mediums, but are to the
last degree untrustworthy. Even when there is no paid medium present,
the mere contagious excitement which is said to be developed at
*séances* makes all that is thought to occur there a story to be taken
with plenty of salt. <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md) One of Mr.
Myers's examples was the result of *séances*, but it had features of
great importance for the argument. It will be found in *Proc. S. P. R.*,
vol. xix. p. 139, July 1891. The performers are Mr. C., Mrs. C., and Mr.
H. Mr. C. and Mrs. C. are spoken of as good witnesses, known to Mr.
Myers and Professor Barrett. Mr. H.'s health has suffered so much that
he cannot be examined, and Mr.

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

\[paragraph continues\] H. is the person who interests us here, for
reasons which will be given later. All three were "unbelievers" in these
matters. On the second evening "lights floated about the room," which
was lit, apparently, by a full moon. "F." (who is also "H.") felt cold
hands touching, and "hands" recur in the old pre-scientific accounts.
The three mages were holding hands tightly at the time. Now Mr. H. had
hitherto been in excellent health, but after his chair was dragged from
under him, and he was "thrown down on the ground," he went into "a
trance." His watch and ring (on the finger of a hand held by Mrs. C.)
were carried to a remote part of the room. H. leaves the circle and sits
at the window. Another figure walks through the room. H. returns, is
"thrown down," his coat is dragged off, and his boots are discovered on
a distant sofa. He asks for "something from home," goes into a trance, a
photograph locked up by him at home is found on the table. His wife, in
town, "being quite ignorant of our having had *séances*, told us that,
at that very hour, a fearful crash occurred in his bedroom. The
photograph vanished, and returned last night, when H. was in a trance."
He is "thrown

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

down" again. He has "alternate fits of unconsciousness and raving
delirium." The home of Mr. and Mrs. C. (not the house where they sat) is
vexed by "figures," noises, knockings; "we were sprinkled with water in
the night," haunted by sounds of drums and horns, and so forth. Before a
"manifestation," "we all felt a sudden chill, like either a wave of
intensely cold air passing, or a rapid decrease of temperature." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

This is a disgusting story if Mr. H's health was ruined by his presence
at the performances. The point, however, is that he did behave in
epileptic fashion while these events were in progress. It is natural to
suppose that, in his "trances," he may have been capable, unconsciously,
of feats physically and morally impossible to him in his normal
condition. This explanation would not cover all the alleged occurrences,
but would account for many of them.

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

We now take an ancient instance, similar disturbances at Newberry, in
New England, in 1679, similarly accompanied by the presence of an
epileptic patient. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) The house of
William Morse was "strangely disquieted by a dæmon." The inmates were
Morse, his wife, and their grandson, a boy whose age is not given. The
trouble began on December 3, with a sound of heavy objects falling on
the roof. On December 8, large stones and bricks "were thrown in at the
west end of the house . . . the bedstead was lifted up from the floor,
and the bed-staff flung out of the window, and a cat was hurled at the
wife. A long staff danced up and down in the chimney. The man's wife put
the staff in the fire, but she could not hold it there, inasmuch as it
would forcibly fly out; yet after much ado, with joynt strength, they
made it to burn. . . . A chair flew about, and at last lighted on the
table, where victuals stood ready to eat, and was likely to spoil all,
only by a nimble catching they saved some of their meat. . . . A chest
was removed from place to place,

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

no hand touching it. Two keys would fly about, making a loud noise by
knocking against each other. . . . As they lay in bed with their little
boy between them, a great stone from the floor of the loft was thrown
upon the man's stomach, and he turning it down upon the floor, it was
once more thrown upon him." On January 23, 1680, "his ink-horn was taken
away from him while he was writing" (he was keeping a diary of these
events), "and when by all his seeking he could not find it, at last he
saw it drop out of the air, down by the fire. . . . February 2, while he
and his boy were eating of cheese, the pieces which he cut were wrested
from them. . . . But as for the boy, he was a great sufferer in these
afflictions, for on the 18th of December he, sitting by his grandfather,
was hurried into great motions. The man made him stand between his legs,
but the chair danced up and down, and was like to have cast both man and
boy into the fire, and the child was tossed about in such a manner as
that they feared his brains would have been beaten out."

All these contortions of the boy were apparently what M. Charcot calls
*clownisms*. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) When

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

taken to a doctor's house the boy "was free of disturbances," which
returned with his return home. He barked like a dog, clucked like a hen,
talked nonsense about "Powel," who pinched and bullied him. While he was
in bed with the old people, "a pot with its contents was thrown upon
them." They were clutched by hands, like Mr. and Mrs. C. Once a voice
was heard singing, "Revenge, revenge is sweet." Finally a mate of a ship
came, declared that the grandmother was not rightly suspected as a
witch, and offered, if he were left alone with the boy, to cure him.
"The mate came next day betimes, and the boy was with him till night;
since which time his house, Morse saith, has not been molested with evil
spirits." Probably the mate used a rope's end: the boy was more speedily
cured than Mr. H.

The phenomena are those of droll or buffooning wights, as Air. Kirk
says, and no man can doubt that the boy was at the bottom of the whole
affair. But whether he was capable, when well and conscious, of such
diversions, is another question. Children like him produced the famous
witch-mania in New England.

We have here, undeniably, a well-recorded

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

case, analogous to that of Mr. H. In a modern case of bell-ringing,
heavy thumps, and movement of objects, the agent was "a young girl who
had never been out to service before," and who passed the night in a
state of wildly agitated somnambulism, repeating the whole of the
Service for the day. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) Mather gives
several other examples, in which motives for trickery are manifest,
while we hear nothing of an epileptic or hysterical patient.

In the majority of instances, ancient or modern, children are the
agents. Thus we have "Physical Phenomena obtained in a Family Circle,"
that of Mr. and Mrs. Davis, with their children, at Rio Janeiro. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) The time was 1888. Curiosity had been
caused by "the notorious Henry Slade." There were "touches and grasps of
hands." A table "ran after me" (Professor Alexander) "and attempted to
hem me in," when only C., a little girl, was in the room. "As far as I
could see, she did not even touch the table." The chair of Amy (aged
thirteen months) was moved about, like that of Master Morse two hundred
years earlier. A table jumped into the laps of the

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

public. There were raps and thumps, which "seemed to shake the whole
building." Lights floated about. A slate, covered with flour, was placed
on C.'s lap; her hands lay on the table. Marks of fingers came on the
flour, and, in answer to request, the mark of "a naked baby foot." The
children present were wearing laced boots, and we are not told that
little Amy was under the table. Bluish lights and the phantasm of a dog
were seen.

All this answers to an ancient example--the disturbances in Mr. Wesley's
house at Epworth, December 1715 to January 1716. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) The house was a new one, rebuilt in 1709.
We have Mr. Samuel Wesley's Journal, with many contemporary letters from
members of the family, and later reminiscences. There were many lively
girls in the house, and two servants--a maid and a man, recently
engaged. The disturbances began with groanings; then came knockings,
which flitted about the house. Mr. Wesley heard nothing till December
21. The knocks replied to those made by the family, but they never could
imitate the sounds. Mrs. Wesley

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

and Emily saw an object "like a badger" run from under a bed and vanish.
The mastiff was much alarmed by the sounds. Mr. Wesley was "thrice
pushed by invisible power." The bogie was a Jacobite, as was Mrs.
Wesley: Mr. Wesley was for King George. The knocks were violent when
that usurper was prayed for. They did not try praying for King James.
Robin, the servant, saw a hand-mill work violently. "Naught vexed me but
that it was empty. I thought, had it but been full of malt, he might
have ground his heart out for me." But this was a jocose, not an
industrious devil. Robin called it "old Jeffries," after a gentleman
lately dead; the family called it "Jeffrey," unless one name is a mere
misspelling. It "seemed to sweep after" Nancy Wesley, when she swept the
chambers. "She thought he might have done it for her, and saved her the
trouble." Mrs. Wesley concealed the matter from her husband, "lest he
should fancy it was against his own death" (Letter of January 12,
1716-17). This belief in noises foretelling death is very common;
compare Scott's nocturnal disturbances at Abbotsford when Bullock, his
agent in building it, was dying in London. The racket occurred on April

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 28 and 29, 1818, and Scott examined the scene
"with Beardie's broadsword under my arm." <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) Bullock died in Tenterden Street, in
London, whether on April 28 or 29 is not easily to be ascertained. "The
noise resembled half a dozen men putting up boards and furniture, and
nothing can be more certain than that there was nobody on the premises
at the time." <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) The noises used to
follow Hetty Wesley, and thump under her feet, as under those of C. in
Professor Alexander's narrative. Mr. Wesley's plate "danced before him
on the table a pretty while, without anybody's stirring the
table." <span id="fr_18"></span>[3](#fn_18.md) The disturbances quieted
down in January, but recurred on March 31. Similar phenomena had
occurred "long before" in the family. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[4](#fn_19.md) "The sound very often seemed in the air,
in the middle of a room, nor could they ever make any such themselves by
any contrivance." <span id="fr_20"></span>[5](#fn_20.md) On February 16,
1740, twenty-three years later, Emily writes to Jack about "that
*wonderful thing* called by us *Jeffrey*.

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

\[paragraph continues\] . . . That something calls on me against any
extraordinary new affliction."

Priestley styles this affair "the best-authenticated that is anywhere
extant." He supposes it to have been "a trick of the servants, for mere
amusement." The *modus operandi* is difficult to explain. We hear
nothing of bad health or hysterics in the household. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) For our purpose it is enough that a few
incidents of this kind, however produced, might originate and keep alive
the belief in Brownies, and

          "That shrewd and knavish sprite  
Called Robin Goodfellow,"

who

"Frights the maidens of the villagery,  
Skims milk, and sometimes labours in the quern."

By a curious coincidence, we can show a case in which phenomena of the
kind usually reported as occurring at *séances*, and in examples like
that of William Morse, were actually accepted as manifestations of the
*Sleagh Maith*, or Fairies. In his account of the disturbances in the
Wesley family, Dr. Clarke, the author, averred that be had himself
witnessed similar events. It thus became necessary to consult his *Life*
(London,

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

1833). "In the history of my own life," says Dr. Clarke, "I have related
this matter in sufficient detail." <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)
Unluckily, in his *Life* (pp. 76, 77) he gives scarce any details.
Previous to sudden deaths in a family called Church, the phenomena of
falling plates, heavy tread, and other noises occurred. Mr. Clarke "sat
up one whole night in the kitchen, and most distinctly heard the above
noises." He was a born mystic, and even in childhood a reader of
Cornelius Agrippa, and, later, of the alchemists. But he records the
instance of a woman, who solemnly declared to Mrs. Clarke that a number
of the *gentle people* (*Sleagh Maith*) "occasionally frequented her
house; that they often conversed with her, one of them putting its hands
on her eyes during the time, which hands she represented, from the
sensation she had, to be about the size of those of a child of four or
five years of age." The family were "worn down" with these visits, and
from the mention of touches of hands it is pretty plain that we have to
do with the kind of sprite who paws people at *séances*. But these
sprites are recognised (the scene is the North of Ireland) as "gentle
people," Folk of

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Peace. The amusing thing is, that Mr. Clarke,
while he believes in Mr. Wesley's Jeffrey, and in the supernatural
origin of a noise in a kitchen laughs at similar phenomena when assigned
to Fairies. It is a mere difference of terminology.

Another old example may be given. It is Alexander Telfair's "True
Relation" of disturbances at Ringcroft, in the parish of Rerrick. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) The story is attested by the signatures of
Ewart, minister of Kells, in Galloway; Monteith, minister of Borg;
Murdoch, minister of Crosmichael, on Loch Ken; Spalding, minister at
Parton, also by Loch Ken; Falconer, minister at Keltown; Mr. M'Lellan of
Colline, Lennox of Milhouse, and a number of farmers. These were all
neighbours, and all attested what they saw and heard. Robert Chambers
says, "There never, perhaps, was any mystic history better attested. Few
narrations of the kind have included occurrences and appearances which
it was more difficult to reconcile with the theory of trick or
imposture." Mr. Telfair himself had been

<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span>

chaplain, in 1687, to Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick of Closeburn. He was then
an Episcopalian.

Andrew Mackie was a stone-mason at Rerrick. On March 7 (1695?), and for
long after, stones began to fly about in his house by night and day.
"The stones which hit any person had not half their natural weight."
Mackie complained to Telfair, his minister, who entered the house and
prayed: nothing odd occurred. As he stood outside, he "saw two little
stones drop down on the croft;" then he was asked to return, and was
pelted inside the cottage. This was March 11. For a week there was no
more trouble, then the disturbances began again. Mr. Telfair was sent
for, and was pelted, beaten with a staff, and heard loud knockings.
"That night, as I was at prayer, leaning on a bedside, I felt something
lifting up my arm. I, casting my eyes thither, perceived a little white
hand and arm from the elbow down, but presently it evanished." "There
was never anything seen except that hand I saw," and an apparition of a
boy in grey clothes. Sometimes the stoning went on in the open
air. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) There were plenty

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

of touchings, grippings, and scratchings. "The door-bar" (a long, heavy
piece of squared wood) "would go thorow the house as if a person were
carrying it in their hand, yet nothing seen doing it." Here we compare,
in *Proc. S. P. R.*, February 1892, the story of a carpenter's shop at
Swanland, in Yorkshire, where pieces of wood were "levitated" into
abnormal flight. No imposture was discovered, nor was the presence of
any one person necessary.

The ministers of Kells and Crosmichael were pelted with stones of eight
pounds weight. On April 6, fire-balls floated through the cottage. When
five ministers were present, "it made all the house shake, brake a hole
through the thatch, and poured in great stones." "It handled the legs of
some as with a man's hand;" it hoisted Mr. Telfair, Lennox of Millhouse,
and others off the ground! A sieve flew through the house; Mackie caught
it; a force gripped it, and pulled the interior part out of the rim. A
day of humiliation was solemnly kept in the parish, which only excited
the emulation of the disturbing agent; "it continued in a most fearful
manner without intermission." Voices were heard, which talked nonsense
of a semi-scriptural

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

kind; finally the thing died out early in May. By the way, on April 28,
"it pulled down the end of the house, all the stone-work thereof."

This is a very odd case, as no suspicion is thrown on the children. The
attestations of several witnesses are given, not only at the close, but
for almost every separate incident. The vision of the white hand is
agreeable.

The Devil of Glen Luce, in Galloway, was published by Sinclair in his
*Hydrostaticks*, of all places, in 1672, and again in *Satan's Invisible
World*, and by Glanvil in *Sadducismus Triumphatus*. In this affair a
boy called Thomas, a son of the unlucky householder, was clearly the
agent. The phenomena were stone-throwing, beating with sticks,
levitation of a plate, and a great deal of voices, probably uttered by
the aforesaid Thomas. The Synod ordered a day of humiliation (1655-56).

The affair of the Drummer of Tedworth (1661) is, or ought to be, too
well known for quotation. The troubles began after Mr. Momposson seized
the drum of a vagrant musician. In the presence of a clergyman, chairs
walked about the room of themselves, "a bed-staff was thrown at the
minister, but so favourably that a lock of

<span id="page_lvi">p. lvi</span>

wool could not have fallen more softly." The children, as usual, were
especially haunted. A jingling of money was common, as it also was at
Epworth. Lights wandered about the house, "blue and glimmering." The
noise was persistent in the woodwork of the children's beds, while their
hands were outside. The knocks answered knocks made by visitors. There
were divers other marvels. The Drummer was suspected, but, consciously
or not, the children were probably the agents. They seem to have been in
their usual health. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) In Galashiels
(date not given), loud knocks on the floor accompanied a
hystero-epileptic girl wherever she sat. In bed, "her body was so lifted
up that many strong men were not able to keep it down." The minister,
who could make nothing of her, was Mr. Wilkie; the girl was Margaret
Wilson (Sinclair, p. 200).

This little parcel of strange stories may suffice to show that part of
the Fairy belief is based on such incidents as still occur, or are
reported to occur, just in the old fashion. It is for psychologists and
physicians to ascertain how far, if at

<span id="page_lvii">p. lvii</span>

all, the incidents are produced by hysterical, or epileptic, or
somnambulistic patients. Common forthright trickery is usually detected
in paid mediums. But the trickery simulates real events, or continues an
old traditional form of imposture. The moral that parents should not
allow their children to be present at *séances* hardly needs enforcing.
Some of them may escape unharmed, but frightful injuries may be
inflicted on health and on character. <span
