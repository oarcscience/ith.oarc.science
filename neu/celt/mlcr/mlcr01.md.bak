# Chapter I: The Celts in Ancient History

**Earliest References**

IN the chronicles of the classical nations for about five hundred years
previous to the Christian era there are frequent references to a people
associated with these nations, sometimes in peace, sometimes in war, and
evidently occupying a position of great strength and influence in the
Terra Incognita of Mid-Europe. This people is called by the Greeks the
Hyperboreans or Celts, the latter term being first found in the
geographer Hecataeus, about 500 B.C. \[He speaks of "Nyrax, a Celtic
city," and "Massalia (Marseilles), a city of Liguria in the land of the
Celts" (Fragmenta Hist. Graec.")\].

Herodotus, about half a century later, speaks of the Celts as dwelling
"beyond the pillars of Hercules " - *i.e.,* in Spain - and also of the
Danube as rising in their Country.

Aristotle knew that they dwelt "beyond Spain," that they had captured
Rome, and that they set great store by warlike power. References other
than geographical are occasionally met with even in early writers.
Hellanicus of Lesbos, an historian of the fifth century B.C., describes
the Celts as practising justice and righteousness. Ephorus, about 350
B.C., has three lines of verse about the Celts in which they are
described as using" the same customs as the Greeks " - whatever that may
mean - and being on the friendliest terms with that people, who
established guest friend-ships among them. Plato, however, in the
"Laws," classes the Celts among the races who are drunken and combative,
and much barbarity is attributed to them on the occasion of their
irruption into Greece and the

\[17\]

sacking of Delphi in the year 273 B.C. Their attack on Rome and the
sacking of that city by them about a century earlier is one of the
landmarks of ancient history.

The history of this people during the time when they were the dominant
power in Mid-Europe has to be divined or reconstructed from scattered
references, and from accounts of episodes in their dealings with Greece
and Rome, very much as the figure of a primeval monster is reconstructed
by the zoologist from a few fossilised bones. No chronicles of their own
have come down to us, no architectural remains have survived; a few
coins, and a few ornaments and weapons in bronze decorated with enamel
or with subtle and beautiful designs in chased or repoussé work - these,
and the names which often cling in strangely altered forms to the places
where they dwelt, from the Euxine to the British Islands, are well-nigh
all the visible traces which this once mighty power has left us of its
civilisation and dominion. Yet from these, and from the accounts of
classical writers, much can be deduced with certainty, and much more can
be conjectured with a very fair measure of probability. The great Celtic
scholar whose loss we have recently had to deplore, M. d'Arbois de
Jubainville, has, on the available data, drawn a convincing outline of
Celtic history for the period prior to their emergence into full
historical light with the conquests of Caesar, \[in his 'Premiers
Habitants de l'Europe,' vol. Ii\] and it is this outline of which the
main features are reproduced here.

 

The True Celtic Race

To begin with, we must dismiss the idea that Celtica was ever inhabited
by a single pure and homogeneous race. The true Celts, if we accept on
this point the carefully studied and elaborately argued conclusion of

\[18\]

Dr. T. Rice Holmes, \['Caesar's Conquest of Gaul,' pp. 251 - 327\]
supported by the unanimous voice of antiquity, were a tall air race,
warlike and masterful, \[The ancients were not very close observers of
physical characteristics. They describe the Celts in almost exactly the
same terms as those which they apply to the Germanic races. Dr. Rice
Holmes is of opinion that the real difference, physically, lay in the
fact that the fairness of the Germans was blond, and that of the Celts
red. In an interesting passage of the work already quoted (p. 315) he
observes that, "Making every allowance for the admixture of other blood,
which must have considerably modified the type of the original Celtic or
Gallic invaders of these islands, we are struck by the fact that among
all our Celtic-speaking fellow subjects there are to be found numerous
specimens of a type which also exists in those parts of Brittany which
were colonised by British invaders, and in those parts of Gaul in which
the Gallic invaders appear to have settled most thickly, as well as in
Northern Italy, where the Celtic invaders were once dominant ; and also
by the fact that this type, *even among the more blond representatives
of it, is strikingly different to the casual as well as to the
scientific observer, from that ol the purest representatives of the
ancient Germans.* The well-known picture of Sir David Wilkie, 'Reading
of the Waterloo Gazette,' illustrates, as Daniel Wilson remarked, the
difference between the two types. Put a Perthshire Highlander side by
side with a Sussex farmer. Both will be fair ; but the red hair and
heard of the Scot will be in marked contrast with the fair hair of the
Englishman, and their features will differ still more markedly. I
remember seeing two gamekeepers in a railway carriage running from
Inverness to Lairey. They were tall, athletic, fair men, evidently
belonging to the Scandinavian type, which, as Dr. Beddoc says, is so
common in the extreme north of Scotland but both in colouring and in
general aspect they were utterly different from the tall, fair
Highlanders whom I had Seen in Perth-shire. There was not a trace of red
in their hair, their long beards being absolutely yellow. The prevalence
of red among the Celtic. speaking people is, it seems to me, a most
striking characteristic. No. only do we find eleven men in every hundred
whose hair is absolutely red, but underlying the blacks and the dark
browns the same tint is to he discovered."\] whose place of origin (as
far as we can trace them) was somewhere about the sources of the Danube,
and who spread their dominion both by conquest and by peaceful

\[19\]

infiltration over Mid-Europe, Gaul, Spain, and the British Islands. They
did not exterminate the original prehistoric inhabitants of these
regions - Palaeolithic and Neolithic races, dolmen-builders and workers
in bronze - but they imposed on them their language, their arts, and
their traditions, taking, no doubt, a good deal from them in return,
especially, as we shall see, in the important matter of religion. Among
these races the true Celts formed an aristocratic and ruling caste. In
that capacity they stood, alike in Gaul, in Spain, in Britain, and in
Ireland, in the forefront of armed opposition to foreign invasion. They
bore the worst brunt of war, of confiscations, and of banishment They
never lacked valour, but they were not strong enough or united enough to
prevail, and they perished in far greater proportion than the earlier
populations whom they had themselves subjugated. But they disappeared
also by mingling their blood with these inhabitants, whom they
impregnated with many of their own noble and virile qualities. Hence it
comes that the characteristics of the peoples called Celtic in the
present day, and who carry on the Celtic tradition and language, are in
some respects so different from those of the Celts of classical history
and the Celts who produced the literature and art of ancient Ireland,
and in others so strikingly similar. To take a physical characteristic
alone, the more Celtic districts of the British Islands are at present
marked by darkness of complexion, hair, &c. They are not very dark, but
they are darker than the rest of the kingdom. \[See the map of
comparative nigrescence given in Ripley's "Races of Europe," p.318. In
France, however, the Bretons are not a dark race relatively to the reit
of the population. They are composed partly of the ancient Gallic
peoples and partly of settlers from Wales who were driven out by the
Saxon invasion\] But the

\[20\]

true Celts were certainly fair. Even the Irish Celts of the twelfth
century are described by Giraldus Cambrensis as a fair race.

  
Golden Age of the Celts

But we are anticipating, and must return to the period of the origins of
Celtic history. As astronomers have discerned the existence of an
unknown planet by the perturbations which it has caused in the courses
of those already under direct observation, so we can discern in the
fifth and fourth centuries before Christ the presence of a great power
and of mighty movements going on behind a veil which will never be
lifted now. This was the Golden Age of Celtdom in Continental Europe.
During this period the Celts waged three great and successful wars,
which had no little influence on the course of South European history.
About 500 B.C. they conquered Spain from the Carthaginians. A century
later we find them engaged in the conquest of Northern Italy from the
Etruscans. They settled in large numbers in the territory afterwards
known as Cisalpine Gaul, where many names, such as *Mediolanum* (Milan),
*Addua* (Adda), *Viro-dunum* (Verduno), and perhaps *Cremona (creamh,*
garlic) \[See for these names Holder's " Altceltischer Sprachschattz."\]
testify still to their occupation. They left a greater memorial in the
chief of Latin poets, whose name, Vergil, appears to bear evidence of
his Celtic ancestry. \[Vergil might possibly mean " the very-bright ''
or illustrious one, a natural form for a proper name. *Ver* in Gallic
names (Vercingetorix, Vercsssivellasimus, &c.) is often an intensive
prefix, like the modern Irish *fior*. The name of the village where
Vergil was horn, Andes (now Pietola), is Celtic. His love of nature, his
mysticism, and his strong feeling for a certain decorative quality in
language and rhythm are markedly Celtic qualities. Tennyson's phrases
for him, "landscape-lover, lord of language," are suggestive in this
connexion.\] Towards the end of the fourth

\[21\]

century they overran Pannonia, conquering the Illyrians.

  
Alliances with the Greeks

All these wars were undertaken in alliance with the Greeks, with whom
the Celts were at this period on the friendliest terms. By the war with
the Carthaginians the monopoly held by that people of the trade in tin
with Britain and in silver with the miners of Spain was broken down, and
the overland route across France to Britain, for the sake of which the
Phoenicians had in 600 B.C. created the port of Marseilles, was
definitely secured to Greek trade. Greeks and Celts were at this period
allied against Phoenicians and Persians. The defeat of Hamilcar by Gelon
at Himera, in Sicily, took place in the same year as that of Xerxes at
Salamis. The Carthaginian army in that expedition was made up of
mercenaries from half a dozen different nations, but not a Celt is found
in the Carthaginian ranks, and Celtic hostility must have counted for
much in preventing the Carthaginians from lending help to the Persians
for the overthrow ot their common enemy. These facts show that Celtica
played no small part in preserving the Greek type of civilisation from
being overwhelmed by the despotisms of the East, and thus in keeping
alive in Europe the priceless seed of freedom and humane culture.

 

Alexander the Great

When the counter-movement of Hellas against the East began under
Alexander the Great we find the Celts again appearing as a factor of
importance.

\[22\]

In the fourth century Macedon was attacked and almost obliterated by
Thracian and Illyrian hordes. King Amyntas II. was defeated and driven
into exile. His son Perdiccas II. was killed in battle. When Philip, a
younger brother of Perdiccas, came to the obscure and tottering throne
which hc and his successors were to make the seat of a great empire he
was powerfully aided in making head against the Illyrians by the
conquests of the Celts in the valleys of the Danube and the Po. The
alliance was continued, and rendered, perhaps, more formal in the days
of Alexander. When about to undertake his conquest of Asia (334 B.C.)
Alexander first made a compact with the Celts "who dwelt by the lonian
Gulf" in order to secure his Greek dominions from attack during his
absence. The episode is related by Ptolemy Soter in his history of the
wars of Alexander. \[Ptolemy, a friend, and probably, indeed,
half-brother, of Alexander, was doubtless present when this incident
took place. His work has not survived, but is quoted by Arrian and other
historians.\] It has a vividness which stamps it as a bit of authentic
history, and another singular testimony to the truth of the narrative
has been brought to light by de Jubainville. As the Celtic envoys, who
are described as men of haughty bearing and great stature, their mission
concluded) were drinking with the king, he asked them, it is said, what
was the thing they, the Celts, most feared. The envoys replied : "We
fear no man : there is but one thing that we fear, namely, that the sky
should fall on us; but we regard nothing so much as the friendship of a
man such as thou." Alexander bade them farewell, and, turning to his
nobles, whispered: "What a vainglorious people are these Celts !" Yet
the answer, for all its Celtic bravura and flourish,

\[23\]

was not without both dignity and courtesy. The reference to the falling
of the sky seems to give a glimpse of some primitive belief or myth of
which it is no longer possible to discover the meaning. \[One is
reminded of the folk-tale about Henny Penny, who went to tell the king
that the sky was falIing\] The national oath by which the Celts bound
themselves to the observance of their covenant with Alexander is
remarkable. If we observe not this engagement," they said, "may the sky
fall on us and crush us, may the earth gape and swallow us up, may the
sea burst out and overwhelm us." De Jubainville draws attention most
appositely to a passage from the "Táin Bo Cuailgne," in the Book of
Leinster, \[The Book of Leinster is a manuscript of the twelfth century.
The version of the " Táin " given in it probably dates from the eighth.
See de Jubainville, " Premiers Habitants," ii. 316.\] where the Ulster
heroes declare to their king, who wished to leave them in battle in
order to meet an attack in another part of the field "Heaven is above
us, and earth beneath us, and the sea is round about us. Unless the sky
shall fall with its showers of stars on the ground where we are camped,
or unless the earth shall be rent by an earthquake) or unless the waves
of the blue sea come over the forests of the living world, we shall not
give ground." \[Dr. Douglas Hyde in his "Literary History of Ireland "
(p.7) gises a slightly different translation\] This survival of a
peculiar oath-formula or more than a thousand years, and its
reappearance, after being first heard of among the Celts of Mid-Europe,
in a mythical romance of Ireland, is certainly most curious, and, with
other facts which we shall note hereafter, speaks strongly for the
community and persistence of Celtic culture.\[It is also a testimony to
the close accuracy of the narrative of Ptolemy.\]

\[24\]

 

The Sack of Rome

We have mentioned two of the great wars of the Continental Celts; we
come now to the third, that with the Etruscans, which ultimately brought
them into conflict with the greatest power of pagan Europe, and led to
their proudest feat of arms, the sack of Rome. About the year 400 B.C.
the Celtic Empire seems to have reached the height of its power. Under a
king named by Livy Ambicatus, who was probably the head of a dominant
tribe in a military confederacy, like the German Emperor in the present
day, the Celts seem to have been welded into a considerable degree of
political unity, and to have followed a consistent policy. Attracted by
the rich land of Northern Italy, they poured down through the passes of
the Alps, and after hard fighting with the Etruscan inhabitants they
maintained their ground there. At this time the Romans were pressing on
the Etruscans from below, and Roman and Celt were acting in definite
concert and alliance. But the Romans, despising perhaps the Northern
barbarian warriors, had the rashness to play them false at the siege of
Clusium, 391 B.C., a place which the Romans regarded as one of the
bulwarks of Latium against the North. The Celts recognised Romans who
had come to them in the sacred character of ambassadors fighting in the
ranks of the enemy. The events which followed are, as they have come
down to us, much mingled with legend, but there are certain touches of
dramatic vividness in which the true character of the Celts appears
distinctly recognisable. They applied, we arc told, to Rome for
satisfaction for the treachery of the envoys, who were three sons of
Fabius Ambustus, the chief pontiff. The Romans refused to listen to the
claim, and elected the Fabii military tribunes for the

\[25\]

ensuing year. Then the Celts abandoned the siege of Clusium and marched
straight on Rome. The army showed perfect discipline. There was no
indiscriminate plundering and devastation, no city or fortress was
assailed. "We are bound for Rome" was their cry to the guards upon the
walls of the provincial towns, who watched the host in wonder and fear
as it rolled steadily to the south. At last they reached the river
Allia, a few miles from Rome, where the whole available force of the
city was ranged to meet them. The battle took place on July 18, 390,
that ill-omened *dies Alliensis* which long perpetuated in the Roman
calendar the memory of the deepest shame the republic had ever known.
The Celts turned the flank of the Roman army, and annihilated it in one
tremendous charge. Three days later they were in Rome, and for nearly a
year they remained masters of the city, or of its ruins, till a great
fine had been exacted and full vengeance taken for the perfidy at
Clusium. For nearly a century after the treaty thus concluded there was
peace between the Celts and the Romans, and the breaking of that peace
when certain Celtic tribes allied themselves with their old enemy, the
Etruscans, in the third Samnite war was coincident with the breaking up
of the Celtic Empire. \[Roman history tells of various confiicts with
the Celts during thia period, but de Jubainville has shown that these
narratives are almost entirely mythical. See "Premiers Habitant;" ii.
318-323.\]

Two questions must now be considered before we can leave the historical
part of this Introduction. First of all, what are the evidences for the
wide-spread diffusion of Celtic power in Mid-Europe during this period?
Secondly, where were the Germanic peoples, and what was their position
in regard to the Celts ?

\[26\]

 

Celtic Place-names in Europe

To answer these questions fully would take us (for the purposes of this
volume) too deeply into philological discussions, which only the Celtic
scholar can fully appreciate. The evidence will be found fully set forth
in de Jubainville's work, already frequently referred to. The study of
European place-names forms the basis of the argument. Take the Celtic
name *Noviomagus,* composed of two Celtic words, the adjective meaning
new, and *magos* (Irish *magh)* a field or plain.\[e.g., Moymell
(*magh-meala*), the Plain of Honey a Gaelic name for Fairyland and many
place-names\] There were nine places of this name known in antiquity.
Six were in France, among them the places now called Noyon, in Oise,
Nijon, in Vosges, Nyons, in Drôme. Three outside of France were Nimègue,
in Belgium, Neumagen, in the Rhineland, and one at Speyer, in the
Palatinate.

The word *dunum,* so often traceable in Gaelic place names in the
present day (Dundalk, Dunrobin, &c.), and meaning fortress or castle, is
another typically Celtic element in European place-names. It occurred
very frequently in France - e.g., *Lug-dunum* (Lyons), *Viro-dunum*
(Verdun). It is also found in Switzerland - e.*g., Minno-dunum*
(Moudon), *Eburo-dunum* (Yverdon) - and in the Netherlands, where the
famous city of Leyden goes back to a Celtic *Lug-dunum.* In Great
Britain the Celtic term was often changed by simple translation into
*castra*; thus *Camulo-dunum* became Colchester, *Bran-dunum*
Brancaster. In Spain and Portugal eight names terminating in *dunum* are
mentioned by classical writers. In Germany the modern names Kempton,
Karnberg, Liegnitz, go back respectively to the Celtic forms

Cambo-dunum, Carro-

\[27\]

aunum, Lugi-dunum, and we find a *Singi-dunum,* now Belgrade, in Servia,
a *Novi-dunum,* now Isaktscha, in Roumania, *a Carro-dunum* in South
Russia, near the Dniester, and another in Croatia, now Pitsmeza.
*Sego-dunum,* now Rodez, in France, turns up also in Bavaria (Wurzburg),
and in England *(Sege-dunum,* now Wallsend, in Northumberland), and the
first term, *sego,* is traceable in Segorbe (*Sego-briga*), in Spain.
*Briga* is a Celtic word, the origin of the German *burg,* and
equivalent in meaning to

dunum.

One more example: the word *magos,* a plain, which is very frequent as
an element of Irish place-names, is found abundantly in France, and
outside of France, in countries no longer Celtic, it appears in
Switzerland *(Uro-magus,* now Promasens), in the Rhineland
*(Broco-magus,* Brumath), in the Netherlands, as already noted
(Nimègue), in Lombardy several times, and in Austria.

The examples given are by no means exhaustive, but they serve to
indicate the wide diffusion of the Celts in Europe and their identity of
language over their vast territory. \[For these and many other examples
see de Jubainyille's "Premiers Habitants" ii, 255 *seq.*\]

 

Early Celtic Art

The relics of ancient Celtic art-work tell the same story. In the year
1846 a great pre-Roman necropolis was discovered at Hallstatt, near
Salzburg, in Austria. It contains relics believed by Dr. Arthur Evans to
date from about 750 to 400 B.C. These relics betoken in some cases a
high standard of civilisation and considerable commerce. Amber from the
Baltic is there, Phoenician glass, and gold-leaf of Oriental
workmanship. Iron swords are found whose hilts and sheaths are richly
decorated with gold, ivory, and amber.

\[28\]

The Celtic culture illustrated by the remains at Hallstatt developed
later into what is called the La Tène culture. La Tène was a settlement
at the north-eastern end of the Lake of Neuchâtel, and many objects of
great interest have been found there since the site was first explored
in 1858. These antiquities represent, according to Dr. Evans, the
culminating period of Gaulish civilisation, and date from round about
the third century B.C. The type of art here found must be judged in the
light of an observation recently made by Mr. Romilly Allen in his
"Celtic Art" (p.13)

"The great difficulty in understanding the evolution of Celtic art lies
in the fact that although the Celts never seem to have invented any new
ideas, they professed \[*sic;* ? possessed\] an extraordinary aptitude
for picking up ideas from the different peoples with whom war or
commerce brought them into contact. And once the Celt had borrowed an
idea from his neighbours he was able to give it such a strong Celtic
tinge that it soon became something so different from what it was
originally as to be almost unrecognisable."

Now what the Celt borrowed in the art-culture which on the Continent
culminated in the La Tène relics were certain originally naturalistic
motives for Greek ornaments, notably the pal mette and the meander
motives. But it was characteristic of the Celt that he avoided in his
art all imitation of, or even approximation to, the natural forms of the
plant and animal world. He reduced everything to pure decoration. What
he enjoyed in decoration was the alternation of long sweeping curves and
undulations with the concentrated energy of close-set spirals or bosses,
and with these simple elements and with the suggestion of a few motives
derived from Greek art he elaborated a most

\[29\]

beautiful, subtle, and varied system of decoration, applied to weapons,
ornaments, and to toilet and household appliances of all kinds, in gold,
bronze, wood, and stone, and possibly, if we had the means of judging,
to textile fabrics also. One beautiful feature in the decoration of
metal-work seems to have entirely originated in Celtica. Enamelling was
unknown to the classical nations till they learned from the Celts. So
late as the third century A.D. it was still strange to the classical
world, as we learn from the reference of Philostratus:

"They say that the barbarians who live in the ocean \[Britons\] pour
these colours upon heated brass, and that they adhere, become hard as
stone, and preserve the designs that are made upon them."

Dr. J. Anderson writes in the "Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland" :

"The Gauls as well as the Britons - of the same Celtic stock - practised
enamel-working before the Roman conquest. The enamel workshops of
Bibracte, with their furnaces, crucibles, moulds, polishing-stones, and
with the crude enamels in their various stages of preparation, have been
recently excavated from the ruins of the city destroyed by Caesar and
his legions. But the Bibracte enamels are the work of mere dabblers in
the art, compared with the British examples. The home of the art was
Britain, and the style of the pattern, as well as the association in
which the objects decorated with it were found, demonstrated with
certainty that it had reached its highest stage of indigenous
development before it came in contact with the Roman culture."  
\[Quoted by Mr. Romilly Allen in "Celtic Art," p.136\]

The National Museum in Dublin contains many superb examples of Irish
decorative art in gold, bronze,

\[30\]

and enamels, and the "strong Celtic tinge " of which Mr. Romilly Allen
speaks is as clearly observable there as in the relics of Hallstatt or
La Tène.

Everything, then, speaks of a community of culture, an identity of
race-character, existing over the vast territory known to the ancient
world as "Celtica."

  
Celts and Germans

But, as we have said before, this territory was by no means inhabited by
the Celt alone. In particular we have to ask, who and where were the
Germans, the Teuto-Gothic tribes, who eventually took the place of the
Celts as the great Northern menace to classical civilisation ?

They are mentioned by Pytheas, the eminent Greek traveller and
geographer, about 300 B.C., but they play no part in history till, under
the name of Cimbri and Teutones, they descended on Italy to be
vanquished by Marius at the close of the second century. The ancient
Greek geographers prior to Pytheas know nothing of them, and assign all
the territories now known as Germanic to various Celtic tribes.

The explanation given by de Jubainville, and based by him on various
philological considerations, is that the Germans were a subject people,
comparable to those "un-free tribes " who existed in Gaul and in ancient
Ireland. They lived under the Celtic dominion, and had no independent
political existence. De Jubainville finds that all the words connected
with law and government and war which are common both to the Celtic and
Teutonic languages were borrowed by the latter from the former. Chief
among them are the words represented by the modern German *Reich,*
empire, *Amt,* office, and the Gothic *reiks,* a king, all of which are
of unquestioned Celtic origin. De Jubainville also numbers among loan
words from Celtic

\[31\]

the words *Bann*, an order *; Frei,* free; *Geisel a hostage; Erbe,* an
inheritance *; Werth,* value; *Weih,* sacred; *Magus, a* slave (Gothic)
*; Wini, a* wife (Old High German); *Skalks, Schalk.* A slave (Gothic);
*Hathu,* battle (Old German); *Helith, Held, a* hero, from the same root
*as* the word Celt; *Heer,* an army (Celtic *choris) ; Sieg,* victory;
*Beute,* booty ; *Burg, a* castle; and *many* others.

The etymological history of some of these words is interesting. *Amt*,
for instance, that word of so much significance in modern German
administration, goes back to an ancient Celtic *ambhactos,* which is
compounded of the words *ambi,* about, and *actos,* a past participle
derived from the Celtic root *AG*, meaning to act. Now *ambi* descends
from the primitive Indo-European *mbhi,* where the initial *m* is a kind
of vowel, afterwards represented in Sanscrit by *a*. This *m* vowel
became *n* in those Germanic words which derive directly from the
primitive Indo-European tongue. But the word which is now represented by
*amt* appears in its earliest Germanic form as *ambaht,* thus making
plain its descent from the Celtic

ambhactos.

Again, the word *frei* is found in its earliest Germanic form as
*frijol-s*, which comes from the primitive Indo-European *prijo-s.* The
word here does not, however, mean free; it means beloved (Sanscrit
*priya-s).* In the Celtic language, however, we find *prijos* dropping
its initial *p* - a difficulty in pronouncing this letter was a marked
feature in ancient Celtic; it changed\], according to a regular rule,
into *dd,* and appears in modern Welsh as *rhydd = free.* The
Indo-European meaning persists in the Germanic languages in the name of
the love-goddess, *Freja,* and in the word *Freund,* friend, *Friede,*
peace. The sense borne by the word in the sphere of civil right is
traceable to a Celtic origin,

\[32\]

and in thar sense appears to nave been a loan from Celtic.

The German *Beute,* booty, plunder, has had an instructive history.
There was a Gaulish word *bodi* found in compounds such as the
place-name Segobodium (Seveux), and various personal and tribal names,
including Boudicca, better known to us as the "British warrior queen,"
Boadicea. This word meant anciently "victory." But the fruits of victory
are spoil, and in this material sense the word was adopted in German, in
French *(butin),* in Norse *(byte),* and the Welsh *(budd).* On the
other hand, the word preserved its elevated significance in Irish. In
the Irish translation of Chronicles xxix. II, where the Vulgate original
has "Tua est, Domine, magnificentia et potentia et gloria et Victoria,"
the word *victoria* is rendered by the Irish *buaidh,* and, as de
Jubainville remarks, "ce n'est pas de butin qu'il s'agit." He goes on to
say *"Buaidh* has preserved in Irish, thanks to a vigorous and
persistent literary culture, the high meaning which it bore in the
tongue of the Gaulish aristocracy. The material sense of the word was
alone perceived by the lower classes of the population, and it is the
tradition of this lower class which has been preserved in the German,
the French, and the Cymric languages," \["Premier' Habitantas" ii, 355,
356\].

Two things, however, the Celts either could not or would not impose on
the subjugated German tribes - their language and their religion. In
these two great factors of race-unity and pride lay the seeds of the
ultimate German uprising and overthrow of the Celtic supremacy. The
names of the German are different from those of the Celtic deities,
their funeral customs, with which are associated the deepest religious
conceptions of primitive races, are different. The Celts, or

\[33\]

at least the dominant section of them, buried their dead, regarding the
use of fire as a humiliation, to be inflicted on criminals, or upon
slaves or prisoners in those terrible human sacrifices which are the
greatest stain on their native Culture. The Germans, on the other hand,
burned their illustrious dead on pyres, like the early Greeks - if a
pyre could not be afforded for the whole body, the noblest parts, such
as the head and arms, were burned and the rest buried.

 

Downfall of the Celtic Empire

What exactly took place at the time of the German revolt we shall never
know ; certain it is, however, that from about the year 300 B.C. onward
the Celts appear to have lost whatever political cohesion and common
purpose they had possessed. Rent asunder, as it were, by the upthrust of
some mighty subterranean force, their tribes rolled down like
lava-streams to the south, east, and west of their original home. Some
found their way into Northern Greece, where they committed the outrage
which so scandalised their former friends and allies in the sack of the
shrine of Delphi (273 B.C.). Others renewed, with worse fortune, the old
struggle with Rome, and perished in vast numbers at Sentinum (295 B.C.)
and Lake Vadimo (283 B.C.). One detachment penetrated into Asia Minor,
and founded the Celtic State of Galatia, where, as St. Jerome attests, a
Celtic dialect was still spoken in the fourth century A.D. Others
enlisted as mercenary troops with Carthage. A tumultuous war of Celts
against scattered German tribes, or against other Celts who represented
earlier waves of emigration and Conquest, went on all over Mid-Europe,
Gaul, and Britain. When this settled down Gaul and the British Islands
remained practically the sole relics of the Celtic

\[34\]

empire, the only countries still under Celtic law and leadership. By the
commencement of the Christian era Gaul and Britain had fallen under the
yoke of Rome, and their complete Romanisation was only a question of
time.

 

Unique Historical Position of Ireland

Ireland alone was never even visited, much less subjugated, by the Roman
legionaries, and maintained its independence against all comers
nominally until the close of the twelfth century, but for all practical
purposes a good three hundred years longer.

Ireland has therefore this unique feature of interest, that it carried
an indigenous Celtic civilisation, Celtic institutions, art, and
literature, and the oldest surviving form of the Celtic language \[Irish
is probably an older form of Celtic speech than Welsh. This is shown by
many philological peculiarities of the Irish language, of which one of
the most interesting may here be briefly referred to. The Goidelic or
Gaelic Celts, who, according to the usual theory, first colonised the
British Islands, and who were forced by successive waves of invasion by
their Continental kindred to the extreme west, had a peculiar dislike to
the pronunciation of the letter *p*. Thus the Indo-European particle
*pare,* represented by Greek *παρά* beside or close to, becomes in early
Celtic *are*, as in the name *Are-morici* the Armoricans, those who
dwell *ar* *muir,* by the sea); *Are-dunum* Ardin, in France);
*Are-cluta,* the place beside the Clota (Clyde),now Dumbarton ;
*Are-taunon,* in Germany (near the Taunus Mountains), &c. When this
letter was not simply dropped it was usually changed into *c (k, g).*
But about the sixth century B.C. remarkable change passed over the
language of the Continental Celts. They gained in some unexplained way
the faculty for pronouncing *p*, and even substituted it for existing
*c* sounds ; thus the original *Cretanus* became *Pretanis,* Britain,
the numeral *qetuares* (four) became *petuares,* and so forth. Celtic
place-names in Spain show that this change must have taken place before
the Celtic conquest of that country, 500 B.C. Now a comparison of many
Irish and Welsh words shows distinctly this, avoidance of *p* on the
Irish side and lack of any objection to it on the Welsh. The following
are a few illustrations:

 The conclusion that Irish must represent the older form of the language
seems obvious. It is remarkable that even to a comparatively late date
the Irish preserved their dislike to *p*. Thus, they turned the Latin
*Pascha* (Easter) to *Casg; purpur,* purple, to *corcair, pulsatio*
(through French *pouls*) to *cuisle*. It must be noted, however, that
Nicholson in his "Keltic Researches" endeavours to show that the
so-called Indo-European *p* - that is, *p* standing alone and uncombined
with another consonant -n was pronounced by the Goidelic Celts at an
early period. The subject can hardly be said to be cleared up yet.\]
ight across the chasm which separates the antique from the modern world,

\[35\]

the pagan from the Christian world, and on into the fll light of modern
history and observation.

 

The Celtic Character

The moral no less than the physical characteristics attributed by
classical writers to the Celtic peoples show a remarkable distinctness
and consistency. Much of what is said about them might, as we should
expect, be said of any primitive and unlettered people, but there
remains so much to differentiate them among the races of mankind that if
these ancient references to the Celts could be read aloud, without
mentioning the name of the race to whom they referred, to any person
acquainted with it through modern history alone, he would, I think,
without hesitation, name the Celtic peoples as the subject of the
description which he had heard.

Some of these references have already been quoted, and we need not
repeat the evidence derived from Plato, Ephorus, or Arrian. But an
observation of

\[36\]

M. Porcius Cato *on* the Gauls may be adduced. "There are two things,"
he says, "to which the Gauls are devoted - the art of war and subtlety
of speech" ("rem militarem et argute loqtui").

 

Caesars Account

Caesar has given us a careful and critical account of them as he knew
them in Gaul. They were, he says, eager for battle, but easily dashed by
reverses. They were extremely superstitious, submitting to their Druids
in all public and private affairs, and regarding it as the worst of
punishments to be excommunicated and forbidden to approach the
ceremonies of religion:

"They who are thus interdicted \[for refusing to obey a Druidical
sentence\] are reckoned in the number of the vile and wicked; all
persons avoid and fly their company and discourse, lest they should
receive any infection by contagion; they are not permitted to commence a
suit; neither is any post entrusted to them. . . . The Druids are
generally freed from military service, nor do they pay taxes with the
rest. . . . Encouraged by such rewards, many of their own accord come to
their schools, and are sent by their friends and relations. They are
said there to get by heart a great number of verses; some continue
twenty years in their education; neither is it held lawful to commit
these things \[the Druidic doctrines\] to writing, though in almost all
public transactions and private accounts they use the Greek characters."

The Gauls were eager for news, besieging merchants and travellers for
gossip \[The Irish, says Edmund Spenser, in his "View of the Present
State of Ireland," "use commonyle to send up and down to know newes, and
yf any meet with another, his second woorde is, "What newes ?"\] easily
influenced, sanguine,

\[37\]

credulous, fond of change, and wavering in their counsels. They were at
the same time remarkably acute and intelligent, very quick to seize upon
and to imitate any contrivance they found useful. Their ingenuity in
baffling the novel siege apparatus of the Roman armies is specially
noticed by Caesar. Of their courage he speaks with great respect,
attributing their scorn of death, in some degree at least, to their firm
faith in the immortality of the soul, \[Compare Spenser: "I have heard
some greate warriors say, that in all the services which they had seen
abroad in forrayne countreys, they never saw a more comely horseman than
the Irish man, nor that cometh on more bravely in his charge . . . they
are very valiante and hardye, for the most part great endurours of cold,
labour, hunger and all hardiness, very active and stronge of hand, very
swift of foote, very vigilaunte and circumspect in theyr enterprises,
very present in perrils, very great scorners of death."\] A people who
in earlier days had again and again annihilated Roman armies, had sacked
Rome, and who had more than once placed Caesar himself in positions of
the utmost anxiety and peril, were evidently no weaklings, whatever
their religious beliefs or practices. Caesar is not given to sentimental
admiration of his foes, but one episode at the siege of Avaricum moves
him to immortalise the valour of the defence, A wooden structure or
*agger* had been raised by the Romans to overtop the walls, which had
proved impregnable to the assaults of the battering-ram. The Gauls
contrived to set this on fire. It was of the utmost moment to prevent
the besiegers from extinguishing the flames, and a Gaul mounted a
portion of the wall above the *agger*, throwing down upon it balls of
tallow and pitch, which were handed up to him from within. He was soon
struck down by a missile from a Roman catapult. Immediately another
stepped over him as he lay, and continued his comrade's task. He too
fell,

\[38\]

but a third instantly took his place, and a fourth ; nor was this post
ever deserted until the legionaries at last extinguished the flames and
forced the defenders back into the town, which was finally captured on
the following day.

 

Strabo on the Celts

The geographer and traveller Strabo, who died 24 A.D., and was therefore
a little later than Caesar, has much to tell us about the Celts. He
notices that their country (in this case Gaul) is thickly inhabited and
well tilled - there is no waste of natural resources. The women are
prolific, and notably good mothers. He describes the men as warlike,
passionate, disputatious, easily provoked, but generous and
unsuspicious, and easily vanquished by stratagem. They showed themselves
eager for culture, and Greek letters and science had spread rapidly
among them from Massilia; public education was established in their
towns. They fought better on horseback than on foot, and in Strabo's
time formed the flower of the Roman cavalry. They dwelt in great houses
made of arched timbers with walls of wickerwork - no doubt plastered
with clay and lime, as in Ireland - and thickly thatched. Towns of much
importance were found in Gaul, and Caesar notes the strength of their
walls, built of stone and timber. Both Caesar and Strabo agree that
there was a very sharp division between the nobles and priestly or
educated class on the one hand and the common people on the other, the
latter being kept in strict subjection. The social division corresponds
roughly, no doubt, to the race distinction between the true Celts and
the aboriginal populations subdued by them. While Caesar tells us that
the Druids taught the immortality of the soul, Strabo adds that they
believed in

\[39\]

the indestructibility, which implies in some sense the divinity, of the
material universe.

The Celtic warrior loved display. Everything that gave brilliance and
the sense of drama to life appealed to him. His weapons were richly
ornamented, his horse-trappings were wrought in bronze and enamel, of
design as exquisite as any relic of Mycenaean or Cretan art, his raiment
was embroidered with gold. The scene of the surrender of Vercingetorix,
when his heroic struggle with Rome had come to an end on the fall of
Alesia, is worth recording as a typically Celtic blend of chivalry and
of what appeared to the sober-minded Romans childish ostentation. \[The
scene of the surrender of Vercingetorix is not recounted by Caesar, and
rests mainly on the authority of Plutarch and of the hIstorian Florus,
but it is accepted by scholars (Mommsen. Long, &c.) as historic\] When
he saw that the cause was lost he summoned a tribal council, and told
the assembled chiefs, whom he had led through a glorious though
unsuccessful war, that he was ready to sacrifice himself for his still
faithful followers - they might send his head to Caesar if they liked,
or he would voluntarily surrender himself for the sake of getting easier
terms for his countrymen. The latter alternative was chosen.
Vercingetorix then armed himself with his most splendid weapons, decked
his horse with its richest trappings, and, after riding thrice round the
Roman camp, went before Caesar and laid at his feet the sword which was
the sole remaining defence of Gallic independence. Caesar sent him to
Rome, where he lay in prison for six years, and was finally put to death
when Caesar celebrated his triumph.

But the Celtic love of splendour and of art were mixed with much
barbarism. Strabo tells us how the warriors rode home from victory with
the heads of fallen

\[40\]

foemen dangling from their horses' necks, just as in the Irish saga the
Ulster hero, Cuchulain, is represented as driving back to Emania from a
foray into Connacht with the heads of his enemies hanging from tiis
chariot-rim. Their domestic arrangements were rude; they lay on the
ground to sleep, sat on couches of straw, and their women worked in the
fields.

 

PoIybius

A characteristic scene from the battle of Clastidium (222 B.C.) is
recorded by Polybius. The Gaesati, \[These were a tribe who took their
name from the *gaesum*, a kind of Celtic javelin, which was their
principal weapon. The torque, or twisted collar of gold, is introduced
as a typical ornament in the well-known statue of the dying Gaul,
commonly called "The Dying Gladiator." Many examples are preserved in
the National Museum of Dublin.\] he tells us, who were in the forefront
of the Celtic army, stripped naked for the fight, and the sight of these
warriors, with their great stature and their fair skins, on which
glittered the collars and bracelets of gold so loved as an adornment by
all the Celts, filled the Roman legionaries with awe. Yet when the day
was over those golden ornaments went in cartloads to deck the Capitol of
Rome; and the final comment of Polybius on the character of the Celts is
that they, "I say not usually, but always, in everything they attempt,
are driven headlong by their passions, and never submit to the laws of
reason." As might be expected, the chastity for which the Germans were
noted was never, until recent times, a Celtic characteristic.

 

Diodorus

Diodorus Siculus, a contemporary of Julius Caesar and Augustus, who had
travelled in Gaul, confirms in the main the accounts of Caesar and
Strabo, but adds some

\[41\]

interesting details. He notes in particular the Gallic love of gold.
Even cuirasses were made of it. This is also a very notable trait in
Celtic Ireland, where an astonishing number of prehistoric gold relics
have been found, while many more, now lost, are known to have existed.
The temples and sacred places, say Posidonius and Diodorus, were full of
unguarded offerings of gold, which no one ever touched. He mentions the
great reverence paid to the bards, and, like Cato, notices something
peculiar about the kind of speech which the educated Gauls cultivated:
"they are not a talkative people, and are fond of expressing themselves
in enigmas, so that the hearer has to divine the most part of what they
would say." This exactly answers to the literary language of ancient
Ireland, which is curt and allusive to a degree. The Druid was regarded
as the prescribed intermediary between God and man-no one could perform
a religious act without his assistance.

 

Ammianus Marcellinus

Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote much later, in the latter half of the
fourth century A.D., had also visited Gaul, which was then, of course,
much Romanised. He tells us, however, like former writers, of the great
stature, fairness, and arrogant bearing of the Gallic warrior. He adds
that the people, especially in Aquitaine, were singularly clean and
proper in their persons - no one was to be seen in rags. The Gallic
woman he describes as very tall, blue-eyed, and singularly beautiful;
but a certain amount of awe is mingled with his evident admiration, for
he tells us that while it was dangerous enough to get into a fight with
a Gallic man, your case was indeed desperate if his wife with her "huge
snowy arms," which could strike like catapults, came to his assistance.
One is irresistibly

\[42\]

reminded of the gallery of vigorous, independent, fiery-hearted women,
like Maeve, Grania, Findabair, Deirdre, and the historic Boadicea, who
figure in the myths and in the history of the British Islands.

 

Rice Holmes on the Gauls

The following passage from Dr. Rice Holmes' "Caesar's Conquest of Gaul"
may be taken as an admirable summary of the social physiognomy of that
part of Celtica a little before the time of the Christian era, and it
corresponds closely to all that is known of the native Irish
civilisation

"The Gallic peoples had risen far above the condition of savages ; and
the Celticans of the interior, many of whom had already fallen under
Roman influence, had attained a certain degree of civilisation, and even
of luxury. Their trousers, from which the province took its name of
Gallia Bracata, and their many-coloured tartan skirts and cloaks excited
the astonishment of their conquerors. The chiefs wore rings and
bracelets and necklaces of gold ; and when these tall, fair-haired
warriors rode forth to battle, with their helmets wrought in the shape
of some fierce beast's head, and surmounted by nodding plumes, their
chain armour, their long bucklers and their huge clanking swords, they
made a splendid show. Walled towns or large villages, the strongholds of
the various tribes, were conspicuous on numerous hills. The plains were
dotted by scores of open hamlets. The houses, built of timber and
wickerwork, were large and well thatched. The fields in summer were
yellow with corn. Roads ran from town to town. Rude bridges spanned the
rivers; and barges laden with merchandise floated along them. Ships
clumsy indeed

\[43\]

but larger than any that were seen on the Mediterranean, braved the
storms of the Bay of Biscay and carried cargoes between the ports of
Brittany and the coast of Britain. Tolls were exacted on the goods which
were transported on the great waterways; and it was from the farming of
these dues that the nobles derived a large part of their wealth. Every
tribe had its coinage; and the knowledge of writing in Greek and Roman
characters was not confined to the priests. The Aeduans were familiar
with the plating of copper and of tin. The miners of Aquitaine, of
Auvergne, and of the Berri were celebrated for their skill. Indeed, in
all that belonged to outward prosperity the peoples of Gaul had made
great strides since their kinsmen first came into contact with Rome."
\[' "Caesar's Conquest of Gaul," pp. I0, II. Let it he added that the
aristocratic Celts were, like the Teutons, dolichocephalic - that is to
say, they had heads long in proportion to their breadth. This is proved
by remains found in the basin of the Marne, which was thickly populated
by them. In one case the skeleton of the tall Gallic warrior was found
with his war-car, iron helmet, and sword, now in the Musée de
St.-Germain. The inhabitants of the British Islands arc uniformly
long-headed, the round-headed "Alpine" type occurring very rarely. Those
of modern France are round-headed. The shape of the head, however, is
now known to he by no means a constant racial character. It alters
rapidly in a new environment, as is shown by measurements of the
descendants of immigrants in America. See an article on this subject by
Professor Haddon in in "Nature," Nov. 3, 1910. \]

 

Weakness of the Celtic Policy

Yet this native Celtic civilisation, in many respects so attractive and
so promising, had evidently some defect or disability which prevented
the Celtic peoples from holding their own either against the ancient
civilisation of the Graeco-Roman world, or against the rude young vigour
of the Teutonic races. Let us consider what this was.

\[44\]

  
The Classical State

At the root of the success of classical nations lay the conception of
the civic community, the πολις the *res publica, as a* kind of divine
entity, the foundation of blessing to men, venerable for its age, yet
renewed in youth with every generation; a power which a man might
joyfully serve, knowing that even if not remembered in its records his
faithful service would outlive his own petty life and go to exalt the
life of his motherland or city for all future time. In this spirit
Socrates, when urged to evade his death sentence by taking the means of
escape from prison which his friends offered him, rebuked them for
inciting him to an impious violation of his country's laws. For a man's
country, he says, is more holy and venerable than father or mother, and
he must quietly obey the laws, to which he has assented by living under
them all his life, or incur the just wrath of their great Brethren, the
Laws of the Underworld, before whom, in the end, he must answer for his
conduct on earth. In a greater or less degree this exalted conception of
the State formed the practical religion of every man among the classical
nations of antiquity, and gave to the State its cohesive power, its
capability of endurance and of progress.

 

Teutonic Loyalty

With the Teuton the cohesive force was supplied by another motive, one
which was destined to mingle with the civic motive and to form, in union
with it - and often in predominance over it - the main political factor
in the development of the European nations. This was the sentiment of
what the Germans called *Treue,* the personal fidelity to a chief, which
in very

\[45\]

early times extended itself to a royal dynasty, a sentiment rooted
profoundly in the Teutonic nature, and one which has never been
surpassed by any other human impulse as the source of heroic
self-sacrifice.

 

Celtic Religion

No human influences are ever found pure and unmixed. The sentiment of
personal fidelity was not unknown to the classical nations. The
sentiment of civic patriotism, though of slow growth among the Teutonic
races, did eventually establish itself there. Neither sentiment was
unknown to the Celt, but there was another force which, in his case,
overshadowed and dwarfed them, and supplied what it could of the
political inspiration and unifying power which the classical nations got
from patriotism and the Teutons from loyalty. This was Religion; or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say Sacerdotalism - religion
codified in dogma and administered by a priestly caste. The Druids, as
we have seen from Caesar, whose observations are entirely confirmed by
Strabo and by references in Irish legends, \[In the "Táin Bo Cuajlgne,"
for instance, the King of Ulster must not speak to a messenger until the
Druid, Cathbad, has questioned him. One recalls the lines of Sir Samuel
Ferguson in his Irish epic poem, "Congal ":  

"…. For ever since the time  
When Cathbad smothered Usnach's sons in that foul sea of slime  
Raised by abominable spells at Creeveroe's bloody gate,  
Do ruin and dishonour still on priest-led kings await."\]

were the really sovran power in Celtica. All affairs, public and
private, were subject to their authority, and the penalties which they
could inflict for any assertion of lay independence, though resting for
their efficacy, like the medieval interdicts of the Catholic Church, on
popular superstition

\[46\]

alone, were enough to quell the proudest spirit. Here lay the real
weakness of the Celtic polity. There is perhaps no law written more
conspicuously in the teachings of history than that nations who are
ruled by priests drawing their authority from supernatural sanctions
are, just in the measure that they are so ruled, incapable of true
national progress. The free, healthy current of secular life and thought
is, in the very nature of things, incompatible with priestly rule. Be
the creed what it may, Druidism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, or
fetichism, a priestly caste claiming authority in temporal affairs by
virtue of extra-temporal sanctions is inevitably the enemy of that
spirit of criticism, of that influx of new ideas, of that growth of
secular thought, of human and rational authority, which are the
elementary conditions of national development.

 

The Cursing of Tara

A singular and very cogent illustration of this truth can be drawn from
the history of the early Celtic world. In the sixth century A. D., a
little over a hundred years after the preaching of Christianity by St.
Patrick, a king named Dermot MacKerval \[*Celtice*, Diarmuid mac
Cearbhaill\] ruled in Ireland. He was the Ard Righ, or High King, of
that country, whose seat of government was at Tara, in Meath, and whose
office, with its nominal and legal superiority to the five provincial
kings, represented the impulse which was moving the Irish people towards
a true national unity. The first condition of such a unity was evidently
the establishment of an effective central authority. Such an authority,
as we have said, the High King, in theory, represented. Now it happened
that one of his officers was murdered in the discharge of his duty by a
chief named Hugh Guairy. Guairy

\[47\]

was the brother of a bishop who was related by fosterage to St. Ruadan
of Lorrha, and when King Dermot sent to arrest the murderer these clergy
found him a hiding-place. Dermot, however, caused a search to be made,
haled him forth from under the roof of St. Ruadan, and brought him to
Tara for trial. Immediately the ecclesiastics of Ireland made common
cause against the lay ruler who had dared to execute justice on a
criminal under clerical protection. They assembled at Tara, fasted
against the king, \[It was the practice, known In India also, for a
person who was wronged by a superior, or thought himself so, to sit
before the doorstep of the denier of justice and fast until right was
done him. In Ireland a magical power was attributed to the ceremony, the
effect of which would be averted by the other person fasting as well.\]
and laid their solemn malediction upon him and the seat of his
government. Then the chronicler tells us that Dermot's wife had a
prophetic dream:

"Upon Tara's green was a vast and wide-foliaged tree, and eleven slaves
hewing at it ; but every chip that they knocked from it would return
into its place again and there adhere instantly, till at last there came
one man that dealt the tree but a stroke, and with that single cut laid
it low."

\["Silva Gadelica," by S. H. O'Grady, p. 73\]

The fair tree was the Irish monarchy, the twelve hewers were the twelve
Saints or Apostles of Ireland, and the one who laid it low was St.
Ruadan. The plea of the king for his country, whose fate he saw to be
hanging in the balance, is recorded with moving force and insight by the
Irish chronicler :\[The authority here quoted is a narrative contained
In a fifteenth century vellum manuscript found in Lismore Castle in
1814, and translated by S H. O'Grady In his "Silva Gadelica." The
narrative is attributed to an officer of Dermot's court.\]

\[48\]

  
" 'Alas,' he said, 'for the iniquitous contest that ye have waged
against me; seeing that it is Ireland's good that I pursue, and to
preserve her discipline and royal right; but 'tis Ireland's unpeace and
murderousness that ye endeavour after.' "!

But Ruadan said, "Desolate be Tara for ever and ever" ; and the popular
awe of the ecclesiastical malediction prevailed. The criminal was
surrendered, Tara was abandoned, and, except for a brief space when a
strong usurper, Bran Boru, fought his way to power, Ireland knew no
effective secular government till it was imposed upon her by a
conqueror. The last words of the historical tract from which we quote
are Dermot's cry of despair:

"Woe to him that with the clergy of the churches battle joins."

This remarkable incident has been described at some length because it is
typical of a factor whose profound influence in moulding the history of
the Celtic peoples we can trace through a succession of critical events
from the time of Julius Caesar to the present day. How and whence it
arose we shall consider later; here it is enough to call attention to
it. It is a factor which forbade the national development of the Celts,
in the sense in which we can speak of that of the classical or the
Teutonic peoples.

 

What Europe Owes to the Celt

Yet to suppose that on this account the Celt was not a force of any real
consequence in Europe would be altogether a mistake. His contribution to
the culture of the Western world was a very notable one. For some four
centuries - about A.D. 500 to 900 - Ireland was

\[49\]

the refuge of learning and the source of literary and philosophic
culture for half Europe. The verse-forms of Celtic poetry have probably
played the main part in determining the structure of all modern verse.
The myths and legends of the Gaelic and Cymric peoples kindled the
imagination of a host of Continental poets. True, the Celt did not
himself create any great architectural work of literature, just as he
did not create a stable or imposing national polity. His thinking and
feeling were essentially lyrical and concrete. Each object or aspect of
life impressed him vividly and stirred him profoundly; he was sensitive,
impression able to the last degree, but did not see things in their
larger and more far-reaching relations. He had little girt for the
establishment of institutions, for the service of principles; but he
was, and is) an indispensable and never-failing assertor of humanity as
against the tyranny of principles, the coldness and barrenness of
institutions. The institutions of royalty and of civic patriotism are
both very capable of being fossilised into barren formula, and thus of
fettering instead of inspiring the soul. But the Celt has always been a
rebel against anything that has not in it the breath of life, against
any un-spiritual and purely external form of domination. It is too true
that he has been over-eager to enjoy the fine fruits of life without the
long and patient preparation for the harvest, but he has done and will
still do infinite service to the modern world in insisting that the true
fruit of life is a spiritual reality, never without pain and loss to be
obscured or forgotten amid the vast mechanism of a material
civilisation.
