<B>Earliest References</B></P>

  <P>
IN the chronicles of the classical nations
  for about five hundred years previous to the Christian era there are frequent
  references to a people associated with these nations, sometimes in peace,
  sometimes in war, and evidently occupying a position of great strength and
  influence in the Terra Incognita of Mid-Europe. This people is called by the
  Greeks the Hyperboreans or Celts, the latter term being first found in the
  geographer Hecataeus, about 500 B.C. [He speaks of &quot;Nyrax, a Celtic
  city,&quot; and &quot;Massalia (Marseilles), a city of Liguria in the land of
  the Celts&quot; (Fragmenta Hist. Graec.&quot;)].</P>

  <P>
Herodotus, about half a century later,
  speaks of the Celts as dwelling &quot;beyond the pillars of Hercules &quot; - <I>i.e.,
  </I>in Spain - and also of the Danube as rising in their Country.</P>

  <P>
Aristotle knew that they dwelt &quot;beyond
  Spain,&quot; that they had captured Rome, and that they set great store by
  warlike power. References other than geographical are occasionally met with
  even in early writers. Hellanicus of Lesbos, an historian of the fifth century
  B.C., describes the Celts as practising justice and righteousness. Ephorus,
  about 350 B.C., has three lines of verse about the Celts in which they are
  described as using&quot; the same customs as the Greeks &quot; - whatever that
  may mean - and being on the friendliest terms with that people, who
  established guest friend-ships among them. Plato, however, in the
  &quot;Laws,&quot; classes the Celts among the races who are drunken and
  combative, and much barbarity is attributed to them on the occasion of their
  irruption into Greece and the</P>

  <P>
sacking of Delphi in the year 273 B.C.
  Their attack on Rome and the sacking of that city by them about a century
  earlier is one of the landmarks of ancient history.</P>

  <P>
The history of this people during the time
  when they were the dominant power in Mid-Europe has to be divined or
  reconstructed from scattered references, and from accounts of episodes in
  their dealings with Greece and Rome, very much as the figure of a primeval
  monster is reconstructed by the zoologist from a few fossilised bones. No
  chronicles of their own have come down to us, no architectural remains have
  survived; a few coins, and a few ornaments and weapons in bronze decorated
  with enamel or with subtle and beautiful designs in chased or repouss&#233; work -
  these, and the names which often cling in strangely altered forms to the
  places where they dwelt, from the Euxine to the British Islands, are well-nigh
  all the visible traces which this once mighty power has left us of its
  civilisation and dominion. Yet from these, and from the accounts of classical
  writers, much can be deduced with certainty, and much more can be conjectured
  with a very fair measure of probability. The great Celtic scholar whose loss
  we have recently had to deplore, M. d'Arbois de Jubainville, has, on the
  available data, drawn a convincing outline of Celtic history for the period
  prior to their emergence into full historical light with the conquests of
  Caesar, [in his 'Premiers Habitants de l'Europe,' vol. Ii] and it is this
  outline of which the main features are reproduced here.</P>

The True Celtic Race</P>

  </B>
  <P>
To begin with, we must dismiss the idea
  that Celtica was ever inhabited by a single pure and homogeneous race. The
  true Celts, if we accept on this point the carefully studied and elaborately
  argued conclusion of</P>

  <P>

  <P>
Dr. T. Rice Holmes, ['Caesar's Conquest of
  Gaul,' pp. 251 - 327] supported by the unanimous voice of antiquity, were a
  tall air race, warlike and masterful, [The ancients were not very close
  observers of physical characteristics. They describe the Celts in almost
  exactly the same terms as those which they apply to the Germanic races. Dr.
  Rice Holmes is of opinion that the real difference, physically, lay in the
  fact that the fairness of the Germans was blond, and that of the Celts red. In
  an interesting passage of the work already quoted (p. 315) he observes that,
  &quot;Making every allowance for the admixture of other blood, which must have
  considerably modified the type of the original Celtic or Gallic invaders of
  these islands, we are struck by the fact that among all our Celtic-speaking
  fellow subjects there are to be found numerous specimens of a type which also
  exists in those parts of Brittany which were colonised by British invaders,
  and in those parts of Gaul in which the Gallic invaders appear to have settled
  most thickly, as well as in Northern Italy, where the Celtic invaders were
  once dominant ; and also by the fact that this type, <I>even among the more
  blond representatives of it, is strikingly different to the casual as well as
  to the scientific observer, from that ol the purest representatives of the
  ancient Germans. </I>The well-known picture of Sir David Wilkie, 'Reading of
  the Waterloo Gazette,' illustrates, as Daniel Wilson remarked, the difference
  between the two types. Put a Perthshire Highlander side by side with a Sussex
  farmer. Both will be fair ; but the red hair and heard of the Scot will be in
  marked contrast with the fair hair of the Englishman, and their features will
  differ still more markedly. I remember seeing two gamekeepers in a railway
  carriage running from Inverness to Lairey. They were tall, athletic, fair men,
  evidently belonging to the Scandinavian type, which, as Dr. Beddoc says, is so
  common in the extreme north of Scotland but both in colouring and in general
  aspect they were utterly different from the tall, fair Highlanders whom I had
  Seen in Perth-shire. There was not a trace of red in their hair, their long
  beards being absolutely yellow. The prevalence of red among the Celtic.
  speaking people is, it seems to me, a most striking characteristic. No. only
  do we find eleven men in every hundred whose hair is absolutely red, but
  underlying the blacks and the dark browns the same tint is to he
  discovered.&quot;] whose place of origin (as far as we can trace them) was
  somewhere about the sources of the Danube, and who spread their dominion both
  by conquest and by peaceful</P>

infiltration over Mid-Europe, Gaul, Spain,
  and the British Islands. They did not exterminate the original prehistoric
  inhabitants of these regions - Palaeolithic and Neolithic races,
  dolmen-builders and workers in bronze - but they imposed on them their
  language, their arts, and their traditions, taking, no doubt, a good deal from
  them in return, especially, as we shall see, in the important matter of
  religion. Among these races the true Celts formed an aristocratic and ruling
  caste. In that capacity they stood, alike in Gaul, in Spain, in Britain, and
  in Ireland, in the forefront of armed opposition to foreign invasion. They
  bore the worst brunt of war, of confiscations, and of banishment They never
  lacked valour, but they were not strong enough or united enough to prevail,
  and they perished in far greater proportion than the earlier populations whom
  they had themselves subjugated. But they disappeared also by mingling their
  blood with these inhabitants, whom they impregnated with many of their own
  noble and virile qualities. Hence it comes that the characteristics of the
  peoples called Celtic in the present day, and who carry on the Celtic
  tradition and language, are in some respects so different from those of the
  Celts of classical history and the Celts who produced the literature and art
  of ancient Ireland, and in others so strikingly similar. To take a physical
  characteristic alone, the more Celtic districts of the British Islands are at
  present marked by darkness of complexion, hair, &amp;c. They are not very
  dark, but they are darker than the rest of the kingdom. [See the map of
  comparative nigrescence given in Ripley's &quot;Races of Europe,&quot; p.318.
  In France, however, the Bretons are not a dark race relatively to the reit of
  the population. They are composed partly of the ancient Gallic peoples and
  partly of settlers from Wales who were driven out by the Saxon invasion] But
  the</P>

true Celts were certainly fair. Even the
  Irish Celts of the twelfth century are described by Giraldus Cambrensis as a
  fair race.</P>

  <B>
  <P>
<BR>

  Golden Age of the Celts</P>

  </B>
  <P>
But we are anticipating, and must return to
  the period of the origins of Celtic history. As astronomers have discerned the
  existence of an unknown planet by the perturbations which it has caused in the
  courses of those already under direct observation, so we can discern in the
  fifth and fourth centuries before Christ the presence of a great power and of
  mighty movements going on behind a veil which will never be lifted now. This
  was the Golden Age of Celtdom in Continental Europe. During this period the
  Celts waged three great and successful wars, which had no little influence on
  the course of South European history. About 500 B.C. they conquered Spain from
  the Carthaginians. A century later we find them engaged in the conquest of
  Northern Italy from the Etruscans. They settled in large numbers in the
  territory afterwards known as Cisalpine Gaul, where many names, such as <I>Mediolanum
  </I>(Milan), <I>Addua </I>(Adda), <I>Viro-dunum </I>(Verduno), and perhaps <I>Cremona
  (creamh, </I>garlic) [See for these names Holder's &quot; Altceltischer
  Sprachschattz.&quot;] testify still to their occupation. They left a greater
  memorial in the chief of Latin poets, whose name, Vergil, appears to bear
  evidence of his Celtic ancestry. [Vergil might possibly mean &quot; the
  very-bright '' or illustrious one, a natural form for a proper name. <I>Ver </I>in
  Gallic names (Vercingetorix, Vercsssivellasimus, &amp;c.) is often an
  intensive prefix, like the modern Irish <I>fior</I>.<I> </I>The name of the
  village where Vergil was horn, Andes (now Pietola), is Celtic. His love of
  nature, his mysticism, and his strong feeling for a certain decorative quality
  in language and rhythm are markedly Celtic qualities. Tennyson's phrases for
  him, &quot;landscape-lover, lord of language,&quot; are suggestive in this
  connexion.] Towards the end of the fourth</P>

century they overran Pannonia, conquering
  the Illyrians.</P>

  <B>
  <P>
<BR>

  Alliances with the Greeks</P>

  </B>
  <P>
All these wars were undertaken in alliance
  with the Greeks, with whom the Celts were at this period on the friendliest
  terms. By the war with the Carthaginians the monopoly held by that people of
  the trade in tin with Britain and in silver with the miners of Spain was
  broken down, and the overland route across France to Britain, for the sake of
  which the Phoenicians had in 600 B.C. created the port of Marseilles, was
  definitely secured to Greek trade. Greeks and Celts were at this period allied
  against Phoenicians and Persians. The defeat of Hamilcar by Gelon at Himera,
  in Sicily, took place in the same year as that of Xerxes at Salamis. The
  Carthaginian army in that expedition was made up of mercenaries from half a
  dozen different nations, but not a Celt is found in the Carthaginian ranks,
  and Celtic hostility must have counted for much in preventing the
  Carthaginians from lending help to the Persians for the overthrow ot their
  common enemy. These facts show that Celtica played no small part in preserving
  the Greek type of civilisation from being overwhelmed by the despotisms of the
  East, and thus in keeping alive in Europe the priceless seed of freedom and
  humane culture.</P>

Alexander the Great</P>

  </B>
  <P>
When the counter-movement of Hellas against
  the East began under Alexander the Great we find the Celts again appearing as
  a factor of importance.</P>

  <P>
[22]</P>

  <P>
In the fourth century Macedon was attacked
  and almost obliterated by Thracian and Illyrian hordes. King Amyntas II. was
  defeated and driven into exile. His son Perdiccas II. was killed in battle.
  When Philip, a younger brother of Perdiccas, came to the obscure and tottering
  throne which hc and his successors were to make the seat of a great empire he
  was powerfully aided in making head against the Illyrians by the conquests of
  the Celts in the valleys of the Danube and the Po. The alliance was continued,
  and rendered, perhaps, more formal in the days of Alexander. When about to
  undertake his conquest of Asia (334 B.C.) Alexander first made a compact with
  the Celts &quot;who dwelt by the lonian Gulf&quot; in order to secure his
  Greek dominions from attack during his absence. The episode is related by
  Ptolemy Soter in his history of the wars of Alexander. [Ptolemy, a friend, and
  probably, indeed, half-brother, of Alexander, was doubtless present when this
  incident took place. His work has not survived, but is quoted by Arrian and
  other historians.] It has a vividness which stamps it as a bit of authentic
  history, and another singular testimony to the truth of the narrative has been
  brought to light by de Jubainville. As the Celtic envoys, who are described as
  men of haughty bearing and great stature, their mission concluded) were
  drinking with the king, he asked them, it is said, what was the thing they,
  the Celts, most feared. The envoys replied : &quot;We fear no man : there is
  but one thing that we fear, namely, that the sky should fall on us; but we
  regard nothing so much as the friendship of a man such as thou.&quot;
  Alexander bade them farewell, and, turning to his nobles, whispered:
  &quot;What a vainglorious people are these Celts !&quot; Yet the answer, for
  all its Celtic bravura and flourish,</P>

  <P>
[23]</P>

  <P>
was not without both dignity and courtesy.
  The reference to the falling of the sky seems to give a glimpse of some
  primitive belief or myth of which it is no longer possible to discover the
  meaning. [One is reminded of the folk-tale about Henny Penny, who went to tell
  the king that the sky was falIing] The national oath by which the Celts bound
  themselves to the observance of their covenant with Alexander is remarkable.
  If we observe not this engagement,&quot; they said, &quot;may the sky fall on
  us and crush us, may the earth gape and swallow us up, may the sea burst out
  and overwhelm us.&quot; De Jubainville draws attention most appositely to a
  passage from the &quot;T&#225;in Bo Cuailgne,&quot; in the Book of Leinster, [The
  Book of Leinster is a manuscript of the twelfth century. The version of the
  &quot; T&#225;in &quot; given in it probably dates from the eighth. See de
  Jubainville, &quot; Premiers Habitants,&quot; ii. 316.] where the Ulster
  heroes declare to their king, who wished to leave them in battle in order to
  meet an attack in another part of the field &quot;Heaven is above us, and
  earth beneath us, and the sea is round about us. Unless the sky shall fall
  with its showers of stars on the ground where we are camped, or unless the
  earth shall be rent by an earthquake) or unless the waves of the blue sea come
  over the forests of the living world, we shall not give ground.&quot; [Dr.
  Douglas Hyde in his &quot;Literary History of Ireland &quot; (p.7) gises a
  slightly different translation] This survival of a peculiar oath-formula or
  more than a thousand years, and its reappearance, after being first heard of
  among the Celts of Mid-Europe, in a mythical romance of Ireland, is certainly
  most curious, and, with other facts which we shall note hereafter, speaks
  strongly for the community and persistence of Celtic culture.[It is also a
  testimony to the close accuracy of the narrative of Ptolemy.]</P>

  <P>
The Sack of Rome</P>

  </B>
  <P>
We have mentioned two of the great wars of
  the Continental Celts; we come now to the third, that with the Etruscans,
  which ultimately brought them into conflict with the greatest power of pagan
  Europe, and led to their proudest feat of arms, the sack of Rome. About the
  year 400 B.C. the Celtic Empire seems to have reached the height of its power.
  Under a king named by Livy Ambicatus, who was probably the head of a dominant
  tribe in a military confederacy, like the German Emperor in the present day,
  the Celts seem to have been welded into a considerable degree of political
  unity, and to have followed a consistent policy. Attracted by the rich land of
  Northern Italy, they poured down through the passes of the Alps, and after
  hard fighting with the Etruscan inhabitants they maintained their ground
  there. At this time the Romans were pressing on the Etruscans from below, and
  Roman and Celt were acting in definite concert and alliance. But the Romans,
  despising perhaps the Northern barbarian warriors, had the rashness to play
  them false at the siege of Clusium, 391 B.C., a place which the Romans
  regarded as one of the bulwarks of Latium against the North. The Celts
  recognised Romans who had come to them in the sacred character of ambassadors
  fighting in the ranks of the enemy. The events which followed are, as they
  have come down to us, much mingled with legend, but there are certain touches
  of dramatic vividness in which the true character of the Celts appears
  distinctly recognisable. They applied, we arc told, to Rome for satisfaction
  for the treachery of the envoys, who were three sons of Fabius Ambustus, the
  chief pontiff. The Romans refused to listen to the claim, and elected the
  Fabii military tribunes for the</P>

  <P>
[25]</P>

  <P>
ensuing year. Then the Celts abandoned the
  siege of Clusium and marched straight on Rome. The army showed perfect
  discipline. There was no indiscriminate plundering and devastation, no city or
  fortress was assailed. &quot;We are bound for Rome&quot; was their cry to the
  guards upon the walls of the provincial towns, who watched the host in wonder
  and fear as it rolled steadily to the south. At last they reached the river
  Allia, a few miles from Rome, where the whole available force of the city was
  ranged to meet them. The battle took place on July 18, 390, that ill-omened <I>dies
  Alliensis </I>which long perpetuated in the Roman calendar the memory of the
  deepest shame the republic had ever known. The Celts turned the flank of the
  Roman army, and annihilated it in one tremendous charge. Three days later they
  were in Rome, and for nearly a year they remained masters of the city, or of
  its ruins, till a great fine had been exacted and full vengeance taken for the
  perfidy at Clusium. For nearly a century after the treaty thus concluded there
  was peace between the Celts and the Romans, and the breaking of that peace
  when certain Celtic tribes allied themselves with their old enemy, the
  Etruscans, in the third Samnite war was coincident with the breaking up of the
  Celtic Empire. [Roman history tells of various confiicts with the Celts during
  thia period, but de Jubainville has shown that these narratives are almost
  entirely mythical. See &quot;Premiers Habitant;&quot; ii. 318-323.]</P>

  <P>
Two questions must now be considered before
  we can leave the historical part of this Introduction. First of all, what are
  the evidences for the wide-spread diffusion of Celtic power in Mid-Europe
  during this period? Secondly, where were the Germanic peoples, and what was
  their position in regard to the Celts ?</P>

  <P>
Celtic Place-names in Europe</P>

  </B>
  <P>
To answer these questions fully would take
  us (for the purposes of this volume) too deeply into philological discussions,
  which only the Celtic scholar can fully appreciate. The evidence will be found
  fully set forth in de Jubainville's work, already frequently referred to. The
  study of European place-names forms the basis of the argument. Take the Celtic
  name <I>Noviomagus, </I>composed of two Celtic words, the adjective meaning
  new, and <I>magos </I>(Irish <I>magh) </I>a field or plain.[e.g., Moymell (<I>magh-meala</I>),
  the Plain of Honey a Gaelic name for Fairyland and many<I> </I>place-names]
  There were nine places of this name known in antiquity. Six were in France,
  among them the places now called Noyon, in Oise, Nijon, in Vosges, Nyons, in
  Dr&#244;me. Three outside of France were Nim&#232;gue, in Belgium, Neumagen, in the
  Rhineland, and one at Speyer, in the Palatinate.</P>

  <P>
The word <I>dunum, </I>so often traceable
  in Gaelic place names in the present day (Dundalk, Dunrobin, &amp;c.), and
  meaning fortress or castle, is another typically Celtic element in European
  place-names. It occurred very frequently in France - e.g., <I>Lug-dunum </I>(Lyons),
  <I>Viro-dunum </I>(Verdun). It is also found in Switzerland - e.<I>g.,
  Minno-dunum </I>(Moudon), <I>Eburo-dunum </I>(Yverdon) - and in the
  Netherlands, where the famous city of Leyden goes back to a Celtic <I>Lug-dunum.
  </I>In Great Britain the Celtic term was often changed by simple translation
  into <I>castra</I>; thus <I>Camulo-dunum </I>became Colchester, <I>Bran-dunum </I>Brancaster.
  In Spain and Portugal eight names terminating in <I>dunum </I>are mentioned by
  classical writers. In Germany the modern names Kempton, Karnberg, Liegnitz, go
  back respectively to the Celtic forms <I>Cambo-dunum,
  Carro-</P>

  </I>
  <P>
[27]</P>

  <I>
  <P>
aunum, Lugi-dunum, </I>and
  we find a <I>Singi-dunum, </I>now Belgrade, in Servia, a <I>Novi-dunum, </I>now
  Isaktscha, in Roumania, <I>a Carro-dunum </I>in South Russia, near the
  Dniester, and another in Croatia, now Pitsmeza. <I>Sego-dunum, </I>now Rodez,
  in France, turns up also in Bavaria (Wurzburg), and in England <I>(Sege-dunum,
  </I>now Wallsend, in Northumberland), and the first term, <I>sego, </I>is
  traceable in Segorbe (<I>Sego-briga</I>), in Spain. <I>Briga </I>is a Celtic
  word, the origin of the German <I>burg, </I>and equivalent in meaning to <I>dunum.</P>

  </I>
  <P>
One more example: the word <I>magos, </I>a
  plain, which is very frequent as an element of Irish place-names, is found
  abundantly in France, and outside of France, in countries no longer Celtic, it
  appears in Switzerland <I>(Uro-magus, </I>now Promasens), in the Rhineland <I>(Broco-magus,
  </I>Brumath), in the Netherlands, as already noted (Nim&#232;gue), in Lombardy
  several times, and in Austria.</P>

  <P>
The examples given are by no means
  exhaustive, but they serve to indicate the wide diffusion of the Celts in
  Europe and their identity of language over their vast territory. [For these
  and many other examples see de Jubainyille's &quot;Premiers Habitants&quot;
  ii, 255 <I>seq.</I>]</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
Early Celtic Art</P>

  </B>
  <P>
The relics of ancient Celtic art-work tell
  the same story. In the year 1846 a great pre-Roman necropolis was discovered
  at Hallstatt, near Salzburg, in Austria. It contains relics believed by Dr.
  Arthur Evans to date from about 750 to 400 B.C. These relics betoken in some
  cases a high standard of civilisation and considerable commerce. Amber from
  the Baltic is there, Phoenician glass, and gold-leaf of Oriental workmanship.
  Iron swords are found whose hilts and sheaths are richly decorated with gold,
  ivory, and amber.</P>

  <P>
[28]</P>

  <P>
The Celtic culture illustrated by the
  remains at Hallstatt developed later into what is called the La T&#232;ne culture.
  La T&#232;ne was a settlement at the north-eastern end of the Lake of Neuch&#226;tel,
  and many objects of great interest have been found there since the site was
  first explored in 1858. These antiquities represent, according to Dr. Evans,
  the culminating period of Gaulish civilisation, and date from round about the
  third century B.C. The type of art here found must be judged in the light of
  an observation recently made by Mr. Romilly Allen in his &quot;Celtic
  Art&quot; (p.13)</P>

  <P>
&quot;The great difficulty in understanding
  the evolution of Celtic art lies in the fact that although the Celts never
  seem to have invented any new ideas, they professed [<I>sic; </I>? possessed]
  an extraordinary aptitude for picking up ideas from the different peoples with
  whom war or commerce brought them into contact. And once the Celt had borrowed
  an idea from his neighbours he was able to give it such a strong Celtic tinge
  that it soon became something so different from what it was originally as to
  be almost unrecognisable.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Now what the Celt borrowed in the
  art-culture which on the Continent culminated in the La T&#232;ne relics were
  certain originally naturalistic motives for Greek ornaments, notably the pal
  mette and the meander motives. But it was characteristic of the Celt that he
  avoided in his art all imitation of, or even approximation to, the natural
  forms of the plant and animal world. He reduced everything to pure decoration.
  What he enjoyed in decoration was the alternation of long sweeping curves and
  undulations with the concentrated energy of close-set spirals or bosses, and
  with these simple elements and with the suggestion of a few motives derived
  from Greek art he elaborated a most</P>

  <P>
[29]</P>

  <P>
beautiful, subtle, and varied system of
  decoration, applied to weapons, ornaments, and to toilet and household
  appliances of all kinds, in gold, bronze, wood, and stone, and possibly, if we
  had the means of judging, to textile fabrics also. One beautiful feature in
  the decoration of metal-work seems to have entirely originated in Celtica.
  Enamelling was unknown to the classical nations till they learned from the
  Celts. So late as the third century A.D. it was still strange to the classical
  world, as we learn from the reference of Philostratus:</P>

  <P>
&quot;They say that the barbarians who live
  in the ocean [Britons] pour these colours upon heated brass, and that they
  adhere, become hard as stone, and preserve the designs that are made upon
  them.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Dr. J. Anderson writes in the
  &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland&quot; :</P>

  <P>
&quot;The Gauls as well as the Britons - of
  the same Celtic stock - practised enamel-working before the Roman conquest.
  The enamel workshops of Bibracte, with their furnaces, crucibles, moulds,
  polishing-stones, and with the crude enamels in their various stages of
  preparation, have been recently excavated from the ruins of the city destroyed
  by Caesar and his legions. But the Bibracte enamels are the work of mere
  dabblers in the art, compared with the British examples. The home of the art
  was Britain, and the style of the pattern, as well as the association in which
  the objects decorated with it were found, demonstrated with certainty that it
  had reached its highest stage of indigenous development before it came in
  contact with the Roman culture.&quot;<BR>

  [Quoted by Mr. Romilly Allen in &quot;Celtic Art,&quot; p.136]</P>

  <P>
The National Museum in Dublin contains many
  superb examples of Irish decorative art in gold, bronze,</P>

  <P>
[30]</P>

  <P>
and enamels, and the &quot;strong Celtic
  tinge &quot; of which Mr. Romilly Allen speaks is as clearly observable there
  as in the relics of Hallstatt or La T&#232;ne.</P>

  <P>
Everything, then, speaks of a community of
  culture, an identity of race-character, existing over the vast territory known

  Celts and Germans</P>

  </B>
  <P>
But, as we have said before, this territory
  was by no means inhabited by the Celt alone. In particular we have to ask, who
  and where were the Germans, the Teuto-Gothic tribes, who eventually took the
  place of the Celts as the great Northern menace to classical civilisation ?</P>

  <P>
They are mentioned by Pytheas, the eminent
  Greek traveller and geographer, about 300 B.C., but they play no part in
  history till, under the name of Cimbri and Teutones, they descended on Italy
  to be vanquished by Marius at the close of the second century. The ancient
  Greek geographers prior to Pytheas know nothing of them, and assign all the
  territories now known as Germanic to various Celtic tribes.</P>

  <P>
The explanation given by de Jubainville,
  and based by him on various philological considerations, is that the Germans
  were a subject people, comparable to those &quot;un-free tribes &quot; who
  existed in Gaul and in ancient Ireland. They lived under the Celtic dominion,
  and had no independent political existence. De Jubainville finds that all the
  words connected with law and government and war which are common both to the
  Celtic and Teutonic languages were borrowed by the latter from the former.
  Chief among them are the words represented by the modern German <I>Reich, </I>empire,
  <I>Amt, </I>office, and the Gothic <I>reiks, </I>a king, all of which are of
  unquestioned Celtic origin. De Jubainville also numbers among loan words from
  Celtic</P>

  <P>
[31]</P>

  <P>
the words <I>Bann</I>,<I> </I>an order <I>;
  Frei, </I>free; <I>Geisel a hostage; Erbe, </I>an inheritance <I>; Werth, </I>value;
  <I>Weih, </I>sacred; <I>Magus, a </I>slave (Gothic) <I>; Wini, a </I>wife (Old
  High German); <I>Skalks, Schalk. </I>A slave (Gothic); <I>Hathu, </I>battle
  (Old German); <I>Helith, Held, a </I>hero, from the same root <I>as </I>the
  word Celt; <I>Heer, </I>an army (Celtic <I>choris) ; Sieg, </I>victory; <I>Beute,
  </I>booty ; <I>Burg, a </I>castle; and <I>many </I>others.</P>

  <P>
The etymological history of some of these
  words is interesting. <I>Amt</I>, for instance, that word of so much
  significance in modern German administration, goes back to an ancient Celtic <I>ambhactos,
  </I>which is compounded of the words <I>ambi, </I>about, and <I>actos, </I>a
  past participle derived from the Celtic root <I>AG</I>, meaning to act. Now <I>ambi
  </I>descends from the primitive Indo-European <I>mbhi, </I>where the initial <I>m</I>
  is a kind of vowel, afterwards represented in Sanscrit by <I>a</I>. This <I>m</I>
  vowel became <I>n</I> in those Germanic words which derive directly from the
  primitive Indo-European tongue. But the word which is now represented by <I>amt</I>
  appears in its earliest Germanic form as <I>ambaht, </I>thus making plain its
  descent from the Celtic <I>ambhactos.</P>

  </I>
  <P>
Again, the word <I>frei</I> is found in its
  earliest Germanic form as <I>frijol-s</I>, which comes from the primitive
  Indo-European <I>prijo-s. </I>The word here does not, however, mean free; it
  means beloved (Sanscrit <I>priya-s). </I>In the Celtic language, however, we
  find <I>prijos </I>dropping its initial <I>p</I> - a difficulty in pronouncing
  this letter was a marked feature in ancient Celtic; it changed], according to
  a regular rule, into <I>dd, </I>and appears in modern Welsh as <I>rhydd =
  free. </I>The Indo-European meaning persists in the Germanic languages in the
  name of the love-goddess, <I>Freja, </I>and in the word <I>Freund, </I>friend,
  <I>Friede, </I>peace. The sense borne by the word in the sphere of civil right
  is traceable to a Celtic origin,</P>

  <P>
[32]</P>

  <P>
and in thar sense appears to nave been a
  loan from Celtic.</P>

  <P>
The German <I>Beute, </I>booty, plunder,
  has had an instructive history. There was a Gaulish word <I>bodi </I>found in
  compounds such as the place-name Segobodium (Seveux), and various personal and
  tribal names, including Boudicca, better known to us as the &quot;British
  warrior queen,&quot; Boadicea. This word meant anciently &quot;victory.&quot;
  But the fruits of victory are spoil, and in this material sense the word was
  adopted in German, in French <I>(butin), </I>in Norse <I>(byte), </I>and the
  Welsh <I>(budd). </I>On the other hand, the word preserved its elevated
  significance in Irish. In the Irish translation of Chronicles xxix. II, where
  the Vulgate original has &quot;Tua est, Domine, magnificentia et potentia et
  gloria et Victoria,&quot; the word <I>victoria </I>is rendered by the Irish <I>buaidh,
  </I>and, as de Jubainville remarks, &quot;ce n'est pas de butin qu'il
  s'agit.&quot; He goes on to say <I>&quot;Buaidh </I>has preserved in Irish,
  thanks to a vigorous and persistent literary culture, the high meaning which
  it bore in the tongue of the Gaulish aristocracy. The material sense of the
  word was alone perceived by the lower classes of the population, and it is the
  tradition of this lower class which has been preserved in the German, the
  French, and the Cymric languages,&quot; [&quot;Premier' Habitantas&quot; ii,
  355, 356].</P>

  <P>
Two things, however, the Celts either could
  not or would not impose on the subjugated German tribes - their language and
  their religion. In these two great factors of race-unity and pride lay the
  seeds of the ultimate German uprising and overthrow of the Celtic supremacy.
  The names of the German are different from those of the Celtic deities, their
  funeral customs, with which are associated the deepest religious conceptions
  of primitive races, are different. The Celts, or</P>

  <P>
[33]</P>

  <P>
at least the dominant section of them,
  buried their dead, regarding the use of fire as a humiliation, to be inflicted
  on criminals, or upon slaves or prisoners in those terrible human sacrifices
  which are the greatest stain on their native Culture. The Germans, on the
  other hand, burned their illustrious dead on pyres, like the early Greeks - if
  a pyre could not be afforded for the whole body, the noblest parts, such as
  the head and arms, were burned and the rest buried.</P>

Downfall of the Celtic Empire</P>

  </B>
  <P>
What exactly took place at the time of the
  German revolt we shall never know ; certain it is, however, that from about
  the year 300 B.C. onward the Celts appear to have lost whatever political
  cohesion and common purpose they had possessed. Rent asunder, as it were, by
  the upthrust of some mighty subterranean force, their tribes rolled down like
  lava-streams to the south, east, and west of their original home. Some found
  their way into Northern Greece, where they committed the outrage which so
  scandalised their former friends and allies in the sack of the shrine of
  Delphi (273 B.C.). Others renewed, with worse fortune, the old struggle with
  Rome, and perished in vast numbers at Sentinum (295 B.C.) and Lake Vadimo (283
  B.C.). One detachment penetrated into Asia Minor, and founded the Celtic State
  of Galatia, where, as St. Jerome attests, a Celtic dialect was still spoken in
  the fourth century A.D. Others enlisted as mercenary troops with Carthage. A
  tumultuous war of Celts against scattered German tribes, or against other
  Celts who represented earlier waves of emigration and Conquest, went on all
  over Mid-Europe, Gaul, and Britain. When this settled down Gaul and the
  British Islands remained practically the sole relics of the Celtic</P>

empire, the only countries still under
  Celtic law and leadership. By the commencement of the Christian era Gaul and

Unique Historical Position of Ireland</P>

  </B>
  <P>
Ireland alone was never even visited, much
  less subjugated, by the Roman legionaries, and maintained its independence
  against all comers nominally until the close of the twelfth century, but for
  all practical purposes a good three hundred years longer.</P>

  <P>
Ireland has therefore this unique feature
  of interest, that it carried an indigenous Celtic civilisation, Celtic
  institutions, art, and literature, and the oldest surviving form of the Celtic
  language [Irish is probably an older form of Celtic speech than Welsh. This is
  shown by many philological peculiarities of the Irish language, of which one
  of the most interesting may here be briefly referred to. The Goidelic or
  Gaelic Celts, who, according to the usual theory, first colonised the British
  Islands, and who were forced by successive waves of invasion by their
  Continental kindred to the extreme west, had a peculiar dislike to the
  pronunciation of the letter <I>p</I>. Thus the Indo-European particle <I>pare,
  </I>represented by Greek <I>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940; </I>beside or close to,
  becomes in early Celtic <I>are</I>, as in the name <I>Are-morici </I>the
  Armoricans, those who dwell <I>ar</I> <I>muir, </I>by the sea); <I>Are-dunum </I>Ardin,
  in France); <I>Are-cluta, </I>the place beside the Clota (Clyde),now Dumbarton
  ; <I>Are-taunon, </I>in Germany (near the Taunus Mountains), &amp;c. When this
  letter was not simply dropped it was usually changed into <I>c (k, g).</I> But
  about the sixth century B.C. remarkable change passed over the language of the
  Continental Celts. They gained in some unexplained way the faculty for
  pronouncing <I>p</I>, and even substituted it for existing <I>c</I> sounds ;
  thus the original <I>Cretanus </I>became <I>Pretanis, </I>Britain, the numeral
  <I>qetuares </I>(four) became <I>petuares, </I>and so forth. Celtic
  place-names in Spain show that this change must have taken place before the
  Celtic conquest of that country, 500 B.C. Now a comparison of many Irish and
  Welsh words shows distinctly this, avoidance of <I>p</I> on the Irish side and
  lack of any objection to it on the Welsh. The following are a few
  illustrations:</P>

&nbsp;The conclusion that Irish must
  represent the older form of the language seems obvious. It is remarkable that
  even to a comparatively late date the Irish preserved their dislike to <I>p</I>.
  Thus, they turned the Latin <I>Pascha </I>(Easter) to <I>Casg; purpur, </I>purple,
  to <I>corcair, pulsatio</I> (through French <I>pouls</I>) to <I>cuisle</I>. It
  must be noted, however, that Nicholson in his &quot;Keltic Researches&quot;
  endeavours to show that the so-called Indo-European <I>p</I> - that is, <I>p</I>
  standing alone and uncombined with another consonant -n was pronounced by the
  Goidelic Celts at an early period. The subject can hardly be said to be

The Celtic Character</P>

  </B>
  <P>
The moral no less than the physical
  characteristics attributed by classical writers to the Celtic peoples show a
  remarkable distinctness and consistency. Much of what is said about them
  might, as we should expect, be said of any primitive and unlettered people,
  but there remains so much to differentiate them among the races of mankind
  that if these ancient references to the Celts could be read aloud, without
  mentioning the name of the race to whom they referred, to any person
  acquainted with it through modern history alone, he would, I think, without
  hesitation, name the Celtic peoples as the subject of the description which he
  had heard.</P>

  <P>
Some of these references have already been
  quoted, and we need not repeat the evidence derived from Plato, Ephorus, or
  Arrian. But an observation of</P>

  <P>
[36]</P>

  <P>
M. Porcius Cato <I>on </I>the Gauls may be
  adduced. &quot;There are two things,&quot; he says, &quot;to which the Gauls
  are devoted - the art of war and subtlety of speech&quot; (&quot;rem militarem
  et argute loqtui&quot;).</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
Caesars Account</P>

  </B>
  <P>
Caesar has given us a careful and critical
  account of them as he knew them in Gaul. They were, he says, eager for battle,
  but easily dashed by reverses. They were extremely superstitious, submitting
  to their Druids in all public and private affairs, and regarding it as the
  worst of punishments to be excommunicated and forbidden to approach the
  ceremonies of religion:</P>

  <P>
&quot;They who are thus interdicted [for
  refusing to obey a Druidical sentence] are reckoned in the number of the vile
  and wicked; all persons avoid and fly their company and discourse, lest they
  should receive any infection by contagion; they are not permitted to commence
  a suit; neither is any post entrusted to them. . . . The Druids are generally
  freed from military service, nor do they pay taxes with the rest. . . .
  Encouraged by such rewards, many of their own accord come to their schools,
  and are sent by their friends and relations. They are said there to get by
  heart a great number of verses; some continue twenty years in their education;
  neither is it held lawful to commit these things [the Druidic doctrines] to
  writing, though in almost all public transactions and private accounts they
  use the Greek characters.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The Gauls were eager for news, besieging
  merchants and travellers for gossip [The Irish, says Edmund Spenser, in his
  &quot;View of the Present State of Ireland,&quot; &quot;use commonyle to send
  up and down to know newes, and yf any meet with another, his second woorde is,
  &quot;What newes ?&quot;] easily influenced, sanguine,</P>

  <P>
[37]</P>

  <P>
credulous, fond of change, and wavering in
  their counsels. They were at the same time remarkably acute and intelligent,
  very quick to seize upon and to imitate any contrivance they found useful.
  Their ingenuity in baffling the novel siege apparatus of the Roman armies is
  specially noticed by Caesar. Of their courage he speaks with great respect,
  attributing their scorn of death, in some degree at least, to their firm faith
  in the immortality of the soul, [Compare Spenser: &quot;I have heard some
  greate warriors say, that in all the services which they had seen abroad in
  forrayne countreys, they never saw a<I> </I>more comely horseman than the
  Irish man, nor that cometh on more bravely in his charge . . . they are very
  valiante and hardye, for the most part great endurours of cold, labour, hunger
  and all hardiness, very active and stronge of hand, very swift of foote, very
  vigilaunte and circumspect in theyr enterprises, very present in perrils, very
  great scorners of death.&quot;] A people who in earlier days had again and
  again annihilated Roman armies, had sacked Rome, and who had more than once
  placed Caesar himself in positions of the utmost anxiety and peril, were
  evidently no weaklings, whatever their religious beliefs or practices. Caesar
  is not given to sentimental admiration of his foes, but one episode at the
  siege of Avaricum moves him to immortalise the valour of the defence, A wooden
  structure or <I>agger </I>had been raised by the Romans to overtop the walls,
  which had proved impregnable to the assaults of the battering-ram. The Gauls
  contrived to set this on fire. It was of the utmost moment to prevent the
  besiegers from extinguishing the flames, and a Gaul mounted a portion of the
  wall above the <I>agger</I>, throwing down upon it balls of tallow and pitch,
  which were handed up to him from within. He was soon struck down by a missile
  from a Roman catapult. Immediately another stepped over him as he lay, and
  continued his comrade's task. He too fell,</P>

  <P>
[38]</P>

  <P>
but a third instantly took his place, and a
  fourth ; nor was this post ever deserted until the legionaries at last
  extinguished the flames and forced the defenders back into the town, which was
  finally captured on the following day.</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
Strabo on the Celts</P>

  </B>
  <P>
The geographer and traveller Strabo, who
  died 24 A.D., and was therefore a little later than Caesar, has much to tell
  us about the Celts. He notices that their country (in this case Gaul) is
  thickly inhabited and well tilled - there is no waste of natural resources.
  The women are prolific, and notably good mothers. He describes the men as
  warlike, passionate, disputatious, easily provoked, but generous and
  unsuspicious, and easily vanquished by stratagem. They showed themselves eager
  for culture, and Greek letters and science had spread rapidly among them from
  Massilia; public education was established in their towns. They fought better
  on horseback than on foot, and in Strabo's time formed the flower of the Roman
  cavalry. They dwelt in great houses made of arched timbers with walls of
  wickerwork - no doubt plastered with clay and lime, as in Ireland - and
  thickly thatched. Towns of much importance were found in Gaul, and Caesar
  notes the strength of their walls, built of stone and timber. Both Caesar and
  Strabo agree that there was a very sharp division between the nobles and
  priestly or educated class on the one hand and the common people on the other,
  the latter being kept in strict subjection. The social division corresponds
  roughly, no doubt, to the race distinction between the true Celts and the
  aboriginal populations subdued by them. While Caesar tells us that the Druids
  taught the immortality of the soul, Strabo adds that they believed in</P>

  <P>
[39]</P>

  <P>
the indestructibility, which implies in
  some sense the divinity, of the material universe.</P>

  <P>
The Celtic warrior loved display.
  Everything that gave brilliance and the sense of drama to life appealed to
  him. His weapons were richly ornamented, his horse-trappings were wrought in
  bronze and enamel, of design as exquisite as any relic of Mycenaean or Cretan
  art, his raiment was embroidered with gold. The scene of the surrender of
  Vercingetorix, when his heroic struggle with Rome had come to an end on the
  fall of Alesia, is worth recording as a typically Celtic blend of chivalry and
  of what appeared to the sober-minded Romans childish ostentation. [The scene
  of the surrender of Vercingetorix is not recounted by Caesar, and rests mainly
  on the authority of Plutarch and of the hIstorian Florus, but it is accepted
  by scholars (Mommsen. Long, &amp;c.) as historic] When he saw that the cause
  was lost he summoned a tribal council, and told the assembled chiefs, whom he
  had led through a glorious though unsuccessful war, that he was ready to
  sacrifice himself for his still faithful followers - they might send his head
  to Caesar if they liked, or he would voluntarily surrender himself for the
  sake of getting easier terms for his countrymen. The latter alternative was
  chosen. Vercingetorix then armed himself with his most splendid weapons,
  decked his horse with its richest trappings, and, after riding thrice round
  the Roman camp, went before Caesar and laid at his feet the sword which was
  the sole remaining defence of Gallic independence. Caesar sent him to Rome,
  where he lay in prison for six years, and was finally put to death when Caesar
  celebrated his triumph.</P>

  <P>
But the Celtic love of splendour and of art
  were mixed with much barbarism. Strabo tells us how the warriors rode home
  from victory with the heads of fallen</P>

  <P>
[40]</P>

  <P>
foemen dangling from their horses' necks,
  just as in the Irish saga the Ulster hero, Cuchulain, is represented as
  driving back to Emania from a foray into Connacht with the heads of his
  enemies hanging from tiis chariot-rim. Their domestic arrangements were rude;
  they lay on the ground to sleep, sat on couches of straw, and their women
  worked in the fields.</P>

  <P>
PoIybius</P>

  </B>
  <P>
A characteristic scene from the battle of
  Clastidium (222 B.C.) is recorded by Polybius. The Gaesati, [These were a
  tribe who took their name from the <I>gaesum</I>, a kind of Celtic javelin,
  which was their principal weapon. The torque, or twisted collar of gold, is
  introduced as a typical ornament in the well-known statue of the dying Gaul,
  commonly called &quot;The Dying Gladiator.&quot; Many examples are preserved
  in the National Museum of Dublin.] he tells us, who were in the forefront of
  the Celtic army, stripped naked for the fight, and the sight of these
  warriors, with their great stature and their fair skins, on which glittered
  the collars and bracelets of gold so loved as an adornment by all the Celts,
  filled the Roman legionaries with awe. Yet when the day was over those golden
  ornaments went in cartloads to deck the Capitol of Rome; and the final comment
  of Polybius on the character of the Celts is that they, &quot;I say not
  usually, but always, in everything they attempt, are driven headlong by their
  passions, and never submit to the laws of reason.&quot; As might be expected,
  the chastity for which the Germans were noted was never, until recent times, a
  Celtic characteristic.</P>

  <P>
[41]</P>

  <P>
interesting details. He notes in particular
  the Gallic love of gold. Even cuirasses were made of it. This is also a very
  notable trait in Celtic Ireland, where an astonishing number of prehistoric
  gold relics have been found, while many more, now lost, are known to have
  existed. The temples and sacred places, say Posidonius and Diodorus, were full
  of unguarded offerings of gold, which no one ever touched. He mentions the
  great reverence paid to the bards, and, like Cato, notices something peculiar
  about the kind of speech which the educated Gauls cultivated: &quot;they are
  not a talkative people, and are fond of expressing themselves in enigmas, so
  that the hearer has to divine the most part of what they would say.&quot; This
  exactly answers to the literary language of ancient Ireland, which is curt and
  allusive to a degree. The Druid was regarded as the prescribed intermediary
  between God and man-no one could perform a religious act without his
  assistance.</P>

Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote much later,
  in the latter half of the fourth century A.D., had also visited Gaul, which
  was then, of course, much Romanised. He tells us, however, like former
  writers, of the great stature, fairness, and arrogant bearing of the Gallic
  warrior. He adds that the people, especially in Aquitaine, were singularly
  clean and proper in their persons - no one was to be seen in rags. The Gallic
  woman he describes as very tall, blue-eyed, and singularly beautiful; but a
  certain amount of awe is mingled with his evident admiration, for he tells us
  that while it was dangerous enough to get into a fight with a Gallic man, your
  case was indeed desperate if his wife with her &quot;huge snowy arms,&quot;
  which could strike like catapults, came to his assistance. One is irresistibly</P>

Rice Holmes on the Gauls</P>

  </B>
  <P>
The following passage from Dr. Rice Holmes'
  &quot;Caesar's Conquest of Gaul&quot; may be taken as an admirable summary of
  the social physiognomy of that part of Celtica a little before the time of the
  Christian era, and it corresponds closely to all that is known of the native
  Irish civilisation</P>

  <P>
&quot;The Gallic peoples had risen far
  above the condition of savages ; and the Celticans of the interior, many of
  whom had already fallen under Roman influence, had attained a certain degree
  of civilisation, and even of luxury. Their trousers, from which the province
  took its name of Gallia Bracata, and their many-coloured tartan skirts and
  cloaks excited the astonishment of their conquerors. The chiefs wore rings and
  bracelets and necklaces of gold ; and when these tall, fair-haired warriors
  rode forth to battle, with their helmets wrought in the shape of some fierce
  beast's head, and surmounted by nodding plumes, their chain armour, their long
  bucklers and their huge clanking swords, they made a splendid show. Walled
  towns or large villages, the strongholds of the various tribes, were
  conspicuous on numerous hills. The plains were dotted by scores of open
  hamlets. The houses, built of timber and wickerwork, were large and well
  thatched. The fields in summer were yellow with corn. Roads ran from town to
  town. Rude bridges spanned the rivers; and barges laden with merchandise
  floated along them. Ships clumsy indeed</P>

  <P>
but larger than any that were seen on the
  Mediterranean, braved the storms of the Bay of Biscay and carried cargoes
  between the ports of Brittany and the coast of Britain. Tolls were exacted on
  the goods which were transported on the great waterways; and it was from the
  farming of these dues that the nobles derived a large part of their wealth.
  Every tribe had its coinage; and the knowledge of writing in Greek and Roman
  characters was not confined to the priests. The Aeduans were familiar with the
  plating of copper and of tin. The miners of Aquitaine, of Auvergne, and of the
  Berri were celebrated for their skill. Indeed, in all that belonged to outward
  prosperity the peoples of Gaul had made great strides since their kinsmen
  first came into contact with Rome.&quot; [' &quot;Caesar's Conquest of
  Gaul,&quot; pp. I0, II. Let it he added that the aristocratic Celts were, like
  the Teutons, dolichocephalic - that is to say, they had heads long in
  proportion to their breadth. This is proved by remains found in the basin of
  the Marne, which was thickly populated by them. In one case the skeleton of
  the tall Gallic warrior was found with his war-car, iron helmet, and sword,

  uniformly long-headed, the round-headed &quot;Alpine&quot; type occurring very
  rarely. Those of modern France are round-headed. The shape of the head,
  however, is now known to he by no means a constant racial character. It alters
  rapidly in a new environment, as is shown by measurements of the descendants
  of immigrants in America. See an article on this subject by Professor Haddon

Weakness of the Celtic Policy</P>

  </B>
  <P>
Yet this native Celtic civilisation, in
  many respects so attractive and so promising, had evidently some defect or
  disability which prevented the Celtic peoples from holding their own either
  against the ancient civilisation of the Graeco-Roman world, or against the
  rude young vigour of the Teutonic races. Let us consider what this was.</P>

<BR>

  The Classical State</P>

  </B>
  <P>
At the root of the success of classical
  nations lay the conception of the civic community, the
  &#960;&#959;&#955;&#953;&#962; the <I>res publica, as a </I>kind of divine
  entity, the foundation of blessing to men, venerable for its age, yet renewed
  in youth with every generation; a power which a man might joyfully serve,
  knowing that even if not remembered in its records his faithful service would
  outlive his own petty life and go to exalt the life of his motherland or city
  for all future time. In this spirit Socrates, when urged to evade his death
  sentence by taking the means of escape from prison which his friends offered
  him, rebuked them for inciting him to an impious violation of his country's
  laws. For a man's country, he says, is more holy and venerable than father or
  mother, and he must quietly obey the laws, to which he has assented by living
  under them all his life, or incur the just wrath of their great Brethren, the
  Laws of the Underworld, before whom, in the end, he must answer for his
  conduct on earth. In a greater or less degree this exalted conception of the
  State formed the practical religion of every man among the classical nations
  of antiquity, and gave to the State its cohesive power, its capability of
  endurance and of progress.</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
Teutonic Loyalty</P>

  </B>
  <P>
With the Teuton the cohesive force was
  supplied by another motive, one which was destined to mingle with the civic
  motive and to form, in union with it - and often in predominance over it - the
  main political factor in the development of the European nations. This was the
  sentiment of what the Germans called <I>Treue, </I>the personal fidelity to a
  chief, which in very</P>

  <P>
[45]</P>

  <P>
early times extended itself to a royal
  dynasty, a sentiment rooted profoundly in the Teutonic nature, and one which
  has never been surpassed by any other human impulse as the source of heroic
  self-sacrifice.</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
Celtic Religion</P>

  </B>
  <P>
No human influences are ever found pure and
  unmixed. The sentiment of personal fidelity was not unknown to the classical
  nations. The sentiment of civic patriotism, though of slow growth among the
  Teutonic races, did eventually establish itself there. Neither sentiment was
  unknown to the Celt, but there was another force which, in his case,
  overshadowed and dwarfed them, and supplied what it could of the political
  inspiration and unifying power which the classical nations got from patriotism
  and the Teutons from loyalty. This was Religion; or perhaps it would be more
  accurate to say Sacerdotalism - religion codified in dogma and administered by
  a priestly caste. The Druids, as we have seen from Caesar, whose observations
  are entirely confirmed by Strabo and by references in Irish legends, [In the
  &quot;T&#225;in Bo Cuajlgne,&quot; for instance, the King of Ulster must not speak
  to a messenger until the Druid, Cathbad, has questioned him. One recalls the
  lines of Sir Samuel Ferguson in his Irish epic poem, &quot;Congal &quot;:<BR>

  </P>

  <P>
&quot;&#133;. For ever since the time<BR>

  When Cathbad smothered Usnach's sons in that foul sea of slime<BR>

  Raised by abominable spells at Creeveroe's bloody gate,<BR>

  Do ruin and dishonour still on priest-led kings await.&quot;]</P>

  <P>
were the really sovran power in Celtica.
  All affairs, public and private, were subject to their authority, and the
  penalties which they could inflict for any assertion of lay independence,
  though resting for their efficacy, like the medieval interdicts of the
  Catholic Church, on popular superstition</P>

  <P>
[46]</P>

  <P>
alone, were enough to quell the proudest
  spirit. Here lay the real weakness of the Celtic polity. There is perhaps no
  law written more conspicuously in the teachings of history than that nations
  who are ruled by priests drawing their authority from supernatural sanctions
  are, just in the measure that they are so ruled, incapable of true national
  progress. The free, healthy current of secular life and thought is, in the
  very nature of things, incompatible with priestly rule. Be the creed what it
  may, Druidism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, or fetichism, a priestly caste
  claiming authority in temporal affairs by virtue of extra-temporal sanctions
  is inevitably the enemy of that spirit of criticism, of that influx of new
  ideas, of that growth of secular thought, of human and rational authority,
  which are the elementary conditions of national development.</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <B>
  <P>
The Cursing of Tara</P>

  </B>
  <P>
A singular and very cogent illustration of
  this truth can be drawn from the history of the early Celtic world. In the
  sixth century A. D., a little over a hundred years after the preaching of
  Christianity by St. Patrick, a king named Dermot MacKerval [<I>Celtice</I>,
  Diarmuid mac Cearbhaill] ruled in Ireland. He was the Ard Righ, or High King,
  of that country, whose seat of government was at Tara, in Meath, and whose
  office, with its nominal and legal superiority to the five provincial kings,
  represented the impulse which was moving the Irish people towards a true
  national unity. The first condition of such a unity was evidently the
  establishment of an effective central authority. Such an authority, as we have
  said, the High King, in theory, represented. Now it happened that one of his
  officers was murdered in the discharge of his duty by a chief named Hugh
  Guairy. Guairy</P>

  <P>
[47]</P>

  <P>
was the brother of a bishop who was related
  by fosterage to St. Ruadan of Lorrha, and when King Dermot sent to arrest the
  murderer these clergy found him a hiding-place. Dermot, however, caused a
  search to be made, haled him forth from under the roof of St. Ruadan, and
  brought him to Tara for trial. Immediately the ecclesiastics of Ireland made
  common cause against the lay ruler who had dared to execute justice on a
  criminal under clerical protection. They assembled at Tara, fasted against the
  king, [It was the practice, known In India also, for a person who was wronged
  by a superior, or thought himself so, to sit before the doorstep of the denier
  of justice and fast until right was done him. In Ireland a magical power was
  attributed to the ceremony, the effect of which would be averted by the other
  person fasting as well.] and laid their solemn malediction upon him and the
  seat of his government. Then the chronicler tells us that Dermot's wife had a
  prophetic dream:</P>

  <P>
&quot;Upon Tara's green was a vast and
  wide-foliaged tree, and eleven slaves hewing at it ; but every chip that they
  knocked from it would return into its place again and there adhere instantly,
  till at last there came one man that dealt the tree but a stroke, and with
  that single cut laid it low.&quot;</P>

  <P>
[&quot;Silva Gadelica,&quot; by S. H.
  O'Grady, p. 73]</P>

  <P>
The fair tree was the Irish monarchy, the
  twelve hewers were the twelve Saints or Apostles of Ireland, and the one who
  laid it low was St. Ruadan. The plea of the king for his country, whose fate
  he saw to be hanging in the balance, is recorded with moving force and insight
  by the Irish chronicler :[The authority here quoted is a narrative contained
  In a fifteenth century vellum manuscript found in Lismore Castle in 1814, and
  translated by S H. O'Grady In his &quot;Silva Gadelica.&quot; The narrative is
  attributed to an officer of Dermot's court.]</P>

  &quot; 'Alas,' he said, 'for the iniquitous contest that ye have waged against
  me; seeing that it is Ireland's good that I pursue, and to preserve her
  discipline and royal right; but 'tis Ireland's unpeace and murderousness that
  ye endeavour after.' &quot;!</P>

  <P>
But Ruadan said, &quot;Desolate be Tara for
  ever and ever&quot; ; and the popular awe of the ecclesiastical malediction
  prevailed. The criminal was surrendered, Tara was abandoned, and, except for a
  brief space when a strong usurper, Bran Boru, fought his way to power, Ireland
  knew no effective secular government till it was imposed upon her by a
  conqueror. The last words of the historical tract from which we quote are
  Dermot's cry of despair:</P>

  <P>
&quot;Woe to him that with the clergy of
  the churches battle joins.&quot;</P>

  <P>
This remarkable incident has been described
  at some length because it is typical of a factor whose profound influence in
  moulding the history of the Celtic peoples we can trace through a succession
  of critical events from the time of Julius Caesar to the present day. How and
  whence it arose we shall consider later; here it is enough to call attention
  to it. It is a factor which forbade the national development of the Celts, in
  the sense in which we can speak of that of the classical or the Teutonic
  peoples.</P>

What Europe Owes to the Celt</P>

  </B>
  <P>
Yet to suppose that on this account the
  Celt was not a force of any real consequence in Europe would be altogether a
  mistake. His contribution to the culture of the Western world was a very
  notable one. For some four centuries - about A.D. 500 to 900 - Ireland was</P>

  <P>
[49]</P>

  <P>
the refuge of learning and the source of
  literary and philosophic culture for half Europe. The verse-forms of Celtic
  poetry have probably played the main part in determining the structure of all
  modern verse. The myths and legends of the Gaelic and Cymric peoples kindled
  the imagination of a host of Continental poets. True, the Celt did not himself
  create any great architectural work of literature, just as he did not create a
  stable or imposing national polity. His thinking and feeling were essentially
  lyrical and concrete. Each object or aspect of life impressed him vividly and
  stirred him profoundly; he was sensitive, impression able to the last degree,
  but did not see things in their larger and more far-reaching relations. He had
  little girt for the establishment of institutions, for the service of
  principles; but he was, and is) an indispensable and never-failing assertor of
  humanity as against the tyranny of principles, the coldness and barrenness of
  institutions. The institutions of royalty and of civic patriotism are both
  very capable of being fossilised into barren formula, and thus of fettering
  instead of inspiring the soul. But the Celt has always been a rebel against
  anything that has not in it the breath of life, against any un-spiritual and
  purely external form of domination. It is too true that he has been over-eager
  to enjoy the fine fruits of life without the long and patient preparation for
  the harvest, but he has done and will still do infinite service to the modern
  world in insisting that the true fruit of life is a spiritual reality, never
  without pain and loss to be obscured or forgotten amid the vast mechanism of a
  material civilisation.</P>
