### <span class="smallcaps">The Muster of the Men of Ireland Here</span>

Ailill Mac Matae sang that night before the battle, and said: 'Arise,
arise,' etc. <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_109.md)

As for Cuchulainn, this is what is told here now.

'Look for us, O my friend, O Loeg, how the Ulstermen are fighting the
battle now.'

'Like men,' said the charioteer.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

'Though I were to go with my chariot, and Oen the charioteer of Conall
Cernach with his chariot, so that we should go from one wing to the
other along the dense mass, neither hoofs nor tyres shall go through
it.'

'That is the stuff for a great battle,' said Cuchulainn. 'Nothing must
be done in the battle,' said Cuchulainn to his charioteer, 'that we
shall not know from you.'

'That will be true, so far as I can,' said the charioteer. 'The place
where the warriors are now from the west,' said the charioteer, 'they
make a breach in the battle eastwards. Their first defence from the
east, they make a breach in the battle westwards.'

'Alas! that I am not whole!' said Cuchulainn; 'my breach would be
manifest like the rest.'
