### The Death of Orlam

They go forth then over Iraird Culend in the morning. Cuchulainn went
forward; he overtook the charioteer of Orlam, son of Ailill and Medb, in
Tamlacht Orlaim, a little to the north of Disert Lochait,

cutting wood there. (According to another version, it is the shaft of
Cuchulainn's chariot that had broken, and it is to cut a shaft that he
had gone when he met Orlam's charioteer. It is the charioteer who cut
the shafts according to this version.)

'It is over-bold, what' the Ulstermen are doing, if it is they who are
yonder,' said Cuchulainn, 'while the host is behind them.' He goes to
the charioteer to reprove him; he thought that he was of Ulster, and he
saw the man cutting wood, that is the chariot-shaft.

'What are you doing here?' said Cuchulainn.

'Cutting chariot-shafts,' said the charioteer. 'We have broken our
chariots hunting the wild deer Cuchulainn yonder. Help me,' said the
charioteer. 'Look only whether you are to select the shafts, or to strip
them.'

'It will be to strip them indeed,' said Cuchulainn.

Then Cuchulainn stripped the shafts through his fingers in the presence
of the other, so that he cleared them both of bark and knots.

'This cannot be your proper work that I put on you,' said the
charioteer; he was greatly afraid. 'Whence are you?' said Cuchulainn.

'The charioteer of Orlam, son of Ailill and Medb,' said he. 'And you?'
said the charioteer.

'My name is Cuchulainn,' said he.

'Alas!' said the charioteer.

'Fear nothing,' said Cuchulainn. 'Where is your master?' said he.

'He is in the trench yonder,' said the charioteer.

'Go forth then with me,' said Cuchulainn, 'for I do not kill charioteers
at all.'

Cuchulainn goes to Orlam, kills him, cuts his head

off, and shakes his head before the host. Then he puts the head on the
charioteer's back, and said to him:

'Take that with you,' said Cuchulainn, 'and go to the camp thus. If you
do not of go thus, a stone will come to you from my sling.'

When he got near the camp, he took the head from his back, and told his
adventures to Ailill and Medb.

'This is not like taking birds,' said she.

And he said, 'Unless I brought it on my back to the camp, he would break
my head with a stone.'
