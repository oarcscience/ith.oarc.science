*The Cattle Raid of Cualnge*, by L. Winifred Faraday, \[1904\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

### The Meeting of the Bulls

They take away the Bull then in that morning of the battle, so that he
met the White-horned at Tarbga in Mag Ai; *i.e.* Tarbguba or
Tarbgleo. <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_114) The first name of that
hill was Roi Dedond. Every one who escaped in the fight was intent on
nothing but beholding the two Bulls fighting.

Bricriu Poison-tongue was in the west in his sadness after Fergus had
broken his head with his draughtmen. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_115) He came with the rest then to see the
combat of the Bulls. The two Bulls went in fighting

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

over Bricriu, so that he died therefrom. That is the Death of Bricriu.

The foot of the Dun of Cualnge lighted on the horn of the other. For a
day and a night he did not draw his foot towards him, till Fergus
incited him and plied a rod along his body.

'’Twere no good luck,' said Fergus, 'that this [combative](errata.htm#0)
old calf which has been brought here should leave the honour of clan and
race; and on both sides men have been left dead through you.' Therewith
he drew his foot to him so that his leg (?) was broken, and the horn
sprang from the other and was in the mountain by him. It was Sliab
n-Adarca <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_116) afterwards.

He carried them then a journey of a day and a night, till he lighted in
the loch which is by Cruachan, and he came to Cruachan out of it with
the loin and the shoulder-blade and the liver of the other on his horns.
Then the hosts came to kill him. Fergus did not allow it, but that he
should go where he pleased. He came then to his land and drank a draught
in Findlethe on coming. It is there that he left the shoulder-blade of
the other. Findlethe afterwards was the name of the land. He drank
another draught in Ath Luain; he left the loin of the other there: hence
is Ath Luain. He gave forth his roar on Iraird Chuillend; it was heard
through all the province. He drank a draught in Tromma. There the liver
of the other fell from his horns; hence is Tromma. He came to Etan
Tairb. <span id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_117) He put his forehead against
the hill at Ath Da Ferta; hence is Etan Tairb in Mag Murthemne. Then he
went on the road of Midluachair

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

in Cuib. There he used to be with the milkless cow of Dairi, and he made
a trench there. Hence is Gort Buraig. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](crc39.htm#fn_118) Then he went till he died
between Ulster and Iveagh at Druim Tairb. Druim Tairb is the name of
that place.
