### The Combat of Larine Mac Nois

'One of you to-morrow to go readily against the other,' said Lugaid.

'He will not be found at all,' said Ailill, 'unless you practise
trickery therein. Any man who comes to you, give him wine, so that his
mind may be glad, and it shall be said to him that that is all the wine
that has been brought from Cruachan. It grieves us that you should be on
water in the camp. And Findabair shall be put at his right hand, and it
shall be said:

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "She shall come to
you, if you bring us the head of the Riastartha."'

A messenger used to be sent to every hero on his night, and that used to
be told to him; he continued to kill every man of them in turn. No one
could be got by them to meet him at last. Larine Mac Nois, brother to
Lugaid, King of Munster, was summoned to them the next day. Great was
his pride. Wine is given to him, and Findabair is put at his right hand.

Medb looked at the two. 'It pleases me, yonder pair,' said she; 'a match
between them would be fitting.'

'I will not stand in your way,' said Ailill; 'he shall have her if he
brings me the head of the Riastartha.' I will bring it,' said Larine.

Then Lugaid comes. 'What man have you for the ford to-morrow?' said he.

'Larine goes,' said Ailill.

Then Lugaid comes to speak with Cuchulainn. They meet in Glenn Firbaith.
Each gives the other welcome.

'It is for this I have come to speak to you,' said Lugaid: 'there is a
churl here, a fool and proud,' said he, 'a brother of mine named Larine;
he is befooled about the same maiden. On your friendship then, do not
kill him, lest you should leave me without a brother. For it is for this
that he is being sent to you, so that we two might quarrel. I should be
content, however, that you should give him a sound drubbing, for it is
in my despite that he comes.'

Larine goes next day to meet Cuchulainn, and the maiden near him to
encourage him. Cuchulainn attacks him without arms. <span

from him perforce. He takes him then between his two hands, and grinds
and shakes him, … and threw him till he was between Lugaid's two hands
…; nevertheless, he is the only man who escaped \[even\] a bad escape
from him, of all who met him on the Tain.

sense, but the passage seems corrupt.
