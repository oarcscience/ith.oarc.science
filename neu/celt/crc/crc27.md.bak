### The Healing of the Morrigan

When Cuchulainn was in this great weariness, the Morrigan met him in the
form of an old hag, and she blind and lame, milking a cow with three
teats, and he asked her for a drink. She gave him milk from a teat.

'He will be whole who has brought it(?),' said Cuchulainn; 'the
blessings of gods and non-gods on you,' said he. (Gods with them were
the Mighty Folk; <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) non-gods the people
of husbandry.)

Then her head was healed so that it was whole.

She gave the milk of the second teat, and her eye was whole; and gave
the milk of the third teat, and

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

her leg was whole. So that this was what he said about each thing of
them, 'A doom of blessing on you,' said he.

'You told me,' said the Morrigan, 'I should not have healing from you
for ever.'

'If I had known it was you,' said Cuchulainn, 'I would not have healed
you ever.'

So that formerly Cuchulainn's throng(?) on Tarthesc was the name of this
story in the Foray.

It is there that Fergus claimed of his securities that faith should not
be broken with Cuchulainn; and it is there that Cuchulainn … <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) *i.e.* Delga Murthemne at that time.

Then Cuchulainn killed Fota in his field; Bomailce on his ford; Salach
in his village (?); Muine in his hill; Luair in Leth-bera; Fer-Toithle
in Toithle; these are the names of these lands for ever, every place in
which each man of them fell. Cuchulainn killed also Traig and Dornu and
Dernu, Col and Mebul and Eraise on this side of Ath Tire Moir, at Methe
and Cethe: these were three <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) druids
and their three wives.

Then Medb sent a hundred men of her special retinue to kill Cuchulainn.
He killed them all on Ath Ceit-Chule. Then Medb said: 'It is
*cuillend* <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) to us, the slaying of our
people.' Hence is Glass Chrau and Cuillend Cind Duin and Ath Ceit-Chule.

Then the four provinces of Ireland took camp and fortified post in the
Breslech Mor in Mag Murthemne, and send part of their cattle and booty
beyond them to the south into Clithar Bo Ulad. Cuchulainn took

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

his post at the mound in Lerga near them, and his charioteer Loeg Mac
Riangabra kindled a fire for him on the evening of that night. He saw
the fiery sheen of the bright golden arms over the heads of the four
provinces of Ireland at the setting of the clouds of evening. Fury and
great rage came over him at sight of the host, at the multitude of his
enemies, the abundance of his foes. He took his two spears and his
shield and his sword; he shook his shield and brandished his spears and
waved his sword; and he uttered his hero's shout from his throat, so
that goblins and sprites and spectres of the glen and demons of the air
answered, for the terror of the shout which they uttered on high. So
that the Nemain produced confusion on the host. The four provinces of
Ireland came into a tumult of weapons about the points of their own
spears and weapons, so that a hundred warriors of them died of terror
and of heart-burst in the middle of the camp and of the position that
night.

When Loeg was there, he saw something: a single man who came straight
across the camp of the men of Ireland from the north-east straight
towards him.

'A single man is coming to us now, O Little Hound!' said Loeg.

'What kind of man is there?' said Cuchulainn.

'An easy question: a man fair and tall is he, with hair cut broad,
waving yellow hair; a green mantle folded round him; a brooch of white
silver in the mantle on his breast; a tunic of royal silk, with red
ornamentation of red gold against the white skin, to his knees. A black
shield with a hard boss of white metal; a five-pointed spear in his
hand; a forked (?) javelin beside it. Wonderful is the play and sport
and

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

exercise that he makes; but no one attacks him, and he attacks no one,
as if no one saw him.'

'It is true, O fosterling,' said he; 'which of my friends from the *síd*
is that who comes to have pity on me, because they know the sore
distress in which I am, alone against the four great provinces of
Ireland, on the Cattle-Foray of Cualnge at this time?'

That was true for Cuchulainn. When the warrior had reached the place
where Cuchulainn was, he spoke to him, and had pity on him for it.

'This is manly, O Cuchulainn,' said he.

'It is not much at all,' said Cuchulainn.

'I will help you,' said the man.

'Who are you at all?' said Cuchulainn.

'It is I, your father from the *síd*, Lug Mac Ethlend.' My wounds are
heavy, it were high time that I should be healed.'

'Sleep a little, O Cuchulainn,' said the warrior; your heavy swoon <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_79) (?.md) of sleep at the mound of Lerga till
the end of three days and three nights, and I will fight against the
hosts for that space.'

Then he sings the *ferdord* to him, and he sleeps from it. Lug looked at
each wound that it was clean. Then Lug said:

'Arise, O great son of the Ulstermen, whole of thy wounds.… Go into thy
chariot secure. Arise, arise!' <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_80.md)

For three days and three nights Cuchulainn was asleep. It were right
indeed though his sleep equalled his weariness. From the Monday after
the end of summer exactly to the Wednesday after Candlemas, for this
space Cuchulainn had not slept, except when

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

he slept a little while against his spear after midday, with his head on
his clenched fist, and his clenched fist on his spear, and his spear on
his knee; but he was striking and cutting and attacking and slaying the
four great provinces of Ireland for that space.

It is then that the warrior of the *síd* cast herbs and grasses of
curing and charms of healing into the hurts and wounds and into the
injuries and into the many wounds of Cuchulainn, so that Cuchulainn
recovered in his sleep without his perceiving it at all.

 

Now it was at this time that the boys came south from Emain Macha:
Folloman Mac Conchobair with three fifties of kings’ sons of Ulster, and
they gave battle thrice to the hosts, so that three times their own
number fell, and all the boys fell except Folloman Mac Conchobair.
Folloman boasted that he would not go back to Emain for ever and ever,
until he should take the head of Ailill with him, with the golden crown
that was above it. This was not easy to him; for the two sons of Bethe
Mac Bain, the two sons of Ailill's foster-mother and foster-father, came
on him, and wounded him so that he fell by them. So that that is the
death of the boys of Ulster and of Folloman Mac Conchobair.

Cuchulainn for his part was in his deep sleep till the end of three days
and three nights at the mound in Lerga. Cuchulainn arose then from his
sleep, and put his hand over his face, and made a purple wheel-beam from
head to foot, and his mind was strong in him, and he would have gone to
an assembly, or a march, or a tryst, or a beer-house, or to one of the
chief assemblies of Ireland.
