*The Cattle Raid of Cualnge*, by L. Winifred Faraday, \[1904\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">Here is the finding of the Bull according to this Version</span>:

It is then that Medb went with a third of the host with her to Cuib to
seek the Bull; and Cuchulainn went after her. Now on the road of
Midluachair she had gone to harry Ulster and Cruthne as far as Dun
Sobairche. Cuchulainn saw something: Bude Mac Bain from Sliab Culinn
with the Bull, and fifteen heifers round him; and his force was sixty
men of Ailill's household, with a cloak folded round every man.
Cuchulainn comes to them.

'Whence have you brought the cattle?' said Cuchulainn.

'From the mountain yonder,' said the man'

'Where are their cow-herds?' said Cuchulainn.

'He is as we found him,' said the man.

Cuchulainn made three leaps after them to seek speech with them as far
as the ford. It is there he said to the leader:

'What is your name?' said he.

'One who fears you not (?) and loves you not; Bude Mac Bain,' said he.

'This spear at Bude!' said Cuchulainn. He hurls at him the javelin, so
that it went through his armpits, and one of the livers broke in two
before the spear.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He kills him on
his ford; hence is Ath Bude. The Bull is brought into the camp then.
They considered then that it would not be difficult to deal with
Cuchulainn, provided his javelin were got from him.
