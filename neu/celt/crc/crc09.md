### The Death of Lethan

Lethan came on to his ford on the Nith(?) in Conaille. He waited himself
to meet Cuchulainn. It vexed him what Cuchulainn had done. Cuchulainn
cuts off his head and left it, hence it is Ath Lethan on the Nith. And
their chariots broke in the battle on the ford by him; hence it is Ath
Carpat. Mulcha, Lethan's charioteer, fell on the shoulder of the hill
that is between them; hence is Gulo Mulchai. While the hosts were going

Yet that was the Morrigan in the form of a bird on the pillar in Temair

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_40"></span>[40:2](crc09.htm#fr_40) Something; apparently
missing here. The passage in LL is as follows: 'It is the same day that
the Morrigan, daughter of Ernmas, came from the Sid, so that she was on
the pillar in Temair Cuailnge, taking a warning to the Dun of Cualnge
before the men of Ireland, and she began to speak to him, and "Good, O
wretched one, O Dun of Cualnge," said the Morrigan, "keep watch, for the
men of Ireland have reached thee, and they will take thee to their camp
unless thou keepest watch"; and she began to take a warning to him thus,
and uttered her words on high.' (The Rhetoric follows as in LU.)
