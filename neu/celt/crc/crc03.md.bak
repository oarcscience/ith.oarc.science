------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_1">p. 1</span>

### THIS IS THE CATTLE-RAID OF CUALNGE

### I

<span class="smallcaps">A great</span> hosting was brought together by
the Connaughtmen, that is, by Ailill and Medb; and they sent to the
three other provinces. And messengers were sent by Ailill to the seven
sons of Magach: Ailill, Anluan, Mocorb, Cet, En, Bascall, and Doche; a
cantred with each of them. And to Cormac Condlongas Mac Conchobair with
his three hundred, who was billeted in Connaught. Then they all come to
Cruachan Ai.

Now Cormac had three troops which came to Cruachan. The first troop had
many-coloured cloaks folded round them; hair like a mantle (?); the
tunic falling (?) to the knee, and long (?) shields; and a broad grey
spearhead on a slender shaft in the hand of each man.

The second troop wore dark grey cloaks, and tunics with red
ornamentation down to their calves, and long hair hanging behind from
their heads, and white shields (?), and five-pronged spears were in
their hands.

'This is not Cormac yet,' said Medb.

Then comes the third troop; and they wore purple cloaks, and hooded
tunics with red ornamentation down to their feet, hair smooth to their
shoulders,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and round shields with engraved edges, and the pillars <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) of a palace in the hand of each man.

'This is Cormac now,' said Medb.

Then the four provinces of Ireland were assembled, till they were in
Cruachan Ai. And their poets and their druids did not let them go thence
till the end of a fortnight, for waiting for a good omen. Medb said then
to her charioteer the day that they set out:

'Every one who parts here to-day from his love or his friend will curse
me,' said she, 'for it is I who have gathered this hosting.'

'Wait then,' said the charioteer, 'till I turn the chariot with the sun,
and till there come the power of a good omen that we may come back
again.'

Then the charioteer turned the chariot, and they set forth. Then they
saw a full-grown maiden before them. She had yellow hair, and a cloak of
many colours, and a golden pin in it; and a hooded tunic with red
embroidery. She wore two shoes with buckles of gold. Her face was narrow
below and broad above. Very black were her two eyebrows; her black
delicate eyelashes cast a shadow into the middle of her two cheeks. You
would think it was with *partaing* <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) her
lips were adorned. You would think it was a shower of pearls that was in
her mouth, that is, her teeth. She had three tresses: two tresses round
her head above, and a tress behind, so that it struck her two thighs
behind her. A shuttle <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5.md) of white metal,
with an inlaying of gold, was in her hand. Each of her two eyes had
three pupils. The maiden was armed, and there were two black horses to
her chariot.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

'What is your name?' said Medb to the maiden.

'Fedelm, the prophetess of Connaught, is my name,' said the maiden.

'Whence do you come?' said Medb.

'From Scotland, after learning the art of prophecy,' said the maiden.

'Have you the inspiration (?): which illumines?' <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) said Medb.

'Yes, indeed,' said the maiden.

'Look for me how it will be with my hosting,' said Medb.

Then the maiden looked for it; and Medb said: 'O Fedelm the prophetess,
how seest thou the host?'

'Fedelm answered and said: 'I see very red, I see red.'

'That is not true,' said Medb; 'for Conchobar is in his sickness at
Emain and the Ulstermen with him, with all the best <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) of their warriors; and my messengers have
come and brought me tidings thence.

'Fedelm the prophetess, how seest thou our host?' said Medb.

'I see red,' said the maiden.

'That is not true,' said Medb; 'for Celtchar Mac Uithichair is in Dun
Lethglaise, and a third of the Ulstermen with him; and Fergus, son of
Roich, son of Eochaid, is here with us, in exile, and a cantred with
him.

'Fedelm the prophetess, how seest thou our host?' said Medb.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

'I see very red, I see red,' said the maiden.

'That matters not,' said Medb; 'for there are mutual angers, and
quarrels, and wounds very red in every host and in every assembly of a
great army. Look again for us then, and tell us the truth.

'Fedelm the prophetess, how seest thou our host?'

'I see very red, I see red,' said Fedelm.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'I see a fair man who will make play

</div>

The Monday after Samain <span id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) they set
forth, and this is the way they took: south-east from Cruachan Ai,
*i.e.* by Muicc Cruimb, by Teloch Teora Crich, by Tuaim Mona, by Cul

Ochtrach, by Midi, by Findglassa Assail, by Deilt, by Delind, by Sailig,

Lochmach, by Anmag, by Deind, by Deilt, by Dubglaiss, by Fid Mor, by
Colbtha, by Cronn, to Cualnge.

From Findabair Cuailnge, it is thence the hosts of Ireland were divided
over the province to seek the Bull. For it is past these places that
they came, till they reached Findabair.

(Here ends the title; and the story begins as follows:—)

#### THIS IS THE STORY IN ORDER

When they had come on their first journey from Cruachan as far as Cul
Sibrinne, Medb told her charioteer to get ready her nine chariots for
her, that she might make a circuit in the camp, to see who disliked and
who liked the expedition.

Now his tent was pitched for Ailill, and the furniture

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

was arranged, both beds and coverings. Fergus Mac Roich in his tent was
next to Ailill; Cormac Condlongas Mac Conchobair beside him; Conall
Cernach by him; Fiacha Mac Fir-Febe, the son of Conchobar's daughter, by
him. Medb, daughter of Eochaid Fedlech, was on Ailill's other side; next
to her, Findabair, daughter of Ailill and Medb. That was besides
servants and attendants.

Medb came, after looking at the host, and she said it were folly for the
rest to go on the hosting, if the cantred of the Leinstermen went.

'Why do you blame the men?' said Ailill.

'We do not blame them,' said Medb; 'splendid are the warriors. When the
rest were making their huts, they had finished thatching their huts and
cooking their food; when the rest were at dinner, they had finished
dinner, and their harpers were playing to them. It is folly for them to
go,' said Medb; 'it is to their credit the victory of the hosts will
be.'

'It is for us they fight,' said Ailill.

'They shall not come with us,' said Medb.

'Let them stay then,' said Ailill.

'They shall not stay,' said Medb. 'They will come on us after we have
gone,' said she, 'and seize our land against us.'

'What is to be done to them?' said Ailill; 'will you have them neither
stay nor go?'

'To kill them,' said Medb.

'We will not hide that this is a woman's plan,' said Ailill; 'what you
say is not good!'

'With this folk,' said Fergus, 'it shall not happen thus (for it is a
folk bound by ties to us Ulstermen), unless we are all killed.'

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

'Even that we could do,' said Medb; 'for I am here with my retinue of
two cantreds,' said she, 'and there are the seven Manes, that is, my
seven sons, with seven cantreds; their luck can protect them,' (?) said
she; 'that is Mane-Mathramail, and Mane-Athramail, and Mane-Morgor, and
Mane-Mingor, and Mane-Moepert (and he is Mane-Milscothach), Mane-Andoe,
and Mane-who-got-everything: he got the form of his mother and of his
father, and the dignity of both.'

'It would not be so,' said Fergus. 'There are seven kings of Munster
here, and a cantred with each of them, in friendship with us Ulstermen.
I will give battle to you,' said Fergus, 'in the middle of the host in
which we are, with these seven cantreds, and with my own cantred, and
with the cantred of the Leinster-men. But I will not urge that,' said
Fergus, 'we will provide for the warriors otherwise, so that they shall
not prevail over the host. Seventeen cantreds for us,' said Fergus,
'that is the number of our army, besides our rabble, and our women (for
with each king there is his queen, in Medb's company), and besides our
striplings. This is the eighteenth cantred, the cantred of the
Leinstermen. Let them be distributed among the rest of the host.'

'I do not care,' said Medb, 'provided they are not gathered as they
are.'

Then this was done; the Leinstermen were distributed among the host.

They set out next morning to Moin Choiltrae, where eight score deer fell
in with them in one herd. They surrounded them and killed them then;
wherever there was a man of the Leinstermen, it was he who

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

got them, except five deer that all the rest of the host got. Then they
came to Mag Trego, and stopped there and prepared their food. They say
that it is there that Dubthach sang this song:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'Grant what you have not heard hitherto,  
 Listening to the fight of Dubthach.  
 A hosting very black is before you,  
 Against Findbend <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) of the wife of
Ailill.

'The man of expeditions will come  
 Who will defend (?) Murthemne.  
 Ravens will drink milk of ——— <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)  
 From the friendship of the swineherds.

'The turfy Cronn <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) will resist them;  
 He will not let them into Murthemne  
 Until the work of warriors is over  
 In Sliab Tuad Ochaine.

'"Quickly," said Ailill to Cormac,  
"Go that you may ——— your son.  
 The cattle do not come from the fields  
 That the din of the host may not terrify them (?).

'"This will be a battle in its time  
 For Medb with a third of the host.  
 There will be flesh of men therefrom  
 If the Riastartha comes to you."'

</div>

Then the Nemain attacked them, and that was not the quietest of nights
for them, with the uproar of the churl (*i.e.* Dubthach) through their
sleep. The host

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

started up at once, and a great number of the host were in confusion,
till Medb carne to reprove him.

Then they went and spent the night in Granard Tethba Tuascirt, after the
host had been led astray over bogs and over A warning was sent from
Fergus to the Ulstermen here, for friendship. They were now in the
weakness, except Cuchulainn and his father Sualtaim.

Cuchulainn and his father went, after the coming of the warning from
Fergus, till they were in Iraird Cuillend, watching the host there.

'I think of the host to-night,' said Cuchulainn to his father. 'Go from
us with a warning to the Ulstermen. I am forced to go to a tryst with
Fedelm Noichride, <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) from my own pledge
that went out to her.'

He made a spancel-withe <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) then before
he went, and wrote an ogam on its ———, and threw it on the top of the
pillar.

The leadership of the way before the army was given to Fergus. Then
Fergus went far astray to the south, till Ulster should have completed
the collection of an army; he did this for friendship. Ailill and Medb
perceived it; it was then Medb said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'O Fergus, this is strange,  
 What kind of way do we go?  
 Straying south or north  
 We go over every other folk.

'Ailill of Ai with his hosting  
 Fears that you will betray them.  
 You have not given your mind hitherto  
 To the leading of the way.

</div>

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">If it is in friendship that you do it,  
 Do not lead the horses  
 Peradventure another may be found  
 To lead the way.'</span>

</div>

Fergus replied:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'O Medb, what troubles you?  
 This is not like treachery.  
 It belongs to the Ulstermen, O woman,  
 The land across which I am leading you.

'It is not for the disadvantage of the host  
 That I go on each wandering in its turn;  
 It is to avoid the great man  
 Who protects Mag Murthemne.

'Not that my mind is not distressed  
 On account of the straying on which I go,  
 But if perchance I may avoid even afterwards  
 Cuchulainn Mac Sualtaim.'

</div>

Then they went till they were in Iraird Cuillend. Eirr and Indell, Foich
and Foclam (their two charioteers), the four sons of Iraird Mac
Anchinne, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) it is they who were before
the host, to protect their brooches and their cushions and their cloaks,
that the dust of the host might not soil them. They found the withe that
Cuchulainn threw, and perceived the grazing that the horses had grazed.
For Sualtaim's two horses had eaten the grass with its roots from the
earth; Cuchulainn's two horses had licked the earth as far as the stones
beneath the grass. They sit down then, until the host came, and the
musicians play to them. They give the withe into the hands of Fergus Mac
Roich; he read the ogam that was on it.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

When Medb came, she asked, 'Why are you waiting here?'

'We wait,' said Fergus, 'because of the withe yonder. There is an ogam
on its ———, and this is what is in it: "Let no one go past till a man is
found to throw a like withe with his one hand, and let it be one twig of
which it is made; and I except my friend Fergus." 'Truly,' said Fergus,
'Cuchulainn has thrown it, and they are his horses that grazed the
plain.'

And he put it in the hands of the druids; and Fergus sang this song:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'Here is a withe, what does the withe declare to us?  
 What is its mystery?  
 What number threw it?  
 Few or many?

'Will it cause injury to the host,  
 If they go a journey from it?  
 Find out, ye druids, something therefore  
 For what the withe has been left.

'——— of heroes the hero who has thrown it,  
 Full misfortune on warriors;  
 A delay of princes, wrathful is the matter,  
 One man has thrown it with one hand.

'Is not the king's host at the will of him,  
 Unless it breaks fair play?  
 Until one man only of you  
 Throw it, as one man has thrown it.  
 I do not know anything save that  
 For which the withe should have been put.  
 Here is a withe.'

</div>

Then Fergus said to them: 'If you outrage this withe,' said he, 'or if
you go past it, though he be in

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

the custody of a man, or in a house under a lock, the ——— of the man who
wrote the ogam on it will reach him, and will slay a goodly slaughter of
you before morning, unless one of you throw a like withe.'

'It does not please us, indeed, that one of us should be slain at once,'
said Ailill. 'We will go by the neck of the great wood yonder, south of
us, and we will not go over it at all.'

The troops hewed down then the wood before the chariots. This is the
name of that place, Slechta. It is there that Partraige is. (According
to others, the conversation between Medb and Fedelm the prophetess took
place there, as we told before; and then it is after the answer she gave
to Medb that the wood was cut down; *i.e.* 'Look for me,' said Medb,
'how my hosting will be.' 'It is difficult to me,' said the maiden; 'I
cannot cast my eye over them in the wood.' 'It is ploughland (?) there
shall be,' said Medb; 'we will cut down the wood.' Then this was done,
so that Slechta was the name of the place.)

They spent the night then in Cul Sibrille; a great snowstorm fell on
them, to the girdles of the men and the wheels of the chariots. The
rising was early next morning. And it was not the most peaceful of
nights for them, with the snow; and they had not prepared food that
night. But it was not early when Cuchulainn came from his tryst; he
waited to wash and bathe.

Then he came on the track of the host. 'Would that we had not gone
there,' said Cuchulainn, 'nor betrayed the Ulstermen; we have let the
host go to them unawares. Make us an estimation of the host,' said
Cuchulainn to Loeg, 'that we may know the number of the host.'

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

Loeg did this, and said to Cuchulainn: 'I am confused,' said he, 'I
cannot attain this.'

'It would not be confusion that I see, if only I come,' said Cuchulainn.

'Get into the chariot then,' said Loeg.

Cuchulainn got into the chariot, and put a reckoning over the host for a
long time.

'Even you,' said Loeg, 'you do not find it easy.'

'It is easier indeed to me than to you,' said Cuchulainn; 'for I have
three gifts, the gifts of eye, and of mind, and of reckoning. I have put
a reckoning <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) on this,' said he;
'there are eighteen cantreds,' said he, 'for their number; only that the
eighteenth cantred is distributed among all the host, so that their
number is not clear; that is, the cantred of the Leinstermen.'

Then Cuchulainn went round the host till he was at Ath Gabla. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) He cuts a fork <span
id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22.md) there with one blow of his sword, and put
it on the middle of the stream, so that a chariot could not pass it on
this side or that. Eirr and Indell, Foich and Fochlam (their two
charioteers) came upon him thereat. He strikes their four heads off, and
throws them on to the four points of the fork. Hence is Ath Gabla.

Then the horses of the four went to meet the host, and their cushions
very red on them. They supposed it was a battalion that was before them
at the ford. A troop went from them to look at the ford; they saw

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

nothing there but the track of one chariot and the fork with the four
heads, and a name in ogam written on the side. All the host came then.

'Are the heads yonder from our people?' said Medb.

'They are from our people and from our choice warriors,' said Ailill.

One of them read the ogam that was on the side of the fork; that is: 'A
man has thrown the fork with his one hand; and you shall not go past it
till one of you, except Fergus, has thrown it with one hand.'

'It is a marvel,' said Ailill, 'the quickness with which the four were
struck.'

'It was not that that was a marvel,' said Fergus; 'it was the striking
of the fork from the trunk with one blow; and if the end was \[cut\]
with one blow, <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) it is the fairer for
it, and that it was thrust in in this manner; for it is not a hole that
has been dug for it, but it is from the back of the chariot it has been
thrown with one hand.'

'Avert this strait from us, O Fergus,' said Medb.

'Bring me a chariot then,' said Fergus, 'that I may take it out, that
you may see whether its end was hewn with one blow.' Fergus broke then
fourteen chariots of his chariots, so that it was from his own chariot
that he took it out of the ground, and he saw that the end was hewn with
one blow.

'Heed must be taken to the character of the tribe to which we are
going,' said Ailill. 'Let each of you prepare his food; you had no rest
last night for the snow. And something shall be told to us of the
adventures and stories of the tribe to which we are going.'

It is then that the adventures of Cuchulainn were

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

related to them. Ailill asked: 'Is it Conchobar who has done this?'

'Not he,' said Fergus; 'he would not have come to the border of the
country without the number of a battalion round him.'

'Was it Celtchar Mac Uithidir?'

'Not he; he would not have come to the border of the country without the
number of a battalion round him.'

'Was it Eogan Mac Durtacht?'

'Not he,' said Fergus; 'he would not have come over the border the
country without thirty chariots two-pointed (?) round him. This is the
man who would have done the deed,' said Fergus, 'Cuchulainn; it is he
who would cut the tree at one blow from the trunk, and who would have
killed the four yonder as quickly as they were killed, and who would
have come to the boundary with his charioteer.'

'What kind of man,' said Ailill, 'is this Hound of whom we have heard
among the Ulstermen? What age is this youth who is famous?'

'An easy question, truly,' said Fergus. 'In his fifth year he went to
the boys at Emain Macha to play; in his sixth year he went to learn arms
and feats with Scathach. In his seventh year he took arms. He is now
seventeen years old at this time.'

'Is it he who is hardest to deal with among the Ulstermen?' said Medb.

'Over every one of them,' said Fergus. 'You will not find before you a
warrior who is harder to deal with, nor a point that is sharper or
keener or swifter, nor a hero who is fiercer, nor a raven that is more
flesh-loving, nor a match of his age that can equal

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

him as far as a third; nor a lion that is fiercer, nor a fence (?) of
battle, nor a hammer of destruction, nor a door of battle, nor judgment
on hosts, nor preventing of a great host that is more worthy. You will
not find there a man who would reach his age, and his growth, and his
dress, and his terror, his speech, his splendour, his fame, his voice,
his form, his power, his hardness, his accomplishment, his valour, his
striking, his rage, his anger, his victory, his doom-giving, his
violence, his estimation, his hero-triumph, his speed, his pride, his
madness, with the feat of nine men on every point, like Cuchulainn.'

'I don't care for that,' said Medb; 'he is in one body; he endures
wounding; he is not above capturing. Therewith his age is that of a
grown-up girl, and his manly deeds have not come yet.'

'Not so,' said Fergus. 'It would be no wonder if he were to do a good
deed to-day; for even when he was younger his deeds were manly.'
