### This is the Number of the Feats

He went on that errand then. Cuchulainn was practising feats at that
time, *i.e.* the apple-feat, the edge-feat, the supine-feat, the
javelin-feat, the rope-feat, the ——— feat, the cat-feat, the hero's
salmon \[-leap?\], the cast ———, the leap over ———, the noble champion's
turn, the *gae bolga*, the ——— of swiftness, the wheel-feat, the ———,
the feat on breath, the mouth-rage (?), the champion's shout, the stroke
with proper adjustment, the back-stroke, the climbing a javelin with
stretching of the body on its point, with the binding (?) of a noble
warrior.

Cur was plying his weapons against him in a fence (?) of his shield till
a third of the day; and not a stroke of the blow reached Cuchulainn for
the madness of the feats, and he did not know that a man was trying to
strike him, till Fiacha Mac Fir-Febe said to him: 'Beware of the man who
is attacking you.'

Cuchulainn looked at him; he threw the feat-apple that remained in his
hand, so that it went between the rim and the body of the shield, and
went back through the head of the churl. It would be in Imslige
Glendanach that Cur fell according to another version.

Fergus returned to the army. 'If your security hold you,' said he, 'wait
here till to-morrow.'

'It would not be there,' said Ailill; 'we shall go back to our camp.'

Then Lath Mac Dabro is asked to go against Cuchulainn, as Cur had been
asked. He himself fell then also. Fergus returns again to put his
security on them. They remained there until there were slain there Cur
Mac Dalath, and Lath Mac Dabro, and

three Swifts, and Srubgaile Mac Eobith. They were all slain there in
single combat.
