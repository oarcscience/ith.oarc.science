### The Death of Cur

Then Cur Mac Dalath is besought to go against Cuchulainn. He from whom
he shed blood, he is dead before the ninth day.

'If he slay him,' said Medb, 'it is victory; and though it be he who is
slain, it is removing a load from the host: for it is not easy to be
with him in regard to eating and sleeping.'

Then he goes forth. He did not think it good to go against a beardless
wild boy.

'Not so(?) indeed,' said he, 'right is the honour (?) that you give us!
If I had known that it was against this man that I was sent, I would not
have bestirred myself to seek him; it were enough in my opinion for a
boy of his own age from my troop to go against him.'

'Not so,' said Cormac Condlongas; 'it were a marvel for us if you
yourself were to drive him off.'

'Howbeit,' said he, 'since it is on myself that it is laid you shall go
forth to-morrow morning; it will not delay me to kill the young deer
yonder.'

He goes then early in the morning to meet him; and he tells the host to
get ready to take the road before them, for it was a clear road that he
would make by going against Cuchulainn.
