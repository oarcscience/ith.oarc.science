### The Conversation of the Morrigan with Cuchulainn

Cuchulainn saw a young woman coming towards him, with a dress of every
colour on, and her form very excellent.

Who are you?' said Cuchulainn.

'Daughter of Buan the king,' said she. 'I have come to you; I have loved
you for your reputation, and I have brought my treasures and my cattle
with me.'

'The time at which you have come to us is not good. For our condition is
evil, through hunger. It is not easy to me to meet a woman, while I am
in this strife.'

'I will be a help to you…. I shall be more troublesome to you,' said
she, 'when I come against you when you are in combat against the men. I
will come in the form of an eel about your feet in the ford, so that you
shall fall.'

'I think that likelier than the daughter of a king. I will take you,'
said he, 'between my toes, till your ribs are broken, and you will be in
this condition till a doom of blessing comes (?) on you.'

'I will drive the cattle on the ford to you, in the form of a grey
she-wolf.'

'I will throw a stone at you from my sling, so that

it shall break your eye in your head; and you will be in that state till
a doom of blessing comes on you.'

'I will come to you in the form of a hornless red heifer before the
cattle. They will rush on you on the plains (?), and on the fords, and
on the pools, and you will not see me before you.'

'I will throw a stone at you,' said he, 'so that your leg shall break
under you, and you will be in this state till a doom of blessing comes
on you.'

Therewith she goes from him.

So he was a week on Ath Grencha, and a man used to fall every day by him
in Ath Grencha, *i.e.* in Ath Darteisc.
