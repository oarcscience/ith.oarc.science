### <span class="smallcaps">The Vision of Dubthach</span>

'A wonder of a morning, <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) a wonder of
a time, when hosts will be confused, kings will be turned, necks will
break, the sun will grow red, three hosts will be routed by the track of
a host about Conchobar. They will strive for their women, they will
chase their flocks in fight on the morning, heroes will be smitten, dogs
will be checked (?), horses will be pressed (?), ——— ———, ——— will drip,
from the assemblies of great peoples.'

Therewith they awoke through their sleep (?). The Nemain threw the host
into confusion there; a hundred men of them died. There is silence there
then; when they heard Cormac Condlongas again (or it is Ailill Mac Matae
in the camp who sang this):

'The time of Ailill. Great his truce, the truce of Cuillend,' etc. <span
