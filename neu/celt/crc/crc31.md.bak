### This is the Combat of Fer Diad and Cuchulainn

Then they considered what man among them would be fit to ward off
Cuchulainn. The four provinces

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

of Ireland spoke, and confirmed, and discussed, whom it would be fitting
to send to the ford against Cuchulainn. All said that it was the
Horn-skin from Irrus Domnand, the weight that is not supported, the
battle-stone of doom, his own dear and ardent foster-brother. For
Cuchulainn had not a feat that he did not possess, except it were the
Gae Bolga alone; and they thought he could avoid it, and defend himself
against it, because of the horn about him, so that neither arms nor many
edges pierced it.

Medb sent messengers to bring Fer Diad. Fer Diad did not come with those
messengers. Medb sent poets and bards and satirists <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) to him, that they might satirise him and
mock him and put him to ridicule, that he might not find a place for his
head in the world, until he should come to the tent of Medb and Ailill
on the Foray. Fer Diad came with those messengers, for the fear of their
bringing shame on him.

Findabair, the daughter of Medb and Ailill, was put on one side of him:
it is Findabair who put her hand on every goblet and on every cup of Fer
Diad; it is she who gave him three kisses at every cup of them; it is
she who distributed apples right frequent over the bosom of his tunic.
This is what she said: that he, Fer Diad, was her darling and her chosen
wooer of the men of the world.

When Fer Diad was satisfied and happy and very joyful, Medb said:

'Alé! O Fer Diad, do you know why you have been summoned into this
tent?'

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

'I do not know indeed,' said Fer Diad; 'except that the nobles of the
men of Ireland are there. What is there less fitting for me to be there
than for any other good warrior?'

'It is not that indeed,' said Medb; 'but to give you a chariot worth
three sevens of cumals, <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) and the
equipment of twelve men, and the equal of Mag Murthemne from the arable
land of Mag Ai; and that you should be in Cruachan always, and wine to
be poured for you there; and freedom of your descendants and of your
race for ever without tribute or tax; my leaf-shaped brooch of gold to
be given to you, in which there are ten score ounces and ten score
half-ounces, and ten score *crosach* and ten score quarters; Findabair,
my daughter and Ailill's daughter, for your one wife, and you shall get
my love if you need it over and above.'

'He does not need it,' said every one: 'great are the rewards and
gifts.'

'That is true,' said Fer Diad, they are great; and though they are
great, O Medb, it is with you yourself they will be left, rather than
that I should go against my foster-brother to battle.'

'O men,' said she, said Medb (through the right way of division and
setting by the ears), 'true is the word that Cuchulainn spoke,' as if
she had not heard Fer Diad at all.

'What word is this, O Medb?' said Fer Diad.

'He said indeed,' said she, 'that he would not think it too much that
you should fall by him as the first fruits of his prowess in the
province to which he should come.'

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

'To say that was not fitting for him. For it is not weariness or
cowardice that he has ever known in me, day nor night. I swear,
etc., <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) that I will be the first man
who will come to-morrow morning to the ford of combat.'

'May victory and blessing come to you,' said Medb. 'And I think it
better that weariness or cowardice be found with you, because of
friendship beyond my own men (?). Why is it more fitting for him to seek
the good of Ulster because his mother was of them, than for you to seek
the good of the province of Connaught, because you are the son of a king
of Connaught?'

It is thus they were binding their covenants and their compact, and they
made a song there:

<span class="small">'Thou shalt have a reward,' etc.</span>

There was a wonderful warrior of Ulster who witnessed that bargaining,
and that was Fergus Mac Roich. Fergus came to his tent.

'Woe is me! the deed that is done to-morrow morning!' said Fergus.

'What deed is that?' said the folk in the tent.

'My good fosterling Cuchulainn to be slain.'

'Good lack! who makes that boast?'

'An easy question: his own dear ardent foster-brother, Fer Diad Mac
Damain. Why do ye not win my blessing?' said Fergus; 'and let one of you
go with a warning and with compassion to Cuchulainn, if perchance he
would leave the ford to-morrow morning.'

'On our conscience,' said they, 'though it were you

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

yourself who were on the ford of combat, we would not come as far as
\[the ford\] to seek you.'

'Good, my lad,' said Fergus; 'get our horses for us and yoke the
chariot.'

The lad arose and got the horses and yoked the chariot. They came forth
to the ford of combat where Cuchulainn was.

'One chariot coming hither towards us, O Cuchulainn!' said Loeg. For it
is thus the lad was, with his back towards his lord. He used to win
every other game of *brandub* <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) and of
chess-playing from his master: the sentinel and watchman on the four
quarters of Ireland over and above that.

'What kind of chariot then?' said Cuchulainn.

'A chariot like a huge royal fort, with its yokes strong golden, with
its great panel (?) of copper, with its shafts of bronze, with its body
thin-framed (?), dry-framed (?), feat-high, scythed, sword-fair (?), of
a champion, on two horses, swift, stout (?), well-yoked (?), ——— (?).
One royal warrior, wide-eyed, was the combatant of the chariot. A beard
curly, forked, on him, so that it reached over the soft lower part of
his soft shirt, so that it would shelter (?) fifty warriors to be under
the heavy of the warrior's beard, on a day of storm and rain. A round
shield, white, variegated, many-coloured on him, with three chains ———,
so that there would be room from front to back for four troops of ten
men behind the leather of the shield which is upon the of ——— the
warrior. A sword, long, hard-edged, red-broad in the sheath, woven and
twisted of white silver, over the skin of the bold-in-battle.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A spear, strong,
three-ridged, with a winding and with bands of white silver all white by
him across the chariot.'

'Not hard the recognition,' said Cuchulainn; 'my friend Fergus comes
there, with a warning and with compassion to me before all the four
provinces.'

Fergus reached them and sprang from his chariot and Cuchulainn greeted
him.

'Welcome your coming, O my friend, O Fergus,' said Cuchulainn.

'I believe your welcome,' said Fergus.

'You may believe it,' said Cuchulainn; 'if a flock of birds come to the
plain, you shall have a duck with half of another; if fish come to the
estuaries, you shall have a salmon with half of another; a sprig of
watercress, and a sprig of marshwort, and a sprig of seaweed, and a
drink of cold sandy water after it.'

'That portion is that of an outlaw,' said Fergus.

'That is true, it is an outlaw's portion that I have,' said Cuchulainn,
'for I have been from the Monday after Samain to this time, and I have
not gone for a night's entertainment, through strongly obstructing the
men of Ireland on the Cattle-Foray of Cualnge at this time.'

'If it were for this we came,' said Fergus, 'we should have thought it
the better to leave it; and it is not for this that we have come.'

'Why else have you come to me?' said Cuchulainn.

'To tell you the warrior who comes against you in battle and combat
to-morrow morning,' said he.

'Let us find it out and let us hear it from you then,' said Cuchulainn.

'Your own foster-brother, Fer Diad Mac Damain.'

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

'On our word, we think it not best that it should be he we come to
meet,' said Cuchulainn, 'and it is not for fear of him but for the
greatness of our love for him.'

'It is fitting to fear him;' said Fergus, 'for he has a skin of horn in
battle against a man, so that neither weapon nor edge will pierce it.'

'Do not say that at all,' said Cuchulainn, 'for I swear the oath that my
people swear, that every joint and every limb of him will be as pliant
as a pliant rush in the midst of a stream under the point of my sword,
if he shows himself once to me on the ford.'

It is thus they were speaking, and they made a song:

<span class="small">'O Cuchulainn, a bright meeting,' etc.</span>

After that, 'Why have you come, O my friend, O Fergus?' said Cuchulainn.

'That is my purpose,' said Fergus.

'Good luck and profit,' said Cuchulainn, 'that no other of the men of
Ireland has come for this purpose, unless the four provinces of Ireland
all met at one time. I think nothing of a warning before a single
warrior.'

Then Fergus went to his tent.

 

As regards the charioteer and Cuchulainn:

'What shall you do to-night?' said Loeg.

'What indeed?' said Cuchulainn.

'It is thus that Fer Diad will come to seek you, with new beauty of
plaiting and haircutting, and washing and bathing, and the four
provinces of Ireland with him to look at the fight. It would please me
if you went to the place where you will get the same adorning for
yourself, to the place where is Emer of

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

the Beautiful Hair, to Cairthend of Cluan Da Dam in Sliab Fuait.'

So Cuchulainn went thither that night, and spent the night with his own
wife. His adventures from this time are not discussed here now. As to
Fer Diad, he came to his tent; it was gloomy and weary that Fer Diad's
tent-servants were that night. They thought it certain that where the
two pillars of the battle of the world should meet, that both would
fall; or the issue of it would be, that it would be their own lord who
would fall there. For it was not easy to fight with Cuchulainn on the
Foray.

There were great cares on Fer Diad's mind that night, so that they did
not let him sleep. One of his great anxieties was that he should let
pass from him all the treasures that had been offered to him, and the
maiden, by reason of combat with one man. If he did not fight with that
one man, he must fight with the six warriors on the morrow. His care
that was greater than this was that if he should show himself once on
the ford to Cuchulainn, he was certain that he himself would not have
power of his head or life thereafter; and Fer Diad arose early on the
morrow.

'Good, my lad,' said he, 'get our horses for us, and harness the
chariot.'

'On our word,' said the servant, 'we think it not greater praise to go
this journey than not to go it.'

He was talking with his charioteer, and he made this little song,
inciting his charioteer:

<span class="small">'Let us go to this meeting,' etc.</span>

The servant got the horses and yoked the chariot, and they went forth
from the camp.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

'My lad,' said Fer Diad, 'it is not fitting that we make our journey
without farewell to the men of Ireland. Turn the horses and the chariot
for us towards the men of Ireland.'

The servant turned the horses and the chariot thrice towards the men of
Ireland.…

 

'Does Ailill sleep now?' said Medb.

'Not at all,' said Ailill.

'Do you hear your new son-in-law greeting you?'

'Is that what he is doing?' said Ailill.

'It is indeed,' said Medb, 'and I swear by what my people swear, the man
who makes the greeting yonder will not come back to you on the same
feet.'

'Nevertheless we have profited by (?) the good marriage connection with
him,' said Ailill; 'provided Cuchulainn fell by him, I should not care
though they both fell. But we should think it better for Fer Diad to
escape.'

 

Fer Diad came to the ford of combat.

'Look, my lad,' said Fer Diad; 'is Cuchulainn on the ford?'

'He is not, indeed,' said the servant.

'Look well for us,' said Fer Diad.

'Cuchulainn is not a little speck in hiding where he would be,' said the
lad.

'It is true, O boy, until to-day Cuchulainn has not heard of the coming
of a good warrior <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) against him on the
Cattle Foray of Cualnge, and when he has heard of it he has left the
ford.'

'A great pity to slander Cuchulainn in his absence!

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For do you
remember how when you gave battle to German Garbglas above the
edge-borders of the Tyrrhene Sea, you left your sword with the hosts,
and it was Cuchulainn who killed a hundred warriors in reaching it, and
he brought it to you; and do you remember where we were that night?'
said the lad.

'I do not know it,' said Fer Diad.

'At the house of Scathach's steward,' said the lad, and you went ——— and
haughtily before us into the house first. The churl gave you a blow with
the three-pointed flesh-hook in the small of your back, so that it threw
you out over the door like a shot. Cuchulainn came into the house and
gave the churl a blow with his sword, so that it made two pieces of him.
It was I who was steward for you while you were in that place. If only
for that day, you should not say that you are a better warrior than
Cuchulainn.'

'What you have done is wrong,' said Fer Diad, 'for I would not have come
to seek the combat if you had said it to me at first. Why do you not
pull the cushions <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) of the chariot
under my side and my skin-cover under my head, so that I might sleep
now?'

'Alas!' said the lad, 'it is the sleep of a fey man before deer and
hounds here.'

'What, O lad, are you not fit to keep watch and ward for me?'

'I am fit,' said the lad; 'unless men come in clouds or in mist to seek
you, they will not come at all from east or west to seek you without
warning and observation.'

The cushions <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) of his chariot were
pulled under his

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

side and the skin under his head. And yet he could not sleep a little.

 

As to Cuchulainn it is set forth:

'Good, O my friend, O Loeg, take the horses and yoke the chariot; if Fer
Diad is waiting for us, he is thinking it long.'

The boy rose and took the horses and yoked the chariot.

Cuchulainn stepped into his chariot and they came on to the ford. As to
Fer Diad's servant, he had not long to watch till he heard the creaking
of the chariot coming towards them. He took to waking his master, and
made a song:

<span class="small">'I hear a chariot,' etc.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (This is the
description of Cuchulainn's chariot: one of the three chief chariots of
the narration on the Cattle Foray of Cualnge.)

'How do you see Cuchulainn?' said he, said Fer Diad, to his charioteer.

'I see,' said he, 'the chariot broad above, fine, of white crystal, with
a yoke of gold with (?), with great panels of copper, with shafts of
bronze, with tyres of white metal, with its body thin-framed (?)
dry-framed (?), feat-high, sword-fair (?), of a champion, on which there
would be room for seven arms fit for a lord (?). A fair seat for its
lord; so that this chariot, Cuchulainn's chariot, would reach with the
speed of a swallow or of a wild deer, over the level land of Mag Slebe.
That is the speed and ——— which they attain, for it is towards us they
go. This chariot is at hand on two horses small-headed, small-round,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

small-end, pointed, ———, red-breasted, ———, easy to recognise,
well-yoked.… One of the two horses is supple (?), swift-leaping, great
of strength, great of foot, great of length, ———. The other horse is
curly-maned, slender-footed, narrow-footed, heeled, ———. Two wheels
dark, black. A pole of metal adorned with red enamel, of a fair colour.
Two bridles golden, inlaid. There is a man with fair curly hair, broad
cut (?), in the front of this chariot. There is round him a blue mantle,
red-purple. A spear with wings (?), and it red, furious, in his clenched
fist, red-flaming. The appearance of three heads of hair on him, *i.e.*
dark hair against the skin of his head, hair blood-red in the middle, a
crown of gold covers the third hair.

'A fair arrangement of the hair so that it makes three circles round
about his shoulders down behind. I think it like gold thread, after its
colour has been made over the edge of the anvil; or like the yellow of
bees on which the sun shines in a summer day, is the shining of each
single hair of his hair. Seven toes on each of his feet, and seven
fingers on each of his hands, and the shining of a very great fire round
his eye, ——— (?) and the hoofs of his horses; a hero's ——— in his hands.

'The charioteer of the chariot is worthy of him in his presence: curly
hair very black has he, broad-cut along his head. A cowl-dress is on him
open; two very fine golden leaf-shaped switches in his hand, and a light
grey mantle round him, and a goad of white silver in his hand, plying
the goad on the horses, whichever way the champion of great deeds goes
who was at hand in the chariot.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

'He is veteran of his land (?): he and his servant think little of
Ireland.'

'Go, O fellow,' said he, said Fer Diad; 'you praise too much altogether;
and prepare the arms in the ford against his coming.'

'If I turned my face backwards, it seems to me the chariot would come
through the back of my neck.'

'O fellow,' said he, 'too greatly do you praise Cuchulainn, for it is
not a reward for praising he has given you'; and it is thus he was
giving his description, and he said:

<span class="small">'The help is timely,' etc.</span>

It is not long afterwards that they met in the middle of the ford, and
Fer Diad said to Cuchulainn:

'Whence come you, O Cua?' said he (for <span
id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) *cua* was the name of squinting in old
Gaelic; and there were seven pupils in Cuchulainn's royal eye, and two
of these pupils were squinting, and the ugliness of it is no greater
than its beauty on him; and if there had been a greater blemish on
Cuchulainn, it is that with which he reproached him; and he was
proclaiming it); and he made a song, and Cuchulainn answered:

<span class="small">'Whence art thou come, O Hound,' etc.</span>

Then Cuchulainn said to his charioteer that he was to taunt him when he
was overcome, and that he was to praise him when he was victorious, in
the combat against Fer Diad. Then the charioteer said to him:

'The man goes over thee as the tail over a cat; he washes thee as foam
is washed in water, he squeezes (?) thee as a loving mother her son.'

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Then they took to the ford-play. Scathach's ——— (?) came to them both.
Fer Diad and Cuchulainn performed marvellous feats. Cuchulainn went and
leapt into Fer Diad's shield; Fer Diad hurled him from him thrice into
the ford; so that the charioteer taunted him again ——— and he swelled
like breath in a bag.

His size increased till he was greater than Fer Diad.

'Give heed to the *Gae bolga*,' said the charioteer; he sent it to him
along the stream.

Cuchulainn seized it between his toes, and wielded it on Fer Diad, into
his body's armour. It advances like one spear, so that it became
twenty-four points. Then Fer Diad turned the shield below. Cuchulainn
thrust at him with the spear over the shield, so that it broke the shaft
of his ribs and went through Fer Diad's heart.

\[*Fer Diad*:\] 'Strong is the ash from thy right hand! The ——— rib
breaks, my heart is blood. Well hast thou given battle! I fall, O
Hound.'

\[*Cuchulainn*:\] 'Alas, O golden brooch, O Fer Diad! ———, O fair strong
striker! Thy hand was victorious; our dear foster-brotherhood, O delight
of the eyes! Thy shield with the rim of gold, thy sword was dear. Thy
ring of white silver round thy noble arm. Thy chess-playing was worthy
of a great man. Thy cheek fair-purple; thy yellow curling hair was
great, it was a fair treasure. Thy soft folded girdle which used to be
about thy side. That thou shouldst fall at Cuchulainn's hands was sad, O
Calf! Thy shield did not suffice which used to be for service. Our
combat with thee is not fitting, our horses and our tumult. Fair was the
great hero! every host used to be defeated

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

and put under foot. Alas, O golden brooch, O Fer Diad!'
