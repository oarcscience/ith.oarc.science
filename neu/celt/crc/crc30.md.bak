### Continuation \[From the Yellow Book of Lecan\]

On the morrow Medb sent twenty-seven men to Cuchulainn's bog. Fuilcarnn
is the name of the bog, on this side of Fer Diad's Ford. They threw
their twenty-nine spears at him at once; *i.e.* Gaile-dana with his
twenty-seven sons and his sister's son, Glas Mac Delgna. When then they
all stretched out their hands to their swords, Fiacha Mac Fir-Febe came
after them out of the camp. He gave a leap from his chariot when he saw
all their hands against Cuchulainn, and he strikes off the arms of the
twenty-nine of them.

Then Cuchulainn said: 'What you have done I deem help at the nick of
time (?).'

'This little,' said Fiacha, 'is a breach of compact for us Ulstermen. If
any of them reaches the camp, we will go with our cantred under the
point of the sword.'

'I swear, etc., since I have emitted my breath,' said Cuchulainn, 'not a
man of them shall reach it alive.'

Cuchulainn slew then the twenty-nine men and the two sons of Ficce with
them, two bold warriors of Ulster who came to ply their might on the
host. This is that deed on the Foray, when they went to the battle with
Cuchulainn.
