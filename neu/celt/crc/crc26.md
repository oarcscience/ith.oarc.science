### The Death of Loch Mac Emonis

Then Loch Mac Emonis was asked like the others, and there was promised
to him a piece of the arable land of Mag Ai equal in size to Mag
Murthemne, and the equipment of twelve warriors and a chariot worth
seven cumals <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_68); and he did not think
combat with a youth worthy. He had a brother, Long Mac Emonis himself.
The same price was given to him, both maiden and raiment and chariots
and land. He goes to meet Cuchulainn. Cuchulainn slays him, and he was
brought dead before his brother, Loch.

This latter said that if he only knew that it was a bearded man who slew
him, he would kill him for it.

'Take a battle-force to him,' said Medb to her household, 'across the
ford from the west, that you may go across; and let fair-play be broken
on him.'

Then the seven Manes, warriors, go first, so that they saw him on the
edge of the ford westward. He

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

puts his feast-dress on that day. It is then that the women kept
climbing on the men to look at him.

'I am sorry,' said Medb; 'I cannot see the boy about whom they go
there.'

'Your mind will not be the gladder for it,' said Lethrend, Ailill's
squire, 'if you could see him.' He comes to the ford then as he was.

'What man is it yonder, O Fergus?' said Medb.

'A boy who wards off,' etc.… 'if it is Culann's Hound.' <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69)

Medb climbed on the men then to look at him.

It is then that the women said to Cuchulainn 'that he was laughed at in
the camp because he had no beard, and no good warriors would go against
him, only wild men; it were easier to make a false beard.' So this is
what he did, in order to seek combat with a man; *i.e.* with Loch.
Cuchulainn took a handful of grass, and said a spell over it, so that
every one thought he had a beard.

'True,' said the troop of women, 'Cuchulainn has a beard. It is fitting
for a warrior to fight with him.' They had done this on urging Loch.

'I will not make combat against him till the end of seven days from
to-day,' said Loch.

'It is not fitting for us to have no attack on the man for this space,'
said Medb. 'Let us put a hero to hunt(?) him every night, if perchance
we may get a chance at him.'

This is done then. A hero used to come every night to hunt him, and he
used to kill them all. These are the names of the men who fell there:
seven Conalls, seven Oenguses, seven Uarguses, seven Celtris, eight

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fiacs, ten
Ailills, ten Delbaths, ten Tasachs. These are his deeds of this week in
Ath Grencha.

 

Medb asked advice, to know what she should do to Cuchulainn, for what
had been killed of their hosts by him distressed her greatly. This is
the plan she arrived at, to put brave, high-spirited men to attack him
all at once when he should come to an appointed meeting to speak with
Medb. For she had an appointment the next day with Cuchulainn to make a
peace in fraud with him, to get hold of him. She sent messengers forth
to seek him that he should come to meet her; and it was thus he should
come, and he unarmed: 'for she would come only with her troop of women
to meet him.'

The messenger, Traigtren, went to the place where Cuchulainn was, and
tells him Medb's message. Cuchulainn promised that he would do so.

'In what manner does it please you to go to meet Medb to-morrow, O
Cuchulainn?' said Loeg.

'As Medb has asked me,' said Cuchulainn.

'Great are Medb's deeds,' said the charioteer; 'I fear a hand behind the
back with her.'

'How is it to be done then?' said he.

'Your sword at your waist,' said the charioteer, 'that you may not be
taken at an unfair advantage. For the warrior is not entitled to his
honour-price if he is without arms; and it is the coward's law that he
deserves in that way.'

'Let it be done so then,' said Cuchulainn.

The meeting-place was in Ard Aignech, which is called Fochaird to-day.
Now Medb came to the meeting-place and set in ambush fourteen men of her
own

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

special following, of those who were of most prowess, ready for him.
These are they: two Glassines, the two sons of Bucchridi; two Ardans,
the two sons of Licce; two Glasogmas, the two sons of Crund; Drucht and
Delt and Dathen; Tea and Tascra and Tualang; Taur and Giese.

Then Cuchulainn comes to meet her. The men rise to attack him. Fourteen
spears are thrown at him at once. Cuchulainn guards himself so that his
skin or his ———(?) is not touched. Then he turns on them and kills them,
the fourteen of them. So that they are the fourteen men of Focherd, and
they are the men of Cronech, for it is in Cronech at Focherd that they
were killed. Hence Cuchulainn said: 'Good is my feat of heroism,' <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70) etc.

So it is from this that the name Focherd stuck to the place; that is,
*focherd*, *i.e.* 'good is the feat of arms' that happened to Cuchulainn
there.

So Cuchulainn came, and overtook them taking camp, and there were slain
two Daigris and two Anlis and four Dungais of Imlech. Then Medb began to
urge Loch there.

'Great is the mockery of you,' said she, 'for the man who has killed
your brother to be destroying our host, and you do not go to battle with
him! For we deem it certain that the wild man, great and fierce, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71) the like of him yonder, will not be able
to withstand the rage and fury of a hero like you. For it is by one
foster-mother and instructress that an art was built up for you both.'

Then Loch came against Cuchulainn, to avenge

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

his brother on him, for it was shown to him that Cuchulainn had a beard.

'Come to the upper ford,' said Loch; 'it would not be in the polluted
ford that we shall meet, where Long fell.'

When he came then to seek the ford, the men drove the cattle across.

'It will be across your water <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_72) here
to-day,' said Gabran the poet. Hence is Ath Darteisc, and Tir Mor
Darteisc from that time on this place.

When the men met then on the ford, and when they began to fight and to
strike each other there, and when each of them began to strike the
other, the eel threw three folds round Cuchulainn's feet, till he lay on
his back athwart the ford. Loch attacked him with the sword, till the
ford was blood-red with his blood.

'Ill indeed,' said Fergus, 'is this deed before the enemy. Let each of
you taunt the man, O men,' said he to his following, 'that he may not
fall for nothing.'

Bricriu Poison-tongue Mac Carbatha rose and began inciting Cuchulainn.

'Your strength is gone,' said he, 'when it is a little salmon that
overthrows you when the Ulstermen are at hand \[coming\] to you out of
their sickness yonder. Grievous for you to undertake a hero's deed in
the presence of the men of Ireland and to ward off a formidable warrior
in arms thus!'

Therewith Cuchulainn arises and strikes the eel so that its ribs broke
in it, and the cattle were driven over the hosts eastwards by force, so
that they took the tents on their horns, with the thunder-feat that the
two heroes had made in the ford.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

The she-wolf attacked him, and drove the cattle on him westwards. He
throws a stone from his sling, so that her eye broke in her head. She
goes in the form of a hornless red heifer; she rushes before the cows
upon the pools and fords. It is then he said: I cannot see the fords for
water.' He throws a stone at the hornless red heifer, so that her leg
breaks under her. Then he sang a song:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'I am all alone before flocks;  
 I get them not, I let them not go;  
 I am alone at cold hours (?)  
 Before many peoples.

'Let some one say to Conchobar  
 Though he should come to me it were not too soon;  
 Magu's sons have carried off their kine  
 And divided them among them.

'There may be strife about one head  
 Only that one tree blazes not;  
 If there were two or three  
 Their brands would blaze. <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_73)

'The men have almost worn me out  
 By reason of the number of single combats;  
 I cannot work the slaughter (?) of glorious warriors  
 As I am all alone.  
              I am all alone. <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_73)

</div>

It is there then that Cuchulainn did to the Morrigan the three things
that he had promised her in the *Tain Bo Regamna*; <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_74) and he fights Loch in the ford with the
*gae-bolga*, which the charioteer threw him along the stream. He
attacked him with it, so that

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

it went into his body's armour, for Loch had a horn-skin in fighting
with a man.

'Give way to me,' said Loch. Cuchulainn gave way, so that it was on the
other side that Loch fell. Hence is Ath Traiged in Tir Mor. Cuchulainn
cut off his head then.

Then fair-play was broken with him that day when five men came against
him at one time; *i.e.* two Cruaids, two Calads, Derothor; Cuchulainn
killed them by himself. Hence is Coicsius Focherda, and Coicer Oengoirt;
or it is fifteen days that Cuchulainn was in Focherd, and hence is
Coicsius Focherda in the Foray.

Cuchulainn hurled at them from Delga, so that not a living thing, man or
beast, could put its head past him southwards between Delga and the sea.
