### The Death of Ferbaeth

'Go to the camp for us, O friend Loeg' \[said Cuchulainn\], 'and consult
Lugaid Mac Nois, descendant of Lomarc, to know who is coming against me
tomorrow. Let it be asked diligently, and give him my greeting.'

Then Loeg went.

'Welcome,' said Lugaid; 'it is unlucky for Cuchulainn, the trouble in
which he is, alone against the men of Ireland. It is a comrade of us
both, Ferbaeth (ill-luck to his arms!), who goes against him to-morrow.
Findabair is given to him for it, and the kingdom of his race.'

Loeg turns back to where Cuchulainn is.

'He is not very joyful over his answer, my friend Loeg,' said
Cuchulainn.

Loeg tells him all that. Ferbaeth had been summoned into the tent to
Ailill and Medb, and he is told to sit by Findabair, and that she should
be given to him, for he was her choice for fighting with Cuchulainn. He
was the man they thought worthy of them, for they had both learned the
same arts with Scathach. Then wine is given to him, till he was
intoxicated, and he is told, 'They thought that wine fine, and there had
only been brought the load of fifty wagons. And it was the maiden who
used to put hand to his portion therefrom.'

'I do not wish it,' said Ferbaeth; 'Cuchulainn is my foster-brother, and
a man of perpetual covenant with

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

me. Nevertheless I will go against him to-morrow and cut off his head.'

'It will be you who would do it,' said Medb.

Cuchulainn told Loeg to go to meet Lugaid, that he should come and speak
with him. Lugaid comes to him.

'So Ferbaeth is coming against me to-morrow,' said Cuchulainn.

'He indeed,' said Lugaid.

'An evil day!' said Cuchulainn; 'I shall not be alive therefrom. Two of
equal age we, two of equal deftness, two equal when we meet. O Lugaid,
greet him for me; tell him that it is not true valour to come against
me; tell him to come to meet me to-night, to speak with me.'

Lugaid tells him this. When Ferbaeth did not avoid it, he went that
night to renounce his friendship with Cuchulainn, and Fiacha Mac
Fir-Febe with him. Cuchulainn appealed to him by his foster-brotherhood,
and Scathach, the foster-mother of them both.

'I must,' said Ferbaeth. 'I have promised it.'

'Take back (?) your bond of friendship then,' said Cuchulainn.

Cuchulainn went from him in anger. A spear of holly was driven into
Cuchulainn's foot in the glen, and appeared up by his knee. He draws it
out.

'Go not, O Ferbaeth, till you have seen the find that I have found.'

'Throw it,' said Ferbaeth.

Cuchulainn threw the spear then after Ferbaeth so that it hit the hollow
of his poll, and came out at his mouth in front, so that he fell back
into the glen.

'That is a throw indeed,' said Ferbaeth. Hence is

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Focherd Murthemne.
(Or it is Fiacha who had said, 'Your throw is vigorous to-day, O
Cuchulainn; said he; so that Focherd Murthemne is from that.)

Ferbaeth died at once in the glen. Hence is Glenn Firbaith. Something
was heard: Fergus, who said:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'O Ferbaeth, foolish is thy expedition  
 In the place in which thy grave is.  
 Ruin reached thee …  
 In Croen Corand.

'The hill is named Fithi (?) for ever;  
 Croenech in Murthemne,  
 From to-day Focherd will be the name  
 Of the place in which thou didst fall, O Ferbaeth.  
 O Ferbaeth,' etc.

</div>

'Your comrade has fallen,' said Fergus. 'Say will you pay for this man
on the morrow?'

'I will pay indeed,' said Cuchulainn.

Cuchulainn sends Loeg again for news, to know how they are in the camp,
and whether Ferbaeth lived. Lugaid said: 'Ferbaeth is dead,' and
Cuchulainn comes in turn to talk with them.
