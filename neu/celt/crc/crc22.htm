<p>He went on that errand then. Cuchulainn was practising feats at that time, <i>i.e.</i> the apple-feat, the edge-feat, the supine-feat, the javelin-feat, the rope-feat, the &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; feat, the cat-feat, the hero's salmon [-leap?], the cast &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, the leap over &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, the noble champion's turn, the <i>gae bolga</i>, the &#8212;&#8212;&#8212; of swiftness, the wheel-feat, the &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;, the feat on breath, the mouth-rage (?), the champion's shout, the stroke with proper adjustment, the back-stroke, the climbing a javelin with stretching of the body on its point, with the binding (?) of a noble warrior.</p>  
<p>Cur was plying his weapons against him in a fence (?) of his shield till a third of the day; and not a stroke of the blow reached Cuchulainn for the madness of the feats, and he did not know that a man was trying to strike him, till Fiacha Mac Fir-Febe said to him: 'Beware of the man who is attacking you.'</p>  
<p>Cuchulainn looked at him; he threw the feat-apple that remained in his hand, so that it went between the rim and the body of the shield, and went back through the head of the churl. It would be in Imslige Glendanach that Cur fell according to another version.</p>  
<p>Fergus returned to the army. 'If your security hold you,' said he, 'wait here till to-morrow.'</p>  
<p>'It would not be there,' said Ailill; 'we shall go back to our camp.'</p>  
<p>Then Lath Mac Dabro is asked to go against Cuchulainn, as Cur had been asked. He himself fell then also. Fergus returns again to put his security on them. They remained there until there were slain there Cur Mac Dalath, and Lath Mac Dabro, and</p>
