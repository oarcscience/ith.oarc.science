<span class="small"><sub>\*</sub><sup>\*</sup><sub>\*</sub> Nearly out

treatment of the 'Virgin Birth' theme that exists, whilst the second,
covering partly the same ground as that traversed by Mr. Frazer in the
*Golden Bough*, is an even fuller treatment of the Separate Soul.</span>

</div>

<span class="small"><sub>\*</sub><sup>\*</sup><sub>\*</sub> Mr. Nutt's
essays form practically the first, and, up to now, the sole examination
of Celtic mythic literature on anthropological historical lines. They
endeavour to correlate Irish myth with that of Greece, India, and
Scandinavia, and to assign to it its proper place in the evolution of
general Aryan Mythology.</span>

Significance. By <span class="smallcaps">Jessie L. Weston</span>,

<span class="small"><sub>\*</sub><sup>\*</sup><sub>\*</sub> Vol. It. is
entirely filled with the translations of the Magic Songs, of which the
Finns possess a greater and more archaic mass than any other race save
their remote kinsmen, the Accadian-speaking dwellers in
Babylonia.</span>

Lays,' by <span class="smallcaps">Sophus Bugge</span>, Professor in the

earlier Irish versions.</span>

Son. A Study of its Genesis, Use in Literature and Popular Tradition. By
<span class="smallcaps">Murray A. Potter</span>, A.M. *Pp*. xii+224.
6*s*.

<span class="small"><sub>\*</sub><sup>\*</sup><sub>\*</sub> Mr. Potter
has here made an anthropological as well as a literary study of this
theme, and has endeavoured to explain it by reference to customs widely
spread, and still persisting among savage races.</span>

XV\. THE THREE DAYS’ TOURNAMENT. A Study in Romance and Folklore. Being
an Appendix to the Legend of Sir Lancelot. By <span
class="smallcaps">Jessie L. Weston</span>. *Pp*. xvi+59. 2*s*.

important and valuable contribution to the study of what is perhaps the
most perplexing of all bodies of romance—the Arthurian Cycle.</span>
