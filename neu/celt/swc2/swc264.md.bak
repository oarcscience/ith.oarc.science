This place gave name to the family of Pendrea, or Pender. Hals says,
"John Pendrea, the last of his tribe, temps. Henry VI, having only two
daughters, that became his heirs, who were married to Bonython, of
Carclew, and Noy. To Noy's share fell this tenement of Pendrea, which
was the dwelling of him and his posterity for several descents; and here
was born, as I was informed, William Noy, the Attorney General to
Charles I, who designed to have built a noteable house here, but was
prevented by death, having before brought great quantities of materials
to this place in order thereto. His grandson, William Noy, Esq., sold
this place, and several others, to my very kind friend Christopher
Davies, gent., now in possession thereof.

Baranhual, at one time the residence of the Penders, came from them to
the Noyes, and was sold by the Noyes to the Davises. Here was to be
seen, until recently, a small room encrusted with shells, which was said
to be the work of some ladies of the Davies family. The design of the
work was Charles II shown flying from his enemies, and one of them, in
full pursuit, had the legend, "This is the heir, come let us kill him,
that . the inheritance may be our own," whilst an angel calls from a
cloud, "Is it not written thou shalt do no murder?" The materials of
this work are principally shells from Parcurnow. In 1750 Davies sold
Baranhual, and some other farms, to Admiral Boscawen, in whose family it
still remains.

Pendrea, and much other property in Buryan, belong to the Rev. John
Tonkin, of Trevedern.
