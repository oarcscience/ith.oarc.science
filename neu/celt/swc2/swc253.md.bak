ON passing over a stile and entering the moor in which the well is
situated, cross the moor at a right-angle to the hedger and a minute's
walk will bring one to the noted spring, which is not seen until very
near, as it has no wall above the surface, nor any mark by which it can
be distinguished at a distance.

Much has been written of the remarkable cures effected by its holy
waters, and the intercession of St. Madron, or Motran; when it was so
famous that the maimed, halt, and lame, made pilgrimages from distant
parts to the heathy moor.

It is still resorted to on the first three Wednesdays in May, by some
few women of the neighbourhood, who bring children to be cured of skin
diseases by being bathed in it. Its old repute as a divining fount has
not yet quite died out, though young folks visit it now to drop pebbles
or pins into the well, more for fun and the pleasure of each other's
company, than through any belief that the falling together, or the
separation of pins or pebbles, will tell how the course of love will run
between the parties indicated by the objects dropped into the spring; or
that the number of bubbles which rise in the water, on stamping near the
well, mark the years, in answer to any question of time; but there was
not such want of faith, however, half a century ago.

A short time since I visited an elderly dame of Madron, who was a highly
reputed charmer for the cure of various skin ailments; I had known her
from my childhood; and my object was to glean what I could about the
rites practised, within her remembrance, at Madron Well, the
Crick-stone, and elsewhere.

She gave the following account of the usages at Madron Well about fifty
years ago. At that time, when she lived in Lanyon, scores of women from
Morvah, Zennor, Towednack, and other places, brought their children to
be cured of the shingles, wildfires, tetters, and other diseases, as
well as to fortify them against witchcraft or being blighted with an
evil eye.

An old dame called An’ Katty, who mostly lived in the Bossullows, or
some place near, and who did little but knitting-work, picked up a good
living in May by attending at the well, to direct the high country folks
how they were to proceed in using waters.

First she had the child stripped as naked as it was born; then it was
plunged three times against the sun; next the creature was passed
quickly nine times around the spring, going from east to west, or with
the sun; the child was then dressed, rolled up in something warm, and
laid to sleep near the water; if it slept, and plenty of bubbles rose in
the well, it was a good sign. I asked if a prayer, charm or anything was
spoken during the operations? "Why, no, to be sure," my old friend
replied, "don't ’e know any better, there musn’t be a word spoken all
the time they are near the water, it would spoil the spell; and a piece
rented, not cut, from the child's clothes, or from that of anybody using
the well must be left near it for good luck; ever so small a bit will
do. This was mostly placed out of sight between the stones bordering the
brooklet, or hung on a thorn that grew on the chapel wall.

Whilst one party went through their rites at the spring, all the others
remained over the stile in the higher enclosure, or by the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

hedge, because, if a word were spoken by anybody near the well during
the dipping, they had to come again." The old woman, An’ Katty, was
never paid in money, but balls of yarn, and other things she might want,
were dropped on the road, outside the well-moors, for her; she also got
good pickings by instructing young girls how to "try for sweethearts" at
the well. "Scores of maidens"—the dame's words—"used, in the summer
evenings, to come down to the well from ever so far, to drop into it
pins, gravels, or any small thing that would sink." The names of persons
were not always spoken when the objects which represented them were
dropped into the water; it sufficed to think of them; and as pins or
pebbles remained together or separated, such would be the couple's fate.
It was only when the spring was working (rising strongly) that it was of
any use to try the spells; and it was unlucky to speak when near the
well at such times.

The old woman that I visited said she had never heard that any saint had
anything to do with the water, except from a person who told her there
was something about it in a book; nor had she or anybody else heard the
water called St. Madron's Well, except by the new gentry, who go about
new naming places, and think they know more about them than the people
who have lived there ever since the world was created. She never heard
of any ceremony being performed at the old Chapel, except that some
persons hung a bit of their clothing on a thorn tree that grew near it.
High Country folks, who mostly resort to the spring, pay no regard to
any saint or to anyone else, except some old women who may come down
with them to show how everything used to be done.

There is a spring, not far from Bosporthenes, in Zennor, which was said
to be as good as Madron Well; and children were often taken thither and
treated in the same way.

Such is the substance of what the dame related; and she regarded the due
observance of ancient customs as a very solemn matter.

In answer to the questions of "What was the reason for going round the
well nine times? Leaving bits of clothing? Following the sun, &c.?" It
was always the same reply, "Such were the old customs, and everybody
knew it was unlucky to do any such work, and many things besides,
against the sun's course; no woman, who knew anything, would place pans
of milk in a dairy, so as to have to unream (skim) them, in turn,
against the sun, nor stir, cream in that direction to make butter.

By following down the well-stream or hedge, mentioned above, we come to
the Chapel. In its southern wall may be noticed an opening for letting
water from the brook, which runs near it,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

flow into a baptistry in the south-western corner of the Chapel.
Entering the door-way, on the northern side, one may remark that this
primitive fount appears to have been arched over after the manner of our
old bee-hive huts, by the upper rows of stones slightly overhanging. The
altar table-slab; or mensa—still remaining at the east end—has a square
pit worked in its centre, probably to mark the spot—over reliques—on
which the monstrance was placed. A step makes the division between the
little nave and sacrarium; there are also the remains of stone seats
which were carried all around against the walls.

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

             Let no rude hand remove,  
Or spoil thee; for the spot is consecrate  
To thee, and thou to it.
