### <span class="smallcaps">Parchapel Well</span>.

To find the Saint's Well one should take a pathway bearing westward,
from a little below the church, and which leads over Roskestal cliff to
Pargwarra (we spell all names as the inhabitants pronounce them). After
crossing the brook and mounting a hedge keep straight towards the sea,
and on a pretty level spot the ruined walls of St. Levan's baptistry
will be found, as also some traces of rude steps on a pathway that
connected this holy fount with an ancient chapel and burying-ground
which stood on ground so near the precipice that little, if any, of its
site now remains. We have heard old folks of St. Levan (who were born
there more than a century ago) say that in their younger days Parchapel
Well, as they always called it, was, twice a year, regularly cleaned out
and repaired, and the ground, for a good space around, as well as the
steps, cleared of weeds, swept, and sanded. The first week of May being
a time of general well-dressing, Parchapel Well was never neglected
then, and it was also cleaned up against the feasten tide, when many
christenings usually took place.

Old folks also spoke of another time-honoured observance in which the
Saint's Well was shown due respect. Until within half a century or so,
it was a custom on Christmas-eve for carol singers belonging to the
higher side hamlets to assemble in Sowah town-place round a large flat
table-like rock called the Garrack Zans (holy rock). Here they would
commence singing, and proceed to Roskestal, where at another Garrack
Zans in that town-place they would be joined by others, and all would
thence go singing down to Parchapel Well, where they would meet with
many singers from Treen and other lower-side places. At the Well many an
old carol would be chanted. One was never forgotten, in which, according
to our West Country version, Holy Mary says to her dear child:—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"Go thee wayst out, child Jesus;  
 Go thee wayst out to play  
 Down by God's holy well.  
 I see three pretty chelderen  
 As ever tongue can tell."

</div>

This, for its sweet simplicity, is still a favourite in the west.

The rude steps, which may yet be traced (though almost overgrown by
rushes and other water-plants) will be regarded with interest, as we
learn from St. Levan traditions that great sinners did penance by
crawling over these rough stones on their bare knees, and that the
devout who desired or aspired to acquire extraordinary grace, or
indulgence, scrambled up all the way on bare knees from chapel-door to
holy fount.
