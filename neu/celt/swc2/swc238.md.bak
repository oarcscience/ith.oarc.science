### <span class="smallcaps">Tom and the Knackers</span>.

"Do let's have the droll, Uncle Bill," said I, and he related as
follows,—

From the time Tom was old enow to handle a pick and showl he had lived
in Trecroben, and worked in Wheal Reath, till twenty years or so ago,
when work fell slack here, and some bals were knacked (stopped). Then he
went to Santust (St. Just) to look for a job and found work in Ballowal.
Most people have heard of that queer old bal, that was worked before The
Flood, they . There the old men's works, weth their deep open coffans
its may still be seen, jest as they left them only wash’d and run’d in a
good deal one may suppose. That old bal, everybody in Santust will tell
’e, have always been haunted with knackers. And the burrows, in crofts
and clever around, are swarman with them, and weth spriggans, wherever
anything belongan to the old bal was burred. There these sprites keep
everlastan watch, though all the old men's tools or treasures may be
gone to rust, earth, and dust. One don't often see them, ’tis true, but
only break ground near them and they'll show their ugly faces, as many
have known to their cost.

Tom and his eldest boy went over and worked a few weeks, to see how they
liked the place and people before removing his wife and family. They
liked the Santusters fust rate. They're a capital set of red-tailed
drones—only give them their own way; but you will soon find out that one
must either fight or be thorough friends with them 'one and all.' Tom
took a house in Letcha—handy by the bal. When his family were moved, he
and the boy worked together on tribute, and worked hard makan double
cores. When it came near pay-day, the boy, for want of rest, gave out,
and his father worked on alone.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

Tom had heard the knackers workan, away at a distance, all the time he
had been there, and took no notice of their noise, but now that the boy
stopped home, they came nearer and nearer every day, till he cud hardly
hear the sound of his own tools with the din and clatter of theirs. As
far as he could judge by the sound they were only two or three yards
off, in the level close behind him, carryen on all sorts of underground
work. Some appear’d to be wheelan, some showlan, others boran; he could
even hear them swab out their holes, put in the tampan, and shut (blast)
like a pare (company) of regular tinners. Shuttan wasn't in vogue in
their time, but they've learnt et.

One night—I think et was only two or three before serveyday—Tom got
quite savage to hear their confoundan clatter, with their squeakan and
tee-hee-an in a mockan way, if he made false strokes, or a clumsy blow;
and, being a devil-may-care sort of fellow, he, without thinkan of
anything, throwed back a handful of small stones, towards the spot where
they seemed to be workan, and called out at the same time without stopan
or lookan up, 'Go to blazes, you cussed old Jews’ sperrats; or I'll scat
(knock) your brains out, I will, of you arn’t gone from here.' The words
were no sooner out of his mouth than a shower of stones fell upon and
around him, and frightened him most out of his senses. Still, Tom
resolved to work on till mornan, and, in about an hour, when his candle
was burnt down and he stopped to light another, he sat down to eat the
rest of his fuggan and touch pipe a few minutes. Tom had all but
finished his supper, and bean hungry, could have eat more, when he heard
ever so many squeakan voices sing out, from away some fathoms back in
the level,—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"Tom Trevorrow! Tom Trevorrow!  
 Leave some of thy fuggan for Bucca,  
 Or bad luck to thee, to-morrow!"

</div>

Fust of all he cudn’t well make out any words, but his own name. He
thought of the old sayan, 'What the fool thinketh, that the bell
clinketh.' He knew that sounds heard underground often seemed to be
words, like Buryan bells of a weddan day ringan, 'Poor man, undone!' or
'Go thee ways’t home with ragget-tail Jone!' Then he tried again if they
wern’t as much like some old rhymes that children sing, such as,—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"Billy Pengelley,  
 Got pain in his belly,  
 Eatan green slones for supper!"

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But no, the devil
a bit; for the more and closer he listened the

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

plainer he heard the knackers, or some other sprites among them singing
the same. Only when he had eaten all there was a slight change and they
swag,—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"Tommy Trevorrow, Tommy Trevorrow!  
 We'll send thee bad luck to-morrow,  
 Thou old curmudgeon, to eat all thy fuggan,  
 And not leave a didjan for Bucca!"

</div>

And so they kept on singan, squeakan, and tee-hee-an, in going back in
the end till they were out of hearan. Tom was somewhat scared; yet he
felt so tired and drowsey that he could sleep in a pullan (shallow
pool). The poor fellow had worked hard and been at it nearly all day and
all night for the last week. When he had smoked out his pipe he leant
back, thinking to take a doze for only a few minutes. But when he waked
up all was quiet. He rubbed his eyes, and, lookan away in an end, where
it was nearly dark, he seed scores of knackers restan on their tools.
They were miserable, little, old, withered, dried-up creatures—the
tallest of them no more than three foot six, or there away, with shanks
like drum-sticks, and their arms as long or longer than their legs. They
had big ugly heads, with grey or red locks, squintan eyes, hook noses,
and mouths from ear to ear. The faces of many were very much like the
grim visages on old cloman jugs, so Tom said, and more like those of
brutes than Christians. One older and uglier than the rest—if
possible—seemed to take the lead in makan wry faces, and all sorts of
mockan tricks. When he put his thumb to his nose and squinted at Tom,
all those behind him did the same. Then all turned their backs, stooped
down, lolled out their tongues, and grinned at him from between their
spindle shanks. Tom was now much scared. He noticed that his candle was
burnt down to the clay, and knew that he must have slept nearly two
hours.

"Good Lord, deliver me," said he, risan to light another candle; and all
the knackers vanished by the time he was well on his legs. They seemed
to melt away, one into another, changan shapes like curlan smoke. Tom,
feelan hisself very stiff, tired, and cold, from havan slept so long,
dressed and mounted the ladders. He was hardly able to crawl to grass.
In the blacksmith's shop, where he had stopped a few minutes to change
and warm hisself, he told other men who were there, putten on their
underground clothes, what he had seen and heard. The old tinners told am
that they warn’t at all surprised, because the levels he worked in were
more infested with knackers than any other part of the bal. 'Many a
night,' said they, 'these troublesome sperats have ben sen whiskan round
the blacksmith's

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

shop and gwean (going) down the Buckshaft, near by, and that do enter
the level thee’st work in. This shaft es so called, because a black
buck-goat, or a bucca in shape of an, was seen to go down there, but
never found below.'

The tinners, one and all, blamed Tom for havan anything to do or say
with the knackers in an unfriendly way, and told him that as et was an
old custom he might as well have left a bit of bread on the ground for
good luck.

When Tom got home he went to bed at once, that he might have a good
rest. His wife fed and nussed him well, with the best she cud get for am
to eat or drink, in high hopes that, before many days were passed, they
would take up more an twenty pound for tin.

Tom dedn’t say a word about the knackers to his wife nor boy, for fear
to scare them, nor dedn't think much more of the buccas.

Next mornan Tom got up like a new one, fresh as a rose. After a hearty
breakfast, he and his son started for bal. Now it happened to be Corpus
Chris, and the boy was loath to go—he wanted to be off to Penzance, with
other youngsters, to see the fun of the fair. "Come thee way'st along,
my son," said Tom, "I know thee art still tired, but cheer up a bit;
Midsummer's day will soon be here; then thee shust (shalt) have a
shellan and, ef we get a good sturt (start), two or three, to go to the
games, and, dash my buttons; ef I too don't go down to Priest Cove, and
try a hitch at the wrestlan! I could used to show as good play, and
throw as fair a fall, as any man of my size." And so Tom ded—he would
often show me and others how to give the hugg, play with the back crook,
and so furth.

I don't see for my part why wrestlan, hurlan, and other old manlike
games should be allowed to die out for a set of sports more suitable for
women than men, and I hold that wrestlan es as good as boxen, and every
man should know how to defend hisself. One don't know what may turn up.
’Tes all stuff and nonsense what old women say about the wickedness of
such sports. I'd rather see a boy of mine with black eyes and bloody
nose every day, than for am to run from one of his size.

Arrivan at the bal, first thing on entering the level, Tom noticed that
some of the temberan was bulged a great deal and ready to give way. They
put in new planks, and, as Tom thought, made that all secure for the
time. Whilst they were at it he again heard the knackers workan away in
the end, but dedn't mind them. Then to get up some tin-stuff from below,
they went to work in the adit level, on the Buck lode, to secure around
and repair a winze (a small shaft with windlass) that was nearly all
run’d in. Whilst he put in new tembar, the boy

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

was kept at the winze-brace (windlass and tackle). When drivan the lafts
or boards, Tom plainly heard the knackers work an against him; he had to
put in new tembar in the manner of spillan. The ground seemed somewhat
dangerous. The longer he was workan the nearer the knackers were coman
towards him, until he saw the ground move before the lafts where the
sperats worked; he then called to the boy, 'Pull me up, quick, wind away
for dear life, my son!' By the time he was got up to the winze-braces,
the ground began to tumble in. He had the rope tied around his body.
Runnan back in the adit-level, he unwound it from the winze tree, and
untied it from his waist.

Yet he came very near bean killed, for he hadn't got clear of the rope
five seconds before wine, rope, and all, went down with the run. Tom,
poor fellow, looked around dismayed, to find that all his tin-stuff,
which was put on the winze plat, with tools and all, had gone down with
the rest; so he lost his tin there and below. All his labour and time
was gone for nothan.

He had to live many weeks on subsist (money advanced) and went to
another lode to work in an end to tut-work (piece-work), and there, too,
he was most put mad with the knackers—they wed come into the level close
behind, and go on with all kinds of work, and nobody could have wes
(worst) luck than followed am. He went to look so wisht and felt so bad
that he had to leave Ballowal; for, go wherever he might about that old
bal, the knackers were for ever tormenting am, till they fairly drove ’n
away, and he came back to Lelant no better off than when he left.

And here he had still bad luck doggan am for years. He had to work to
the farmers for a long spell, and, as we all know, every tinner would
just as soon go to the workhouse, or union; and for my part I'd rather
be tied to a bull's tail, and suffer the rest, than do either one."

Having refilled his pipe, my old neighbour continued:—

"As many bals were then stopped, and a number of hands discharged from
others, all the time going from bad to worse, Tom had to live, as he
cud, by farm-work for three or four years. He got all out of heart, to
be all the time dung-dabban, and to see his children as ragged as colts;
besides he had bad speed many ways; some said he was bewitched, and
advised him to see the pellar, who came round once a fortnight. Tom
thought that no use, because the conjuror won't 'good ’e,' as he do call
it, unless he's well paid. Tom's wife made a good bit of money by
spinnan and knittan. Unknown to her husband, she took her knittanwork,
and went over to the high road, one day, when the pellar, in going his
rounds, visited St. Ives. She hadn't ben long in the lane before he came
by.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

"I'm waitan to speak wh’y," said she; "but I'm afeard et wan't be any
use, because we’r very poor."

"I know," replied he, "that you have had a long run of bad luck, and it
will be all the harder now to turn it, but don't be out of hopes; I'll
see Tom and do what I can for ’e. I see you're a good knitster; so you
can make me a few pairs of warm stockans for winter's wear."

The conjuror remained alone with Tom a good while, each time he came
round. What he did to 'good ’e' esn’t known, because whatever's done to
hinder a run of bad luck, or to break a spell of ill wishan, must be
kept secret or no cure can be effected. In two or three months, however,
Tom's fortune had a turn. Several youngsters left for America and made
room for other hands. Then Tom, to his great content, went to minan-work
again. In a short time, instead of looking as wisht, ragged, and dirty
as 'Billy-be-damned,' or 'Old Jy,' who lived in a hole in a hedge, he
and his family once more got decent meat and clothan. The pellar had the
credit of doing them good, whether he deserved it or no; at any rate his
promises put them in better heart, and that was some help. Tom's wife
was overjoyed when he went to minan again; because she always took
delight when her good man came home from bal to hear him tell her and
the boys what he had done that core, and about his prospect of havan
lots of tin agen next pay-day. The lads were most interested when Tom
worked to tut-work; drivan an end, as you'll see.

An old boryer, hammer, gads, and . other tools were kept under the
chimney-stool, that Tom might show them the plainer what he'd ben doan.
Now you must understand that Tom believed hisself to be as good a miner
as was to be found in Cornwall. He would often brag that he cud break
more ground at the same cost than any other man in the bal. His mind was
always so occupied about his underground work that the form of his end
was always before him. And most every night, after supper and whilst
smokan his pipe, he wed work his core over again with Betty, and she, to
humour him, would begin with, "Well, Tom, my son; and what hast a ben
doan to-day?"

"What use for me to tell ’e; I can never make thee understand anything,"
he'd say; "but look here boys!" At the sane time he wud take the
fire-hook, stick, or anything, and, quite pleased, draw out the form of
his end in the back of their old-fashioned, open chimney, and all would
be told to look on, say nothan, and learn. When he had marked out, to
his mind, how his end stood, he would say to his wife,

"Now thee cust see the end es about square as a was this mornan, take
the boryer and show me where thee west go for a hole."

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

"Well, I shud put down a hole there," she wed say, pointan with the
boryer in the most seemly place to her.

"Now gos’t away, thou great Paddy! I tell thee, Betty, thee dosen’t knaw
any more about such work than a Buryan man! Thee west never larn
anything! Give me the tools," he'd say, and show them all, with pride
sure nuf, how he'd stand and strike the boryer in the different
positions ground es subject to, and so he wed keep on for hours.

One day above all, whan they lived in Santust, Tom came home highly
pleased, and told his people he had done a wonderful core. After supper
he lighted his pipe, as usual, took up the fire-hook, and drawed the
form of his end as he found it in the mornan.

"Now, I bored a hole there," said he, pointan with his hook, "and gauv
en plenty of powder, and a ripped am forth and back like a boat-cove,
and tore great rocks out of am as big as housen."

"Lor, Tom, hold thy tongue cheeld; I can hardly believe thee," said
Betty.

"Well, a es truth what I do tell thee. Then—now look at this, Betty—I
went there, for another hole," said he pointan, "and it tord’n like mad,
and left am as square as a chest, all but a piece in the bottom. Then I
went down there for a side-hole, and that end now es as square as a
door, I tell thee. And now, Betty, the end es squared, where west thee
go for the next hole? Here, take the tools to thee; es thy turn to show
one a bit now; a es hard ground, mind, none of your farmers’ men can
break that."

"Well, I shud put down a hole there," said she, placan the hook in the
most [likely](errata.htm#21.md) place. Then Tom, with a look and voice of
great contempt wed say, "I told thee there was no wale (seam) there;
thee may’st shut (blast) away a ton of powder in that hole and then a
wedn’t heav’n, a wed make a rouse (report) hard snow to frighten away
all the chalks (choughs) in Carn Glase, and then a wedn’t heav’n. I tell
thee again, all of the powder that went down in the Royal George wed be
no good in that hole. Thee must lev’n look down more—just so, or else a
wed only be a stand to waste powder in."

And so the simple contented household wed pass night after night till
bed-time.

But one evenan they nearly came to grief by Tom shuttan his holes over
again. He came home late in a terrible splutter, sayan he had. done a
very bad core—he had shut a hole three times, and a blowed away in a vug
(crevice) each time.

"Et was a hole near the bottom, Jan," said he, takan the hook as usual
and havan drawn the position to his own satisfaction.

"But I shud think," said the boy, "that a was a hawful bad place to come
to strike et, faather."

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

"Thou great noddy! Doesna know that ar good man can bore a hole
anywhere? Hold the hook there," said he, puttan it into his hands, "and
I'll show thee how to strike ’n."

Tom turned round, snatched up the hammer in a great hurry, threw it back
in order to make a stroke, knocked down Betty, missed the hook, and
nearly broke Jan's arm.

Betty, though on the floor, screamed to see the boy's white face, and
when she saw the blood running from his arm and felt it on her own face
she fainted. And Tom, seeing them both on the floor, paced up and down
calling out, when he tried to rise them, "Oh my dear Betty and Jan; I'd
rather shut the hole twenty times over again than kill thee and the boy;
rise up do ’e, my dears."

They soon got round. The fright was worse than their hurt.

The way in which Tom and his wife amused themselves is not singular
among tinners, who, as a rule, take great pride in their work, and pass
hours showing their family or comrades how they worked the last cores,
and what they purpose to do next."

"Well, did Tom's good luck continue?" I asked.

"Pretty steadfast; he and his sons had neighbours’ fare," the old tinner
replied. "When his elder boys became men they had pretty good sturts
(start from a paying tribute), saved money, and went to America, and
they did so well over at Mineral Point, Galena, or somewhere that way,
that they sent home enough to keep the old couple in comfort, and to
bring the younger boys out to them, where they, with hundreds more from
here about, are making another Cornwall for "one and all."
