### <span class="smallcaps">Brea and Pendeen, in St. Just</span>. Pages [42](swc209.htm#page_42), [166](swc233.htm#page_166), and [200](swc240.htm#page_200).

"Brea, at present, retains no traces of its former consequence, which
may be assumed from its chapel, noticed in a former page.

The family of Bray, or Brea, came with the Conqueror. In the 3rd Henry
IV., A.D. 1402, Michael de Bray held two parts of one Knight's fee, in
Bray, in Penwith, and in the 12th Edw.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I., Brea, or Bray,
is charged by the Justices’ Itinerant for eight acres. Edward Bray was
summoned to Parliament, 3rd November, 1529, by the style and title of
Baron Bray, which honour expired on the death of John, the second Lord,
18th November, 1557. This property now belongs to the Ellis family. It
appears from an inscribed stone, over one of the chimneys, that the
present house was built by Charles Ellis, 1634. A former member of that
family, who lived there, was a Quaker, and is said to have been an
eccentric character. He enclosed a burying ground not far from his
house, and was there interred, and has a granite tomb erected over his
remains.

Pendeen is the house of most importance in this parish, it has long been
the property, and sometimes the residence, of different branches of the
old and highly respectable family of Borlase. The Rev. Dr. William
Borlase, the celebrated antiquary and historian of his own county, who,
by his elaborate work, has raised to his own memory an enduring
monument, was born here.

The mansion itself, though now only used as a farm house, and occupied
by labourers, retains much of its ancient respectability of appearance.
The masonry is of good wrought granite, and the chimneys are tastefully
built; it bears the date of 1670, and is a structure superior to the
other houses of the same age in the neighbourhood."

The learned antiquary, who was born and who resided at Pendeen for a
considerable time, is well represented by William Copeland Borlase,
Esq., the author of "Nænia Cornubiæ," recently published.
