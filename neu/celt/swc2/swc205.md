### <span class="smallcaps">Boleigh or Boleit</span>.

Although we never heard of any Household Stories connected with this
interesting spot, yet we cannot pass it without some notice of its
prehistoric remains.

Our antiquaries follow the fashion of spelling the name of the hamlet on
the hill as above yet everyone here who ought best to know the name of
the place in which they live, call it Bolé. Most likely it has been thus
pronounced from long before it was ever written. All sorts of
contradictory meanings have been given for the name of this noted place
as the dairy-house place of slaughter, &c. It was once the residence of
an old Norman family, whose name, spelt Bolleit, may be seen on a long
coffin-shaped slab, which lay on the floor within the tower of Buryan
Church a short time ago. The inscription in old Norman-French which
borders the edge of this curious tomb says that

† CLARICE: LA: FEMME: CHEFFRIE: DE: BOLLEIT: GIT: ICI: DEV: DE: LALME:
EIT: MERCE: KE: PVR: LEALME: PVNT (PRIUNT:) DI: IOR: DE: PARDVN:
AVERVND.

This means, in plain English, to say † "Clarice, the wife of Geoffry de
Bolleit, lies here: God on her soul have mercy: Who prays for her soul
shall have ten days’ pardon." <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) Now the
"Bo" we know to be another form of Beau, in ancient French names. Leit
may be a variation of lieu. The provincial pronunciation of Beaulieu is,
in many parts of Northern France, simply Bolè.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And this is the
nearest approach to the proper sound of the name that a Cornish man
would be likely to turn his tongue to form. This old Norman family, as
in many other instances, might have done their best to give to their new
inheritance a name which was a common one in their former home. This
conjecture respecting the derivation is at least as probable as the
others. We know of no Cornish name which terminated in leit, yet, if the
name be Cornish, it is safer to take the traditional pronunciation of
those who live in Buryan than to go by any mode of spelling.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[29:\*](swc205.htm#fr_1.md) It is somewhat curious
to notice that no one who has written on the parish of Buryan, in
speaking of the Boleit tombstone in the church, has pointed out that the
inscription is, in accordance with a very common custom, in verse,
namely in a triplet followed by a distich. It reads thus:—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

Clarice, la femme Cheffrei  
de Bolleit, git ici,  
Dieu de lalme eit mercie.  
Ke pur lalme punt  
Di for de pardun aveunt.

</div>

The word punt in the fourth line is short for prierunt. Probably there
is now, or at all events, has been at some time, in the original, a
small letter r above the word between the p and the u. An r has been
similarly omitted in aveunt. This somewhat primitive epitaph may be thus
literally translated into equally primitive English:—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

Clarice, the wife of Jefferei  
Of Bolleit, here doth lie.  
God of her soul have mercie.  
For her soul whoever prays  
Shall have pardon for ten days.
