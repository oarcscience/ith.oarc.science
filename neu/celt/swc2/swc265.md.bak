Then his cruisings o’er the seas,  
Westward to the Herbrides,  
  And to Scilly's rocky shore;  
And the hermit's cavern dismal,  
Christ's great name and rites baptismal,  
  In the ocean's rush and roar.

We find an interesting notice of Danish marauding expeditions

in Cornwall, and of King Olaf's conversion at Scilly, in Snorro
Sturleson's "Heimskringla"—the "World's Circle"—which relates events
from the early ages, when mythology and history were undistinguishably
blended, down nearly to the period of Sturleson's birth in 1178.

The following is from Laing's translation of the "Saga," or story of
King Olaf Tryggvesson, who reigned from about the year 995 to the year
1000.

Thereafter Olaf Tryggvesson sailed to England, and ravaged wide around
the land. He sailed all the way north to Northumberland, where he
plundered; and thence to Scotland, where he marauded far and wide. Then
he went to the Hebrides, where he fought some battles; and then
southward to Man, where he also fought. He ravaged far around in
Ireland, and thence steered to Bretland, which he laid waste with fire
and sword, and also the district called Cumberland. He sailed westward
from thence to Valland and marauded there. When he left the west,
intending to sail to England, he came to the islands called the Scilly
Isles, lying westward from England in the ocean. Thus tells Halfred
Vandrædaskalt of these events:—

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

"The brave young king who ne’er retreats,  
 The Englishmen in England beats.  
 Death through Northumberland is spread  
 From battle-axe and broad spear-head.  
 Through Scotland with his spear he rides;  
 To Man his glancing ships he guides;  
 Feeding the wolves where’er he came,  
 The young king drove a bloody game.  
 The gallant bowman in the isles  
 Slew foemen, who lay heaped in piles.  
 The Irish fled at Olaf's name—  
 Fled from a young king seeking fame.  
 In Bretland, and in Kauraland,  
 People against him could not stand:  
 Thick on the field their corpses lay,  
 To ravens and howling wolves a prey."

Olaf Tryggvesson had been four years on this cruise, from the time he
left Vendland till he came to the Scilly Isles.

While Olaf Tryggvesson lay in the Scilly Isles he heard of a seer, or
fortune-teller, on the islands, who could tell beforehand things not yet
done, and what he foretold many believed was really fulfilled. Olaf
became curious to try this man's gift of prophecy. He therefore sent one
of his men, who was the handsomest and the strongest, clothed him
magnificently, and bade him say he was the king; for Olaf was known in
all countries as handsomer, stronger, and braver than all others,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

although, after he had left Russia, he retained no more of his name than
that he was called Ola, and was Russian. Now when the messenger came to
the fortune-teller, and gave himself out for the king, he got the
answer. "Thou art not the king, but I advise thee to be faithful to thy
king." And more he would not say to that man. The man returned, and told
Olaf, and his desire to meet the fortune-teller was increased; and now
he had no doubt of his being really a fortune-teller. Olaf repaired
himself to him, and, entering into conversation, asked him if he could
foresee how it would go with him with regard to his kingdom, or of any
other fortune he was to have. The hermit replies in a holy spirit of
prophecy, "Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds.
Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and
others’ good; and that thou mayest have no doubt of the truth of this
answer listen to these tokens: When thou comest to thy ships many of thy
people will conspire against thee, and then a battle. will follow in
which many of thy men will fall and thou wilt be wounded almost to
death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet, after seven days,
thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself
be baptised." Soon after Olaf went down to his ships, where he met some
mutineers and people who would destroy him and his men. A fight took
place, and the result was what the hermit had predicted, that Olaf was
wounded, and carried upon a shield to his ship, and that his wound was
healed in seven days. Then Olaf perceived the man had spoken truth,—that
he was a true fortune-teller, and had the gift of prophecy. Olaf went
once more to the hermit, and asked particularly how he came to have such
wisdom in foreseeing things to be. The hermit replied that the
Christian's God himself let him know all that he desired; and he brought
before Olaf many great proofs of the power of the Almighty. In
consequence of this encouragement Olaf agreed to let himself be
baptised, and he and all his followers were baptised forthwith. He
remained here a long time, took the true faith, and got with him priests
and other learned men."

It is worthy of remark that various accounts hit this work, of the
marauding expeditions of northern vikings on the shores of Bretland and
Kauraland (Wales and Cornwall) confirm many traditions still lingering
in the West Country, about the Danes, (all Northmen were called Danes)
landing on Gwenvor Sands, burning Escols, their defeat in a battle on
Velandruchar Moor, and how their ships remained in Whitsand Bay till
"birds built in their rigging," &c.

Red-haired families are still often taunted with bearing on their heads
a sign that some ancestress must have welcomed a

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

northern pirate to Kauraland with more warmth than discretion.

The "seer," or "fortune-teller," on the islands, was probably one of a
similar class to the Cornish "pellar," or "white-wizzard," of the
present day.

King Olaf's priest, taken from Scilly, is one of the most remarkable
characters of the wonderful book.
