### <span class="smallcaps">The Proud Pendars</span>

<div style="margin-left: 25%">

O it is sad! O it is sad  
To think of the joys that once I had:  
To wander lone over land and sea,  
And know that she waits no more for me.  
This tress of her fair, soft, chestnut hair,  
Is all the cruel grave would spare.

At Beaton's death what had been her portion of the property fell in
hand, and Mary removed to Chynance, taking with her a few such articles
of the old furniture as were not too cumbersome for her small dwelling;
but everything in "Beaton's chamber" was left there for the time, as it
stood when she was carried out. Mary's life had been anything but a
cheerful one for the past year or two, but after her mother's decease
she felt very desolate. Her uncle's family urged her to return and live
with them, which she was inclined to do, as she often said that Brittany
seemed less gloomy to her than this country; because in the Cornuaille
over the water young and old met, every Sunday it least, at their parish
church, and joined in a dance after service; besides there were yearly
feasts in neighbouring parishes on their patron saints days, to which
people flocked from miles away; they were hospitably entertained,
without regard to rank, at the feasten board; and all regarded it as a
sort of religious duty to take part in dancing, hurling, wrestling, and
other games that were continued several days of the feasten week.

"It seems to me like forsaking my poor mother to leave this place," Mary
would say to An’ Joan, "but over sea my cousins are always happy
together, and they knew no difference between me and their sisters; but
here I feel as desolate as a forsaken bird, though Chynance is a
pleasant sunny spot, and nobody can be kinder to me than you and others
who knew my dear mother." In such likes sad complaints she bemoaned her
lonely state, till love came to brighten the scene, for a brief space.

Mary frequently took her work to Penberth and passed the afternoons or
evenings with An’ Joan. As the dame sold liquor from a noggin to an
"anker" (keg), her dwelling was often pretty well filled with company,
of an evening. And Mary often said that such gatherings of neighbours,
to hear news, sing songs, or relate old stories, reminded her of home,
as she called Brittany.

Now, it so happened, a few months after Mary again settled in Chynance,
she was one afternoon on a visit to An’ Joan, when a young officer, home
on a furlough, from a man-of-war, entered the dwelling, saluted An’
Joan—who had known him from a child—and called for brandy and cordials
to treat the dame and

himself; by the time they were seated for cosy chat, Mary entered with
baskets of fruit from the orchard. The young sailor rose, saluted her,
and seemed surprised to see one—apparently an inmate of Joan's—with the
dress and demeanour of a lady; her broken English, with Breton accent,
betokened her to be a foreigner. "Don't ’e disturb yourself, Mr.
Pendar," said An’ Joan, "this young lady, poor dear, all the same to me
as a daughter, is the damsel Mary I’an."

Mr. Pendar—who is said to have been one of those who then lived in
Pendrea—had heard some gossip, on his first arrival at home, about the
good looks, rare accomplishments, and strange history of this waif of
the I’an's; and how she had refused many offers of marriage from
farmers’ sons that were thought good chances for her. Young Pendar took
a liking at first sight to the poor orphan, and his love was not more
sudden than honest and constant; and her feelings towards the young
sailor must have been equally favourable, one may suppose, as they often
met at Penberth and elsewhere, and purposed to be wedded on his next
return from a short voyage. But the artless sailor and simple maiden
made their calculations without his parents’ consent. Little thought
Mary, and less cared her lover, about what the old Pendars styled the
stain on her paternity, or their talk about disowning or disinheriting.
The brave heart of oak but little regarded his mother railing in bitter
terms, of Mary's poverty and base birth, and of Beaton's youthful
failing; or his father saying, "that as he made his bed he might lie on
it; that if he wedded one of nought, he should be cut off with a
shilling." But more devilry was set to work than the youngster knew of.

At parting, to join his ship, he told his father to keep his shilling,
as he cared not for anything he had to withhold or bestow, that he saw
no reason why the daughter should suffer for her parents’ failings; he
thought they had undergone more than enough themselves and that he was
determined to win fortune and choose a wife for himself. On taking leave
of Mary he assured her that when he returned from a short voyage he
would make her his bride.

Pendar left home to join his ship, which he thought would make but a
short voyage.

Many months elapsed, but Mary had no tidings of her affianced lover;
and, about the time she expected his return a report was circulated that
he was killed in a naval engagement. As months rolled on and brought no
other intelligence, Mary too readily believed the common talk; and, poor
grieved soul, for many an hour she would sit, all alone, on a rock
beside the shore, look wistfully out to sea, and chant some old Breton
melody about

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

meeting her true-love in the fairy orchards of Avalon. And her wild
song, by the moaning waves, was sad to hear as a funeral dirge. Like a
blasted flower she pined and died, and was laid beside her parents, when
the young seaman, her lover, was hastening homeward in hopes to make her
his bride.

Pendar arrived at Penberth with a good store of prize-money, heard, with
anguish, how Mary had died of a broken heart, all through a vile scheme
of his parents, who spread the sad rumour, and had no reason to think
him dead; because they, unknown to him, contrived to have him drafted to
a cruiser that was sent to protect merchantmen in distant seas. He was
kept in ignorance of his destination, and had no means to inform Mary
that years might elapse before his return. He left home without seeing
his father or mother, and never more returned to Buryan; yet ’tis said
that he became renowned as a brave naval commander, and died unmarried.

Within a few days of Mary's death, her uncle made a trip to Fowey, with
a cargo of contraband goods, and on his return voyage, shaped his course
for the Land's End, intending to land in Mount's Bay, to visit his
niece, and persuade her to return with him. His ship approached land off
Penberth; the sea being smooth, he ran her close in, near the cove, that
he might be taken ashore in his ship's boat. It so happened that his old
craft was running for the cove in this Autumn evening's twilight with a
thick fog. The *Mur's* crew mistook I’an's vessel, beating the same
course, for a revenue cutter, and one of the hands fired a random shot
between "wind and water" that killed their former commander, as he was
about to step into his boat; some say it was on the very evening of his
niece's funeral. The Breton crew fired on the *Mur*, and sunk her.
Almost all Penberth men were on board, and the greatest part of them
were drowned within hail of the cove and their dwellings. I’an was taken
home to be buried, in Brittany, and his family dropped all intercourse
with their father's native place.

It was not known here till years after the fatal mishap that I’an was
killed by a shot from the *Mur*, or that it was his ship's company who
sent many of his old crew to a watery grave.
