### <span class="smallcaps">A Ghostly Ship's-Bell</span>.

In the southern side of St. Levan Churchyard there is a low altar-tomb
on the grave of Captain Wetherel, whose ship sprung a-leak and sunk, and
who was drowned near the Rundle Stone many years ago. This grave is
regarded with fear and wonder by many persons of that neighbourhood; for
ever since the Captain was laid there, it has been believed that a
ghostly bell strikes the hours, and half-hours, in his grave, the same
as on board ship.

’Tis said this sound beneath the sod may be heard the clearest by
persons passing the Churchyard at midnight. It was a few minutes before
that hour, when the Captain, finding his vessel sinking, made his crew
take to the boat; but he himself refused to quit his ship; and, as she
went down, they heard him give eight loud and distinct strokes on the
bell.

Many years since several young people were assembled in the Churchyard
one Sunday forenoon, after service had commenced and the elders had gone
into Church; time passed pleasantly with the young folks in chatting
about such occurrences of the St. Levan world as interested them. In
rambling among the graves, to look at the many garden flowers that
bloomed on them, they approached Captain Wetherel's tomb, and a girl who
stood by it reading the inscription, started back on hearing a hollow
sound beneath her feet; she, and others near her, who saw her emotion,
listened, and lo! a ringing came up as of a bell at sea; all rushed into
Church in great fright. There was much talk of the strange occurrence
for a few weeks, and less loitering of the youngsters to gossip in the
Churchyard during service.

Shortly after a young sailor, belonging to St. Levan, who had been
absent many years, came home for a few weeks; being in the "Elder Tree"
public-house, one forenoon, with some of his former companions, their
discourse led to the mention of the ship's-bell sounding in Captain
Wetherel's grave. The young seaman said he believed the story was all
nonsense, though as strange or stranger things sometimes happened in old
vessels; but, as it was then near upon twelve o'clock, for curiosity
sake, he went out and stood near the Captain's tomb; whilst his comrades
remained by the Church porch, for a few minutes, watching the sun-dial.
As it marked noon the sailor rushed back to his companions, and, looking
as pale as a corpse, said, with bated breath, "True as I'm alive, I
heard 'eight bells' struck in the grave, and wouldn't go near the spot
again for the world."

The young seaman, on his next voyage, found his grave in the deep.

I never heard of any other person who went purposely to hear the
Captain's bell, for it is a general belief here that bad luck is sure to
overtake those who endeavour to pry into ghostly doings that don't
concern them. Although the belief still holds, yet most West Country
folks are become shy of mentioning Captain Wetherel's bell, or of
talking on kindred subjects, except amongst ourselves, from the ridicule
with which it is now fashionable to treat such matters, even in St.
Levan.
