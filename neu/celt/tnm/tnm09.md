### VII.--HEIMDALL.--THE SYBIL HYNDLA.

A fragment at Jurby ([pl. VIII.](#img_pl08).md) shows on one face,. above
the right arm of the cross, a figure of a Man in a tunic with a row of
large buttons; in his left hand a short, pointed sword, his right
holding to his mouth a long Alpine horn (*Lur*). On his head is a
curious helmet, above the horn a flying raven.

Evidently this is intended for Heimdall, Warder of the Gods, who is
stationed at the foot of the rainbow *Bif-rost*, "quaking bridge,"
leading from earth to Asgard. At Ragnarök he summons the gods to the
last great battle by a. blast on the Giallar horn, which rings through
all the nine worlds:--

"Loud blows Heimdall,  
his horn is up-lift."

The Raven flies before him carrying the tidings to Odin. On the other
face ([pl. IX.](#img_pl09).md), in like position, is a female

figure, dog-headed, with long, braided hair. As suggested by Professor
S. Bugge, this may be the Sibyl Hyndla, " little Hound," who prophesies
of Heimdall and of Ragnarök.
