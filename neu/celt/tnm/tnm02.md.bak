### MYTHOLOGY <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

As pointed out in the Corp. Poet. Bor., the old Norse mythology, with
its very primitive conceptions of the origin of the universe--the earth
the flesh of a mighty giant, <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) ocean his
blood, the rocks his bones, heaven made out of his skull, clouds out of
his brains, and so on; its gods the personifications of natural forces
or deified heroes; its belief in ghosts living in barrows--ancestor
worship; all this gave way to the more complex ideas of the Viking
period, due to contact with the Celtic folk and a smattering
acquaintance with the Christian religion.

"In this system Odin became King of the Slain in Battle, head of a royal
race of Anses, a Charlemain of the Empyrean, with a splendid Hall, a
host of Hand-maidens, a chosen guard of the fallen kings and heroes of
all generations, who feast on (boiled) pork and mead, and spend the day
in war-like sport, just as their earthly types did. Then there is a
great Last Battle to be fought by the Warrior-Angels and the Elect
against the Beast and the Dragon, and the Demons of Fire, an eschatology
the origin of which is very plain." <span id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_4.md)

As the authors point out, however, this Wicking religion was never the
accepted faith of the Norsemen, Danes,

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

and Swedes. Some of its most famous myths, such as that which
transformed the gallows-tree--*Yggdrasil* (lit., Odin's Steed) to a Tree
of Life, may never have travelled beyond the single poem in which it was
wrought out by a master mind!

Besides the remarkable illustrations carved on stone, showing the hold
their ancient myths and legends had on the sculptors of these Christian
monuments in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, we are able to trace
them in many of the usages, rites, and customs which have come down to
our own day, in sayings, and proverbs, and names--in a word, in our
Folklore.

Now, as to the High Gods, or *Anses*, we are met with the curious fact,
which our familiarity with it alone accounts for our regarding as a
matter of course, that of the seven days of the week all but the first
two are called after Scandinavian Gods.

The third day, *Dies Martis*, was assigned to Ty, Tiu, a god of war, the
most daring of the gods. It was he who placed his right hand in the jaws
of the Fenri Wolf when that monster demanded such a pledge of good faith
before suffering the gods to bind him in the charmed fetters
(*gleipnir*). His hand was bitten off, and he feels the loss when in the
last great battle he meets the hound Garm and each slays the other. As
we have no figure of Tiu, nor do I recognize him in our folklore, except
that Tuesday was considered lucky, I pass on to the next.

*Dies Mercurii*, becomes the day of Odin, Woden, the supreme god, god of
Heaven, the Heaven itself (*Ouranos*); the fountain-head of wisdom and
founder of poetry, writing, and culture; lord of battle and giver of the
highest blessings, especially of victory; later, of magic and sorcery.
His is the creative power: out of Ash and Elm he made man

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

and woman. The later tales of his wonderful travels, his many names and
disguises, his eloquence and magical power, may have suggested to the
Romans a resemblance to Mercury (Hermes).

He is represented as old, long-bearded, one-eyed. A myth of the earliest
type relates how his eye was given in pledge to Mimi, Giant of the
Abyss, for a single draught of the deep Well of Wisdom. He is clad in a
blue cloak (invisibility) and, like Hermes, a broad-brimmed hat or a
Hood, whence one of his many names--Grim, which became a favourite man's
name, and, as such occurs in two of our runic inscriptions. Another
name, Gautr, Father (as in Vsp:--"*Upp reiss Odin alderen Gautr*"--Up
rose Odin, the ancient sire), was also a favourite, and occurs as that
of our greatest Scandinavian sculptor, who, on a cross at Michael,
claims to have "made this and all in Man"! He is "wielder of Gungnir,"
the spear, which, as he hurls it over the battlefield, all those over
whom it passes are doomed to fall, and " fare to Odin."

He is accompanied by two wolves, Geri and Freki--Greed and Fierceness.
Two Ravens, Hugin and Munnin--Mind and Memory, fly through all the
worlds and return to rest on his shoulders bringing him tidings of all
that is being done.

The word Oðin appears to be related to Óðr (A.S., wod; Eng., wood), mad,
wild, furious, and with his tall white horse, Sleipnir, the slipper,
which, by way of implying its exceeding swiftness, is represented as
eight-footed, he appears in folklore throughout the north of Europe as
the "Wild Huntsman," of which we still meet with faint echoes in the
Isle of Man, reduced to stories of Fairy hunters, hounds, and horn.
Again we trace him in our harvest customs, such as that of the last
sheaf,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

and, of the *Laare-vane* (white horse), <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) as may be seen by comparison with similar
customs in the North of England and in Europe; for example, in Saxony,
the last clump of standing corn is dedicated to Woden for his horse.

In one or two Manks stories a *Hair rope* figures conspicuously. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) Can this in any way refer to Odin? In
Ynglinga-tal the *halter* is described as "Hagbard's goat-hair rope,"
and, elsewhere we read of Odin's horse-hair beard."

From his name, Ygg (Awe), comes that of the World--Ash, *Ygg-drasil*,
Odin's steed, because he hanged on the tree "himself to himself a
sacrifice," when he sought wisdom at Mimi's burn. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) (So, in English poetry, the Cross is
"Christ's palfry.") As lord of the gallows, all who die by hanging are
thereby dedicated to Odin!

Under his name Hnikar, he is a water-god, and as such we commemorate him
in the Nickey, a favourite rig of fishing boats. The term "Old Nick" of
course refers to him. Mr. Quine points out an ancient
place-name--"Nikkeson," a pool in Glen Roy, and another at Groudle, both
having legends of a water sprite. <span id="fr_8"></span>[4](#fn_8.md)

In the oldest myths we hear of him in his "high-seat," looking out of
the *Litho-skialf*--window in Heaven--whence all things can be seen. In
later Viking times Valhall, his dwelling, is a great and magnificent
abode, with

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 540 doors, through any one of which 800
champions can ride abreast. It is thatched with golden shields, raftered
with shafts, and has the "wall-panelling all covered with fair shields
"; for torches, when required, Odin sends for swords! Hither come the
kings of the earth and the champions slain in battle, *einherja*,
conducted and welcomed by the Valkyrie or shield-maidens, to spend their
days in sport, their nights in feasting, till, at Ragnarök--the great
Day of Doom--they ride forth with the gods to meet in deadly combat the
monsters, giants, and demons led to the attack by the treacherous Loki.

The fifth day, *Dies Jovis*, we call after Thor, son of Odin and Frigga
(mother earth), husband of Sif, the golden-haired goddess. (Cornfield,
Ceres.) He is called Okuthor--Wagon Thor--as he never rides like the
other gods, but always walks or drives the car drawn by two he-goats,
Tann-gniostr and Tann-grisnir--Tooth-gnasher and Tooth-tearer. He is the
husbandman's god (Goffar--good-father), whose wrath and anger are ever
directed against the evil powers that injure mortals and their
possessions. He is the special god of the Norwegians, and I think we may
explain a phrase in S. Olaf's Saga--"Thor Engels-manna god, ok Odin Saxa
god . . . ok Frey Svia god"--concerning which Vigfusson asks, "Why the
poet should describe him as the Englishman's god," in this way, that the
reference was to the western settlers--Norwegians--now one with the
English!

Thor is represented as in the prime of life, red-bearded. When he blows
in anger in his beard, men say it is lightning; when they hear the
rumbling of his car across the heavens, it thunders. He is lord of the
"Hammer of Might"--*Miolnir*, the mauler (Thunderbolt)--which returns to
him when he has thrown it; he owns the " Belt of Strength "

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Medingarde*. Brides and the bodies of the dead
are consecrated by his Hammer. He is a constant foe to the giants, and
the deadly enemy of Loki and his fearful brood. In Doomsday he slays the
world-dragon--*Jörmundgandr*.

His dwelling--Bilskirnir (Bright-Time)--is in the south-west corner of
the sky, whence summer lightnings come.

He enters largely into the medieval conception of the Devil!

We find traces of him in the Isle of Man in holding Thursday as a lucky
day and favourite for *weddings*, also in our regard for the Rowan,
which enters into one of his myths, where it is called "Thor's rescue."
His following is further attested in our runic inscriptions by the many
names compounded with his:--Thor-biaurn, at Baldwin, Braddan (?) and
Michael (?); Thor-fiak and Thor-libr, Braddan; Thor-waltr, Andreas;
Thor-ulfr, Michael; and Thurith at Conchan. So also two of our existing
names:--Corkill, from Mac Thor-Ketill, and Corlett, from Mac Thor-leod.

The next day, *Dies Veneris*, is dedicated to Frigga, wife of Odin, who,
however, seems rather to resemble Juno than Venus. As Odin's consort she
"knows the fates of men," and sometimes crosses his intentions in regard
to them. For example, a tale is told in medieval times to explain the
origin of the Lombards. By Frigga's advice they set their women in the
ranks, their hair so done as to resemble beards. Odin, looking out of
his window, exclaimed, "Who are these Long-beards?" Thereupon Frigga
confessed the trick, and claimed the customary forfeit for having
bestowed upon them a new name--in this case victory for her friends! To
this legend we may trace our story of the Battle of Santwat, when the
women of the north (or of the south, for

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I have heard it told both ways, according as the
narrator hailed from south or north) appeared in the ranks, and the
battle was won.

We have no illustration of Frigga, but I think one may recognize her in
a usage now dying out. On our Fair-days we would have cakes of
ginger-bread (fairings), moulded in the figures of a man, a woman, man
and woman conjoined, a horse, a man on horseback, and a cock.

The man was probably Thor, the woman Frigga, the man and woman Odin and
Frigga, the man on horseback Odin, and the horse his steed Sleipnir. The
cock might be *Giollan-kambi*--Gold-comb--which crows in Valhalla, or
possibly intended to represent Heimdall, who summons the gods by a blast
on the Gialla-horn at the dawn of Ragnarök. I have not seen this idea
suggested by any Folklorist, but, that it is not a mere guess appears by
the fact that in Sweden cakes were baked in the form of Frey's Boar on
Yule eve. In Fridthiof's Saga, also, we read of *baked images of gods*,
smeared with oil. By Fridthiof's fault a baked Baldr falls into the
fire, blazes up, and burns down the house.

But Frigga-tag is also Fria-tag, and this arises from a confusion of
Freya with the former, whose handmaid she was, and mistress of the
Valkyrie. She was one of the Vanir--gods of a lower caste than the
Anses, merging into the Elves. She was deserted by her husband Od, whom
she seeks through the nine worlds, weeping tears of gold. Her car is
drawn by two cats, which animals are sacred to her. The unluckiness of
meeting a cat on New Year's morning, and the popular association of the
animal with witches may be due to a dim recollection of Freya.

Her brother Frey, son of Niördr, the special god of the Swedes, who
again is confused with Freya, and so with,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Frigga, is lord of love and fruitfulness, of
fertility and peace. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) His car is drawn
by the boar *Gullinbursti*, whose "golden bristles" light up the night
like day, who runs with the speed of a horse. His sword, which could put
itself into motion against the brood of giants, he gave up for the fair
Gerðr, which was held to be the cause of his death, when, at Ragnarökr,
he had to stand single combat with Surtr.

The seventh day was known in old Norse as Laugardagr (Dan., Löverdag),
and though the popular idea connected it with the "bath" (tub-night),
Grimm suggests a reference to Loki, son of giant Farbauti, a Fire god.

In the "Edda" we read of Utgarðaloki, son of Giant Forniot; from early
times these two have become merged. Grimm thinks they may be compared to
the Prometheus and the Hephaestus (Vulcan) of the Greeks.

In Viking days Loki was regarded as one of the Anses. Fair of form, he
is the only god of an evil disposition. He is described as guileful,
cunning, crafty, "Back-biter of the Anses." "Full oft hath he brought
the Asa into great straits, and oft set them free by cunning redes." It
was only on account of the constant amusement he afforded them that he
was tolerated. He is the mischief-maker, mocker, seducer, tempter; and
as such enters largely into our conception of the Devil.

In Jötunheim (Giants' home) he got with the witch Angrbotha, a family of
dread monsters--a daughter, Hel, and two sons, Fenris wolf and
Jörmundgand or Miðgardsworm. When they grew up, Odin cast Hel into
Nifleheim, and all who die of sickness or old age go to her. A lost

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

song, quoted by Snorri, gives a grim description of her surroundings in
language worthy of the author of the "Faerie Queen." Sleet-den hight her
hall, Hunger her dish, Famine her knife, Starvation her spoon. Despair
is the porch, Stumbling-stone the threshold, Pale Woe the door, Care-bed
the couch, and so on. The Wolf a mighty monster, meets Odin at Ragnarök.
The Serpent, "Earth's girdle," he cast into the sea, where it grew so
that it coiled itself round all the earth and bit its tail with its
teeth.

Loki's worst deed was the death of Baldr. When at last the gods were as
wroth with him as was to be weened, they chased and captured him. They
then turned his son Vali into a wolf's likeness, and he tore his brother
Nan, with whose entrails they bound Loki over three great stones. Then
took Skadi, daughter of the giant Thiassi and wife of Njörd, an
adder-worm and fastened it over him, so that the venom should drop on
his face; but Sigyn, his wife, stands by him and holds a dish under the
venom drops, which, when full, she empties; but while the venom drops on
his face he is so racked that the whole earth shakes; "that call ye
earthquake. There lieth he till the Doomsday of the gods." (*Pr. Ed.
77*.) <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) In the end he breaks loose and
steers the ship *Naglfar* (Nail-board), made of dead men's nails, at
Ragnarök, when he meets Heimdal, and they are each other's bane. Our
folklore notion that all nail-cuttings should be carefully destroyed may
have reference to this, the idea being to delay the building of the Ship
and so postpone the Day of Doom!

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Besides the gods of the week, we have in our sculpturings a figure of
Heimdall, and in our folklore faint traces of Balder.

Heimdall is the warder of the gods' dwelling and set in Himinbiorg at
the foot of the Rainbow, Bifrost--"quaking bridge," which leads from
Earth to Asgarth. He is "the whitest of the Anses," a god of Day, and
has the peculiarity of being born of nine mothers.

"I am nine Mothers' child, nine Sisters' son am I"

so he sings in a fragment of a lost poem.

It was he who created the three classes of men--Earls, Churls, and
Thralls. From his name Rig is derived that of *Ericksgata*, the Milky
Way, the gods' highroad across the skies. This is evidently the origin
of our story of King Orry and the Milky Way.

Heimdall, the "wind-listening god," hears the grass grow, and the wool
on the back of the sheep. As warder of the gods he has charge of the
Gialla-horn, kept at the roots of the sacred Tree, the blast of which
rings through the nine worlds when he summons the gods for the last
great battle, in which he meets and slays Loki, by whom he himself is
slain.

Finally, so far as the Isle of Man is concerned, we have Balder, son of
Odin and Frigga, a divinity of Light and Fire, in many respects
resembling the Celtic Beal. He was done to death through the treachery
of Loki, who, learning that he was invulnerable to everything except the
Mistletoe, maliciously placed a wand of that plant in the hands of Hoðr
(Hood), Balder's blind brother, and, giving him the direction, urged him
to throw it for sport. So Balder fell dead. Hermoðr, his twin brother,
galloped away on Sleipnir to treat with Hel for his release, and finally
she

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

agreed that if indeed Balder were so beloved that every-thing quick and
dead should weep for him, he might fare back to the Anses. But when all
things were willing to do so, the returning messengers passed a cave,
where was an Ogress called Thokk, who replied, "Thokk will bewail with
dry tears Balder's balefire. . . . Let Hel hold what she has." After
Ragnarök, the Sibyl in Voluspa tells--Balder shall come back and "all
sorrows shall be healed."

In the Hibbert Lectures, "Celtic Heathendom," 1886, Professor Rhys
compares this story with the old Celtic myths of "The Sun Hero." He
points out that Balder was not simply the sun, but the summer sun, whose
return is witnessed in the north only after protracted waiting. His
dwelling-place in the heavens (*Breiðablik*, Broad-gleam) seems to refer
to the arctic summer, when the sun prolongs his stay above the horizon.

Only one incident connected with Balder is figured in our
sculpturings--the dwarf Lit, who ns across Thor's path when he is going
to hallow the funeral pyre.

We trace him in our folk-lore. Kelly, in the "Manx Society's
Dictionary," *s.v*. "Baaltinn," refers to the local custom of kindling
fires on the summits of the highest hills, "but the modern practice is
for each balla or town to kindle a fire, so that the wind may drive the
smoke over their corn fields, cattle, and habitations. . . . It is also
the usage to put out the culinary fires on that day, and to re-kindle
them with some of the sacred fire." He then refers to the mock
engagements between Summer and Winter on May-day, *Laaboaldyn*; <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) also to the strewing of "primroses" and
the crosses of mountain ash.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Now the Midsummer fires obtained almost all over Europe in early
Christian times, but there is little doubt they were of Heathen origin.
The authors of "Corp. Poet. Bor." ask:--"Do the fires of John
commemorate the burning of Balder's body?" The northern Easter fires too
were certainly heathen, and sacrificial in origin. Grimm points out that
the Celtic Belfires and the Teutonic Phol-days (Balder) were nearly
midway betwixt Easter and Midsummer, but nearer Easter when it falls
late. The battle of Summer and Winter, as Mr. Moore says in his
"Folklore," is undoubtedly of Scandinavian origin, but it is rather
Swedish and Gothic than Norwegian.

Besides the Anses and the Vanir and the Elves (light and dark), we have
the Giants, generally hostile to the gods, but sometimes friendly. They
are the "hill-folk" or "cave-men," and live at
[Jötunheim](errata.htm#0.md), on the edge of the Earth, which is imagined
flat, and surrounded by the Ocean. <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)
Some of these appear in our carvings, and our folk-tales refer to
others.

Then we have the Dwarves--"not always baneful." The firmament is upheld
by four of these, named after the cardinal points of the compass. They
live chiefly in rocks and caves underground, hence are gatherers and
hoarders of precious stones and metals. Trolls, from which we get a
place-name--Trollaby--seem to be between Giants and Monsters. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) Our *Phynnodderee* and *Glashtin*, if of
Celtic

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

origin, as seems likely, partake of the nature of Trolls, showing the
Scandinavian influence on our Folklore.

Loki's brood of monsters has already been referred to; there were others
also, as the Wolves of the Eclipse, "the gripper and tearer of the Moon,
the swallower of the loaf of the heavens, the destroyer of the sky's
light "; also the wicked, venomous "tearer of corpses "--*Nidhogg*, and,
lastly, the fire-fiends, *Mu-spilli*, sons of treason, sons of
destruction, etc.

Finally, we have to do with the semi-divine beings--the Heroes--who were
human, but of divine descent. The greatest of these, and the favourite
from earliest times, was Sigurd the Volsung, whose slaying of the dragon
Fafni and capture of the gold-hoard, with the effects of the baneful
curse accompanying it, are vividly pourtrayed on at the least four of
our sculptured stones.
