PLATE VII.  
GRIM'', CROSS, MICHAEL.  
THE WIND-GIANT, HRÆ-SVELGR, CARRION-SWALLOWER.  

### VI.--THE WIND-GIANT, HRÆ-SVELGR, CARRION-SWALLOWER.

Before taking leave of the Giants I submit an illustration ([pl.
VII.](#img_pl07).md) which puzzled me much. A cross-slab at Michael has on
one face, and above the right arm of the cross, the figure of a man and
a great bird. At first I thought of Loki seized by the giant Thiazzi in
eagle form in the story of the Rape of Idwyn, <span

by Dr. York Powell, the man is not holding on either to a stick or to
the bird, but seems rather to

be attacked by it. I think now there can be little doubt it refers to
the fall of some hero unknown, such, for example, as Ottar the Doughty,
of whom we read in "Ynlinga-Tal," 93-96: "Ottarr the Doughty fell by the
weapons of the Danes, under the talons of the Eagle, when the
war-vulture spurned him, the reason-endowed, with its brute carrion feet
at Wendle."

Is not this Hræ-svelgr? As in Vafthruðnis-mal--"Hræ-svelgr
(Carrion-gulper) is he called, a giant in eagle's shape,. that sits at
the end of heaven; from under his wings the wind that blows over all men
is said to come." So in the Edda (Gylfi's mocking). And in
"Volu-spa"--"But the Eagle screams. Pale-beak tear corpses."

The other face of this stone is shown on [pl. IV.](tnm05.htm#img_pl04.md)
