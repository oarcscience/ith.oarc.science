### CHAPTER XII

# Story of Thomas the Rhymer

At the beginning of each summer, when the milk-white hawthorn is in
bloom, anointing the air with its sweet odour, and miles and miles of
golden whin adorn the glens and hill-slopes, the fairies come forth in
grand procession, headed by the Fairy Queen. They are mounted on little
white horses, and when on a night of clear soft moonlight the people
hear the clatter of many hoofs, the jingling of bridles, and the sound
of laughter and sweet music coming sweetly down the wind, they whisper
one to another: "’Tis the Fairy Folks' Raid", or "Here come the Riders
of the Shee".

The Fairy Queen, who rides in front, is gowned in grass-green silk, and
wears over her shoulders a mantle of green velvet adorned with silver
spangles. She is of great beauty. Her eyes are like wood violets, her
teeth like pearls, her brow and neck are swan-white, and her cheeks
bloom like ripe apples. Her long clustering hair of rich auburn gold
which falls over her shoulders and

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

down her back, is bound round about with a snood that glints with
star-like gems, and there is one great flashing jewel above her brow. On
each lock of her horse's mane hang sweet-toned silver bells that tinkle
merrily as she rides on.

The riders who follow her in couples are likewise clad in green, and
wear little red caps bright as the flaming poppies in waving fields of
yellow barley. Their horses' manes are hung with silver whistles upon
which the soft winds play. Some fairies twang harps of gold, some make
sweet music on oaten pipes, and some sing with birdlike voices in the
moonlight. When song and music cease, they chat and laugh merrily as
they ride on their way. Over hills and down glens they go, but no
hoof-mark is left by their horses. So lightly do the little white
creatures trot that not a grass blade is broken by their tread, nor is
the honey-dew spilled from blue harebells and yellow buttercups.
Sometimes the fairies ride over tree-tops or through the air on eddies
of western wind. The Riders of the Shee always come from the west.

When the Summer Fairy Raid is coming, the people hang branches of rowan
over their doors and round their rooms, and when the Winter Raid is
coming they hang up holly and mistletoe as protection from attack; for
sometimes the fairies steal pretty children while they lie fast asleep,
and

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

carry them off to Fairyland, and sometimes they lure away pipers and
bards, and women who have sweet singing voices.

Once there was a great bard who was called Thomas the Rhymer. He lived
at Ercildoune (Earlston), in Berwickshire, during the thirteenth
century. It is told that he vanished for seven years, and that when he
reappeared he had the gift of prophecy. Because he was able to foretell
events, he was given the name of True Thomas.

All through Scotland, from the Cheviot Hills to the Pentland Firth, the
story of Thomas the Rhymer has long been known.

During his seven years' absence from home be is said to have dwelt in
fairyland. One evening, so runs the tale, he was walking alone on the
banks of Leader Water when he saw riding towards him the Fairy Queen on
her milk-white steed, the silver bells tinkling on its mane, and the
silver bridle jingling sweet and clear. He was amazed at her beauty, and
thinking she was the Queen of Heaven, bared his head and knelt before
her as she dismounted, saying: "All hail, mighty Queen of Heaven! I have
never before seen your equal."

Said the green-clad lady: "Ah! Thomas, you have named me wrongly. I am
the Queen of Fairyland, and have come to visit you."

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

"What seek you with me?" Thomas asked.

Said the Fairy Queen: "You must hasten at once to Fairyland, and serve
me there for seven years."

Then she laid a spell upon him, and he had to obey her will. She mounted
her milk-white steed and Thomas mounted behind her, and they rode off
together. They crossed the Leader Water, and the horse went swifter than
the wind over hill and dale until a great wide desert was reached. No
house nor human being could be seen anywhere. East and west, north and
south, the level desert stretched as far as eye could see. They rode on
and on until at length the Fairy Queen spoke, and said: "Dismount, O
Thomas, and I shall show you three wonders."

Thomas dismounted and the Fairy Queen dismounted also. Said she: "Look,
yonder is a narrow road full of thorns and briers. That is the path to
Heaven. Yonder is a broad highway which runs across a lily lea. That is
the path of wickedness. Yonder is another road. It twines round the
hill-side towards the west. That is the way to Fairyland, and you and I
must ride thither."

Again she mounted her milk-white steed and Thomas mounted behind. They
rode on and on, crossing many rivers. Nor sun or moon could be seen nor
any stars, and in the silence and thick

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

darkness they heard the deep voice of the roaring sea.

At length a light appeared in front of them, which grew larger and
brighter as they rode on. Then Thomas saw a beautiful country. The horse
halted and he found himself in the midst of a green garden. When they
had dismounted, the Fairy Queen plucked an apple and gave it to, Thomas,
saying: "This is your reward for coming with me. After you have eaten of
it you will have power to speak truly of coming events, and men will
know you as 'True Thomas'."

Thomas ate the apple and then followed the queen to her palace. He was
given clothing of green silk and shoes of green velvet, and he dwelt
among the fairies for seven years. The time passed so quickly that the
seven years seemed no longer than seven hours.

After his return to Ercildoune, where he lived in a castle, Thomas made
many songs and ballads and pronounced in rhyme many prophecies. He
travelled up and down the country, and wherever he went he foretold
events, some of which took place while yet he lived among men, but
others did not happen until long years afterwards. There are still some
prophecies which are as yet unfulfilled.

It is said that when Thomas was an old man the Fairy Queen returned for
him. One day, as

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

he stood chatting with knights and ladies, she rode from the river-side
and called: "True Thomas, your time has come."

Thomas cried to his friends: "Farewell, all of you, I shall return no
more." Then he mounted the milk-white steed behind the Fairy Queen, and
galloped across the ford. Several knights leapt into their saddles and
followed the Rider of the Shee, but when they reached the opposite bank
of the river they could see naught of Thomas and the Fairy Queen.

It is said that Thomas still dwells in Fairyland, and that he goes about
among the Riders of the Shee when they come forth at the beginning of
each summer. Those who have seen him ride past tell that he looks very
old, and that his hair and long beard are white as driven snow. At other
times he goes about invisible, except when he attends a market to buy
horses for a fairy army which is to take part in a great battle. He
drives the horses to Fairyland and keeps them there. When he has
collected a sufficient number, it is told, he will return again to wage
war against the invaders of his country, whom he will defeat on the
banks of the Clyde.

Thomas wanders far and wide through Scotland. He has been seen, folks
have told, riding out of a fairy dwelling below Eildon Hills, from
another fairy dwelling below Dumbuck Hill, near Dumbarton,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

and from a third fairy dwelling below the boat-shaped mound of
Tom-na-hurich at Inverness.

Once a man who climbed Dumbuck Hill came to an open door and entered
through it. In a dim chamber he saw a little old man resting on his
elbow, who spoke to him and said: "Has the time come?"

The man was stricken with fear and fled away. When he pressed through
the doorway, the door shut behind him, and turf closed over it.

Another story about Thomas is told at Inverness. Two fiddlers, named
Farquhar Grant and Thomas Cumming, natives of Strathspey, who lived over
three hundred years ago, once visited Inverness during the Christmas
season. They hoped to earn money by their music, and as soon as they
arrived in the town began to show their skill in the streets. Although
they had great fame as fiddlers in Strathspey, they found that the
townspeople took little notice of them. When night fell, they had not
collected enough money to buy food for supper and to pay for a night's
lodging. They stopped playing and went, with their fiddles under their
right arms, towards the wooden bridge that then crossed the River Ness.

Just as they were about to walk over the bridge they saw a little old
man coming towards them in the dusk. His beard was very long and very

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

white, but although his back was bent his step was easy and light. He
stopped in front of the fiddlers, and, much to their surprise, hailed
them by their names saying: "How fares it with you, my merry fiddlers?"

"Badly, badly!" answered Grant.

"Very badly indeed!" Cumming said.

"Come with me," said the old man. "I have need of fiddlers to-night, and
will reward you well. A great ball is to be held in my castle, and there
are no musicians."

Grant and Cumming were glad to get the chance of earning money by
playing their fiddles and said they would go. "Then follow me and make
haste," said the old man. The fiddlers followed him across the wooden
bridge and across the darkening moor beyond. He walked with rapid
strides, and sometimes the fiddlers had to break into a run to keep up
with him. Now and again that strange, nimble old man would turn round
and cry: "Are you coming, my merry fiddlers?"

"We are doing our best," Grant would answer, while Cumming muttered: "By
my faith, old man, but you walk quickly!"

"Make haste, Grant; make haste, Cumming, the old man would then exclaim;
"my guests will be growing impatient."

In time they reached the big boat-shaped

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

mound called Tom-na-hurich, and the old man began to climb it. The
fiddlers followed at a short distance. Then he stopped suddenly and
stamped the ground three times with his right foot. A door opened and a
bright light streamed forth.

"Here is my castle, Cumming; here is my castle, Grant," exclaimed the
old man, who was no other than Thomas the Rhymer. "Come within and make
merry."

The fiddlers paused for a moment at the open door, but Thomas the Rhymer
drew from his belt a purse of gold and made it jingle. "This purse holds
your wages," he told them. "First you will get your share of the feast,
then you will give us fine music."

As the fiddlers were as hungry as they were poor, they could not resist
the offer made to them, and entered the fairy castle. As soon as they
entered, the door was shut behind them.

They found themselves in a great hall, which was filled with brilliant
light. Tables were spread with all kinds of food, and guests sat round
them eating and chatting and laughing merrily.

Thomas led the fiddlers to a side table, and two graceful maidens clad
in green came forward with dishes of food and bottles of wine, and said:
"Eat and drink to your hearts' content, Farquhar Grant and Thomas
Cumming--Farquhar o'Feshie

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

and Thomas o' Tom-an-Torran. You are welcome here to-night."

The fiddlers wondered greatly that the maidens knew not only their
personal names but even the names of their homes. They began to eat,
and, no matter how much they ate, the food on the table did not seem to
grow less. They poured out wine, but they could not empty the bottles.

Said Cumming: "This is a feast indeed."

Said Grant: "There was never such a feast in Strathspey."

When the feast was ended the fiddlers were led to the ballroom, and
there they began to play merry music for the gayest and brightest and
happiest dancers they ever saw before. They played reels and jigs and
strathspeys, and yet never grew weary. The dancers praised their music,
and fair girls brought them fruit and wine at the end of each dance. If
the guests were happy, the musicians were happier still, and they were
sorry to find at length that the ball was coming to an end. How long it
had lasted they could not tell. When the dancers began to go away they
were still unwearied and willing to go on playing.

Thomas the Rhymer entered the ballroom, and spoke to the fiddlers,
saying: "You have done well, my merry men. I will lead you to the door,
and pay you for your fine music."

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

The fiddlers were sorry to go away. At the door Thomas the Rhymer
divided the purse of gold between them, and asked: "Are you satisfied?"

"Satisfied!" Cumming repeated. "Oh, yes, for you and your guests have
been very kind!"

"We should gladly come back again," Grant said.

When they had left the castle the fiddlers found that it was bright day.
The sun shone from an unclouded sky, and the air was warm. As they
walked on they were surprised to see fields of ripe corn, which was a
strange sight at the Christmas season. Then they came to the riverside,
and found instead of a wooden bridge a new stone bridge with seven
arches.

"This stone bridge was not here last night," Cumming said.

"Not that I saw," said Grant.

When they crossed the bridge they found that the town of Inverness had
changed greatly. Many new houses had been built; there were even new
streets. The people they saw moving about wore strange clothing. One
spoke to the fiddlers, and asked: "Who are you, and whence come you?"

They told him their names, and said that on the previous night they had
played their fiddles at a great ball in a castle near the town.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

The man smiled. Then Farquhar said: "The bridge we crossed over last
evening was made of wood. Now you have a bridge of stone. Have the
fairies built it for you?"

The man laughed, and exclaimed, as he turned away: "You are mad. The
stone bridge was built before I was born."

Boys began to collect round the fiddlers. They jeered at their clothing,
and cried: "Go back to the madhouse you have escaped from."

The fiddlers hastened out of the town, and took the road which leads to
Strathspey. Men who passed them stopped and looked back, but they spoke
to no one, and scarcely spoke, indeed, to one another.

Darkness came on, and they crept into an empty, half-ruined house by the
wayside and slept there. How long they slept they knew not, but when
they came out again they saw that the harvesting had begun. Fields were
partly cut, but no workers could be seen in them, although the sun was
already high in the heavens. They drank water from a well, and went on
their way, until at length they reached their native village. They
entered it joyfully, but were unable to find their homes. There, too,
new houses had been built, and strange faces were seen. They heard a
bell ringing, and then knew it was Sabbath day, and they walked towards
the church. A man

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

spoke to them near the gate of the churchyard and said: "You are
strangers here."

"No, indeed, we are not strangers," Grant assured him. "This is our
native village."

"You must have left it long ago," said the man, "for I have lived here
all my life, and I do not know you."

Then Grant told his name and that of his companion, and the names of
their fathers and mothers. "We are fine fiddlers," he added; "our equal
is not to be found north of the Grampians."

Said the man: "Ah! you are the two men my grandfather used to speak of.
He never saw you, but he heard his father tell that you had been decoyed
by Thomas the Rhymer, who took you to Tom-na-hurich. Your friends
mourned for you greatly, but now you are quite forgotten, for it is
fully a hundred years since you went away from here."

The fiddlers thought that the man was mocking them, and turned their
backs upon him. They went into the churchyard, and began to read the
names on the gravestones. They saw stones erected to their wives and
children, and to their children's children, and gazed on them with
amazement, taking no notice of the people who passed by to the church
door.

At length they entered the church hand in hand, with their fiddles under
their arms. They

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

stood for a brief space at the doorway, gazing at the congregation, but
were unable to recognize a single face among the people who looked round
at them.

The minister was in the pulpit. He had been told who the strangers were,
and, after gazing for a moment in silence, he began to pray. No sooner
did he do so than the two fiddlers crumbled into dust.

Such is the story of the two fiddlers who spent a hundred years in a
fairy dwelling, thinking they had played music there for but a single
night.
