# NOTES

The Irish text of the greater number of the hymns and legends in this
book has been published in the *Revue Celtique*, *Irische Texte,*
*Zeitschrift Celtische Phiologie*, *Eriu*, and elsewhere. From this text
I have worked, making my own translation as far as my scholarship goes,
and when it fails taking the meaning given by better scholars. *The Old
Woman of Beare* and the verses taken from the *Hymn of Marbhan* differ
very slightly from the translations published by Professor Kuno Meyer. I
and my readers are indebted to the work of Mr. Whitley Stokes,
especially in the *Voyage of Maeldune* (*Revue Celtique*) and the
*Ever-Living Tongue* (lately published in full in *Eriu*). and to Mr.
Standish Hayes O'Grady's inexhaustible *Silva Gaedelica*.

Among other Irish scholars and editors of texts to whom we owe thanks
are O'Curry, O'Donovan, Reeves, Todd, Henebry, O'Donoghue, O'Beirne
Crowe. Also to M. d'Arbois de Jubainville (Cycle Mythologique), Dr.
Atkinson, and Rev. Dr. Bernard (*Liber Hymnorum*), Mr. Edward Gwynn
(*The Priest and the Bees*), the Rev. M. O'Riordan (*Voyage of
Brendan*), and to

An Craoibhin.

I am grateful to these as well as to those men and women I have met in
workhouses or on roadsides or by the hearth, who have kept in mind
through many years the great wonders done among the children of the Gad.
