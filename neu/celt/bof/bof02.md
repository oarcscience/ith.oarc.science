Chapter Two

The Spirit of Man

 

> There is a remarkable Arabian story called *Hai Ebn Yokdhan*, written
> in Spain by Ebn Tophail. It is a philosophical romance, and relates
> how a child brought up by a nannygoat began to study the secrets of
> life. His nurse, the goat, died, and he wondered in what existed the
> spring of life, and he cut her open and searched the heart, where he
> found two compartments, one filled with coagulated blood, the other
> empty. From that he was led to search into what the vacant cavity once
> contained. He slew a goat, cut it open, and found in the vacant cavity
> a vaporous bluish flame--and that was Life.

> Life is light and fire. This idea must have entered into the minds of
> primitive people. To this day in Yorkshire falling stars are supposed
> to be the souls coming down from above to newborn children and
> animating them, and when death ensues the flame of life passes out of
> the body. This is the conception that lies at the root of many
> folk-superstitions.

> I knew a case in an adjoining parish, where there was a young man in a
> decline who had helped in the hay-harvest. He was dead before the next
> season. But I was assured that at haysel a flame was seen dancing
> about the meadow and running up to the hayrick; the haymakers had no
> doubt whatever that this was the spirit of the young man who had died
> in the previous year. In Wales the belief in corpse--lights is very
> prevalent. There it is a flame that comes from the churchyard to fetch
> the spirit of the dying man or woman. It is, in fact, the spirit of a
> relative come to call it.

> It is called the Canwyll Gorph, or Corpse Candle; and the saying is
> that St David promised to Welshmen in his territory that none should
> die without the premonitory sign of a light travelling to his house
> from the churchyard to summon him. In the *Cambrian Register* for 1796
> we read of--

> A very commonly received opinion, that within the diocese of St
> David's, a short space before death, a light is seen proceeding from
> the house, and sometimes, as has been asserted, from the very bed
> where the sick person lies, and pursues its way to the church where he
> or she is to be interred, precisely in the same track in which the
> funeral is afterwards to follow.

> In Devonshire it is supposed that this light is only seen when the
> moribund has children or relatives buried in the churchyard, and it is
> the souls of these that come to fetch their kinsman or kinswoman.

All under the stars, and beneath the green tree,  
All over the sward, and along the cold lea,  
A little blue flame a--fluttering came;  
It came from the churchyard for you or for me.

I sit by the cradle, my baby's asleep,  
And rocking the cradle, I wonder and weep.  
O little blue light in the dead of the night,  
O prithee, O prithee, no nearer to creep.

> Why follow the church-path, why steal you this way?  
> Why halt in your journey, on threshold why stay?  
> With flicker and flare, why dance up the stair?  
> O I would! O I would! it were dawning of day.

> All under the stars, and along the green lane,  
> Unslaked by the dew, and unquenched by the rain,  
> Of little flames blue to the churchyard steal two,  
> The soul of my baby! now from me is ta'an.

> Baxter, in his *Certainty of the World of Spirits*, quotes a letter
> from Mr John Davis of Gleneurglyn, 1656, in which he says that the
> corpse-candles do as much resemble material candle--light as eggs do
> eggs, saving that in their journey these candles are sometimes visible
> and sometimes disappear, especially if anyone comes nea them, or in
> any way meet them. On these occasions they vanish, but presently
> appear again. If a little candle is seen of a pale bluisih colour,
> then follows the corpse of an infant; if a larger one, then the corpse
> of some one come to age. If two candles come from different places and
> be seen to meet, the corpses will do the same; and if any of these
> candles be seen to turn aside through some bypath leading to the
> church, the following corpse will be found to take exactly the same
> way. The belief in Devonshire is very much the same as that in Wales,
> only it is held that no corpse-candle will come to fetch a soul unless
> there be a kinsman already interred in the churchyard That there may
> be an amount of gas that is luminous escaping from a tomb is possible
> enough. I had one night dining with me friend who is now a
> vice-principal of a college in Oxford. To reach his home he had to
> pass our churchyard, and he came back in terror as he had seen a blue
> light dancing above a grave. But that these flames should travel down
> roads and seek houses where there is on dying is, of course, an
> exaggeration and untenable.

> Baxter tells the story of what happened at Llangatten ir
> Carmarthenshire:--

> Some thirty or forty years since my wife's sister, being nurse to
> Bishop Rudd's three eldest children, the lady comptroller of the
> house, going late into the chamber where the maid-servants lay, saw no
> less than five of these lights together. It happened a while after
> that, the chamber being newly plaistered, and a grate of coal fire
> therein kindled to hasten the drying of the plaister, that five
> maid-servants went to bed as they were wont, but it fell out too soon,
> for in the morning they were all dead, being suffocated in their sleep
> with the steam of the new tempered lime and coal.

> Mrs Crowe, in her *Nightside of Nature*, tells a couple of stories
> which she heard from a "dignitary of the Church" born in Wales. A
> female relative of his started early in the morning, attended by her
> father's servant. When she had reached halfway, where she expected to
> meet the servant of the friend she was about to visit, she dismissed
> the man who had accompanied her so far. The fellow had not long left
> her before she saw a light approach her, moving about three feet above
> the soil. She turned her horse out of the bridle-road, along which it
> advanced, to allow it to pass, but to her dismay, just as it came
> opposite her, it halted and remained flickering before her for about
> half an hour, and only vanished as she heard steps of the servant's
> horse, as he trotted up to meet and conduct her to her friend. On
> reaching the house of her friend she related what she had seen. A few
> days later that very servant who had come to meet her sickened and
> died, and his body was carried along the road upon which the light had
> moved; and more curious still, owing to an accident, the coffin halted
> for an hour at the very spot where she had been delayed confronting
> the mysterious light. That light, we may be sure, was supposed to be
> the soul of a relative come from the grave to meet and welcome a
> kinsman. In no other way can it be explained.

> Another story is this: A servant in the family of Lady Davis, the aunt
> of the dignitary who told the above story to Mrs Crowe, had occasion
> to start early for market. Being in the kitchen at 3 a.m., taking his
> breakfast, when everyone else was in bed, he was surprised by the
> sound of feet trampling down the stairs; and opening the door, he saw
> a light. He was frightened and rushed out of the house, and presently
> saw a gleam pass out of the door and proceed towards the churchyard.
> As Lady Davis was ill at the time, he made no doubt that her death
> impended; and when he returned from market his first question was
> whether she were still alive; and though he was informed she was
> better, he declared his conviction that she would die, and described
> what he had seen and heard. The lady, however, recovered; but within a
> fortnight another member of the family died, and her coffin was
> conveyed by bearers down the stairs. One curious feature in the story
> is that the man had described how he had heard the sound of a bump
> against the clock on the stairs; and actually, as the coffin was being
> taken down, the bearers ran it violently against the clock--case.

> Mrs Crowe in the *Nightside of Nature*, tells a story narrated to her
> relative to Scotland, showing that the idea of corpse-candles is not
> confined to Wales. It was to this effect. A minister, newly inducted
> into his cure, was standing one evening leaning over the wall of the
> churchyard, which adjoined the manse, when he observed a light
> hovering over a particular spot. Supposing it was someone with a
> lantern, he opened the wicket and went forward to ascertain who it
> might be; but before he reached the spot the light moved onwards, and
> he followed, but could see nobody. It did not rise far above the
> ground, but advanced rapidly across the road, entered a wood, and
> ascended a hill till it at length disappeared at the door of a
> farmhouse. Unable to comprehend of what nature this light could be,
> the minister was deliberating whether to make inquiries at the house
> or return, when the light appeared again, accompanied by another,
> passed him, and going over the same ground, they both disappeared on
> the spot where he had first observed the phenomenon. He left a mark on
> the grave by which he might recognise it, and next day inquired of the
> sexton whose it was. The man said it belonged to a family that lived
> up the hill--indicating the house the light had stopped at--but that
> it was a considerable time since anyone had been buried there. The
> minister was extremely surprised to learn, in the course of the day,
> that a child of that family had died of scarlet fever on the preceding
> evening.

> Now, compare this story with that framed in the ballad of the *Little
> Blue Flame*, that contains a Devonshire tradition, and we find
> precisely the same phenomenon. A soul leaves the churchyard to fetch
> another of the family, and both appear as flames.

> The poet Pfeffel of Colmar was blind, and he employed as his
> amanuensis a young Evangelical pastor. Pfeffel, when he walked out,
> was supported and led by this young man, whose name was Billing. As
> they walked in the garden, at some distance from the town, Pfeffel
> observed that whenever they passed over a particular spot, the arm of
> Billing trembled and he betrayed uneasiness. On being questioned, the
> young man confessed, with some reluctance, that as often as he passed
> over that spot, certain feelings attacked him which he could not
> control, and that he always experienced the same in treading in a
> churchyard. He added that at night when he came near such places he
> saw luminous appearances. Pfeffel, with a view of curing the youth of
> what he regarded as a fancy, went that night with him to the garden.
> As they approached the spot Billing perceived a feeble light, and when
> still nearer he saw a luminous ghostlike figure wavering over the
> spot. This he described as a female form, with one arm laid across the
> body, the other hanging down, floating in an upright posture, but
> tranquil, the feet only a handbreadth or two above the soil. Pfeffel
> went alone, as the young man declined to follow him, up to the place
> where the figure was said to be, and struck about in all directions
> with his stick, besides running actually through the luminous
> appearance; but the figure was not more affected than a flame would
> have been. The matter got talked about, and a great number of people
> visited the spot; but it was not till some months later that any
> investigation was made. Then Pfeffel had the place dug up. At a
> considerable depth was found a firm layer of white lime of the length
> and breadth of a grave, and of considerable thickness. When this had
> been broken through there were found the bones of a human being. No
> tradition existed in the place to explain this burial, whether it had
> been a case of murder, or that the human being here buried had died of
> pestilence, none could tell--but it was abundantly clear that the
> burial had taken place at some considerable anterior period. The bones
> were removed, the pit filled up, the lime scattered abroad, and the
> surface again made smooth. When Billing was now brought back to the
> spot, the phenomenon did not return.

> It is possible, it is even probable, that the popular superstition
> relative to lights seen above graves is due to the discharge of
> phosphuretted hydrogen from a decaying corpse. I drove over one day
> with my brother to see a church, and before entering it he
> thoughtlessly threw his overcoat across a grave. On our return he
> fainted, being overcome by the smell that his coat had acquired. And
> this grave was not of recent making, but was at the least eight years
> old. It is possible enough that such exhalations should become
> luminous, and thus start the belief that is so general, and which has
> been expanded by imagination into the travelling of such lights to
> fetch others.

> What, we may ask, is the Will-o'-the wisp? Is it not the spirit of the
> man who has perished in a morass, dancing above where his body lies
> submerged? Some years ago a convict from Prince Town prison escaped.
> He was last seen flying over Foxtor Mire, and he never was seen again.
> Since then a blue flame has been observed occasionally hovering over
> the morass.

> When the poet wrote:

> Vital spark of heavenly flame,  
> Quit, O quit, this mortal frame,

> he uttered a sentiment expressive of the nature of the soul common to
> the many. None who have stood by a deathbed can fail to observe how
> closely the parting of soul and body, the light fading from the eyes,
> and warmth leaving the body, resembles the extinction of a fire.

> In Yorkshire, when a man is drowned, in order to find the place where
> the body is, a lighted candle is stuck in a loaf of bread which is
> committed to the water, and the light after a while floats above the
> spot where the corpse lies below the surface. When I was in Yorkshire
> in 1865 a man was drowned in the Calder Canal, and this method was
> adopted before dragging for the body. In this case the candle-flame
> represents the soul going in quest of its husk.

> In the legends of several of the Irish saints, the mother of one
> dreams that a spark has fallen into her mouth or her lap. It is the
> soul coming to her child. With this may be taken the Yorkshire notion
> of a falling star, already referred to.

> Repeatedly in the Icelandic sagas one reads of the haug-eldir,
> cairn-fires, flames that flicker and wave above tumuli covering dead
> warriors who have been buried with their treasures. These fires are
> none other than the spirits of the dead guarding their plunder. The
> Esquimaux suppose the Northern Lights to be the spirits dancing about
> the Polar Circle.

> There is at the present day, or was till recently, a morass near Stadr
> by Reykjanes in Iceland, where from the other side of the bay a
> wavering blue flame is seen, and it is supposed that a treasure lies
> sunken there; but the light is that of the spirit of him whose gold
> lies beneath the marsh.

> It was a belief among the German peasantry that the stars were human
> souls. When a child died its spirit was taken up to heaven and hung
> there as a star, but unbaptized children's souls became
> wills-o'-the-wisp. So also those of men who have moved their
> neighbours' landmarks. Above graves blue flames are seen to dance.
> Even unborn children are luminous, and this has been the occasion of
> many horrible murders of women expecting to become mothers, by men who
> desired to get hold of a hand of such an unborn, unbaptized child, by
> means of which they believed themselves able to send to sleep all in a
> house into which they entered for the purpose of robbery. We are
> distinctly told that it was the luminous character of the unborn that
> gave them this value.

> A curious story is told in a letter from a German pastor in Elsass to
> the editor of *Magikon* (iv. p.349). He had gone to Freiburg and was
> on his way home by night, and early in the morning, at 4 a.m., reached
> the first outlying houses of his village. The moon was in its last
> quarter, not a soul was stirring, when, in the road at about twenty or
> thirty paces from him, he saw a ball of fire burning in the middle of
> the way. The light given Out was pale like that of spirits of wine. He
> halted and looked at it for some moments and then went forward, when
> the ball of fire rose with undiminished brightness to the height of
> about twenty feet from the ground and went to the graveyard, where it
> descended again and vanished among the graves. There was no trace of
> fire or ashes on the highway where the fire had been first seen. The
> pastor, whose name was J.I. Schneider, wrote that he, along with his
> children, had seen the same apparition a second time.

> But it is not only as a flame that the soul is conceived to appear; it
> is supposed to remain with the body. In the year 1832 my grandfather
> renovated Lew Trenchard Church. He swept away the rood-screen and the
> carved oak benches and repewed the church. The carpenter employed
> opened the vault of old Madame Gould, the grandmother of my
> grandfather. She had been a notable woman, and he thought he would
> like to see her. It was night, and he had his lantern. I tell the tale
> as he told it me. When he opened her coffin she sat up, and a light
> streamed from her above that of his lantern. He was so panic--stricken
> that he fled the church, and ran home a distance of a quarter of a
> mile. And as he told me, she followed him, and he knew that, because
> his shadow went before him the whole way. Arrived at his home, he
> dashed in and jumped into the bed beside his wife, who was ill, and
> both saw Madame standing before them, with a light shining about her,
> which gradually faded. He told me this story himself, with all the
> sincerity of a man who is speaking the truth. Next day he found his
> extinguished lantern where he had left it.

> There are certain manifestations that may have helped on the popular
> superstition as to the soul being a fire, that may as well be
> mentioned. I cannot doubt myself that on occasions preceding death
> there is a luminosity apparent, as though the departing soul were
> shining through the body, as a candle does through the sides of the
> lantern. Sir H. Marsh, a London physician, writing in the Medical
> Gazette in 1842, gives an account of such an appearance that he had
> himself observed attentively.

> But the soul has also been thought to take an animal shape. Guntram,
> the Frank king, was out hunting one day, as Paulus Diaconus tells us,
> when, feeling tired, he lay down under a tree to sleep. The squire,
> whilst guarding his royal master, with surprise saw a serpent emerge
> from the king's mouth and glide down to a rivulet hard by and seek to
> cross the water, but was unable to do so. Thereupon the squire,
> determined to see the end of the adventure, drew his sword and laid it
> over the stream from bank to bank. The serpent, seeing this improvised
> bridge, wriggled across and disappeared down a small hole at the foot
> of a hill on the opposite side. After remaining there for a while it
> returned along the sword and into the king's mouth. Soon after,
> Guntram, awakening, said that he had just had a most extraordinary
> dream, in which he thought that he had crossed a torrent on a bridge
> of steel, and entered a subterranean palace full of gold and jewels.
> The squire then relating what he had seen, Guntram set a number of men
> to work, the hill was undermined, and the treasure discovered.
> Thenceforth that hill bore the name of Mont-Trésor.

> Helinand in his Chronicle tells a similar story. Henry, Archbishop of
> Rheims, and brother of King Louis, was travelling one summer with his
> retinue, and halted in the middle of the day for a rest. The
> Archbishop and some of his attendants went to sleep in the grass, but
> others kept awake, and these latter saw a little white animal like a
> weasel issue from the mouth of one of the sleepers and run down to a
> brook and try to cross it. Then the story goes on like that of
> Guntram, but without the discovery of treasure. When the man awoke and
> was asked about what he had dreamt, he said that he had been a long
> journey and in it he had twice crossed a bridge of steel. Hugh Miller,
> in My Schools and Schoolmasters, when writing about a cousin named
> George, says:--

> He communicated to me a tradition illustrative of the Celtic theory of
> dreaming, of which I have since often thought. Two young men had been
> spending the early portion of a warm summer day in exactly such a
> scene as that in which he communicated to me the anecdote. There was
> an ancient ruin beside them, separated, however, from the mossy bank
> on which they sat by a slender runnel, across which lay, immediately
> over a miniature cascade, a few withered grass-stalks. Overcome by the
> heat of the day, one of the young men fell asleep; his companion
> watched drowsily beside him, when all at once the watcher was aroused
> to attention by seeing a little, indistinct form, scarcely larger than
> a humble-bee, issue from the mouth of the sleeping man and, leaping
> upon the moss, move downwards to the runnel, which it crossed along
> the withered grass-stalks, and then disappeared amid the interstices
> of the ruin. Alarmed by what he saw, the watcher hastily shook his
> companion by the shoulder, and awoke him; though, with all his haste,
> the little cloud-like creature, still more rapid in its movements,
> issued from the interstice into which it had gone, and flying across
> the runnel, instead of creeping along the grass-stalks and over the
> sward, as before, it re-entered the mouth of the sleeper just as he
> was in the act of awakening. "What is the matter with you?" said the
> watcher, greatly alarmed; "what ails you?" "Nothing ails me," replied
> the other; "but you have robbed me of a most delightful dream. I
> dreamt that I was walking through a fine, rich country, and came at
> length to the shores of a noble river; and just where the clear water
> went thundering down a precipice there was a bridge all of silver,
> which I crossed; and then, entering a noble palace on the opposite
> side, I saw great heaps of gold and jewels; and I was just going to
> load myself with treasure, when you rudely awoke me, and I lost all."

> I have little doubt that what Cousin George saw was a humble-bee
> issuing from the mouth of the sleeper, for this is the form the soul
> is not infrequently supposed to wear. \[a\]

> These three stories are curious, as they represent a premonition of
> the final departure of the soul, which, according to a belief alluded
> to by Sir Walter Scott, after departing from the body has to pass over
> "the brig of Dread, no broader than a thread." If it falls off it is
> forever lost; if, however, it attains the other side of the gulf, it
> enters into the heavenly palace.

> My great-great-grandmother after departing this life was rather a
> trouble in the place. She appeared principally to drive back
> depredators on the orchard or the corn-ricks. So seven parsons were
> summoned to lay her ghost. They met under an oak-tree that still
> thrives. But one of them was drunk and forgot the proper words, and
> all they could do was to ban her into the form of a white owl. The owl
> used to sway like a pendulum in front of Lew House every night till,
> in an evil hour, my brother shot her. Since then she had not been
> seen. But here again we have the Celtic idea of metempsychosis.

> There is a ballad sung by the English peasantry that has been picked
> up by collectors in Kent, Somerset and Devon. It is entitled At the
> Setting of the Sun, and begins thus:--

> Come all you young fellows that carry a gun,  
> Beware of late shooting when daylight is done;  
> For 'tis little you reckon what hazards you run,  
> I shot my true love at the setting of the sun.

> In a shower of rain, as my darling did hie  
> All under the bushes to keep herself dry,  
> With her head in her apron, I thought her a swan,  
> And I shot my true love at the setting of the sun.

> In the Devonshire version of the story:--

> In the night the fair maid as a white swan appears;  
> She says, O my true love, quick, dry up your tears,  
> I freely forgive you, I have Paradise won;  
> I was shot by my true love at the setting of the sun.

> But in the Somerset version the young man is had up before the
> magistrates and tried for his life.

> In six weeks' time, when the 'sizes came on,  
> Young Polly appeared in the form of a swan,  
> Crying, Jimmy, young Jimmy, young Jimmy is clear;  
> He never shall be hung for the shooting of his dear.

> And he is, of course, acquitted.

> The transformation of the damsel into a swan stalking into the Court
> and proclaiming the innocence of her lover is unquestionably the
> earlier form of the ballad; the Devonshire version is a later
> rationalising of the incident. Now, in neither form is the ballad very
> ancient; and in the passage of the girl's soul into a swan we can see
> bow that among our peasantry to a late period the notion of
> trans-migration has survived.

> I was visiting an old woman who was bedridden when one day she said to
> me: "I saw my brother last night; he came flapping his wings against
> the window." I stared, and asked for an explanation. Her brother had
> died some time previously. "He came as a great black bird, like a rook
> but larger, and he kept beating against the glass. He is come to call
> me." I endeavoured to give a natural explanation of the phenomenon,
> but she would not hear of that. She knew it was her brother by the
> tone of the voice. "Beside, he warn't an over good man, and so he
> wouldn't go into a white bird. It was my brother and no mistake."

> The Oxenham omen of the bird that appears before a death in the family
> is another instance, for the bird is probably supposed to be the
> spirit reincarnate of an ancestor.

> That the soul is on its travels when any person is dreaming, or in a
> faint, or a cataleptic fit, is generally believed, and the various
> revelations or visions of heaven and Purgatory and Hell that have been
> given to the world, from early times down to Dante's *Divina
> Commedia*, derive therefrom.

> A curious story was told by Mr John Holloway, of the Bank of England,
> brother of the engraver of that name. He related how that being one
> night in bed with his wife, and unable to sleep, he had fixed his eyes
> and thoughts with uncommon intensity on a beautiful star that was
> shining in at the window, when he suddenly found his spirit released
> from his body and soaring into that bright sphere. But, seized with
> anxiety for the anguish of his wife if she discovered his body
> apparently dead beside her, he returned and re-entered it with
> difficulty.

> He described that returning as distressful, like coming back to
> darkness; and that whilst the spirit was free he was alternately in
> the light or the dark, according as his thoughts were with the star or
> with his wife. Alter this experience, he said that he always avoided
> anything that could produce a repetition, the consequences of it being
> very distressing.

> A citizen of Bremen had observed for some time that about the hour of
> midnight his wife ceased to breathe, and lay motionless like a corpse,
> with her mouth open. He had heard it said that souls could leave the
> body and go on their wanderings, and returned through the mouth. He
> could hardly believe it, but he resolved on trying the experiment on
> his wife; so he turned her body over when she was in this condition,
> with her face buried in the pillow. Then he went quietly to sleep, but
> on awakening next morning he found his wife in the position in which
> he had placed her, stone dead.

> The conception of the soul passing into an animal form is distinctly
> Aryan. It is the basis of the Brahmin philosophy. The Celts, and after
> that the Teutons, brought with them from the East the belief in
> metempsychosis; but of this more in the next chapter.
