Chapter Four

The Ancient Divinities

 

> We cannot expect to find reminiscences of the gods and goddesses of
> the primitive Silurian or Ivernian race that peopled Great Britain and
> Ireland, or even of the Celtic and Roman divinities, save in a most
> attenuated form. Even the saints of the Catholic Church who filled the
> religious horizon in England and Scotland for a thousand years have
> faded from it. But we will endeavour to discover some traces, and some
> do remain

> The prehistoric rude-stone building race certainly did have a goddess
> of Death, and probably one of Generation. In the subterranean
> excavations made in Le Petit Mona, by the Baron de Baye, the
> necropolises were guarded by rude figures representing a female cut in
> the chalk, and also by a representation of a stone hammer. The female
> figure has also been found cut on limestone in the department of Gard,
> on dolmens. In Brittany, in the covered alleys, there are numerous
> figures of stone axes or hammers, and also a curious shield-like
> representation that may possibly take the place of the female figure
> found in the chalk tombs, but which it was difficult to execute in
> granite. On one of the slabs of a dolmen, near Loudun, that I
> examined, was cut a celt, and a cdt is also cut on the huge upper
> stone or table of the famous dolmen of Confolens. In Brittany, where
> the incoming Celts from Wales and Cornwall overflowed the land and
> submerged the earlier peoples, these former have been largely
> influenced by the people they treated as belonging to a lower stratum
> of civilisation.

> Here the cult of Death has acquired extraordinary importance, and M.
> Anatole Ie Braz, a Breton folklorist, has written a treatise on it,
> and collected the stories he has heard relative to it. In Leon Death
> may be said to reign in undivided supremacy and tinctures all
> existence, every amusement, every occupation. La Mont is in Breton the
> Ankou, who travels about the country in a cart picking up souls.

> At night a wain is heard coming along the road with a creaking axle.
> It halts at a door, and that is the summons. A spirit passes, and the
> Ankou moves on. Marillier, who wrote a preface to M. le Braz's work,
> says that Lower Brittany is before all else the Land of the Dead.
> "Souls do not remain enclosed in the tombs, they wander at night on
> the high-roads and in the lonely lanes. They haunt the fields and the
> moors, thick as blades of grass or as grains of sand on the shore.
> They revisit their former habitations in the silence of the night, and
> from the *lis-clos* they can be observed crouched around the hearth,
> where the brands are expiring." Certain mysterious rites are observed
> to which the curé is not invited, and where some old man is
> ministrant, on All Souls' even, on some granite-strewn height, about a
> fire. M. le Curé is discreet enough not to enquire too closely what
> goes on.

> The wagon of the Ankou is like the death-coach that one hears of in
> Devon and in Wales. It is all black, with black horses drawing it,
> driven by a headless coachman. A black hound runs before it, and
> within sits a lady--in the neighbourhood of Okehampton and Tavistock
> she is supposed to be a certain Lady Howard, but she is assuredly an
> impersonification of Death, for the coach halts to pick up the spirits
> of the dying.

> Now pray step in! my lady saith;  
> Now pray step in and ride.  
> I thank thee, I had rather walk  
> Than gather to thy side.  
> The wheels go round without a sound  
> Or tramp or turn of wheels.  
> As cloud at night, in pale moonlight,  
> Along the carriage steals.

> I'd rather walk a hundred miles  
> And run by night and day,  
> Than have that carriage halt for me,  
> And hear my lady say--  
> Now pray step in, and make no din,  
> Step in with me to ride;  
> There's room, I trow, by me for you,  
> And all the world beside.

> Of course the notion of the death-coach is comparatively modern. It is
> an expansion of the ancient idea of Death coming to fetch the
> departing soul. Presumably the earlier idea was of a bier. There is a
> remarkable account in Mrs Henry Wood's novel of *The Shadow of
> Ashlydiat* that gives us a notion of what the earlier superstition
> was. She is very emphatic over it that it is a real fact, and a fact
> of which she herself was witness.

> Opposite to the ash trees on the estate of Ashlydiat there extended a
> waste plain, totally out of keeping with the high cultivation around.
> It looked like a piece of rude common. Bushes of furze, broom and
> other stunted shrubs grew upon it. At the extremity, opposite to the
> ash trees, there arose a high archway, a bridge built of grey stones.
> Beyond the archway was a low round building, looking like an isolated
> windmill without sails.

> Strange to say, the appellation of this waste piece of land, with its
> wild bushes, was the "Dark Plain". Why? The plain was not dark; it was
> not shrouded; it stood out, broad and open, in the full glare of
> sunlight. That certain dark tales had been handed down with the
> appellation is true; and these may have given rise to the name.
> Immediately before the archway, for some considerable space, the
> ground was entirely bare. Not a blade of grass, not a shrub grew on
> it--or, as the story went, would grow. It was on this spot that the
> appearance, the Shadow, would sometimes be seen. Whence the Shadow
> came, whether it was ghostly or earthly, whether those learned in
> science could account for it by Nature's laws, I am unable to say. If
> you ask me to explain it, I cannot. If you ask me, why then do I write
> about it, I can only answer, because I have sat and seen it. I have
> seen it with my own unprejudiced eyes; I have sat and watched it, in
> its strange stillness; I have looked about and around it--low down,
> high up--for some substance ever so infinitesimal that might cast its
> shade and enable me to account for it; and I have looked in vain. Had
> the moon been behind the archway, instead of behind me, that might
> have furnished a loophole of explanation.

> No; there was nothing whatever, so far as human eyes--and I can tell
> you that keen ones and sceptical ones have looked at it--to cast the
> shade, or to account for it. There, as you sat and watched, stretched
> out the plain, in the moonlight, with its low, trunklike bushes, its
> clear space of bare land, the archway rising beyond it. But on the
> spot of bare land, before the archway, would rise the Shadow, not
> looking as if it were a Shadow cast on the ground, but a palpable
> fact; as if a bier, with its two bending mourners, actually stood
> there in the substance. I say that I cannot explain it, or attempt to
> explain it; but I do say that there is it to be seen. Not often;
> sometimes not for years together. It is called the Shadow of
> Ashlydiat; and superstition told that its appearance foreshadowed the
> approach of calamity, whether of death or of other evil, to the
> Godolphins. The greater the evil that was coming upon them, the
> plainer and more distinct would be the appearance of the Shadow.
> Rumour went that once, on the approach of some terrible misfortune, it
> had been seen for months and months before, whenever the moon was
> sufficiently bright.

> I have quoted this at length, as it comes from Worcestershire, on the
> borders of Wales; and as it presents an earlier phase of the
> superstition than that of the death-coach.

> There are stories in Henderson's *Northern Folklore* of coaches with
> headless horsemen, but I lay no stress on them, as these are evidently
> late developments of an ancient belief that Death, the Ankou, went
> about picking up souls as they departed.

> To turn now to the celt or hammer figured on the graves of prehistoric
> peoples.

> Both Strabo and Herodotus speak of peoples in Asia who, when their
> parents grew aged and useless, killed them. This was absolutely averse
> from the customs of the Aryans, who made the family and the clan a
> sacred centre. But it was quite possible with the non-Aryan natives
> before Britain was invaded by the Celts.! Aubrey has preserved an
> account of how in churches hung behind. the door "the holy mawle",
> with which sons might knock on the\~ head their parents when they
> became effete and of no more use; and; in a prose romance, Sir
> Percival congratulates himself that he is no in Wales, where sons pull
> their fathers out of bed and kill them. A Count Schalenberg rescued an
> old man who was being beaten to death by his sons, in Prussia, and a
> Countess Mansfield in the 14t century saved another in similar
> circumstances.

> Now, this holy mawle, I take it, is no other than the celt or hammer
> that is figured on the dolmens and tombs of the prehistoric underlying
> population of Gaul and Britain. The Aryans would never have thought of
> putting their parents to death, though the parents might think it time
> to precipitate themselves down the aeternis stapi when provisions ran
> short. But that was a different matter. Suicide among the Norsemen was
> a self-sacrifice to Odin, and parent murder was never compulsory on
> the children.

> Passing from the cult of the goddess of death, we come to that of the
> deity of life. I have at a rifle-shot from my own house a menhir, with
> a hollow cup in its top. The farmers were wont to drive their cows
> under it, and let the water from this cup dribble over their backs,
> under the impression that it would increase their yield of milk. My
> grandfather was so annoyed at this that he threw it down and buried
> it. I have dug it up and re-erected it, but the old superstition
> connected with it is dead.

> In Brittany are monoliths about which women dance in a state of
> nudity, and rub themselves against them in hopes of thereby becoming
> mothers. Near Dinan is the stone of St Samson. Girls slide down it, as
> it is on an incline, and if they can reach the bottom without a hitch,
> they believe that they will be happy mothers when married.

> Some of these stones are pitted with artificially cut hollows. The
> stones are washed, to produce rain, are anointed, and the cup-marks
> filled with butter and honey. Most in France are now surmounted with
> crucifixes, or have a niche cut in their faces into which an image of
> the Virgin is inserted. One in Brittany, at Tregastel, has carved on
> it and painted a crucifix and the instruments of the passion. Such are
> all the deities that we can safely say were culted by the prehistoric
> race that lies below the peoples that successively overlaid them, of
> which any trace remains in modern folklore.

> We come next to Aryan folklore, and to that in which there is Some
> reminiscence of the gods our ancestors once worshipped. It is
> remarkable that two common names for the devil should enshrine those
> of ancient deities, one Celtic and the other Teutonic or Norse.

> These are "The Deuce" and "Old Nick".

> We learn from St Augustine that the Gauls believed in "certain demons
> they called Duses," and Isidore of Seville describes them as hairy.
> The word implies something higher than a mere satyr, for its
> equivalents are the Greek *Theos* and *Zeus*, the Latin Deus, the
> Sanskrit *Djous*, the Anglo-Saxon *Tiu* from whom we get the name of
> the third day of the week, Tuesday. The corresponding god among the
> Germans was Zio, and among the Norsemen Tyr.

> "As for the gods of the heathen they are but devils," said the
> psalmist, and in this light did the Christian fathers and priests
> regard the gods. They were cast down from their thrones and treated as
> demons who had hitherto beguiled the heathen. Thus Tiu, or the Deuce,
> from being the god of the firmament and clear sky became a black
> devil, with the legs crooked as those of a goat.

> There is a great cliff of granite rising precipitately above the River
> Plym that debouches at Plymouth, which goes by the name of the
> Dewerstone, or the rock of Tiu or of Tyr. On the top of this crag the
> Wild Huntsman is said to be frequently seen along with his
> fire-breathing Wish-hounds, and his horn is heard ringing afar over
> the moors, and as he chases the yelping of his hounds may be heard. He
> hunts human souls. Two old ladies who lived at Shaw, near by, assured
> me they had often heard his horn and the yelping of the pack. A farmer
> was riding at night over Dartmoor when there came up alongside of him
> a mysterious hunter with his hounds running before him. The farmer,
> who had been drinking at the Saracen's Head Inn at Two Bridges,
> shouted, "Had good luck--much sport? Give me a hare." "Take it,"
> replied the hunter, and flung something to the\~\~ fanner, who caught
> it and held it before him to see what had been cast him. Half an hour
> later he arrived at his house, and shouted for'; a servant to bring
> out a lantern and hold his horse. When a man arrived, "Give me the
> lantern," said he, "and let me see what I have; got." He was obeyed,
> and the farmer raising the light saw on his, other arm his own child
> dead. At the same moment it vanished. As in great consternation he was
> dismounting, the servant said to him: "Sorry to have to tell you,
> farmer, but your poor little boy is dead.",

> "Sorry to have to tell you, farmer, but your poor little boy is dead."
> Children who die un-baptised join the hunt. Once two children were on
> a moor together; one slept, the other was awake. Suddenly the Wild
> Hunt went by. A voice called, "Shall we take it?" The answer came,
> "No, it will come of itself shortly." Next day the sleeper was dead.

> Gervase of Tilbury says that in the thirteenth century, by full moon
> towards evening, the Wild Hunt was frequently seen in England,
> traversing forest and down. In the twelfth century it was called in
> England the Harlething. It appeared in the reign of Henry II, and was
> witnessed by many. At the head of the troop rode the British king
> Herla. He had been at the marriage-feast of a dwarf in a mountain. As
> he left the bridal hall, the host presented him with horses, hounds,
> and horn; also with a bloodhound, which was set on the saddle--bow
> before the King, and the troop was bidden not to dismount till the dog
> leaped down. On returning to his palace, the King learned that he had
> been absent two hundred years, which had passed as one night whilst he
> was in the mountains with the dwarf. Some of the retainers jumped off
> their horses, and fell to dust, but the King and the rest ride on till
> the bloodhound bounds from the saddle, which will be the Last Day.

> Herla is, of course, the same as the German Erl-King, and the name has
> gone into a strange commutation as Harlequin, the magician who
> performs wonders with his bat at Christmas.

> Belief in the Wild Hunt is general throughout Northern Europe, alike
> among Celtic and Teutonic peoples, because what has originated the
> superstition is a simple natural fact that has been wrongly explained.
> On the approach of winter flights of bean-geese come south from
> Scotland and the Isles, Iceland, and Scandinavia. They choose dark
> nights for their migrations, and utter a loud and very peculiar cry. A
> gentleman was riding alone near the Land's End on a still dark night,
> when the yelping cry broke out above his head So suddenly, and to all
> appearance so near, that he instinctively pulled up his horse as if to
> allow the pack to pass, the animal trembling violently at the
> unexpected sounds.

> In Durham the Wild Hunt goes by the name of the Gabriel Hounds, and in
> Yorkshire it is the "Gabble retchit". I cannot explain the derivation.
> We may, I think, see in the wild huntsmen either the Teutonic god Tiu
> or Tyr, or else the Celtic Duse. "Old Nick" is none other than Woden,
> the chief god of our Anglo-Saxon forefathers, who has bequeathed to us
> the name of Wednesday. He was also called Hnikare or Nikarr. In Norway
> he has been degraded into a water-sprite of *Nix*.

> Thor the Thunderer has left us his name in Thursday. According to
> Scandinavian belief he is red-bearded, and his hammer that he flings
> is the thunderbolt. A gentleman wrote to me in 1890:--

>  

> It was in the autumn of 1857 or 1858 that I had taken some

> quinine to a lad who lived with his old grandmother. On my next visit
> the old dame scornfully refused another bottle, and said she "knowed
> on a soight better cure for the ague than yon mucky stuff". With that
> she took me round to the bottom of the bed and showed me three
> horseshoes nailed there with a hammer placed crosswise upon them. On
> my expressing incredulity, she waxed wroth, and said: "Naay, lad, it's
> a chawm. I tak's t' mell (hammer) i' moy left haun and I mashys they
> shoon throice, and Oi sez, sez Oi:--

> Feyther, Son, an' Holy Ghoast,  
> Naale the divil to this poast!

> Won for God an' won for Wod, an' one for

> Theen, laad, whin the old un comes to shak him he wean't nivver git
> past you; you'ull fin' him saafe as t church steeple."

> Could there be confusion worse confounded than this? The Holy Trinity
> invoked, and in the same breath God, Woden, and Loki--the very spirit
> of evil; and the Holy Crook and Thor's hammer treated as one and the
> same thing.

> Yours faithfully,

> Clearly here God takes the place of Thor; and the Triad--Thor, Woden
> and Loki--are equal with the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

> Another interesting feature in this charm is that the ague is
> impersonated as an evil sprite, against whom the incantation is
> launched.

> There is a shallow river, the Wulf, that runs through the parish of
> Broadwood Widger, in Devon. It discharges into the Thrustle, thence
> into the Lyd, and so into the Tamar. The Wuif is liable to sudden
> rises, and then becomes impassable, and was so till the County Council
> built a bridge. Previously one going to Broadwood, or leaving it to go
> east, was constrained to traverse a ford. Now it was believed, before
> the bridge was built, that there was a spirit of gigantic size who
> waited at the ford to carry foot-passengers over, and there is a woman
> still alive who insists she was so conveyed across. That this belief
> owes something to a picture of a gigantic St Christopher that may have
> been in the church, but of which no traces now remain, is possible
> enough; that fresco, if it ever existed, did not, in my opinion,
> originate the conviction. The bearer across the stream is in all
> probability some ancient god, not happily in this case turned into a
> devil. Now I am convinced that this giant who wades through the river
> is none other than Thor, for in Norse story he is constantly
> represented as wading through the waters, above all the great river
> that flows round the terrestrial globe. In the Younger Edda is the
> story of the battle between Thor and the giant Hrungnir. The latter
> fought with a stone club, which he flung at the Red-beard, who at the
> same moment cast his hammer. The two missiles met in mid air and the
> club flew in pieces, one struck Thor on the head and sank in. After
> Hrungnir had been killed, Thor went to visit the prophetess Groa, the
> wife of Oervandil, to have the stone extracted. She began her
> incantations, and Thor beginning to feel relief, in gratitude told her
> how that he had carried her husband over the River Elivagar, the great
> ice-stream that separates the realm of the giants from that of gods
> and men. Oervandil was conveyed across in a basket on his back whilst
> Thor waded across. Unhappily One toe of Oervandil protruded and got
> frostbitten, whereupon Thor cut it off and threw it up into heaven
> where it became a star. In the story of Hymir also Thor is represented
> as a wading god. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that St
> Christopher in Scandinavian lands, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, has
> stepped into the place and assumed the attributes of Thor.

> Friday takes its name from Fri or Frija the goddess, the wife of
> Woden, the mother-goddess, as also goddess of tillage. She has been
> represented as holding a plough drawn by young children, as she
> gathers to her the spirits of those who die in infancy. To a certain
> extent she is the goddess of love, and so is equated with Venus, who
> has given her name to Vendredi.

> Plough Monday is a festival of the past. It took place on the first
> Monday after the Epiphany, when a plough was decorated, and ploughmen
> were disguised and wore white smocks; there was a piper, and one
> dressed in fur with a fox's skin drawn over his head. The whole party
> was led by one Bessy, who went about collecting contributions. Bessy
> took the place of FrI, and the man in skins represented Woden, who was
> her husband. So much we may conjecture, but we have no certain
> evidence to establish this.

> Fri or Frija appears however again and again as the White Lady. And
> here I will mention a circumstance that to my mind seems conclusive.

> On 28th April 1795, a young man whose relative lived in this parish
> was returning home after having been some years in America. He hired a
> horse in Tavistock and rode to Lew Trenchard. It was a clear moonlight
> night, and as he rode through Lew valley, he looked into a newly
> ploughed field, in which a plough had been left. On this was seated a
> lady in white satin, with long hair floating over her shoulders. Her
> face was uplifted and her eyes directed towards the moon, so that he
> had a full view of it. He recognised her at once as Madame Gould, and
> taking off his hat called out, "I wish you a very good night, Madame."
> She bowed in return and waved her hand. The man noticed the sparkle of
> her diamond rings as she did so,. On reaching his home, after the
> first greetings and congratulations, he said to his relatives, "What
> do you think? I have seen the strange Madame Gould sitting on a
> plough, this time of night, looking at the moon."

> All who heard it stared, and a blank expression passed over their
> countenances. "Madame," said they, "was buried seven days ago in Lew
> Church."

> On that night, 28th April, the moon was seven days old and it set at
> 1.35a.m. next day, approximately. Now the remarkable point in this
> story, which I heard from the family, is that Madame was seated on a
> plough; and the plough was the symbol of Fri.

> For my own part, I believe that the tradition of a White Lady was
> older than Madame. It attached itself first to a certain Susanna
> Gould, who was married in 1729 to Peter, son of John Truscott, rector
> of Lew Trenchard. Her father and the rector had never been on good
> terms, and her father resented the marriage. However, it took place,
> and she died on her way back from church, in her white wedding
> garments, and was buried four days later.

> Such a striking event naturally provoked attention, and the earlier
> tradition of a White Lady at once adhered to her, and clung to her
> till some sixty-six years later, when it became detached, and attached
> itself to another notable lady of the same family.

> I have troubled the reader with this story only because I think the
> incident of sitting on the plough is important as connecting the White
> Lady of Lew Trenchard with Fri, the Anglo-Saxon goddess.

> To the north of us, but still in the parish, is a deep and sombre
> valley, through which gurgles a small stream. The road to Bratton
> Clovelly descends into it; by the roadside was a cave, that has now
> been blocked. It was a common tradition that the White Lady was wont
> to be seen by night beside the stream, combing her long hair with a
> silver comb, and scooping up water in the hollow of her hand, pouring
> it over her head, and it fell down in drops of pearl. The comb and the
> falling drops are all tokens that this White Lady was no other than
> Fri.

> If I were to give all the stories of White Ladies that exist, I would
> fill a thick volume; but they all derive from the one source
> indicated. The White Lady, as in the case of the Hohenzollerns, is a
> death-token, because Frija is a death--goddess, to whom go the souls
> of the departed. A woman was once gathering sticks near one of the
> castles of the Hohenzollems, named Schalksburg, when she missed her
> little son. After long search she found him and rebukec him for
> straying. "Do not scold, mother," said he; "a beautiful lady in white
> took me on her arm, and she gave me this wild rose." He showed his
> mother a pink dog--rose. She took the child home, and put the flower
> in water. After three days the rose withered, and with its withering
> the little boy was dead.

> Saturday is the only day of the week that may take its name from a
> classic deity. In Italian it is *Sabbato*, *Samedi* in French,
> *Sabado* in Spanish and Portuguese, *Samstag* in German, formed out of
> the Latin *Sabbatum*; and this is from the Hebrew describing the day
> as one of rest. But the last day of the week among some Teutonic races
> has not been named after the Sabbath, but after a heathen deity. In
> Westphalia it is *Saterdsas, Sâtersday* in Anglo-Saxon, *Saturdag* in
> the Netherlands. Probably Saturn was taken as the equivalent of the
> Norse God Sutur, the black or seventh, not because evil, but as
> closing the age of the world. He seems to have left no traces in
> folklore, unless that he be identified with the Devil. But "Old
> Scratch" is one of the names by which the Evil One was designated, and
> which exactly agreed with the popular imagination of the appearance of
> Satan when he chose to show himself. For Skrati was the hairy wood
> faun of our forefathers, and resembled the satyr of the Romans,
> horned, and with legs like a goat's, and the lower portion of the body
> covered with hair. The name is found not only in English, Anglo-Saxon,
> Old German, and Norse, but also among the Sclavonic peoples, the
> Bohemians, the Poles, and the Slavonians. Grimm could find no root for
> the name in the German vocabulary; but in Slavonic, *skryto* signifies
> to hide or keep in concealment, and this would well explain the
> characteristic of the satyr hiding in the woods and but rarely seen.

> In an early version of the Psalms, in the place of the words "from the
> pestilence that walketh in darkness," in the 91st Psalm, we have "from
> the Bug that walketh in darkness." "A Bug," says Bayle, in his English
> Dictionary of 1755, is "an imaginary monster to frighten children
> with."

> Each trembling leaf and whistling wind they hear,  
> As ghastly bug their hair on end doth rear,

> wrote Spenser in the *Faerie Queene*. And Shakespeare uses the word
> several times. In The *Taming of the Shrew*: "Tush! tush! fear
> (frighten) boys with bugs." In The Winter's Tale: "The bug, which you
> would frighten me with, I seek." "We have a horror for uncouth
> monsters," wrote L'Estrange; "but upon experience, all these bugs grow
> familiar and easy to us." We use the word still in the form of Bogie
> and Bugbear and Bogart.

> By its root we know that the word belongs to the same series of ideas
> as the Irish Phooka, the English Puck, the German SpUk, and our modem
> work Spook But whence came this form of the word? Sir Walter Scott, in
> *Harold the Dauntless*, makes Jutta, the outlaw's wife, by the Tyne,
> invoke Zernebock, by which is meant Tchemebog--the Black God, a
> Sclavonic deity. In fact, God is Bog in the Sciave tongues. Brelebog
> is the White God, but Grimm greatly doubts whether among the ancient
> Sciaves there existed any discrimination between a White and a Black
> God.

> As Zernebock does not satisfy Jutta by his answer, she strikes the
> altar and exclaims:--

> Hence! to the land of fog and waste,  
> There fittest is thine influence placed,  
> Thou powerless, sluggish Deity!  
> And ne'er shall Briton bend the knee  
> Again before so poor a God.

> As a matter of fact, neither Briton nor Northumbrian Scandinavian ever
> did bow the knee to the Sclave Bog. The introduction of the Bug,
> Bogie, Bogart into our Northern counties and into Scotland is due to
> the extensive colonisation of all Northern Britain

> by the Danes or Northmen. These had been brought into contact
> previously with Sciaves in Russia, where they founded a dynasty, and
> along the Prussian and Pomeranian shores of the Baltic; and they had
> learned there to scoff at the Sclavonic God and turn him into a bogie,
> much as later Christian Anglo-Saxons converted the gods of Valhalla
> into demons. The colonists brought with them to Northumbria the
> conception of fiendish spirits as the gods of the despised Sclaves. We
> have no reason to suppose that there ever was a migration of Sclaves
> into Northumbria, bringing their deities with them, and so giving rise
> to legends of Bogies. The Danish and Norwegian settlers brought the
> conception ready-made with them. The final degradation to which the
> supreme deity of the Sclaves has had to submit has been to confer a
> name on a particularly offensive insect that does promenade in the
> night and prove itself a torment.
