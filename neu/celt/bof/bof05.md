Chapter Five

Sacrifice

 

> In the year 1853, a farmer named J.S., in Meavy Parish, between
> Tavistock and Plymouth, a native of North Devon, lost a good many
> cattle and sheep, due probably to a change of pasture. He accordingly
> took a sheep to the top of Catesham Tor, killed and then burnt it to
> propitiate the evil influences which were destroying his flocks and
> herds. The offering had the desired effect--he lost no more cattle
> after that. He told the vicar of the parish, the Rev. W.A.G. Gray, at
> the time, or shortly after, and did not seem to consider that he had
> done a superstitious thing.

> Compare this with a communication made to Jacob Grimm, and inserted by
> him in his *Deutsche Mythologie*, p.576, ed. 1843. It is a passage
> from a correspondent in Northamptonshire. "Miss C--and her cousin,
> walking, saw a fire in a field, and a crowd around it. They said 'What
> is the matter?' 'Killing a calf.' 'What for?'To stop the murrain.'
> They went away as quickly as possible. On speaking to the clergyman,
> he made inquiries. The people did not like to talk of the affair, but
> it appeared that when there is a disease among the cows, or when the
> calves are born sickly, they sacrifice--that is, kill and burn one for
> good luck."

> in an adjoining parish to this, three years ago the church-warden, a
> farmer, was troubled with murrain among his cattle, and he consulted a
> white witch, who bade him describe a circle on the ground with chalk
> in a field, obtain a white cock, and throw it up into the air, in the
> midst of the ring, when it would fall down dead, and the disorder
> would cease. He got a carpenter who works for me to throw up the cock.
> He did so, and the bird fell down dead, as had been foretold. From
> that moment the cattle recovered. I was told this by the man who threw
> the cock, and he assured me that the bird actually fell dead.

> In the Island of Mull, on the West coast of Scotland, in the year
> 1767, there broke out a disease among the black cattle. Whereupon the
> people agreed to perform an incantation, though they were well aware
> it was not a very godly act. They carried a wheel and nine spindles of
> oakwood to the top of Carnmoor. Then they extinguished every fire in
> every house within sight of the hill. The wheel was then turned from
> east to west over the nine spindles long enough to produce fire by
> friction. If the fire were not produced before noon, the incantation
> lost its effect. They failed for several days running. This they
> attributed to the obstinacy of one householder, who would not allow
> his fires to be put out, as he did not approve of the proceedings.
> However, by bribing his servants, they contrived to have them
> extinguished, and on that morning kindled their fire. They then
> sacrificed a heifer, cutting it in pieces and burning the still warm
> diseased part. They then lighted their own hearths from the pyre, and
> ended by feasting on the remains. The words of incantation were
> repeated by an old man from Morven, who came over as master of the
> ceremonies, and who continued speaking all the time the fire was being
> raised. This man was living as a beggar at Ballocheog. When asked to
> repeat the spell, he declined, as he said that it was the act of this
> enchantment which had brought him to beggary, and that he dared not
> say the words again. The whole country believed him to be accursed.

> Hunt, in his *Romances and Drolls of the West of England* says, "There
> can be no doubt that a belief prevailed until a very recent period,
> amongst the small farmers in the districts remote from towns in
> Cornwall, that a living sacrifice appeased the wrath of God. This
> sacrifice must be by fire, and I have heard it argued that the Bible
> gave them warranty for this belief." He cites a well authenticated
> instance of such a sacrifice in 1800, and adds:

> "While correcting these sheets I am informed of two recent instances
> of this superstition. One of them was the sacrifice of a calf by a
> farmer near Portreath, for the purpose of removing a disease which had
> long followed his horse and his cows. The other was the burning of a
> living lamb, to save, as the farmer said, 'his flocks from spells
> which had been cast on 'em."

> Less than two centuries ago it was the usage of a group of parishes
> which surrounded Applecross N.B. to sacrifice a bull on the 25th
> August, the feast of St Thomas, the patron saint; and the Presbytery
> of Dingwall had frequent occasion to interfere and interdict it. The
> sacrifice took place usually in the island of St Rufus, or Innis
> Maree, where the saint had a cell. From the records of the Presbytery
> we learn that there were monuments of idolatry in the island, and
> stones which were consulted as to future events; that the people
> adored wells and poured libations of milk on hills.

> To this day at King's Teignton, in South Devon, a lamb is drawn about
> the parish on Whitsun Monday decorated with boughs and flowers, and
> contributions are solicited. On Tuesday it is killed and roasted in
> the middle of the village. The meat is then sold in slices to any who
> will buy. The origin of the custom is due to a remote period when the
> village suffered from a dearth of water and the inhabitants were
> advised to sacrifice a lamb. They did so, and water sprang up in an
> abundant fountain at Rydon, that never fails even in the dryest
> summer. Since then the lamb is sacrificed annually. Although the
> custom has lost nearly all its Pagan characters, yet it remains a
> survival.

> Something very much the same took place every year on May-day at Home,
> a village on the fringe of Dartmoor. But it has been discontinued of
> late years.

> About 1869, in Moray, a herd of cattle was attacked with murrain, and
> one was sacrificed by burying alive.

> Dr Mitchell says that in the North-west Highlands and Isles of
> Scotland, to cure epilepsy, a black cock must be buried alive with a
> lock of the patient's hair and some parings of his nails. "This is a
> cruel and barbarous thing, but it is much more than that: it is a
> sacrifice deliberately and consciously offered in order to propitiate
> a supernatural power and effect the expulsion of the demon which is
> believed to have possession of the unfortunate epileptic. The
> ceremonies which attend the sacrifice leave little doubt as to its
> origin, or as to its past and present significance. It is nearly
> always gone about in a secret and solemn manner--in such a way as will
> just tend to secure its important object. A special superhuman agency,
> who is not the God of the Christians, is acknowledged and appealed to,
> and an effort is made to avert his malevolence. The whole idea and
> procedure are as truly heathenish as anything to be found among the
> savage nations of the world. Nor is this unfelt by those who practise
> the rite. They show their consciousness of it in a reluctance to tell
> of what they have done, and in the secrecy which they observe. This
> secrecy, and this reluctance to speak freely testify also to the
> reality of their faith.. .It would be a great mistake to suppose that
> the persons referred to are the grossly ignorant, and a still greater
> mistake to suppose that they are irreligious. On the contrary, they
> are often church-attending, sacrament-observing, and tolerably
> well-educated people--people, too, who necessarily participate, in all
> the advantages of the advanced civilisation of theit country." \[a\]

> We have seen that sacrifices are not completely done away with yet in
> Great Britain; and it is more than possible that a good number still
> take place without tidings of them reaching our ears.

> We will now see what reminiscences yet remain of human sacrifices that
> took place in, not our lands only, but on the Continent in remote
> days.

> What is common in all such cases, as man becomes more civilised and
> humane, is to find a substitute for the human victim We see that in
> the story of Abraham and Isaac, when the patriarch was about to slay
> and burn his son, but found a substitute in the ram caught in a
> thicket by his horns.

> Until his death, in 1884, William Pengelly, aged seventy-eight was
> wont annually, at harvest thanksgivings, to bring a Cornman to the
> church, to be set up there as a decoration. It consisted of a small
> sheaf of wheat with the heads tied tightly together, and wreathed with
> flowers, and below, by means of a stick thrust through, two arms were
> found, and five stalks of barley were bound about each protruding
> portion of the stick, with the heads standing out to represent
> fingers. Before harvest thanksgivings were instituted, the Comman was
> taken to the barn and there suspended.

> It was not invariable that the arms should be formed, and I have seen
> the Cornman without them, or with only indications of arms. As such,
> if I do not mistake, he is represented as many as eight times on the
> carved oak benches of Altarnon Church in Cornwall.

> Mr Hunt, in his *Romances and Drolls of the West of England*, thus
> describes what used to be called "Crying a neck" at harvest.

> "After the wheat is all cut on most farms in Cornwall and Devon, the
> harvest people have a custom of 'crying a neck'. I believe that this
> practice is seldom omitted on any large farm in these counties. It is
> done in this way. An old man, or someone else well acquainted with the
> ceremonies used on the occasion, when the labourers are reaping the
> last field of wheat, goes round to the shocks of sheaves and picks out
> a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this bundle he ties
> up very neat and trim, and plaits and arranges the straws very
> tastefully. This is called 'the neck' of wheat, or wheaten-ears. After
> the field is cut out and the pitchers once more circulated, the
> reapers, binders, and the Women stand round in a circle. The person
> with 'the neck' stands in the centre, grasping it with both his hands.
> He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and all the men forming
> the ring take off their hats, stooping and holding them with both
> hands towards the ground. They then all begin at once, in a very
> prolonged and harmonious tone, to cry 'The Neck'. At the same time
> slowly raising themselves upright and elevating their arms and hats
> above their heads, the person with 'the neck' also raising it on high.
> This is done three times. They then change their cry to 'We yen! We
> Yen!' which they sound in the same prolonged and slow manner as
> before, with singular harmony and effect, three times. The last cry is
> accompanied by the same moments of the body and arms as in crying 'The
> Neck'. After this they all burst out into a kind of loud joyous laugh,
> flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about, and
> perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets 'the neck' and runs
> as hard as he can down to the farmhouse, where the dairymaid, or one
> of the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared with a pail
> of water. If he who holds 'the neck' can manage to get into the house
> in any way unseen, or openly by any other way than the door at which
> the girl stands with the pail of water, then he may lawfully kiss her;
> but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused with the contents of the
> bucket. 'The neck' is generally hung up in the farmhouse, where it
> often remains for three or four years."

> Mr Hunt wrote in 1865. Since then the custom has almost if not wholly
> ceased to be observed, owing to the general abandonment of the sickle
> and the introduction of reaping machines.

> Mr Hunt is wrong in supposing that "We yen" is a corruption of "We
> have done"; it is "We hae 'im!" i.e. we have taken the corn spirit. I,
> in my boyhood, often saw "the neck" crying. Mrs Bray, in a letter to
> Robert Southey, 1832, gives a description of "Cutting the neck", but
> she missed the final ceremony: the flight of the man who carries it
> and gets drenched with water. "We were passing near a field on the
> fringe of Dartmoor, where the reapers were assembled. In a moment the
> pony started nearly from one side of the way to the other, so sudden
> came a shout from the field which gave him this alarm. On my stopping
> to ask my servant what all this noise was about, he seemed surprised
> by the question, and said, 'It was only the people making their games,
> as they always did, to the spirit of the harvest." She then goes on to
> describe the ceremony much in the same way as Mr Hunt, only that,
> according to her, the reapers hold their sickles aloft, not their
> hats, and as I remember it, her account is correct. She also gives the
> cry as "We haven! We haven!"

> The meaning of this usage would quite escape us unless we had
> analogous customs elsewhere to elucidate it. The whole matter has been
> gone into with great minuteness by Mr Fraser in *The Golden Bough*,
> and therefore I will not enter into it here fully, but give a summary
> of facts connected with it. But prior to doing so, I will quote two
> accounts of similar usages in Bavaria from Ganghofer's *Oberland*
> 1884. The girl who is last in the driving out of the sheep is mocked
> by the youths, who make a man of straw and nail it up against the
> stall door. The girl seeks to defend herself with a bucket of water,
> but the youths also bring pails of water, and in the end all get
> thoroughly drenched. This takes place at Tegernsee on Whitsun Monday.

> Elsewhere in Bavaria is performed the Santrigel ceremony. A boy or
> young man, on Whitsunday, is wrapped up in green boughs from head to
> foot, is seated on the leanest cow of the village, with a band going
> before him, and he is conveyed to the edge of a lake or river and is
> there thrown in. As on more than one occasion a Santrigel narrowly
> escaped drowning, the authorities forbade this; and the flinging into
> the river or lake is commuted into sousing with a bucket of water.

> Both these examples represent a sacrifice to the goddess of the
> Spring, in which either a lad or a girl was ceremonially drowned. And
> in the Cornish example of the Neck, the lad flying with the Comman and
> met by a pail of water thrown over him, leads us to trace back to a
> time when he was actually drowned. These Bavarian examples concern
> spring customs, but harvest customs resemble them closely. In some
> parts of Europe the corn spirit is regarded as female, and is spoken
> of as the corn mother; and in such cases it is a woman who makes up
> the figure out of corn straw, or else is wrapped up in straw and led
> about proces--sionally. The cutting of the last shock is supposed to
> be the killing of the corn spirit. Sometimes, and that not
> infrequently, a youth or a woman is wrapped up in the straw and
> treated very roughly--only now not slain. In a good many cases the
> corn man or woman was not drowned but burnt.

> Owing to the distress caused in a small community by the sacrifice by
> water or fire of one of its members, it became customary to seize on a
> stranger passing by, or entering the cornfield. He was constrained to
> ransom himself by a payment. Thus, in Essex, if one not a reaper
> ventures into a cornfield, the workmen rush upon him, surround him,
> shouting, "A largess! A largess!" and beat him very unhandsomely
> unless he pays to escape.

> In Phrygia we are told that Lityertes, son of King Midas, used to reap
> the corn; but when a stranger chanced to enter the field he forced him
> to reap along with himself. Finally he would wrap the stranger in a
> sheaf, cut off his head with a sickle, and carry away his body wrapt
> in the straw. But at last he was himself slain by Hercules, who threw
> his body into the river. As Hercules was probably reported to have
> slain Lityertes in the same way in which Lityertes slew others, we may
> infer that Lityertes was wont to throw the bodies of his victims into
> the river.

> Mr Fraser says that there is ground for supposing that in such a story
> "we have the description of a Phrygian harvest custom in accordance
> with which certain persons, especially strangers, passing the
> harvest-field, were regularly regarded as embodiments of the corn
> spirit, and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in sheaves, and
> beheaded; their bodies, bound up in the cornstalks, being afterwards
> thrown into water as a rain--charm. The grounds for this supposition
> are--first, the resemblance of the Lityertes story to the harvest
> customs of European peasantry; and second, the fact that human beings
> have been commonly killed by savage races to promote the fertility of
> the fields."

> Mr Fraser, following Mannhardt, produces an enormous number of
> instances, far too many to be given here.

> Savage races at the present day sacrifice human beings for the
> prosperity of their harvest. At Lagos in Guinea it was the custom
> annually to impale a young girl alive soon after the spring equinox,
> in order to secure good crops. The Marinos, A Bechuana tnbe, sacnfice
> a human being for the same purpose, and choose as stout a victim as
> they can find. He is killed among the wheat, and his blood is burned
> along with the frontal bone, the flesh, and brain, and the ashes are
> dispersed over the fields to fertilise the soil.

> The Khonds of India were wont to kidnap Brahmin boys; at sowing and
> reaping, after a triumphal procession, one of them was sacrificed, his
> blood was sprinkled over the ploughed field or the ripe crops, and his
> flesh was devoured.

> The Khonds are a native race in Bengal. What we know of them is from
> accounts by British officers engaged in putting them down some sixty
> years ago. They regularly sacrificed to ensure good crops. The victim
> or Meriah must be purchased, or be the son of a victim. Khonds often
> sold their children for the purpose, "considering the beatification of
> their souls certain, and their death for the benefit of mankind, the
> most honourable possible." A victim was always treated with great
> respect as one consecrated to the earth goddess.

> A Meriah youth, on attaining maturity, was given a wife, who was
> herself foredoomed to be sacrificed. Their offspring were also
> victims. The periodical sacrifices were generally so arranged that
> every head of a family was enabled, at least once a year, to procure a
> shred of flesh for his fields.

> The mode of procedure was as follows:--Ten or twelve days before the
> sacrifice the victim had his hair cut. Crowds of men and women
> assembled to witness the sacrifice. None might be excluded, since it
> was for the benefit of all. The victim, dressed in a new garment, was
> led processionally from the village with music and dancing, to a
> sacred grove, where the Meriah, anointed and crowned with flowers, was
> tied to a post. That the victim might not resist, his arm--bones were
> broken, or else he was drugged with opium. Then he was strangled,
> squeezed to death, or cut up alive, the crowd rushing upon him to hack
> the flesh from his body with their knives and carry strips away to
> bury in their fields.

> In one district the victim was put to death slowly by fire. A low
> stage was formed, sloping on each side like a roof; upon it the victim
> was placed, his limbs wound round with cords to confine his struggles.
> Fires were then lighted and hot brands applied to make him roll up and
> down the slopes of the stage as much as possible, for the more tears
> he shed the more abundant would be the supply of rain. When these
> sacrifices were put down by the British Government, goats, etc., were
> substituted for human victims.

> Now those who perpetrated these horrors were not the Aryan Hindus, but
> the Dravidian races underlying them; and there is reason to suppose
> that similar sacrifices that took place in Europe pertained to the
> religious rites of the population that formed the bedrock over which
> were formed the various strata by invasion of Cdt and Teuton. With the
> exception of the Khonds, no deity was recognised, and those who
> reported these sacrifices may not have understood that the cult was to
> spirits and not to gods and goddesses.

> Mr Fraser gives four reasons for thus considering them:--

> "1. No special class of persons is set apart for the performance  
> of the rites; in other words, there are no priests. The rites may be
> performed by anyone as occasion demands.

> 2\. No special places are set apart for the performance of the rites;
> in other words, there are no temples. The rites may be performed
> anywhere as occasion demands.

> 3\. Spirits, not gods, are recognised.

> 4\. The rites are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words,
> the desired objects are attained, not by propitiating divine beings by
> sacrifice, but by ceremonies which are believed to influence the
> course of nature directly through a physical sympathy or resemblance
> between the rite and the effect which it is the intention of the rite
> to produce." \[b\]

> We will pass now to another point, the selection of the victim to be
> sacrificed; and here we have preserved traces of the process, and that
> in children's counting-out games.

> Tacitus tells us that the ancient Germans were wont to determine
> matters of importance by lot. They broke off twigs of a green tree,
> cut them into equal lengths and put on them signs distinguishing one
> from another. These were cast at random upon a white cloth, and the
> priest of the tribe or the house father drew a lot, and guidance as
> from heaven was supposed to be thus given. The use of lots continued
> in vogue among the Saxons till a late period, in spite of the efforts
> of the clergy, who sought to limit application to lot to the cases
> where human judgment could not be certain of being right. It was still
> current in Germany in the seventh century, and with less change of
> adjuncts than we usually find in the adoption of heathen forms even by
> Christian saints.

> That the lot was used to determine a sacrifice we know from the story
> of Jonah. When the storm fell on the ship the sailors "said every one
> to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose
> cause this evil is upon us. So, they cast lots, and the lot fell upon
> Jonah."

> In very much--indeed in exactly the same way--it is determined who is
> to be thrown overboard in an old English ballad still sung by our
> peasantry:--

> 'Twas of a sea-captain came o'er the salt billow  
> He courted a maiden, down by the green willow.  
> "O take of your father his gold and his treasure!  
> O take of your mother her fee without measure."

> The damsel robs her parents, and flies with the sea captain in his
> vessel.

> And when she had sailed today and tomorrow,  
> She was wringing her hands, she was crying in sorrow.  
> And when she had sailed, the days were not many,  
> The sails were outspread, but of miles made not any.

> They cast the BlacK Bullets as they sailed on the water;  
> The black bullet fell on the undutiful daughter.  
> Now who in the ship must go over the side, O!  
> O none sve the maiden, the fair captain's bride O!

> So the undutiful daughter is thrown overboard.

> Tylor, in his *Primitive Culture*, holds that things held of highest
> importance and greatest weight by men in a savage state become the
> playthings of children in a period of civilisation; thus the bow and
> arrow, once the only means men had of obtaining food in the chase, and
> a main means of defence and assault in war, have become toys in the
> hands of civilised children at the present day. Adopting this theory,
> we may see how that methods of determining life or death in ancient
> times may now have degenerated into children's games.

> The casting of lots was used by savage tribes as a means of selecting
> from a company of slaves or prisoners the unhappy individual who was
> to be offered in sacrifice; and one form of selection was by
> counting-out rhymes.

> In an essay on *Wandering Words*, Mr T.W. Sandrey says: "The
> talismanic words uttered by children in their innocent games have come
> down to us very nearly as perfect as when spoken by the ancient
> Briton, but with an opposite and widely different meaning. The only
> degree of likeness that lies between them now is, that where the child
> of the present day escapes a certain kind of juvenile punishment, the
> retention of the word originally meant DEATH in its most cruel and

> is much closer than the writer perceived, for he overlooked the fact

> Three and four,  
> Shut thedoor

> As she spoke she indicated a child at each numeral--

> Pass again.

> "So encouraged, tile frightened child rattled out some lines, then
> halted, her memory had failed, and she had to be reminded of the rest.

> Sir Walter Scott, in *The Pirate*, notices the repugnance felt in

> Orkney and Shetland it was formerly deemed unlucky to rescue persons
> from drowning, since it was held as a matter of religious faith that

> On the Cornish coast the sea is heard calling for its victim. A
> fisherman or a pilot walking one night on the sands at Porth-Towan,
> when all was still save the monotonous fall of the light waves upon
> the sand, distinctly heard a voice from the sea, exclaiming, *The hour
> is come, but not the man*. This was repeated three times, when a black
> figure, like that of a man, appeared on the top of the hill. It paused
> for a moment, then rushed impetuously down the steep incline, over the
> sands, and was lost in the sea.

> Mr Hunt says that this story is told in different forms all round the

> In Whydah, Africa, the king sends a young man annually to be thrown
> into the sea. In the Issefjord, a part of the Cattegat Strait, a
> sea-demon formerly dwelt who stopped every ship and demanded a man

> When Xerxes, in the course of his conquests, came to the sea, he

> Saxo Grammaticus tells how a Norseman's ship was mysteriously stopped
> at sea until a man was thrown overboard. Kinloch says that in ancient
> Scotland, when a ship became unmanageable, lots were cast to discover

> In an old English broadside ballad,

> They had not sailed a league, but three,  
> Till raging grew the roaring sea;  
> There rose a tempest in the skies,  
> Which filled our hearts with great surprise.

> The sea did wash, both fore and aft,  
> Till scarce one sail on board was left;  
> Our yards were split, and our rigging tore,  
> The like was never seen before.

> The boatswain then he did declare  
> The captain was a murderer,  
> Which did enrage the whole ship's crew;  
> Our captain overboard we threw.

> It is but a step from drowning a man as an offering to the hungry sea
> to allowing a man to drown, refusing him help, as was the case in
> Orkney and Shetland and in Cornwall as well. On the west coast of
> Ireland, when the Spanish sailers were wrecked from the Armada, the

> Irishmen, but because it was unlucky to rescue anyone from the sea,
> which exacts its toll of human life. It is not only the sea that makes
> these demands, but, as we have seen, rivers as well. So do lakes. On
> Dartmoor is a sheet of water in a depression, called Classenwell pooi,
> covering about an acre of ground. It has been dug out of the southern
> part of the hill and along the verge of the banks on the tors; the
> measurement is three hundred and forty-six yards. From this part,
> which is level with the adjacent common, the banks slope rapidly down
> to the margin of the pool. On the east side the bank is almost
> perpendicular, and is nearly one hundred feet high. According to
> popular superstition a voice can be heard at night shouting a name of
> some inhabitant of the parish of Wallthampton, in which it is
> situated, several times and on successive nights, when that individual
> is certain to obey the call by death.

> Now let us consider another current of popular superstition. At the
> foundation of any building--a church, a town hail, a private
> mansion--almost invariably a coin is laid beneath the foundation
> stone. The coin takes the place of an animal. I will not enter fully

> I will mention the salient facts. There can be no doubt that in the

> which guarded the church and churchyard. In the parish of Lew
> Trenchard it was two white pigs yoked together with a silver chain. In
> an adjoining parish it was a black dog. In another it was a calf. In
> Denmark the church lamb was a constant apparition. But the burial of
> an animal under a foundation stone was a substitution for a human
> victim.

> In 1885 Holsworthy Church in Devon was restored and in the course of
