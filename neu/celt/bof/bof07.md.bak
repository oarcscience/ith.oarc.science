Chapter Seven

Fetches

 

> In the infancy of man there were two phenomena that sorely perplexed
> him: his reflection in standing water, and his shadow. The universal
> ignorance of the most elementary laws of Nature goes far to explain
> the origin of many myths that were adopted as solutions of problems
> not understood. Why did a man, on looking into still water, see
> himself reproduced? He knew nothing of the principle of reflection,
> and he supposed that he saw a real double of himself. What was the
> cause of the shadow dogging his steps? It was not caused by his body
> intercepting the rays of the sun. That was a conception far beyond his
> reach. He supposed that his shadow was his attendant spirit.
> Consequently he had two companions--one luminous and the other dark;
> one good and the other evil.

> I had plate-glass windows in my dining-room. Frequently peacocks,
> seeing themselves reflected in the panes, flew at them and shattered
> the glass, supposing that they saw rivals in the affections of the
> pea-hens. Tigers have been caught by placing mirrors in traps. The
> tiger approaches, sees his reflection, enters to rub noses or to bite
> the beast of his species he sees. Primitive man had no greater degree
> of intelligence in the particular of his reflection than have peacocks
> and tigers.

> Throughout the Aryan stock we find a belief in fetches, wraiths, or
> doubles, i.e. of man being attended by his duplicate, often considered
> as a guardian spirit; in a good many places we find also a belief in
> an evil--minded, mischievous genius as well. These are none other than
> a survival of old conceptions relative to the reflection and the
> shadow.

> I have known children cry out with rage when a comrade whipped or
> stamped on their shadow, crying out that it hurt them, or at least was
> an insult.

> The Greeks held that there were *agathodaemones*, good spirits, also
> *kakodaemones*, attached to men swaying them to this side or to the
> other; and Socrates took counsel of, and followed the guidance of, his
> daemon. It was not till Christianity occupied the field that these
> demons were all comprehended as devils.

> The Romans had their genii; every man had his genius, an attendant
> spirit; even the gods were supposed to have their genii. All the acts
> of life from birth to death, all the vicissitudes of life and human
> activities, all the relations between men and their fellows, all
> enterprises, were due to the impulses afforded by these guardian
> spirits. Every household had its Lares and Peates, but these were of a
> different order, as they were ancestral deities, the spirits of the
> founders of the family.

> To get deeper into the beliefs of an Aryan people on this topic, we
> must go to Scandinavian and German sources.

> The Norsemen believed that every man had his *fylgja*, follower, a
> spirit intimately related to him, and that died when he did. It did
> not always follow--it often preceded him to look into the future and
> foretell what was to be. When the fylgja preceded anyone it was
> possible to stumble over it. When a certain Thorsteinn was seven years
> old, he came running with childish impetuosity into the room of one
> Geitir. In so doing he tripped and sprawled on the floor, whereat
> Geitir laughed. Somewhat later, Thorsteinn asked what had occasioned
> this outburst of merriment; whereupon the other answered: "I saw, what
> you did not see, as you burst into the room, for there followed you a
> white bear, running in front of you, but when it saw me it remained
> stationary, and you stumbled over it." This was Thorsteinn's own
> fylgja, and Geitir concluded from its appearance that the lad was
> destined to great things.

> The fylgja was often seen in animal shape--an interesting reminiscence
> of transmigration; for though the belief in the metempsychosis of the
> human soul had been given up, the idea lingered on and attached itself
> to the companion spirit. The fylgja showed themselves sometimes in the
> form of men, but also in that of any beast which represented the
> character of temperament of the man it followed. Brave men had their
> companion spirits in the shape of bears or wolves. That of a crafty
> man appeared as a fox. A timorous man had a fylgja in the form of a
> hare or a small bird.

> The Icelander Einarr Eyjólfsson foresaw the death of his brother
> Gudmund in dream. He fancied that an ox with long horns ascended out
> of the Eyjafjord and leaped upon the high seat of Gudmund in his farm
> of Madruvöllr, and there fell dead. This ox, said Einarr, is a man's
> fylgja. That same day his brother returned from a journey, and took
> his place in the high seat in his hall, and sank out of it dead.

> Hjal and Thord went together into a field in which a goat had been
> seen, which none could drive away. All at once Thord exclaimed, "This
> is very strange." "What do you see that is strange?" asked Njal. "I
> see," answered Thord, "the goat lying drenched in blood." Njal
> replied, "That is no goat, it is something else." "What is it, then?"
> asked Thord. "Look out for yourself," said Njal; "you are fey and that
> is your following spirit."

> The fylgjar come into the world in the caul of a newborn child. If
> this caul be burnt or thrown away, the man has lost his guardian
> spirit for his life. In Norway a departing guest is always attended to
> the door, to make sure that the valve is kept open long enough to
> allow the spirit to pass out after the man.

> In Germany the Companion Spirit is called Jüdel, or Gütel, and when a
> child laughs in sleep it is said the Jüdel is playing with him. If the
> guardian spirit keeps the child restless, something is given to it to
> distract its attention from its little ward.

> The idea of the Companion Spirit has been christianised into that of
> the Guardian Angel. St Bernard says in one of his sermons:

> "Whenever you perceive that you are sorely tempted, and that a great
> trouble menaces, invoke your guardian, your teacher, your helper. In
> difficulties, in tribulation, in any circumstances, in any hard
> pressure, have respect to your angel. Never venture, in his presence,
> to do that which you would not do before me." Caesarius of Heisterbach
> says that to every man pertains a good, but also a bad angel. Although
> the fetch or doppelgänger, as the Germans call him, has been melted
> into the Guardian Angel, he has for all that, in many cases, retained
> his identity; and stories are not uncommon of his appearance.

> Some years ago I was walking through the cloister at Hurstpier-point
> College, when I saw coming towards me the bursar. I spoke to him. He
> turned and looked at me, but passed on without a word. I went on to
> the matron's apartment, and there the identical man was. I exclaimed:
> "Hallo, P., I have just passed you and spoken to you in the cloister!"
> He turned very pale and said, "I have not left this room." "Well,"
> said I, "I could swear to an alibi any day."

> A Mr Macnish, quoted by Mrs Crowe, tells the following story:

> Mr H. was one day walking along the street, apparently in good health,
> when he saw, or supposed he saw, his acquaintance, Mr C., walking
> before him. He called to him aloud, but he did not seem to hear him,
> and continued walking on. Mr H. then quickened his pace for the
> purpose of overtaking him, but the other increased his also, as if to
> keep ahead of his pursuer, and proceeded at such a rate that Mr H.
> found it impossible to make up to him. This continued for some time,
> till, on Mr C. reaching a gate, he opened it and passed in, slamming
> it violently in Mr H.'s face. Confounded at such treatment from a
> friend, the latter instantly opened the gate and looked down the long
> lane into which it led, where, to his astonishment, no one was to be
> seen. Determined to unravel the mystery, he then went to Mr C.'s
> house, and his surprise was great to hear that he was confined to his
> bed, and had been so for several days. A week or two afterwards these
> gentlemen met at the house of a mutual friend, when Mr H. related the
> circumstances, jocularly telling Mr C. that, as he had seen his
> wraith, he of course could not live long. The person addressed laughed
> heartily, as did the rest of the party; but in a few days Mr C. was
> attacked with putrid sore throat, and died; and within a short period
> of his death, Mr H. was also in his grave.

> In the biography of John Reinhard Hedinger, Court chaplain in 1698 to
> Duke Eberhard Ludwig of Würtemberg, appears a curious story. The duke
> was a sadly immoral man, and after Hedinger had repeatedly urged him
> to a better life, he preached in the Court chapel against the sins to
> which the Duke was most addicted. The prince was furious, and sent
> orders to the Court chaplain to come to him alone in the palace at a
> certain hour. Hedinger went and was introduced. The intention of the
> duke was to reprimand him harshly and then punish him severely. When
> the chaplain entered the cabinet of the prince, the latter stared at
> him with astonishment, and said "Why have you not come alone?" "I am
> alone, your serene highness." "No, you are not," retorted the duke,
> with his eyes fixed on the right side of the Court preacher. Hedinger
> replied gravely: "But I am--quite alone. Your highness, if God has
> sent His angel to stand by me, I know nothing about it." The duke
> dismissed him, showing all the signs of profound agitation. Whether
> this were an angel, or Hedinger's double, cannot be said, as Eberhard
> Ludwig did not give a description of what he saw.

> The musician Glück was staying in Ghent. While there he was spending
> an evening with some friends. He returned to his lodgings one
> moonlight evening, when he observed going before him a figure that
> closely resembled himself. It took every turn through the streets
> which he was accustomed to take, and finally, on reaching the door,
> drew out a key, opened it, and entered. On this the musician turned
> round, went back to his friends, and earnestly entreated to be taken
> in for the night. Next morning they accompanied him to his lodgings,
> and found that the heavy wooden beams of the ceiling of Glück's
> sleeping-room had fallen down in the night and crushed the bed. It was
> obvious that had he passed the night there he must have been killed.

> Barham, in his Reminiscences, related the story of a respectable young
> woman, who was roused in the night by hearing somebody in her room,
> and that on looking up she saw a young man to whom she was engaged.
> Extremely offended at such an intrusion, she bade him instantly depart
> if he wished ever to speak with her again. Whereupon he told her that
> he was to die that day six weeks, and then disappeared. Having
> ascertained that the youth could not possibly have been in her room,
> she was naturally much alarmed, and her evident depression leading to
> some inquiries, she communicated what had occurred to the family with
> whom she lived. They attached little importance to what seemed so
> improbable, more especially as the young man continued in perfectly
> good health, and was entirely ignorant of the prediction, which was
> carefully kept from him. When the fatal day arrived the girl became
> cheerful, and as the ladies with whom she lived went on their morning
> ride, they observed to each other that the prophecy did not seem
> likely to be fulfilled. On their return, however, they saw her running
> up the avenue towards the house, in great agitation, and learned that
> her lover was then either dead or dying.

> In Yorkshire the wraith or double is called a waft. There is one night
> in the year in which the wafts of those who are about to die proceed
> to the church and may be seen. This is St Mark's Eve, and anyone who
> is curious to know about the death of his fellow-parishioners must
> keep watch in the church porch on that eve for an hour on each side of
> midnight for three successive years. Mr Henderson says in his
> *Northern Folklore*:--

> On the third year they will see the forms of those doomed to die

> within the twelvemonth passing, one by one, into the church. If the
> watcher fall asleep during his vigil he will die himself during the
> year. I have heard, however, of one case in which the intimation was
> given by the sight of the watcher's own form and features. It is that
> of an old woman at Scarborough, who kept St Mark's vigil in the porch
> of St Mary's in that town about eighty years ago. Figure after figure
> glided into the church, turning round to her as they went in, so that
> she recognised their familiar faces. At last a figure turned and gazed
> at her; she knew herself, screamed, and fell senseless to the ground.
> Her neighbours found her there in the morning, and carried her home,
> but she did not long survive the shock.

> I know of a case far more recent, at Monkokehampton, in North Devon,
> when a stalwart young carpenter resolved on keeping watch. He saw two
> pass him, and then his own wraith, that looked hard at him. He fled
> and took to his bed. The rector visited him and did all in his power
> to convince the man that he had been victim to hallucination or a
> dream. The doctor visited him and could find nothing really the matter
> with him. Nevertheless he died within a fortnight.
