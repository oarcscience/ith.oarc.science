#### THE THREE WAYS.

<span id="an_p_32">32</span>. Thus this poor old man who lived long ago
had three sons who thought that they would leave their father, and that
they would go out into the world to seek their fortunes. The leash of
lads set off together upon one way, and they kept going on till they
reached a road that spread in three branches. They said to each other
when they saw these three ways, that each should take a separate path,
and that they should meet there in a year and a day, and so they did,
and parted.

The eldest took the way that went east. The middle brother took the
middle way. The youngest took the road that went west.

<span id="an_p_33">33</span>. The eldest son rode east, away from the
seashore and the smell of the brine, rode into the wood till the sun was
high and he did not know where he was. He could see nothing but a
wilderness of trees.

<span id="an_p_34">34</span>. At last he came to an open space where he
saw a wolf, a hawk, and a fox standing beside a year-old sheep.

"Stop," said the wolf, "and divide this carcase amongst us."

So the lad got off his black horse and pulled out the little rusty knife
that he used to have in his father's boat to split fish, and he cut the
sheep into three shares and threw them down before the creatures, and
bade them choose.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

That pleased them well.

Said the wolf: "When you are hard-pressed, remember me."

Said the hawk: "When you are in dire straits, remember me."

Said the fox: "When you are at the worst, think of me."

<span id="an_p_35">35</span>. The beasts and the bird blessed the
fisher's son, and he blessed them, and he mounted again and on he rode
through the forest at speed. Each road was crooked, and each path was
smooth for him and for his black horse and hound. They went so fast that
they caught the swift March wind that blew before them, and the swift
March wind that followed after could not catch them. And so they rode
and ran through the forest and trees, till the bright clear white clouds
of day were going away, and the dark, dim, dusky black clouds of night
were coming on apace; and then they reached the palace gate of a great
king's castle in a realm that is not of this realm at all.
