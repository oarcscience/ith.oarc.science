#### <span class="smallcaps">The Weapon.</span>

<span id="an_p_21">21</span>. "And now, father," said he, "make me a
weapon."

So the old smith went out to his smithy and weighed out iron enough to
make a stout staff a stone weight, and he smithied it well while his son
looked on. When it was done he took it and shook it, and it bent and
broke in his grasp.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

"That is not strong enough," said the lad, "for me. Let's make another."

<span id="an_p_22">22</span>. So the old smith weighed out two stone of
iron and they smithied a great iron club like the first. Then the lad
took it and shook it, and it bent and broke like the first.

"That is far too weak," said the smith's son.

<span id="an_p_23">23</span>. So the old smith weighed out three stone
of iron, and they beat it and hammered and smithied, and forged a great
bar; and when that was done he took it and shook it and it bent.

"That's too weak," said the lad, "if I were insulted."

<span id="an_p_24">24</span>. So they weighed out four stone of iron,
and forged a great bar; and when that was done the lad took it and shook
it like a reed and it bent again. "That's not strong yet," he said, "if
I were angry."

<span id="an_p_25">25</span>. So they weighed out five stone and made
another bar, and that bent like the rest.

"That would not serve if I were in a right good rage," said the lad.

<span id="an_p_26">26</span>. So they weighed six stone of iron and
smithied a great bent club like a shinny, and when that was made and
cooled the smith's son said, "that will do."

<span id="an_p_27">27</span>. Then he got up and went in to his house,
and sought out the first of the fish bones which he buried, and dug up
from the root of the first tree that sprouted on the night when his sons
were born. He

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

went back to the smithy and reached out his hand to his eldest son.
"Here," said he, "take that and try it."

<span id="an_p_28">28</span>. The lad took the little bone and gripped
it and stretched out his arm and shook it, and the bone became a
gold-hilted, glittering glaive in his grasp.

<span id="an_p_29">29</span>. "Thanks to thee, Oh King of Princes and
Mercies," said the lad. "Now I have done learning, wisdom, and
knowledge, and now I may start. Yonder tree will be in bud, blossom, and
leaf from autumn to summer, and from spring to winter, now and for ever
till I meet death; and when I am dead the buds will fall off my tree."

<span id="an_p_30">30</span>. The smith's sons would all three start and
try their fortune; and each got his horse and hound and club and
sword. <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64)

<span id="an_p_31">31</span>. They rose with the dawn and saddled their
black steeds and called their black dogs, and hung their gleaming
gold-hilted blades at their sides. They sought and got their mother's
blessing.

"Son," said the old man to the eldest, "be sure that you never go within
reach of the wind of the sea-shore."

"I will go," said he, "where there never was a drop of brine."

Then they left their blessings at home and set off to seek fortune; and
so they took the world for their pillow and started on their way.
