THE 'mothan' (bog-violet?) is one of the most prized plants in the
occult science of the people. It is used in promoting and conserving the
happiness of the people, in securing love, in ensuring life, in bringing
good, and in warding away evil.

When the 'mothan' is used as a love-philtre, the woman who gives it goes
upon her left knee and plucks nine roots of the plant and knots them
together, forming them into a 'cuach'--ring. The woman places the ring
in the mouth of the girl for whom it is made, in name of the King of the
sun, and of the moon, and of the stars, and in name of the Holy Three.
When the girl meets her lover or a man whom she loves and whose love she
desires to secure, she puts the ring in her mouth. And should the man
kiss the girl while the 'mothan' is in her mouth [he](errata.htm#0.md)
becomes henceforth her bondsman, bound to her everlastingly in cords
infinitely finer than the gossamer net of the spider, and infinitely
stronger than the adamant chain of the giant.

The 'mothan' is placed under parturient women to ensure delivery, and it
is carried by wayfarers to safeguard them on their journeys. It is sewn
by women in their bodice, and by men in their vest under the left arm.

An old woman in Benbecula said:--'Thug mi am mothan beannaichte do
Ruaraidh ruadh mac Raoghail Leothasaich as a Cheann-a-deas agus e air a
thuras do Loch-nam-madadh, dol ga fhiachain air bialabh an t-siorram
agus fhuair e dheth ge do bha e co ciontach ’s a chionta ri mac
peacaich'--'I gave the blessed "mothan" to red Roderick son of Ranald of
Lewis <span id="page_111">p. 111</span> from the South-end (of Uist),
and he on his journey to Lochmaddy to be tried before the sheriff, and
he got off although he was as guilty of the guilt as the son of a
sinner.' 'Ach a Chairistine carson a thug sibh am mothan dh’an duine
agus fios agaibh gun robh e ciontach? Saoilidh mi fein nach robh e ceart
dhuibh a dhol ga dheanamh'--'But, Christina, why did you give the
"mothan" to the man when you knew that he was guilty? I think myself it
was not right of you to go and do it!' 'O bhidh ’s aodaich! a ghraidhean
mo chridhe agus a ghaoilean mo dhaoine, cha b’ urra dhomh fhein dhol ga
dhiultadh. Bhoinich e orm, agus bhochain e orm, agus bhoidich a orm,
agus chuir e rud am laimh, agus O! a Righ na gile ’s na greine, agus nan
corracha ceuta, curra, de b’ urra dhomh fhein a gh’ radh no dheanamh
agus an duine dona na dhubh-eigin na dheargtheinn agus na
chruaidh-chas'--'O food and clothing! thou dear one of my heart, and
thou loved one of my people, I could not myself go and refuse him. He
beseeched to me, and he swelled to me, and he vowed to me, and he placed
a thing in my hand, and oh! King of the moon, and of the sun, and of the
beautiful, sublime stars, what could I myself say or do, and the bad man
in his black trouble, in his red difficulty, and in his hard plight!' I
remembered Bacon and was silent.

To drink the milk of an animal that ate the 'mothan' ensures immunity
from harm. If a man makes a miraculous escape it is said of him, 'Dh’ of
e bainne na bo ba a dh’ ith am mothan'--'He drank the milk of the
guileless cow that ate the "mothan."'

I am not sure what the plant is--perhaps the bog-violet.
