### FĀTH-FĪTH \[133\]

'FĀTH-FĪTH' and 'fīth-fāth' are interchangeable terms and
indiscriminately used. They are applied to the occult power which
rendered a person invisible to mortal eyes and which transformed one
object into another. Men and women were made invisible, or men were
transformed into horses, bulls, or stags, while women were transformed
into cats, hares, or hinds. These transmutations were sometimes
voluntary, sometimes involuntary. The 'fīth-fāth' was especially
serviceable to hunters, warriors, and travellers, rendering them
invisible or unrecognisable to enemies and to animals.

Fionn had a fairy sweetheart, a daughter of the people of the mounds,
but Fionn forsook her and married a daughter of the sons of men. The
fairy was angry at the slight put upon her, and she placed the wife of
Fionn under the 'fīth-fāth' spell in the form of a hind of the hill. The
wife of Fionn bore a son in the island of Sanndraigh in Loch-nan-ceall
in Arasaig. The mother possessed so much of the nature of the hind that
she licked the temple of the child when he was born, but she possessed
so much of the nature of the woman that she only gave one lick. But hair
like the hair of a fawn grew on the part of the temple of the child
which the tongue of the hind-mother had touched. And because of this
patch of fawn's hair on his temple the child was called 'Oisein,' the
fawn. While still a boy Ossian followed Fionn and the Feinne to the
hunting-hill to chase the mountain deer. In the midst of the chase a
magic mist darker than night came down upon the hunters, blinding them
from one another and from their surroundings--no one knew where was
another or where he was himself. Hunt-wandering came over Ossian, and he
wandered wearily alone, and at last found himself in a deep green glen
surrounded by high blue hills. As he walked along he saw a timid hind
browsing in a green corrie before him. And Ossian thought to himself
that he had never seen a creature so lovely as this timid hind, and he
stood gazing upon her with joy. But the spirit of the hunt was strong
upon Ossian, and the blood of the hunter was hot in his veins, and he
drew his spear to throw it at the hind. The hind turned and looked at
Ossian and gazed upon him with her full wistful grey eyes, more lovely
and alluring than the blue eyes of love. 'Do not hurt me, Ossian,' said
the hind; 'I am thy mother under the "fīth-fāth," in the form of a hind
abroad and in the form of a woman at home. Thou art hungry and thirsty
and weary. Come thou home with me, thou fawn of my heart.' And Ossian
accompanied the hind step by step till they reached a rock in the base
of the hill. The hind opened a leaf in a door in the rock where no door
seemed to be, and she went in, and Ossian went in after her. She closed
the door-leaf in the rock and there was no appearance of a door. And the
graceful hind became transformed into a beautiful woman, like the lovely
woman of the green kirtle and the locks of gold. There was light in the
bower in the bosom of the ben like the light of 'trath-nona la leth an

t-samhraidh'--noontide on midsummer day. Nor was it the light of the
sun, nor was it the light of the moon, nor was it the light of the star
of guidance. His mother prepared food and drink and music for Ossian.
And she placed food in a place of eating for him, and she placed drink
in a place of drinking for him, and she placed music in a place of
hearing for him. Ossian took of the food and of the drink and of the
music till he was full satisfied--his seven full satiations. After
feasting, Ossian said to his mother, 'I am going, mother, to see what
Fionn and the Feinne are doing in the hunting-hill.' And his mother
placed her arm around his neck and kissed Ossian with the three kisses
of a mother, and then she opened the door-leaf in the door of the bower
and allowed him out. When she closed it there was no appearance of a
door in the rock.

Ossian had been feasting on food and drink and music in the bower with
his mother for the space of three days, as he thought, but he had been
in the bower for the space of three years instead. And he made a song,
the first song he made, warning his mother against the men and the
hounds of the Feinne.

In his *Leabhar Na Feinne* Iain Campbell of Islay says that he had
received fourteen versions of this song of Ossian. Six of these had been
sent to him by the present writer. One of these versions was obtained
from Oirig Nic Iain--Effric or Effie Mac Iain--lineally descended, she
said, from Alexander Mac Iain, chief of the massacred Macdonalds of
Glencoe.

Effric Mac Iain was not tall, but she was very beautiful, intelligent,
and pleasant. I obtained a silver brooch from her which, she said, had
come down like herself through the generations from the massacred chief
of Glencoe. The brooch is circular and beautifully chased, though much
worn.
