### S

*Saighead-sith*, fairy arrow. This is the name given by the people to
the flint arrow-heads so much prized by antiquaries. Some of these are
very small and well fashioned. They are said to have been thrown by
fairies at the sons and daughters of men. The writer possesses one which
was thrown at a girl at Lochmaddy. The girl went out at night to the
peat-stack for a creel of peats. She was aware of something whizzing
through the silent air, passing through her hair, grazing her ear, and
falling at her feet. Stooping down in the bright moonlight, she picked
up a fairy arrow. The girl never again went out at night.

The people say that a fairy arrow, especially the arrow of the fairy
queen, cannot be safeguarded against the wiles of the fairies. The
writer can confirm this in his own experience, having unaccountably
lost, despite all possible care, the smallest

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

and most beautifully shaped and coloured arrow-head he has ever seen,
and that within a few hours after getting it!

 

*Samh*, fat, rich, productive, flock, fold, herd, fish, cruive, odour;
'samh eisg,' fish odour; 'samh trom eisg,' heavy odour of fish, that
heavy odour from a great body of fish in the sea. Other meanings of
'samh' are sorrel, garlic, clown, foul person. A place in Morvern is
called 'Samh-airidh,' sorrel sheiling, from 'samh,' sorrel, and
'airidh,' sheiling. It is mentioned by Dr Norman Macleod in his playful
song to his father's beadle:--

*Samh*, a god, a giant, a strong person. Derivatives are 'samhan,' a
dog, a little giant; 'samhanach,' a great giant, a monster; 'mharbhadh
to na samhanaich,' thou wouldst kill the giants.

 

*Samhainn*, *Samhuinn*, *Oidhche Shamhainn*, *Oidhche Shamhna*,
Hallowtide, Hallowmas, Hallowe’en. This is one of the seasons when
innumerable mystic rites are practised. Supposed to be from
'samh-f huin,' summer-end.

 

*Scan*, probably some animal.

 

*Seachd*, seven. Seven is one of the sacred numbers so frequently
occurring in the poems, proverbs, and phrases of the people.

'Seachd,' seven, expresses perfection, completeness, as 'seachd sgith,'
utterly tired, 'seachd searbh,' the height of bitterness, 'seachd sath,'
perfect satiation. Hence its use in the following phrases:--'seachd
beannachd ort,' seven blessings on you; 'seachd mallachd ort,' seven
cursings on you; 'seachd seacharain seilg ort,' seven hunt wanderings on
you, 'seachd gloir,' seven glories, 'seachd deamhain,' seven devils,
'seachd sagairt,' seven priests, 'seachd sitheach,' seven fairies.

Many more examples of the number seven could be given, but the following
will suffice. It was taken down in 1860, with much more old lore, from
Kenneth Morrison, cottar, Trithion, Skye. Kenneth Morrison, old and
blind, had much native intelligence and interesting lore. I love to
think of his calm face, of his kindly smile, and of his warm welcome.

'A subsequent day was appointed for the coronation of Rienzi. Seven
crowns of different leaves or metals were successively placed on his
head by the most eminent of the Roman clergy; they represented the seven
gifts of the Holy Ghost.'--Gibbon's *Decline and Fall*.

 

*Seachda siona*, seven elements. The surface meaning of this expression
is clear, the intended meaning obscure. (Vol. i. p. 6.) 'Sion,' 'sian,'
is an element. Thus construed, the 'seachda siona,' seven elements,
would probably be fire, air, earth, water, snow, ice, and wind--perhaps
lightning.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --when all the
elements are let loose.

'Deireadh nan seachd sian ort.' The end of the seven elements be upon
thee--a malediction. \['Sian' here may mean storm, tempest.\]

 

*Sealbh*, means, possessions, luck, Providence. Sometimes the word is
confined to corn, sometimes to flocks, and sometimes it includes the
whole possessions.

 

*Searcan*, *seircean*, another name for 'meac-an-dogh,' burdock. The
people held the burdock in high esteem, using an extract of the root in
pulmonary complaints.

 

*Searrach*, foal. There is much superstition connected with the foal, as
also with the horse. If the first foal seen for the season is facing the
beholder it denotes good luck; if walking towards the beholder, coming
luck; if running towards the beholder, immediate luck. If the contrary,
ill luck, ill news, death. The foal of an old mare is said to be more
active than that of a young mare.

'Sgeo' occurs in place-names. Sgeobost is variously called 'Sgeabost,'
'Sgebost,' 'Sgiabost,' 'Sgibost,' all forms of 'sgeo,' haze, and 'bost,'
Norse for house. 'Sgitheanach' is from 'sgi,' a case of 'sgeo,' and the
termination 'anach,' full of. Of old, Skye was known as 'Clar-Sgi,'
Haze-land. The sea between Skye and Uist, now called the Little Minch,
was known as 'Cuan-Sgi,' Haze-ocean. \[These explanations are
improbable.\]

 

*Sgonn*, *sgonnag*, a block, a little block, as 'sgonn cabair,' block of
wood; 'sgonn cloiche,' block of stone; 'sgonn gille,' a block of a lad;
'sgonn arain,' a block of bread. 'Sgonn,' 'sgonnan,' 'sgonnag,' is the
base of the couple imbedded in the wall of a house. Scottish 'bùgar.'
'Clach mhor bhun sgonnaig' is the upright flag-stone at the base of the
couple as a partition to prevent cows injuring one another. In some
places this upright stone is called 'stāll,' a stall.

 

*Sgōth*, *sgāth*, shade, shelter, a concealment hut for sportsmen.

 

'Sgoth,' a steep rock, an abrupt hill, a bank of cloud, an overhanging
haze, a place-name in Uist and Harris. A form of 'sgath,' and cognate
with 'sgeo'--

*Sic*, *sicean*, *silc*, *silcean*, *silean*, a particle, a small grain,
an infinitesimal quantity; 'sicean sioil,' a small grain of seed.

 

*Sionn*, *siunn*, *siann*, *siannt*, mysterious, probably akin to
'sian,' a charm.

An island near Easdale, another near Appin, and another near Moidart, is
called 'Sionna.' Islands near Lewis, a hill in Islay, a hill in
Ardnamurchan, and a loch near Kilmun, are called 'siannt,' where
'siannta' means sained, sacred. 'Holy Loch' in Corval is 'an Loch
Siannta.'

 

*Sionn*, light, brightness, lurid light; hence the region of lurid
light. 'Domhnach sionnaich,' bright Sunday, 'teine sionnachain,'
phosphorescence, the rainbow-like brightness seen in spindrift on a
clear sunny day. 'Cur teine sionnachain ’s an speur'--sending
phosphorescence into the sky.

 

*Sith*, *sithich*, fairy, fairies; 'siodha,' 'siodhach,' fay, fairy;
'bean sith,' 'sitheag,' female fairy, 'sitheach,' 'sifir,' 'sifire,'
'sifreach,' male fairy. The fairies entered largely into the lives and
folklore of the Highland people. They lived in the green knolls and
round hillocks, and only occasionally appeared to mortal eyes.

In October 1871, the late J. F. Campbell of Islay and the writer were
storm-stayed in the precipitous island of Miunghlaidh, Barra. We
occupied our time in listening to the folklore of the people by whom we
were so kindly treated. One of these was Roderick MacNeill, known as
'Ruaraidh mac Dhomhuil,' Roderick the son of Donald, a famous
story-teller and a man wondrously endowed mentally and physically.
MacNeill was then ninety-two years of age. He had never been ill, and
never had shoes on, and never had tasted tea. His chest was as round as
a barrel, and measured forty-eight inches in circumference. He had been
an extraordinary 'rocker' after birds, moving about on precipices of
eight hundred feet sheer down to the sea, where a goat or even a cat
might hesitate to go. So powerful was the man that wherever his fingers
could get insertion in the crevices of the rock he could move his body
along the face of the precipice without any other support.

One of the many tales he told us was that of the origin of the fairies,
which I condense:--

The Proud Angel fomented a rebellion among the angels of heaven, where
he had been a leading light. He declared that he would go and found a
kingdom of his own. When going out at the door of heaven the Proud Angel
brought 'dealanaich

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

dheilgnich agus beithir bheumnaich,' prickly lightning and biting
lightning, out of the door-step with his heels. Many angels followed
him--so many that at last the Son called out, 'Father! Father! the city
is being emptied!' whereupon the Father ordered that the gates of heaven
and of hell should be closed. This was instantly done; and those who
were in were in, and those who were out were out; while the hosts who
had left heaven and had not reached hell, flew into the holes of the
earth 'mar na famhlagan,' like the stormy petrels.

These are the fairy folks--ever since doomed to live under the ground,
and only permitted to emerge when and where the King permits. They are
never allowed abroad on Thursday, that being Columba's Day, nor on
Friday, that being the Son's Day, nor on Saturday, that being Mary's
Day, nor on Sunday, that being the Lord's Day.

Many things are named after the fairies, indicating the manner in which
they dominated the minds of the people. 'Breaca-sith,' fairy marks,
livid spots appearing on the face of the dead or dying; 'marcachd
shith,' fairy riding, paralysis of the spine in animals, alleged to be
brought on by the fairy mouse riding across the backs of the animals
while lying down; 'piob shith,' fairy pipe, elfin pipe, generally found
in under-ground houses; 'miaran na mna sithe,' the thimble of the fairy
woman, foxglove; 'lion na mna sithe,' lint of the fairy woman, fairy
flax, said to be beneficial in certain illnesses; 'curachan na mna
sithe,' coracle of the fairy woman, the shell of the blue valilla, are a
few examples of things called after the little 'people of peace.'

In place-names 'sith' is very common. 'Gleann-sith,' Glen-shee,

in Perthshire, is said to have been full of fairies. The screech of the
steam whistle has frightened them underground. 'Sithean a Bhealaich,'
fairy knoll of the pass, is the name of a place at 'Bealach Rosgairt'
(Fhrosgairt), Benmore, South Uist. Scarcely a district in the Highlands
is without its 'sithean,' fairy knoll, generally the greenest hillock in
the place. 'Feadan dubh Chlanna Chatain,' the black chanter of the Clan
Chattan, is said to have been given to a famous Macpherson piper by a
fairy woman who loved him. The Mackays have a flag said to have been
given to a Mackay by a fairy sweetheart.

The famous fairy flag at Dunvegan is said to have been given to a
Macleod of Macleod by a fairy woman. The Mac-Crimmons of Bororaig, the
famous pipers of the Macleods of Macleod, had a chanter called
'Sionnsair airgid na mna sithe,' the silver chanter of the fairy woman.

As 'Iain Og,' young John MacCrimmon, was practising in 'Slochd nam
piobairean,' hollow of the pipers, at Bororaig, the lovely fair

The story of young John and his fairy sweetheart is very fine and highly
poetic.

A family in North Uist is known as 'Dubh-sith,' Black fairy, from a
tradition that the family have been familiar with the fairies in their
fairy flights and secret migrations.

Donald MacAlastair, aged seventy-nine, crofter, Druim-a-ghinnir, Arran,
told me the following story on the 28th of August 1895:--

'Bha na sifri a fuireach ’s an tom agus bha nabuidh aca agus bhiodh an
duine dol air cheilidh do thaigh nan sifri. Bha an duine a gabhail
beachd air doigh nan sifri agus a deanamh mar bhiodh iad a deanamh.

'Thog na sifri turas orra gu dol a dh’ Eirinn; agus thog an duine air gu
falbh leo. Rug a chuile sifri riamh air geo-astair, agus chaidh e
casa-gobhlach air a gheo-astair, agus a nunn cuan na h-Eire bha iad muin
air mhuin a chuile glun diubh ann an tiota, agus a nunn cuan na h-Eire
bha an duine as an deoghaidh casagobhlach air geo-astair mar aon do
chacha. Dh’ eubh sifri

'The fairies were dwelling in the knoll, and they had a near neighbour
who was wont to visit them in their home. The man used to observe the
ways of the fairies and to do as they did. The fairies took a journey
upon them to go to Ireland, and the man took upon him to go with them.
Every single fairy caught a ragwort and went astride the ragwort, and
they were pell-mell, every knee of them, across the Irish ocean in an
instant, and across the Irish ocean was the man after them, astride a
ragwort like one of the others. A little wee tiny fairy shouted and
asked were they all ready, and all the others replied that they were,
and the little fairy called out

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Follow me," said
the king of the fairies, and away they were across the Irish ocean, each
mother's son of them astride his ragwort. Macuga (Cook) did not know on
earth how he would return to his native land, but he leapt upon the
ragwort as he saw the fairies do, and he called as he heard them call,
and in an instant he was back in Arran. But he had got enough of the
fairies on this trip itself, and he never went with them again.'

The fairies were wont to take away infants and their mothers, and many
precautions were taken to safeguard them till purification and baptism
took place, when the fairy power became ineffective. Placing iron about
the bed, burning leather in the room, giving mother and child the milk
of a cow which had eaten of the

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'mothan,' and
similar means were taken to ensure their safety. Sometimes the
watching-women neglected these precautions, and the mother or child or
both were spirited away to the fairy bower. Many stories are current on
this subject.

Sometimes the fairies helped human beings with their work, coming in at
night to finish her spinning or her web for the house-wife, or to thresh
his corn or fan his grain for the houseman. On such occasions they must
not be molested nor interfered with, even in gratitude. If presented
with a garment they will go away and work no more. This method of
getting rid of them is sometimes resorted to, as it is not easy always
to find work for them.

'Bean chaol a chota uaine ’s na gruaige buidhe,' the slender woman of
the green kirtle and the yellow hair, is wise of head and deft of hand.
She can convert the white water of the rill into rich red wine, and the
threads of the spider into a tartan plaid. From the stalk of the fairy
reed she can bring the music of the lull of repose and peace, however
active the brain and lithe the limb; and she can rouse to mirth and
merriment, and to the dance, men and women, however dolorous their
condition. From the bower in the green hillock could be heard the pipe
and the song and the voice of laughter as they 'sett' and reeled in the
mazes of the dance. Sometimes a man seeing the wonderful light and
hearing the merry music, would be tempted to go in and join them, but
woe to him if he omitted to leave a piece of iron at the door of the
bower on entering, for the cunning fairies would close the door, and the
man would find no egress. There he would dance for years, but to him the
years were as one day--while his wife and family mourned him as dead.
'But faith is dead, and such things do not happen now'--so said my
courteous informant.

 

*Sleabhag*, *sleibheag*, *spleacan*, *spleicean*, mattock. This small
mattock is used in digging up carrots and the roots of native plants
used by the people in dyeing and tanning.

 

*Sleamhnan*, stye, inflamed tumour on the eyelid. It is variously called
'seamhnan,' 'sleamhran,' 'sleamhnagan,' 'sleamhragan,' 'leamhnan,'
'leamhran,' 'leamhranan,' 'leamhnadan,' 'neamhnad,' and 'neonad.'

 

*Sleamhnanachd*, *leamhnanachd*, exorcism of the stye, removing the stye
by occult power.

 

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

*Sliom*, buttercup. The buttercup was used as a poultice for swelling,
especially swelling in the sole of the foot.

The buttercup was believed to possess magical as well as medicinal
powers.

 

*Sliosrach*, slope, declivity; from 'slios,' a slope.

 

*Slisneach*, a plant like the 'slan-lus,' 'sla-lus,' 'la-lus,' self-heal
and ribwort.

 

*Sluagh*, 'the host,' the spirit-world. The 'hosts' are the, spirits of
mortals who have died. The people have many curious stories on this
subject. According to one informant, the spirits fly about "nan
sgrioslaich mhor, a sios agus a suas air uachdar an domhain mar na
truidean'--in great clouds, up and down the face of the world like the
starlings, and come back to the scenes of their earthly transgressions.
No soul of them is without the clouds of earth, dimming the brightness
of the works of God, nor can any win heaven till satisfaction is made
for the sins of earth. In bad nights, the hosts shelter themselves, 'fo
sgath chuiseaga bheaga ruadha agus bhuaghallain bheaga bhuidhe'--behind
little russet docken stems and little yellow ragwort stalks. They fight
battles in the air as men do on the earth. They may be heard and seen on
clear frosty nights, advancing and retreating, retreating and advancing,
against one another. After a battle, as I was told in Barra, their
crimson blood may be seen staining rocks and stones. ('Fuil nan sluagh,'
the blood of the hosts, is the beautiful red 'crotal' of the rocks
melted by the frost.) These spirits used to kill cats and dogs, sheep
and cattle, with their unerring venomous darts. They commanded men to
follow them, and men obeyed, having no alternative.

It was these men of earth who slew and maimed at the bidding of their
spirit-masters, who in return ill-treated them in a most pitiless
manner. 'Bhiodh iad ’gan loireadh agus ’gan loineadh agus ’gan luidreadh
anus gach lod, lud agus lon'--They would be rolling and dragging and
trouncing them in mud and mire and pools. 'There is less faith now, and
people see less, for

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

seeing is of faith. God grant to thee and to me, my dear, the faith of
the great Son of the lovely Mary.' This is the substance of a graphic
account of the 'sluagh,' given me in Uist by a bright old woman, endowed
with many natural gifts and possessed of much old lore. There are men to
whom the spirits are partial, and who have been carried off by them more
than once. A man in Benbecula was taken up several times. His friends
assured me that night became a terror to this man, and that ultimately
he would on no account cross the threshold after dusk. He died, they
said, from the extreme exhaustion consequent on these excursions. When
the spirits flew past his house, the man would wince as if undergoing a
great mental struggle, and fighting against forces unseen of those
around him. A man in Lismore suffered under precisely similar
conditions. More than once he disappeared mysteriously from the midst of
his companions, and as mysteriously reappeared utterly exhausted and
prostrate. He was under vows not to reveal what had occurred on these
aerial travels.

I took down several stories of persons who went with the 'hosts.' Here
is one of the stories of the 'hosts' summarised:--The beautiful daughter
of a king of France was taken up by the 'hosts,' and carried about in
the air, over lands and seas, continents and islands, till they came to
the little island of Heistamal, behind Creagorry, in Benbecula, where
they laid her down in such an injured state that she died from the hard
treatment; not, however, till she had told about the lands to which she
had been carried, and of the great hardships she had endured while
travelling through space. The people of the island buried the princess
where she was found.

The 'sluagh' are supposed to come from the west; and therefore, when a
person is dying, the door and the windows on the west side of the house
are secured to keep out the malicious spirits. In Ross-shire, the door
and windows of a house in which a person is dying are opened, in order
that the liberated soul may escape to heaven. In Killtarlity, when
children are being brought into the world, locks of chests and of doors
are opened, this being supposed, according to traditional belief, to
facilitate childbirth.

 

*Smeoirn*, arrow-head, arrow-point, the destructive end of the arrow.
\[The dictionaries make 'smeoirn' the butt end.\]

'Doire-donn,' brown grove, is in Glenorchy.

'Easragan' is in Airdchattan, near the priory where Bruce held his first
parliament, at which meeting Gaelic was the language used.

Margaret Campbell, daughter of Colin Campbell of Inver Easragan, was the
wife of John Macaulay, minister of Lismore, and the paternal grandmother
of Lord Macaulay. She was much beloved in Lismore, and her husband the
reverse. Old men in the island described John Macaulay as:--'Duine rag,
danarra, ceannlaidir, ceannsgallach--a huile duine cearr, ach esan a
mhain ceart'--A man obstinate, opinionative, dogmatic, domineering--all
men wrong, he alone right. A fellow-student said of Lord Macaulay:--'l
wish I were as cocksure of anything as Tom Macaulay is of everything.'
The infallibility would seem to have been inherited.

Loch Treig is in Lochaber. 'Baile nan gaillean,' 'Baile nan gaillbhinn,'
is said to be Dun-chaillionn--Dunkeld, famed for honey, beeswax, and
silk. 'Clann Pheidirean' (Patersons) had their forge at Creagan Corrach,
Fearrlochan, in Benderloch, about seven miles across Glensalach from
Easragan. They were famous armourers, their swords being celebrated for
their high finish and excellence. The native home of the
'MacPheidireans' was on the north side of Lochfyne, where they had been
numerous.

 

*Smeola*, the poetic name of the 'smeor,' 'smeorach,' thrush, mavis.

 

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

*Snaoth*, *snaodh*, *snaogh*, leader, chief, king. The people say that
all creatures have a 'ceann-snaoth,' head-chief. A certain fish is
'ceann-snaoth nan iasg,' the head-chief of the fish; a certain bird is
'ceann-snaoth nan ian,' the head-chief of the birds; a certain cow or
bull, 'ceann-snaoth nan ni,' the head-chief of the nowt; a certain
horse, 'ceann-snaoth nan each,' the head-chief of the steeds; and a
certain deer, 'ceann-snaoth nam fiadh,' head-chief of the deer.

A townland in South Uist is called 'Snaothaisbhal.' The place stands
prominently on the bank of the river Hough, which is here crowded with
salmon like sheep in a pen. These salmon may be seen moving about in the
shallow water, guided in their movements by a leader. Hence, according
to local etymology, the name of the farm--the fell of the leadership.

On the low-lying townland of Hough-beag on the opposite side of the
river are the ruins of the house of Neill MacEachain, father of Marshal
Macdonald, Duke of Tarentum. MacEachain was the patronymic of this sept
of the Macdonalds. After his escape to France with Prince Charlie, Neill
MacEachain reverted to his clan-name of Macdonald.

When Marshal Macdonald visited Britain in 1825 he went to see his
relatives, then as now numerous in South Uist. On coming in sight of the
river Hough, he raised his arm and exclaimed, 'That's the river Hough! I
know it from my father's description. Many a salmon my father killed
there.' Marshal Macdonald treated his numerous relatives with kindly
consideration, bestowing money on the more distant and annuities on the
more near. He carried away potatoes from his father's garden, and earth
and stones from his father's house. He cultivated the potatoes in his
own garden in France, and at his death the earth and stones were, at his
request, placed over his heart and buried with him.

 

*Soir*, *sear*, east, eastern.

A farm in North Uist, now a lop-sided island, is called 'Bailesear,'
easter-townland. The other side, which was called 'Bailesiar,'
wester-townland, lies submerged under the Atlantic. The ruins of the
houses of the submerged townland are occasionally seen under favourable
conditions of tide and atmosphere.

 

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

*Sola*, *soladh*, food, broken food--whelks, cockles, limpets, mussels,
and other shell-fish broken and thrown into the sea to attract fish. The
Lady Amie, wife of John, Lord of the Isles, sent men round the islands
to make hollows in the rocks in which the people might break shell-fish
and prepare bait. Such pits are called 'toll solaidh,' bait holes. These
mortars resemble cup cuttings, for which antiquarians have mistaken
them.

 

*Somh*, *somha*, convert, convince, controvert, overturn, upset, render
of no avail; *cf*. 'soim,' Windisch's *Wörterbuch*.

 

*Soplachan*, wisp, tuft, sustenance; a handful of corn in the ear given
to a weak animal; from 'sop,' wisp. Sometimes the 'soplachan' is
suspended from a stake beside the animal, sometimes from the neck of the
animal to enable it to nibble at the wisp while lying down. Mrs Clark,
Torr-an-damh, makes effective use of this term:--

*Sorchar*, *sorachar*, brightness, a clear man, from 'sorch,' clear, and
'fear,' a man, the reverse of 'dorchar,' 'dorachar,' darkness, a dark
man. The initials *d* and *s* are often in opposition, as 'dorch,' dark,
'sorch,' clear; 'doilleir,' obscure, 'soilleir,' light; 'dolas,' grief,
'solas,' joy; 'doirbh,' difficult, 'soirbh,' easy; 'dubhailc,' vice,
'subhailc,' virtue; 'duathar,' darkness, 'suathar,' lightness; 'dolair,'
withhold, 'solair,' provide; 'dochair,' wrong, 'sochair,' right.

'Sorchar' may mean Christ, 'the Light of the World,' or Michael, 'the
Light of the Mountains' (vol. i. p. 66). A belief prevails among
Highlanders that every person is attended by an angel of light or by an
angel of darkness--by a good or by a bad angel; that during sleep the
soul of the good accompanied by the angel of light ascends to the gates
of heaven there to foresee the bliss awaiting the good and brave; and
that the soul of the bad accompanied by the bad angel descends to the
gates of hell, there to listen to the wailing of those who had followed
evil courses and wicked ways.

There is a story told of a man whose soul returned after wandering
through the regions of time and space. The soul alighted on the face of
the man, in the form of a bee or a butterfly, and was about to enter its
home in the body through

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

the pathway of the mouth when a neighbour killed it. One version of the
story says that the body of the man died when his soul was killed;
another version says that the body of the man lingered long in the land
after the soul was dead, busying itself up and down the earth, carrying
the substance of the dead soul in its left and the shadow of its
withered heart in its right hand.

Probably this is not the only instance of the body existing after the
soul is dead.

 

*Speach*, a stone, a doorstep, a flat stone in a byre door, a certain
stone in a byre drain. 'Speach na bathcha,' the doorstep of the byre.
Dim. 'speachag.' 'Tilg speachag air a bhoin,' throw a stone at the cow.
A form of 'spitheag,' a little stone.

 

*Speach*, a claw, a hoof, an animal, perhaps akin to 'speir,' a shank.

'Strol' is mentioned in a song said to have been composed by a girl in
Barra, whose relatives were massacred by the Norsemen, and she herself
carried away captive:--

The word occurs also in 'Bron Binn,' one of several Arthurian ballads
current in the isle:--

*Stapag*, Scots 'stappack,' a mixture of meal and cream, or of milk, or
of cold water. An old lullaby (*cf*. [p. 239](cg2106.htm#page_239))
says:--

The north end of the island of Skye is called Trotarnis, Trondarnais,
Thrond's peninsula. The district is fertile and was once abundant in
corn. It was the granary of the Macdonalds of the Isles, whose land it
was. The Macleods of Duirinish facetiously called the district of
Trotarnis, 'Duthaich nan stapag,' the country of the stappacks; 'Am
fearann stapagach,' the land of the stappacks. The Macdonalds retorted,
calling Duirinish 'Duthaich nam mogais,' 'Duthaich nam mogan,' the
country of the footless stockings; 'Am fearann mogasach,' and 'Am
fearann moganach,' the land of the footless stockings.

 

*Staing*, stance, site, situation, moat, ditch, fort, stronghold, an
impregnable position, a sacred enclosure, a sacred ring; gap in a wall,
rock, or mountain; distress, difficulty.

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

It occurs in place-names, as Staing at the foot of Ben-Ledi. Is-staing,
a place-name in Killtarlity, is shortened from Inis-staing, meadow of
the 'stang.'

 

*Stear*, *stearr*, *steair*, a pole like the butt of a salmon-rod, used
in killing birds. The 'steairear,' 'stearair,' pole-man, sits on the
edge of the cliff, his legs overhanging the Atlantic several hundred
feet below. As the bird flies within reach overhead the man strikes it
with the pole. The stunned bird tumbles down behind and is thrappled by
a dog, and laid with the others.

The bird that thus flies overhead is the puffin, in St Kilda called
'buite,' and in Miunghlaidh 'buigire.' A day with a strong inland wind
is selected for this work. 'Steaireadh' is eminently dangerous, a slight
swerve, a false stroke, causing destruction.

 

*Steill*, shelf, bracket.

<div align="center">

|                                  |     |                                |
|----------------------------------|-----|--------------------------------|
| 'Thoir an gunna thar na steill.' |     | Take the gun off the bracket.  |
| 'Cuir an cuman air an steill.'   |     | Place the pail upon the shelf. |

</div>

 

*Stic*, imp, demon. 'Droch stir,' evil imp; 'stic an donais,' imp of the
devil; 'stic an deamhain mhoir,' imp of the great demon; 'stic taighe,'
house imp; 'stic starsaich,' doorstep imp, generally applied to a
quarrelsome woman, occasionally to a quarrelsome man.

 

*Stiom*, snood. The snood was a narrow white band of silk, satin, linen,
or wool worn round the head of maidens. The snood was the badge of the
maiden as the kertch was that of the matron. Frequent mention is made of
the snood and the kertch, and s

frill, fragment, beard, thin beard.

sheep.

term occurs in an Arthurian ballad obtained in Uist in 1865:--

*Stringlein*, *stringleir*, strangles, a disease which affects, but is
not confined to, horses. Although neither so dangerous nor so
disagreeable as glanders, strangles is infectious and odorous. The
people say that strangles was rare and glanders unknown in the Highlands
before the introduction of Lowland horses. Highland horses, cattle, and
sheep being hardier, are less liable to disease than the softer Lowland
breeds.

 

*Strūan*, *strūthan*, *strūdhan*, is the name applied to the cake made
on St Michael's Eve and eaten on St Michael's Day.

*Suaircein*, the name of a bird.

 

*Sūith*, *sūithe*, soot. (Vol. i. page 284 ff.)

Eggs set are marked with soot to distinguish them from eggs which may be
intruded. Should a stray egg become mixed with the setting it is later
in being hatched, and the chicken is called 'isean deire linn,' chick
after brood. Such an occurrence is a bad omen for the eldest daughter of
the family, and a sign that she will not be married, or if married that
she will be childless. The girl concerned examines the nest daily to see
that no such egg is intruded.

In some places girls used to make bannocks of soot and salt, and place
them under their pillows on Hallow Eve, that they might dream of their
lovers.

 

*Suil*, *droch shuil*, eye, evil eye. When a person admires or covets a
thing, the owner says, 'Fluich do shuil ma lean e rithe'--Wet your eye
lest it sticks to it, *i.e.* in case you have the evil eye, and the
thing becomes yours or dwindles away.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

*Sul*, *sult*, fat, fatness, condition, good condition; derivatives of
'sul'--'sultan' and 'sultag.' The first is applied to a fat little boy
or male beast, the last to a fat little girl or female beast.

A Gaelic conundrum says--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This description
is not wholly accurate, the black snail being not only fat but
nutritious. In Cornwall and elsewhere it is used in consumption, and
with good results.

Probably the badger is the animal meant. (Vol. i. p. 314.) The flesh of
the badger was eaten and prized in olden times. In her beautiful lament
at leaving Alban, Deirdire says--

The harvest moon is variously called 'gealach gheal an abuchaidh,' the
ripening white moon; 'gealach fin na Feill Micheil,' the fair moon of
the Michael Feast; and 'gealach bhuidhe nam broc,' the yellow moon of
the badgers. The badger is then in best condition, before he retires to
his winter retreat. When the badger emerges in spring, he is thin and
emaciated. He never comes out in winter, unless upon a rare occasion
when a dry sunny day may tempt him out to air his hay bedding. The
intelligence with which the badger brings out his bedding, shakes it in
the sun, airs it in the wind, and carries it back again to his home, is
interesting and instructive.

The badger is now rare in Scotland, being only seen occasion-ally in the
Highlands and on the Border.

From the fact that all grazing animals are then in best condition,
October is called 'mios sultain,' month of fatness.
