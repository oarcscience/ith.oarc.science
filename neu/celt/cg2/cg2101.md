### AM BREID \[215\]

'AM BREID,' the kertch or coif, was a square of linen formed into a cap
and donned by a woman on the morning after her marriage. It was the sign
of wifehood as the 'stiom,' snood, was the emblem of maidenhood. The
linen of the kertch was pure white and very fine. The square was
arranged into three angles symbolic of the Trinity, under whose guidance
the young wife was to walk. From this it is called 'currachd
tri-chearnach'--three-cornered cap. The kertch was fastened to the hair
with cords of silk or pins of silver or of gold. It is said to have been
very becoming and picturesque. It is mentioned in many of the sayings of
the people as:--'breid ban'--white kertch; 'breid cuailean'--hair
kertch; 'breid beannach'--pinnacled kertch; 'breid an crannaig'--kertch
on props; 'breid cuimir nan crun,' the shapely coif of the crowns; and
'breid cuimir nan tri crun'--the shapely coif of the three crowns. It is
also spoken of in many songs.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The song from
which this last verse is quoted had curious wanderings and narrow
escapes--from Lochaber to Lahore, from Lahore to Lochalsh, and from
Lochalsh to Skye and Uist. It was taken down at Howmore, South Uist,
from Peggie Macaulay, better known as Peggie Robertson and 'Peigi
Sgiathanach'--Skye

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Peggie. She came
from 'Sleibhte riabhach nam ban boidheach,'--brindled Sleat of the
beautiful women, and well upheld the reputation of her native place, for
she was a tall, straight, comely brunette, with beautiful brown eyes and
hair 'like raven's plumage, smoothed on snow.' She had accompanied her
master and mistress, Captain and Mrs Macdonald, Knock, Skye, on a visit
to Sir John Macrae, Airdantouil, Lochalsh. Sir John was famed for his
symmetry, bravery, and accomplishments. He inherited the musical talents
of the Macleods of Raarsey, and could play a phenomenal number of
musical instruments. He was wont to say that there was no music for the
house equal to Highland music, nor instrument for the field equal to the
Highland bagpipe. Sir John had been military attaché to his cousin, the
Marquis of Hastings, when he was Governor-General of India. From Sir
John Macrae, Peggie Macaulay heard the words of this song and an account
of how he got them. Sir John said that when in India he was sent with
despatches to a distant fort. As he was nearing the gate under cover of
night, he was surprised to hear a Gaelic song once heard in childhood
and often sought since. When he reined in his horse to listen, the
sentry stopped his song and challenged. The answer was given in Gaelic,
and the sentry was surprised in his turn. Macrae was just in time to
rouse the Governor from his fancied security and to lead the garrison to
repel an attack, in which the singer Eoghan Cameron fell after killing
seven sepoys single-handed.

Sir John Macrae died soon after Peggie Macaulay heard him singing the
song, and she died soon after the song was taken down from her dictation
by the present writer. Sir John Macrae called this song, 'treas taladh
na h-Alba,'--the third lullaby of Alban, and as sung by bright Peggie
Robertson it merited praise.
