### O

*Ōb*, *ōba*, *ōbi*, spell, charm, incantation; gen. 'oib,' 'oibe'; pl.
'obagan,' 'oibeagan '; dim. 'obag,' 'oibeag.' Also 'ub,' 'uba'; gen.
'uib,' 'uibe'; pl. 'uibe,' 'ubagan,' 'uibeagan'; dim. 'ubag,' 'uibeag.'
'Oban,' pl. 'obanan,' wizard, also 'uibean,' pl. 'uibeanan,' 'fear
uibe'; 'obag,' dim. 'obagag,' pl. 'obagan,' witch, also 'uibeag,'
'uibeagan,' 'bean uibe.' 'Mairi bhreac nan ob,' spotted (or pock-marked)
Mary of the spells. 'Bis i ris na h-ob'--She practises spells. 'Tha na
h-ob a dol as'--Spells are going out of use.

The Gaelic 'ubadh' occurs in the glosses of Klosterneuberg, Austria
(eighth-ninth centuries) as 'auphtha.'

It is curious that a spell used in British Central Africa for the evil
eye is also called 'obi.'

 

*Od*, *oda*, *odaidh*, race, racecourse, the scene of the athletics of
the men and the racing of the horses. Possibly connected with the Norse
*at*, horse-fight; *hesta at*, horse-driving; *etja hestum*,
horse-driving, horse-battle.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

In Norway, the horse-fight took place in August, on Lovisæ Dag, the
horse-combat finishing up the sports of the festival. By a curious
coincidence, the horse-races of Norway and the principal horse-race of
the Western Isles, that of South Uist, ceased in the same year, 1820,
and in two succeeding months.

A plain near Loch Snizort, a plain near Glendale, and a plain in
Minginis, Skye, are called 'odaig,' racecourse, horse racecourse.

The last great 'oda' occurred in Barra in 1828, in South Uist in 1820,
in Benbecula in 1830, in North Uist in 1866, and in Harris in 1818. In
the Small Isles the 'oda' continued later, while occasional 'oda' have
been held in all these places since the years mentioned.

In Barra the 'oda' was held on the 25th September, being the Day of St
Barr, the patron saint of the island; in all the other places on 29th
September, being the Day of St Michael, the patron saint of horses and
of the Isles.

In Barra the sports were held on 'Traigh Bharra,' Strand of St Barr; in
South Uist, on 'Traigh Mhicheil,' Strand of St Michael; in Benbecula, on
'Machair Bhaile-mhanaich,' plain of the townland of the monks; in North
Uist, on 'Traigh Mhoire,' Strand of St Mary; and in Harris, on 'Traigh
Chliamain,' Strand of St Clement.

All these places are singularly adapted for man-racing, horse-racing,
and other sports.

'Oda nan gillean,' race of the youths; 'oda nan each,' race of the
horses; 'each oda,' racehorse; 'ramh oda,' 'oda ramh,' oar-race.

Horse-racing, 'grafand,' pl. 'graifne,' formed part of the sport at the
ancient Irish gatherings (Joyce, Social History, II., 462).

 

*Odharan*, *Odhran*, *Odran*, *Oran*, Oran, St Oran; also the name of St
Patrick's charioteer.

There are several places named after Oran, as 'Killoran' in Colonsay;
'Tiroran,' the land of Oran in Mull.

The principal burying-ground in Iona is called 'Reilig Odhrain,' the
burying-place of Oran. It is also called 'Reilig nan Righ,' the
burying-place of the kings. The people tell a tradition how this place
came to be named after St Oran. Versions of the tradition were taken
down in places widely apart.

'Dhuisg carmasg agus connspuinn eadar Calum-cille agus

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Odhran mu

'Chaidh Odhran a sios dh’an uaigh agus lionadh an uaigh thairis air.

'An ceann nan tri la agus nan tri oidhche thubhairt Calumcille gun robh

'Chuireadh an uir a rithist air Odhran agus thiodhlaiceadh e.

'Ghuil Calum-cille gu tursach trom, agus shil na deoir gu frasach fial

'Sin an ceud neach a thiodhlaiceadh anns an ionad sin agus thugadh

'Contention and controversy awoke between Columba and Oran about the
merits of heaven and the demerits of hell, the happiness of the good and
the unhappiness of the bad. Oran said that he would put the matter to
the test in the place whereon they stood, and that he would go for the
space of three days and three nights down to the grave (hell). Digging
implements were procured, and a grave was dug as deep down as Oran was
high up. Oran went down into the grave, and the earth was filled over
him.

'At the end of the three days and the three nights Columba

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

said that it would be seemly to look upon Oran, and he was looked upon
accordingly.

On the opening of the eyes to him Oran said:--

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The earth was
again placed upon Oran, and he was buried permanently.

'Columba wept sorrowfully, heavily, and shed the tears showeringly,
generously, because Oran tender, lovable, faithful, and earnest, went to
death.

'That was the first person who was buried in that place, and the name
"Burial-place of Oran" was given to it. A chapel was placed on Oran, and
"Temple of Oran" was given as a name to the chapel.'

There may be some truth in this tradition, although probably much
altered. The period of three days and three nights in the grave is
symbolic of Christ. Probably human sacrifices were placed under the
foundation-wall of St Oran's Temple, whether or not Oran was the name of
the man sacrificed. Human sacrifices were placed under buildings in
ancient Greece and Rome, and under buildings in modern England, Ireland,
and Scotland. A well-known Greek case was that of the Bridge of Arta,
which only stood secure after the master-builder had placed his own wife
beneath the foundation. It is said that when building the manse of
Killtarlity the mason seized a passing woman and placed her under the
foundation-stone of the building. The woman uttered curses upon the
building, and upon those who would dwell therein. A Gaelic proverb
says:--

A man known as 'Lachlan Og,' 'Lachlann Ogi,' young Lachlan, was in the
army in Ireland. He eloped with a young

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

lady, whose brothers pursued them. While he was defending himself
against her brothers, the lady went in behind him for protection, where
she was struck and killed by a blow from his sword. He was put in
prison, and while there he composed a beautiful song known as 'Mali
bheag og,' young little May.

'Lachlan Og' became insane, and on being liberated he made his way to
Lorn. He wandered about the country, making Killchrenan the centre of
his circuiting. He never entered a house, never asked for food, and
never spoke. When the people knew that he was about, they left food for
him in well-known retreats--which were simply depressions among the
rocks and hillocks--summer and winter. In his wanderings the hapless man
was seized at Bunawe, and placed under the pier building for an English
iron-smelting company.

Some say that 'Lachlan Og' was placed under the foundation of Bunawe
House, built by the same company, and not under the pier. In support of
this the saying of the famous seer 'Guala Chrosda' is quoted:--

(In a deep pool behind the house quantities of human bones have been
found. Hence the name, Pool of bones, Lakelet of bones.)

These traditions are circumstantially related and believed.

When the practice of sacrificing men and women fell into disuse, birds
and animals were substituted. It was reported a few years ago that a
builder placed a cock beneath the wall of a church in one of the midland
counties of England.

 

*Omhan*, whey whisked into froth, especially the richer whey pressed out
of the curds.

 

*Ōr*, *ōrtha*, prayer, rhymed prayer, hymn, supplication, petition,
incantation; pl. 'or,' 'ora,' 'orthachan,' 'orrachan.' 'Domhull beag nan
or,' Little Donald of the supplications.

The word following gives the purpose of the petition as 'ora

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

bhais,' death spell; 'ora ghonaidh,' wounding incantation; 'ora
sheamlachais,' a charm to induce one cow to take to the calf of another;
'ora bhalbh,' spell to silence an opponent; 'ora ghrudaireachd,' spell
to spoil another's brewing; 'ora ghlas ghuib,' spell to lock an enemy's
mouth; 'ora na h-Aona,' spell of the Friday; 'ora stoirm,' spell to
raise a storm to drown a foe.

When the lady of Maclean of Duart heard that her lord was holding
dalliance with the dark-eyed Princess Viola of Spain, her heart burned
within her. She sent for Doiteag, the arch-sorceress of Mull, who
undertook to raise a storm which would sink the Spanish ship at her
anchor in the land-locked bay of Tobermory. Doiteag did this, and
drowned all the Spaniards but saved all the Scots on board. It is said
that people from Mull and Morvern were on the deck of the *Florida* when
the ship was blown up into the air and the deck came down close to the
shore, the natives of the country being uninjured. Martin says that one
of the Beaton physicians of Mull was among those thus miraculously
saved. Many stories are still told in Mull and Morvern about the
*Florida* and the Spanish Armada.

'Or' and 'ob' are used indiscriminately, the people not now
differentiating between them. A grassy declivity behind the village in
St Kilda was called 'Liana nan or' and 'Liana nan ob,' the lawn of the
prayers, and the lawn of the incantations. The community collected their
herds there to sain and lustrate them, from the 'cear,' blood one, or
the 'cearb,' killing one.

A tombstone in St Oran's, Iona, bears the inscription, 'Or Do Mail
Fatric,' in modern Gaelic 'or do Maolphatric,' a prayer for Maolpatric.
Another has the inscription, 'or ar anmin Eogain,' in modern Gaelic, 'or
air anam Eoghain,' a prayer for the soul of Ewen.

 

*Ora*, *orag*, *odharag*, the young of birds while in the downy stage,
especially the young of the swan, the shag, and the cormorant. From
'odhar,' dun.

 

*Orc*, a pig; 'oircean,' 'uircean,' a young pig. 'Orc' was another name
for the whale. The sea north-east of the Long Island was known to the
old people as 'Cuan nan Orc,' the sea of the orcs. In charts this sea is
known as the Greater Minch.

The Gaelic name of the Orkney Isles is 'Orcaibh,' 'Arcaibh,' the isles
of whales, Orcades; the Orkney seas, like the Minch, being subject to
frequent visits from whales.
