*Tachar*, *tacar*, heap, quantity, fruitage. 'Fhuair thu tachar
eisg'--Thou hast got a heap of fish. 'Fhuair mi tachar ian'--I got a
number of birds.

 

*Tachradh*, produce, substance; from 'tachar,' quantity.

*Tāchran*, *tācharan*, a kelpie, a water-sprite, a dwarf--one of the
many supernatural beings with which the Gaidheal peopled the glens and
woods, streams and lakes.

A place in Islay is called 'Clachan an tacharain,' the ford of the
kelpie; and one in Perth is called 'Poll an tacharain,' the pool of the
kelpie.

The term occurs in the touching lament of a Kintail woman whose husband
was slain by Donald Macdonald, known as 'Domhull odhar,' dun Donald, 'an
tacharan,' the dwarf, and Finlay Macrae, known as 'Fionnladh dubh nam
fiadh,' black Finlay of the deer:

'Tachran cuthaig,' 'tachan cuthaig,' the page of the cuckoo--generally
the meadow-pipit. When the cuckoo sings, the pipit emits a hissing sound
resembling 'tach! tach! tach!' This may have originated the name in this
case.

 

*Taghan*, polecat, foumart. The polecat is detested for its
destructiveness and evil odour. It is now nearly extinct in the
Highlands.

 

*Tail*, *taileadh*, *sail*, *saileadh*, cause, sake of, on account of.
'Fhuair mise trod air taileadh do ghnothaich'--I got a scolding on
account of thy business. 'Tha mi air taileadh mo ghnothaich fhein'--I am
after my own business.

 

*Taimhlisg*, traduce, contemn. 'Is tu an taimhlisg'; this might mean a
traducing person or one worthy of being traduced.

 

*Tairbhein*, *teirbhein*, *tailbhein*, *teilbhein*, surfeit; also a
bloody flux in cattle; possibly from 'dairb' or 'deirb,' water-insect,
spider, which when swallowed is supposed to cause bleeding.

 

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

*Talmaich*, honour, obeisance; from 'talm,' to obey, to honour.

 

*Tarbh boidhre*, a monster, a demon, a god capable of changing himself
into many forms--a man, a bull, a horse, or other animal with
supernatural powers.

 

*Tarman*, *torman*, ptarmigan, preferably 'tarmigan,' murmur-bird; from
'tarm,' or 'torm,' murmur, and 'ian,' bird. Derivatives--'tarmach,'
'tormach,' 'tarmachan,' 'tormachan,' murmuring bird.

The tarmigan is ruddy, mottled grey in summer, changing to pure
snow-white in winter. It confines itself to the summits of high hills,
never coming down to the glens except under severe pressure of continued
snow. Like a true patriot it contests its country inch by inch against
the invading enemy and, if defeated, is never discomfited.

To the uninitiated the tarmigan is indistinguishable from its habitat.
In 1877 the writer went up to examine the beach-like shingly appearance
of the summit of a hill in Harris. On the top of the mountain my
companion drew my attention to tarmigans among the stones before us. I
could hear the murmur, but could not see the birds, nor differentiate
between them and the shingle before us, till they began to move, then to
run, and ultimately to fly. The atmosphere was clear, the sun was
bright, and not a breath of air on the hill nor a speck of cloud in the
sky, but my companion said that a snowstorm was coming on. He insisted
on immediate descent, and, incredulous, I reluctantly followed. In less
than an hour the bright sun began to disappear, and the sky began to
darken and blacken, and in less than another hour a raging storm of snow
was on, lasting three days and three nights without intermission.

My companion said that he knew by the peculiar plaint and mode of flight
of the tarmigans that a snowstorm was approaching.

 

*Tarmach-de*, *tarmachan-de*, the white butterfly, rarely the
white-and-black butterfly.

 

*Teanga*, tongue, voice, speech, oratory. 'Teanga Chaluim-chille,' the
oratory of Columba (vol. i. p. 56). Columba had a powerful voice
'clearly heard at fifteen hundred paces.' It is said that he could be
heard in Mull when preaching in Iona, more than a mile across the sea.
Probably the famous Dr Macdonald, Ferintosh, 'the Apostle of the North,'
was the greatest Gaelic orator since Columba, to whom he has been
likened. Dr Macdonald and the

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

late Sir John A. Macdonald, Premier of Canada, another orator of renown,
were sons of two crofter brothers evicted from Sutherlandshire.

 

*Teanacsa*, avert, safeguard, ward away. 'Teanacsa gorta,' avert famine;
'teanacsa dosgain,' ward away misfortune from cattle, protect from
danger, distress, or difficulty.

 

*Teasdam*, I preserve, secure, keep, help, assist.

 

*Teilg*, *teilig*, a chord, string of a lyre, of a harp, or other
stringed instrument.

 

*Teilin*, *teilinn*, a musical instrument, a stringed instrument. Welsh
'telu,' a harp.

 

*Teine*, fire. (Vol. i. p. 174.)

*Tein-ēigin*, neid-fire, need-fire, forced fire, fire produced by the
friction of wood or iron against wood.

The fire of purification was kindled from the neid-fire, while the
domestic fire on the hearth was rekindled from the purification fire on
the knoll. Among other names, the purification fire was called 'Teine
Bheuil,' fire of Beul, and 'Teine mor Bheuil,' great fire of Beul. The
fire of Beul was divided into two fires between which people and cattle
rushed australly for purposes of purification. The ordeal was trying, as
may be inferred from phrases still current. 'Is teodha so na teine
teodha Bheuil'--Hotter is this than the hot fire of Beul. Replying to
his grandchild, an old man in Lewis said:--'A Mhoire! mhicean, bu dhurra
dhomh-sa sin a dheana dhusa na dhol eadar dha theine mhor Bheuil'--Mary!
sonnie, it were worse for me to do that for thee than to go between the
two great fires of Beul.

The neid-fire was resorted to in imminent or actual calamity upon the
first day of the quarter, and to ensure success in great or important
events.

The writer conversed with several persons who saw the neid-fire

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

made, and who joined in the ceremony. As mentioned elsewhere, a woman in
Arran said that her father, and the other men of the townland, made the
neid-fire on the knoll on 'La buidhe Bealltain'--Yellow Day of Beltane.
They fed the fire from 'cuaile mor conaidh caoin'--great bundles of
sacred faggots brought to the knoll on Beltane Eve. When the sacred fire
became kindled, the people rushed home and brought their herds and drove
them through and round the fire of purification, to sain them from the
'bana bhuitseach mhor Nic Creafain,'--the great arch witch daughter
Cranford, Mac Creafain, now Crawford.

That was in the second decade of the nineteenth century.

John Macphail, Middlequarter, North Uist, said that the last occasion on
which the neid-fire was made in North Uist was 'bliadhna an t-sneachda
bhuidhe'--the year of the yellow snow--1829 (?). The snow lay so deep
and remained so long on the ground, that it became yellow. Some suggest
that the snow was originally yellow, as snow is occasionally red. This
extraordinary continuance of snow caused much want and suffering
throughout the Isles.

The people of North Uist extinguished their own fires and generated a
purification fire at Sail Dharaich, Sollas. The fire was produced from
an oak log by rapidly boring with an auger. This was accomplished by the
exertions of 'naoi naoinear ciad ginealach mac'--the nine nines of
first-begotten sons. From the neid-fire produced on the knoll the people
of the parish obtained fire for their dwellings. Many cults and
ceremonies were observed on the occasion, cults and ceremonies in which
Pagan and Christian beliefs intermingled.

'Sail Dharaich,' Oak Log, obtained its name from the log of oak for the
neid-fire being there. A fragment of this log riddled with auger holes
marks a grave in 'Cladh Sgealoir,' the burying-ground of 'Sgealoir,' in
the neighbourhood.

Mr Alexander Mackay, Edinburgh, a native of Reay, Sutherland, says:--'My
father was the skipper of a fishing crew. Before beginning operations
for the season, the crew of the boat met at night in our house to settle
accounts for the past, and to plan operations for the new season. My
mother and the rest of us were sent to bed. I lay in the kitchen, and
was listening and watching, though they thought I was asleep. After the
men had settled their past affairs and future plans, they put out the
fire on the hearth, not a spark being allowed to live. They then rubbed

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

two pieces of wood one against another so rapidly as to produce fire,
the men joining in one after the other, and working with the utmost
energy and never allowing the friction to relax. From this friction-fire
they rekindled the fire on the hearth, from which all the men present
carried away a kindling to their own homes.

'Whether their success was due to their skill, their industry, their
perseverance, or to the neid-fire, I do not know, but I know that they
were much the most successful crew in the place. They met on Saturday,
and went to church on Sunday like the good men and the good Christians
they were--a little of their Pagan faith mingling with their Christian
belief. I have reason to believe that other crews in the place as well
as my father's crew practised the neid-fire.'

A man at Helmsdale, Sutherland, saw the 'tein-eigin' made in his
boyhood.

The neid-fire was made in North Uist about the year 1829, in Arran about
1820, in Helmsdale about 1818, in Reay about 1830.
