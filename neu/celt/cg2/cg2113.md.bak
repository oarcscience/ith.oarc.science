### L

*Lach*, duck. The duck meant is the long-tailed duck, which is known by
a variety of descriptive names:--'beul-binn,' sweet mouth; 'caothail,'
wailer; 'ian-binn,' bird of melody; 'lacha-liath,' blanched grey duck;
'lacha-stiurach,' rudder-duck; 'ian buchuinn'--preferably
'buck-f huinn'--song-bird of the sea, from bird, 'buch,' 'boch,' swollen
(referring to the sea), and 'f huinn,' gen. of 'fonn,' melody, refrain.
From cognate causes May is called 'Mi Buchuinn,' month of swelling,
month of bursting forth, 'Buchuinn Moire,' swelling of Mary, and
'Buchuinn buidhe Moire nam buadh,' the yellow swelling month of the Mary
of grace; 'Buchuinn Bealltain,' swelling of Beltane; 'Buchuinn buidhe
Bealltain,' yellow swelling of Beltane; *cf*., however, 'boch,' hey-day,
'bochail,' proud, nimble.

'Lacha-stiurach,' rudder-duck, is applied to the bird because its long
tail resembles a long oar steering a boat. Yet the bird manages its tail
amid the wild waves of the sea with the same easy grace that the
pheasant manages its tail among the rough branches of the trees, and the
lady her train amid the mazes of the dance. The long-tailed duck is
singularly graceful and melodious. In colour it is the water-wagtail, in
form the pheasant, and in song the nightingale, of the sea.

On arriving, from its summer sheiling in the north, at its winter
homestead in the south, the long-tailed duck utters a few short
syllables, sharp and impatient at the beginning, prolonged and modulated
towards the end. The bird frequents the islands of Tiree and Coll, but
is rarely seen elsewhere in the seas or sounds of the Inner Hebrides. It
keeps to the open sounds of the Outer Hebrides, while its congener, the
pin-tailed duck, keeps still further out and exclusively to the open
Atlantic, being rarely seen within the Outer Sounds. The two places most
familiar to me as the habitat of the long-tailed duck are the Sound of
Barra and the Sound of Harris, forty-four miles apart. In crossing these
stormy straits of the Atlantic, I often observed the evident enjoyment
of these beautiful birds in the tumult of waters. The more the stately
mountainous waves, snow-white, foaming, roaring, broke over them, the
more evident their delight

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

in the battle of the billows, like a band of maidens amidst a battle of
flowers.

In Tiree the people set small lines along the strand when the tide is
out, to catch flounders and other flat fish. When the tide is in the
long-tailed ducks dive for fry and sand-eels, and are caught on the
hooks and drowned. During a visit to my friend and fellow-collector of
folk-lore, the late Rev. Mr Campbell of Tiree, I saw at Hianaish, on the
23rd September 1887, seven of these graceful birds which had been
drowned on one set of lines in one day.

In the island of Bearnarey (Bernera), in the Sound of Harris, there is a
sept of people called Clann ’Ic Anndaidh--Clan Macandy. The sept
consists now of only a few families--most of them having left, being
dissatisfied with the hard rocky and sterile sandy nature of the place.
Local legend says that one half of the Macandys were keen lovers of the
land, with its plants and animals, and declared by the golden sun that
rules the day; while the other half were keen lovers of the sea, with
its plants and living creatures, and declared by the silvery moon and
twinkling stars that rule the night. The sea-loving section laughed at
the land-loving section, and in her resentment at their scoffing the
witch of the land-lovers struck the sea-lovers with her 'slacan
druidheachd,' druidic wand, and placed them 'fo gheasaibh,' under
enchantment, and ever since then one sept of the Macandys are swimming
on the sea, diving in the deep, and flying in the air, like gleams of
light, while their kinsmen and clansmen are grubbing in the ground like
earth-worms, their fellow-mortals.

The people of Bearnarey allege that the long-tailed ducks are the
enchanted section of the Macandy tribe, and that the birds hail their
kinsmen in the loud long laughter of their hearts with greetings which
have been converted into human language. The following is attributed by
his people to Sir Norman Macleod of Bearnarey, knighted on the field of
Worcester:--

*Lacha Mhoire*, Mary's duck. The mallard goes by various names, as
'lacha-ghlas,' grey duck; 'lacha-riabhach,' brindled duck;
'lacha-ruadh,' russet duck; 'lath a chinn-uaine,' duck of the green
head.

The common grey duck is among the first and the last birds to breed. It
has young as early as the first week of April and as late as the last
week of September. The subterfuges, tactics, and stratagems of the grey
duck to save its young are amusing and instructive. No human mother in
presence of a Solomon could show more tender solicitude. The people
speak lovingly of Mary's duck, and would not willingly hurt it in the
breeding season.

When the mallard rises on the wing, it goes round and round, enlarging
the circle as it ascends, and then stretches away as straight as an
arrow with matchless speed. The people maintained that Mary's duck is
the swiftest bird in the 'ealtain,' 'ealt nan ian,' bird-world, world of
the birds.

 

*Lacha shith*, teal, elf-duck; from 'lath,' duck, and 'sith,' elf; also
'crion-lath,' tit-duck; 'crann-lach,' dwarf-duck; and 'lath eigir,' puny
duck (see Eigir).

The teal is the smallest British duck. It is numerous in the Isles in
winter, but rare in summer. The arrival of the teal is supposed to
indicate the coming of a storm, and when the bird is seen approaching
the shore the people hasten to secure their crops and houses.

The teal might be called the page of the swan, and more justly the pest
of the swan. When swans are feeding, teals attend them, gliding about in
and out, out and in, among them, picking up the animalcula brought up by
the swans. Occasionally

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

an audacious teal may be seen seizing a morsel from the mouth of a swan
and swimming away a few feet. The noble bird rarely heeds this audacity;
but when it does give a 'wheeze,' the intruder scurries away--this time
several yards. It coolly returns immediately, however, probably feeling
that the swan is too dignified to cherish resentment.

 

*Lannair*, *lainnir*, lanner, falcon, peregrine falcon; founded on
'lann,' a blade, a spear, a lance.

Men singed their beards, and failing beards, their hair, to sain them
from birds of prey. Possibly this was in imitation of the three young
men who went through the fiery furnace. When a boy is well behaved he is
told:--'Cha tog an t-seobhag thu'--The hawk will not lift thee. The
following fragment mentions other birds:

The following scene was described to me by Donald Macmurdoch, crofter,
Bailemeadhonach, Islay, a most observant naturalist:--

'I was going along the road at Easter Eilister, and observed a flock of
blue pigeons alight on a field of newly sown turnips. They had hardly
alighted when they hurriedly rose. But instead of making for the
sea-cliffs below, they ascended in a confused mass, shooting up in leaps
and bounds, after the manner of the lark.

'I knew by the trepidation of the pigeons that an enemy was near, and
looking round I saw the lanner coming from Tairteval and making straight
for the pigeons. I stood in breathless suspense to await the result.
With a loud scream the peregrine shot over the hapless birds, and in the
twinkling of an eye one of them came tumbling down like a stone close to
where I stood, followed by the hawk. With a swoop and a scream the hawk
rose again without alighting, and I took up the dead pigeon. The birds
above in the air were higher than before, but without deviating much to
any side.

'Again the hawk came down on the pigeons, and again one of them came
down dead, followed closely by the hawk, screaming

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

the while, and swooping off as before on nearing me. I took up the
second pigeon, and the disappointed hawk swept by me with an unearthly
scream.'

'The pigeons moved higher, but not laterally, and struggled in a
confused, helpless mass, as if paralysed.

'The peregrine made another swoop and went straight at the pigeons, and
again one came tumbling down. Just as I was going to move toward the
dead bird a rasping scream right overhead startled me back as if shot,
and the hawk brushed past my face like a flash of lightning, and dashed
itself dead on the road, splashing my feet with blood and displacing
embedded pebbles in the hard road with its sharp beak.

'The dead pigeons had no marks upon them except a slight pin-like
puncture on the same spot behind the head where the fanner had struck
the spinal cord. Had the powerful hawk struck me on the neck, as it so
very nearly did, I believe it would have killed me as it did the
pigeons.

'I brought home the hawk and the three pigeons, and kept the former for
some time.'

A warrior of the Macdonalds, known as 'Domhull Mae lain ’ic
Sheumais'--Donald, son of John, son of James--had a sword called 'an
Lannaire Riabhach,' the brindled peregrine, sometimes 'an Ranaire
Riabhach,' the brindled roarer.

 

'*Laogh na ba air braigh na beinge*' (vol. i. p. 268). When a calf dies,
the mother will not give her milk, Highland cows being greatly attached
to their calves. When this occurs the skin of the dead calf is placed on
a shaped frame, generally of wicker-work, made and kept for the purpose.
The improvised calf is placed beneath the cow and rocked to and fro in
imitation of the fretting motion of the live calf, the milkmaid being
busy the while relieving the pleased cow of her milk, and singing a
'taladh bleoghain,' milking lullaby. The cow every now and then sniffs
at the 'calf' to satisfy herself that it is her own, for woe betide the
milkmaid who placed the skin of another calf before a Highland cow!

The imitation calf is differently named in different districts, as
'laoicion,' 'loircean,' 'lulagan,' 'tulagan,' 'tulachan.'

The term 'tulachan' was applied to certain men appointed bishops in the
Scottish Church after the Reformation. These men were bishops in name
only, not in power, and their revenues

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

were drawn by their patrons. Hence 'tulchan bishops,' a term of much
contempt.

 

*Leann*, ordinarily beer, here a pool, from the same root as 'linne,' a
linn, a pool; a river name.

 

*Li*, *lia*, *liu*, *lu*, water, liquid, lye, lustre. There are several
forms of this root and of its derivatives--'lir,' 'linne,' 'lu,' 'lua,'
'lighe.' The word enters into many place-names--as, 'Lite,' Leith;
'Uisge Lite,' Water of Leith; the rivers Lee in England and in Ireland;
'Traigh Li,' in Benderloch, Scotland; and 'Traigh Li,' Tralee, Ireland.
The root in these has reference not to the sea, but to the fresh waters
behind. In connection with hills, there are 'Beinn Li,' Ben Lee, in
Skye; 'Li fo Dheas' and 'Li fo Thuath,' Lee to the south and Lee to the
north, in North Uist; and 'Beinn Li,' in Barra. On the top of Lee in
Barra is a pool containing small shell-fish like embryo cockles. Ben
Lee, in Skye, is full of fountains; while on the summit of South Lee, in
North Uist, there is a deep tarn, evidently the mouth of an extinct
volcano. An old rhyme in Uist says:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Li' is now
confined to fresh water, but formerly it included salt water, as when in
the old tales the sea is personified under the name of 'Lir,' 'Lear.'

 

*Liath chearc*, greyhen. It is ominous to hear the greyhen after dusk.
Apart from the evil it bodes, the sound is extremely eerie. The greyhen
goes to a distance to make her nest, in order to conceal her eggs from
the blackcock. The blackcock, like the peacock, is a source of danger to
the eggs, but is careful of the young birds hatched by its mate.

 

*Linn*, an age, a generation, a century, a family, a brood-hen, a brood
of twelve. Twelve is a complete brood; any number above this is 'line
mhor,' big brood; any number below it is 'him bheag,' small brood.

*Lion*, lint. There are several kinds of lint, and it is uncertain which
is meant. Probably, however, the *linum*, flax of commerce, was the lint
used by the old people for occult purposes.

A hoop from three to four inches diameter was made of milkwort,
butter-wort, dandelion, and marigold. This was bound with a triple cord
of lint in name of Father, and of Son, and of Spirit, and placed under
the milk-vessels, to prevent witches spiriting away the substance of the
milk.

When cream is rich, most of it goes into butter in the process of
churning, and there is but little buttermilk left. When, however, cream
is poor in quality, there is but little butter, while much buttermilk
remains. When this occurred, probably not infrequently as the result of
poor feeding, the 'toradh,' substance, was said to be taken out of the
milk by occult agency. It was to safeguard against this that the hoop
bound with lint was made and placed under the milk-vessel.

Lint was deemed specially appropriate to bind the 'cuach,' coil, made of
the different plants. The people say that the hands and feet of Christ
were bound with lint when He was taken down from the Cross, and before
He was carried to the grave. In consequence of this the people speak of
the lint with much reverence, and call it 'lion beannaichte,' blessed
lint; 'lion naomh,' sacred lint; 'lion Chriosda chaoimh,' the lint of
Christ the kindly. They say that the person who would steal lint or
lint-seed would be guilty of as heinous an offence as he who would sin
against the Holy Ghost:--

'Lion na mna sith,' lint of the fairy woman, fairy flax. This flax is

water:--

*Liuil*, *liuthail*, bathe, bathing, washing, lustrating, purification;
from 'li,' 'liu,' water.

 

'*Liu nan lasa*,' water of the flame, lustral fire. Probably some rite
is indicated (vol. i. p. 6).

 

Loireag, a water-nymph, a water-sprite, a water-fairy. The 'loireag'
presided over the warping, weaving, waulking, and washing of the web,
and if the women omitted any of the traditional usages and ceremonies of
these occasions she resented their neglect in various ways. If a song
were sung twice at the waulking, the 'loireag' would come and render the
web as thin as before, and all the work of the women of no avail. They
had to begin anew and waulk the web over again, taking special care not
to repeat the offence. If a woman with 'guth cruaidh, reasgach,
sgreagach,' hard metallic voice, sang out of tune and overwhelmed the
others, the 'loireag' was especially wrathful at her.

A libation of milk had to be given to the 'loireag.' If this were
omitted she sucked the goats, sheep, and cows of the townland, placing a
spell upon them so that they could not move.

I had the following from Mary Macinnes, Haccleit, Benbecula: 'Benmore
was always eerie because of the 'loireag' dwelling there. The 'loireag'
is a small mite of womanhood that does not belong to this world, but to
the world thither. She was wont to drive the people out of their
heart-shrine with fear with my first recollection. But since the people
were driven from Benmore, there is no person there whom she can frighten
or dismay unless the big sheep. The 'loireag' is a plaintive little
thing, stubborn

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

and cunning. She is fond of milk and of milk produce, and she would suck
the goat, the sheep, and the cow when she could get the opportunity, and
she would place a spell upon the creatures that they could not move from
her. There was once a little cross Carle in Benmore, and the 'loireag'
was sucking his cow. His daughter made an attempt to drive her away, but
failed. She went in and told her father that neither the 'loireag' nor
the cow heeded her. The little Carle leapt out at the door in sparks of
red fire, swearing at the impudent 'loireag,' and at the cow. He threw a
boulder at the 'loireag,' wishing to kill her, but struck the cow
instead and nearly killed her! He then seized the point of the cow's
horn in the name of Columba the kindly, and immediately the cow leaped
away from the 'loireag,' and she leaped away from the cow. (Columba was
the best leech of man and beast in Alban in his day.) The 'loireag'
betook herself up the corrie of Coradale, her tune in her mouth and her
tongue in her cheek, mocking the little cross-grained Carle and singing
as she went:--

with which the people descend the precipices after birds.

'Lonachan,' rope in uprights of loom.

 

*Lon-craois*, May-fly, water-spider, water-beetle, water-demon,
water-glutton, from 'lon,' water, and 'craos,' lust, demon, gluttony,
voracity. It is said that a may-fly taken into the stomach causes
intense thirst and burning sensation. Hence of a man given to drink it
is said:--

<div align="center">

|                                           |     |                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-----|--------------------------------------------------|
| 'Shluig e lon chraois.'                   |     | He swallowed a may-fly.                          |
| 'Tart na lon-chraois ort a dhuine dhona.' |     | The thirst of the water-demon on thee, evil man. |
| 'Co gionaich ri lon-chraois.'             |     | As gluttonous as a water demon.                  |

</div>

A woman in Strathglass is said to have swallowed a may-fly, causing her
insatiable thirst. She ate a salt herring and leant over a pool of water
near a water-fall, which induced the fly to come up!

 

*Lorc*, *loirc*, leg, shank, foot, foot-mark.

'Loircean,' footling, active male child; 'loirceag,' footling, active
female child; akin to 'lorg,' shank, shank-bone, foot, foot-print.

 

*Lorg*, a straight staff with the bark on and no iron on it, the staff
of a flail, the haft of a spear. When the bark peels off, the 'lorg' is
thrown aside. The 'bata' is a crook with the bark off, and an iron ring
on it to keep away evil spirits.

 

*Luch-f heoir*, grass mouse, common shrew, also called 'fiolan,' little
beast, 'fiolan feoir,' 'fiolag f heoir,' little beast of the grass,
'dallag f heoir,' little blind one of the grass. When a shrew is caught
it is carefully rolled up in woollen cloth and preserved, in order to
counteract the paralysis in sheep, cattle, and horses, said

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

to be caused by the fairy mouse. The shrew, preferably a live one, is
carried sunwise across the loin of the animal affected, in name of
Father, Son, and Spirit. But, like its congener, the water-vole, the
common shrew was dreaded if seen near dwellings, as its appearance
presaged death in the house or ruin in the fold. An aged woman and the
writer observed a shrew mouse making its way in the direction of some
houses up the glen. Pressing her hand on mine, the woman whispered in
anxious tones, 'Iosa Mac Moire bhi leinn, a ghraidh, tha i seo air toir
cuideigin'--Jesus the Son of Mary be about us, thou love, this one is
seeking somebody. The death of her husband some days thereafter
confirmed her belief.

 

*Lucha shith*, fairy mouse, lesser shrew. It is also called 'beothachan
feoir,' little life of the grass; 'fionnag feoir,' little beast of the
grass; and 'feoirneachan,' little one of the grass.

The lesser shrew is much disliked, from a belief that it causes
paralysis of the spine in sheep, cows, and horses, by running across the
animal when lying down. This is called 'marcachd shith'--fairy riding.
To counteract its effects, a live common shrew if available, otherwise a
dead one, is carried across the loin and spine of the animal affected,
in name of Father, of Son, and of Spirit.

In some districts 'a mharcachd shith,' 'na marcaich shith,' is applied
to the perspiration, due to weakness, which comes out on cattle.

The lesser shrew is the smallest British mammal and one of the
prettiest. It is not rare, but it is seldom seen, because of its habit
of travelling under the grass--its slender pliant body, its long
tapering head, and its sharp pointed nose, being marvellously adapted to
this mode of progression. The observer may not see the animal, but if he
notices a rapid progressive but hardly perceptible movement in the
grass, he may conclude that a fairy mouse is underneath.
