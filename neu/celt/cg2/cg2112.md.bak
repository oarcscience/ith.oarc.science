### I

*Ichd*, *īchd*, *īc*, a frame put under a bee-hive.

 

*Iodh*, corn, food. 'Iodh' is obsolete as a simple term, but current in
compounds, as 'iodhlann,' corn enclosure, stackyard, from 'iodh,' corn,
and 'lann,' an enclosure; 'iodhlan,' a small strip of land under corn.
The words 'iodhlach' and 'iodhlachadh' are applied in Skye to all
handling of corn, from cutting to stacking. 'Tireadh,' 'tiriodh,' drying
corn on a kiln.

Tiree, 'Tir-iodh,' cornland, was the grange of the religious community
of Iona, as Trotarnis was the grange of the Macdonalds of the Isles, and
as Lismore was the grange of the kings of 'Barra-gobhan,' Latinised
'Beregonium.' The name 'Tir-Iodh,' land of corn, is singularly
applicable to this low-lying, fertile island, which is spoken of as 'Tir
iosal an eorna'--low land of barley. Other popular sayings about Tiree
are:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The word occurs in
place-names in some other districts of the Highlands, and in several
places in the county of Sutherland. All of these are good corn lands.
Rob Donn, the Reay bard, being asked his name, said:

The different places represent the districts of the clans named, and are
all in the county of Sutherland.

 

*Iol*, *iola*, a fishing-rock on shore, a fishing-bank at sea; in Uist,
fishing with rod or line in a boat 'air chruaidh,' at anchor, in
contra-distinction to 'maghar,' moving about. In Shetland, 'iola,'
'eila,' means fishing with a feather, whether moving or stationary.

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

'Iola' is a frequent place-name in the Western Isles. A fishing-bank
near Barra is called 'Iola-nam-bodach,' fishing-bank of the cods; a
townland in North Uist is called 'Iol-airidh,' fishing-bank of the
sheiling. Near Polltil, in Skye, is a place called 'Iola-Phadruig,' the
fishing-bank of Patrick, and 'Iola-geoghamhna,' the fishing-place of the
creek of the stirk; while in the near neighbourhood is a precipice
called 'Iolagag.' This rock is mentioned in an old dance song:

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The island of
Rockal, perhaps the mythic submerged 'Rocabarraidh' of the Barra people,
is called 'Iola nam miola mora,' the fishing-bank of the great
creatures; 'Iola nam muca mara,' the fishing-bank of the sea-pigs,
whales.

 

*Inid*, Shrove, Shrove Tuesday.

*Isean*. In some places 'isean' is applied to the young of birds only,
and in some to the young of all creatures, as in Uist, 'isean roin,' the
young of the seal, and in Lewis, 'isean eich,' the young of the horse.

 

*Iūchd*, *iūc*, nook, angle, recess, slit, scallop, fissure. 'Earc
iuchd,' slit-eared cows, ordinarily called 'torc chluasach,'
notch-eared, or 'crodh mara,' sea-cows. A cliff in Benderloch is called
'Creagniuchd,' evidently a corruption of 'creag an iuchd,' rock of the
angle or recess, a descriptive name.

 

*Iūchd*, *Iūc*, was the name of one of the four children of Tuirenn. The
name is mentioned in the touching lament of their father, who died
waiting and watching for them when the ill stepmother had put them under
druidism in the form of swans.
