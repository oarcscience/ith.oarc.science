### R

*Rachd*, emotion, vexation, stoppage of speech. 'Thainig rachd
orm'--Emotion came upon me; 'Thainig rachd am mhuineal'--Choking came in
my throat, a lump came in my throat. The vocal cords having become
enlarged through emotion, failed in their functions. 'Rachd feirge,' fit
of passion.

*Ran*, noble, very noble. 'Rigean ran,' noble queen.

 

*Rath*, luck, fortune, success, prosperity. The word occurs in many of
the sayings and phrases of the people, as--

</div>

Birds cunningly contrive to line their nests in harmony with their
surroundings. How the wheatear obtains the filaments of hair
occasionally found forming its nest is curious. This and the fact of its
being found dormant during winter causes the wheatear to be looked upon
as 'sianta,' sained.

When a man enters a human habitation he evokes peace and prosperity upon
the dwelling and the dwellers. When he enters a fairy bower the man
invokes strife and confusion upon the bower and the people therein.

If a man enters a fairy bower he inserts a knife, a nail, or a bit of
iron of some kind, in the lintel or corner of the doorway to safeguard
his return--fairies being unable to overcome iron.

Derivatives are 'rathail,' prosperous, astute; 'rathach,' forward,
pushing, prosperous. 'Rath' is used as a suffix, as 'cuilidh rath,'
fortune's store, fortune's treasury, the ocean. 'Cuilidh Mhoire,' Mary's
treasury, is another term applied to the ocean. 'Currachd rath,' lucky
cap, lucky cowl, a name applied to the caul or membrane occasionally
covering the head of a child at birth. This caul was much sought after
in Scotland. It is still sought after in England, Ireland, and in some
foreign countries, chiefly by sailors, as a talisman against

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

murder on land and drowning at sea. The price ranges from £2 to £20,
according to the means or the faith of the buyer.

Sir Duncan Campbell of Loch Awe, who wrested Caisteal Caol-chuirn,
Kilchurn Castle, from the Macgregors, was known as 'Donnchadh Dubh a
churraichd,' Black Duncan of the cowl, because he had a caul on his head
when born. Sir Duncan Campbell is said to have fully justified the faith
in the 'currachd rath,' lucky cowl.

 

*Reann*, *rann*, *reang*, *rang*, a bar, a rib, a stalk, a rod, a pole,
a wand. The royal fern is called 'roinneach reangach,' 'reann
roinneach,' from its wand-like stalks.

 

*Reiteach*, clear, prepare, remove difficulties, remove obstructions. It
was customary in the Highlands to clear the pathways before
distinguished persons. Johnson mentions that the people turned out to
clear the roadway before Lady Macdonald, one of the celebrated
Eglintons.

A burial-place in Glencreran, Appin, is situated 700 feet high on the
mountain side. Immediately before a funeral men go up to clear the path,
and bestrew it with birch and sycamore branches.

The funeral cortège rushes up the steep hillside at a swinging pace,
chanting a weird dirge the while. When the body is laid in the grave and
the grave closed in, the bier on which it was carried is broken against
a certain tree in the burying-ground to render it unfit for the
'sluagh,' hosts, to use in carrying away the dead in their aërial
travelling. This picturesquely situated burying-ground is called 'Cladh
Chuiril,' 'Cladh Chuirirlean,' 'Cill Chuirealain,' the burying-ground of
Cyril. St Cyril was Bishop of Antioch in the eighth century.

There is a burial-ground in Lochaber, another on Loch Etive, and another
on Loch Awe, dedicated to this saint. Cill Choireil in Brae Lochaber is
686 feet above sea-level; that on Loch Etive is not so high, being only
105 feet above the sea; while that on Loch Awe is 700 feet above
sea-level. These dedications to St Cyril are situated amid scenery of
surpassing beauty, variety, and grandeur. Similar practices obtain or
used to obtain at them all, fulfilling the command--'Prepare ye the way
of the Lord; make His path straight.' Birch, which is fragrant, and
plane-tree or sycamore, which is easily had, are used for want of palm
branches. In his *Monasteries of the Levant*, Curzon mentions

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

that burying-places and monasteries are situated in high-places. The
situations and customs of these Highland burying-places are suggestive
of the East, and with their dedicatory saint seem to connect the West
with the East.

 

*Ridean*, *rigean*, queen, a handsome maiden, a beautiful girl.

 

*Ro*, *rod*, *roth*, pass, passage, way. Occurring in place-names as
'Roglas,' water passage, from 'ro,' pass, and 'glas,' water, in
Killdonan, and 'Ro Iochdar,' in South Uist. \[Doubtful.\]

 

*Rōs*, knowledge; 'Ni bheil ros agam,' I have no knowledge; 'Cha
d’fhuair mi ros air,' I did not get knowledge of him. A derivative,
'rosal,' is said to mean a place of knowledge, a school, a college.
There is a 'rosal' in Mull said to be the site of a collegiate school
attached to the abbey of Iona. The name occurs as a place-name also in
Caithness in the north of Scotland, and in the neighbour-hood of
Eastbourne in the south of England. It is interesting to find that these
places from time immemorial have been seats of learning. \[Rosal, Rossal
in the north and west is Norse 'hross-völlr,' horse-field.\]

 

*Rutaidh*, surly, butting, bumping, bumptious, ram-like; from 'rut,' a
ram.

 

*Ruth*, desire, genesis, generation, procreation.
