AN evil eye or an evil spirit is powerless across water, especially
across a running stream or a tidal water.

'Sir Eoghan Dubh Lochiall'--Black Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, was at
feud with Mackintosh of Moy about lands in Lochaber. 'Gormshul mhor na
Moighe'--great Gormul of Moy, the celebrated witch, wished to destroy
Lochiel, the foe of her chief and of her race. But, though she nursed
her wrath and pursued her course day and night, she could not accomplish
her purpose, as running water lay between herself and the object of her
hatred. Lochiel knew this, and, although brave to recklessness, he
prudently kept out of the way of the witch-woman. But on one occasion
when Lochiel was returning from a conference at Inverness, great Gormul
saw him far away on the blue horizon; but, if far away was he, not long
was she in reaching him:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sir Ewen Cameron
was one of the bravest men in Albain, and one of the best walkers in
Gaeldom. Many a brave Saxon man he met without quailing, and many a hero
he laid low, but this froward woman was trying him severely, and he was
anxious to be rid of her with the least delay of time and the least
betrayal of fear. The witch-woman observed this; and the more
desperately he pressed on space, the more she pressed on him, while she
herself appeared to be only making 'cas ceum coilich feasgar fann
foghair agus a sgroban lan'--the footstep of a cock on a gentle autumn
eve when his crop is full.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Remembering that
occult power could not operate across running water, Lochiel suddenly
swerved aside to the first stream he saw and plunged into it. The witch,
chagrined at the escape of the prey she had thought safe, immediately
called after him:--

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The pillared grey
stone on the bank of the river to which Lochiel pointed with his sword
rent from top to base! Gallant courtier though he was, Sir Ewen Cameron
waited to show but scant courtesy to great Gormul of Moy.

The influence of an evil spirit commanded by an evil mind is believed to
retard or wholly to prevent butter from coming upon the cream in the
churn. This evil influence was used by one woman against another in
order to spirit away the butter from her neighbour's churn to her own
churn. This, however, could only be done if no stream ran between the
two women. A fire for kindling carried across a stream, however small,
loses its occult power and is ineffective in spiriting away milk, cream,
butter, or other milk product.

The following story was told me in 1870 by Mor Macneill, cottar, Glen,
Barra. Sometimes the substance is spirited out of the milk, nothing
being left but the semblance. On one occasion a household in Skye were
at the peat-moss making peats, none remaining at home but the housewife
and a tailor who was making clothes for the father and the sons of the
house.

The housewife was up in the 'ben' churning, and the tailor was down in
the 'butt' sewing. He sat on the meal-girnel, cross-legged, after the
manner of tailors. Presently a neighbour woman came in and asked for a
kindling for her fire. She took the kindling and went her way. When she
went out, the tailor leaped down, and taking a live cinder from the
fire, placed it in the water-stoup below the dresser, and with a bound
was back again cross-legged on the meal-girnel sewing away as before. In
a little while the woman came back saying that she failed to kindle her
fire, and asked for another kindling, which she took. The tailor leapt
down again and took another live cinder out of the fire and put it in
the water-stoup below the dresser, and, with a spring to the
meal-girnel, resumed his work. The woman came a third time saying that
she had failed to

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

kindle her fire, and for the third time she took a kindling and went her
way. As soon as she had left, the tailor leapt down, and taking a live
cinder from the fire, placed it in the water-stoup as he had done
before, and then springing to the top of the meal-girnel sat
cross-legged sewing as if nothing unusual had occurred.

Towards evening the housewife came down in sore distress, saying--'O
Mary and Son, am I not the sorely shamed woman, churning away at that
churn the live-long day till my spirit is broken and my arms are weary,
and that I have utterly failed to bring butter on the churn after all! O
Mary! Mary, fair

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mother of grace!
what shall I do when the people come home? I shall never hear the end of
this churning till the day of my death!' 'Place thine hand in the
water-stoup below the dresser and see if thy butter be there,' said the
tailor. And with that the woman placed her hand in the water-stoup as
directed, and three successive times, and each time brought up a large
lump of butter as fresh and fair and fragrant as the beauteous
butter-cups in their prime. The clever tailor had counteracted the
machinations of the greedy neighbour woman by placing the live cinders
in the water-stoup.
