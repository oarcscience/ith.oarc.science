### D

*Dailginn*, *dailgionn*, prophecy, foretelling; 'dailgneachd,' auspices,
prophetic vision, occurs in my version of the 'Children of Uisne.'

 

*Dais*, a musical instrument.

 

*Daol*, *daolag*, beetle, black beetle, gravedigger. This beetle is
remorselessly killed in the Highlands. In some places this is done to
prevent it from molesting the grave of the person's grandmother, but in
Uist it is killed because of its officiousness in helping to betray
Christ. (Vol. ii. [p. 188](cg2093.htm#page_188) *ff*..md)

 

*Deabhadh* (*dea’ adh*), act of drying up.

| 'Tha’n lir a deabhadh.' |     | The water is drying. |

</div>

 

*Dealan-De*, butterfly, golden butterfly; lit, fire of God--'dealan,'
fire, flame, lightning; and 'De,' God.

The golden butterfly is held sacred. It is said to be the angel of God
come to bear the souls of the dead to heaven. If it be

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

seen in or near the house where a person is dead or dying, the omen is
good, and the friends rejoice. If it be not seen, a substitute is made
by rapidly twirling a fire-pointed stick, moving the while from the dead
or dying person towards the door or window. This is called 'dearban De,'
'dealan De.'

The ancient Egyptians represented the soul leaving the body as a
butterfly emerging from the chrysalis, sometimes from the mouth of the
dead.

 

*Dearb*, *dairb*, an insect of the beetle tribe. 'Dairbeart,' water
beetle; 'dairbeag,' tadpole; 'deairbean,' glowworm.

 

*Dearg*, an impression; hence, a wound; 'deargadh,' ploughing. 'Cha
d’f huair mi dearg--deargadh eisg,' I did not get an impression--an
impression of fish; 'Cha toir mi deargadh air,' I cannot make an
impression on it.

 

*Dearras*, *dearrais*, obdurate, venomous, the serpent.

<div align="center">

|--------------------------------|-----|--------------------------------------|
| 'Thig an dearrais as an toll.' |     | The serpent will come from the hole. |

</div>

 

*Dearshul*, Darthula, the wife of Naoise, and the type of affection.
Many places in the Highlands are called after this beautiful lady. (Vol.
i. p. 8.)

 

*Deis-de*, girth, sanctuary, Godward, a place of safety, a point in
'tig' where the boy within is secure and cannot be touched, from 'deas,'
right hand, and 'De,' of God.

 

*Deor*, *deoir*, *diuir*, tear, tears.

 

*Deor*, pilgrim, traveller, wayfarer, a poor person. 'Is to an deora
truagh'--Thou art the miserable poor. 'Deor,' 'diuir,' an almoner, hence
Dewar, a personal name. Probably Deer and the famous Book of Deer got
their names from 'deor,' almoner. The Barons Livingstone of Bachuill,
Lismore, were almoners to the church of St Moluag in Lismore, the
cathedral church of the See of Argyll and the Isles, founded in 1200.
They were known as 'deora,' almoners, while the site of the old
residence of the family is still called 'Larach taigh nan deora,' the
site of the house of the almoners, and the brae below the house as
'Bruthach taigh nan deora,' the declivity of the house of the almoners.
These almoners were also keepers of the staff of St Moluag, and
assessors and collectors of the tithes of the diocese. Whenever the
custodian of the staff appeared with the staff as the emblem of his
office, due obedience was given to him

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

within his own special jurisdiction. Some interesting traditions are
still current concerning some of the barons and their travels and the
staff of the saint which they carried about, and to which miraculous
powers were attributed. The custodian of the staff of St Moluag
possessed a freehold estate for his varied services. The estate was of
considerable extent, but is now reduced to a small piece of land through
the fraud of 'Domhull Dubh nan Ard,' Black Donald of Airds. Sir Donald
Campbell was a natural son of Campbell of Calder. He was an ecclesiastic
when ecclesiastical affairs in Scotland changed complexion with the
facility of the kaleidoscope, and Donald Campbell changed with them.
When Catholicism was in the ascendant he was a Catholic, when Episcopacy
superseded he was an Episcopalian, and when Presbyterianism was
promising he was all for Presbyterian parity. He was nominated, possibly
appointed, but not consecrated, Bishop of Argyll. Donald Campbell was a
man of great ability, but utterly unscrupulous as to the means whereby
to attain his ends. His conduct towards Baron Livingstone of Bachuill,
Baron Carmichael of Sguran, and other small proprietors in his
neighbourhood, shows him to have been a man of extraordinary stratagem,
duplicity, and rapacity.

Dr David Livingstone was descended from these Barons Livingstone of
Lismore, through a member of the family who had settled in Mull. The
great traveller resembled his kinsmen and clansmen in Lismore in a
remarkable manner, physically, mentally, and morally. The present
venerable Baron Alexander Livingstone of Bachuill has been taken for his
famous name-sake. The Baron however is taller, being nearly six feet in
height.

The 'Clann an Leigh,' 'Gann an Leighean,' children of the physicians,
Livingstones of Bachuill, are said to be descended, like the famous
Beaton physicians of Mull, Islay, Skye, and Reay, from Beatan, the
Columban medical missionary of Iona. (Vol. ii. [p.
78](cg2041.htm#page_78) *ff*..md) 'Sgoiltidh an dualchas a
chreag'--Heredity will cleave the rock. David Livingstone cleaved his
way through rocks harder than any that his kindred had ever faced.

The Campbells of Bail-an-deor, in Lorn, were almoners to the Priory of
Airdchattan. They were big powerful men. One of them is still spoken of
as 'An Deora mor,' the big almoner, and 'Deora mor Bhail-an-deor,' the
big almoner of the townland of the almoner.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

Robert Burns' ancestor was a Campbell descended from Walter Campbell,
Bogjoram, Kincardine. It is almost if not wholly certain that this
Walter Campbell was the son of the 'Deora Mor,' and had to flee from
home on account of the storm he raised against himself, under extreme
provocation, in his treatment of the 'char Sheanchain,' strolling
satirists.

Here again heredity asserts itself, several of these Campbells of
Bail-an-deor having been poets in olden and in modern times.

Near Bail-an-deor is the home of the 'Rusgain,' Ruskins. The Ruskins
were in Glenlonain from time immemorial. Many pieces of sculpture have
been found lying scattered about in various places in this beautiful
glen. Some of these are still seen. 'Rusgan' means peeler, bark-peeler,
hewer. A tradition still exists among the old people of the place that
the Ruskins were 'luchd ceaird,' artisans; 'draoinich,' sculptors. There
were schools of sculpture in the Highlands. One of these was in
'Innis-draoinich,' Lochawe, a few miles from Glenlonain, the home of the
Ruskins. 'Innis draoinich' means isle of the artisans, isle of the
sculptors--from 'innis,' isle, and 'draoineach,' sculptor. Within a few
hundred yards of Innis-draoineach is 'Innis-ail,' beautiful isle. There
had been a house of Cistercian nun-sisters here, and an ancient
burying-ground. There are ancient sculptured stones here, probably
unexcelled for beauty of design and of execution. Jewellery in gold and
silver from designs on these ancient Celtic sculpturings is used by
royalty.

'Ciorsdan Dhughuill fhigheadair,' Christina, daughter of Dugald the
weaver, was the last of the Ruskins of Glenlonain. Her father was Dugald
MacCalman, and her mother was a Ruskin--the last of the name.

The tradition of the Clerks of Duntannachain, Glenlonain, was that John
Ruskin was descended from the Ruskins of Glenlonain. The Clerks were
descended from educated parents and were an educated and intellectual
family, one of them being the late Rev. Archibald Clerk, LL.D., the
accomplished Celtic scholar. The father was the learned farmer spoken of
by Dr Macleod in his *Reminiscences of a Highland Parish*, and the
mother was Margaret Carmichael, Lismore, sister of Captain Dugald
Carmichael, of the 72nd Highlanders, 'the father of marine botany' and
the friend of Sir William Hooker.

The members of this family were unanimous in saying that John Ruskin was
descended from a Ruskin who went south in one of

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

the expeditions from Argyll, and who remained south. They said that the
last of the Ruskins of Glenlonain who lived near them strongly resembled
the distinguished writer mentally and physically.

 

*Di*, day. There is much lore connected with the days of the week.
'Di-luain,' 'Luan,' Monday, Moon; 'Luan mall,' tardy Monday; 'paighear
Di-luain mall e,' it will be paid on tardy Monday--never. The people
will not begin important work on Monday lest it should be tedious:--

'Di-ardaoin,' Thursday; 'di-eadar-aoin,' the day between the fasts;
'di-eadar-da-aoin,' day between the two fasts. Being dedicated to the
beloved Columba, Thursday was propitious for all good work, especially
for work connected with sheep, cattle,

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

and wool-working. It is a good day to be born, to die, and to go forth

'Di-aoin,' 'Di h-aoine,' Friday, day of the fast, from 'di,' day, and
'aoin,' fast. The people were averse to the counting of men, or of
flocks, or of anything, on a Friday. Monday or Sunday, especially the
first Monday or the first Sunday of the quarter, was the auspicious day
for counting flocks.

Friday is unlucky and banned because Christ was put to death on that
day. It is not permissible to begin ploughing, reaping, cutting peats,
clipping sheep, nor even to cut hair on Friday. If peat-cutting is begun
on Friday, some one will remark, 'Tha cuideigin an seo an diugh nach
faic a mhoine seo loisgte'--There is some one here to-day who will not
see these peats burnt. All feel more than they say.

No burial occurs on a Friday, nor any other work necessitating the use
of iron. Even the fairies were not allowed to appear on Friday:

Much more folk-lore on the days of the week might be added.

 

*Di-baigh*, *dim-baigh*, loveless, merciless; from 'di,' want of, and
'bagh,' love, mercy.

 

*Di-bith*, *dim-bith*, lifeless, luckless; from 'di,' want of, and
'bith,' life.

 

*Dōchaidh*, comparative of 'dōgh,' 'dōigh,' trust; hence more trustful,
more hopeful, more likely.

 

*Doilisg*, vexation, annoyance, grief, state of death.

 

*Domhnach Ceusda*, Easter Sunday, Crucifying Sunday; from 'Domhnach,'
Lord's Day, and the old genitive of 'ceusadh,' crucifying.

The people say that the sun dances on this day in joy for a risen
Saviour.

Old Barbara Macphie at Dreimsdale saw this once, but only once, during
her long life. And the good woman, of high natural intelligence,
described in poetic language and with religious fervour what she saw or
believed she saw from the summit of Benmore:--'Bha ghrian or-ghil an
deigh eirigh air sgeith nam beann mora agus i a caochladh dath--uaine,
purpaidh, dearg, cra-dhearg, geal, gile-gheal, agus oir-gheal, mar
ghloir Dhe nan dul do chlanna dhaona. Bha i a dannsadh a sios agus a
suas ann an gairdeachas ri aiseirigh aigh Slanuighear gradhach nam
buadh.'--The glorious gold-bright sun was after rising on the crests of
the great hills, and it was changing colour--green, purple, red,
blood-red, white, intense-white, and gold-white, like the glory of the
God of the elements to the children of men. It was dancing up and down
in exultation at the joyous resurrection of the beloved Saviour of
victory.

'To be thus privileged, a person must ascend to the top of the highest
hill before sunrise, and believe that the God who

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

makes the small blade of grass to grow is the same God who makes the
large, massive sun to move.'

 

*Dōrnan*, a handful, a glove without separate fingers. 'Dornag,'
'doirneag,' a round pebble, a handful of a pebble. 'Dornan,' 'beum,'
'slathag,' 'dlo,' 'sineag,' 'glac,' are some of the names applied to a
handful of corn cut with one stroke of the reaping-hook. Three stalks of
corn are used to bind a handful, and there are twenty-four handfuls in
the 'raoid,' sheaf.

 

*Dorn-gheal*, Dor-gheal, Whitehand.

This was the name of the man who clothed 'Murachadh Mac Brian'--Murdoch
the son of Brian, in his war vestments, and equipped him with his war
weapons. The description of this equipment is an extraordinary piece of
word-painting--probably unsurpassed.

 

*Drābhachd*, debauchery, indelicacy of speech; from 'drābh,' dark,
black, smut.

 

*Dris*, *druis*, bramble. The bramble was much valued by the old
Highlanders, and where not indigenous was cultivated. The fruit was used
for food, the root for dyeing, and an infusion of the leaves was used
for medical purposes. Alone, and in combination with the ivy and the
rowan, the bramble was placed above the lintel of the byre door to ward
away witches and evil spirits.

It is spoken of as 'an druise beannaichte'--the blessed bramble. It is
said that a branch of the bramble was the wand with which Christ
hastened the ass when going into Jerusalem, and the rod with which He
drove the money-changers from the Temple.

The bramble is mentioned in several proverbs:--

*Duailisg*, fraud, deceit, stubbornness.

 

*Duine*, 'the mortal one,' man, husband, man of children, and the
counterpart of 'bean,' woman, mother of children.
