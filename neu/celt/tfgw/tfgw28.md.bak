The Four-Leafed Shamrock

>  

> THIS tale gives a good instance of the virtue of the four-leafed
> shamrock against the power which takes people's eyes--*i.e.,* true
> vision--from them:

> A good many years ago a showman came to the town of Dingle and
> performed many tricks there. At one time he'd eat a dozen straws and
> then pull yards of ribbon from his throat. The strangest thing he
> showed was a game-cock that he used to harness to a great log of wood.

> Men, women, and children were breaking their bones, running to see the
> cock, and he a small bird, drawing such a great weight of timber. One
> day, when the showman was driving the cock on the road toward Brandon
> Mountain, he met a man with a bundle of fresh grass on his back. The
> man was astonished to see crowds running after a cock dragging one
> straw behind him.

> "You fool," said the people, "don't you see the cock drawing a log of
> timber, and it would fail any horse to draw the like of it?"

> "Indeed, then, I do not. I see the cock dragging a straw behind him,
> and sure I've seen the like many a time in my own place."

> Hearing this, the showman knew that there was something in the grass,
> and going over to the man he asked what price was he asking for the
> bundle. The man didn't wish to sell the grass, but at last he parted
> with it for eighteen pence. The showman gave the grass to his boy and
> told him to go aside and drop it into the river. The boy did that, and
> when the bundle went down with the stream the man was as big a fool as
> another; he ran after the cock with the crowd.

> That evening the same man was telling a friend how at first he saw the
> cock with a straw behind him, and then saw him drawing a great log of
> wood. "Oh, you fool!" said the friend, "there was a four-leafed
> shamrock in your bundle of grass; while you had the shamrock it kept
> every enchantment and devilment from you, and when you parted with it,
> you became as big a fool as the others."
