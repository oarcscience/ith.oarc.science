Pat Doyle and the Ghost

>  

> THERE was *a* young man in the next parish whose name was Pat Doyle,
> and one night he had to bring the priest to his father, John Doyle. It
> was late when the young man came to the priest's house. He knocked; a
> servant opened and asked what he wanted.

> "The priest, for my father is dying," said Pat.

> "I'll not go at this hour," said the priest; "why didn't you come
> earlier?"

> "My father wasn't in danger till night, and besides I was working far
> from home; I couldn't come a minute sooner."

> The priest was vexed, but he mounted his horse and started. Pat Doyle
> and the clerk walked behind him. About half-way they came to a house
> where whiskey was kept, though people didn't know it generally.

> "Will you wait for me here, Father?" asked Pat Doyle.

> "I will," said the priest, "but don't keep me waiting too long." Pat
> was barely inside when a ghost appeared behind the priest and the
> clerk. The priest turned, and holding the crucifix toward the ghost,
> spoke and held him back.

> "Let us be going on," said the clerk, "the young man can come up with
> us."

> The priest and his clerk hurried away. When Pat Doyle came out he saw
> neither priest nor clerk, and ran on after them. The road lay through
> boggy land, and there, to his terror, he saw a ghost coming in flames
> of fire. There was no escape at one side or another, and young Doyle
> had no steel to defend himself, so the ghost killed him there on the
> road.

> The priest found the father alive, but stayed all night. He was too
> much in dread to go home. John Doyle grew better, but he was
> frightened when the son was not coming. He asked where was Pat. They
> said he'd come soon. But when he wasn't coming, the sick man begged
> his own brother's sons to go for him. One of them, Tim Doyle, was a
> very courageous young fellow, and said:

> "I'll find him if he's in it. Neither ghost nor devil will keep him
> from me."

> Tim went up to the loft, took an old sword and knocked a shower of
> rust from it. He went on his way then with his brother, and when they
> came to the boggy place they saw horses prancing and running around
> them and Pat racing on a grand steed.

> "It is here he is," said Tim, "in place of going home to his dying
> father."

> But when they came to where they thought they saw the horses, there
> was nothing before them but a ghost in flames of fire. Tim made at the
> ghost with the sword and said:

> "Go, in the name of the devil; you will not frighten me." That moment
> the ghost disappeared, and Tim thought that all the stone walls for
> ten miles around him were tumbling, there was such a noise. They went
> on and soon they came to the body of Pat Doyle. They knelt down and
> examined it.

> "If there is a breath in him, sure the priest will raise him," said
> Tim.

> They carried Pat home on their shoulders. When they came to the house,
> they found him stone dead. As soon as John Doyle heard of his son's
> death, life left him that minute.

> All blamed the priest for not staying with Pat, and the mother said:

> "If you, Father, had stayed with him and held the crucifix against the
> ghost, my poor boy would be alive now."

> Two days after this a neighbouring boy went up to a hillside where a
> herd of much cows were grazing, and waited there till nightfall: as he
> was going home across the fields he saw three men walking, and near
> them something in the form of a he-goat; when they came up he saw that
> one of the three was Pat Doyle, the other two were boys killed by the
> same ghost months before.

> The young fellow was not frightened; he spoke up and asked:

> "Is this where you are, Pat Doyle? Sure I thought you were dead and
> buried."

> "I am dead in this world," said Pat, "but I'm not dead in the next. I
> was killed by a mad ghost, and do you go now and tell the priest from
> me that it was the ghost that killed me. The priest was gone when I
> came out of the house. He might have saved me as he saved himself and
> the clerk, but he left me to the ghost."

> The boy went to the priest and told him everything, and the priest
> believed him.

>  

>  

> "My husband knew old John Doyle and Pat Doyle before he was killed,
> and Tim who carried Pat home. They were all blood relations of his."

> "Perhaps Pat Doyle could have saved himself with a steel knife or a
> sword," said I.

> "Oh, he could," answered the old woman; "my husband's cousin did the
> like one time. I will tell you how it was."
