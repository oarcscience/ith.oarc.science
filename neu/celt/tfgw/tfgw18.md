St Martin's Eve

(told by John Sheehy)

>  

> IN Iveragh, not very far from the town of Cahirciveen, there lived a
> farmer named James Shea with his wife and three children, two sons and
> a daughter. The man was peaceable, honest, and very charitable to the
> poor, but his wife was hard-hearted, never giving even a drink of milk
> to a needy person. Her younger son was as bad in every way as herself,
> and whatever the mother did he always agreed with her and was on her
> side.

> This was before the roads and cars were in the Kerry Mountains. The
> only way of travelling in those days, when a man didn't walk, was to
> ride sitting on a straw saddle, and the only way to take anything to
> market was on horseback in creels.

> It happened, at any rate, that James Shea was going in the beginning
> of November to Cork with two firkins of butter, and what troubled him
> most was the fear that he'd not be home on Saint Marlin's night to do
> honour to the saint. For never had he let that night pass without
> drawing blood in honour of the saint. To make sure, he called the
> elder son and said, "If I am not at the house on Saint Martin's night,
> kill the big sheep that is running with the cows."

> Shea went away to Cork with the butter, but could not be home in time.
> The elder son went out on Saint Martin's eve, when he saw that his
> father was not coming, and drove the sheep into the house.

> "What are you doing, you fool, with that sheep?" asked the mother.

> "Sure, I'm going to kill it. Didn't you hear my father tell me that
> there was never a Saint Martin's night but he drew blood, and do you
> want to have the house disgraced?"

> At this the mother made sport of him and said: "Drive out the sheep
> and I'll give you something else to kill by and by." So the boy let
> the sheep out, thinking the mother would kill a goose.

> He sat down and waited for the mother to give him whatever she had to
> kill. It wasn't long till she came in, bringing a big tomcat they had,
> and the same cat was in the house nine or ten years.

> "Here," said she, "you can kill this beast and draw its blood. We'll
> have it cooked when your father comes home."

> The boy was very angry and spoke up to the mother: "Sure the house is
> disgraced for ever," said he, "and it will not be easy for you to
> satisfy my father when he comes."

> He didn't kill the cat, you may be sure; and neither he nor his sister
> ate a bite of supper, and they were crying and fretting over the
> disgrace all the evening.

> That very night the house caught fire and burned down, nothing was
> left but the four walls. The mother and younger son were burned to
> death, but the elder son and his sister escaped by, some miracle. They
> went to a neighbour's house, and were there till the father came on
> the following evening. When he found the house destroyed and the wife
> and younger son dead he mourned and lamented. But when the other son
> told him what the mother did on Saint Martin's eve, he cried out:

> "Ah, it was the wrath of God that fell on my house; if I had stopped
> at home till after Saint Martin's night, all would be safe and well
> with me now."

> James Shea went to the priest on the following morning, and asked
> would it be good or lucky for him to rebuild the house.

> "Indeed," said the priest, "there is no harm in putting a roof on the
> walls and repairing them if you will have mass celebrated in the house
> before you go to live in it. If you do that all will be well with
> you."

> \[Shea spoke to the priest because people are opposed to repairing or
> rebuilding a burnt house, and especially if any person has been burned
> in it.\]

> Well, James Shea put a roof on the house, repaired it, and had mass
> celebrated inside. That evening as Shea was sitting down to supper
> what should he see but his wife coming in the door to him. He thought
> she wasn't dead at all. "Ah, Mary," said he, "tis not so bad as they
> told me. Sure, I thought it is dead you were. Oh, then you are welcome
> home; come and sit down here; the supper is just ready."

> She didn't answer a word, but looked him straight in the face and
> walked on to the room at the other end of the house. He jumped up,
> thinking it's sick the woman was, and followed her to the room to help
> her. He shut the door after him. As he was not coming back for a long
> time the son thought at last that he'd go and ask the father why he
> wasn't eating his supper. When he went into the room he saw no sign of
> his mother, saw nothing in the place but two legs from the knees down.
> He screamed out for his sister and she came.

> "Oh, merciful God!" screamed the sister.

> "Those are my father's legs!" cried the brother, "and Mary, don't you
> know the stockings, sure you knitted them yourself, and don't I know
> the brogues very well?"

> They called in the neighbours, and, to the terror of them all, they
> saw nothing but the two legs and feet of James Shea.

> There was a wake over the remains that night, and the next day they
> buried the two legs. Some people advised the boy and girl never to
> sleep a night in the house, that their mother's soul was lost, and
> that was why she came and ate up the father, and she would eat
> themselves as well.

> The two now started to walk the world, not caring much where they were
> going if only they escaped the mother. They stopped the first night at
> a farmer's house not far from Killarney. After supper a bed was made
> down for them by the fire, in the corner, and they lay there. About
> the middle of the night a great noise was heard outside, and the woman
> of the house called to her boy and servants to get up and go to the
> cow-house to know why the cows were striving to kill one another. Her
> own son rose first. When he and the two servant boys went out they saw
> the ghost of a woman, and she in chains. She made at them, and wasn't
> long killing the three.

> Not seeing the boys come in, the farmer and his wife rose up,
> sprinkled holy water around the house, blessed themselves and went
> out, and there they saw the ghost in blue blazes and chains around
> her. In a coop outside by himself was a March cock.\* He flew down
> from his perch and crowed twelve times. That moment the ghost
> disappeared.

> Now the neighbours were roused, and the news flew around that the
> three boys were killed. The brother and sister didn't say a word to
> any one, but, rising up early, started on their journey, begging God's
> protection as they went. They never stopped nor stayed till they came
> to Rathmore, near Cork, and, going to a farmhouse, the boy asked for
> lodgings in God's name.

> "I will give you lodgings in His name," said the farmer's wife. She
> brought warm water for the two to wash their hands and feet, for they
> were tired and dusty. After supper a bed was put down for them, and
> about the same hour as the night before there was a great noise
> outside.

> "Rise up and go out," said the farmer's wife; "some of the cows must
> be untied."

> "I'll not go out at this hour of the night, if they are untied
> itself," said the man. "I'll stay where I am, if they kill one
> another, for it isn't safe to go out till the cock crows; after
> cockcrow I'll go out."

> "That's true for you," said the farmer's wife, "and, upon my word,
> before coming to bed, I forgot to sprinkle holy water in the room, and
> to bless myself."

> So taking the bottle hanging near the bed, she sprinkled the water
> around the room and toward the threshold, and made the sign of the
> cross. The man didn't go out until cock-crow. The brother and sister
> went away early, and travelled all day. Coming evening they met a
> pleasant-looking man who stood before them in the road.

> "You seem to be strangers," said he; "and where are you going?"

> "We are strangers," said the boy, "and we don't know where to go."

> "You need go no farther. I know you well, your home is in Iveragh. I
> am Saint Martin, sent from the Lord to protect you and your sister.
> You were going to draw the blood of a sheep in my honour, but your
> mother and brother made sport of you, and your mother wouldn't let you
> do what your father told you. You see what has come to them; they are
> lost for ever, both of them. Your father is saved in heaven, for he
> was a good man. Your mother will be here soon, and I'll put her in the
> way that she'll never trouble you again."

> Taking a rod from his bosom and dipping it in a vial of holy water he
> drew a circle around the brother and sister. Soon they heard their
> mother coming, and then they saw her with chains on her, and the
> rattling was terrible, and flames were rising from her. She came to
> where they stood, and said: "Bad luck to you both for being the cause
> of my misery"

> "God forbid that," said Saint Martin. "It isn't they are the cause,
> but yourself, for you were always bad. You would not honour me, and
> now you must suffer for it."

> He pulled out a book and began to read, and after he read a few
> minutes he told her to depart and not be seen in Ireland again till
> the day of judgment. She rose in the air in flames of fire, and with
> such a noise that you'd think all the thunders of heaven were roaring
> and all the houses and walls in the kingdom were tumbling to the
> ground.

> The brother and sister went on their knees and thanked Saint Martin.
> He blessed them and told them to rise, and taking a little table-cloth
> out of his bosom he said to the brother: "Take this cloth with you and
> keep it in secret. Let no one know that you have it. If you or your
> sister are in need go to your room, close the door behind you and bolt
> it. Spread out the cloth then, and plenty of everything to eat and
> drink will come to you. Keep the cloth with you always; it belongs to
> both of you. Now go home and live in the house that your father built,
> and let the priest come and celebrate Monday mass in it, and live the
> life that your father lived before you."

> The two came home, and brother and sister lived a good life. They
> married, and when either was in need that one had the cloth to fall
> back on, and their grandchildren are living yet in Iveragh. And this
> is truth, every word of it, and it's often I heard my poor grandmother
> tell this story, the Almighty God rest her soul, and she was the woman
> that wouldn't tell a lie. She knew James Shea and his wife very well.

>
