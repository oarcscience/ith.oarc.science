Tim Sheehy Sent Back to This World to Prove His Innocence

(told by William Keating)

>  

> THERE was a farmer, fourteen miles from Tralee, named Fitzgerald, who,
> by sly management and being a spy on his neighbours, became a great
> friend of the landlord. He carried matters that far that at last he
> got enough small tenants ejected to give him the grass of forty cows.
> Within his bounds was a subtenant of the name of Tim Sheehy, and
> Fitzgerald was very anxious to have this man ejected. He made
> complaints to the landlord. He said Sheehy was poaching and destroying
> game, and said this and that of him.

> The landlord didn't believe these complaints, for Sheehy and his
> father before him were honest men, who paid their rent always. At
> last, by some chance, Fitzgerald's cow-house was burned down one night
> and ten cows were destroyed in the fire. A great many suspected Tim
> Sheehy. What they said was that Tim owed Fitzgerald a spite, and sure
> who else would be burning the cow-house? Fitzgerald was only too
> willing to take up the story and spread it.

> There was a woman in the village by the name of Kate Pendy, who had
> her own opinion, and she gave it:

> "Wisha, then, a ghraghil,"\* said she to a friend. "Tim Sheehy is as
> clear of that as God Himself. There is no fear that that poor, honest
> man burned the cow-house."

> This was Saturday, and Tim Sheehy was in Tralee on some business that
> he had, and he didn't come home till the following morning. When he
> was nearing the chapel and mass just over, crowds were around, and he
> heard a man say: "There goes Tim Sheehy, who burned Fitzgerald's
> cow-house and ran away: I wonder what's bringing him back?"

> "Sure, 'tis the finger of God," said a second man. "The Lord wouldn't
> let another be punished in place of him."

> Sheehy hung his head and was cut to the heart at these words. He went
> home, and whether it was from grief or sickness that he died, 'twas
> unknown, but he died that very day. When he was washed and ready to be
> laid on the table the wife sent to a neighbouring woman, a cousin of
> Fitzgerald, for the loan of sheets to hang over the table and the
> 'corpse. The woman refused to lend the sheets. "I'll not give them,"
> said she; "the divil mend Sheehy, he ruined my poor cousin."

> The boy went home without the sheets, and Mrs. Sheehy found them at
> another house. A deal of people met at the wake house; they sat down
> and began to smoke and tell stories, as people do always at wakes.
> What was their surprise at midnight when Tim Sheehy sat up on the
> table and began to speak to them.

> "Friends and neighbours," said he, "ye needn't be in dread of me; I'll
> not harm any person here present. It wasn't I that burned the
> cow-house. The man who did that is beyond the mountain at this time.
> People broke my heart, killed me with false accusations, but I got
> leave to return and tell you of my innocence and take the stain from
> my children." Sheehy was talking on, and would have said a deal more
> but for an old woman, Nancy Brady, who was sitting in the corner, and
> a wide ruffled white cap on her. She rose up. "Tim, my darling," said
> she, "did you see my mother?"

> Sheehy looked at her fiercely. "Bad luck to you, you hag," said he, "I
> did, and she is now what she was in life, a tale-bearing disturber,
> and dishonest. She goes about milking the neighbours' cows when she
> thinks nobody is looking at her, just as she used to do in this
> world." Tim Sheehy turned then to the people: "I can say no more, as I
> was interrupted by this woman." With that he dropped back dead and
> speechless.

> All the people in it were cursing Nancy Brady because she wouldn't
> stop quiet fill they could hear what Tim Sheehy had to tell about the
> other world.

>  

>  

> \*Gradhghil, voc. of gradhgeal, white love, darling.
