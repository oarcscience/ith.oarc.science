The Dead Mother

>  

> THE next two tales were told by the blind man whom I have mentioned in
> connection with fairy tales told at Ventry Strand.

> It is not out of place to refer here to a certain popular error. It is
> supposed by many persons that women are the chief depositories of
> tales touching fairies and other extra-human characters, but they are
> not. It is a rare thing to find a woman in possession of wonderful
> tales of the best quality. During researches extending over a number
> of years, I have found among Indians in the United States only one
> woman who could be classed with the very best tale-tellers. In Ireland
> I have found few women who can tell tales at all, and none who can
> compare with the best men. I believe this is so in all countries.

> The two following stories testify to a perfect communication at times
> between this world and another.

>  

>  

> There was a girl in Cloghane whose name was Mary Shea. She married and
> had three children, one son and two daughters. Her husband died; then
> his people turned against her and began to quarrel with the widow.
> Mary was a quiet, good woman, and didn't like trouble. So she told her
> brother-in-law that if he would give her money to go to America with
> her two girls she would give up the bit of land that she had and leave
> the little boy with himself till she would send for him.

> The brother-in-law and the other friends made up the money, and she
> went away and was doing well in America for about twelve months, and
> then she took a fever and died.

> The very same week that the mother died the girls sent money home for
> their brother. They wanted to send it while the mother was sick, but
> they waited to know would she get better. But she died and was buried.

> About two weeks after the woman's death a girl in Cloghane was going
> one evening to Castlegregory for sea-moss. Walking along, she saw a
> woman ahead, and hurried on to have company and shorten the road for
> herself. The woman ahead seemed in no hurry and waited.

> The girl spoke, and as they walked along the woman asked where was she
> going, and she told her. "Do you know me?" asked the woman.

> "I do not," said the girl, "but I think I have seen you."

> "Didn't you know Mary Fitzgerald?"

> "Oh, I did; and when did you come home?"

> "About two weeks ago."

> "Isn't it the wonder that your mother in Cloghane doesn't know you are
> here?"

> "I was in Cloghane," said she, "and saw them all, and 'tis badly they
> are treating my little boy, but 'twill not be long that way; he will
> go to his sisters in America. I died two weeks ago, but don't be in
> dread of me, for I'll do you no harm. I wanted you to speak to me, so
> I could tell you what to do. When you go home tomorrow go to my mother
> and tell her that I died in America, and that you saw me on this
> strand, that I am walking back and forth perishing with the cold. Tell
> her to buy a pair of shoes and stockings and give them to some poor
> person in my name, for God's sake."

> Mary was talking a long time to the girl, and the girl promised to go
> to the mother.

> It seems that whatever Mary's son did his uncle whipped him, and the
> boy was crying in the daytime and crying at night in bed, the night
> that Mary came first to Cloghane. Everybody in the house was silent
> except the boy, and he was crying. The mother walked in, bent over
> him, laid her hand on his shoulder and said, "Don't be crying, my poor
> little boy, you'll be with your sisters very soon. You'll not see your
> mother any more, but you'll be happy without her."

> He sat up in the bed, knew her, and grasping at her let such a screech
> out of him that it roused the uncle and grandmother, and he told them
> what he'd seen.

> Next day a letter came from America with news of the mother's death.
> Just after the girl came to the house and was telling about the shoes,
> the letter was brought in.

> The mother bought a pair of shoes and gave them to a poor woman, for
> God's sake and the good of Mary's soul, and Mary was seen on the
> strand no more after that.
