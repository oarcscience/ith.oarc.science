Tom Foley's Ghost

>  

> THERE was a man Tom Foley, a farmer who lived at Castle-main, near the
> Leann River; he had a brother John, who lived eight miles beyond
> Tralee, on a farm of his own he had there. The Leann is a great river
> for fishing; above all, when the weather is favourable.

> Tom Foley went fishing once on a cloudy day when it was raining a
> little. There was a great rise of fish in the river, and Tom was
> killing a power of them that turn.

> The place where Tom was fishing was about seven fields from his house
> without being in sight of it. The main road was very near the river,
> and Tom wasn't above an hour killing fish when a man came the way on
> horseback, and when he saw Foley on the bank he made toward him.

> "Is your name Tom Foley?" asked the man.

> "It is," said Tom.

> "Have you a brother named John?"

> "I have."

> "Well, your brother is dead; he got a sudden death yesterday. I am his
> servant man, and I was sent by John's wife to say that you are wanted
> at the house without delay."

> "You'd better not go back to-day," said Tom to the man. "There is a
> great rise of fish in this river; I haven't seen the like since I was
> born. Stop fishing here after me; you'll have time enough for the
> funeral to-morrow."

> "Leave your overcoat with me," said the man, "and I'll stop." Tom gave
> his overcoat to the man and said, "I'll no mind going home. The
> clothes I have on will do very well, and do you take what fish I
> killed and what you'll kill yourself to my house: you'll find the road
> to it easily."

> Tom mounted his horse and rode off. The servant man, who was of Tom's
> size, put on the coat and was fishing away for a few hours, when,
> whatever way it happened, he fell into the river and was drowned.

> There were two other fishermen on the bank of the river at a distance
> from Tom. They didn't see the horse coming nor the servant man
> changing places with Foley, and they thought it was Tom was in it all
> the time. After a while they looked again, but if they did, they got
> no sight of a man on the bank.

> "It seems Tom has gone home," said one of the men; "there is no rise
> of fish here, and I'll go fishing the river down before me."

> He went down till he came to where Foley's bag of fish was. He knew
> then that it was not home he went. So he looked into the water, and
> what should he see but the body at the bottom of the river and Tom
> Foley's coat on it. He screeched out to the other man then, saying
> that Tom Foley was drowned.

> The other man came and stayed in the place, while the first went with
> an account to the house and told Tom's wife, Mary, that her husband
> was drowned in the river. Mary began to screech and lament in a way
> you'd think the life would leave her. The man ran and collected the
> neighbours, and went with them and Mary Foley to bring home the
> corpse.

> When the people raised the body from the river, they found the face
> all eaten by eels: no one could know that it was Tom Foley was in it
> but for the coat.

> Mary began to moan and lament now at sight of the body. "Oh," cried
> she, "Tom aghraghil, you're gone from me; how can I live without you
> now? Oh, Tom, my darling, why did you leave me?"

> It would bring the tears to any man's eyes to look at poor Mary Foley,
> and her heart nearly breaking. The neighbours took the body home, and
> there was a great wake in the Foleys' house that night. The
> neighbouring women comforted Mary the best way they could.

> "Don't be flying in the face of God, my dear," said one old woman;
> "sure nothing happens in the whole world without the will of the
> Almighty. It was the Lord took your husband, and you should bear the
> loss and be resigned; the Lord will reward you."

> Next day there was a great funeral, for Tom had many friends and
> relations. The parish priest himself went to the funeral; he didn't
> send the curate.

> The graveyard was four miles from Tom's village, and on the road home
> Mary Foley and her three brothers stopped at a public-house, half-way.
> They were tired, hungry, and dry; in need of refreshment. Mary's
> brothers had a friend of theirs with them, a man who lived two
> villages away--a fine, able, strong fellow, and he sat down with the
> company.

> When they had eaten a bite and taken some drink for themselves, Mary
> was complaining of her lonely condition, and the tears coming out of
> her eyes. "How am I to live without Tom?" asked she. "Sure everybody
> will be robbing me. I'll be beggared unless ye do something to help
> me."

> "Yerra, woman, how are we to help you?" said the oldest brother. "We
> have all we can do to mind our own families."

> "That's true for you," said the second brother, "but still and all we
> can mend the trouble. There is no way for you, Mary," said he, turning
> to the sister, "but to many, and the sooner you marry the better.
> Servant-men will neglect your work; they'll only be taking your money,
> and eating and drinking all before them. It's not long you'll have a
> roof over your head, if it's depending on servant-men you'll be. You
> must marry, and the sooner the better."

> With that the company had another glass.

> "Now, Mary," said the brother, "here is the man for you to marry--John
> Garvey, a friend of mine, and you couldn't find a better husband if
> you were to wait ten years for him."

> Mary started up against the brother, and wasn't it a shame for him,
> she said, to be scandalising her with his talk, and wouldn't it be
> fitter for him to have some respect for his only sister. The other
> brothers helped this one now, and the end of the whole matter was that
> before they left the public-house the match was made between John
> Garvey and Mary.

> "Follow my advice, Mary," said the eldest brother; "go straight to the
> priest's house and be married offhand; sure there's no good in
> waiting."

> "Wouldn't it be a shame before all the neighbours for me to marry on
> the day of my first husband's funeral?"

> "Sure the neighbours needn't know that you are married. Let them think
> that John is in service with you."

> "The priest wouldn't many us," said Mary, "if we asked him."

> "Believe me, he'll marry you if you pay him well," said the brother.

> Whether in her heart Mary was willing or not, no one knew, but she
> consented. "Have no fear," said the brothers; "no one will know
> anything of the marriage but the priest and ourselves."

> They went to the priest's house, and when all were inside, the
> servant-girl went up to the priest and said that Mrs. Foley was below
> in the kitchen. The priest came. He said he was very sorry for her
> loss, and asked what could he do for her? what was it brought her?

> "Oh, father," said she, "I am in a very bad way as I am. Every one
> will be striving to rob me, and nobody to do my work. My brothers tell
> me that if I'll be said by them I'll marry, and I'm thinking to follow
> their advice, and it's that that brought me."

> "Oh, you villain of a woman, to many a second time on the day of your
> first husband's funeral!"

> "Don't blame me, father," said Mary; "maybe you'd have another mind
> from what you have if you were in my place. Sure no one need be the
> wiser. Many me to this man here, John Garvey, and I'll give you three
> pounds."

> "I will not take it from you," said the priest.

> "Well, father, I'll give you all the money I have in my pocket: I'll
> give you five pounds."

> "I'll not marry you," said the priest.

> With that, one of the brothers took Mary aside and said: "Say that
> you'll give him the big pig you have as well as the money."

> "Well, father," said Mary, "with the five pounds I'll give you a fat
> pig that'll keep you in bacon for a twelvemonth."

> Now one of the brothers spoke up: "There is no need of publishing the
> marriage at present. People will think that John Garvey is in service
> with my sister."

> The priest wanted to refuse, and was opening his mouth, but the first
> word wasn't out when the curate took him aside and said:

> "Why not marry the poor woman? Marry her. No one will be the worse for
> it, and no one the wiser; and, besides, you'll have a supply of fine
> bacon."

> The priest consented at last. One of the brothers and the priest's own
> servant-girl were the witnesses, and nobody knew a word of what
> happened. Mary Foley that was--she was Mary Garvey now--paid the five
> pounds, left good health with the priest, and was thankful to him.
> Herself and her new husband went home and the brothers went to their
> own houses. There was no one before the young couple but the
> servant-girl and Tom Foley's mother. The old woman was surprised when
> she saw John Garvey, and wondered what brought him on the evening of
> Tom's funeral.

> Mary sent the servant-girl about a mile away on an errand, and when
> the girl was gone she turned to Garvey and said:

> "Well, John, bring your sister to-morrow to work for me, and I'll not
> delay you any longer."

> With that John turned away and Mary went with Foley's mother to an
> outhouse. While they were gone, Garvey went back, walked into his
> wife's room, shut the door, and stopped inside. After a time the
> servant girl came home and went to bed in her own place, and the poor
> old mother was left alone at the hearth, lamenting and mourning for
> her son dead and buried.

> When the light was out and all was still and quiet, about ten o'clock,
> Tom Foley came home, after burying his brother. He tried to open the
> door. It was bolted; he knocked. The mother went to the door, and when
> she heard Tom's voice she was frightened and asked what was troubling
> his soul, that he'd come back from the other world after being buried
> that day.

> "Oh, mother," said Foley, "open the door and leave me in."

> "I will not," said the mother. "You cannot come in, my son; but tell
> me what is troubling your soul. I'll have masses said for you and give
> alms."

> Foley was very tired after the journey, and couldn't stop at the door
> any longer. He went to the barn; there was a large heap of straw in
> one end of it, and four or five pigs with the big pig at the other
> end. Foley lay down in the straw and soon he was asleep.

> During the evening the parish priest began to be in dread that the
> woman might change her mind; now that she was married she might put
> the pig aside and he'd be left without his bacon. So he called his
> servant-boy and told him to bring the big pig from Mrs. Foley's.

> The boy took a whip and went to Tom's house for the pig. He knew well
> where was the barn and where was the pig. When he came to the barn he
> went in and stirred up the pigs; they began to screech and make a
> great noise. The big pig being so bulky and strong, wouldn't go out,
> and Foley woke up with the screeching. He looked around to know what
> was troubling the pigs, and saw the boy striving to take the big one
> away with him. Tom was in very bad humour, so he made after the boy
> and gave him a good blow in the back with a wattle, and asked, is it
> stealing he was at that hour of the night?

> The boy was knocked, but if he was, he rose quickly and away with him
> like the wind. He didn't get another blow, though he had three or four
> falls from fright before he reached the priest's house, thinking that
> Foley was after him. When he went in there was terror in his heart.
> The priest asked, did he bring the pig so soon? He said he didn't
> bring the pig, and he couldn't, for Tom Foley was minding the place as
> well as if he wasn't buried at all.

> "What's that you tell me?" asked the priest.

> "Oh, father, sure when I went to bring the pig Tom Foley was inside in
> the straw. The pigs made a noise, and he ran after me with a big
> wattle and asked why was I disturbing his pigs at that hour of the
> night. He gave me a blow in the back and knocked me on the road. I got
> three or four other falls from fright before I came home."

> "Yerra, go, my boy, and bring me the pig. It's some stranger that's in
> it; it's thieving he is. If you don't bring the pig to-night, maybe we
> won't have him to bring on Monday."

> "Whatever you do, father, or whatever will happen to the pig, I won't
> face Foley a second time," said the boy.

> The priest called a small boy that he had herding, and said, "Go you
> and bring the big pig from Foley's."

> "I'll go if somebody goes with me."

> "Oh, I'll go with him," said the curate's brother, who happened to be
> visiting him. "I know the place, and I knew Tom Foley."

> The two went off together, and the curate's brother stopped a couple
> of fields away from Foley's house. The boy went on, and when he began
> to drive out the big pig, the pig made a noise that woke Foley a
> second time, and he went after this boy more venomously than after the
> first one. The boy ran for his life to the field where the curate's
> brother was. Foley had to turn back, and didn't catch him. The
> curate's brother saw Foley hunting the boy, and knew that 'twas no lie
> for the first boy, that the ghost was in it. The two hurried home with
> what strength was in their legs.

> "Oh, then, Foley's ghost is there as sure as I am standing before
> you," said the brother to the curate in presence of the priest.

> On the following morning Foley rose out of the barn drowsy and queer
> after the night. The door of his house was closed and he had no chance
> of going in. "I will go to first mass," thought Tom, "with the clothes
> I have on; Mary will be up before me when I come home. I can sleep the
> remainder of the day and take a good rest."

> Whenever a man going the way saw Foley he left the road to him and ran
> through the field. Foley didn't know why people were leaving the road
> to him. When he went into the chapel all made a rush towards the
> altar. The priest, who came out at the moment, asked the people what
> ailed them.

> "Oh, God between us and harm," said one, "Tom Foley is here from the
> other world."

> The priest called Foley by name, and asked, was he there?

> "Why shouldn't I be here, father? Don't you see me?"

> "Tell me, in the name of God, where did you come from?" asked the
> priest.

> "Where would I come from," said Foley, "but from my own house?"

> "Sure the whole parish knows that you were drowned," said the priest,
> "and buried yesterday. Wasn't I at your funeral myself?"

> "Well, then, you and the whole parish were mistaken," said Foley. "I
> buried my brother John yesterday eight miles beyond Tralee."

> "And who was the man that was drowned?" asked the priest.

> "I left my brother's servant-man here fishing instead of myself. Maybe
> he was drowned and the people buried him. I know well that they didn't
> bury me."

> The priest stepped out and called the curate, and told him that Foley
> wasn't dead at all. "Do you hurry now to Tom's house," said he, "and
> tell John Garvey to be off with himself, that Foley is alive and will
> be home very soon, and when Garvey is gone tell Mrs. Foley that I'll
> come with Tom after first mass, and to be ready for him."

> The curate hurried away, and the priest went in to Foley. "Your wife
> may not believe that you are not dead," said he. "I will go with you
> after mass and tell her that you are not dead at all."

> "I knew," said Tom, "that there was something wrong. It was late last
> night when I came home. My wife was in bed, no one up before me but my
> mother, and she wouldn't open the door for me, but began to ask what
> was troubling my soul. She said to tell her, and she would give alms
> and have mass said for me. Now I know why this was."

> "It will be the same with her to-day," said the priest. "I'll go to
> the house with you."

> The two went to the house after mass. When Mary Foley saw Tom she
> dropped on the bench and looked as though she'd die from fright.

> "Don't be afraid," said the priest. "It wasn't Tom that was buried but
> his brother's servant-man."

> Tom told the wife how he gave the loan of his coat to the servant-man
> and went to bury his brother John. The wife was satisfied now. The
> priest took her aside, and told her to have no trouble of mind on
> account of what she had done by getting married.

> "You meant no harm," said he, "but no one in the world must know a
> word about it. You and I will keep our own--do you keep the big pig
> and I'll keep my five pounds."
