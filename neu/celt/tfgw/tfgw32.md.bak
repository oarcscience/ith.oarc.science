NOTE

> The following curious story reminds one a little of Slavic tales of
> dead men who dwell in their tombs as in houses. Some of the Slav
> tomb-dwellers are harmless, others malignant. The malignant ones are
> dead persons who rise up bodily and go around at night devouring
> people. When one of these has eaten a victim he rushes back to his
> grave, for he is obliged to remain wherever he may be at cock-crow; if
> outside his grave, he falls stiff and helpless to lie there till the
> next night. There are two ways of giving a quietus to such a ghoul.
> One is to pin him to the earth by driving a stake of aspen wood
> through his heart; the other is to burn him to ashes. The burning, as
> described in Russian tales, is performed by a great crowd of people
> armed with bushes, long brooms, shovels, and rakes. These gather round
> the fire to drive back everything that comes from the body. When the
> body is on the fire a short time it bursts, and a whole legion of
> devilry rush forth in the form of worms, snakes, bats, beetles, flies,
> birds; these try with all their might to get away. Each carries the
> fate of the ghoul with it. If only one of them escapes, the dead man
> will be eating people the next night as actively as ever, but if the
> crowd drive every thing into the fire again he will be destroyed
> utterly.

> A striking trait in the Irish fairy tales is the number of observances
> caused by the presence of fairies, rules of ordinary living, so to
> speak. For instance, nothing is more pleasing to fairies than a
> well-swept kitchen and clean water. A dirty kitchen and foul water
> bring their resentment.

> The ghosts or night-walking dead, as they belong to the other world,
> seem to have at least in some cases the same likes and dislikes as the
> fairies. in the following tale Michael Derrihy, the dead man brought
> from the tomb by Kate, kills the three brothers because the people in
> the house did not throw out dirty water and brought in none that was
> clean, and he is determined that they shall stay killed, for he tries
> to do away with the only cure that can bring them to life again.
> Various acts of personal uncleanliness involve punishment from the
> fairies, in one tale they carry off from a mother an infant which she
> fails to wash properly; in another a careless, untidy girl, who rises
> in the night and commits offensive acts in the kitchen, is punished in
> a signal manner. There is present a whole party of fairies; men and
> women, though unseen by the girl. One of the women, who is making tea,
> takes a saucer and hurls it at her as she is returning to bed. The
> saucer is broken; one half flies over the bed to the wall beyond, the
> other is buried in the girl's hip. She screams and wakes the whole
> house. No one can help her She is in bed for three years after that in
> great suffering. No relief for her till her mother, who had just
> earned the gratitude of the fairies by acts of service, prays to have
> her daughter cured.

> The fairy woman tells how the daughter offended and how she was
> punished, says that if the mother will go to the wall she will find
> one half of the saucer there; if she applies that to the affected part
> of the daughter's body it will cure her. The mother does as directed.
> One half of the saucer comes out of the hip to join the other, and the
> girl is cured straightway.

> When the fairies are maltreated or despised they take ample vengeance;
> they punish severely. They are generous in a like degree for services
> or acts of kindness. So far as fairy methods of action are revealed to
> us in tales and popular beliefs, they constitute a system of rewards
> and punishments regulating the intercourse between this world and
> another. They are parts of an early religion in which material
> services are rewarded by material benefits, and in which conduct
> bordering upon morality is inculcated.

> The ghosts, mainly malignant and nearly all women, are represented as
> partly under fairy rules and partly under Church punishment. Their
> position is not fixed so definitely.
