Maggie Doyle and the Dead Man

>  

> LONG ago, when I was a fine, strong girl, not the like of what I am
> this day, I went down the country with a bag of sea-moss to sell. I
> was in company with a girl from the next village, and she was carrying
> another bag. Coming evening, the other girl found lodgings for the
> night with a friend, and I walked ahead on the road for myself. I
> wasn't long walking when I met a woman, and she took me home with her.
> It was milking time when we came. The woman, whose name was Peggy
> Driscoll, put cream into a chum, and told me to churn while herself
> would be milking.

> I churned away while she was with the cows, and when the milking was
> over, she helped me, and the two of us were churning till the butter
> came. She never asked me to take a bite or a sup, not even a drink of
> butter-milk. I had food of my own with me, and made a supper of that.
> After supper she said: "There is a dead man above in the room; come
> with me." "Oh, God save us!" said I, "how is that, and who is it?" "My
> own husband, John Driscoll, and he's dead these three hours."

> "God knows, then," thought I to myself, "tis easy enough you are
> taking his death."

> She brought warm water, and we went up, the two of us; we prepared the
> body of John Driscoll, dressed it, and laid it out, and put beads in
> the hands of the dead man, who was stiff and cold.

> "I must go out now for a little start," said Peggy Driscoll; "sure
> you'll not be in dread of the corpse while I go to tell some of the
> neighbours that John is dead."

> I was that in dread that it failed me to speak to her. The next minute
> she was gone and the door closed behind her. I was left alone with the
> corpse. I stopped there a while and went then to the kitchen, sat
> there a quarter of an hour, and went back to the dead man.

> About midnight the woman of the house walked in, and with her a
> neighbouring young farmer. She made tea in the kitchen, and the two
> were eating and drinking for themselves with great pleasure, laughing
> and joking. They were talking English. I hadn't but two or three words
> of English at that time, and John Driscoll not a word at all, but
> after a while the young farmer laughed, and, forgetting himself, said
> in Irish:

> "It's a happy woman you are this night, Peggy, and the old man above
> on the table."

> With that, the corpse sprang up, tumbling candles and everything
> before him. He caught a pike that was in the corner, and down to the
> kitchen with him. Peggy Driscoll and the young farmer began to screech
> in the way you'd think the life would leave the two of them, but by my
> word they hadn't long to screech in the kitchen, for the pike was
> coming at them. Out with the two through the back door and John
> Driscoll at their heels. I took my bag and away with me through the
> front door. I was running for hours and hurrying on. I didn't know
> where was I going, till at last I met a man, and asked what was the
> next town, and he said Killarney. I went on till I came to Killarney,
> and sold my bag of sea-moss to the first buyer, and took the road home
> for myself.

>  

>  

> "Did you go to Killarney with moss the second time?" asked I. "I did
> indeed," said she. "I went the next week, and I met a woman on the
> road, a cousin of John Driscoll's."

> "You told me," said I, "that you and Peggy Driscoll laid out John on
> the table; that he was stiff and cold, a real corpse. How, then, could
> he rise up and run with a pike at his wife and the young farmer?"

> "it was that that frightened me," said Mrs. Doyle; "but this woman
> told me everything. John Driscoll had a twin brother Daniel, and the
> two were so much alike that no man could tell one from the other.
> Peggy; John's wife, was from a distant parish, and she didn't know
> that Daniel was in the world at all. She was married to John only six
> months. The day that I was passing Peggy was away with a sick woman, a
> neighbour, from the morning till the middle of the afternoon. While
> she was gone Daniel came to see his brother for the first time since
> his marriage. He wasn't two hours in the house when he died in one
> minute, as if something pricked his heart. It was then that John
> planned to make a trial of Peggy So he put his own clothes on Daniel,
> and laid the corpse on the bed above in the room and hid under the bed
> himself. Peggy put Daniel on the table, thinking that it was her own
> husband she was laying out. While Peggy was gone for the young farmer,
> and I was in the kitchen, John put the corpse under the bed and went
> on the table himself. You have the whole story now"

>  

>  

> "I suppose you can tell me a story now with a real ghost in it,"
> remarked I.

> "Indeed, then, I can," said the old woman, "and a true story, too. I
> didn't know John Doyle myself nor his son, for they lived across the
> mountains from us, and John Doyle died a few months after my marriage,
> but my husband told me all about John and his son, and my husband was
> a man who wouldn't tell a lie, God rest his soul."
