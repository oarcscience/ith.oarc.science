The Cattle Jobber of Awnascawil

> Do the fairies ever do harm for the pleasure of hurting people?" asked
> I of Maurice Fitzgerald.

> 'Whether they harm single men without reason I can't say," replied he,
> "but they injure a whole country-side sometimes."

> "Oh, they do," said Duvane.

> "I remember a story in which they punish a single man and destroy all
> the crops along the road they are travelling, and here it is for you."

>  

>  

> There was a cattle jobber once who was going to a fair near
> Awnascawil, and he met the good people \[fairies\] about nightfall on
> the way. They took him with them and turned from the road into a
> lonely field in which was a large fairy fort. When they went in he saw
> a house as grand as any he had ever put foot in. The company ate and
> drank enough, and the good people pressed him to sit at the table, but
> he would taste neither food nor drink.

> Next morning after breakfast they went out, leaving no one behind but
> their piper, whose name was Tim.

> "You are not to let that man out of this while we are gone," said they
> to the piper.

> The jobber noticed that when they were going, every one of the fairies
> dipped his finger in a box that hung by the door and rubbed his eyes.
> When the jobber thought that they were off a good distance he said to
> himself: "I'm man enough for this piper." With that he began to lace
> his shoes and prepare for his journey.

> "What are you doing?" asked the piper.

> "I'm going to be off out o' this," said the jobber. "I think it long
> enough that I'm here."

> "You'll not leave this while I am in it," said the piper. "You heard
> the order to keep you here till they came back."

> "Indeed then you'll not keep me, and I won't stay with you." With that
> he rose, and no sooner was he on his feet than the piper caught him
> and they went at each other.

> In the wrestling the jobber knocked Tim across a tub that was standing
> on the floor and broke his back. The piper didn't stir after that: how
> could he and his back broken. With that the jobber sprang to the door,
> put his finger in the box and rubbed one eye with the finger in the
> same way that he saw the fairies doing, and when his eye was rubbed he
> could see all the fairies in the world with that eye if they were
> before him, and not a one could he see with the other eye. He set
> forward then, spent one night on the road, and as the fair was to be
> held on the following day he stopped in a house not far from the fair
> ground. The day was close and warm and the jobber was thirsty, so he
> asked for a drink of water.

> "You'll get it and welcome," said the woman of the house, "and it
> isn't water I'd give you to drink, but milk, if I could go for it, but
> I can't leave the cradle as something is the matter with the child
> since yesterday; neither I nor my husband slept a wink last night from
> taking care of him, and he screeching always."

> "Well," said the jobber, "I'll take care of the cradle while you are
> after the milk, and sure the child will not die during that time."

> The woman went for the milk, and the jobber rocked the cradle. He
> noticed that the screeching was different from the crying of a child,
> and caught hold of the blanket to take it from the child's face; but,
> if he did, the child had a firm grip of the clothes, and the jobber
> had to tear away the blanket. When he had the blanket away he saw what
> was in the cradle, and what was it, sure enough, but Tim the Piper.
> The man and his wife were young people, and the child was their
> firstborn.

> "What brought you here, you scoundrel?" asked the jobber.

> "Oh, when you broke my back," said Tim, "I could do nothing for the
> good people; they had no further use for me in the fort, so they put
> me here and took the child of the house with them."

> "If you are here itself, why can't you hold your tongue and not be
> destroying the people with your screeching? Sure this is a good place
> you are in."

> "Oh," said the piper, "I wouldn't cry, but for the rocking; it's the
> rocking that's killing me. It was you that broke my back, and don't
> expose me now."

> "I'll expose you this minute," said the jobber, "unless you stop
> quiet."

> "I'll stop quiet," said the piper.

> When the woman came back the child was not crying. "What did you do to
> quiet him?" asked she.

> "I only uncovered his face, and said that I'd kill him if he didn't
> stop quiet, and I suppose the child is in dread, as I am a stranger."

> "You might as well stay the night with us," said the woman.

> The jobber agreed, and as the child was quiet the mother could look to
> her work. When her husband came home in the evening she told him that
> the child had stopped crying since the stranger came, and the husband
> was glad.

> "As the child is peaceable," said the jobber to the mother, "I'll take
> care of him to-night; you can go to bed."

> The parents went to bed and left the child with their guest. About
> midnight the man saw that he was growing sleepy, and he pushed Tim and
> asked, "Couldn't you play a tune that would keep me awake?"

> "It would be hard for me to play and my back broken," said Tim, "but
> if I had the pipes and you'd prop me in the cradle I might play."

> "Where are the pipes?"

> "My pipes were brought here," said Tim; "they are on the corner of the
> loft above the fireplace."

> The jobber rose up, took the pipes, and fitted them together. The
> piper began to play, and his music was so sweet that it could raise
> the dead out of the grave. He was not long playing when the father and
> mother heard the music, and they had never heard the like of it.

> "Who is the piper?" asked the man.

> "I am," said the jobber; "when I am on the road I play often to amuse
> myself."

> Tim threw away the pipes then, stretched back, and stopped quiet till
> morning. The father and mother were glad that their child was resting.
> After breakfast the jobber asked the mother had they good turf, and
> she said they had. "Bring in two or three creels of it," said he.

> She brought the turf, and he put it down on the fire. When the fire
> was blazing well the mother was outside. Said the jobber to Tim: "You
> were a bad host when I met you last, and you'll not be here any
> longer; I'll burn you now."

> He went to the door then to call the mother He wanted her to see what
> would happen, and not finding her he came back to the cradle, but
> found nothing in it except the clothes. Then he got terribly afraid
> that he would be brought to account for the child.

> The mother came in and asked: 'Where is my child?"

> He told her everything. He and the woman went to the door to search
> for the piper, and what should the woman see outside the door but her
> own child. She was very glad then. The jobber gave her good-bye and
> started for the fair. On the way he felt a great storm of wind and
> hail coming towards him, and stooped down for shelter under a bush at
> the side of a ditch. When the storm was passing he saw that it was a
> legion of fairies destroying everything before them, tearing up potato
> stalks and all that stood in their way.

> "Oh, shame!" cried the jobber, "to be ruining poor people's labour.

> A slender, foxy, red-haired man, a fairy, turned towards him, and,
> putting his finger into the jobber's eye, took the sight from him.
> Never again did he see a fairy. When the foxy fairy went back to the
> \[horde of fairies\] he asked: "Did ye see that man who was with us in
> the fort, the man who broke the back of Tim the Piper, and did ye hear
> what he said?"

> "We did not."

> "Well, I saw him and heard him. I took the sight from him; he'll never
> see one of us again."

> The jobber went to the fair, though he had but the one eye.
