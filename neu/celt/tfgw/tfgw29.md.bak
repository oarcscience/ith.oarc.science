> The burial customs of Ireland are very interesting because they throw
> light on beliefs concerning another life--beliefs that were once
> universal on the island and are held yet in a certain way by a good
> many people. There is much variety in the burial customs of the whole
> country, but I can refer only to one or two details which are observed
> carefully in the peninsula west of Killarney.

> When the coffin is ready to be taken to the grave the lid is nailed
> down, but when it is at the edge of the grave the nails are drawn and
> placed one across another on the lid, which is left unfastened.

> In arranging the corpse in the coffin the feet are generally fastened
> together to keep them in position. This is done frequently by pinning
> the stockings to each other; but however done, the fastening is
> removed before burial and the feet are left perfectly free. The corpse
> is not bound in any way or confined in the coffin. That it is held
> necessary to free the feet of the corpse is shown by what happened
> once in Cahirciveen. A man died and his widow forgot to remove the
> pins fastening his stockings to each other. The voice of the dead man
> came to the woman on the night after the funeral, telling her that his
> feet were bound, and to free them. Next day she had the grave opened,
> took the pins from the stockings, and left the feet untrammelled.

> It is believed as firmly by some people that the dead rise from their
> graves time after time, each by himself independently, as it is by
> others that all men will rise ages hence at one call and be judged for
> their deeds simultaneously. Besides the separate movements of each
> dead person we have the great social apparition on the night of All
> Saints, when the dead come to the houses of their friends and sit by
> the fire, unseen of all save those who are to die within the coming
> year. In view of this visit a good fire is made, the room is swept
> carefully, and prayers are repeated.

> When I inquired why the nails were drawn from the coffin and bonds
> removed from the corpse with such care, some persons said that it was
> an old superstition, others that it was an old custom, and others
> still that it was done to give the dead man his freedom.

> In the following tale, that relating to John Cokeley, we have a good
> instance of punishment by fairies. The head and front of John's
> offending was that he stopped the passage against the fairies. The
> first result of that act was a slight attack of illness, the second
> his removal to another world, which, though invisible to all between
> sunrise and sunset, and visible between sunset and sunrise to few
> only, is right here on earth. Cokeley's place in the house is held by
> a fairy substitute with a ravenous appetite, a sour temper, and a
> sharp tongue, the usual qualities of such an agent.

> I know one old man who has an afflicted daughter, and who believes
> firmly that she has been put in his house by the fairies; he thinks
> that his own daughter was taken away and this creature given to him.
> This one has the "tongue of an attorney," while his daughter was a
> "quiet, honest girl."

> The crowning proofs that Cokeley was taken by the fairies are that he
> was seen repeatedly after sunset, and the sick man refused before his
> death to see the priest.

> In the tale of Tom Foley there is no real ghost, but there is strong
> evidence of a general and firm belief that ghosts go among men and are
> active on earth.
