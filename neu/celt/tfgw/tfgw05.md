The Knights of Kerry - Rahonain Castle

> "Is there a story about the beginning of Rahonain Castle?" asked I.

> "There is," said Maurice Fitzgerald, "and though I am not good at
> stories, I'll do the best I can and tell it to you."

>  

>  

> Long ago, when the knights of Kerry were in Dingle and wished to build
> a castle in the neighbourhood, they went to a place above Ventry, and
> the chief knight set men to work there. When the men began work a
> voice came up through the earth, telling them to go home and not mind
> that place. They put their spades on their shoulders and walked away.

> They went back to work on the following day, but if they did they
> heard the same voice telling them to leave that.

> The men looked at one another, put their spades on their shoulders,
> and went back to Dingle.

> On the third morning the chief knight put all the men to work in the
> same place, and stood watching them. The voice came through the earth
> and spoke to the knight, saying that if he wished to keep a fair name,
> to go away and leave the good people \[fairies\] in peace.

> "Where am I to build my castle?" asked the knight.

> "Beyond there at Rahonain," said the voice.

> Work was begun at Rahonain, and as no place was provided for the
> workmen they went to people's houses in spite of them. If the man of a
> house wouldn't give what they wanted they would kill his cow or his
> pig, if he'd have the like, or they'd be vexing him in some way. If he
> had neither cow nor pig they'd give him a blow in the face, so the
> first other time he'd have something good for them.

> Trant lived in Cahir a Trant at that time, and his nurse lived in Kil
> Vicadowny. The knight's men came across Trant's nurse, and the poor
> woman couldn't do well for them, for there was no one in the house but
> herself--she hadn't in the world but one cow and one pig. When the men
> were not getting what they wanted they killed the cow on the poor
> woman. As soon as she saw that she went over to Trant and told him her
> story.

> "I can do nothing for you now," said he, "but the next other day they
> come send me word."

> Some evenings after they came and she sent word. Trant came quickly.
> The men were inside, laughing and joking, making sport of the old
> woman.

> "Were you not here a night before with my nurse?" asked Trant. "Why
> did you not conduct yourselves like men--take what she could give, and
> not kill her little cow?"

> "We killed the cow," said one of them, "and 'tis the pig we'll take on
> her this turn."

> Trant did nothing then but close the door and face the men. He took
> the ears off each one of them. He went out after that and took the
> tail and ears off each horse and let them all loose.

> The men and the horses went home to the knight, who was raging when he
> saw them.

> There was only a small chapel at Ventry, in the graveyard.

> The knights were so proud they must enter the chapel before others.
> Common people had to wait outside till the knights went in, and when
> mass was over the people had to go first. The knights were the first
> to go in and the last to come out, and they stood always near the
> altar.

> The Sunday after he cut the ears off the men, Trant went to mass on
> horseback and the wife behind him on a pillion. When he was riding
> along the strand and not far from the graveyard the horse stumbled and
> knocked himself and the wife.

> "Come away home now," said the wife, "something will happen."

> "I will not," said Trant, "and I don't care for the horse or what will
> happen."

> After mass Trant was outside the chapel, the knights came out, caught
> him and killed him in the graveyard.

> Trant's wife was at home; she turned back after the horse fell, but
> when she heard that her husband was dead in the churchyard she came to
> him, dying, and left her little son, nine months old, to another woman
> to nurse. While Trant's wife was keening over her husband the nurse
> hadn't patience to stay in the house, but ran out to the strand and
> left the child in a cradle alone. A banshee came then and took the
> child to a fairy fort half a mile beyond the church. When the nurse
> hurried back from the strand she found no sign of the child and was
> terrified. She searched through the whole house and around it, and as
> she didn't find the child anywhere she went running towards Kil
> Vicadowny to know did Trant's nurse take the little boy, but while she
> was going a voice called to her:

> "Stop awhile and don't face that way: I'll tell you where the child
> is. It is not where you are going that he is, but in the fairy fort.
> If you do what I tell you and hurry you'll have him back; if not
> you'll lose him for ever. Run to that fort there beyond the graveyard,
> stop at the first house on the way, you'll find a skein of black flax
> thread inside in the house; put it around your left hand. You'll find
> a black-handled knife in the dresser, take that in your right hand and
> run; when you come to the fairy fort tie the end of the skein to a
> briar in the door of the fort; let the thread be unwinding from you
> till you are inside in the fairy kitchen. The child is there with a
> brown-haired woman, and she rocking him in a cradle. He has drunk
> twice of enchanted breast milk, and if he has the third drink you will
> never bring him home with you."

> The nurse did all this, and did it quickly. She went into the house
> without saying a word. She caught the skein of flax thread and took
> the black-handled knife with her. She faced the fairy fort, tied the
> end of the skein to a briar, and let it unwind as she went till she
> came to the place where the woman was rocking the child in a cradle of
> gold. She raised the child and put the skein around him.

> "A short life to the woman who gave you directions," said the
> brown-haired woman.

> "I'll cross her," said the nurse, "and your curse will not fall on
> her."

> When she was taking the child from the cradle the brown-haired woman
> gave him one blow on the check and said: "Take that and may it live
> long with you!" After that blow some of the Trants used always to go
> out of their minds. The child was brought home and grew up in good
> health. His grandfather was alive, but blind. When the boy was fifteen
> years of age the grandfather had three yearling stallions, and he told
> his men to put the best of the three in a stable for seven years and
> not to let him out for one moment.

> At the end of seven years the grandfather sent for young Trant to come
> till he'd feel his bones to know were they hard enough.

> "Mount the horse now," said the old man, when he had passed his hands
> over the grandson.

> The horse was brought, and the young man mounted.

> "Give him his head," said the grandfather, "but not too much of it
> when he's going towards the sea or the mountain."

> Young Trant took his course back to Kil Vicadowny, and around the foot
> of Mount Eagle; from that he rode to Rahonain Mountain. He held on
> through high places, went far to the east, where he turned at last,
> and was making for home by the way of Ballymore.

> One part of the cliff west of Ballymore goes farther toward the north
> than the rest of it. He was trying to turn the horse with the ridge,
> but he could not, so he gave him rein, and he jumped from the cliff, a
> distance of 220 feet, and the place is known as Trant's Leap to this
> day.

> The grandfather had a watch out to know when the young man would be
> coming, and the stable doors were barred; he was in dread the horse
> would rush into the stable and kill the grandson. When the horse was
> home he ran to the stable, but the door to his own part was closed,
> lie went from door to door then, but when all doors were closed he
> came back to his own place and stopped there.

> The grandfather was led up, and put his hands on the young man to know
> in what way was he after the journey.

> "Oh, you are able now," said he, "to knock satisfaction out of the
> knights for the death of your father. Come with me to the chapel next
> Sunday. When all the poor people go out I will stand in the door and
> you will work away inside on the knights with what strength there is
> in you."

> When all the people were out on the following Sunday young Trant put
> his grandfather in the door and told him for God's sake to hold it. He
> went in and worked with his sword till he stretched sixty knights, all
> that were in it that day but one, who forced his way out between the
> legs of the old man and killed him.

> Young Trant brought the grandfather home on his back, and that day was
> the last for the Knights of Dingle. The one knight who escaped through
> the door died of fright at the first place where he stopped, the place
> where the chief knight began to build the castle, and from that day
> the place is called Downall's Bed after him.
