The Blood-Drawing Ghost

>  

> THERE was a young man in the parish of Drimalegue, county Cork, who
> was courting three girls at one time, and he didn't know which of them
> would he take; they had equal fortunes, and any of the three was as
> pleasing to him as any other. One day when he was coming home from the
> fair with his two sisters, the sisters began:

> 'Well, John," said one of them, "why don't you get married. Why don't
> you take either Mary, or Peggy, or Kate?"

> "I can't tell you that," said John, "till I find which of them has the
> best wish for me."

> "How will you know?" asked the other.

> "I will tell you that as soon as any person will die in the parish."
> In three weeks' time from that day an old man died. John went to the
> wake and then to the funeral. While they were burying the corpse in
> the graveyard John stood near a tomb which was next to the grave, and
> when all were going away, after burying the old man, he remained
> standing a while by himself, as if thinking of something; then he put
> his blackthorn stick on top of the tomb, stood a while longer, and on
> going from the graveyard left the stick behind him. He went home and
> ate his supper. After supper John went to a neighbour's house where
> young people used to meet of an evening, and the three girls happened
> to be there that time. John was very quiet, so that every one noticed
> him.

> "What is troubling you this evening, John?" asked one of the girls.

> "Oh, I am sorry for my beautiful blackthorn," said he.

> "Did you lose it?"

> "I did not," said John; "but I left it on the top of the tomb next to
> the grave of the man who was buried to-day, and whichever of you three
> will go for it is the woman I'll marry. Well, Mary will you go for my
> stick?" asked he.

> "Faith, then, I will not," said Mary.

> "Well, Peggy, will you go?"

> "If I were without a man for ever," said Peggy, "I wouldn't go."

> "Well, Kate," said he to the third, "will you go for my stick? If you
> go I'll marry you."

> "Stand to your word," said Kate, "and I'll bring the stick."

> "Believe me, that I will," said John.

> Kate left the company behind her, and went for the stick. The
> graveyard was three miles away and the walk was a long one. Kate came
> to the place at last and made out the tomb by the fresh grave. When
> she had her hand on the blackthorn a voice called from the tomb:

> "Leave the stick where it is and open this tomb for me."

> Kate began to tremble and was greatly in dread, but something was
> forcing her to open the tomb--she couldn't help herself.

> "Take the lid off now," said the dead man when Kate had the door open
> and was inside in the tomb, "and take me out of this--take me on your
> back."

> Afraid to refuse, she took the lid from the coffin, raised the dead
> man on her back, and walked on in the way he directed. She walked
> about the distance of a mile. The load, being very heavy, was near
> breaking her back and killing her. She walked half a mile farther and
> came to a village; the houses were at the side of the road.

> "Take me to the first house," said the dead man.

> She took him.

> "Oh, we cannot go in here," said he, when they came near. "The people
> have clean water inside, and they have holy water, too. Take me to the
> next house."

> She went to the next house.

> "We cannot go in there," said he, when she stopped in front of the
> door. "They have clean water, and there is holy water as well."

> She went to the third house.

> "Go in here," said the dead man. "There is neither clean water nor
> holy water in this place; we can stop in it."

> They went in.

> "Bring a chair now and put me sitting at the side of the fire. Then
> find me something to eat and to drink."

> She placed him in a chair by the hearth, searched the house, found a
> dish of oatmeal and brought it. "I have nothing to give you to drink
> but dirty water," said she.

> "Bring me a dish and a razor."

> She brought the dish and the razor.

> "Come, now," said he, "to the room above."

> They went up to the room, where three young men, sons of the man of
> the house, were sleeping in bed, and Kate had to hold the dish while
> the dead man was drawing their blood.

> "Let the father and mother have that," said he, "in return for the
> dirty water"; meaning that if there was clean water in the house he
> wouldn't have taken the blood of the young men. He closed their wounds
> in the way that there was no sign of a cut on them. "Mix this now with
> the meal, get a dish of it for yourself and another for me."

> She got two plates and put the oatmeal in it after mixing it, and
> brought two spoons. Kate wore a handkerchief on her head; she put this
> under her neck and tied it; she was pretending to eat, but she was
> putting the food to hide in the handkerchief till her plate was empty.

> "Have you your share eaten?" asked the dead man.

> "I have," answered Kate.

> "I'll have mine finished this minute," said he, and soon after he gave
> her the empty dish. She put the dishes back in the dresser, and didn't
> mind washing them. "Come, now," said he, "and take me back to the
> place where you found me."

> "Oh, how can I take you back; you are too great a load; 'twas killing
> me you were when I brought you." She was in dread of going from the
> house again.

> "You are stronger after that food than what you were in coming; take
> me back to my grave."

> She went against her will. She rolled up the food inside the
> handkerchief. There was a deep hole in the wall of the kitchen by the
> door, where the bar was slipped in when they barred the door; into
> this hole she put the handkerchief. In going back she shortened the
> road by going through a big field at command of the dead man. When
> they were at the top of the field she asked, was there any cure for
> those young men whose blood was drawn?

> "There is no cure," said he, "except one. If any of that food had been
> spared, three bits of it in each young man's mouth would bring them to
> life again, and they'd never know of their death."

> "Then," said Kate in her own mind, "that cure is to be had."

> "Do you see this field?" asked the dead man.

> "I do."

> "Well, there is as much gold buried in it as would make rich people of
> all who belong to you. Do you see the three leachtans \[piles of small
> stones\]? Underneath each of them is a pot of gold."

> The dead man looked around for a while; then Kate went on, without
> stopping, till she came to the wall of the graveyard, and just then
> they heard the cock crow.

> "The cock is crowing," said Kate; "it's time for me to be going home."

> "It is not time yet," said the dead man; "that is a bastard cock." A
> moment after that another cock crowed. "There the cocks are crowing a
> second time," said she. "No," said the dead man, "that is a bastard
> cock again; that's no right bird." They came to the mouth of the tomb
> and a cock crowed the third time.

> "Well," said the girl, "that must be the right cock."

> "Ah, my girl, that cock has saved your life for you. But for him I
> would have you with me in the grave for evermore, and if I knew this
> cock would crow before I was in the grave you wouldn't have the
> knowledge you have now of the field and the gold. Put me into the
> coffin where you found me. Take your time and settle me well. I cannot
> meddle with you now, and 'tis sorry I am to part with you."

> "Will you tell me who you are?" asked Kate.

> "Have you ever heard your father or mother mention a man called Edward
> Derrihy or his son Michael?"

> "It's often I heard tell of them," replied the girl.

> "Well, Edward Derrihy was my father; I am Michael. That blackthorn
> that you came for to-night to this graveyard was the lucky stick for
> you, but if you had any thought of the danger that was before you, you
> wouldn't be here. Settle me carefully and close the tomb well behind
> you."

> She placed him in the coffin carefully, closed the door behind her,
> took the blackthorn stick, and away home with Kate. The night was far
> spent when she came. She was tired, and it's good reason the girl had.
> She thrust the stick into the thatch above the door of the house and
> rapped. Her sister rose up and opened the door.

> "Where did you spend the night?" asked the sister. "Mother will kill
> you in the morning for spending the whole night from home."

> "Go to bed," answered Kate, "and never mind me."

> They went to bed, and Kate fell asleep the minute she touched the bed,
> she was that tired after the night.

> When the father and mother of the three young men rose next morning,
> and there was no sign of their sons, the mother went to the room to
> call them, and there she found the three dead. She began to screech
> and wring her hands. She ran to the road screaming and wailing. All
> the neighbours crowded around to know what trouble was on her. She
> told them her three sons were lying dead in their bed after the night.
> Very soon the report spread in every direction. When Kate's father and
> mother heard it they hurried off to the house of the dead men. When
> they came home Kate was still in bed; the mother took a stick and
> began to beat the girl for being out all the night and in bed all the
> day.

> "Get up now, you lazy stump of a girl," said she, "and go to the wake
> house; your neighbour's three sons are dead."

> Kate took no notice of this. "I am very tired and sick," said she.
> "You'd better spare me and give me a drink."

> The mother gave her a drink of milk and a bite to eat, and in the
> middle of the day she rose up.

> "Tis a shame for you not to be at the wake house yet," said the
> mother; "hurry over now."

> When Kate reached the house there was a great crowd of people before
> her and great wailing. She did not cry, but was looking on. The father
> was as if wild, going up and down the house wringing his hands.

> "Be quiet," said Kate. "Control yourself."

> "How can I do that, my dear girl, and my three fine sons lying dead in
> the house?"

> "What would you give," asked Kate, "to the person who would bring life
> to them again?"

> "Don't be vexing me," said the father.

> "It's neither vexing you I am nor trifling," said Kate. "I can put the
> life in them again."

> "If it was true that you could do that, I would give you all that I
> have inside the house and outside as well."

> "All I want from you," said Kate, "is the eldest son to marry and Gort
> na Leachtan \[the field of the stone heaps\] as fortune."

> "My dear, you will have that from me with the greatest blessing.

> "Give me the field in writing from yourself, whether the son will
> marry me or not."

> He gave her the field in his handwriting. She told all who were inside
> in the wake-house to go outside the door, every man and woman of them.
> Some were laughing at her and more were crying, thinking it was mad
> she was. She bolted the door inside, and went to the place where she
> left the handkerchief, found it, and put three bites of the oatmeal
> and the blood in the mouth of each young man, and as soon as she did
> that the three got their natural colour, and they looked like men
> sleeping. She opened the door, then called on all to come inside, and
> told the father to go and wake his sons.

> He called each one by name, and as they woke they seemed very tired
> after their night's rest; they put on their clothes, and were greatly
> surprised to see all the people around. "How is this?" asked the
> eldest brother.

> "Don't you know of anything that came over you in the night?" asked
> the father.

> "We do not," said the sons. "We remember nothing at all since we fell
> asleep last evening."

> The father then told them everything, but they could not believe it.
> Kate went away home and told her father and mother of her night's
> journey to and from the graveyard, and said that she would soon tell
> them more.

> That day she met John.

> "Did you bring the stick?" asked he.

> "Find your own stick," said she, "and never speak to me again in your
> life."

> In a week's time she went to the house of the three young men, and
> said to the father, "I have come for what you promised me."

> "You'll get that with my blessing," said the father. He called the
> eldest son aside then and asked would he marry Kate, their neighbour's
> daughter. "I will," said the son. Three days after that the two were
> married and had a fine wedding. For three weeks they enjoyed a
> pleasant life without toil or trouble; then Kate said, "This will not
> do for us; we must be working. Come with me to-morrow and I'll give
> yourself and brothers plenty to do, and my own father and brothers as
> well."

> She took them next day to one of the stone heaps in Gort na Leachtan.
> "Throw these stones to one side," said she.

> They thought that she was losing her senses, but she told them that
> they'd soon see for themselves what she was doing. They went to work
> and kept at it till they had six feet deep of a hole dug; then they
> met with a flat stone three feet square and an iron hook in the middle
> of it.

> "Sure there must be something underneath this," said the men. They
> lifted the flag, and under it was a pot of gold. All were very happy
> then. "There is more gold yet in the place," said Kate. "Come, now, to
> the other heap." They removed that heap, dug down, and found another
> pot of gold. They removed the third pile and found a third pot full of
> gold. On the side of the third pot was an inscription, and they could
> not make out what it was. After emptying it they placed the pot by the
> side of the door.

> About a month later a poor scholar walked the way, and as he was going
> in at the door he saw the old pot and the letters on the side of it.
> He began to study the letters.

> "You must be a good scholar if you can read what's on that pot," said
> the young man.

> "I can," said the poor scholar, "and here it is for you. 'There is a
> deal more at the south side of each pot."

> The young man said nothing, but putting his hand in his pocket, gave
> the poor scholar a good day's hire. When he was gone they went to work
> and found a deal more of gold at the south side of each stone heap.
> They were very happy then and very rich, and bought several farms and
> built fine houses, and it was supposed by all of them in the latter
> end that it was Derrihy's money that was buried under the Ieachtans,
> but they could give no correct account of that, and sure why need they
> care? When they died they left property to make their children rich to
> the seventh generation.
