The Fairies of Rahonain and Elizabeth Shea

> WHEN the company came to my room on the following evening the host
> brought a fourth man, Maurice Lynch, a mason, who knew a good deal
> about ghosts and fairies.

> When he bade me good-bye the night before, John Malone promised to
> open the present session with a tale which he knew to be true, for the
> chief actors in it were friends of his own, "and himself was in it
> also." The tale was called forth by a question concerning a practice
> among the fairies (quite common it seems) of carrying away living
> people and leaving substitutes in place of them. It seems that these
> substitutes are corpses when the persons borne away are marriageable
> young women. When a married woman is removed a deceased counterfeit is
> left to take her place. When an infant is stolen a living imitation of
> the child is put in the cradle. The substitute seems to the parents
> their own child, but to any one who has the fairy vision the fraud
> appears in its true form.

>  

>  

> About thirty years ago, said the old man, there lived in a village
> near Rahonain Castle a man named James Kivane, a step-brother of my
> own, and he married a woman called Elizabeth Shea. Three or four
> nights after her second child was born Kivane's wife, who was attended
> by her own mother and her mother-in-law, woke and saw the bed on fire.
> She called to the mother, who was there at the bedside, but had fallen
> asleep. The mother sprang up, and, turning towards the hearth, saw a
> cat with the face of a man on her, and was frightened, but she had no
> time to look longer at the cat. When she had the fire quenched she
> looked for the cat, but not a trace of her could they find in the
> house, and they never caught a sight of her again.

> Two days later the young child died, and three or four days after that
> the woman had a terrible pain in her foot. It swelled to a great size,
> and where the swelling was the skin looked like the bark of a tree.
> The poor woman suffered terribly. They sent for the priest many times,
> and spent money for masses. They offered one priest twenty pounds to
> cure her, but he said that if all the money in the kingdom were
> offered he would have nothing to do with the case. He was afraid of
> getting a fairy stroke himself.

> The foot was swelling always, and it was that size that a yard of
> linen was needed to go once around it. The woman was a year and a half
> in this way, and towards the end she said that horses and carriages
> were moving around the house every night, but she had no knowledge of
> why they were in it.

> The mother went to an old woman, an herb doctor, and begged her to
> come and cure her daughter if she could.

> "I can cure her," said the woman, "but if I do you must let some other
> one of your family go in place of her."

> Now, as all the sons and daughters were married and had families of
> their own, the mother said she had no one she could put in place of
> this daughter. Kivane's wife used to raise herself by a rope which was
> put hanging above the bed. When tired and she could hold no longer,
> she would lie down again. The woman remained in suffering like this
> till a week before she died. She told her friends that it was no use
> to give her remedies or pay money for masses to benefit her; that it
> wasn't herself that was in it at all.

> On the night that the mother saw the cat with a man's face and she
> sitting on the hearth, Kivane's real wife was taken by the fairies and
> put in Rahonain Castle to nurse a young child.

> Nobody could tell who the sick woman was, but whoever she was she
> died, and the body was so swollen and drawn up that the coffin was
> like a great box, as broad as 'twas long. About a year after the
> funeral Pat Mahony, who worked for a hotel-keeper in Dingle, went to a
> fair at Listowel. At the fair a strange man came up to Mahony. 'Where
> do you live?" asked the man.

> "In Dingle," said Pat Mahony.

> "Do you know families at Rahonain named Shea and Kivane?"

> "I do," said Mahony. "Kivane's wife died about a twelvemonth ago."

> "Well," said the strange man, "I have a message for you to the parents
> of that woman, Elizabeth Shea. She is coming to my house for the last
> nine months. She comes always after sunset. She lives in a fairy fort
> that is on my land. This is the way we discovered the woman: About
> nine months ago potatoes and milk were put out on the dresser for one
> of my servants who was away from home, and before the man came this
> woman was seen going to the dresser and eating the potatoes and
> drinking the milk. She came every evening after that for about a month
> before I had courage to speak to her. When I spoke she told me that
> her father, mother, husband, and child were living near Rahonain
> Castle, She gave every right token of who she was. 'I spent,' said
> she, 'three months in Rahonain, at first nursing a child that was in
> it, but was taken after that to the fort on the place where I am
> living now, in Lismore. I have not tasted food in the fort yet,' said
> she, 'but at the end of seven years I'll be forced to eat and drink
> unless somebody saves me; I cannot escape unassisted."

> When Mahony came home to Dingle he went straight to Rahonain and told
> the woman's friends all that the strange man had told him. She had
> told the man, too, how her friends must come with four men and a horse
> and car; that she would meet them.

> Mrs. Kivane's father and brother, and I and another neighbouring man,
> offered to go to Lismore, but Kivane wouldn't go, for he had a second
> wife at this time. The following morning we started, and went to the
> parish priest to take his advice. He told us not to go, and advised us
> in every way to stay at home. He was afraid, I suppose, that the woman
> might give the people too much knowledge of the other world. The other
> three men were stopped by the priest. Sure there was no use in my
> going alone, and I didn't.

> Kivane's wife knew that her husband was married the second time, for
> she sent word to him that she didn't care, she would live with her
> father and her child. Everybody forgot the affair for a couple of
> years. When a retired policeman named Bat O'Connor was going from
> Lismore to Dingle, the woman appeared before him, saluted him, and
> asked was he going to Dingle, and he said he was. She told him then if
> he wanted to do her any good or service to go to her friends at
> Rahonain (she gave their names) and tell them that they had plenty of
> time yet to go and claim her; that she had not eaten fairy food so
> far. He promised to do as she asked. He reached Dingle soon after,
> went to Rahonain and told her friends what she had said. O'Connor,
> however, didn't tell everything in full till they would promise to go.
> At this the relations of Kivane's second wife went to O'Connor and
> bribed him to say nothing more. After that he was silent, and people
> cared no more about the woman.

> The seven years passed, and at the end of that time Elizabeth Shea's
> father saw her one evening when he was coming home from market and was
> about a mile beyond Dingle. She walked nearly a mile with him, but
> didn't talk. At parting she gave him a blow on the face. On the
> following day he had to take to his bed, and was blind for seven or
> eight years. He kept the bed most of the time till he died. During the
> couple of days before he lost his sight Shea saw the daughter come in
> and give a blow to her child, which died strangely soon after. Neither
> priest nor doctor could tell what ailment was on the child.

> About the time the child died Shea's second wife got sick, and has not
> milked a cow nor swept the house since. She has not gone to mass or
> market these twenty years. She keeps the bed now, and will keep it
> while she lives. She has no pain and is not suffering in any way, but
> is dead in herself, as it were. She had a fine young girl of a
> daughter, but she got a blow and died two days after. She has three
> sons, but Elizabeth Shea has never done them any harm.
