James Murray and Saint Martin

(told by Timothy Sheahy)

>  

> THERE was a small farmer named James Murray, who lived between this
> and Slieve Mish. He had the grass of seven cows, but though he had the
> land, he hadn't stock to put on it; he had but the one cow. Being a
> poor man, he went to Cork with four firkins of butter for a neighbour.
> He never thought what day of the month it was until he had the butter
> sold in the city, and it was Saint Martin's eve at the time. Himself
> and his father before him and his grandfather had always killed
> something to honour Saint Martin, and when he was in Cork on Saint
> Martin's eve he felt heartsore and could not eat. He walked around and
> muttered to himself: "I wish to the Almighty God I was at home; my
> house will be disgraced for ever."

> The words weren't out of his mouth when a fine-looking gentleman stood
> before him and asked: 'What trouble is on you, good man?"

> James Murray told the gentleman.

> 'Well, my poor man, you would like to be at home to-night?"

> "Indeed, then, I would, and but for I forgot the day of the month, it
> isn't here I'd be now, poor as I am."

> "Where do you live?"

> "Near the foot of Slieve Mish, in Kerry."

> "Bring out your horse and creels, and you will be at home."

> "What is the use in talking? 'Tis too far for such a journey."

> "Never mind; bring out your horse."

> James Murray led out the horse, mounted, and rode away. He thought he
> wasn't two hours on the road when he was going in at his own door.
> Sure, his wife was astonished and didn't believe that he could be home
> from Cork in that time; it was only when he showed the money they paid
> him for the other man's butter that she believed.

> 'Well, this is Saint Martin's eve!"

> "It is," said she. 'What are we to do? I don't know, for we have
> nothing to kill."

> Out went James and drove in the cow.

> 'What are you going to do?" asked the wife.

> "To kill the cow in honour of Saint Martin."

> "Indeed, then, you will not."

> "I will, indeed," and he killed her. He skinned the cow and cooked
> some of her flesh, but the woman was down in the room at the other end
> of the house lamenting.

> "Come up now and eat your supper," said the husband.

> But she would not eat, and was only complaining and crying.

> After supper the whole family went to bed. Murray rose at daybreak
> next morning, went to the door, and saw seven grey cows, and they
> feeding in the field.

> 'Whose cows are those eating my grass?" cried he, and ran out to drive
> them away. Then he saw that they were not like other cattle in the
> district, and they were fat and bursting with milk.

> "I'll have the milk at least, to pay for the grass they've eaten,"
> said James Murray. So his wife milked the grey cows and he drove them
> back to the field. The cows were contented in themselves and didn't
> wish to go away. Next day he published the cows, but no one ever came
> to claim them.

> "It was the Almighty God and Saint Martin who sent these cows," said
> he, and he kept them. In the summer all the cows had heifer calves,
> and every year for seven years they had heifer calves, and the calves
> were all grey, like the cows. James Murray got very rich, and his
> crops were the best in the county. He bought new land and had a deal
> of money put away; but it happened on the eighth year one of the cows
> had a bull calf. What did Murray do but kill the calf. That minute the
> seven old cows began to bellow and run away, and the calves bellowed
> and followed them, all ran and never stopped till they went into the
> sea and disappeared under the waves. They were never seen after that,
> but, as Murray used to give away a heifer calf sometimes during the
> seven years, there are cows of that breed around Slieve Mish and
> Dingle to this day, and every one is as good as two cows.
