The Court of Crinnawn

 

> \[142\]

> A LONG time ago there came a lot of gentlemen to a river which is
> between the County Mee-òh (Mayo) and Roscommon, and they chose out a
> nice place for themselves on the brink of a river, and set up a court
> on it. Nobody at all in the little villages round about knew from what
> place these gentlemen came. MacDonnell was the name that was on them.
> The neighbours were for a long time without making friendship with
> them, until there came a great plague, and the people were getting
> death in their hundreds.

> One day there was the only son of a poor widow dying from the
> destructive plague, and she had not a drop of milk to wet his tongue.
> She went to the court, and they asked her what she was looking for.
> She told them that the one son she had was dying of the plague and
> that she had not a drop of milk to wet his tongue.

> "Hard is your case," says a lady that was in the court to her. "I will
> give you milk and healing, and your son will be as well at the end of
> an hour as ever he was." Then she gave her a tin can, and said: "Go
> home now, this can will never be empty as long as you or your son is
> alive, if you keep the secret without telling anybody that you got it
> here. When you will go home put a morsel of the Mary's shamrock
> (four-leaved shamrock?) in the milk and give it to your son."

> The widow went home. She put a bit of four-leaved shamrock in the
> milk, and gave it to her son to drink, and he rose up at the end of an
> hour as well as ever he was. Then the woman went through the villages
> round about with the can, and there was no one at all to whom she gave
> a drink that was not healed at the end of an hour.

> \[143\]

> It was not long till the fame of Maurya nee Keerachawn (Mary
> Kerrigan), that was the name of the widow, went through the country,
> and it was not long till she had the full of the bag of gold and
> silver.

> One day Mary went to a *pattern* at Cultya Bronks, drank too much,
> fell on drunkenness, and let out the secret.

> There came the heavy sleep of drunkenness on her, and when she awoke
> the can was gone. There was so much grief on her that she drowned
> herself in a place called Pull Bawn (the White Hole), within a mile of
> Cultya Bronks.

> Everybody thought now that they had the can of healing to get at the
> Court of Crinnawn if they would go there. In the morning, the day on
> the morrow, there went plenty of people to the court, and they found
> every one who was in it dead. The shout went out, and the hundreds of
> people gathered together, but no man could go in, for the court was
> filled with smoke; and lightning and thunder coming out of it.

> They sent a message for the priest, who was in Ballaghadereen, but he
> said: "It is not in my parish, and I won't have anything to do with
> it." That night the people saw a great light in the court, and there
> was very great fear on them. The day on the morrow they sent word to
> the priest of Lisahull, but he would not come, as the place was not in
> his parish. Word was sent to the priest of Kilmovee, then, but he had
> the same excuse.

> There were a lot of poor friars in Cultya Mawn, and when they heard
> the story they went to the court without a person with them but
> themselves.

> When they went in they began saying prayers, but they saw no corpse.
> After a time the smoke went, the

> \[144\]

> lightning and thunder ceased, a door opened, and there came out a
> great man. The friars noticed that he had only one eye, and that it
> was in his forehead.

> "In the name of God, who are you?" said a man of the friars.

> "I am Crinnawn, son of Belore, of the Evil Eye. Let there be no fear
> on ye, I shall do ye no damage, for ye are courageous, good men. The
> people who were here are gone to eternal rest, body and soul. I know
> that ye are poor, and that there are plenty of poor people round about
> ye. Here are two purses for ye, one of them for yourselves, and the
> other one to divide upon the poor; and when all that will be spent, do
> ye come again. Not of this world am I, but I shall do no damage to
> anyone unless he does it to me first, and do ye keep from me."

> Then he gave them two purses, and said: "Go now on your good work."
> The friars went home; they gathered the poor people and they divided
> the money on them. The people questioned them as to what it was they
> saw in the court. "It is a secret each thing we saw in the court, and
> it is our advice to ye not to go near the court, and no harm will come
> upon ye."

> The priests were covetous when they heard that the friars got plenty
> of money in the court, and the three of them went there with the hope
> that they would get some as the friars got it.

> When they went in they began crying aloud: "Is there any person here?
> is there any person here?" Crinnawn came out of a chamber and asked:
> "What are ye looking for?" "We came to make friendship with you," said
> the priests. "I thought that priests were not given to telling lies,"
> said Crinnawn; "ye came with a hope that ye would get money as the
> poor friars got. Ye

> \[145\]

> were afraid to come when the people sent for ye, and now ye will not
> get a keenogue (mite?) from me, for ye are not worth it."

> "Don't you know that we have power to banish you out of this place,"
> said the priests, "and we will make use of that power unless you will
> be more civil than you are."

> "I don't care for your power," said Crinnawn, "I have more power
> myself than all the priests that are in Ireland."

> "It's a lie you're speaking," said the priests.

> "Ye will see a small share of my power to-night," said Crinnawn; "I
> will not leave a wattle over your heads that I will not sweep into
> yonder river, and I could kill ye with the sight of my eye, if I
> chose. Ye will find the roofs of your houses in the river to-morrow
> morning. Now put no other questions on me, and threaten me no more, or
> it will be worse for ye."

> There came fear on the priests, and they went home; but they did not
> believe that their houses would be without a roof before morning.

> About midnight, that night, there came a blast of wind under the roof
> of the houses of the priests, and it swept them into the river
> forenent the court. There was not a bone of the priests but was shaken
> with terror, and they had to get shelter in the houses of the
> neighbours till morning.

> In the morning, the day on the morrow, the priests came to the river
> opposite the court, and they saw the roofs that were on all their
> houses swimming in the water. They sent for the friars, and asked them
> to go to Crinnawn and proclaim a peace, and say to him that they would
> put no more trouble on him. The friars went to the court, and Crinnawn
> welcomed them, and asked them

> \[146\]

> what they were seeking. "We come from the priests to proclaim a peace
> on you, they will trouble you no more." "That is well for them," said
> Crinnawn, "come with me now until ye see me putting back the roofs of
> the houses." They went with him as far as the river, and then he blew
> a blast out of each nostril. The roofs of the houses rose up as well
> as they were when they were first put on. There was wonder on the
> priests, and they said: "The power of enchantment is not yet dead, nor
> banished out of the country yet." From that day out neither priest nor
> anyone else would go near the Court of Crinnawn.

> A year after the death of Mary Kerrigan, there was a pattern in Cultya
> Bronks. There were plenty of young men gathered in it, and amongst
> them was Paudyeen, the son of Mary Kerrigan. They drank whiskey till
> they were in madness. When they were going home, Paudyeen O'Kerrigan
> said: "There is money in plenty in the court up there, and if ye have
> courage we can get it." As the drink was in them, twelve of them said:

> "We have courage, and we will go to the court." When they came to the
> door, Paudyeen O'Kerrigan said "Open the door, or we will break it."
> Crinnawn came out and said: "Unless ye go home I will put a month's
> sleep on ye." They thought to get a hold of Crinnawn, but he put a
> blast of wind out of his two nostrils that swept the young men to a
> *lis* (old circular rath) called Lisdrumneal, and put a heavy sleep on
> them, and a big cloud over them, and there is no name on the place
> from that out, but Lis-trum-nail (the fort of the heavy cloud).

> On the morning, the day on the morrow, the young men were not to be
> found either backwards or forwards, and there was great grief amongst
> the people. That day

> \[147\]

> went by without any account from the young men. People said that it
> was Crinnawn that killed them, for some saw them going to the court.
> The fathers and mothers of the young men went to the friars, and
> prayed them to go to Crinnawn and to find out from him where the young
> men were, dead or alive.

> They went to Crinnawn, and Crinnawn told them the trick the young men
> thought to do on him, and the thing he did with them. "If it be your
> will, bestow forgiveness on them this time," said the friars; "they
> were mad with whiskey, and they won't be guilty again." "On account of
> ye to ask it of me, I will loose them this time; but if they come
> again, I will put a sleep of seven years on them. Come with me now
> till you see them."

> "It's bad walkers, we are," said the friars, "we would be a long time
> going to the place where they are."

> "Ye won't be two minutes going to it," said Crinnawn, "and ye will be
> back at home in the same time."

> Then he brought them out, and put a blast of wind out of his mouth,
> and swept them to Lisdrumneal, and he himself was there as soon as
> they.

> They saw the twelve young men asleep under a cloud in the *lis,* and
> there was great wonder on them. "Now," said Crinnawn, "I will send
> them home." He blew upon them, and they rose up like birds in the air,
> and it was not long until each one of them was at home, and the friars
> as well, and you may be certain that they did not go to the Court of
> Crinnawn any more.

> Crinnawn was living in the court years after that. One day the friars
> went on a visit to him, but he was not to be found. People say that
> the friars got great riches after Crinnawn. At the end of a period of
> time the roof fell off the court, as everyone was afraid to go

> \[148\]

> and live in it. During many years after that, people would go round
> about a mile, before they would go near the old court. There is only a
> portion of the walls to be found now; but there is no name on the old
> court from that day till this day, but Coort a Chrinnawn (Crinnawn's
> Court).
