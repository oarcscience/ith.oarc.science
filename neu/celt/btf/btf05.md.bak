Bran

 

> \[15\]

> FINN had a splendid hound. That was Bran. You have heard talk of Bran.
> This is the colour was on him:

> Yellow feet that were on Bran,  
> Two black sides, and belly white,  
> Grayish back of hunting colour,  
> Two ears, red, round, small, and bright.

> Bran would overtake the wild-geese, she was that swift.

> \[16\]

> There arose some quarrel or fighting between the hounds that the
> Fenians had, when she was only a puppy, and

> Three score hounds and twenty puppies  
> Bran did kill, and she a puppy,  
> Two wild-geese, as much as they all.

> It was Finn himself who killed Bran. They went out hunting, and there
> was made a fawn of Finn's mother. (*Who made a fawn of her? Oh, how do
> l know? It was with some of their pishtrogues.)* Bran was pursuing
> her.

> "Silly fawn leave on mountain,"

> said Finn. "Oh, young son," said she, "how shall I escape?--

> "If I go in the sea beneath  
> I never shall come back again,  
> And if I go in the air above  
> My swiftness is no match for Bran."

> "Go out between my two legs," said Finn.

> She went between his two legs, and Bran followed her; and as Bran went
> out under him, Finn squeezed his two knees on her and killed her.

> Bran had a daughter. That pup was a black hound, and the Fenians
> reared it; and they told the woman who had a charge of the pup to give
> it the milk of a cow without a single spot, and to give it every
> single drop, and not to keep back one tint \* from her. The woman did
> not do that, but kept a portion of the milk without giving it to the
> pup.

> The first day that the Fenians loosed out the young hound, there was a
> glen full of wild-geese and other birds; and when the black hound was
> loosed amongst them, she caught them all except a very few that went
> out on a gap that was in it. (*And how could she catch the wild-geese?
> Wouldn't they fly away in the air? She caught them, then. That's how I
> heard it.)* And only that the woman kept back some of the milk from
> her, she would have killed them all.

> There was a man of the Fenians, a blind man, and when the pup was let
> out, he asked the people near him how did the young hound do. They
> told him that the young hound killed all the wild-geese and birds that
> were in the glen, but a few that went

> \[19\]

> out on a gap. "If she had to get all the milk that came from the cow
> without spot," says the blind man, "she wouldn't let a bird at all go
> from her." And he asked then "how was the hound coming home?" "She's
> coming now," said they, "and a fiery cloud out of her neck," (*How out
> of her neck? Because she was going so quick.*) "and she coming madly."

> "Grant me my request now," said the blind man. "Put me sitting in the
> chair, and put a coal \[Gual\] (?) in my hand; for unless I kill her
> she'll kill us."

> The hound came, and he threw the coal at her and killed her, and he
> blind.

> But if that pup had to get all the milk, she'd come and she'd lie down
> quietly, the same as Bran used to lie ever.

>  

>  

> \* Tint, means a drop, or small portion of liquid, amongst English
> speaking persons in Connacht and most other parts of Ireland.
