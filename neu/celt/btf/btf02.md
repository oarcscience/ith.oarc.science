Postscript  
by  
Alfred Nutt

>  

> I HAD hoped to accompany these tales with as full a commentary as that
> which I have affixed to the Argylishire *Märchen,* collected and
> translated by the Rev. D. Maclnnes. Considerations of business and
> health prevent me from carrying out this intention, and I have only
> been able to notice a passage here and there in the Tales; but I have
> gladly availed myself of my friend, Dr. Hyde's permission, to touch
> upon a few points in his Introduction

> Of special interest are Dr. Hyde's remarks upon the relations which
> obtain between the modern folk-tale current among the Gaelic-speaking
> populations of Ireland and Scotland, and the Irish mythic, heroic and
> romantic literature preserved in MSS., which range in date from the
> eleventh century to the present day.

> In Ireland, more than elsewhere, the line of demarcation between the
> tale whose genesis is conscious, and that of which the reverse is
> true, is hard to draw, and students will, for a long while to come,
> differ concerning points of detail. I may thus be permitted to
> disagree at times with Dr. Hyde, although, as a rule, I am heartily at
> one with him.

> Dr. Hyde distinguishes between an older stratum of folk-tale (the "old
> Aryan traditions,") and the newer stratum of "bardic inventions." He
> also establishes a yet younger class than these latter, the romances
> of the professional story-tellers of the eighteenth century, who
> "wrote them down as modern novelists do their stories." Of these last
> he remarks, that he has found no remnant of them among the peasantry
> of to-day; a valuable bit of evidence, although of course, subject to
> the inconclusiveness of all merely negative testimony. To revert to
> the second class, he looks upon the tales comprised in it as being
> rather the inventions of individual brains than as old Aryan
> folk-tales. It must at once be conceded, that a great number of the
> tales and ballads current in the Gaelic-speaking lands undoubtedly
> received the form under which they are now current, somewhere between
> the twelfth and the sixteenth centuries; that the authors of that form
> were equally undoubtedly the professional bards and story-tellers
> attached to the court of every Gaelic chieftain; and that the method
> of their transmission was oral, it being the custom of the
> story-tellers both to teach their tales to pupils, and to travel about
> from district to district.

> The style of these stories and ballads enables us to date them with
> sufficient precision. Dr. Hyde also notes historical allusions, such
> as the reference to O'Connor Sligo, in the story of the "Slim Swarthy
> Champion," or to the Turks in the story of "Conall Gulban." I cannot
> but think, however, that it is straining the evidence to assert that
> the one story was invented after 1362, or the other after the fall of
> Constantinople. The fact that "Bony" appears in some versions of the
> common English mumming play does not show that it originated in this
> century, merely that these particular versions have passed through the
> minds of nineteenth century peasants; and in like manner the Connaught
> fourteenth century chieftain may easily have taken the place of an
> earlier personage, the Turks in "Conall Gulban," of an earlier
> wizard-giant race. If I cannot go as far as Dr. Hyde in this sense, I
> must equally demur to the assumption, that community of incident
> between an Irish and a Bohemian tale necessarily establishes the
> pre-historic antiquity of the incident. I believe that a great many
> folk-tales, as well as much else of folk-lore, has been developed *in
> situ,* rather imported from the outside; but I, by no means, deny
> importation in principle, and I recognise that its agency has been
> clearly demonstrated in not a few cases.

> The main interest of Irish folk-literature (if the expression be
> allowed) centres in the bardic stories. I think that Dr. Hyde lays too
> much stress upon such external secondary matters as the names of
> heroes, or allusions to historical events; and, indeed, he himself, in
> the case of Murachaidh MacBrian, states what I believe to be the
> correct theory, namely, that the Irish bardic story, from which he
> derives the Scotch Gaelic one, is, as far as many of its incidents go,
> not the invention of the writer, but genuine folk-lore thrown by him
> into a new form.

> Had we all the materials necessary for forming a judgment, such is, I
> believe, the conclusion that would in every case be reached. But I
> furthermore hold it likely that in many cases the recast story
> gradually reverted to a primitive folk-type in the course of passing
> down from the court storyteller to the humbler peasant reciters, that
> it sloughed off the embellishments of the *ollamhs,* and reintroduced
> the older, wilder conceptions with which the folk remained in fuller
> sympathy than the more cultured bard. Compare, for instance, as I
> compared ten years ago, " Maghach Colgar," in Campbell's version (No.
> 36), with the "Fairy Palace of the Quicken Trees." The one tale has
> all the incidents in the wildest and most fantastic form possible; in
> the other they are rationalised to the utmost possible extent and made
> to appear like a piece of genuine history. I do not think that if this
> later version was *invented* right out by a thirteenth or fourteenth
> century *ollamh,* it could have given rise to the former one. Either
> "Maghach Colgar" descends from the folk-tale which served as the basis
> of the Irish story, or, what is more likely, the folk, whilst
> appreciating and preserving the new arrangement of certain well-known
> incidents, retained the earlier form of the incidents themselves, as
> being more consonant with the totality of its conceptions, both moral
> and aesthetic. This I hold to be the vital lesson the folklorist may
> learn from considering the relations of Gaelic folk-tale and Gaelic
> romance (using the latter term in the sense of story with a conscious
> genesis) that romance, to live and propagate itself among the folk,
> must follow certain rules, satisfy certain conceptions of life,
> conform to certain conventions. The Irish bards and story-tellers had
> little difficulty, I take it, in doing this; they had not outgrown the
> creed of their countrymen, they were in substantial touch with the
> intellectual and artistic laws that govern their subject-matter.
> Re-arrange, rationalise somewhat, deck out with the questionable
> adornment of their scanty and ill-digested book-learning--to this
> extent, but to this extent only, I believe, reached their influence
> upon the mass of folk-conceptions and presentments which they
> inherited from their fathers, and which, with these modifications and
> additions, they handed on to their children.

> But romance must not only conform to the conventions, it must also fit
> in with the *ensemble* of conditions, material, mental and spiritual,
> which constitute the culture (taking this much-abused word in its
> widest sense) of a race. An example will make this clear.

> Of all modern, consciously-invented fairy tales I know but one which
> conforms folly to the folk-tale convention--" The Shaving of Shagpat."
> It follows the formula as closely and accurately as the best of
> Grimm's or of Campbell's tales. To divine the nature of a convention,
> and to use its capabilities to the utmost, is a special mark of
> genius, and in this, as in other instances, whatever else be absent
> from Mr. Meredith's work, genius is indubitably present. But I do not
> think that "The Shaving of Shagpat" could ever be acclimatised as a
> folk-tale in this country. Scenery, conduct of story, characterisation
> of personages, are all too distinctively Oriental. But let an Eastern
> admirer of Mr. Meredith translate his work into Arabic or Hindi, and
> let the book fall into the hands of a Cairene or Delhi story-teller
> (if such still exist), I can well imagine that, with judicious cuts,
> it should win praise for its reciter in market-place or bazaar. Did
> this happen, it would surely be due- to the fact that the story is
> strictly constructed upon traditional lines, rather than to the
> brilliant invention and fancy displayed on every page. Strip from it
> the wit and philosophy of the author, and there remains a fairy tale
> to charm the East; but it would need to be reduced to a skeleton, and
> reclothed with new flesh before it could charm the folk of the West.

> To bring home yet more clearly to our minds this necessity for romance
> to conform to convention, let us ask ourselves, what would have
> happened if one of the Irish story-tellers who perambulated the
> Western Isles as late as the seventeenth century, had carried with him
> a volume of Hakluyt or Purchas, or, supposing one to have lingered
> enough, Defoe or Gil Blas? Would he have been welcomed when he
> substituted the new fare for the old tales of "Finn and the Fians?"
> and even if welcomed, would he have gained currency for it? Would the
> seed thus planted have thriven, or would it not rather, fallen upon
> rocky places, have withered away?

> It may, however, be objected that the real difference lies not so much
> in the subject-matter as in the mode of transmission; and the
> objection may seem to derive some force from what Dr. Hyde notes
> concerning the prevalence of folk-tales in Wicklow, and the nearer
> Pale generally, as contrasted with Leitrim, Longford, and Meath. It is
> difficult to over-estimate the interest and importance of this fact,
> and there can hardly be a doubt that Dr. Hyde has explained it
> correctly. It may, then, be urged that so long as oral transmission
> lasts the folk-tale flourishes; and only when the printed work ousts
> the story-teller is it that the folk-tale dies out. But this reasoning
> will not hold water. It is absurd to contend that the story-teller had
> none but a certain class of materials at his disposal till lately. He
> had the whole realm of intellect and fancy to draw upon; but he, and
> still more his hearers, knew only one district of that realm; and had
> it been possible for him to step outside its limits his hearers could
> not have followed him. I grant folk fancy has shared the fortunes of
> humanity together with every other manifestation of man's activity,
> but always within strictly defined limits, to transgress which has
> always been to forfeit the favour of the folk.

> What, then, are the characteristic marks of folk-fancy? The question
> is of special interest in connection with Gaelic folk-lore. The latter
> is rich in transitional forms, the study of which reveal more clearly
> than is otherwise possible the nature and workings of the folk-mind.

> The products of folk-fancy (putting aside such examples of folk-wisdom
> and folk-wit as proverbs, saws, jests, etc.), may be roughly divided
> among two great classes:

> Firstly, stories of a quasi-historical or anecdotic nature, accepted
> as actual fact (of course with varying degrees of credence) by
> narrator and hearer. Stories of this kind are very largely concerned
> with beings (supernatural, as we should call them) differing from man,
> and with their relations to and dealings with man. Not infrequently,
> however, the actors in the stories are wholly human, or human and
> animal. Gaelic folk-lore is rich in such stories, owing to the
> extraordinary tenacity of the fairy belief. We can hardly doubt that
> the Gael, like all other races which have passed through a certain
> stage of culture, had at one time an organised hierarchy of divine
> beings. But we have to piece together the Gaelic god-saga out of bare
> names, mere hints, and stories which have evidently suffered vital
> change. In the earliest stratum of Gaelic mythic narrative we find
> beings who at some former time had occupied divine rank, but whose
> relations to man are substantially, as therein presented, the same as
> those of the modern fairy to the modern peasant. The chiefs of the
> Tuatha de Danann hanker after earthly maidens; the divine damsels long
> for and summon to themselves earthly heroes. Though undying, very
> strong, and very wise, they may be overpowered or outwitted by the
> mortal hero. As if conscious of some source of weakness we cannot
> detect, they are anxious, in their internecine struggles, to secure
> the aid of the sons of men. Small wonder that this belief, which we
> can follow for at least 1,200 years, should furnish so many elements
> to the folk-fancy of the Gael.

> In stories of the second class the action is relegated to a remote
> past--once upon a time--or to a distant undefined region, and the
> narrative is not necessarily accepted as a record of actual fact.
> Stories of this class, whether in prose or verse, may again be
> subdivided into--humorous, optimistic, tragic; and with regard to the
> third sub-division, it should be noted that the stories comprised in
> it are generally told as having been true once, though not in the
> immediate tangible sense of stories in the first class.

> These different narrative groups share certain characteristics, though
> in varying proportions.

> Firstly, the fondness for and adherence to a comparatively small
> number of set formulas. This is obviously less marked in stories of
> the first class, which, as being in the mind of the folk a record of
> what has actually happened, partake of the diversity of actual life.
> And yet the most striking similarities occur; such an anecdote, for
> instance, as that which tells how a supernatural changeling is baffled
> by a brewery of egg-shells being found from Japan to Brittany.

> Secondly, on the moral side, the unquestioning acceptance of fatalism,
> though not in the sense which the Moslem or the Calvinist would attach
> to the word. The event is bound to be of a certain nature, provided a
> certain mode of attaining it be chosen. This comes out well in the
> large group of stories which tell how a supernatural being helps a
> mortal to perform certain tasks, as a rule, with some ulterior benefit
> to itself in view. The most disheartening carelessness and stupidity
> on the part of the man cannot alter the result; the skill and courage
> of the supernatural helper are powerless without the mortal
> co-operation. In what I have termed the tragic stories, this fatalism
> puts on a moral form, and gives rise to the conception of Nemesis.

> Thirdly, on the mental side, animism is prevalent, *i.e.,* the
> acceptance of a life common to, not alone man and animals, but all
> manifestations of force. In so far as a distinction is made between
> the life of man and that of nature at large, it is in favour of the
> latter, to which more potent energy is ascribed.

> Just as stories of the first class are less characterised by adherence
> to formula, so stories of the humorous group are less characterised by
> fatalism and animism. This is inevitable, as such stories are, as a
> rule, concerned solely with the relations of man to his fellows.

> The most fascinating and perplexing problems are those connected with
> the groups I have termed optimistic and tragic. To the former belong
> the almost entirety of such nursery tales as are not humorous in
> character. "They were married and lived happily ever afterwards;" such
> is the almost invariable end formula. The hero wins the princess, and
> the villain is punished.

> This feature the nursery tale shares with the god-saga; Zeus confounds
> the Titans, Apollo slays the Python, Lug overcomes Balor, Indra
> vanquishes Vritra. There are two apparent exceptions to this rule. The
> Teutonic god myth is tragic; the Anses are ever under the shadow of
> the final conflict. This has been explained by the influence of
> Christian ideas; but although this influence must be unreservedly
> admitted in certain details of the passing of the gods, yet the fact
> that the Iranian god-saga is likewise undecided, instead of having a
> frankly optimistic ending, makes me doubt whether the drawn battle
> between the powers of good and ill be not a genuine and necessary part
> of the Teutonic mythology. As is well known, Rydberg has established
> some striking points of contact between the mythic ideas of
> Scandinavia and those of Iran.

> In striking contradiction to this moral, optimistic tendency are the
> great heroic sagas. One and all well-nigh are profoundly tragic. The
> doom of Troy the great, the passing of Arthur, the slaughter of the
> Nibelungs, the death of Sohrab at his father's hands, Roncevalles,
> Gabhra, the fratricidal conflict of Cuchullain and Ferdiad, the woes
> of the house of Atreus; such are but a few examples of the prevailing
> tone of the hero-tales. Achilles and Siegfried and Cuchullain are
> slain in the flower of their youth and prowess. Of them, at least, the
> saying is true, that whom the gods love die young. Why is it not
> equally true of the prince hero of the fairy tale? Is it that the
> hero-tale associated in the minds of bearers and reciters with men who
> had actually lived and fought, brought down to earth, so to say, out
> of the mysterious wonderland in which god and fairy and old time kings
> have their being, becomes thereby liable to the necessities of death
> and decay inherent in all human things? Some scholars have a ready
> answer for this and similar questions. The heroic epos assumed its
> shape once for all among one special race, and was then passed on to
> the other races who remained faithful to the main lines whilst
> altering details. If this explanation were true, it would still leave
> unsolved the problem, why the heroic epos, which for its fashioners
> and hearers was at once a record of the actual and an exemplar of the
> ideal, should, among men differing in blood and culture, follow one
> model, and that a tragic one. Granting that Greek and Teuton and Celt
> did borrow the tales which they themselves conceived to be very blood
> and bone of their race, what force compelled them all to borrow one
> special conception of life and fate?

> Such exceptions as there are to the tragic nature of the heroic saga
> are apparent rather than real. The Odyssey ends happily, like an
> old-fashioned novel, but Fénélon long ago recognised in the
> Odyssey--"un amas de contes de vieille."

> Perseus again has the luck of a fairy-tale prince, but then the story
> of his fortunes is obviously a fairy-tale, with named instead of
> anonymous personages.

> Whilst the fairy-tale is akin in tone to the god saga, the ballad
> recalls the heroic epos. The vast majority of ballads are tragic. Sir
> Patrick Spens must drown, and Glasgerion's leman be cheated by the
> churl; Clerk Saunders comes from the other world, like Helge to
> Sigrun; Douglas dreams his dreary dream, "I saw a dead man win a
> fight, and that dead man was I." The themes of the ballad are the most
> dire and deadly of human passions; love scorned or betrayed, hate, and
> revenge. Very seldom, too, do the plots of ballad and märchen cross or
> overlap. Where this does happen it will, as a rule, be found that both
> are common descendants of some great saga.

> We find such an instance in the Fenian saga, episodes of which have
> lived on in the Gaelic folk memory in the double form of prose and
> poetry. But it should be noted that the poetry accentuates the tragic
> side--the battle of Gabhra, the death of Diarmaid--whilst the prose
> takes rather some episode of Finn's youth or manhood, and presents it
> as a rounded and complete whole, the issue of which is fortunate.

> The relations of myth and epos to folk-lore may thus be likened to
> that of trees to the soil from which they spring, and which they
> enrich and fertilize by the decay of their leaves and branches which
> mingle indistinguishably with the original soil. Of this soil, again,
> rude bricks may be made, and a house built; let the house fall into
> ruins, and the bricks crumble into dust, it will be hard to
> discriminate that dust from the parent earth. But raise a house of
> iron or stone, and, however ruined, its fragments can always be
> recognised.

> In the case of the Irish bardic literature the analogy is, I believe,
> with soil and tree, rather than with soil and edifice.

> Reverting once more to the characteristics of folk-fancy, let us note
> that they appear equally in folk-practice and folk-belief. The tough
> conservatism of the folk-mind has struck all observers: its adherence
> to immemorial formulas; its fatalistic acceptance of the mysteries of
> nature and heredity, coupled with its faith in the efficacy of
> sympathetic magic; its elaborate system of custom and ritual based
> upon the idea that between men and the remainder of the universe there
> is no difference of kind.

> A conception of the Cosmos is thus arrived at which, more than any
> religious creed, fulfils the test of catholicity; literally, and in
> the fullest significance of the words, it has been held *semper,
> ubique et ab omnibus.* And of this conception of the universe, more
> universal than any that has as yet swayed the minds of man, it is
> possible that men now living may see the last flickering remains; it
> is well-nigh certain that our grandchildren will live in a worldout of
> which it has utterly vanished.

> For the folk-lorist the Gospel saying is thus more pregnant with
> meaning than for any other student of man's history--" the night
> cometh wherein no man may work." Surely, many Irishmen will take to
> heart the example of Dr. Hyde, and will go forth to glean what may yet
> be found of as fair and bounteous a harvest of myth and romance as
> ever flourished among any race.
