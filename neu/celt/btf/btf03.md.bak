Dedication

>  

> To the memory of those truly cultured and unselfish men, the
> poet-scribes and hedge-schoolmasters of the last century and the
> beginning of this--men who may well be called the last of the
> Milesians--I dedicate this effort to preserve even a scrap of that
> native lore which in their day they loved so passionately, and for the
> preservation of which they worked so nobly, but in vain.
