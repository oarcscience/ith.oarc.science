Neil O'Carree

 

> \[148\]

> THERE was no nicety about him. He said to his wife that he would go to
> the forge to get a doctoring instrument. He went to the forge the next
> day. "Where are you going to today?" said the smith. "I am going till
> you make me an instrument for doctoring." "What is the instrument I
> shall make you?" "Make a *crumskeen* and a *galskeen" (crooked* knife
> and white knife?). The smith made that for him. He came home.

> When the day came--the day on the morrow--Neil O'Carree rose up. He
> made ready to be going as a doctor. He went. He was walking away. A
> red lad met him on the side of the high road. He saluted Neil
> O'Carree; Neil saluted him. "Where are you going? says the red man. "I
> am going till I be my *(i.e.,* a) doctor. "It's a good trade," says
> the red man, "'twere best for you to hire me." "What's the wages
> you'll be looking for?" says Neil. "Half of what we shall earn till we
> shall be back again on this ground." "I'll give you that," says Neil.
> The couple walked on.

> "There's a king's daughter," says the red man, "with the *(i.e.,* near
> to) death; we will go as far as her, till we see will we heal her."
> They went as far as the gate. The porter came to them. He asked them
> where were they going. They said that it was coming to look at the

> \[149\]

> king's daughter they were, to see would they do her good. The king
> desired to let them in. They went in.

> They went to the place where the girl was lying. The red man went and
> took hold of her pulse. He said that if his master should get the
> price of his labour he would heal her. The king said that he would
> give his master whatever he should award himself. He said, "if he had
> the room to himself and his master, that it would be better." The king
> said he should have it.

> He desired to bring down to him a skillet (little pot) of water. He
> put the skillet on the fire. He asked Neil O'Carree "Where is the
> doctoring instrument?" "Here they are," says Neil, "a crumskeen and a
> galskeen."

> He put the crumskeen on the neck of the girl. He took the head off
> her. He drew a green herb out of his pocket. He rubbed it to the neck.
> There did not come one drop of blood. He threw the head into the
> skillet He knocked a boil out of it. He seized hold on the two ears.
> He took it out of the skillet. He struck it down on the neck. The head
> stuck as well as ever it was. "How do you feel yourself now?" "I am as
> well as ever I was," said the king's daughter.

> The big man shouted. The king came down. There was great joy on him.
> He would not let them go away for three days. When they were going he
> brought down a bag of money. He poured it out on the table. He asked
> of Neil O'Carree had he enough there. Neil said he had, and more than
> enough, that they would take but the half. The king desired them not
> to spare the money.

> "There's the daughter of another king waiting for us to go and look at
> her." They bade farewell to the king and they went there.

> They went looking at her. They went to the place where she was lying,
> looking at her in her bed, and it was

> \[150\]

> the same way this one was healed. The king was grateful, and he said
> he did not mind how much money Neil should take of him. He gave him
> three hundred pounds of money. They went then, drawing on home.
> "There's a king's son in such and such a place," said the red man,
> "but we won't go to him, we will go home with what we have."

> They were drawing on home. The king (had) bestowed half a score of
> heifers on them, to bring home with them. They were walking away. When
> they were in the place where Neil O'Carree hired the red man, "I
> think," says the red man, "that this is the place I met you the first
> time." "I think it is," says Neil O'Carree. " Musha, how shall we
> divide the money?" "Two halves," says the red man, "that's the bargain
> was in it." " I think it a great deal to give you a half," says Neil
> O'Carree, "a third is big enough for you; I have a crumskeen and a
> galskeen (says Neil) and you have nothing." "I won't take anything,"
> said the red man, "unless I get the half." They fell out about the
> money. The red man went and he left him.

> Neil O'Carree was drawing home, riding on his beast. He was driving
> his share of cattle. The day came hot. The cattle went capering
> backwards and forwards. Neil O'Carree was controlling them. When he
> would have one or two caught the rest would be off when he used to
> come back. He tied his garrawn (gelding) to a bit of a tree. He was
> a-catching the cattle. At the last they were all off and away. He did
> not know where they went. He returned back to the place where he left
> his garrawn and his money. Neither the garrawn nor the money were to
> be got. He did not know then what he should do. He thought he would go
> to the house of the king whose son was ill.

> \[151\]

> He went along, drawing towards the house of the king. He went looking
> on the lad in the place where he was lying. He took a hold of his
> pulse. He said he thought he would heal him. "If you heal him," said
> the king, "I will give you three hundred pounds." "If I were to get
> the room to myself, for a little," says he. The king said that he
> should get that. He called down for a skillet of water. He put the
> skillet on the fire. He drew his crumskeen. He went to take the head
> off him as he saw the red man a-doing. He was a-sawing at the head,
> and it did not come with him to cut it off the neck. The blood was
> coming. He took the head off him at last. He threw it into the
> skillet. He knocked a boil out of it. When he considered the head to
> be boiled enough he made an attempt on the skillet. He got a hold of
> the two ears. The head fell in *gliggar* (a gurgling mass?), and the
> two ears came with him. The blood was coming greatly. It was going
> down, and out of the door of the room. When the king saw it going down
> he knew that his son was dead. He desired to open the door. Neil
> O'Carree would not open the door. They broke the door. The man was
> dead. The floor was full of blood. They seized Neil O'Carree. He was
> to hang the next day. They gathered a guard till they should carry him
> to the place where he was to hang. They went the next day with him.
> They were walking away, drawing towards the tree where he should be
> hanged. They stopped his screaming. They see a man stripped making a
> running race. When they saw him there was a fog of water round him
> with all he was running. When he came as far as them (he cried), "what
> are ye doing to my master?" "If this man is your master, deny him, or
> you'll get the same treatment." "It's I that it's right should suffer;
> it's I who made the

> \[152\]

> delay. He sent me for medicine, and I did not come in time, loose my
> master, perhaps he would heal the king's son yet."

> They loosed him. They came to the king's house. The red man went to
> the place where the dead man was. He began gathering the bones that
> were in the skillet. He gathered them all but only the two ears.

> "What did you do with the ears?"

> "I don't know," said Neil O'Carree, "I was so much frightened."

> The red man got the ears. He put them all together. He drew a green
> herb out of his pocket. He rubbed it round on the head. The skin grew
> on it, and the hair, as well as ever it was. He put the head in the
> skillet then. He knocked a boil out of it. He put the head back on the
> neck as well as ever it was. The king's son rose up in the bed.

> "How are you now?" says the red man.

> "I am well," says the king's son, "but that I'm weak."

> The red man shouted again for the king. There was great joy on the
> king when he saw his son alive. They spent that night pleasantly.

> The next day when they were going away, the king counted out three
> hundred pounds. He gave it to Neil O'Carree. He said to Neil that if
> he had not enough he would give him more. Neil O'Carree said he had
> enough, and that he would not take a penny more. He bade farewell and
> left his blessing, and struck out, drawing towards home.

> When they saw that they were come to the place where they fell out
> with one another, "I think," says the red man, "that this is the place
> where we differed before." "It is, exactly," said Neil O'Carree. They
> sat down and they divided the money. He gave a half to the red man,

> \[153\]

> and he kept another half himself. The red man bade him farewell, and
> he went. He was walking away for a while. He returned back. "I am here
> back again," said the red man, "I took another thought, to leave all
> your share of money with yourself. You yourself were open-handed. Do
> you mind the day you were going by past the churchyard. There were
> four inside in the churchyard, and a body with them in a coffin. There
> were a pair of them seeking to bury the body. There were debts on the
> body *(i.e.,* it owed debts). The two men who had the debts on it
> *(i.e.,* to whom it owed the debts), they were not satisfied for the
> body to be buried. They were arguing. You were listening to them. You
> went in. You asked how much they had on the body *(i.e.,* how were
> they owed by the body). The two men said that they had a pound on the
> body, and that they were not willing the body to be buried, until the
> people who were carrying it would promise to pay a portion of the
> debts. You said, 'I have ten shillings, and I'll give it to ye, and
> let the body be buried.' You gave the ten shillings, and the corpse
> was buried. It's I who was in the coffin that day. When I saw you
> going a-doctoring, I knew that you would not do the business. When I
> saw you in a hobble, I came to you to save you. I bestow the money on
> you all entirely. You shall not see me until the last day, go home
> now. Don't do a single day's doctoring as long as you'll be alive.
> It's short you'll walk until you get your share of cattle and your
> garrawn."

> Neil went, drawing towards home. Not far did he walk till his share of
> cattle and his nag met him. He went home and the whole with him. There
> is not a single day since that himself and his wife are not thriving
> on it.

> I got the ford, they the stepping stones. They were drowned, and I
> came safe.
