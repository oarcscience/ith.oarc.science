Preface

>  

> IRISH and Scotch Gaelic folk-stories are, as a living form of
> literature, by this time pretty nearly a thing of the past. They have
> been trampled in the common ruin under the feet of the Zeitgeist,
> happily not before a large harvest has been reaped in Scotland, but,
> unfortunately, before anything worth mentioning has been done in
> Ireland to gather in the crop which grew luxuriantly a few years ago.
> Until quite recently there existed in our midst millions of men and
> women who, when their day's work was over, sought and found mental
> recreation in a domain to which few indeed of us who read books are
> permitted to enter. Man, all the world over, when he is tired of the
> actualities of life, seeks to unbend his mind with the creations of
> fancy. We who can read betake ourselves to our favourite novelist, and
> as we peruse his fictions, we can almost see our author erasing this,
> heightening that, and laying on such-and-such a touch for effect. His
> book is the product of his individual brain, and some of us or of our
> contemporaries have been present at its genesis.

> But no one can tell us with certainty of the genesis of the folk-tale,
> no one has been consciously present at its inception, and no one has
> marked its growth. It is in many ways a mystery, part of the flotsam
> and jetsam of the ages, still beating feebly against the shore of the
> nineteenth century, swallowed up at last in England by the waves of
> materialism and civilization combined; but still surviving unengulfed
> on the western coasts of Ireland, where I gathered together some
> bundles of it, of which the present volume is one.

> The folk-lore of Ireland, like its folk-songs and native literature,
> remains practically unexploIted and ungathered. Attempts have been
> made from time to time during the present century to collect Irish
> folk-lore, but these attempts, though interesting from a literary
> point of view, are not always successes from a scientific one. Crofton
> Croker's delightful book, "Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South
> of Ireland," first published anonymously in 1825, led the way. All the
> other books which have been published on the subject have but followed
> in the footsteps of his; but all have not had the merit of his light
> style, his pleasant parallels from classic and foreign literature, and
> his delightful annotations, which touch, after a fascinating manner
> peculiarly his own, upon all that is of interest in his text. I have
> written the word "text," but that word conveys the idea of an original
> to be annotated upon; and Crofton Croker is, alas! too often his own
> original. There lies his weak point, and there, too, is the defect of
> all who have followed him. The form in which the stories are told is,
> of course, Croker's own; but no one who knows anything of fairy lore
> will suppose that his manipulation of the originals is confined to the
> form merely. The fact is that he learned the ground-work of his tales
> from conversations with the Southern peasantry, whom he knew well, and
> then elaborated this over the midnight oil with great skill and
> delicacy of touch, in order to give a saleable book, thus spiced, to
> the English public.

> Setting aside the novelists Carleton and Lover, who only published
> some incidental and largely-manipulated Irish stories, the next person
> to collect Irish folk-lore in a volume was Patrick Kennedy, a native
> of the County Wexford, who published "Legendary Fictions of the Irish
> Celts," and in 1870 a good book, entitled, "The Fireside Stories of
> Ireland," which he had himself heard in Wexford when a boy. Many of
> the stories which he gives appear to be the detritus of genuine Gaelic
> folkstories, filtered through an English idiom and much impaired and
> stunted in the process. He appears, however, not to have adulterated
> them very much. Two of the best stories in the book, "Jack, the
> Cunning Thief" and "Shawn an Omadawn," I heard myself in the adjoining
> county Wicklow, and the versions of them that I heard did not differ
> very widely from Kennedy's. It is interesting to note that these
> counties, close to the Pale as they are, and under English influence
> for so long, nevertheless seem to have preserved a considerable share
> of the old Gaelic folk-tales in English dress, while in Leitrim,
> Longford, Meath, and those counties where Irish died out only a
> generation or two ago, there has been made as clean a sweep of
> folk-lore and Gaelic traditions as the most uncompromising "West
> Briton" could desire. The reason why some of the folk-stories survive
> in the eastern counties is probably because the Irish language was
> there exchanged for English at a time when, for want of education and
> printed books, folk-stories (the only mental recreation of the people)
> *had* to transfer themselves rightly or wrongly into English. When
> this first took place I cannot tell, but I have heard from old people
> in Waterford, that when some of their fathers or grandfathers marched
> north to join the Wexford Irish in '98, they were astonished to find
> English nearly universally used amongst them. Kennedy says of his
> stories: "I have endeavoured to present them in a form suitable for
> the perusal of both sexes and of all ages"; and "such as they are,
> they may be received by our readers as obtained from local sources."
> Unfortunately, the sources are not given by him any more than by
> Croker, and we cannot be sure how much belongs to Kennedy the
> bookseller, and how much to the Wexford peasant.

> After this come Lady Wilde's volumes--her "Ancient Legends," and her
> recently published "Ancient Cures, Charms, and Usages," in both of
> which books she gives us a large amount of narrative matter in a
> folk-lore dress; but, like her predecessors, she disdains to quote an
> authority, and scorns to give us the least inkling as to where
> such-and-such a legend, or cure, or superstition comes from, from whom
> it was obtained, who were her informants, whether peasant or other, in
> what parishes or counties the superstition or legend obtains, and all
> the other collateral information which the modern folk-lorist is sure
> to expect. Her entire ignorance of Irish, through the medium of which
> alone such tales and superstitions can properly, if at all, be
> collected, is apparent every time she introduces an Irish word. She
> astonishes us Irish speakers with such striking observations as
> this--"Peasants in Ireland wishing you good luck, say in Irish, 'The
> blessing of Bel and the blessing of Samhain be with you,' that is, of
> the sun and of the moon."\* It

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \* Had Lady Wilde known Irish she might have quoted from a popular
> ballad composed on Patrick Sarsfield, and not yet forgotten:--

> Patrick Sarsfield, a man with God you are,  
> Blessed the country that you walk upon,  
> Blessing of sun and shining moon on you,  
> Since from William you took the day with you.

> Och, och hone.

> This would have made her point just as well. Unfortunately, Lady Wilde
> is always equally extraordinary or unhappy in her informants where
> Irish is concerned. Thus, she informs us that *bo-banna* (meant for
> *bo-bainne,* a much cow) is a "white cow"; that tobar-na-bo (the cow's
> well) is "the well of the white cow"; that Banshee comes from *van*
> "the woman"--*(bean* means "a woman"); that Leith Brogan--*i.e.,*
> leprechaun--is "the artificer of the brogue," while it really means
> the half or one-shoe, or, according to Stokes, is merely a corruption
> of locharpan; that tobar-na-dara (probably the "oak-well ") is the
> "well of tears," etc. Unfortunately, in Ireland it is no disgrace, but
> really seems rather a recommendation, to be ignorant of Irish, even
> when writing on Ireland.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> would be interesting to know the locality where so curious a Pagan
> custom is still practised, for I confess that though I have spoken
> Irish in every county where it is still spoken, I have never been, nor
> do I expect to be, so saluted. Lady Wilde's volumes, are,
> nevertheless, a wonderful and copious record of folk-lore and folk
> customs, which must lay Irishmen under one more debt of gratitude to
> the gifted compiler. It is unfortunate, however, that these volumes
> are hardly as valuable as they are interesting, and for the usual
> reason--that we do not know what is Lady Wilde's and what is not.

> Almost contemporaneously with Lady Wilde's last book there appeared
> this year yet another important work, a collection of Irish folk-tales
> taken from the Gaelic speakers of the south and north-west, by an
> American gentleman, Mr. Jeremiah Curtin. He has collected some twenty
> tales, which are told very well, and with much less cooking and
> flavouring than his predecessors employed. Mr. Curtin tells us that he
> has taken his tales from the old Gaelic-speaking men; but he must have
> done so through the awkward medium of an interpreter, for his
> ignorance of the commonest Irish words is as startling as Lady
> Wilde's.\* He follows Lady Wilde in this, too, that he keeps us in
> profound ignorance of his authorities. He mentions not one name, and
> except that he speaks in a general way of old Gaelic speakers in nooks
> where the language is still spoken, he leaves us in complete darkness
> as to where and from whom, and how he collected these stories. In this
> he does not do himself justice, for, from my own knowledge of Irish
> folk-lore, such as it is, I can easily recognize that Mr. Curtin has
> approached the fountainhead more nearly than any other. Unfortunately,
> like his predecessors, he has a literary style of his own, for

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \* Thus he over and over again speaks of a slumber-pin as *bar an
> suan,* evidently mistaking the *an* of *bioran,* "a pin," for *an* the
> definite article. So he has *slat an draoigheachta* for *slaitin,* or
> *statan draoigheachta.* He says *innis caol* (narrow island) means
> "light island," and that *gil* *an og* means "water of youth!" &c.;
> but, strangest of all, he talks in one of his stories of killing and
> boiling a stork, though his social researches on Irish soil might have
> taught him that that bird was not a Hibernian fowl. He evidently
> mistakes the very common word *sturc,* a bullock, or large animal, or,
> possibly, *torc,* "a wild boar," for the bird stork. His interpreter
> probably led him astray in the best good faith, for *sturck* is just
> as common a word with English-speaking people as with Gaelic speakers,
> though it is not to be found in our wretched dictionaries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> 'which, to say the least of it, there is no counterpart in the Gaelic
> from which he has translated.\*

> We have as yet had no folk-lorist in Ireland who could compare for a
> moment with such a man as lain Campbell, of Islay, in investigative
> powers, thoroughness of treatment, and acquaintance with the people,
> combined with a powerful national sentiment, and, above all, a
> knowledge of Gaelic. It is on this last rock that all our workers-up

> Irish word to express one's meaning, as one sometimes does of a French
> or German word, one would be looked upon as positively outside the
> pale of decency; hence we need not be surprised at the ignorance of
> Gaelic Ireland displayed by littérateurs who write for the English
> public, and foist upon us modes of speech which we have not got, and
> idioms which they never learned from us.

> This being the case, the chief interest in too many of our folk-tale

> It is difficult to say whether there still exist in Ireland many

> the present day to care little for anything that is Gaelic; and so
> their folk-lore has remained practically uncollected.

> Anyone who reads this volume as a representative one of Irish
> folk-tales might, at first sight, imagine that there is a broad
> difference between the Gaelic tales of the Highlands and those of
> Ireland, because very few of the stories given here have parallels in
> the volumes of Campbell and Maclnnes. I have, however, particularly
> chosen the tales in the present volume on account of their
> dissimilarity to any published Highland tales, for, as a general rule,
> the main body of tales in Ireland and Scotland bear a very near
> relation to each other. Most of Mr. Curtin's stories, for instance,
> have Scotch Gaelic parallels. It would be only natural, however, that

> conscious--must have arisen amongst the Irish since then, while on the
> other hand some of the Scotch stories may have been bequeathed to the
> Gaelic language by those races who were displaced by the Milesian
> Conquest in the fifth century.

> Many of the incidents of the Highland stories have parallels in Irish
> MSS., even incidents of which I have met no trace in the folk-lore of

> The extraordinary creature of which Campbell found traces in the

> paralleled from Scotch Gaelic sources, and one of the most remarkable,
> that of the prince becoming a journeyman fuller, I have found in a

> Besides this story it contains a number of others, such as "The

> warriors embark in their vessel:-

> "They gave her prow to sea and her stern to shore,  
> They hoisted the speckled flapping bare-topped sails,  
> Up against the tall tough splintering masts,  
> And they had a pleasant breeze as they might chose themselves,  
> 'Would bring heather from the hill, leaf from grove, willow from its
> roots,  
> Would put thatch of the houses in furrows of the ridges,  
> The day that neither the son nor the father could do it,  
> That same was neither little nor much for them,  
> But using it and taking it as it might come.  
> The sea plunging and surging,  
> The red sea the blue sea lashing,  
> And striking hither and thither about her planks,  
> The whorled dun whelk that was down on the floor of the ocean,  
> Would give a *snag* on her gunwale and a crack on her floor,  
> She would cut a slender oaten straw with the excellence of her going.

> It will be observed how different the corresponding run in the Irish
> manuscript is, when thrown into verse, for the language in both
> versions is only measured prose:--

> "Then they gave an eager very quick courageous high-spirited
> flood-leap  
> To meet and to face the sea and the great ocean.  
> And great was the horror \* \* \* \* \*  
> Then there arose before them a fierceness in the sea,  
> And they replied patiently stoutly strongly and vigorously,  
> To the roar of the green sided high-strong waves,  
> Till they made a high quick very-furious rowing  
> Till the deep-margined dreadful blue-bordered sea  
> Arose in broad-sloping fierce-frothing plains  
> And in rushing murmuring flood-quick ever-deep platforms.  
> And in gloomy horrible swift great valleys  
> Of very terrible green sea, and the beating and the pounding  
> Of the strong dangerous waves smiting against the decks  
> And against the sides of that full-great full-tight bark."

> bards, contented themselves with remembering the incidents of a story,
> but either extemporised their own runs after what flourish their

> always ready at hand. Let us look, then, at another story of which
> Campbell has preserved the Highland version, while I have a good Irish
> MS. of the same, written by some northern scribe, in 1762. This story,
> "The Slender Grey Kerne," or "Slim Swarthy Champion," as Campbell
> translates it, is full of alliterative runs, which the Highland
> reciter has retained in their proper places, but couched in different
> language, while he introduces a run of his own which the Irish has not
> got, in describing the swift movement of the kerne. Every time the
> kerne is asked where he comes from, the Highlander makes him say--

> "I came from hurry-skurry,  
> From the land of endless spring,\*  
> From the loved swanny glen,  
> A night in Islay and a night in Man,  
> A night on cold watching cairns  
> On the face of a mountain.  
> In the Scotch king's town was I born,  
> A soiled sorry champion am I  
> Though I happened upon this town."

> In the Irish MS. the kerne always says--

> "In Dun Monaidh, in the town of the king of Scotland,  
> I slept last night,  
> But I be a day in Islay and a day in Cantire,  
> A day in Man and a day in Rathlin,  
> A day in Fionncharn of the watch  
> Upon Slieve Fuaid.  
> A little miserable traveller I,  
> And in Aileach of the kings was I born.  
> And that," said he, ''is my story."

> Again, whenever the kerne plays his harp the Highlander says

> "He could play tunes and *oirts* and *orgain,  
> *Trampling things, tightening strings,  
> Warriors, heroes, and ghosts on their feet,  
> Ghosts and souls and sickness and fever,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> \* Campbell has mistranslated this. I think it means "from the bottom
> of the well ot the deluge."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> That would set in sound lasting sleep  
> The whole great world,  
> With the sweetness of the calming\* tunes  
> That the champion would play."

> The Irish run is as follows:--

> "The kerne played music and tunes and instruments of song,  
> Wounded men and women with babes,  
> And slashed heroes and mangled warriors,  
> And all the wounded and all the sick,  
> And the bitterly-wounded of the great world,  
> They would sleep with the voice of the music,  
> Ever efficacious, ever sweet, which the kerne played."

> Again, when the kerne approaches anyone, his gait is thus described
> half-rythmically by the Scotch narrator:--"A young chap was seen
> coming towards them, his two shoulders through his old coat, his two
> ears through his old hat, his two squat kickering tatter-y shoes full
> of cold roadway-ish water, three feet of his sword sideways in the
> side of his haunch after the scabbard was ended."

> The Irish writer makes him come thus:--"And he beheld the slender grey
> kerne approaching him straight, and half his sword bared behind his
> haunch, and old shoes full of water sousing about him, and the top of
