Leam O'Rooney's Burial

 

> \[91\]

> IN the olden time there was once a man named William O'Rooney, living
> near Clare-Galway. He was a farmer. One day the landlord came to him
> and said: "I have three years' rent on you, and unless you have it for
> me within a week I'll throw you out on the side of the road."

> "I'm going to Galway with a load of wheat to-morrow," said Leeam
> (William), "and when I get the price of it I'll pay you."

> Next morning he put a load of wheat on the cart, and was going to
> Galway with it. When he was gone a

> \[93\]

> couple of miles from the house a gentleman met him and asked him: "Is
> it wheat you've got on the cart?"

> "It is," says Leeam; "I'm going to sell it to pay my rent."

> How much is there in it?" said the gentleman.

> "There's a ton, honest, in it," said Leeam.

> "I'll buy it from you," said the gentleman, "and I'll give you the
> biggest price that's going in the market. When you'll go as far as the
> cart *boreen* (little road) that's on your left hand, turn down, and
> be going till you come to a big house in the valley. I'll be before
> you there to give you your money."

> When Leeam came to the *boreen* he turned in, and was going until he
> came as far as the big house. Leeam wondered when he came as far as
> the big house, for he was born and raised *(i.e.,* reared) in the
> neighbourhood, and yet he had never seen the big house before, though
> he thought he knew every house within five miles of him.

> When Leeam came near the barn that was close to the big house, a
> little lad came out and said: "A hundred thousand welcomes to you,
> William O'Rooney," put a sack on his back and went in with it. Another
> little lad came out and welcomed Leeam, put a sack on his back, and
> went in with it. Lads were coming welcoming Leeam, and putting the
> sacks on their backs and carrying them in, until the ton of wheat was
> all gone. Then the whole of the lads came round him, and Leeam said;
> "Ye all know me, and I don't know ye!" Then they said to him: "Go in
> and eat your dinner; the master's waiting for you."

> Leeam went in and sat down at table; but he had not the second
> mouthful taken till a heavy sleep came on him, and he fell down under
> the table. Then the enchanter

> \[95\]

> made a false man like William, and sent him home to William's wife
> with the horse and cart. When the false man came to Leeam's house, he
> went into the room, lay down on the bed and died.

> It was not long till the cry went out that Leeam O'Rooney was dead.
> The wife put down water, and when it was hot she washed the body and
> put it over the board *(i.e.,* laid it out). The neighbours came, and
> they keened sorrowfully over the body, and there was great pity for
> the poor wife, but there was not much grief on herself, for Leeam was
> old and she was young. The day on the morrow the body was buried, and
> there was no more remembrance of Leeam.

> Leeam's wife had a servant boy, and she said to him:

> "You ought to marry me, and to take Leeam's place."

> "It's too early yet, after there being a death in the house," said the
> boy; " wait till Leeam is a week buried."

> When Leeam was seven days and seven nights asleep, a little boy came
> to him and awoke him, and said: "You've been asleep for a week; but we
> sent your horse and cart home. Here's your money, and go."

> Leeam came home, and as it was late at night nobody saw him. On the
> morning of that same day Leeam's wife and the servant lad went to the
> priest and asked him to marry them.

> "Have you the marriage money?" said the priest.

> "No," said the wife; "but I have a *sturk* of a pig at home, and you
> can have her in place of money."

> The priest married them, and said: "I'll send for the pig to-morrow."

> When Leeam came to his own door, he struck a blow on it. The wife and
> the servant boy were going to bed, and they asked: "Who's there?"

> \[97\]

> "It's I," said Leeam; "open the door for me."

> When they heard the voice, they knew that it was Leeam who was in it,
> and the wife said: "I can't let you in, and it's a great shame, you to
> be coming back again, after being seven days in your grave."

> "Is it mad you are?" said Leeam.

> "I'm not mad," said the wife; "doesn't every person in the parish know
> that you are dead, and that I buried you decently. Go back to your
> grave, and I'll have a mass read for your poor soul to-morrow."

> "Wait till daylight comes," said Leeam, "and I'll give you the price
> of your joking!"

> Then he went into the stable, where his horse and the pig were,
> stretched himself in the straw, and fell asleep.

> Early on the morning of the next day, the priest said to a little lad
> that he had: "Get up, and go to Leeam O'Rooney's house, and the woman
> that I married yesterday will give you a pig to bring home with you."

> The boy came to the door of the house, and began knocking at it with a
> stick. The wife was afraid to open the door, but she asked: "Who's
> there?"

> "I," said the boy; "the priest sent me to get a pig from you."

> "She's out in the stable," said the wife; "you can get her for
> yourself and drive her back with you."

> The lad went into the stable, and began driving out the pig, when
> Leeam rose up and said: "Where are you going with my pig?"

> When the boy saw Leeam he never stopped to look again, but out with
> him as hard as he could, and he never stopped till he came back to the
> priest, and his heart coming out of his mouth with terror.

> "What's on you?" says the priest.

> \[99\]

> The lad told him that Leeam O'Rooney was in the stable, and would not
> let him drive out the pig.

> "Hold your tongue, you liar!" said the priest; "Leeam O'Rooney's dead
> and in the grave this week."

> "If he was in the grave this seven years, I saw him in the stable two
> moments ago; and if you don't believe me, come yourself, and you'll
> see him."

> The priest and the boy then went together to the door of the stable,
> and the priest said: "Go in and turn me out that pig."

> "I wouldn't go in for all ever you're worth," said the boy.

> The priest went in, and began driving out the pig, when Leeam rose up
> out of the straw and said: "Where are you going with my pig, Father
> Patrick?"

> When the priest saw Leeam, off and away with him, and he crying out:
> "In the name of God, I order you back to your grave, William
> O'Rooney."

> Leeam began running after the priest, and saying, "Father Patrick,
> Father Patrick, are you mad? Wait and speak to me."

> The priest would not wait for him, but made off home as fast as his
> feet could carry him, and when he got into the house, he shut the
> door. Leeam was knocking at the door till he was tired, but the priest
> would not let him in. At last, he put his head out of a window in the
> top of the house, and said: "William O'Rooney, go back to your grave."

> "You're mad, Father Patrick! I'm not dead, and never was in a grave
> since I was born," said Leeam.

> "I saw you dead," said the priest; "you died suddenly, and I was
> present when you were put into the grave, and made a fine sermon over
> you."

> \[101\]

> "The devil from me, but, as sure as I'm alive, you're mad!" said
> Leeam.

> "Go out of my sight now," said the priest, "and I'll read a mass for
> you, to-morrow."

> Leeam went home then, and knocked at his own door, but his wife would
> not let him in. Then he said to himself: "I may as well go and pay my
> rent now." On his way to the landlord's house every one who saw Leeam
> was running before him, for they thought he was dead. When the
> landlord heard that Leeam O'Rooney was coming, he shut the doors and
> would not let him in. Leeam began knocking at the hall-door till the
> lord thought he'd break it in. He came to a window in the top of the
> house, put out his head, and asked: "What are you wanting?"

> "I'm come to pay my rent like an honest man," said Leeam.

> "Go back to your grave, and I'll forgive you your rent," said the
> lord.

> "I won't leave this," said Leeam, "till I get a writing from you that
> I'm paid up clean till next May."

> The lord gave him the writing, and he came home and knocked at his own
> door, but the wife would not let him in. She said that Leeam O'Rooney
> was dead and buried, and that the man at the door was only a deceiver.

> "I'm no deceiver," said William; "I'm after paying my master three
> years' rent, and I'll have possession of my own house, or else I'll
> know why."

> He went to the barn and got a big bar of iron, and it wasn't long till
> he broke in the door. There was great fear on the wife, and the newly
> married husband. They thought they were in the time of the General
> Resurrection, and that the end of the world was coming.

> \[103\]

> "Why did you think I was dead?" said Leeam.

> "Doesn't everybody in the parish know you're dead?" said the wife.

> "Your body from the devil," said Leeam, "you're humbugging me long
> enough, and get me something to eat."

> The poor woman was greatly afraid, and she dressed him some meat, and
> when she saw him eating and drinking, she said: "It's a miracle."

> Then Leeam told her his story from first to last, and she told him
> each thing that happened, and then he said:

> "I'll go to the grave to-morrow, till I see the *behoonuch* ye buried
> in my place."

> The day on the morrow Leeam brought a lot of men with him to the
> churchyard, and they dug open the grave, and were lifting up the
> coffin, when a big black dog jumped out of it, and made off, and Leeam
> and the men after it. They were following it till they saw it going
> into the house in which Leeam had been asleep, and then the ground
> opened, and the house went down, and nobody ever saw it from that out;
> but the big hole is to be seen till this day.

> When Leeam and the men went home, they told everything to the priest
> of the parish, and he dissolved the marriage that was between Leeam's
> wife and the servant boy.

> Leeam lived for years after that, and he left great wealth behind him,
> and they remember him in Clare-Galway still, and will remember him if
> this story goes down from the old people to the young.
