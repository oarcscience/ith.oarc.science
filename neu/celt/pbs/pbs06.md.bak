### PROPHECIES AS TO THE FULFILMENT OF WHICH THERE IS A DOUBT.

HEN a magpie (pitheid) shall have made a nest for three successive years
in the gable of the Church of Ferrintosh, the church will fall when full
of people," is one of those regarding which we find it difficult to
decide whether it has been already fulfilled or not. Mr. Macintyre, who
supplies this version, adds the following remarks:--The Church of
Ferrintosh was known at an earlier period as the Parish Church of
Urquhart and Loggie. Some maintain that this prediction refers to the
Church of Urray. Whether this be so or not, there were circumstances
connected with the Church of Ferrintosh in the time of the famous Rev.
Dr. Macdonald, which seemed to indicate the beginning of the fulfilment
of the prophecy, and which led to very alarming consequences. A magpie
actually did make her nest in the church gable, exactly as foretold.
This, together with a rent between the church wall and the stone stairs
which led up to the gallery, seemed to favour the opinion that the
prophecy was on the eve of being accomplished, and people felt uneasy
when they glanced upon the ominous nest, the rent in the wall, and

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

the crowded congregation, and remembered Coinneach's prophecy, as they
walked into the church to hear the Doctor. It so happened one day that
the church was unusually full of people, insomuch that it was found
necessary to connect the ends of the seats with planks, in order to
accommodate them all. Unfortunately, one of those temporary seats was
either too weak, or too heavily burdened: it snapped in two with a loud
report and startled the audience. Coinneach Odhar's prophecy flashed
across their minds, and a simultaneous rush was made by the panic-struck
congregation to the door. Many fell, and were trampled underfoot, while
others fainted, being seriously crushed and bruised.

Among a rural population, sayings and doings, applicable to a particular
parish, crop up, and, in after times, are applied to occurrences in
neighbouring parishes. Having regard to this, may it not be suggested
that, what is current locally in regard to Ferrintosh and Coinneach's
sayings, may only be a transcript of an event now matter of history in a
parish on the northern side of the Cromarty Firth. We refer to the
destruction of the Abbey Church at Fearn by lightning, October 10, 1742.
We have never seen a detailed account of this sad accident in print, and
have no doubt the reader will be glad to have a graphic description of
it from the pen of Bishop Forbes, the famous author of the "Jacobite
Memoirs," who visited his diocese of Ross and Caithness in the
[summer](errata.htm#2.md) of 1762. This account is taken from his
unpublished MS. Journal, now the property of the College of Bishops of
the Scottish Episcopal Church, and presently in the hands of the Rev. F.
Smith, Arpafeelie, who has kindly permitted us to make the following
extract:--

"The ruinous Church of Ferne was of old an Abbacy of White Friars (see
Keith's Catalogue, p. 247). The roof of

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

flagstones, with part of a side wall, was beat down in an instant by
thunder and lightning on Sunday, October 10th, 1742, and so crushed and
bruised forty persons, that they were scarcely to be discovered, who or
what they were, and therefore, were buried promiscuously, without any
manner of distinction. The gentry, having luckily their seats in the
niches, were saved from the sudden crash, as was the preacher by the
sounding-boards falling upon the pulpit, and his bowing down under it.
Great numbers were wounded (see Scot's Magazine for 1742, p. 485). But
there is a most material circumstance not mentioned, which has been
carefully concealed from the publishers, and it is this: By a
Providential event, this was the first Sunday that the Rev. and
often-mentioned Mr. Stewart, had a congregation near Cadboll, in view of
Ferne, whereby many lives were saved, as the kirk was far from being so
throng as usual, and that he and his people, upon coming out from
worship, and seeing the dismal falling-in just when it happened,
hastened with all speed to the afflictive spot, and dragged many of the
wounded out of the rubbish, whose cries would have pierced a heart of
adamant. Had not this been the happy case, I speak within bounds when I
say two, if not three, to one, would have perished. Some of the wounded
died. This church has been a large and lofty building, as the walls are
very high, and still standing."

It has been suggested that the prediction was fulfilled by the falling
to pieces of the Church at the Disruption; but we would be loth to stake
the reputation of our prophet on this assumption.

Another, supposed by some to be fulfilled by the annual visits of the
militia for their annual drill, is--"That when a wood on the Muir of Ord
grows to a man's height, regiments of soldiers shall be seen there drawn
up in battle order."

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

In connection with the battle, or battles, at Cille-Chriosd and the Muir
of Ord, Mr. Macintyre says:--The Seer foretold that "Fear Ruadh an Uird
(the Red Laird of Ord) would be carried home, wounded, on blankets".
Whether this saying has reference to an event looming in the distant
future, or is a fragment of a tradition regarding sanguinary events well
known in the history of Cille-Chriosd, and of which a full and graphic
account, both in prose and verse, can be seen on pp. 82-86 and 136-139,
Vol. I. of the *Celtic Magazine*, it is impossible to say.
