HE gift of prophecy, second-sight, or "Taibhsearachd," claimed for and
believed by many to have been possessed, in an eminent degree, by
Coinneach Odhar, the Brahan Seer, is one, the belief in which scientific
men and others of the present day accept as unmistakable signs of
looming, if not of actual insanity. We all are, or would be considered,
scientific in these days. It will, therefore, scarcely be deemed prudent
for any one who wishes to lay claim to the slightest modicum of common
sense, to say nothing of an acquaintance with the elementary principles
of science, to commit to paper his ideas on such a subject, unless he is
prepared, in doing so, to follow the common horde in their all but
universal scepticism.

Without committing ourselves to any specific faith on the subject,
however difficult it may be to explain away what follows on strictly
scientific grounds, we shall place before

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

the reader the extraordinary predictions of the Brahan Seer. We have had
slight experiences of our own, which we would hesitate to dignify by the
name of second-sight. It is not, however, with our own experiences that
we have at present to do, but with the "Prophecies" of Coinneach Odhar
Fiosaiche. He is beyond comparison the most distinguished of all our
Highland Seers, and his prophecies have been known throughout the whole
country for more than two centuries. The popular faith in them has been,
and still continues to be, strong and wide-spread. Sir Walter Scott, Sir
Humphrey Davy, Mr. Morrit, Lockhart, and other eminent contemporaries of
the "Last of the Seaforths" firmly believed in them. Many of them were
well known, and recited from generation to generation, centuries before
they were fulfilled. Some of them have been fulfilled in our own day,
and many are still unfulfilled.

Not so much with the view of protecting ourselves from the charge of a
belief in such superstitious folly (for we would hesitate to acknowledge
any such belief), but as a slight palliation for obtruding such nonsense
on the public, we may point out, by the way, that the sacred
writers--who are now believed by many of the would-be-considered-wise to
have been behind the age, and not near so wise and farseeing as we
are--believed in second-sight, witchcraft, and other visions of a
supernatural kind. But then we shall be told by our scientific friends
that the Bible itself is becoming obsolete, and that it has already
served its turn; being only suited for an unenlightened age in which men
like Shakspere, Milton, Newton, Bacon, and such unscientific men could
be considered distinguished. The truth is that on more important topics
than the one we are now considering, the Bible is laid aside by many of
our would-be-scientific lights, whenever it treats of anything beyond
the puny

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

comprehension of the minds and intellectual vision of these omniscient
gentlemen. We have all grown so scientific that the mere idea of
supposing anything possible which is beyond the intellectual grasp of
the scientific enquirer cannot be entertained, although even he must
admit, that in many cases, the greatest men in science, and the
mightiest intellects, find it impossible to understand or explain away
many things as to the existence of which they have no possible doubt. We
even find the clergy slightly inconsistent in questions of this kind.
They solemnly desire to impress us with the fact that ministering
spirits hover about the couches and apartments in which the dying
Christian is drawing near the close of his existence, and preparing to
throw off his mortal coil; but were we to suggest the possibility of any
mere human being, in any conceivable manner having had indications of
the presence of these ghostly visitors, or discovering any signs or
premonitions of the early departure of a relative or of an intimate
friend, our heathen ideas and devious wanderings from the safe channel
of clerical orthodoxy and consistent inconsistency, would be howled
against, and paraded before the faithful as the grossest superstition,
with an enthusiasm and relish possible only to a strait-laced
ecclesiastic. Clerical inconsistency is, however, not our present theme.

Many able men have written on the Second-sight, and to some of them we
shall refer in the following pages; meanwhile our purpose is to place
before the reader the Prophecies of the Brahan Seer, as far as we have
been able to procure them. We are informed that a considerable
collection of them has been made by the late Alexander Cameron of
Lochmaddy, author of the "History and Traditions of the Isle of Skye,"
but we were unable to discover into whose possession the manuscript
found its

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

way; we hope, however, that this reference may bring it to light.

Kenneth Mackenzie, better known as Coinneach Odhar, the Brahan Seer
(according to Mr. Maclennan), was born at Baile-na-Cille, in the Parish
of Uig and Island of Lews, about the beginning of the seventeenth
century. Nothing particular is recorded of his early life, but when he
had just entered his teens, he received a stone in the following manner,
by which he could reveal the future destiny of man:--While his mother
was one evening tending her cattle in a summer shealing on the side of a
ridge called Cnoceothail, which overlooks the burying-ground of
Baile-na-Cille, in Uig, she saw, about the still hour of midnight, the
whole of the graves in the churchyard opening, and a vast multitude of
people of every age, from the newly born babe to the grey-haired sage,
rising from their graves, and going away in every conceivable direction.
In about an hour they began to return, and were all soon after back in
their graves, which closed upon them as before. But, on scanning the
burying-place more closely, Kenneth's mother observed one grave, near
the side, still open. Being a courageous woman, she determined to
ascertain the cause of this singular circumstance, so, hastening to the
grave, and placing her "cuigeal" (distaff) athwart its mouth (for she
had heard it said that the spirit could not enter the grave again while
that instrument was upon it), she watched the result. She had not to
wait long, for in a minute or two she noticed a fair lady coming in the
direction of the churchyard, rushing through the air, from the north. On
her arrival, the fair one addressed her thus--"Lift thy distaff from off
my grave, and let me enter my dwelling of the dead." "I shall do so,"
answered the other, "when you explain to me what detained you so long
after your

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

neighbours." "That you shall soon hear," the ghost replied; "My journey
was much longer than theirs--I had to go all the way to Norway." She
then addressed her:--"I am a daughter of the King of Norway; I was
drowned while bathing in that country; my body was found on the beach
close to where we now stand, and I was interred in this grave. In
remembrance of me, and as a small reward for your intrepidity and
courage, I shall possess you of a valuable secret--go and find in yonder
lake a small round blue stone, which give to your son, Kenneth, who by
it shall reveal future events." She did as requested, found the stone,
and gave it to her son, Kenneth. No sooner had he thus received the gift
of divination than his fame spread far and wide. He was sought after by
the gentry throughout the length and breadth of the land, and no special
assembly of theirs was complete unless Coinneach Odhar was amongst them.
Being born on the lands of Seaforth, in the Lews, he was more associated
with that family than with any other in the country, and he latterly
removed to the neighbourhood of Loch Ussie, on the Brahan estate, where
he worked as a common labourer on a neighbouring farm. He was very
shrewd and clear-headed, for one in his menial position; was always
ready with a smart answer, and if any attempted to raise the laugh at
his expense, seldom or ever did he fail to turn it against his
tormentors.

There are various other versions of the manner in which he became
possessed of the power of divination. According to one--His mistress,
the farmer's wife, was unusually exacting with him, and he, in return,
continually teased, and, on many occasions, expended much of his natural
wit upon her, much to her annoyance and chagrin. Latterly, his conduct
became so unbearable that she decided upon disposing of him in a manner
which would save her any

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

future annoyance. On one occasion, his master having sent him away to
cut peats, which in those days were, as they now are in more remote
districts, the common article of fuel, it was necessary to send him his
dinner, he being too far from the house to come home to his meals, and
the farmer's wife so far carried out her intention of destroying him,
that she poisoned his dinner. It was somewhat late in arriving, and the
future prophet feeling exhausted from his honest exertions in his
master's interest and from want of food, lay down on the heath and fell
into a heavy slumber. In this position he was suddenly awakened by
feeling something cold in his breast, which on examination he found to
be a small white stone, with a hole through the centre. He looked
through it, when a vision appeared to him which revealed the treachery
and diabolical intention of his mistress. To test the truth of the
vision, he gave the dinner intended for himself to his faithful collie;
the poor brute writhed, and died soon after in the greatest agony.

The following version is supplied by Mr. Macintyre, teacher,
Arpafeelie:--Although the various accounts as to the manner in which
Coinneach Odhar became gifted with second-sight differ in some respects,
yet they generally agree in this, that it was acquired while he was
engaged in the humble occupation of cutting peats or divots, which were
in his day, and still are in many places, used as fuel throughout the
Highlands of Scotland. On the occasion referred to, being somewhat
fatigued, he lay down, resting his head upon a little knoll, and waited
the arrival of his wife with his dinner, whereupon he fell fast asleep.
On awaking, he felt something hard under his head, and examining the
cause of the uneasiness, discovered a small round stone with a hole
through the middle. He picked it up, and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

looking through it, saw by the aid of this prophetic stone that his wife
was coming to him with a dinner consisting of sowans and milk, polluted,
though unknown to her, in a manner which, as well as several other
particulars connected with it, we forbear to mention. But Coinneach
found that though this stone was the means by which a supernatural power
had been conferred upon him, it had, on its very first application,
deprived him of the sight of that eye with which he looked through it,
and he continued ever afterwards *cam*, or blind of an eye.

It would appear from this account that the intended murderer made use of
the Seer's wife to convey the poison to her own husband, thus adding to
her diabolical and murderous intention, by making her who would feel the
loss the keenest, the medium by which her husband was to lose his life.

Hugh Miller, in his "Scenes and Legends in the North of Scotland,"
says:--When serving as a field labourer with a wealthy clansman who
resided somewhere near Brahan Castle, he made himself so formidable to
the clansman's wife by his shrewd, sarcastic humour, that she resolved
on destroying him by poison. With this design, she mixed a preparation
of noxious herbs with his food, when he was one day employed in digging
turf in a solitary morass, and brought it to him in a pitcher. She found
him lying asleep on one of those conical fairy hillocks which abound in
some parts of the Highlands, and her courage failing her, instead of
awaking him, she set down the pitcher by his side and returned home. He
woke shortly after, and, seeing the food, would have begun his repast,
but feeling something press heavily against his heart, he opened his
waistcoat and found a beautiful smooth stone, resembling a pearl, but
much larger, which had apparently been dropped into his

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

breast while he slept. He gazed at it in admiration, and became
conscious as he gazed, that a strange faculty of seeing the future as
distinctly as the present, and men's real designs and motives as clearly
as their actions, was miraculously imparted to him; and it is well for
him that he should become so knowing at such a crisis, for the first
secret he became acquainted with was that of the treachery practised
against him by his mistress.

We have thus several accounts of the manner in which our prophet
obtained possession of his remarkable stone, white or blue, with or
without a hole through its centre, it matters little; that he did obtain
it, we must assume to be beyond question; but it is a matter for
consideration, and indeed open to considerable doubt, whether it had any
real prophetic virtue. If Kenneth was really possessed of the power of
prophecy he more than likely used the stone simply to impose upon the
people, who would never believe him possessed of such a gift, unless
they saw with their own eyes the means by which he exercised it.

We shall, as far as possible, give the Prophecies under the following
headings--Those which might be attributed to great penetration and
natural shrewdness; those which are still unfulfilled; those that are
doubtful; and those which have been unquestionably fulfilled, or partly
fulfilled.
