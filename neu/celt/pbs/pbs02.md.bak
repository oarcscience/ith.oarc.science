### The Brahan Seer and Second Sight.

#### BY ANDREW LANG.

MR. MACKAY has asked me to make a few comments on Mr. Mackenzie's
"Prophecies of the Brahan Seer," and I do so for the sake of old times
and old ideas. Unlike Mr Mackenzie, I can unblushingly confess the
belief that there probably are occasional instances of second sight,
that is, of "premonitions." I know too many examples among persons of my
acquaintance, mostly Lowlanders or English, to have any doubt about the
matter. Hegel was of the same opinion, and was not ashamed to include
second sight in his vast philosophic system. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) As to the modus of second sight, "how it is
done," in fact, I have no theory. If there is a psychical element in
man, if there is something

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

more than a mechanical result of physical processes in nerve, brain, and
blood, then we cannot set any limit to the range of "knowledge
super-normally acquired." "Time and space are only hallucinations," as a
philosopher has audaciously remarked. They may be transcended by the
spirit in man, *et voilà pourquoi votre fille est muette!* This
explanation, of course, is of the vaguest, but I have no better to
suggest.

By an odd coincidence, two cases of second sight, of recent date, in the
experience of an educated lady, reached me yesterday at first hand, and,
as I pen these words another (knowledge of a death at a distance) comes
to me from a distinguished philologist. But he thinks he was ten minutes
out in his reckoning, which, allowing for difference of watches, is not
much. A fourth case is from a Royal Academician, an intimate friend. He
and a lady, also of my acquaintance, were being shewn over a beautiful
new house by the owner. My friend, in the owner's bedroom, turned pale.
The lady, when they went out, asked him what ailed him. "I saw
X-------"(the owner of the house) "lying dead in his bed." X-------died
within a month, which would be thought fair work in the Highlands.

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An odder case
occurred last year. On June 15, a lady, well known to me, and in various
fields of literature, told me that, calling on another lady the day
before, she had seen a vision of a man, previously unknown to her, who
thrust a knife into her friend's left side. I offered to bet £100
against fulfilment. In autumn my friend, again calling at the same
house, met the man of her vision on the doorsteps. Entering, she found
her friend dying, as her constitution did not rally after an operation
on her left side, performed by the man of the vision, who was a surgeon.
This is much in the Highland manner. Of the Seers here alluded to (and I
might add many other modern instances in my own knowledge), only one was
Celtic. For savage examples which illustrate the belief (though evidence
cannot, of course, be procured with exactness), I may be permitted to
refer to my "Making of Religion" (pp. 72-158). The kind of story is
always the same. And the legends of St. Columba, in Adamnan, are much on
a par, in many cases, with modern examples in *The Proceedings of the
Society for Physchical Research*. The uniformity of the reports argues
the existence of some facts at their base.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

While I am credulous to this extent, I vastly prefer modern cases, at
first hand, and corroborated (as when I can swear that the lady told me
of her vision before its fulfilment), to the rumours of the Brahan Seer.
We can scarcely ever, except as to the deaf Seaforth, find any evidence
that the prophecies were recorded before the event. In many cases
fulfilment could only occur, either in the ancient fighting Clan
society, or under its revival, to which we cannot look with much
confidence. The prophecies about sheep one has no evidence to prove
earlier than, say, 1770. As to the burning of the Seer, if it really had
clerical sanction, why are Kirk Sessions' Registers not brought forward
as proof? Have they been examined for this purpose? We are, in fact,
dealing with poetical legend, not with evidence.

In one respect Kenneth is peculiar, among Highland Seers. He is a
"Crystal-gazer," whether his "gibber" (as Australian savages call
divining stones) was blue, or grey, or pearly, perforated or not. This
use of stones, usually crystals, or black stones, I have found among
Australians, Tonkaways, Aztecs, Incas, Samoyeds, Polynesians, Maoris,
Greeks, Egyptians, in Fez: water, ink, or blood being also employed to

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

stare at. The whole topic is discussed in my book already cited, with
many modern examples. Now I do not, [elsewhere](errata.htm#0.md), know more
than one or two cases of this kind of divination in the Highlands. The
visions are usually spontaneous and uninvoked, except when the seer uses
the blade-bone of a sheep. In the interests of Folk Lore, or Psychology,
or both, people who have the opportunity should record cases of the use
of divining stones in the Highlands. It is even more desirable that the
statements of second-sighted men (they are common enough, to my personal
knowledge, in Sutherland, Lochaber, and Glencoe) *should be taken down
before fulfilment*. Unless this is done, the predictions, as matter of
evidence, go for nothing. We must try to discover the percentage of
failures, before we can say whether the successes are not due to chance
coincidence, or to misstatement, or to mere imposture. I have little or
no doubt that the Ferrintosh story (told in this book) is a
misconception, based on the actual calamity at Fearn, long after the
Seer was dead. In fact, like Dr. Johnson, I want more evidence. He was
ready to believe, but unconvinced. I am rather more credulous, but it
would be very easy to upset

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

my faith, and certainly it cannot be buttressed by vague reports on the
authority of tradition. It may be urged that to inquire seriously into
such things is to encourage superstition. But if inquiry merely
unearthed failure and imposture, even superstition would be discouraged.
