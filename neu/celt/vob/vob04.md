### I. The Conception of Mongán.

Fiachna Lurga, the father of Mongán, was sole king of the
province. <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101) He had a friend in
Scotland, to wit, Aedán, <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102) the son
of Gabrán. A message went from him to Aedán. A \[5\] message went from
Aedán to him that he would come to his aid. He was in warfare against
Saxons. <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103) A terrible warrior was
brought by them for the death of Aedán in the battle. Then Fiachna went
across. He left his queen at home.

While the hosts were fighting in Scotland, a noble-looking \[10\] man
went to his wife in his stronghold in Rathmore of Moylinny. At the time
he went there were not many in the stronghold. He asked the woman to
arrange a place of meeting. The woman said there were not in the world
possessions or treasures, for which she would do anything to disgrace
her \[15\] husband's honour. He asked her whether she would do it to
save her husband's life. She said that if she were to see him in danger
and difficulty, <span id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_104) she would help him
with all that lay in her might. <span id="fr_105"></span>[5](#fn_105) He
said she should do it then, <span id="fr_106"></span>[6](#fn_106) 'for
thy husband is in great danger. A terrible man has been brought against
\[20\] him on whom they cannot . . ., and he will die by his hand. If
we, I and thou, make love, thou wilt bear a son thereof. That son will
be famous; he will be Mongán. I shall go to the battle which will be
fought to-morrow at the third hour, so that I shall save him, and I
shall vanquish <span id="fr_107"></span>[7](#fn_107) the warrior before
the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

eyes of the men of Scotland. And I shall tell thy husband our
adventures, and that it is thon that hast sent me to his help.'

It was done thus. When army was drawn up against army, the hosts saw
something---a noble-looking man before the army of Aedán and Fiachna. He
went towards Fiachna in \[5\] particular, and told him the conversation
with his wife the day before, and that he had promised to come to his
help at that hour. Thereupon he went before the army towards the other,
and vanquished the soldier. And the battle was routed before Aedán and
Fiachna. \[10\]

And Fiachna returned to his country. And the woman was pregnant and bore
a son, even Mongán son of Fiachna. And he thanked his wife for what she
had done for him, and she confessed all her adventures. So that this
Mongán is a son of Manannán mac Lir, though he is called Mongán son of
\[15\] Fiachna. For when he went from her in the rooming he left a
quatrain with Mongán's mother, saying:

'I go home, <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108)  
The pale pure morning draws near: <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109)  
Moninnán son of Ler \[20\]  
Is the name of him who came to thee.'
