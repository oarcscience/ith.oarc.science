### II. A Story from which it is inferred that Mongán was Find mac Cumaill, and the cause of the death of Fothad Airgdech. <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)

Mongán was in Rathmore of Moylinny in his kingship. To him went Forgoll
the poet. Through him many a married \[5\] couple was complaining to
Mongán. <span id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md) Every night the poet would
recite a story to Mongán. So great was his lore that they were thus from
Halloween to May-day. He had gifts and food from Mongán.

One day Mongán asked his poet what was the death of \[10\] Fothad
Airgdech. Forgoll said he was slain at Duffry in Leinster. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[3](#fn_112.md)' Mongán said it was false. The poet said
he would satirise him with his lampoons, and he would satirise his
father and his mother and his grandfather, and he would sing (spells)
upon their waters, so that fish should not be caught in their \[15\]
river-mouths. He would sing upon their woods, so that they should not
give fruit, upon their plains, so that they should be barren for ever of
any produce. Mongán promised him his will of precious things as far as
(the value of) seven handmaids, or twice seven handmaids, or three times
seven. At last he offers \[20\] him one-third, or one-half of his land,
or his whole land; at last (anything) save only his own liberty with
(that of) his wife Breóthigernd, unless he were redeemed before the end
of three days. The poet refused all except as regards the woman. For the
sake of his honour Mongán consented. Thereat the \[25\]

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

woman was sorrowful. The tear was not taken from her cheek. Mongán told
her not to be sorrowful, help would certainly come to them.

So it came to the third day. The poet began to enforce his \[5\] bond.
Mongán told him to wait till evening. He and his wife were in their
bower. The woman weeps as her surrender drew near and she saw no help.
Mongán said: 'Be not sorrowful, woman. He who is even now coming to our
help, I hear his feet in the Labrinne.' <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md)

\[10\] They wait a while. Again the woman wept. 'Weep not, woman ' He
who is now coming to our help, I hear his feet in the Máin.' <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md)

Thus they were waiting between every two watches of the day. She would
weep, he would still say: 'Weep not, woman, \[15\] He who is now coming
to our help, I hear his feet in the Laune, in Lough Leane, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md) in the Morning-star River between the Úi
Fidgente and the Arada, <span id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_116.md) in the
Suir on Moy-Fevin <span id="fr_117"></span>[5](#fn_117.md) in

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Munster, in the
Echuir, <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) in the Barrow, in the
Liffey, <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) in the Boyne, in the
Dee, <span id="fr_120"></span>[3](#fn_120.md) in the Tuarthesc, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_121.md) in Carlingford Lough, in the Nid, <span
id="fr_122"></span>[5](#fn_122.md) in the Newry river, in the Larne Water
in front of Rathmore.'

When night came to them, Mongán was, on his couch in his palace, and his
wife at his right hand, and she sorrowful. The \[5\] poet was summoning
them by their sureties and their bonds. While they were there, a man is
announced approaching the rath from the south. His cloak was in a fold
around him, and in his hand a headless spear-shaft that was not very
small. By that shaft he leapt across the three ramparts, so that he was
in \[10\] the middle of the garth, thence into the middle of the palace,
thence between Mongán and the wall at his pillow. The poet was in the
back of the house behind the king. The question is argued in the house
before the warrior that had come. 'What is the matter here?' said be. 'I
and the poet yonder,' said \[15\] Mongán, 'have made a wager about the
death of Fothad Airgdech. He said it was at Duffry in Leinster. I said
that was false.' The warrior said the poet was wrong. 'It will be . .
.,' said Forgoll, '. . .' <span id="fr_123"></span>[6](#fn_123.md) 'That
were not good,' said the warrior. 'It shall be proved. 'We were with
thee, with Find,' said the \[20\] warrior. 'Hush!' said Mongán, 'that is
not fair.' 'We were with Find, then,' said he. 'We came from Scotland.
We met with Fothad Airgthech here yonder on the Larne river. There we
fought a battle. I made a cast at him, so that it passed

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

through him and went into the earth beyond him and left its iron head in
the earth. This here is the shaft that was in that spear. The bare stone
from which I made that cast will be found, and the iron head will be
found in the earth, and the \[5\] tomb of Fothad Airgdech will be found
a little to the east of it. A stone chest is about him there in the
earth. There, upon the chest, are his two bracelets of silver, and his
two arm-rings, and his neck-torque of silver. And by his tomb there is a
stone pillar. And on the end of the pillar that is in the earth \[10\]
there is Ogam. This is what it says: "This is Eochaid Airgdech. Cáilte
slew me in an encounter against Find."'

They went with the warrior. Everything was found thus. It was Cáilte,
Find's foster-son, that had come to them. Mongán, however, was Find,
though he would not let it be told.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_110"></span>[49:1](vob05.htm#fr_110.md) Fothad Airgdech, also
called Oendé, was one of the three Fothads, brothers, who reigned
together over Ireland for one year (A.D. 284): see LL. 24 a, 29, 190 b,
10.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[49:2](vob05.htm#fr_111.md) Forgoll seems to have
been an overbearing and exacting *fili* of the type of Athirne and
Dallán Forgaill.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[49:3](vob05.htm#fr_112.md) In the barony of
Scarawalsh, co. Wexford. Forgoll's statement perhaps rests on a
confusion of this Leinster Dubthar with another Dubthar in Dál Aráide,
mentioned in *Silva Gadelica*, i. p. 118, 30.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[50:1](vob05.htm#fr_113.md) According to Hennessy
(Jubainville, Le Cycle Mythologrque, p. 339) the river Caragh, which
flows into Dingle Bay, co. Kerry. O’Donovan, who gives a wrong
nominative, Labhrann instead of Labrainne (F.M., A.M., 3751), supposed
it to be the Cashen in the north of co. Kerry; but that would not suit.
Cf. tomaidm Fleisce 7 Mane 7 Labrainne, LL. 17 b, 45.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[50:2](vob05.htm#fr_114.md) This must be the name
of some small stream between the Caragh and the Laune. It cannot be the
Maine, the Irish name of which is Maing, gen. Mainge. If Máin stands for
an older Móin, we have here the Irish equivalent of the Gaulish Moinos,
the German Main.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[50:3](vob05.htm#fr_115.md) The great Lake of
Killarney.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[50:4](vob05.htm#fr_116.md) 'The Ui-Fidhgeinte and
the Aradha were seated in the present county of Limerick, and their
territories were divided from each other by the river Maigge and the
stream now called the Morning-star River.' O’Don. F. M., A.D. 666, note.
Samáir has been corrupted into Camáir, now Camhaoir, which means
'daybreak.' Hence the English name.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[50:5](vob05.htm#fr_117.md) A plain in the present
barony of Iffa and Offa East, south of SIievenaman, co. Tipperary.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[51:1](vob05.htm#fr_118.md) Not identified. It
should be in co. Kilkenny. One would expect the Nore to have been
mentioned, which Cálite had to cross. Perhaps Echuir is an old name for
the Nore.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[51:2](vob05.htm#fr_119.md) Ruirthech, for
*ro-rethech*, 'the strong running,' an old name for the Liffey. Badly
spelt Ruirech by O’Reilly.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[51:3](vob05.htm#fr_120.md) Níth, now the Dee in
the bar. of Ardee, co. Louth. Cf. the river-name Nith in Dumfries.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[51:4](vob05.htm#fr_121.md) Not identified.
Perhaps the Glyde or Fane in co. Louth.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[51:5](vob05.htm#fr_122.md) Not identified. Some
river or stream in co. Down. Cf. Nid-nari, the name of a Pictish tribe
in Galloway (Bede, *Vit. Cuthb.* c. xi.), and the Greek river-name Neda.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[51:6](vob05.htm#fr_123.md) I cannot translate
this passage.
