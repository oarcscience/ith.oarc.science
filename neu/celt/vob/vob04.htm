<p>Fiachna Lurga, the father of Mong&aacute;n, was sole king of the province.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He had a friend in Scotland, to wit, Aed&aacute;n,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the son of Gabr&aacute;n. A message went from him to Aed&aacute;n. A [5] message went from Aed&aacute;n to him that he would come to his aid. He was in warfare against Saxons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> A terrible warrior was brought by them for the death of Aed&aacute;n in the battle. Then Fiachna went across. He left his queen at home.</p>  
<p>While the hosts were fighting in Scotland, a noble-looking [10] man went to his wife in his stronghold in Rathmore of Moylinny. At the time he went there were not many in the stronghold. He asked the woman to arrange a place of meeting. The woman said there were not in the world possessions or treasures, for which she would do anything to disgrace her [15] husband's honour. He asked her whether she would do it to save her husband's life. She said that if she were to see him in danger and difficulty,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> she would help him with all that lay in her might.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> He said she should do it then,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> 'for thy husband is in great danger. A terrible man has been brought against [20] him on whom they cannot . . ., and he will die by his hand. If we, I and thou, make love, thou wilt bear a son thereof. That son will be famous; he will be Mong&aacute;n. I shall go to the battle which will be fought to-morrow at the third hour, so that I shall save him, and I shall vanquish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> the warrior before the</p>

<p>eyes of the men of Scotland. And I shall tell thy husband our adventures, and that it is thon that hast sent me to his help.'</p>  
<p>It was done thus. When army was drawn up against army, the hosts saw something---a noble-looking man before the army of Aed&aacute;n and Fiachna. He went towards Fiachna in [5] particular, and told him the conversation with his wife the day before, and that he had promised to come to his help at that hour. Thereupon he went before the army towards the other, and vanquished the soldier. And the battle was routed before Aed&aacute;n and Fiachna. [10]</p>  
<p>And Fiachna returned to his country. And the woman was pregnant and bore a son, even Mong&aacute;n son of Fiachna. And he thanked his wife for what she had done for him, and she confessed all her adventures. So that this Mong&aacute;n is a son of Manann&aacute;n mac Lir, though he is called Mong&aacute;n son of [15] Fiachna. For when he went from her in the rooming he left a quatrain with Mong&aacute;n's mother, saying:</p>
