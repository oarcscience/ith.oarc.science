### IV. These are the events that brought about the telling of 'Mongan's Frenzy.' <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md)

Findtigernd, <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) Mongán's wife,
besought Mongán to tell her the simple truth of his adventures. He asked
of her a respite of seven years. It was granted. Then that period
arrived. The \[15\] men of Ireland had a great gathering at Usnech in
Meath, the year of the death of Ciarán the son of the Carpenter, and of
the slaying of Túathal Maelgarb, <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md)
and of the taking of the kingship by Diarmait. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_140) The hosts were on (the hill of.md) Usnech.
A great hail-storm came upon them there. Such was its greatness \[20\]
that the one shower left twelve chief streams in Ireland for ever.
Mongán with seven men arose and went from the cairn aside, and his queen
and his shanachie Cairthide, son of Marcán. Then they saw something, a
prominent stronghold

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

with a frontage of ancient trees. They go to it. They went into the
enclosure. They go into a marvellous house there. A covering of bronze
was on the house, a pleasant bower over its windows. Seven conspicuous
men were there. Within \[5\] the house there was a marvellous spread of
quilts and covers, and of wonderful jewels. Seven vats of wine there
were. Mongán was made welcome in the house. He stayed there. He became
intoxicated. It was then and there that Mongán sang the 'Frenzy' to his
wife, since he had \[10\] promised he would tell her something of his
adventures. It seemed to them it was not very long they were in that
house. They deemed it to be no more but one night. However, they were
there a full year. When they awoke, they saw it was Rathmore <span
id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) of Moy-Linny in which they were.
