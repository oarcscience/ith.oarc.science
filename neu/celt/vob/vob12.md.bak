### IX

### From Gilla Modutu's poem *Senchas Ban*, written A.D. 1141, Book of Leinster, p. 140 a, 29.

'Ingen do Ch*a*mmáin Dub-Lacha,  
  lennán Mongáin, maith a ciand,  
\[20\] Colgo, Conall, ba lucht láthair,  
  Cáintig*er*n a máthair mall:  
ingen maic Demmáin Dub-Lacha  
  na n-gellám cen tacha thall.'

Cammán's daughter was Dub-Lacha,  
\[25\]  The beloved of Mongán, their offspring was good,  
Colgo, Conall, that were folk of strength,  
  Cáintigern was his gentle mother.  
Daughter of Demmán's son was Dub-Lacha  
  Of the white arms, without fault, of yore.'

\[30\] Cammán Dub, the daughter of Furudrán mac Bécce, of the royal race
of the Ui Turtri, was the wife of Fiachna Dub mac Demmáin (LL: 140 *a*,
27).

Unless *máthair mall* may mean 'grandmother,' we must translate as I
have done, and refer the *a* 'his' to Mongán.

\[35\] As to Dub-Lacha being called 'of the white arms,' cf. her by-name
Láimhghel, p. 61, 10 above.
