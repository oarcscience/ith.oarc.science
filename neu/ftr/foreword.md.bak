FOREWORD

IN Russia, as elsewhere in the world, folklore is rapidly scattering
before the practical spirit of modern progress. The traveling peasant
bard or story teller, and the devoted "nyanya," the beloved nurse of
many a generation, are rapidly dying out, and with them the tales and
legends, the last echoes of the nation's early joys and sufferings,
hopes and fears, are passing away. The student of folk-lore knows that
the time has come when haste is needed to catch these vanishing songs of
the nation's youth and to preserve them for the delight of future
generations. In sending forth the stories in the present volume, all of
which are here set down in print for the first time, it is my hope that
they may enable American children to share with the children of Russia
the pleasure of glancing into the magic world of the old Slavic nation.

THE AUTHOR.
