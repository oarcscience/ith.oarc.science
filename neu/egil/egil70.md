CHAPTER LXIX.  
  

Egil comes out to Iceland.  
  

In the summer Egil prepared his ship, and, when all was ready, at once
set sail for Iceland. His voyage sped well. He came to Borgar-firth and
brought in his ship just below his own house. He had his cargo conveyed
home, and set up his ship. Egil stayed in his home that winter. He had
now brought out very great wealth, and was a very rich man. He had a
large and lofty house. Egil was by no means meddlesome with other men's
matters, nor generally presuming when here in Iceland; nor did any try
to encroach on what was his. Egil remained at home now for years not a
few. Egil and Asgerdr had children thus named: Bodvar a son, and another
son Gunnar; Thorgerdr a daughter, and Bera. Their youngest was
Thorstein. All Egil's children were of good promise and intelligence.
Thorgerdr was the eldest of the children, Bera the next.
