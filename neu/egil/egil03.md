CHAPTER II.  
  
*Of Aulvir Hnuf.*  
  

        Audbjorn was then king over the Firthfolk; there was an earl of
his named Hroald, whose son was Thorir. Atli the Slim was then an earl,
he dwelt at Gaula; he had sons—Hallstein, Holmstein, and Herstein; and a
daughter, Solveig the Fair. It happened one autumn that much people were
gathered at Gaula for a sacrificial feast, then saw Aulvir Hnuf Solveig
and courted her; he afterwards asked her to wife. But the earl thought
him an unequal match and would not give her. Whereupon Aulvir composed
many love-songs, and thought so much of Solveig that he left
freebooting, but Thorolf and Eyvind Lambi kept it on.
