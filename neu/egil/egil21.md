CHAPTER XX.  
  
*Skallagrim's marriage.*  
  

There was a man named Yngvar, powerful and wealthy. He had been a baron
of the former kings. But after Harold came to the throne, Yngvar sate at
home and served not the king. Yngvar was married and had a daughter
named Bera. Yngvar dwelt in the Firths. Bera was his only child and
heiress. Grim Kveldulf's son asked Bera to wife, and the match was
arranged. Grim took Bera in the winter following the summer when Thorolf
had parted from him and his father.  
Grim was then twenty-five years old, and was now bald, wherefore he was
henceforth called Skallagrim. He had then the management of all the
farms belonging to his father and himself and of all the produce, though
Kveldulf was yet a hale and strong man. They had many freedmen about
them, and many men who had grown up there at home and were about
Skallagrim's equals in age. Men of prowess and strength they were
mostly, for both father and son chose strong fellows to be their
followers, and trained them after their mind. Skallagrim was like his
father in stature and strength, as also in face and temper.
