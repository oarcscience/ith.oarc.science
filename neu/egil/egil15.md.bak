CHAPTER XIV.  
  
*Thorolf again in Finmark.*  
  

That winter Thorolf went again to Finmark, taking with him about a
hundred men. As before, he held a fair with the Finns, and travelled far
and wide over Finmark. But when he reached the far east, and his coming
was heard of, then came to him some Kvens, saying that they were sent by
Faravid, king of Kvenland, because the Kiriales were harrying his land;
and his message was that Thorolf should go thither and bear him help;
and further that Thorolf should have a share of the booty equal to the
king's share, and each of his men as much as two Kvens. With the Kvens
the law was that the king should have one-third as compared with his men
when the booty was shared, and beyond that, as reserved for him, all
bearskins and sables. Thorolf put this proposal before his men, giving
them the choice to go or not; and the more part chose to venture it, as
the prize was so great. This is was decided that they should go
eastwards with the messengers.  
Finmark is a wide tract; it is bounded westwards by the sea, wherefrom
large firths run in; by sea also northwards and round to the east; but
southwards lies Norway; and Finmark stretches along nearly all the
inland region to the south, as also does Halogaland outside. But
eastwards from Naumdale is Jamtaland, then Helsingjaland and Kvenland,
then Finland, then Kirialaland; along all these lands to the north lies
Finmark, and there are wide inhabited fell-districts, some in dales,
some by lakes. The lakes of Finmark are wonderfully large, and by the
lakes there are extensive forests. But high fells lie behind from end to
end of the Mark, and this ridge is called Keels.  
But when Thorolf came to Kvenland and met king Faravid, they made them
ready for their march, being three hundred of the kings men and a fourth
hundred Norsemen. And they went by the upper way over Finmark, and came
where the Kiriales were on the fell, the same who had before harried the
Kvens. These, when they were aware of the enemy, gathered themselves and
advanced to meet them, expecting victory as heretofore. But, on the
battle being joined, the Norsemen charged furiously forwards, bearing
shields stronger than those of the Kvens; the slaughter turned to be in
the Kiriales' ranks—many fell, some fled. King Faravid and Thorolf took
there immense wealth of spoil, and returned to Kvenland, whence
afterwards Thorolf and his men came to Finmark, he and Faravid parting
in friendship.  
Thorolf came down from the fell to Vefsnir; then went first to his farm
at Sandness, stayed there awhile, and in spring went with his men north
to Torgar.  
But when he came there, it was told him how Hildirida's sons had been
that winter at Throndheim with king Harold, and that they would not
spare to slander Thorolf with the king; and it was much questioned what
grounds they had had for their slander. Thorolf answered thus: 'The king
will not believe this, though such lies be laid before him; for there
are no grounds for my turning traitor to him, when he has done me much
good and no evil. And so far from wishing to do him harm (though I had
the choice), I would much rather be a baron of his than be called king,
when some other fellow-countrymen might rise and make me his thrall.'
