CHAPTER LXXXII.  
  

Hacon's wars and death. Poem on Arinbjorn.  
  

Long time did Egil dwell at Borg, and became an old man. But it is not
told that he had lawsuits with any here in the land; nor is there a word
of single combats, or war and slaughter of his after he settled down
here in Iceland. They say that Egil never went abroad out of Iceland
after the events already related. And for this the main cause was that
Egil might not be in Norway, by reason of the charges which (as has been
told before) the kings there deemed they had against him. He kept house
in munificent style, for there was no lack of money, and his disposition
led him to munificence.  
King Hacon, Athelstan's foster-son, long ruled over Norway; but in the
latter part of his life Eric's sons came to Norway and strove with him
for the kingdom; and they had battles together, wherein Hacon ever won
the victory. The last battle was fought in Hordaland, on Stord-island,
at Fitjar: there king Hacon won the victory, but also got his
death-wound. After that Egil's sons took the kingdom in Norway.  
Lord Arinbjorn was with Harold Eric's son, and was made his counsellor,
and had of him great honours. He was commander of his forces and
defender of the land. A great warrior was Arinbjorn, and a victorious.
He was governor of the Firth folk. Egil Skallagrimsson heard these
tidings of the change of kings in Norway, and therewith how Arinbjorn
had returned to his estates in Norway, and was there in great honour.
Then Egil composed a poem about Arinbjorn, whereof this is the
beginning:  
  

ARINBJORN'S EPIC, OR A PART THEREOF.  

  
                                                1.  
                                'For generous prince  
                                Swift praise I find,  
                                But stint my words  
                                To stingy churl.  
                                Openly sing I  
                                Of king's true deeds,  
                                But silence keep  
                                On slander's lies.  
  
                                                2.  
                                'For fabling braggarts  
                                Full am I of scorn,  
                                But willing speak I  
                                Of worthy friends:  
                                Courts I of monarchs  
                                A many have sought,  
                                A gallant minstrel  
                                Of guileless mood.  
  
                                                3.  
                                'Erewhile the anger  
                                Of Yngling's son  
                                I bore, prince royal  
                                Of race divine.  
                                With hood of daring  
                                O'er dark locks drawn  
                                A lord right noble  
                                I rode to seek.  
  
                                                4.  
                                'There sate in might  
The monarch strong,  
With helm of terror  
High-throned and dread;  
A king unbending  
With bloody blade  
Within York city  
Wielded he power.  
  
                                                5.  
                                'That moon-like brightness  
Might none behold,  
Nor brook undaunted  
Great Eric's brow:  
As fiery serpent  
His flashing eyes  
Shot starry radiance  
Stern and keen.  
  
                                                6.  
                                'Yet I to this ruler  
Of fishful seas  
My bolster-mate's ransom  
Made bold to bear,  
Of Odin's goblet  
O'erflowing dew  
Each listening ear-mouth  
Eagerly drank.  
  
                                                7.  
                                'Not beauteous in seeming  
My bardic fee  
To ranks of heroes  
In royal hall:  
When I my hood-knoll  
Wolf-gray of hue  
For mead of Odin  
From monarch gat.  
  
                                                8.  
                                'Thankful I took it,  
And therewithal  
The pit-holes black  
Of my beetling brows;  
Yea and that mouth  
That for me bare  
The poem of praise  
To princely knees.  
  
                                                9.  
                                'Tooth-fence took I,  
And tongue likewise,  
Ears' sounding chambers  
And sheltering eaves.  
And better deemed I  
Than brightest gold  
The gift then given  
By glorious king.  
  
                                                10.  
                                'There a staunch stay  
Stood by my side,  
One man worth many  
Of meaner wights,  
Mine own true friend  
Whom trusty I found,  
High-couraged ever  
In counsels bold.  
  
                                                11.  
                                'Arinbjorn  
Alone us saved—  
Foremost of champions—  
From fury of king;  
Friend of the monarch  
He framed no lies  
Within that palace  
Of warlike prince.  
  
                                                12.  
                                'Of the stay of our house  
Still spake he truth,  
(While much he honoured  
My hero-deeds)  
Of the son of Kveldulf,  
Whom fair-haired king  
Slew for a slander,  
But honoured slain.  
  
                                                13.  
                                'Wrong were it if he  
                                Who wrought me good,  
                                Gold-splender lavish,  
                                Such gifts had cast  
                                To the wasteful tract  
                                Of the wild sea-mew,  
                                To the surge rough-ridden  
                                By sea-kings' steeds.  
  
                                                14.  
                                'False to my friend  
Were I fairly called,  
An untrue steward  
Of Odin's cup;  
Of praise unworthy,  
Pledge-breaker vile,  
If I for such good  
Gave nought again.  
  
                                                15.  
                                'Now better seeth  
The bard to climb  
With feet poetic  
The frowning steep,  
And set forth open  
In sight of all  
The laud and honour  
Of high-born chief.  
  
                                                16.  
                                'Now shall my voice-plane  
Shape into song  
Virtues full many  
Of valiant friend.  
Ready on tongue  
Twofold they lie,  
Yea, threefold praises  
Of Thorir's son.  
  
                                                17.  
                                'First tell I forth  
What far is known,  
Openly bruited  
In ears of all;  
How generous of mood  
Men deem this lord,  
Bjorn of the hearth-fire  
The birchwood's bane.  
  
                                                18.  
                                'Folk bear witness  
With wond'ring praise,  
How to all guests  
Good gifts he gives:  
For Bjorn of the hearth-stone  
Is blest with store  
Freely and fully  
By Frey and Njord.  
  
                                                19.  
                                'To him, high scion  
Of Hroald's tree,  
Fulness of riches  
Flowing hath come;  
And friends ride thither  
In thronging crowd  
By all wide ways  
'Neath windy heaven.  
  
                                                20.  
                                'Above his ears  
Around his brow  
A coronal fair,  
As a king, he wore.  
Beloved of gods,  
Beloved of men,  
The warrior's friend,  
The weakling's aid.  
  
                                                21.  
                                'That mark he hitteth  
That most men miss;  
Though money they gather,  
This many lack:  
For few be the bounteous  
And far between,  
Nor easily shafted  
Are all men's spears.  
  
                                                22.  
                                'Out of the mansion  
Of Arinbjorn,  
When guested and rested  
In generous wise,  
None with hard jest,  
None with rude jeer,  
None with his axe-hand  
Ungifted hie.  
  
                                                23.  
                                'Hater of money  
Is he of the Firths,  
A foe to the gold-drops  
Of Draupnir born.  
. . . . .  
  
                                                24.  
                                'Rings he scatters,  
Riches he squanders,  
Of avarice thievish  
An enemy still.  
. . . . .  
  
                25.  
'Long course of life  
His lot hath been,  
By battles broken,  
Bereft of peace.  
. . . . .  
  
                26.  
'Early waked I,  
Word I gathered,  
Toiled each morning  
With speech-moulding tongue.  
A proud pile built I  
Of praise long-lasting  
To stand unbroken  
In Bragi's town.'
