<CENTER>CHAPTER II.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Of Aulvir Hnuf.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audbjorn was then king over the Firthfolk; there was an earl of his named Hroald, whose son was Thorir.  Atli the Slim was then an earl, he dwelt at Gaula; he had sons—Hallstein, Holmstein, and Herstein; and a daughter, Solveig the Fair.  It happened one autumn that much people were gathered at Gaula for a sacrificial feast, then saw Aulvir Hnuf Solveig and courted her; he afterwards asked her to wife.  But the earl thought him an unequal match and would not give her.  Whereupon Aulvir composed many love-songs, and thought so much of Solveig that he left freebooting, but Thorolf and Eyvind Lambi kept it on.<BR>
