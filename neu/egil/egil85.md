CHAPTER LXXXIV.  
  

Of Thorstein Egil's son.  

  
        Thorstein Egil's son when he grew up was a most handsome man,
white-haired, bright-faced. Tall he was and strong, yet not so much so
as his father. Thorstein was wise, gentle, quite of temper, calm above
other men. Egil loved him little; nor was Thorstein affectionate with
his father; but Asgerdr and Thorstein loved each other dearly. Egil was
now beginning to age much.  
        One summer Thorstein rode to the Thing, but Egil sat at home.
Before Thorstein left home he and Asgerdr managed to take from Egil's
chest without his knowledge the silken robe given him by Arinbjorn, and
Thorstein took it to the Thing. But when he wore it at the Thing it
trailed behind him, and became soiled at the hem as they were going to
the hill of laws. And when he came home, Asgerdr put the robe in the
chest where it was before. Long after, when Egil opened his chest, he
found that the robe was spoilt, and questioned Asgerdr how that had come
about. She told him the truth. Then Egil sang:  
  
                                'Him who from me inherits  
                                I hold no worthy heir.  
                                A son deceives me living,  
                                Deceit I call his deed.  
                                Well might he, wave-horse-rider,  
                                Wait but awhile, till me  
                                Sea-skimming shipmen cover  
                                With shroud of piled stones.'  
  
        Thorstein married Jofridr, daughter of Gunnar son of Hlif: her
mother was Helga daughter of Olaf Feilan, sister of Thord Gellir.
Jofridr had before been wife of Thorod the son of Tongue-Odd.  
        Soon after this Asgerdr died. After her death Egil gave up his
housekeeping to Thorstein, and went south to Moss-fell to Grim, his
son-in-law, for he loved Thordis his step-daughter most of all who were
then living. One summer a ship came out and put into Loam Bay, steered
by a man named Thormod. He was a Norwegian, a house-carle of Thorstein
Thora's son. He was to take with him a shield, which Thorstein had sent
to Egil Skallagrimsson: it was a valuable treasure. Thormod brought Egil
the shield, and he received it with thanks. In the following winter Egil
composed a poem about the gift of the shield: it is called Buckler-poem,
and this is the beginning:  
  
                                'List to the stream of lay  
                                From long-haired Odin flowing,  
                                Thane of a king, and bid  
                                Thy folk due silence keep.  
                                For thee, sea-raven's ruler,  
                                Rained from the eagle's beak  
                                Full oft shall shower of song  
                                In Horda's shore be heard.'  
  
        Thorstein Egil's son dwelt at Borg. He had two illegitimate
sons, Hrifla and Hrafn. But after his marriage he and Jofridr had ten
children. Helga the fair was their daughter, she about whom quarrelled
Skald-Hrafn and Gunnlaug Wormstongue. Grim was their eldest son, the
second Skuli, the third Thorgeir, the fourth Kollsvein, the fifth
Hjorleif, the sixth Hall, the seventh Egil, the eighth Thord. The other
daughter was Thora, who was married to Thormod Kleppjarn's son. From
Thorstein's children sprang a large progeny, and many great men. They
are called Myra-men, all those that sprang from Skallagrim.
