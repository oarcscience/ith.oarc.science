CHAPTER LXXXI.  
  

Death of Bodvar: Egil's poem thereon.  
  

Bodvar Egil's son was just now growing up; he was a youth of great
promise, handsome, tall and strong as had been Egil or Thorolf at his
age. Egil loved him dearly, and Bodvar was very fond of his father. One
summer it happened that there was a ship in White-river, and a great
fair was held there. Egil had there bought much wood, which he was
having conveyed home by water: for this his house-carles went, taking
with them an eight-oared boat belonging to Egil. It chanced one time
that Bodvar begged to go with them, and they allowed him so to do. So he
went into the field with the house-carles. They were six in all on the
eight-oared boat. And when they had to go out again, high-water was late
in the day, and, as they must needs wait for the turn of tide, they did
not start till late in the evening. Then came on a violent south-west
gale, against which ran the stream of the ebb. This made a rough sea in
the firth, as can often happen. The end was that the boat sank under
them, and all were lost. The next day the bodies were cast up: Bodvar's
body came on shore at Einars-ness, but some came in on the south shore
of the firth, whither also the boat was driven, being found far in near
Reykjarhamar.  
Egil heard these tidings that same day, and at once rode to seek the
bodies: he found Bodvar's, took it up and set it on his knees, and rode
with it out to Digra-ness, to Skallagrim's mound. Then he had the mound
opened, and laid Bodvar down there by Skallagrim. After which the mound
was closed again; this task was not finished till about nightfall. Egil
then rode home to Borg, and, when he came home, he went at once to the
locked bed-closet in which he was wont to sleep. He lay down, and shut
himself in, none daring to crave speech of him.  
It is said that when they laid Bodvar in earth Egil was thus dressed:
his hose were tight-fitting to his legs, he wore a red kirtle of
fustian, closely-fitting, and laced at the sides: but they say that his
muscles so swelled with his exertion that the kirtle was rent off him,
as were also the hose.  
On the next day Egil still did not open the bed-closet: he had no meat
or drink: there he lay for that day and the following night, no man
daring to speak with him. But on the third morning, as soon as it was
light, Asgerdr had a man set on horseback, who rode as hard as he could
westwards to Hjardarholt, and told Thorgerdr all these tidings; it was
about nones when he got there. He said also that Asgerdr had sent her
word to come without delay southwards to Borg. Thorgerdr at once bade
them saddle her a horse, and two men attended her. They rode that
evening and through the night till they came to Borg. Thorgerdr went at
once into the hall. Asgerdr greeted her, and asked whether they had
eaten supper. Thorgerdr said aloud, 'No supper have I had, and none will
I have till I sup with Freyja. I can do no better than does my father: I
will not overlive my father and brother.' She then went to the
bed-closet and called, 'Father, open the door! I will that we both
travel the same road.' Egil undid the lock. Thorgerdr stepped up into
the bed-closet, and locked the door again, and lay down on another bed
that was there.  
Then said Egil, 'You do well, daughter, in that you will follow your
father. Great love have you shown to me. What hope is there that I shall
wish to live with this grief?' After this they were silent awhile. Then
Egil spoke: 'What is it now, daughter? You are chewing something, are
you not?' 'I am chewing samphire,' said she, 'because I think it will do
me harm. Otherwise I think I may live too long.' 'Is samphire bad for
man?' said Egil. 'Very bad,' said she; 'will you eat some?' 'Why should
I not?' said he. A little while after she called and bade them give her
drink. Water was brought to her. Then said Egil, 'This comes of eating
samphire, one ever thirsts the more.' 'Would you like a drink, father?'
said she. He took and swallowed the liquid in a deep draught: it was in
a horn. Then said Thorgerdr: 'Now are we deceived; this is milk.'
Whereat Egil bit a sherd out of the horn, all that his teeth gripped,
and cast the horn down.  
Then spoke Thorgerdr: 'What counsel shall we take now? This our purpose
is defeated. Now I would fain, father, that we should lengthen our
lives, so that you may compose a funeral poem on Bodvar, and I will
grave it on a wooden roller; after that we can die, if we like. Hardly,
I think, can Thorstein your son compose a poem on Bodvar; but it were
unseemly that he should not have funeral rites. Though I do not think
that we two shall sit at the drinking when the funeral feast is held.'
Egil said that it was not to be expected that he could now compose,
though he were to attempt it. 'However, I will try this,' said he.  
Egil had had another son named Gunnar, who had died a short time
before.  
So then Egil began the poem, and this is the beginning.  
  

SONA-TORREK (SONS' LOSS).  

  
                                                1.  
                                'Much doth it task me  
                                My tongue to move,  
                                Through my throat to utter  
                                The breath of song.  
                                Poesy, prize of Odin,  
                                Promise now I may not,  
                                A draught drawn not lightly  
                                From deep thought's dwelling.  
  
                                                2.  
                                'Forth it flows but hardly;  
                                For within my breast  
                                Heaving sobbing stifles  
                                Hindered stream of song—  
                                Blessèd boon to mortals  
                                Brought from Odin's kin,  
                                Goodly treasure, stolen  
                                From Giant-land of yore.  
  
                                                3.  
                                'He, who so blameless  
                                Bore him in life,  
                                O'erborne by billows  
                                With boat was whelmed.  
                                Sea-waves—flood that whilom  
                                Welled from giant's wound—  
                                Smite upon the grave-gate  
                                Of my sire and son.  
  
                                                4.  
                                'Dwindling now my kindred  
                                Draw near to their end,  
                                Ev'n as forest-saplings  
                                Felled or tempest-strown.  
                                Not gay or gladsome  
                                Goes he who beareth  
                                Body of kinsman  
                                On funeral bier.  
  
                                                5.  
                                'Of father fallen  
                                First I may tell;  
                                Of much-loved mother  
                                Must mourn the loss.  
                                Sad store hath memory  
                                For minstrel skill,  
                                A wood to bloom leafy  
                                With words of song.  
  
                                                6.  
                                'Most woful the breach,  
                                Where the wave in-brake  
                                On the fenced hold  
                                Of my father's kin.  
                                Unfilled, as I wot,  
                                And open doth stand  
                                The gap of son rent  
                                By the greedy surge.  
  
                                                7.  
                                'Me Ran, the sea-queen,  
                                Roughly hath shaken:  
                                I stand of beloved ones  
                                Stript and all bare.  
                                Cut hath the billow  
                                The cord of my kin,  
                                Strand of mine own twisting  
                                So stout and strong.  
  
                                                8.  
                                'Sure, if sword could venge  
                                Such cruel wrong,  
                                Evil times would wait  
                                Ægir, ocean-god.  
                                That wind-giant's brother  
                                Were I strong to slay,  
                                'Gainst him and his sea-brood  
                                Battling would I go.  
  
                                                9.  
                                'But I in no wise  
                                Boast, as I ween,  
                                Strength that may strive  
                                With the stout ships' Bane.  
                                For to eyes of all  
                                Easy now 'tis seen  
                                How the old man's lot  
                                Helpless is and lone.  
  
                                                10.  
                                'Me hath the main  
                                Of much bereaved;  
                                Dire is the tale,  
                                The deaths of kin:  
                                Since he the shelter  
                                And shield of my house  
                                Hied him from life  
                                To heaven's glad realm.  
  
                                                11.  
                                'Full surely I know,  
                                In my son was waxing  
                                The stuff and the strength  
                                Of a stout-limbed wight:  
                                Had he reached but ripeness  
                                To raise his shield,  
                                And Odin laid hand  
                                On his liegeman true.  
  
                                                12.  
                                'Willing he followed  
                                His father's word,  
                                Though all opposing  
                                Should thwart my rede:  
                                He in mine household  
                                Mine honour upheld,  
                                Of my power and rule  
                                The prop and the stay.  
  
                                                13.  
                                'Oft to my mind  
                                My loss doth come,  
                                How I brotherless bide  
                                Bereaved and lone.  
                                Thereon I bethink me,  
                                When thickens the fight  
                                Thereon with much searching  
                                My soul doth muse:  
  
                                                14.  
                                'Who staunch stands by me  
                                In stress of fight,  
                                Shoulder to shoulder,  
                                Side by side?  
                                Such want doth weaken  
                                In war's dread hour;  
                                Weak-winged I fly,  
                                Whom friends all fail.  
  
                                                15.  
                                'Son's place to his sire  
                                (Saith a proverb true)  
                                Another son born  
                                Alone can fill.  
                                Of kinsmen none  
                                (Though ne'er so kind)  
                                To brother can stand  
                                In brother's stead.  
  
                                                16.  
                                'O'er all our ice-fields,  
                                Our northern snows,  
                                Few now I find  
                                Faithful and true.  
                                Dark deeds men love,  
                                Doom death to their kin,  
                                A brother's body  
                                Barter for gold.  
  
                                                17.  
                                'Unpleasing to me  
                                Our people's mood,  
                                Each seeking his own  
                                In selfish peace.  
                                To the happier bees' home  
                                Hath passed my son,  
                                My good wife's child  
                                To his glorious kin.  
  
                                                18.  
                                'Odin, mighty monarch,  
                                Of minstrel mead the lord,  
                                On me a heavy hand  
                                Harmful doth lay.  
                                Gloomy in unrest  
                                Ever I grieve,  
                                Sinks my drooping brow,  
                                Seat of sight and thought.  
  
                                                19.  
                                'Fierce fire of sickness  
                                First from my home  
                                Swept off a son  
                                With savage blow:  
                                One who was heedful,  
                                Harmless, I wot,  
                                In deeds unblemished,  
                                In words unblamed.  
  
                                                20.  
                                'Still do I mind me,  
                                When the Friend of men  
                                High uplifted  
                                To the home of gods  
                                That sapling stout  
                                Of his father's stem,  
                                Of my true wife born  
                                A branch so fair.  
  
                                                21.  
                                'Once bare I goodwill  
                                To the great spear-lord,  
                                Him trusty and true  
                                I trowed for friend:  
                                Ere the giver of conquest,  
                                The car-borne god,  
                                Broke faith and friendship  
                                False in my need.  
  
                                                22.  
                                'Now victim and worship  
                                To Vilir's brother,  
                                The god once honoured,  
                                I give no more.  
                                Yet the friend of Mimir  
                                On me hath bestowed  
                                Some boot for bale,  
                                If all boons I tell.  
  
                                                23.  
                                'Yea he, the wolf-tamer,  
                                The war-god skilful,  
                                Gave poesy faultless  
                                To fill my soul:  
                                Gave wit to know well  
                                Each wily trickster,  
                                And force him to face me  
                                As foeman in fight.  
  
                                                24.  
                                'Hard am I beset;  
                                Whom Hela, the sister  
                                Of Odin's fell captive,  
                                On Digra-ness waits.  
                                Yet shall I gladly  
                                With right good welcome  
                                Dauntless in bearing  
                                Her death-blow bide.'  
  
        Egil began to cheer up as the composing of the poem went on; and
when the poem was complete, he brought it before Asgerdr and Thorgerdr
and his family. He rose from his bed, and took his place in the
high-seat. This poem he called 'Loss of Sons.' And now Egil had the
funeral feast of his son held after ancient custom. But when Thorgerdr
went home, Egil enriched her with good gifts.
