CHAPTER LXXIV.  
  

Journey to Vermaland.  

  
         Egil with three comrades made him ready for the journey. They
had horses and sledges, and so had the king's men. There was then deep
snow, and all the roads were effaced. They betook them to their journey
when they were ready, and sledged up the land; and when they came
eastwards near Eida, it happened one night that so much fresh snow fell
that they could not see the way. On the morrow they traveled slowly,
because there were snowdrifts directly one left the track. And as the
day wore on they stopped to bait their horses; this was near a wooded
ridge. Then spoke the king's men with Egil: 'Here now the roads divide;
forward below the ridge dwells a landowner named Arnold, our friend; we
with our party will go and lodge there. But you shall go yonder up the
ridge, and when you come over it you will soon have before you a large
house where you are sure of lodging. A wealthy man dwells there, Armod
Beard by name. But to-morrow early we will again join company and go on
the next evening to Eida-wood. There dwells a worthy landowner named
Thorfinn.'  
         Upon this they separated, Egil and his men going up the ridge.
But of the king's men this is to be told, that no sooner were they and
Egil out of sight of each other, than they took their snow-shoes (which
they had brought with them) and put them on; then they retraced their
way as fast as they could. Night and day they travelled, and turned
toward Upland, thence north by the Dovre-fell, nor stayed they till they
came before king Hacon, and told him of their journey, how it had
sped.  
         Egil and his comrades crossed the ridge that evening. To be
brief, so soon as they left the main road and got upon the ridge, they
found deep snow, steep rocks, tangled copsewood. Now and again in the
snow the horses so plunged and lay that they had to be pulled up out of
it, and over rocks and crags was a hard struggle. Much ado had they with
the horses; but the walking for the men was of the heaviest, and sorely
wearied were they when they came off the ridge and saw before them a
large house, for which they made.  
         And when they came to the enclosure, they saw men standing
outside, Armod and some of his household. They exchanged words and asked
each other's tidings, and when Armod knew that they were messengers of
the king, he offered them lodging. This they accepted. Armod's
house-carles took their horses and harness; but the master bade Egil go
into the hall, and they did so.  
        Armod made Egil sit in the high seat on the lower bench, and his
comrades outside him. They spoke much of what a toilsome way they had
come that evening, but the house-carles thought it a great marvel that
they had won through it at all; it was, they said, no road for man even
were it free of snow.  
        Then said Armod: 'Think ye not this were the best hospitality,
that a table should be set for you and supper given you now, and then
you should sleep? This will best rest you.'  
        'We should like this right well,' said Egil.  
        So Armod had a table set for them, whereon were placed large
bowls full of curds. Then said Armod that he was sorry he had no beer to
give them. Egil and his men were very thirsty from weariness; they took
up the bowls and drank the curds eagerly, Egil drinking far the most. No
other food was brought.  
        The household was numerous. The mistress sat on the cross-bench,
and beside her the other women. The master's daughter, ten or eleven
years old, was running about the hall-floor. The mistress called her to
her side, and spoke in her ear. Then the girl went out to where Egil
sat, and recited a verse:  
  
                                'To thee with this message  
                                My mother doth send me,  
                                To bear word that Egil  
                                Be wary and wait.  
                                "So temper thy stomach,"  
                                Thus sayeth our lady,  
                                "With fare far more worthy  
                                Soon feed we our guests."'  
  
        Armod struck the girl, and bade her hold her tongue: 'You are
always,' said he, 'saying what least suits.'  
        The girl went away; but Egil threw down the curd-bowl, which was
now nearly empty. The bowls were then removed from them.  
        And now the household took their seats, and tables were set all
round the hall, and food served; dishes of meat were brought in and set
before Egil and the rest. After this ale was borne in, beer of the
strongest. Soon they began to drink bumpers, each man was to drink off
the horn; and especial care was taken that Egil and his companions
should drink hard. Egil drank without shirking a drop for a long while,
but when his companions were become helpless, then he drank for them
what they could not. So matters went on till the tables were removed,
and by then all in the room were well drunk.  
        But before each cup that he drank Armod said: 'I drink to you,
Egil,' and the house-carles drank to Egil's companions with the same
preface. A man was appointed to bear every cup to Egil's party, and he
urged them to drink it off quick. Egil told his companions to drink no
more, but himself drank for them what they could not avoid.  
        Egil soon found that it would not do for him to go on so.
Wherefore he stood up, went across the floor to where Armod sat, took
him with his hands by the shoulders, and forced him back against the
inner posts, and spat in his face. There was an outcry and uproar, but
Egil went back to his place, sate him down, and bade them serve him
drink.  
        Armod leapt up and ran out; Egil continued to drink for a while,
as did some others in the hall; but there was little merriment. Soon
Egil and his men stood up, and took their weapons from the wall where
they had hung them up; they then went to the granary in which their
horse were, and laid themselves down in the straw, and slept through the
night.
