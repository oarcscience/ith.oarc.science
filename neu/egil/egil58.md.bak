CHAPTER LVII.  
  
*Suit between Egil and Onund.*  
  

        King Eric was there numerously attended. Bergonund was among his
train, as were his brothers; there was a large following. But when the
meeting was to be held about men's lawsuits, both the parties went where
the court was set, to plead their proofs. Then was Onund full of big
words. Now where the court sate was a level plot, with hazel-poles
planted in a ring, and outside were twisted ropes all around. This was
called, 'the precincts.' Within the ring sate twelve judges of the
Firth-folk, twelve of the Sogn-folk, twelve of the Horda-folk. These
three twelves were to judge all the suits. Arinbjorn ruled who should be
judges from the Firth-folk, Thord of Aurland who should be so from the
Sogn-folk. All these were of one party. Arinbjorn had brought thither a
long-ship full equipt, also many small craft and store-ships. King Eric
had six or seven long-ships all well equipt; a great number of
landowners were also there.  
        Egil began his cause thus: he craved the judges to give him
lawful judgement in the suit between him and Onund. He then set forth
what proofs he held of his claim on the property that had belonged to
Bjorn Brynjolf's son. He said that Asgerdr daughter of Bjorn, own wife
of him Egil, was rightful heiress, born noble, of landed gentry, even of
titled family further back. And he craved of the judges this, to adjudge
to Asgerdr half of Bjorn's inheritance, whether land or chattels.  
        And when he ceased speaking, then Bergonund took the word and
spoke thus: 'Gunnhilda my wife is the daughter of Bjorn and Alof, the
wife whom Bjorn lawfully married. Gunnhilda is rightful heiress of
Bjorn. I for this reason took possession of all the property left by
Bjorn, because I knew that that other daughter of Bjorn had no right to
inherit. Her mother was a captive of war, afterwards taken as concubine,
without her kinsmen's consent, and carried from land to land. But thou,
Egil, thinkest to go on here, as everywhere else, with thy fierceness
and wrongful dealing. This will not avail thee now; for king Eric and
queen Gunnhilda have promised me that I shall have right in every cause
within the bounds of their dominion. I will produce true evidence before
the king and the judges that Thora Lace-hand, Asgerdr's mother, was
taken captive from the house of Thorir her brother, and a second time
from Brynjolf's house at Aurland. Then she went away out of the land
with freebooters, and was outlawed from Norway, and in this outlawry
Bjorn and she had born to them this girl Asgerdr. A great wonder now is
this in Egil, that he thinks to make void all the words of king Eric.
First, Egil, thou art here in the land after Eric made thee an outlaw;
secondly—which is worse—though thou hast a bondwoman to thy wife, thou
claimest for her right of heritage. I demand this of the judges, that
they adjudge the inheritance to Gunnhilda, but adjudge Asgerdr to be the
bondwoman of the king, because she was begotten when her father and
mother were outlawed by the king.'  
        Right wroth was Arinbjorn when he heard Thora Lace-hand called a
bondwoman; and he stood up, and would no longer hold his peace, but
looked around on either side, and took the word:  
        'Evidence we will bring, sir king, in this matter, and oaths we
will add, that this was in the reconciliation of my father and Bjorn
Yeoman expressly provided, that Asgerdr daughter of Bjorn and Thora was
to have right of inheriting after Bjorn her father; as also this, which
thyself, O king, dost know, that thou restoredst Bjorn to his rights in
Norway, and so everything was settled which had before stood in the way
of their reconciliation.'  
        To these words the king found no ready answer. Then sang Egil a
stave:  
  
                                'Bondwoman born this knave  
                                My brooch-decked lady calls.  
                                Shameless in selfish greed  
                                Such dealing Onund loves:  
                                Braggart! my bride is one  
                                Born heiress, jewell'd dame.  
                                Our oaths, great king, accept,  
                                Oaths that are meet and true.'  
  
        Then Arinbjorn produced witnesses, twelve men, and all well
chosen. These all had heard, being present, the reconciliation of Thorir
and Bjorn, and they offered to the king and judges to swear to it. The
judges were willing to accept their oath if the king forbade it not.  
        Then did queen Gunnhilda take the word:  
        'Great wonder is this, sir king, that thou lettest this big Egil
make such a coil of the whole cause before thee. Wouldst thou find
nought to say against him, though he should claim at thy hand thy very
kingdom? Now though thou wilt give no decision that may help Onund, yet
will not I brook this, that Egil tread under foot our friends and
wrongfully take the property from Onund. Where is Alf my brother? Go
thou, Alf, with thy following, where the judges are, and let them not
give this wrong judgment.'  
        Then he and his men went thither, and cut in sunder the
precinct-ropes and tore down the poles, and scattered the judges. Great
uproar was there in the Thing; but men there were all weaponless.  
        Then spake Egil: 'Can Bergonund hear my words?'  
        'I hear,' said Onund.  
        'Then do I challenge thee to combat, and be our fight here at
the Thing. Let him of us twain have this property, both lands and
chattels, who wins the victory. But be thou every man's dastard if thou
darest not.'  
        Whereupon king Eric made answer: 'If thou, Egil, art strongly
set on fighting, then will we grant thee this forthwith.'  
        Egil replied: 'I will not fight with king's power and
overwhelming force; but before equal numbers I will not flee, if this be
given me. Nor will I then make any distinction of persons, titled or
untitled.'  
        Then spake Arinbjorn: 'Go we away, Egil; we shall not here
effect to-day anything that will be to our gain.'  
        And with this Arinbjorn and all his people turned to depart.  
        But Egil turned him and cried aloud: 'This do I protest before
thee, Arinbjorn, and thee, Thord, and all men that now can hear my word,
barons and lawmen and all people, that I ban all those lands that
belonged to Bjorn Brynjolfsson, from building and tillage, and from all
gain therefrom to be gotten. I ban them to thee, Bergonund, and to all
others, natives and foreigners, high and low; and anyone who shall
herein offend I denounce as a law-breaker, a peace breaker, and
accursed.'  
        After which Egil went away with Arinbjorn.  
        They then went to their ships; and there was a rise in the
ground of some extent to pass over, so that the ships were not visible
from the Thing-field. Egil was very wroth. And when they came to the
ships, Arinbjorn spoke before his people and said:  
        'All men know what has been the issue of the Thing here, that we
have not got law; but the king is much in wrath, so that I expect our
men will get hard measure from him if he can bring it about. I will now
that every man embark on his ship and go home. Let none wait for
other.'  
        Then Arinbjorn went on board his own ship, and to Egil he said:
'Now go you with your comrades on board the cutter that lies here
outside the long-ship, and get you away at once. Travel by night so much
as you may, and not by day, and be on your guard, for the king will seek
to meet with you. Come and find me afterwards, when all this is ended,
whatever may have chanced between you and the king.'  
        Egil did as Arinbjorn said; they went aboard the cutter, about
thirty men, and rowed with all their might. The vessel was remarkably
fast. Then rowed out of the haven many other ships of Arinbjorn's
people, cutters and row-boats; but the long-ship which Arinbjorn steered
went last, for it was the heaviest under oars. Egil's cutter, which he
steered, soon outstripped the rest. Then Egil sang a stave:  
  
                                'My heritage he steals,  
                                The money-grasping heir  
                                Of Thornfoot. But his threats,  
                                        Though fierce, I boldly meet.  
                                For land we sought the law:  
                                Land-grabbing loon is he!  
                                But robbery of my right  
                                        Ere long he shall repay.'
