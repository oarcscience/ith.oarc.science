CHAPTER LVI.  
  
*Marriage of Egil.*  
  

Bergonund son of Thorgeir Thornfoot had then married Gunnhilda daughter
of Bjorn Yeoman. She had come to keep house with him at Askr. But
Asgerdr, whom Thorolf Skallagrimsson had had to wife, was then with
Arinbjorn, her kinsman. Thorolf and she had a daughter named Thordis,
and the girl was there with her mother. Egil told Asgerdr of Thorolf's
death, and offered her his guardianship. Asgerdr was much grieved at the
tidings; she answered Egil's words well, saying however but little one
way or the other.  
But, at autumn wore on, Egil began to be very gloomy and drank little,
and often say with his head drooping in his cloak. One time Arinbjorn
went to him and asked what meant his gloom.  
        'Though now you have had a great loss in your brother, yet 'tis
manly to bear up well; man must overlive man. Come, what verse are you
now repeating? Let me hear.'  
        Egil said he had just made this verse:  
                                  
'Unfriendly, who was friend,  
                                Fair goddess seems. Of old  
                                Bold with uplifted brow  
                                Beheld I woman's face.  
                                Now one (whose name I veil)  
                                No sooner to the skald  
                                Occurs, than shyly sinks  
                                Screen'd in his cloak his head.'  
  
        Arinbjorn asked who was the woman about whom he composed such
love-song. 'Have you hidden her name in this stave?'  
        Then Egil recited:  
  
                                'Sorrow shows not, but hides  
                                The saddening thought within.  
                                Names in my poesy  
                                Not oft I use to veil.  
                                For Odin's warrior wights  
                                Will surely searching find  
                                In war-god's wine of song  
                                What poet deep hath plunged.'  
  
        'Here,' said Egil, 'will the old saw be found true. All should
be told to a friend. I will tell you that which you ask, about what
woman I compose verse. ''Tis Asgerdr your kinswoman; and I would fain
have your furtherance to secure this match.'  
        Arinbjorn said that he deemed it well thought of. 'I will,' said
he, 'surely give my good word that this match may be made.'  
        Then Egil laid this matter before Asgerdr, but she referred it
to the decision of her father and her kinsman Arinbjorn. Arinbjorn
talked with Asgerdr, and she made the same answer. Arinbjorn was
desirous of this match. After this Arinbjorn and Egil went together to
Bjorn, and then Egil made his suit and asked to wife Asgerdr Bjorn's
daughter. Bjorn took this matter well, and said that Arinbjorn should
chiefly decide this. Arinbjorn greatly desired it; and the end of the
matter was that Egil and Asgerdr were betrothed, and the wedding was to
be at Arinbjorn's.  
        And when the appointed time came, there was a very grand feast
at Egil's marriage. He was then very cheerful for the remaining part of
the winter. In the spring he made ready a merchant-ship for a voyage to
Iceland. Arinbjorn advised him not to settle in Norway while Gunnhilda's
power was so great. 'For she is very wroth with you,' said Arinbjorn;
'and this has been made much worse by your encounter with Eyvind near
Jutland.'  
        But when Egil was ready, and a fair wind blew, he sailed out to
sea, and his voyage sped well. He came in the autumn to Iceland, and
stood into Borgar-firth. He had now been out twelve winters. Skallagrim
was an old man by this time. Full glad was he when Egil came home. Egil
went to lodge at Borg, and with him Thofid Strong and many of their
company; and they were there with Skallagrim for the winter. Egil had
immense store of wealth; but it is not told that Egil shared that silver
which king Athelstan had given him either with Skallagrim or others.
That winter Thorfid married Sæunn, Skallagrim's daughter; and in the
following spring Skallagrim gave them a homestead at Long-river-foss,
and the land inwards from Leiru-brook between Long-river and Swan-river,
even up to the fell. Daughter of Thorfid and Sæunn was Thordis wife to
Arngeir in Holm, the son of Bersi Godless. Their son was Bjorn,
Hitadale's champion.  
        Egil abode there with Skallagrim several winters. He took upon
him the management of the property and farm no less than Skallagrim.
Egil became more and more bald. The country-side began now to be settled
far and wide. Hromund, brother of Grim the Halogalander, settled at this
time in Cross-river-lithe with his shipmates. Hromund was father of
Gunnlaug, the father of Thuridr Dylla, mother of Illugi the Swarthy.  
        Egil had now been several winters at Borg with his father, when
one summer a ship from Norway to Iceland with these tidings from the
east, that Bjorn Yeoman was dead. Further, it was told that all the
property owned by Bjorn had been taken up by Bergonund, his son-in-law,
who had moved to his own home all loose chattels, letting out the lands,
and securing to himself all the rents. He had also got possession of all
the farms occupied of late by Bjorn. This when Egil heard, he inquired
carefully whether Bjorn had acted on his own counsel in this matter, or
had the support of others more powerful. It was told him that Onund was
become a close friend of king Eric, but was on even more intimate terms
with Gunnhilda.  
        Egil let the matter rest for this autumn; but when winter was
past and spring came, then Egil bade them draw out his ship, which had
stood in the shed at Long-river-foss. This ship he made ready for sea,
and got a crew thereto. Asgerdr his wife was to go with him, but Thordis
Thorolf's daughter remained behind. Egil sailed out to sea when he was
ready, and of his voyage there is nothing to tell before he came to
Norway. He at once, as soon as he could, went to seek Arinbjorn.
Arinbjorn received him well, and asked Egil to stay with him; this offer
he took. So both he and Asgerdr went thither and several men with
them.  
        Egil very soon spoke with Arinbjorn about those claims on money
that he thought he had there in the land.  
        Arinbjorn said, 'That matter seems to me unpromising. Bergonund
is hard, ill to deal with, unjust, covetous; and he has now much support
from the king and the queen. Gunnhilda is your bitter enemy, as you know
already, and she will not desire Onund to put the case right.'  
        Egil said, 'The king will let us get law and justice in this
matter, and with your help it seems no great thing in my eyes to take
the law of Bergonund.'  
        They resolved on this, that Egil should equip a swift cutter,
whereon they embarked some twenty men, and went south to Hordaland and
on to Askr. There they go to the house and find Onund. Egil declares his
business, and demands of Onund s sharing of the heritage of Bjorn. He
says that Bjorn's daughters were by law both alike his heirs, 'Though
methinks,' says Egil, 'Asgerdr will be deemed more nobly born than your
wife Gunnhilda.'  
        Then says Onund in high-pitched voice, 'A wondrous bold man are
you, Egil, the outlaw of king Eric, who come hither to his land and
think here to attack his men and friends. You are to know, Egil, that I
have overthrown men as good as you for less cause than methinks this is,
when you claim heritage in right of your wife; for this is well known to
all, that she is born of a bondwoman.'  
        Onund was furious in language for a time; but when Egil saw that
Onund would do no right in this matter, then he summoned him to court,
and referred the matter to the law of the Gula-thing.  
        Onund said, 'To the Gula-thing I will come, and my will is that
you should not come away thence with a whole skin.'  
        Egil said he would risk coming to the Thing all the same: 'There
let come what come may to end our matter.'  
        Egil then went away with his company, and when he came home told
Arinbjorn of his journey and of Onund's answer. Arinbjorn was very angry
that Thora his father's sister had been called a bondwoman. Arinbjorn
went to king Eric, and declared this matter before him.'  
        The king took his words rather sullenly, and said that Arinbjorn
had long advocated Egil's cause: 'He has had this grace through thee,
that I have let him be here in the land; but now shall I think it too
much to bear if thou back him in his assaults on my friends.'  
        Arinbjorn said, 'Thou wilt let us get law in this case.'  
        The king was rather peevish in this talk, but Arinbjorn could
see that the queen was much worse-willed.  
        Arinbjorn went back and said that things looked rather
unpromising. Then winter wore away, and the time came when men should go
to the Gula-thing. Arinbjorn took to the Thing a numerous company, among
them went Egil.
