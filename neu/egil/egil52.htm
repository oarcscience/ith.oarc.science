<CENTER>CHAPTER LI.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Of Olaf king of Scots.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>Olaf the Red was the name of the king in Scotland.  He was Scotch on his father's side, but Danish on his mother's side, and came of the family of Ragnar Hairy-breeks.  He was a powerful prince.  Scotland, as compared with England, was reckoned a third of the realm; Northumberland was reckoned a fifth part of England; it was the northernmost county, marching with Scotland on the eastern side of the island.  Formerly the Danish kings had held it.  Its chief town is York.  It was in Athelstan's dominions; he had set over it two earls, the one named Alfgeir, the other Gudrek.  They were set there as defenders of the land against the inroads of Scots, Danes, and Norsemen, who harried the land much, and though they had a strong claim on the land there, because in Northumberland nearly all the inhabitants were Danish by the father's or mother's side, and many by both.<BR>
Bretland was governed by two brothers, Hring and Adils; they were tributaries under king Athelstan, and withal had this right, that when they were with the king in the field, they and their force should be in the van of the battle before the royal standard.  These brothers were right good warriors, but not young men.<BR>
Alfred the Great had deprived all tributary kings of name and power; they were now called earls, who had before been kings or princes.  This was maintained throughout his lifetime and his son Edward's.  But Athelstan came young to the kingdom, and of him they stood less in awe.  Wherefore many now were disloyal who had before been faithful subjects.<BR>
