CHAPTER XLII.  
  
*Thorolf asks Asgerdr to wife.*  
  

        Thorolf Skallagrim's son now sounded Thorir as to how he would
take the matter should Thorolf ask in marriage Asgerdr his kinswoman.
Thorir welcomed this readily, saying that he would be his pleader in
this suit. Soon after Thorolf went north to Sogn with a goodly company.
He came to Bjorn's house, and was well received there. Bjorn bade him be
with him as long as he would. Thorolf speedily opened to Bjorn his
errand, and made his offer, asking Bjorn's daughter Asgerdr to wife.
This proposal Bjorn took well, his consent was easily won; and it was
settled that the betrothal should be there, and a day was fixed for the
wedding. The feast was to be at Bjorn's in the autumn.  
        Then Thorolf went back to Thorir, and told him what had been
done in his journey. Thorir was glad that the match was to be made. But
when the time came that Thorolf should go to the feast, he bade men to
go with him. First bade he Thorir and Arinbjorn and their house-carles,
and some rich yeoman; and for the journey there was a large and goodly
company.  
        But when the appointed day was near at hand that Thorolf should
leave home, and the bridesmen were now come, then Egil fell sick, so
that he could not go. Thorolf and his company had a large long-ship well
equipt, and went on their way as had been agreed.
