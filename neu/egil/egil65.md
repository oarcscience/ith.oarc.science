CHAPTER LXIV.  
  
*Egil's life is given him.*  
  

King Eric sate upright while Egil recited the poem, and looked keenly at
him. And when the song of praise was ended, then spake the king: 'Right
well was the poem recited; and now, Arinbjorn, I have resolved about the
cause between me and Egil, how it shall go. Thou hast pleaded Egil's
cause with great eagerness, since thou offerest to risk a conflict with
me. Now shall I for thy sake do what thou hast asked, letting Egil go
from my land safe and unhurt. But thou, Egil, so order thy going that,
after leaving my presence and this hall, thou never come before my eyes,
nor my sons' eyes, nor be ever in the way of myself or my people. But I
give thee now thy head this time for this reason, that thou camest
freely into my power. I will do no dastardly deed on thee; yet know thou
this for sure, that this is no reconciliation with me or my sons or any
of our kin who wish to wreak their vengeance.'  
Then sang Egil:  
  
                                'Loth am I in nowise,  
                                Though in features loathly,  
                                Helm-capt head in pardon  
                                From high king to take.  
                                Who can boast that ever  
                                Better gift he won him,  
                                From a lordly sovereign's  
                                Noble-minded son?'  
  
        Arinbjorn thanked the king with many fair words for the honour
and friendship that he had shown him. Then they two, Arinbjorn and Egil,
went back to Arinbjorn's house. After that Arinbjorn bade horses be made
ready for his people. He rode away with Egil, and a hundred fully armed
men with him. Arinbjorn rode with that force till they came to king
Athelstan, where they were well received. The king asked Egil to remain
with him, and inquired how it had gone between him and king Eric.
Whereupon Egil sang:  
  
                                'Egil his eyes black-browed  
                                From Eric, raven's friend,  
                                Welcomed. Wise help therein  
                                        Wife's loyal kin lent.  
                                My head, throne of helmet,  
                                An heritage noble,  
                                As erst, from rough rainstorm  
                                        To rescue I knew.'  
  
        But at the parting of Arinbjorn and Egil, Egil gave Arinbjorn
those two gold rings that king Athelstan had given him, whereof each
weighed a mark. And Arinbjorn gave Egil the sword called Dragvandill.
This had been given to Arinbjorn by Thorolf Skallagrimsson; but before
that Skallagrim had received it from Thorolf his brother; but to Thorolf
the sword was given by Grim Shaggy-skin, son of Kettle Hæing. Kettle
Hæing had owned the sword and used it in his single combats, and no
sword was there more biting. Egil and Arinbjorn parted with much
affection. Arinbjorn went home to king Eric at York; but Egil's comrades
and shipmates had good peace there, and disposed of their cargo under
Arinbjorn's protection. But as winter wore on they moved south to
England and joined Egil.
