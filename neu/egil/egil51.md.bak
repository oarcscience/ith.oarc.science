CHAPTER L.  
  
*Of Athelstan king of the English.*  
  

Alfred the Great ruled England, being of his family the first supreme
king over England. That was in the days of Harold Fairhair, king of
Norway. After Alfred, Edward his son was king in England. He was father
of Athelstan the Victorious, who was foster-father of Hacon the Good. It
was at this time of our story that Athelstan took the kingdom after his
father. There were several brothers sons of Edward.  
But when Athelstan had taken the kingdom, then those chieftains who had
before lost their power to his forefathers rose in rebellion; now they
thought was the easiest time to claim back their own, when a young king
ruled the realm. These were Britons, Scots, and Irish. King Athelstan
therefore gathered him an army, and gave pay to all such as wished to
enrich themselves, both foreigners and natives.  
The brothers Thorolf and Egil were standing southwards along Saxony and
Flanders, when they heard that the king of England wanted men, and that
there was in his service hope of much gain. So they resolved to take
their force thither. And they went on that autumn till they came to king
Athelstan. He received them well; he saw plainly that such followers
would be a great help. Full soon did the English king decide to ask them
to join him, to take pay there, and become defenders of his land. They
so agreed between them that they became king Athelstan's men.  
England was thoroughly Christian in faith, and had long been so, when
these things happened. King Athelstan was a good Christian; he was
called Athelstan the Faithful. The king asked Thorolf and his brother to
consent to take the first signing with the cross, for this was then a
common custom both with merchants and those who took soldiers' pay in
Christian armies, since those who were 'prime-signed' (as 'twas termed)
could hold all intercourse with Christians and heathens alike, while
retaining the faith which was most to their mind. Thorolf and Egil did
this at the king's request, and both let themselves be prime-signed.
They had three hundred men with them who took the king's pay.
