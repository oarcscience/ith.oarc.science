CHAPTER XVIII.  
  
*Thorolf's ship is taken.*  
  

There were two brothers named Sigtrygg Swiftfarer and Hallvard
Hardfarer, kinsmen of king Harold on the mother's side; from their
father, a wealthy man, they had inherited an estate in Hising. Four
brothers there were in all; but Thord and Thorgeir, the two younger,
were at home, and managed the estate. Sigtrygg and Hallvard carried all
the king's messages, both within and without the land, and had gone on
many dangerous journeys, both for putting men out of the way and
confiscating the goods of those whose homes the king ordered to be
attacked. They kept about them a large following; they were not
generally in favour, but the king prized them highly. None could match
them at travelling, either on foot or on snow-shoes; in voyaging also
they were speedier than others—valiant men they were, and very wary.  
These two men were with the king when those things happened that have
just been told. In the autumn the king went to a banquet in Hordaland.
And one day he summoned to him the brothers Hallvard and Sigtrygg, and
when they came he bade them go with their following and spy after the
ship which Thorgils had taken westward to England in the summer.  
'Bring me,' said he, 'the ship and all that is in it, except the men;
let them go their way in peace, if they do not try to defend the
ship.'  
The brothers made them ready for this, and, taking each one his
long-ship, went to seek Thorgils, and learnt that he was come from the
west, and had sailed northwards along the coast. Northwards after him
went they, and found him in Fir Sound. They knew the ship at once, and
laid one of their ships on the seaward side of her, while some of them
landed, and thence went out on to the ship by the gangways. Thorgils'
crew, apprehending no danger, made no defence; they found out nothing
till many armed men were aboard, and so they were all seized, and
afterwards put on shore weaponless, with nothing but the clothes they
wore. But Hallvard's men drew out the gangways, loosed the cables, and
towed out the ship; then turned them about, and sailed southwards along
the coast till they met the king, to whom they brought the ship and all
that was in it. And when the cargo was unloaded, the king saw that it
was great wealth, and what Harek had said was no lie.  
But Thorgils and his comrades got conveyance, and went to Kveldulf and
his son, and told of the misadventure of their voyage, yet were they
well received. Kveldulf said all was tending to what he had foreboded,
that Thorolf would not in the end have good luck in his friendship with
king Harold.  
'And I care little,' said he, 'for Thorolf's money loss in this, if
worse does not come after; but I misdoubt, as before, that Thorolf will
not rightly rate his own means against the stronger power with which he
has to deal.'  
And he bade Thorgils say this to Thorolf:  
'My counsel is that you go away out of the land, for maybe you will do
better for yourself if you serve under the king of England, or of
Denmark, or of Sweden.'  
Then he gave Thorgils a rowing-cutter with tackling complete, a tent
also, and provisions, and all things needful for their journey. So they
departed, and stayed not their journey till they came to Thorolf and
told him all that had happened.  
Thorolf took his loss cheerfully, and said that he should not be short
of money; ''tis good,' said he, 'to be in partnership with a king.' He
then bought meal and all that he needed for the maintenance of his
people; his house-carles must for awhile, he said, be less bravely
attired than he had purposed. Some lands he sold, some he mortgaged, but
he kept up all expenses as before; he had no fewer men with him than
last winter, nay, rather more. And as to feasts and friends entertained
at his house, he had more means for all this than before. He stayed at
home all that winter.
