CHAPTER XXIII.  
  
*The slaying of Hildirida's sons.*  
  

There was a man named Kettle Hæing, son of Thorkel earl of Naumdale, and
of Hrafnilda daughter of Kettle Hæing of Hrafnista. He was a man of
wealth and renown; he had been a fast friend of Thorolf Kveldulf's son,
and was his near kinsman. He had been out on that expedition when forces
gathered in Halogaland with intent to join Thorolf, as has been written
above. But when king Harold went south, and men knew of Thorolf's
slaying, then they called a gathering.  
Hæing took with him sixty men, and turned to Torgar. Hildirida's sons
were there, and few men with them. He went up to the farm, and made an
attack on them; and there fell Hildirida's sons, and most of those who
were there; and Hæing and his company took all the wealth they could lay
hands on. After that Hæing took two ships of burden, the largest he
could get, and put on board all the wealth belonging to him that he
could carry; his wife and children also he took, and all the men that
had been with him in the late work. And when they were ready and the
wind blew fair, they sailed out to sea. A man named Baug, Hæing's
foster-brother, of good family and wealthy, steered the second ship.  
A few winters before Ingjolf and Hjorleif had gone to settle in Iceland;
their voyage was much talked about, and 'twas said there was good choice
of land there. So Hæing sailed west over the sea to seek Iceland. And
when they saw land, they were approaching it from the south. But because
the wind was boisterous, and the surf ran high on the shore, and there
was no haven, they sailed on westwards along the sandy coast. And when
the wind began to abate, and the surf to calm down, there before them
was a wide river-mouth. Up this river they steered their ships, and lay
close to the eastern shore thereof. That river is now called
Thjors-river; its stream was then much narrower and deeper that it is
now. They unloaded their ships, then searched the land eastward of the
river, bringing their cattle after them. Hæing remained for the first
winter on the eastern bank of the outer Rang-river.  
But in the spring he searched the land eastwards, and then took land
between Thjors-river and Mark-fleet, from fell to firth, and made his
home at Hofi by east Rang-river. Ingunn his wife bare a son in this
spring after their first winter, and the boy was named Hrafn. And though
the house there was pulled down, the place continued to be called
Hrafn-toft.  
Hæing gave Baug land in Fleet-lithe, down from Mark-river to the river
outside Breidabolstead; and he dwelt at Lithe-end. To his shipmates
Hæing gave land or sold it for a small price, and these first settlers
are called land-takers. Hæing had sons Storolf, Herjolf, Helgi, Vestar;
they all had land. Hrafn was Hæing's fifth son. He was the first law-man
in Iceland; he dwelt at Hofi after his father, and was the most renowned
of Hæing's sons.
