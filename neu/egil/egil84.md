CHAPTER LXXXIII.  
  

Of Einar Helgi's son and Egil.  

  
        There was a man named Einar. He was the son of Helgi, the son of
Ottar, the song of Bjorn Easterling, who took land in Broad-firth. Einar
was brother of Osvif the seer. Einar at an early age was tall and
strong, and most doughty. He began to compose poetry when quite young,
and was eager for learning. One summer at the Thing Einar went to the
booth of Egil Skallagrimsson, and they began to talk, and soon their
talk took this turn that they spoke of poetry. In this converse both of
them found pleasure. After this Einar often went to talk with Egil, and
a great friendship was struck up between them.  
        Einar had not long returned to Iceland from foreign travel. Egil
asked Einar much of tidings from the east, and about his friends, and
withal about those that he deemed his enemies. He asked also much about
men of rank. Einar in turn asked Egil about the events that had happened
in his travels, and about his exploits. This talk pleased Egil, and was
kept up briskly. Einar asked Egil on what occasion his prowess had been
most hardly tried; this he begged him to say. Egil then sang:  
  
                                'One with eight I battled,  
                                Eleven faced I twice,  
                                Made for wolf a meal,  
                                Myself the bane of all.  
                                Shields shook by sword-strokes  
                                Smitten fast and furious;  
                                Angry fire forth-flashing  
                                Flew my ashen spear.'  
  
        Egil and Einar pledged them to friendship on parting. Einar was
long abroad from Iceland with men of rank. Einar was open-handed, and
often short of money, but noble-hearted and manly. He was in the
body-guard of earl Hacon Sigurd's son. At that time there was in Norway
much war, the battles between earl Hacon and Eric's sons; and now one,
now the other, was driven from the land. King Harold, Eric's son, fell
south in Denmark, at Hals in Lima-firth; this was by treachery. He was
then fighting with Harold Knut's son, who was called Gold-Harold, and
earl Hacon was there. There fell also with king Harold lord Arinbjorn,
of whom much has already been told. And when Egil heard of the fall of
Arinbjorn, then he sang:  
  
                                'Mead-givers, glorious men,  
                                Gold-spending warrior wights  
                                Are spent and gone. Where seek  
                                Such lavish donors now?  
                                Erewhile, beyond the sea,  
                                Earth's islet-studded belt,  
                                Such on my high hawk-perch  
                                Hailed down the silver shower.'  
  
        Einar Helgi's son the poet was nicknamed Skala-glam. He composed
a poem about earl Hacon, which is called 'Dearth of Gold'; and for a
long time the earl would not hear the poem because he was wroth with
Einar. Then Einar sang:  
  
                                'Song made I on a chief  
                                Supreme o'er land enthroned;  
                                While others slept, I wrought,  
                                Whereof I much repent.  
                                Hither the earl to seek  
                                Eager I came, nor thought  
                                From brave free-handed prince  
                                Far-comers worse would fare.'  
  
        And further he sang:  
  
                                'Seek we that earl whose sword  
                                Spreads banquet for the wolf:  
                                To Sigvald's ship well-oared,  
                                Shield-fenced, my sword I lend.  
                                Wielder of wound-snake, he  
                                Will not my succour scorn:  
                                I to his sea-borne barque  
                                My buckler now will bear.'  
  
        The earl did not wish Einar to go away; so he granted a hearing
to the poem, and thereafter gave Einar a shield, which was a most costly
work. It was inscribed with old tales; and between the writing were
overlaid spangles of gold with precious stones set therein. Einar went
to Iceland and lodged with his brother Osvif: but in autumn he rode east
and came to Borg, and was guest there. Egil was just then not at home,
having gone to the northern part of the district, but was expected home.
Einar waited for him three nights: longer than three nights it was not
the custom to stay on a friendly visit. Then Einar made him ready to go;
but when ready he went to Egil's place in the hall, and there he hung up
that precious shield, and told the house-carles that he left it a gift
for Egil. Then he rode away.  
        But on that same day Egil came home. And when he came in to his
place, then he saw the shield, and asked whose was that costly work. It
was told him that Einar Skala-glam had come there, and had left the
shield as a gift for him. Then said Egil: 'The wretched man, to give it!
He means that I should bide awake and compose poetry about his shield.
Now, bring my horse. I must ride after him and slay him.' He was told
that Einar had ridden away early in the morning. 'He will,' they said,
'by this be come westwards to the dales.' Soon after Egil composed a
poem, whereof this is the beginning:  
  
                                'Of shield, the ship's bright guard,  
                                To show the praise ''tis time,  
                                Home to my hand is given  
                                The treasure-sender's gift.  
                                Sure hath Skala-glam  
                                To skilful guidance lent  
                                (Speak, ye who list my lay)  
                                The reins of minstrel lore.'  
  
        Egil and Einar remained friends so long as they both lived. But
about the shield's fortune at last this is told, that Egil took it with
him to the wedding when he went north to Broadmoor with Thorkettle
Gunnvald's son and Red-Bjorn's sons Trefill and Helgi. There the shield
was spoilt by falling into a tub of sour whey. After this Egil had the
outer ornaments taken off: and there were twelve ounces of gold in the
spangles.
