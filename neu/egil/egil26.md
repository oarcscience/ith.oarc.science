CHAPTER XXV.  
  
*Skallagrim's journey to the king.*  
  

Skallagrim made him ready for this journey, choosing out of his
household and neighbours the strongest and doughtiest that were to be
found. One was Ani, a wealthy landowner, another Grani, a third Grimolf
and his brother Grim, house-carles these of Skallagrim, and the two
brothers Thorbjorn Krum and Thord Beigaldi. These were called Thororna's
sons; she dwelt hard by Skallagrim, and was of magic skill. Beigaldi was
a coal-biter. There was a man named Thorir Giant, and his brother
Thorgeir Earthlong, Odd Lonedweller, and Griss Freedman. Twelve there
were for the journey, all stalwart men, and several of them
shape-strong.  
        They took a rowing-ship of Skallagrim's, went southwards along
the coast, stood in to Ostra Firth, then travelled by land up to Vors to
the lake there; and, their course lying so that they must cross it, they
got a suitable rowing-ship and ferried them over, whence they had not
very far to go to the farm where the king was being entertained.  
        They came there at the time when the king was gone to table.
Some men they found to speak with outside in the yard, and asked what
was going on. This being told them, Grim begged one to call Aulvir Hnuf
to speak with him. The man went into the room and up to where Aulvir
sat, and said: 'There be men here outside newly come, twelve together,
if men one may call them, for they are liker to giants in stature and
semblance than to mortal men.'  
        Aulvir at once rose and went out, for he knew who they were who
had come. He greeted well his kinsman Grim, and bade him go with him
into the room.  
        Grim said to his comrades: ''Tis the custom here that men go
weaponless before the king; six of us shall go in, the other six shall
bide without and keep our weapons.'  
        Then they entered, and Aulvir went up to the king, Skallagrim
standing at his back. Aulvir was spokesman: 'Here now is come Grim
Kveldulf's son; we shall feel thankful to thee, O king, if thou make his
journey hither a good one, as we hope it will be. Many get great honour
from thee to whom less is due, and who are not nearly so accomplished as
is he in every kind of skill. Thou wilt also do this because it is a
matter of moment to me, if that is of any worth in thy opinion.'  
        Aulvir spoke fully and fluently, for he was a man ready of
words. And many other friends of Aulvir went before the king and pleaded
this cause.  
        The king looked round, and saw that a man stood at Aulvir's back
taller than the others by a head, and bald.  
        'Is that Skallagrim,' asked the king, 'that tall man?'  
        Grim said he guessed rightly.  
        'I will then,' said the king, 'if thou cravest atonement for
Thorolf, that thou become my liege-man, and enter my guard here and
serve me. Maybe I shall so like thy service that I shall grant thee
atonement for thy brother, or other honour not less than I granted him;
but thou must know how to keep it better than he did, if I make thee as
great a man as was he.'  
        Skallagrim answered: 'It is well known how far superior to me
was Thorolf in every point, and he got no luck by serving thee, O king.
Now will I not take that counsel; serve thee I will not, for I know I
should get no luck by yielding thee such service as I should wish and as
would be worthy. Methinks I should fail herein more than Thorolf.'  
        The king was silent, and his face became blood-red. Aulvir at
once turned away, and bade Grim and his men go out. They did so. They
went out, and took their weapons, and Aulvir bade them begone with all
haste. He and many with him escorted them to the water-side. Before
parting with Skallagrim, Aulvir said:  
        'Kinsman, thy journey to the king ended otherwise than I would
have chosen. I urged much thy coming hither; now, I entreat thee, go
home with all speed, and come not in the way of king Harold, unless
there be better agreement between you than now seems likely, and keep
thee well from the king and from his men.'  
        Then Grim and his company went over the water; but Aulvir with
his men, going to the ships drawn up by the water-side, so hacked them
about that none was fit to launch. For they saw men coming down from the
king's house, a large body well armed and advancing furiously. These men
king Harold had sent after them to slay Grim. The king had found words
soon after Grim went out, and said:  
        'This I see in that tall baldhead: that he is brim full of
wolfishness, and he will, if he can reach them, work scathe on men whom
we should be loth to lose. Ye may be sure, ye against whom he may bear a
grudge, that he will spare none, if he get a chance. Wherefore go after
him and slay him.'  
        Upon this they went and came to the water, and saw no ship there
fit to launch. So they went back and told the king of their journey, and
that Grim and his comrades would now have got clear over the lake.  
        Skallagrim went his way with his comrades till he reached home;
he then told Kveldulf of this journey. Kveldulf showed him well pleased
that Skallagrim had not gone to the king on this errand to take service
under him; he still said, as before, that from the king they would get
only loss and no amends. Kveldulf and Skallagrim spoke often of their
plans, and on this they were agreed, that they would not be able to
remain in the land any more than other men who were at enmity with the
king, but their counsel must be to go abroad. And it seemed to them
desirable to seek Iceland, for good reports were given about choice of
land there. Already friends and acquaintances of theirs had gone
thither—to wit, Ingolf Arnarson, and his companions—and had taken to
them land and homestead in Iceland. Men might take land there free of
cost, and choose their homestead at will.  
        So they quite settled to break up their household and go
abroad.  
        Thorir Hroaldson had in his childhood been fostered with
Kveldulf, and he and Skallagrim were about of an age, and as
foster-brothers were dear friends. Thorir had become a baron of the
king's at the time when the events just told happened, but the
friendship between him and Skallagrim continued.  
        Early in the spring Kveldulf and his company made ready their
ships. They had plenty of good craft to choose from; they made ready two
large ships of burden, and took in each thirty able-bodied men, besides
women and children. All the movable goods that they could carry they
took with them, but their lands none dared buy, for fear of the king's
power. And when they were ready, they sailed away: first to the islands
called Solundir, which are many and large, and so scored with bays that
few men (it is said) know all their havens.
