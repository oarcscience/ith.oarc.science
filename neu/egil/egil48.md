CHAPTER XLVII.  
  
*Of the further harrying of Thorolf and Egil.*  
  

        Harold Gormsson had then taken the kingdom in Denmark, his
father Gorm being now dead. The land was then open to harrying;
freebooters often lay off the Danish coast. Aki knew Denmark well both
by sea and land. So Egil inquired of him diligently where the places
were that promised good booty. But when they came to Eyrar-sound, then
Aki said that up on land there was a large trading town named Lundr;
there, he said, was hope of plunder, but 'twas likely that the townsmen
would make resistance.  
The question was put before the men whether they should go up or not.
Opinions were much divided, some liking, some letting it; then the
matter was referred to the leaders. Thorolf was rather for going up.
Then Egil was asked what counsel he thought good. He recited a stave:  
  
                        'Wolf-battening warrior,  
                        Wield we high gleaming swords.  
                        In snake-fostering summer  
                        Such deeds well beseem.  
                        Lead up to Lundr:  
                        Let laggards be none!  
                        Spear-music ungentle  
                        By sunset shall sound.'  
  
After that they made them ready to go up, and they came to the town. But
when the townsmen were aware of the enemy's coming, they made against
them. A wooden wall was round the town; they set men to guard this. A
very fierce battle was there fought. Egil, with his following, charged
fiercely on the gate nor spared himself. There was a great slaughter,
the townsmen falling one upon another. It is said that Egil first
entered the town, the others following. Then those of the town fled, and
great was the slaughter. But Thorolf and his company plundered the town
and took much wealth, and fired the buildings before they left. Then
they went down to their ships.
