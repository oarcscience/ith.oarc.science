CHAPTER XLIV.  
  
*The slaying of Bard.*  
  

        King Eric and queen Gunnhilda came that same evening to
Atla-isle, and Bard had prepared there a banquet for the king; and there
was to be there a sacrifice to the guardian spirits. Sumptuous was the
banquet, and great the drinking within the hall.  
        'Where is Bard?' asked the king; 'I see him not.'  
        Someone said: 'Bard is outside supplying his guests.'  
        'Who be these guests,' said the king, 'that he deemeth this more
a duty than to be here within waiting on us?'  
        The man said that some house-carles of lord Thorir were come
thither.  
        The king said: 'Go after them at once, and call them in
hither.'  
        And so it was done, with the message that the king would fain
see them.  
        Whereupon they came. The king received Aulvir well, and bade him
sit in the high-seat facing himself, and his comrades outside him. They
did so, Egil sitting next to Aulvir. Ale was then served to them to
drink. Many toasts went round, and a horn should be drunk to each
toast.  
        But as the evening wore on, many of Aulvir's companions became
helpless. Some remained in the room, though sick, some went out of
doors. Bard busily plied them with drink. Then Egil took the horn which
Bard had offered to Aulvir, and drank it off. Bard said that Egil was
very thirsty, and brought him at once the horn again filled, and bade
him drink it off. Egil took the horn, and recited a stave:  
                                  
                                'Wizard-worshipper of cairns!  
                                Want of ale thou couldst allege,  
                                Here at spirits' holy feast.  
                                False deceiver thee I find.  
                                Stranger guests thou didst beguile,  
                                Cloaking thus thy churlish greed.  
                                Bard, a niggard base art thou,  
                                Treacherous trick on such to play.'  
  
        Bard bade him drink and stop that jeering. Egil drained every
cup that came to him, drinking for Aulvir likewise. Then Bard went to
the queen and told her there was a man there who put shame on them, for,
howsoever much he drank, he still said he was thirsty. The queen and
Bard then mixed the drink with poison, and bare it in. Bard consecrated
the cup, then gave it to the ale-maid. She carried it to Egil, and bade
him drink. Egil then drew his knife and pricked the palm of his hand. He
took the horn, scratched runes thereon, and smeared blood in them. He
sang:  
  
                                'Write we runes around the horn,  
                                Redden all the spell with blood;  
                                Wise words choose I for the cup  
                                Wrought from branching horn of beast.  
                                Drink we then, as drink we will,  
                                Draught that cheerful bearer brings,  
                                Learn that health abides in ale,  
                                Holy ale that Bard hath bless'd.'  
  
        The horn burst asunder in the midst, and the drink was spilt on
the straw below. Then Aulvir began to be faint. So Egil stood up, took
Aulvir by the hand, and led him to the door. Egil shifted his cloak to
his left side, and under the mantle held his sword. But when they came
to the door, then came Bard after them with a full horn, and bade them
drink a farewell cup. Egil stood in the door. He took the horn and drank
it off; then recited a stave:  
  
                                'Ale is borne to me, for ale  
                                Aulvir now maketh pale.  
                                From ox-horn I let pour  
                                'Twixt my lips the shower.  
                                But blind they fate to see  
                                Blows thou bring'st on thee:  
                                Full soon from Odin's thane  
                                Feel'st thou deadly rain.'  
  
        With that Egil threw down the horn, but gripped his sword and
drew; it was dark in the room. He thrust Bard right through the middle
with the sword, so that the point went out at the back. Bard fell dead,
the blood welling from the wound. Aulvir fell too, vomiting. Then Egil
dashed out of the room; it was pitch dark outside. Egil at once ran off
from the buildings. But in the entrance-room it was now seen that Bard
and Aulvir were fallen.  
        Then came the king, and bade them bring light; whereupon they
saw what had happened, that Aulvir lay there senseless; but Bard was
slain, and the floor all streaming with blood. Then the king asked where
was that big man who had drunk most that evening. Men said that he had
gone out.  
        'Seek him,' said the king, 'and bring him to me.'  
        Search was made for him round the premises, but nowhere was he
found. But when they came to the detached fire-hall, there lay Aulvir's
comrades. The king's men asked if Egil had come there at all. They said
that he had run in, taken his weapons, and so out again.  
        This was told to the king. The king bade his men go with all
speed and seize every ship or boat on the island.  
        'But in the morning,' said he, 'when it is light, we must search
all the island and slay the man.'
