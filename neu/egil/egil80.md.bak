CHAPTER LXXIX.  
  

Egil comes to Thorfinn's. The harrying of king Hacon.  
  

Egil traveled on till he came westward out of the wood. They made for
Thorfinn's that evening, where they were well received: their wounds
were bound up, and they stayed there several nights. Helga, the master's
daughter, was now on her feet, and whole of her ailment. For this she
and all the family thanked Egil. He and his rested there themselves and
their beasts.  
The man who had graved the runes for Helga dwelt not far off. It now
came out that he had asked her to wife, but Thorfinn would not give her.
Then this landowner's son would fain beguile her, but she would not
consent. So he thought to grave for her love-runes, but he did not
understand them aright, and graved that wherefrom she took her
sickness.  
And when Egil was ready to depart, Thorfinn and his son escorted them on
the road: they being thus ten or twelve in company. They went with them
all that day as a guard against Armod and his house-carles. But when the
tidings were heard how Egil's band had fought against overwhelming odds
in the wood and conquered, then Armod thought it hopeless to raise
shield against Egil: wherefore he with all his men sat at home. Egil and
Thorfinn exchanged gifts at parting, and pledged themselves to
friendship. Then Egil and his men went their way, and no tidings are
told of their journey before they came to Thorstein's.  
There their wounds were healed. Egil stayed there till spring. But
Thorstein sent messengers to king Hacon to bring him the tribute for
which Egil had gone to Vermaland. Who, when they came before the king,
told him the tidings of what had been done in Egil's journey, and
brought him the tribute. The king was now sure that what he had before
suspected was true, namely, that earl Arnvid had caused the slaying of
the two companies of messengers sent eastwards by him. The king said
that Thorstein should have leave to dwell in the land, and should be
reconciled to him. Then the messengers returned home; and on coming to
Thorstein's told him that the king was well pleased with this Vermaland
journey, and that Thorstein was now to have reconciliation and
friendship with the king.  
King Hacon in the summer went eastwards to Vik: whence he journeyed
still eastwards to Vermaland with a large force. Earl Arnvid fled away;
but the king took large fines from those landowners whom he thought
guilty against him according to the report of those who went after the
tribute. He set over the land another earl, taking hostages of him and
of the landowners. In this expedition Hacon went far and wide about
western Gautland and subdued it, as is told in his Saga, and is found in
the poems composed about him. It is also told that he went to Denmark,
and harried there far and wide. Then was it that with two ships he
disabled twelve ships of the Danes, and gave to Tryggva, son of his
brother Olaf, the name of king and the rule over Vik eastwards.  
Egil in the summer made ready his merchant-ship and got thereto a crew.
But the long-ship that he had brought from Denmark in the autumn he gave
to Thorstein at parting. Thorstein gave Egil good gifts, and they
pledged them to close friendship. Egil sent messengers to Thord, his
wife's kinsman, at Aurland, and gave him charge to arrange for those
lands that Egil owned in Sogn and Hordaland, bidding him sell them if
there were a buyer. And when Egil was ready for his voyage, they sailed
out along the bay, and then northwards along the Norway coast, and
afterwards out into the main. They had a fairly good breeze, and came
from the main into Borgar-firth; and Egil steered his ship up the firth
to the haven close to his own house. He had his cargo conveyed home, and
his ship set up on wooden props. Egil went home to his house: fain were
folk to see him; and there he stayed for that winter.
