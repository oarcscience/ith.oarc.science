CHAPTER XIII.  
  
*Thorgils goes to the king.*  
  

There was a man named Thorgils Yeller, a house-carle of Thorolf's,
honoured above all the rest of his household; he had followed Thorolf in
his roving voyages as fore-castle man and standard-bearer. He had been
in Hafr's Firth, in the fleet of king Harold, and was then steering the
very ship that Thorolf had used in his roving. Thorgils was strong of
body and right bold of heart; the king had bestowed on him friendly
gifts after the battle, and promised him his friendship. Thorgils was
manager at Torgar, and bore rule there when Thorolf was not at home.  
Before Thorolf went away this time he had counted over all the king's
tribute that he had brought from the fells, and he put it in Thorgils'
hand, bidding him convey it to the king, if he himself came not home
before the king returned south. So Thorgils made ready a large ship of
burden belonging to Thorolf, and put the tribute on board, and taking
about twenty men sailed southward after the king, and found him in
Naumdale.  
But when Thorgils met the king he gave him greeting from Thorolf, and
said that he was come thither with the Finns' tribute sent by Thorolf.
The king looked at him, but answered never a word, and all saw that he
was angry. Thorgils then went away, thinking to find a better time to
speak with the king; he sought Aulvir Hnuf, and told him what had
passed, and asked him if he knew what was the matter.  
'That do I not,' said he; 'but this I have marked, that, since we were
at Leka, the king is silent every time Thorolf is mentioned, and I
suspect he has been slandered. This I know of Hildirida's sons, that
they were long in conference with the king, and it is easy to see from
their words that they are Thorolf's enemies. But I will soon be certain
about this from the king himself.'  
Thereupon Aulvir went to the king, and said: 'Here is come Thorgils
Yeller thy friend, with the tribute which is thine; and the tribute is
much larger than it has been before, and far better wares. He is eager
to be on his way; be so good, O king, as to go and see it; for never
have been seen such good gray furs.'  
The king answered not, but he went to where the ship lay. Thorgils at
once set forth the furs and showed them to the king. And when the king
saw that it was true, that the tribute was much larger and better, his
brows somewhat cleared, and Thorgils got speech with him. He brought the
king some bearskins which Thorolf sent him, and other valuables besides,
which he had gotten upon the fells. So the king brightened up, and asked
tidings of the journey of Thorolf and his company. Thorgils told it all
in detail.  
Then said the king: 'Great pity is it Thorolf should be unfaithful to me
and plot my death.'  
Then answered many who stood by, and all with one mind, that it was a
slander of wicked men if such words had been spoken, and Thorolf would
be found guiltless. The king said he would prefer to believe this. Then
was the king cheerful in all his talk with Thorgils, and they parted
friends.  
but when Thorgils met Thorolf he told him all that had happened.
