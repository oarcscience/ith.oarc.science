</FONT><P>WHEN </B>Thorir died his son Thorarin set up his household to the north of Espihole and lived there. Glum had two children by his wife, of whom one was M&aacute;rr, as has been said above, and the other was Vigfuss; both promising, but utterly unlike each other. M&aacute;rr was quiet and silent, but Vigfuss was a dashing fellow, ready to do an unfair thing, strong and full of courage. There was a man living with Glum, who was called Hallvard, and was a freedman of his; he had brought Vigfuss up, and having got a good deal of property together by cheating in money matters , he had made over the reversion if it to his foster-child. Hallvard had a bad name, and went to live at a place called "The Tarns," in the valley of the Eyjafirth: nor did his reputation impove on account of the spot where he dwelt, for he was sharp in dealing with the cattle in the common pastures up there. Vigfuss was a great traveller<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man hight Halli lived at Jorunnarstad, who was called "Halli the white," and he was the son of Thorbi&ouml;rn, whilst his mother was Vigdis, the daughter of Andun the bald. Now Halli had fostered Einar, the son of Eyiolf, who then lived at Saurb&aelig;. Halli was blind, and was mixed up in all the lawsuits in the country because he was both a wise man and sound in his judgment. His sons were Orm and Brusi the Skald, who lived at T&ouml;rfufell, and B&aacute;rd, who lived at Sk&aacute;llstad. B&aacute;rd was a noisy, quarrelsome fellow, better able to fight than anybody, and reckless and abusive in his language; he had for a wife Una, the daughter of Oddkell, in Thiors&aacute;dal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One autumn Halli missed some ten or twelve wethers out of the hill pastures, and they could not be found, so when B&aacute;rd and his father met, Halli asked his son what he thought had become of the wethers. B&aacute;rd replied, "I don&#146;t wonder if sheep disappear, when a thief lives next door to you, ever since Hallvard came into the district. "Yes," says Halli, "I should like you to set on foot a suit against him, and summon him for theft. I don&#146;t think, if I make this charge against him, Glum will go the lengths of clearing him by the oath of twelve men." "No," answered B&aacute;rd, "it will be a difficult matter for him to get the oath of twelve men out of Glum and Vigfuss and their people." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
