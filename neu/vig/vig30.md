<span id="_Toc29619174">CHAPTER XXVII</span>

THERE was a man named Narvi who dwelt at Hrisey. He had as his wife
Ulfeida, the daughter of Ingiald, son of Helgi the thin. Their sons were
Eyiolf, Klængr, Thorbrand, and Thorvald, all distinguished men and
kinsmen of Glum’s. Two of these, Klæengr and Eyiolf, lived at Hrisey,
after their father’s death. A man named Thorvald, who had married Helga,
the daughter of Thord, the son of Hraf, of Stöckahlad, and who was
nicknamed "Menni," dwelt at Hagi at that time. One spring Thorvald came
from Hagi, and lay off Hrisey in his vessel, intending to fish, and when
Klængr was aware of this he stared with him. They got out into the
firth, and fell in with a whale which was just dead, which they made
fast and towed into the firth in the course of the day. Klængr wanted to
bring the carcass into Hrisey, because the distance was shorter, but
Thorvald desired to tow it to Hagi, and said he had and equal right to
do so. Klængr maintained that it was not the law to take it anywhere
except to the nearest point where any of the men engaged in the capture
owned land. Thorvald asserted his rights, and said that Glum’s kinsmen
had no business to interfere with the fair partition of the fish.
Whatever the laws were, the strongest should now have their way. At that
moment Thorvald had the largest number of men with him, and so they took
the drift fish from Klængr by force, though both of them were
land-owners. Klængr went home very much dissatisfied, and Thorvald and
his people laughed at him and his party, telling them they did not dare
to hold on to their booty.  
        One morning Klængr got up early, and went with three other men
in to Hagi, so as to be there in good time whilst people were still
asleep. Then Klængr said--"We’ll try a scheme; here are cattle about in
the homestead; we will drive them on to the buildings, under which
Thorvald is asleep, and so we shall get him to come out."  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27) They did this, and Thorvald woke up and
rushed out of doors. Klængr made at him, and gave him a mortal wound;
but went away again without daring to declare himself the slayer,
because there were so many people about on the spot. So he went out to
one of the islands, and there declared that he had killed Thorvald. The
right of claiming atonement belonged to Thorarin and Thord, and they
treated the case as one of murder.  <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28)
When the suit was being brought before the Thing, Glum was quiet at
home, but whilst the Thing was going on he went about in the districts
of Fliot and Svarvadardal, begging for help to meet the execution of the
anticipated sentence of forfeiture; however, he asked men to say nothing
of this intention of his. Klaufi, of Bárd, exclaimed, "To be sure we
will help Glum; he married Halldora, the daughter of Arnor Red-cheek;"
and many men besides promised to support him. Then Glum returned home,
but the suit ran its course at the Thing, and when that was over they
got ready to carry out the sentence of forfeiture with four ships, and
thirty men in each ship. Einar, Thorarn, and Thord commanded the ships,
and when they came in-shore at the island, in the twilight of morning,
they saw a smoke rising over the buildings. Einar asked his people
whether it appeared to them, as it did to him, that the smoke was not a
clear blue. They answered that so it seemed to them. "Then," said Einar,
"it appears likely to me from that smoke that there are a good many
people in the house, and that steam hanging in the air must be the steam
from men. If this be so we shall find out about it by rowing away from
the island openly and then we shall be sure if there by any number of
men there." They did this, and when the men who were in the island saw
them they rushed out to their vessels, and put out after them, for Glum
had come thither with two hundred and forty men, and they chased them
right up to Oddaeyr, so that the sentence of forfeiture was not carried
out, and the men of Eyjafirth got dishonour by the failure.  
        Glum remained in his own dwelling through the summer. He had to
open an Autumn court; but the place of holding it is on the east of the
firth, not far from Kaupáng, and the men of Eyjafirth got a large force
together, whilst Glum had only thirty men. Many people spoke to Glum and
told him that he ought not to go with a small number of followers. His
answer was, "The finest portion of my life is gone by, and I am pleased
that they have not driven me so hard that I cannot ride the straight
path." He went up the firth in a ship, and then disembarked and went to
he booths. Now between the firth and the booths there are certain steep
ascents covered with loose gravel, and when Glum came opposite to the
booth which belonged to Einar, men rushed out upon him and his people
and dashed their shields against them so as to push them down the slope.
Glum fell and rolled shield and all down the bank on to the spit of sand
below. He was not wounded, but three spears had stuck in his shield.
Thorvald Tafalld had then come to shore and saw that Glum was in a
strait: he jumped on land with his oar in his hand and, running up the
slope, hurled it at Gudmund the powerful: it came against his shield,
which broke, and the handle of the oar struck him on the breast so that
he fell down senseless and was carried off by four men to his booth.
Then they challenged one another to come on, and cast weapons and stones
on both sides, and the contest was a hard one; many were wounded; but
all said the same thing--that it was impossible for a small number to
fight better than Glum and his men had done. Einar and his men made a
vigorous onslaught; but people interfered, and it ended in Glum losing
two men, Klængr, the son of Narvi, and Grim Eyrarlegg, the brother of
his wife Halldora. Then Brusi, the son of Halli, made these verses:

  
"Thou warrior-goddess of the shield!  
We held our own in battle fray--  
I know ‘tis so--we did not yield  
The honour of the day.  
  
"Those chiefs forsooth, the while we fought,  
(Bright nymph! it may not be denied)  
Strode somewhat faster than I though  
Adown the steep hill side."

Then Einar composed a stanza:

"he had to run away perforce  
From out the fight--that swordsman bold--  
I trow ‘twas hard to stop his course  
As down the bank he roll’d.  
  
"Well us’d the pirate’s spear to wield,  
In vain that chieftain fought,  
And the loose shingle fail’d to yield  
The foothold which he sought."

Then Glum composed some verses in answer to him:

"Though standing on the band so high  
Their helmets made a gallant show,  
They did not dare their luck to try  
Upon the beach below.  
  
"They did not dare to risk the path,  
Whilst on the sandy shore we stood,  
And fac’d the dread Valkyrie’s wrath  
With shields that dripp’d with blood."

The matter was settled upon the ground that the death of Klængr and
Thorvald of Hagi were set off one against the other, and the slaying of
Grim Eyrarlegg was considered equal to the injury caused to Gudmund; but
Glum was much dissatisfied with this close of the suit, as he expressed
himself in the following stanza, which he made afterwards:

"The world is worthless; and my life  
With all the keen delights of strife  
Hath well-nigh passed away.  
  
"Too weak, when gallant Grim lay low,  
To strike ‘mid men th’ avenging blow,  
And blood with blood repay!"

level with the ground and probably covered with turf or sod.

on the spot avowed the deed.
