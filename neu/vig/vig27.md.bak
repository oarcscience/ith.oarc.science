<span id="_Toc29619171">CHAPTER XXIV</span>

ONE day, when men had got together at the warm bath of Hrafnagil,
Thorvard came thither. He was a merry fellow, and amused himself in many
ways. "What men," he asked, "have you got here who can entertain us with
some fresh stories?" "There is plenty of amusement and fun where you
are," they said. "Well," he replied, "nothing amuses me more than
reciting Glum’s verses; but I keep thinking over what can be the faulty
reckoning he speaks of in one of his stanzas, when he says he did not
get credit for all the people he had killed. What are we to suppose to
be the real state of the case? Which is more likely, that Gudbrand
killed Thorvald, or that Glum did it?" This view seemed to many men
worth consideration, and Thorvard rode to meet Thorarin, and said to
him, "I have been thinking the matter out, and I am convinced that the
truth has not been known about the death of Thorvald the crooked. You
will find in Glum’s verses, that he says he has not got credit for all
the men he has killed." Thorarin answered, "I can hardly take the case
up again, though you should be right, and so things shall remain as they
are." Thorvard rejoined, "That is not a proper course, although if the
matter had not been revived, all might have gone on quietly; no I shall
talk of it publicly, and there will fall on you disgrace greater than
any which has yet ensued in this affair." "Well," said Thorarin, "it
seems to me an awkward matter to carry this cause to the Althing, in the
face of the power of Glum and his kinsmen." Thorvard replied," I can
give you a piece of advice on that point. Summon him to the Hegranes
Thing: you have plenty of kinsmen there, and he will find it hard to
defend the case." "That we will do," said Thorarin, an so they parted.  
        The spring was a bad one, and everything became difficult to
procure. At that time Thorarin set on foot the suit as against Glum at
Hegranes Thing, inasmuch as all the priests of the different division in
the district who belonged to that Thing, were bound to Thorarin by the
ties of kindred. It was scarcely possible to get across the moors with
horses, on account of the snow. So Glum adopted the plan of putting a
large vessel into the charge of his brother, Thorstein, who was to sail
in her to the westward, and convey arms and provisions to the Thing.
When, however, they came off Ulfsdal, the ship went to pieces, and all
the men and property on board her were lost. Glum got to the Thing with
a hundred and twenty men, but he could not encamp nearer to the place
itself than in the outer circle, or "verge" of the court.  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) Einar, the son of Eyiolf, with the men of
Espihole, was already there. Word was sent to Glum that he was to
present himself to the court, and produce his plea in answer to the
indictment. Glum went accordingly, but the men were drawn up on both
sides in such a way that there was not more space than would allow of
one man passing, and Glum was desired to go into the enclosure if he
wanted to get to the court. He did not think this an advisable course,
so he said to his men, "It is easy to see that they think they have got
our affair in their own hands now. Well, it may be so, but I should like
you to fall back and change your order. I will march first, then two men
following me in a line, and then four in a line after them, and so on;
and we will march right at them, keeping our spears before us, and this
sort of wedge must make its way in if you follow close up. They did
this, and pushed without interruption right into the ring which was
cleared for the court, but it was night long before they could be got of
the ground again, so as to allow the court to sit; so great was the
crush and press. At last it was brought about that the court was
reconstituted, and they were proceeding to sum up the case when Glum
came forward on the bank were the court was held, and called his
witnesses to the fact that the sun had risen again on the field of the
Thing; then he protested solemnly against any judgment being given in
the case before them. It followed from this protest that every suit
before the court at once discontinued and fell to the ground. Men rode
away, and the people of Espihole were very ill pleased with what had
happened.  <span id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md)  
        Thorarin declared that Glum had dealt vexatiously with them, but
Einar replied, "The matter does not appear to me to be so very ugly, for
the suit may be taken up again at the point where it left off."
Afterwards the men of Espihole rode to the Althing with Einar, and with
many of their friends who had promised them their support against glum.
Glum’s kinsmen gave him their help also in securing the benefit of the
point of law, and the matter was settled by the advice of skilled men,
on condition that Glum would take an oath in the case to the effect that
he did not kill Thorvald the crooked. So when many men interceded, they
compounded the matter on these terms--that Glum should swear he had not
slain him; and the time was appointed when the oath should be taken,
that is to say, in the autumn, five weeks before winter. They followed
up the suit with such vigour that they were determined to bring it on
again, if he did not take the necessary oath in three temples on the
Eyjafirth, and if it were not done at the prescribed time the right to
clear himself by the oath was to be forfeited. There was much talk about
this business, and what Gum’s oaths would be, and how he would get on
with them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[1](vig27.htm#fr_18.md) I believe that the word in
the original "Fiörbaugsgardr’ occurs only twice in the sense of the
verge or ring round the ground on which the Thing met. Mr. Dasent speaks
of it as "an enclosed space near a court, a ‘verge’, or ‘liberty,’
within which the Fiörbaugsmadr (that is one liable to the lesser
outlawry) was safe." See preface to the Nial’s Saga, p. clxii.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[2](vig27.htm#fr_19.md) The reason for this seems
to be that the defendant was summoned to answer on a certain day, and
when the sun rose again before he was formally called on, that day was
over, and the whole proceedings were avoided.
