<span id="_Toc29619147">PREFACE</span>

I **HAVE** heard the question asked, "What interest can attach to the
language and literature of a small and remote island, the inhabitants of
which never exceeded 60,000 in number?" The population of Iceland has
always been insignificant, and its territory barren, but we must
recollect what the race was, which this population represented, and
whose language it is that has come down to us as a living tongue, on
this half desert spot in in the Northern Ocean. The Sagas, of which this
tale is one, were composed for the men who have left their mark in every
corner of Europe, and whose language and laws are at this moment
important elements in the speech and institutions of England, America,
and Australia. There is no page of modern history in which the influence
of the Northmen and their conquest must not be taken into
account--Russia, Constantinople, Greece, Palestine, Sicily, the coasts
of Africa, Southern Italy, France, the Spanish Peninsula, England,
Scotland, Ireland, and every rock and island round them, have been
visited, and most of them at one time or another, ruled by the men of
Scandinavia. The motto on the sword of Roger Guiscard was a proud
one--  
  
                Appulus et Calaber Siculus mihi servit, et Afer."  
                                        *(Raumer, Hohenstaufen, b. i.
circa 473).  
*  
        The remoteness or insignificance of Iceland, therefore, affords
no adequate measure of the interest which belongs to its language, its
literature, and its history. All this has been fully discussed by Mr.
Laing in his prefaces to the Heimskringla, and by Mr. Dasent in the
essay prefixed to his excellent translation of the Nial’s Saga. But
there is another point of view in which these Icelandic stories possess
a great and peculiar interest in relation to their history of
literature. Taken altogether, they are the first prose literature which
exists in any modern language spoken by the people.  
        Notwithstanding the fact that Monsieur Jourdain had talked prose
for forty years without knowing it, good composition in prose is a
product of the human intellect of far slower growth than good poetry.
Imagination and metre have always been in advances of plain facts and
prose.  
        We admit that Greek prose writers existed in the sixth century
before Christ, but that was long after the birth of Greek poetry; and
prose writing ripened only in the time of Herodotus, when very little
more was known about the author of the Homeric songs than we moderns
know at this day.  
        In what country except Scandinavia, or in what other modern
living language of Europe did there exist, in the elevenths century, a
literature embracing history and prose-fiction?  
        No doubt there were translations into Anglo-Saxon from the
Latin, by Alfred, of an earlier date, but there was in truth no
vernacular literature. I cannot name any work in High or Low German
prose which can be carried back to this period. In French prose-writing
cannot be said to have begun before the time of Villehardouin (1204),
and Joinville (1202). Castilian prose certainly did not commence before
the time of Alfonso X. (1252). Don Juan Manuel, the author of the "Conde
Lucanor," was not born till 1282. The Cronica General de Espana was not
composed till at least the middle of the thirteenth century. About the
same time the language of Italy was acquiring that strength and softness
which were destined to appear so conspicuously in the prose of
Boccaccio, and the writers of the next century.  
        Burt "Are hinn frodi," who is said by Snorri to have first
committed these Sagas to writing, was born in 1067, and it must be
supposed on reasonable grounds that the earlier ones had assumed their
present form before the end of the twelfth century. It should be
remembered, too, that the number of these compositions is very large,
and that they contain both history and fiction. The reader will find a
list of Icelandic works in Mr. Laing’s book, already referred to. Our
existing MSS of them cannot be assigned to a date earlier than the
fourteenth century.  
        Of these sagas that of Viga-Glum, now translated, is probably
one of the earliest. Bishop Müller says of it, in his "Saga Bibliothek"
(Copenhagen, 1817, b. i. 78): "This Saga conains important contributions
ito the history of manners, legislation, and religious ideas. It is
composed in the pure old language, and is without doubt one of the
earliest written narratives. The events are true. The most important
persons and acts are spoken of in the Landnama. Glum himself is named in
the Valnaliot’s Saga, in the Kristni Saga, and in the Landnama. His
quarrels with Viga Skuta are told with more detail in the Sagas of the
latter. Glum’s son, Vigfuss, is mentioned in many Sagas, and in the
Heimskringla, in Olaf Tryggvesen’s history, chapter 45 (Laing’s Transl.
vol. i. p. 410). His nephew, Thorvald Tafalld, who supported him in his
fights, has also been made the subject of a special little narrative,
which is to be found in Olaf Tryggvesen’s Saga. The annals mention one
of Glum’s exploits under the year 942 or 944. Asgrim, the son of
Ellidagrim, who is named in this Saga, is known to us also in the Nial’s
Saga, Floamanna Saga, and Kristni Saga. Einar, Gudmund’s brother, is
often mentioned, especially in the Liosvetninga Saga."  
        Einar, here referred to by Bishop Müller, was a remarkable
person in Icelandic history. He was the brother of Gudmund the Powerful,
and the direct descendant of Helga, the sister of Ingald, Glum’s
grandfather. When Olaf, King of Norway, wanted to obtain the island of
Grimsö with a view to encroaching the independence of Iceland, Einar
addressed to his countrymen one of the simplest and most striking
speeches ever made on behalf of freedom. He counselled them to have
nothing to do with the king, except in the way of gifts or voluntary
presents which could not be mistaken for tribute. This speech will be
found in Mr. Laing’s Heimskringla, vol. ii. p. 188.  
        With regard to the intrinsic merits of the narrative, the reader
must judge for himself. The picture of society which it presents to us
is not one of pastoral simplicity and repose, but the actors in it are
real men and women, not merely lay figures, and the events are for the
most part those of every-day life. Bloodshed and violence are common,
and a man’s consideration in the community depends mainly on his won
courage and on his wealth yet the condition of things contrast
favourably with that prevailing in most countries at a far later date
under the fuedal system. The bulk of the population were free; they made
their own laws, and executed them themselves, and we see among them the
working of those principles of constitutional freedom which in most
countries of Europe have long since perished. One peculiarity too they
have which is especially interesting to us. They exhibit in a most
remarkable degree that idolatry for forms of law, which sometimes causes
the substance of justice to be disregarded as secondary to the form, but
which, on the other hand, in our own country, has perhaps more than once
saved the kernel by preserving the husk, when both would otherwise have
perished. I believe it is a curious fact that the Normans retain to the
present day a reputation for litigiousness as compared with other French
provinces.  
        Viga-Glum, or "Murdering Glum," the hero of this story, is not
by any means a perfect character, even when measured by the standards of
the time in which he lived; but the author tells us that for twenty
years he was the first man in Eyjafirth, and for twenty years more there
was no better man there. He is described as one who was naturally
indolent, shy, and moody; but when once he could be brought to act, his
courage and determination were indomitable. he was thoroughly
unscrupulous; neither blood nor false oaths stood in his way when he had
to achieve a purpose. It might be said of him, as of Autolycus, the
grandfather of Ulysses (Od. xix. 395). His humour is sometimes childish,
as is the story of Kálf; and sometimes savage, as when he asks the wife
to put a stitch into his cloak just before he turns round and kills her
husband, apparently for no object but to show his thorough coolness and
indifference. The finishing touch to this part of his character is added
by the peculiarity, that whenever he was intent on slaying a man, he was
apt to be seized with a fit of uncontrollable laughter which ended in
tears.  
        There is something very striking too in the description of the
old heathen, stone-blind, who hopes before he dies, yet to slay by
treachery one at least of his enemies, and rides out to meet them with a
drawn sword under his cloak.  
        Among the incidents of the story, that of Eyiolf killing the
Berserker is to me particularly interesting. It is one of many such in
the Sagas, as for instance in the Egil’s Saga and the Grettir’s Saga.
Here we find the type of the old common-stock stories of romance about
distressed damsels rescued by knights from giants’ but we see this type
exemplified in everyday life, as if it were something that might happen
to any man the next morning; and as we are told in the Grettir’s Saga it
did happen very often in Norway when those pests of the society of that
day, the Berserkers, were allowed to make their way in the world, and
advance their fortunes as professional bullies.  <span

        The story is not always intelligible unless the reader keeps in
mind the personal relations of the actors, and I have therefore appended
to the translation two or three pedigrees of the families to which they
belonged. With regard to the Icelandic text it should be observed that
there is but one manuscript of any value, the others being mere
transcripts. The obscurities arising from this fact are especially felt
in the scraps of poetry, which are often very difficult to make out.
They have very little merit and I have done no more than paraphrase
their general meaning; but they could not be omitted altogether, as in
one or two cases the story turns upon their contents. In the prose
narrative I have adhered to the original as closely as was consistent
with my desire of presenting to the English reader a translation that
could be read without being very stiff and tiresome, but I am by no
means sure that I have attained this object.  
        I ought not to close this Preface without acknowledging the
assistance which I have received from Mr. Dasent and especially from Mr.
Vigfusson, the Editor of the "Eyrbyggia Saga," printed at Leipzig in
1864. Another friend, the Right Honourable Robert Lowe, has permitted me
to prefix to this book a Greek Epigram of his addressed to Iceland,
which is worthy of his reputation as a classical scholar. I only wish
that his public occupations would allow us to profit by his acquirements
in the language and literature of the North.
