<span id="_Toc29619156">CHAPTER IX</span>

IT is said that Glum had a dream one night, in which he seemed to be
standing out in front of his dwelling, looking towards the firth; and he
thought he saw the form of a woman stalking up straight through the
district from the sea towards Thverá. She was of such height and size
that her shoulders touched the mountains on each side, and he seemed to
go out of the homestead to meet her and asked her to come to his house;
and then he woke up. This appeared very strange to every one, but he
said, "The dream is no doubt a very remarkable one, and I interpret it
thus--My grandfather, Vigfuss, must be dead, and that woman who was
taller than the mountains, must be his guardian spirit, for he too was
far beyond other men in honour and in most things, and his spirit must
have been looking for a place of rest where I am." But in the summer,
when the ships arrived, the news of Vigfuss’s death became known, and
then Glum sang as follows--

"At dead of night, beneath the sky,  
Upon the banks of Eyjafirth,  
I saw the spirit stalking by,  
In giant stature o’er the earth.  
  
"The goddess of the sword and spear  
Stood, in my dream, upon this ground;  
And whilst the valley shook with fear,  
She tower’d above the mountains round."

        In the spring Thorkel met Thorvald the crooked, and other sons
of Thorir, and asked them to follow up this suit of his, referring to
the tie which united them throurgh Thorir’s daughter, and to all the
friendship which he and his son Sigmund had shown to them. Thorvald
spoke to Thorarin, and said that it would be discreditable to them not
to help their brother-in-law, and he replied that he was ready to do all
he could, and besides, he said, "It is now clear that Glum means to turn
the slaying of Sigmund to account, so as to make himself a great man,
and we think ourselves worth as much as he is in the district." "Yes,"
replied Thorarin, "but it seems to me it will be hard to follow up the
suit, so as to make sure that we shall get any advantage by it, and on
the other hand it is not unexpected that Glum should take after his race
and kindred. I am slower to move in it than you are, because I doubt if
any honour is to be got in a quarrel with Glum; yet I should not like to
see our credit lowered." Hoever, after a certain pressure, Thorarin, the
son of Thorir, set on foot at the Althing the suit against Glum for the
slaying of Sigmund; and Glum set on foot a suit against Thorkel the
tall, for slander against Astrida’s serfs; and another against Sigmund,
whom he charged with theft, and whom he alleged that he had killed while
trespassing on his own property. So he summoned him as outlawed,
inasmuch as he fell on his, Glum’s, land, and he dug his body up. In
this condition matters were when they went to the Althing. Then Glum
visited his kinsmen, and sought for help at the hands of Gizor the
white, and Teit, the son of Ketilbiörn of Mosfell, and Asgrim, the son
of Ellidagrim; and he told them the whole course of the proceedings, and
how Thorkel and Sigmund had encroached on his rights, and all the wrong
and disgrace they had inflicted on him. But from them, he said, he
expected help to put matters in a better condition. He himself would
conduct the suit. They all professed themselves bound to take care that
his cause was not left in unfriendly hands, and said they should be glad
to see him distinguish himself among their kin.  
        The Thing went on till the court sat, and the men of Espihole
preferred their suit for the slaying of Sigmund, rather as if they were
egged on by those who had wrongs to revenge, than by those who felt sure
that there were no flaws in their case. Glum too moved in the case
against Thorkel, and the two suits came before the court. Glum had many
kinsmen and friends to back him, and when, as defendant, he was called
on to answer, he said, "The matter is on this wise. Every one may see
that you have gone into this suit more as a question of temper than
because there were no defects in your case, for I slew Sigmund
trespassing on my own property, and before I rode to the Thing I
proclaimed him as an outlaw." Then he named his witnesses on this point,
and defended his suit with the help of his kinsmen, in such sort that
judgment was given to the effect that Sigmund had been killed out of the
pale of the law. Glum next took up the charge against Thorkel for
trespass on his property, and the case looked ill for Thorkel, for the
witnesses were on Glum’s side, and there was no legal defence, so that
it ended in seeking to compound the matter with the plaintiff. Glum said
two courses were open--either he would follow the case out to its
conclusion, or Thorkel must reconvey the land that Thverá at such a
price as he should put on it, which was not more than half its worth.
"And Thorkel may be sure," he added, "if he is convicted, that we shall
not both of us be at the Thing next summer." The friends of Thorkel now
interfered to get him to compound the suit, and he took the course which
was expedient, settled the matter, and conveyed the land to Glum. He was
to live on the land for the year, and thus, so to speak, they were on
terms again. But the men of Espihole were ill pleased with the
conclusion of these suits, and from that time they were never on a good
footing with Glum. Indeed, before Thorkel left Thverá, he went to Frey’s
temple, and taking an old steer up thither, made this speech:--"Thou,
Frey," said he, "wert long my protector, and many offerings hast thou
had at my hands, which have borne good fruit to me. Now do I present
this steer to thee, in the hope that Glum hereafter may be driven by
force off this land, as I am driven off it; and, I pray thee, give me
some token whether thou acceptest this offering or not." Then the steer
was stricken in such a way that he bellowed loud and fell down dead, and
Thorkel took this a a favourable omen. Afterwards he was in better
spirits, as if he thought his offering was accepted and his wish
ratified by the god. Then he removed to Myvatn, and we have doe with him
in this story.
