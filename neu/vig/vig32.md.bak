On Judicial Proceedings on the Holmgang, and Appeal  
for Murder.

When I first read the account of Hallvard’s trial in Chapter xviii, in
my ignorance of Icelandic law, I conceived it to be a case of acquittal
by "compurgators," as in our old "Wager of Law." I soon found, however,
that this view was entirely erroneous. Trial by compurgators, curiously
enough, was unknown to the law of Iceland. Schlegel, in his preface to
the Grágás (Copenhagen, 1829), says, Consacramentalium autem nullus usus
apud Islando obtinuit; quod eo magis mirum quum iis cæteræ gentes
Semptemtrionales olim æquè ac aliæ medio ævo sæpe uterentur" (p.
lxxxiv.).  
        In his prface to the Nial’s Saga, Mr. Dasent has described, with
great detail, the manner in which the four great inquests of thirty-six
householders each were constituted for the four quarter courts at the
Althing, but the mode of trial described in the text is one entirely
different from the Buakvidr, and was called the "Tolftarkvidr." In it
the judgment was given by a verdict of the Godi, or priest, with eleven
other members of his district. If we are at liberty to apply the rules
laid down in the Grágás to the earlier period of this story, the
following particulars may be stated--  
        The Godi himself named the eleven other men, nor does it seem to
have been necessary that they should be householders. This inquest might
be challenged, and if they did not agree the majority decided. If they
were equally divided that side prevailed on which the Godi voted
(Grágás. Thingskapathátr, ch. vii-xvii.). It will thus be seen that
practically the case was in the hands of the Godi, and Hallvard’s fate
depended on Glum acting in that capacity; by the Buakvidr his well-known
character would probably have secured a verdict against him.  
        In the Eyrbyggia Saga a complicated case occurs. Geirrid, the
sister of Arnkel, himself a Godi, is charged by Thorbiörn with having
bewitched his son Gunnlaug. Snorri, another Godi, was the brother-in-law
of Thorbiörn, and supported the charge made by the latter. Neither
Arnkel nor Snorri therefore, being respectively thus connected with the
accuser and accused, were considered competent to decide the case by the
Tolftarkvidr. Accordingly a third Godi, Helgi, was called in, but Arnkel
was allowed to swear on the altar-ring (Stalla-hring) that Geirrid was
innocent, and Thorarin swore with ten men, I presume, the other way.
Then Helgi acquitted Geirrid (Eyrbyggia Saga, c. xxi.). In this case
Arnkel and Thorarin seem to be something between compurgators and
witnesses, but the verdict is given by another. The Tolftarkvidr,
therefore, in Halvard’s case was neither like our "wager of law" nor
like the verdict of a jury.  
        I have already observed that Glum’s oath of purgation, in
chapter xxv., seems to be a case of an exceptional character, dependent
on a special compact between the parties. The accusers agreed to a
compromise only on the express condition that he should take such an
oath, and it must be remembered that another person had already been
declared guilty of the death with which he was charged. We are told, at
the end of chapter xxiv. that it was on this condition alone the suit
was to drop; the oath itself was no part of the proceedings in such
suit.  
        With regard to the Holmgang or duel as a recognized method for
terminating a suit, Maurer tells us that it was supposed to be abolished
in Iceland in 1011, very few years after the introduction by Nial of the
Fifth Court at the Althing, but I confess hat I doubt whether its
abolition was so closely connected as he supposes with the institution
of this tribunal. In the first place the cases provided for by the Fifth
Court in which legal proceedings would previously have been brought to a
dead lock, were only a portion, and a small portion, of those in which
the Holmgang might naturally be resorted to. In the second place,
moreover, we learn that it was in like manner abolished in Norway, in
1012, by Eric, the son of Hakon, without any such supplementary court
being instituted to supply its place.  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) I am more inclined to think that the
influence of Christianity, and a gradual change in the manners of the
people led to an alteration in both countries, and that the same feeling
showed the necessity of additional judicial facilities in Iceland. Of
course I admit that the institution of the Fifth Court would have a
tendency to diminish the number of cases in which men would have
recourse to the Holmgang.  
        In the face of these facts and dates, it is a curious question
for an Englishman--"When was the duel as a recognised part of a judicial
process abolished in England?" The answer is, in the year 1818! So that
in this reform we were 800 years behind our kinsmen in Iceland and
Scandinavia.  
        This subject is interesting in itself, and I am the more tempted
to dwell on it because the analogy between the old laws of England and
Iceland is very strong and in some points illustrates forcibly that
confusion between prosecutions and private suits which makes it
sometimes difficult to use what would now be appropriate legal language
with reference to transactions narrated in the text.  
        In an appeal for murder, as it existed in England at Common Law,
the relative had the right to proceed; a right designated in Iceland by
the word "Eptirmál," and which there could be handed over before
witnesses from one man to another.  
        In England, by an ordinance of Henry I., this right was confined
to the four first degrees of blood. In 1297, by the Great Charter of
Edward I., it was further limited in the case of women. "Nullus capiatur
aut imprisonetur propter appellum femine de morte alterius quam viri
sui" (Recort Statutes, vol. i. p 118) In the Eyrbyggia Saga we learn
that in consequence of the unsatisfactory manner in which the women, to
whom the Eptirmál for a certain Arnkel belonged, had prosecuted the
suit, a law was made by the "Landstiórnamenn" (that is, I suppose, the
Lögretta or Legislative Committee of the Althing) to the effect that
women and minors below sixteen should no longer have the Eptirmál
(Eyrbyggia, Leipzig, 1864, p. 69). By our statute of Glouchester (6,
Edward I., c. 9, 1278) it was provided that appeals should not abate as
easily as had previously been the case, but that if the appellor set
forth the deed, the day, the hour, the time of the king, the town where
the deed was done, and the weapon, the appeal should not abate for want
of fresh suit, provided it was made within the year and day after the
deed.  
        It does not follow that this limitation of a year and a day was
then established for the first time (See Blackstones, Comm., iv. p.
315). I ought to observe that the clause referred to above from the
statute of Glouchester is printed in the Record Edition of the Statutes
from M. 3, Cott. Vesp. B. vii. fol. 24, 6, and is not in the copy in the
Tower Rolls or in many other copies of the Act.  
        By the 3rd of Henry Vii., c. 2 (1487), a great change was made
in the proceeding on appeals for murder.  
        Lord Bacon, in his history of that king, tells us: "There was
also made another law for peace in general, and repressing of murders
and manslaughters, and was in amendment of the Common Laws of the realm;
being this; That whereas by the Common Law the King’s suit, in case of
homicide, did expect the year and the day, allowed to the party’s suit
by way of appeal; and that it was found by experience that the party was
many times compounded with, and many times wearied with the suit, so
that in the end such suit was let fall, and by that time the matter was
in a manner forgotten, and thereby prosecution at the King’s suit by
indictment (which is ever the best) *flagrante crimine* neglected; it
was ordained, at any time within the year and the day as after; not
prejudicing nevertheless the party’s suit." Southey (Common Place Book,
iii. p 8) justly remarks that this was the first step towards giving
public justice preference over private. By the words "not prejudicing
the party’s suit," Lord Bacon means that the accused, if acquitted,
ought still to be detained in prison or bailed until the year and day
had expired, so that the appeal might yet be made by the relatives in
spite of the acquittal. Accordingly Sir Thomas Smith, in his
(Commonwealth of England," describes both processes by indictment and
appeal as still existing; and in 1818, after a prisoner had been
acquitted by a jury for the murder of Mary Ashford, the brother of the
deceased appealed the defendant in open court. In consequence of this
case the whole proceeding by appeal and wager of battle was abolished by
the Statute 59, George III., c. 46.  
        The history of this single point of our criminal law is
eminently characteristic of the way in which our institutions work. The
practical evils and inconveniences connected with appeals were remedied,
as they arose, in the reigns of Edward I. and Henry Vii., but no one
ventured to touch the general principle. In fact, in the latter reign,
it is clear that the whole proceeding was really out of date, but
instead of suppressing it, the legislature contented itself with giving
priority to the king’s suit, and allowed it to slumber on. All of a
sudden, three hundred years afterwards, it is discovered to be alive,
and men are startled by its reappearance as much as they would be if one
of the mailed barons of those days were now to rise from his tomb in the
Abbey, and stalk across to take his seat in the House of Lords. That at
last it is really abolished.

THE END.
