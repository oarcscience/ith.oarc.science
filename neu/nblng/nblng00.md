# The Nibelungenlied

#### Author Unknown

Originally written in Middle High German (M.H.G.), sometime around 1200
A.D., although this dating is by no means certain. Author unknown.

The text of this edition is based on that published as "The
Nibelungenlied", translated by Daniel B. Shumway (Houghton-Mifflin Co.,
New York, 1909). This edition is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN in the United
States.

This electronic edition was edited, proofed, and prepared by Douglas B.
Killings

PREPARER'S NOTE:

In order to make this electronic edition easier to use, the preparer has
found it necessary to re-arrange the endnotes of Mr. Shumway's edition,
collating them with the chapters themselves and substituting page
references with footnote references. The preparer takes full
responsibility for these changes.--DBK.
