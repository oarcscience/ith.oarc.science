# ADVENTURE VI

## How Gunther Fared To Isenland \[1\] for Brunhild.

New tidings came across the Rhine. 'Twas said that yonder many a fair
maid dwelt. The good king Gunther thought to win him one of these; high
therefore rose the warrior's spirits. There lived a queen beyond the
sea, whose like men knew not anywhere. Peerless was her beauty and great
her strength. With doughty knights she shot the shaft for love. The
stone she hurled afar and sprang far after it. He who craved her love
must win without fail three games from this high-born dame. When the
noble maid had done this passing oft, a stately knight did hear it by
the Rhine. He turned his thoughts upon this comely dame, and so heroes
must needs later lose their lives.

One day when the king and his vassals sate and pondered to and fro in
many a wise, whom their lord might take to wife, who would be fit to be
their lady and beseem the land, up spake the lord of the Rhinelands: "I
will go down to the sea and hence to Brunhlld, however it may go with
me. For her love I'll risk my life. I will gladly lose it and she become
not my wife."

"Against that do I counsel you," spake then Siegfried, "if, as ye say,
the queen doth have so fierce a wont, he who wooeth for her love will
pay full dear. Therefore should ye give over the journey."

Then spake King Gunther: "Never was woman born so strong and bold that I
might not vanquish her with mine own hand."

"Be still," spake Siegfried, "ye little know her strength."

"So will I advise you," spake Hagen then, "that ye beg Siegfried to
share with you this heavy task. This is my rede, sith he doth know so
well how matters stand with Brunhild."

The king spake: "Wilt thou help me, noble Siegfried, to woo this lovely
maid? And thou doest what I pray thee and this comely dame become my
love, for thy sake will I risk both life and honor."

To this Siegfried, the son of Siegmund, answered: "I will do it, and
thou give me thy sister Kriemhild, the noble queen. For my pains I ask
no other meed."

"I'll pledge that, Siegfried, in thy hand," spake then Gunther, "and if
fair Brunhild come hither to this land, I'll give thee my sister unto
wife. Then canst thou live ever merrily with the fair."

This the noble warriors swore oaths to do, and so the greater grew their
hardships, till they brought the lady to the Rhine. On this account
these brave men must later be in passing danger. Siegfried had to take
with him hence the cloak which he, the bold hero, had won 'mid dangers
from a dwarf, Alberich he hight. These bold and mighty knights now made
them ready for the journey. When Siegfried wore the Cloak of Darkness he
had strength enow: the force of full twelve men beside his own. With
cunning arts he won the royal maid. This cloak was fashioned so, that
whatsoever any wrought within it, none saw him. Thus he won Brunhild,
which brought him dole.

"Now tell me, good Knight Siegfried, before our trip begin, shall we not
take warriors with us into Brunhild's land, that we may come with
passing honors to the sea? Thirty thousand men-at-arms can soon be
called."

"However many men we take," quoth Siegfried, "the queen doth use so
fierce a wont that they must perish through her haughty pride. I'll give
thee better counsel, O brave and worthy king. Let us fare as wandering
knights adown the Rhine, and I will tell thee those that shall be of the
band. In all four knights, we'll journey to the sea and thus we'll woo
the lady, whatever be our fate thereafter. I shall be one of the four
comrades, the second thou shalt be. Let Hagen be the third (then have we
hope of life), Dankwart then the fourth, the valiant man. A thousand
others durst not match us in the fight."

"Gladly would I know," spake then the king, "ere we go hence ('t would
please me much), what garments we should wear before Brunhild, which
would beseem us there. Pray tell this now to Gunther."

"Weeds of the very best which can be found are worn all times in
Brunhild's land. We must wear rich clothes before the lady, that we feel
no shame when men shall hear the tidings told."

The good knight spake: "Then will I go myself to my dear mother, if
perchance I can bring it to pass that her fair maids purvey us garments
which we may wear with honor before the high-born maid."

Hagen of Troneg spake then in lordly wise: "Wherefore will ye pray your
mother of such service? Let your sister hear what ye have in mind, and
she'll purvey you well for your journey to Brunhild's court."

Then sent he word to his sister, that he would fain see her, and Knight
Siegfried, too, sent word. Ere this happed the fair had clad her passing
well. That these brave men were coming, gave her little grief. Now were
her attendants, too, arrayed in seemly wise. The lordings came, and when
she heard the tale, from her seat she rose and walked in courtly wise to
greet the noble stranger and her brother, too.

"Welcome be my brother and his comrade. I'd gladly know," so spake the
maid, "what ye lords desire, sith ye be thus come to court. Pray let me
hear how it standeth with you noble knights."

Then spake king Gunther: "My lady, I'll tell you now. Maugre our lofty
mood, yet have we mickle care. We would ride a-wooing far into foreign
lands, and for this journey we have need of costly robes."

"Now sit you down, dear brother," spake the royal maid, "and let me hear
aright who these ladies be whom ye fain would woo in the lands of other
kings."

By the hand the lady took the chosen knights and with the twain she
walked to where she sate afore upon a couch, worked, as well I wot, with
dainty figures embossed in gold. There might they have fair pastime with
the ladies. Friendly glances and kindly looks passed now full oft
between the twain. In his heart he bare her, she was dear to him as
life. In after days fair Kriemhild became strong Siegfried's wife.

Then spake the mighty king: "Dear sister mine, without thy help it may
not be. We would go for knightly pastime to Brunhild's land, and have
need of princely garb to wear before the dames."

Then the noble maiden answered: "Dear brother mine, I do you now to wit,
that whatever need ye have of help of mine, that stand I ready to give.
Should any deny you aught, 't would please Kriemhild but ill. Most noble
knights, beseech me not with such concern, but order me with lordly air
to do whatso ye list. I stand at your bidding and will do it with a
will." So spake the winsome maid.

"We would fain, dear sister, wear good attire, and this your noble hand
shall help to choose . Your maidens then must make it fit us, for there
be no help against this journey." Then spake the princess: "Now mark ye
what I say. Silks I have myself; see ye that men do bring us jewels upon
the shields and thus we'll work the clothes. Gunther and Siegfried, too,
gave glad assent.

"Who are the comrades," spake the queen, "who shall fare with you thus
clad to court?"

He spake: "I shall be one of four. My liegemen twain, Dankwart and
Hagen, shall go with me to court. Now mark ye well, my lady, what I say.
Each of us four must have to wear for four whole days three changes of
apparel and such goodly trappings that without shame we may quit
Brunhild's land."

In fitting wise the lords took leave and parted hence. Kriemhild, the
queen, bade thirty of her maidens who were skillful in such work, come
forth from out their bowers. Silks of Araby, white as snow, and the fair
silk of Zazamanc, \[2\] green as is the clover, they overlaid with
precious stones; that gave garments passing fair. Kriemhild herself, the
high-born maiden, cut them out. Whatso they had at hand of well-wrought
linings from the skin of foreign fish, but rarely seen of folk, they
covered now with silk, as was the wont to wear. \[3\] Now hear great
marvels of these shining weeds. From the kingdom of Morocco and from
Libya, too, they had great store of the fairest silks which the kith of
any king did ever win. Kriemhild made it well appear what love she bore
the twain. Sith upon the proud journey they had set their minds, they
deemed ermine to be well fit. \[4\] Upon this lay fine silk as black as
coal. This would still beseem all doughty knights at high festal tides.
From out a setting of Arabian gold there shone forth many a stone. The
ladies' zeal, it was not small, forsooth; in seven weeks they wrought
the robes. Ready, too, were the weapons for the right good knights.

When now they all stood dight, \[5\] there was built for them in haste
upon the Rhine a sturdy little skiff, that should bear them downward to
the sea. Weary were the noble maids from all their cares. Then the
warriors were told that the brave vestures they should wear were now
prepared; as they had craved it, so it now was done. Then no longer
would they tarry on the Rhine; they sent a message to their
war-companions, if perchance they should care to view their new attire,
to see if it be too long or short. All was found in fitting measure, and
for this they gave the ladies thanks. All who saw them could not but
aver that never in the world had they seen attire more fair. Therefore
they wore it gladly at the court. None wist how to tell of better
knightly weeds. Nor did they fail to give great thanks. Then the lusty
knights craved leave to go, and this the lordings did in courtly wise.
Bright eyes grew dim and moist thereat from weeping.

Kriemhild spake: "Dear brother, ye might better tarry here a while and
pay court to other dames, where ye would not so risk your life; then
would I say well done. Ye might find nearer home a wife of as high a
birth."

I ween their hearts did tell them what would hap. All wept alike, no
matter what men said. The gold upon their breasts was tarnished by their
tears, which thick and fast coursed downward from their eyes.

She spake: "Sir Siegfried, let this dear brother of mine be commended to
your fealty and troth, that naught may harm him in Brunhild's land."
This the full brave knight vowed in Lady Kriemhild's hand.

The mighty warrior spake: "If I lose not my life, ye may be free from
every care, my lady. I'll bring him to you sound again hither to the
Rhine; that know of a surety." The fair maid bowed her thanks.

Men bare their gold-hued shields out to them upon the sands and brought
them all their harness. One bade lead up the steeds, for they would ride
away. Much weeping then was done by comely dames. The winsome maids
stood at the easements. A high wind stirred the ship and sails; the
proud war fellowship embarked upon the Rhine.

Then spake King Gunther: "Who shall be the captain of the ship?"

"That will I," quoth Siegfried, "I wot well how to steer you on the
flood. That know, good knights, the right water ways be well known to
me."

So they parted merrily from out the Burgundian land. Siegfried quickly
grasped an oar and from the shore the stalwart man gan push. Bold
Gunther took the helm himself, and thus the worshipful and speedy
knights set forth from land. With them they took rich food and eke good
wine, the best that could be found along the Rhine. Their steeds stood
fair; they had good easement. Their ship rode well; scant harm did hap
them. Their stout sheet-rope was tightened by the breeze. Twenty leagues
they sailed, or ever came the night, with a good wind, downward toward
the sea. These hard toils later brought the high-mettled warriors pain.

Upon the twelfth-day morning, as we hear say, the winds had borne them
far away to Isenstein in Brunhild's land. To none save Siegfried was
this known; but when King Gunther spied so many castles and broad
marches, too, how soon he spake: "Pray tell me, friend Siegfried, is it
known to you whose are these castles and this lordly land?"

Siegfried answered: "I know it well. It is the land and folk of Brunhild
and the fortress Isenstein, as ye heard me say. Fair ladies ye may still
see there to-day. Methinketh good to advise you heroes that ye be of one
single mind, and that ye tell the selfsame tale. For if we go to-day
before Brunhild, in much jeopardy must we stand before the queen. When
we behold the lovely maiden with her train, then, ye far-famed heroes,
must ye tell but this single tale: that Gunther be my master and I his
man; then what he craveth will come to pass." Full ready they were for
whatever he bade them vow, nor because of pride did any one abstain.
They promised what he would; wherefrom they all fared well, when King
Gunther saw fair Brunhild. \[6\]

"Forsooth I vow it less for thy sake than for thy sister's, the comely
maid, who is to me as mine own soul and body. Gladly will I bring it to
pass, that she become my wife."

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] "Isenland" translates here M.H.G. "Islant", which has, however, no
connection with Iceland in spite of the agreement of the names in
German. "Isen lant", the reading of the MSS. BJh, has been chosen,
partly to avoid confusion, and partly to indicate its probable
derivation from "Isenstein", the name of Brunhild's castle. Boer's
interpretation of "Isen" as 'ice' finds corroboration in Otfrid's form
"isine steina" ('ice stones', i.e. crystals) I, 1. 70. Isenstein would
then mean Ice Castle. In the "Thidreksaga" Brunhild's castle is called
"Saegarthr" ('Sea Garden'), and in a fairy tale (No. 93 of Grimm)
"Stromberg", referring to the fact that it was surrounded by the sea.
Here, too, in our poem it stands directly on the shore.

\[2\] "Zazamanc", a fictitious kingdom mentioned only here and a few
times in Parzival, Wolfram probably having obtained the name from this
passage. (See Bartsch, "Germanistische Studien", ii, 129.)

\[3\] "Wont to wear". In the Middle Ages costly furs and fish-skins were
used as linings and covered, as here described, with silk or cloth. By
fish such amphibious animals as otter and beaver were often meant.

\[4\] "Well fit". In this passage "wert", the reading of A and D, has
been followed, instead of unwert of B and C, as it seems more
appropriate to the sense.

\[5\] "Dight", 'arrayed'; used by Milton.

\[6\] "Brunhild". The following words are evidently a late
interpolation, and weaken the ending, but have been translated for the
sake of completeness. They are spoken by Siegfried.
