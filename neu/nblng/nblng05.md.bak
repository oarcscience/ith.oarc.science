# ADVENTURE III

## How Siegfried Came to Worms.

It was seldom that sorrow of heart perturbed the prince. He heard tales
told of how there lived in Burgundy a comely maid, fashioned wondrous
fair, from whom he thereafter gained much of joy, but suffering, too.
Her beauty out of measure was known far and wide. So many a here heard
of her noble mind, that it alone brought many a guest \[1\] to Gunther's
land. But however many were seen wooing for her love, Kriemhild never
confessed within her heart that she listed any for a lover. He was still
a stranger to her, whose rule she later owned. Then did the son of
Siegelind aspire to lofty love; the wooing of all others was to his but
as the wind, for well he wot how to gain a lady fair. In later days the
noble Kriemhild became bold Siegfried's bride. Kinsmen and liegemen enow
advised him, since he would have hope of constant love, that he woo one
who was his peer. At this bold Siegfried spake: "Then will I choose
Kriemhild, the fair maid of Burgundy, for her beauty beyond measure.
This I know full well, never was emperor so mighty, and he would have a
wife, that it would not beseem him to love this noble queen."

Tidings of this reached Siegmund's ear; through the talk of the
courtiers he was made ware of the wish of his son. Full loth it was to
the king, that his child would woo the glorious maid. Siegelind heard it
too, the wife of the noble king. Greatly she feared for her child, for
full well she knew Gunther and his men. Therefore they sought to turn
the hero from this venture. Up spake then the daring Siegfried: "Dear
father mine, I would fain ever be without the love of noble dames, if I
may not woo her in whom my heart hath great delight; whatsoever any may
aver, it will avail but naught."

"And thou wilt not turn back," spake the king, "then am I in sooth glad
of thy will and will help thee bring it to pass, as best I may. Yet hath
this King Gunther full many a haughty man. If there were none else but
Hagen, the doughty knight, he can use such arrogance that I fear me it
will repent us sore, if we woo this high-born maid."

Then Siegfried made reply: "Wherefore need that hinder us? What I may
not obtain from them in friendly wise, that my hand and its strength can
gain. I trow that 1 can wrest from him both folk and land."

To this Prince Siegmund replied: "Thy speech liketh me not, for if this
tale were told upon the Rhine, then durst thou never ride unto that
land. Long time have Gunther and Gernot been known to me. By force may
none win the maid, of this have I been well assured; but wilt thou ride
with warriors unto this land, and we still have aught of friends, they
shall be summoned soon."

"It is not to my mind," spake again Siegfried, "that warriors should
follow me to the Rhine, as if for battle, that I constrain thereby the
noble maid. My single hand can win her well--with eleven \[2\] comrades
I will fare to Gunther's land; thereto shalt thou help me, Father
Siegmund." Then to his knights they gave for garments furs both gray and
vair. \[3\]

Now his mother Siegelind also heard the tale. She began to make dole for
her loved child, whom she feared to lose through Gunther's men. Sorely
the noble queen gan weep. Lord Siegfried hied him straightway to where
he saw her; to his mother he spake in gentle wise: "Lady, ye must not
weep for me; naught have I to fear from all his fighting men. I pray
you, speed me on my journey to the Burgundian land, that I and my
warriors may have array such as proud heroes can wear with honor; for
this I will say you gramercy i' faith."

"Since naught will turn thee," spake then the Lady Siegelind, "so will I
speed thee on thy journey, mine only child, with the best of weeds that
ever knight did wear, thee and thy comrades. Ye shall have enow."

Siegfried, the youth, then made low obeisance to the queen. He spake:
"None but twelve warriors will I have upon the way. Let raiment be made
ready for them, I pray, for I would fain see how it standeth with
Kriemhild."

Then sate fair ladies night and day. Few enow of them, I trow, did ease
them, till Siegfried's weeds had all been wrought. Nor would he desist
from faring forth. His father bade adorn the knightly garb in which his
son should ride forth from Siegmund's land. The shining breastplates,
too, were put in trim, also the stanch helmets and their shields both
fair and broad. Now their journey to the Burgundian land drew near; man
and wife began to fear lest they never should come home again. The
heroes bade lade their sumpters with weapons and with harness. Their
steeds were fair and their trappings red with gold. No need were there
to live more proudly than Siegfried and his men. Then he asked for leave
to journey to the land of Burgundy; this the king and queen sorrowfully
vouchsafed. Lovingly he comforted them twain. "For my sake," spake he,
"must ye not weep, nor have fear for me or for my life."

The warriors, too, were sad and many a maiden wept; I ween, their hearts
did tell them rightly that many of their kinsmen would come to death
because of this. Just cause had they for wailing; need enow they had in
sooth.

Upon the seventh morning, forth upon the river sand at Worms the brave
warriors pricked. Their armor was of ruddy gold and their trappings
fashioned fair. Smoothly trotted the steeds of bold Siegfried's men.
Their shields were new; gleaming and broad and fair their helmets, as
Siegfried, the bold, rode to court in Gunther's land. Never had such
princely attire been seen on heroes; their sword-points hung down to
their spurs. Sharp javelins were borne by these chosen knights.
Siegfried wielded one full two spans broad, which upon its edges cut
most dangerously. In their hands they held gold-colored bridles; their
martingales were silken: so they came into the land. Everywhere the folk
began to gape amazed and many of Gunther's men fared forth to meet them.
High-mettled warriors, both knight and squire, betook them to the lords
(as was but right), and received into the land of their lords these
guests and took from their hands the black sumpters which bore the
shields. The steeds, too, they wished to lead away for easement. How
boldly then brave Siegfried spake: "Let stand the mounts of me and of my
men. We will soon hence again, of this have I great desire. Whosoever
knoweth rightly where I can find the king, Gunther, the mighty, of
Burgundian land, let him not keep his peace but tell me."

Then up spake one to whom it was rightly known: "Would ye find the king,
that can hap full well. In yon broad hall with his heroes did I but see
him. Ye must hither hie you; there ye may find with him many a lordly
man."

To the king now the word was brought, that full lusty knights were come,
who wore white breastplates and princely garb. None knew them in the
Burgundian land. Much it wondered the king whence came these lordly
warriors in such shining array, with such good shields, both new and
broad. Loth was it to Gunther, that none could tell him this. Then
Ortwin of Metz (a bold and mighty man was he) made answer to the king:
"Since we know them not, ye should send for mine uncle Hagen, and let
him see them. To him are known \[4\] all kingdoms and foreign lands. If
so be he knoweth these lords, he will tell us straightway."

Then bade the king that Hagen and his men be brought. One saw him with
his warriors striding in lordly wise unto the court.

"What would the king of me?" asked Hagen.

"There be come to my house strange warriors, whelm here none knoweth. If
ye have ever seen them, I pray you, Hagen, tell me now the truth."

"That will I," spake then Hagen. He hied him to a window and over the
guests he let his glances roam. Well liked him their trappings and their
array, but full strange were they to him in the Burgundian land. He
spake: "From wheresoever these warriors be come unto the Rhine, they may
well be princes or envoys of kings, for their steeds are fair and their
garments passing good. Whencesoever they bear these, forsooth
high-mettled warriors be they."

"I dare well say," so spake Hagen, "though I never have seen Siegfried,
yet can I well believe, however this may be, that he is the warrior that
strideth yonder in such lordly wise. He bringeth new tidings hither to
this land. By this here's hand were slain the bold Nibelungs, Schilbung
and Nibelung, \[5\] sons of a mighty king. Since then he hath wrought
great marvels with his huge strength. Once as the hero rode alone
without all aid, he found before a mountain, as I have in sooth been
told, by Nibelung's hoard full many a daring man. Strangers they were to
him, till he gained knowledge of them there.

"The hoard of Nibelung was borne entire from out a hollow hill. Now hear
a wondrous tale, of how the liegemen of Nibelung wished to divide it
there. This the hero Siegfried saw and much it gan wonder him. So near
was he now come to them, that he beheld the heroes, and the knights
espied him, too. One among them spake:

'Here cometh the mighty Siegfried, the hero of Netherland.' Passing
strange were the tidings that, he found among the Nibelungs. Schilbung
and Nibelung greeted well the knight; with one accord these young and
noble lordings bade the stately man divide the hoard. Eagerly they asked
it, and the lord in turn gan vow it to them.

"He beheld such store of gems, as we have heard said, that a hundred
wains might not bear the lead; still more was there of ruddy gold from
the Nibelung land. All this the hand of the daring Siegfried should
divide. As a guerdon they gave him the sword of Nibelung, but they were
served full ill by the service which the good knight Siegfried should
render them. Nor could he end it for them; angry of mood \[6\] they
grew. Twelve bold men of their kith were there, mighty giants these.
What might that avail them! Siegfried's hand slew them soon in wrath,
and seven hundred warriors from the Nibelung land he vanquished with the
good sword Balmung. \[7\] Because of the great fear that, many a young
warrior had of the sword and of the valiant man, they made the land and
its castles subject to his hand. Likewise both the mighty kings he slew,
but soon he himself was sorely pressed by Alberich. \[8\] The latter
weened to venge straightway his masters, till he then discovered
Siegfried's mighty strength; for no match for him was the sturdy dwarf.
Like wild lions they ran to the hill, where from Alberich he won the
Cloak of Darkness. \[9\] Thus did Siegfried, the terrible, become master
of the hoard; those who had dared the combat, all lay there slain. Soon
bade he cart and bear the treasure to the place from whence the men of
Nibelung had borne it forth. He made Alberich, the strong, warden of the
hoard and bade him swear an oath to serve him as his knave; and fit he
was for work of every sort."

So spake Hagen of Troneg: "This he hath done. Nevermore did warrior win
such mighty strength. I wot yet more of him: it is known to me that the
hero slew a dragon and bathed him in the blood, so that his skin became
like horn. Therefore no weapons will cut him, as hath full oft been
seen. All the better must we greet this lord, that we may not earn the
youthful warrior's hate. So bold is he that we should hold him as a
friend, for he hath wrought full many a wonder by his strength."

Then spake the mighty king: "Thou mayst well have right. Behold how
valiantly he with his knights doth stand in lust of battle, the daring
man! Let us go down to meet the warrior."

"That ye may do with honor," spake then Hagen; "he is of noble race, son
of a mighty king. God wot, methinks, he beareth him in such wise, that
it can be no little matter for which he hath ridden hither."

"Now be he welcome to us," spake then the king of the land. "He is both
noble and brave, as I have heard full well. This shall stand him in good
stead in the Burgundian land." Then went Lord Gunther to where Siegfried
stood.

The host and his warriors received the guest in such wise that full
little was there lack of worship. Low bowed the stately man, that they
had greeted him so fair. "It wondereth me," spake the king straightway,
"whence ye, noble Siegfried, be come unto this land, or what ye seek at
Worms upon the Rhine."

Then the stranger made answer to the king: "This will I not conceal from
you. Tales were told me in my father's land, that here with you were the
boldest warriors that ever king did gain. This I have often heard, and
that I might know it of a truth, therefore am I come. Likewise do I hear
boasting of your valor, that no bolder king hath ever been seen. This
the folk relate much through all these lands. Therefore will I not turn
back, till it be known to me. I also am a warrior and was to wear a
crown. Fain would I bring it to pass that it may be said of me:

Rightly doth he rule both folk and land. Of this shall my head and honor
be a pledge. Now be ye so bold, as hath been told me, I reck not be it
lief or loth to any man, I will gain from you whatso ye have--land and
castles shall be subject to my hand."

The king had likewise his men had marvel at the tidings they here heard,
that he was willed to take from them their land. The knights waxed
wroth, as they heard this word. "How have I earned this," spake Gunther,
the knight, "that we should lose by the force of any man that which my
father hath rules so long with honor? We should let it ill appear that
we, too, are used in knightly ways."

"In no wise will I desist," spake again the valiant man. "Unless it be
that through thy strength thy land have peace, I will rule it all. And
shouldst thou gain, by thy strength, my ancestral lands, they shall be
subject to thy sway. Thy lands, and mine as well, shall lie alike;
whether of us twain can triumph over the other, him shall both land and
people serve."

Hagen and Gernot, too, straightway gainsaid this. "We have no wish,"
spake Gernot, "that we should conquer aught of lands, or that any man
lie dead at hero's hands. We have rich lands, which serve us, as is
meet, nor hath any a better claim to them than we."

There stood his kinsmen, grim of mood; among them, too, Ortwin of Metz.
"It doth irk me much to hear these words of peace," spake he; "the
mighty Siegfried hath defied you for no just cause. Had ye and your
brothers no meet defense, and even if he led a kingly troop, I trow well
so to fight that the daring man have good cause to leave this haughty
mien."

At this the hero of Netherland grew wonderly wroth. He spake:

"Thy hand shall not presume against me. I am a mighty king, a king's
vassal thou. Twelve of thy ilk durst not match me in strife."

Then Ortwin of Metz called loudly for swords. Well was he fit to be
Hagen of Troneg's sister's son. It rued the king that he had held his
peace so long. Then Gernot, the bold and lusty knight, came in between.
He spake to Ortwin: "Now give over thy anger. Lord Siegfried hath done
us no such wrong, but that we may still part the strife in courteous
wise. Be advised of me and hold him still as friend; far better will
this beseem us."

Then spake the doughty Hagen: "It may well grieve us and all thy knights
that he ever rode for battle to the Rhine. He should have given it over;
my lordings never would have done such ill to him."

To this Siegfried, the mighty man, made answer: "Doth this irk you, Sir
Hagen, which I spake, then will I let you see that my hands shall have
dominion here in the Burgundian land."

"I alone will hinder this," answered Gernot, and he forbade his knights
speak aught with haughtiness that might cause rue. Siegfried, too, then
bethought him of the noble maid.

"How might it beseem us to fight with you?" spake Gernot anew. "However
really heroes should lie dead because of this, we should have scant
honor therefrom and ye but little gain."

To this Siegfried, the son of Siegmund, made reply: "Why waiteth Hagen,
and Ortwin, too, that he hasteth not to fight with his kin, of whom he
hath so many here in Burgundy?"

At this all held their peace; such was Gernot's counsel. Then spake
Queen Uta's son: "Ye shall be welcome to us with all your war-mates, who
are come with you. We shall gladly serve you, I and all my kin."

Then for the guests they bade pour out King Gunther's wine. The master
of the land then spake: "All that we have, if ye desire it in honorable
wise, shall owe fealty to you; with you shall both life and goods be
shared."

At this Lord Siegfried grew of somewhat gentler mood. Then they bade
that care be taken of the armor of the guests. The best of hostels that
men might find were sought for Siegfried's squires; great easement they
gave them. Thereafter they gladly saw the guest in Burgundy. Many a day
they offered him great worship, a thousand fold more than I can tell
you. This his prowess wrought; ye may well believe, full scant a one he
saw who was his foe.

Whenever the lordings and their liegemen did play at knightly games,
Siegfried was aye the best, whatever they began. Herein could no one
match him, so mighty was his strength, whether they threw the stone or
hurled the shaft. When through courtesie the full lusty knights made
merry with the ladies, there were they glad to see the hero of
Netherland, for upon high love his heart was bent. He was aye ready for
whatso they undertook, but in his heart he bare a lovely maid, whom he
had never seen. She too, who in secret spake full well of him, cherished
him alone. Whenever the pages, squires, and knights would play their
games within the court, Kriemhild, the noble queen, watched them from
the windows, for no other pastime she needed on such days. Had he known
that she gazed on him thus, whom he bare within his heart, then had he
had pastime enough, I trow, for well I wot that no greater joy in all
this world could chance to him.

Whenever he stood by the heroes in the court, as men still are wont to
do, for pastime's sake, so winsome was the posture of Siegelind's son,
that many a lady loved him for very joy of heart. But he bethought him
many a day: "How shall that hap, that I with mine own eyes may see the
noble maid, whom I do love with all my heart and so have done long time.
Sadly must I stand, sith she be still a stranger to me."

Whenever the mighty kings fared forth into their land, the warriors all
must needs accompany them at hand, and Siegfried, too. This the lady
rued, and he, too, suffered many pangs for love of her. Thus he dwelt
with the lordings, of a truth, full a year in Gunther's land, and in all
this time he saw not once the lovely maid, from whom in later days there
happed to him much joy and eke much woe.

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] "Guest" translates here the M.H.G. "gest", a word which may mean
either 'guest' or 'stranger,' and it is often difficult, as here, to
tell to which meaning the preference should be given.

\[2\] "Eleven" translates the M.H.G. "selbe zwelfte", which means one of
twelve. The accounts are, however, contradictory, as a few lines below
mention is made of twelve companions of Siegfried.

\[3\] "Vair" (O.F. "vair", Lat. "varius"), 'variegated', like the fur of
the squirrel.

\[4\] "Known". It was a mark of the experienced warrior, that he was
acquainted with the customs and dress of various countries and with the
names and lineage of all important personages. Thus in the
"Hildebrandslied" Hildebrand asks Hadubrand to tell him his father's
name, and adds: "If thou tellest me the one, I shall know the other."

\[5\] "Schilbung" and "Nibelung", here spoken of as the sons of a mighty
king, were originally dwarfs, and, according to some authorities, the
original owners of the treasure. Boer, ix, 199, thinks, however, that
the name Nibelungs was transferred from Hagen to these dwarfs at a late
stage in the formation of the saga.

\[6\] "Angry of mood". The reason of this anger is apparent from the
more detailed account in "Biterolf", 7801. The quarrel arose from the
fact that, according to ancient law, Siegfried acquired with the sword
the rights of the first born, which the brothers, however, refused to
accord to him.

\[7\] "Balmung". In the older Norse version and in the "Thidreksaga"
Siegfried's sword bore the name of Gram.

\[8\] "Alberich" is a dwarf king who appears in a number of legends,
e.g., in the "Ortnit saga" and in "Biterolf". Under the Romance form of
his name, "Oberon", he plays an important role in modern literature.

\[9\] "Cloak of Darkness". This translates the M.H.G. "tarnkappe", a
word often retained by translators. It is formed from O.H.G. tarni,
'secret' (cf. O.E. "dyrne"), and "kappe" from late Latin "cappa",
'cloak'. It rendered the wearer invisible and gave him the strength of
twelve men.
