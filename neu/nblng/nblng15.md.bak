# ADVENTURE XIII

## How They Journeyed To The Feasting.

Let us now take leave of all their bustling, and tell how Lady Kriemhild
and her maidens journeyed from the Nibelung land down toward the Rhine.
Never did sumpters bear so much lordly raiment. They made ready for the
way full many traveling chests. Then Siegfried, the knight, and the
queen as well, rode forth with their friends to where they had hope of
joys. Later it sped them all to their great harm. They left Siegfried's
little child, Kriemhild's son, at home. That must needs be. Great grief
befell him through their journey to the court. The bairn never saw his
father and his mother more. With them, too, there rode Lord Siegmund.
Had he known aright how he would fare at the feasting, no whit of it
would he have seen. No greater woe might ever hap to him in loving
friends.

Messengers were sent ahead, who told the tale. Then with a stately band
there rode to meet them many of Uta's kith and Gunther's liegemen. The
host gan bestir him for his guests. He went to where Brunhild sate and
asked: "How did my sister greet you when ye came to our land? In like
manner must ye greet Siegfried's wife."

"That will I gladly," quoth she, "for I have good cause to be her
friend."

The mighty king spake further: "They come to us early on the morrow; if
ye would greet them, set quickly to work, that we abide them not within
the castle. At no time have such welcome guests ever come to see me."

At once she bade her maids and ladies hunt out goodly raiment, the best
they had, the which her train should wear before the guests. One may
lightly say, they did this gladly. Gunther's men hasted also for to
serve them, and around him the host did gather all his knights. Then the
queen rode forth in princely wise and mickle greeting of the welcome
guests was done. With what great joy did they receive them! It thought
them as though Lady Kriemhild had not greeted Lady Brunhild so fair in
the Burgundian land. Those who had never seen her became acquaint with
lofty mood.

Now was Siegfried come with his liegemen. One saw the heroes wending to
and fro upon the plain in unwieldy bands. None might guard him there
against the jostling and the dust.

When that the ruler of the land spied Siegfried and Siegmund, how
lovingly he spake: "Now be ye full welcome to me and all my friends; we
shall be of good cheer because of this your journey to our court."

"Now God requite you," quoth Siegmund, the honor-seeking man; "sith my
son Siegfried won you to kinsman, my heart hath urged that I should go
to see you."

At this spake Gunther: "Now hath joy happed to me thereby."

Siegfried was received with much great worship as beseemed him; none
bare him hatred there. Giselher and Gernot helped thereby with great
courtesie. I ween, never have guests been greeted in such goodly wise.

Then the wives of the two kings drew near each other. Emptied were many
saddles, as fair ladies were lifted down by knightly hands upon the
sward. How busy were those who gladly served the dames! The lovely women
now drew near each other, and many a knight was blithe, that such fair
greeting passed between the twain. Then one saw great press of warriors
standing by the high-born maids. The lordly meiny \[1\] grasped each
other by the hand. Much courteous bowing was seen and loving kisses from
fair-fashioned dames. This liked well Gunther's and Siegfried's liegemen
for to see. They bided now no longer, but rode to town. The host bade
show his guests full well that all were fain to see them in the
Burgundian land. Many a royal joust took place before the high-born
maids. Hagen of Troneg and Ortwin, too, proved full well their prowess.
One durst not leave undone whatso they would command. Much service was
rendered by them to the welcome guests. Many shields were heard resound
from thrusts and blows before the castle gate. The host and his guests
tarried long time without, or ever they came within. Forsooth the hours
passed quickly for them with their sports. Merrily they rode before the
royal palace. Many cunning housings \[2\] of good cloth and well cut
were seen hanging on either side from the saddles of the fair-fashioned
dames.

Then came Gunther's liegemen. Men bade lead the strangers quickly to
their easement. At times one saw Brunhild glance at Lady Kriemhild, who
was passing fair enow. Her color against the gold gave back the gleam in
lovely wise. On every side in Worms one heard the courtiers shout.
Gunther bade Dankwart, his marshal, have them in his care, who then gan
lodge the retinue in goodly wise. One let them eat within and eke
without. Never were stranger guests better cared for. Men gave them
gladly all they craved; so rich was the king, that not a wish was there
denied. Men served them in friendly wise without all hate. The host now
took his seat at table with his guests. One bade Siegfried be seated
where he sate afore. Then many a stately man went with him to the seats.
Twelve hundred warriors in sooth did sit at his round table. Brunhild
thought her that a vassal could not be mightier than he; yet she was
still so friendly to him that she did not wish his death.

On an evening when the king was seated at the board, many costly robes
were wet with wine, as the butlers hied them to the tables. Full service
was given there with mickle zeal. As hath long been the wont at feasts,
men bade the ladies and the maids be given fair lodgment. From wherever
they were come, the host bare them right good will. One gave them all
enow with goodly honors.

When the night had an end and the day appeared, many a precious stone
from the sumpter chests sparkled on goodly weeds, as they were touched
by woman's hand. Many a lordly robe was taken forth. Or ever the day had
fully dawned, many knights and squires came out before the hall. Then
rose a merry rout before the early mass, which was sung for the king.
There young heroes rode so well that the king did cry them mercy. Many a
trumpet rang out passing loud, and the noise of drums and flutes did
grow so great that the broad town of Worms reechoed with the sound. The
high-mettled heroes horsed them everywhere. Then there rose in the land
high knightly play from many a doughty champion; one saw a great rout of
them whose youthful hearts beat high, and many a dapper knight and a
good stood armed with shield. At the easements sate the high-born dames
and many comely maids, decked out in brave attire. They watched the
pastimes of the many valiant men. The host himself gan tilt there with
his friends. Thus they passed the time, the which seemed aught but long.

Then from the dome was heard the sound of many bells. The palfreys came,
the ladies rode away; but many a bold man followed the noble queens.
They alighted on the green before the minster;

Brunhild was still friendly to her guests. Wearing crowns, they entered
the spacious church. Later their love was parted, which caused great
hate. When they had heard the mass, they rode away again with many
honors and were soon seen going merrily to table. Their pleasure at the
feasting did not flag until the eleventh day.
