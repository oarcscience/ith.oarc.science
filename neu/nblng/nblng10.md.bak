# ADVENTURE VIII \[1\]

## How Siegfried Fared To His Men-At-Arms, the Nibelungs.

Through the gate Siegfried hied him in his Cloak of Darkness down to the
sand, where he found a skiff. Secretly the son of Siegmund embarked and
drove it quickly hence, as though the wind did blow it on. None saw the
steersman; the bark fared fast, impelled by Siegfried's mighty strength.
They weened a seldom strong wind did drive it on. Nay, it was rowed by
Siegfried, the son of Siegelind, the fair. In the time of a day and
night with might and main he reached a land full hundred rests \[2\]
away, or more. The people hight Nibelungs, where he owned the mighty
hoard. The hero rowed alone to a broad isle, where the lusty knight now
beached the boat and made it fast full soon. To a hill he hied him, upon
which stood a castle, and sought here lodgment, as way-worn travelers
do. He came first to a gateway that stood fast locked. In sooth they
guarded well their honor, as men still do. The stranger now gan knock
upon the door, the which was closely guarded. There within he saw a
giant standing, who kept the castle and at whose side lay at all times
his arms. He spake: "Who is it who doth knock so rudely on the gate?"

Then bold Siegfried changed his voice and spake: "I am a knight; do up
the door, else will I enrage many a one outside to-day, who would liefer
lie soft and take his ease."

When Siegfried thus spake, it irked the warder. Meanwhile the giant had
donned his armor and placed his helm upon his head. Quickly the mighty
man snatched up his shield and opened wide the gate. How fiercely he ran
at Siegfried and asked, how he durst wake so many valiant men? Huge
blows were dealt out by his hand. Then the lordly stranger gan defend
him, but with an iron bar the warder shattered his shield-plates. Then
was the hero in dire need. Siegfried gan fear a deal his death, when the
warder struck such mighty blows. Enow his master Siegfried loved him for
this cause. They strove so sore that all the castle rang and the sound
was heard in Nibelung's hall. He overcame the warder and bound him, too.

The tale was noised abroad in all the Nibelungs' land. Alberich, the
bold, a savage dwarf, heard the fierce struggle through the mountain. He
armed him quick and ran to where he found the noble stranger, as he
bound the mighty giant. Full wroth was Alberich and strong enow. On his
body he bare helmet and rings of mail and in his hand a heavy scourge of
gold. Swift and hard he ran to where Siegfried stood. Seven heavy knobs
\[3\] hung down in front, with which he smote so fiercely the shield
upon the bold man's arm, that it brake in parts. The stately stranger
came in danger of his life. From his hand he flung the broken shield and
thrust into the sheath a sword, the which was long. He would not strike
his servant dead, but showed his courtly breeding as his knightly virtue
bade him. He rushed at Alberich and with his powerful hands he seized
the gray-haired man by the beard. So roughly he pulled his beard, that
he screamed aloud. The tugging of the youthful knight hurt Alberich
sore.

Loud cried the valiant dwarf: "Now spare my life. And might I be the
vassal of any save one knight, to whom I swore an oath that I would own
him as my lord, I'd serve you till my death." So spake the cunning \[4\]
man.

He then bound Alberich as he had the giant afore. Full sore the strength
of Siegfried hurt him. The dwarf gan ask: "How are ye named?"

"My name is Siegfried," he replied; "I deemed ye knew me well."

"Well is me of these tidings," spake Alberich, the dwarf. "Now have I
noted well the knightly deeds, through which ye be by right the sovran
of the land. I'll do whatso ye bid, and ye let me live."

Then spake Sir Siegfried: "Go quickly now and bring me the best of
knights we have, a thousand Nibelungs, that they may see me here."

Why he wanted this, none heard him say. He loosed the bonds of Alberich
and the giant. Then ran Alberich swift to where he found the knights. In
fear he waked the Nibelung men. He spake:

"Up now, ye heroes, ye must go to Siegfried."

From their beds they sprang and were ready in a trice. A thousand
doughty knights soon stood well clad. They hied them to where they saw
Sir Siegfried stand. Then was done a fair greeting, in part by deeds.
Great store of tapers were now lit up; they proffered him mulled wine.
\[5\] He gave them thanks that they were come so soon. He spake: "Ye
must away with me across the flood."

Full ready for this he found the heroes brave and good. Well thirty
hundred men were come eftsoon, from whom he chose a thousand of the
best. Men brought them their helmets and other arms, for he would lead
them to Brunhild's land. He spake: "Ye good knights, this will I tell
you, ye must wear full costly garments there at court, for many lovely
dames shall gaze upon us. Therefore must ye deck yourselves with goodly
weeds."

Early on a morn they started on their way. What a speedy journey
Siegfried won! They took with them good steeds and lordly harness, and
thus they came in knightly wise to Brunhild's land.

The fair maids stood upon the battlements. Then spake the queen:

"Knoweth any, who they be whom I see sailing yonder far out upon the
sea? They have rich sails e'en whiter than the snow."

Quoth the king of the Rhineland: "They're men of mine, the which I left
hard by here on the way. I had them sent for, and now they be come, my
lady." All eyes were fixed upon the lordly strangers.

Then one spied Siegfried standing at his vessel's prow in lordly weeds
and many other men. The queen spake: "Sir King, pray tell me, shall I
receive the strangers or shall I deny them greetings?"

He spake: "Ye must go to meet them out before the palace, that they may
well perceive how fain we be to see them here."

Then the queen did as the king advised her. She marked out Siegfried
with her greetings from the rest. Men purveyed them lodgings and took in
charge their trappings. So many strangers were now come to the land,
that everywhere they jostled Brunhild's bands. Now would the valiant men
fare home to Burgundy.

Then spake the queen: "My favor would I bestow on him who could deal out
to the king's guests and mine my silver and gold, of which I have such
store."

To this Dankwart, King Giselher's liegeman, answered: "Most noble
queen," spake the brave knight, "let me but wield the keys. I trow to
deal it out in fitting wise; whatso of blame I gain, let be mine own."
That he was bountiful, he made appear full well.

When now Sir Hagen's brother took the keys in charge, the hero's hand
did proffer many a costly gift. He who craved a mark \[6\] received such
store that all the poor might lead a merry life. Full hundred pounds he
gave, nor did he stop to count. Enow walked before the hall in rich
attire, who never had worn afore such lordly dress. Full sore it rued
the queen when this she heard. She spake: "Sir King, I fain would have
your aid, lest your chamberlain leave naught of all my store of dress;
he squandereth eke my gold. If any would forfend this, I'd be his friend
for aye. He giveth such royal gifts, the knight must ween, forsooth,
that I have sent for death. I would fain use it longer and trow well
myself to waste that which my father left me." No queen as yet hath ever
had so bounteous a chamberlain.

Then spake Hagen of Troneg: "My lady, be it told you that the king of
the Rhineland hath such great store of gold and robes to give, that we
have no need to carry hence aught of Brunhild's weeds."

"Nay, and ye love me," spake the queen, "let me fill twenty traveling
chests with gold and silk as well, the which my hand shall give, when we
are come across to Gunther's land."

Men filled her chests with precious stones, the while her chamberlains
stood by. She would not trust the duty to Giselher's men. Gunther and
Hagen began to laugh thereat.

Then spake the queen: "With whom shall I leave my lands? This my hand
and yours must first decree."

Quoth the noble king: "Now bid draw near whom ye deem fit and we will
make him steward."

The lady spied near by one of her highest kin (it was her mother's
brother); to him the maiden spake: "Now let be commended to your care my
castles and my lands, till that King Gunther's hand rule here."

Then twenty hundred of her men she chose, who should fare with her hence
to Burgundy, together with those thousand warriors from the Nibelung
land. They dressed their journey; one saw them riding forth upon the
sand. Six and eighty dames they took along and thereto a hundred maids,
their bodies passing fair. No longer now they tarried, for they were
fain to get them hence. Ho, what great wail was made by those they left
at home! In courtly wise she voided thus her land. She kissed her
nearest kinsmen who were found at court. After a fair leave-taking they
journeyed to the sea. To her fatherland the lady nevermore returned.
Many kinds of games were seen upon the way; pastimes they had galore. A
real sea breeze did help them on their voyage. Thus they fared forth
from the land fully merrily. She would not let her husband court her on
the way; this pleasure was deferred until their wedding-tide in the
castle, their home, at Worms, to which in good time she came right
joyfully with all her knights.

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] Adventure VIII. This whole episode, in which Siegfried fetches men
to aid Gunther in case of attempted treachery on Brunhild's part, is of
late origin and has no counterpart in the older versions. It is a
further development of Siegfried's fight in which he slew Schilbung and
Nibelung and became the ruler of the Nibelung land. The fight with
Alberich is simply a repetition of the one in the former episode.

\[2\] "Rest" (M.H.G. "rast"), originally 'repose', then used as a
measure of distance, as here.

\[3\] "Knobs", round pieces of metal fastened to the scourge.

\[4\] "Cunning" is to be taken here in the Biblical sense of 'knowing'.
The M.H.G. "listig" which it here translates, denotes 'skilled' or
'learned' in various arts and is a standing epithet of dwarfs.

\[5\] "Mulled wine" translates M.H.G. "lutertranc", a claret mulled with
herbs and spice and left to stand until clear.

\[6\] "Mark". See Adventure V, note 5.
