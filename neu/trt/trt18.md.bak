### VII

### AN ADVENTURE OF SIR GAWAINE

Sir Gawaine rode long without meeting any adventure, and from Pentecost
to Michaelmas found none that pleased him. But at Michaelmas he met Sir
Ector de Maris and rejoiced greatly.

As they sat talking there appeared before them a hand showing unto the
elbow covered with red samite, and holding a great candle that burned
right clear; and the hand passed into the chapel and vanished, they know
not where. Then they heard a voice which said, 'Knights full of evil
faith and poor belief, these two things have failed you, and therefore
you may not come to the adventure of the Holy Graal.' And this same told
them a holy man to whom they confessed their sins, 'for,' said he, 'you
have failed in three things, charity, fasting, and truth, and have been
great murderers. But sinful as Sir Lancelot was, since he went into the
quest he never slew man, nor shall, till he come into Camelot again. For
he has taken upon him to forsake sin. And were he not so unstable, he
should be the next to achieve it, after Galahad his son. Yet shall he
die an holy man, and in earthly sinful men he has no fellow.'

'Sir,' said Gawaine, 'by your words it seems that our sins will not let
us labour in that quest?' 'Truly,' answered the hermit, 'there be an
hundred such as you to whom it will bring naught but shame.' So Gawaine
departed and followed Sir Ector, who had ridden on before.
