### SIR LANCELOT MEETS SIR GALAHAD, AND THEY PART FOR EVER

Now we must tell what happened to Sir Lancelot.

When he was come to a water called Mortoise he fell asleep, awaiting for
the adventure that should be sent to him, and in his sleep a voice spoke
to him, and bade him rise and take his armour, and enter the first ship
he should find. So he started up and took his arms and made him ready,
and on the strand he found a ship that was without sail or oar. As soon
as he was within the ship, he felt himself wrapped round with a
sweetness such as he had never known before, as if all that he could
desire was fulfilled. And with this joy and peace about him he fell
asleep. When he woke he found near him a fair bed, with a dead lady
lying on it, whom he knew to be Sir Percivale's sister, and in her hand
was the tale of her adventures, which Sir Lancelot took and read. For a
month or more they dwelt in that ship together, and one day, when it had
drifted near the shore, he heard a sound as of a horse; and when the
steps came nearer he saw that a Knight was riding him. At the sight of
the ship the Knight alighted and took the saddle and bridle, and entered
the ship. 'You are welcome,' said Lancelot, and the Knight saluted him
and said, 'What is your name? for my heart goeth out to you.'

'Truly,' answered he, 'my name is Sir Lancelot du Lake.'

'Sir,' said the new Knight, 'you are welcome, for you were the beginner
of me in the world.'

'Ah,' cried Sir Lancelot, 'is it you, then, Galahad?'

'Yes, in sooth,' said he, and kneeled down and asked

\[paragraph continues\] Lancelot's blessing, and then took off his helm
and kissed him. And there was great joy between them, and they told each
other all that had befallen them since they left King Arthur's Court.
Then Galahad saw the gentlewoman dead on the bed, and he knew her, and
said he held her in great worship, and that she was the best maid in the
world, and how it was great pity that she had come to her death. But
when Lancelot heard that Galahad had won the marvellous sword he prayed
that he might see it, and kissed the pommel and the hilt, and the
scabbard. 'In truth,' he said, 'never did I know of adventures so
wonderful and strange.' So dwelled Lancelot and Galahad in that ship for
half a year, and served God daily and nightly with all their power. And
after six months had gone it befell that on a Monday they drifted to the
edge of the forest, where they saw a Knight with white armour bestriding
one horse and holding another all white, by the bridle. And he came to
the ship, and saluted the two Knights and said, 'Galahad, you have been
long enough with your father, therefore leave that ship and start upon
this horse, and go on the quest of the Holy Graal.' So Galahad went to
his father and kissed him, saying, 'Fair sweet father, I know not if I
shall see you more till I have beheld the Holy Graal.' Then they heard a
voice which said, 'The one shall never see the other till the day of
doom.' 'Now, Galahad,' said Lancelot, 'since we are to bid farewell for
ever now, I pray to the great Father to preserve me and you both.'
'Sir,' answered Galahad, I no prayer availeth so much as yours.'

The next day Sir Lancelot made his way back to Camelot, where he found
King Arthur and Guenevere; but many of the Knights of the Round Table
were slain and destroyed more than the half. All the Court was passing
glad to see Sir Lancelot, and the King asked many tidings of his son Sir
Galahad.
