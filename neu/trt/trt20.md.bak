### IX

### ADVENTURE OF SIR GALAHAD

Sir Galahad rested one evening at a hermitage. And while he was resting,
there came a gentlewoman and asked leave of the hermit to speak with Sir
Galahad, and would not be denied, though she was told he was weary and
asleep. Then the hermit waked Sir Galahad and bade him rise, as a
gentlewoman had great need of him, so Sir Galahad rose and asked her
what she wished. 'Galahad,' said she, 'I will that you arm yourself, and
mount your horse and follow me, and I will show you the highest
adventure that ever any Knight saw.' And Sir Galahad bade her go, and he
would follow wherever she led. In three days they reached the sea, where
they found the ship where Sir Bors and Sir Percivale were lying. And the
lady bade him leave his horse behind and said she would leave hers also,
but their saddles and bridles they would take on board the ship. This
they did, and were received with great joy by the two Knights; then the
sails were spread, and the ship was driven before the wind at a
marvellous pace till they reached the land of Logris, the entrance to
which lies between two great rocks with a whirlpool in the middle.

Their own ship might not get safely through; but they left it and went
into another ship that lay there, which had neither man nor woman in it.
At the end of the ship was written these words: 'Thou man which shall
enter this ship beware thou be in steadfast belief; if thou fail, I
shall not help thee.' Then the gentlewoman turned and said, 'Percivale,
do you know who I am?' 'No, truly,' answered he. 'I am your sister, and
therefore you are the man in the world

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

that I most love. If you are without faith, or have any hidden sin,
beware how you enter, else you will perish.' 'Fair sister,' answered he,
'I shall enter therein, for if I am an untrue Knight then shall I
perish.' So they entered the ship, and it was rich and well adorned,
that they all marvelled.

In the midst of it was a fair bed, and Sir Galahad went thereto and
found on it a crown of silk, and a sword drawn out of its sheath half a
foot and more. The sword was of divers fashions, and the pommel of
stone, wrought about with colours, and every colour with its own virtue,
and the handle was of the ribs of two beasts. The one was the bone of a
serpent, and no hand that handles it shall ever become weary or hurt;
and the other is the bone of a fish that swims in Euphrates, and whoso
handles it shall not think on joy or sorrow that he has had, but only on
that which he beholds before him. And no man shall grip this sword but
one that is better than other men. So first Sir Percivale stepped
forward and set his hand to the sword, but he might not grasp it. Next
Sir Bors tried to seize it, but he also failed. When Sir Galahad beheld
the sword, he saw that there was written on it, in letters of blood,
that he who tried to draw it should never fail of shame in his body or
be wounded to the death. 'By my faith,' said Galahad, 'I would draw this
sword out of its sheath, but the offending is so great I shall not lay
my hand thereto.' 'Sir,' answered the gentlewoman, 'know that no man can
draw this sword save you alone'; and she told him many tales of the
Knights who had set their hands to it, and of the evil things that had
befallen them. And they all begged Sir Galahad to grip the sword, as it
was ordained that he should. 'I will grip it,' said Galahad, 'to give
you courage, but it belongs no more to me than it does to you.' Then he
gripped it tight with his fingers, and the gentlewoman girt him about
the middle with the sword, and after that they left that ship and went
into

another, which brought them to land, where they fell upon many strange
adventures. And when they had wrought many great deeds, they departed
from each other. But first Sir Percivale's sister died, being bled to
death, so that another lady might live, and she prayed them to lay her
body in a boat and leave the boat to go as the winds and waves carried
it. And so it was done, and Sir Percivale wrote a letter telling how she
had helped them in all their adventures; and he put it in her right
hand, and laid her in a barge, and covered it with black silk. And the
wind arose and drove it from their sight.
