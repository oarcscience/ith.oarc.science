### IV

### HOW SIR LANCELOT SAW A VISION, AND REPENTED OF HIS SINS

He halted when he came to a stone cross, which had by it a block of
marble, while nigh at hand stood an old chapel. He tied his horse to a
tree, and hung his shield on a branch, and looked into the chapel, for
the door was waste and broken. And he saw there a fair altar covered
with a silken cloth, and a candlestick which had six branches, all of
shining silver. A great light streamed from it, and at this sight Sir
Lancelot would fain have entered in, but he could not. So he turned back
sorrowful and dismayed, and took the saddle and bridle off his horse,
and let him pasture where he would, while he himself unlaced his helm,
and ungirded his sword, and lay down to sleep upon his shield, at the
foot of the cross.

As he lay there, half waking and half sleeping, he saw two white
palfreys come by, drawing a litter, wherein lay a sick Knight. When they
reached the cross they paused, and Sir Lancelot heard the Knight say, 'O
sweet Lord, when shall this sorrow leave me, and when shall the Holy
Vessel come by me, through which I shall be blessed? For I have endured
long, though my ill deeds were few.' Thus he spoke, and Sir Lancelot
heard it, and of a sudden the great candlestick stood before the cross,
though no man had brought it. And with it was a table of silver and the
Holy Vessel of the Graal, which Lancelot had seen aforetime. Then

the Knight rose up, and on his hands and knees he approached the Holy
Vessel, and prayed, and was made whole of his sickness. After that the
Graal went back into the chapel, and the light and the candlestick also,
and Sir Lancelot would fain have followed, but could not, so heavy was
the weight of his sins upon him. And the sick Knight arose and kissed
the cross, and saw Sir Lancelot lying at the foot with his eyes shut. 'I
marvel greatly at this sleeping Knight,' he said to his squire, 'that he
had no power to wake when the Holy Vessel was brought hither.' 'I dare
right well say,' answered the squire, 'that he dwelleth in some deadly
sin, whereof he was never confessed.' 'By my faith,' said the Knight,
'he is unhappy, whoever he is, for he is of the fellowship of the Round
Table, which have undertaken the quest of the Graal.' 'Sir,' replied the
squire, 'you have all your arms here, save only your sword and your
helm. Take therefore those of this strange Knight, who has just put them
off.' And the Knight did as his squire said, and took Sir Lancelot's
horse also, for it was better than his own.

After they had gone Sir Lancelot waked up wholly, and thought of what he
had seen, wondering if he were in a dream or not. Suddenly a voice spoke
to him, and it said, 'Sir Lancelot, more hard than is the stone, more
bitter than is the wood, more naked and barren than is the leaf of the
fig tree, art thou; therefore go from hence and withdraw thee from this
holy place.' When Sir Lancelot heard this, his heart was passing heavy,
and he wept, cursing the day when he had been born. But his helm and
sword had gone from the spot where he had lain them at the foot of the
cross, and his horse was gone also. And he smote himself and cried, 'My
sin and my wickedness have done me this dishonour; for when I sought
worldly adventures for worldly desires I ever achieved them and had the
better in every place, and never was I discomfited in any quarrel, were
it right or wrong.

\[paragraph continues\] And now I take upon me the adventures of holy
things, I see and understand that my old sin hinders me, so that I could
not name nor speak when the Holy Graal passed by.' Thus he sorrowed till
it was day, and he heard the birds sing, and at that he felt comforted.
And as his horse was gone also, he departed on foot with a heavy heart.
