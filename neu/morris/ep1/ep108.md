### APRIL.

O FAIR midspring, besung so oft and oft,  
How can I praise thy loveliness enow?  
Thy sun that burns not, and thy breezes soft  
That o’er the blossoms of the orchard blow,  
The thousand things that ’neath the young leaves grow,  
The hopes and chances of the growing year,  
Winter forgotten long, and summer near.

   When Summer brings the lily and the rose,  
She brings us fear; her very death she brings  
Hid in her anxious heart, the forge of woes;  
And, dull with fear, no more the mavis sings.  
But thou! thou diest not, but thy fresh life clings  
About the fainting autumn's sweet decay,  
When in' the earth the hopeful seed they lay.

   Ah! life of all the year, why yet do I  
Amid thy snowy blossoms’ fragrant drift,  
Still long for that which never draweth nigh,  
Striving my pleasure from my pain to sift,  
Some weight from off my fluttering mirth to lift?  
—Now, when far bells are ringing, "Come again,  
Come back, past years! why will ye pass in vain?"

AND now the watery April sun lit up  
Upon the fair board golden ewer and cup,  
And over the bright silken tapestry  
The fresh young boughs were gladdening every eye,  
And round the board old faces you might see  
Amidst the blossoms and their greenery.  
   So when the flutes were silent, and the birds,  
Rejoicing in their flood of unknown words,  
Were heard again, a silken-fastened book  
A certain elder from his raiment took,  
And said, "O friends, few words are best to-day,  
And no new thing I bring you; yet ye may  
Be pleased to hear an ancient tale again,  
That, told so long ago, doth yet remain  
Fresh e’en ’mongst us, far from the Argive land:  
Which tale this book, writ wholly by mine hand,  
Holds gathered up as I have heard it told.  
   "Surely I fear me, midst the ancient gold  
Base metal ye will light on here and there,  
Though I have noted everything with care,  
And with good will have set down nothing new:  
Nor holds the land another book for you  
That has the tale in full with nought beside,  
So unto me let your good word betide;  
Though, take it as ye may, no small delight  
I had, herein this well-loved tale to write."
