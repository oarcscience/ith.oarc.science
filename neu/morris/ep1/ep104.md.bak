### To The Reader

*THINK, listener, that I had the luck to stand,  
Awhile ago within a flowery land,  
Fair beyond words; that thence I brought away  
Some blossoms that before my footsteps lay,  
Not plucked by me, not over fresh or bright;  
Yet, since they minded me of that delight,  
Within the pages of this book I laid  
Their tender petals, there in peace to fade.  
Dry are they now, and void of all their scent  
And lovely colour, yet what once was meant  
By these dull stains, some men may yet descry  
As dead upon the quivering leaves they lie.  
   Behold them here, and mock me if you will,  
But yet believe no scorn of men can kill  
My love of that fair land wherefrom they came,  
Where midst the grass their petals once did flame*.

*   Moreover, since that land as ye should know,  
Bears not alone the gems for summer's show,  
Or gold and pearls for fresh green-coated spring,  
Or rich adornment for the flickering wing  
Of fleeting autumn, but path little fear  
For the white conqueror of the fruitful year,  
So in these pages month by month I show  
Some portion of the flowers that erst did blow  
In lovely meadows of the varying land,  
Wherein erewhile I had the luck to stand*.
