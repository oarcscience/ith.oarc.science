### THE MAN BORN TO BE KING.

#### ARGUMENT.

IT was foretold to a great king, that he who should reign after him
should be low-born and poor; which thing came to pass in the end, for
all that the king could do?

A KING there was in days of old  
Who ruled wide lands, nor lacked for gold,  
Nor honour, nor much longed-for praise,  
And his days were called happy days,  
So peaceable his kingdoms were,  
While others wrapt in war and fear  
Fell ever unto worse and worse.  
   Therefore his city was the nurse  
Of all that men then had of lore,  
And none were driven from his door  
That seemed well-skilled in anything;  
So of the sages was he king;  
And from this learned man and that,  
Little by little, lore he gat,  
And many a lordless, troubled land  
Fell scarce loth to his dreaded hand. <span id="page_138">p.
138</span>  
   Midst this it chanced that, on a day,  
Clad in his glittering gold array,  
He held a royal festival;  
And nigh him in his glorious hall  
Beheld his sages most and least,  
Sitting much honoured at the feast.  
But mid the faces so well-known,  
Of men he well might call his own,  
He saw a little wizened man  
With face grown rather grey than wan  
From lapse of years, beardless was he,  
And bald as is the winter tree;  
But his two deep-set, glittering eyes  
Gleamed at the sight of mysteries  
None knew but he; few words he said,  
And unto those small heed was paid;  
But the king, young, yet old in guile,  
Failed not to note a flickering smile  
Upon his face, as now and then  
He turned him from the learned men  
Toward the king's seat, so thought to know  
What new thing he might have to show;  
And presently, the meat being done,  
He bade them bring him to his throne,  
And when before him he was come,  
He said, "Be welcome to my home;  
What is thine art, canst thou in rhyme  
Tell stories of the ancient time?  
Or dost thou chronicle old wars? <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>  
Or know’st thou of the change of stars?  
Or seek’st thou the transmuting stone?  
Or canst thou make the shattered bone  
Grow whole, and dying men live on  
Till years like thine at last are won?  
Or what thing bring’st thou to me here,  
Where nought but men of lore are dear  
To me and mine?"  
                     "O King," said he,  
"But few things know I certainly,  
Though I have toiled for many a day  
Along the hard and doubtful way  
That bringeth wise men to the grave:  
And now for all the years I gave,  
To know all things that man can learn,  
A few months learned life I earn,  
Nor feel much liker to a god  
Than when beside my sheep I trod  
Upon the thymy, wind-swept down.  
Yet am I come unto thy town  
To tell thee somewhat that I learned  
As on the stars I gazed, and yearned  
To cast this weary body off,  
With all its chains of mock and scoff  
And creeping death—for as I read  
The sure decrees with joy and dread,  
Somewhat I saw writ down of thee,  
And who shall have the sovereignty  
When thou art gone." <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>  
                   "Nay," said the King,  
"Speak quick and tell me of the thing."  
   "Sire," said the sage, "thine ancient line  
Thou holdest as a thing divine,  
So long and undisturbed it is,  
But now shall there be end to this,  
For surely in my glittering text  
I read that he who shall sit next,  
On this thine ancient throne and high,  
Shall he no better born than I  
Whose grandsire none remembereth,  
Nor where my father first drew breath."  
   "Yea," said the King, "and this may be;  
Yet, O Sage, ere I credit thee,  
Some token certes must thou show,  
Or tell me what I think to know,  
Alone, among all folk alive;  
Then surely great gifts will I give  
To thee, and make thee head of all  
Who watch the planets rise and fall."  
   "Bid these stand backward from thy throne,"  
The sage said, "then to thee alone  
Long hidden matters will I tell;  
And then, if thou believest, well—  
And if thou dost not—well also;  
No gift I ask, but leave to go,  
For strange to me is this thy state,  
And for thyself, thou well may’st hate  
My crabbed age and misery." <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>  
   "Well," said the King, "let this thing be;  
And ye, my masters, stand aback!  
For of the fresh air have I lack,  
And in my pleasance would I walk  
To hearken this grave elder's talk  
And gain new lore."  
                        Therewith he rose  
And led the way unto a close,  
Shaded with grey-leaved olive-trees;  
And when they were amidst of these  
He turned about and said, "Speak, friend,  
And of thy folly make an end,  
And take this golden chain therefore."  
   "Rightly thou namest my weak lore,"  
The sage said, "therefore to the end  
Be wise, and what the fates may send  
Take thou, nor struggle in the net  
Wherein thine helpless feet are set!  
—Hearken! a year is well-nigh done  
Since, at the hottest of the sun,  
Stood Antony beneath this tree,  
And took a jewelled cup of thee,  
And drank swift death in guise of wine;  
Since he, most trusted of all thine,  
At last too full of knowledge grew,  
And chiefly, he of all men knew  
How the Earl Marshal Hugh had died,  
Since he had drawn him on to ride  
Into a bushment of his foes, <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>  
To meet death from unnumbered blows."  
   "Thou knowest that by me he died,"  
The King said, "How if now I cried  
Help! the magician slayeth me?"  
Swiftly should twenty sword-blades be  
Clashing within thy ribs, and thou  
Nearer to death than even now."  
   "Not thus, O King, I fear to die,"  
The Sage said; "Death shall pass me by  
Many a year yet, because perchance,  
I fear not aught his clattering dance,  
And have enough of weary days.  
—But thou—farewell, and win the praise  
Of sages, by thy hearkening  
With heed to this most certain thing.  
Fear not because this thing I know,  
For to my grey tower back I go  
High raised above the heathy hills  
Where the great erne the swift hare kills,  
Or stoops upon the new-yeaned lamb;  
There almost as a god I am  
Unto few folk, who hear thy name  
Indeed, but know nought of thy fame,  
Nay, scarce if thou be man or beast."  
So saying, back unto the feast  
He turned, and went adown the hall,  
Not heeding any gibe or call;  
And left the palace and the town  
With face turned toward his windy down. <span id="page_143">p.
143</span>  
Back to the hall, too, the King went,  
With eyes upon the pavement bent  
In pensive thought, delighting not  
In riches and his kingly lot;  
But thinking how his days began,  
And of the lonely souls of man.

   But time past, and midst this and that,  
The wise man's message he forgat;  
And as a king he lived his life,  
And took to him a noble wife  
Of the kings' daughters, rich and fair.  
And they being wed for nigh a year,  
And she now growing great with child,  
It happed unto the forest wild  
This king with many folk must ride  
At ending of the summer-tide;  
There boar and hart they brought to bay,  
And had right noble prize that day;  
But when the noon was now long past,,  
And the thick woods grew overcast,  
They roused the mightiest hart of all.  
Then loudly ’gan the king to call  
Unto his huntsmen, not to leave  
That mighty beast for dusk nor eve  
Till they had won him; with which word  
His horn he blew, and forth he spurred,  
Taking no thought of most or least,  
But only of that royal beast. <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>  
And over rough and smooth he rode,  
Nor yet for anything abode,  
Till dark night swallowing up the day  
With blindness his swift course must stay.  
Nor was there with him any one,  
So far his fair steed had outrun  
The best of all his hunting-folk.  
   So, glancing at the stars that broke  
’Twixt the thick branches here and there,  
Backward he turned, and peered with care  
Into the darkness, but saw nought,  
Nor heard his folk, and therewith thought  
His bed must be the brake leaves brown.  
Then in a while he lighted down,  
And felt about a little space,  
If he might find a softer place;  
But as he groped from tree to tree  
Some glimmering light he seemed to see  
’Twixt the dark stems, and thither turned,  
If yet perchance some wood-fire burned  
Within a peasant's hut, where he  
Might find, amidst their misery,  
Rough food, or shelter at the least.  
   So, leading on his wearied beast,  
Blindly he crept from tree to tree,  
Till slowly grew that light to be  
The thing he looked for, and he found  
A hut on a cleared space of ground,  
From whose half-opened door there streamed <span id="page_145">p.
145</span>  
The light that erst far off had gleamed.  
Then of that shelter was he fain,  
But just as he made shift to gain  
The open space in front of it,  
A shadow o’er the grass did flit,  
And on the wretched threshold stood  
A big man, with a bar of wood  
In his right hand, who seemed as though  
He got him ready for a blow;  
But ere he spoke the King cried, "Friend,  
May God good hap upon thee send,  
If thou wilt give me rest this night,  
And food according to thy might."  
   "Nay," said the carle, "my wife lieth  
In labour, and is nigh her death:  
Nor canst thou enter here at all;  
But nearby is my asses’ stall,  
Who on this night bide in the town;  
There, if thou wilt, mayst thou lie down,  
And sleep until the dawn of day,  
And I will bring thee what I may  
Of food and drink."  
                       Then said the King,  
"Thanked be thou; neither for nothing  
Shalt thou this good deed do to me."  
"Nay," said the carle, "let these things be,  
Surely I think before the morn,  
To be too weary and forlorn  
For gold much heart in me to put." <span id="page_146">p. 146</span>  
With that he turned, and from the hut  
Brought out a lantern, and rye-bread,  
And wine, and showed the king a shed,  
Strewed with a litter of dry brake:  
Withal he muttered, for his sake,  
Unto Our Lady some rude prayer,  
And turned about and left him there.  
   So when the rye-bread, nowise fine,  
The king had munched, and with green wine  
Had quenched his thirst, his horse he tied  
Unto a post, and there beside  
He fell asleep upon the brake.

   But in an hour did he awake,  
Astonied with an unnamed fear,  
For words were ringing in his ear  
Like the last echo of a scream,  
"*Take! take!*" but of the vanished dream  
No image was there left to him.  
Then, trembling sore in every limb,  
Did he arise, and drew his sword,  
And passed forth on the forest sward,  
And cautiously about he crept;  
But he heard nought at all, except  
Some groaning of the woodman's wife,  
And forest sounds well known, but rife  
With terror to the lonely soul.  
   Then he lay down again, to roll  
His limbs within his huntsman's cloak; <span id="page_147">p.
147</span>  
And slept again, and once more woke  
To tremble with that unknown fear,  
And other echoing words to hear—  
"*Give up! give up!*" nor anything  
Showed more why these strange words should ring  
About him. Then he sat upright,  
Bewildered, gazing through the night,  
Until his weary eyes, grown dim,  
Showed not the starlit tree-trunks slim  
Against the black wood, grey and plain;  
And into sleep he sank again,  
And woke not soon: but sleeping dreamed  
That he awoke, nor other seemed  
The place he woke in but that shed,  
And there beside his bracken bed  
He seemed to see the ancient sage  
Shrivelled yet more with untold age,  
Who bending down his head to him  
Said, with a mocking smile and grim,—  
"Take, or give up; what matters it?  
This child new-born shall surely sit  
Upon thy seat when thou art gone,  
And dwelling ’twixt straight walls of stone."  
   Again the King woke at that word  
And sat up, panting and afeard,  
And staring out into the night,  
Where yet the woods thought not of light;  
And fain he was to cast off sleep,  
Such visions from his eyes to keep. <span id="page_148">p. 148</span>  
Heavy his head grew none the less,  
’Twixt ’wildering thoughts and weariness,  
And soon he fell asleep once more,  
Nor dreamed, nor woke again, before  
The sun shone through the forest trees;  
And, shivering in the morning breeze,  
He blinked with just-awakened eyes,  
And pondering on those mysteries,  
Unto the woodman's hut he went.

   Him he found kneeling down, and bent  
In moody grief above a bed,  
Whereon his wife lay, stark and dead,  
Whose soul near morn had passed away;  
And ’twixt the dead and living lay  
A new-born man-child, fair and great.  
So in the door the King did wait  
To watch the man, who had no heed  
Of this or that, so sore did bleed  
The new-made wound within his heart.  
But as the King gazed, for his part  
He did but see his threatened foe,  
And ever hard his heart did grow  
With deadly hate and wilfulness:  
And sight of that poor man's distress  
Made it the harder, as of nought  
But that unbroken line he thought  
Of which he was the last: withal  
His scornful troubled eyes did fall <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>  
Upon that nest of poverty,  
Where nought of joy he seemed to see.  
   On straw the poor dead woman lay;  
The door alone let in the day,  
Showing the trodden earthen floor,  
A board on trestles weak and poor,  
Three stumps of tree for stool or chair,  
A half-glazed pipkin, nothing fair,  
A bowl of porridge by the wife  
Untouched by lips that lacked for life,  
A platter and a bowl of wood;  
And in the further corner stood  
A bow cut from the wych-elm tree,  
A holly club, and arrows three  
Ill pointed, heavy, spliced with thread.

   Ah! soothly, well remembered  
Was that unblissful wretched home,  
Those four bare walls, in days to come;  
And often in the coming years  
He called to mind the pattering tears  
That, on the rent old sackcloth cast  
About the body, fell full fast,  
’Twixt half-meant prayers and curses wild,  
And that weak wailing of the child,  
His threatened dreaded enemy,  
The mighty king that was to be.  
   But as he gazed unsoftened there,  
With hate begot of scorn and care, <span id="page_150">p. 150</span>  
Loudly he heard a great horn blow,  
And his own hunting call did know,  
And soon began the shouts to hear  
Of his own people drawing near.  
Then lifting up his horn, he blew  
A long shrill point, but as he threw  
His head aback, beheld his folk,  
Who from the close-set thicket broke  
And o’er the cleared space swiftly passed,  
With shouts that he was found at last.  
   Then turned the carle his doleful face,  
And slowly rising in his place,  
Drew thwart his eyes his fingers strong,  
And on that gay-dressed glittering throng  
Gazed stupidly, as still he heard  
The name of King; but said no word.  
   But his guest spoke, "Sirs, well be ye!  
This luckless woodman, whom ye see,  
Gave me good harbour through the night  
And such poor victual as he might;  
Therefore shall he have more than gold  
For his reward; since dead and cold  
His helpmate lies who last night died.  
See now the youngling by her side;  
Him will I take and rear him so  
That he shall no more lie alow  
In straw, or from the beech-tree dine.  
But rather use white linen fine  
And silver plate; and with the sword <span id="page_151">p. 151</span>  
Shall learn to serve some King or Lord.  
How say’st thou, good man?"  
                                    "Sire," he said,  
Weeping, but shamefaced,—"Since here dead  
She lies, that erst kept house for me,  
E’en as thou willest let it be;  
Though I had hoped to have a son  
To help me get the day's work done.  
And now, indeed, forth must he go  
If unto manhood he should grow,  
And lonely I must wander forth,  
To whom east, west, and south, and north  
Are all alike: forgive it me  
If little thanks I give to thee  
Who scarce can thank great God in heaven  
For what is left of what was given."  
   Small heed unto him the King gave,  
But trembling in his haste to have  
The body of his enemy,  
Said to an old squire, "Bring to me  
The babe, and give the good man this  
Wherewith to gain a little bliss,  
In place of all his troubles gone,  
Nor need he now be long alone."  
   The carle's rough face, at clink of gold,  
Lit up, though still did he behold  
The wasted body lying there;  
But stooping, a rough box, foursquare,  
Made of old wood and lined with hay, <span id="page_152">p. 152</span>  
Wherein the helpless infant lay,  
He raised, and gave it to the squire  
Who on the floor cast down his hire,  
Nor sooth dared murmur aught the while,  
But turning smiled a grim hard smile  
To see the carle his pieces count  
Still weeping: so did all men mount  
And turning round into the wood  
Forgat him and his drearihood,  
And soon were far off from the hut.

   Then coming out, the door he shut  
Behind him, and adown a glade,  
Towards a rude hermitage he made  
To fetch the priest unto his need,  
To bury her and say her bede—  
So when all things that he might do  
Were done aright, heavy with woe,  
He left the woodland hut behind  
To take such chance as he might find  
In other lands, forgetting all  
That in that forest did befall.

   But through the wild wood rode the King,  
Moody and thinking on the thing,  
Nor free from that unreasoning fear;  
Till now, when they had drawn anear  
The open country, and could see  
The road run on from close to lea, <span id="page_153">p. 153</span>  
And lastly by a wooden bridge  
A long way from that heathy ridge  
Cross over a deep lowland stream—  
Then in his eyes there came a gleam,  
And his hand fell upon his sword,  
And turning round to squire and lord  
He said, "Ride sirs, the way is clear,  
Nor of my people have I fear,  
Nor do my foes range over wide;  
And for myself fain would I ride  
Right slowly homewards through the fields  
Noting what this and that one yields;  
While by my squire who bears the child  
Lightly my way shall be beguiled.  
For some nurse now he needs must have  
This tender life of his to save;  
And doubtless by the stream there is  
Some house where he may dwell in bliss,  
Till he grow old enough to learn  
How gold and glory he may earn;  
And grow, perchance, to be a lord."  
   With downcast eyes he spoke that word;  
But forth they galloped speedily,  
And he drew rein and stood to see  
Their green coats lessening as they went.  
This man unto the other bent,  
Until mid dust and haze at last  
Into a wavering mass they passed;  
Then ’twixt the hedgerows vanished quite <span id="page_154">p.
154</span>  
Just told of by the dust-cloud white  
Rolled upwards ’twixt the elm-trunks slim.

   Then turned the king about to him,  
Who held the child, noting again  
The thing wherein he had been lain,  
And on one side of it could see  
A lion painted hastily  
In red upon a ground of white,  
As though of old it had been dight  
For some lord's rough-wrought palisade;  
But naked ’mid the hay was laid  
The child, and had no mark or sign.  
   Then said the king, "My ancient line  
Thou and thy sires through good and ill  
Have served, and unto thee my will  
Is law enough from day to day;  
Ride nigh me hearkening what I say."  
   He shook his rein and side by side  
Down through the meadows did they ride,  
And opening all his heart, the king  
Told to the old man everything  
Both of the sage, and of his dream;  
Withal drawn nigh unto the stream,  
He said, "Yet this shall never be,  
For surely as thou lovest me,  
Adown this water shall he float  
With this rough box for ark and boat,  
Then if mine old line he must spill <span id="page_155">p. 155</span>  
There let God save him if he will,  
While I in no case shed his blood."  
   "Yea," said the squire, "thy words are good,  
For the whole sin shall lie on me,  
Who greater things would do for thee  
If need there were; yet note, I pray,  
It may be he will ’scape this day  
And live; and what wouldst thou do then  
If thou shouldst meet him among men?  
I counsel thee to let him go  
Since sure to nought thy will shall grow."  
   "Yea, yea," the king said, "let all be  
That may be, if I once but see  
This ark whirl in the eddies swift  
Or tangled in the autumn drift  
And wrong side up:" but with that word  
Their horse-hoofs on the plank he heard,  
And swift across the bridge he rode,  
And nigh the end of it abode,  
Then turned to watch the old squire stop,  
And leaning o’er the bridge-rail drop  
The luckless child; he heard withal  
A muttered word and splashing fall  
And from the wakened child a cry,  
And saw the cradle hurrying by,  
Whirled round and sinking, but as yet  
Holding the child, nor overset.  
   Now somewhat, soothly at the sight  
Did the king doubt if he outright <span id="page_156">p. 156</span>  
Had rid him of his feeble foe,  
But frowning did he turn to go  
Unto his home, nor knew indeed  
How better he might help his need;  
And as unto his house he rode  
Full little care for all he showed,  
Still bidding Samuel the squire  
Unto his bridle-hand ride nigher,  
To whom he talked of careless things,  
As unto such will talk great kings.  
   But when unto his palace gate  
He came at last, thereby did wait  
The chamberlain with eager eyes  
Above his lips grown grave with lies,  
In haste to tell him that the queen,  
While in the wild-wood he had been,  
Had borne a daughter unto him  
Strong, fair of face, and straight of limb.  
So well at ease and glad thereat  
His troubled dream he nigh forgat,  
His troubled waking, and the ride  
Unto the fateful river-side;  
Or thought of all as little things  
Unmeet to trouble souls of kings.

So passed the days, so passed the years  
In such-like hopes, and such-like fears,  
And such-like deeds in field and hall  
As unto royal men befall, <span id="page_157">p. 157</span>  
And fourteen years have passed away  
Since on the huddled brake he lay  
And dreamed that dream, remembered now  
Once and again, when slow and slow  
The minutes of some sleepless night  
Crawl toward the dawning of the light.

   Remembered not on this sweet morn  
When to the ringing of the horn,  
Jingle of bits and mingled shout  
Toward that same stream he rideth out  
To see his grey-winged falcons fly.  
   So long he rode he drew anigh  
A mill upon the river's brim,  
That seemed a goodly place to him,  
For o’er the oily smooth millhead  
There hung the apples growing red,  
And many an ancient apple-tree  
Within the orchard could he see,  
While the smooth millwalls white and black  
Shook to the great wheel's measured clack,  
And grumble of the gear within;  
While o’er the roof that dulled that din  
The doves sat crooning half the day,  
And round the half-cut stack of hay  
The sparrows fluttered twittering.  
   There smiling stayed the joyous king,  
And since the autumn noon was hot  
Thought good anigh that pleasant spot <span id="page_158">p.
158</span>  
To dine that day, and therewith sent  
To tell the miller his intent:  
Who held the stirrup of the king,  
Bareheaded, joyful at the thing,  
While from his horse he lit adown,  
Then lead him o’er an elm-beam brown,  
New cut in February tide  
That crossed the stream from side to side,  
So underneath the apple trees  
The king sat careless, well at ease  
And ate and drank right merrily.  
   To whom the miller drew anigh  
Among the courtiers, bringing there  
Such as he could of country fare,  
Green yellowing plums from off his wall,  
Wasp-bitten pears, the first to fall  
From off the wavering spire-like tree,  
Junkets, and cream and fresh honey.  
   Smiling the king regarded him,  
For he was round-paunched, short of limb,  
Red-faced, with long, lank flaxen hair;  
But with him was a boy, right fair,  
Grey-eyed, and yellow-haired, most like  
Unto some Michael who doth strike  
The dragon on a minster wall,  
So sweet-eyed was he, and withal  
So fearless of all things he seemed.  
But when he saw him the king deemed  
He scarce could be the miller's kin, <span id="page_159">p. 159</span>  
And laughing said, "Hast thou within  
Thy dusty mill the dame who bore  
This stripling in the days of yore,  
For fain were I to see her now,  
If she be liker him than thou?"  
   "Sire," said the miller, "that may be  
And thou my dame shall surely see;  
But for the stripling, neither I  
Begat him, nor my wife did lie  
In labour when the lad was born,  
But as an outcast and forlorn  
We found him fourteen years to-day,  
So quick the time has passed away."

   Then the king, hearkening what he said,  
A vanished day remembered,  
And troubled grew his face thereat;  
But while he thought of this and that  
The man turned from him and was gone  
And by him stood the lad alone;  
At whom he gazed, and as their eyes  
Met, a great horror ’gan arise  
Within his heart, and back he shrank  
And shuddering a deep draught he drank,  
Scarce knowing if his royal wine  
He touched, or juice of some hedge-vine.  
   But as his eyes he lifted up  
From off his jewelled golden cup,  
Once more the miller drew anigh, <span id="page_160">p. 160</span>  
By whom his wife went timidly  
Bearing some burden in her hand;  
So when before him she did stand  
And he beheld her worn and old,  
And black-haired, then that hair of gold,  
Grey eyes, firm lips, and round cleft chin,  
Brought stronger memory of his sin.  
   But the carle spake, "Dame, tell the King  
How this befell, a little thing  
The thoughts of such great folk to hold,  
Speak out, and fear not to be bold."  
   "My tale," she said, "is short enow,  
For this day fourteen years ago  
Along this river-side I rode  
From market to our poor abode,  
Where we dwelt far from other men,  
Since thinner was the country then  
Than now it is; so as I went  
And wearied o’er my panniers bent,  
From out the stream a feeble cry  
I heard, and therewith presently,  
From off my mule's back could I see  
This boy who standeth here by thee,  
A naked, new-born infant, laid  
In a rough ark that had been stayed  
By a thick tangled bed of weed;  
So pitying the youngling's need,  
Dismounting, did I wade for him  
Waist deep, whose ark now scarce did swim; <span id="page_161">p.
161</span>  
And he, with cold, and misery,  
And hunger, was at point to die.  
   "Withal, I bare him to the mill  
And cherished him, and had good will  
To bring the babe up as mine own;  
Since childless were we and alone,  
And no one came to father it.  
So oft have I rejoiced to sit  
Beside the fire and watch him play.  
And now, behold him!—but some day  
I look to lose him, for, indeed,  
I deem he comes of royal seed,  
Unmeet for us: and now, my lord,  
Have you heard every foolish word  
About my son—this boy—whose name  
Is Michael soothly, since he came  
To us this day nigh Michaelmas.  
—See, sire, the ark wherein he was!  
Which I have kept."  
                       Therewith she drew  
A cloth away; but the King knew,  
Long ere she moved, what he should see,  
Nor looked, but seeming carelessly  
Leaned on the board and hid his eyes.  
But at the last did he arise  
And saw the painted lion red,  
Not faded, well remembered;  
Withal he thought, "And who of these  
Were with me then amongst the trees <span id="page_162">p. 162</span>  
To see this box;" but presently  
He thought again that none but he  
And the grey squire, old Samuel,  
That painting could have noted well.  
Since Samuel his cloak had cast  
About it, and therewith had past  
Throughout the forest on that day,  
And not till all were well away  
Had drawn it off before the King.  
But changed and downcast at the thing  
He left the lovely autumn place,  
Still haunted by the new-found face  
Of his old foe, and back he rode  
Unto his ancient rich abode,  
Forcing but dismal merriment  
As midst his smiling lords he went;  
Who yet failed not to note his mood,  
So changed: and some men of the wood  
Remembered them, but said not aught,  
Yea, trembled lest their hidden thought  
Some bird should learn, and carry it.

   The morrow come, the King did sit  
Alone, to talk with Samuel,  
Who yet lived, gathering wage for hell.  
He from the presence in a while  
Came forth, and with his ugly smile  
He muttered, "Well betide me, then,  
St. Peter! they are lucky men <span id="page_163">p. 163</span>  
Who serve no kings, since they indeed  
May damn themselves each for his need.  
And will not he outlive this day  
Whom the deep water could not slay,  
Ere yet his lips had tasted food?  
—With that a horse, both strong and good,  
He gat of the king's equerry,  
And toward the mill rode speedily.

   There Michael by the mill-tail lay,  
Watching the swift stream snatch away  
His float from midst the careless dace;  
But thinking of the thin, dark face,  
That yesterday all men he saw  
Gaze at with seeming love and awe;  
Nor had he, wondering at the lords,  
Lost one word of the housewife's words;  
And still he noted that the King  
Beheld him as a wondrous thing,  
Strange to find there: so in his heart  
He thought to play some royal part  
In this wild play of life, and made  
Stories, wherein great words he said,  
And did great deeds in desperate fight.  
But midst these thoughts there came in sight  
He who had carried him of yore,  
From out the woodman's broken door,  
Dressed like a king's man, with fine gold  
Touching his hard brown hands and old, <span id="page_164">p.
164</span>  
So was his sleeve embroidered;  
A plumed hat had he on his head,  
And by his side a cutting sword  
Fit for the girdle of a lord;  
And round his neck a knife he bore,  
Whose hilt was well enamelled o’er,  
With green leaves on a golden ground,  
Whose stem a silver scroll enwound;  
Charged with those letters, writ in black,  
*Strike! for no dead man cometh back!*  
   The boy gazed at him earnestly,  
With beating heart, as he drew nigh.  
And when at last he drew his rein  
Beside him, thought that not in vain  
His dream might be. But Samuel  
Below his breath said; "Surely well  
Shalt thou fulfil thy destiny;  
And, spite of all, thou wilt not die  
Till thou hast won the arched crown?  
   But with that word he lighted down,  
And said aloud, "Lad, tell to me  
Where the good miller I may see,  
For from the King I come to-day,  
And have a word to him to say;  
I think, indeed, concerning thee;  
For surely thou his lad must be."  
   Then Michael leapt up, nor took heed  
Of how the nibbling dace might feed  
Upon the loose ends of his bait; <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>  
"Fair sir," he said, "my sire doth wait  
Until men bring his mare from grass,  
For to the good town will he pass,  
Since he has need of household gear;  
Follow, my lord, the place is here."  
   Withal, the good steed being made fast,  
Unto the other side they passed,  
And by the door the miller found,  
Who bowed before him to the ground,  
And asked what he would have him do  
Then from his bosom Samuel drew  
A scroll, and said, "Good friend, read here,  
And do my bidding without fear  
Of doing ill."  
               "Sir," said the man,  
"But little lettered skill I can;  
Let my dame come, for she can read  
Well written letters at good need."  
   "Nay, friend," he said, "suffice it thee  
This seal at the scroll's end to see,  
My Lord the King's; and hear my word,  
That I come hither from my lord  
Thy foundling lad to have away  
To serve the King from this same day."  
   Downcast the miller looked thereat,  
And twisting round his dusty hat,  
Said, "Well, my lord, so must it be,  
Nor is he aught akin to me,  
Nor seems so: none the less would I <span id="page_166">p. 166</span>  
Have left him, when I came to die,  
All things I have, with this my mill,  
Wherein he hath no ’prentice skill,  
Young as he is: and surely here  
Might he have lived, with little fear,  
A life of plenty and of bliss—  
Near by, too, a fair maid there is,  
I looked should be good wife to him."

   Meanwhile young Michael's head ’gan swim  
With thoughts of noble life and praise;  
And he forgat the happy days  
Wherein the happy dreams he dreamed  
That now so near fulfilment seemed;  
And, looking through the open mill,  
Stared at the grey and windy hill  
And saw it not, but some fair place  
Made strange with many a changing face.  
And all his life that was to be.  
   But Samuel, laughing scornfully,  
Said, "O good soul, thou thinkest then  
This is a life for well-born men,  
As our lord deems this youngling is—  
Tell me good lad, where lies thy bliss?  
   But Michael turned shamefaced and red,  
Waked from his dream, and stammering said,  
"Fair sir, my life is sweet and good,  
And John, the ranger of the wood,  
Saith that I draw so good a bow, <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>  
That I shall have full skill enow  
Ere many months have passed me by  
To join the muster, and to try  
To win the bag of florins white,  
That folk, on Barnaby the bright,  
Shoot for within the market town.  
Sir, please you to look up and down  
The weedy reaches of our stream,  
And note the bubbles of the bream,  
And see the great chub take the fly,  
And watch the long pike basking lie  
Outside the shadow of the weed.  
Withal there come unto our need  
Woodcock and snipe when swallows go;  
And now the water-hen flies low  
With feet that well nigh touch the reeds,  
And plovers cry about the meads,  
And the stares chatter; certes, sir,  
It is a fair place all the year."  
   Eyeing him grimly, Samuel said,  
"Thou show’st churl's breeding, by my head,  
In foul despite of thy fair face!  
Take heart, for to a better place  
Thou goest now.—Miller, farewell,  
Nor need’st thou to the neighbours tell  
The noble fortunes of the lad;  
For, certes, he shall not be glad  
To know them in a year or twain.  
Yet shall thy finding not be vain, <span id="page_168">p. 168</span>  
And thou mayst bless it; for behold  
This bag wherein is store of gold;  
Take it and let thy hinds go play,  
And grind no corn for many a day,  
For it would buy thy mill and thee."  
   He turned to go, but pensively  
Stood Michael, for his broken dream  
Doubtful and far away did seem  
Amid the squire's rough mockeries;  
And tears were gathering in his eyes.  
But the kind miller's rough farewell  
Rang in his ears; and Samuel  
Stamped with his foot and plucked his sleeve;  
So therewithal he turned to leave  
His old abode, the quiet place,  
Trembling, with wet and tearful face.  
   But even as he turned there came  
From out the house the simple dame  
And cast rough arms about the lad,  
Saying, "For that I have been glad  
By means of thee this many a day,  
My mourning heart this hour doth pay.  
But fair son, may’st thou live in bliss,  
And die in peace; remembering this,  
When thou art come to high estate,  
That in our house, early and late,  
The happy house that shall be sad,  
Thou hadst the best of all we had  
And love unfeigned from us twain, <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>  
Whose hearts thou madest young again,  
Hearts that the quicker old shall grow  
Now thou art gone."  
                       "Good dame, enow,"  
Quoth Samuel, "the day grows late,  
And sure the king for meat shall wait  
Until he see this new-found lord."  
He strode away upon that word;  
And half ashamed, and half afeard,  
Yet eager as his dream he neared,  
Shyly the lad went after him.  
They crossed the stream and by its brim  
Both mounted the great warhorse grey,  
And without word they rode away.

   But as along the river's edge  
They went, and brown birds in the sedge  
Twittered their sweet and formless tune  
In the fair autumn afternoon,  
And reach by reach the well-known stream  
They passed, again the hopeful dream  
Of one too young to think death near,  
Who scarce had learned the name of fear  
Remorseful memories put to flight;  
Lovely the whole world showed and bright.  
Nor did the harsh voice rouse again  
The thought of mockery or of pain,  
For other thoughts held Samuel.  
   So, riding silently and well, <span id="page_170">p. 170</span>  
They reached at last the dusty road  
That led unto the King's abode.  
But Samuel turned away his face  
Therefrom, and at a steady pace  
The great horse thundered o’er the bridge,  
And made on toward the heathy ridge,  
Wherefrom they rode that other day.  
But Michael, noting well the way,  
Why thus they went, fell wondering,  
And said aloud, "Dwells then the King,  
Fair sir, as now within the wood?"  
   "Young fool, where that it seems him good  
He dwelleth," quoth old Samuel,  
"And now it pleaseth him to dwell  
With the black monks across the wood."  
   Withal he muttered in his hood,  
"Curst be the King, and thee also,  
Who thrust me out such deeds to do;  
When I should bide at home to pray,  
Who draw so nigh my ending day."  
So saying forth his horse he spurred  
And to himself said yet this word,  
"Yea, yea, and of all days forlorn  
God curse the day when I was born."  
   Therewith he groaned; yet saying thus  
His case seemed hard and piteous,  
When he remembered how of old  
Another tale he might have told.  
   So as each thought his own thoughts still, <span id="page_171">p.
171</span>  
The horse began to breast the hill,  
And still they went on higher ground,  
Until as Michael turned him round  
He saw the sunny country-side  
Spread out before him far and wide,  
Golden amidst its waning green,  
Joyous with varied life unseen.  
Meanwhile from side to side of them  
The trees began their way to hem,  
As still he gazed from tree to tree,  
And when he turned back presently  
He saw before him like a wall  
Uncounted tree trunks dim and tall.  
Then with their melancholy sound  
The odorous spruce woods met around  
Those wayfarers, and when he turned  
Once more, far off the sunlight burned  
In star-like spots, while from o’erhead,  
Dim twilight through the boughs was shed.  
   Not there as yet had Michael been,  
Nor had he left the meadows green  
Dotted about with spreading trees,  
And fresh with sun and rain and breeze,  
For those mirk woods, and still his eyes  
Gazed round about for mysteries.  
Since many an old wife's tale he knew;  
Huge woodcutters in raiment blue,  
The remnant of a mighty race,  
The ancient masters of the place, <span id="page_172">p. 172</span>  
And hammering trolls he looked to see,  
And dancers of the faërie,  
Who, as the ancient stories told,  
In front were lovely to behold,  
But empty shells seen from behind.

   So on they rode until the wind  
Had died out, stifled by the trees,  
And Michael ’mid those images  
Of strange things made alive by fear,  
Grew drowsy in the forest drear;  
Nor noted how the time went past  
Until they nigh had reached at last  
The borders of the spruce-tree wood;  
And with a tingling of the blood  
Samuel bethought him of the day  
When turned about the other way  
He carried him he rode with now.  
For the firs ended on the brow  
Of a rough gravelly hill, and there  
Lay a small valley nowise fair  
Beneath them, clear at first of all  
But brake, till amid rushes tall  
Down in the bottom alders grew  
Crabbed and rough; and winding through  
The clayey mounds a brook there was  
Oozy and foul, half choked with grass.  
   There now the Squire awhile drew rein,  
And noted how the ground again <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>  
Rose up upon the other side,  
And saw a green glade opening wide  
’Twixt oaks and hollies, and he knew  
Full well what place it led unto;  
Withal he heard the bittern's boom,  
And though without the fir-wood's gloom  
They now were come, yet red and low  
The sun above the trees did show,  
And in despite of hardihead,  
The old squire had a mortal dread  
Of lying in the wood alone  
When that was done that should be done.  
   Now Michael, wakened by the wind,  
Clutched tighter at the belt behind,  
And with wide eyes was staring round,  
When Samuel said, "Get to the ground,  
My horse shall e’en sink deep enow,  
Without thy body, in this slough;  
And haste thee, or we both shall lie  
Beneath the trees, and be as dry  
As autumn dew can make us. Haste!  
The time is short for thee to waste."  
   Then from the horse the boy did glide,  
And slowly down the valley side  
They went, and Michael, wakened now,  
Sang such rude songs as he might know,  
Grown fresh and joyous of his life;  
While Samuel, clutching at the knife  
About his neck that hung, again <span id="page_174">p. 174</span>  
Down in the bottom tightened rein,  
And turning, in a hoarse voice said,  
"My girths are loosening, by my head!  
Come nigh and draw them tighter, lad."  
   Then Michael stayed his carol glad,  
And noting little in his mirth  
The other's voice, unto the girth  
Without a word straight set his hand:  
But as with bent head he did stand,  
Straining to tighten what was tight,  
In Samuel's hand the steel flashed bright,  
And fell, deep smitten in his side,  
Then, leaping back, the poor lad cried,  
As if for help, and staggering fell,  
With wide eyes fixed on Samuel;  
Who none the less grown deadly pale,  
Lit down, lest that should not avail  
To slay him, and beside him knelt,  
And since his eyes were closed now, felt  
His heart that beat yet: therewithal  
His hand upon the knife did fall.  
But, ere his fingers clutched it well,  
Far off he seemed to hear a bell,  
And trembling knelt upright again,  
And listening, listened not in vain,  
For clear he heard a tinkling sound.  
Then to his horse from off the ground  
He leapt, nor reasoned with his dread,  
But thought the angel of the dead <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>  
Was drawing nigh the slayer to slay,  
Ere scarce the soul had passed away.  
One dreadful moment yet he heard  
That bell, then like a madman spurred  
His noble horse; that maddened too,  
The close-set fir-wood galloped through,  
Not stayed by any stock or stone,  
Until the furious race being done,  
Anigh the bridge he fell down dead;  
And Samuel, mazed with guilt and dread,  
Wandered afoot throughout the night,  
But came, at dawning of the light,  
Half-dead unto the palace gate.  
   There till the opening did he wait;  
Then, by the King's own signet-ring,  
He gained the chamber of the king,  
And painfully what he had done  
He told, and how the thing had gone.  
And said withal: "Yet is he dead,  
And surely that which made my dread  
Shall give thee joy: for doubt not aught  
That bell the angels to him brought,  
That he in Abraham's breast might lie—  
So ends, O King, the prophecy."  
   Nathless the King scowled, ill content,  
And said, "I deemed that I had sent  
A man of war to do my will,  
Who lacked for neither force nor skill,  
And thou com’st with a woman's face, <span id="page_176">p. 176</span>  
Bewildered with thy desperate race,  
And made an idiot with thy fear,  
Nor bring’st me any token here!"  
   Therewith he rose and gat away,  
But brooding on it through that day,  
Thought that all things went not so ill  
As first he deemed, and that he still  
Might leave his old line flourishing.  
Therewith both gold and many a thing  
Unto old Samuel he gave,  
But thereby failed his life to save;  
Who, not so old in years as sin,  
Died ere the winter, and within  
The minster choir was laid asleep,  
With carven saints his head to keep.

   And so the days and years went by,  
And still in great felicity  
The King dwelt, wanting only this—  
A son wherewith to share his bliss,  
And reign when he was dead and gone.  
Nor had he daughter, save that one  
Born on the night when Michael first,  
Forlorn, alone, and doubly cursed,  
Felt on him this world's bitter air.  
   This daughter, midst fair maids most fair,  
Was not yet wed, though at this time,  
Being come unto her maiden's prime,  
She looked upon her eighteenth May. <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>  
   Midst this her mother passed away,  
Not much lamented of the King,  
Who had the thought of marrying  
Some dame more fertile, and who sent  
A wily man with this intent  
To spy the countries out and find  
Some great king's daughter, wise and kind,  
And fresh, and fair, in face and limb,  
In all things a fit mate for him.  
   So in short time it came to pass  
Again the King well wedded was,  
And hoped once more to have a son.  
   And when this fair dame he had won,  
A year in peace he dwelt with her,  
Until the time was drawing near  
When first his eyes beheld that foe  
He deemed was dead these years ago.  
Now at that time, as custom was,  
His daughter was about to pass  
Unto a distant house of his,  
Some king had built for worldly bliss  
In ancient days: there, far removed  
From courts or towns, the dame he loved  
The dead king had been wont to see  
Play mid the summer greenery,  
Or like Erigone of old  
Stand in the vineyards girt with gold,  
To queen it o’er the vintagers,  
Half worshipping that face of hers. <span id="page_178">p. 178</span>  
Long years agone these folk were passed,  
Their crimes forgotten, or else cast  
Into the glowing crucible  
Of time, that tempers all things well,  
That maketh pleasure out of pain,  
And out of ruin golden gain;  
Nathless, unshaken still, there stood  
The towers and ramparts red as blood;  
Wherein their lives had passed away;  
And still the lovely gardens lay  
About them, changed, but smiling still,  
As in past time, on good or ill.  
   Thither the Princess Cecily  
Must go awhile in peace to be;  
For now, midst care, and doubt, and toil,  
Proud words drawn back, and half-healed broil,  
The King had found one meet to wed  
His daughter, of great godlihead,  
Wealth, and unbroken royalty.  
And now he said to her, when she  
Was setting out for that fair place,  
"O daughter, thou shalt see my face  
Before a month is fully gone,  
Nor wilt thou see me then alone;  
For that man shall be with me then,  
Whom I have chosen from all men  
To give my dearest treasure to.  
Most fain he is to look on you,  
Nor needst thou fear him for thy part, <span id="page_179">p.
179</span>  
Who holdeth many a woman's heart  
As the net holds the silvery fish.  
Farewell—and all things thou mayst wish  
I pray God grant thee."  
                          Therewithal  
He kissed her, and from out the hall  
She passed, not shamefaced, or afraid  
Of what might happen; though, indeed,  
Her heart of no man's heart had need  
To make her happy as she thought.

   Ever the new sun daily brought  
Fresh joy of life to her bedside,  
The world before her open wide  
Was spread, a place for joy and bliss.  
Her lips had trembled with no kiss,  
Wherewith love slayeth fear and shame;  
Her grey eyes conscious of no blame,  
Beheld unmoved the eyes of men;  
Her hearing grew no dimmer when  
Some unused footstep she might hear;  
And unto no man was she dear,  
But as some goddess might have been  
When Greek men worshipped many a queen.

   Now with her armed folk forth she rode  
Unto that ancient fair abode,  
And while the lark sung o’er the corn,  
Love gilded not the waning morn; <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>  
And when the sun rose high above,  
High thoughts she thought, but not of love;  
And when that sun the world did leave,  
He left no love to light the eve.  
The moon no melancholy brought,  
The dawn no vain, remorseful thought.  
But all untroubled her sweet face  
Passed ’neath the gate of that old place,  
And there her bridegroom she abode.

   But scarce was she upon the road  
Ere news unto the King was brought  
That Peter, the old abbot, sought  
To see him, having newly come  
From the wild place that was his home  
Across the forest; so the King  
Bade him to enter, well willing  
To hear what he might have to say;  
Who, entering the hall straightway,  
Had with him an old, reverend man,  
The Sub-prior, father Adrian,  
And five monks more, and therewithal  
Ten of his folk, stout men and tall,  
Who bore armed staves and coats of fence.  
   So, when he came to audience,  
He prayed the King of this or that,  
Whereof my tale-teller forgat,  
And graciously the King heard all,  
And said at last, "Well, what may fall, <span id="page_181">p.
181</span>  
Thou go’st not hence, fair lord, to-day;  
Unless in vain a king must pray,  
Thou and thy monks shall eat with me;  
While feast thine axe-men merrily."  
   Withal, he eyed the abbot's folk  
In careless mood, then once more spoke,  
"Tall men thou feedest, by the rood!  
Lord Abbot, come they from the wood?  
Dwell many more such thereabout?  
Fain were I such should swell the shout  
When I am armed, and rank meets rank."  
   But as he spoke his loud voice sank  
Wavering, nor heard he aught at all  
Of the faint noises of the hall,  
Or what the monk in answer said;  
For, looking from a steel-clad head,  
Those eyes again did he behold,  
That erst from ’neath the locks of gold  
Kindly and bold, but soft with awe,  
Beneath the apple-boughs he saw.  
   But when for sure this thing he knew  
Pale to the very lips he grew.  
Till gathering heart within a while  
With the faint semblance of a smile,  
He seemed to note the Abbot's words  
That he heard not; then from the lords  
He turned, and facing Michael said,  
"Raise up the steel cap from thine head,  
That I may see if thou look’st bold; <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
Methinks, I know thy face of old,  
Whence com’st thou?  
                           Michael lifted straight  
From off his brow the steel cap's weight,  
And showed the bright locks curling round  
His fresh and ruddy face, sun-browned,  
And in a voice clear as a bell,  
Told all his story, till he fell  
Sore wounded in that dismal vale;  
And said withal, "My lord, the tale  
Of what came after, none knoweth  
Better than he, who, from ill death  
Saved me that tide, and made me man,  
My lord, the sub-prior Adrian."  
   "Speak on then, father," quoth the King,  
Making as he was still hearkening.  
"My lord," said Adrian, "I, who then  
Was but a server of poor men,  
Outside our Abbey walls, one day  
Was called by one in poor array,  
A charcoal-burner's lad, who said.  
That soon his father would be dead,  
And that of all things he would have  
His rights, that he his soul might save.  
I made no tarrying at that word,  
But took between mine hands the Lord,  
And bade the boy bear forth the bell  
For though few folk there were to tell.  
Who passed that way, nathless, I trow <span id="page_183">p.
183</span>  
The beasts were glad that news to know.  
   "Well, by the pinewood's skirts we went  
While through its twilight the bell sent  
A heavenly tinkling; but the lad  
’Gan telling me of fears he had  
Of elves who dwell within the wood.  
I chid him thereat, as was good,  
Bidding him note Whom in mine hands  
I held, The Ransom of all Lands.  
But as the firwood's dim twilight  
Waxed into day, and fair and bright  
The evening sun showed through the trees,  
Our ears fanned by the evening breeze,  
The galloping of horse-hoofs heard,  
Wherewith my page hung back afeard  
Of elves and such-like; but I said,  
'Wilt thou thy father shouldst be dead  
Ere we can reach him? Oh my son,  
Fear not that aught can stay This One.'  
   "Therewith I smote my mule, and he  
Ran forward with me hastily  
As fearing to be left behind.  
Well, as we went, what should we find  
Down by the stream, but this my son,  
Who seemed as though his days were done;  
For in his side a knife there stood  
Wherefrom ran out a stream of blood,  
Soaking the grass and water-mint;  
Then, I dismounting, we by dint <span id="page_184">p. 184</span>  
Of all our strength, the poor youth laid  
Upon my mule, and down a glade  
Of oaks and hollies then we passed,  
And reached the woodman's home at last;  
A poor hut, built of wattled wood,  
And by its crooked gable stood  
A ruinous shed, unroofed and old  
That beasts of burden once did hold.  
—Thyself; my lord, mayst know it well,  
Since thereabout the wild swine dwell;  
And hart, and hind, and roe are there—  
So the lad's wounds I staunched with care  
Forthwith, and then the man I shrived,  
Who none the less got well and lived  
For many a day: then back I went  
And the next day our leech I sent  
With drugs to tend upon the lad.  
Who soon was as he ne’er had had  
A hurt at all: and he being well  
We took him in our house to dwell,  
And taught him letters, and, indeed,  
Before long, Latin could he read  
As well as I; but hath no will  
To turn unto religion still.  
Yet is he good and doth no wrong;  
And being thereto both hale and strong,  
My lord, the Abbot, sayeth of him,  
'He shall serve God with heart and limb,  
Not heart and voice.' Therefore, my lord, <span id="page_185">p.
185</span>  
Thou seest him armed with spear and sword  
For their defence who feed him still,  
Teach him, and guard his soul from ill.  
Ho, Michael! hast thou there with thee  
The fair-wrought knife I first did see  
Deep in thy side?—there, show it now  
Unto the King, that he may know  
Our tale is not a fabled thing."  
   Withal the King, as one listening,  
With his thin, anxious face and pale,  
Sat leaning forward through this tale,  
Scarce noting here and there a word.  
But all being told, at last he heard  
His own voice changed, and harsh, and low,  
That said, "Fair lord, I fain would know,  
Since this your man at arms seems true,  
What thing will he be worth to you;  
For better had he wear my rose  
Than loiter in your Abbey-close,  
Poring o’er books no man can read."  
   "O sire!" the monk said, "if your need  
Be great of such men, let him go;  
My men-at-arms need make no show  
Of fairness, nor should ladies miss,  
E’en as thou say’st, such men as this."  
   Laughing he spoke; the King the while,  
His pale face puckering to a smile;  
Then, as in some confused dream,  
In Michael's hand he saw the gleam <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>  
Of that same steel remembered well,  
The gift he gave to Samuel;  
Drawn from his father's ancient chest  
To do that morn his own behest.  
And as he now beheld its sheen,  
The twining stem of gold and green,  
The white scroll with the letters black,—  
*Strike! for no dead man cometh back!*  
He hardened yet his heart once more,  
And grown unhappy as before,  
When last he had that face in sight,  
Brought now the third time to the light,  
Once more grew treacherous, fierce, and fell.  
   Now was the Abbot feasted well  
With all his folk, then went away,  
But Michael clad in rich array  
Became the king's man, and was thought.  
By all most happy to be brought  
Unto such hopeful fair estate.

   For ten days yet the King did wait,  
Which past, for Michael did he send,  
And he being come, said to him, "Friend,  
Take now this letter from my hand  
And go unto our southern land;  
My captain Hugh shall go with thee  
For one day's journey, then shall he  
Tell thee which way thou hast to ride;  
The third day thence about noontide <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>  
If thou dost well, thou shouldst be close  
Unto my Castle of the Rose  
Where dwells my daughter; needs it is  
That no man living should see this  
Until that thou within my wall  
Hast given it to the seneschal;  
Be wise and wary then, that thou  
Mayst think of this that happeneth now  
As birthday to thine high estate."  
   So said he, knowing not that fate  
Was dealing otherwise than he.  
   But Michael going, presently  
Met Hugh, a big man rough and black,  
And who of nought but words had lack,  
With him he mounted, and set forth  
And daylong rode on from the north.  
   Now if the King had hope that Hugh  
Some deed like Samuel's might do  
I know not, certes nought he said  
To that hard heart and narrow head,  
Who knew no wiles but wiles of war,  
And was as true as such men are;  
Yet had there been a tale to tell  
If Michael had not held him well,  
And backward still the wrath had turned  
Wherewith his heart not seldom burned  
At scornful words his fellow said.  
   At last they reached cross ways that led  
One west, one southward still, whereat <span id="page_188">p.
188</span>  
Hugh, taking off his feathered hat,  
Bowed low in scorn, and said, "Fair sir,  
Unto the westward must I spur,  
While you go southward, soon to get  
I doubt not, an earl's coronet;  
Farewell, my lord, and yet beware  
Thou dost not at my lady stare  
Too hard, lest thou shouldst plumb the moat,  
Or have a halter round thy throat."  
   But Michael to his scoff said nought,  
But upon high things set his thought  
As his departing hooves he heard.  
And still betwixt the hedgerows spurred,  
And when, the twilight was o’erpast  
At a small inn drew rein at last,  
And slept that night as such folk can;  
And while next morn the thrushes ran  
Their first course through the autumn dew  
The gossamers did he dash through,  
And on his way rode steadily  
The live-long day, nor yet was he  
Alone, as well might be that day  
Since a fair town was in his way,  
Stout hinds he passed, and yeomen good,  
Some friar in his heavy hood,  
And well-coifed housewives mounted high  
Above their maunds, while merrily  
The well-shod damsel trudged along  
Beside them, sending forth some song <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>  
As little taught as is a bird's;  
And good men, good wives, priests, and herds,  
And merry maids failed not to send  
Good wishes for his journey's end  
Unto him as still on he sped,  
Free from all evil thoughts or dread.

   Withal again the day went by,  
And in that city's hostelry  
He slept, and by the dawn of day  
Next morn again was on his way,  
And leaving the scarce wakened street  
The newly risen sun did greet  
With cheerful heart. His way wound on  
Still up and up till he had won  
Up to a great hill's chalky brow,  
Whence looking back he saw below  
The town spread out, church, square, and street,  
And baily, crawling up the feet  
Of the long yew-besprinkled hill;  
And in the fragrant air and still,  
Seeming to gain new life from it,  
The doves from roof to roof did flit:  
The early fires sent up their smoke  
That seemed to him to tell of folk  
New wakened unto great delight:  
For he upon that morning bright,  
So joyous felt, so free from pain,  
He seemed as he were born again <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>  
Into some new immortal state  
That knew no envy, fear, or hate.  
   Now the road turned to his left hand  
And led him through a table-land,  
Windy and barren of all grain;  
But where a hollow specked the plain  
The yew-trees hugged the sides of it,  
And ’mid them did the woodlark flit  
Or sang well-sheltered from the wind,  
And all about the sheep did find  
Sweet grass, the while the shepherd's song  
Rang clear as Michael sped along.  
   Long time he rode, till suddenly,  
When now the sun was broad and high,  
From out a hollow where the yew  
Still guarded patches of the dew,  
He found at last that he had won  
That highland's edge, and gazed upon  
A valley that beneath the haze  
Of that most fair of autumn days,  
Showed glorious; fair with golden sheaves,  
Rich with the darkened autumn-leaves,  
Gay with the water-meadows green,  
The bright blue streams that lay between,  
The miles of beauty stretched away  
From that bleak hill-side bare and grey,  
Till white cliffs over slopes of vine,  
Drew ’gainst the sky a broken line.  
And twixt the vineyards and the stream <span id="page_191">p.
191</span>  
Michael saw gilded spirelets gleam;  
For, hedged with many a flowery close,  
There lay the Castle of the Rose,  
His hurried journey's aim and end.

   Then downward he began to wend,  
And ’twixt the flowery hedges sweet  
He heard the hook smite down the wheat,  
And murmur of the unseen folk;  
But when he reached the stream that broke  
The golden plain, but leisurely  
He passed the bridge, for he could see  
The masters of that ripening realm,  
Cast down beneath an ancient elm  
Upon a little strip of grass,  
From hand to hand the pitcher pass,  
While on the turf beside them lay  
The ashen-handled sickles grey,  
The matters of their cheer between:  
Slices of white cheese, specked with green,  
And greenstriped onions and ryebread,  
And summer apples faintly red,  
Even beneath the crimson skin;  
And yellow grapes, well ripe and thin,  
Plucked from the cottage gable-end.

   And certes Michael felt their friend  
Hearing their voices, nor forgot  
His boyhood and the pleasant spot <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>  
Beside the well-remembered stream;  
And friendly did this water seem  
As through its white-flowered weeds it ran  
Bearing good things to beast and man.  
   Yea, as the parapet he passed,  
And they a greeting toward him cast,  
Once more he felt a boy again;  
As though beneath the harvest wain  
He was asleep, by that old stream,  
And all these things were but a dream—  
The King, the squire, the hurrying ride  
Unto the lonely quagmire side;  
The sudden pain, the deadly swoon,  
The feverish life from noon to noon;  
The tending of the kind old man,  
The black and white Dominican,  
The hour before the abbot's throne,  
The poring o’er old books alone,  
In summer morn; the King again,  
The envious greetings of strange men,  
This mighty horse and rich array,  
This journey on an unknown way.  
   Surely he thought to wake from it,  
And once more by the waggon sit,  
Blinking upon the sunny mill.  
   But not for either good or ill  
Shall he see one of all those days;  
On through the quivering noontide haze  
He rode, and now on either hand <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>  
Heavy with fruit the trees did stand;  
Nor had he ridden long, ere he  
The red towers of the house could see  
Grey on the wind-beat southern side:  
And soon the gates thrown open wide  
He saw, the long-fixed drawbridge down,  
The moat, with lilies overgrown,  
Midst which the gold-scaled fishes lay:  
Such peace was there for many a day.  
   And deep within the archway's shade  
The warder on his cloak was laid,  
Dozing, one hand upon a harp.  
And nigh him a great golden carp  
Lay stiff with all his troubles done,  
Drawn from the moat ere yet the sun  
Was high, and nigh him was his bane,  
An angling rod of Indian cane.  
   Now hearing Michael's horse-hooves smite  
The causeway, shading from the light  
His eyes, as one scarce yet awake,  
He made a shift his spear to take,  
And, eyeing Michael's badge the while,  
Rose up, and with a lazy smile,  
Said, "Ho! fair sir, abide, abide,  
And show why hitherward ye ride  
Unto my lady's royal home."  
Said Michael, "From the king I come,  
As by my badge ye well may see;  
And letters have I here with me <span id="page_194">p. 194</span>  
To give my lord the Seneschal."  
   "Yea," said the man, "But in the hall  
He feasteth now; what haste is there,  
Certes full quickly cometh care;  
And sure I am he will not read  
Thy letters, or to aught give heed  
Till he has played out all the play,  
And every guest has gone away;  
So thou, O damoiseau, must wait;  
Tie up thine horse anigh the gate,  
And sit with me, and thou shalt hear  
*The Kaiser lieth on his bier*.  
Thou laughest—hast thou never heard  
Of this same valorous Red Beard,  
And how he died? well, I can sing  
Of many another dainty thing,  
Thou wilt not a long while forget,  
The budget is not empty yet.  
—Peter! I think thou mockest me,  
But thou art young and fair perdie,  
I wish thee luck—well, thou mayest go  
And feel the afternoon wind blow  
Within Dame Bertha's pleasance here;  
She who was held so lief and dear,  
All this was built but for her sake,  
Who made the hearts of men to ache;  
And dying full of years and shame  
Yet left an unforgotten name—  
God rest her soul!" <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>  
                    Michael the while  
Hearkened his talking with a smile,  
Then said, "O friend, I think to hear  
Both '*The King lieth on his bier*'  
And many another song of thee,  
Ere I depart; but now show me  
The pleasance of the ancient queen,  
For these red towers above the green  
Show like the gates of paradise,  
That surely somewhere through them lies."  
   Then said the warder, "That may be  
If thou knows’t what may come to thee—  
When past the drawbridge thou hast gone,  
Upon the left three steps of stone  
Lead to a path beneath the wall  
Of the great court, that folk now call  
The falconer's path, nor canst thou miss  
Going thereby, to find the bliss  
Thou look’st for, since the path ends there,  
And through a wicket gilded fair  
The garden lies where thou wouldst be  
Nor will I fail to come to thee  
Whene’er my Lord the Seneschal  
Shall pass well fed from out the hall."  
   Then Michael, thanking him, passed on,  
And soon the gilded wicket won,  
And entered that pleasance sweet,  
And wandered there with wary feet  
And open mouth, as though he deemed <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>  
That in some lovely dream he dreamed,  
And feared to wake to common day,  
So fair was all; and e’en decay  
Brought there but pensive loveliness,  
Where autumn those old walls did bless  
With wealth of fruit, and through the grass  
Unscared the spring-born thrush did pass,  
Who yet knew nought of winter-tide.  
   So wandering, to a fountain's side  
He came, and o’er the basin hung,  
Watching the fishes, as he sung  
Some song remembered from of old,  
Ere yet the miller won that gold.  
But soon made drowsy with his ride,  
And the warm hazy autumn-tide,  
And many a musical sweet sound,  
He cast him down upon the ground,  
And watched the glittering water leap,  
Still singing low, nor thought to sleep.  
   But scarce three minutes had gone by  
Before, as if in mockery,  
The starling chattered o’er his head,  
And nothing he remembered,  
Nor dreamed of aught that he had seen.

   Meanwhile unto that garden green  
Had come the Princess, and with her  
A maiden that she held right dear,  
Who knew the inmost of her mind. <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>  
Now those twain, as the scented wind  
Played with their raiment or their hair,  
Had late been running here and there,  
Chasing each other merrily,  
As maids do, thinking no one by;  
But now, well wearied therewithal,  
Had let their gathered garments fall  
About their feet, and slowly went:  
And through the leaves a murmur sent,  
As of two happy doves that sing  
The soft returning of the spring.  
   Now of these twain the Princess spoke  
The less, but into laughter broke  
Not seldom, and would redden oft,  
As on her lips her fingers soft  
She laid, as still the other maid,  
Half grave, half smiling, follies said.  
   So in their walk they drew anigh  
That fountain in the midst, whereby  
Lay Michael sleeping, dreaming nought  
Of such fair things so nigh him brought;  
They, when the fountain shaft was past,  
Beheld him on the ground down-cast,  
And stopped at first, until the maid  
Stepped lightly forward to the shade,  
And when she had gazed there awhile  
Came running back again, a smile  
Parting her lips, and her bright eyes  
Afire with many fantasies; <span id="page_198">p. 198</span>  
And ere the Lady Cecily  
Could speak a word, "Hush! hush!" said she;  
"Did I not say that he would come  
To woo thee in thy peaceful home  
Before thy father brought him here?  
Come, and behold him, have no fear!  
The great bell would not wake him now,  
Right in his ears."  
                    "Nay, what dost thou?"  
The Princess said; "Let us go hence;  
Thou know’st I give obedience  
To what my father bids; but I  
A maid full fain would live and die,  
Since I am born to be a queen."  
   "Yea, yea, for such as thou hast seen,  
That may be well," the other said.  
"But come now, come; for by my head  
This one must be from Paradise;  
Come swiftly then, if thou art wise  
Ere aught can snatch him back again."  
   She caught her hand, and not in vain  
She prayed; for now some kindly thought  
To Cecily's brow fair colour brought,  
And quickly ’gan her heart to beat  
As love drew near those eyes to greet,  
Who knew him not till that sweet hour.

   So over the fair, pink-edged flower,  
Softly she stepped; but when she came <span id="page_199">p.
199</span>  
Anigh the sleeper, lovely shame  
Cast a soft mist before her eyes  
Full filled of many fantasies.  
But when she saw him lying there  
She smiled to see her mate so fair;  
And in her heart did Love begin  
To tell his tale, nor thought she sin  
To gaze on him that was her own,  
Not doubting he was come alone  
To woo her, whom midst arms and gold  
She deemed she should at first behold;  
And with that thought love grew again  
Until departing was a pain,  
Though fear grew with that growing love;  
And with her lingering footsteps strove  
As from the place she turned to go,  
Sighing and murmuring words full low.  
But as her raiment's hem she raised,  
And for her merry fellow gazed  
Shamefaced and changed, she met her eyes  
Turned grave and sad with ill surprise;  
Who while the princess mazed did stand  
Had drawn from Michael's loosened band  
The king's scroll, which she held out now  
To Cecily, and whispered low,  
"Read, and do quickly what thou wilt,  
Sad, sad! such fair life to be spilt:  
Come further first."  
                         With that they stepped <span id="page_200">p.
200</span>  
A pace or two from where he slept,  
And then she read,  
                    "Lord Seneschal,  
On thee and thine may all good fall;  
Greeting hereby the king sendeth,  
And biddeth thee to put to death  
His enemy who beareth this;  
And as thou lovest life and bliss,  
And all thy goods thou holdest dear,  
Set thou his head upon a spear  
A good half furlong from the gate,  
Our coming hitherward to wait—  
So perish the King's enemies!"  
   She read, and scarcely had her eyes  
Seen clear her father's name and seal,  
Ere all love's power her heart did feel,  
That drew her back in spite of shame,  
To him who was not e’en a name  
Unto her a short hour agone.  
Panting she said, "Wait thou alone  
Beside him, watch him carefully  
And let him sleep if none draw nigh:  
If of himself he waketh, then  
Hide him until I come again,  
When thou hast told him of the snare—  
If thou betrayest me beware!  
For death shall be the least of all  
The ills that on thine head shall fall—  
What say I, thou art dear to me, <span id="page_201">p. 201</span>  
And doubly dear now shalt thou be,  
Thou shalt have power and majesty,  
And be more queen in all than I—  
Few words are best, be wise, be wise!"

   Withal she turned about her eyes  
Once more, and swiftly as a man  
Betwixt the garden trees she ran,  
Until, her own bower reached at last,  
She made good haste, and quickly passed  
Unto her secret treasury.  
There, hurrying since the time was nigh  
For folk to come from meat, she took  
From ’twixt the leaves of a great book  
A royal scroll, signed, sealed, but blank,  
Then, with a hand that never shrank  
Or trembled, she the scroll did fill  
With these words, writ with clerkly skill,—  
"Unto the Seneschal, Sir Rafe,  
Who holdeth our fair castle safe,  
Greeting and health! O well-beloved,  
Know that at this time we are moved  
To wed our daughter, so we send  
Him who bears this, our perfect friend,  
To be her bridegroom; so do thou  
Ask nought of him, since well we know  
His race and great nobility,  
And how he is most fit to be  
Our son; therefore snake no delay, <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>  
But wed the twain upon the day  
Thou readest this: and see that all  
Take oath to him, whate’er shall fall  
To do his bidding as our heir;  
So doing still be lief and dear  
As I have held thee yet to be."  
   She cast the pen down hastily  
At that last letter, for she heard  
How even now the people stirred  
Within the hall: nor dared she think  
What bitter potion she must drink  
If now she failed, so falsely bold  
That life or death did she enfold  
Within its cover, making shift  
To seal it with her father's gift,  
A signet of cornelian.

   Then swiftly down the stairs she ran  
And reached the garden; but her fears  
Brought shouts and thunder to her ears,  
That were but lazy words of men  
Full-fed, far off; nay, even when  
Her limbs caught up her flying gown  
The noise seemed loud enough to drown  
The twitter of the autumn birds,  
And her own muttered breathless words  
That to her heart seemed loud indeed.  
   Yet therewithal she made good speed  
And reached the fountain seen of none <span id="page_203">p.
203</span>  
Where yet abode her friend alone,  
Watching the sleeper, who just now  
Turned in his sleep and muttered low.  
Therewith fair Agnes saying nought  
From out her hand the letter caught;  
And while she leaned against the stone  
Stole up to Michael's side alone,  
And with a cool, unshrinking hand  
Thrust the new scroll deep in his band,  
And turned about unto her friend;  
Who having come unto the end  
Of all her courage, trembled there  
With face upturned for fresher air,  
And parted lips grown grey and pale,  
And limbs that now began to fail,  
And hands wherefrom all strength had gone,  
Scarce fresher than the blue-veined stone  
That feeble still she strove to clutch.  
   But when she felt her lady's touch,  
Feebly she said, "Go! let me die  
And end this sudden misery  
That in such wise has wrapped my life,  
I am too weak for such a strife,  
So sick I am with shame and fear;  
Would thou hadst never brought me here!"  
   But Agnes took her hand and said,  
"Nay, queen, and must we three be dead  
Because thou fearest; all is safe  
If boldly thou wilt face Sir Rafe." <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>  
   So saying, did she draw her hence,  
Past tree and bower, and high pleached fence  
Unto the garden's further end,  
And left her there and back did wend,  
And from the house made haste to get  
A gilded maund wherein she set  
A flask of ancient island wine,  
Ripe fruits and wheaten manchets fine,  
And many such a delicate  
As goddesses in old time ate,  
Ere Helen was a Trojan queen;  
So passing through the garden green  
She cast her eager eyes again  
Upon the spot where he had lain,  
But found it empty, so sped on  
Till she at last the place had won  
Where Cecily lay weak and white  
Within that fair bower of delight.  
   Her straight she made to eat and drink,  
And said, "See now thou dost not shrink  
From this thy deed; let love slay fear  
Now, when thy life shall grow so dear,  
Each minute should seem loss to thee  
If thou for thy felicity  
Couldst stay to count them; for I say,  
This day shall be thy happy day."  
   Therewith she smiled to see the wine  
Embraced by her fingers fine;  
And her sweet face grow bright again <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
With sudden pleasure after pain.  
   Again she spoke, "What is this word  
That dreaming, I perchance, have heard,  
But certainly remember well;  
That some old soothsayer did tell  
Strange things unto my lord, the King,  
That on thy hand the spousal ring  
No Kaiser's son, no King should set,  
But one a peasant did beget—  
What sayst thou?"  
                       But the Queen flushed red;  
"Such fables I have heard," she said;  
"And thou—is it such scathe to me,  
The bride of such a man to be?"  
   "Nay," said she, "God will have him King;  
How shall we do a better thing  
With this or that one than He can;  
God's friend must be a goodly man."  
   But with that word she heard the sound  
Of folk who through the mazes wound  
Bearing the message; then she said,  
"Be strong, pluck up thine hardihead,  
Speak little, so shall all be well,  
For now our own tale will they tell."

   And even as she spoke they came  
And all the green place was aflame  
With golden raiment of the lords;  
While Cecily, noting not their words, <span id="page_206">p.
206</span>  
Rose up to go; and for her part  
By this had fate so steeled her heart,  
Scarce otherwise she seemed, than when  
She passed before the eyes of men  
At Tourney or high festival.  
But when they now had reached the hall,  
And up its very steps they went,  
Her head a little down she bent;  
Nor raised it till the dais was gained  
For fear that love some monster feigned  
To be a god, and she should be  
Smit by her own bolt wretchedly.  
But at the rustling, crowded dais  
She gathered heart her eyes to raise,  
And there beheld her love, indeed,  
Clad in her father's serving weed,  
But proud, and flushed, and calm withal,  
Fearless of aught that might befal,  
Nor too astonied, for he thought,—  
"From point to point my life is brought  
Through wonders till it comes to this;  
And trouble cometh after bliss,  
And I will bear all as I may,  
And ever as day passeth day,  
My life will hammer from the twain,  
Forging a long enduring chain."  
   But midst these thoughts their young eyes met,  
And every word did he forget  
Wherewith men name unhappiness, <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>  
As read again those words did bless  
With double blessings his glad ears,  
And if she trembled with her fears,  
And if with doubt, and love, and shame,  
The rosy colour went and came  
In her sweet cheeks and smooth bright brow,  
Little did folk think of it now,  
But as of maiden modesty,  
Shamefaced to see the bridegroom nigh.  
   And now when Rafe the Seneschal  
Had read the message down the Hall,  
And turned to her, quite calm again,  
Her face had grown, and with no pain  
She raised her serious eyes to his  
Grown soft and pensive with his bliss,  
And said,  
              "Prince, thou art welcome here,  
Where all my father loves is dear,  
And full trust do I put in thee,  
For that so great nobility  
He knoweth in thee; be as kind  
As I would be to thee, and find  
A happy life from day to day,  
Till all our days are past away."  
   What more than found the bystanders  
He found within this speech of hers,  
I know not; some faint quivering  
In the last words; some little thing  
That checked the cold words’ even flow. <span id="page_208">p.
208</span>  
But yet they set his heart aglow,  
And he in turn said eagerly:—  
   "Surely I count it nought to die  
For him who brought me unto this;  
For thee, who givest me this bliss;  
Yea, even dost me such a grace  
To look with kind eyes in my face,  
And send sweet music to my ears."  
   But at his words she, mazed with tears,  
Seemed faint, and failing quickly, when  
Above the low hum of the men  
Uprose the sweet bells’ sudden clang,  
As men unto the chapel rang;  
While just outside the singing folk  
Into most heavenly carols broke.  
And going softly up the hall  
Boys bore aloft the verges tall  
Before the bishop's gold-clad head.  
   Then forth his bride young Michael led,  
And nought to him seemed good or bad  
Except the lovely hand he had;  
But she the while was murmuring low,  
"If he could know, if he could know,  
What love, what love, his love should be!"

   But while mid mirth and minstrelsy  
The ancient Castle of the Rose  
Such pageant to the autumn shows  
The King sits ill at ease at home, <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>  
For in these days the news is come  
That he who in his line should wed,  
Lies in his own town stark and dead,  
Slain in a tumult in the street.  
   Brooding on this he deemed it meet,  
Since nigh the day was come, when she  
Her bridegroom's visage looked to see,  
To hold the settled day with her.  
And bid her at the least to wear  
Dull mourning guise for gold and white.  
So on another morning bright,  
When the whole promised month was past,  
He drew anigh the place at last  
Where Michael's dead head, looking down  
Upon the highway with a frown,  
He doubted not at last to see.  
So ’twixt the fruitful greenery  
He rode, scarce touched by care the while,  
Humming a roundel with a smile.  
   Withal, ere yet he drew anigh,  
He heard their watch-horn sound from high  
Nor wondered, for their wont was so,  
And well his banner they might know  
Amidst the stubble lands afar:  
But now a distant point of war  
He seemed to hear, and bade draw rein,  
But listening cried, "Push on again!  
They do but send forth minstrelsy  
Because my daughter thinks to see <span id="page_210">p. 210</span>  
The man who lieth on his bier."  
So on they passed, till sharp and clear  
They heard the pipe and shrill fife sound;  
And restlessly the King glanced round  
To see that he had striven for,  
The crushing of that sage's lore,  
The last confusion of that fate.  
   But drawn still nigher to the gate  
They turned a sharp bend of the road,  
And saw the pageant that abode  
The solemn coming of the King.

   For first on each side, maids did sing,  
Dressed in gold raiment; then there came  
The minstrels in their coats of flame;  
And then the many-coloured lords,  
The knights’ spears, and the swordmen's swords,  
Backed by the glittering wood of bills.  
   So now, presaging many ills,  
The King drew rein, yet none the less  
He shrank not from his hardiness,  
But thought, "Well, at the worst I die,  
And yet perchance long life may lie  
Before me—I will hold my peace;  
The dumb man's borders still increase."  
   But as he strengthened thus his heart  
He saw the crowd before him part,  
And down the long melodious lane,  
Hand locked in hand there passed the twain, <span id="page_211">p.
211</span>  
As fair as any earth has found,  
Clad as king's children are, and crowned.  
Behind them went the chiefest lords,  
And two old knights with sheathed swords  
The banners of the kingdom bore.  
   But now the King had pondered sore,  
By when they reached him, though, indeed,  
The time was short unto his need,  
Betwixt his heart's first startled pang  
And those old banner-bearers’ clang  
Anigh his saddle-bow: but he  
Across their heads scowled heavily,  
Not saying aught awhile: at last,  
Ere any glance at them he cast,  
He said, "Whence come ye? what are ye?  
What play is this ye play to me?"  
   None answered,—Cecily, faint and white,  
The rather Michael's hand clutched tight,  
And seemed to speak, but not one word  
The nearest to her could have heard.  
Then the King spoke again,—"Sir Rafe,  
Meseems this youngling came here safe  
A week agone?"  
                     "Yea, sir," he said;  
"Therefore the twain I straight did wed,  
E’en as thy letters bound me to."  
"And thus thou diddest well to do,"  
The King said. "Tell me on what day  
Her old life she did put away." <span id="page_212">p. 212</span>  
   "Sire, the eleventh day this is  
Since that they gained their earthly bliss;"  
Quoth old Sir Rafe. The King said nought,  
But with his head bowed down in thought,  
Stood a long while; but at the last  
Upward a smiling face he cast,  
And cried aloud above the folk,  
"Shout for the joining of the yoke  
Betwixt these twain; And thou, fair lord,  
Who dost so well my every word,  
Nor makest doubt of anything,  
Wear thou the collar of thy King;  
And a duke's banner, cut foursquare,  
Henceforth shall men before thee bear  
In tourney and in stricken field.  
   "But this mine heir shall bear my shield,  
Carry my banner, wear my crown,  
Ride equal with me through my town,  
Sit on the same step of the throne;  
In nothing will I reign alone;  
Nor be ye with him miscontent,  
For that with little ornament  
Of gold and folk to you he came;  
For he is of an ancient name  
That needeth not the clink of gold—  
The ancientest the world doth hold;  
For in the fertile Asian land,  
Where great Damascus now doth stand,  
Ages agone his line was born, <span id="page_213">p. 213</span>  
Ere yet men knew the gift of corn;  
And there, anigh to Paradise,  
His ancestors grew stout and wise;  
And certes he from Asia bore  
No little of their piercing lore.  
   "Look then to have great happiness,  
For every wrong shall he redress."

   Then did the people's shouting drown  
His clatter as he leapt adown;  
And taking in each hand a hand  
Of the two lovers, now did stand  
Betwixt them on the flower-strewn way,  
And to himself meanwhile ’gan say,—

   "How many an hour might I have been  
Right merry in the gardens green;  
How many a glorious day had I  
Made happy with some victory;  
What noble deeds I might have done,  
What bright renown my deeds have won;  
What blessings would have made me glad;  
What little burdens had I had;  
What calmness in the hope of praise;  
What joy of well-accomplished days,  
If I had let these things alone;  
Nor sought to sit upon my throne  
Like God between the cherubim.  
But now—but now, my days wax dim, <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>.  
And all this fairness have I tost  
Unto the winds, and all have lost  
For nought, for nought! yet will I strive  
My little end of life to live;  
Nor will I look behind me more,  
Nor forward to the doubtful shore."

   With that he made the sign to turn,  
And straight the autumn air did burn  
With many a point of steel and gold;  
And through the trees the carol rolled  
Once more, until the autumn thrush  
Far off ’gan twittering on his bush,  
Made mindful of the long-lived spring.

   So mid sweet song and tabouring,  
And shouts amid the apple-grove,  
And soft caressing of his love,  
Began the new King Michael's reign.  
Nor will the poor folk see again  
A king like him on any throne,  
Or such good deeds to all men done:  
For then, as saith the chronicle,  
It was the time, as all men tell,  
When scarce a man would stop to gaze  
At gold crowns hung above the ways.

 

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

HE ended; and midst those who heard were some  
Who, midst his tale, half dreamed they were at home,  
Round the great fire upon the winter night;  
And, with the memory of the fresh delight  
Wherewith they first had heard that story told,  
Forgetting not they were grown weak and old,  
Yet felt as if they had at least grown grey  
Within the land left for so many a day.  
He, with the gestures they were wont to see,  
So told his tale, so strange with eld was he,  
Just so he stammered, and in just such wise  
He sighed, beginning fresh, as their young eyes,  
Their ears, in happy days passed long ago,  
Had ever noted other old men do,  
When they, full filled with their quick-coming joys,  
Would gaze on old folk as on carven toys.

   But he being silent, silently awhile  
They mused on these things, masking with a smile  
The vain regrets that in their hearts arose,  
The while with eager talk the young folk chose  
The parts that pleased them; but their elder hosts  
Falling to talk, yet noted well the ghosts  
Of old desires within their wasted eyes,  
Till one by one the fresh-stirred memories,  
So bitter-sweet, flickered and died away;  
And as old men may do, whose hopes grew grey  
Before their beards, they made a little mirth  
Until the great moon rose upon the earth.
