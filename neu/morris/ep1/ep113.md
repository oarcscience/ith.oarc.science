### THE WRITING ON THE IMAGE.

#### ARGUMENT.

How on an Image that stood anciently in Rome were written certain words,
which none understood, until a Scholar, coming there, knew their
meaning, and thereby discovered great marvels, but withal died
miserably.

IN half-forgotten days of old,  
As by our fathers we were told,  
Within the town of Rome there stood  
An image cut of cornel wood,  
And on the upraised hand of it  
Men might behold these letters writ—  
"PERCUTE HIC:" which is to say,  
In that tongue that we speak to-day,  
"*Strike here!*" nor yet did any know  
The cause why this was written so.

   Thus in the middle of the square,  
In the hot sun and summer air,  
The snow-drift and the driving rain,  
That image stood, with little pain,  
For twice a hundred years and ten; <span id="page_441">p. 441</span>  
While many a band of striving men  
Were driven betwixt woe and mirth  
Swiftly across the weary earth,  
From nothing unto dark nothing:  
And many an Emperor and King,  
Passing with glory or with shame,  
Left little record of his name,  
And no remembrance of the face  
Once watched with awe for gifts or grace.  
   Fear little, then, I counsel you,  
What any son of man can do;  
Because a log of wood will last  
While many a life of man goes past,  
And all is over in short space.

   Now so it chanced that to this place  
There came a man of Sicily,  
Who when the image he did see,  
Knew full well who, in days of yore,  
Had set it there; for much strange lore,  
In Egypt and in Babylon,  
This man with painful toil had won;  
And many secret things could do;  
So verily full well he knew  
That master of all sorcery  
Who wrought the thing in days gone by,  
And doubted not that some great spell  
It guarded, but could nowise tell  
What it might be. So, day by day, <span id="page_442">p. 442</span>  
Still would he loiter on the way,  
And watch the image carefully,  
Well mocked of many a passer-by.  
   And on a day he stood and gazed  
Upon the slender finger, raised  
Against a doubtful cloudy sky,  
Nigh noontide; and thought, "Certainly  
The master who made thee so fair  
By wondrous art, had not stopped there,  
But made thee speak, had he not thought  
That thereby evil might be brought  
Upon his spell." But as he spoke,  
From out a cloud the noon sun broke  
With watery light, and shadows cold  
Then did the Scholar well behold  
How, from that finger carved to tell  
Those words, a short black shadow fell  
Upon a certain spot of ground,  
And thereon, looking all around  
And seeing none heeding, went straightway  
Whereas the finger's shadow lay,  
And with his knife about the place  
A little circle did he trace;  
Then home he turned with throbbing head,  
And forthright gat him to his bed,  
And slept until the night was late  
And few men stirred from gate to gate.  
   So when at midnight he did wake,  
Pickaxe and shovel did he take, <span id="page_443">p. 443</span>  
And, going to that now silent square,  
He found the mark his knife made there,  
And quietly with many a stroke  
The pavement of the place he broke:  
And so, the stones being set apart,  
He ’gan to dig with beating heart,  
And from the hole in haste he cast  
The marl and gravel; till at last,  
Full shoulder high, his arms were jarred,  
For suddenly his spade struck hard  
With clang against some metal thing:  
And soon he found a brazen ring,  
All green with rust, twisted, and great  
As a man's wrist, set in a plate  
Of copper, wrought all curiously  
With words unknown though plain to see,  
Spite of the rust; and flowering trees,  
And beasts, and wicked images,  
Whereat he shuddered: for he knew  
What ill things he might come to do,  
If he should still take part with these  
And that Great Master strive to please.  
   But small time had he then to stand  
And think, so straight he set his hand  
Unto the ring, but where he thought  
That by main strength it must be brought  
From out its place, to! easily  
It came away, and let him see  
A winding staircase wrought of stone,<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>  
Wherethrough the new-come wind did moan.  
   Then thought he, "If I come alive  
From out this place well shall I thrive,  
For I may look here certainly  
The treasures of a king to see,  
A mightier man than men are now.  
So in few days what man shall know  
The needy Scholar, seeing me  
Great in the place where great men be,  
The richest man in all the land?  
Beside the best then shall I stand,  
And some unheard-of palace have;  
And if my soul I may not save  
In heaven, yet here in all men's eyes  
Will I make some sweet paradise,  
With marble cloisters, and with trees  
And bubbling wells, and fantasies,  
And things all men deem strange and rare,  
And crowds of women kind and fair,  
That I may see, if so I please,  
Laid on the flowers, or mid the trees  
With half-clad bodies wandering.  
There, dwelling happier than the king.  
What lovely days may yet be mine!  
How shall I live with love and wine,  
And music, till I come to die!  
And then——Who knoweth certainly  
What haps to us when we are dead?  
Truly I think by likelihead <span id="page_445">p. 445</span>  
Nought haps to us of good or bad;  
Therefore on earth will I be glad  
A short space, free from hope or fear;  
And fearless will I enter here  
And meet my fate, whatso it be."

   Now on his back a bag had he,  
To bear what treasure he might win,  
And therewith now did he begin  
To go adown the winding stair;  
And found the walls all painted fair  
With images of many a thing,  
Warrior and priest, and queen and king,  
But nothing knew what they might be.  
Which things full clearly could he see,  
For lamps were hung up here and there  
Of strange device, but wrought right fair,  
And pleasant savour came from them.  
   At last a curtain, on whose hem  
Unknown words in red gold were writ,  
He reached, and softly raising it  
Stepped back, for now did he behold  
A goodly hall hung round with gold,  
And at the upper end could see  
Sitting, a glorious company:  
Therefore he trembled, thinking well  
They were no men, but fiends of hell.  
But while he waited, trembling sore,  
And doubtful of his late-learned lore, <span id="page_446">p.
446</span>  
A cold blast of the outer air  
Blew out the lamps upon the stair  
And all was dark behind him; then  
Did he fear less to face those men  
Than, turning round, to leave them there  
While he went groping up the stair.  
Yea, since he heard no cry or call  
Or any speech from them at all,  
He doubted they were images  
Set there some dying king to please  
By that Great Master of the art;  
Therefore at last with stouter heart  
He raised the cloth and entered in  
In hope that happy life to win,  
And drawing nigher did behold  
That these were bodies dead and cold  
Attired in full royal guise,  
And wrought by art in such a wise  
That living they all seemed to be,  
Whose very eyes he well could see,  
That now beheld not foul or fair,  
Shining as though alive they were.  
And midmost of that company  
An ancient king that man could see,  
A mighty man, whose beard of grey  
A foot over his gold gown lay;  
And next beside him sat his queen  
Who in a flowery gown of green  
And golden mantle well was clad, <span id="page_447">p. 447</span>  
And on her neck a collar had  
Too heavy for her dainty breast;  
Her loins by such a belt were prest  
That whoso in his treasury  
Held that alone, a king might be.  
On either side of these, a lord  
Stood heedfully before the board,  
And in their hands held bread and wine  
For service; behind these did shine  
The armour of the guards, and then  
The well-attired serving-men,  
The minstrels clad in raiment meet;  
And over against the royal seat  
Was hung a lamp, although no flame  
Was burning there, but there was set  
Within its open golden fret  
A huge carbuncle, red and bright;  
Wherefrom there shone forth such a light  
That great hall was as clear by it,  
As though by wax it had been lit,  
As some great church at Easter-tide.  
   Now set a little way aside,  
Six paces from the dais stood  
An image made of brass and wood,  
In likeness of a full armed knight  
Who pointed ’gainst the ruddy light  
A huge shaft ready in a bow.  
   Pondering how he could come to know  
What all these marvellous matters meant, <span id="page_448">p.
448</span>  
About the hall the scholar went,  
Trembling, though nothing moved as yet;  
And for awhile did he forget  
The longings that had brought him there  
In wondering at these marvels fair;  
And still for fear he doubted much  
One jewel of their robes to touch.

   But as about the hall he passed  
He grew more used to them at last,  
And thought, "Swiftly the time goes by,  
And now no doubt the day draws nigh  
Folk will be stirring: by my head  
A fool I am to fear the dead,  
Who have seen living things enow,  
Whose very names no man can know,  
Whose shapes brave men might well affright  
More than the lion in the night  
Wandering for food;" therewith he drew  
Unto those royal corpses two,  
That on dead brows still wore the crown;  
And midst the golden cups set down  
The rugged wallet from his back,  
Patched of strong leather, brown and black.  
Then, opening wide its mouth, took up  
From off the board, a golden cup  
The King's dead hand was laid upon,  
Whose unmoved eyes upon him shone  
And recked no more of that last shame <span id="page_449">p.
449</span>  
Than if he were the beggar lame,  
Who in old days was wont to wait  
For a dog's meal beside the gate.  
   Of which shame nought our man did reck,  
But laid his hand upon the neck  
Of the slim Queen, and thence undid  
The jewelled collar, that straight slid  
Down her smooth bosom to the board.  
And when these matters he had stored  
Safe in his sack, with both their crowns,  
The jewelled parts of their rich gowns,  
Their shoes and belts, brooches and rings,  
And cleared the board of all rich things,  
He staggered with them down the hall..  
But as he went his eyes did fall  
Upon a wonderful green stone,  
Upon the hall-floor laid alone;  
He said, "Though thou art not so great  
To add by much unto the weight  
Of this my sack indeed, yet thou,  
Certes, would make me rich enow,  
That verily with thee I might  
Wage one-half of the world to fight  
The other half of it, and I  
The lord of all the world might die;—  
I will not leave thee;" therewithal  
He knelt down midmost of the hall,  
Thinking it would come easily  
Into his hand; but when that he <span id="page_450">p. 450</span>  
Gat hold of it, full fast it stack,  
So fuming, down he laid his sack,  
And with both hands pulled lustily,  
But as he strained, he cast his eye  
Unto the daïs, and saw there  
The image who the great bow bare  
Moving the bowstring to his ear,  
So, shrieking out aloud for fear,  
Of that rich stone he loosed his hold  
And catching up his bag of gold,  
Gat to his feet: but ere he stood  
The evil thing of brass and wood  
Up to his ear the notches drew;  
And clanging forth the arrow flew,  
And midmost of the carbuncle  
Clanging again, the forked barbs fell,  
And all was dark as pitch straightway.

   So there until the judgment day  
Shall come and find his bones laid low,  
And raise them up for weal or woe,  
This man must bide; cast down he lay  
While all his past life day by day  
In one short moment he could see  
Laid out before him, while that he  
In terror by that fatal stone  
Was laid, and scarcely dared to moan.  
But in a while his hope returned,  
And then, though nothing he discerned, <span id="page_451">p.
451</span>  
He gat him up upon his feet,  
And all about the walls he beat  
To find some token of the door,  
But never could he find it more,  
For by some dreadful sorcery  
All was sealed close as it might be,  
And midst the marvels of that hall  
This scholar found the end of all.

   But in the town on that same night,  
An hour before the dawn of light,  
Such storm upon the place there fell,  
That not the oldest man could tell  
Of such another: and thereby  
The image was burnt utterly,  
Being stricken from the clouds above;  
And folk deemed that same bolt did move  
The pavement where that wretched one  
Unto his foredoomed fate had gone,  
Because the plate was set again  
Into its place, and the great rain  
Washed the earth down, and sorcery  
Had hid the place where it did lie.  
   So soon the stones were set all straight,  
But yet the folk, afraid of fate,  
Where once the man of cornel wood  
Through many a year of bad and good  
Had kept his place, set up alone  
Great Jove himself, cut in white stone, <span id="page_452">p.
452</span>  
But thickly overlaid with gold.  
"Which," saith my tale, "you may behold  
Unto this day, although indeed  
Some Lord or other, being in need,  
Took every ounce of gold away."  
   But now, this tale in some past day  
Being writ, I warrant all is gone,  
Both gold and weather-beaten stone.

   Be merry, masters, while ye may,  
For men much quicker pass away.

 

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

THEY praised the tale, and for awhile they talked  
Of other tales of treasure-seekers balked,  
And shame and loss for men insatiate stored,  
Nitocris’ tomb, the Niflungs’ fatal hoard,  
The serpent-guarded treasures of the dead;  
Then of how men would be remembered  
When they are gone; and more than one could tell  
Of what unhappy things therefrom befel;  
Or how by folly men have gained a name;  
A name indeed, not hallowed by the fame  
Of any deeds remembered: and some thought,—  
'Strange hopes and fears for what shall be but nought  
To dead men! better it would be to give  
What things they may, while on the earth they live  
Unto the earth, and from the bounteous earth  
To take their pay of sorrow or of mirth,  
Hatred or love, and get them on their way;  
And let the teeming earth fresh troubles make  
For other men, and ever for their sake  
Use what they left, when they are gone from it.'

   But while amid such musings they did sit,  
Dark night being come, men lighted up the hall,  
And the chief man for minstrelsy did call,  
And other talk their dull thoughts chased away,  
Nor did they part till night was mixed with day.
