<p><A NAME="page_588"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 588</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PYGMALION AND THE IMAGE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">A MAN of Cyprus, a Sculptor named Pygmalion, made an Image of a Woman, fairer than any that had yet been seen, and in the end came to love his own handiwork as though it had been alive: wherefore, praying to Venus for help, he obtained his end, for she made the Image alive indeed, and a Woman, and Pygmalion wedded her.</FONT></p>  
<p>AT Amathus, that from the southern side<br> Of Cyprus, looks across the Syrian sea,<br> There did in ancient time a man abide<br> Known to the island-dwellers, for that he<br> Had wrought most godlike works in imagery,<br> And day by day still greater honour won,<br> Which man our old books call Pygmalion.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in the praise of men small joy he had,<br> But walked abroad with downcast brooding face,<br> Nor yet by any damsel was made glad;<br> For, sooth to say, the women of that place<br> Must seem to all men an accursed race,<br> Who with the turner of all hearts once strove<br> So in their hearts must carry lust for love. <A NAME="page_589"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 589</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a day it chanced that he had been<br> About the streets, and on the crowded quays,<br> Rich with unopened wealth of bales, had seen<br> The dark-eyed merchants of the southern seas<br> In chaffer with the base Prop&#156;tides,<br> And heavy-hearted gat him home again,<br> His once-loved life grown idle, poor, and vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there upon his images he cast<br> His weary eyes, yet little noted them,<br> As still from name to name his swift thought passed.<br> For what to him was Juno's well-wrought hem,<br> Diana's shaft, or Pallas&#146; olive-stem?<br> What help could Hermes&#146; rod unto him give,<br> Until with shadowy things he came to live?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet note, that though, while looking on the sun,<br> The craftsman o&#146;er his work some morn of spring<br> May chide his useless labour never done,<br> For all his murmurs, with no other thing<br> He soothes his heart, and dulls thoughts&#146; poisonous sting,<br> And thus in thought's despite the world goes on;<br> And so it was with this Pygmalion.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the chisel must he set his hand,<br> And slowly, still in troubled thought must pace,<br> About a work begun, that there doth stand,<br> And still returning to the self-same place,<br> Unto the image now must set his face, <A NAME="page_590"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 590</FONT></A><br> And with a sigh his wonted toil begin,<br> Half-loathed, half-loved, a little rest to win.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lessening marble that he worked upon,<br> A woman's form now imaged doubtfully,<br> And in such guise the work had he begun,<br> Because when he the untouched block did see<br> In wandering veins that form there seemed to be,<br> Whereon he cried out in a careless mood,<br> "O lady Venus, make this presage good!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then this block of stone shall be thy maid,<br> And, not without rich golden ornament,<br> Shall bide within thy quivering myrtle-shade."<br> So spoke he, but the goddess, well content,<br> Unto his hand such godlike mastery sent,<br> That like the first artificer he wrought,<br> Who made the gift that woe to all men brought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, but such as he was wont to do,<br> At first indeed that work divine he deemed,<br> And as the white chips from the chisel flew<br> Of other matters languidly he dreamed,<br> For easy to his hand that labour seemed,<br> And he was stirred with many a troubling thought,<br> And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, again, at last there came a day<br> When smoother and more shapely grew the stone, <A NAME="page_591"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 591</FONT></A><br> And he, grown eager, put all thought away<br> But that which touched his craftsmanship alone,<br> And he would gaze at what his hands had done,<br> Until his heart with boundless joy would swell<br> That all was wrought so wonderfully well.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet long it was ere he was satisfied,<br> And with his pride that by his mastery<br> This thing was done, whose equal far and wide<br> In no town of the world a man could see,<br> Came burning longing that the work should be<br> E&#146;en better still, and to his heart there came<br> A strange and strong desire he could not name.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night seemed long, and long the twilight seemed,<br> A vain thing seemed his flowery garden fair;<br> Though through the night still of his work he dreamed,<br> And though his smooth-stemmed trees so nigh it were,<br> That thence he could behold the marble hair;<br> Nought was enough, until with steel in hand<br> He came before the wondrous stone to stand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No song could charm him, and no histories<br> Of men's misdoings could avail him now,<br> Nay, scarcely seaward had he turned his eyes,<br> If men had said, "the fierce Tyrrhenians row<br> Up through the bay, rise up and strike a blow<br> For life and goods;" for nought to him seemed dear<br> But to his well-loved work to be anear. <A NAME="page_592"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 592</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then vexed he grew, and knowing not his heart,<br> Unto himself he said, "Ah, what is this,<br> That I who oft was happy to depart,<br> And wander where the boughs each other kiss<br> &#146;Neath the west wind, now have no other bliss<br> But in vain smoothing of this marble maid,<br> Whose chips this month a drachma had outweighed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo I will get me to the woods and try<br> If I my woodcraft have forgotten quite,<br> And then, returning, lay this folly by,<br> And eat my fill, and sleep my sleep a-night,<br> And &#146;gin to carve a Hercules aright<br> Upon the morrow, and perchance indeed<br> The Theban will be good to me at need."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he took his quiver and his bow,<br> And through the gates of Amathus he went,<br> And toward the mountain slopes began to go,<br> Within the woods to work out his intent.<br> Fair was the day, the honied beanfield's scent<br> The west wind bore unto him; o&#146;er the way<br> The glittering noisy poplar leaves did play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things were moving; as his hurried feet<br> Passed by, within the flowery swathe he heard<br> The sweeping of the scythe, the swallow fleet<br> Rose over him, the sitting partridge stirred<br> On the field's edge; the brown bee by him whirred, <A NAME="page_593"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 593</FONT></A><br> Or murmured in the clover flowers below.<br> But he with bowed-down head failed not to go.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he stopped, and, looking round, he said,<br> "Like one whose thirtieth year is well gone by,<br> The day is getting ready to be dead;<br> No rest, and on the border of the sky<br> Already the great banks of dark haze lie;<br> No rest&#151;what do I midst this stir and noise?<br> What part have I in these unthinking joys?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he turned, and toward the city-gate<br> Through the sweet fields went swifter than he came,<br> And cast his heart into the hands of fate;<br> Nor strove with it, when higher &#146;gan to flame<br> That strange and strong desire without a name;<br> Till panting, thinking of nought else, once more<br> His hand was on the latch of his own door.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment there he lingered, as he said,<br> "Alas! what should I do if she were gone."<br> But even with that word his brow waxed red<br> To hear his own lips name a thing of stone,<br> As though the gods some marvel there had done,<br> And made his work alive; and therewithal<br> In turn great pallor on his face did fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with a sigh he passed into the house,<br> Yet even then his chamber-door must hold, <A NAME="page_594"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 594</FONT></A><br> And listen there, half-blind and timorous,<br> Until his heart should wax a little bold;<br> Then entering, motionless and white and cold<br> He saw the image stand amidst the floor<br> That whitened was by labour done before.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinded with tears, his chisel up he caught,<br> And, drawing near, and sighing, tenderly<br> Upon the marvel of the face he wrought,<br> E&#146;en as he used to pass the long days by;<br> But his sighs changed to sobbing presently,<br> And on the floor the useless steel he flung,<br> And, weeping loud, about the image clung.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" he cried, "why have I made thee then,<br> That thus thou mockest me? I know indeed<br> That many such as thou are loved of men,<br> Whose passionate eyes poor wretches still will lead<br> Into their net, and smile to see them bleed;<br> But these the Gods made, and this hand made thee<br> Who wilt not speak one little word to me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the image did he draw aback<br> To gaze on it through tears: and you had said,<br> Regarding it, that little did it lack<br> To be a living and most lovely maid;<br> Naked it was, its unbound locks were laid<br> Over the lovely shoulders; with one hand<br> Reached out, as to a lover, did it stand, <A NAME="page_595"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 595</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other held a fair rose over-blown;<br> No smile was on the parted lips, the eyes<br> Seemed as if even now great love had shown<br> Unto them, something of its sweet surprise,<br> Yet saddened them with half-seen mysteries,<br> And still midst passion maiden-like she seemed,<br> As though of love unchanged for aye she dreamed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproachfully beholding all her grace,<br> Pygmalion stood, until he grew dry-eyed,<br> And then at last he turned away his face<br> As if from her cold eyes his grief to hide;<br> And thus a weary while did he abide,<br> With nothing in his heart but vain desire,<br> The ever-burning, unconsuming fire.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when again he turned his visage round<br> His eyes were brighter and no more he wept,<br> As if some little solace he had found,<br> Although his folly none the more had slept,<br> Rather some new-born god-sent madness kept<br> His other madness from destroying him,<br> And made the hope of death wax faint and dim:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, trembling and ashamed, from out the street<br> Strong men he called, and faint with jealousy<br> He caused them bear the ponderous, moveless feet<br> Unto the chamber where he used to lie,<br> So in a fair niche to his bed a-nigh, <A NAME="page_596"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 596</FONT></A><br> Unwitting of his woe, they set it down,<br> Then went their ways beneath his troubled frown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to his treasury he went, and sought<br> For gems for its adornment, but all there<br> Seemed to his eager eyes but poor and nought,<br> Not worthy e&#146;en to touch her rippled hair,<br> So he, departing, through the streets &#146;gan fare,<br> And from the merchants at a mighty cost<br> Bought gems that kings for no good deed had lost.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then he hung her senseless neck around,<br> Set on her fingers, and fair arms of stone,<br> Then cast himself before her on the ground,<br> Praying for grace for all that he had done<br> In leaving her untended and alone;<br> And still with every hour his madness grew<br> Though all his folly in his heart he knew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last asleep before her feet he lay,<br> Worn out with passion, yet this burning pain<br> Returned on him, when with the light of day<br> He woke and wept before her feet again;<br> Then of the fresh and new-born morning fain,<br> Into his garden passed, and therefrom bore<br> Fresh spoil of flowers his love to lay before.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little altar, with fine gold o&#146;erlaid,<br> Was in his house, that he a while ago <A NAME="page_597"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 597</FONT></A><br> At some great man's command had deftly made,<br> And this he now must take and set below<br> Her well-wrought feet, and there must red flame glow<br> About sweet wood, and he must send her thence<br> The odour of Arabian frankincense.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as the smoke went up, he prayed and said,<br> "Thou, image, hear&#146;st me not, nor wilt thou speak,<br> But I perchance shall know when I am dead,<br> If this has been some goddess&#146; sport, to seek<br> A wretch, and in his heart infirm and weak<br> To set her glorious image, so that he,<br> Loving the form of immortality,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May make much laughter for the gods above:<br> Hear me, and if my love misliketh thee<br> Then take my life away, for I will love<br> Till death unfeared at last shall come to me,<br> And give me rest, if he of might may be<br> To slay the love of that which cannot die,<br> The heavenly beauty that can ne&#146;er pass by."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No word indeed the moveless image said,<br> But with the sweet grave eyes his hands had wrought<br> Still gazed down on his bowed imploring head,<br> Yet his own words some solace to him brought,<br> Gilding the net wherein his soul was caught<br> With something like to hope, and all that day<br> Some tender words he ever found to say; <A NAME="page_598"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 598</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still he felt as something heard him speak;<br> Sometimes he praised her beauty, and sometimes<br> Reproached her in a feeble voice and weak,<br> And at the last drew forth a book of rhymes,<br> Wherein were writ the tales of many climes,<br> And read aloud the sweetness hid therein<br> Of lovers&#146; sorrows and their tangled sin.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the sun went down, the frankincense<br> Again upon the altar-flame he cast<br> That through the open window floating thence<br> O&#146;er the fresh odours of the garden passed;<br> And so another day was gone at last,<br> And he no more his love-lorn watch could keep,<br> But now for utter weariness must sleep.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the night he dreamed that she was gone,<br> And knowing that he dreamed, tried hard to wake<br> And could not, but forsaken and alone<br> He seemed to weep as though his heart would break,<br> And when the night her sleepy veil did take<br> From off the world, waking, his tears he found<br> Still wet upon the pillow all around.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the first, bewildered by those tears,<br> He fell a-wondering wherefore he had wept,<br> But suddenly remembering all his fears,<br> Panting with terror, from the bed he leapt,<br> But still its wonted place the image kept, <A NAME="page_599"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 599</FONT></A><br> Nor moved for all the joyful ecstasy<br> Wherewith he blessed the day that showed it nigh.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the morning offering and the day,<br> Midst flowers and words of love and kisses sweet<br> From morn, through noon, to evening passed away,<br> And scarce unhappy, crouching at her feet,<br> He saw the sun descend the sea to meet;<br> And scarce unhappy through the darkness crept<br> Unto his bed, and midst soft dreaming slept.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT the next morn, e&#146;en while the incense-smoke<br> At sun-rising curled round about her head,<br> Sweet sound of songs the wonted quiet broke<br> Down in the street, and he by something led,<br> He knew not what, must leave his prayer unsaid,<br> And through the freshness of the morn must see<br> The folk who went with that sweet minstrelsy;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damsels and youths in wonderful attire,<br> And in their midst upon a car of gold<br> An image of the Mother of Desire,<br> Wrought by his hands in days that seemed grown old,<br> Though those sweet limbs a garment did enfold,<br> Coloured like flame, enwrought with precious things,<br> Most fit to be the prize of striving kings. <A NAME="page_600"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 600</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he remembered that the manner was<br> That fair-clad priests the lovely Queen should take<br> Thrice in the year, and through the city pass,<br> And with sweet songs the dreaming folk awake;<br> And through the clouds a light there seemed to break<br> When he remembered all the tales well told<br> About her glorious kindly deeds of old.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So his unfinished prayer he finished not,<br> But, kneeling, once more kissed the marble feet,<br> And, while his heart with many thoughts waxed hot,<br> He clad himself with fresh attire and meet<br> For that bright service, and with blossoms sweet<br> Entwined with tender leaves he crowned his head,<br> And followed after as the goddess led.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But long and vain unto him seemed the way<br> Until they came unto her house again;<br> Long years, the while they went about to lay<br> The honey-hiding dwellers on the plain,<br> The sweet companions of the yellowing grain<br> Upon her golden altar; long and long<br> Before, at end of their delicious song,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reverend hands they stripped her of her weed,<br> And showed the ivory limbs his hand had wrought;<br> Yea, and too long e&#146;en then ere those fair bands,<br> Dispersing here and there, the shadow sought<br> Beside the stream, or in some marble court <A NAME="page_601"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 601</FONT></A><br> Lay toward the splashing of the fountain turned,<br> For now past noon high up the hot sun burned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the crowd of worshippers was gone,<br> And through the golden dimness of the place<br> The goddess&#146; very servants paced alone,<br> Or some lone damsel murmured of her case<br> Apart from prying eyes, he turned his face<br> Unto that image made with toil and care,<br> In days when unto him it seemed most fair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusky and dim, though rich with gems and gold,<br> The house of Venus was; high in the dome<br> The burning sun-light you might now behold,<br> From nowhere else the light of day Might come,<br> To curse the Shame-faced Mother's lovely home;<br> A long way off the shrine, the fresh sea-breeze,<br> Now just arising, brushed the myrtle-trees.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torches of the flower-crowned, singing band<br> Erewhile, indeed, made more than daylight there,<br> Lighting the painted tales of many a land,<br> And carven heroes, with their unused glare;<br> But now a few soft, glimmering lamps there were,<br> And on the altar a thin, flickering flame<br> Just showed the golden letters of her name.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue in the dome yet hung the incense-cloud,<br> And still its perfume lingered all around; <A NAME="page_602"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 602</FONT></A><br> And, trodden by the light-foot, fervent crowd,<br> Thick lay the summer flowers upon the ground,<br> And now from far-off halls uprose the sound<br> Of Lydian music, and the dancer's cry,<br> As though some door were opened suddenly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there he stood, that help from her to gain,<br> Bewildered by that twilight midst of day;<br> Downcast with listening to the joyous strain<br> He had no part in, hopeless with delay<br> Of all the fair things he had meant to say;<br> Yet, as the incense on the flame he cast,<br> From stammering lips and pale these words there passed,&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O thou forgotten help, dost thou yet know<br> What thing it is I need, when even I,<br> Bent down before thee in this shame and woe,<br> Can frame no set of words to tell thee why<br> I needs must pray, O help me or I die!<br> Or slay me, and in slaying take from me<br> Even a dead man's feeble memory.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say not thine help I have been slow to seek;<br> Here have I been from the first hour of morn,<br> Who stand before thy presence faint and weak,<br> Of my one poor delight left all forlorn;<br> Trembling with many fears, the hope outworn<br> I had when first I left my love, my shame,<br> To call upon thine oft-sung glorious name." <A NAME="page_603"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 603</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped to catch his breath, for as a sob<br> Did each word leave his mouth; but suddenly,<br> Like a live thing, the thin flame &#146;gan to throb<br> And gather force, and then shot up on high<br> A steady spike of light, that drew anigh<br> The sunbeam in the dome, then sank once more<br> Into a feeble flicker as before.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at that sight the nameless hope he had<br> That kept him living midst unhappiness,<br> Stirred his breast, and with changed face and glad<br> Unto the image forward must he press<br> With words of praise his first word to redress,<br> But then it was as though a thick black cloud<br> Altar, and fire, and ivory limbs did shroud.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He staggered back, amazed and full of awe;<br> But when, with anxious eyes, he gazed around,<br> About him still the worshippers he saw<br> Sunk in their wonted works, with no surprise<br> At what to him seemed awful mysteries;<br> Therewith he sighed and said, "This, too, I dream,<br> No better day upon my life shall beam."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for long upon the place he gazed<br> Where other folk beheld the lovely queen;<br> And while he looked the dusky veil seemed raised,<br> And every thing was as it erst had been;<br> And then he said, "Such marvels I have seen <A NAME="page_604"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 604</FONT></A><br> As some sick man may see from off his bed:<br> Ah, I am sick, and would that I were dead!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith, not questioning his heart at all,<br> He turned away and left the holy place,<br> When now the wide sun reddened towards his fall,<br> And a fresh west wind held the clouds in chase;<br> But coming out, at first he hid his face<br> Dazed with the light, and in the porch he stood,<br> Nor wished to move, or change his dreary mood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in a while the freshness of the eve<br> Pierced to his weary heart, and with a sigh<br> He raised his head, and slowly &#146;gan to leave<br> The high carved pillars; and so presently<br> Had passed the grove of whispering myrtles by,<br> And, mid the many noises of the street,<br> Made himself brave the eyes of men to meet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thronged were the ways with folk in gay attire,<br> Nursing the end of that festivity;<br> Girls fit to move the moody man's desire<br> Brushed past him, and soft dainty minstrelsy<br> He heard amid the laughter, and might see,<br> Through open doors, the garden's green delight,<br> Where pensive lovers waited for the night;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or resting dancers round the fountain drawn,<br> With faces flushed unto the breeze turned round, <A NAME="page_605"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 605</FONT></A><br> Or wandering o&#146;er the fragrant trodden lawn,<br> Took up their fallen garlands from the ground,<br> Or languidly their scattered tresses bound,<br> Or let their gathered raiment fall adown,<br> With eyes downcast beneath their lovers&#146; frown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What hope Pygmalion yet might have, when he<br> First left the pillars of the dreamy place,<br> Amid such sights had vanished utterly.<br> He turned his weary eyes from face to face,<br> Nor noted them, as at a lagging pace<br> He &#146;gat towards home, and still was murmuring,<br> "Ah life, sweet life! the only godlike thing!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he went, though longing to be there<br> Whereas his sole desire awaited him,<br> Yet did he loath to see the image fair,<br> White and unchanged of face, unmoved of limb,<br> And to his heart came dreamy thoughts and dim<br> That unto some strange region he might come,<br> Nor ever reach again his loveless home.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet soon, indeed, before his door he stood,<br> And, as a man awaking from a dream,<br> Seemed waked from his old folly; nought seemed good<br> In all the things that he before had deemed<br> At least worth life, and on his heart there streamed<br> Cold light of day&#151;he found himself alone,<br> Reft of desire, all love and madness gone. <A NAME="page_606"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 606</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet for that past folly must he weep,<br> As one might mourn the parted happiness<br> That, mixed with madness, made him smile in sleep;<br> And still some lingering sweetness seemed to bless<br> The hard life left of toil and loneliness,<br> Like a past song too sweet, and over short<br> Within the meshes of the memory caught.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping he entered, murmuring, "O fair Queen,<br> I thank thee that my prayer was not for nought,<br> Truly a present helper hast thou been<br> To those who faithfully thy throne have sought!<br> Yet, since with pain deliverance I have bought,<br> Hast thou not yet some gift in store for me,<br> That I thine happy slave henceforth may be?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THUS to his chamber at the last he came,<br> And, pushing through the still half-opened door,<br> He stood within; but there, for very shame<br> Of all the things that he had done before,<br> Still kept his eyes bent down upon the floor,<br> Thinking of all that he had done and said<br> Since he had wrought that luckless marble maid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet soft his thoughts were, and the very place<br> Seemed perfumed with some nameless heavenly air <A NAME="page_607"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 607</FONT></A><br> So gaining courage, did he raise his face<br> Unto the work his hands had made so fair,<br> And cried aloud to see the niche all bare<br> Of that sweet form, while through his heart again<br> There shot a pang of his old yearning pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet while he stood, and knew not what to do<br> With yearning, a strange thrill of hope there came,<br> A shaft of new desire now pierced him through,<br> And therewithal a soft voice called his name,<br> And when he turned, with eager eyes aflame,<br> He saw betwixt him and the setting sun<br> The lively image of his loved one.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled at the sight, for though her eyes,<br> Her very lips, were such as he had made,<br> And though her tresses fell but in such guise<br> As he had wrought them, now was she arrayed<br> In that fair garment that the priests had laid<br> Upon the goddess on that very morn,<br> Dyed like the setting sun upon the corn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless he stood, but she now drew anear,<br> Simple and sweet as she was wont to be,<br> And once again her silver voice rang clear,<br> Filling his soul with great felicity,<br> And thus she spoke, "Wilt thou not come to me,<br> O dear companion of my new-found life,<br> For I am called thy lover and thy wife? <A NAME="page_608"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 608</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, these words the Dread One bade me say<br> That was with me e&#146;ennow, <i>Pygmalion,<br> My new-made soul I give to thee to-day,<br> Come, feel the sweet breath that thy prayer has won,<br> And lay thine hand this heaving breast upon!<br> Come love, and walk with me between the trees,<br> And feel the freshness of the evening breeze</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>"Sweep mine hair round thy neck; behold my feet,<br> The oft-kissed feet thou thoughtst should never move<br> Press down the daisies! draw me to thee, sweet,<br> And feel the warm heart of thy living love<br> Beat against thine, and bless the Seed of Jove<br> Whose loving tender heart hath wrought all this,<br> And wrapped us both in such a cloud of bliss</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, thou art wise to know what this may mean!<br> Sweet seem the words to me, and needs must I<br> Speak all the lesson of the lovely queen:<br> But this I know, I would we were more nigh,<br> I have not heard thy voice but in the cry<br> Thou utteredst then, when thou believedst me gone<br> The marvel of thine hands, the maid of stone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached her hand to him, and with kind eyes<br> Gazed into his; but he the fingers caught<br> And drew her to him, and midst ecstasies<br> Passing all words, yea, well-nigh passing thought,<br> Felt that sweet breath that he so long had sought, <A NAME="page_609"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 609</FONT></A><br> Felt the warm life within her heaving breast<br> As in his arms his living love he pressed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as his cheek touched hers he heard her say,<br> "Wilt thou not speak, O love? why dost thou weep?<br> Art thou then sorry for this long-wished day,<br> Or dost thou think perchance thou wilt not keep<br> This that thou holdest, but in dreamy sleep?<br> Nay, let us do the bidding of the Queen,<br> And hand in hand walk through thy garden green;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then shalt thou tell me, still beholding me,<br> Full many things whereof I wish to know,<br> And as we walk from whispering tree to tree<br> Still more familiar to thee shall I grow,<br> And such things shalt thou say unto me now<br> As when thou deemedst thou wast quite alone,<br> A madman, kneeling to a thing of stone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at that word a smile lit up his eyes<br> And therewithal he spake some loving word,<br> And she at first looked up in grave surprise<br> When his deep voice and musical she heard,<br> And clung to him as somewhat grown afeard;<br> Then cried aloud and said, "O mighty one!<br> What joy with thee to look upon the sun."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then into that fair garden did they pass<br> And all the story of his love he told, <A NAME="page_610"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 610</FONT></A><br> And as the twain went o&#146;er the dewy grass,<br> Beneath the risen moon could he behold<br> The bright tears trickling down, then, waxen bold,<br> He stopped and said, "Ah, love, what meaneth this?<br> Seest thou how tears still follow earthly bliss?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then both her white arms round his neck she threw,<br> And sobbing said, "O love, what hurteth me?<br> When first the sweetness of my life I knew,<br> Not this I felt, but when I first saw thee<br> A little pain and great felicity<br> Rose up within me, and thy talk e&#146;en now<br> Made pain and pleasure ever greater grow?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O sweet," he said, "this thing is even love,<br> Whereof I told thee; that all wise men fear,<br> But yet escape not; nay, to gods above,<br> Unless the old tales lie, it draweth near.<br> But let my happy ears I pray thee hear<br> Thy story too, and how thy blessed birth<br> Has made a heaven of this once lonely earth."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sweet," she said, "as yet I am not wise,<br> Or stored with words, aright the tale to tell,<br> But listen: when I opened first mine eyes<br> I stood within the niche thou knowest well,<br> And from mine hand a heavy thing there fell<br> Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear,<br> And but a strange confused noise could hear. <A NAME="page_611"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 611</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At last mine eyes could see a woman fair,<br> But awful as this round white moon o&#146;erhead,<br> So that I trembled when I saw her there,<br> For with my life was born some touch of dread,<br> And therewithal I heard her voice that said,<br> 'Come down, and learn to love and be alive,<br> For thee, a well-prized gift, to-day I give.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then on the floor I stepped, rejoicing much,<br> Not knowing why, not knowing aught at all,<br> Till she reached out her hand my breast to touch,<br> And when her fingers thereupon did fall,<br> Thought came unto my life, and therewithal<br> I knew her for a goddess, and began<br> To murmur in some tongue unknown to man.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then indeed not in this guise was I,<br> No sandals had I, and no saffron gown,<br> But naked as thou knowest utterly,<br> E&#146;en as my limbs beneath thine hand had grown,<br> And this fair perfumed robe then fell adown<br> Over the goddess&#146; feet and swept the ground,<br> And round her loins a glittering belt was bound.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when the stammering of my tongue she heard<br> Upon my trembling lips her hand she laid,<br> And spoke again, 'Nay, say not any word,<br> All that thine heart would say I know unsaid,<br> Who even now thine heart and voice have made; <A NAME="page_612"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 612</FONT></A><br> But listen rather, for thou knowest now<br> What these words mean, and still wilt wiser grow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Thy body, lifeless till I gave it life,<br> A certain man, my servant, well hath wrought,<br> I give thee to him as his love and wife,<br> With all thy dowry of desire and thought,<br> Since this his yearning heart hath ever sought;<br> Now from my temple is he on the way,<br> Deeming to find thee e&#146;en as yesterday;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' Bide thou his coming by the bed-head there,<br> And when thou seest him set his eyes upon<br> Thine empty niche, and hear&#146;st him cry for care,<br> Then call him by his name, Pygmalion,<br> And certainly thy lover hast thou won;<br> But when he stands before thee silently,<br> Say all these words that I shall teach to thee.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With that she said what first I told thee, love,<br> And then went on, 'Moreover thou shalt say<br> That I, the daughter of almighty Jove,<br> Have wrought for him this long-desired day;<br> In sign whereof, these things that pass away,<br> Wherein mine image men have well arrayed,<br> I give thee for thy wedding gear, O maid.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therewith her raiment she put off from her,<br> And laid bare all her perfect loveliness, <A NAME="page_613"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 613</FONT></A><br> And, smiling on me, came yet more anear,<br> And on my mortal lips her lips did press,<br> And said, 'Now herewith shalt thou love no less<br> Than Psyche loved my son in days of old;<br> Farewell, of thee shall many a tale be told.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And even with that last word was she gone,<br> How, I know not, and I my limbs arrayed<br> In her fair gifts, and waited thee alone&#151;<br> Ah, love, indeed the word is true she said,<br> For now I love thee so, I grow afraid<br> Of what the gods upon our heads may send&#151;<br> I love thee so, I think upon the end."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What words he said? How can I tell again<br> What words they said beneath the glimmering light,<br> Some tongue they used unknown to loveless men<br> As each to each they told their great delight,<br> Until for stillness of the growing night<br> Their soft sweet murmuring words seemed growing loud,<br> And dim the moon grew, hid by fleecy cloud.</p>

<p>SUCH was the ending of his ancient rhyme,<br> That seemed to fit that soft and golden time,<br> When men were happy, they could scarce tell why,<br> Although they felt the rich year slipping by.<br> The sun went down, the harvest-moon arose,<br> And &#146;twixt the slim trees of that fruitful close<br> They saw the corn still falling &#146;neath its light,<br> While through the soft air of the windless night<br> The voices of the reapers&#146; mates rang clear<br> In measured song, as of the fruitful year<br> They told, and its delights, and now and then<br> The rougher voices of the toiling men<br> Joined in the song, as one by one released<br> From that hard toil, they sauntered towards the feast<br> That waited them upon the strip of grass<br> That through the golden glimmering sea did pass.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those old men, glad to have lived so long,<br> Sat listening through the twilight to the song,<br> And when the night grew and all things were still<br> Throughout the wide vale from green hill to hill<br> Unto a happy harvesting they drank<br> Till once more o&#146;er the hills the white moon sank.</p>

<p>AUGUST had not gone by, though now was stored<br> In the sweet-smelling granaries all the hoard<br> Of golden corn; the land had made her gain,<br> And winter should howl round her doors in vain.<br> But o&#146;er the same fields grey now and forlorn<br> The old men sat and heard the swineherd's horn,<br> Far off across the stubble, when the day<br> At end of harvest-tide was sad and grey;<br> And rain was in the wind's voice as it swept<br> Along the hedges where the lone quail crept,<br> Beneath the chattering of the restless pie.<br> The fruit-hung branches moved, and suddenly<br> The trembling apples smote the dewless grass,<br> And all the year to autumn-tide did pass.<br> E&#146;en such a day it was as young men love<br> When swiftly through the veins the blood Both move,<br> And they, whose eyes can see not death at all,<br> To thoughts of stirring deeds and pleasure fall,<br> Because it seems to them to tell of life<br> After the dreamy days devoid of strife,<br> When every day with sunshine is begun,<br> And cloudless skies receive the setting sun. <A NAME="page_616"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 616</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a day the older folk were fain<br> Of something new somewhat to dull the pain<br> Of sad, importunate old memories<br> That to their weary hearts must needs arise.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! what new things on that day could come<br> From hearts that now so long had been the home<br> Of such dull thoughts, nay, rather let them tell<br> Some tale that fits their ancient longings well.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolf was the speaker, who said, "Friends, behold<br> This is e&#146;en such a tale as those once told<br> Unto my greedy ears by Nicholas,<br> Before our quest for nothing came to pass."</p>
