### JUNE.

JUNE, O June, that we desired so,  
Wilt thou not make us happy on this day?  
Across the river thy soft breezes blow  
Sweet with the scent of beanfields far away,  
Above our heads rustle the aspens grey,  
Calm is the sky with harmless clouds beset,  
No thought of storm the morning vexes yet.

   See, we have left our hopes and fears behind  
To give our very hearts up unto thee;  
What better place than this then could we find  
By this sweet stream that knows not of the sea,  
That guesses not the city's misery,  
This little stream whose hamlets scarce have names,  
This far-off, lonely mother of the Thames?

   Here then, O June, thy kindness will we take;  
And if indeed but pensive men we seem,  
What should we do? thou wouldst not have us wake  
From out the arms of this rare happy dream,  
And wish to leave the murmur of the stream,  
The rustling boughs, the twitter of the birds,  
And all thy thousand peaceful happy words.

NOW in the early June they deemed it good  
That they should go unto a house that stood  
On their chief river, so upon a day  
With favouring wind and tide they took their way  
Up the fair stream; most lovely was the time  
Even amidst the days of that fair clime,  
And still the wanderers thought about their lives,  
And that desire that rippling water gives  
To youthful hearts to wander anywhere.  
   So midst sweet sights and sounds a house most fair  
They came to, set upon the river side  
Where kindly folk their coming did abide;  
There they took land, and in the lime-trees’ shade  
Beneath the trees they found the fair feast laid,  
And sat, well pleased; but when the water-hen  
Had got at last to think them harmless men,  
And they with rest, and pleasure, and old wine,  
Began to feel immortal and divine,  
An elder spoke, "O gentle friends, the day  
Amid such calm delight now slips away,  
And ye yourselves are grown so bright and glad  
I care not if I tell you something sad;  
Sad, though the life I tell you of passed by,  
Unstained by sordid strife or misery;  
Sad, because though a glorious end it tells  
Yet on the end of glorious life it dwells,  
And striving through all things to reach the best  
Upon no midway happiness will rest."
