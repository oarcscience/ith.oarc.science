### MARCH.

SLAYER of the winter, art thou here again?  
O welcome, thou that bring’st the summer nigh!  
The bitter wind makes not thy victory vain,  
Nor will we mock thee for thy faint blue sky.  
Welcome, O March! whose kindly days and dry  
Make April ready for the throstle's song,  
Thou first redresser of the winter's wrong!

   Yea, welcome March! and though I die ere June,  
Yet for the hope of life I give thee praise,  
Striving to swell the burden of the tune  
That even now I hear thy brown birds raise,  
Unmindful of the past or coming days;  
Who sing: 'O joy! a new year is begun:  
What happiness to look upon the sun!'

   Ah, what begetteth all this storm of bliss  
But Death himself, who crying solemnly,  
E’en from the heart of sweet Forgetfulness,  
Bids us 'Rejoice, lest pleasureless ye die.  
Within a little time must ye go by.  
Stretch forth your open hands, and while ye live  
Take all the gifts that Death and Life may give.' <span id="page_104">p.

BEHOLD once more within a quiet land  
The remnant of that once aspiring band,  
With all hopes fallen away, but such as light  
The sons of men to that unfailing night,  
That death they needs must look on face to face.  
   Time passed, and ever fell the days apace  
From off the new-strung chaplet of their life;  
Yet though the time with no bright deeds was rife,  
Though no fulfilled desire now made them glad,  
They were not quite unhappy, rest they had,  
And with their hope their fear had passed away;  
New things and strange they saw from day to day;  
Honoured they were, and had no lack of things  
For which men crouch before the feet of kings,  
And, stripped of honour, yet may fail to have.  
   Therefore their latter journey to the grave  
Was like those days of later autumn-tide,  
When he who in some town may chance to bide  
Opens the window for the balmy air,  
And seeing the golden hazy sky so fair,  
And from some city garden hearing still  
The wheeling rooks the air with music fill,  
Sweet hopeful music, thinketh, Is this spring,  
Surely the year can scarce be perishing?  
But then he leaves the clamour of the town,  
And sees the withered scanty leaves fall down, <span id="page_105">p.

The half-ploughed field, the flowerless garden-plot,  
The dark full stream by summer long forgot,  
The tangled hedges where, relaxed and dead,  
The twining plants their withered berries shed,  
And feels therewith the treachery of the sun,  
And knows the pleasant time is well-nigh done.  
   In such St. Luke's short summer lived these men,  
Nearing the goal of threescore years and ten;  
The elders of the town their comrades were,  
And they to them were waxen now as dear  
As ancient men to ancient men can be;  
Grave matters of belief and polity  
They spoke of oft, but not alone of these;  
For in their times of idleness and ease  
They told of poets’ vain imaginings,  
And memories vague of half-forgotten things,  
Not true or false, but sweet to think upon.

   For nigh the time when first that land they won,  
When new-born March made fresh the hopeful air,  
The wanderers sat within a chamber fair,  
Guests of that city's rulers, when the day  
Far from the sunny noon had fallen away;  
The sky grew dark, and on the window-pane  
They heard the beating of the sudden rain.  
Then, all being satisfied with plenteous feast,  
There spoke an ancient man, the land's chief priest,  
Who said, "Dear guests, the year begins to-day,  
And fain are we, before it pass away, <span id="page_106">p.
106</span>  
To hear some tales of that now altered world,  
Wherefrom our fathers in old time were hurled  
By the hard hands of fate and destiny.  
Nor would ye hear perchance unwillingly  
How we have dealt with stories of the land  
Wherein the tombs of our forefathers stand:  
Wherefore henceforth two solemn feasts shall be  
In every month, at which some history  
Shall crown our joyance; and this day, indeed,  
I have a story ready for our need,  
If ye will hear it, though perchance it is  
That many things therein are writ amiss,  
This part forgotten, that part grown too great,  
For these things, too, are in the hands of fate."  
   They cried aloud for joy to hear him speak,  
And as again the sinking sun did break  
Through the dark clouds and blazed adown the hall,  
His clear thin voice upon their ears did fall,  
Telling a tale of times long passed away,  
When men might cross a kingdom in a day,  
And kings remembered they should one day die,  
And all folk dwelt in great simplicity.
