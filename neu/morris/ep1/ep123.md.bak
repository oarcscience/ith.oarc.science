THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JASON,

A Poem in 17 Books.

Crown 8vo. cloth, price 7*s*. 6*d*.

"Morris's Jason is in the purest, simplest, most idiomatic English; full
of freshness, full of life, vivid in landscape, vivid in human action,
worth reading at the cost of many leisure hours even to a busy
man."—*The Times*.

"Not many living Englishmen have written so good a poem on such a scale.
Mr. Morris is a most skilful narrator, full of the sweet garrulity
proper to the olden time and those that love it."—*The Guardian*.

" Mr. Morris has displayed poetic qualities rare in themselves, and
especially rare in these days. We should have to go back for a quarter
of a century to find any labour of equal pretension that exhibits the
same amount of fortitude in the writer and the same intimate knowledge
of all that relates to his theme."—*The Athenæum*.

"*The Life and Death of Jason* is a fine poem, which never flags in
interest for a single line, and is full of music, life, and clear
vision. The 'freshness of the early world' has taken complete possession
of Mr. Morris as he wrote."—*The Spectator*.

"In all the noble roll of our poets there has been since Chaucer no
second teller of Tales, no second rhapsode comparable to the first, till
the advent of this one. Rarely but in the ballad and romance periods has
such poetry been written, so broad and sad and simple, so full of deep
and direct fire, certain of its aim, without finish, without
fault."—*Fortnightly Review*.

"Open this poem where the reader may, he will find in it broad and
simple pictures of the olden days. It is true art alone which can draw
pictures with this living simplicity, whether in bare outline or in full
blaze of colour; and this art Mr. Morris possesses in a high
degree."—*The Standard*.

"Musical, clear, and flowing, strangely imaginative and suggestive,
presenting pictures of almost incomparable beauty, it is a work of which
an epoch may be proud "—*Sunday Times*.
