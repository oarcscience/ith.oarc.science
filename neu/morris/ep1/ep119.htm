<p><FONT SIZE="-1">THE case of this Falcon was such, that whoso watched it without sleeping for seven days and seven nights, had his first wish granted him by a fay lady, that appeared to him thereon; and some wished one thing, and some another. But a certain King, who watched the Falcon daily, would wish for nought but the love of that fay; which wish being accomplished, was afterwards his ruin.</FONT></p>  
<p>ACROSS the sea a land there is,<br> Where, if fate will, may men have bliss,<br> For it is fair as any land:<br> There hath the reaper a full hand,<br> While in the orchard hangs aloft<br> The purple fig, a-growing soft;<br> And fair the trellised vine-bunches<br> Are swung across the high elm-trees;<br> And in the rivers great fish play,<br> While over them pass day by day<br> The laden barges to their place.<br> There maids are straight, and fair of face, <A NAME="page_553"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 553</FONT></A><br> And men are stout for husbandry,<br> And all is well as it can be<br> Upon this earth where all has end.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on them God is pleased to send<br> The gift of Death down from above,<br> That envy, hatred, and hot love,<br> Knowledge with hunger by his side,<br> And avarice and deadly pride,<br> There may have end like everything<br> Both to the shepherd and the king:<br> Lest this green earth become but hell<br> If folk thereon should ever dwell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full little most men think of this,<br> But half in woe and half in bliss<br> They pass their lives, and die at last<br> Unwilling, though their lot be cast<br> In wretched places of the earth,<br> Where men have little joy from birth<br> Until they die; in no such case<br> Were those who tilled this pleasant place.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There soothly men were loth to die,<br> Though sometimes in his misery<br> A man would say "Would I were dead!"<br> Alas! full little likelyhead<br> That he should live for ever there.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So folk within that country fair<br> Lived on unable to forget<br> The longed-for things they could not get,<br> And without need tormenting still <A NAME="page_554"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 554</FONT></A><br> Each other with some bitter ill;<br> Yea, and themselves too, growing grey<br> With dread of some long-lingering day,<br> That never came ere they were dead<br> With green sods growing on the head;<br> Nowise content with what they had,<br> But falling still from good to bad<br> While hard they sought the hopeless best;<br> And seldom happy or at rest<br> Until at last with lessening blood<br> One foot within the grave they stood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so it chanced that in this land<br> There did a certain castle stand,<br> Set all alone deep in the hills,<br> Amid the sound of falling rills<br> Within a valley of sweet grass,<br> To which there went one narrow pass<br> Through the dark hills, but seldom trod.<br> Rarely did horse-hoof press the sod<br> About the quiet weedy moat,<br> When unscared did the great fish float;<br> Because men dreaded there to see<br> The uncouth things of fa&euml;rie;<br> Nathless by some few fathers old<br> These tales about the place were told<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That neither squire nor seneschal<br> Or varlet came in bower or hall,<br> Yet all things were in order due, <A NAME="page_555"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 555</FONT></A><br> Hangings of gold and red and blue,<br> And tables with fair service set;<br> Cups that had paid the C&aelig;sar's debt<br> Could he have laid his hands on them;<br> Dorsars, with pearls in every hem,<br> And fair embroidered gold-wrought things,<br> Fit for a company of kings;<br> And in the chambers dainty beds,<br> With pillows dight for fair young heads;<br> And horses in the stables were,<br> And in the cellars wine full clear<br> And strong, and casks of ale and mead;<br> Yea, all things a great lord could need.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whom these things were ready there<br> None knew; but if one chanced to fare<br> Into that place at Easter-tide,<br> There would he find a falcon tied<br> Unto a pillar of the Hall;<br> And such a fate to him would fall,<br> That if unto the seventh night,<br> He watched the bird from dark to light,<br> And light to dark unceasingly,<br> On the last evening he should see<br> A lady beautiful past words;<br> Then, were he come of clowns or lords,<br> Son of a swineherd or a king,<br> There must she grant him anything<br> Perforce, that he might dare to ask,<br> And do his very hardest task. <A NAME="page_556"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 556</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if he slumbered, ne&#146;er again<br> The wretch would wake for he was slain<br> Helpless, by hands he could not see,<br> And his corpse mangled wretchedly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now said these elders&#151;Ere this tide<br> Full many folk this thing have tried,<br> But few have got much good thereby;<br> For first, a many came to die<br> By slumbering ere their watch was done;<br> Or else they saw that lovely one,<br> And mazed, they knew not what to say;<br> Or asked for some small thing that day<br> That easily they might have won,<br> Nor staked their lives and souls thereon;<br> Or asking, asked for some great thing<br> That was their bane; as to be king<br> One asked, and died the morrow morn<br> That he was crowned, of all forlorn.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet thither came a certain man,<br> Who from being poor great riches wan<br> Past telling, whose grandsons now are<br> Great lords thereby in peace and war.<br> And in their coat-of-arms they bear,<br> Upon a field of azure fair,<br> A castle and a falcon, set<br> Below a chief of golden fret.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in our day a certain knight<br> Prayed to be worsted in no fight, <A NAME="page_557"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 557</FONT></A><br> And so it happed to him: yet he<br> Died none the less most wretchedly,<br> And all his prowess was in vain,<br> For by a losel was he slain,<br> As on the highway side he slept<br> One summer night, of no man kept.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tales as these the fathers old<br> About that lonely castle told;<br> And in their day the king must try<br> Himself to prove that mystery,<br> Although, unless the fay could give<br> For ever on the earth to live,<br> Nought could he ask that he had not:<br> For boundless riches had he got,<br> Fair children, and a faithful wife;<br> And happily had passed his life,<br> And all fulfilled of victory,<br> Yet was he fain this thing to see.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So towards the mountains he set out<br> One noontide, with a gallant rout<br> Of knights and lords, and as the day<br> Began to fail came to the way<br> Where he must enter all alone,<br> Between the dreary walls of stone.<br> Thereon to that fair company<br> He bade farewell, who wistfully<br> Looked backward oft as home they rode.<br> But in the entry he abode <A NAME="page_558"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 558</FONT></A><br> Of that rough unknown narrowing pass,<br> Where twilight at the high noon was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then onward he began to ride:<br> Smooth rose the rocks on every side,<br> And seemed as they were cut by man;<br> Adown them ever water ran,<br> But they of living things were bare,<br> Yea, not a blade of grass grew there;<br> And underfoot rough was the way,<br> For scattered all about there lay<br> Great jagged pieces of black stone.<br> Throughout the pass the wind did moan,<br> With such wild noises, that the King<br> Could almost think he heard something<br> Spoken of men; as one might hear<br> The voices of folk standing near<br> One's chamber wall: yet saw he nought<br> Except those high walls strangely wrought,<br> And overhead the strip of sky.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, going onward painfully,<br> He met therein no evil thing,<br> But came about the sunsetting<br> Unto the opening of the pass,<br> And thence beheld a vale of grass<br> Bright with the yellow daffodil;<br> And all the vale the sun did fill<br> With his last glory. Midmost there<br> Rose up a stronghold, built four-square,<br> Upon a flowery grassy mound, <A NAME="page_559"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 559</FONT></A><br> That moat and high wall ran around.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereby he saw a walled pleasance,<br> With walks and sward fit for the dance<br> Of Arthur's court in its best time,<br> That seemed to feel some magic clime;<br> For though through all the vale outside<br> Things were as in the April-tide,<br> And daffodils and cowslips grew<br> And hidden the March violets blew,<br> Within the bounds of that sweet close<br> Was trellised the bewildering rose;<br> There was the lily over-sweet,<br> And starry pinks for garlands meet;<br> And apricots hung on the wall<br> And midst the flowers did peaches fall,<br> And nought had blemish there or spot,<br> For in that place decay was not.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent awhile the King abode<br> Beholding all, then on he rode<br> And to the castle-gate drew nigh,<br> Till fell the drawbridge silently,<br> And when across it he did ride<br> He found the great gates open wide,<br> And entered there, but as he passed<br> The gates were shut behind him fast,<br> But not before that he could see<br> The drawbridge rise up silently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then round he gazed oppressed with awe, <A NAME="page_560"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 560</FONT></A><br> And there no living thing he saw<br> Except the sparrows in the eaves,<br> As restless as light autumn leaves<br> Blown by the fitful rainy wind.<br> Thereon his final goal to find,<br> He lighted off his war-horse good<br> And let him wander as he would,<br> When he had eased him of his gear;<br> Then gathering heart against his fear.<br> Just at the silent end of day<br> Through the fair porch he took his way,<br> And found at last a goodly hall<br> With glorious hangings on the wall,<br> Inwrought with trees of every clime,<br> And stories of the ancient time,<br> But all of sorcery they were.<br> For o&#146;er the dais Venus fair,<br> Fluttered about by many a dove,<br> Made hopeless men for hopeless love,<br> Both sick and sorry; there they stood<br> Wrought wonderfully in various mood,<br> But wasted all by that hid fire<br> Of measureless o&#146;er-sweet desire,<br> And let the hurrying world go by<br> Forgetting all felicity.<br> But down the hall the tale was wrought<br> How Argo in old time was brought<br> To Colchis for the fleece of gold.<br> And on the other side was told <A NAME="page_561"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 561</FONT></A><br> How mariners for long years came<br> To Circe, winning grief and shame.<br> Until at last by hardihead<br> And craft, Ulysses won her bed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long upon these the King did look<br> And of them all good heed he took;<br> To see if they would tell him aught<br> About the matter that he sought,<br> But all were of the times long past;<br> So going all about, at last<br> When grown nigh weary of his search<br> A falcon on a silver perch,<br> Anigh the da&iuml;s did he see,<br> And wondered, because certainly<br> At his first coming &#146;twas not there;<br> But &#146;neath the bird a scroll most fair,<br> With golden letters on the white<br> He saw, and in the dim twilight<br> By diligence could he read this:&#151;</p>  
<p><DIR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Ye who have not enow of bliss,<br> And in this hard world labour sore,<br> By manhood here may get you more,<br> And be fulfilled of everything,<br> Till ye be masters of the King.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, since I who promise this<br> Am nowise God lo give man bliss<br> Past ending, now in time beware,<br> And if you live in little care</i> <A NAME="page_562"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 562</FONT></A><br> <i>At this time get you back again,<br> Lest unknown woe you chance to gain<br> In wishing for a thing untried</i>."</DIR></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while did he abide,<br> When he had read this, deep in thought,<br> Wondering indeed if there were aught<br> He had not got, that a wise man<br> Would wish; yet in his mind it ran<br> That he might win a boundless realm,<br> Yea, come to wear upon his helm<br> The crown of the whole conquered earth;<br> That all who lived thereon, from birth<br> To death should call him King and Lord,<br> And great kings tremble at his word,<br> Until in turn he came to die.<br> Therewith a little did he sigh,<br> But thought, "Of Alexander yet<br> Men talk, nor would they e&#146;er forget<br> My name, if this should come to be,<br> Whoever should come after me:<br> But while I lay wrapped round with gold<br> Should tales and histories manifold<br> Be written of me, false and true;<br> And as the time still onward drew<br> Almost a god would folk count me,<br> Saying, 'In our time none such be.'<br> But therewith did he sigh again,<br> And said, "Ah, vain, and worse than vain! <A NAME="page_563"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 563</FONT></A><br> For though the world forget me nought,<br> Yet by that time should I be brought<br> Where all the world I should forget,<br> And bitterly should I regret<br> That I, from godlike great renown,<br> To helpless death must fall adown:<br> How could I bear to leave it all?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then straight upon his mind did fall<br> Thoughts of old longings half forgot,<br> Matters for which his heart was hot<br> A while ago: whereof no more<br> He cared for some, and some right sore<br> Had vexed him, being fulfilled at last.<br> And when the thought of these had passed<br> Still something was there left behind,<br> That by no torturing of his mind,<br> Could he in any language name,<br> Or into form of wishing frame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he thought, "What matters it,<br> Before these seven days shall flit<br> Some great thing surely shall I find,<br> That gained will not leave grief behind,<br> Nor turn to deadly injury.<br> So now will I let these things be<br> And think of some unknown delight."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, therewithal, was come the night,<br> And thus his watch was well begun; <A NAME="page_564"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 564</FONT></A><br> And till the rising of the sun,<br> Waking, he paced about the hall,<br> And saw the hangings on the wall<br> Fade into nought, and then grow white<br> In patches by the pale moonlight,<br> And then again fade utterly<br> As still the moonbeams passed them by;<br> Then in a while, with hope of day,<br> Begin a little to grow grey,<br> Until familiar things they grew,<br> As up at last the great sun drew,<br> And lit them with his yellow light<br> At ending of another night.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then right glad was he of the day,<br> That passed with him in such like way;<br> For neither man nor beast came near,<br> Nor any voices did he hear.<br> And when again it drew to night<br> Silent it passed, till first twilight<br> Of morning came, and then he heard<br> The feeble twittering of some bird,<br> That, in that utter silence drear,<br> Smote harsh and startling on his ear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith came on that lonely day<br> That passed him in no other way;<br> And thus six days and nights went by<br> And nothing strange had come anigh.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on that day he well-nigh deemed<br> That all that story had been dreamed. <A NAME="page_565"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 565</FONT></A><br> Daylight and dark, and night and day,<br> Passed ever in their wonted way;<br> The wind played in the trees outside,<br> The rooks from out the high trees cried;<br> And all seemed natural and fair,<br> With little signs of magic there.<br> Yet neither could he quite forget<br> That close with summer blossoms set,<br> And fruit hung on trees blossoming,<br> When all about was early spring.<br> Yea, if all this by man were made,<br> Strange was it that still undecayed<br> The food lay on the tables still<br> Unchanged by man, that wine did fill<br> The golden cups, still bright and red.<br> And all was so apparelled<br> For guests that came not, yet was all<br> As though that servants filled the hall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So waxed and waned his hopes, and still<br> He formed no wish for good or ill.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while he thought of this and that<br> Upon his perch the falcon sat<br> Unfed, unhooded, his bright eyes<br> Beholders of the hard-earned prize,<br> Glancing around him restlessly,<br> As though he knew the time drew nigh<br> When this long watching should be done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So little by little fell the sun, <A NAME="page_566"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 566</FONT></A><br> From high noon unto sun-setting;<br> And in that lapse of time the King,<br> Though still he woke, yet none the less<br> Was dreaming in his sleeplessness<br> Of this and that which he had done<br> Before this watch he had begun;<br> Till, with a start, he looked at last<br> About him, and all dreams were past;<br> For now, though it was past twilight<br> Without, within all grew as bright<br> As when the noon-sun smote the wall,<br> Though no lamp shone within the hall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose the King upon his feet,<br> And well-nigh heard his own heart beat,<br> And grew all pale for hope and fear,<br> As sound of footsteps caught his ear<br> But soft, and as some fair lady,<br> Going as gently as might be,<br> Stopped now and then awhile, distraught<br> By pleasant wanderings of sweet thought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigher the sound came, and more nigh,<br> Until the King unwittingly<br> Trembled, and felt his hair arise,<br> But on the door still kept his eyes.<br> That opened soon, and in the light<br> There stepped alone a lady bright,<br> And made straight toward him up the hall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In golden garments was she clad<br> And round her waist a belt she had <A NAME="page_567"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 567</FONT></A><br> Of emeralds fair, and from her feet<br> She held the raiment daintily,<br> And on her golden head had she<br> A rose-wreath round a pearl-wrought crown,<br> Softly she walked with eyes cast down,<br> Nor looked she any other than<br> An earthly lady, though no man<br> Has seen so fair a thing as she.,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when her face the King could see<br> Still more he trembled, and he thought<br> "Surely my wish is hither brought,<br> And this will be a goodly day<br> If for mine own I win this may."<br> And therewithal she drew anear<br> Until the trembling King could hear<br> Her very breathing, and she raised<br> Her head and on the King's face gazed<br> With serious eyes, and stopping there,<br> Swept from her shoulders her long hair,<br> And let her gown fall on her feet,<br> Then spoke in a clear voice and sweet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well hast thou watched, so now O King,<br> Be bold, and wish for some good thing;<br> And yet, I counsel thee, be wise.<br> Behold, spite of these lips and eyes,<br> Hundreds of years old now am I<br> And have seen joy and misery.<br> And thou, who yet hast lived in bliss, <A NAME="page_568"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 568</FONT></A><br> I bid thee well consider this;<br> Better it were that men should live<br> As beasts, and take what earth can give,<br> The air, the warm sun and the grass<br> Until unto the earth they pass,<br> And gain perchance nought worse than rest,<br> Than that not knowing what is best<br> For sons of men, they needs must thirst<br> For what shall make their lives accurst.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore I bid thee now beware,<br> Lest getting something seeming fair,<br> Thou com&#146;st in vain to long for more;<br> Or lest the thing thou wishest for<br> Make thee unhappy till thou diest,<br> Or lest with speedy death thou buyest<br> A little hour of happiness<br> Or lazy joy with sharp distress.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, why say I this to thee,<br> For now I see full certainly,<br> That thou wilt ask for such a thing,<br> It had been best for thee to fling<br> Thy body from a mountain top,<br> Or in a white hot fire to drop,<br> Or ever thou hadst seen me here,<br> Nay then be speedy and speak clear."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the king cried out eagerly,<br> Grown fearless, "Ah, be kind to me!<br> Thou knowest what I long for then!<br> Thou know&#146;st that I, a king of men, <A NAME="page_569"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 569</FONT></A><br> Will ask for nothing else than thee!<br> Thou didst not say this could not be,<br> And I have had enow of bliss,<br> If I may end my life with this."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken," she said, "what men will say<br> When they are mad; before to-day<br> I knew that words such things could mean,<br> And wondered that it could have been.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think well, because this wished-for joy,<br> That surely will thy bliss destroy,<br> Will let thee live, until thy life<br> Is wrapped in such bewildering strife<br> That all thy days will seem but ill&#151;<br> Now wilt thou wish for this thing still?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilt thou then grant it?" cried the King;<br> "Surely thou art an earthly thing,<br> And all this is but mockery,<br> And thou canst tell no more than I<br> What ending to my life shall be."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, then," she said, "I grant it thee<br> Perforce; come nigh, for I am thine<br> Until the morning sun doth shine,<br> And only coming time can prove<br> What thing I am."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dizzy with love,<br> And with surprise struck motionless<br> That this divine thing, with far less<br> Of striving than a village maid,<br> Had yielded, there he stood afraid, <A NAME="page_570"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 570</FONT></A><br> Spite of hot words and passionate,<br> And strove to think upon his fate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he stood there, presently<br> With smiling face she drew anigh,<br> And on his face he felt her breath.<br> "O love," she said, "dost thou fear death?<br> Not till next morning shalt thou die,<br> Or fall into thy misery."<br> Then on his hand her hand did fall,<br> And forth she led him down the hall,<br> Going full softly by his side.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O love," she said, "now well betide<br> The day whereon thou cam&#146;st to me.<br> I would this night a year might be,<br> Yea, life-long; such life as we have,<br> A thousand years from womb to grave."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then that clinging hand seemed worth<br> Whatever joy was left on earth,<br> And every trouble he forgot,<br> And time and death remembered not:<br> Kinder she grew, she clung to him<br> With loving arms, her eyes did swim<br> With love and pity, as he strove<br> To show the wisdom of his love;<br> With trembling lips she praised his choice,<br> And said, "Ah, well may&#146;st thou rejoice, <A NAME="page_571"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 571</FONT></A><br> Well may&#146;st thou think this one short night<br> Worth years of other men's delight,<br> If thy own heart as my heart is,<br> Sunk in a boundless sea of bliss;<br> O love, rejoice with me! rejoice!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as she spoke, her honied voice<br> Trembled, and midst of sobs she said,<br> "O love, and art thou still afraid?<br> Return, then, to thine happiness,<br> Nor will I love thee any less;<br> But watch thee as a mother might<br> Her child at play."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With strange delight<br> He stammered out, "Nay, keep thy tears<br> For me, and for my ruined years<br> Weep love, that I may love thee more,<br> My little hour will soon be o&#146;er."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, love," she said, "and thou art wise<br> As men are, with long miseries<br> Buying these idle words and vain,<br> My foolish love, with lasting pain;<br> And yet, thou wouldst have died at last<br> If in all wisdom thou hadst passed<br> Thy weary life: forgive me then,<br> In pitying the sad life of men."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in such bliss his soul did swim,<br> But tender music unto him<br> Her words were; death and misery<br> But empty names were grown to be, <A NAME="page_572"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 572</FONT></A><br> As from that place his steps she drew,<br> And dark the hall behind them grew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT end comes to all earthly bliss,<br> And by his choice full short was his;<br> And in the morning, grey and cold,<br> Beside the dais did she hold<br> His trembling hand, and wistfully<br> He, doubting what his fate should be,<br> Gazed at her solemn eyes, that now,<br> Beneath her calm, untroubled brow,<br> Were fixed on his wild face and wan;<br> At last she said, "Oh, hapless man,<br> Depart! your full wish you have had;<br> A little time you have been glad,<br> You shall be sorry till you die.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And though, indeed, full fain am I<br> This might not be; nathless, as day<br> Night follows, colourless and grey,<br> So this shall follow your delight,<br> Your joy hath ending with last night&#151;<br> Nay, peace, and hearken to your fate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strife without peace, early and late,<br> Lasting long after you are dead,<br> And laid with earth upon your head;<br> War without victory shall you have <A NAME="page_573"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 573</FONT></A><br> Defeat, nor honour shall you save;<br> Your fair land shall be rent and torn,<br> Your people be of all forlorn,<br> And all men curse you for this thing."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She loosed his hand, but yet the King<br> Said, "Yea, and I may go with thee?<br> Why should we part? then let things be<br> E&#146;en as they will!" "Poor man," she said,<br> "Thou ravest; our hot love is dead,<br> If ever it had any life:<br> Go, make thee ready for the strife<br> Wherein thy life shall soon be wrapped;<br> And of the things that here have happed<br> Make thou such joy as thou may&#146;st do;<br> But I from this place needs must go,<br> Nor shalt thou ever see me more<br> Until thy troubled life is o&#146;er:<br> Alas! to say 'farewell' to thee<br> Were nought but bitter mockery.<br> Fare as thou may&#146;st, and with good heart<br> Play to the end thy wretched part."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she turned and went from him,<br> And with such pain his eyes did swim<br> He scarce could see her leave the place.<br> And then, with troubled and pale face,<br> He gat him thence: and soon he found<br> His good horse in the base-court bound;<br> So, loosing him, forth did he ride, <A NAME="page_574"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 574</FONT></A><br> For the great gates were open wide,<br> And flat the heavy draw-bridge lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by the middle of the day,<br> That murky pass had he gone through,<br> And come to country that he knew;<br> And homeward turned his horse's head,<br> And passing village and homestead<br> Nigh to his palace came at last;<br> And still the further that he passed<br> From that strange castle of the fays,<br> More dreamlike seemed those seven days,<br> And dreamlike the delicious night;<br> And like a dream the shoulders white,<br> And clinging arms and yellow hair,<br> And dreamlike the sad morning there.<br> Until at last he &#146;gan to deem<br> That all might well have been a dream&#151;<br> Yet why was life a weariness?<br> What meant this sting of sharp distress?<br> This longing for a hopeless love,<br> No sighing from his heart could move?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else, 'she did not come and go<br> As fays might do, but soft and slow<br> Her lovely feet fell on the floor;<br> She set her fair hand to the door<br> As any dainty maid might do;<br> And though, indeed, there are but few <A NAME="page_575"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 575</FONT></A><br> Beneath the sun as fair as she,<br> She seemed a fleshly thing to be.<br> Perchance a merry mock this is,<br> And I may some day have the bliss<br> To see her lovely face again,<br> As smiling she makes all things plain.<br> And then as I am still a king,<br> With me may she make tarrying<br> Full long, yea, till I come to die.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith at last being come anigh<br> Unto his very palace gate,<br> He saw his knights and squires wait<br> His coming, therefore on the ground<br> He lighted, and they flocked around<br> Till he should tell them of his fare.<br> Then mocking said he, "Ye may dare,<br> The worst man of you all, to go<br> And watch as I was bold to do;<br> For nought I heard except the wind;<br> And nought I saw to call to mind."<br> So said he, but they noted well<br> That something more he had to tell<br> If it had pleased him; one old man,<br> Beholding his changed face and wan,<br> Muttered, "Would God it might be so!<br> Alas! I fear what fate may do;<br> Too much good fortune hast thou had<br> By anything to be more glad<br> Than thou hast been, I fear thee then <A NAME="page_576"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 576</FONT></A><br> Lest thou becom&#146;st a curse to men."<br> But to his place the doomed King passed,<br> And all remembrance strove to cast<br> From out his mind of that past day,<br> And spent his life in sport and play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>GREAT among other kings, I said<br> He was before he first was led<br> Unto that castle of the fays,<br> But soon he lost his happy days<br> And all his goodly life was done.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first indeed his best-loved son,<br> The very apple of his eye,<br> Waged war against him bitterly;<br> And when this son was overcome<br> And taken, and folk led him home,<br> And him the King had gone to meet,<br> Meaning with gentle words and sweet<br> To win him to his love again,<br> By his own hand he found him slain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know not if the doomed King yet<br> Remembered the fay lady's threat,<br> But troubles upon troubles came:<br> His daughter next was brought to shame,<br> Who unto all eyes seemed to be<br> The image of all purity, <A NAME="page_577"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 577</FONT></A><br> And fleeing from the royal place<br> The King no more beheld her face.<br> Then next a folk that came from far<br> Sent to the King great threats of war,<br> But he, full-fed of victory,<br> Deemed this a little thing to be,<br> And thought the troubles of his home<br> Thereby he well might overcome<br> Amid the hurry of the fight.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His foemen seemed of little might,<br> Although they thronged like summer bees<br> About the outlying villages,<br> And on the land great ruin brought.<br> Well, he this barbarous people sought<br> With such an army as seemed meet<br> To put the world beneath his feet;<br> The day of battle came, and he,<br> Flushed with the hope of victory,<br> Grew happy, as he had not been<br> Since he those glorious eyes had seen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met,&#151;his solid ranks of steel<br> There scarcely more the darts could feel<br> Of those new foemen, than if they<br> Had been a hundred miles away:&#151;<br> They met,&#151;a storied folk were his<br> To whom sharp war had long been bliss,<br> A thousand years of memories<br> Were flashing in their shielded eyes;<br> And grave philosophers they had <A NAME="page_578"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 578</FONT></A><br> To bid them ever to be glad<br> To meet their death and get life done<br> Midst glorious deeds from sire to son.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those they met were beasts, or worse,<br> To whom life seemed a jest, a curse;<br> Of fame and name they had not heard;<br> Honour to them was but a word,<br> A word spoke in another tongue;<br> No memories round their banners clung,<br> No walls they knew, no art of war,<br> By hunger were they driven afar<br> Unto the place whereon they stood,<br> Hungry for bestial joys and blood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder if these barbarous men<br> Were slain by hundreds to each ten<br> Of the King's brave well-armoured folk,<br> No wonder if their charges broke<br> To nothing, on the walls of steel,<br> And back the baffled hordes must reel.<br> So stood throughout a summer day<br> Scarce touched the King's most fair array,<br> Yet as it drew to even-tide<br> The foe still surged on every side,<br> As hopeless hunger-bitten men,<br> About his folk grown wearied then.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith the King beheld that crowd<br> Howling and dusk, and cried aloud,<br> "What do ye, soldiers? and how long <A NAME="page_579"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 579</FONT></A><br> Shall weak folk hold in check the strong.<br> Nay, forward banners! end the day<br> And show these folk how brave men play."<br> The young knights shouted at his word,<br> But the old folk in terror heard<br> The shouting run adown the line,<br> And saw men flush as if with wine&#151;<br> "O Sire" they said "the day is sure,<br> Nor will these folk the night endure<br> Beset with misery and fears."<br> Alas! they spoke to heedless ears;<br> For scarce one look on them he cast<br> But forward through the ranks he passed,<br> And cried out, "Who will follow me<br> To win a fruitful victory?"<br> And toward the foe in haste he spurred,<br> And at his back their shouts he heard,<br> Such shouts as he ne&#146;er heard again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They met&#151;ere moonrise all the plain<br> Was filled by men in hurrying flight<br> The relics of that shameful fight;<br> The close array, the full-armed men,<br> The ancient fame availed not then,<br> The dark night only was a friend<br> To bring that slaughter to an end;<br> And surely there the King had died,<br> But driven by that back-rushing tide<br> Against his will he needs must flee; <A NAME="page_580"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 580</FONT></A><br> And as he pondered bitterly<br> On all that wreck that he had wrought,<br> From time to time indeed he thought<br> Of the fay woman's dreadful threat.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But everything was not lost yet;"<br> Next day he said, great was the rout<br> And shameful beyond any doubt,<br> But since indeed at eventide<br> The rout began, not many died,<br> And gathering all the stragglers now<br> His troops still made a gallant show&#151;<br> Alas! it was a show indeed;<br> Himself desponding, did he lead<br> His beaten men against the foe,<br> Thinking at least to lie alow<br> Before the final rout should be;<br> But scarce upon the enemy<br> Could these, whose shaken banners shook<br> The frightened world, now dare to look;<br> Nor yet could the doomed King die there<br> A death he once had held most fair;<br> Amid unwounded men he came<br> Back to his city, bent with shame,<br> Unkingly, midst his great distress,<br> Yea, weeping at the bitterness<br> Of women's curses that did greet<br> His passage down the troubled street.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sight of all the things they loved, <A NAME="page_581"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 581</FONT></A><br> The memory of their manhood moved<br> Within the troops, and aged men<br> And boys must think of battle then,<br> And men that had not seen the foe<br> Must clamour to the war to go.<br> So a great army poured once more<br> From out the city, and before<br> The very gates they fought again,.<br> But their late valour was in vain;<br> They died indeed, and that was good,<br> But nought they gained for all the blood<br> Poured out like water; for the foe,<br> Men might have stayed a while ago,<br> A match for very gods were grown,<br> So like the field in June-tide mown<br> The king's men fell, and but in vain<br> The remnant strove the town to gain;<br> Whose battlements were nought to stay<br> An untaught foe upon that day,<br> Though many a tale the annals told<br> Of sieges in the days of old,<br> When all the world then knew of war<br> From that fair place was driven afar.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the King, a charmed life<br> He seemed to bear; from out that strife<br> He came unhurt, and he could see,<br> As down the valley he did flee<br> With his most wretched company, <A NAME="page_582"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 582</FONT></A><br> His palace flaming to the sky.<br> Then in the very midst of woe<br> His yearning thoughts would backward go<br> Unto the castle of the fay;<br> He muttered, "Shall I curse that day,<br> The last delight that I have had,<br> For certainly I then was glad?<br> And who knows if what men call bliss<br> Had been much better now than this<br> When I am hastening to the end."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fearful rest, that dreaded friend,<br> That Death, he did not gain as yet;<br> A band of men he soon did get,<br> A ruined rout of bad and good,<br> With whom within the tangled wood,<br> The rugged mountain, he abode,<br> And thenceforth oftentimes they rode<br> Into the fair land once called his,<br> And yet but little came of this,<br> Except some added misery<br> Unto that miserable realm:<br> The barbarous foe did overwhelm<br> The cities and the fertile plain,<br> And many a peaceful man was slain,<br> And many a maiden brought to shame,<br> And yielded towns were set aflame;<br> For all the land was masterless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long dwelt the King in great distress <A NAME="page_583"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 583</FONT></A><br> From wood to mountain ever tost,<br> Mourning for all that he had lost,<br> Until it chanced upon a day,<br> Asleep in early morn he lay,<br> And in a vision there did see<br> Clad all in black, that fay lady<br> Whereby all this had come to pass,<br> But dim as in a misty glass:<br> She said "I come thy death to tell<br> Yet now to thee may say 'farewell,'<br> For in a short space wilt thou be<br> Within an endless dim country<br> Where thou mayest well win woe or bliss."<br> Therewith she stooped his lips to kiss<br> And vanished straightway from his sight,<br> So waking there he sat upright<br> And looked around, but nought could see<br> And heard but song-birds&#146; melody,<br> For it was the first hour of day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with a sigh adown he lay<br> And slept, nor ever woke again,<br> For that same hour was he slain<br> By stealthy traitors as he slept.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He of a few was much bewept,<br> But of most men was well forgot<br> While that town's ashes still were hot<br> The foeman on that day did burn. <A NAME="page_584"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 584</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the land, great Time did turn<br> The bloody fields to deep green grass,<br> And from the minds of men did pass<br> The memory of that time of woe,<br> And at this day all things are so<br> As first I said; a land it is<br> Where men may dwell in rest and bliss<br> If so they will&#151;Who yet will not,<br> Because their hasty hearts are hot<br> With foolish hate, and longing vain<br> The sire and dam of grief and pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_585"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 585</FONT></A></p>  
<p>NEATH the bright sky cool grew the weary earth,<br> And many a bud in that fair hour had birth<br> Upon the garden bushes; in the west<br> The sky got ready for the great sun's rest,<br> And all was fresh and lovely; none the less<br> Although those old men shared the happiness<br> Of the bright eve, &#146;twas mixed with memories<br> Of how they might in old times have been wise,<br> Not casting by for very wilfulness<br> What wealth might come their changing life to bless;<br> Lulling their hearts to sleep, amid the cold<br> Of bitter times, that so they might behold<br> Some joy at last, e&#146;en if it lingered long.<br> That, wearing not their souls with grief and wrong,<br> They still might watch the changing world go by,<br> Content to live, content at last to die.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! if they had reached content at last,<br> It was perforce when all their strength was past;<br> And after loss of many days once bright,<br> With foolish hopes of unattained delight.</p>
