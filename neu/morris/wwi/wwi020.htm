<p align="center">CHAPTER XIX. THEY BID FAREWELL, BIRDALONE AND THE WOOD-MOTHER</p>  
<p>Now April was gone, and May was come with the thorn a-blossoming, and there was Birdalone waxing still in loveliness.&nbsp; And now the witch had left all girding at her even, and spake to her but little, save when she needs must.&nbsp; But to Birdalone it seemed that she watched her exceeding closely.</p>  
<p>Birdalone went oft to the wood, and learned yet more of lore:&nbsp; but of the matter of the Departure, how it was to be gone about they spake no more, and great was the love betwixt them.</p>  
<p>At last when May was worn nigh to June came Birdalone to the Oak of Tryst, and found the wood-mother there; and when they had talked a while, but ever from the teeth out, spake Habundia:&nbsp; Though thou be now the wiser of us two maybe, yet have I wisdom to wot that this is the hour of our sundering, and that to-morrow thou wilt try the adventure of the Sending Boat:&nbsp; is it not so?&nbsp; Yea, mother, said Birdalone; I bid thee farewell now:&nbsp; woe is me therefor!&nbsp; Said Habundia:&nbsp; And thou wilt deliver thyself into the hands of the witch, wilt thou, as thou saidst that other day?&nbsp; Quoth Birdalone:&nbsp; Is it not wisdom, dear mother, if I trust in my goodhap?&nbsp; Alas, said the mother, it may be so when all is said.&nbsp; But O my sad heart! and how I fear for thee!</p>  
<p>My mother, my mother! said Birdalone, that I should make the days grievous unto thee! and thou who hast made my days so joyous!&nbsp; But now canst thou not say of thy wisdom that we shall meet again?</p>  
<p>The wood-woman sat down, and let her head fall over her knees, and was silent a long while; then she rose up and stood before Birdalone, and said:&nbsp; Yea, we shall meet again, howsoever it may be.&nbsp; Let us depart with that sweet word in the air between us.&nbsp; Yet first thou shalt give me a tress of thine hair, as I did to thee when first we met; for by means of it may I know to-morrow how thou hast sped.</p>  
<p>Even so did Birdalone, and this was the end of their talk, save broken words of lamentation as they said farewell.&nbsp; And therewith for that while they sundered.</p>
