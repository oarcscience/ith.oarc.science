This fantasy novel by William Morris is one of the first to have a
central female character. The heroine, Birdalone, abducted and raised by
a witch in the wood of Evilshaw, escapes her captivity with the
assistance of a good witch. Habundia. Birdalone encounters three maidens
held prisoner by another witch, and the quest to unite the maidens with
their knightly lovers rounds out the tale.
