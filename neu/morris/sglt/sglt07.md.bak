CHAPTER VI: OF A DWELLING OF MAN ON THE ISLE OF RANSOM

When he awoke again the sun shone on him, and the morning was calm and
windless.  He sat up and looked about him, but could see no signs of Fox
save the lair wherein he had lain.  So he arose to his feet and sought
for him about the crannies of the rocks, and found him not; and he
shouted for him, and had no answer.  Then he said, "Belike he has gone
down to the boat to put a thing in, or take a thing out."  So he went
his ways to the stair down into the water-cave, and he called on Fox
from the top of the stair, and had no answer.

So he went down that long stair with a misgiving in his heart, and when
he came to the last step there was neither man nor boat, nor aught else
save the water and the living rock.  Then was he exceeding wroth, for he
knew that he had been beguiled, and he was in an evil case, left alone
on an Isle that he knew not, a waste and desolate land, where it seemed
most like he should die of famine.

He wasted no breath or might now in crying out for Fox, or seeking him;
for he said to himself:  "I might well have known that he was false and
a liar, whereas he could scarce refrain his joy at my folly and his
guile.  Now is it for me to strive for life against death."

Then he turned and went slowly up the stair, and came out on to the open
face of that Isle, and he saw that it was waste indeed, and dreadful:  a
wilderness of black sand and stones and ice-borne rocks, with here and
there a little grass growing in the hollows, and here and there a dreary
mire where the white-tufted rushes shook in the wind, and here and there
stretches of moss blended with red-blossomed sengreen; and otherwhere
nought but the wind-bitten creeping willow clinging to the black sand,
with a white bleached stick and a leaf or two, and again a stick and a
leaf.  In the offing looking landward were great mountains, some very
great and snow-capped, some bare to the tops; and all that was far away,
save the snow, was deep-blue in the sunny morning.  But about him on the
heath were scattered rocks like the reef beneath which he had slept the
last night, and peaks, and hammers, and knolls of uncouth shapes.

Then he went to the edge of the cliffs and looked down on the sea which
lay wrinkled and rippling on toward the shore far below him, and long he
gazed thereon and all about, but could see neither ship nor sail, nor
aught else save the washing of waves and the hovering of sea fowl.

Then he said:  "Were it not well if I were to seek that house-master of
whom Fox spake?  Might he not flit me at least to the Land of the
Glittering Plain?  Woe is me! now am I of that woful company, and I also
must needs cry out, Where is the land?  Where is the land?"

Therewith he turned toward the reef above their lair, but as he went he
thought and said:  "Nay, but was not this Stead a lie like the rest of
Fox's tale? and am I not alone in this sea-girt wilderness? Yea, and
even that image of my Beloved which I saw in the dream, perchance that
also was a mere beguiling; for now I see that the Puny Fox was in all
ways wiser than is meet and comely."  Yet again he said:  "At least I
will seek on, and find out whether there be another man dwelling on this
hapless Isle, and then the worst of it will be battle with him, and
death by point and edge rather than by hunger; or at the best we may
become friends and fellows and deliver each other."  Therewith he came
to the reef, and with much ado climbed to the topmost of its rocks and
looked down thence landward: and betwixt him and the mountains, and by
seeming not very far off, he saw smoke arising:  but no house he saw,
nor any other token of a dwelling.  So he came down from the stone and
turned his back upon the sea and went toward that smoke with his sword
in its sheath, and his spear over his shoulder.  Rough and toilsome was
the way:  three little dales he crossed amidst the mountain necks, each
one narrow and bare, with a stream of water amidst, running seaward, and
whether in dale or on ridge, he went ever amidst sand and stones, and
the weeds of the wilderness, and saw no man, or man-tended beast.

At last, after he had been four hours on the way, but had not gone very
far, he topped a stony bent, and from the brow thereof beheld a wide
valley grass-grown for the more part, with a river running through it,
and sheep and kine and horses feeding up and down it. And amidst this
dale by the stream-side, was a dwelling of men, a long hall and other
houses about it builded of stone.

Then was Hallblithe glad, and he strode down the bent speedily, his
war-gear clashing upon him:  and as he came to the foot thereof and on
to the grass of the dale, he got amongst the pasturing horses, and
passed close by the horse-herd and a woman that was with him.  They
scowled at him as he went by, but meddled not with him in any way.
Although they were giant-like of stature and fierce of face, they were
not ill-favoured:  they were red-haired, and the woman as white as cream
where the sun had not burned her skin; they had no weapons that
Hallblithe might see save the goad in the hand of the carle.

So Hallblithe passed on and came to the biggest house, the hall
aforesaid:  it was very long, and low as for its length, not over
shapely of fashion, a mere gabled heap of stones.  Low and strait was
the door thereinto, and as Hallblithe entered stooping lowly, and the
fire of the steel of his spear that he held before him was quenched in
the mirk of the hall, he smiled and said to himself:  "Now if there were
one anigh who would not have me enter alive, and he with a weapon in his
hand, soon were all the tale told."  But he got into the hall unsmitten,
and stood on the floor thereof, and spake:  "The sele of the day to
whomsoever is herein!  Will any man speak to the new comer?"

But none answered or gave him greeting; and as his eyes got used to the
dusk of the hall, he looked about him, and neither on the floor or the
high seat nor in any ingle could he see a man; and there was silence
there, save for the crackling of the flickering flame on the hearth
amidmost, and the running of the rats behind the panelling of the walls.

On one side of the hall was a row of shut-beds, and Hallblithe deemed
that there might be men therein; but since none had greeted him he
refrained him from searching them for fear of a trap, and he thought, "I
will abide amidst the floor, and if there be any that would deal with
me, friend or foe, let him come hither to me."

So he fell to walking up and down the hall from buttery to dais, and his
war-gear rattled upon him.  At last as he walked he thought he heard a
small thin peevish voice, which yet was too husky for the squeak of a
rat.  So he stayed his walk and stood still, and said: "Will any man
speak to Hallblithe, a newcomer, and a stranger in this Stead?"

Then that small voice made a word and said:  "Why paceth the fool up and
down our hall, doing nothing, even as the Ravens flap croaking about the
crags, abiding the war-mote and the clash of the fallow blades?"

Said Hallblithe, and his voice sounded big in the hall:  "Who calleth
Hallblithe a fool and mocketh at the sons of the Raven?"

Spake the voice:  "Why cometh not the fool to the man that may not go to
him?"

Then Hallblithe bent forward to hearken, and he deemed that the voice
came from one of the shut-beds, so he leaned his spear against a pillar,
and went into the shut-bed he had noted, and saw where there lay along
in it a man exceeding old by seeming, sore wasted, with long hair as
white as snow lying over the bed-clothes.

When the elder saw Hallblithe, he laughed a thin cracked laugh as if in
mockery and said:  "Hail newcomer! wilt thou eat?"

"Yea," said Hallblithe.

"Go thou into the buttery then," said the old carle, "and there shalt
thou find on the cupboard cakes and curds and cheese:  eat thy fill, and
when thou hast done, look in the ingle, and thou shalt see a cask of
mead exceeding good, and a stoup thereby, and two silver cups; fill the
stoup and bring it hither with the cups; and then may we talk amidst of
drinking, which is good for an old carle.  Hasten thou! or I shall deem
thee a double fool who will not fare to fetch his meat, though he be
hungry."

Then Hallblithe laughed, and went down the hall into the buttery and
found the meat, and ate his fill, and came away with the drink back to
the Long-hoary man, who chuckled as he came and said:  "Fill up now for
thee and for me, and call a health to me and wish me somewhat."

"I wish thee luck," said Hallblithe, and drank.  Said the elder: "And I
wish thee more wits; is luck all that thou mayst wish me? What luck may
an outworn elder have?"

"Well then," quoth Hallblithe, "what shall I wish thee?  Wouldst thou
have me wish thee youth?"

"Yea, certes," said the Long-hoary, "that and nought else."

"Youth then I wish thee, if it may avail thee aught," said Hallblithe,
and he drank again therewith.

"Nay, nay," said the old carle peevishly, "take a third cup, and wish me
youth with no idle words tacked thereto."

Said Hallblithe raising the cup:  "Herewith I wish thee youth!" and he
drank.

"Good is the wish," said the elder; "now ask thou the old carle whatso
thou wilt."

Said Hallblithe:  "What is this land called?"

"Son," said the other, "hast thou heard it called the Isle of Ransom?"

"Yea," said Hallblithe, "but what wilt thou call it?"

"By no other name," said the hoary carle.

"It is far from other lands?" said Hallblithe.

"Yea," said the carle, "when the light winds blow, and the ships sail
slow."

"What do ye who live here?" said Hallblithe.  "How do ye live, what work
win ye?"

"We win diverse work," said the elder, "but the gainfullest is robbing
men by the high hand."

"Is it ye who have stolen from me the Hostage of the Rose?" said
Hallblithe.

Said the Long-hoary, "Maybe; I wot not; in diverse ways my kinsmen
traffic, and they visit many lands.  Why should they not have come to
Cleveland also?"

"Is she in this Isle, thou old runagate?" said Hallblithe.

"She is not, thou young fool," said the elder.  Then Hallblithe flushed
red and spake:  "Knowest thou the Puny Fox?"

"How should I not?" said the carle, "since he is the son of one of my
sons."

"Dost thou call him a liar and a rogue?" said Hallblithe.

The elder laughed; "Else were I a fool," said he; "there are few bigger
liars or bigger rogues than the Puny Fox!"

"Is he here in this Isle?" said Hallblithe; "may I see him?"

The old man laughed again, and said:  "Nay, he is not here, unless he
hath turned fool since yesterday:  why should he abide thy sword, since
he hath done what he would and brought thee hither?"

Then he laughed, as a hen cackles a long while, and then said:  "What
more wilt thou ask me?"

But Hallblithe was very wroth:  "It availeth nought to ask," he said;
"and now I am in two minds whether I shall slay thee or not."

"That were a meet deed for a Raven, but not for a man," said the carle,
"and thou that hast wished me luck!  Ask, ask!"

But Hallblithe was silent a long while.  Then the carle said, "Another
cup for the longer after youth!"

Hallblithe filled, and gave to him, and the old man drank and said:
"Thou deemest us all liars in the Isle of Ransom because of thy
beguiling by the Puny Fox:  but therein thou errest.  The Puny Fox is
our chiefest liar, and doth for us the more part of such work as we
need:  therefore, why should we others lie.  Ask, ask!"

"Well then," said Hallblithe, "why did the Puny Fox bewray me, and at
whose bidding?"

Said the elder:  "I know, but I will not tell thee.  Is this a lie?"

"Nay, I deem it not," said Hallblithe:  "But, tell me, is it verily true
that my trothplight is not here, that I may ransom her?"

Said the Long-hoary:  "I swear it by the Treasure of the Sea, that she
is not here:  the tale was but a lie of the Puny Fox."
