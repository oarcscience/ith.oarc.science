CHAPTER XXXI. OF THE WEAPON-SHOW OF THE MEN OF BURGDALE AND THEIR
NEIGHBOURS

Now on the day appointed for the Weapon-show came the Folk flock-meal to
the great and wide meadow that was cleft by Wildlake as it ran to join
the Weltering Water.  Early in the morning, even before sunrise, had the
wains full of women and children begun to come thither.  Also there came
little horses and asses from the Shepherd country with one or two or
three damsels or children sitting on each, and by wain-side or by beast
strode the men of the house, merry and fair in their war-gear.  The
Woodlanders, moreover, man and woman, elder and swain and young damsel,
streamed out of the wood from Carlstead, eager to make the day begin
before the sunrise, and end before his setting.

Then all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of wains; for
the April sun was hot in the Dale, and when he arose the meads were gay
with more than the spring flowers; for the tents and the tilts were
stained and broidered with many colours, and there was none who had not
furbished up his war-gear so that all shone and glittered. And many wore
gay surcoats over their armour, and the women were clad in all their
bravery, and the Houses mostly of a suit; for one bore blue and another
corn-colour, and another green, and another brazil, and so forth, and
all gleaming and glowing with broidery of gold and bright hues.  But the
women of the Shepherds were all clad in white, embroidered with green
boughs and red blossoms, and the Woodland women wore dark red kirtles. 
Moreover, the women had set garlands of flowers on their heads and the
helms of the men, and for the most part they were slim of body and tall
and light-limbed, and as dainty to look upon as the willow-boughs that
waved on the brook-side.

Thither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought their
guests, even now much bettered by their new soft days; and much the poor
folk marvelled at all this joyance, and they scarce knew where they
were; but to some it brought back to their minds days of joyance before
the thralldom and all that they had lost, so that their hearts were
heavy a while, till they saw the warriors of the kindreds streaming into
the mead and bethought them why they carried steel.

Now by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on the
Portway, and this was the folk of the Burg on their way to the
Weapon-mead.  The men-at-arms were in the midst of the throng, and at
the head of them was the War-leader, with the banner of the Face before
him, wherein was done the image of the God with the ray-ringed head. 
But at the rearward of the warriors went the Alderman and the
Burg-wardens, before whom was borne the banner of the Burg pictured with
the Gate and its Towers; but in the midst betwixt those two was the
banner of the Steer, a white beast on a green field.

So when the Dale-wardens who were down in the meadow heard the music and
beheld who were coming, they bade the companies of the Dale and the
Shepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to pitch their banners
in a half circle about the ingle of the meadow which was made by the
streams of Wildlake and the Weltering Water, and gather to them to be
ordered there under their leaders of scores and half-hundreds and
hundreds; and even so they did.  But the banners of the Dale without the
Burg were the Bridge, and the Bull, and the Vine, and the Sickle.  And
the Shepherds had three banners, to wit Greenbury, and the Fleece, and
the Thorn.

As for the Woodlanders, they said that they were abiding their great
banner, but it should come in good time; 'and meantime,' said they,
'here are the war-tokens that we shall fight under; for they are good
enough banners for us poor men, the remnant of the valiant of time
past.'  Therewith they showed two great spears, and athwart the one was
tied an arrow, its point dipped in blood, its feathers singed with fire;
and they said, 'This is the banner of the War-shaft.'

On the other spear there was nought; but the head thereof was great and
long, and they had so burnished the steel that the sun smote out a ray
of light from it, so that it might be seen from afar.  And they said: 
'This is the Banner of the Spear!  Down yonder where the ravens are
gathering ye shall see a banner flying over us.  There shall fall many a
mother's son.'

Smiled the Dale-wardens, and said that these were good banners to fight
under; and those that stood nearby shouted for the valiancy of the
Woodland Carles.

Now the Dale-wardens went to the entrance from the Portway to the
meadow, and there met the Men of the Burg, and two of them went one on
either side of the War-leader to show him to his seat, and the others
abode till the Alderman and Burg-wardens came up, and then joined
themselves to them, and the horns blew up both in the meadow and on the
road, and the new-comers went their ways to their appointed places
amidst the shouts of the Dalesmen; and the women and children and old
men from the Burg followed after, till all the mead was covered with
bright raiment and glittering gear, save within the ring of men at the
further end.

So came the War-leader to his seat of green turf raised in the ingle
aforesaid; and he stood beside it till the Alderman and Wardens had
taken their places on a seat behind him raised higher than his; below
him on the step of his seat sat the Scrivener with his pen and ink-horn
and scroll of parchment, and men had brought him a smooth shield whereon
to write.

On the left side of Face-of-god stood the men of the Face all glittering
in their arms, and amongst them were Wolf-stone and his two fellows, but
Dallach was not yet whole of his hurts.  On his right were the folk of
the House of the Steer:  the leader of that House was an old
white-bearded man, grandfather of the Bride, for her father was dead;
and who but the Bride herself stood beside him in her glorious war-gear,
looking as if she were new come from the City of the Gods, thought most
men; but those who beheld her closely deemed that she looked heavy-eyed
and haggard, as if she were aweary. Nevertheless, wheresoever she
passed, and whosoever looked on her (and all men looked on her), there
arose a murmur of praise and love; and the women, and especially the
young ones, said how fair her deed was, and how meet she was for it; and
some of them were for doing on war-gear and faring to battle with the
carles; and of these some were sober and solemn, as was well seen
afterwards, and some spake lightly:  some also fell to boasting of how
they could run and climb and swim and shoot in the bow, and fell to
baring of their arms to show how strong they were:  and indeed they were
no weaklings, though their arms were fair.

There then stood the ring of men, each company under its banner; and
beyond them stood the women and children and men unmeet for battle; and
beyond them again the tilted wains and the tents.

Now Face-of-god sat him down on the turf-seat with his bright helm on
his head and his naked sword across his knees, while the horns blew up
loudly, and when they had done, the elder of the Dale-wardens cried out
for silence.  Then again arose Face-of-god and said:

'Men of the Dale, and ye friends of the Shepherds, and ye, O valiant
Woodlanders; we are not assembled here to take counsel, for in three
days' time shall the Great Folk-mote be holden, whereat shall be counsel
enough.  But since I have been appointed your Chief and War-leader, till
such time as the Folk-mote shall either yeasay or naysay my leadership,
I have sent for you that we may look each other in the face and number
our host and behold our weapons, and see if we be meet for battle and
for the dealing with a great host of foemen.  For now no longer can it
be said that we are going to war, but rather that war is on our borders,
and we are blended with it; as many have learned to their cost; for some
have been slain and some sorely hurt. Therefore I bid you now, all ye
that are weaponed, wend past us that the tale of you may be taken.  But
first let every hundred-leader and half-hundred-leader and score-leader
make sure that he hath his tale aright, and give his word to the captain
of his banner that he in turn may give it out to the Scrivener with his
name and the House and Company that he leadeth.'

So he spake and sat him adown; and the horns blew again in token that
the companies should go past; and the first that came was Hall-ward of
the House of the Steer, and the first of those that went after him was
the Bride, going as if she were his son.

So he cried out his name, and the name of his House, and said, 'An
hundred and a half,' and passed forth, his men following him in most
goodly array.  Each man was girt with a good sword and bore a long heavy
spear over his shoulder, save a score who bare bows; and no man lacked a
helm, a shield, and a coat of fence.

Then came a goodly man of thirty winters, and stayed before the
Scrivener and cried out:

'Write down the House of the Bridge of the Upper Dale at one hundred,
and War-well their leader.'

And he strode on, and his men followed clad and weaponed like those of
the Steer, save that some had axes hanging to their girdles instead of
swords; and most bore casting-spears instead of the long spears, and
half a score were bowmen.

Then came Fox of Upton leading the men of the Bull of Middale, an
hundred and a half lacking two; very great and tall were his men, and
they also bore long spears, and one score and two were bowmen.

Then Fork-beard of Lea, a man well on in years, led on the men of the
Vine, an hundred and a half and five men thereto; two score of them bare
bow in hand and were girt with sword; the rest bore their swords naked
in their right hands, and their shields (which were but small bucklers)
hanging at their backs, and in the left hand each bore two
casting-spears.  With these went two doughty women-at-arms among the
bowmen, tall and well-knit, already growing brown with the spring sun,
for their work lay among the stocks of the vines on the
southward-looking bents.

Next came a tall young man, yellow-haired, with a thin red beard, and
gave himself out for Red-beard of the Knolls; he bore his father's name,
as the custom of their house was, but the old man, who had long been
head man of the House of the Sickle, was late dead in his bed, and the
young man had not seen twenty winters.  He bade the Scrivener write the
tale of the Men of the Sickle at an hundred and a half, and his folk
fared past the War-leader joyously, being one half of them bowmen; and
fell shooters they were; the other half were girt with swords, and bore
withal long ashen staves armed with great blades curved inwards, which
weapon they called heft-sax.

All these bands, as the name and the tale of them was declared were
greeted with loud shouts from their fellows and the bystanders; but now
arose a greater shout still, as Stone-face, clad in goodly glittering
array, came forth and said:

'I am Stone-face of the House of the Face, and I bring with me two
hundreds of men with their best war-gear and weapons:  write it down,
Scrivener!'

And he strode on like a young man after those who had gone past, and
after him came the tall Hall-face and his men, a gallant sight to see: 
two score bowmen girt with swords, and the others with naked swords
waving aloft, and each bearing two casting-spears in his left hand.

Then came a man of middle age, broad-shouldered, yellow-haired,
blue-eyed, of wide and ruddy countenance, and after him a goodly
company; and again great was the shout that went up to the heavens; for
he said:

'Scrivener, write down that Hound-under-Greenbury, from amongst the
dwellers in the hills where the sheep feed, leadeth the men who go under
the banner of Greenbury, to the tale of an hundred and four score.'

Therewith he passed on, and his men followed, stout, stark, and
merry-faced, girt with swords, and bearing over their shoulders
long-staved axes, and spears not so long as those which the Dalesmen
bore; and they had but a half score of arrow-shot with them.

Next came a young man, blue-eyed also, with hair the colour of flax on
the distaff, broad-faced and short-nosed, low of stature, but very
strong-built, who cried out in a loud, cheerful voice:

'I am Strongitharm of the Shepherds, and these valiant men are of the
Fleece and the Thorn blended together, for so they would have it; and
their tale is one hundred and two score and ten.'

Then the men of those kindreds went past merry and shouting, and they
were clad and weaponed like to them of Greenbury, but had with them a
score of bowmen.  And all these Shepherd-folk wore over their hauberks
white woollen surcoats broidered with green and red.

Now again uprose the cry, and there stood before the War-leader a very
tall man of fifty winters, dark-faced and grey-eyed, and he spake slowly
and somewhat softly, and said:

'War-leader, this is Red-wolf of the Woodlanders leading the men who go
under the sign of the War-shaft, to the number of an hundred and two.'

Then he passed on, and his men after him, tall, lean, and silent amidst
the shouting.  All these men bare bows, for they were keen hunters; each
had at his girdle a little axe and a wood-knife, and some had long
swords withal.  They wore, everyone of the carles, short green surcoats
over their coats of fence; but amongst them were three women who bore
like weapons to the men, but were clad in red kirtles under their
hauberks, which were of good ring-mail gleaming over them from throat to
knee.

Last came another tall man, but young, of twenty-five winters, and
spake:

'Scrivener, I am Bears-bane of the Woodlanders, and these that come
after me wend under the sign of the Spear, and they are of the tale of
one hundred and seven.'

And he passed by at once, and his men followed him, clad and weaponed no
otherwise than they of the War-shaft, and with them were two women.

Now went all those companies back to their banners, and stood there; and
there arose among the bystanders much talk concerning the Weapon-show,
and who were the best arrayed of the Houses.  And of the old men, some
spake of past weapon-shows which they had seen in their youth, and they
set them beside this one, and praised and blamed.  So it went on a
little while till the horns blew again, and once more there was
silence.  Then arose Face-of-god and said:

'Men of Burgdale, and ye Shepherd-folk, and ye of the Woodland, now
shall ye wot how many weaponed men we may bring together for this war. 
Scrivener, arise and give forth the tale of the companies, as they have
been told unto you.'

Then the Scrivener stood up on the turf-bench beside Face-of-god, and
spake in a loud voice, reading from his scroll:

'Of the Men of Burgdale there have passed by me nine hundreds and six;
of the Shepherds three hundreds and eight and ten; and of the
Woodlanders two hundreds and nine; so that all told our men are fourteen
hundreds and thirty and three.'

Now in those days men reckoned by long hundreds, so that the whole tale
of the host was one thousand, five hundred, and four score and one,
telling the tale in short hundreds.

When the tale had been given forth and heard, men shouted again, and
they rejoiced that they were so many.  For it exceeded the reckoning
which the Alderman had given out at the Gate-thing.  But Face-of-god
said:

'Neighbours, we have held our Weapon-show; but now hold you ready, each
man, for the Hosting toward very battle; for belike within seven days
shall the leaders of hundreds and twenties summon you to be ready in
arms to take whatso fortune may befall.  Now is sundered the
Weapon-show.  Be ye as merry to-day as your hearts bid you to be.'

Therewith he came down from his seat with the Alderman and the Wardens,
and they mingled with the good folk of the Dale and the Shepherds and
the Woodlanders, and merry was their converse there. It yet lacked an
hour of noon; so presently they fell to and feasted in the green meadow,
drinking from wain to wain and from tent to tent; and thereafter they
played and sported in the meads, shooting at the butts and wrestling,
and trying other masteries.  Then they fell to dancing one and all, and
so at last to supper on the green grass in great merriment.  Nor might
you have known from the demeanour of any that any threat of evil
overhung the Dale.  Nay, so glad were they, and so friendly, that you
might rather have deemed that this was the land whereof tales tell,
wherein people die not, but live for ever, without growing any older
than when they first come thither, unless they be born into the land
itself, and then they grow into fair manhood, and so abide.  In sooth,
both the land and the folk were fair enough to be that land and the folk
thereof.

But a little after sunset they sundered, and some fared home; but many
of them abode in the tents and tilted wains, because the morrow was the
first day of the Spring Market:  and already were some of the Westland
chapmen come; yea, two of them were with the bystanders in the meadow;
and more were looked for ere the night was far spent.
