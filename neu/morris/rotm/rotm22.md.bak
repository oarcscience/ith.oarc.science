CHAPTER XXI. FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON THE DUSKY MEN

When he awoke again he saw a man standing over him, and knew him for
Wood-wise:  he was clad in his war-gear, and had his quiver at his back
and his bow in his hand, for Wood-father's children were all good
bowmen, though not so sure as Bow-may.  He spake to Face-of-god:

'Dawn is in the sky, Dalesman; there is yet time for thee to wash the
night off of thee in our bath of the Shivering Flood and to put thy
mouth to the milk-bowl; but time for nought else:  for I and Bow-may are
appointed thy fellows for the road, and it were well that we were back
home speedily.'

So Face-of-god leapt up and went forth from the Hall, and Wood-wise led
to where was a pool in the river with steps cut down to it in the rocky
bank.

'This,' said Wood-wise, 'is the Carle's Bath; but the Queen's is lower
down, where the water is wider and shallower below the little mid-dale
force.'

So Gold-mane stripped off his raiment and leapt into the ice-cold pool;
and they had brought his weapons and war-gear with them; so when he came
out he clad and armed himself for the road, and then turned with
Wood-wise toward the outgate of the Dale; and soon they saw two men
coming from lower down the water in such wise that they would presently
cross their path, and as yet it was little more than twilight, so that
they saw not at first who they were, but as they drew nearer they knew
them for the Sun-beam and Bow-may.  The Sun-beam was clad but in her
white linen smock and blue gown as he had first seen her, her hair was
wet and dripping with the river, her face fresh and rosy:  she carried
in her two hands a great bowl of milk, and stepped delicately, lest she
should spill it.  But Bow-may was clad in her war-gear with helm and
byrny, and a quiver at her back, and a bended bow in her hand.  So they
greeted each other kindly, and the Sun-beam gave the bowl to Face-of-god
and said:

'Drink, guest, for thou hast a long and thirsty road before thee.'

So Face-of-god drank, and gave her the bowl back again, and she smiled
on him and drank, and the others after her till the bowl was empty: 
then Bow-may put her hand on Wood-wise's shoulder, and they led on
toward the outgate, while those twain followed them hand in hand.  But
the Sun-beam said:

'This then is the new day I spoke of, and lo! it bringeth our sundering
with it; yet shall it be no longer than a day when all is said, and new
days shall follow after.  And now, my friend, I shall see thee no later
than the April market; for doubt not that I shall go thither with
Folk-might, whether he will or not.  Also as I led thee out of the house
when we last met, so shall I lead thee out of the Dale to-day, and I
will go with thee a little way on the waste; and therefore am I shod
this morning, as thou seest, for the ways on the waste are rough.  And
now I bid thee have courage while my hand holdeth thine.  For afterwards
I need not bid thee anything; for thou wilt have enough to do when thou
comest to thy Folk, and must needs think more of warriors then than of
maidens.'

He looked at her and longed for her, but said soberly:  'Thou art kind,
O friend, and thinkest kindly of me ever.  But methinks it were not well
done for thee to wend with me over a deal of the waste, and come back by
thyself alone, when ye have so many foemen nearby.'

'Nay,' she said, 'they be nought so near as that yet, and I wot that
Folk-might hath gone forth toward the north-west, where he looketh to
fall in with a company of the foemen.  His battle shall be a guard unto
us.'

'I pray thee turn back at the top of the outgate,' said he, 'and be not
venturesome.  Thou wottest that the pitcher is not broken the first time
it goeth to the well, nor maybe the twentieth, but at last it cometh not
back.'

She said:  'Nevertheless I shall have my will herein.  And it is but a
little way I will wend with thee.'

Therewith were they come to the scree, and talk fell down between them
as they clomb it; but when they were in the darksome passage of the
rocks, and could scarce see one another, Face-of-god said:

'Where then is another outgate from the Dale?  Is it not up the water?'

'Yea,' she said, 'and there is none other:  at the lower end the rocks
rise sheer from out the water, and a little further down is a great
force thundering betwixt them; so that by no boat or raft may ye come
out of the Dale.  But the outgate up the water is called the Road of
War, as this is named the Path of Peace.  But now are all ways ways of
war.'

'There is peace in my heart,' said Gold-mane.

She answered not for a while, but pressed his hand, and he felt her
breath on his cheek; and even therewithal they came out of the dark, and
Gold-mane saw that her cheek was flushed; and now she spake:

'One thing would I say to thee, my friend.  Thou hast seen me amongst
men of war, amongst outlaws who seek violence; thou hast heard me bid my
brother to count the slain, and I shrinking not; thou knowest (for I
have told thee) how I have schemed and schemed for victorious battle. 
Yet I would not have thee think of me as a Chooser of the Slain, a
warrior maiden, or as of one who hath no joy save in the battle whereto
she biddeth others.  O friend, the many peaceful hours that I have had
on the grass down yonder, sitting with my rock and spindle in hand, the
children round about my knees hearkening to some old story so well
remembered by me! or the milking of the kine in the dewy summer even,
when all was still but for the voice of the water and the cries of the
happy children, and there round about me were the dear and beauteous
maidens with whom I had grown up, happy amidst all our troubles, since
their life was free and they knew no guile. In such times my heart was
at peace indeed, and it seemed to me as if we had won all we needed; as
if war and turmoil were over, after they had brought about peace and
good days for our little folk.

'And as for the days that be, are they not as that rugged pass, full of
bitter winds and the voice of hurrying waters, that leadeth yonder to
Silver-dale, as thou hast divined? and there is nought good in it save
that the breath of life is therein, and that it leadeth to pleasant
places and the peace and plenty of the fair dale.'

'Sweet friend,' he said, 'what thou sayest is better than well:  for
time shall be, if we come alive out of this pass of battle and bitter
strife, when I shall lead thee into Burgdale to dwell there.  And thou
wottest of our people that there is little strife and grudging amongst
them, and that they are merry, and fair to look on, both men and women;
and no man there lacketh what the earth may give us, and it is a saying
amongst us that there may a man have that which he desireth save the sun
and moon in his hands to play with:  and of this gladness, which is made
up of many little matters, what story may be told?  Yet amongst it shall
I live and thou with me; and ill indeed it were if it wearied thee and
thou wert ever longing for some day of victorious strife, and to behold
me coming back from battle high-raised on the shields of men and crowned
with bay; if thine ears must ever be tickled with the talk of men and
their songs concerning my warrior deeds.  For thus it shall not be. 
When I drive the herds it shall be at the neighbours' bidding whereso
they will; not necks of men shall I smite, but the stalks of the tall
wheat, and the boles of the timber-trees which the woodreeve hath marked
for felling; the stilts of the plough rather than the hilts of the sword
shall harden my hands; my shafts shall be for the deer, and my spears
for the wood-boar, till war and sorrow fall upon us, and I fight for the
ceasing of war and trouble.  And though I be called a chief and of the
blood of chiefs, yet shall I not be masterful to the goodman of the
Dale, but rather to my hound; for my chieftainship shall be that I shall
be well beloved and trusted, and that no man shall grudge against me. 
Canst thou learn to love such a life, which to me seemeth lovely?  And
thou? of whom I say that thou art as if thou wert come down from the
golden chairs of the Burg of the Gods.'

They were well-nigh out of the steep path by now, and the daylight was
bright about them; there she stayed her feet a moment and turned to him
and said:

'All this should I love even now, if the grief of our Folk were but
healed, and hereafter shall I learn yet more of thy well-beloved face.'

Therewith she laid her face to his and kissed him fondly, and put his
hand to her side and held it there, saying:  'Soon shall we be one in
body and in soul.'

And he laughed with joy and pride of life, and took her hand and led her
on again, and said:

'Yet feel the cold rings of my hauberk, my friend; look at the spears
that cumber my hand, and at Dale-warden hanging by my side.  Thou shalt
yet see me as the Slain's Chooser would see her speech-friend; for there
is much to do ere we win wheat-harvest in Burgdale.'

Therewith they stepped together on to the level ground of the waste, and
saw Bow-may sitting on a stone hard by, and Wood-wise standing beside
her bending his bow.  Bow-may smiled on Gold-mane and rose up, and they
all went on together, turning so that they went nearly alongside the
wall of the Vale, but westering a little; then the Sun-beam said:

'Many a time have I trodden this heath alongside our rock-wall; for if
ye wend a little further as our faces are turned, ye come to the crags
over the place where the Shivering Flood goeth out of Shadowy Vale. 
There when ye have clomb a little may'st thou stand on the edge of the
rock-wall, and look down and behold the Flood swirling and eddying in
the black gorge of the rocks, and see presently the reek of the force go
up, and hear the thunder of the waters as they pour over it:  and all
this about us now is as the garden of our house--is it not so, Bow-may?'

'Yea,' said she, 'and there are goodly cluster-berries to be gotten
hereabout in the autumn; many a time have the Sun-beam and I reddened
our lips with them.  Yet is it best to be wary when war is abroad and
hot withal.'

'Yea,' said the Sun-beam, 'and all this place comes into the story of
our House:  lo!  Gold-mane, two score paces before us a little on our
right hand those five grey stones.  They are called the Rocks of the
Elders:  for there in the first days of our abiding in Shadowy Vale the
Elders were wont to come together to talk privily upon our matters.'

Face-of-god looked thither as she spoke, but therewith saw Bow-may, who
went on the left hand of the Sun-beam, as Face-of-god on her right hand,
notch a shaft on her bent bow, and Wood-wise, who was on his right hand,
saw it also and did the like, and therewithal Face-of-god got his target
on to his arm, and even as he did so Bow-may cried out suddenly:

'Yea, yea!  Cast thyself on to the ground, Sun-beam!  Gold-mane, targe
and spear, targe and spear!  For I see steel gleaming yonder out from
behind the Elders' Rocks.'

Scarce were the words out of her mouth ere three shafts came flying, and
the bow-strings twanged.  Gold-mane felt that one smote his helm and
glanced from it.  Therewithal he saw the Sun-beam fall to earth, though
he knew not if she had but cast herself down as Bow-may bade. Bow-may's
string twanged at once, and a yell came from the foemen: but Wood-wise
loosed not, but set his hand to his mouth and gave a loud wild cry--Ha!
ha! ha! ha!  How-ow-ow!--ending in a long and exceeding great whoop like
nought but the wolf's howl.  Now Gold-mane thinking swiftly, in a moment
of time, as war-meet men do, judged that if the Sun-beam were hurt (and
she had made no cry), it were yet wiser to fall on the foe before
turning to tend her, or else all might be lost; so he rushed forward
spear in hand and target on arm, and saw, as he opened up the flank of
the Elders' Rocks, six men, whereof one leaned aback on the rock with
Bow-may's shaft in his shoulder, and two others were just in act of
loosing at him.  In a moment, as he rushed at them, one shaft went
whistling by him, and the other glanced from off his target; he cast a
spear as he bounded on, and saw it smite one of the shooters full in the
naked face, and saw the blood spout out and change his face and the man
roll over, and then in another moment four men were hewing at him with
their short steel axes.  He thrust out his target against them, and then
let the weight of his body come on his other spear, and drave it through
the second shooter's throat, and even therewith was smitten on the helm
so hard that, though the Alderman's work held out, he fell to his knees,
holding his target over his head and striving to draw forth Dale-warden;
in that nick of time a shaft whistled close by his ear, and as he rose
to his feet again he saw his foeman rolling over and over, clutching at
the ling with both hands.  Then rang out again the terrible wolf-whoop
from Wood-wise's mouth, and both he and Bow-may loosed a shaft, for the
two other foes had turned their backs and were fleeing fast.  Again
Bow-may hit the clout, and the Dusky Man fell dead at once, but
Wood-wise's arrow flew over the felon's shoulder as he ran.  Then in a
trice was Gold-mane bounding after him like the hare just roused from
her form; for it came into his head that these felons had beheld them
coming up out of the Vale, and that if even this one man escaped, he
would bring his company down upon the Vale-dwellers.

Strong and light-foot as any was Face-of-god, and though he was cumbered
with his hauberk, yet was Iron-face's handiwork far lighter than the
war-coat of the Dusky Man, and the race was soon over.  The felon turned
breathless to meet Gold-mane, who drave his target against him and cast
him to earth, and as he strove to rise smote off his head at one stroke;
for Dale-warden was a good sword and the Dalesman as fierce of mood as
might be.  There he let the felon lie, and, turning, walked back swiftly
toward the Elders' Rocks, and found there Wood-wise and the dead foemen,
for the carle had slain the wounded, and he was now drawing the silver
arm-rings off the slain men; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver
arm-rings.  But Bow-may was walking towards the Sun-beam, and
thitherward followed Gold-mane speedily.

He found her sitting on a tussock of grass close by where she had
fallen, her face pale, her eyes eager and gleaming; she looked up at him
as he drew nigher and said:

'Friend, art thou hurt?'

'Nay,' he said, 'and thou?  Thou art pale.'

'I am not hurt,' she said.  Then she smiled and said again:

'Did I not tell thee that I am no warrior like Bow-may here?  Such deeds
make maidens pale.'

Said Bow-may:  'If ye will have the truth, Gold-mane, she is not wont to
grow pale when battle is nigh her.  Look you, she hath had the gift of a
new delight, and findeth it sweeter and softer than she had any thought
of; and now hath she feared lest it should be taken from her.'

'Bow-may saith but the sooth,' said the Sun-beam simply, 'and kind it is
of her to say it.  I saw thee, Bow-may, and good was thy shooting, and I
love thee for it.'

Said Bow-may:  'I never shoot otherwise than well.  But those idle
shooters of the Dusky Ones, whereabouts nigh to thee went their shafts?'

Said the Sun-beam:  'One just lifted the hair by my left ear, and that
was not so ill-aimed; as for the other, it pierced my raiment by my
right knee, and pinned me to the earth, so that I tottered and fell, and
my gown and smock are grievously wounded, both of them.'

And she took the folds of the garments in her hands to show the rents
therein; and her colour was come again, and she was glad.

'What were best to do now?' she said.

Said Face-of-god:  'Let us tarry a little; for some of thy carles shall
surely come up from the Vale:  because they will have heard Wood-wise's
whoop, since the wind sets that way.'

'Yea, they will come,' said the Sun-beam.

'Good is that,' said Face-of-god; 'for they shall take the dead felons
and cast them where they be not seen if perchance any more stray
hereby.  For if they wind them, they may well happen on the path down to
the Vale.  Also, my friend, it were well if thou wert to bid a good few
of the carles that are in the Vale to keep watch and ward about here,
lest there be more foemen wandering about the waste.'

She said:  'Thou art wise in war, Gold-mane; I will do as thou biddest
me.  But soothly this is a perilous thing that the Dusky Men are gotten
so close to the Vale.'

Said Face-of-god:  'This will Folk-might look to when he cometh home;
and it is most like that he will deem it good to fall on them somewhere
a good way aloof, so as to draw them off from wandering over the waste. 
Also I will do my best to busy them when I am home in Burgdale.'

Therewith came up Wood-wise, and fell to talk with them; and his mind it
was that these foemen were but a band of strayers, and had had no
inkling of Shadowy Vale till they had heard them talking together as
they came up the path from the Vale, and that then they had made that
ambush behind the Elders' Rocks, so that they might slay the men, and
then bear off the woman.  He said withal that it would be best to carry
their corpses further on, so that they might be cast over the cliffs
into the fierce stream of the Shivering Flood.

Amidst this talk came up men from the Vale, a score of them, well armed;
and they ran to meet the wayfarers; and when they heard what had
befallen, they rejoiced exceedingly, and were above all glad that
Face-of-god had shown himself doughty and deft; and they deemed his rede
wise, to set a watch thereabouts till Folk-might came home, and said
that they would do even so.

Then spake the Sun-beam and said:

'Now must ye wayfarers depart; for the road is but rough, and the day
not over-long.'

Then she turned to Face-of-god and put her hand on his shoulder, and
brought her face close to his and spake to him softly:

'Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee, and that I am now
so familiar to thee, I whom thou didst once deem to be a very goddess? 
And now thou hast seen me redden before thine eyes because of thee; and
thou hast seen me grow pale with fear because of thee; and thou hast
felt my caresses which I might not refrain; even as if I were altogether
such a maiden as ye warriors hang about for a nine days' wonder, and
then all is over save an aching heart--wilt thou do so with me?  Tell
me, have I not belittled myself before thee as if I asked thee to scorn
me?  For thus desire dealeth both with maid and man.'

He said:  'In all this there is but one thing for me to say, and that is
that I love thee; and surely none the less, but rather the more, because
thou lovest me, and art of my kind, and mayest share in my deeds and
think well of them.  Now is my heart full of joy, and one thing only
weigheth on it; and that is that my kinswoman the Bride begrudgeth our
love together.  For this is the thing that of all things most misliketh
me, that any should bear a grudge against me.'

She said:  'Forget not the token, and my message to her.'

'I will not forget it,' said he.  'And now I bid thee to kiss me even
before all these that are looking on; for there is nought to belittle us
therein, since we be troth-plight.'

And indeed those folk stood all round about them gazing on them, but a
little aloof, that they might not hear their words if they were minded
to talk privily.  For they had long loved the Sun-beam, and now the love
of Face-of-god had begun to spring up in their hearts.

So the twain embraced and kissed one another, and made no haste
thereover; and those men deemed that but meet and right, and clashed
their weapons on their shields in token of their joy.

Then Face-of-god turned about and strode out of the ring of men, with
Bow-may and Wood-wise beside him, and they went on their journey over
the necks towards Burgstead.  But the Sun-beam turned slowly from that
place toward the Vale, and two of the stoutest carles went along with
her to guard her from harm, and she went down into the Vale pondering
all these things in her heart.

Then the other carles dragged off the corpses of the Dusky Men till they
had brought them to the sheer rocks above the Shivering Flood, and there
they tossed them over into the boiling caldron of the force, and so
departed taking with them the silver arm-rings of the slain to add to
the tale.

But when they came back into the Vale the Sun-beam duly ordered that
watch and ward to keep the ingate thereto, and note all that should
befall till Folk-might came home.
