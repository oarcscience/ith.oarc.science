CHAPTER XVI—HOW THE DWARF-WROUGHT HAUBERK WAS BROUGHT AWAY FROM THE HALL
OF THE DAYLINGS

Now it must be told that early in the morning, after the night when
Gisli had brought to the Wolfing Stead the tidings of the Battle in the
Wood, a man came riding from the south to the Dayling abode.  It was
just before sunrise, and but few folk were stirring about the
dwellings.  He rode up to the Hall and got off his black horse, and tied
it to a ring in the wall by the Man's-door, and went in clashing, for he
was in his battle- gear, and had a great wide-rimmed helm on his head.

Folk were but just astir in the Hall, and there came an old woman to
him, and looked on him and saw by his attire that he was a man of the
Goths and of the Wolfing kindred; so she greeted him kindly: but he
said:

"Mother, I am come hither on an errand, and time presses."

Said she: "Yea, my son, or what tidings bearest thou from the south? for
by seeming thou art new-come from the host."

Said he: "The tidings are as yesterday, save that Thiodolf will lead the
host through the wild-wood to look for the Romans beyond it: therefore
will there soon be battle again.  See ye, Mother, hast thou here one
that knoweth this ring of Thiodolf's, if perchance men doubt me when I
say that I am sent on my errand by him?"

"Yea," she said, "Agni will know it; since he knoweth all the chief men
of the Mark; but what is thine errand, and what is thy name?"

"It is soon told," said he, "I am a Wolfing hight Thorkettle, and I come
to have away for Thiodolf the treasure of the world, the Dwarf-wrought
Hauberk, which he left with you when we fared hence to the south three
days ago.  Now let Agni come, that I may have it, for time presses
sorely."

There were three or four gathered about them now, and a maiden of them
said: "Shall I bring Agni hither, mother?"

"What needeth it?" said the carline, "he sleepeth, and shall be hard to
awaken; and he is old, so let him sleep.  I shall go fetch the hauberk,
for I know where it is, and my hand may come on it as easily as on mine
own girdle."

So she went her ways to the treasury where were the precious things of
the kindred; the woven cloths were put away in fair coffers to keep them
clean from the whirl of the Hall-dust and the reek; and the vessels of
gold and some of silver were standing on the shelves of a cupboard
before which hung a veil of needlework: but the weapons and war-gear
hung upon pins along the wall, and many of them had much fair work on
them, and were dight with gold and gems: but amidst them all was the
wondrous hauberk clear to see, dark grey and thin, for it was so
wondrously wrought that it hung in small compass.  So the carline took
it down from the pin, and handled it, and marvelled at it, and said:

"Strange are the hands that have passed over thee, sword-rampart, and in
strange places of the earth have they dwelt!  For no smith of the
kindreds hath fashioned thee, unless he had for his friend either a God
or a foe of the Gods.  Well shalt thou wot of the tale of sword and
spear ere thou comest back hither!  For Thiodolf shall bring thee where
the work is wild."

Then she went with the hauberk to the new-come warrior, and made no
delay, but gave it to him, and said:

"When Agni awaketh, I shall tell him that Thorkettle of the Wolfings
hath borne aback to Thiodolf the Treasure of the World, the
Dwarf-wrought Hauberk."

Then Thorkettle took it and turned to go; but even therewith came old
Asmund from out of his sleeping-place, and gazed around the Hall, and
his eyes fell on the shape of the Wolfing as he was going out of the
door, and he asked the carline.

"What doeth he here?  What tidings is there from the host?  For my soul
was nought unquiet last night."

"It is a little matter," she said; "the War-duke hath sent for the
wondrous Byrny that he left in our treasury when he departed to meet the
Romans.  Belike there shall be a perilous battle, and few hearts need a
stout sword-wall more than Thiodolf's."

As she spoke, Thorkettle had passed the door, and got into his saddle,
and sat his black horse like a mighty man as he slowly rode down the
turf bridge that led into the plain.  And Asmund went to the door and
stood watching him till he set spurs to his horse, and departed a great
gallop to the south.  Then said Asmund:

   "What then are the Gods devising, what wonders do they will?  
   What mighty need is on them to work the kindreds ill,  
   That the seed of the Ancient Fathers and a woman of their kin  
   With her all unfading beauty must blend herself therein?  
   Are they fearing lest the kindreds should grow too fair and great,  
   And climb the stairs of God-home, and fashion all their fate,  
   And make all earth so merry that it never wax the worse,  
   Nor need a gift from any, nor prayers to quench the curse?  
   Fear they that the Folk-wolf, growing as the fire from out the
spark  
   Into a very folk-god, shall lead the weaponed Mark  
   From wood to field and mountain, to stand between the earth  
   And the wrights that forge its thraldom and the sword to slay its
mirth?  
   Fear they that the sons of the wild-wood the Loathly Folk shall
quell,  
   And grow into Gods thereafter, and aloof in God-home dwell?"

Therewith he turned back into the Hall, and was heavy-hearted and dreary
of aspect; for he was somewhat foreseeing; and it may not be hidden that
this seeming Thorkettle was no warrior of the Wolfings, but the Wood-Sun
in his likeness; for she had the power and craft of shape-changing.
