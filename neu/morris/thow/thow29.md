CHAPTER XXVIII—OF THE STORM OF DAWNING

Then Thiodolf bade Fox and two others steal forward, and see what of
foemen was before them; so they fell to creeping on towards the open:
but scarcely had they started, before all men could hear the tramp of
men drawing nigh; then Thiodolf himself took with him a score of his
House and went quietly toward the wood-edge till they were barely within
the shadow of the beech-wood; and he looked forth and saw men coming
straight towards their lurking-place.  And those he saw were a good
many, and they were mostly of the dastards of the Goths; but with them
was a Captain of an Hundred of the Romans, and some others of his
kindred; and Thiodolf deemed that the Goths had been bidden to gather up
some of the night-watchers and enter the wood and fall on the
stay-at-homes.  So he bade his men get them aback, and he himself abode
still at the very wood's edge listening intently with his sword bare in
his hand.  And he noted that those men of the foe stayed in the daylight
outside the wood, but a few yards from it, and, by command as it seemed,
fell silent and spake no word; and the morn was very still, and when the
sound of their tramp over the grass had ceased, Thiodolf could hear the
tramp of more men behind them.  And then he had another thought, to wit
that the Romans had sent scouts to see if the Goths yet abided on the
vantage-ground by the ford, and that when they had found them gone, they
were minded to fall on them unawares in the refuge of the Thing-stead
and were about to do so by the counsel and leading of the dastard Goths;
and that this was one body of the host led by those dastards, who knew
somewhat of the woods.  So he drew aback speedily, and catching hold of
Fox by the shoulder (for he had taken him alone with him) he bade him
creep along through the wood toward the Thing-stead, and bring back
speedy word whether there were any more foemen near the wood thereaway;
and he himself came to his men, and ordered them for onset, drawing them
up in a shallow half moon, with the bowmen at the horns thereof, with
the word to loose at the Romans as soon as they heard the war-horn blow:
and all this was done speedily and with little noise, for they were well
nigh so arrayed already.

Thus then they waited, and there was more than a glimmer of light even
under the beechen leaves, and the eastern sky was yellowing to sunrise.
The other warriors were like hounds in the leash eager to be slipped;
but Thiodolf stood calm and high-hearted turning over the memory of past
days, and the time he thought of seemed long to him, but happy.

Scarce had a score of minutes passed, and the Romans before them, who
were now gathered thick behind those dastards of the Goths, had not
moved, when back comes Fox and tells how he has come upon a great
company of the Romans led by their thralls of the Goths who were just
entering the wood, away there towards the Thing-stead.

"But, War-duke," says he, "I came also across our own folk of the second
battle duly ordered in the wood ready to meet them; and they shall be
well dealt with, and the sun shall rise for us and not for them."

Then turns Thiodolf round to those nighest to him and says, but still
softly:

   "Hear ye a word, O people, of the wisdom of the foe!  
   Before us thick they gather, and unto the death they go.  
   They fare as lads with their cur-dogs who have stopped a fox's
earth,  
   And standing round the spinny, now chuckle in their mirth,  
   Till one puts by the leafage and trembling stands astare  
   At the sight of the Wood wolf's father arising in his lair—  
   They have come for our wives and our children, and our sword-edge
shall they meet;  
   And which of them is happy save he of the swiftest feet?"

Speedily then went that word along the ranks of the Kindred, and men
were merry with the restless joy of battle: but scarce had two minutes
passed ere suddenly the stillness of the dawn was broken by clamour and
uproar; by shouts and shrieks, and the clashing of weapons from the wood
on their left hand; and over all arose the roar of the Markmen's horn,
for the battle was joined with the second company of the Kindreds.  But
a rumour and murmur went from the foemen before Thiodolf's men; and then
sprang forth the loud sharp word of the captains commanding and
rebuking, as if the men were doubtful which way they should take.

Amidst all which Thiodolf brandished his sword, and cried out in a great
voice:

   "Now, now, ye War-sons!  
   Now the Wolf waketh!  
   Lo how the Wood-beast  
   Wendeth in onset.  
   E'en as his feet fare  
   Fall on and follow!"

And he led forth joyously, and terrible rang the long refrained gathered
shout of his battle as his folk rushed on together devouring the little
space between their ambush and the hazel-beset greensward.

In the twinkling of an eye the half-moon had lapped around the
Roman-Goths and those that were with them; and the dastards made no
stand but turned about at once, crying out that the Gods of the Kindreds
were come to aid and none could withstand them.  But these fleers thrust
against the band of Romans who were next to them, and bore them aback,
and great was the turmoil; and when Thiodolf's storm fell full upon
them, as it failed not to do, so close were they driven together that
scarce could any man raise his hand for a stroke.  For behind them stood
a great company of those valiant spearmen of the Romans, who would not
give way if anywise they might hold it out: and their ranks were closely
serried, shield nigh touching shield, and their faces turned toward the
foe; and so arrayed, though they might die, they scarce knew how to
flee.  As they might these thrust and hewed at the fleers, and gave
fierce words but few to the Roman-Goths, driving them back against their
foemen: but the fleers had lost the cunning of their right hands, and
they had cast away their shields and could not defend their very bodies
against the wrath of the kindreds; and when they strove to flee to the
right hand or to the left, they were met by the horns of the half-moon,
and the arrows began to rain in upon them, and from so close were they
shot at that no shaft failed to smite home.

There then were the dastards slain; and their bodies served for a
rampart against the onrush of the Markmen to those Romans who had stood
fast.  To them were gathering more and more every minute, and they faced
the Goths steadily with their hard brown visages and gleaming eyes above
their iron- plated shields; not casting their spears, but standing
closely together, silent, but fierce.  The light was spread now over all
the earth; the eastern heavens were grown golden-red, flecked here and
there with little crimson clouds: this battle was fallen near silent,
but to the North was great uproar of shouts and cries, and the roaring
of the war-horns, and the shrill blasts of the brazen trumpets.

Now Thiodolf, as his wont was when he saw that all was going well, had
refrained himself of hand-strokes, but was here and there and everywhere
giving heart to his folk, and keeping them in due order, and close
array, lest the Romans should yet come among them.  But he watched the
ranks of the foe, and saw how presently they began to spread out beyond
his, and might, if it were not looked to, take them in flank; and he was
about to order his men anew to meet them, when he looked on his left
hand and saw how Roman men were pouring thick from the wood out of all
array, followed by a close throng of the kindreds: for on this side the
Romans were outnumbered and had stumbled unawares into the ambush of the
Markmen, who had fallen on them straightway and disarrayed them from the
first.  This flight of their folk the Romans saw also, and held their
men together, refraining from the onset, as men who deem that they will
have enough to do to stand fast.

But the second battle of the Markmen, (who were of the Nether-mark,
mingled with the Mid-mark) fought wisely, for they swept those fleers
from before them, slaying many and driving the rest scattering, yet held
the chase for no long way, but wheeling about came sidelong on toward
the battle of the Romans and Thiodolf.  And when Thiodolf saw that, he
set up the whoop of victory, he and his, and fell fiercely on the
Romans, casting everything that would fly, as they rushed on to the
handplay; so that there was many a Roman slain with the Roman spears
that those who had fallen had left among their foemen.

Now the Roman captains perceived that it availed not to tarry till the
men of the Mid and Nether-marks fell upon their flank; so they gave
command, and their ranks gave back little by little, facing their foes,
and striving to draw themselves within the dike and garth, which, after
their custom, they had already cast up about the Wolfing Roof, their
stronghold.

Now as fierce as was the onset of the Markmen, the main body of the
Romans could not be hindered from doing this much before the men of the
second battle were upon them; but Thiodolf and Arinbiorn with some of
the mightiest brake their array in two places and entered in amongst
them. And wrath so seized upon the soul of Arinbiorn for the slaying of
Otter, and his own fault towards him, that he cast away his shield, and
heeding no strokes, first brake his sword in the press, and then,
getting hold of a great axe, smote at all before him as though none
smote at him in turn; yea, as though he were smiting down tree-boles for
a match against some other mighty man; and all the while amidst the
hurry, strokes of swords and spears rained on him, some falling flatwise
and some glancing sideways, but some true and square, so that his helm
was smitten off and his hauberk rent adown, and point and edge reached
his living flesh; and he had thrust himself so far amidst the foe that
none could follow to shield him, so that at last he fell shattered and
rent at the foot of the new clayey wall cast up by the Romans, even as
Thiodolf and a band with him came cleaving the press, and the Romans
closed the barriers against friend and foe, and cast great beams adown,
and masses of iron and lead and copper taken from the smithying-booths
of the Wolfings, to stay them if it were but a little.

Then Thiodolf bestrode the fallen warrior, and men of his House were
close behind him, for wisely had he fought, cleaving the press like a
wedge, helping his friends that they might help him, so that they all
went forward together.  But when he saw Arinbiorn fall he cried out:

"Woe's me, Arinbiorn! that thou wouldest not wait for me; for the day is
young yet, and over-young!"

There then they cleared the space outside the gate, and lifted up the
Bearing Warrior, and bare him back from the rampart.  For so fierce had
been the fight and so eager the storm of those that had followed after
him that they must needs order their battle afresh, since Thiodolf's
wedge which he had driven into the Roman host was but of a few and the
foe had been many and the rampart and the shot-weapons were close anigh.
Wise therefore it seemed to abide them of the second battle and join
with them to swarm over the new-built slippery wall in the teeth of the
Roman shot.

In this, the first onset of the Morning Battle, some of the Markmen had
fallen, but not many, since but a few had entered outright into the
Roman ranks; and when they first rushed on from the wood but three of
them were slain, and the slaughter was all of the dastards and the
Romans; and afterwards not a few of the Romans were slain, what by
Arinbiorn, what by the others; for they were fighting fleeing, and
before their eyes was the image of the garth-gate which was behind them;
and they stumbled against each other as they were driven sideways
against the onrush of the Goths, nor were they now standing fair and
square to them, and they were hurried and confused with the dread of the
onset of them of the two Marks.

As yet Thiodolf had gotten no great hurt, so that when he heard that
Arinbiorn's soul had passed away he smiled and said:

"Yea, yea, Arinbiorn might have abided the end, for ere then shall the
battle be hard."

So now the Wolfings and the Bearings met joyously the kindreds of the
Nether Mark and the others of the second battle, and they sang the song
of victory arrayed in good order hard by the Roman rampart, while
bowstrings twanged and arrows whistled, and sling-stones hummed from
this side and from that.

And of their song of victory thus much the tale telleth:

      "Now hearken and hear  
      Of the day-dawn of fear,  
      And how up rose the sun  
      On the battle begun.  
      All night lay a-hiding,  
      Our anger abiding,  
      Dark down in the wood  
      The sharp seekers of blood;  
   But ere red grew the heaven we bore them all bare,  
   For against us undriven the foemen must fare;  
   They sought and they found us, and sorrowed to find,  
   For the tree-boles around us the story shall mind,  
   How fast from the glooming they fled to the light,  
   Yeasaying the dooming of Tyr of the fight.

      "Hearken yet and again  
      How the night gan to wane,  
      And the twilight stole on  
      Till the world was well won!  
      E'en in such wise was wending  
      A great host for our ending;  
      On our life-days e'en so  
      Stole the host of the foe;  
   Till the heavens grew lighter, and light grew the world,  
   And the storm of the fighter upon them was hurled,  
   Then some fled the stroke, and some died and some stood,  
   Till the worst of the storm broke right out from the wood,  
   And the war-shafts were singing the carol of fear,  
   The tale of the bringing the sharp swords anear.

      "Come gather we now,  
      For the day doth grow.  
      Come, gather, ye bold,  
      Lest the day wax old;  
      Lest not till to-morrow  
      We slake our sorrow,  
      And heap the ground  
      With many a mound.  
   Come, war-children, gather, and clear we the land!  
   In the tide of War-father the deed is to hand.  
   Clad in gear that we gilded they shrink from our sword;  
   In the House that we builded they sit at the board;  
   Come, war-children, gather, come swarm o'er the wall  
   For the feast of War-father to sweep out the Hall!"

Now amidst of their singing the sun rose upon the earth, and gleamed in
the arms of men, and lit the faces of the singing warriors as they stood
turned toward the east.

In this first onset of battle but twenty and three Markmen were slain in
all, besides Arinbiorn; for, as aforesaid, they had the foe at a
disadvantage.  And this onset is called in the tale the Storm of
Dawning.
