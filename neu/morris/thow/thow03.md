CHAPTER II—THE FLITTING OF THE WAR-ARROW

Tells the tale that it was an evening of summer, when the wheat was in
the ear, but yet green; and the neat-herds were done driving the milch-
kine to the byre, and the horseherds and the shepherds had made the
night- shift, and the out-goers were riding two by two and one by one
through the lanes between the wheat and the rye towards the meadow. 
Round the cots of the thralls were gathered knots of men and women both
thralls and freemen, some talking together, some hearkening a song or a
tale, some singing and some dancing together; and the children
gambolling about from group to group with their shrill and tuneless
voices, like young throstles who have not yet learned the song of their
race.  With these were mingled dogs, dun of colour, long of limb,
sharp-nosed, gaunt and great; they took little heed of the children as
they pulled them about in their play, but lay down, or loitered about,
as though they had forgotten the chase and the wild-wood.

Merry was the folk with that fair tide, and the promise of the harvest,
and the joy of life, and there was no weapon among them so close to the
houses, save here and there the boar-spear of some herdman or herd-woman
late come from the meadow.

Tall and for the most part comely were both men and women; the most of
them light-haired and grey-eyed, with cheek-bones somewhat high; white
of skin but for the sun's burning, and the wind's parching, and whereas
they were tanned of a very ruddy and cheerful hue.  But the thralls were
some of them of a shorter and darker breed, black-haired also and
dark-eyed, lighter of limb; sometimes better knit, but sometimes
crookeder of leg and knottier of arm.  But some also were of build and
hue not much unlike to the freemen; and these doubtless came of some
other Folk of the Goths which had given way in battle before the Men of
the Mark, either they or their fathers.

Moreover some of the freemen were unlike their fellows and kindred,
being slenderer and closer-knit, and black-haired, but grey-eyed withal;
and amongst these were one or two who exceeded in beauty all others of
the House.

Now the sun was set and the glooming was at point to begin and the
shadowless twilight lay upon the earth.  The nightingales on the borders
of the wood sang ceaselessly from the scattered hazel-trees above the
greensward where the grass was cropped down close by the nibbling of the
rabbits; but in spite of their song and the divers voices of the
men-folk about the houses, it was an evening on which sounds from aloof
can be well heard, since noises carry far at such tides.

Suddenly they who were on the edges of those throngs and were the less
noisy, held themselves as if to listen; and a group that had gathered
about a minstrel to hear his story fell hearkening also round about the
silenced and hearkening tale-teller: some of the dancers and singers
noted them and in their turn stayed the dance and kept silence to
hearken; and so from group to group spread the change, till all were
straining their ears to hearken the tidings.  Already the men of the
night-shift had heard it, and the shepherds of them had turned about,
and were trotting smartly back through the lanes of the tall wheat: but
the horse-herds were now scarce seen on the darkening meadow, as they
galloped on fast toward their herds to drive home the stallions.  For
what they had heard was the tidings of war.

There was a sound in the air as of a humble-bee close to the ear of one
lying on a grassy bank; or whiles as of a cow afar in the meadow lowing
in the afternoon when milking-time draws nigh: but it was ever shriller
than the one, and fuller than the other; for it changed at whiles,
though after the first sound of it, it did not rise or fall, because the
eve was windless.  You might hear at once that for all it was afar, it
was a great and mighty sound; nor did any that hearkened doubt what it
was, but all knew it for the blast of the great war-horn of the Elkings,
whose Roof lay up Mirkwood-water next to the Roof of the Wolfings.

So those little throngs broke up at once; and all the freemen, and of
the thralls a good many, flocked, both men and women, to the Man's-door
of the hall, and streamed in quietly and with little talk, as men
knowing that they should hear all in due season.

Within under the Hall-Sun, amidst the woven stories of time past, sat
the elders and chief warriors on the dais, and amidst of all a big
strong man of forty winters, his dark beard a little grizzled, his eyes
big and grey.  Before him on the board lay the great War-horn of the
Wolfings carved out of the tusk of a sea-whale of the North and with
many devices on it and the Wolf amidst them all; its golden mouth-piece
and rim wrought finely with flowers.  There it abode the blowing, until
the spoken word of some messenger should set forth the tidings borne on
the air by the horn of the Elkings.

But the name of the dark-haired chief was Thiodolf (to wit Folk-wolf)
and he was deemed the wisest man of the Wolfings, and the best man of
his hands, and of heart most dauntless.  Beside him sat the fair woman
called the Hall-Sun; for she was his foster-daughter before men's eyes;
and she was black-haired and grey-eyed like to her fosterer, and never
was woman fashioned fairer: she was young of years, scarce twenty
winters old.

There sat the chiefs and elders on the dais, and round about stood the
kindred intermingled with the thralls, and no man spake, for they were
awaiting sure and certain tidings: and when all were come in who had a
mind to, there was so great a silence in the hall, that the song of the
nightingales on the wood-edge sounded clear and loud therein, and even
the chink of the bats about the upper windows could be heard.  Then
amidst the hush of men-folk, and the sounds of the life of the earth
came another sound that made all turn their eyes toward the door; and
this was the pad-pad of one running on the trodden and summer-dried
ground anigh the hall: it stopped for a moment at the Man's-door, and
the door opened, and the throng parted, making way for the man that
entered and came hastily up to the midst of the table that stood on the
dais athwart the hall, and stood there panting, holding forth in his
outstretched hand something which not all could see in the dimness of
the hall-twilight, but which all knew nevertheless.  The man was young,
lithe and slender, and had no raiment but linen breeches round his
middle, and skin shoes on his feet.  As he stood there gathering his
breath for speech, Thiodolf stood up, and poured mead into a drinking
horn and held it out towards the new-comer, and spake, but in rhyme and
measure:

   "Welcome, thou evening-farer, and holy be thine head,  
   Since thou hast sought unto us in the heart of the Wolfings' stead;  
   Drink now of the horn of the mighty, and call a health if thou wilt  
   O'er the eddies of the mead-horn to the washing out of guilt.  
   For thou com'st to the peace of the Wolfings, and our very guest
thou    art,  
   And meseems as I behold thee, that I look on a child of the Hart."

 

But the man put the horn from him with a hasty hand, and none said
another word to him until he had gotten his breath again; and then he
said:

   "All hail ye Wood-Wolfs' children! nought may I drink the wine,  
   For the mouth and the maw that I carry this eve are nought of mine;  
   And my feet are the feet of the people, since the word went forth
that tide,  
   'O Elf here of the Hartings, no longer shalt thou bide  
   In any house of the Markmen than to speak the word and wend,  
   Till all men know the tidings and thine errand hath an end.'  
   Behold, O Wolves, the token and say if it be true!  
   I bear the shaft of battle that is four-wise cloven through,  
   And its each end dipped in the blood-stream, both the iron and the
horn,  
   And its midmost scathed with the fire; and the word that I have
borne  
   Along with this war-token is, 'Wolfings of the Mark  
   Whenso ye see the war-shaft, by the daylight or the dark,  
   Busk ye to battle faring, and leave all work undone  
   Save the gathering for the handplay at the rising of the sun.  
   Three days hence is the hosting, and thither bear along  
   Your wains and your kine for the slaughter lest the journey should be
long.  
   For great is the Folk, saith the tidings, that against the Markmen
come;  
   In a far off land is their dwelling, whenso they sit at home,  
   And Welsh <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) is their tongue, and we
wot not of the word that is in their mouth,  
   As they march a many together from the cities of the South.'"

Therewith he held up yet for a minute the token of the war-arrow ragged
and burnt and bloody; and turning about with it in his hand went his
ways through the open door, none hindering; and when he was gone, it was
as if the token were still in the air there against the heads of the
living men, and the heads of the woven warriors, so intently had all
gazed at it; and none doubted the tidings or the token.  Then said
Thiodolf:

   "Forth will we Wolfing children, and cast a sound abroad:  
   The mouth of the sea-beast's weapon shall speak the battle-word;  
   And ye warriors hearken and hasten, and dight the weed of war,  
   And then to acre and meadow wend ye adown no more,  
   For this work shall be for the women to drive our neat from the
mead,  
   And to yoke the wains, and to load them as the men of war have need."

Out then they streamed from the hall, and no man was left therein save
the fair Hall-Sun sitting under the lamp whose name she bore.  But to
the highest of the slope they went, where was a mound made higher by
man's handiwork; thereon stood Thiodolf and handled the horn, turning
his face toward the downward course of Mirkwood-water; and he set the
horn to his lips, and blew a long blast, and then again, and yet again
the third time; and all the sounds of the gathering night were hushed
under the sound of the roaring of the war-horn of the Wolfings; and the
Kin of the Beamings heard it as they sat in their hall, and they gat
them ready to hearken to the bearer of the tidings who should follow on
the sound of the war-blast.

But when the last sound of the horn had died away, then said Thiodolf:  
   "Now Wolfing children hearken, what the splintered War-shaft saith,  
   The fire scathed blood-stained aspen! we shall ride for life or
death,  
   We warriors, a long journey with the herd and with the wain;  
   But unto this our homestead shall we wend us back again,  
   All the gleanings of the battle; and here for them that live  
   Shall stand the Roof of the Wolfings, and for them shall the meadow
thrive,  
   And the acres give their increase in the harvest of the year;  
   Now is no long departing since the Hall-Sun bideth here  
   'Neath the holy Roof of the Fathers, and the place of the Wolfing
kin,  
   And the feast of our glad returning shall yet be held therein.  
   Hear the bidding of the War-shaft!  All men, both thralls and free,  
   'Twixt twenty winters and sixty, beneath the shield shall be,  
   And the hosting is at the Thing-stead, the Upper-mark anigh;  
   And we wend away to-morrow ere the Sun is noon-tide high."

Therewith he stepped down from the mound, and went his way back to the
hall; and manifold talk arose among the folk; and of the warriors some
were already dight for the journey, but most not, and a many went their
ways to see to their weapons and horses, and the rest back again into
the hall.

By this time night had fallen, and between then and the dawning would be
no darker hour, for the moon was just rising; a many of the horse-herds
had done their business, and were now making their way back again
through the lanes of the wheat, driving the stallions before them, who
played together kicking, biting and squealing, paying but little heed to
the standing corn on either side.  Lights began to glitter now in the
cots of the thralls, and brighter still in the stithies where already
you might hear the hammers clinking on the anvils, as men fell to
looking to their battle gear.

But the chief men and the women sat under their Roof on the eve of
departure: and the tuns of mead were broached, and the horns filled and
borne round by young maidens, and men ate and drank and were merry; and
from time to time as some one of the warriors had done with giving heed
to his weapons, he entered into the hall and fell into the company of
those whom he loved most and by whom he was best beloved; and whiles
they talked, and whiles they sang to the harp up and down that long
house; and the moon risen high shone in at the windows, and there was
much laughter and merriment, and talk of deeds of arms of the old days
on the eve of that departure: till little by little weariness fell on
them, and they went their ways to slumber, and the hall was fallen
silent.
