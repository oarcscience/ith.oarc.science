This is one of William Morris' fantasy books, set in the world of the
ancient Germanic Gothic tribes. J.R.R. Tolkien acknowledged the literary
influence of this book, as well as [The Roots of the
Mountains](../rotm/index), published in the same year. In this book,
Morris' Goths live in a land called the Mark on a river in the forest of
Mirkwood, in ancent Germany. They worship the Germanic gods Tyr and Odin
by horse-sacrifice. Morris' Goths have shamans who can see the future.
They repel an invasion by the Romans, led by a war leader with a
mysterious piece of cursed dwarf-forged armor.
