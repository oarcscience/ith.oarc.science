CHAPTER XV.

OF GOLDILIND IN THE WILD-WOOD.

Goldilind rode on, hastening yet to put as many miles as she might
betwixt her and Greenharbour.  Within a three hours from her bathing she
fell a-hungering sore, and knew not what to do to eat, till she found a
pouch made fast to the saddle-bow, and therein a little white loaf, that
and no more, which she took and ate the half of with great joy, sitting
down by a brook-side, whence she had her drink.

Then again she mounted, and rode on till dusk overtook her just as she
came to a little river running from the north from pool to shallow, and
shallow to pool.  And whereas she was now exceeding weary, and the good
horse also much spent, and that the grass was very sweet and soft down
to the water's edge, and that there was a thick thorn-bush to cover her,
she made up her mind that this place should be her bed-chamber.  So she
took saddle and bridle off the horse, as he must needs bite the grass,
and then when she had eaten the other half of her bread, she laid her
down on the green grass, with her head on the saddle, and when she had
lain listening to the horse cropping the grass close anigh her for a
minute or two, she fell fast asleep, and lay there long and had no
dreams.
