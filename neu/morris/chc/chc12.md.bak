CHAPTER XI.

HOW CHRISTOPHER CAME TO LITTLEDALE TO ABIDE THERE A WHILE.

In about a week's time from this, those four fellows went their ways
southward from the Tofts, having with them four good nags and four
sumpter beasts laden with such things as they needed, whereof were
weapons enough, though they all, save Christopher, bare bows; and he and
the others were girt with swords, and a leash of good dogs followed
them.  Two milch kine also they drave with them.

Merry they were all as they went their ways through the woods, but the
gladness of Christopher was even past words; wherefore, after a little,
he spake scarce at all, but sat in his saddle hearkening the tales and
songs and jests of his fellows, who went close beside him, for more
often they went a-foot than rode.  And, forsooth, as the sweet morning
wore, it seemed to him, so great was his joy, as if all the fair show of
the greenery, and the boles of the ancient oaks, and the squirrels
running from bough to bough, and the rabbits scuttling from under the
bracken, and the hind leaping in the wood-lawn, and the sun falling
through the rustling leaves, and the wind on his face, and the scent of
the forest, yea, and his fair companions and their loveliness & valiancy
and kindness, and the words and songs that came from their dear mouths,
all these seemed to him, as it were, one great show done for the behoof
and pleasure of him, the man come from the peril of death and the
sick-bed.

They lay that night in all glee under the green boughs; and arose on the
morrow, and went all day, and again slept in the greenwood, and the next
morning came down into a fair valley, which was indeed Littledale,
through which ran a pleasant little river; and on a grassy knoll, but a
short way from its bank, was a long framed hall, somewhat narrow, and
nought high, whitherward they turned them straightway, and were
presently before the door; then Gilbert drew a key from out of his scrip
and unlocked the door, and they entered, and found within a fair little
hall, with shut-beds out from it on the further side, and kitchen, and
store-bowers at the end; all things duly appointed with plenishing, and
meal and wine; for it was but some three months since one of Jack of the
Tofts' allies, Sir Launcelot a'Green and his wife and two bairns, had
left it till their affair was made straight; whereas he had dwelt there
a whole year, for he had been made an outlaw of Meadham, and was a dear
friend of the said Jack.

"Now," said David smiling, "here is now thy high house and thy castle,
little King Christopher; how doth it like thee?"

"Right well," said Christopher; "and, to say sooth, I would almost that
it were night, or my bones do else, that I might lie naked in a bed."

"Nay, lad," said Gilbert, "make it night now, and we will do all that
needs must be done, while thou liest lazy, as all kings use to do."

"Nay," said Christopher, "I will be more a king than so, for I will do
neither this nor that; I will not work and I will not go to bed, but
will look on, till it is time for me to take to the crooked stick and
the grey-goose wing and seek venison."

"That is better than well," said David; "for I can see by thine eyes,
that are dancing with pleasure, that in three or four days thou wilt be
about the thickets with us."

"Meantime," said Joanna, "thou shalt pay for thy meat and drink by
telling us tales when we come home weary."

"Yea," said Christopher laughing, "that ye may go to sleep before your
time."

So they talked, and were joyous and blithe together, and between them
they made the house trim, and decked it with boughs and blossoms; and
though Christopher told them no tale that night, Joanna and David sang
both; and in a night or two it was Christopher that was the minstrel. 
So when the morrow came there began their life of the woodland; but,
save for the changing of the year and the chances of the hunt, the time
passed on from day to day with little change, and it was but seldom that
any man came their way. When Yule was, they locked the house door behind
them and went their ways home to the Tofts; and now of all of these
wayfarers was Christopher by far the hardest and strongest, for his side
had utterly forgotten Simon's knife.  At the Tofts they were welcomed
with all triumph, and they were about there in the best of cheer, till
it was wearing toward Candlemas, and then they took occasion of a bright
and sunny day to go back to Littledale once more, and there they abode
till spring was come and was wearing into summer, and messages had come
and gone betwixt them and the Tofts, and it was agreed that with the
first of autumn they should go back to the Tofts and see what should
betide.

But now leave we Christopher and these good fellows of the Tofts and
turn to Goldilind, who is yet dwelling amid no very happy days in the
Castle of Greenharbour, on the northernmost marches of Meadham.
