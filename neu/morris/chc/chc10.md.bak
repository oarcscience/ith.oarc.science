CHAPTER IX.

SQUIRE SIMON COMES BACK TO OAKENHAM.  THE EARL MARSHAL TAKEN TO KING IN
OAKENREALM.

Now as to Squire Simon, whether the devil helped him, or his luck, or
were it his own cunning and his, horse's stoutness, we wot not; but in
any case he fell not in with Ralph Longshanks and Anthony Green, but
rode as far and as fast as his horse would go, and then lay down in the
wild-wood; and on the morrow arose and went his ways, and came in the
even to the Castle of the Uttermost March, and went on thence the morrow
after on a fresh horse to Oakenham.  There he made no delay but went
straight to the High House, and had privy speech of the Earl Marshal;
and him he told how he had smitten Christopher, and, as he deemed, slain
him.  The Earl Marshal looked on him grimly and said:  "Where is the
ring then?"

"I have it not," said Simon.  "How might I light down to take it, when
the seven sons were hard on us?" And therewith he told him all the tale,
and how he had risen to slay Christopher the even before; and how he had
found out after that the youngling had become guest and fosterling of
the folk of the Tofts; and how warily Christopher had ridden, so that
he, Simon, had had to do his best at the last moment. "And now, Lord,"
quoth he, "I see that it will be my luck to have grudging of thee, or
even worse it may be; yea, or thou wilt be presently telling me that I
am a liar and never struck the stroke: but I warrant me that by this
time Jack of the Tofts knoweth better, for I left my knife in the
youngling's breast, and belike he wotteth of my weapons. Well, then, if
thou wilt be quit of me, thou hast but to forbear upholding me against
the Toft folk, and then am I gone without any to-do of thee."

Earl Rolf spake quietly in answer, though his face was somewhat
troubled:  "Nay, Simon, I doubt thee not, not one word; for why
shouldest thou lie to me? nor do I deem thou wouldest, for thou art
trusty and worthy.  Yet sore I doubt if the child be dead. Well, even so
let it be, for I am alive; and full surely I am mightier than Jack of
the Tofts, both to uphold thee against him (wherein I shall not fail),
and otherwise.  But may God make me even as that young man if I be not
mightier yet in a few days.  But now do thou go and eat and drink and
take thy disport; for thou hast served me well; and in a little while I
shall make thee knight and lord, and do all I can to pleasure thee."

So then Simon knelt to the Earl and made obeisance to him, and arose and
went his ways, light-hearted and merry.

But within the month it so befel that some of the lords and dukes came
to the Earl Marshal, and prayed him to call together a great Folk-mote
of all Oakenrealm; and he answered them graciously, and behight them to
do as they would; and even so did he.

And that Mote was very great, and whenas it was hallowed, there arose a
great lord, grey and ancient, and bewailed him before the folk, that
they had no king over Oakenrealm to uphold the laws & ward the land; and
"Will ye live bare and kingless for ever?" said he at last.  "Will ye
not choose you a king, and crown him, before I die, and we others of the
realm who are old and worn?" Then he sat down, and another arose, and in
plain terms he bade them take the Earl Marshal to king.  And then arose
one after other, and each sang the same song, till the hearts of the
people grew warm with the big words, and at first many, and then more
cried out:  "A King, a King! The Earl Marshal for King! Earl Rolf for
King!" So that at last the voices rose into a great roar, and sword
clashed on shield, and they who were about the Earl turned to him and
upraised him on a great war-shield, and he stood thereon above the folk
with a naked sword in his hand, and all the folk shouted about him.

Thereafter the chiefs and all the mightiest came and did homage to him
for King of Oakenrealm as he sat on the Hill of the Folk-mote:  and that
night there was once more a King of Oakenrealm, and Earl Rolf was no
more, but King Rolf ruled the people.

But now the tale leaves telling of him, and turns again to Christopher
the woodman, who lay sick of his hurt in the House of the Tofts.
