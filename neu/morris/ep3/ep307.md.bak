### THE RING GIVEN TO VENUS.

#### ARGUMENT.

THERE was a man in a certain great city who on his wedding- day
unwittingly gave his spousal-ring to the Goddess Venus, and for this
cause trouble came upon him, till in the end he got his ring back again.

THE story of this chronicle  
Doth of an ancient city tell,  
Well built upon a goodly shore;  
The wide lands stretched behind it bore  
Great wealth of oil and wine and wheat;  
The great sea carried to its feet  
The dainty things of many lands;  
There the hid miners’ toiling hands  
Dragged up to light the dull blue lead,  
And silver white, and copper red,  
And dreadful iron; many a time  
The sieves swung to the women's rhyme  
O’er gravelly streams that carried down  
The golden sand from caves unknown;  
Dark basalt o’er the sea's beat stood,  
And porphyry cliffs as red as blood;  
From the white marble quarries' edge  
Down to the sweeping river's sedge, <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>  
Sheep bore the web that was to be;  
The purple lay beneath the sea,  
The madder waved in the light wind,  
The woad-stalks did the peasant bind  
That were to better his worn hood;  
And ever, amid all things good,  
Least of all things this lucky land  
Lacked for the craftsman's cunning hand.

   So richer grew that city still  
Through many a year of good and ill,  
And when the white beasts drew the car  
That bore their banner to the war,  
From out the brazen gates enwrought  
With many a dreamer's steadfast thought,  
An hundred thousand men poured out  
To shake the scared earth with their shout.

   Now little will your wonder be  
That mid so great prosperity  
Enough there was of ill and sin;  
That many folk who dwelt therein  
Lived evil lives from day to day,  
Nor put their worst desires away.  
But as in otherwise indeed  
Of God's good pardon had they need,  
And were herein as other folk,  
So must they bear this added yoke,  
That rife was wicked sorcery there; <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
And why I know not; if it were  
Wrought by a lingering memory  
Of how that land was wont to be  
A dwelling-place, a great stronghold  
Unto the cozening gods of old.  
It might be so; but add thereto  
That of all men life's sweets they knew,  
That death to them was wholly bad,  
So that perchance a hope they had  
That yet another power there was  
Than His who brought that death to pass.

   Howe’er that may be, this I know,  
That in that land men's lives were so  
That they in trouble still must turn  
Unholy things and strange to learn:  
Had this man mid the infidel  
A lost son, folk might buy and sell;  
Did that one fear to pass his life  
With unrewarded love at strife;  
Or had he a long-missing keel;  
Or was he with the commonweal  
In deadly strife; or perchance laid  
Abed, by fever long downweighed;  
Or were his riches well-nigh done;—  
Love, strife, or sickness, all was one,  
This seemed the last resource to them,  
To catch out at the strange-wrought hem  
Of the dark gown that hid away <span id="page_183">p. 183</span>  
The highest ill from light of day.  
   Yea, though the word unspoken was,  
And though each day the holy mass  
At many an altar gold-arrayed  
From out the painted book was said,  
And though they doubted nought at all  
Of how the day of days must fall  
At last upon the earth, and range  
All things aright that once seemed strange;  
Yet Evil seemed so great a thing  
That ’neath its dusk o’ershadowing wing  
They needs must cower down; now at least  
While half a god and half a beast  
Man seemed; some parley must they hold  
With God's foe, nor be overbold  
Before the threatening of a hand  
Whose might they did not understand,  
Though oftentimes they felt it sore:  
And through this faithlessness, the more  
Ill things had power there, as I deem,  
Till some men's lives were like a dream,  
Where nought in order can be set,  
And nought worth thence the soul may get,  
Or weigh one thing for what it is;  
Yea, at the best mid woe and bliss,  
Some dreamlike day would come to most.

   Now this great city still made boast  
That, mid her merchant's, men there were <span id="page_184">p.
184</span>  
Who e’en from kings the bell might bear  
For wealth and honour: and I think  
That no men richer wines might drink,  
Were better housed, or braver clad,  
Or more of all the world's joy had  
Than their rich men; that no king's door  
Could show forth greater crowds of poor,  
Who lacked for bread and all things good,  
Than in that land a merchant's could—  
Yea, rich indeed ’mongst all were they.

   Now on a certain summer day  
One of their fairest palaces,  
A paradise midst whispering trees,  
Beyond its wont was bright and fair;  
Great feast did men get ready there,  
Because its young lord, lately come  
Back from the eastlands to his home,  
That day should wed a lovely maid;  
He, for that tide too long delayed,  
A lading of great rarities  
Had brought to dazzle those sweet eyes;  
So had you wandered through the house  
From hall to chamber amorous,  
While in the minster church hard by,  
Mid incense smoke and psalmody,  
The gold-clad priest made one of twain,  
So wandering had you tried in vain  
To light on an uncomely thing; <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>  
Such dyes as stain the parrot's wing,  
The May-flowers or the evening sky,  
Made bright the silken tapestry;  
And threaded pearls therein were wrought,  
And emeralds from far eastlands brought  
To deck the shapes of knight and king;—  
His maybe who of old did sing  
God's praises ’twixt the shield and spear,  
Or his the Trojan folk did fear.  
Or from the silken mimicry  
Of fair Cassandra might you see  
Oileus the red ruby tear,  
As he her snowy breast made bare;  
Since woe itself must there be sweet  
For such a place to be made meet.

   If such things hid the marble walls,  
What wonder that the swift footfalls  
Were dulled upon the marble floor  
By silken webs from some far shore,  
Whereon were pictured images  
Of other beasts and other trees  
And other birds than these men knew;  
That from the vaulted ceilings’ blue  
Stars shone like Danaë's coming shower,  
Or that some deftly painted bower  
Thence mocked the roses of that day?  
   Full many a life had passed away,  
And many a once young hand grown old, <span id="page_186">p.
186</span>  
Dealing with silk and gems and gold,  
Through weary days and anxious nights,  
That went to fashion those delights,  
Which added now small bliss indeed  
To those who pleasure had to meed  
Upon a day when all were glad:  
Yet when the Church all dues had had,  
And the street, filled with minstrelsy,  
Gave token of the twain anigh;  
When through the hall-doors, open wide,  
Streamed in the damsels of the bride;  
When the tall brown-cheeked bridegroom came  
Flushed with hot love and pride and shame,  
And by the hand his love led on,  
Who midst that glorious company shone  
Like some piece of the pale moonlight  
Cut off from quietness and night,—  
Then all these dainty things in sooth  
Seemed meet for such an hour of youth;  
And vain were words such joy to stay;  
And deathless seemed that little day,  
And as a fitful hapless dream  
The past and future well might seem.

   What need to tell how sea and earth  
Had been run through to make more mirth,  
For folk already overglad—  
What cunning pageants there they had;  
What old tales acted o’er again, <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>  
Where grief and death glad folk did feign,  
Who deemed their own joy still would bide;  
What old songs sung wherein did hide  
Meet meanings for that lovesome day;  
What singing of the bridal lay  
By a fair, soft-voiced trembling maid,  
Like to the Goddess well arrayed,  
Who, dreaded once, was grown to be  
A pageant-maker's imagery?  
Why make long words of that sweet band  
Who scattered flowers from slender hand,  
And brought the garlands forth? How tell  
What music on the feasters fell,  
So sweet and solemn, that from mirth  
O’erstrained well-nigh must tears have birth?—  
Nay, let all pass, and deem indeed  
That every joyance was their meed  
Wherewith men cheat themselves to think  
That they of endless joy may drink;  
That every sense in turn must bear  
Of o’er-sweet pleasure its full share,  
Till for awhile the very best  
They next might gain seemed utter rest,  
And of some freshness were they fain.  
So then the garden did they gain,  
And wandered there by twos and threes  
Amidst the flowers, or ’neath the trees,  
Sat, keeping troublous thoughts at bay. <span id="page_188">p.
188</span>  
   So fared they through the earlier day;  
But when the sun did now decline,  
And men grew graver for the wine  
That erst such noble tales had told;  
And maids no more were free and bold,  
But reddened at the words half-said,  
While round about the rebecks played;  
Then needs must the feastmasters strive  
Too pensive thoughts away to drive,  
And make the sun go down with mirth  
At least upon that spot of earth;  
So did the minstrel men come in,  
And tale-tellers the lay begin,  
And men by fabled woes were stirred,  
Or smiling their own follies heard  
Told of some other; and withal  
Here did the dice on table fall,  
Here stout in arms the chess-king stood;  
There young men stirred their sluggish blood  
With clattering sword and buckler play,  
There others on the daisies lay  
Above the moat, and watched their quill  
Make circles in the water still,  
Or laughed to see the damsel hold  
Her dainty skirt enwrought with gold  
Back from the flapping tench's tail,  
Or to his close-set dusky mail  
With gentle force brought laughingly  
The shrinking finger-tip anigh. <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

   Midst these abode a little knot  
Of youths and maidens, on a spot  
Fenced by a cloister of delight,  
Well wrought of marble green and white;  
Wherein upon a wall of gold  
Of Tristram was the story told,  
Well done by cunning hands that knew  
What form to man and beast was due;  
Midmost, upon a space of green,  
Half shaded from the summer sheen,  
Half with the afternoon sun thrown  
Upon its daisies glittering strewn,  
Was gathered that fair company  
Wherewith the bridegroom chanced to be,  
Who through the cloister door must gaze  
From time to time ’thwart the sun's blaze  
On to a shaded space of grass  
Whereon his new-wed maiden was,  
Hearkening in seeming to a song  
That told of some past love and wrong;  
But as he strained his ear to catch  
Across the wind some louder snatch  
Of the sweet tune, new-coming folk  
The sweet sight hid, the music broke;  
Of these one maiden trimly girt  
Bore in her gleaming upheld skirt  
Fair silken balls sewed round with gold;  
Which when the others did behold  
Men cast their mantles unto earth, <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>  
And maids within their raiments’ girth  
Drew up their gown-skirts, loosening here  
Some button on their bosoms clear  
Or slender wrists, there making tight  
The laces round their ankles light;  
For folk were wont within that land  
To cast the ball from hand to hand,  
Dancing meanwhile full orderly;  
So now the bridegroom with a sigh,  
Struggling with love's quick-gathering yoke,  
Turned round unto that joyous folk,  
And gat him ready for the play.

   Lovely to look on was the sway  
Of the slim maidens ’neath the ball  
As they swung back to note its fall  
With dainty balanced feet; and fair  
The bright outflowing golden hair,  
As swiftly, yet in measured wise  
One maid ran forth to gain the prize;  
Eyes glittered and young cheeks glowed bright,  
And gold-shod foot, round limb and light,  
Gleamed from beneath the girded gown  
That, unrebuked, untouched, was thrown  
Hither and thither by the breeze;  
Shrill, laughter smote the thick-leaved trees,  
Familiar names clear voices cried,  
Sweet sound rose up as sweet sound died,  
And still the circle spread and spread, <span id="page_191">p.
191</span>  
As folk to all that goodlihead  
Kept thronging in, till they must stay  
A little while the eager play,  
And now, for very breathlessness,  
With rest the trodden daisies bless.  
So now against the wall some leaned,  
Some from amidst the daisies gleaned  
The yellow trefoil, and the blue  
Faint speedwell in the shade that grew;  
Some panting sat and clasped their knees  
With faces turned unto the breeze,  
And midst them the new-corners stood,  
With hair smooth yet and unstirred blood.

   Laurence, the bridegroom, as the game  
Unto this tide of resting came,  
Turned idle eyes about, and met  
An image in the grey wall set,  
A thing he knew from early days:  
There in a gilded carven place  
Queen Venus’ semblance stood, more fair  
Than women whom that day did bear,  
And yet a marvel for the life  
Wherewith its brazen limbs were rife.  
Not in that country was she wrought,  
Or in those days; she had been brought  
From a fair city far away,  
Ruined e’en then for many a day;  
Full many a tale had there been told <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>  
Of him who once that Queen did mould,  
And all of these were strange to hear,  
And dreadful some, and full of fear.  
And now as Laurence gazed upon  
That beauty, in the old days won  
He knew not from what pain and toil,  
Vague fear new-risen-up seemed to spoil  
The summer joy; her loveliness  
That hearts, long dead now, once did bless,  
Grown dangerous, ’gan to lead his mind  
On through a troublous maze and blind  
Of unnamed thoughts, and silently,  
With knitted brow, he drew anigh,  
And midst the babbling close did gaze  
Into the marvel of her face:  
Till, with a sudden start, at last  
His straying thoughts he seemed to cast  
Aside, and laughed aloud, and said:

   "O cold and brazen goodlihead,  
How lookest thou on those that live?  
Thou who, tales say, wert wont to strive  
On earth, in heaven, and ’neath the earth,  
To wrap all in thy net of mirth,  
And drag them down to misery  
Past telling—and didst thou know why?—  
And what has God done with thee then,  
That thou art perished from midst men  
E’en as the things thou didst destroy, <span id="page_193">p.
193</span>  
Thy Paris and thy town of Troy,  
And many a man and maid and town?  
How is thy glory fallen adown,  
That I, even I, must sigh for thee!"

   So spake he, as the minstrelsy  
Struck up once more a joyous strain,  
And called them to the play again;  
And therewithal he looked about,  
In answer to the merry shout  
That called on him by name to turn.  
But even therewith the sun did burn  
Upon his new-gained spousal-ring—  
A wondrous work, a priceless thing,  
Whereon, ’neath mulberries white and red,  
And green leaves, lay fair Thisbe dead  
By her dead love; the low sun's blaze  
It caught now, and he fell to gaze  
Thereon, and said at last:  
                           "Perchance  
The ball might break it in the dance,  
And that an ugly omen were;  
Nay, one to ward it well is here.  
Thou, Goddess, that heardst Thisbe's vow,  
From blind eyes gaze upon her now  
Till I return mine own to claim;  
And as thou mayst, bear thou the shame  
Of being the handmaid to my love;  
Full sure I am thou wilt not move." <span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

   Know that this image there did stand  
With arm put forth and open hand,  
As erst on Ida triumphing;  
And now did Laurence set the ring  
On the fourth finger fair and straight,  
And laughing, "Thou mayst bear the weight,"  
Turned back again unto the play.

   To him slow passed the time away;  
But when at last in purple shade  
’Twixt wall and wall the grass was laid,  
And he grew gladder therewithal,  
Then weariness on folk ’gan fall;  
The fifes left off their dancing tune,  
And sang of lovers fain of June,  
And thence that company ’gan go  
By twos and threes with footsteps slow,  
Pensive at end of mirthful day;  
But from them Laurence turned away  
Unto the carven dame, to take  
The ring he wore for true-love's sake;—  
Daylight it was, though broad and red  
The sun was grown, and shadows led  
Eastward with long lines o’er the grass—  
—Daylight, but what had come to pass?

   Nearby those voices still he heard  
In laugh and talk and careless word;  
Upon his cheek the wind blew cold;  
His own fair house he did behold <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>  
Changed nowise; from the little close  
The scent of trodden grass arose—  
How could it be a dream?—Yet there  
She stood, the moveless image fair,  
The little-noticed, oft-seen thing,  
With hand fast closed upon his ring.

   At first, in agony and haste,  
A frantic minute did he waste  
In pulling at the brazen hand,  
That was as firm as rocks that stand  
The day-long beating of the sea;  
Then did he reel back dizzily,  
And gaze at sky and earth and trees  
Once more, as asking words from these  
To ravel out his tale for him.  
But now as they were waxing dim  
Before his eyes, he heard his name  
Called out, and therewith fear of shame  
Brought back his heart and made him man.  
Unto his fellows, pale and wan,  
He turned, who, when they saw him so,  
What thing might ail him fain would know,  
For wild and strange he looked indeed;  
Then stammered he, "Nay, nought I need  
But wine, in sooth: John, mind’st thou not  
How on the steaming shore and hot  
Of Serendib a sting I gat  
From some unseen worm, as we sat <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>  
Feasting one eve? Well, the black folk  
E’en saved my life from that ill stroke,  
By leech-craft; yet they told me then  
I oft should feel that wound again,  
Till I had fifty years or more:  
This is a memory of that shore;  
A thing to be right soon forgot."  
And to himself, "If this is not  
An empty dream, a cutting file  
My ring therefrom shall soon beguile,  
When, at the ending of the day,  
These wearying guests have gone away."

   Now unto supper all folk turned,  
And ’neath the torches red gold burned,  
And the best pageants of the day  
Swept through the hall and said their say,  
Departing e’en as men's lives go:  
But though to Laurence slow and slow  
Those hours must needs seem, none the less  
He gave himself to mirthfulness,  
At least in seeming; till at last  
All guests from out the palace passed.  
And now the short soft summer night  
Was left at peace for their delight;  
But Laurence, muffled up and hid,  
Shrinking, betwixt his servants slid,  
For now he had a little space  
To come unto that mystic place, <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>  
Where still his ring he thought to see.  
A file and chisel now had he,  
And weighty hammer; yet withal  
As he drew toward the cloister-wall,  
Well-nigh he called himself a fool,  
To go with cloak and blacksmith's tool,  
And lay hard blows upon a dream;  
For now in sooth he nigh must deem  
His eyes had mocked him; reaching soon  
That cloister by the broad high moon  
He hurried through the door, and heard  
All round the sound of June's brown bird  
Above the voices of the night;  
Trembling, he sprang into the light  
Through the black arches of the place,  
And stealing on stood face to face  
With the old smiling image there,  
And lowered to her fingers fair  
His troubled, wild, and shrinking eyes,  
And stretched his hand out to the prize:—  
His eyes, his hand, were there in vain.

   Once more, as sure of coming gain,  
As erst in Ida she did stand,  
So stood she now; her open hand,  
That late he saw closed round the ring,  
Empty and bare of anything:  
Gaping awhile he stood, for fear  
Now made him think a voice to hear, <span id="page_198">p. 198</span>  
And see her change soon, and depart  
From out her midst; but gathering heart,  
He muttered, "Yet, what have I seen?  
Should it not even thus have been,  
If the closed hand was but a dream?  
Of some guest worser must I deem;  
Go, fool; thine own love waiteth thee."  
Therewith he went, yet fearfully  
Looked o’er his shoulder on the way,  
And terror on his heart still lay.

   Yet to his chamber at the last  
He came, and to the floor he cast  
His wrapping mantle, and alone  
He strove to think of all things done,  
And strove once more to bring again  
The longing sweet, the joy and pain  
That on that morn he called desire;  
For wretched fear had dulled that fire:  
And, whereas erewhile he had deemed  
That life was joy, and it had seemed  
A never-ending game to be,  
A fair and rich eternity  
Before him, now was it indeed  
A troublous fight, where he should need  
Help on the left hand and the right,  
Nor yet so ’scape the certain night.

   But mid these thoughts he heard withal  
The chamberlain to pages call, <span id="page_199">p. 199</span>  
To bear the bridal wine to him;  
And as he might he strove to dim  
His anxious thought, and with a smile  
The coming curious eyes beguile.  
They entered now, and whiles that he  
Drank from the gold cup feverishly,  
The minstrels, ere his draught was done,  
Struck up *The King of England's Son*,  
And soon amid that ordered word  
The lessening sound of feet he heard,  
And then the song itself must die.  
But from the bridechamber nearby  
Now for a space rose clear and sweet  
The damsels’ song, *Fair Marguerite;*  
And when that ended all was still,  
And he with strained, divided will,  
Trembling with love, yet pale with fear,  
To the bridechamber door drew near,  
Muttering some well-remembered charm  
That erst had kept his soul from harm.  
Yet misty seemed the place; the wall—  
Its woven waters seemed to fall,  
Its trees, its beasts, its loom-wrought folk,  
Now seemed indeed as though they woke,  
And moved unto him as he went.  
The room seemed full of some strange scent;  
And strains of wicked songs he heard,  
And half-said God-denying word:  
He reeled, and cried aloud, and strove <span id="page_200">p.
200</span>  
To gain the door that hid his love;  
It seemed to him that, were he there,  
All would again be calm and fair.  
But in the way before his eyes  
A cloudy column seemed to rise,  
Cold, odorous, impalpable,  
And a voice cried, "*I love thee well,  
And thou hast loved me ere to-night,  
And longed for this o’ergreat delight,  
And had no words therefor to pray.  
Come, have thy will, and cast away  
Thy foolish fear, thy foolish love,  
Since me at least thou canst not move,  
Now thou with ring hast wedded me:  
Come, cast the hope away from thee  
Wherewith unhappy brooding men  
Must mock their threescore years and ten;  
Come, thou that mockest me, I live!  
How with my beauty canst thou strive?  
Unhappy if thou couldst! for see  
What depth of joy there is in me!*"

   Then round about him closed the mist;  
It was as though his lips were kissed,  
His body by soft arms embraced,  
His fingers lovingly enlaced  
By other fingers; until he  
Midst darkness his own ring did see.

   Nought else awhile; then back there came <span id="page_201">p.
201</span>  
New vision: as amidst white flame,  
The flower-girt goddess wavered there,  
Nor knew he now where they twain were,  
Midst wild desire that nigh did rend  
His changed heart; then there came an end  
Of all that light and ecstasy;  
His soul grew blind, his eyes could see;  
And, moaning from an empty heart,  
He saw the hangings blown apart  
By the night wind, the lights flare red  
In the white light the high moon shed  
O’er all the place he knew so well,  
And senseless on the floor he fell.

 

 

AH, what a night to what a morn!  
Ah, what a morrow black with scorn,  
And hapless end of happy love!  
What shame his helpless shame to prove!  
For who, indeed, alone could bear  
The dreadful shame, the shameful fear,  
Of such a bridal? Think withal,  
More trusted such a tale would fall  
Upon those folks' ears than on most,  
Who, as I said erst, saw a host  
Of wild things lurking in the night;  
To whom was magic much as right  
As prayers or holy psalmody. <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

   So nothing else it seemed might be,  
When Laurence for three nights had striven  
To gain the fair maid to him given,  
But that her sire should know the thing  
And help him with his counselling.  
So, weary, wasted with his shame,  
Unto his house the bridegroom came,  
And when the twain were left alone  
He told him how the thing had gone.  
The old man doubted not the sooth  
Of what he said, but, touched with ruth,  
Yet spent no time in mourning vain.

   "Son," said he, "idle were the pain  
To seek if thou some deed hast wrought  
Which on thine head this grief hath brought—  
Some curse for which this doth atone,  
Some laugh whereby is honour gone  
From the dread powers unnameable:  
Rather, who now can help thee well?"

   "Small heed, my father," Laurence said,  
"Gave I to such things, and small dread  
To anything I could not see,  
But it were God who fashioned me:  
From witch-wives have I bought ere now  
Wind-bags indeed, but yet did trow  
Nothing therein, but dealt with these  
My shipmen's clamour to appease." <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

   "Well," said he, "that perchance is worse  
For thee, yea, may have gained this curse.  
But come, I know a certain man  
Who in these things great marvels can,  
And something of an age are we,  
Yoke-fellows in astronomy—  
 A many years agone, alas!"

   So therewithal the twain did pass  
Toward the great church, and entered there,  
And, going ’twixt the pillars fair,  
Came to a chapel, where a priest  
Made ready now the Holy Feast:  
"Hist," said the old man, "there he is;  
May he find healing for all this!  
Kneel down, and note him not too much,  
No easy man he is to touch."

   So down upon the floor of stone  
They knelt, until the mass was done,  
Midst peasant folk, and sailors’ wives,  
Sore careful for their husbands’ lives;  
But when the mass was fully o’er  
They made good haste unto the door  
That led unto the sacristy:  
And there a ring right fair to see  
The old man to a verger gave  
In token, praying much to have  
With Dan Palumbus speech awhile:  
The verger took it with a smile, <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>  
As one who says, 'Ye ask in vain;'  
But presently he came again,  
And said, "Fair sir, come hither then,  
The priest will see you of all men!"

   With eyes made grave by their intent  
From out the lordly church they went  
Into the precinct, and withal  
They passed along the minster wall,  
And heard amid the buttresses  
The grey hawks chatter to the breeze,  
The sanctus bell run down the wind;  
Until the priest's house did they find,  
Built ’neath the belfry huge and high,  
Fluttered about perpetually  
By chattering daws, and shaken well  
From roof to pavement, when the bell  
Flung out its sound o’er night or day.

   "Sirs, Dan Palumbus takes his way  
E’en now from out the sacristy,"  
The verger said, "sirs, well be ye!  
For time it is that I were gone."  
Therewith he left the twain alone  
Beside the door, and, sooth to say,  
In haste he seemed to get away  
As one afeard; but they bode there,  
And round about the house did peer,  
But found nought dreadful: small it was,  
Set on a tiny plot of grass, <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
And on each side the door a bay  
Brushed ’gainst the oak porch rent and grey;  
A yard-wide garden ran along  
The wall, by ancient box fenced strong;  
And in the corner, where it met  
The belfry, was a great yew set,  
Where sat the blackbird-hen in spring,  
Hearkening her bright-billed husband sing.  
A peaceful place it should have been  
For one who of the world had seen  
O’er much, and quiet watch would keep  
Over his soul awaiting sleep.

   But now they heard the priest draw nigh,  
And saw him and his shadow high  
Wind round the wind-worn buttresses;  
So coming by the last of these  
He met them face to face: right tall  
He was; his straight black hair did fall  
About his shoulders; strong he seemed,  
His eyes look far off, as he dreamed  
Of other things than what they saw;  
Strange lines his thin pale face did draw  
Into a set wild look of pain  
And terror. As he met the twain  
He greeted well his ancient friend,  
And prayed them within doors to wend.  
Small was his chamber; books were there  
Right many, and in seeming fair. <span id="page_206">p. 206</span>  
But who knows what therein might be  
’Twixt board and board of oaken tree?

   Palumbus bade them sit, and sat,  
And talked apace of this and that,  
Nor heeded that the youth spake wild,  
Nor that his old friend coughed and smiled,  
As ill at ease, while the priest spake,  
Then from his cloak a purse did take,  
And at the last pushed in his word  
Edgewise, as ’twere. Palumbus heard  
As one who fain had been born deaf,  
Then rose and cried, "Thou fill’st the sheaf,  
Thou fill’st the sheaf! this is my doom,  
Well may the sexton make my tomb!"  
And up and down he walked, muttering,  
’Twixt closed teeth, many a nameless thing.

   At last he stopped and said, "O ye,  
I knew that ye would come to me,  
And offer me great store of gold:  
Full often good help have I sold,  
And thus this tide should I have done;  
But on this mountain of grey stone  
I stood last night, and in my art  
I dealt; and terror filled my heart,  
And hope, and great uncertainty;  
Therefore I deem that I shall die;  
For cool and bold erst have I been, <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>  
Whatever I have heard and seen;  
But the old Master of my fear  
Seems afar now, and God grown near;  
And soon I look to see his face.  
Therefore, if but for a short space,  
Would I be on his side, and do  
A good deed; all the more for you;  
Since thou art part of sweet days, friend,  
That once we deemed would never end;  
And in thine eyes meseems, O youth,  
Kindness I see and hope and truth;  
And thou and he may speak a word  
For me unto my master's Lord:—  
Well, I must reap that I did sow—  
But take your gold again and go:  
And thou for six days fast and pray,  
And come here on the seventh day  
About nightfall; then shalt thou learn  
In what way doth the matter turn,  
And fully know of time and place,  
And be well armed thy foe to face."

   So homeward doubtful went the twain,  
And Laurence spent in fear and pain  
The six long days; and so at last,  
When the seventh sun was well-nigh past,  
Came to that dark man's fair abode;  
The grey tower with the sunset glowed,  
The daws wheeled black against the sky <span id="page_208">p.
208</span>  
About the belfry windows high,  
Or here and there one sank adown  
The dizzy shaft of panelled stone;  
And sound of children nigh the close  
Was mingled with the cries of those;  
And e’en as Laurence laid his hand  
Upon the latch, and there did stand  
Lingering a space, most startling clear  
The sweet chime filled the evening air.  
He entered mid the great bell's drone,  
And found Palumbus all alone  
Mid books laid open:  
                       "Rest," said he;  
"Time presses not for thee or me:  
Surely shall I die soon enow."  
Silent, with hands laid to his brow,  
He sat then, nor did Laurence speak,  
Fearing perchance some spell to break:  
At last the priest caught up a book,  
And from its leaves a letter took,  
And unknown words there were on it  
For superscription duly writ,  
And sealed it was in solemn wise.  
He said:  
          "Thou knowest where there lies  
Five leagues hence, or a little less,  
North of the town, a sandy ness  
That shipmen call St. Clement's Head;  
South of it dreary land and dead <span id="page_209">p. 209</span>  
Lies stretched now, and the sea bears o’er  
Ruin of shingle evermore,  
And saps the headland year by year,  
And long have husbandmen had fear  
Of its short-lived and treacherous soil,  
And left it free from any toil.  
There, with thy face turned toward the rand,  
At the hill's foot take thou thy stand,  
Just where the turf the shingle meets,  
Wherewith the sea the marshland eats;  
But seaward if thy face thou turn,  
What I have learned then shalt thou learn  
With like reward—watch carefully  
And well, and a strange company  
Shall pass thee as thou standest there,  
And heed thee not—some foul some fair,  
Some glad some sorry; rule thy heart,  
And heed them nothing for thy part,  
Till at the end of all thou seest  
A great lord on a marvellous beast  
Unnameable; on him cry out,  
And he thereon shall turn about  
And ask thy need; have thou no fear,  
But give him what I give thee here,  
And let him read, and thou shalt win  
Thine happiness, and have no sin.  
But as for me, be witness thou  
That in the scroll I give thee now,  
My death lies, and I know it well, <span id="page_210">p. 210</span>  
And cry to God against his hell."

   In languid voice he spake as one,  
Who knows the task that must be done,  
And how each word from him should fall,  
And gives no heed to it at all;  
But here he stopped a little space,  
And once more covered up his face;  
But soon began his speech again  
In a soft voice, and freed from pain:

   "And for the folk that thou shalt see,  
Whence cometh all that company,—  
Marvel thou not thereat, for know  
That this is sure; long years ago,  
Leagues seaward of that barren place,  
The temple of a glorious race,  
Built with far mightier walls than these,  
Stood fair midst groves of whispering trees.  
Thence come these folk remembering  
Their glory once so great a thing—  
I have said: 'Could they be once more  
As they have been,—but all is o’er,  
What matters what is, what has been,  
And what shall be, when I have seen  
The last few hours of my last day?-  
Depart.—Ah me, to cast away  
Such power as I on earth have had!  
I who could make the lover glad  
Above his love's dead face,—at least <span id="page_211">p. 211</span>  
A little while—now has all ceased  
With that small scrap of black and white:  
Think of me, God, midst thy delight,  
And save me! yea, or do thy will!  
For thou too hast beheld my skill."

   The scroll did Laurence hold in hand,  
And silent he a space did stand,  
Gazing upon Palumbus, who  
Sat open-eyed, as though he knew  
Nought of what things were round about;  
So, stealthily, and in great doubt  
Of strange things yet to come to pass,  
Did Laurence gain the darkening grass,  
And through the precinct and the town  
He passed, and reached the foreshores brown,  
And gathered heart, and as he might  
Went boldly forward through the night.  
At first on his left hand uprose  
Great cliffs and sheer, and, rent from those,  
Boulders strewn thick across the strand,  
Made weary work for foot and hand;  
But well he knew the path indeed,  
And scarce of such light had he need  
As still the summer eve might shed  
From the high stars or sunset dead.  
Soft was the lovely time and fair,  
A little sea-wind raised his hair,  
That seemed as though from heaven it blew. <span id="page_212">p.
212</span>  
All sordid thoughts the sweet time slew,  
And gave good hope such welcoming,  
That presently he ’gan to sing,  
Though still amid the quiet night  
He could not hear his song aright  
For the grave thunder of the sea  
That smote the beach so musically,  
And in the dim light seemed so soft  
As each great wave was raised aloft  
To fall in foam, you might have deemed  
That waste of ocean was but dreamed,  
And that the surf's strong music was  
By some unknown thing brought to pass;  
And Laurence, singing as he went,  
As in some lower firmament,  
Beneath the line that marked where met  
The world's roof and the highway wet,  
Could see a ship's light gleam afar  
Scarce otherwise than as a star,  
While o’erhead fields of thin white cloud  
The more part of the stars did shroud.

   So on he went, and here and there  
A few rough fisher-caries there were,  
Launching their ordered keels to sea  
Eager to gain, if it might be,  
The harbour-mouth with morning-light,  
Or else some bird that flies by night  
Wheeled round about with his harsh cry; <span id="page_213">p.
213</span>  
Or as the cliffs sank he could spy  
Afar some homestead glittering  
With high feast or some other thing.  
Such gleams of fellowship had he  
At first along the unquiet sea,  
But when a long way off the town  
The cliffs were wholly sunken down,  
And on the marshland's edge he went,  
For all sounds then the night-jar sent  
Its melancholy laugh across  
The sea-wind moaning for the loss  
Of long-drowned lands, that in old time  
Were known for great in many a clime.

   But the moon rose, and ’neath its light,  
Cloud-barred, the wide wastes came in sight,  
With gleaming, sand-choked, reed-clad pools,  
And marsh-lights for the mock of fools;  
And o’er the waste beneath the moon  
The sea-wind piped a dreary tune,  
And louder grew, and the world then  
No more seemed made for sons of men,  
And summer seemed an empty name,  
And harvest-time a mock and shame:  
Such hopeless ruin seemed settled there,  
On acres sunny once and fair.

   But Laurence now could well behold  
The sandy headland bare and bold <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>  
Against the sea, and stayed his feet  
Awhile, to think how he should meet  
These nameless things, his enemies,  
The lords of terror and disease;  
Then trembling, hastened on, for thought  
Full many an image to him brought,  
Once seen, with loathing cast aside,  
But ready e’en for such a tide,  
Come back with longing's added sting,  
And whatso horrors time could bring.  
   Now thrusting all these thoughts apart  
He hastened on with hardy heart,  
Till on the doubtful place he stood  
Where the sea sucked the pasture's blood,  
And with back turned unto the sea  
He strove to think right strenuously  
Of this and that well-liking place;  
The merry clamour of the chase,  
Pageant of soldier or of priest,  
Or market-place or crowded feast,  
Or splintered spears for ladies' sake,  
Until he ’gan to dream awake:  
Then, midst of all his striving, still  
His happiest thoughts must turn to ill,  
As in a fevered, restless dream.  
He thought about some flowery stream,  
Himself in gilded boat thereon—  
A livid cloud came o’er the sun,  
A great wave swept from bank to bank; <span id="page_215">p.
215</span>  
Or flower-crowned amid friends he drank,  
And as he raised the red wine up  
Fell poison shrieked from out the cup;  
The garland when his heart was full  
He set upon a fleshless skull;  
The lute turned to a funeral bell,  
The golden door led down to hell.  
Then back from dreams his soul he brought,  
And of his own ill matters thought,  
And found his fear the lesser grew  
When all his heart therein he threw.

   Yet awful was the time indeed,  
And of good heart sore had he need:  
The wind's moan louder than before,  
Some wave cast higher up the shore,  
The night-bird's brushing past his head,—  
All little things grew full of dread;  
Yet did he waver nought at all,  
Or turn, for whatso thing might fall.

   The moon was growing higher now,  
The east wind had been strong to blow  
The night sky clear from vexing cloud,  
And in the west his flock did crowd;  
Sharper things grew beneath the light,  
As with a false dawn; thin and bright  
The horned poppies’ blossoms shone  
Upon a shingle-bank, thrust on <span id="page_216">p. 216</span>  
By the high tide to choke the grass;  
And nigh it the sea-holly was,  
Whose cold grey leaves and stiff stark shade  
On earth a double moonlight made:  
Above him, specked with thorn and whin,  
And clad with short grey grass and thin,  
The hill ran up, and Laurence knew  
That down the other slope there grew  
A dark pine-wood, whose added sound  
Scarce noted, yet did more confound,  
With changing note, his wearied mind.

   But now with drowsiness grown blind,  
Once more he tottered on his place,  
And let fall down his weary face;  
But then remembering all his part,  
Once and again woke with a start,  
And dozed again; and then at last,  
Shuddering, all slumber from him cast,  
Yet scarce knew if he lived or no:  
For by his scared wild eyes did go  
A wondrous pageant, noiselessly,  
Although so close it passed him by;  
The fluttering raiment by him brushed,  
As through its folds the sea-wind rushed.

   By then his eyes were opened wide.  
Already up the grey hill-side  
The backs of two were turned to him: <span id="page_217">p. 217</span>  
One like a young man tall and slim,  
Whose heels with rosy wings were dight;  
One like a woman clad in white,  
With glittering wings of many a hue,  
Still changing, and whose shape none knew.  
In aftertime would Laurence say,  
That though the moonshine, cold and grey,  
Flooded the lonely earth that night,  
These creatures in the moon's despite  
Were coloured clear, as though the sun  
Shone through the earth to light each one,  
And terrible was that to see.

   But while he stood, and shudderingly  
Still gazed on those departing twain,  
Yet ’gan to gather heart again,  
A noise like echoes of a shout  
Seemed in the cold air all about,  
And therewithal came faint and thin  
What seemed a far-off battle's din,  
And on a sight most terrible  
His eyes in that same minute fell,—  
The images of slaughtered men,  
With set eyes and wide wounds, as when  
Upon the field they first lay slain;  
And those who there had been their bane  
With open mouths as if to shout,  
And frightful eyes of rage and doubt,  
And hate that never more should die. <span id="page_218">p. 218</span>  
Then went the shivering fleers by,  
With death's fear ever in their eyes;  
And then the heaped-up fatal prize,  
The blood-stained coin, the unset gem,  
The gold robe torn from hem to hem,  
The headless, shattered golden God,  
The dead priest's crushed divining-rod;  
The captives, weak from blow and wound,  
Toiling along; the maiden, bound  
And helpless, in her raiment torn;  
The ancient man's last day forlorn:  
Onward they pressed, and though no sound  
Their footfalls made upon the ground,  
Most real indeed they seemed to be.  
The spilt blood savoured horribly,  
Heart-breaking the dumb writhings were,  
Unuttered curses filled the air;  
Yea, as the wretched band went past,  
A dreadful look one woman cast  
On Laurence, and upon his breast  
A wounded blood-stained hand she pressed.

   But on the heels of these there came  
A King, that through the night did flame,  
For something more than steel or brass  
The matter of his armour was;  
Its fashion strange past words to say;  
Who knows where first it saw the day?  
On a red horse he rode; his face <span id="page_219">p. 219</span>  
Gave no more hope of any grace  
Than through the blackness of the night  
The swift-descending lightning might;  
And yet therein great joy indeed  
The brightness of his eyes did feed;;—  
A joy as of the leaping fire  
Over the house-roof rising higher  
To greet the noon-sun, when the glaive  
Forbids all folk to help or save.

   Yet harmless this one passed him by,  
And through the air deliciously  
Faint pensive music breathed, and then  
There came a throng of maids and men—  
A young and fair and gentle band;  
Whereof some passed him hand in hand,  
Some side by side not touching walked,  
As though of happy things they talked;  
Noiseless they were like all the rest  
As past him up the hill they pressed;  
Yet she who brushed by him most close  
Cast to his feet a fresh red rose.

   Then somewhat of a space there was  
Before the next band ’gan to pass,  
So faint they moved for very woe;  
And these were men and maids also,  
And young were most, and most were fair;  
And hand in hand some few went there,  
And still were fain with love to see <span id="page_220">p. 220</span>  
Each other's bitter misery;  
But most, just sundered, went along,  
With faces drawn by hidden wrong,  
Clenched hands and muttering lips that cursed  
From brooding hearts their sin that nursed.  
And she that went the last of all,  
Black-robed, in passing by let fall  
At Laurence's feet a black-bound wreath  
Of bitter herbs long come to death.

   Alone, afoot, when these were gone,  
A bright one came, whose garments shone  
In wondrous wise; a bow he bore,  
And deadly feathered shafts' good store;  
Winged was he and most Godlike fair;  
Slowly he went, and oft would stare  
With eyes distraught down on the grass,  
As waiting what might come to pass;  
Then whiles would he look up again,  
And set his teeth as if with pain;  
And whiles for very joy of heart  
His eyes would gleam, his lips would part  
With such a smile as though the earth  
Were newly made to give him mirth;  
Back o’er his shoulder would he gaze  
Seaward, or through the marshland haze  
That lay before, strain long and hard,  
Till fast the tears fell on the sward:—  
So towards the hill's brow wandered he. <span id="page_221">p.
221</span>

   Then through the moaning of the sea  
There came a faint and thrilling strain,  
Till Laurence strove with tears in vain,  
I And his flesh trembled, part with fear,  
Part as with some great pleasure near,  
And then his dazzled eyes could see  
Once more a noiseless company;  
And his heart failed him at the sight,  
And he forgot both wrong and right,  
And nothing thought of his intent;  
For close before him now there went  
Fair women clad in ancient guise  
That hid but little from his eyes  
More loveliness than earth doth hold  
Now, when her bones are growing old;  
But all too swift they went by him,  
And fluttering gown and ivory limb  
Went twinkling up the bare hill-side,  
And lonely there must he abide.

   Then seaward had he nigh turned round,  
And thus the end of life had found,  
When even before his wildered sight  
There glided forth a figure white,  
And passed him by afoot, alone;  
No raiment on her sweet limbs shone,  
Only the tresses of her hair  
The wind drove round her body fair;  
No sandals were there on her feet, <span id="page_222">p. 222</span>  
But still before them blossoms sweet  
Unnamed, unknown within that land,  
Sprang up; she held aloft her hand  
As to the trembling man she turned  
Her glorious eyes, and on it burned  
The dreadful pledge, the looked-for thing,  
The well-wrought, lovely spousal ring.

   Then Laurence trembled more and more;  
Huge longing his faint heart swept o’er,  
As one who would a boon beseech.  
His fevered hand forth did he reach,  
And then she stayed and gazed at him,  
Just moving lightly each fair limb  
As one who loiters, but must go;  
But even as the twain stood so,  
She saying nought, he saying nought,  
And who knows what wild wave of thought  
Beating betwixt them, from his girth  
The dread scroll loosened fell to earth,  
And to his ears where sounds waxed dim  
Louder its rustle seemed to him  
Than loudest thunder; down he bent,  
Remembering now his good intent,  
And got the scroll within his hand;  
And when mid prayers he came to stand  
Upright again, then was she gone,  
And he once more was left alone. <span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

   Foredone, bewildered, downcast now,  
Confused clamour heard he grow,  
And then swept onward through the night  
A babbling crowd in raiment bright,  
Wherein none listened aught at all  
To what from other lips might fall,  
And none might meet his fellow's gaze;  
And still o’er every restless face  
Passed restless shades of rage and pain,  
And sickening fear and longing vain.  
On wound that manifold agony  
Unholpen, vile, till earth and sea  
Grew silent, till the moonlight died  
Before a false light blaring wide,  
And from amidst that fearful folk  
The Lord of all the pageant broke.

   Most like a mighty king was he,  
And crowned and sceptered royally;  
As a white flame his visage shone,  
Sharp, clear-cut as a face of stone;  
But flickering flame, not flesh, it was;  
And over it such looks did pass  
Of wild desire, and pain, and fear,  
As in his people's faces were,  
But tenfold fiercer: furthermore,  
A wondrous steed the Master bore,  
Unnameable of kind or make,  
Not horse, nor hippogriff, nor drake. <span id="page_224">p.
224</span>  
Like and unlike to all of these,  
And flickering like the semblances  
Of an ill dream, wrought as in scorn  
Of sunny noon, fresh eve, and morn,  
That feed the fair things of the earth.  
And now brake out a mock of mirth  
From all that host, and all their eyes  
Were turned on Laurence in strange wise,  
Who met the maddening fear that burned  
Round his unholpen heart, and turned  
Unto the dreadful king and cried:  
"What errand go ye on? Abide,  
Abide! for I have tarried long;  
Turn thou to me, and right my wrong!  
One of thy servants keeps from me  
That which I gave her not; nay, see  
What thing thy Master bids thee do!"

   Then wearily, as though he knew  
How all should be, the Master turned,  
And his red eyes on Laurence burned,  
As without word the scroll he took;  
But as he touched the skin he shook  
As though for fear, and presently  
In a great voice he ’gan to cry:  
"Shall this endure for ever, Lord?  
Hast thou no care to keep thy word?  
And must such double men abide?  
Not mine, not mine, nor on thy side? <span id="page_225">p. 225</span>  
For as thou cursest them I curse:—  
Make thy souls better, Lord, or worse!"

   Then spake he to the trembling man,  
"What I am bidden, that I can;  
Bide here, and thou shalt see thine own  
Unto thy very feet cast down;  
Then go and dwell in peace awhile."  
Then round he turned with sneering smile,  
And once more lonely was the night,  
And colourless with grey moonlight.

   But soon indeed the dawn drew near,  
As Laurence stood ’twixt hope and fear,  
Still doubting, now that all was gone,  
If his own heart the thing had done,  
Though on his coat the blood-mark was,  
Though rose and wreath lay on the grass;  
So long he waited wearily,  
Until, when dawn ’gan stripe the sky,  
If he were waking scarce he knew,  
When, as he deemed, a white cloud drew  
Anigh him from the marshland grey,  
Over the empty ghost-trod way,  
And from its midst a voice there' came:  
"*Thou who hast wrought me added shame,  
Take back thine own and go thy ways;  
And think, perchance, in coming days*, <span id="page_226">p.
226</span>  
*When all grows old about thee, how  
From foolish hands thou needs must throw  
A gift of unhoped great delight*."  
It vanished as the east grew bright,  
And in the shadowless still morn  
A sense of rest to him was born,  
And looking down unto his feet,  
His eyes the spousal-ring did meet.  
He caught it up with a glad cry,  
And kissed it over longingly,  
And set it on his hand again;  
And dreamlike now, and vague and vain,  
Seemed all those images of fear,  
The wicked sights that held him there;  
And rather now his eyes could see  
Her that was his now verily.

   Then from that drear unhallowed place  
With merry heart he set his face.  
A light wind o’er the ocean blew,  
And fresh and fair the young day grew;  
The sun rose o’er the green sea's rim,  
And gave new life and joy to him;  
The white birds crying o’er his head  
Seemed praising all his hardihead,  
And laughing at the worsted foe;  
So, joyous, onward did he go,  
And in a little sheltered bay  
His weariness he washed away, <span id="page_227">p. 227</span>  
And made afresh on toward the town:  
He met the fish-wife coming down  
From her red cottage to the strand,  
The fisher-children hand in hand  
Over some wonder washed ashore;  
The old man muttering words of lore  
About the wind that was to be;  
And soon the white sails specked the sea,  
And fisher-keel on fisher-keel  
The furrowed sand again did feel,  
And round them many a barefoot maid  
The burden on her shoulders laid,  
While unto rest the fishers went,  
And grumbling songs from rough throats sent.

   Now all is done, and he at last,  
Weary, but full of joy, has passed  
Over his threshold once again,  
And scarce believed is all the pain  
And all the fear that he has had,  
Now night and day shall make him glad.

   As for Palumbus, tossed about  
His soul might be in dread and doubt,  
In rest at least his body lay  
Ere the great bell struck noon that day.  
And soon a carver did his best  
To make an image of that rest, <span id="page_228">p. 228</span>  
Nor aught of gold did Laurence spare  
To make his tomb both rich and fair;  
And o’er his clasped hands and his head  
Thereafter many a mass was said.

SO when the tale was clean done, with a smile  
The old priest looked around a little while,  
That grew, as young and old ’gan say their say  
On that strange dream of time long past away;  
So listening, with his pleased and thoughtful look  
He ’gan turn o’er the worn leaves of his book,  
Half noting at the first the flowers therein,  
Drawn on the margin of the yellowing skin  
Where chapters ended; or fair images  
Of kings and lords amidst of war and peace  
At books’ beginnings; till within a space  
His eyes grew fixed upon a certain place,  
And he seemed reading. Was it then the name  
Of some old town before his eyes that came,  
And drew his thoughts there? Did he see it now?  
The bridge across the river choked with snow;  
The pillared market-place, not thronged this eve;  
The muffled goodwives making haste to leave  
The gusty minster porch, whose windows shone  
With the firs t-litten candles; while the drone  
Of the great organ shook the leaded panes,  
And the wind moaned about the turret vanes?  
—Nought changed there, and himself so changed mid change,  
That the next land—Death's land—would seem nought strange <span
id="page_230">p. 230</span>  
To his awakening eyes!  
                           Ah! good and ill,  
When will your strife the fated measure fill?  
When will the tangled veil be drawn away,  
And show us all that unimagined day?
