### BELLEROPHON AT ARGOS.

#### ARGUMENT.

HIPPONOÜS, son of Glaucus King of Corinth, unwittingly slew his brother
Beller, and, fleeing from his country, came to Prœtus King of Argos, who
purified him of his guilt; and thereafter was he called Bellerophon. He
dwelt long with Prœtus, well loved by him, and receiving many good
things at his hands; but at last he lost the King's favour by the guile
of the Queen Sthenobœa, and was sent to Jobates King of Lycia, her
father, with a covert message of evil.

PRŒTUS, the King of Argos, on a day  
In tangled forests drave the boar to bay,  
And had good hap, for ere the noon was o’er  
He set his foot upon the third huge boar  
His steel that day had reached; then, fain of rest,  
The greensward ’neath the spreading oak-trees pressed,  
And, king-like, feasted with his folk around.  
Nor lacked he for sweet music's measured sound,  
For when somewhat were men's desires appeased  
Of meat and drink, their weary limbs well eased,  
There ’gan an ancient hunter and his son  
To tell of glorious deeds in old days done  
Within the wood; but as Lyæus’ gift,  
And measured words from common life did lift <span id="page_91">p.
91</span>  
The thoughts of men, and noble each man seemed  
Unto his fellow, from afar there gleamed  
Sun-litten arms, and ’twixt the singer's word  
The slow tramp of a great horse soon they heard,  
And from a glade that pierced the thicket through  
In sight at last a mounted man there drew.  
Then the dogs growled, and midst their weapons' clang  
Unto their feet the outmost hunters sprang,  
Handling their spears; but still King Prœtus lay,  
Till nigh the circle that lone man made stay,  
And with wild eyes gazed down upon the throng.  
Wearied he seemed, and his black war-horse strong  
On many a mile had left both sweat and blood,  
And panting now with drooping head he stood,  
Forgetting all the eager joys of speed;  
And tattered was his rider's lordly weed,  
His broken sheath now held a sword no more,  
With rust his armour bright was spotted o’er,  
Unkempt and matted was the yellow hair  
That crowned his head, nor was there helmet there;  
His face, that should have been as fair and bright  
And ruddy as a maid's, was deadly white,  
And drawn and haggard; and his grey eyes stared,  
As though of something he were sore afeard  
That other folk saw not at all. But now  
A hunter cried out, "Nay, and who art thou?  
What God or man pursues thee? bide and speak;  
Nor yet shalt thou for nought the King's rest break."  
A scared look did the man behind him fling, <span id="page_92">p.
92</span>  
Then said, "Stand close around me: to your King,  
When I may see him, will I tell the tale;  
Unless indeed, meanwhile, my life should fail."

   With that, as one who hath but little might,  
From off his wearied steed did he alight.  
They led him to the King, who ’gainst a tree  
Stood upright now, the new-come man to see;  
Who brought unto him would not meet his eyes,  
But stood and stared distraught in dreamy wise;  
Till cheerily the King of Argos said,  
"Cast somewhat off; O friend, thy drearyhead;  
Sit thee and eat and drink, and be my guest;  
I will not harm thee though thou be unblest;  
Let Gods or men take vengeance as they can,  
Nor ask my help, who dwell a peaceful man  
’Twixt white-walled Argos and the rustling trees."  
   The man turned round, as asking what were these,  
The words he said; then, casting here and there  
A troubled look, as if not safe he were  
From some dread thing that followed even yet,  
He sat him down, and like a starved man ate:  
Yet did he tremble as he took the food,  
And in the cup he gazed, as though the blood  
Of man it held, and not the blood of earth,  
The stirrer up to kindly words and mirth.  
   But when his hunger now was satisfied,  
Casting his hair aback the King he eyed,  
And in a choked and husky voice he said: <span id="page_93">p.
93</span>  
"Now can ye see, O folk, I am not dead;  
But tell me, King, how shall I name thee here,  
Since he in whose heart lieth any prayer,  
To nameless Gods will let no warm words flow?"  
   "To Prœtus pray for what thou wouldest now,"  
The King said; "by the soil of Argos pray:  
To no light matter will I say thee nay,  
For my heart giveth to thee: name thy name,  
And say whereby these evils on thee came."

   With changing eyes now gazed the outcast man  
On Prœtus’ cheery face, and colour ran  
O’er his wan visage. "Thou art kind," he said;  
"But kinder eyes I knew, that on the dead  
Must look for ever now; and joy is gone:  
Best hadst thou cast forth such a luckless one;  
For what I love I slay, and what I hate  
I strive to save from out the hands of Fate.  
Listen and let me babble: I have seen  
Since that hour was, nought but the long leaves green,  
The tree-trunks, and the scared things of the wood."  
   Then silently awhile he seemed to brood  
O’er what had been, but even as the King  
Opened his lips to mind him of the thing  
That he should tell, from his bent head there came  
Slow words, as if from one confessing shame,  
While nigher to his mouth King Prœtus drew.

   "Hipponoüs men have called me, ere I knew  
The hate of Gods and fear of men; my life <span id="page_94">p.
94</span>  
Went past at Corinth free from baneful strife,  
For there my father ruled from sea to sea,  
Glaucus the Great: and fair Eurymede,  
My mother, bare another son to him,  
Like unto me in mind and face and limb,  
Whom men called Beller; and most true it is  
That I with him dwelt long in love and bliss,  
However long ago that seems to be.  
What plans we laid for joyous victory!  
What lovely lands untilled we thought to win,  
And be together even as Gods therein,  
Bringing the monsters of the world to nought!  
How eagerly from elders news we sought  
Of lands that lay anigh the ocean-stream!  
And yet withal what folly then did seem  
Their cold words and their weary hopeless eyes,  
When this alone of all things then seemed wise,  
To know how sweet life was, how dear the earth,  
And only fluttering hope stayed present mirth—  
Ah, how I babble! What a thing man is,  
Who, falling unto misery out of bliss,  
Thinks that new wisdom but the sole thing then  
That binds the many ways of toiling men!

   "In one fair chamber did we sleep a-night,  
I and my brother—there, ’twixt light and light,  
Three nights together did I dream a dream,  
Where lying on my bed I still did seem  
E’en as I was indeed, when a cold hand <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  
Was laid upon me, and a shape did stand  
By my bed-head, a woman clad in grey,  
Like to the lingering time ’twixt night and day,  
And veiled her face was, and her tall gaunt form.  
She drew me from my peaceful bed and warm,  
And led me, shuddering, bare-foot, o’er the floor,  
Until, with beating heart, I stood before  
My brother's bed, and knew what I should do;  
For from beneath her shadowy robe she drew  
A well-steeled feathered dart, and that must I,  
Casting all will aside, clutch mightily,  
And, still unable with her will to strive,  
E’en as her veiled hand pointed, madly drive  
Into the heart of mine own mother's son,  
Striving to scream as that ill deed was done.

   "No cry came forth, but even with the stroke,  
With sick and fainting heart, I nigh awoke.  
And when the dream again o’er me was cast,  
Chamber, and all I knew, away had passed,  
Nor saw I more the ghost: alone I stood  
In a strange land, anigh an oaken wood  
High on a hill; and far below my feet  
The white walls of a glorious town did meet  
A yellow strand and ship-beset green sea;  
And all methought was as a toy for me,  
For I was king thereof and great enow.

   "But as I stood upon that hill's green brow, <span id="page_96">p.
96</span>  
Rejoicing much, yet yearning much indeed  
For something past that still my heart must need,  
Once more was all changed; by the windy sea  
Did men hold games with great solemnity  
In honour of some hero past away,  
Whose body dead upon a huge pile lay  
Waiting the torch, and people far and wide  
About the strand a name I knew not cried,  
Lamenting him who once had been their king;  
But when I saw the face of the dead thing  
Over whose head so many a cry was thrown  
On to the wind, I knew it for mine own.

   "Cold pangs shot through me then, sleep's bonds I broke;  
Shuddering with terror in my bed I woke,  
And when thought came again, a weight of fear  
Lay on my heart and still grew heavier  
But when the next night and the third night came,  
And still in sleep my visions were the same,  
No longer in mine own heart could I hold  
The story of that marvel quite untold,  
For fear possessed me: good at first it seemed  
That I should tell the dream so strangely dreamed  
Unto my brother; then I feared that he  
Might for that tale look with changed eyes on me  
As deeming that some secret hope had wrought  
Within my false heart, and that pageant brought  
Before mine eyes; or he might flee the land <span id="page_97">p.
97</span>  
To save our house from some accursed hand;  
And either way that dream seemed hard to tell  
That yet, untold, made for my soul a hell.

   "But of a certain elder now I thought,  
Who much of lore to both of us had taught  
And loved us well; Diana's priest was he,  
And in the wild woods served her faithfully,  
Dwelling with few folk in her woodland shrine.  
That from the hillside such a man sees shine  
As goes from Corinth unto Sicyon.  
   "And now amid these thoughts was night nigh done,  
And the dawn glimmered; I grew hot to go  
To that old priest these troublous things to show;  
So from my bed I rose up silently,  
And with all haste I did my weed on me,  
And went unto the door; but as I passed  
The fair porch through, I saw how ’gainst the last  
Brass-adorned pillar lay a feathered dart;  
And therewith came new fear into my heart,  
For as the dart that I in dreams had seen  
So was it fashioned, and with feathers green  
And scarlet was the hinder end bedight,  
And round the shaft were bands of silver white.  
Then scarcely did I know if still I dreamed,  
Yet, looking at the shaft, withal it seemed  
Good unto me to take it in my hand,  
That the old man the more might understand  
How real my dream had been in very deed, <span id="page_98">p.
98</span>  
And give me counsel better to my need.  
   "With that I caught it up, and went my way,  
And almost ere the sun had made it day  
Was I within the woods, and hastening on,  
Afire until the old man's house was won,  
And like a man who walks in sleep I went,  
Nor noted aught amid my strong intent.  
   "But when I reached the little forest fane  
I found my labour had but been in vain;  
For there the priest's folk told me he had gone  
The eve before to Corinth, all alone,  
And on some weighty matter, as they deemed;  
For measurelessly troubled still he seemed.  
His trouble troubled me, because I thought  
That unto him sure knowledge had been brought  
Of some great danger hanging over me,  
And that he thither went my face to see,  
While I was seeking him; and therewithal  
Great fear and heaviness on me did fall;  
And all the life I once had thought so sweet  
Now seemed a troublous thing and hard to meet.  
   "So cityward again I set my face,  
And through the woodland glades I rode apace,  
And halfway betwixt dawn and noon had I  
Unto the wood's edge once more come anigh;  
And now upon the wind I seemed to hear  
The sound of mingled voices drawing near;  
Whereon I stayed to hearken and cried out,  
But feeble was the sound from my parched throat; <span id="page_99">p.
99</span>  
And listening afterward I heard not now  
Those sounds, and timorous did my faint heart grow,  
And tales of woodfolk my vexed mind did take.  
But just as I the well-wrought reins would shake,  
Grown nigher did I hear those sounds again,  
And drew aback the hand that held the rein,  
And even therewith stalked forth into the way  
From out the thicket a huge wolf and grey,  
And stood with yellow eyes that glared on me;  
And I stared too; my folly made me see  
No wolf, but some dread deity, in him;  
But trembling as I was in every limb,  
E’en as his growling smote upon my heart,  
Tighter my fingers clutched the dreadful dart,  
I made a shift in stirrups up to stand,  
And hurled the quivering shaft from out my hand;  
Then fire seemed all around me, and a pang  
Crushed down my heart as from the thicket rang  
A dreadful cry: clear saw I, even as he  
Who meets the Father's visage suddenly;  
No wolf was there; but o’er the herbage ran  
With staggering steps a pale and bleeding man:  
His left hand on the shaft, whose banded wood  
Over the barbs within his bosom stood,  
His right hand raised against me, as he fell  
Close to my horse-hoofs; and I knew full well  
That this my brother's last farewell should be,  
And thus his face henceforward should I see. <span id="page_100">p.
100</span>

      "What else? it matters not; the priest I saw,  
And armed men from the thicket toward me draw,  
With scared eyes fixed on mine; I drew my sword,  
And sat there, waiting for a dreadful word,  
Bidding the rush of many men on me;  
But they began to draw round silently,  
And ere the circle yet was fully made,  
I, who at first might even thus have stayed  
For death and curses, felt the love of life  
Stir up my heart again to hope and strife;  
Yea, even withal I saw in one bright gleam  
The latter ending of my dreaded dream.  
So, crying out, strongly my horse I spurred,  
And as he, rearing up, dashed forth, I heard  
Clatter of arms and cries, a spear flew o’er  
My bended head, a well-aimed arrow tore  
My helm therefrom; yet then a cry there came:  
'Take him alive, nor bring a double shame  
Upon the great house!' Even therewith I drave  
Against a mighty man as wave meets wave;  
Back flew my right arm, and my sword was gone,  
Whirled off as from a sling the wave-worn stone,  
And my horse reeled, but he before me lay  
Rolled over, horse and man, and in my way  
Was no one now, as I spurred madly on:  
And so in no long time the race I won,  
For nobly was I mounted; and I deem  
That to the most of those men did it seem  
No evil thing that I should ’scape away. <span id="page_101">p.
101</span>

   "O King, I think this happed but yesterday,  
And now already do I deem that I  
Did no good deed in seeking not to die,  
For I am weary, and the Gods made me  
A luckless man among all folk to be—  
I care not if their purpose I undo,  
Since now I doubt not that the thing is so—  
—And yet am I so made, that, having life,  
Must I, though ever worsted in the strife,  
Cling to it still too much to gain the rest  
Which yet I know of all things is the best.  
Then slay me, King! to now, I pray for this,  
And no least portion of thy hoarded bliss;  
Slay me, and let the oak-boughs say their say  
Over my bones through the wild winter day!  
Slay me, for I am fain thereto to go,  
Where no talk is of either bliss or woe."

   "Nay," said the King, "didst thou not eat and drink  
When hunger drave thee e’ennow? yea, and shrink  
When my men's spears were pointed at thy breast?  
Be patient; thou indeed shalt gain thy rest,  
But many a thing has got to come ere then:  
For all things die, and thou midst other men  
Shalt scarce remember thou hast had a friend.  
At worst before thou comest to the end  
Joy shalt thou have, and sorrow: wherefore come;  
With me thou well mayst have no hapless home.  
Dread not the Gods; ere long time has gone by <span id="page_102">p.
102</span>  
Thy soul from all guilt will we purify,  
And sure no heavy curse shall lie on thee.  
Nay, did their anger cause this thing to be?  
Perchance in heaven they smile upon thy gain—  
—Lo, for a little while a burning pain,  
Then yearning unfulfilled a little space,  
Then tender memories of a well-loved face  
In quiet hours, and then—forgetfulness—  
How hadst thou rather borne, still less and less  
To love what thou hadst loved, till it became  
A thing to be forgotten, a great shame  
To think thou shouldst have wasted life thereon?  
Come then—thou spakest of a kingdom won  
Thy dream foretold, and shall not this be too,  
E’en as the dreadful deed thou cam’st to do?  
To horse! and unto Argos let us wend,  
Begin thy life afresh with me for friend.  
Wide is the world, nor yet for many a day  
Will every evil thing be cleared away  
That bringeth scathe to men within its girth;  
Surely a man like thee can win the mirth  
That cometh of the conquering of such things;  
For not in vain art thou the seed of kings  
Unless thy face belie thee—nay, no more:  
Why speak I vain words to a heart still sore  
With sudden death of happiness? yet come  
And ride with us unto our lovely home."

   Hipponoüs to the King's word answered nought, <span id="page_103">p.
103</span>  
But sat there brooding o’er his dreary thought,  
Nor seemed to hear; and when the Argive men  
Brought up to him his battle-steed again,  
Scarce witting of the company or place,  
He mounted, and with set and weary face  
Rode as they bade him at the King's left hand:  
Nor did the sight of the fair well-tilled land,  
When that they gained from out the tangled wood,  
Do aught in dealing with his mournful mood;  
Nor Argos’ walls as from the fields they rose,  
Such good things with their mightiness to close  
From chance of hurt; scarce saw he the fair gate,  
Dainty to look on, yet so huge of weight;  
Nor did the streets’ well-ordered houses draw  
His eyes to look at them; unmoved he saw  
The south-land merchants’ dusky glittering train;  
About the fountain the slim maids in vain  
Drew sleek arms from the water, or turned round  
With shaded eyes at the great horn's hoarse sound.  
The sight of the King's house, deemed of all men  
A wonder mid the houses kings had then,  
Drew from him but a troubled frown, as though  
Men's toilsome folly he began to know;  
The carven Gods within the banquet-hall,  
The storied hangings that bedight the wall,  
Made his heart sick to think of labour vain,  
Telling once more the oft-told tale of pain.  
Cold in the damsel's hand his strong hand lay,  
When to the steaming bath she led the way; <span id="page_104">p.
104</span>  
And when another damsel brought for him  
Raiment wherein the Tyrian dye showed dim  
Amid the gold lines of the broideries,  
Her face downcast because she might not please,  
He heeded not. When to the hall he passed,  
And by the high seat he was set at last,  
Then Prœtus, smiling from his mild eyes, laid  
A hand upon his combed-out hair and said:

   "Surely for no good luck this golden hair  
Has come to Argos, and this visage fair,  
To make us, who were well enow before,  
Seem to our maids like churls at the hall-door,  
Prying about when men to war are gone  
And girls and children sit therein alone."

   But nought Hipponoüs heeded the King's say,  
But, turning, roughly put his hand away,  
And frowning muttered, and still further drew,  
As a man touched amid his dream might do.

   In sooth he dreamed, and dreary was his dream;  
A bitter thing the world to him did seem;  
The void of life to come he peopled now  
With folk of scornful eyes and brazen brow;  
And one by one he told the tale of days  
Wherein an envious mock was the world's praise;  
Where good deeds brought ill fame, and truth was not,  
Hate was remembered, love was soon forgot;  
No face was good for long to look upon, <span id="page_105">p.
105</span>  
And nought was worthy when it once was won;  
And narrow, helpless, friendless was the way,  
That led unto the last most hopeless day  
Of hopeless days, in tangled, troubled wise.  
So thought he, till the tears were in his eyes  
Since he was young yet, for hope lying dead.

   But on his fixed eyes and his weary head  
The happy King of Argos gazed awhile,  
Till from his eye faded the scornful smile  
That lingered on his lips; and now he turned,  
As one who long ago that task had learned,  
And unto the great men about him spoke,  
And was a merry king of merry folk.

   So passed the feast and all men drew to sleep,  
And e’en Hipponoüs his soul might steep  
In sweet forgetfulness a little while;  
And somewhat did the fresh young day beguile  
His treasured sorrow when he woke next morn,  
And somewhat less he felt himself forlorn:  
Nor did the King forget him, but straight sent  
Unto the priests, and told them his intent  
That this his guest should there be purified,  
Since he with honour in his house should bide.

   So was Jove's house made ready for that thing,  
And thither amid songs and harp-playing,  
White-robed and barefoot, was Hipponoüs brought;  
Who, bough in hand, for peace the God besought. <span id="page_106">p.
106</span>  
Noiseless the white bulls fell beneath the stroke  
Of the gold-girdled, well-taught temple folk:  
Up to the roof arose the incense-cloud;  
The chanted prayer of men, now low now loud,  
Thrilled through the brazen leaves of the great door;  
Thick lay the scattered herbs upon the floor,  
And in the midst at last the hero stood,  
Freed of the guilt of shedding kindred blood.  
And then the chief priest cried, "Bellerophon,  
With this new hapless name that thou hast won,  
Go forth, go free, be happy once again,  
But no more called Hipponoüs of men."

   Then forth Bellerophon passed wearily,  
Although so many prayers had set him free;  
Yet somewhat was he ready to forget,  
And turn unto the days that might be yet.

   But when before King Prœtus’ throne he came,  
The King called out on him by his new name;  
"O fair Bellerophon, like me, be wise,  
And set things good to win before thine eyes,  
Lands, and renown, and riches, and a life  
That knows from day to day so much of strife  
As makes men happy, since the age of gold  
Is past, if e’er it was, as a tale told."

   "O King," he said, "thou sittest in full day,  
Thou strivest to put thoughts of night away; <span id="page_107">p.
107</span>  
My life has not yet left the morning-tide,  
And I, who find the world that seemed so wide,  
Now narrowed to a little troublous space  
Where help is not, astonied turn my face  
Unto the coming hours, nor know at all  
What thing of joy or hope to me will fall.  
Be patient, King; perchance within a while  
No marfeast I may be, but learn to smile  
Even as thou, who lovest life so much.  
Who knows but grief may vanish at a touch,  
As joy does? and a long way off is death:  
Some folk seem glad even to draw their breath."

   "Yea," said the King, "thou hast it, for indeed  
I fain would live, like most men—but what need  
Unto a fevered man to talk of wine?  
Thy heart shall love life when it grows like mine.  
But come thou hence, and I will show to thee  
What things of price the Gods have given to me.  
Not good it is to harp on the frayed string;  
And thou, so seeing many a lovely thing,  
Mayst hide thy weary pain a little space."

   And therewith did King Prœtus from that place  
Draw forth Bellerophon, and so when he  
In his attire was now clad royally,  
From out the precinct to his palace fair  
Did the King bring him; and he showed him there  
His stables, where the war-steeds stood arow <span id="page_108">p.
108</span>  
Over the dusty grain: then did they go  
To armouries, where sword and spear and shield  
Hung bloodless, ready for the fated field:  
The treasury showed he, where things richly wrought  
Together into such a place were brought,  
That he who stole the oxen of a God,  
For all his godlike cunning scarce had trod  
Untaken on its floor—withal he showed  
The chamber where the broidered raiment glowed,  
Where the spice lay, and scented unguents fit  
To touch Queen Venus’ skin and brighten it;  
The ivory chairs and beds of ivory  
He showed him, and he bid his tired eyes see  
The stories wrought on brazen doors, the flowers  
And things uncouth carved on the wood of bowers;  
The painted walls that told things old and new.  
Things come to pass, and things that onward drew.

   But all the while Bellerophon's grave face  
And soon-passed smile seemed unmeet for that place,  
And ever Prœtus felt a pang of fear,  
As if it told of times a-drawing near,  
When all the wealth and beauty that was his  
Should not avail to buy one hour of bliss.  
And sometimes when he watched his wandering eyes  
And heard his stammering speech, would there arise  
Within his heart a feeling like to hate,  
Mingled with scorn of one so crushed by fate:  
For ever must the rich man hate the poor. <span id="page_109">p.
109</span>  
   Now at the last they stood before a door  
Adorned with silver, wrought of precious wood;  
Then Prœtus laughed, and said, "O guest, thy mood  
Is hard to deal with; never any leech  
Has striven as I thy sickness’ heart to reach;  
And I grow weary and must get me aid."  
   Therewith upon the lock his hand he laid  
And pushed the door aback, and then the twain  
The daintiest of all passages did gain,  
And as betwixt its walls they passed along  
Nearer they drew unto the measured song  
Of sweet-voiced women; and the King spake then:  
"Drive fire out with fire, say all wise men;  
Here mayst thou set thine eyes on such an one,  
That thou no more wilt think of days agone,  
But days to come; for here indeed my spouse  
Watches the damsels in the weaving-house,  
Or in the pleasance sits above their play;  
And certes here upon no long-passed day,  
Unless my eyes were bleared with coming eld,  
Fair sights for such as thou have I beheld."  
   Across the exile's brow a frown there came,  
As though his sorrow of such things thought shame,  
Yet mayhap his eye brightened as he heard  
The song grow louder and the hall they neared;  
But the King smiled, and swiftlier led him on,  
Until unto the door thereof they won. <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

 

 

NOW noble was that hall and fair enow,  
Betwixt whose slim veined pillars set arow,  
And marble lattice wrought like flowering trees,  
Showed the green freshness of the summer seas,  
Made cheery by the sun and many a ship,  
Whose black bows smoothly through the waves did slip.  
In bowls whereon old stories pictured were  
The bright rose-laurels trembled in the air,  
That from the sea stole through the lattices,  
And round them hummed a few bewildered bees.  
   Midmost the pavement wrought by toil of years,  
A tree was set, gold-leaved like that which bears  
Unto the maids of Hesperus strange fruit;  
A many-coloured serpent from the root  
Curled upward round the stem, and, reaching o’er  
A four-square silver laver, did outpour  
Bright glittering water from his throat of brass;  
And at each corner of the basin was  
A brazen hart who seemed at point to drink;  
And these the craftsman had not made to shrink  
Though in the midst Diana's feet pressed down  
The forest greensward, and her girded gown  
Cleared from the brambles fell about her thigh,  
And eager showed her terrible bright eye.  
   But ’twixt the pillars and that marvellous thing  
Were scattered those they had e’en now heard sing; <span
id="page_111">p. 111</span>  
Their song had sunk now, and a murmuring voice,  
But mingled with the clicking loom's sharp noise  
And splashing of the fountain, where a maid  
With one hand lightly on a brass deer laid,  
One clasped about her own foot, knelt to watch  
Her brazen jar the tinkling water catch;  
Withal the wool-comb's sound within the fleece  
Began and grew, and slowly did decrease,  
And then began as still it gat new food;  
And by the loom an ancient woman stood  
And grumbled o’er the web; and on the floor  
Ten spindles twisted ever; from the store  
Raised on high pillars at the gable end.  
Adown a steep stair did a maiden wend,  
Who in the wide folds of her gathered gown  
Fresh yarn bright-dyed unto the loom bare down.

   But on the downy cushions of a throne,  
Above all this sat the fair Queen alone,  
Who heeded not the work, nor noted aught;  
Nor showed indeed that there was any thought  
Within her heaving breast; but though she moved  
No whit the limbs a God might well have loved,  
Although her mouth was as of one who lies  
In peaceful sleep; though over her deep eyes  
No shadow came to trouble her white brow,  
Yet might you deem no rest was on her now;  
Rather too weary seemed she e’en to sigh  
For foolish life that joyless passed her by. <span id="page_112">p.
112</span>  
   So thus the King Bellerophon led in  
Just as the old song did again begin  
From the slim maids, that by the loom's side spun;  
But ere it had full sway, the nighest one  
Unto the door stopped singing suddenly,  
And pressed her neighbour's arm, that she might see  
What new folk were come in; and therewithal  
An angry glance from the Queen's eyes did fall  
Upon the maid; so that Bellerophon  
A cruel visage had to look upon,  
When first he saw the Queen raised high above  
The ordered tresses of that close of love.  
   But when the women knew the King indeed  
They did him reverence, and with lowly heed  
Made way for him, while a girl here and there  
Made haste to hide what labour had made bare  
Of limb or breast; and the King smiled through all,  
And now and then a wandering glance let fall  
Upon some fairest face; and so at last  
Through the sweet band unto the Queen they passed,  
Who rose and waited them by her fair throne  
With eyes wherefrom all care once more had gone  
Of life and what it brought: then the King said—  
   "O Sthenobœa, hither have I led  
A man, who, from a happy life down-hurled,  
Looks with sick eyes upon this happy world;  
Not knowing how to stay here or depart:  
Thou know’st and I know how the wounded heart  
Forgetteth pain and groweth whole again, <span id="page_113">p.
113</span>  
Yet is the pain that passes no less pain.  
   "But since this man is noble even as we,  
And help begets help, and withal to me  
Worthy he seems to be a great king's friend,  
Now help me to begin to make an end  
Of his so heavy mood; for though indeed  
This daintiness may nowise help his need,  
Yet may kind words avail to make him kind  
Unto himself; kind eyes may make him blind  
Unto the ugly, tangled whirl of life;  
Or in some measured image of real strife  
He may forget the things that he has lost,  
Nor think of how he needs must yet be tost  
Like other men from wave to wave of fate."

   Gravely she set herself the end to wait  
Of the King's speech; and what of scorn might be  
Within her heart changed nowise outwardly  
Her eyes that looked with scorn on everything;  
And yet withal while still the cheery King  
Let his tale flow, unto the exile's place  
She glanced with scornful wonder at his face  
At first, because she deemed it soft and kind;  
Yet was he fair, and she—she needs must find  
Something that drew her to his wide grey eyes;  
And presently as with some great surprise  
Her heart ’gan beat, and she must strive in vain  
To crush within it a sweet rising pain,  
She deemed to be that pity that she knew <span id="page_114">p.
114</span>  
As the last folly wise folk turn unto.  
For pain was wont to rouse her rage, and she  
Was like those beasts that slaughter cruelly  
Their wounded fellows—truth she knew not of,  
And fain had killed folk babbling over love;  
Justice she thought of as a thing that might  
Balk some desire of hers, before the night  
Of death should end it all: nor hope she knew,  
Nor what fear was, how ill soe’er life grew.  
   This wisdom had she more than most of folk,  
That through the painted cloud of lies she broke  
To gain what brought her pleasure for awhile,  
However men might call it nought and vile;  
Nor was she one to make a piteous groan  
O’er bitter pain amid her pleasure grown.

   But she was one of those wrought by the gods  
To be to foolish men as sharpest rods  
To scourge their folly; wrought so daintily  
That scarcely could a man her body see  
Without awaking strife ’twixt good and ill  
Within him; and her sweet, soft voice would fill  
Men's hearts with strange desires, and her great eyes,  
Truthful to show her to the cold and wise  
E’en as she was, would make some cast aside  
Whatever wisdom in their breasts might hide,  
And still despite what long ill days might prove,  
They called her languid hate the soul of love.

   But now that fire that to her eyes arose <span id="page_115">p.
115</span>  
She cast aback awhile to lie all close  
About her heart; her full lips trembled not,  
And from her cheek faded the crimson spot  
That erst increased thereon.  
                              "O Prince," she said,  
"Strive to get back again thy goodlihead;  
Life flitteth fast, and while it still abides,  
Our folly many a good thing from us hides,  
That else would pierce our hearts with its delight  
Unto the quick, in all the Gods’ despite."

   He gazed upon her wondering, for again  
That new-born hope, that sweet and bitter pain,  
Flushed her smooth cheek, and glittered in her eyes,  
And wrought within her lips; yet was she wise,  
And gazing on his pale and wondering face,  
In his frank eyes she did not fail to trace  
A trouble like unto a growing hate,  
That, yet unknown to him, her love did wait;  
Then once more did she smother up that flame,  
Calm grew she, from her lips a false voice came.

   "Yea, and bethink thee, mayst thou not be born  
To raise the crushed and succour the forlorn,  
And in the place of sorrow to set mirth,  
Gaining a great name through the wondering earth?  
Now surely has my lord the King done well  
To bring thee here thy tale to me to tell;  
Come, then, for nearby such a bower there is <span id="page_116">p.
116</span>  
As most men deem to be a place of bliss;  
There, when thy tale is o’er that I am fain  
To hearken, may sweet music ease thy pain  
Amidst our feast; or of these maids shall one  
Read of some piteous thing the Gods have done  
To us poor folk upon the earth that dwell.  
Yea, and the reader will I choose so well,  
That such an one herself shall seem to be  
As she of whom the tale tells piteously.  
And thou shalt hear when all is past and o’er,  
And with its sorrow still thine heart is sore,  
The Lydian flutes come nigher and more nigh,  
Till glittering raiment cometh presently,  
And thou behold’st the dance of the slim girls,  
Wavering and strange as the leaf-wreath that whirls  
Down in the marble court we walk in here  
Mid sad October, when the rain draws near:  
So delicate therewith, that when all sound  
Of sobbing flute has left the air around,  
And, panting, lean the dancers against wall  
And well-wrought pillar, you hear nought at all  
But their deep breathing, so are all men stilled,  
So full their hearts with all that beauty filled."

   Coldly and falsely was her speech begun,  
But she waxed warm ere all the tale was done;  
Nay, something soft was in her voice at last,  
As round his soul her net she strove to cast  
Almost despite herself. <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>  
                         Unmoved he stood,  
But that some thought did cross his weary mood  
That made him knit his brow, and therewith came  
A flush across his face as if of shame  
Because of that new thought; but when an end  
Her speech had, then he spake:  
                                "What love or friend  
Can do me good? God-hated shall I be,  
And bring to no man aught but misery;  
And thou, O royal man, and thou, O Queen,  
Who heretofore in bliss and mirth have been,  
Hearken my words, and on your heads be all  
The trouble that from me shall surely fall  
If I abide with you.: yet doubt it not  
That this your love shall never be forgot  
Wherewith ye strive to win a helpless man,  
And ever will I labour as I can  
To make my ill forebodings come to nought."

   But midst these things, pleased by some hidden thought,  
The King smiled, turning curious eyes on them,  
And smoothing down his raiment's golden hem  
As one who hearkens music; then said he,  
"Wilt thou give word for our festivity,  
O Sthenobœa? But come thou, O guest,  
And by the great sea we will take our rest,  
Speaking few words."  
                         So from her golden throne <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span>  
She passed to do what things must needs be done,  
And with firm feet amid her maids she went  
On this new tyrannous sweetness all intent;  
So did it work in her, that scarcely she  
Might bear the world now, as she turned to see  
The stranger and the King a-going down  
By marble stairs unto the foreshores brown.  
So slipped the morn away, and when the sun  
His downward course some three hours had begun,  
Summoned by sound of horns they took their way  
Unto a bower that looking westward lay,  
Yet was by trellised roses shaded so  
That little of the hot sun did it know  
But what the lime-trees’ honey-sweet scent told,  
And their wide wind-stirred leaves, turned into gold  
Against the bright rays of the afternoon.

   So to that chamber came the fair Queen soon,  
Well harbingered by flutes; nor had she spared  
To veil her limbs in raiment that had fared  
O’er many a sea, before it had the hap  
The Lycian's smooth skin in its folds to lap.  
But as she entered there in queenly guise,  
With firm and haughty step, and careless eyes  
Over the half-hid beauty of her breast,  
One moment on the exile did they rest,  
And softened to a meek, imploring gaze—  
One moment only; as with great amaze  
His eyes beheld her, doubtful what was there, <span id="page_119">p.
119</span>  
All had gone thence, but the proud empty stare  
That she was wont to turn on everything.  
   Withal she sat her down beside the King,  
And the feast passed with much of such delight  
As makes to happy men the world seem bright,  
But from the hapless draws but hate and scorn,  
Because the Gods both happy and forlorn  
Have set in one world, each to each to be  
A vain rebuke, a bitter memory.  
   Yet the Queen held her word, and when that they  
Had heard the music sing adown the day,  
After the dancing women had but left  
Sweet honeyed scents behind, or roses, reft  
By their own hands from head or middle small,  
Then came with hurried steps into the hall  
The reader and her scroll; sweet-eyed was she,  
And timid as some loving memory  
Midst the world's clamour: clad in gown of wool  
She sat herself adown upon a stool  
Anigh the proud feet of the Lycian Queen,  
And straight, as if no soul she there had seen,  
With slender hand put back her golden hair,  
And ’gan to read from off the parchment fair.  
In a low voice, and trembling at the first,  
She read a tale of lovers’ lives accurst  
By cruel Gods and careless foolish men:  
Like dainty music was her voice, and when  
From out her heart she sighed, as she must read  
Of folk unholpen in their utmost need, <span id="page_120">p.
120</span>  
Still must the stranger turn kind eyes on her.  
At last awhile she paused, as she drew near  
The bitter end of spilt and wasted bliss,  
And death unblessed at last by any kiss;  
Her voice failed, and adown her book did sink,  
And midst them all awhile she seemed to think  
Of the past days herself; but still so much  
Her beauty and the tale their hearts did touch,  
Folk held their breath till she began again,  
And something ’twixt a pleasure and a pain  
It was when all the sweet tale was read o’er  
And her voice quivered through the air no more.  
   Then round the maiden's neck King Prœtus cast  
A golden chain, and from the hall she passed,  
And yet confused and shamefaced; for the Queen,  
Who at the first the Prince's eyes had seen  
Upon the maid, and then would look no more,  
But kept her eyes fixed on the marble floor  
As listening to the tale; her head now raised,  
And with cold scorn upon the maiden gazed  
As she bent down the golden gift to take;  
And meanwhile, for her tender beauty's sake,  
Over the exile's face a pleased smile came.

   But she departed to the bliss or shame  
Life had for her, and all folk left the bower;  
For now was come the summer night's mid-hour:  
The great high moon that lit the rippling sea  
’Twixt the thin linden-trees shone doubtfully <span id="page_121">p.
121</span>  
Upon the dim grey garden; the sea-breeze  
Stooped down on the pleached alleys; the tall trees  
Over the long roofs moved their whispering leaves,  
Nor woke the dusky swifts beneath the eaves.

 

 

NOW from that fair night wore the time away,  
Until with lapse of many a quiet day,  
And stirring times withal, Bellerophon  
To love of life and hope of joy was won.  
Still grave and wise he was beyond his years,  
No eager man among his joyous peers  
To snatch at pleasure; careful not to cheat  
His soul with vain desires all over sweet;  
A wary walker on the road of life;  
E’en as a man who in a garden, rife  
With flowers, has gone unarmed, and found that there  
Are evil things amid the blossoms fair,  
And paid with wounds for folly: yet when he  
Is whole once more, since there he needs must be,  
And has no will its sweets to cast aside,  
Well armed he walks there ware of beasts that hide  
Beneath the shade of those vine-trellises,  
Amid the grey stems of the apple-trees.

   Yet at his heart, about the root of it <span id="page_122">p.
122</span>  
Strange thoughts there lay, which at sweet times would flit  
Before his eyes, as things grown palpable;  
Strange hopes that made the weltering world seem well  
While he abode there: therefore was he kind  
To man and maid, and all men's hearts did bind  
With bonds of love, for mid the struggling folk,  
The forgers and the bearers of the yoke,  
Weary with wronging and with wrongs, he seemed  
As one on whom a light from heaven had beamed,  
That changed him to a god yet being alive.  
   But midst all folk there did King Prœtus give  
Great gifts to him; great trust in him he had,  
And ever by his sight was he made glad:  
For well did all things prosper in his hand,  
Nor was there such another in the land  
For strength or goodliness.  
                             Now so it was,  
That he on matters of the King would pass  
About the country here and there, nor dwell  
At Argos much, and that thing pleased him well;  
For while all else grew better, ye shall know  
That greater in his heart the fear did grow  
That sprung up therein on that summer eve;  
And though sometimes the Queen would make believe  
To heed him nought—yea, or depart maybe  
At whiles, when he the King would come to see—  
Yet was this but at whiles; the next day came,  
And scarce would she hold parley with her shame. <span id="page_123">p.
123</span>  
   One noon of the late autumn, when the sun  
Brightened the parting year, so nearly done,  
With rays as hot as early June might shed,  
Dawn past an hour, upon the tulip-bed,  
In the great pleasance, ’neath a wall of yew,  
Walked the Corinthian, pondering what to do  
In some great matter late given unto him.  
So clad he was, that both on breast and limb  
Steel glittered, though his head as yet was bare;  
But in his face was just so much of care  
As seemed to show he had got that to do  
He feared but little well to carry through,  
But which must have his heed a little while:  
And still in going would he stop and smile,  
And seem to cast the shreds of thought away  
In honour of the bright fresh autumn day  
And all the pleasure of the lovely place.  
   But at the last, turning about his face  
Unto the sunny garden's other side,  
He saw where, down a grassy path and wide,  
The Queen came, with her head bent down to earth,  
As though mid thoughts she were that slew her mirth;  
Slowly she went, with two maids following her,  
Who in their delicate slim hands did bear,  
The one a cithern and some verse-book old,  
The other a white osier maund, to hold  
Some of such flowers as still in fear and doubt  
Against the sickness of the year held out.  
   But as they went, nigh to the Prince they drew, <span
id="page_124">p. 124</span>  
And soon the maidens’ eyes his beauty knew,  
And one at other glanced, smiling and glad,  
For soft love of him in their hearts they had;  
Yet nought they said, nor did the Queen turn round,  
But kept her eyes still bent upon the ground.  
So in their walk they came to where there stood  
A thin-leaved apple-tree, where, red as blood,  
Yellow as gold, a little fruit hung yet,  
The last rays of the fainting sun to get;  
And a tall clump of autumn flowers, cold-grey,  
Beneath it, mocked the promise of the day,  
And to them clung a hapless bee or twain,  
A butterfly spread languid wings in vain  
Unto the sun, that scarce could heat her now.  
There the Queen stayed awhile her footsteps slow,  
And to the flowers wandered her slender hand;  
But with her eyes cast down she still did stand,  
And pondered.  
                 Full of melody and peace  
About her was the lingering year's decease;  
Strange spicy scents there were that yet were sweet,  
Green was the grass about her gold-shod feet,  
And had no memory of the dawn's white rime;  
Loud was the birds’ song in that windless time,  
Strange the sharp crying of the missel-thrush  
Within the close heart of the hawthorn-bush,  
Strange the far-off rooks’ sweet tumultuous voice  
That in the high elms e’en now must rejoice  
And know not why—peace e’en if end of peace. <span id="page_125">p.
125</span>  
   The while her burning heart did never cease  
To give words to such longings, as she knew  
To swift destruction all her glory drew.  
   "Ah! mine, mine, mine!" she thought, "ah! mine a while!  
Ah! mine a little day, if all be vile  
The coming years can bring unto my heart!  
Ah! mine this eve, if we to-morn must part!  
Mine, that a sweet hour I may know at last  
How soon soever all delight is passed!  
Ah! mine, mine, mine, if for a little while!"

   So stood she, that her parted lips did smile  
As if of one that memories make half sad,  
Her breast heaved, as no stronger wish she had  
Than for some careless lover, lightly won,  
And soon forgot, to lay his lips thereon;  
The flower-stem that her finger-tips did hold  
Was crushed not, and within her shoe of gold  
Lightly her foot was laid upon the grass;  
No tremors through her dainty limbs did pass,  
And healthy life alone did paint her cheek:  
For if indeed at first she had felt weak,  
Ere well she knew what she was bent upon,  
Now at the last, when every doubt was gone,  
She would not show the net unto the prey  
Until she deemed that in her toils he lay.

   She raised her eyes at last with a light sigh, <span id="page_126">p.
126</span>  
Despite herself, a flush passed suddenly  
Over her face, and then all pale she grew;  
For now withal Bellerophon she knew,  
Though at that very point of time the sun  
Along his upraised steel-clad arm had run,  
And made an earthly sun that dazzled her.  
Yet cast she back her trembling hope and fear  
Into her heart, and as before she went  
Slowly, with head a little downward bent,  
But when she had gone on a few yards space,  
Once more unto the Prince she raised her face;  
Then stopped again, and turning round, she said,  
From lips wherein all passion now seemed dead:  
   "Damsels, go home again; thou, Mysian, go  
Unto the little treasury thou dost know  
Anigh my bower, and taking this gold key,  
Draw forth that ancient prophet's book for me  
Which shows the stars: for that I fain would show  
To Prince Bellerophon, who bides me now  
Ere he goes forth to bring the island folk  
Once more beneath King Prœtus' equal yoke.  
And thou, Leucippe, bide our coming there,  
And bid our folk set forth a feast as fair  
As may be done; for we within a while  
May need thy cithern dull thoughts to beguile."

   E’en as they turned she passed on carelessly  
Toward the Prince, nor looked aback to see  
That they were gone; but he indeed had heard <span id="page_127">p.
127</span>  
Through the calm air her clearly-spoken word,  
And saw the maidens go, and felt as one  
Who bideth, when the herald's speech is done,  
The word that bids the grinded spears fall down.  
But she, with slim hand folded in her gown,  
Went o’er the dewy grass to where he stood,  
And in despite the fire within her blood  
Was calm, and smiled on him, till nigh he thought  
That surely all his fear was vain and nought.  
   He bowed before her as she drew anear,  
But she held out her right hand, and in clear  
Sweet tones she cried, "O fair Bellerophon,  
Would that the victory were already won,  
And thou wert back again at this thy home  
We have made glad for thee: behold! I come  
To say farewell—yet come a little way—  
For something else indeed I had to say."

   And still she held his hand, but yet durst not  
Clasp as she would the treasure she had got.  
Then to a place together did they pass,  
Where yew-trees hemmed around a plot of grass,  
And kept it scarce touched by the faint sun's rays—  
A place well made for burning summer days,  
But cheerless now. There on a marble seat  
She bade him sit; while she with restless feet  
Paced to and fro, while from the yew-twigs close,  
With his scared cry the creeping blackbird rose.  
But he, with eyes cast down upon the ground, <span id="page_128">p.
128</span>  
Deemed that his battle easier would be found  
Than this.  
            And so at last she stayed by him  
And cried: "The cup is full unto the brim;  
For now thou goest where thou mayst be slain:  
I speak then—and, alas! I speak in vain—  
Thy cold eyes tell me so—How shall I move  
Thy flinty heart my curse has made me love?  
For what have other women done, when they  
Were fair as I, and love before them lay?  
Was not a look enough for them, a word  
Low murmured, midst the hum of men scarce heard?  
What have I left undone that they have done?  
What askest thou of me, O heart of stone?"

   Choked by her passion here awhile she stayed,  
And he from off the bench sprang up dismayed,  
And turned on her to speak; but she withal  
Before him on her knees made haste to fall,  
And cried out loud and shrilly: "Nay, nay, nay—  
Say not the word thou art about to say;  
Let me depart, and things be still as now;  
So that my dreams sweet images may show,  
As they have done—that waking I may think,  
'If he, my love, from looks of love did shrink,  
That was because I had not prayed him then  
To be my love alone of living men;  
Because he did not know that I, a Queen,  
Who hitherto but loveless life have seen, <span id="page_129">p.
129</span>  
Could kneel to him, and pray upon my knees  
To give me my first pleasure, my first peace'  
Thou knewest not—nay, nay, thou know’st not now—  
Thou with the angry eyes and bended brow!—  
Surely I talk my mother-tongue no more,  
Therefore thou knowest not that I implore  
Thy pity, that I give myself to thee,  
Thy love, thy slave, thy castaway to be-  
Hear’st thou? thy castaway! when in a while  
Thou growest weary of my loving smile!  
Oh, take me, madman! In a year or twain  
I will not thwart thee if thou lov’st again,  
Nor eye thee sourly when thou growest cold;  
—Or art thou not the man that men call bold,  
And fear’st thou? Then what better time than this  
For we twain to begin our life of bliss?  
Thy keel awaits thee, and to thee alone,  
Not to the wretched dastard on the throne,  
Thy men will hearken—Nay, thou shalt not speak,  
My feeble reed of hope thou shalt not break!—  
Let me be gone, thou knowest not of love,  
Thou semblance of a man that nought can move!  
It O wise, wise man, I give thee good farewell:  
Gather fresh wisdom, thinking of my hell."

   She sprang up to her feet and turned away  
Trembling, and no word to her could he say  
For grief and pity; and the Queen did go  
A little way with doubtful steps and slow, <span id="page_130">p.
130</span>  
Then turned about, and once again did stand  
Before his troubled face, hand laid in hand,  
And sobbing now as if her heart would break;  
But when from his grieved soul he fain would speak,  
Again from midst her tears she cried, "No, no—  
Do I not know what thou wouldst bid me do?  
And yet forgive me!—thou art wise and good.  
Surely some evil thing has turned my blood,  
That even now I wished that thing to slay  
That I of all things only till this day  
Have loved. Ah, surely thou wilt not be slain!  
Come back, and I will tell thee once again  
How much I love thee, and will not forget  
To say such things as might have moved thee yet,  
Could I have told thee now, couldst thou have seen  
These lips that love thee as they might have been.  
—Farewell, I durst not pray thee for one kiss!"

   Nearer she drew to him as she spake this,  
Yet, when she ended, turned about again,  
And still, as hoping all was not in vain,  
Lingered a little while, and then at last,  
With raging heart, swiftly therefrom she passed.

   But, she clean vanished now, Bellerophon  
Went slowly toward the palace, all alone,  
And pondering on these things: and shamed he felt,  
E’en as a just man who in sleep has dealt  
Unjustly; nor had all her prayers and tears <span id="page_131">p.
131</span>  
Moved love in him, but rather stirred his fears,  
For ever was he wise among wise men;  
And though he doubted not her longing, when  
She turned and spake soft words, he knew that she  
So spake midst hope of what things yet might be,  
And yet had left another kind of word,  
Whereby a friendless man might well be feared;  
Lonely he felt thereat, as one accurst,  
With whom all best things still must turn to worst,  
And e’en sweet love curdle to bitter hate.  
Yet was he one not lightly crushed by fate,  
And when at last he had his helmet on,  
And heard the folk cry out 'Bellerophon,'  
As toward the ship he passed, kind the world seemed,  
Nor love so far away indeed he deemed  
When he some gentle maiden's kind grey eyes  
Fixed on his own he did at whiles surprise,  
Or when his godlike eyes, on some maid turned  
More fair than most, set fire to thoughts that burned  
On breast and brow of her. So forth he passed,  
And reached the border of the sea at last,  
And there took ship, and hence is gone a space.

   But for the Queen, when she had left that place,  
About the pleasance paths did she go still,  
So ’wildered in her mind because her will  
Might not be done, that at the first she knew  
No more what place she might be passing through  
Than one who walks in sleep. Yet hope and sham <span id="page_132">p.
132</span>  
Twain help, at last unto her spirit came;  
Yea, her bright gown, soiled with the autumn grass,  
Told her the tale of what had come to pass,  
And to her heart came hatred of the spot  
Where she had kneeled to one who loved her not,  
And even therewith his image did she see  
As he had been; then cried she furiously:  
   "Ah, fool! ah, traitor! must I love thee then,  
When in the world there are so many men  
My smile would drive to madness?—for I know  
What things they are that men desire so,  
And which of all these bear I not with me?  
Hast thou not heart and eyes to feel and see?  
Then shalt thou die, then shalt thou die, at least,  
Nor sit without me at life's glorious feast,  
While I fall ever unto worse and worse—  
Ah me! I rave!—what folly now to curse  
That which I love, because its loveliness  
Alone has brought me unto this distress!  
I know not right nor wrong, but yet through all  
Know that the Gods a just man him would call;  
Nay, and I knew it, when I saw him first,  
And in my heart sprang up that glorious thirst—  
And should he, not being base, yield suddenly,  
And as the basest man, not loving me,  
Take all I gave him, and cast all his life  
Into a tangled and dishonoured strife?  
Nay, it could never be—but now, indeed,  
Somewhat with pity of me his heart may bleed, <span id="page_133">p.
133</span>  
Since he is good; and he shall think of me,  
And day by day and night by night shall see  
The image of that woman on her knees,  
Whom men here liken to the goddesses.  
And certainly shall he come back again:  
Nor shall my next speech to him be so vain."

   She smiled, and toward the house made swiftly on  
In triumph, even as though the game were won:  
For, now his face was gone, she, blind with love,  
Deemed but his honour she had got to move  
From its high place, before his heart should fall  
A prey unto her; e’en as when the wall  
By many a stroke of stones is battered down,  
And all may work their will upon the town.

 

 

NOW of Bellerophon must it be said  
That, what by wisdom, what by hardihead,  
His task was done, and great praise gained thereby;  
So he at last, midst shouts and minstrelsy,  
In the first days of spring, passed up once more  
Unto the palace from the thronging shore.  
Him Prœtus met half-way, and, in the face  
Of all the people, in a straight embrace  
Held him awhile, and called him his dear son,  
Praising the Gods for all that he had done;  
Then hand in hand did they go up the street, <span id="page_134">p.
134</span>  
And on their heads folk cast the spring-flowers sweet,  
And bands of maids met them with joyous song  
And gracious pageants as they went along:  
And all this for the brave Corinthian's sake—  
Such joy did his return in all hearts make.

   But though the man, once from his home driven forth,  
Was so much loved and held of so much worth,  
And though he throve thereby, and seemed to be  
Scarcely a man but some divinity  
To people's eyes, yet in his soul no less  
There lingered still a little heaviness,  
And therefrom hardly could he cast away  
The memory of that sunny autumn day  
And of the fear it brought; and one more fear  
He had besides, and as they drew anear  
The palace, therewith somewhat faltering,  
He needs must turn a while, and of the King  
Ask how the Lycian fared: the King laughed low,  
And said:  
           "Nay, surely she is well enow,  
As her wont is to be, for, sooth to say,  
She for herself is ever wont to pray,  
And heedeth nothing other grief and wrong:  
And be thou sure, my son, that such live long  
And lead sweet lives; but those who ever think  
How he and she may fare, and still must shrink  
From sweeping any foe from out the way, <span id="page_135">p.
135</span>  
These—living other people's lives, I say,  
Besides their own, and most of them forlorn—  
May hap to find their lives of comfort shorn  
And short enow—let pass, for as to me,  
I weep for others’ troubles certainly,  
But for mine own would weep a little more,  
And so I jog on somehow to the shore  
Whence I shall not return—Thou laughest—well,  
I deem I was not made for heaven or hell,  
But simply for the earth; but thou, O son,  
I deem of heaven, and all hearts hast thou won—  
Yea, and this morn the Queen is merrier,  
Because she knoweth that thou art anear."

   The Prince smiled at his words and gladder felt,  
Yet somewhat of his old fear by him dwelt  
And shamed him midst his honour. But withal,  
With shouts and music, entered they the hall,  
And there great feast was made; but ere the night  
Had ’gun to put an end to men's delight,  
A maid came up the hall with hurrying feet,  
And there in lowly wise the King did greet,  
And bid him know that Sthenobœa had will  
The joyance of that high-tide to fulfil,  
And Prince Bellerophon to welcome home;  
And even as she spoke the Queen was come  
Unto the door, and through the hall she passed,  
And round about her ever looks she cast,  
As though her maidens, howsoever fair <span id="page_136">p.
136</span>  
And lovesome unto common eyes they were,  
Were fashioned in another wise than she,  
They made for time, she for eternity;  
So ’twixt the awed and wondering folk she moved,  
Hapless and proud, glorious and unbeloved,  
And hating all folk but her love alone:  
And he a shadow seemed, one moment shown  
Unto her longing eyes, then snatched away  
Ere yet her heart could win one glorious day.  
Cruel and happy was she deemed of men—  
Cruel she was, but though tormented then  
By love, still happier than she ere had been.  
Now when she saw the Prince, with such-like mien  
She greeted him but as a Queen might greet  
Her husband's friend fresh from a glorious feat;  
Frank-seeming were her words, and in her face  
No sign of all that storm the Prince could trace  
That had swept over her—and yet therefore  
Amidst his joy he did but fear her more.

   So time slipped by, and still was she the same,  
Till he ’gan deem she had forgot the shame  
Of having shameful gifts cast back to her,  
That scorned love was a burden light to bear.  
Yea, and the moody ways that once she had  
Seemed changing into life all frank and glad;  
She saw him oft now, and alone at whiles;  
But still, despite her kind words and her smiles,  
No word of love fell from her any more. <span id="page_137">p.
137</span>  
   But when the lush green spring was now passed o’er,  
And the green lily-buds were growing white,  
A feast they held for pastime and delight  
Within the odorous pleasance on a tide,  
And down the hours the feast in joy did glide.  
Venus they worshipped there, her image shone  
Above the folk from thoughts of hard life won;  
About her went the girls in ordered bands,  
And scattered flowers from out their slender hands,  
And with their eager voices, sweet but shrill,  
Betwixt the o’erladen trees the air did fill;  
Or, careless what their dainty limbs might meet,  
Ungirded and unshod, with hurrying feet,  
Mocked cold Diana's race betwixt the trees,  
Where the long grass and sorrel kissed their knees,  
About the borders of the neighbouring field;  
Or in the garden were content to yield  
Unto the sun, and by the fountain-side,  
Panting, love's growing languor would abide.  
   Surely the Goddess in the warm wind breathed,  
Surely her fingers wrought the flowers that wreathed  
The painted trellises—some added grace  
Her spirit gave to every limb and face,  
Some added scent to raiment long laid hid  
Beneath the stained chest's carven cypress lid;  
Fairer the girdle round the warm side clung,  
Fairer the dainty folds beneath it hung,  
Fairer the gold upon the bosom lay  
Than was their wont ere that bewildering day, <span id="page_138">p.
138</span>  
When fear and shame, twin rulers of the earth,  
Sat hoodwinked in the maze of short-lived mirth.  
   Songs cleft the air, and little words therein  
Were clean changed now, and told of honeyed sin,  
And passionate words seemed fire, and words, that had.  
Grave meaning once, were changed, and only bade  
The listeners’ hearts to thoughts they could not name.  
Shame changed to strong desire, desire seemed shame,  
And trembled; and such words the lover heard  
As in the middle of the night afeard  
He once was wont alone to whisper low  
Unto himself, for fear the day should know  
What his love really was; the longing eyes  
That unabashed were wont to make arise  
The blush of shame to bosom and grave brow,  
Beholding all their fill, were downcast now;  
The eager heart shrank back, the cold was moved,  
Wooed was the wooer, the lover was beloved.

   But yet indeed from wise Bellerophon  
Right little by Queen Venus’ wiles was won:  
Joyous he was, but nowise would forget  
That long and changing might his life be yet,  
Nor deemed he had to do with such things now,  
So let all pass, e’en as a painted show.  
But the Queen hoped belike, and many a prayer  
That morn had made to Venus’ image fair;  
And as the day wore, hushed she grew at whiles  
And pale; and sick and scornful were her smiles, <span id="page_139">p.
139</span>  
Nor knew her heart what words her lips might say.

   So through its changing hours went by the day,  
And when at last they sang the sun a-down,  
And, singing, watched the moon rise, and the town  
Was babbling through the clear eve, saddened now,  
And faint and weary went, with footsteps slow,  
The lover and beloved, to e’en such rest  
As they might win; and soon the daisies, pressed  
By oft-kissed dainty feet and panting side,  
Now with the dew were growing satisfied,  
And sick blind passion now no more might spoil  
The place made beautiful by patient toil  
Of many a man. And now Bellerophon  
Slept light and sweetly as the night wore on,  
Nor dreamed about the morrow; but the Queen  
Rose from her bed, and, like a sin unseen,  
Stole from the house, and, barefoot as she was,  
Through the dark belt of whispering trees did pass  
That girt the fair feast's pleasant place around:  
And when she came unto that spot of ground  
Whereas she deemed Bellerophon had lain,  
Then low adown she lay, and as for pain  
She moaned, and on the dew she laid her cheek,  
Then raised her head, and cried:  
                                  "Now may I speak,  
Now may I speak, since none can hear me now  
But thou, O Love, thou of the bitter bow.  
Didst thou not see, O Citheræa's son, <span id="page_140">p.
140</span>  
Thine image, that men call Bellerophon?  
Thine image, with the heart of stone, the eyes  
Of fire, those forgers of all miseries?  
And shall I bear thy burden all alone,  
In silent places making my low moan?  
Nay, but once more I try it—help thou me,  
Or on the earth a strange deed shalt thou see.  
Lo, now! thou knowest what my will has been:  
Day after day his fair face have I seen  
And made no sign—thus had I won him soon.  
But thou, the dreadful sun, the cruel moon,  
The scents, the flowers, the half-veiled nakedness  
Of wanton girls, my heart did so oppress,  
That now the chain is broken—Didst thou see  
How when he turned his cruel face on me  
He laughed?—he laughed, nor would behold my heart—  
He laughed, to think at last he had a part  
In joyous life without me: here, e’en here,  
He drank, rejoicing much, still drawing near,  
As the fool thought, to riches and renown.  
And such an one wilt thou not cast adown  
When thou rememberest how he came to me  
With wan worn cheek?—Ah, sweet he was to see!  
I loved him then—how can I love him now,  
So changed, so changed?  
                         "But thou—what doest thou?  
Hast thou forgotten how thy temples stand,  
Made rich with gifts, in many a luckless land? <span id="page_141">p.
141</span>  
Hast thou forgotten what strange rites are done  
To gain thy goodwill underneath the sun?  
Thou art asleep, then! Wake!—the world will end  
Because thou sleepest—e’en now doth it wend  
Unto the sickening end of all delights;  
Black, black the days are, dull grey are the nights,  
No more the night hides shame, no more the day  
Unto the rose-strewn chamber lights the way;  
And folk begin to curse thee, '*Love is gone,  
Grey shall the earth be, filled with rocks alone,  
Because the generations shall die out;  
Grey shall the earth be, lonely, wrapped about  
With cloudy memories of the moans of men*.'  
Thus, thus they curse. Shall I not curse thee then,  
Thou who tormentest me and leav’st me lone,  
Nor thinkest once of all that thou hast done?—  
Spare me! What cruel God taught men to speak,  
To cast forth words that for all good are weak  
And strong for all undoing?—thou know’st this,  
O lovely one! take not all hope of bliss  
Away from me, because my eager prayer  
Grows like unto a curse. O great and fair,  
Hearken a little, for to-morn must I  
Speak once again of love to him, or die;  
Hast thou no dream to send him, such as thou  
Hast shown to me so many a time or now?  
Wilt thou not make him weep without a cause,  
As I have done, as sleep her dark veil draws  
From off his head? or his awaking meet <span id="page_142">p.
142</span>  
With lovely images, so soft and sweet  
That they, forgotten quite, yet leave behind  
Great yearning for bright eyes and touches kind.  
Alas, alas! wilt thou not change mine eyes,  
Or else blind his, the cold, the over-wise?  
O Love, he knows my heart, and what it is—  
No fool he is to cast away his bliss  
On such as me: nay, rather he will take  
Some grey-eyed girl to love him for his sake,  
Not for her own—he knows me, and therefore  
I, grovelling here where he has lain, the more  
Must burn for him—he knows me; and thou, too,  
Better than I, knowest what I shall do.  
O Love, thou knowest all, yet since I live  
A little joyance hope to me doth give;  
Wilt thou not grant me now some sign, O Love;  
Wilt thou not redden this dark sky, or move  
Those stark hard walls, or make the spotted thrush  
Cry as in morn through this dark scented hush?"

   She ceased, and leaned back, kneeling, and all spent  
And panting, with her trembling fingers rent  
The linen from her breast, and, with shut eyes,  
Waited awhile as for some great surprise,  
But yet heard nothing stranger or more loud  
Than the leaves’ rustle; a long bank of cloud  
Lay in the south, low down, and scarcely seen  
‘Gainst the grey sky, and when at last the Queen  
Opened her eyes, she started eagerly, <span id="page_143">p.
143</span>  
Although the strangest thing her eyes could see  
Was but the summer lightning playing there;  
Then she put back her over-hanging hair,  
And in a hard and grating voice she said:  
   "O Sthenobœa, art thou then afraid  
Of a god's presence?—did a god e’er come  
To help a good and just man when his home  
Was turned to hell? I was but praying here  
Unto myself, who to myself am dear  
Alone of all things, mine own self to aid.  
And therewithal I needs must grow afraid  
E’en of myself—O wretch, unholpen still,  
To-morrow early thou shalt surely fill  
The measure of thy woe—and then—and then—  
Alas for me! What cruellest man of men  
Had made me this, and left me even thus?"

   Unto the sky wild eyes and piteous  
She turned, and gat unto her feet once more,  
And, led by use, came back unto the door  
Whence she went out, and with no stealthy tread,  
Careless of all things, gat her to her bed,  
And there at last, in grief and care's despite,  
Slept till the world had long forgotten night.

   Bellerophon arose the morrow morn  
Unlike the man that once had been forlorn;  
Bright-eyed and merry was he, and such fear  
As yet clung round him did but make joy dear, <span id="page_144">p.
144</span>  
And more in hope he was, and knew not why,  
Than any day that yet had passed him by.  
Now ere the freshness of the morn had died,  
Restless with happiness, he thought to ride  
Unto a ship, that in a little bay  
Anigh to Phlius, bound for outlands, lay,  
Unto whose Phrygian master had the King  
Given commands to buy him many a thing,  
And soon he sailed, since fair was grown the wind.  
   But as Bellerophon in such a mind  
Passed slow along the marble cloister-wall,  
He heard a voice his name behind him call,  
And turning, saw the Thracian maiden fair,  
Leucippe, coming swiftly toward him there,  
Who when she reached him stayed, and drawing breath  
As one who rests, said, "Sir, my mistress saith  
That she awhile is fain to speak with thee  
Before thou goest down unto the sea;  
And in her bower for thee doth she abide."  
He gave her some light word, and side by side  
The twain passed toward the bower, he all the while  
Noting the Thracian with a well-pleased smile;  
For his fear slept, or he felt strong enow  
Things good and ill unto his will to bow.  
Yet was the gentle Thracian pale that day,  
And still she seemed as she some word would say  
Unto him, that her lips durst not to frame;  
And when unto the Queen's bower-door they came, <span id="page_145">p.
145</span>  
And he passed there, and it was shut on him,  
She lingered still, and through her body slim  
A tremor ran, her pale face waxed all red,  
And her lips moved as though some word they said  
She durst not utter loud; then she looked down  
Upon her bare feet and her slave's wool gown,  
And to her daily task straight took her way.

   Now on his throne King Prœtus judged that day,  
And heard things dull, things strange, but when at last  
The summer noon now by an hour had passed,  
He went to meat, and thought to see thereat  
Bellerophon's frank face, who ever sat  
At his right hand; but empty was his place.  
And when the King, who fain had seen his face,  
Asked whither he was gone, a certain man  
Said: "King, I saw the brave Corinthian,  
Two hours agone, pass through the outer door,  
And in his face there seemed a trouble sore,  
So that I needs must ask him what was wrong;  
But staring at me as he went along,  
Silent he passed, as if he heard me not;  
Afoot he was, nor weapon had he got."  
   The King's face clouded, but the meal being done  
In his fair chariot did he get him gone  
Unto the haven, where the Phrygian ship  
Was waiting his last word her ropes to slip;  
Restless he was, and wished that night were come.  
But ere he left the fair porch of his home, <span id="page_146">p.
146</span>  
Unto the Queen a messenger he sent,  
And bade her know whereunto now he went,  
And prayed her go with him; but presently  
Back came the messenger, and said that she  
Was ill at ease and in her bower would bide,  
For scarcely she upon that day might ride.  
   So at that word of hers the Argive King  
Went on his way, but somewhat muttering,  
For heavy thoughts were gathering round his heart;  
But when he came where, ready to depart,  
The ship lay, with the bright-eyed master there  
Some talk he had, who said the wind was fair  
And all things ready; then the King said, "Friend,  
To-morrow's noon I deem will make an end  
Of this thy lingering; I will send to thee  
A messenger to tell the certainty  
Of my last wishes, who shall bring thee gold  
And this same ring that now thou dost behold  
Upon my finger, for a token sure  
Farewell, and may thy good days long endure."

   He turned, but backward sent his eyes awhile,  
Sighing, though on his lips there was a smile;  
The half-raised sail that clung unto the mast,  
The tinkling ripple ’gainst the black side cast,  
The thin blue smoke that from the poop arose,  
The northland dog that midst of ropes did doze,  
The barefoot shipmen's eyes upon him bent,  
Curious and half-defiant, as they went <span id="page_147">p.
147</span>  
About their work—all these things raised in him  
Desire for roving—stirred up thoughts that, dim  
At this time, clear at that, still oft he had,  
That there his life was not so overglad;  
And as toward Argos now he rode along  
By the grey sea, the shipmen's broken song  
Smote on his ear and with the low surf's fall  
Mingled, and seemed to him perchance to call  
To freedom and a life not lived in vain.

   But even so his palace did he gain,  
And the dull listless day slipped into night,  
And smothering troublous thoughts e’en as he might,  
Did he betake himself to bed, and there  
Lay half-asleep beneath the tester fair,  
Waiting until the low-voiced flutes gave sign  
That thither drew the Lycian's feet divine—  
For so the wont was, that she still was led  
Unto her chamber as a bride new-wed.

   Of that sweet sound nought heard the King at all,  
But straightway into a short sleep did fall,  
Then woke as one who knoweth certainly  
That all the hours he now shall hear pass by,  
Nor sleep until the sun is up again.  
So, waking, did he hear a cry of pain  
Within the chamber, and thereat adrad  
He turned him round, and saw the Queen, so clad  
That on her was her raiment richly wrought, <span id="page_148">p.
148</span>  
Yet in such case as though hard fate had brought  
Some bane of Kings into the royal place,  
And with that far-removed and dainty grace  
The rough hands of some outland foe had dealt;  
For dragged athwart her was the jewelled belt,  
Rent and disordered the Phœnician gown,  
The linen from her shoulders dragged adown,  
Her arms and glorious bosom made half-bare,  
And furthermore such shameful signs were there,  
As though not long past hands had there been laid  
Heavier than touches of the tiring-maid.

   So swiftly through the place from end to end  
She paced, but yet stopped now and then to send  
Low bitter moans forth on the scented air;  
And through the King's heart shot a bitter fear,  
Nor could he move—he had believed her cold,  
And wise to draw herself from pleasure's hold  
When it began to sting the heart—but now  
What shameful thing would these last minutes show?

   Now as she went a look askance she cast  
Upon the King, and turning at the last,  
With strange eyes drew anigh the royal bed,  
And, with clasped hands, before him stood, and said:  
   "Thou wakest, then? thou wonderest at this sight?  
I have a tale to tell to thee this night  
I cannot utter, unless words are taught  
Unto my lips to draw forth all my thought— <span id="page_149">p.
149</span>  
Thou wonderest at my words? Then ask, then ask!  
The sooner will be done my heavy task."

   Upright in bed the King sat, pale with doubt  
And gathering fear; his right hand he stretched out  
To take the Queen's hand, but aback she drew,  
Shuddering; and half he deemed the truth he knew,  
As o’er her pale face and her bosom came  
Beneath his gaze a flush as if of shame:  
"Wilt thou not speak, and make an end?" she cried.  
   Then he spake slowly, "Why dost thou abide  
Without my bed to-night? why dost thou groan,  
Whom I ere now no love-sick girl have known?"

   She covered up her face at that last word;  
The thick folds of her linen gown were stirred  
As her limbs writhed beneath them—nought she said,  
As though the word was not remembered  
She had to say; and, loth the worst to hear,  
The King awhile was tongue-tied by his fear.

   At last the words came: "Thou bad’st ask of thee  
Why thou to-night my playmate wouldst not be—  
What hast thou done? Speak quickly of the thing!"

   She drew her hands away, and cried, "O King,  
Art thou awake yet, that this shameful guise  
Seems nothing strange unto thy drowsy eyes,  
Wilt thou not ask why this and this is torn? <span id="page_150">p.
150</span>  
Why this is bruised? Lo, since the long-passed morn  
Thus have I sat, that thou e’en this might see,  
And ask what madness there has been in me.  
Thus have I sat, and cursed the God who made  
The day so long, the night so long delayed.  
   "Ask! thou art happy that the Lycian sod  
Unwearied oft my virgin feet have trod  
From dawn to dusk; that in the Lycian wood  
Before wild things untrembling I have stood;  
That this right arm so oft the javelin threw—  
These fingers rather the grey bowstring knew  
Than the gold needle: even so, indeed,  
Of more than woman's strength had I had need  
If with a real man I had striven to-day;  
But he who would have shamed thee went his way  
Like a scourged woman—thou wilt spare him, then—  
Lay down thy sword!—that is for manly men."

   For while she spake, and in her eyes did burn  
The fires of hate, the King's face had waxed stern,  
And ere her bitter speech was fully o’er,  
He had arisen, and from off the floor  
Had gat his proven sword into his hand,  
And eager by the trembling Queen did stand,  
And cried, "Nay, hold! for surely I know well  
What tale it is thy lips to-night would tell;  
Therefore my sword befits me, the tried friend  
That many a troublous thing has brought to end.  
Yet fear not, for another friend have I <span id="page_151">p.
151</span>  
To help me deal with this new villany,  
Even the godlike man Bellerophon;  
So with one word thy heavy task is done.  
—O Sthenobœa, speak the name of him  
Who wrought this deed, then let that name wax dim  
Within thy mind till it is dead and past;  
For, certes, yesterday he saw the last  
Of setting suns his doomed eyes shall behold."

   Pale as a corpse she waxed, and stony cold  
Amidst these words; silent awhile she was  
After the last word from the King did pass,  
But in a low voice at the last she said:  
   "Yea, for this deed of his must he be dead?  
And must he be at peace, because he strove  
To take from me honour, and peace, and love?  
Must a great King do thus? or hast thou not  
Some lightless place in mighty Argos got  
Where nought can hap to break the memory  
Of what he hoped in other days might be;  
For great he has been, and of noble birth  
As any man who dwelleth on the earth.  
—Thou hast forgotten that the dead shall rest,  
Whate’er they wrought on earth of worst or best."

   But the King gazed upon her gloomily,  
And said, "Nay, nay;—the man shall surely die—  
His hope die with him, is it not enow?  
But no such mind I bear in me as thou, <span id="page_152">p.
152</span>  
Who speakest not as a great Queen should speak,  
But rather as a girl made mad and weak  
By hope delayed and love cast back again,  
Who knoweth not her words are words and vain.  
Content thee, thou art loved and honoured still—  
Speak forth the name of him who wrought the ill,  
For I am fain to meet Bellerophon,  
So that we twain may do what must be done."

   He spake, but mid the tumult of her mind  
She heard him not, and deaf she was and blind  
To all without, nor knew she if her feet  
The marble cold or red-hot iron did meet.  
She moved not and she felt not, but a sound  
Came from her lips, and smote the air around  
With slow hard words:  
                     "Ah! thou hast named him then  
Twice in this hour alone of earthly men;  
That same Bellerophon, that all folk love,  
In manly wise this morn against me strove!"

   Ah, how the world was changed, as she went by  
The King, bewildered with new misery—  
Ah, and how little time it was agone  
When all that deed of hers was not yet done,  
When yet she might have died for him, and made  
A little love her lonely tomb to shade  
Spring up within his heart—when hope there was  
Of many a thing that yet might come to pass—  
And now, and now—those spoken words must be <span id="page_153">p.
153</span>  
A part of her, an unwrought misery  
That would not let her rest till all was o’er,—  
Nay, nay, no rest upon the shadowy shore.

   Slowly she left the chamber, none the less  
With measured steps her feet the floor did press  
As a Queen's should, nor fainted she at all,  
But straight unto the door ’twixt wall and wall  
She went, and still perchance had forced a smile  
Had she met any one; and all the while  
Set in such torment as men cannot name,  
If she did think, wondered that still the same  
Were all things round her as they had been erst—  
That the house fell not—that the feet accurst  
To carry her yet left no sign in blood  
Of where the wretchedest on earth had stood—  
That round about her still her raiment clung—  
That no great sudden pain her body stung,  
No inward flame her false white limbs would burn,  
Or into horror all her beauty turn—  
That still the gentle sounds of night were there  
As she had known them: the light summer air  
Within the thick-leaved trees, as she passed by  
Some open window, and the nightbird's cry  
From far; the gnat's thin pipe about her head,  
The wheeling moth delaying to be dead  
Within the taper's flame—yea, certainly  
Shall things about her as they have been be,  
And even that a torment now has grown. <span id="page_154">p.
154</span>  
   Yet must she reap the grain that she has sown;  
No thought of turning back was in her heart,  
No more in those past days can she have part;  
Nay, when her glimmering bower she came unto,  
She muttered through the dusk, "As I would do  
So have I done—so would I do again."

   Lo, thus in unimaginable pain  
Leave we her now, and to the King turn back;  
Who stood there overwhelmed by sudden lack  
Of what he leaned on—with his life left bare  
Of a great pleasure that was growing there.  
A storm of rage swept through his heart, to think  
That he of such a cup as this must drink;  
For if he doubted aught, this was his doubt,  
That all the tale was not told fully out—  
That for Bellerophon the Queen's great scorn  
And loathing was a thing but newly born—  
That bitter hate was but a lover's hate,  
Which even yet beneath the hand of fate  
Might turn to hottest love. He groaned thereat,  
And staggering back, upon the bed he sat;  
His bright sword from his hand had fallen down  
When that last dreadful word at him was thrown,  
And now, with head sunk ’twixt his hands, he sought  
Some outlet from the weary girth of thought  
That hemmed him in.  
                       "And must I slay him then,  
Him whom I loved above all earthly men? <span id="page_155">p.
155</span>  
Behold, if now I slept here, and next morn,  
Ere the day's memory should be fully born  
From out of sleep, men came and said to me,  
'Sire, the Corinthian draweth nigh to thee,'  
My first thought would be joy that he had come.  
And yet I am a King, nor shall my home  
Become a brothel before all men's eyes.  
He who drinks deadly poison surely dies,  
And he hath drunk, and must abide the end.  
Yet hath the image of him been my friend—  
What shall I do? Not lightly can I bear  
The voice of men about these things to hear;  
'He trusted him, he thought himself right wise  
To look into men's souls through lips and eyes—  
—Behold the end!—' Yea, and most certainly  
I will not bear once more his face to see;  
Nor in the land where he was purified  
Shall grass or marble by his blood be dyed,  
Since he must go—green grew a bough of spring  
Amidst the barren death of many a thing;  
Not barren it, since poison fruits it bore—  
Behold now, I, who loved my life of yore,  
Begin to weary that I e’er was born;  
But let it pass—rather let good men mourn;  
Great men, the earth's salt, wear their lives away  
In weeping for the ne’er-returning day:  
For surely all is good enough for me.  
   "And yet alas! what truth there seemed in thee—  
—What can I do? Might he not die in war? <span id="page_156">p.
156</span>  
Nay, but at peace through him my borders are.  
He shall not die here—the deep sea were good  
To hide the story of his untamed blood—  
Or, further—O thou fool, that so must make  
My life so dull, e’en for a woman's sake!  
There in that land, then, shall thy bones have rest  
Beneath the sod her worshipped feet have pressed.  
In Lycia shalt thou die; her father's hand  
Shall draw the sword, or his lips give command  
To make an end of thee—So shall it be,  
And that swift Phrygian ready now for sea  
Shall bear thee hence—Would I had known thee not;  
A new pain hast thou been—a heavy lot  
My life in early morn to me shall seem,  
When I have dreamed that all was but a dream,  
And waked to truth again and lonely life.  
   "Let be; now must I forge the hidden knife  
Against thee, and I would the thing were done.  
Thou mayst not die so; thou art such an one  
As the Gods love, whatever thou mayst do,  
Perchance they pay small heed to false or true  
In such as we are. But the lamps burn low,  
The night wears, grey the eastern sky doth grow;  
I must forget thee; fellow, fare thee well,  
Who might have turned my feet from lonely hell!"

   So saying, slowly, as a man who needs  
Must do a deed that woe and evil breeds,  
He rose, and took his writing tools to him. <span id="page_157">p.
157</span>  
And ere the day had made the tapers dim,  
Two letters with his own hand had he made,  
And open was the first one, and it said  
'These words:  
                    *Unto the wise Bellerophon—  
To Lycia the Gods call thee, O my son;  
So when thou hast this letter in thine hand,  
Abide no longer in the Argive land  
Than if thou fleddest some avenging man,  
But make good speed to that swift Phrygian  
Who for the southlands saileth this same day.  
Take thou this gold for furtherance and stay,  
And this for his reward who rules the heel,  
And for a token show him this my seal.  
This casket to the Lycian king bear forth,  
That hath in it a thing of greatest worth;  
And let no hand be laid on it but thine  
Till in Jobates’ hands its gold doth shine.  
Then bid him mind how that he had of me  
When last I saw his face the fellow key  
To that which in mine hands doth open it*—

   Awhile the King had stayed when this was writ,  
And on the gathering greyness of the morn  
Long fixed his eyes, unseeing and forlorn,  
Then o’er the tablets moved his hand again.

   *Mayst thou do well among these outland men.  
Perchance my face thou never more shalt see*, <span id="page_158">p.
158</span>  
*Perchance but little more remains to thee  
Of thy loved life—thou wert not one to cry  
Curses on all because life passeth by.  
If woe befalls thee there, think none the less  
That I erewhile have wrought thee happiness;  
Farewell! and ask thou not to see me first:  
Life worsens here, and ere it reach the worst,  
Unto the Jove that may be would I speak  
To help my people, wandering blind and weak*.

   Another letter by the King's side lay,  
But closed and sealed; so in the twilight grey  
Now did he rise, and summoned presently  
A slumbering chamberlain that was thereby,  
And bade him toward the treasury lead, and take  
Two leathern bags for that same errand's sake;  
So forth the twain went to that golden place;  
But when they were therein, a mournful face  
Still the King seemed to see, e’en as it was  
When he from room to room with him did pass  
Who now had wronged him; then the gold waxed dim,  
For bitter pain his vexed heart wrought for him,  
And filled with unused tears his hard wise eyes.  
But choking back the thronging memories,  
He laid the letter that he erst did hold  
Within a casket wrought of steel and gold,  
Which straight he locked; then bade his fellow fill  
The bags he bore from a great golden hill,  
Then to his room, made cold with morn, returned; <span id="page_159">p.
159</span>  
And since for change and some swift deed he yearned,  
He bade his chamberlain bring hunter's weed,  
And saddle him straightway his fleetest steed:  
"And see," said he, "before the Prince arise  
Ye show this letter to his waking eyes,  
And give into his hands these things ye see;  
And make good speed, the time grows short for me."  
   So spake he, and there grew on him a thought  
That thither might Bellerophon be brought  
Ere he could get him gone; and therewithal  
At last the low sun topped the garden-wall,  
And o’er the dewy turf long shadows threw;  
Then, being new clad, the porch he hurried to,  
And paced betwixt its pillars feverishly,  
Until he heard the horse-boys’ cheery cry  
And the sharp clatter of the well-shod feet;  
Then he ran out, the joyous steed to meet,  
And mounted, and rode forth, he scarce knew where,  
Until the town was passed, and ’twixt the fair  
Green corn-fields of the June-tide he drew rein,  
To ponder on his life, so spoiled and vain.

   But when Bellerophon awoke that morn,  
Weary he felt, as though he long had borne  
Some heavy load, and his perplexed heart  
Must chide the life wherein he had a part.  
But ere he gat him down to meet the day  
With its new troubles, ’thwart his weary way  
Was come that chamberlain, who bade him read, <span id="page_160">p.
160</span>  
And say what other thing he yet might need.  
   He read, and knit his anxious brows in thought,  
For in his mind great doubt that letter brought  
If yet he were in friendship with the King;  
And therewith came a dark imagining  
Of unseen dangers, and great anger grew  
Within his soul, as if the worst were true  
Of all he thought might be; and in his mind  
It was, that going, he might leave behind  
A bitter word to pay for broken troth:  
And still the King's man saw that he was wroth,  
And watched him curiously, till he had read  
The letter thrice, but nought to him he said.  
   At last he spake, "Sir, even as the King  
Now bids me, will I make no tarrying;  
And as I carne to Argos, even so,  
Unfriended, bearing nothing, will I go;  
And few farewells are best to-day, I deem,  
For like a banished man I would not seem  
Among these folk that love me: get we gone,  
And tell the King his full will shall be done."

   So forth they ride, and ever as the way  
Lengthened behind them, and the summer day  
Grew hotter on the lovely teeming earth,  
The fresh soft air and sounds and sights of mirth  
Wrought on Bellerophon, until it seemed  
That things might not be e’en as he had deemed  
At first. "What thoughts are mine; have I not had <span id="page_161">p.
161</span>  
Gifts from his hands—hath he not made me glad  
When I was sorry? Therefore will I take  
What chance there lies herein for honour's sake.  
Nay, more, and may not friendship lie herein?—  
May he not drive me forth from shame and sin  
And evil fate? Well, howsoe’er it is,  
But little evil do I see in this:  
Yea, I may see his face again once more,  
And crowned with honour come back to this shore,  
For now I fear nought—if he thinks to see  
Some evil thing that nowise is in me,  
Another day the truth of all will show.  
Let pass, again from out the place I go  
Wherein the sport of fortune I have tried;  
If it has failed me, yet the world is wide  
And I am young. Now go I forth alone  
To do what in my life must needs be done,  
And in my own hands lies my fate, I think,  
And I shall mix the cup that I must drink:  
So be it; thus the world is merrier,  
And I shall be a better man than here."

   Amid these thoughts, unto the ship he came,  
And higher yet sprang up the new-stirred flame  
Of great desires when first he saw the sea  
Leap up against her black sides lovingly,  
And heard the sails flap, and the voice of folk,  
Who at the sight of him in shouts outbroke,  
Since they withal were eager to be gone. <span id="page_162">p.
162</span>  
And now were all things done that should be done;  
The money rendered up, the King's seal shown,  
Unto the master all his will made known,  
And on the deck stood the Corinthian.  
As up the mast clattering the great rings ran,  
And back the hawser to the ship was cast,  
The helmsman took the tiller, and at last  
The head swung round, trimly the great sail drew,  
The broad bows pierced the land of fishes through,  
Unheard the red wine fell from out the cup  
Into the noisy sea; and then rose up  
The cloud of incense-smoke a little way,  
But driven from the prow, with the white spray  
It mingled, and a little dimmed the crowd  
Of white-head braves; then rose the sea-song loud,  
While on the stern still stood Bellerophon,  
Bidding farewell to what of life was gone,  
Pensive, but smiling somewhat to behold  
The lengthening wake, and field, and hill, and wold,  
And white-walled Argos growing small astern,  
That he the pleasure of the gods might learn. <span id="page_163">p.
163</span>

 

 

BUT when the King's man, with a doubtful smile,  
Had watched the parting sails a little while,  
He turned about, revolving many things  
Within his mind, of the weak hearts of kings,  
Because the Prince's glory seemed grown dim,  
And nowise grand this parting seemed to him;  
"For day-long leave-taking there should have been,"  
He grumbled, "and fair tables well beseen  
Should have been spread the gilded ship anigh,  
And many a perfect beast been slain thereby  
Unto the gods—Had this Bellerophon  
Too great fame for the King of Argos won?  
I will be lowly, for no little bliss  
I have in Argos, a good place it is—  
Or else what thing has happed?"  
                                   Howe’er it was,  
Slowly again to Argos did he pass,  
And here and there he spake upon that day  
Of how Bellerophon had gone away,  
Perchance as one who would no more return;  
And sore hearts were there, who thereat must yearn  
To see the face that let a weak hope live;  
And folk still doomed with many things to strive,  
Who found him helpful—few indeed were there  
Who did not pray that well he still might fare  
Whereso he was, and few forgot him quite  
For many a day and many a changing night. <span id="page_164">p.
164</span>  
   But Sthenobœa, when she knew that morn  
That she was not alone of love forlorn,  
But of the thing too that fed love in her,  
Yet coldly at the first her lot did bear  
In outward seeming: in no other wise  
She sat among her maids than when his eyes  
Had first met hers. "No babble shall there be  
In this fool's land concerning him and me.  
Gone is he,—let him die and be forgot:  
Cold is my heart that yesterday was hot,  
Quenched is the fervent flame of yesterday;  
Past is the time when I had cast away,  
If he had bidden me, name, and fame, and all:  
Now in this dulls world e’en let things befall  
As they are fated; I am stirred no more  
By any hap—hope, hate, and love are o’er."  
   So spake she in the morn, when, still a Queen,  
She sat among her folk as she had been,  
Dreaded, unloved; yet as the day wore on  
She felt as though it never would be done.  
And now she took to wandering restlessly,  
And set her face to go unto the sea,  
But soon turned back, and through the palace ranged,  
And thought she thought not of him, and yet changed  
Her face began to grow; and if she spoke,  
As one untroubled, aught unto her folk,  
Her speech grew wild and broken ere its end;  
And as about the place she still did wend,  
More than its wonted chill her presence threw <span id="page_165">p.
165</span>  
On those who of her coming footsteps knew—  
Yea, as she passed by some, she even thought  
A look like pity to their eyes was brought,  
And then, amidst her craving agony,  
Must she grow red with wrath that such could be.

   Now came the night, and she must cast aside  
All semblance of her coldness and her pride,  
And find the weary night was longer yet  
Than was the day, and harder to forget  
The thoughts that came therewith. How can I tell  
In any words the torment of that hell,  
That she for her own soul had fashioned so,  
That from it never any path did go  
To lands of rest, no window was therein,  
Through which there shone a hope of happier sin;  
But close the fiery walls about her glared,  
And on one dreadful picture still she stared,  
Intent on that desire, that dreadful love,  
The dullness of her savage heart that clove  
With wasting fire, a bane to her, and all  
Who in the net of her vain life might fall.

   The next day wore, and thereto followed night,  
And changed through dark and dusk and dawn to light;  
And when at last high-risen was the sun,  
The women came to do what should be done  
In the Queen's chamber: water for the bath  
They brought, and dainties such as Venus hath; <span id="page_166">p.
166</span>  
Gold combs, embroidered cloths, pearl-threaded strings,  
Such unguents as the hidden river brings  
Through strange-wrought caverns down into a sea  
Where seldom any keel of man may be;  
Fine Indian webs, the work of many a year,  
And incense that the bleeding tree doth bear  
Lone in the desert;—yea, and fear withal  
Of what new thing upon that day might fall  
From her they served, for on the day now dead  
Wild words, strange threatenings had her writhed lips said.  
But when within the chamber door they were,  
A new hope grew within them, a new fear,  
For empty ’neath the golden canopy  
The bed lay, and when one maid drew anigh,  
She saw that all untouched the linen was  
As for that night; so when it came to pass  
That in no chamber of that house of gold  
Might any one the Lycian's face behold,  
Nor any sign of her, then therewithal  
To others of the household did they call,  
And asked if they had tidings of the Queen;  
And when they found that she had not been seen  
Since at the end of day to bed she passed,  
Within their troubled minds the thing they cast,  
And thus remembered that at whiles of late  
She had been wont the rising sun to wait  
Within the close below her bower; so then  
They called together others, maids and men, <span id="page_167">p.
167</span>  
And passed with troubled eyes adown the stair;  
And coming to the postern-door that there  
Led out into the pleasance, that they found  
Still open, and thereby upon the ground,  
And on a jagged bough of creeping vine,  
Gold threads they saw, and silken broidery fine,  
That well they knew torn from the Lycian's gown;  
Therewith with hasty feet were trodden down  
The beds of summer flowers that lay between  
The outer wicket of that garden green  
And the bower-door—feet that had heeded nought  
By what wild ways they to their end were brought;  
Then by the gate where the faint sweetbriar-rose  
Grew thick about the edges of the close,  
Had one pushed through their boughs in such a way  
That fragments of a dainty thin array  
Yet fluttered on the thorns in the light breeze,  
Nor might they doubt who once had carried these.  
   But when the pleasance-gate they had passed through,  
At first within the lingering strip of dew  
Beneath the wall, footprints they well could see;  
But as the shadow failed them presently,  
And little could the close-cropped summer grass  
Tell them of feet that might have chanced to pass  
Thereby before the dawn, their steps they stayed,  
And this and that thing there betwixt them weighed  
With many words; then splitting up their band,  
Some took the way unto the well-tilled land,  
Some seaward went, and some must turn their feet <span id="page_168">p.
168</span>  
Unto the wood: yet did not any meet  
A further sign; and though some turned again  
To tell the tale at once, yet all in vain  
Did horsemen scour the country far and wide,  
And vainly was the sleuth-hounds’ mettle tried—  
—Gone was the Lycian, and in such a guise  
That silence seemed the best word for the wise.  
But many a babbling tongue in Argos was,  
Who for no gold had let such matters pass;  
And some there were who, mindful of her face  
As down the street she passed in queenly grace,  
Said that some god had seen her even as they,  
And with no will that longer she should stay  
Midst dying men, had taken her to his home—  
"And we are left behind," they said; but some,  
Who had been nigher to her, said that she,  
Smitten by some benign divinity  
Who loved the world and lovely Argos well,  
Had fled with changed heart far from man to dwell—  
Yea, and might be a goddess even yet.  
But other folk, well ready to forget  
Her bitter soul, and well content to bear  
The changed life that she erst had filled with care,  
Smiled, and said yea to better and to worse,  
But inly thought that many a heart-felt curse  
Her careless ears had heard upon the earth  
Had not returned to where it had its birth.

   The Gods are kind, and hope to men they give <span id="page_169">p.
169</span>  
That they their little span on earth may live,  
Nor yet faint utterly; the Gods are kind,  
And will not suffer men all things to find  
They search for, nor the depth of all to know  
They fain would learn: and it was even so  
With Sthenobœa; for a fisher old  
That day a tale unto his carline told,  
E’en such as this:  
                   "When I last night had laid  
The boat up ’neath the high cliff, and had made  
All things about it trim, and left thee here,  
Even as thou knowest, I set out to bear  
Those mullets unto Argos. Nought befell  
At first whereof is any need to tell,  
But when the night had now grown very old,  
And, as my wont is, I was waxing bold,  
And thinking of the bright returning day,  
That drives the sprites of wood and wave away,  
As the path leads, I entered the beech-wood  
Which, close to where the ancient palace stood,  
Clothes the cliff's edge; I entered warily,  
Yet thought no evil thing therein to see.  
Scarce lighter than dark night it was therein,  
Though swift without the day on night did win.  
So I went on, I say, and had no fear,  
So nigh to day; but getting midmost, where  
Thinner it grows and lighter, toward the sea,  
I stayed my whistling, for it seemed to me  
The wind moaned louder than it should have done, <span id="page_170">p.
170</span>  
Because of wind without was well-nigh none.  
When I stood still it ended, and again,  
E’en as I moved, I seemed to hear it plain.  
Trembling, I stopped once more, and heard indeed  
A sound as though one moaned in bitter need,  
Clearer than was the moaning of the surf,  
Now muffled by a rising bank of turf  
On the cliff's edge; fear-stricken, yet in doubt,  
Through the grey glimmer now I peered about,  
And turned unto the sea: then my heart sank,  
For by the tree the nighest to that bank  
A white thing stood, like, as I now could see,  
The daughters of us sons of misery,  
Though such I deemed her not—and yet had I  
No will or power to turn about and fly;  
And now it moaned and moaned, and seemed to writhe  
Against the tree its body long and lithe.  
Long gazed I, while still colourless and grey,  
But swift enow, drew on the dawn of day;  
But as I trembled there, at last I heard  
How in a low voice it gave forth this word:

   "*What say’st thou?—'Live on still—I loved thee not  
The while I lived; my bane from thee I got:  
And canst thou think that I shall love thee, then,  
Where no will is, or power to sons of men?'  
I know not, thou mayst hate me, yet I come  
That I may look on thee in that new home* <span id="page_171">p.
171</span>  
*My hands built for thee: if the priests speak truth,  
What heart thou hast may yet be stirred by ruth,  
When thy changed eyes behold the traitorous Queen  
Tormented for the vile thing she has been—  
If, as the books say, e’en such ways they have  
As we on this explored side of the grave.  
Yea, thou mayst pity then mine agony,  
When no more evil I can do to thee.  
Here on the earth I could not weep enow,  
Or show thee all my misery here, and thou  
Must ever look upon me as a Queen,  
Thy mistress and thy fear. Couldst thou have seen  
My weary ways upon this long, long night—  
Couldst thou behold the coming day's new sight,  
When round this tree the folk come gathering  
To see the wife and daughter of a King,  
Slain by her own hand, and in such a wise—  
O thou I hoped for once, might not thine eyes  
Have softened had they seen me shivering here,  
Alone, unholpen, sick with my first fear,  
Beat down by coming shame, and mocked by these  
Gay fluttering rags of dainty braveries  
That decked my state; by gold, and pearl, and gem,  
Over my wretched breast, set in the hem  
This night has torn, and o’er my bleeding feet;  
Mocked by this glittering girdle, nowise meet  
To do the hangman's office?—Couldst thou see  
That even so I needs must think of thee—  
Whom I have slain, whose eyes I have made blind*, <span id="page_172">p.
172</span>  
*Whose feet I stayed that me they might not find,  
That I might not be helped of any one?* 

   "The day was dawning when her words were done,  
And to her waist I saw her set her hand,  
And take the girdle thence, and therewith stand  
With arms that moved above her head a space  
Within the tree; and still she had her face  
Turned from me, and I stirred not, minding me  
Of tales of treacherous women of the sea,  
The bane of men; but now her arms down fell,  
And low she spake, yet could I hear her well:

   "*Thou bitter noose, that thus shalt end my days,  
Rather than blame, shalt thou have thanks and praise  
From all men: I have loved one man alone,  
And unto him the worst deed have I done  
Of all the ill deeds I have done on earth.  
—I curse men not, although midst mocks and mirth,  
They say, Rejoice, for Sthenobœa is dead*.'

   "I started forward as that word she said,  
And she beheld me—face to face we met  
In the grey light, nor shall I e’er forget  
Those dreadful eyes, for such indeed I deem  
A goddess high up in the heavens might seem  
If she should learn that all was changed, to bring  
Death on her head as on an earthly thing. <span id="page_173">p.
173</span>  
Alas! I have beheld men die ere now,  
But eld or sickness sore their hearts did bow  
With feebleness to bear what might betide,  
Or else mid hope of name and fame they died,  
And the world left them unawares; but she,  
Full of hot blood and life yet, I could see  
Was red-lipped as an image, and still had  
Such smooth, soft cheeks as made beholders glad:  
In many a feast and solemn sacrifice;  
But yet such dreadful hate was in her eyes,  
Such loathing of the ways of Gods and men,  
Such gathered-up despair, that truly then  
I shook so that my hands might hold no more  
The staff and half-filled basket that I bore.

   "But in a moment slowly she turned round,  
And toward the rising swarded space of ground  
Betwixt the beech-trees and the sea she went;  
And I, although I knew well her intent,  
Yet could not stir. There on the brink she stood;  
A cool sea-wind now swept into the wood,  
And drave her raiment round her; I could see,  
E’en in the dawn, that jewelled broidery  
Gleam in the torn folds of the glittering hem;  
And now she raised her arms, I saw on them  
Jewels again—Then sightless did I stand,  
For such a cry I heard, as though a hand  
Of fire upon her wasted heart was laid,  
And to and fro, I deem, a space she swayed <span id="page_174">p.
174</span>  
Her slender body; then I moved at last,  
And hurried toward the sheer cliff's edge full fast,  
But ere I reached the green brink, was she gone;  
And, hanging o’er the rugged edge alone,  
With trembling hands, far down did I behold  
A white thing meet the dark grey waves and cold;  
For overhanging is that foreland high,  
And little sand beneath its feet doth lie  
At lowest of the tide, and on that morn  
Against the scarped rock was the white surf borne.

   "Ah, long I looked before I turned away.  
No friend, indeed, was lost to me that day—  
I knew her not but by the people's voice,  
And they ’twas like hereat would e’en rejoice;  
Yet o’er my heart a yearning passion swept,  
And there where she had stood I lay and wept,  
Worn as I am by care and toil and eld.

   "But when I rose again, then I beheld  
The girdle to the rough bough hanging yet,  
And this I loosed and in my hand did get,  
And lingered for a while; then went my way,  
Nor thought at first if it were night or day,  
So much I pondered on the tale so wrought,  
What God to nothing such a life had brought.  
   "But when unto the city gate I came,  
I found the thronging people all aflame  
With many rumours, and this one they knew <span id="page_175">p.
175</span>  
Among all other guesses to be true,  
That of the Queen nought knew her wonted place;  
But unto me who still beheld that face  
There in the beech-wood, idle and base enow  
Seemed all that clamour carried to and fro—  
Curses and mocks, and foolish laughter loud,  
And gaping wonder of the empty crowd;  
So in great haste I got my errand done,  
And sold my wares e’en unto such an one  
As first remembered he must eat to-day,  
What king or queen soe’er had passed away.  
Thus I returned, bringing the belt with me—  
Behold it!—And what way seems best to thee  
To take herein?—Poor are we: these bright stones  
Would make us happier than the highest ones;  
Yet danger hangs thereby, nor have I yet  
My living from dead corpses had to get;  
Nay, scarcely can I deem this Queen will be  
At rest for long beneath the unquiet sea.  
—How say’st thou, shall I go unto the King,  
And tell him every word about the thing  
E’en as I know it?"  
                     "Nay, nay, nay," she said,  
"Certes but little do I fear the dead,  
Yet think thou not to call the girdle thine;  
With a man's death doth every gem here shine—  
Our deaths the first: but do thou bide at home,  
And let the King hear what may even come  
To a King's ears; meddle thou not, nor make <span id="page_176">p.
176</span>  
With any such; still shall the brass pot break  
The earthen pot—a lord is thanked for what  
A poor man often has in prison sat.  
But down the beach run thou thy shallop straight,  
And from the net take off the heaviest weight,  
And do this belt about it; and then go  
And in the deepest of the green bay sow  
This seed and fruit of love and wrath and crime,  
And let this tale be dealt with by great time;  
But ’twixt the sea and the green southering hill  
We will abide, peaceful if toilsome still."

   So was it done, and e’en as in her heart  
Was hidden from all eyes her traitrous part,  
So the sea hid her heart from all but those,  
Who, having passed through all eld's dreamy doze,  
Died with their tale untold.  
                             Time passed away,  
And dimmer grew her name day after day;  
And the fair place, where erst her eyes had chilled  
Sweet laughter into silence, now was filled  
By folk who, midst of fair life slipping by,  
No longer had her deeds in memory;  
There where she once had dwelt mid hate and praise,  
No smile, no shudder now her name could raise. <span id="page_177">p.
177</span>

 

 

THE night had fallen or ere the tale was done,  
And on the hall-floor now the pale moon shone  
In fitful gleams, for the snow fell no more,  
But ragged clouds still streamed the pale sky o’er:  
A while they sat, and seemed to hear the sea  
Beat ’gainst the ice-glazed cliffs unceasingly,  
Though nought belike that noise was but the wind  
Caught in some corner, half blocked-up and blind  
With the white drift:—just so the mournfulness  
Of the tale told out did their hearts oppress  
With seeming sorrow, for a glorious life  
Twisted awry and crushed dead in the strife  
Long ages past; while yet more like it was  
That with the old tale o’er their souls did pass  
Shades of their own dead hopes, and buried pain  
By measured words drawn from its grave again,  
Though no more deemed a strange unheard-of thing  
Made but for them; as when their hearts did cling  
To those dead hopes of things impossible,  
While their tale's ending yet was left to tell. <span id="page_178">p.
178</span>

 

 

STILL the hard frost griped all things bitterly,  
And who of folk might now say when or why  
The earth should change and spring come back again.  
—Spring clean forgotten, as amidst his pain  
Some hapless lover's chance unmeaning kiss  
Given unto lips that never shall be his  
In time long passed, ere bitter knowledge came,  
And cherished love was grown a wrong and shame.  
—Yet mid the dead swoon of the earth, the days  
’Gan lengthen now, and on the hard-beat ways  
No more the snow drave down; and, spite of all,  
The goodman's thoughts must needs begin to fall  
Upon the seed hid in the dying year,  
And he must busy him about his gear;  
And in the city, at the high noon, when  
The faint sun glimmered, sat the ancient men,  
With young folk gathered round about once more,  
Who heeded not the east wind's smothered roar,  
Since unto most of them for mere delight  
Were most things made, the dull days and the bright;  
And change was life to them, and death a tale  
Little believed, that chiefly did avail  
To quicken love and make a story sweet.

   Now the old Swabian's glittering eyes did meet  
A maiden's glance, who reddened at his gaze, <span id="page_179">p.
179</span>  
Whereon a pleasant smile came o’er his face,  
As from his pouch a yellow book he drew  
And spake:  
              "Of many things the wise man knew,  
The man who wrote this; many words he made  
Of haps that still perchance for great are weighed  
There in the East: how kings were born and died,  
And how men lied to them, and how they lied,  
And how they joyed in doing good and ill:  
Now mid the great things that his book do fill,  
Here is a tale, told, saith he, by a crone  
At some grand feast forgotten long agone,  
Which may perchance scarce be of much less worth  
Than tales of deeds that reddened the green earth—  
Fools' deeds of men, who well may be to you  
As good as nameless, since ye never knew  
The ways of those midst whom they lived erewhile,  
And what their hearts deemed good, or nought, and vile."
