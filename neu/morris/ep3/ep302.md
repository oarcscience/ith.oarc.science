### DECEMBER.

DEAD lonely night and all streets quiet now,  
Thin o’er the moon the hindmost cloud swims past  
Of that great rack that brought us up the snow;  
On earth strange shadows o’er the snow are cast;  
Pale stars, bright moon, swift cloud make heaven so vast  
That earth left silent by the wind of night  
Seems shrunken ’neath the grey unmeasured height.

   Ah! through the hush the looked-for midnight clangs!  
And then, e’en while its last stroke's solemn drone  
In the cold air by unlit windows hangs,  
Out break the bells above the year foredone,  
Change, kindness lost, love left unloved alone;  
Till their despairing sweetness makes thee deem  
Thou once wert loved, if but amidst a dream.

   O thou who clingest still to life and love,  
Though nought of good, no God thou mayst discern,  
Though nought that is, thine utmost woe can move,  
Though no soul knows wherewith thine heart doth yearn,  
Yet, since thy weary lips no curse can learn,  
Cast no least thing thou lovedst once away,  
Since yet perchance thine eyes shall see the day.

DECEMBER came, with mirth men needs must make  
E’en for the empty days and leisures’ sake  
That earth's cold leaden sleep doth bring; so there  
Our elders sat within the guest-hall fair,  
Not looking older for the snow without;  
Cheery enough; remembering not old doubt,  
A gnawing pain once, grown too hard to bear,  
And so cast by; not thinking of old fear,  
That conquering once, e’en with its victory  
Must fade away, and, like all things else, die.  
Not thinking of much else than that they had  
Enough of life to make them somewhat glad  
When all went well with them.  
                                  Now so it fell  
That mariners were there, who ’gan to tell  
Mishaps betid upon the winter seas,  
Which set some younger men amidst of these  
To ask the Wanderers of their voyage vain,  
As knowing scarce the tale thereof. Small pain  
It gave them now to answer: yet belike  
On the old men, their hosts, the thing did strike  
In jarring wise, this turning o’er and o’er  
Of memories once so bitter sharp and sore:  
Wherefore at last an elder said, "Let be,  
My masters! if about the troublous sea <span id="page_4">p. 4</span>  
Ye needs must hear, hearken a tale once told  
By kin of ours in the dim days of old,  
Whose thoughts when turning to a peaceful home  
Unto this very west of ours must come—  
—Scarce causelessly meseems when all is said,  
And I remember that years bow my head,  
And not the trouble of those days of war,  
Of loss and wrong that in old stories are."
