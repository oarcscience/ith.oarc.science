### THE FOSTERING OF ASLAUG.

#### ARGUMENT.

ASLAUG, the daughter of Sigurd who slew the Dragon, and of Brynhild whom
he loved, lost all her friends and kin, and was nourished amid great
misery; yet in the end her fortune, her glory, and her beauty prevailed,
and she came to mighty estate.

A FAIR tale might I tell to you  
Of Sigurd, who the dragon slew  
Upon the murder-wasted heath,  
And how love led him unto death,  
Through strange wild ways of joy and pain;  
Then such a story should ye gain,  
If I could tell it all aright,  
As well might win you some delight  
From out the woefullest of days;  
But now have I no heart to raise  
That mighty sorrow laid asleep,  
That love so sweet, so strong and deep,  
That as ye hear the wonder told  
In those few strenuous words of old,  
The whole world seems to rend apart  
When heart is torn away from heart.  
But the world lives still, and to-day  
The green Rhine wendeth on its way <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>  
Over the unseen golden curse  
That drew its lords to worse and worse,  
Till that last dawn in Atli's hall,  
When the red flame flared over all,  
Lighting the leaden, sunless sea.

   Yet so much told of this must be,  
That Sigurd, while his youth was bright  
And unstained, ’midst the first delight  
Of Brynhild's love—that him did gain  
All joy, all woe, and very bane—  
Begat on her a woman-child.  
In hope she bore the maid, and smiled  
When of its father's face she thought;  
But when sad time the change had brought,  
And she to Gunnar's house must go,  
She, thinking how she might bestow  
The memory of that lovely eve,  
That morn o’er-sweet, the child did leave  
With Heimir, her old foster-sire,  
A mighty lord; then, with the fire  
Of her old love still smouldering,  
And brooding over many a thing,  
She went unto her life and death.  
Nought, as I said, the story saith  
Of all the wrong and love that led  
Her feet astray: together dead  
They lie now on their funeral pile,  
And now the little one doth smile <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
Upon the glittering war-array  
Of the men come the sooth to say  
To Heimir of that bitter end.

   Silent he stared till these did wend  
Into the hall to fire and board,  
Then by the porch without a word  
Long time he sat: then he arose  
And drew his sword, and hard and close  
Gazed on the thin-worn edge, and said:  
"Smooth cheeks, sweet hands, and art thou dead?  
O me thy glory! Woe is me!  
I thought once more thine eyes to see—  
Had I been young three years agone,  
When thou a maiden burd-alone,  
Hadst eighteen summers!"  
                             As he spake,  
He gat him swiftly to the brake  
Of thorn-trees nigh his house: and some,  
When calm once more he sat at home,  
Deemed he had wept: but no word more  
He spake thereof.  
                    A few days wore,  
And now alone he oft would be  
Within his smithy; heedfully  
He guarded it, that none came in;  
Nor marvelled men; "For he doth win  
Some work of craftsmanship," said they,  
"And such before on many a day <span id="page_33">p. 33</span>  
Hath been his wont."  
                        So it went on  
That a long while he wrought alone;  
But on the tenth day bore in there  
Aslaug, the little maiden fair,  
Three winters old; and then the thing  
A little set folk marvelling;  
Yet none the less in nought durst they  
To watch him. So to end of day  
Time drew, and still unto the hall  
He came not, and a dread ’gan fall  
Upon his household, lest some ill  
The quiet of their lives should kill;  
And so it fell that the next morn  
They found them of their lord forlorn,  
And Aslaug might they see no more;  
Wide open was the smithy door,  
The forge a-cold, and hammering tools  
Lay on the floor, with woodwright's rules,  
And chips and shavings of hard wood.  
Moreover, when they deemed it good  
To seek for him, nought might they do,  
The tale says, for so dark it grew  
Over all ways, that no man might  
Know the green meads from water white.  
So back they wended sorrowfully,  
And still most like it seemed to be,  
That Odin had called Heimir home;  
And nothing strange it seemed to some <span id="page_34">p. 34</span>  
That with him the sweet youngling was,  
Since Brynhild's love might bring to pass  
E’en mightier things than this, they said,  
And sure the little gold-curled head,  
The pledge of all her earthly weal,  
In Freyia's house she longed to feel.

   Further the way was than they deemed  
Unto that rest whereof they dreamed  
Both to the greybeard and the child;  
For now by trodden way and wild  
Goes Heimir long: wide-faced is he,  
Thin-cheeked, hooked-nosed, e’en as might be  
An ancient erne; his hair falls down  
From ’neath a wide slouched hat of brown,  
And mingles white with his white beard;  
A broad brown brand, most men have feared,  
Hangs by his side, and at his back  
Is slung a huge harp, that doth lack  
All fairness certes, and so great  
It is, that few might bear its weight;  
Yea, Heimir even, somewhat slow  
Beneath its burden walketh now,  
And looketh round, and stayeth soon.

   On a calm sunny afternoon,  
Within a cleared space of a wood,  
At last the huge old warrior stood  
And peered about him doubtfully;  
Who, when nought living he might see, <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>  
But mid the beech-boughs high aloft  
A blue-winged jay, and squirrel soft,  
And in the grass a watchful hare,  
Unslung his harp and knelt down there  
Beside it, and a little while  
Handled the hollow with a smile  
Of cunning, and behold, the thing  
Opened, as by some secret spring,  
And there within the hollow lay,  
Clad in gold-fringed well-wrought array,  
Aslaug, the golden-headed child,  
Asleep and rosy; but she smiled  
As Heimir's brown hand drew a-near,  
And woke up free from any fear,  
And stretched her hands out towards his face.  
   He sat him down in the green place,  
With kind arms round the little one,  
Till, fully waked now, to the sun  
She turned, and babbling, ’gainst his breast  
Her dimpled struggling hands she pressed:  
His old lips touched those eyes of hers,  
That Sigurd's hope and Brynhild's tears  
Made sad e’en in her life's first spring;  
Then sweet her chuckling laugh did ring,  
As down amid the flowery grass  
He set her, and beheld her pass  
From flower to flower in utter glee;  
Therewith he reached out thoughtfully,  
And cast his arms around the harp, <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>  
That at the first most strange and sharp  
Rang through the still day, and the child  
Stopped, startled by that music wild:  
But then a change carne o’er the strings,  
As, tinkling sweet, of merry things  
They seemed to tell, and to and fro  
Danced Aslaug, till the tune did grow  
Fuller and stronger, sweeter still,  
And all the woodland place did fill  
With sound, not merry now nor sad,  
But sweet, heart-raising, as it had  
The gathered voice of that fair day  
Amidst its measured strains; her play  
Amid the flowers grew slower now,  
And sadder did the music grow,  
And yet still sweeter: and with that,  
Nigher to where the old man sat  
Aslaug ’gan move, until at last  
All sound from the strained strings there passed  
As into each other's eyes they gazed;  
Then, sighing, the young thing he raised,  
And set her softly on his knee,  
And laid her round cheek pitifully  
Unto his own, and said:  
                          "Indeed,  
Of such as I shalt thou have need,  
As swift the troubled days wear by,  
And yet I know full certainly  
My life on earth shall not be long: <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
And those who think to better wrong  
By working wrong shall seek thee wide  
To slay thee; yea, belike they ride  
E’en now unto my once-loved home.  
Well, to a void place shall they come,  
And I for thee thus much have wrought—  
For thee and Brynhild—yea, and nought  
I deem it still to turn my face  
Each morn unto some unknown place  
Like a poor churl—for, ah! who knows  
Upon what wandering wind that blows  
Drives Brynhild's spirit through the air;  
And now by such road may I fare  
That we may meet ere many days."

   Again the youngling did he raise  
Unto his face, for to the earth  
Had she slipped down; her babbling mirth  
Had mingled with his low deep speech;  
But now, as she her hand did reach  
Unto his beard, nor stinted more  
Her babble, did a change come o’er  
His face; for through the windless day  
Afar a mighty horn did bray;  
Then from beneath his cloak he drew  
A golden phial, and set it to  
Her ruddy lips in haste, and she  
Gazed at him awhile fearfully,  
As though she knew he was afraid; <span id="page_38">p. 38</span>  
But silently the child he laid  
In the harp's hollow place, for now  
Drowsy and drooping did she grow  
’Neath the strong potion; hastily  
He shut the harp, and raised it high  
Upon his shoulder, set his sword  
Ready to hand, and with no word  
Stalked off along the forest glade;  
But muttered presently:  
                          "Afraid  
Is a strange word for me to say;  
But all is changed in a short day,  
And full of death the world seems grown.  
Mayhap I shall be left alone  
When all are dead beside, to dream  
Of happy life that once did seem  
So stirring ’midst the folk I loved.  
Ah! is there nought that may be moved  
By strong desire? yea, nought that rules  
The very Gods who thrust earth's fools,  
This way and that as foolishly,  
For aught I know thereof, as I  
Deal with the chess when I am drunk?"

   His head upon his breast was sunk  
For a long space, and then again  
He spake: "My life is on the wane;  
Somewhat of this I yet may learn  
Ere long; yet I am fain to earn <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
My rest by reaching Atli's land;  
For surely ’neath his mighty hand  
Safe from the Niblungs shall she be,  
Safe from the forge of misery,  
Grimhild the Wise-wife."  
                         As a goad  
That name was to him; on he strode  
Still swifter, silent. But day wore  
As fast between the tree-stems hoar  
He went his ways; belike it was  
That he scarce knew if he did pass  
O’er rough or smooth, by dark or light,  
Until at last the very night  
Had closed round him as thinner grew  
The wood that he was hurrying through;  
And as he gained a grey hill's brow  
He felt the sea-breeze meet him now,  
And heard the low surf's measured beat  
Upon the beach. He stayed his feet,  
And through the dusky gathering dark  
Peered round and saw what seemed a spark  
Along the hill's ridge; thitherward  
He turned, still warily on guard,  
Until he came unto the door  
Of some stead, lone belike and poor:  
There knocking, was he bidden in,  
And heedfully he raised the pin,  
And entering stood with blinking gaze  
Before a fire's unsteady blaze. <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

   There sat a woman all alone  
Whom some ten years would make a crone,  
Yet would they little worsen her;  
Her face was sorely pinched with care,  
Sour and thin-lipped she was; of hue  
E’en like a duck's foot; whitish blue  
Her eyes were, seeming as they kept  
Wide open even when she slept.  
   She rose up, and was no less great  
Than a tall man, a thing of weight  
Was the gaunt hand that held a torch  
As Heimir, midmost of the porch,  
Fixed his deep grey and solemn eyes  
Upon that wretched wife's surprise.

   "Well," said she, "what may be your will?  
Little we have your sack to fill,  
If on thieves’ errand ye are come;  
But since the goodman is from home  
I know of none shall say you nay  
If ye have will to bear away  
The goodwife."  
                  As on a burned house  
Grown cold, the moon shines dolorous  
From out the rainy lift, so now  
A laugh must crease her lip and brow.  
"I am no thief, goodwife," he said,  
"But ask wherein to lay my head  
To-night." <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>  
            "Well, goodman, sit," said she:  
"Thine ugly box of minstrelsy  
With thine attire befits not ill;  
And both belike may match thy skill."

   So by the fire he sat him down,  
And she too sat, and coarse and brown  
The thread was that her rock gave forth  
As there she spun; of little worth  
Was all the gear that hall did hold.  
   Now Heimir new-come from the cold  
Had set his harp down by his side,  
And, turning his grey eyes and wide  
Away from hers, slouched down his hat  
Yet farther o’er his brows, and sat  
With hands outstretched unto the flame.  
But had he noted how there came  
A twinkle into her dead eyes,  
He had been minded to arise,  
Methinks; for better company  
The wild-wood wolf had been than she.  
Because, from out the hodden grey  
That was the great man's poor array,  
Once and again could she behold  
How that the gleam of ruddy gold  
Came forth: so therewith she arose,  
And, wandering round the hall, drew close  
Unto the great harp, and could see  
Some fringe of golden bravery <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>  
Hanging therefrom.—And the man too,  
In spite of patch and clouted shoe,  
And unadorned sword, seemed indeed  
Scarce less than a great king in need,  
So wholly noble was his mien.  
   So, with these things thus thought and seen,  
Within her mind grew fell intent  
As to and fro the hall she went,  
And from the ark at last did take  
Meal forth for porridge and for cake,  
And to the fire she turned, and ’gan  
To look still closer on the man  
As with the girdle and the pot  
She busied her, and doubted not  
That on his arm a gold ring was;  
For presently, as she did pass,  
Somewhat she brushed the cloak from him,  
And saw the gold gleam nowise dim.  
Then sure, if man might shape his fate,  
Her greed impatient and dull hate  
Within her eyes he might have seen,  
And so this tale have never been.  
But nought he heeded; far away  
His thoughts were.  
                     Therewith did she lay  
The meal upon the board, and said,  
"Meseems ye would be well apaid  
Of meat and drink, and it is here,  
Fair lord—though somewhat sorry cheer; <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>  
Fall to now."  
               Whining, with a grin  
She watched, as one who sets a gin,  
If at the name of lord at all  
He started, but no speech did fall  
From his old lips, and wearily  
He gat to meat, and she stood by,  
And poured the drink to him, and said:

   "To such a husband am I wed  
That ill is speech with him, when he  
Comes home foredone with drudgery;  
And though indeed I deem thee one  
Who deeds of fame full oft hath done  
And would not fear him, yet most ill  
’Twould be the bliss of us to spill  
In brawl with him, as might betide  
If thou his coming shouldst abide.  
Our barley barn is close hereby,  
Wherein a weary man might lie  
And be no worse at dawn of day."

   "Well, goodwife," said he, "lead the way!  
Worse lodging have I had than that,  
Where the wolf howled unto the bat,  
And red the woodland stream did run."

   She started back, he seemed as one  
Who might have come back from the dead,  
To wreak upon her evil head <span id="page_44">p. 44</span>  
Her sour ill life, but nought the more  
He heeded her; "Go on before,"  
He said, "for I am in no case  
To-night to meet an angry face  
And hold my hand from my good sword."

   So out she passed without a word,  
Though when he took in careful wise  
The heavy harp, with greedy eyes  
And an ill scowl she gazed thereon,  
Yet durst say nought. But soon they won  
Unto the barn's door—he turned round,  
And, gazing down the rugged ground,  
Beheld the sea wide reaching, white  
Beneath the new-risen moon, and bright  
His face waxed for a little while,  
And on the still night did he smile,  
As into the dark place he went,—  
And saw no more of the grey bent,  
Or sea, or sky, or morrow's sun.  
Unless perchance when all is done,  
And all the wrongs the Gods have wrought  
Come utterly with them to nought,  
New heavens and earth he shall behold,  
And peaceful folk, and days of gold,  
When Baldur is come back again  
O’er an undying world to reign.

   For when the carl came home that night,  
In every ill wise that she might, <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>  
She egged him on their guest to slay  
As sleeping in the barn he lay;  
And, since the man was no ill mate  
For her, and heedless evil fate  
Had made him big and strong enow,  
He plucked up heart to strike the blow,  
Though but a coward thief he was.  
So at the grey dawn did he pass  
Unto the barn, and entered there;  
But through its dusk therewith did hear  
The sound of harp-strings tinkling: then,  
As is the wont of such-like men,  
Great fear of ghosts fell on his heart;  
Yet, trembling sore, he thrust apart  
The long stems of the barley-straw,  
And, peering round about, he saw  
Heimir asleep, his naked brand  
Laid o’er his knees, but his right hand  
Amid the harp-strings, whence there came  
A mournful tinkling; and some name  
His lips seemed muttering, and withal  
A strange sound on his ears did fall  
As of a young child murmuring low  
The muffled sounds of passing woe.  
Nought dreadful saw he; yet the hair  
’Gan bristle on his head with fear,  
And twice was he at point to turn  
His bread by other craft to earn;  
But in the end prevailed in him <span id="page_46">p. 46</span>  
His raging greed ’gainst glimmerings dim  
Of awe and pity; which but wrought  
In such wise in him that he thought  
How good it were if all were done,  
And day, and noise, and the bright sun  
Were come again: he crept along,  
Poising a spear, thick shafted, strong,  
In his right hand; and ever fast  
His heart beat as the floor he passed,  
And o’er his shoulder gazed for fear  
Once and again; he raised the spear,  
As Heimir's hand the string still pressed,  
And thrust it through his noble breast,  
Then turned and fled, and heard behind  
A sound as of a wildered wind,  
Half moan, half sigh; then all was still.  
But yet such fear his soul did fill  
That he stayed not until he came  
Into the hall, and cried the name  
Of his wife, Grima, in high voice.

   "Ah well," she said, "what needs this noise,  
Can ye not see me here?—Well then?"

   "Wife," said he, "of the sons of men  
I deem him not, rather belike  
Odin it was that I did strike."

   She laughed an ill laugh. "Well," she said,  
"What then, if only he be dead?" <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

   "What if he only seemed to die?"  
He said, "and when night draweth nigh  
Shall come again grown twice as great,  
And eat where yesternight he ate?  
For certes, wife, that harp of his,  
No earthly minstrelsy it is,  
Since as in sleep the man was laid  
Of its own self a tune it played;  
Yea, yea, and in a man's voice cried;  
Belike a troll therein doth bide."

   "An ugly, ill-made minstrel's tool,"  
She said; "thou blundering, faint-heart fool!  
Some wind moaned through the barn belike,  
And the man's hand the strings did strike."

   And yet she shivered as she spake,  
As though some fear her heart did take,  
And neither durst to draw anigh  
The barn until the sun was high,  
Then in they went together, and saw  
The old man lying in the straw,  
Scarce otherwise than if asleep,  
Though in his heart the spear lay deep,  
And round about the floor was red.  
Then Grima went, and from the dead  
Stripped off the gold ring, while the man  
Stood still apart; then she began  
To touch the harp, but in no wise <span id="page_48">p. 48</span>  
Might open it to reach the prize.  
Wherefore she bade her husband bring  
Edge-tools to split the cursed thing.  
He brought them trembling, and the twain  
Fell to, and soon their end did gain;  
But shrank back trembling to see there  
The youngling, her grey eyes and clear  
Wide open, fearless; but the wife  
Knew too much of her own sour life  
To fear the other world o’ermuch,  
And soon began to pull and touch  
The golden raiment of the may;  
And at the last took heart to say:

   "Be comforted! we shall not die;  
For no work is this certainly  
Wrought in the country never seen.  
But raiment of a Hunnish queen—  
Gold seest thou, goodman! gems seest thou!—  
No ill work hast thou wrought I trow.  
But, for the maiden, we must give  
Victuals to her that she may live;  
For though to-day she is indeed  
But one more mouth for us to feed,  
Yet as she waxeth shall she do  
Right many a thing to help us two;  
Yea, whatso hardest work there is,  
That shall be hers—no life of bliss  
Like sewing gold mid bower-mays; <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>  
She shall be strong, too, as the days  
Increase on her."  
                    Then said the man:  
"Get speech from her, for sure she can  
Tell somewhat of her life and state."  
But whatso he or his vile mate  
Might do, no word at all she spake  
Either for threat or promise sake;  
Until at last they deemed that she  
Was tongue-tied: so now presently  
Unto the homestead was she brought,  
And her array all golden-wrought  
Stripped from her, and in rags of grey  
Clad was she. But from light of day  
The carl hid Heimir dead, and all  
Into dull sodden life did fall.

 

 

SO with the twain abode the may,  
Waxing in beauty day by day,  
But ever as one tongue-tied was,  
What thing soever came to pass;  
And needs the hag must call her Crow:  
"A name," she said, "full good enow  
For thee—my mother bore it erst."  
So lived the child that she was nursed <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
On little meat and plenteous blows;  
Yet nowise would she weep, but close  
Would set her teeth thereat, and go  
About what work she had to do,  
And ever wrought most sturdily;  
Until at last she grew to be  
More than a child. And now the place  
That once had borne so dull a face  
Grew well-nigh bright to look upon,  
And whatso thing might shine there shone;  
Yea, all but her who brought about  
That change therein—for, past all doubt,  
Years bettered in nowise our hag,  
And ever she said that any rag  
Was good enough to clothe the Crow.  
And still her hate did grow and grow  
As Aslaug grew to womanhood;  
Oft would she sit in murderous mood  
Long hours, with hand anigh a knife,  
As Aslaug slept, all hate at strife  
With greed within her; yet withal  
Something like fear of her did fall  
Upon her heart, and heavy weighed  
That awful beauty, that oft stayed  
Her hand from closing on the hilt,  
E’en more than thought of good things spilt.  
Hard words and blows this scarce might stay,  
For like the minutes of the day,  
Not looked for, noted not when gone, <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>  
Were all such things unto the crone,  
And, smitten or unsmitten, still  
The Crow was swift to work her will.

   In spring-tide of her seventeenth year,  
On the hill-side the house anear  
Went Aslaug, following up her goats:  
On such a day as when Love floats  
Through the soft air unseen, to touch  
Our hearts with longings overmuch  
Unshapen into hopes, to make  
All things seem fairer for the sake  
Of that which cometh, who doth bear  
Who knows how much of grief and fear  
In his fair arms. So Aslaug went,  
On vague and unnamed thoughts intent,  
That seemed to her full sweet enow,  
And ever greater hope did grow,  
And sweet seemed life to her and good,  
Small reason why: into the wood  
She turned, and wandered slim and fair  
’Twixt the dark tree-boles: strange and rare  
The sight was of her golden head,  
So good, uncoifed, unchapleted,  
Above her sordid dark array,  
That over her fair body lay  
As dark clouds on a lilied hill.  
The wild things well might gaze their fill,  
As through the wind-flowers brushed her feet, <span id="page_52">p.
52</span>  
As her lips smiled when those did meet  
The lush-cold blue-bells, or were set  
Light on the pale dog-violet  
Late April bears: the red-throat jay  
Screamed not for nought, as on her way  
She went, light-laughing at some thought;  
If the dove moaned ’twas not for nought,  
Since she was gone too soon from him,  
And e’en the sight he had was dim  
For the thick budding twigs. At last  
Into an open space she passed,  
Nigh filled with a wide, shallow lake,  
Amidmost which the fowl did take  
Their pastime; o’er the firmer grass,  
’Twixt rushy ooze, swift did she pass,  
Until upon a bank of sand  
Close to the water did she stand,  
And gazed down in that windless place  
Upon the image of her face,  
And as she gazed laughed musically  
Once and again; nor heeded she  
Her straying flock: her voice, that none  
Had heard since Heimir was undone  
Within that wretched stead, began  
Such speech as well had made a man  
Forget his land and kin to make  
Those sweet lips tremble for his sake:

   "Spring bringeth love," she said, "to all." <span id="page_53">p.
53</span>  
She sighed as those sweet sounds did fall  
From her unkissed lips: "Ah," said she,  
"How came that sweet word unto me,  
Among such wretched folk who dwell,  
Folk who still seem to carry hell  
About with them?—That ancient man  
They slew, with whom my life began,  
I deem he must have taught me that,  
And how the steel-clad maiden sat  
Asleep within the ring of flame,  
Asleep, and waiting till Love came,  
Who was my father: many a dream  
I dream thereof, till it doth seem  
That they will fetch me hence one day.  
Somewhere I deem life must be gay,  
The flowers are wrought not for the sake  
Of those two murderers."  
                            While she spake  
Her hands were busy with her gown,  
And at the end it slipped adown  
And left her naked there and white  
In the unshadowed noontide light.  
Like Freyia in her house of gold,  
A while her limbs did she behold  
Clear mirrored in the lake beneath;  
Then slowly, with a shuddering breath,  
Stepped in the water cold, and played  
Amid the ripple that she made,  
And spoke again aloud, as though <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>  
The lone place of her heart might know:  
"Soothly," she said, "if I knew fear,  
Scarcely should I be sporting here,  
But blinder surely has the crone  
In those last months of winter grown,  
Nor knows if I be foul or sweet,  
Or sharp stripes might I chance to meet,  
As heretofore it hath been seen  
When I have dared to make me clean  
Amid their foulness: loathes her heart  
That one she hates should have a part  
In the world's joy.—Well, time wears by,  
I was not made for misery.  
Surely if dimly do mine eyes  
Behold no sordid tale arise,  
No ill life drawing near—who knows  
But I am kept for greater woes,  
Godlike despair that makes not base,  
Though like a stone may grow the face  
Because of it, yea, and the heart  
A hard-wrought treasure set apart  
For the world's glory?"  
                         Therewith she  
Made for the smooth bank leisurely,  
And, naked as she was, did pass  
Unto the warm and flowery grass  
All unashamed, and fearing not  
For aught that should draw nigh the spot:  
And soothly had some hunter been <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>  
Near by and all her beauty seen,  
He would have deemed he saw a fay  
And hastened trembling on his way.  
But when full joyance she had had  
Of sun and flowers, her limbs she clad  
In no long time, forsooth, and then  
Called back her wandering flock again  
With one strange dumb cry, e’en as though  
Their hearts and minds she needs must know,  
For hurrying back with many a bleat  
They huddled round about her feet.  
And back she went unto the stead,  
Strange visions pressing round her head,  
So light of heart and limb, that though  
She went with measured steps and slow,  
Each yard seemed but a dance to her.

   So now the thick wood did she clear,  
And o’er the bent beheld the sea,  
And stood amazed there suddenly,  
For a long ship, with shield-hung rail,  
And fair-stained flapping raven-sail,  
And golden dragon-stem, there lay  
On balanced oars amidst the bay,  
Slow heaving with the unrippled swell.  
With a strange hope she might not tell  
Her eyes ran down the strand, and there  
Lay beached a ship's boat painted fair,  
And on the shingle by her side <span id="page_56">p. 56</span>  
Three blue-clad axemen did abide  
Their fellows, sent belike ashore  
To gather victuals for their store.

   She looked not long; with heart that beat  
More quickly and with hurrying feet  
Unto the homestead did she pass,  
And when anigh the door she was  
She heard men's voices deep and rough;  
Then the shrill crone, who said, "Enough  
Of work I once had done for you,  
But now my days left are but few  
And I am weak; I prithee wait,  
Already now the noon is late,  
My daughter, Crow, shall soon be here."  
"Nay," said a shipman, "have no fear,  
Goodwife, a speedy death to get,  
Thou art a sturdy carline yet:  
Howbeit we well may wait a while."

   Thereat Aslaug, with a strange smile,  
Fresh from that water in the wood,  
Pushed back the crazy door, and stood  
Upon the threshold silently;  
Bareheaded and barefoot was she,  
And scarce her rags held each to each,  
Yet did the shipmen stay their speech  
And open-mouthed upon her stare,  
As with bright eyes and face flushed fair <span id="page_57">p.
57</span>  
She stood; one gleaming lock of gold,  
Strayed from her fair head's plaited fold,  
Fell far below her girdlestead,  
And round about her shapely head  
A garland of dog-violet  
And wind-flowers meetly had she set:  
They deemed it little scathe indeed  
That her coarse homespun ragged weed  
Fell off from her round arms and lithe  
Laid on the door-post, that a withe  
Of willows was her only belt;  
And each as he gazed at her felt  
As some gift had been given him.

   At last one grumbled, "Nowise dim  
It is to see, goodwife, that this  
No branch of thy great kinship is."

   Grima was glaring on the may,  
And scarce for rage found words to say;  
"Yea, soothly is she of our kin:  
Sixty-five winters changeth skin.  
And whatsoever she may be,  
Though she is dumb as a dead tree,  
She worketh ever double-tide.  
So, masters, ope your mealsacks wide  
And fall to work; enow of wood  
There is, I trow." <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>  
                   And there she stood,  
Shaking all o’er, and when the may  
Brushed past her going on her way,  
From off the board a knife she caught,  
And well-nigh had it in her thought  
To end it all. Small heed the men  
Would take of her, forsooth; and when  
They turned their baking-work to speed,  
And Aslaug fell the meal to knead,  
He was the happiest of them all  
Unto whose portion it did fall  
To take the loaves from out her hand;  
And gaping often would he stand,  
And ever he deemed that he could feel  
A trembling all along the peel  
Whenas she touched it—sooth to say,  
Such bread as there was baked that day  
Was never seen: such as it was  
The work was done, and they did pass  
Down toward the ship, and as they went  
A dull place seemed the thymy bent,  
Gilded by sunset; the fair ship,  
That soft in the long swell did dip  
Her golden dragon, seemed nought worth,  
And they themselves, all void of mirth,  
Stammering and blundering in their speech,  
Still looking back, seemed each to each  
Ill-shapen, ugly, rough and base  
As might be found in any place. <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

   Well, saith the tale, and when the bread  
Was broken, just as light as lead  
Men found the same, as sweet as gall,  
Half baked and sodden; one and all  
Men gave it to the devil; at last  
Unto their lord the story passed,  
Who called for them, and bade them say  
Why they had wrought in such a way;  
They grinned and stammered, till said one:  
"We did just e’en as must be done  
When men are caught; had it been thou  
A-cold had been the oven now."

   "Ye deal in riddles," said the lord,  
"Enough brine is there overboard  
To fill you full if even so  
Ye needs must have it."  
                         "We did go,"  
The man said, "to a house, and found  
That lack of all things did abound;  
A yellow-faced and blear-eyed crone  
Was in the sooty hall alone;  
But as we talked with her, and she  
Spake to us ill and craftily,  
A wondrous scent was wafted o’er  
The space about the open door,  
And all the birds drew near to sing,  
And summer pushed on into spring,  
Until there stood before our eyes <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>  
A damsel clad in wretched guise,  
Yet surely of the gods I deem,  
So fair she was;—well then this dream  
Of Freyia on midsummer night,  
This breathing love, this once-seen sight,  
Flitted amidst us kneading meal,  
And from us all the wits did steal;—  
Hadst thou been wise?"

                    "Well," said the lord,  
"This seemeth but an idle word;  
Yet since ye all are in one tale  
Somewhat to you it may avail—  
Speak out! my lady that is dead—  
Thora, the chief of goodlihead—  
Came this one nigh to her at all?"

   One answer from their mouths did fall,  
That she was fairest ever seen.  
"If two such marvellous things have been  
Wrought by the gods, then have they wrought  
Exceeding well," the lord said; "nought  
Will serve me now but to have sight  
Of her, and hear the fresh delight  
Of her sweet voice."  
                     "Nay, nay," one cried,  
"The carline called the maid tongue-tied  
E’en from her birth."  
                       But thoughtfully <span id="page_61">p.
61</span>  
The lord spake: "Then belike shall be  
Some wonder in the thing. Lo now,  
Since I, by reason of my vow  
Made on the cup at Yule, no more  
May set foot upon any shore  
Till I in Micklegarth have been,  
And somewhat there of arms have seen,  
Go ye at earliest morn and say  
That I would see her ere the day  
Is quite gone by; here shall she come  
And go as if her father's home  
The good ship were, and I indeed  
Her very brother. Odin speed  
The matter in some better wise,  
Unless your words be nought but lies!"

   So the next morn she had the word  
To come unto their king and lord;  
She answered not, but made as though  
Their meaning she did fully know,  
And gave assent: the crone was there,  
And still askance at her did glare,  
And mid her hatred grew afeard  
Of what might come, but spoke no word;  
And ye may well believe indeed  
That those men gave her little heed,  
But stared at Aslaug as she stood  
Beside the greasy, blackened wood  
Of the hall's uprights, fairer grown <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
Than yesterday, soft ’neath her gown  
Her fair breast heaving, her wide eyes  
Mid dreams of far-off things grown wise,  
The rock dropped down in her left hand;—  
There mazed awhile the men did stand,  
Then gat them back. And so the sun  
Waxed hot and waned, and, day nigh done,  
Gleamed on the ship's side as she lay  
Close in at deepest of the bay,  
Her bridge gold-hung on either hand  
Cast out upon the hard white sand;  
While o’er the bulwarks many a man  
Gazed forth; and the great lord began  
To fret and fume, till on the brow  
Of the low cliff they saw her now,  
Who stood a moment to behold  
The ship's sun-litten flashing gold;  
Then slowly ’gan to get her down  
A steep path in the sea-cliff brown,  
Till on a sudden did she meet  
The slant sun cast about its feet,  
And flashed as in a golden cloud;  
Since scarcely her poor raiment showed  
Beneath the glory of her hair,  
Whose last lock touched her ankles bare.

   For so it was that as she went  
Unto this meeting, all intent  
Upon the time that was to be, <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>  
While yet just hidden from the sea,  
She stayed her feet a little while,  
And, gazing on her raiment vile,  
Flushed red, and muttered,—  
                             "Who can tell  
But I may love this great lord well?  
An evil thing then should it be  
If he cast loathing eyes on me  
This first time for my vile attire."

   Then, while her cheek still burned like fire,  
She set hand to her hair of gold  
Until its many ripples rolled  
All over her, and no great queen  
Was e’er more gloriously beseen;  
And thus she went upon her way.

   Now when the crew beheld the may  
Set foot upon the sand there rose  
A mighty shout from midst of those  
Rough seafarers; only the lord  
Stood silent gazing overboard  
With great eyes, till the bridge she gained,  
And still the colour waxed and waned  
Within his face; but when her foot  
First pressed the plank, to his heart's root  
Sweet pain there pierced, for her great eyes  
Were fixed on his in earnest wise,  
E’en as her thoughts were all of him; <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>  
And somewhat now all things waxed dim,  
As unto her he stretched his hand,  
And felt hers; and the twain did stand  
Hearkening each other's eager breath.  
But she was changed, for pale as death  
She was now as she heard his voice.

   "Full well may we this eve rejoice,  
Fair maid, that thou hast come to us;  
That this grey shore and dolorous  
Holds greater beauty than the earth  
Mid fairer days may bring to birth,  
And that I hold it now. But come  
Unto the wind-blown woven home,  
Where I have dwelt alone awhile,  
And with thy speech the hours beguile."

   For nothing he remembered  
Of what his men unto him said,  
That she was dumb. Not once she turned  
Her eyes from his; the low sun burned  
Within her waving hair, as she  
Unto the poop went silently  
Beside him, and with faltering feet,  
Because this hour seemed over sweet,  
And still his right hand held her hand.

   But when at last the twain did stand  
Beneath the gold-hung tilt alone, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>  
He said, "Thou seemest such an one  
As who could love; thou lookst on me  
As though thou hopedst love might be  
Betwixt us—thou art pale, my sweet,  
Good were it if our lips should meet."

   Then mouth to mouth long time they stood,  
And when they sundered the red blood  
Burnt in her cheek, and tenderly  
Trembled her lips, and drew anigh  
His lips again: but speech did break  
Swiftly from out them, and she spake:  
"May it be so, fair man, that thou  
Art even no less happy now  
Than I am."  
              With a joyous cry  
He caught her to him hastily;  
And mid that kiss the sun went down,  
And colder was the dark world grown.  
Once more they parted; "Ah, my love,"  
He said, "I knew not aught could move  
My heart to such joy as thy speech."

   She made as if she fain would reach  
Her lips to his once more; but ere  
They touched, as smitten by new fear,  
She drew aback and said: "Alas!  
It darkens, and I needs must pass  
Back to the land, to be more sad <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>  
Than if this joy I ne’er had had.  
And thou—thou shalt be sorry too,  
And pity me that it is so."

   "To-morrow morn comes back the day,"  
He said, "If we should part, sweet may:  
Yet why should I be left forlorn  
Betwixt this even and the morn?"

   His hand had swept aback her hair,  
And on her shoulder, gleaming bare  
From midst her rags, was trembling now;  
But she drew back, and o’er her brow  
Gathered a troubled thoughtful frown,  
And on the bench she sat her down  
And spake: "Nay, it were wise to bide  
Awhile. Behold, the world is wide,  
Yet have we found each other here,  
And each to other seems more dear  
Than all the world else.—Yet a king  
Thou art, and I am such a thing,  
By some half-dreamed-of chance cast forth  
To live a life of little worth,  
A lonely life—and it may be  
That thou shouldst weary soon of me  
If I abode here now—and I,  
How know I? All unhappily  
My life has gone; scarce a kind word  
Except in dreams my ears have heard <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
But those thy lovely lips have said:  
It might be when all things were weighed  
That I too light of soul should prove  
To hold for ever this great love."

   Down at her feet therewith he knelt,  
And round her his strong arms she felt  
Drawing her to him, as he said:  
"These are strange words for thee, O maid;  
Are those sweet loving lips grown cold  
So soon? Yet art thou in my hold,  
And certainly my heart is hot.  
What help against me hast thou got?"

   Each unto each their cheeks were laid,  
As in a trembling voice she said:  
"No help, because so dear to me  
Thou art, and mighty as may be;  
Thou hast seen much, art wiser far  
Than I am; yet strange thoughts there are  
In my mind now—some half-told tale  
Stirs in me, if I might avail  
To tell it."  
            Suddenly she rose,  
And thrust him from her; "Ah, too close!  
Too close now, and too far apart  
To-morrow!—and a barren heart,  
And days that ever fall to worse, <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>  
And blind lives struggling with a curse  
They cannot grasp! Look on my face,  
Because I deem me of a race  
That knoweth such a tale too well.  
Yet if there be such tale to tell  
Of us twain, let it e’en be so,  
Rather than we should fail to know  
This love—ah me, my love forbear!  
No pain for thee and me I fear;  
Yet strive we e’en for more than this!  
Thou who hast given me my first bliss  
To-day, forgive me, that in turn  
I see the pain within thee burn,  
And may not help—because mine eyes  
The Gods make clear. I am grown wise  
With gain of love, and hope of days  
That many a coming age shall praise."

   Awhile he gazed on her, and shook  
With passion, and his cloak's hem took  
With both hands as to rend it down;  
Yet from his brow soon cleared the frown:  
He said: "Yea, such an one thou art,  
As needs alone must fill my heart  
If I be like my father's kin,  
And have a hope great deeds to win;  
And surely nought shall hinder me  
From living a great life with thee—  
Say now what thou wouldst have me do." <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

   "Some deed of fame thou goest to,"  
She said, "for surely thou art great;  
Go on thy way then, and if fate  
So shapen is, that thou mayst come  
Once more unto this lonely home,  
There shalt thou find me, who will live  
Through whatso days that fate may give,  
Till on some happy coming day  
Thine oars again make white the bay."

   "If that might be remembered now,"  
He said, "last Yule I made a vow  
In some far land to win me fame.  
Come nigher, sweet, and hear my name  
Before thou goest; that if so be  
Death take me and my love from thee,  
Thou mayst then think of who I was,  
Nor let all memory of me pass  
When thou to some great king art wed:  
Then shalt thou say, 'Ragnar is dead,  
Who was the son of Sigurd Ring,  
Among the Danes a mighty king.  
He might have had me by his side,'  
Then shalt thou say, 'that hour he died;  
But my heart failed and not his heart.'"

   "Nay, make it not too hard to part,"  
She said, when once again their lips  
Had sundered; "as gold-bearing ships <span id="page_70">p. 70</span>  
Foundered amidmost of the sea,  
So shall the loves of most men be,  
And leave no trace behind. God wot  
This heart of mine shall hate thee not  
Whatso befall; but rather bless  
Thee and this hour of happiness;  
And if this tide shall come again  
After hard longing and great pain,  
How sweet, how sweet! O love, farewell,  
Lest other tale there be to tell:  
Yet heed this now lest afterward  
It seem to thee a thing too hard  
To keep thy faith to such as me;  
I am belike what thou dost see,  
A goatherd girl, a peasant maid,  
Of a poor wretched crone afraid  
From dawn to dusk; despite of dreams  
In morning tides, and misty gleams  
Of wondrous stories, deem me such  
As I have said, nor overmuch  
Cast thou thy love upon my heart  
If even such a man thou art  
As needs must wed a great man's child."

   He stepped aback from her and smiled,  
And, stooping ’neath the lamp, drew forth  
From a great chest a thing of worth—  
A silken sark wrought wondrously  
In some far land across the sea. <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>  
"One thing this is of many such  
That I were fain thy skin should touch,"  
He said, "If thou wouldst have it so."  
But his voice faltered and sank low,  
As though her great heart he ’gan fear.  
She reached her fine strong hand anear  
The farfetched thing; then smiling said:  
"Strange that such fair things can be made  
By men who die; and like it is  
Thou think’st me worthy of all bliss;  
But our rough hills and smoky house  
Befit not aught so glorious,  
E’en if thou come again to me;  
And if not, greater grief to see  
The gifts of dead love!—what say I,  
Our crone should wear these certainly  
If I but brought them unto land."

   He flushed red, and his strong right hand  
Fell to his sword-hilt. "Nay," she said,  
"All that is nought if rightly weighed;  
Hope and desire shall pass the days  
If thou come back."  
                      Grave was her face  
And tremulous: he sighed; "Then take  
This last gift only for my sake."  
And once again their lips did touch  
And cling together. "O many such,"  
She said, "if the time did not fail, <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>  
And my heart too: of what avail  
Against the hand of fate to strive?  
Let me begin my life to live,  
As it must be a weary space."

   The moon smote full upon her face,  
As on a trembling sea, as now  
From the lamp-litten gold tilt low  
She stepped into the fresher air,  
He with her. Slow the twain did fare  
Amidst the wondering men, till they  
Had reached the bridge; then swift away  
She turned, and passed the gold-hung rail,  
And o’er the sands the moon made pale  
Went gleaming, all alone: and he  
Watched till her light feet steadily  
Stepped up upon the dark cliff's brow:  
But no one time she turned her now,  
But vanished from him into night.  
So there he watched till changing light  
Brought the beginning of the tide  
Of longing that he needs must bide;  
Then he cried out for oars and sail,  
And ere the morning star did fail  
No more those cliffs his bird beheld,  
As ’neath the wind the broad sail swelled. <span id="page_73">p.

BUT for the maiden, back she went  
Unto the stead, and her intent  
She changed in nought: no word she spake  
What wrath soe’er on her might break  
From the fell crone, on whom withal  
Still heavier did that strange awe fall;  
As well might be, for from the may  
Had girlish lightness passed away  
Into a sweet grave majesty,  
That scarce elsewhere the world might see.

   So wore the spring, and summer came,  
And went, and all the woods did flame  
With autumn, as in that old tide  
When slowly by the mirk hill-side  
Went Heimir to his unseen death:  
Then came the first frost's windless breath,  
The steaming sea, the world all white,  
And glittering morn and silent night,  
As when the little one first felt  
The world a-cold; and still she dwelt  
Unchanged since that first spark of love  
Wrought the great change, that so did move  
Her heart to perfect loveliness.  
Nor overmuch did the days press  
Upon her with the weary waste  
Of short life, that too quick doth haste <span id="page_74">p.
74</span>  
When joy is gained: if any thought  
Thereof unto her heart was brought,  
Rather it was, "Ah, overlong  
For brooding over change and wrong  
When that shall come! Good gain to me  
My love's eyes one more time to see,  
To feel once more his lips’ delight,  
And die with the short summer night,  
Not shamed nor sorry! But if I  
Must bear the weight of misery  
In the after days, yet even then  
May I not leave to unborn men  
A savour of sweet things, a tale  
That midst all woes shall yet prevail  
To make the world seem something worth?"

   So passed the winter of the North,  
And once again was come the spring;  
Then whiles would she go loitering  
Slow-footed, and with hanging head,  
Through budding brake, o’er flowery mead,  
With blood that throbbed full quickly now  
If o’er the flowers her feet were slow,  
And bonds about her seemed to be.  
Yet wore the spring past lingeringly  
Till on a morn of latter May,  
When her soft sleep had passed away,  
Nought but the bright-billed sweet-throat bird  
Within the thorn at first she heard; <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
But, even as her heart did meet  
The first wave of desire o’ersweet,  
The winding of a mighty horn  
Adown the breeze of May was borne,  
And throbbing hope on her did fall:  
Yet from her bed she leapt withal,  
And clad herself, and went about  
Her work, as though with ne’er a doubt  
That this day e’en such like should be  
As was the last; and so while she  
Quickened the fire and laid the board,  
Mid the crone's angry, querulous word  
Of surly wonder, the goodman,  
With axe on shoulder, swiftly ran  
Adown the slope; but presently  
Came breathless back:  
                         "Ah, here they be!  
Come back again for something worse,"  
Said he. "This dumb maid is some curse  
Laid on us."  
              "Well," the goodwife said,  
"Who be they?" "They who baked their bread  
Within this house last spring," said he.  
"Oft did I marvel then why she,  
This witch-maid, went unto the strand  
That eve."  
             "Nay, maybe comes to hand  
Some luck," the crone said. "Hold thy peace,"  
He said. "What goodhap or increase <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>  
From that ill night shall ever come?  
Rather I deem that now come home  
Those fifteen years of murder: lo,  
The worst of all we soon shall know,  
I hear their voices."  
                      Silently,  
If somewhat pale, Aslaug passed by  
From fire to board, as though she heard  
And noted nothing of that word,  
Whate’er it was: yet now, indeed,  
The clink of sword on iron weed,  
And voices of the seafarers,  
Came clear enow unto her ears;  
Nor was it long or e’er the door  
Was darkened, as one stood before  
The light and cried:  
                        "Hail to this house,  
If here still dwells the glorious  
Fair maiden, that across the seas  
We come for!"  
                 Aslaug on her knees  
Knelt by the brightening fire and dropped  
The meal into the pot, nor stopped  
For all their words, but with her hand  
Screened her fair face. Then up did stand  
The goodman, quaking:  
                          "Well," he said,  
"Good be my meed! for we have fed  
This dumb maid all for kindness’ sake." <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

   "No need," he said, "long words to make,  
And little heed we thy lies now,  
But if she doom thee to the bough.  
—All hail, our Lady and our Queen!"

   For she, arisen, with glorious mien  
Was drawing near the board, and bare  
The porridge-bowl and such-like gear  
Past where the men stood; tremblingly  
The leader of them drew anigh,  
And would have taken them, but she  
Swerved from his strong hand daintily,  
Smiled on him and passed by, and when  
They were set down turned back again  
And spoke, and well then might rejoice  
That dusky place to hear her voice  
For the first time:  
                    "I doubt me not,  
O seafarers, but ye have got  
A message from that goodly lord  
Who spake last year a pleasant word,  
Hard to believe for a poor maid."

   Trembled the twain at what she said  
Less than the unexpected sound,  
For death seemed in the air around.  
But the man spake: "E’en thus he saith,  
That he, who heretofore feared death  
In no-wise, feared this morn to come <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>  
And seek thee out in thy poor home,  
Lest he should find thee dead or gone;  
For scarce he deemed so sweet a one  
Could be for him: 'But if she live,'  
He said, 'and still her love can give  
To me, let her make no delay,  
For fear we see no other day  
Wherein to love.'"  
                  She said: "Come, then!  
It shames me not that of all men  
I love him best. But have ye there  
Somewhat these twain might reckon dear?  
Their life is ill enow to live  
But that withal they needs must strive  
With griping want when I am gone."

   He answered, "O thou goodly one,  
Here have we many a dear-bought thing,  
Because our master bade us bring  
All queenly gear for thee, and deems  
That thou, so clad as well beseems  
That lovely body, wouldst aboard;  
But all we have is at thy word  
To keep or spend."  
                   "Nay, friends," she said,  
"If thy lord loves my goodlihead,  
Fain would I bear alone to him  
What wealth I have of face or limb,  
For him to deck when all is his, <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>  
So full enow shall even this  
That I am dight with be for me;  
But since indeed of his bounty  
He giveth unto me to give—  
Take ye this gold, ye twain, and live  
E’en as ye may—small need to bless  
Or curse your sordid churlishness,  
Because methinks, without fresh curse,  
Each day that comes shall still be worse  
Than the past day, and worst of all  
Your ending day on you shall fall.  
Yet, if it may be, fare ye well,  
Since in your house I came to dwell  
A certain time of my life-days."

   E’en as she spake, her glorious face  
Shone the last time on that abode,  
And her light feet the daisies trod  
Outside the threshold. But the twain  
Stood 'mazed above the bounteous gain  
Of rings and gems and money bright,  
And a long while, for mere affright  
And wonder, durst not handle it.

   But while the butterfly did flit  
White round about the feet of her,  
Above the little May-flowers fair,  
She went adown the hill with these,  
Until the low wash of the seas <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
They heard, and murmuring of the men  
Who manned the long-ships; quickly then  
They showed above the grey bent's brow,  
And all the folk beheld them now  
’Twixt oar and gunwale that abode,  
And to the sky their shout rose loud.  
But when upon the beach she came,  
A bright thing in the sun did flame  
’Twixt sun and ship-side, and the sea  
Foamed, as one waded eagerly  
Unto the smooth and sea-beat sand,  
And for one moment did she stand  
Breathless, with beating heart, and then  
To right and left drew back the men;  
She heard a voice she deemed well known,  
Long waited through dull hours bygone,  
And round her mighty arms were cast:  
But when her trembling red lips passed  
From out the heaven of that dear kiss,  
And eyes met eyes, she saw in his  
Fresh pride, fresh hope, fresh love, and saw  
The long sweet days still onward draw,  
Themselves still going hand in hand,  
As now they went adown the strand. <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

 

 

NEXT morn, when they awoke to see  
Each other's hands draw lovingly  
Each unto each, awhile they lay  
Silent, as though night passed away  
They grudged full sore: till the King said  
Unto the happy golden head  
That lay upon his breast, "What thought  
By those few hours of dark was brought  
Unto thy heart, my love? Did dreams  
Make strange thy loving sleep with gleams  
Of changing days that yet may be?"

   She answered, but still dreamily:  
"In sleep a little while ago  
O’er a star-litten world of snow  
I fared, till suddenly nearby  
A swirling fire blazed up on high;  
Thereto I went, and without scathe  
Passed through the flame, as one doth bathe  
Within a summer stream, and there  
I saw a golden palace fair  
Ringed round about with roaring flame.  
Unto an open door I came,  
And entered a great hall thereby,  
And saw where ’neath a canopy  
A King and Queen there sat, more fair  
Than the world knoweth otherwhere: <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>  
And much methought my heart smiled then  
Upon that goodliest of all men,  
That sweetest of all womankind.  
Then one methought a horn did wind  
Without, and the King turned and spake:

   "'Wherewith do the hall pillars shake,  
O Queen, O love?'  
                      She moved her head,  
And in a voice like music said:  
'This is the fame of Ragnar's life,  
The breath of all the glorious strife  
Wherewith his days shall wear.'  
                                  Then he:  
'What is the shadow that I see  
Adown the hall?'  
                   Then said the Queen:  
'Our daughter surely hadst thou seen  
If thine eyes saw as clear as mine:  
Well worth she is our love divine,  
And unto Ragnar is she wed,  
The best man since that thou wert dead,  
My King, my love, mine own, mine own!'

   "Then the twain kissed upon the throne,  
And the dream passed and sleep passed too."

   Therewith the King her body drew  
Nearer to him, if it might be, <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
And spake: "A strange dream came to me.  
Upon a waste at dawn I went  
And wandered over vale and bent,  
And ever was it dawn of day,  
And still upon all sides there lay  
The bones of men, and war-gear turned  
To shards and rust; then far off burned  
A fire, and thither quick I passed.  
And when I came to it at last  
Dreadful it seemed, impassable;  
But I, fain of that land to tell  
What things soever might be known,  
Went round about, and up and down,  
And gat no passing by the same;  
Until, methought, just where the flame  
Burned highest, through the midst I saw  
A man and woman toward me draw,  
Even as through a flowery wood:  
So came they unto where I stood,  
And glad at heart therewith I grew,  
For such fair folk as were the two  
Ne’er had I seen; then the man cried:

   "'Hail to thee, Ragnar! well betide  
This dawn of day. Stretch forth thine hand.'

   "E’en as he bade me did I stand,  
Abiding what should hap, but he  
Turned to the woman lovingly, <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>  
And from her bosom's fresh delight  
Drew forth a blooming lily white,  
And set it in mine hand, and then  
Both through the flame went back again.

   "Then afterwards in earth I set  
This lily, and with soft regret  
Watched for its fading; but withal  
Great light upon the world did fall,  
And fair the sun rose o’er the earth,  
And blithe I grew and full of mirth:  
And no more on a waste I was,  
But in a green world, where the grass  
White lily-blooms well-nigh did hide;  
O’er hill and valley far and wide  
They waved in the warm wind; the sun  
Seemed shining upon everyone,  
As though it loved it: and with that  
I woke, and up in bed I sat  
And saw thee waking, O my sweet!"

   With that last word their lips did meet,  
And even the fresh May morning bright  
Was noted not in their delight.

   Let be—as ancient stories tell  
Full knowledge upon Ragnar fell  
In lapse of time, that this was she  
Begot in the felicity <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>  
Swift-fleeting of the wondrous twain,  
Who afterwards through change and pain  
Must live apart to meet in death.

   But, would ye know what the tale saith,  
In the old Danish tongue is writ  
Full many a word concerning it,—  
The days through which these lovers passed,  
Till death made end of all at last.  
But so great Ragnar's glory seemed  
To Northern folk, that many deemed  
That for his death, when song arose  
From that Northumbrian adder-close,  
England no due atonement paid  
Till Harald Godwinson was laid  
Beside his fallen banner, cold  
Upon the blood-soaked Sussex mould,  
And o’er the wrack of Senlac field  
Full-fed the grey-nebbed raven wheeled. <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

 

 

IN the dim place that the sun knew no more  
He rose up when his tale was fully o’er,  
And ’gan to pace the long hall to and fro  
With old eyes looking downward, e’en as though  
None else were there: at last with upraised face  
He walked back swiftly to his fire-lit place,  
And sat him down, and turned to the young folk  
Smiling perforce; then from their lips outbroke  
The murmuring speech his moody looks had stilled,  
And with a sweet sound was the hall fulfilled;  
E’en like the noise that from the thin wood's side  
Swims through the dawning day at April-tide  
Across the speckled eggs, when from the brown  
Soft feathers glittering eyes are looking down  
Over the dewy meads, too fresh and fair  
For aught but lovely feet to wander there.

   Drag on, long night of winter, in whose heart,  
Nurse of regret, the dead spring yet has part!  
Drag on, O night of dreams! O night of fears!  
Fed by the summers of the bygone years!
