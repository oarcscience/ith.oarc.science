### FEBRUARY.

NOON—and the north-west sweeps the empty road,  
The rain-washed fields from hedge to hedge are bare;  
Beneath the leafless elms some hind's abode  
Looks small and void, and no smoke meets the air  
From its poor hearth: one lonely rook doth dare  
The gale, and beats above the unseen corn,  
Then turns, and whirling down the wind is borne.

   Shall it not hap that on some dawn of May  
Thou shalt awake, and, thinking of days dead,  
See nothing clear but this same dreary day,  
Of all the days that have passed o’er thine head?  
Shalt thou not wonder, looking from thy bed,  
Through green leaves on the windless east a-fire,  
That this day too thine heart doth still desire?

   Shalt thou not wonder that it liveth yet,  
The useless hope, the useless craving pain,  
That made thy face, that lonely noontide, wet  
With more than beating of the chilly rain?  
Shalt thou not hope for joy new born again,  
Since no grief ever born can ever die  
Through changeless change of seasons passing by? <span id="page_232">p.

THE change has come at last, and from the west  
Drives on the wind, and gives the clouds no rest,  
And ruffles up the water thin that lies  
Over the surface of the thawing ice;  
Sunrise and sunset with no glorious show  
Are seen, as late they were across the snow;  
The wet-lipped west wind chilleth to the bone  
More than the light and flickering east hath done.  
Full soberly the earth's fresh hope begins,  
Nor stays to think of what each new day wins:  
And still it seems to bid us turn away  
From this chill thaw to dream of blossomed May:  
E’en as some hapless lover's dull shame sinks  
Away sometimes in day-dreams, and he thinks  
No more of yesterday's disgrace and foil,  
No more he thinks of all the sickening toil  
Of piling straw on straw to reach the sky;  
But rather now a pitying face draws nigh,  
Mid tears and prayers for pardon; and a tale  
To make love tenderer now is all the bale  
Love brought him erst.  
                          But on this chill dank tide  
Still are the old men by the fireside,  
And all things cheerful round the day just done  
Shut out the memory of the cloud-drowned sun, <span id="page_233">p.
233</span>  
And dripping bough and blotched and snow-soaked earth;  
And little as the tide seemed made for mirth,  
Scarcely they lacked it less than months agone,  
When on their wrinkles bright the great sun shone;  
Rather, perchance, less pensive now they were,  
And meeter for that cause old tales to hear  
Of stirring deeds long dead:  
                             So, as it fell,  
Preluding nought, an elder ’gan to tell  
The story promised in mid-winter days  
Of all that latter end of bliss and praise  
That erst befell Bellerophon the bright,  
Ere all except his name sank into night.
