<p><FONT SIZE="-1">HIPPONO&Uuml;S, son of Glaucus King of Corinth, unwittingly slew his brother Beller, and, fleeing from his country, came to Pr&#156;tus King of Argos, who purified him of his guilt; and thereafter was he called Bellerophon. He dwelt long with Pr&#156;tus, well loved by him, and receiving many good things at his hands; but at last he lost the King's favour by the guile of the Queen Sthenob&#156;a, and was sent to Jobates King of Lycia, her father, with a covert message of evil.</FONT></p>  
<p>PR&#140;TUS, the King of Argos, on a day<br> In tangled forests drave the boar to bay,<br> And had good hap, for ere the noon was o&#146;er<br> He set his foot upon the third huge boar<br> His steel that day had reached; then, fain of rest,<br> The greensward &#146;neath the spreading oak-trees pressed,<br> And, king-like, feasted with his folk around.<br> Nor lacked he for sweet music's measured sound,<br> For when somewhat were men's desires appeased<br> Of meat and drink, their weary limbs well eased,<br> There &#146;gan an ancient hunter and his son<br> To tell of glorious deeds in old days done<br> Within the wood; but as Ly&aelig;us&#146; gift,<br> And measured words from common life did lift <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A><br> The thoughts of men, and noble each man seemed<br> Unto his fellow, from afar there gleamed<br> Sun-litten arms, and &#146;twixt the singer's word<br> The slow tramp of a great horse soon they heard,<br> And from a glade that pierced the thicket through<br> In sight at last a mounted man there drew.<br> Then the dogs growled, and midst their weapons' clang<br> Unto their feet the outmost hunters sprang,<br> Handling their spears; but still King Pr&#156;tus lay,<br> Till nigh the circle that lone man made stay,<br> And with wild eyes gazed down upon the throng.<br> Wearied he seemed, and his black war-horse strong<br> On many a mile had left both sweat and blood,<br> And panting now with drooping head he stood,<br> Forgetting all the eager joys of speed;<br> And tattered was his rider's lordly weed,<br> His broken sheath now held a sword no more,<br> With rust his armour bright was spotted o&#146;er,<br> Unkempt and matted was the yellow hair<br> That crowned his head, nor was there helmet there;<br> His face, that should have been as fair and bright<br> And ruddy as a maid's, was deadly white,<br> And drawn and haggard; and his grey eyes stared,<br> As though of something he were sore afeard<br> That other folk saw not at all. But now<br> A hunter cried out, "Nay, and who art thou?<br> What God or man pursues thee? bide and speak;<br> Nor yet shalt thou for nought the King's rest break."<br> A scared look did the man behind him fling, <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A><br> Then said, "Stand close around me: to your King,<br> When I may see him, will I tell the tale;<br> Unless indeed, meanwhile, my life should fail."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, as one who hath but little might,<br> From off his wearied steed did he alight.<br> They led him to the King, who &#146;gainst a tree<br> Stood upright now, the new-come man to see;<br> Who brought unto him would not meet his eyes,<br> But stood and stared distraught in dreamy wise;<br> Till cheerily the King of Argos said,<br> "Cast somewhat off; O friend, thy drearyhead;<br> Sit thee and eat and drink, and be my guest;<br> I will not harm thee though thou be unblest;<br> Let Gods or men take vengeance as they can,<br> Nor ask my help, who dwell a peaceful man<br> &#146;Twixt white-walled Argos and the rustling trees."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man turned round, as asking what were these,<br> The words he said; then, casting here and there<br> A troubled look, as if not safe he were<br> From some dread thing that followed even yet,<br> He sat him down, and like a starved man ate:<br> Yet did he tremble as he took the food,<br> And in the cup he gazed, as though the blood<br> Of man it held, and not the blood of earth,<br> The stirrer up to kindly words and mirth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when his hunger now was satisfied,<br> Casting his hair aback the King he eyed,<br> And in a choked and husky voice he said: <A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A><br> "Now can ye see, O folk, I am not dead;<br> But tell me, King, how shall I name thee here,<br> Since he in whose heart lieth any prayer,<br> To nameless Gods will let no warm words flow?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To Pr&#156;tus pray for what thou wouldest now,"<br> The King said; "by the soil of Argos pray:<br> To no light matter will I say thee nay,<br> For my heart giveth to thee: name thy name,<br> And say whereby these evils on thee came."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With changing eyes now gazed the outcast man<br> On Pr&#156;tus&#146; cheery face, and colour ran<br> O&#146;er his wan visage. "Thou art kind," he said;<br> "But kinder eyes I knew, that on the dead<br> Must look for ever now; and joy is gone:<br> Best hadst thou cast forth such a luckless one;<br> For what I love I slay, and what I hate<br> I strive to save from out the hands of Fate.<br> Listen and let me babble: I have seen<br> Since that hour was, nought but the long leaves green,<br> The tree-trunks, and the scared things of the wood."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then silently awhile he seemed to brood<br> O&#146;er what had been, but even as the King<br> Opened his lips to mind him of the thing<br> That he should tell, from his bent head there came<br> Slow words, as if from one confessing shame,<br> While nigher to his mouth King Pr&#156;tus drew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hippono&uuml;s men have called me, ere I knew<br> The hate of Gods and fear of men; my life <A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A><br> Went past at Corinth free from baneful strife,<br> For there my father ruled from sea to sea,<br> Glaucus the Great: and fair Eurymede,<br> My mother, bare another son to him,<br> Like unto me in mind and face and limb,<br> Whom men called Beller; and most true it is<br> That I with him dwelt long in love and bliss,<br> However long ago that seems to be.<br> What plans we laid for joyous victory!<br> What lovely lands untilled we thought to win,<br> And be together even as Gods therein,<br> Bringing the monsters of the world to nought!<br> How eagerly from elders news we sought<br> Of lands that lay anigh the ocean-stream!<br> And yet withal what folly then did seem<br> Their cold words and their weary hopeless eyes,<br> When this alone of all things then seemed wise,<br> To know how sweet life was, how dear the earth,<br> And only fluttering hope stayed present mirth&#151;<br> Ah, how I babble! What a thing man is,<br> Who, falling unto misery out of bliss,<br> Thinks that new wisdom but the sole thing then<br> That binds the many ways of toiling men!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In one fair chamber did we sleep a-night,<br> I and my brother&#151;there, &#146;twixt light and light,<br> Three nights together did I dream a dream,<br> Where lying on my bed I still did seem<br> E&#146;en as I was indeed, when a cold hand <A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A><br> Was laid upon me, and a shape did stand<br> By my bed-head, a woman clad in grey,<br> Like to the lingering time &#146;twixt night and day,<br> And veiled her face was, and her tall gaunt form.<br> She drew me from my peaceful bed and warm,<br> And led me, shuddering, bare-foot, o&#146;er the floor,<br> Until, with beating heart, I stood before<br> My brother's bed, and knew what I should do;<br> For from beneath her shadowy robe she drew<br> A well-steeled feathered dart, and that must I,<br> Casting all will aside, clutch mightily,<br> And, still unable with her will to strive,<br> E&#146;en as her veiled hand pointed, madly drive<br> Into the heart of mine own mother's son,<br> Striving to scream as that ill deed was done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No cry came forth, but even with the stroke,<br> With sick and fainting heart, I nigh awoke.<br> And when the dream again o&#146;er me was cast,<br> Chamber, and all I knew, away had passed,<br> Nor saw I more the ghost: alone I stood<br> In a strange land, anigh an oaken wood<br> High on a hill; and far below my feet<br> The white walls of a glorious town did meet<br> A yellow strand and ship-beset green sea;<br> And all methought was as a toy for me,<br> For I was king thereof and great enow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But as I stood upon that hill's green brow, <A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A><br> Rejoicing much, yet yearning much indeed<br> For something past that still my heart must need,<br> Once more was all changed; by the windy sea<br> Did men hold games with great solemnity<br> In honour of some hero past away,<br> Whose body dead upon a huge pile lay<br> Waiting the torch, and people far and wide<br> About the strand a name I knew not cried,<br> Lamenting him who once had been their king;<br> But when I saw the face of the dead thing<br> Over whose head so many a cry was thrown<br> On to the wind, I knew it for mine own.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold pangs shot through me then, sleep's bonds I broke;<br> Shuddering with terror in my bed I woke,<br> And when thought came again, a weight of fear<br> Lay on my heart and still grew heavier<br> But when the next night and the third night came,<br> And still in sleep my visions were the same,<br> No longer in mine own heart could I hold<br> The story of that marvel quite untold,<br> For fear possessed me: good at first it seemed<br> That I should tell the dream so strangely dreamed<br> Unto my brother; then I feared that he<br> Might for that tale look with changed eyes on me<br> As deeming that some secret hope had wrought<br> Within my false heart, and that pageant brought<br> Before mine eyes; or he might flee the land <A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A><br> To save our house from some accursed hand;<br> And either way that dream seemed hard to tell<br> That yet, untold, made for my soul a hell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But of a certain elder now I thought,<br> Who much of lore to both of us had taught<br> And loved us well; Diana's priest was he,<br> And in the wild woods served her faithfully,<br> Dwelling with few folk in her woodland shrine.<br> That from the hillside such a man sees shine<br> As goes from Corinth unto Sicyon.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now amid these thoughts was night nigh done,<br> And the dawn glimmered; I grew hot to go<br> To that old priest these troublous things to show;<br> So from my bed I rose up silently,<br> And with all haste I did my weed on me,<br> And went unto the door; but as I passed<br> The fair porch through, I saw how &#146;gainst the last<br> Brass-adorned pillar lay a feathered dart;<br> And therewith came new fear into my heart,<br> For as the dart that I in dreams had seen<br> So was it fashioned, and with feathers green<br> And scarlet was the hinder end bedight,<br> And round the shaft were bands of silver white.<br> Then scarcely did I know if still I dreamed,<br> Yet, looking at the shaft, withal it seemed<br> Good unto me to take it in my hand,<br> That the old man the more might understand<br> How real my dream had been in very deed, <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A><br> And give me counsel better to my need.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With that I caught it up, and went my way,<br> And almost ere the sun had made it day<br> Was I within the woods, and hastening on,<br> Afire until the old man's house was won,<br> And like a man who walks in sleep I went,<br> Nor noted aught amid my strong intent.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when I reached the little forest fane<br> I found my labour had but been in vain;<br> For there the priest's folk told me he had gone<br> The eve before to Corinth, all alone,<br> And on some weighty matter, as they deemed;<br> For measurelessly troubled still he seemed.<br> His trouble troubled me, because I thought<br> That unto him sure knowledge had been brought<br> Of some great danger hanging over me,<br> And that he thither went my face to see,<br> While I was seeking him; and therewithal<br> Great fear and heaviness on me did fall;<br> And all the life I once had thought so sweet<br> Now seemed a troublous thing and hard to meet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So cityward again I set my face,<br> And through the woodland glades I rode apace,<br> And halfway betwixt dawn and noon had I<br> Unto the wood's edge once more come anigh;<br> And now upon the wind I seemed to hear<br> The sound of mingled voices drawing near;<br> Whereon I stayed to hearken and cried out,<br> But feeble was the sound from my parched throat; <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A><br> And listening afterward I heard not now<br> Those sounds, and timorous did my faint heart grow,<br> And tales of woodfolk my vexed mind did take.<br> But just as I the well-wrought reins would shake,<br> Grown nigher did I hear those sounds again,<br> And drew aback the hand that held the rein,<br> And even therewith stalked forth into the way<br> From out the thicket a huge wolf and grey,<br> And stood with yellow eyes that glared on me;<br> And I stared too; my folly made me see<br> No wolf, but some dread deity, in him;<br> But trembling as I was in every limb,<br> E&#146;en as his growling smote upon my heart,<br> Tighter my fingers clutched the dreadful dart,<br> I made a shift in stirrups up to stand,<br> And hurled the quivering shaft from out my hand;<br> Then fire seemed all around me, and a pang<br> Crushed down my heart as from the thicket rang<br> A dreadful cry: clear saw I, even as he<br> Who meets the Father's visage suddenly;<br> No wolf was there; but o&#146;er the herbage ran<br> With staggering steps a pale and bleeding man:<br> His left hand on the shaft, whose banded wood<br> Over the barbs within his bosom stood,<br> His right hand raised against me, as he fell<br> Close to my horse-hoofs; and I knew full well<br> That this my brother's last farewell should be,<br> And thus his face henceforward should I see. <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else? it matters not; the priest I saw,<br> And armed men from the thicket toward me draw,<br> With scared eyes fixed on mine; I drew my sword,<br> And sat there, waiting for a dreadful word,<br> Bidding the rush of many men on me;<br> But they began to draw round silently,<br> And ere the circle yet was fully made,<br> I, who at first might even thus have stayed<br> For death and curses, felt the love of life<br> Stir up my heart again to hope and strife;<br> Yea, even withal I saw in one bright gleam<br> The latter ending of my dreaded dream.<br> So, crying out, strongly my horse I spurred,<br> And as he, rearing up, dashed forth, I heard<br> Clatter of arms and cries, a spear flew o&#146;er<br> My bended head, a well-aimed arrow tore<br> My helm therefrom; yet then a cry there came:<br> 'Take him alive, nor bring a double shame<br> Upon the great house!' Even therewith I drave<br> Against a mighty man as wave meets wave;<br> Back flew my right arm, and my sword was gone,<br> Whirled off as from a sling the wave-worn stone,<br> And my horse reeled, but he before me lay<br> Rolled over, horse and man, and in my way<br> Was no one now, as I spurred madly on:<br> And so in no long time the race I won,<br> For nobly was I mounted; and I deem<br> That to the most of those men did it seem<br> No evil thing that I should &#146;scape away. <A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King, I think this happed but yesterday,<br> And now already do I deem that I<br> Did no good deed in seeking not to die,<br> For I am weary, and the Gods made me<br> A luckless man among all folk to be&#151;<br> I care not if their purpose I undo,<br> Since now I doubt not that the thing is so&#151;<br> &#151;And yet am I so made, that, having life,<br> Must I, though ever worsted in the strife,<br> Cling to it still too much to gain the rest<br> Which yet I know of all things is the best.<br> Then slay me, King! to now, I pray for this,<br> And no least portion of thy hoarded bliss;<br> Slay me, and let the oak-boughs say their say<br> Over my bones through the wild winter day!<br> Slay me, for I am fain thereto to go,<br> Where no talk is of either bliss or woe."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said the King, "didst thou not eat and drink<br> When hunger drave thee e&#146;ennow? yea, and shrink<br> When my men's spears were pointed at thy breast?<br> Be patient; thou indeed shalt gain thy rest,<br> But many a thing has got to come ere then:<br> For all things die, and thou midst other men<br> Shalt scarce remember thou hast had a friend.<br> At worst before thou comest to the end<br> Joy shalt thou have, and sorrow: wherefore come;<br> With me thou well mayst have no hapless home.<br> Dread not the Gods; ere long time has gone by <A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A><br> Thy soul from all guilt will we purify,<br> And sure no heavy curse shall lie on thee.<br> Nay, did their anger cause this thing to be?<br> Perchance in heaven they smile upon thy gain&#151;<br> &#151;Lo, for a little while a burning pain,<br> Then yearning unfulfilled a little space,<br> Then tender memories of a well-loved face<br> In quiet hours, and then&#151;forgetfulness&#151;<br> How hadst thou rather borne, still less and less<br> To love what thou hadst loved, till it became<br> A thing to be forgotten, a great shame<br> To think thou shouldst have wasted life thereon?<br> Come then&#151;thou spakest of a kingdom won<br> Thy dream foretold, and shall not this be too,<br> E&#146;en as the dreadful deed thou cam&#146;st to do?<br> To horse! and unto Argos let us wend,<br> Begin thy life afresh with me for friend.<br> Wide is the world, nor yet for many a day<br> Will every evil thing be cleared away<br> That bringeth scathe to men within its girth;<br> Surely a man like thee can win the mirth<br> That cometh of the conquering of such things;<br> For not in vain art thou the seed of kings<br> Unless thy face belie thee&#151;nay, no more:<br> Why speak I vain words to a heart still sore<br> With sudden death of happiness? yet come<br> And ride with us unto our lovely home."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hippono&uuml;s to the King's word answered nought, <A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A><br> But sat there brooding o&#146;er his dreary thought,<br> Nor seemed to hear; and when the Argive men<br> Brought up to him his battle-steed again,<br> Scarce witting of the company or place,<br> He mounted, and with set and weary face<br> Rode as they bade him at the King's left hand:<br> Nor did the sight of the fair well-tilled land,<br> When that they gained from out the tangled wood,<br> Do aught in dealing with his mournful mood;<br> Nor Argos&#146; walls as from the fields they rose,<br> Such good things with their mightiness to close<br> From chance of hurt; scarce saw he the fair gate,<br> Dainty to look on, yet so huge of weight;<br> Nor did the streets&#146; well-ordered houses draw<br> His eyes to look at them; unmoved he saw<br> The south-land merchants&#146; dusky glittering train;<br> About the fountain the slim maids in vain<br> Drew sleek arms from the water, or turned round<br> With shaded eyes at the great horn's hoarse sound.<br> The sight of the King's house, deemed of all men<br> A wonder mid the houses kings had then,<br> Drew from him but a troubled frown, as though<br> Men's toilsome folly he began to know;<br> The carven Gods within the banquet-hall,<br> The storied hangings that bedight the wall,<br> Made his heart sick to think of labour vain,<br> Telling once more the oft-told tale of pain.<br> Cold in the damsel's hand his strong hand lay,<br> When to the steaming bath she led the way; <A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A><br> And when another damsel brought for him<br> Raiment wherein the Tyrian dye showed dim<br> Amid the gold lines of the broideries,<br> Her face downcast because she might not please,<br> He heeded not. When to the hall he passed,<br> And by the high seat he was set at last,<br> Then Pr&#156;tus, smiling from his mild eyes, laid<br> A hand upon his combed-out hair and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Surely for no good luck this golden hair<br> Has come to Argos, and this visage fair,<br> To make us, who were well enow before,<br> Seem to our maids like churls at the hall-door,<br> Prying about when men to war are gone<br> And girls and children sit therein alone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nought Hippono&uuml;s heeded the King's say,<br> But, turning, roughly put his hand away,<br> And frowning muttered, and still further drew,<br> As a man touched amid his dream might do.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sooth he dreamed, and dreary was his dream;<br> A bitter thing the world to him did seem;<br> The void of life to come he peopled now<br> With folk of scornful eyes and brazen brow;<br> And one by one he told the tale of days<br> Wherein an envious mock was the world's praise;<br> Where good deeds brought ill fame, and truth was not,<br> Hate was remembered, love was soon forgot;<br> No face was good for long to look upon, <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A><br> And nought was worthy when it once was won;<br> And narrow, helpless, friendless was the way,<br> That led unto the last most hopeless day<br> Of hopeless days, in tangled, troubled wise.<br> So thought he, till the tears were in his eyes<br> Since he was young yet, for hope lying dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on his fixed eyes and his weary head<br> The happy King of Argos gazed awhile,<br> Till from his eye faded the scornful smile<br> That lingered on his lips; and now he turned,<br> As one who long ago that task had learned,<br> And unto the great men about him spoke,<br> And was a merry king of merry folk.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the feast and all men drew to sleep,<br> And e&#146;en Hippono&uuml;s his soul might steep<br> In sweet forgetfulness a little while;<br> And somewhat did the fresh young day beguile<br> His treasured sorrow when he woke next morn,<br> And somewhat less he felt himself forlorn:<br> Nor did the King forget him, but straight sent<br> Unto the priests, and told them his intent<br> That this his guest should there be purified,<br> Since he with honour in his house should bide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was Jove's house made ready for that thing,<br> And thither amid songs and harp-playing,<br> White-robed and barefoot, was Hippono&uuml;s brought;<br> Who, bough in hand, for peace the God besought. <A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A><br> Noiseless the white bulls fell beneath the stroke<br> Of the gold-girdled, well-taught temple folk:<br> Up to the roof arose the incense-cloud;<br> The chanted prayer of men, now low now loud,<br> Thrilled through the brazen leaves of the great door;<br> Thick lay the scattered herbs upon the floor,<br> And in the midst at last the hero stood,<br> Freed of the guilt of shedding kindred blood.<br> And then the chief priest cried, "Bellerophon,<br> With this new hapless name that thou hast won,<br> Go forth, go free, be happy once again,<br> But no more called Hippono&uuml;s of men."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then forth Bellerophon passed wearily,<br> Although so many prayers had set him free;<br> Yet somewhat was he ready to forget,<br> And turn unto the days that might be yet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when before King Pr&#156;tus&#146; throne he came,<br> The King called out on him by his new name;<br> "O fair Bellerophon, like me, be wise,<br> And set things good to win before thine eyes,<br> Lands, and renown, and riches, and a life<br> That knows from day to day so much of strife<br> As makes men happy, since the age of gold<br> Is past, if e&#146;er it was, as a tale told."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King," he said, "thou sittest in full day,<br> Thou strivest to put thoughts of night away; <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A><br> My life has not yet left the morning-tide,<br> And I, who find the world that seemed so wide,<br> Now narrowed to a little troublous space<br> Where help is not, astonied turn my face<br> Unto the coming hours, nor know at all<br> What thing of joy or hope to me will fall.<br> Be patient, King; perchance within a while<br> No marfeast I may be, but learn to smile<br> Even as thou, who lovest life so much.<br> Who knows but grief may vanish at a touch,<br> As joy does? and a long way off is death:<br> Some folk seem glad even to draw their breath."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," said the King, "thou hast it, for indeed<br> I fain would live, like most men&#151;but what need<br> Unto a fevered man to talk of wine?<br> Thy heart shall love life when it grows like mine.<br> But come thou hence, and I will show to thee<br> What things of price the Gods have given to me.<br> Not good it is to harp on the frayed string;<br> And thou, so seeing many a lovely thing,<br> Mayst hide thy weary pain a little space."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewith did King Pr&#156;tus from that place<br> Draw forth Bellerophon, and so when he<br> In his attire was now clad royally,<br> From out the precinct to his palace fair<br> Did the King bring him; and he showed him there<br> His stables, where the war-steeds stood arow <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A><br> Over the dusty grain: then did they go<br> To armouries, where sword and spear and shield<br> Hung bloodless, ready for the fated field:<br> The treasury showed he, where things richly wrought<br> Together into such a place were brought,<br> That he who stole the oxen of a God,<br> For all his godlike cunning scarce had trod<br> Untaken on its floor&#151;withal he showed<br> The chamber where the broidered raiment glowed,<br> Where the spice lay, and scented unguents fit<br> To touch Queen Venus&#146; skin and brighten it;<br> The ivory chairs and beds of ivory<br> He showed him, and he bid his tired eyes see<br> The stories wrought on brazen doors, the flowers<br> And things uncouth carved on the wood of bowers;<br> The painted walls that told things old and new.<br> Things come to pass, and things that onward drew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the while Bellerophon's grave face<br> And soon-passed smile seemed unmeet for that place,<br> And ever Pr&#156;tus felt a pang of fear,<br> As if it told of times a-drawing near,<br> When all the wealth and beauty that was his<br> Should not avail to buy one hour of bliss.<br> And sometimes when he watched his wandering eyes<br> And heard his stammering speech, would there arise<br> Within his heart a feeling like to hate,<br> Mingled with scorn of one so crushed by fate:<br> For ever must the rich man hate the poor. <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the last they stood before a door<br> Adorned with silver, wrought of precious wood;<br> Then Pr&#156;tus laughed, and said, "O guest, thy mood<br> Is hard to deal with; never any leech<br> Has striven as I thy sickness&#146; heart to reach;<br> And I grow weary and must get me aid."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith upon the lock his hand he laid<br> And pushed the door aback, and then the twain<br> The daintiest of all passages did gain,<br> And as betwixt its walls they passed along<br> Nearer they drew unto the measured song<br> Of sweet-voiced women; and the King spake then:<br> "Drive fire out with fire, say all wise men;<br> Here mayst thou set thine eyes on such an one,<br> That thou no more wilt think of days agone,<br> But days to come; for here indeed my spouse<br> Watches the damsels in the weaving-house,<br> Or in the pleasance sits above their play;<br> And certes here upon no long-passed day,<br> Unless my eyes were bleared with coming eld,<br> Fair sights for such as thou have I beheld."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the exile's brow a frown there came,<br> As though his sorrow of such things thought shame,<br> Yet mayhap his eye brightened as he heard<br> The song grow louder and the hall they neared;<br> But the King smiled, and swiftlier led him on,<br> Until unto the door thereof they won. <A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW noble was that hall and fair enow,<br> Betwixt whose slim veined pillars set arow,<br> And marble lattice wrought like flowering trees,<br> Showed the green freshness of the summer seas,<br> Made cheery by the sun and many a ship,<br> Whose black bows smoothly through the waves did slip.<br> In bowls whereon old stories pictured were<br> The bright rose-laurels trembled in the air,<br> That from the sea stole through the lattices,<br> And round them hummed a few bewildered bees.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midmost the pavement wrought by toil of years,<br> A tree was set, gold-leaved like that which bears<br> Unto the maids of Hesperus strange fruit;<br> A many-coloured serpent from the root<br> Curled upward round the stem, and, reaching o&#146;er<br> A four-square silver laver, did outpour<br> Bright glittering water from his throat of brass;<br> And at each corner of the basin was<br> A brazen hart who seemed at point to drink;<br> And these the craftsman had not made to shrink<br> Though in the midst Diana's feet pressed down<br> The forest greensward, and her girded gown<br> Cleared from the brambles fell about her thigh,<br> And eager showed her terrible bright eye.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &#146;twixt the pillars and that marvellous thing<br> Were scattered those they had e&#146;en now heard sing; <A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A><br> Their song had sunk now, and a murmuring voice,<br> But mingled with the clicking loom's sharp noise<br> And splashing of the fountain, where a maid<br> With one hand lightly on a brass deer laid,<br> One clasped about her own foot, knelt to watch<br> Her brazen jar the tinkling water catch;<br> Withal the wool-comb's sound within the fleece<br> Began and grew, and slowly did decrease,<br> And then began as still it gat new food;<br> And by the loom an ancient woman stood<br> And grumbled o&#146;er the web; and on the floor<br> Ten spindles twisted ever; from the store<br> Raised on high pillars at the gable end.<br> Adown a steep stair did a maiden wend,<br> Who in the wide folds of her gathered gown<br> Fresh yarn bright-dyed unto the loom bare down.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the downy cushions of a throne,<br> Above all this sat the fair Queen alone,<br> Who heeded not the work, nor noted aught;<br> Nor showed indeed that there was any thought<br> Within her heaving breast; but though she moved<br> No whit the limbs a God might well have loved,<br> Although her mouth was as of one who lies<br> In peaceful sleep; though over her deep eyes<br> No shadow came to trouble her white brow,<br> Yet might you deem no rest was on her now;<br> Rather too weary seemed she e&#146;en to sigh<br> For foolish life that joyless passed her by. <A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thus the King Bellerophon led in<br> Just as the old song did again begin<br> From the slim maids, that by the loom's side spun;<br> But ere it had full sway, the nighest one<br> Unto the door stopped singing suddenly,<br> And pressed her neighbour's arm, that she might see<br> What new folk were come in; and therewithal<br> An angry glance from the Queen's eyes did fall<br> Upon the maid; so that Bellerophon<br> A cruel visage had to look upon,<br> When first he saw the Queen raised high above<br> The ordered tresses of that close of love.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the women knew the King indeed<br> They did him reverence, and with lowly heed<br> Made way for him, while a girl here and there<br> Made haste to hide what labour had made bare<br> Of limb or breast; and the King smiled through all,<br> And now and then a wandering glance let fall<br> Upon some fairest face; and so at last<br> Through the sweet band unto the Queen they passed,<br> Who rose and waited them by her fair throne<br> With eyes wherefrom all care once more had gone<br> Of life and what it brought: then the King said&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sthenob&#156;a, hither have I led<br> A man, who, from a happy life down-hurled,<br> Looks with sick eyes upon this happy world;<br> Not knowing how to stay here or depart:<br> Thou know&#146;st and I know how the wounded heart<br> Forgetteth pain and groweth whole again, <A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A><br> Yet is the pain that passes no less pain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But since this man is noble even as we,<br> And help begets help, and withal to me<br> Worthy he seems to be a great king's friend,<br> Now help me to begin to make an end<br> Of his so heavy mood; for though indeed<br> This daintiness may nowise help his need,<br> Yet may kind words avail to make him kind<br> Unto himself; kind eyes may make him blind<br> Unto the ugly, tangled whirl of life;<br> Or in some measured image of real strife<br> He may forget the things that he has lost,<br> Nor think of how he needs must yet be tost<br> Like other men from wave to wave of fate."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravely she set herself the end to wait<br> Of the King's speech; and what of scorn might be<br> Within her heart changed nowise outwardly<br> Her eyes that looked with scorn on everything;<br> And yet withal while still the cheery King<br> Let his tale flow, unto the exile's place<br> She glanced with scornful wonder at his face<br> At first, because she deemed it soft and kind;<br> Yet was he fair, and she&#151;she needs must find<br> Something that drew her to his wide grey eyes;<br> And presently as with some great surprise<br> Her heart &#146;gan beat, and she must strive in vain<br> To crush within it a sweet rising pain,<br> She deemed to be that pity that she knew <A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A><br> As the last folly wise folk turn unto.<br> For pain was wont to rouse her rage, and she<br> Was like those beasts that slaughter cruelly<br> Their wounded fellows&#151;truth she knew not of,<br> And fain had killed folk babbling over love;<br> Justice she thought of as a thing that might<br> Balk some desire of hers, before the night<br> Of death should end it all: nor hope she knew,<br> Nor what fear was, how ill soe&#146;er life grew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wisdom had she more than most of folk,<br> That through the painted cloud of lies she broke<br> To gain what brought her pleasure for awhile,<br> However men might call it nought and vile;<br> Nor was she one to make a piteous groan<br> O&#146;er bitter pain amid her pleasure grown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was one of those wrought by the gods<br> To be to foolish men as sharpest rods<br> To scourge their folly; wrought so daintily<br> That scarcely could a man her body see<br> Without awaking strife &#146;twixt good and ill<br> Within him; and her sweet, soft voice would fill<br> Men's hearts with strange desires, and her great eyes,<br> Truthful to show her to the cold and wise<br> E&#146;en as she was, would make some cast aside<br> Whatever wisdom in their breasts might hide,<br> And still despite what long ill days might prove,<br> They called her languid hate the soul of love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that fire that to her eyes arose <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><br> She cast aback awhile to lie all close<br> About her heart; her full lips trembled not,<br> And from her cheek faded the crimson spot<br> That erst increased thereon.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Prince," she said,<br> "Strive to get back again thy goodlihead;<br> Life flitteth fast, and while it still abides,<br> Our folly many a good thing from us hides,<br> That else would pierce our hearts with its delight<br> Unto the quick, in all the Gods&#146; despite."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed upon her wondering, for again<br> That new-born hope, that sweet and bitter pain,<br> Flushed her smooth cheek, and glittered in her eyes,<br> And wrought within her lips; yet was she wise,<br> And gazing on his pale and wondering face,<br> In his frank eyes she did not fail to trace<br> A trouble like unto a growing hate,<br> That, yet unknown to him, her love did wait;<br> Then once more did she smother up that flame,<br> Calm grew she, from her lips a false voice came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, and bethink thee, mayst thou not be born<br> To raise the crushed and succour the forlorn,<br> And in the place of sorrow to set mirth,<br> Gaining a great name through the wondering earth?<br> Now surely has my lord the King done well<br> To bring thee here thy tale to me to tell;<br> Come, then, for nearby such a bower there is <A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A><br> As most men deem to be a place of bliss;<br> There, when thy tale is o&#146;er that I am fain<br> To hearken, may sweet music ease thy pain<br> Amidst our feast; or of these maids shall one<br> Read of some piteous thing the Gods have done<br> To us poor folk upon the earth that dwell.<br> Yea, and the reader will I choose so well,<br> That such an one herself shall seem to be<br> As she of whom the tale tells piteously.<br> And thou shalt hear when all is past and o&#146;er,<br> And with its sorrow still thine heart is sore,<br> The Lydian flutes come nigher and more nigh,<br> Till glittering raiment cometh presently,<br> And thou behold&#146;st the dance of the slim girls,<br> Wavering and strange as the leaf-wreath that whirls<br> Down in the marble court we walk in here<br> Mid sad October, when the rain draws near:<br> So delicate therewith, that when all sound<br> Of sobbing flute has left the air around,<br> And, panting, lean the dancers against wall<br> And well-wrought pillar, you hear nought at all<br> But their deep breathing, so are all men stilled,<br> So full their hearts with all that beauty filled."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coldly and falsely was her speech begun,<br> But she waxed warm ere all the tale was done;<br> Nay, something soft was in her voice at last,<br> As round his soul her net she strove to cast<br> Almost despite herself. <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmoved he stood,<br> But that some thought did cross his weary mood<br> That made him knit his brow, and therewith came<br> A flush across his face as if of shame<br> Because of that new thought; but when an end<br> Her speech had, then he spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What love or friend<br> Can do me good? God-hated shall I be,<br> And bring to no man aught but misery;<br> And thou, O royal man, and thou, O Queen,<br> Who heretofore in bliss and mirth have been,<br> Hearken my words, and on your heads be all<br> The trouble that from me shall surely fall<br> If I abide with you.: yet doubt it not<br> That this your love shall never be forgot<br> Wherewith ye strive to win a helpless man,<br> And ever will I labour as I can<br> To make my ill forebodings come to nought."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But midst these things, pleased by some hidden thought,<br> The King smiled, turning curious eyes on them,<br> And smoothing down his raiment's golden hem<br> As one who hearkens music; then said he,<br> "Wilt thou give word for our festivity,<br> O Sthenob&#156;a? But come thou, O guest,<br> And by the great sea we will take our rest,<br> Speaking few words."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from her golden throne <A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A><br> She passed to do what things must needs be done,<br> And with firm feet amid her maids she went<br> On this new tyrannous sweetness all intent;<br> So did it work in her, that scarcely she<br> Might bear the world now, as she turned to see<br> The stranger and the King a-going down<br> By marble stairs unto the foreshores brown.<br> So slipped the morn away, and when the sun<br> His downward course some three hours had begun,<br> Summoned by sound of horns they took their way<br> Unto a bower that looking westward lay,<br> Yet was by trellised roses shaded so<br> That little of the hot sun did it know<br> But what the lime-trees&#146; honey-sweet scent told,<br> And their wide wind-stirred leaves, turned into gold<br> Against the bright rays of the afternoon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to that chamber came the fair Queen soon,<br> Well harbingered by flutes; nor had she spared<br> To veil her limbs in raiment that had fared<br> O&#146;er many a sea, before it had the hap<br> The Lycian's smooth skin in its folds to lap.<br> But as she entered there in queenly guise,<br> With firm and haughty step, and careless eyes<br> Over the half-hid beauty of her breast,<br> One moment on the exile did they rest,<br> And softened to a meek, imploring gaze&#151;<br> One moment only; as with great amaze<br> His eyes beheld her, doubtful what was there, <A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A><br> All had gone thence, but the proud empty stare<br> That she was wont to turn on everything.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal she sat her down beside the King,<br> And the feast passed with much of such delight<br> As makes to happy men the world seem bright,<br> But from the hapless draws but hate and scorn,<br> Because the Gods both happy and forlorn<br> Have set in one world, each to each to be<br> A vain rebuke, a bitter memory.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the Queen held her word, and when that they<br> Had heard the music sing adown the day,<br> After the dancing women had but left<br> Sweet honeyed scents behind, or roses, reft<br> By their own hands from head or middle small,<br> Then came with hurried steps into the hall<br> The reader and her scroll; sweet-eyed was she,<br> And timid as some loving memory<br> Midst the world's clamour: clad in gown of wool<br> She sat herself adown upon a stool<br> Anigh the proud feet of the Lycian Queen,<br> And straight, as if no soul she there had seen,<br> With slender hand put back her golden hair,<br> And &#146;gan to read from off the parchment fair.<br> In a low voice, and trembling at the first,<br> She read a tale of lovers&#146; lives accurst<br> By cruel Gods and careless foolish men:<br> Like dainty music was her voice, and when<br> From out her heart she sighed, as she must read<br> Of folk unholpen in their utmost need, <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><br> Still must the stranger turn kind eyes on her.<br> At last awhile she paused, as she drew near<br> The bitter end of spilt and wasted bliss,<br> And death unblessed at last by any kiss;<br> Her voice failed, and adown her book did sink,<br> And midst them all awhile she seemed to think<br> Of the past days herself; but still so much<br> Her beauty and the tale their hearts did touch,<br> Folk held their breath till she began again,<br> And something &#146;twixt a pleasure and a pain<br> It was when all the sweet tale was read o&#146;er<br> And her voice quivered through the air no more.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then round the maiden's neck King Pr&#156;tus cast<br> A golden chain, and from the hall she passed,<br> And yet confused and shamefaced; for the Queen,<br> Who at the first the Prince's eyes had seen<br> Upon the maid, and then would look no more,<br> But kept her eyes fixed on the marble floor<br> As listening to the tale; her head now raised,<br> And with cold scorn upon the maiden gazed<br> As she bent down the golden gift to take;<br> And meanwhile, for her tender beauty's sake,<br> Over the exile's face a pleased smile came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she departed to the bliss or shame<br> Life had for her, and all folk left the bower;<br> For now was come the summer night's mid-hour:<br> The great high moon that lit the rippling sea<br> &#146;Twixt the thin linden-trees shone doubtfully <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A><br> Upon the dim grey garden; the sea-breeze<br> Stooped down on the pleached alleys; the tall trees<br> Over the long roofs moved their whispering leaves,<br> Nor woke the dusky swifts beneath the eaves.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW from that fair night wore the time away,<br> Until with lapse of many a quiet day,<br> And stirring times withal, Bellerophon<br> To love of life and hope of joy was won.<br> Still grave and wise he was beyond his years,<br> No eager man among his joyous peers<br> To snatch at pleasure; careful not to cheat<br> His soul with vain desires all over sweet;<br> A wary walker on the road of life;<br> E&#146;en as a man who in a garden, rife<br> With flowers, has gone unarmed, and found that there<br> Are evil things amid the blossoms fair,<br> And paid with wounds for folly: yet when he<br> Is whole once more, since there he needs must be,<br> And has no will its sweets to cast aside,<br> Well armed he walks there ware of beasts that hide<br> Beneath the shade of those vine-trellises,<br> Amid the grey stems of the apple-trees.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet at his heart, about the root of it <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><br> Strange thoughts there lay, which at sweet times would flit<br> Before his eyes, as things grown palpable;<br> Strange hopes that made the weltering world seem well<br> While he abode there: therefore was he kind<br> To man and maid, and all men's hearts did bind<br> With bonds of love, for mid the struggling folk,<br> The forgers and the bearers of the yoke,<br> Weary with wronging and with wrongs, he seemed<br> As one on whom a light from heaven had beamed,<br> That changed him to a god yet being alive.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But midst all folk there did King Pr&#156;tus give<br> Great gifts to him; great trust in him he had,<br> And ever by his sight was he made glad:<br> For well did all things prosper in his hand,<br> Nor was there such another in the land<br> For strength or goodliness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so it was,<br> That he on matters of the King would pass<br> About the country here and there, nor dwell<br> At Argos much, and that thing pleased him well;<br> For while all else grew better, ye shall know<br> That greater in his heart the fear did grow<br> That sprung up therein on that summer eve;<br> And though sometimes the Queen would make believe<br> To heed him nought&#151;yea, or depart maybe<br> At whiles, when he the King would come to see&#151;<br> Yet was this but at whiles; the next day came,<br> And scarce would she hold parley with her shame. <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One noon of the late autumn, when the sun<br> Brightened the parting year, so nearly done,<br> With rays as hot as early June might shed,<br> Dawn past an hour, upon the tulip-bed,<br> In the great pleasance, &#146;neath a wall of yew,<br> Walked the Corinthian, pondering what to do<br> In some great matter late given unto him.<br> So clad he was, that both on breast and limb<br> Steel glittered, though his head as yet was bare;<br> But in his face was just so much of care<br> As seemed to show he had got that to do<br> He feared but little well to carry through,<br> But which must have his heed a little while:<br> And still in going would he stop and smile,<br> And seem to cast the shreds of thought away<br> In honour of the bright fresh autumn day<br> And all the pleasure of the lovely place.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the last, turning about his face<br> Unto the sunny garden's other side,<br> He saw where, down a grassy path and wide,<br> The Queen came, with her head bent down to earth,<br> As though mid thoughts she were that slew her mirth;<br> Slowly she went, with two maids following her,<br> Who in their delicate slim hands did bear,<br> The one a cithern and some verse-book old,<br> The other a white osier maund, to hold<br> Some of such flowers as still in fear and doubt<br> Against the sickness of the year held out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as they went, nigh to the Prince they drew, <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A><br> And soon the maidens&#146; eyes his beauty knew,<br> And one at other glanced, smiling and glad,<br> For soft love of him in their hearts they had;<br> Yet nought they said, nor did the Queen turn round,<br> But kept her eyes still bent upon the ground.<br> So in their walk they came to where there stood<br> A thin-leaved apple-tree, where, red as blood,<br> Yellow as gold, a little fruit hung yet,<br> The last rays of the fainting sun to get;<br> And a tall clump of autumn flowers, cold-grey,<br> Beneath it, mocked the promise of the day,<br> And to them clung a hapless bee or twain,<br> A butterfly spread languid wings in vain<br> Unto the sun, that scarce could heat her now.<br> There the Queen stayed awhile her footsteps slow,<br> And to the flowers wandered her slender hand;<br> But with her eyes cast down she still did stand,<br> And pondered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of melody and peace<br> About her was the lingering year's decease;<br> Strange spicy scents there were that yet were sweet,<br> Green was the grass about her gold-shod feet,<br> And had no memory of the dawn's white rime;<br> Loud was the birds&#146; song in that windless time,<br> Strange the sharp crying of the missel-thrush<br> Within the close heart of the hawthorn-bush,<br> Strange the far-off rooks&#146; sweet tumultuous voice<br> That in the high elms e&#146;en now must rejoice<br> And know not why&#151;peace e&#146;en if end of peace. <A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while her burning heart did never cease<br> To give words to such longings, as she knew<br> To swift destruction all her glory drew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! mine, mine, mine!" she thought, "ah! mine a while!<br> Ah! mine a little day, if all be vile<br> The coming years can bring unto my heart!<br> Ah! mine this eve, if we to-morn must part!<br> Mine, that a sweet hour I may know at last<br> How soon soever all delight is passed!<br> Ah! mine, mine, mine, if for a little while!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So stood she, that her parted lips did smile<br> As if of one that memories make half sad,<br> Her breast heaved, as no stronger wish she had<br> Than for some careless lover, lightly won,<br> And soon forgot, to lay his lips thereon;<br> The flower-stem that her finger-tips did hold<br> Was crushed not, and within her shoe of gold<br> Lightly her foot was laid upon the grass;<br> No tremors through her dainty limbs did pass,<br> And healthy life alone did paint her cheek:<br> For if indeed at first she had felt weak,<br> Ere well she knew what she was bent upon,<br> Now at the last, when every doubt was gone,<br> She would not show the net unto the prey<br> Until she deemed that in her toils he lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised her eyes at last with a light sigh, <A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A><br> Despite herself, a flush passed suddenly<br> Over her face, and then all pale she grew;<br> For now withal Bellerophon she knew,<br> Though at that very point of time the sun<br> Along his upraised steel-clad arm had run,<br> And made an earthly sun that dazzled her.<br> Yet cast she back her trembling hope and fear<br> Into her heart, and as before she went<br> Slowly, with head a little downward bent,<br> But when she had gone on a few yards space,<br> Once more unto the Prince she raised her face;<br> Then stopped again, and turning round, she said,<br> From lips wherein all passion now seemed dead:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damsels, go home again; thou, Mysian, go<br> Unto the little treasury thou dost know<br> Anigh my bower, and taking this gold key,<br> Draw forth that ancient prophet's book for me<br> Which shows the stars: for that I fain would show<br> To Prince Bellerophon, who bides me now<br> Ere he goes forth to bring the island folk<br> Once more beneath King Pr&#156;tus' equal yoke.<br> And thou, Leucippe, bide our coming there,<br> And bid our folk set forth a feast as fair<br> As may be done; for we within a while<br> May need thy cithern dull thoughts to beguile."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as they turned she passed on carelessly<br> Toward the Prince, nor looked aback to see<br> That they were gone; but he indeed had heard <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A><br> Through the calm air her clearly-spoken word,<br> And saw the maidens go, and felt as one<br> Who bideth, when the herald's speech is done,<br> The word that bids the grinded spears fall down.<br> But she, with slim hand folded in her gown,<br> Went o&#146;er the dewy grass to where he stood,<br> And in despite the fire within her blood<br> Was calm, and smiled on him, till nigh he thought<br> That surely all his fear was vain and nought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed before her as she drew anear,<br> But she held out her right hand, and in clear<br> Sweet tones she cried, "O fair Bellerophon,<br> Would that the victory were already won,<br> And thou wert back again at this thy home<br> We have made glad for thee: behold! I come<br> To say farewell&#151;yet come a little way&#151;<br> For something else indeed I had to say."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still she held his hand, but yet durst not<br> Clasp as she would the treasure she had got.<br> Then to a place together did they pass,<br> Where yew-trees hemmed around a plot of grass,<br> And kept it scarce touched by the faint sun's rays&#151;<br> A place well made for burning summer days,<br> But cheerless now. There on a marble seat<br> She bade him sit; while she with restless feet<br> Paced to and fro, while from the yew-twigs close,<br> With his scared cry the creeping blackbird rose.<br> But he, with eyes cast down upon the ground, <A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A><br> Deemed that his battle easier would be found<br> Than this.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so at last she stayed by him<br> And cried: "The cup is full unto the brim;<br> For now thou goest where thou mayst be slain:<br> I speak then&#151;and, alas! I speak in vain&#151;<br> Thy cold eyes tell me so&#151;How shall I move<br> Thy flinty heart my curse has made me love?<br> For what have other women done, when they<br> Were fair as I, and love before them lay?<br> Was not a look enough for them, a word<br> Low murmured, midst the hum of men scarce heard?<br> What have I left undone that they have done?<br> What askest thou of me, O heart of stone?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choked by her passion here awhile she stayed,<br> And he from off the bench sprang up dismayed,<br> And turned on her to speak; but she withal<br> Before him on her knees made haste to fall,<br> And cried out loud and shrilly: "Nay, nay, nay&#151;<br> Say not the word thou art about to say;<br> Let me depart, and things be still as now;<br> So that my dreams sweet images may show,<br> As they have done&#151;that waking I may think,<br> 'If he, my love, from looks of love did shrink,<br> That was because I had not prayed him then<br> To be my love alone of living men;<br> Because he did not know that I, a Queen,<br> Who hitherto but loveless life have seen, <A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A><br> Could kneel to him, and pray upon my knees<br> To give me my first pleasure, my first peace'<br> Thou knewest not&#151;nay, nay, thou know&#146;st not now&#151;<br> Thou with the angry eyes and bended brow!&#151;<br> Surely I talk my mother-tongue no more,<br> Therefore thou knowest not that I implore<br> Thy pity, that I give myself to thee,<br> Thy love, thy slave, thy castaway to be-<br> Hear&#146;st thou? thy castaway! when in a while<br> Thou growest weary of my loving smile!<br> Oh, take me, madman! In a year or twain<br> I will not thwart thee if thou lov&#146;st again,<br> Nor eye thee sourly when thou growest cold;<br> &#151;Or art thou not the man that men call bold,<br> And fear&#146;st thou? Then what better time than this<br> For we twain to begin our life of bliss?<br> Thy keel awaits thee, and to thee alone,<br> Not to the wretched dastard on the throne,<br> Thy men will hearken&#151;Nay, thou shalt not speak,<br> My feeble reed of hope thou shalt not break!&#151;<br> Let me be gone, thou knowest not of love,<br> Thou semblance of a man that nought can move!<br> It O wise, wise man, I give thee good farewell:<br> Gather fresh wisdom, thinking of my hell."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sprang up to her feet and turned away<br> Trembling, and no word to her could he say<br> For grief and pity; and the Queen did go<br> A little way with doubtful steps and slow, <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A><br> Then turned about, and once again did stand<br> Before his troubled face, hand laid in hand,<br> And sobbing now as if her heart would break;<br> But when from his grieved soul he fain would speak,<br> Again from midst her tears she cried, "No, no&#151;<br> Do I not know what thou wouldst bid me do?<br> And yet forgive me!&#151;thou art wise and good.<br> Surely some evil thing has turned my blood,<br> That even now I wished that thing to slay<br> That I of all things only till this day<br> Have loved. Ah, surely thou wilt not be slain!<br> Come back, and I will tell thee once again<br> How much I love thee, and will not forget<br> To say such things as might have moved thee yet,<br> Could I have told thee now, couldst thou have seen<br> These lips that love thee as they might have been.<br> &#151;Farewell, I durst not pray thee for one kiss!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer she drew to him as she spake this,<br> Yet, when she ended, turned about again,<br> And still, as hoping all was not in vain,<br> Lingered a little while, and then at last,<br> With raging heart, swiftly therefrom she passed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, she clean vanished now, Bellerophon<br> Went slowly toward the palace, all alone,<br> And pondering on these things: and shamed he felt,<br> E&#146;en as a just man who in sleep has dealt<br> Unjustly; nor had all her prayers and tears <A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A><br> Moved love in him, but rather stirred his fears,<br> For ever was he wise among wise men;<br> And though he doubted not her longing, when<br> She turned and spake soft words, he knew that she<br> So spake midst hope of what things yet might be,<br> And yet had left another kind of word,<br> Whereby a friendless man might well be feared;<br> Lonely he felt thereat, as one accurst,<br> With whom all best things still must turn to worst,<br> And e&#146;en sweet love curdle to bitter hate.<br> Yet was he one not lightly crushed by fate,<br> And when at last he had his helmet on,<br> And heard the folk cry out 'Bellerophon,'<br> As toward the ship he passed, kind the world seemed,<br> Nor love so far away indeed he deemed<br> When he some gentle maiden's kind grey eyes<br> Fixed on his own he did at whiles surprise,<br> Or when his godlike eyes, on some maid turned<br> More fair than most, set fire to thoughts that burned<br> On breast and brow of her. So forth he passed,<br> And reached the border of the sea at last,<br> And there took ship, and hence is gone a space.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the Queen, when she had left that place,<br> About the pleasance paths did she go still,<br> So &#146;wildered in her mind because her will<br> Might not be done, that at the first she knew<br> No more what place she might be passing through<br> Than one who walks in sleep. Yet hope and sham <A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A><br> Twain help, at last unto her spirit came;<br> Yea, her bright gown, soiled with the autumn grass,<br> Told her the tale of what had come to pass,<br> And to her heart came hatred of the spot<br> Where she had kneeled to one who loved her not,<br> And even therewith his image did she see<br> As he had been; then cried she furiously:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, fool! ah, traitor! must I love thee then,<br> When in the world there are so many men<br> My smile would drive to madness?&#151;for I know<br> What things they are that men desire so,<br> And which of all these bear I not with me?<br> Hast thou not heart and eyes to feel and see?<br> Then shalt thou die, then shalt thou die, at least,<br> Nor sit without me at life's glorious feast,<br> While I fall ever unto worse and worse&#151;<br> Ah me! I rave!&#151;what folly now to curse<br> That which I love, because its loveliness<br> Alone has brought me unto this distress!<br> I know not right nor wrong, but yet through all<br> Know that the Gods a just man him would call;<br> Nay, and I knew it, when I saw him first,<br> And in my heart sprang up that glorious thirst&#151;<br> And should he, not being base, yield suddenly,<br> And as the basest man, not loving me,<br> Take all I gave him, and cast all his life<br> Into a tangled and dishonoured strife?<br> Nay, it could never be&#151;but now, indeed,<br> Somewhat with pity of me his heart may bleed, <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A><br> Since he is good; and he shall think of me,<br> And day by day and night by night shall see<br> The image of that woman on her knees,<br> Whom men here liken to the goddesses.<br> And certainly shall he come back again:<br> Nor shall my next speech to him be so vain."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled, and toward the house made swiftly on<br> In triumph, even as though the game were won:<br> For, now his face was gone, she, blind with love,<br> Deemed but his honour she had got to move<br> From its high place, before his heart should fall<br> A prey unto her; e&#146;en as when the wall<br> By many a stroke of stones is battered down,<br> And all may work their will upon the town.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW of Bellerophon must it be said<br> That, what by wisdom, what by hardihead,<br> His task was done, and great praise gained thereby;<br> So he at last, midst shouts and minstrelsy,<br> In the first days of spring, passed up once more<br> Unto the palace from the thronging shore.<br> Him Pr&#156;tus met half-way, and, in the face<br> Of all the people, in a straight embrace<br> Held him awhile, and called him his dear son,<br> Praising the Gods for all that he had done;<br> Then hand in hand did they go up the street, <A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A><br> And on their heads folk cast the spring-flowers sweet,<br> And bands of maids met them with joyous song<br> And gracious pageants as they went along:<br> And all this for the brave Corinthian's sake&#151;<br> Such joy did his return in all hearts make.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though the man, once from his home driven forth,<br> Was so much loved and held of so much worth,<br> And though he throve thereby, and seemed to be<br> Scarcely a man but some divinity<br> To people's eyes, yet in his soul no less<br> There lingered still a little heaviness,<br> And therefrom hardly could he cast away<br> The memory of that sunny autumn day<br> And of the fear it brought; and one more fear<br> He had besides, and as they drew anear<br> The palace, therewith somewhat faltering,<br> He needs must turn a while, and of the King<br> Ask how the Lycian fared: the King laughed low,<br> And said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, surely she is well enow,<br> As her wont is to be, for, sooth to say,<br> She for herself is ever wont to pray,<br> And heedeth nothing other grief and wrong:<br> And be thou sure, my son, that such live long<br> And lead sweet lives; but those who ever think<br> How he and she may fare, and still must shrink<br> From sweeping any foe from out the way, <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A><br> These&#151;living other people's lives, I say,<br> Besides their own, and most of them forlorn&#151;<br> May hap to find their lives of comfort shorn<br> And short enow&#151;let pass, for as to me,<br> I weep for others&#146; troubles certainly,<br> But for mine own would weep a little more,<br> And so I jog on somehow to the shore<br> Whence I shall not return&#151;Thou laughest&#151;well,<br> I deem I was not made for heaven or hell,<br> But simply for the earth; but thou, O son,<br> I deem of heaven, and all hearts hast thou won&#151;<br> Yea, and this morn the Queen is merrier,<br> Because she knoweth that thou art anear."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince smiled at his words and gladder felt,<br> Yet somewhat of his old fear by him dwelt<br> And shamed him midst his honour. But withal,<br> With shouts and music, entered they the hall,<br> And there great feast was made; but ere the night<br> Had &#146;gun to put an end to men's delight,<br> A maid came up the hall with hurrying feet,<br> And there in lowly wise the King did greet,<br> And bid him know that Sthenob&#156;a had will<br> The joyance of that high-tide to fulfil,<br> And Prince Bellerophon to welcome home;<br> And even as she spoke the Queen was come<br> Unto the door, and through the hall she passed,<br> And round about her ever looks she cast,<br> As though her maidens, howsoever fair <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A><br> And lovesome unto common eyes they were,<br> Were fashioned in another wise than she,<br> They made for time, she for eternity;<br> So &#146;twixt the awed and wondering folk she moved,<br> Hapless and proud, glorious and unbeloved,<br> And hating all folk but her love alone:<br> And he a shadow seemed, one moment shown<br> Unto her longing eyes, then snatched away<br> Ere yet her heart could win one glorious day.<br> Cruel and happy was she deemed of men&#151;<br> Cruel she was, but though tormented then<br> By love, still happier than she ere had been.<br> Now when she saw the Prince, with such-like mien<br> She greeted him but as a Queen might greet<br> Her husband's friend fresh from a glorious feat;<br> Frank-seeming were her words, and in her face<br> No sign of all that storm the Prince could trace<br> That had swept over her&#151;and yet therefore<br> Amidst his joy he did but fear her more.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So time slipped by, and still was she the same,<br> Till he &#146;gan deem she had forgot the shame<br> Of having shameful gifts cast back to her,<br> That scorned love was a burden light to bear.<br> Yea, and the moody ways that once she had<br> Seemed changing into life all frank and glad;<br> She saw him oft now, and alone at whiles;<br> But still, despite her kind words and her smiles,<br> No word of love fell from her any more. <A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the lush green spring was now passed o&#146;er,<br> And the green lily-buds were growing white,<br> A feast they held for pastime and delight<br> Within the odorous pleasance on a tide,<br> And down the hours the feast in joy did glide.<br> Venus they worshipped there, her image shone<br> Above the folk from thoughts of hard life won;<br> About her went the girls in ordered bands,<br> And scattered flowers from out their slender hands,<br> And with their eager voices, sweet but shrill,<br> Betwixt the o&#146;erladen trees the air did fill;<br> Or, careless what their dainty limbs might meet,<br> Ungirded and unshod, with hurrying feet,<br> Mocked cold Diana's race betwixt the trees,<br> Where the long grass and sorrel kissed their knees,<br> About the borders of the neighbouring field;<br> Or in the garden were content to yield<br> Unto the sun, and by the fountain-side,<br> Panting, love's growing languor would abide.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the Goddess in the warm wind breathed,<br> Surely her fingers wrought the flowers that wreathed<br> The painted trellises&#151;some added grace<br> Her spirit gave to every limb and face,<br> Some added scent to raiment long laid hid<br> Beneath the stained chest's carven cypress lid;<br> Fairer the girdle round the warm side clung,<br> Fairer the dainty folds beneath it hung,<br> Fairer the gold upon the bosom lay<br> Than was their wont ere that bewildering day, <A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A><br> When fear and shame, twin rulers of the earth,<br> Sat hoodwinked in the maze of short-lived mirth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Songs cleft the air, and little words therein<br> Were clean changed now, and told of honeyed sin,<br> And passionate words seemed fire, and words, that had.<br> Grave meaning once, were changed, and only bade<br> The listeners&#146; hearts to thoughts they could not name.<br> Shame changed to strong desire, desire seemed shame,<br> And trembled; and such words the lover heard<br> As in the middle of the night afeard<br> He once was wont alone to whisper low<br> Unto himself, for fear the day should know<br> What his love really was; the longing eyes<br> That unabashed were wont to make arise<br> The blush of shame to bosom and grave brow,<br> Beholding all their fill, were downcast now;<br> The eager heart shrank back, the cold was moved,<br> Wooed was the wooer, the lover was beloved.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet indeed from wise Bellerophon<br> Right little by Queen Venus&#146; wiles was won:<br> Joyous he was, but nowise would forget<br> That long and changing might his life be yet,<br> Nor deemed he had to do with such things now,<br> So let all pass, e&#146;en as a painted show.<br> But the Queen hoped belike, and many a prayer<br> That morn had made to Venus&#146; image fair;<br> And as the day wore, hushed she grew at whiles<br> And pale; and sick and scornful were her smiles, <A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A><br> Nor knew her heart what words her lips might say.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through its changing hours went by the day,<br> And when at last they sang the sun a-down,<br> And, singing, watched the moon rise, and the town<br> Was babbling through the clear eve, saddened now,<br> And faint and weary went, with footsteps slow,<br> The lover and beloved, to e&#146;en such rest<br> As they might win; and soon the daisies, pressed<br> By oft-kissed dainty feet and panting side,<br> Now with the dew were growing satisfied,<br> And sick blind passion now no more might spoil<br> The place made beautiful by patient toil<br> Of many a man. And now Bellerophon<br> Slept light and sweetly as the night wore on,<br> Nor dreamed about the morrow; but the Queen<br> Rose from her bed, and, like a sin unseen,<br> Stole from the house, and, barefoot as she was,<br> Through the dark belt of whispering trees did pass<br> That girt the fair feast's pleasant place around:<br> And when she came unto that spot of ground<br> Whereas she deemed Bellerophon had lain,<br> Then low adown she lay, and as for pain<br> She moaned, and on the dew she laid her cheek,<br> Then raised her head, and cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now may I speak,<br> Now may I speak, since none can hear me now<br> But thou, O Love, thou of the bitter bow.<br> Didst thou not see, O Cither&aelig;a's son, <A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A><br> Thine image, that men call Bellerophon?<br> Thine image, with the heart of stone, the eyes<br> Of fire, those forgers of all miseries?<br> And shall I bear thy burden all alone,<br> In silent places making my low moan?<br> Nay, but once more I try it&#151;help thou me,<br> Or on the earth a strange deed shalt thou see.<br> Lo, now! thou knowest what my will has been:<br> Day after day his fair face have I seen<br> And made no sign&#151;thus had I won him soon.<br> But thou, the dreadful sun, the cruel moon,<br> The scents, the flowers, the half-veiled nakedness<br> Of wanton girls, my heart did so oppress,<br> That now the chain is broken&#151;Didst thou see<br> How when he turned his cruel face on me<br> He laughed?&#151;he laughed, nor would behold my heart&#151;<br> He laughed, to think at last he had a part<br> In joyous life without me: here, e&#146;en here,<br> He drank, rejoicing much, still drawing near,<br> As the fool thought, to riches and renown.<br> And such an one wilt thou not cast adown<br> When thou rememberest how he came to me<br> With wan worn cheek?&#151;Ah, sweet he was to see!<br> I loved him then&#151;how can I love him now,<br> So changed, so changed?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But thou&#151;what doest thou?<br> Hast thou forgotten how thy temples stand,<br> Made rich with gifts, in many a luckless land? <A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A><br> Hast thou forgotten what strange rites are done<br> To gain thy goodwill underneath the sun?<br> Thou art asleep, then!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceased, and leaned back, kneeling, and all spent<br> And panting, with her trembling fingers rent<br> The linen from her breast, and, with shut eyes,<br> Waited awhile as for some great surprise,<br> But yet heard nothing stranger or more loud<br> Than the leaves&#146; rustle; a long bank of cloud<br> Lay in the south, low down, and scarcely seen<br> &#145;Gainst the grey sky, and when at last the Queen<br> Opened her eyes, she started eagerly, <A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A><br> Although the strangest thing her eyes could see<br> Was but the summer lightning playing there;<br> Then she put back her over-hanging hair,<br> And in a hard and grating voice she said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Sthenob&#156;a, art thou then afraid<br> Of a god's presence?&#151;did a god e&#146;er come<br> To help a good and just man when his home<br> Was turned to hell?

What cruellest man of men<br> Had made me this, and left me even thus?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto the sky wild eyes and piteous<br> She turned, and gat unto her feet once more,<br> And, led by use, came back unto the door<br> Whence she went out, and with no stealthy tread,<br> Careless of all things, gat her to her bed,<br> And there at last, in grief and care's despite,<br> Slept till the world had long forgotten night.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellerophon arose the morrow morn<br> Unlike the man that once had been forlorn;<br> Bright-eyed and merry was he, and such fear<br> As yet clung round him did but make joy dear, <A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A><br> And more in hope he was, and knew not why,<br> Than any day that yet had passed him by.<br> Now ere the freshness of the morn had died,<br> Restless with happiness, he thought to ride<br> Unto a ship, that in a little bay<br> Anigh to Phlius, bound for outlands, lay,<br> Unto whose Phrygian master had the King<br> Given commands to buy him many a thing,<br> And soon he sailed, since fair was grown the wind.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Bellerophon in such a mind<br> Passed slow along the marble cloister-wall,<br> He heard a voice his name behind him call,<br> And turning, saw the Thracian maiden fair,<br> Leucippe, coming swiftly toward him there,<br> Who when she reached him stayed, and drawing breath<br> As one who rests, said, "Sir, my mistress saith<br> That she awhile is fain to speak with thee<br> Before thou goest down unto the sea;<br> And in her bower for thee doth she abide."<br> He gave her some light word, and side by side<br> The twain passed toward the bower, he all the while<br> Noting the Thracian with a well-pleased smile;<br> For his fear slept, or he felt strong enow<br> Things good and ill unto his will to bow.<br> Yet was the gentle Thracian pale that day,<br> And still she seemed as she some word would say<br> Unto him, that her lips durst not to frame;<br> And when unto the Queen's bower-door they came, <A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A><br> And he passed there, and it was shut on him,<br> She lingered still, and through her body slim<br> A tremor ran, her pale face waxed all red,<br> And her lips moved as though some word they said<br> She durst not utter loud; then she looked down<br> Upon her bare feet and her slave's wool gown,<br> And to her daily task straight took her way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on his throne King Pr&#156;tus judged that day,<br> And heard things dull, things strange, but when at last<br> The summer noon now by an hour had passed,<br> He went to meat, and thought to see thereat<br> Bellerophon's frank face, who ever sat<br> At his right hand; but empty was his place.<br> And when the King, who fain had seen his face,<br> Asked whither he was gone, a certain man<br> Said: "King, I saw the brave Corinthian,<br> Two hours agone, pass through the outer door,<br> And in his face there seemed a trouble sore,<br> So that I needs must ask him what was wrong;<br> But staring at me as he went along,<br> Silent he passed, as if he heard me not;<br> Afoot he was, nor weapon had he got."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King's face clouded, but the meal being done<br> In his fair chariot did he get him gone<br> Unto the haven, where the Phrygian ship<br> Was waiting his last word her ropes to slip;<br> Restless he was, and wished that night were come.<br> But ere he left the fair porch of his home, <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A><br> Unto the Queen a messenger he sent,<br> And bade her know whereunto now he went,<br> And prayed her go with him; but presently<br> Back came the messenger, and said that she<br> Was ill at ease and in her bower would bide,<br> For scarcely she upon that day might ride.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at that word of hers the Argive King<br> Went on his way, but somewhat muttering,<br> For heavy thoughts were gathering round his heart;<br> But when he came where, ready to depart,<br> The ship lay, with the bright-eyed master there<br> Some talk he had, who said the wind was fair<br> And all things ready; then the King said, "Friend,<br> To-morrow's noon I deem will make an end<br> Of this thy lingering; I will send to thee<br> A messenger to tell the certainty<br> Of my last wishes, who shall bring thee gold<br> And this same ring that now thou dost behold<br> Upon my finger, for a token sure<br> Farewell, and may thy good days long endure."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned, but backward sent his eyes awhile,<br> Sighing, though on his lips there was a smile;<br> The half-raised sail that clung unto the mast,<br> The tinkling ripple &#146;gainst the black side cast,<br> The thin blue smoke that from the poop arose,<br> The northland dog that midst of ropes did doze,<br> The barefoot shipmen's eyes upon him bent,<br> Curious and half-defiant, as they went <A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A><br> About their work&#151;all these things raised in him<br> Desire for roving&#151;stirred up thoughts that, dim<br> At this time, clear at that, still oft he had,<br> That there his life was not so overglad;<br> And as toward Argos now he rode along<br> By the grey sea, the shipmen's broken song<br> Smote on his ear and with the low surf's fall<br> Mingled, and seemed to him perchance to call<br> To freedom and a life not lived in vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so his palace did he gain,<br> And the dull listless day slipped into night,<br> And smothering troublous thoughts e&#146;en as he might,<br> Did he betake himself to bed, and there<br> Lay half-asleep beneath the tester fair,<br> Waiting until the low-voiced flutes gave sign<br> That thither drew the Lycian's feet divine&#151;<br> For so the wont was, that she still was led<br> Unto her chamber as a bride new-wed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that sweet sound nought heard the King at all,<br> But straightway into a short sleep did fall,<br> Then woke as one who knoweth certainly<br> That all the hours he now shall hear pass by,<br> Nor sleep until the sun is up again.<br> So, waking, did he hear a cry of pain<br> Within the chamber, and thereat adrad<br> He turned him round, and saw the Queen, so clad<br> That on her was her raiment richly wrought, <A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A><br> Yet in such case as though hard fate had brought<br> Some bane of Kings into the royal place,<br> And with that far-removed and dainty grace<br> The rough hands of some outland foe had dealt;<br> For dragged athwart her was the jewelled belt,<br> Rent and disordered the Ph&#156;nician gown,<br> The linen from her shoulders dragged adown,<br> Her arms and glorious bosom made half-bare,<br> And furthermore such shameful signs were there,<br> As though not long past hands had there been laid<br> Heavier than touches of the tiring-maid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So swiftly through the place from end to end<br> She paced, but yet stopped now and then to send<br> Low bitter moans forth on the scented air;<br> And through the King's heart shot a bitter fear,<br> Nor could he move&#151;he had believed her cold,<br> And wise to draw herself from pleasure's hold<br> When it began to sting the heart&#151;but now<br> What shameful thing would these last minutes show?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as she went a look askance she cast<br> Upon the King, and turning at the last,<br> With strange eyes drew anigh the royal bed,<br> And, with clasped hands, before him stood, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou wakest, then? thou wonderest at this sight?<br> I have a tale to tell to thee this night<br> I cannot utter, unless words are taught<br> Unto my lips to draw forth all my thought&#151; <A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A><br> Thou wonderest at my words? Then ask, then ask!<br> The sooner will be done my heavy task."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upright in bed the King sat, pale with doubt<br> And gathering fear; his right hand he stretched out<br> To take the Queen's hand, but aback she drew,<br> Shuddering; and half he deemed the truth he knew,<br> As o&#146;er her pale face and her bosom came<br> Beneath his gaze a flush as if of shame:<br> "Wilt thou not speak, and make an end?" she cried.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he spake slowly, "Why dost thou abide<br> Without my bed to-night? why dost thou groan,<br> Whom I ere now no love-sick girl have known?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She covered up her face at that last word;<br> The thick folds of her linen gown were stirred<br> As her limbs writhed beneath them&#151;nought she said,<br> As though the word was not remembered<br> She had to say; and, loth the worst to hear,<br> The King awhile was tongue-tied by his fear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last the words came: "Thou bad&#146;st ask of thee<br> Why thou to-night my playmate wouldst not be&#151;<br> What hast thou done? Speak quickly of the thing!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She drew her hands away, and cried, "O King,<br> Art thou awake yet, that this shameful guise<br> Seems nothing strange unto thy drowsy eyes,<br> Wilt thou not ask why this and this is torn? <A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A><br> Why this is bruised? Lo, since the long-passed morn<br> Thus have I sat, that thou e&#146;en this might see,<br> And ask what madness there has been in me.<br> Thus have I sat, and cursed the God who made<br> The day so long, the night so long delayed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask! thou art happy that the Lycian sod<br> Unwearied oft my virgin feet have trod<br> From dawn to dusk; that in the Lycian wood<br> Before wild things untrembling I have stood;<br> That this right arm so oft the javelin threw&#151;<br> These fingers rather the grey bowstring knew<br> Than the gold needle: even so, indeed,<br> Of more than woman's strength had I had need<br> If with a real man I had striven to-day;<br> But he who would have shamed thee went his way<br> Like a scourged woman&#151;thou wilt spare him, then&#151;<br> Lay down thy sword!&#151;that is for manly men."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For while she spake, and in her eyes did burn<br> The fires of hate, the King's face had waxed stern,<br> And ere her bitter speech was fully o&#146;er,<br> He had arisen, and from off the floor<br> Had gat his proven sword into his hand,<br> And eager by the trembling Queen did stand,<br> And cried, "Nay, hold! for surely I know well<br> What tale it is thy lips to-night would tell;<br> Therefore my sword befits me, the tried friend<br> That many a troublous thing has brought to end.<br> Yet fear not, for another friend have I <A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A><br> To help me deal with this new villany,<br> Even the godlike man Bellerophon;<br> So with one word thy heavy task is done.<br> &#151;O Sthenob&#156;a, speak the name of him<br> Who wrought this deed, then let that name wax dim<br> Within thy mind till it is dead and past;<br> For, certes, yesterday he saw the last<br> Of setting suns his doomed eyes shall behold."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale as a corpse she waxed, and stony cold<br> Amidst these words; silent awhile she was<br> After the last word from the King did pass,<br> But in a low voice at the last she said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, for this deed of his must he be dead?<br> And must he be at peace, because he strove<br> To take from me honour, and peace, and love?<br> Must a great King do thus? or hast thou not<br> Some lightless place in mighty Argos got<br> Where nought can hap to break the memory<br> Of what he hoped in other days might be;<br> For great he has been, and of noble birth<br> As any man who dwelleth on the earth.<br> &#151;Thou hast forgotten that the dead shall rest,<br> Whate&#146;er they wrought on earth of worst or best."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the King gazed upon her gloomily,<br> And said, "Nay, nay;&#151;the man shall surely die&#151;<br> His hope die with him, is it not enow?<br> But no such mind I bear in me as thou, <A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A><br> Who speakest not as a great Queen should speak,<br> But rather as a girl made mad and weak<br> By hope delayed and love cast back again,<br> Who knoweth not her words are words and vain.<br> Content thee, thou art loved and honoured still&#151;<br> Speak forth the name of him who wrought the ill,<br> For I am fain to meet Bellerophon,<br> So that we twain may do what must be done."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake, but mid the tumult of her mind<br> She heard him not, and deaf she was and blind<br> To all without, nor knew she if her feet<br> The marble cold or red-hot iron did meet.<br> She moved not and she felt not, but a sound<br> Came from her lips, and smote the air around<br> With slow hard words:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! thou hast named him then<br> Twice in this hour alone of earthly men;<br> That same Bellerophon, that all folk love,<br> In manly wise this morn against me strove!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, how the world was changed, as she went by<br> The King, bewildered with new misery&#151;<br> Ah, and how little time it was agone<br> When all that deed of hers was not yet done,<br> When yet she might have died for him, and made<br> A little love her lonely tomb to shade<br> Spring up within his heart&#151;when hope there was<br> Of many a thing that yet might come to pass&#151;<br> And now, and now&#151;those spoken words must be <A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A><br> A part of her, an unwrought misery<br> That would not let her rest till all was o&#146;er,&#151;<br> Nay, nay, no rest upon the shadowy shore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly she left the chamber, none the less<br> With measured steps her feet the floor did press<br> As a Queen's should, nor fainted she at all,<br> But straight unto the door &#146;twixt wall and wall<br> She went, and still perchance had forced a smile<br> Had she met any one; and all the while<br> Set in such torment as men cannot name,<br> If she did think, wondered that still the same<br> Were all things round her as they had been erst&#151;<br> That the house fell not&#151;that the feet accurst<br> To carry her yet left no sign in blood<br> Of where the wretchedest on earth had stood&#151;<br> That round about her still her raiment clung&#151;<br> That no great sudden pain her body stung,<br> No inward flame her false white limbs would burn,<br> Or into horror all her beauty turn&#151;<br> That still the gentle sounds of night were there<br> As she had known them: the light summer air<br> Within the thick-leaved trees, as she passed by<br> Some open window, and the nightbird's cry<br> From far; the gnat's thin pipe about her head,<br> The wheeling moth delaying to be dead<br> Within the taper's flame&#151;yea, certainly<br> Shall things about her as they have been be,<br> And even that a torment now has grown. <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet must she reap the grain that she has sown;<br> No thought of turning back was in her heart,<br> No more in those past days can she have part;<br> Nay, when her glimmering bower she came unto,<br> She muttered through the dusk, "As I would do<br> So have I done&#151;so would I do again."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, thus in unimaginable pain<br> Leave we her now, and to the King turn back;<br> Who stood there overwhelmed by sudden lack<br> Of what he leaned on&#151;with his life left bare<br> Of a great pleasure that was growing there.<br> A storm of rage swept through his heart, to think<br> That he of such a cup as this must drink;<br> For if he doubted aught, this was his doubt,<br> That all the tale was not told fully out&#151;<br> That for Bellerophon the Queen's great scorn<br> And loathing was a thing but newly born&#151;<br> That bitter hate was but a lover's hate,<br> Which even yet beneath the hand of fate<br> Might turn to hottest love. He groaned thereat,<br> And staggering back, upon the bed he sat;<br> His bright sword from his hand had fallen down<br> When that last dreadful word at him was thrown,<br> And now, with head sunk &#146;twixt his hands, he sought<br> Some outlet from the weary girth of thought<br> That hemmed him in.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And must I slay him then,<br> Him whom I loved above all earthly men? <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A><br> Behold, if now I slept here, and next morn,<br> Ere the day's memory should be fully born<br> From out of sleep, men came and said to me,<br> 'Sire, the Corinthian draweth nigh to thee,'<br> My first thought would be joy that he had come.<br> And yet I am a King, nor shall my home<br> Become a brothel before all men's eyes.<br> He who drinks deadly poison surely dies,<br> And he hath drunk, and must abide the end.<br> Yet hath the image of him been my friend&#151;<br> What shall I do? Not lightly can I bear<br> The voice of men about these things to hear;<br> 'He trusted him, he thought himself right wise<br> To look into men's souls through lips and eyes&#151;<br> &#151;Behold the end!&#151;'&nbsp;Yea, and most certainly<br> I will not bear once more his face to see;<br> Nor in the land where he was purified<br> Shall grass or marble by his blood be dyed,<br> Since he must go&#151;green grew a bough of spring<br> Amidst the barren death of many a thing;<br> Not barren it, since poison fruits it bore&#151;<br> Behold now, I, who loved my life of yore,<br> Begin to weary that I e&#146;er was born;<br> But let it pass&#151;rather let good men mourn;<br> Great men, the earth's salt, wear their lives away<br> In weeping for the ne&#146;er-returning day:<br> For surely all is good enough for me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet alas! what truth there seemed in thee&#151;<br> &#151;What can I do? Might he not die in war? <A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A><br> Nay, but at peace through him my borders are.<br> He shall not die here&#151;the deep sea were good<br> To hide the story of his untamed blood&#151;<br> Or, further&#151;O thou fool, that so must make<br> My life so dull, e&#146;en for a woman's sake!<br> There in that land, then, shall thy bones have rest<br> Beneath the sod her worshipped feet have pressed.<br> In Lycia shalt thou die; her father's hand<br> Shall draw the sword, or his lips give command<br> To make an end of thee&#151;So shall it be,<br> And that swift Phrygian ready now for sea<br> Shall bear thee hence&#151;Would I had known thee not;<br> A new pain hast thou been&#151;a heavy lot<br> My life in early morn to me shall seem,<br> When I have dreamed that all was but a dream,<br> And waked to truth again and lonely life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let be; now must I forge the hidden knife<br> Against thee, and I would the thing were done.<br> Thou mayst not die so; thou art such an one<br> As the Gods love, whatever thou mayst do,<br> Perchance they pay small heed to false or true<br> In such as we are. But the lamps burn low,<br> The night wears, grey the eastern sky doth grow;<br> I must forget thee; fellow, fare thee well,<br> Who might have turned my feet from lonely hell!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, slowly, as a man who needs<br> Must do a deed that woe and evil breeds,<br> He rose, and took his writing tools to him. <A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A><br> And ere the day had made the tapers dim,<br> Two letters with his own hand had he made,<br> And open was the first one, and it said<br> 'These words:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Unto the wise Bellerophon&#151;<br> To Lycia the Gods call thee, O my son;<br> So when thou hast this letter in thine hand,<br> Abide no longer in the Argive land<br> Than if thou fleddest some avenging man,<br> But make good speed to that swift Phrygian<br> Who for the southlands saileth this same day.<br> Take thou this gold for furtherance and stay,<br> And this for his reward who rules the heel,<br> And for a token show him this my seal.<br> This casket to the Lycian king bear forth,<br> That hath in it a thing of greatest worth;<br> And let no hand be laid on it but thine<br> Till in Jobates&#146; hands its gold doth shine.<br> Then bid him mind how that he had of me<br> When last I saw his face the fellow key<br> To that which in mine hands doth open it</i>&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile the King had stayed when this was writ,<br> And on the gathering greyness of the morn<br> Long fixed his eyes, unseeing and forlorn,<br> Then o&#146;er the tablets moved his hand again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mayst thou do well among these outland men.<br> Perchance my face thou never more shalt see</i>, <A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A><br> <i>Perchance but little more remains to thee<br> Of thy loved life&#151;thou wert not one to cry<br> Curses on all because life passeth by.<br> If woe befalls thee there, think none the less<br> That I erewhile have wrought thee happiness;<br> Farewell! and ask thou not to see me first:<br> Life worsens here, and ere it reach the worst,<br> Unto the Jove that may be would I speak<br> To help my people, wandering blind and weak</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another letter by the King's side lay,<br> But closed and sealed; so in the twilight grey<br> Now did he rise, and summoned presently<br> A slumbering chamberlain that was thereby,<br> And bade him toward the treasury lead, and take<br> Two leathern bags for that same errand's sake;<br> So forth the twain went to that golden place;<br> But when they were therein, a mournful face<br> Still the King seemed to see, e&#146;en as it was<br> When he from room to room with him did pass<br> Who now had wronged him; then the gold waxed dim,<br> For bitter pain his vexed heart wrought for him,<br> And filled with unused tears his hard wise eyes.<br> But choking back the thronging memories,<br> He laid the letter that he erst did hold<br> Within a casket wrought of steel and gold,<br> Which straight he locked; then bade his fellow fill<br> The bags he bore from a great golden hill,<br> Then to his room, made cold with morn, returned; <A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A><br> And since for change and some swift deed he yearned,<br> He bade his chamberlain bring hunter's weed,<br> And saddle him straightway his fleetest steed:<br> "And see," said he, "before the Prince arise<br> Ye show this letter to his waking eyes,<br> And give into his hands these things ye see;<br> And make good speed, the time grows short for me."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, and there grew on him a thought<br> That thither might Bellerophon be brought<br> Ere he could get him gone; and therewithal<br> At last the low sun topped the garden-wall,<br> And o&#146;er the dewy turf long shadows threw;<br> Then, being new clad, the porch he hurried to,<br> And paced betwixt its pillars feverishly,<br> Until he heard the horse-boys&#146; cheery cry<br> And the sharp clatter of the well-shod feet;<br> Then he ran out, the joyous steed to meet,<br> And mounted, and rode forth, he scarce knew where,<br> Until the town was passed, and &#146;twixt the fair<br> Green corn-fields of the June-tide he drew rein,<br> To ponder on his life, so spoiled and vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Bellerophon awoke that morn,<br> Weary he felt, as though he long had borne<br> Some heavy load, and his perplexed heart<br> Must chide the life wherein he had a part.<br> But ere he gat him down to meet the day<br> With its new troubles, &#146;thwart his weary way<br> Was come that chamberlain, who bade him read, <A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A><br> And say what other thing he yet might need.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read, and knit his anxious brows in thought,<br> For in his mind great doubt that letter brought<br> If yet he were in friendship with the King;<br> And therewith came a dark imagining<br> Of unseen dangers, and great anger grew<br> Within his soul, as if the worst were true<br> Of all he thought might be; and in his mind<br> It was, that going, he might leave behind<br> A bitter word to pay for broken troth:<br> And still the King's man saw that he was wroth,<br> And watched him curiously, till he had read<br> The letter thrice, but nought to him he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he spake, "Sir, even as the King<br> Now bids me, will I make no tarrying;<br> And as I carne to Argos, even so,<br> Unfriended, bearing nothing, will I go;<br> And few farewells are best to-day, I deem,<br> For like a banished man I would not seem<br> Among these folk that love me: get we gone,<br> And tell the King his full will shall be done."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So forth they ride, and ever as the way<br> Lengthened behind them, and the summer day<br> Grew hotter on the lovely teeming earth,<br> The fresh soft air and sounds and sights of mirth<br> Wrought on Bellerophon, until it seemed<br> That things might not be e&#146;en as he had deemed<br> At first. "What thoughts are mine; have I not had <A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A><br> Gifts from his hands&#151;hath he not made me glad<br> When I was sorry? Therefore will I take<br> What chance there lies herein for honour's sake.<br> Nay, more, and may not friendship lie herein?&#151;<br> May he not drive me forth from shame and sin<br> And evil fate? Well, howsoe&#146;er it is,<br> But little evil do I see in this:<br> Yea, I may see his face again once more,<br> And crowned with honour come back to this shore,<br> For now I fear nought&#151;if he thinks to see<br> Some evil thing that nowise is in me,<br> Another day the truth of all will show.<br> Let pass, again from out the place I go<br> Wherein the sport of fortune I have tried;<br> If it has failed me, yet the world is wide<br> And I am young. Now go I forth alone<br> To do what in my life must needs be done,<br> And in my own hands lies my fate, I think,<br> And I shall mix the cup that I must drink:<br> So be it; thus the world is merrier,<br> And I shall be a better man than here."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid these thoughts, unto the ship he came,<br> And higher yet sprang up the new-stirred flame<br> Of great desires when first he saw the sea<br> Leap up against her black sides lovingly,<br> And heard the sails flap, and the voice of folk,<br> Who at the sight of him in shouts outbroke,<br> Since they withal were eager to be gone. <A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A><br> And now were all things done that should be done;<br> The money rendered up, the King's seal shown,<br> Unto the master all his will made known,<br> And on the deck stood the Corinthian.<br> As up the mast clattering the great rings ran,<br> And back the hawser to the ship was cast,<br> The helmsman took the tiller, and at last<br> The head swung round, trimly the great sail drew,<br> The broad bows pierced the land of fishes through,<br> Unheard the red wine fell from out the cup<br> Into the noisy sea; and then rose up<br> The cloud of incense-smoke a little way,<br> But driven from the prow, with the white spray<br> It mingled, and a little dimmed the crowd<br> Of white-head braves; then rose the sea-song loud,<br> While on the stern still stood Bellerophon,<br> Bidding farewell to what of life was gone,<br> Pensive, but smiling somewhat to behold<br> The lengthening wake, and field, and hill, and wold,<br> And white-walled Argos growing small astern,<br> That he the pleasure of the gods might learn. <A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT when the King's man, with a doubtful smile,<br> Had watched the parting sails a little while,<br> He turned about, revolving many things<br> Within his mind, of the weak hearts of kings,<br> Because the Prince's glory seemed grown dim,<br> And nowise grand this parting seemed to him;<br> "For day-long leave-taking there should have been,"<br> He grumbled, "and fair tables well beseen<br> Should have been spread the gilded ship anigh,<br> And many a perfect beast been slain thereby<br> Unto the gods&#151;Had this Bellerophon<br> Too great fame for the King of Argos won?<br> I will be lowly, for no little bliss<br> I have in Argos, a good place it is&#151;<br> Or else what thing has happed?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe&#146;er it was,<br> Slowly again to Argos did he pass,<br> And here and there he spake upon that day<br> Of how Bellerophon had gone away,<br> Perchance as one who would no more return;<br> And sore hearts were there, who thereat must yearn<br> To see the face that let a weak hope live;<br> And folk still doomed with many things to strive,<br> Who found him helpful&#151;few indeed were there<br> Who did not pray that well he still might fare<br> Whereso he was, and few forgot him quite<br> For many a day and many a changing night. <A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sthenob&#156;a, when she knew that morn<br> That she was not alone of love forlorn,<br> But of the thing too that fed love in her,<br> Yet coldly at the first her lot did bear<br> In outward seeming: in no other wise<br> She sat among her maids than when his eyes<br> Had first met hers. "No babble shall there be<br> In this fool's land concerning him and me.<br> Gone is he,&#151;let him die and be forgot:<br> Cold is my heart that yesterday was hot,<br> Quenched is the fervent flame of yesterday;<br> Past is the time when I had cast away,<br> If he had bidden me, name, and fame, and all:<br> Now in this dulls world e&#146;en let things befall<br> As they are fated; I am stirred no more<br> By any hap&#151;hope, hate, and love are o&#146;er."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake she in the morn, when, still a Queen,<br> She sat among her folk as she had been,<br> Dreaded, unloved; yet as the day wore on<br> She felt as though it never would be done.<br> And now she took to wandering restlessly,<br> And set her face to go unto the sea,<br> But soon turned back, and through the palace ranged,<br> And thought she thought not of him, and yet changed<br> Her face began to grow; and if she spoke,<br> As one untroubled, aught unto her folk,<br> Her speech grew wild and broken ere its end;<br> And as about the place she still did wend,<br> More than its wonted chill her presence threw <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A><br> On those who of her coming footsteps knew&#151;<br> Yea, as she passed by some, she even thought<br> A look like pity to their eyes was brought,<br> And then, amidst her craving agony,<br> Must she grow red with wrath that such could be.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now came the night, and she must cast aside<br> All semblance of her coldness and her pride,<br> And find the weary night was longer yet<br> Than was the day, and harder to forget<br> The thoughts that came therewith. How can I tell<br> In any words the torment of that hell,<br> That she for her own soul had fashioned so,<br> That from it never any path did go<br> To lands of rest, no window was therein,<br> Through which there shone a hope of happier sin;<br> But close the fiery walls about her glared,<br> And on one dreadful picture still she stared,<br> Intent on that desire, that dreadful love,<br> The dullness of her savage heart that clove<br> With wasting fire, a bane to her, and all<br> Who in the net of her vain life might fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day wore, and thereto followed night,<br> And changed through dark and dusk and dawn to light;<br> And when at last high-risen was the sun,<br> The women came to do what should be done<br> In the Queen's chamber: water for the bath<br> They brought, and dainties such as Venus hath; <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A><br> Gold combs, embroidered cloths, pearl-threaded strings,<br> Such unguents as the hidden river brings<br> Through strange-wrought caverns down into a sea<br> Where seldom any keel of man may be;<br> Fine Indian webs, the work of many a year,<br> And incense that the bleeding tree doth bear<br> Lone in the desert;&#151;yea, and fear withal<br> Of what new thing upon that day might fall<br> From her they served, for on the day now dead<br> Wild words, strange threatenings had her writhed lips said.<br> But when within the chamber door they were,<br> A new hope grew within them, a new fear,<br> For empty &#146;neath the golden canopy<br> The bed lay, and when one maid drew anigh,<br> She saw that all untouched the linen was<br> As for that night; so when it came to pass<br> That in no chamber of that house of gold<br> Might any one the Lycian's face behold,<br> Nor any sign of her, then therewithal<br> To others of the household did they call,<br> And asked if they had tidings of the Queen;<br> And when they found that she had not been seen<br> Since at the end of day to bed she passed,<br> Within their troubled minds the thing they cast,<br> And thus remembered that at whiles of late<br> She had been wont the rising sun to wait<br> Within the close below her bower; so then<br> They called together others, maids and men, <A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A><br> And passed with troubled eyes adown the stair;<br> And coming to the postern-door that there<br> Led out into the pleasance, that they found<br> Still open, and thereby upon the ground,<br> And on a jagged bough of creeping vine,<br> Gold threads they saw, and silken broidery fine,<br> That well they knew torn from the Lycian's gown;<br> Therewith with hasty feet were trodden down<br> The beds of summer flowers that lay between<br> The outer wicket of that garden green<br> And the bower-door&#151;feet that had heeded nought<br> By what wild ways they to their end were brought;<br> Then by the gate where the faint sweetbriar-rose<br> Grew thick about the edges of the close,<br> Had one pushed through their boughs in such a way<br> That fragments of a dainty thin array<br> Yet fluttered on the thorns in the light breeze,<br> Nor might they doubt who once had carried these.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the pleasance-gate they had passed through,<br> At first within the lingering strip of dew<br> Beneath the wall, footprints they well could see;<br> But as the shadow failed them presently,<br> And little could the close-cropped summer grass<br> Tell them of feet that might have chanced to pass<br> Thereby before the dawn, their steps they stayed,<br> And this and that thing there betwixt them weighed<br> With many words; then splitting up their band,<br> Some took the way unto the well-tilled land,<br> Some seaward went, and some must turn their feet <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A><br> Unto the wood: yet did not any meet<br> A further sign; and though some turned again<br> To tell the tale at once, yet all in vain<br> Did horsemen scour the country far and wide,<br> And vainly was the sleuth-hounds&#146; mettle tried&#151;<br> &#151;Gone was the Lycian, and in such a guise<br> That silence seemed the best word for the wise.<br> But many a babbling tongue in Argos was,<br> Who for no gold had let such matters pass;<br> And some there were who, mindful of her face<br> As down the street she passed in queenly grace,<br> Said that some god had seen her even as they,<br> And with no will that longer she should stay<br> Midst dying men, had taken her to his home&#151;<br> "And we are left behind," they said; but some,<br> Who had been nigher to her, said that she,<br> Smitten by some benign divinity<br> Who loved the world and lovely Argos well,<br> Had fled with changed heart far from man to dwell&#151;<br> Yea, and might be a goddess even yet.<br> But other folk, well ready to forget<br> Her bitter soul, and well content to bear<br> The changed life that she erst had filled with care,<br> Smiled, and said yea to better and to worse,<br> But inly thought that many a heart-felt curse<br> Her careless ears had heard upon the earth<br> Had not returned to where it had its birth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gods are kind, and hope to men they give <A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A><br> That they their little span on earth may live,<br> Nor yet faint utterly; the Gods are kind,<br> And will not suffer men all things to find<br> They search for, nor the depth of all to know<br> They fain would learn: and it was even so<br> With Sthenob&#156;a; for a fisher old<br> That day a tale unto his carline told,<br> E&#146;en such as this:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I last night had laid<br> The boat up &#146;neath the high cliff, and had made<br> All things about it trim, and left thee here,<br> Even as thou knowest, I set out to bear<br> Those mullets unto Argos. Nought befell<br> At first whereof is any need to tell,<br> But when the night had now grown very old,<br> And, as my wont is, I was waxing bold,<br> And thinking of the bright returning day,<br> That drives the sprites of wood and wave away,<br> As the path leads, I entered the beech-wood<br> Which, close to where the ancient palace stood,<br> Clothes the cliff's edge; I entered warily,<br> Yet thought no evil thing therein to see.<br> Scarce lighter than dark night it was therein,<br> Though swift without the day on night did win.<br> So I went on, I say, and had no fear,<br> So nigh to day; but getting midmost, where<br> Thinner it grows and lighter, toward the sea,<br> I stayed my whistling, for it seemed to me<br> The wind moaned louder than it should have done, <A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A><br> Because of wind without was well-nigh none.<br> When I stood still it ended, and again,<br> E&#146;en as I moved, I seemed to hear it plain.<br> Trembling, I stopped once more, and heard indeed<br> A sound as though one moaned in bitter need,<br> Clearer than was the moaning of the surf,<br> Now muffled by a rising bank of turf<br> On the cliff's edge; fear-stricken, yet in doubt,<br> Through the grey glimmer now I peered about,<br> And turned unto the sea: then my heart sank,<br> For by the tree the nighest to that bank<br> A white thing stood, like, as I now could see,<br> The daughters of us sons of misery,<br> Though such I deemed her not&#151;and yet had I<br> No will or power to turn about and fly;<br> And now it moaned and moaned, and seemed to writhe<br> Against the tree its body long and lithe.<br> Long gazed I, while still colourless and grey,<br> But swift enow, drew on the dawn of day;<br> But as I trembled there, at last I heard<br> How in a low voice it gave forth this word:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>What say&#146;st thou?&#151;'Live on still&#151;I loved thee not<br> The while I lived; my bane from thee I got:<br> And canst thou think that I shall love thee, then,<br> Where no will is, or power to sons of men?'<br> I know not, thou mayst hate me, yet I come<br> That I may look on thee in that new home</i> <A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A><br> <i>My hands built for thee: if the priests speak truth,<br> What heart thou hast may yet be stirred by ruth,<br> When thy changed eyes behold the traitorous Queen<br> Tormented for the vile thing she has been&#151;<br> If, as the books say, e&#146;en such ways they have<br> As we on this explored side of the grave.<br> Yea, thou mayst pity then mine agony,<br> When no more evil I can do to thee.<br> Here on the earth I could not weep enow,<br> Or show thee all my misery here, and thou<br> Must ever look upon me as a Queen,<br> Thy mistress and thy fear. Couldst thou have seen<br> My weary ways upon this long, long night&#151;<br> Couldst thou behold the coming day's new sight,<br> When round this tree the folk come gathering<br> To see the wife and daughter of a King,<br> Slain by her own hand, and in such a wise&#151;<br> O thou I hoped for once, might not thine eyes<br> Have softened had they seen me shivering here,<br> Alone, unholpen, sick with my first fear,<br> Beat down by coming shame, and mocked by these<br> Gay fluttering rags of dainty braveries<br> That decked my state; by gold, and pearl, and gem,<br> Over my wretched breast, set in the hem<br> This night has torn, and o&#146;er my bleeding feet;<br> Mocked by this glittering girdle, nowise meet<br> To do the hangman's office?&#151;Couldst thou see<br> That even so I needs must think of thee&#151;<br> Whom I have slain, whose eyes I have made blind</i>, <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A><br> <i>Whose feet I stayed that me they might not find,<br> That I might not be helped of any one?</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The day was dawning when her words were done,<br> And to her waist I saw her set her hand,<br> And take the girdle thence, and therewith stand<br> With arms that moved above her head a space<br> Within the tree; and still she had her face<br> Turned from me, and I stirred not, minding me<br> Of tales of treacherous women of the sea,<br> The bane of men; but now her arms down fell,<br> And low she spake, yet could I hear her well:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Thou bitter noose, that thus shalt end my days,<br> Rather than blame, shalt thou have thanks and praise<br> From all men: I have loved one man alone,<br> And unto him the worst deed have I done<br> Of all the ill deeds I have done on earth.<br> &#151;I curse men not, although midst mocks and mirth,<br> They say, Rejoice, for Sthenob&#156;a is dead</i>.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I started forward as that word she said,<br> And she beheld me&#151;face to face we met<br> In the grey light, nor shall I e&#146;er forget<br> Those dreadful eyes, for such indeed I deem<br> A goddess high up in the heavens might seem<br> If she should learn that all was changed, to bring<br> Death on her head as on an earthly thing. <A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A><br> Alas! I have beheld men die ere now,<br> But eld or sickness sore their hearts did bow<br> With feebleness to bear what might betide,<br> Or else mid hope of name and fame they died,<br> And the world left them unawares; but she,<br> Full of hot blood and life yet, I could see<br> Was red-lipped as an image, and still had<br> Such smooth, soft cheeks as made beholders glad:<br> In many a feast and solemn sacrifice;<br> But yet such dreadful hate was in her eyes,<br> Such loathing of the ways of Gods and men,<br> Such gathered-up despair, that truly then<br> I shook so that my hands might hold no more<br> The staff and half-filled basket that I bore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But in a moment slowly she turned round,<br> And toward the rising swarded space of ground<br> Betwixt the beech-trees and the sea she went;<br> And I, although I knew well her intent,<br> Yet could not stir. There on the brink she stood;<br> A cool sea-wind now swept into the wood,<br> And drave her raiment round her; I could see,<br> E&#146;en in the dawn, that jewelled broidery<br> Gleam in the torn folds of the glittering hem;<br> And now she raised her arms, I saw on them<br> Jewels again&#151;Then sightless did I stand,<br> For such a cry I heard, as though a hand<br> Of fire upon her wasted heart was laid,<br> And to and fro, I deem, a space she swayed <A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A><br> Her slender body; then I moved at last,<br> And hurried toward the sheer cliff's edge full fast,<br> But ere I reached the green brink, was she gone;<br> And, hanging o&#146;er the rugged edge alone,<br> With trembling hands, far down did I behold<br> A white thing meet the dark grey waves and cold;<br> For overhanging is that foreland high,<br> And little sand beneath its feet doth lie<br> At lowest of the tide, and on that morn<br> Against the scarped rock was the white surf borne.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, long I looked before I turned away.<br> No friend, indeed, was lost to me that day&#151;<br> I knew her not but by the people's voice,<br> And they &#146;twas like hereat would e&#146;en rejoice;<br> Yet o&#146;er my heart a yearning passion swept,<br> And there where she had stood I lay and wept,<br> Worn as I am by care and toil and eld.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when I rose again, then I beheld<br> The girdle to the rough bough hanging yet,<br> And this I loosed and in my hand did get,<br> And lingered for a while; then went my way,<br> Nor thought at first if it were night or day,<br> So much I pondered on the tale so wrought,<br> What God to nothing such a life had brought.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But when unto the city gate I came,<br> I found the thronging people all aflame<br> With many rumours, and this one they knew <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A><br> Among all other guesses to be true,<br> That of the Queen nought knew her wonted place;<br> But unto me who still beheld that face<br> There in the beech-wood, idle and base enow<br> Seemed all that clamour carried to and fro&#151;<br> Curses and mocks, and foolish laughter loud,<br> And gaping wonder of the empty crowd;<br> So in great haste I got my errand done,<br> And sold my wares e&#146;en unto such an one<br> As first remembered he must eat to-day,<br> What king or queen soe&#146;er had passed away.<br> Thus I returned, bringing the belt with me&#151;<br> Behold it!&#151;And what way seems best to thee<br> To take herein?&#151;Poor are we: these bright stones<br> Would make us happier than the highest ones;<br> Yet danger hangs thereby, nor have I yet<br> My living from dead corpses had to get;<br> Nay, scarcely can I deem this Queen will be<br> At rest for long beneath the unquiet sea.<br> &#151;How say&#146;st thou, shall I go unto the King,<br> And tell him every word about the thing<br> E&#146;en as I know it?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, nay, nay," she said,<br> "Certes but little do I fear the dead,<br> Yet think thou not to call the girdle thine;<br> With a man's death doth every gem here shine&#151;<br> Our deaths the first: but do thou bide at home,<br> And let the King hear what may even come<br> To a King's ears; meddle thou not, nor make <A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A><br> With any such; still shall the brass pot break<br> The earthen pot&#151;a lord is thanked for what<br> A poor man often has in prison sat.<br> But down the beach run thou thy shallop straight,<br> And from the net take off the heaviest weight,<br> And do this belt about it; and then go<br> And in the deepest of the green bay sow<br> This seed and fruit of love and wrath and crime,<br> And let this tale be dealt with by great time;<br> But &#146;twixt the sea and the green southering hill<br> We will abide, peaceful if toilsome still."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was it done, and e&#146;en as in her heart<br> Was hidden from all eyes her traitrous part,<br> So the sea hid her heart from all but those,<br> Who, having passed through all eld's dreamy doze,<br> Died with their tale untold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed away,<br> And dimmer grew her name day after day;<br> And the fair place, where erst her eyes had chilled<br> Sweet laughter into silence, now was filled<br> By folk who, midst of fair life slipping by,<br> No longer had her deeds in memory;<br> There where she once had dwelt mid hate and praise,<br> No smile, no shudder now her name could raise. <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE night had fallen or ere the tale was done,<br> And on the hall-floor now the pale moon shone<br> In fitful gleams, for the snow fell no more,<br> But ragged clouds still streamed the pale sky o&#146;er:<br> A while they sat, and seemed to hear the sea<br> Beat &#146;gainst the ice-glazed cliffs unceasingly,<br> Though nought belike that noise was but the wind<br> Caught in some corner, half blocked-up and blind<br> With the white drift:&#151;just so the mournfulness<br> Of the tale told out did their hearts oppress<br> With seeming sorrow, for a glorious life<br> Twisted awry and crushed dead in the strife<br> Long ages past; while yet more like it was<br> That with the old tale o&#146;er their souls did pass<br> Shades of their own dead hopes, and buried pain<br> By measured words drawn from its grave again,<br> Though no more deemed a strange unheard-of thing<br> Made but for them; as when their hearts did cling<br> To those dead hopes of things impossible,<br> While their tale's ending yet was left to tell. <A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>STILL the hard frost griped all things bitterly,<br> And who of folk might now say when or why<br> The earth should change and spring come back again.<br> &#151;Spring clean forgotten, as amidst his pain<br> Some hapless lover's chance unmeaning kiss<br> Given unto lips that never shall be his<br> In time long passed, ere bitter knowledge came,<br> And cherished love was grown a wrong and shame.<br> &#151;Yet mid the dead swoon of the earth, the days<br> &#146;Gan lengthen now, and on the hard-beat ways<br> No more the snow drave down; and, spite of all,<br> The goodman's thoughts must needs begin to fall<br> Upon the seed hid in the dying year,<br> And he must busy him about his gear;<br> And in the city, at the high noon, when<br> The faint sun glimmered, sat the ancient men,<br> With young folk gathered round about once more,<br> Who heeded not the east wind's smothered roar,<br> Since unto most of them for mere delight<br> Were most things made, the dull days and the bright;<br> And change was life to them, and death a tale<br> Little believed, that chiefly did avail<br> To quicken love and make a story sweet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the old Swabian's glittering eyes did meet<br> A maiden's glance, who reddened at his gaze, <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A><br> Whereon a pleasant smile came o&#146;er his face,<br> As from his pouch a yellow book he drew<br> And spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of many things the wise man knew,<br> The man who wrote this; many words he made<br> Of haps that still perchance for great are weighed<br> There in the East: how kings were born and died,<br> And how men lied to them, and how they lied,<br> And how they joyed in doing good and ill:<br> Now mid the great things that his book do fill,<br> Here is a tale, told, saith he, by a crone<br> At some grand feast forgotten long agone,<br> Which may perchance scarce be of much less worth<br> Than tales of deeds that reddened the green earth&#151;<br> Fools' deeds of men, who well may be to you<br> As good as nameless, since ye never knew<br> The ways of those midst whom they lived erewhile,<br> And what their hearts deemed good, or nought, and vile."</p>
