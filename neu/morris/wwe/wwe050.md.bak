CHAPTER 25

The Fellowship Comes to Whiteness

Two days thereafter the chapmen having done with their matters in
Cheaping Knowe, whereas they must needs keep some of their wares for
other places, and especially for Goldburg, they dight them to be gone
and rode out a-gates of a mid-morning with banners displayed.

It was some fifty miles thence to Whiteness, which lay close underneath
the mountains, and was, as it were, the door of the passes whereby men
rode to Goldburg.  The land which they passed through was fair, both of
tillage and pasture, with much cattle therein. Everywhere they saw men
and women working afield, but no houses of worthy yeomen or vavassors,
or cots of good husbandmen. Here and there was a castle or strong-house,
and here and there long rows of ugly hovels, or whiles houses, big tall
and long, but exceeding foul and ill-favoured, such as Ralph had not yet
seen the like of.  And when he asked of Clement concerning all this, he
said:  "It is as I have told thee, that here be no freemen who work
afield, nay, nor villeins either.  All those whom ye have seen working
have been bought and sold like to those whom we saw standing on the
Stone in the market of Cheaping Knowe, or else were born of such cattle,
and each one of them can be bought and sold again, and they work not
save under the whip. And as for those hovels and the long and foul
houses, they are the stables wherein this kind of cattle is harboured."

Then Ralph's heart sank, and he said:  "Master Clement, I prithee tell
me; were it possible that the damsel whom I seek may be come to such a
pass as one of these?" "Nay," quoth Clement, "that is little like to be;
such goodly wares are kept for the adornment of great men's houses. True
it is that whiles the house-thralls be sent into the fields for their
punishment; yet not such as she, unless the master be wholly wearied of
them, or if their wrath outrun their wits; for it is more to the
master's profit to chastise them at home; so keep a good heart I bid
thee, and maybe we shall have tidings at Whiteness."

So Ralph refrained his anxious heart, though forsooth his thought was
much upon the damsel and of how she was faring.

It was not till the third day at sunset that they came to Whiteness; for
on the last day of their riding they came amongst the confused hills
that lay before the great mountains, which were now often hidden from
their sight; but whenever they appeared through the openings of the near
hills, they seemed very great and terrible; dark and bare and stony; and
Clement said that they were little better than they looked from afar. 
As to Whiteness, they saw it a long way off, as it lay on a long ridge
at the end of a valley: and so long was the ridge, that behind it was
nothing green; naught but the huge and bare mountains.  The westering
sun fell upon its walls and its houses, so that it looked white indeed
against those great cliffs and crags; though, said Clement, that these
were yet a good way off.  Now when, after a long ride from the hither
end of the valley, they drew nigh to the town, Ralph saw that the walls
and towers were not very high or strong, for so steep was the hill
whereon the town stood, that it needed not. Here also was no great
castle within the town as at Cheaping Knowe, and the town itself nothing
so big, but long and straggling along the top of the ridge.  Cheaping
Knowe was all builded of stone; but the houses here were of timber for
the most part, done over with pargeting and whitened well.  Yet was the
town more cheerful of aspect than Cheaping Knowe, and the folk who came
thronging about the chapmen at the gates not so woe-begone, and goodly
enough.

Of the lord of Whiteness, Clement told that he paid tribute to him of
Cheaping Knowe, rather for love of peace than for fear of him; for he
was no ill lord, and free men lived well under him.

So the chapmen lodged in the market-place; and in two days time Ralph
got speech of the Deacon of the Chapmen of the Town; who told him two
matters; first that the lord of Utterbol had not been in Whiteness these
six months; and next that the wild man had verily brought the damsel
into the market; but he had turned away thence suddenly with her,
without bringing her to the stone, and that it was most like that he
would have the lord of Utterbol buy her; who, since he would be deeming
that he might easily bend her to his will, would give him the better
penny for her. "At the last," quoth the Deacon, "the wild man led her
away toward the mountain pass that goeth to Goldburg, the damsel and he
alone, and she with her hands unbound and riding a little horse." Of
these tidings Ralph deemed it good that all traces of her were not lost;
but his heart misgave him when he thought that by this time she must
surely be in the hands of the lord of Utterbol.
