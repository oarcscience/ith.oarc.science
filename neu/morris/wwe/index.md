The Well at World's End was one of William Morris' fantasy novels. Set
in a medival fantasy setting, the hero, Ralph of Upmeads, a minor son of
a minor king, sets out in search of the Well at World's End. This well
grants near-immortality and a heightened sense of destiny. Ralph meets a
mysterious woman who has found the well, however, she is killed. A
second woman named Ursula helps Ralph find the well. The book is a
classic journey 'there and back again' which will keep lovers of Tolkien
and C.S. Lewis happy.
