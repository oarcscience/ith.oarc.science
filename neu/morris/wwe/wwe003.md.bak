CHAPTER 2

Ralph Goeth Back Home to the High House

Ralph and King Peter walked slowly home together, and as they went King
Peter fell to telling of how in his young days he rode in the Wood
Debateable, and was belated there all alone, and happed upon men who
were outlaws and wolfheads, and feared for his life; but they treated
him kindly, and honoured him, and saw him safe on his way in the
morning.  So that never thereafter would he be art and part with those
who hunted outlaws to slay them. "For," said he, "it is with these men
as with others, that they make prey of folk; yet these for the more part
prey on the rich, and the lawful prey on the poor.  Otherwise it is with
these wolfheads as with lords and knights and franklins, that as there
be bad amongst them, so also there be good; and the good ones I happed
on, and so may another man."

Hereto paid Ralph little heed at that time, since he had heard the tale
and its morality before, and that more than once; and moreover his mind
was set upon his own matters and these was he pondering.  Albeit
perchance the words abode with him. So came they to the House, and
Ralph's mother, who was a noble dame, and well-liking as for her years,
which were but little over fifty, stood in the hall-door to see which of
her sons should come back to her, and when she saw them coming together,
she went up to them, and cast her arms about Ralph and kissed him and
caressed him— being exceeding glad that it was he and not one of the
others who had returned to dwell with them; for he was her best-beloved,
as was little marvel, seeing that he was by far the fairest and the most
loving.  But Ralph's face grew troubled again in his mother's arms, for
he loved her exceeding well; and forsooth he loved the whole house and
all that dwelt there, down to the turnspit dogs in the chimney ingle,
and the swallows that nested in the earthen bottles, which when he was
little he had seen his mother put up in the eaves of the out-bowers: but
now, love or no love, the spur was in his side, and he must needs hasten
as fate would have him.  However, when he had disentangled himself from
his mother's caresses, he enforced himself to keep a cheerful
countenance, and upheld it the whole evening through, and was by seeming
merry at supper, and went to bed singing.
