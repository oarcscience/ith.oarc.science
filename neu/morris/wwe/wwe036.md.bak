CHAPTER 11

Ralph Cometh Out of the Wilderness

Long he stood letting these thoughts run through his mind, but at last
when it was now midmorning, he stirred and gat him slowly down the green
slope, and for very pity of himself the tears brake out from him as he
crossed the stream and came into the bushy valley.  There he stayed his
feet a little, and said to himself:  "And whither then am I going?" He
thought of the Castle of Abundance and the Champions of the Dry Tree, of
Higham, and the noble warriors who sat at the Lord Abbot's board, and of
Upmeads and his own folk:  but all seemed naught to him, and he
thought:  "And how can I go back and bear folk asking me curiously of my
wayfarings, and whether I will do this, that, or the other thing."
Withal he thought of that fair damsel and her sweet mouth in the
hostelry at Bourton Abbas, and groaned when he thought of love and its
ending, and he said within himself:  "and now she is a wanderer about
the earth as I am;" and he thought of her quest, and the chaplet of dame
Katherine, his gossip, which he yet bore on his neck, and he deemed that
he had naught to choose but to go forward and seek that he was doomed
to; and now it seemed to him that there was that one thing to do and no
other. And though this also seemed to him but weariness and grief, yet
whereas he had ever lightly turned him to doing what work lay ready to
hand; so now he knew that he must first of all get him out of that
wilderness, that he might hear the talk of folk concerning the Well at
the World's End, which he doubted not to hear again when he came into
the parts inhabited.

So now, with his will or without it, his feet bore him on, and he
followed up the stream which the Lady had said ran into the broad river
called the Swelling Flood; "for," thought he, "when I come thereabout I
shall presently find some castle or good town, and it is like that
either I shall have some tidings of the folk thereof, or else they will
compel me to do something, and that will irk me less than doing deeds of
mine own will."

He went his ways till he came to where the wood and the trees ended, and
the hills were lower and longer, well grassed with short grass, a down
country fit for the feeding of sheep; and indeed some sheep he saw, and
a shepherd or two, but far off.  At last, after he had left the stream
awhile, because it seemed to him to turn and wind round over much to the
northward, he came upon a road running athwart the down country, so that
he deemed that it must lead one way down to the Swelling Flood; so he
followed it up, and after a while began to fall in with folk; and first
two Companions armed and bearing long swords over their shoulders: he
stopped as they met, and stared at them in the face, but answered not
their greeting; and they had no will to meddle with him, seeing his
inches and that he was well armed, and looked no craven: so they went
on.

Next he came on two women who had with them an ass between two panniers,
laden with country stuff; and they were sitting by the wayside, one old
and the other young.  He made no stay for them, and though he turned his
face their way, took no heed of them more than if they were trees;
though the damsel, who was well-liking and somewhat gaily clad, stood up
when she saw his face anigh, and drew her gown skirt about her and moved
daintily, and sighed and looked after him as he went on, for she longed
for him.

Yet again came two men a-horseback, merchants clad goodly, with three
carles, their servants, riding behind them; and all these had weapons
and gave little more heed to him than he to them. But a little after
they were gone, he stopped and said within himself: "Maybe I had better
have gone their way, and this road doubtless leadeth to some place of
resort."

But even therewith he heard horsehoofs behind him, and anon came up a
man a-horseback, armed with jack and sallet, a long spear in his hand,
and budgets at his saddle-bow, who looked like some lord's man going a
message. He nodded to Ralph, who gave him good-day; for seeing these
folk and their ways had by now somewhat amended his mind; and now he
turned not, but went on as before.

At last the way clomb a hill longer and higher than any he had yet
crossed, and when he had come to the brow and looked down, he saw the
big river close below running through the wide valley which he had
crossed with Roger on that other day. Then he sat down on the green bank
above the way, so heavy of heart that not one of the things he saw gave
him any joy, and the world was naught to him.  But within a while he
came somewhat to himself, and, looking down toward the river, he saw
that where the road met it, it was very wide, and shallow withal, for
the waves rippled merrily and glittered in the afternoon sun, though
there was no wind; moreover the road went up white from the water on the
other side, so he saw clearly that this was the ford of a highway.  The
valley was peopled withal: on the other side of the river was a little
thorp, and there were carts and sheds scattered about the hither side,
and sheep and neat feeding in the meadows, and in short it was another
world from the desert.
