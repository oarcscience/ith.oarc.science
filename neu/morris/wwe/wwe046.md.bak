CHAPTER 21

A Battle in the Mountains

When it was morning they arose early and ate a morsel; and Clement gave
freely to the Warden and his helpmate on behalf of the fellowship; and
then they saddled their nags, and did on the loads and departed; and the
way was evil otherwise, but it was down hill, and all waters ran east.

All day they rode, and at even when the sun had not quite set, they
pitched their camp at the foot of a round knoll amidst a valley where
was water and grass; and looking down thence, they had a sight of the
fruitful plain, wherein lay Cheaping Knowe all goodly blue in the
distance.

This was a fair place and a lovely, and great ease would they have had
there, were it not that they must keep watch and ward with more pains
than theretofore; for Clement deemed it as good as certain that the wild
men would fall upon them that night.

But all was peaceful the night through, and in the morning they gat to
the way speedily, riding with their armour on, and their bows bent: and
three of the men-at-arms rode ahead to espy the way.

So it befell that they had not ridden two hours ere back came the
fore-riders with the tidings that the pass next below them was thick
with the Strong-thieves.

The fellowship were as then in such a place, that they were riding a
high bare ridge, and could not be assailed to the advantage of the
thieves if they abode where they were; whereas if they went forward,
they must needs go down with the road into the dale that was beset by
the wild men.  Now they were three-score and two all told, but of these
but a score of men-at-arms besides Ralph, and Clement, who was a stout
fighter when need was. Of the others, some were but lads, and of the
Chapmen were three old men, and more than one blencher besides. 
However, all men were armed, and they had many bows, and some of the
chapmen's knaves were fell archers.

So they took counsel together, and to some it seemed better to abide the
onset on their vantage ground. But to Clement and the older men-at-arms
this seemed of no avail. For though they could see the plain country
down below, they would have no succour of it; and Clement bade them
think how the night would come at last, and that the longer they abode,
the greater would be the gathering of the Strong-thieves; so that, all
things considered, it were better to fall on at once and to try the
adventure of the valley. And this after some talk they yea-said all,
save a few who held their skins so dear that their wits wandered
somewhat.

So these timorous ones they bade guard the sumpter beasts and their
loads; and even so they did, and abode a little, while the men-at-arms
and the bowmen went forward without more ado; and Ralph rode betwixt
Clement and the captain of the men-at-arms.

Presently they were come close to the place where the way went down into
the valley, cleaving through a clayey bent, so that the slippery sides
of the cleft went up high to right and left; wherefore by goodhap there
were no big stones anigh to roll down upon them.  Moreover the way was
short, and they rode six abreast down the pass and were soon through the
hollow way. As he rode Ralph saw a few of the Strong-thieves at the
nether end where the pass widened out, and they let fly some arrows at
the chapmen which did no hurt, though some of the shafts rattled on the
armour of the companions. But when Clement saw that folk, and heard the
noise of their shouting he lifted up a great axe that he bore and cried,
"St. Agnes for the Mercers!" and set spurs to his horse. So did they
all, and came clattering and shouting down the steep road like a stone
out of a sling, and drave right into the valley one and all, the
would-be laggards following after; for they were afraid to be left
behind.

The wild men, who, save for wide shields which they bore, were but
evilly armed, mostly in skins of beasts, made no countenance of defence,
but fled all they might towards the steep slopes of the valley, and then
turned and fell to shooting; for the companions durst not pursue in
haste lest they should be scattered, and overwhelmed by the multitude of
foemen; but they drew up along the south side of the valley, and had the
mastery of the road, so that this first bout was without blood-shedding.
Albeit the thieves still shot in their weak bows from the hill-side, but
scarce hurt a man. Then the bowmen of the fellowship fell to shooting at
the wild men, while the men-at-arms breathed their horses, and the
sumpter-beasts were gathered together behind them; for they had no dread
of abiding there a while, whereas behind them the ground was broken into
a steep shaly cliff, bushed here and there with tough bushes, so that no
man could come up it save by climbing with hand and knee, and that not
easily.

Now when the archers had shot a good while, and some of the thieves had
fallen before them, and men were in good heart because of the flight of
the wild men, Ralph, seeing that these still hung about the slopes,
cried out: "Master Clement, and thou Captain, sure it will be ill-done
to leave these men unbroken behind us, lest they follow us and hang
about our hindermost, slaying us both men and horses."

"Even so," quoth the captain, who was a man of few words, "let us go.
But do thou, Clement, abide by the stuff with the lads and bowmen."

Then he cried out aloud:  "St. Christopher to aid!" and shook his rein,
and all they who were clad in armour and well mounted spurred on with
him against the strong-thieves. But these, when they saw the onset of
the horsemen, but drew a little up the hill-side and stood fast, and
some of the horses were hurt by their shot. So the captain bade draw
rein and off horse, while Clement led his bowmen nigher, and they shot
well together, and hindered the thieves from closing round the
men-at-arms, or falling on the horses. So then the companions went
forward stoutly on foot, and entered into the battle of the thieves, and
there was the thrusting and the hewing great:  for the foemen bore axes,
and malls, and spears, and were little afraid, having the
vantage-ground; and they were lithe and strong men, though not tall.

Ralph played manfully, and was hurt by a spear above the knee, but not
grievously; so he heeded it not, but cleared a space all about him with
great strokes of the Upmeads' blade; then as the wild men gave back
there was one of them who stood his ground and let drive a stroke of a
long-handled hammer at him, but Ralph ran in under the stroke and caught
him by the throat and drew him out of the press. And even therewith the
wild men broke up before the onset of the all-armed carles, and fled up
the hill, and the men-at-arms followed them but a little, for their
armour made them unspeedy; so that they took no more of those men,
though they slew some, but turned about and gathered round Ralph and
made merry over his catch, for they were joyous with the happy end of
battle; and Clement, who had left his bowmen when the Companions were
mingled with the wild-men, was there amidst the nighest.

Said Ralph to him:  "Well, have I got me a servant and thrall good
cheap?" "Yea," said Clement, "if thou deem a polecat a likely hound."
Said the Captain:  "Put thy sword through him, knight."  Quoth another:
"Let him run up hill, and our bowmen shall shoot a match at him."

"Nay," said Ralph, "they have done well with their shooting, let them
rest. As to my thrusting my sword through the man, Captain, I had done
that before, had I been so minded.  At any rate, I will ask him if he
will serve me truly. Otherwise he seemeth a strong carle and a handy. 
How sayest thou, lad, did I take thee fairly?"  "Yea," said the man,
"thou art a strong lad."

He seemed to fear the swords about him but little, and forsooth he was a
warrior-like man, and not ill-looking. He was of middle height, strong
and well-knit, with black hair like a beast's mane for shagginess, and
bright blue eyes.  He was clad in a short coat of grey homespun, with an
ox-skin habergeon laced up over it; he had neither helm nor hat, nor
shoes, but hosen made of a woollen clout tied about his legs; his shield
of wood and ox-hide lay on the ground a few paces off, and his hammer
beside it, which he had dropped when Ralph first handled him, but a
great ugly knife was still girt to him.

Now Ralph saith to him:  "Which wilt thou—be slain, or serve me?" Said
the carle, grinning, yet not foully:  "Guess if I would not rather serve
thee!"  "Wilt thou serve me truly?" said Ralph. "Why not?" quoth the
carle:  "yet I warn thee that if thou beat me, save in hot blood, I
shall put a knife into thee when I may."  "O," said one, "thrust him
through now at once, lord Ralph." "Nay, I will not," said Ralph; "he
hath warned me fairly. Maybe he will serve me truly.  Master Clement,
wilt thou lend me a horse for my man to ride?"  "Yea," said Clement;
"yet I misdoubt me of thy new squire."  Then he turned to the
men-at-arms and said:  "No tarrying, my masters! To horse and away
before they gather gain!"

So they mounted and rode away from that valley of the pass, and Ralph
made his man ride beside him.  But the man said to him, as soon as they
were riding:  "Take note that I will not fight against my kindred."
"None biddeth thee so," said Ralph; "but do thou take heed that if thou
fight against us I will slay thee outright."  Said the man: "A fair
bargain!"  "Well," said Ralph, "I will have thy knife of thee, lest it
tempt thee, as is the wont of cold iron, and a maiden's body." "Nay,
master," quoth the man, "leave me my knife, as thou art a good fellow.
In two hours time we shall be past all peril of my people, and when we
come down below I will slay thee as many as thou wilt, so it be out of
the kindred.  Forsooth down there evil they be, and unkinsome."

"So be it, lad," said Ralph, laughing, "keep thy knife; but hang this
word of mine thereon, that if thou slay any man of this fellowship save
me, I will rather flay thee alive than slay thee." Quoth the carle: 
"That is the bargain, then, and I yeasay it." "Good," said Ralph; "now
tell me thy name."  "Bull Shockhead," said the carle.

But now the fellowship took to riding so fast down the slopes of the
mountains on a far better road, that talking together was not easy. They
kept good watch, both behind and ahead, nor were they set upon again,
though whiles they saw clumps of men on the hill-sides.

So after a while, when it was a little past noon, they came adown to the
lower slopes of the mountains and the foot-hills, which were green and
unstony; and thereon were to be seen cattle and neatherds and shepherds,
and here and there the garth of a homestead, and fenced acres about it.

So now that they were come down into the peopled parts, they displayed
the banners of their fellowships, to wit, the Agnes, the White Fleece,
the Christopher, and the Ship and Nicholas, which last was the banner of
the Faring-knights of Whitwall; but Ralph was glad to ride under the
banner of St. Nicholas, his friend, and deemed that luck might the
rather come to him thereby. But they displayed their banners now,
because they knew that no man of the peopled parts would be so hardy as
to fall upon the Chapmen, of whom they looked to have many matters for
their use and pleasure.

So now that they felt themselves safe, they stayed them, and sat down by
a fair little stream, and ate their dinner of such meat and drink as
they had; and Ralph departed his share with his thrall, and the man was
hungry and ate well; so that Clement said mockingly: "Thou feedest thy
thrall over well, lord, even for a king's son: is it so that thou art
minded to fatten him and eat him?" Then some of the others took up the
jest, and bade the carle refrain him of the meat, so that he might not
fatten, and might live the longer. He hearkened to them, and knit his
brows and looked fiercely from one to the other.  But Ralph laughed
aloud, and shook his finger at him and refrained him, and his wrath ran
off him and he laughed, and shoved the victual into him doughtily, and
sighed for pleasure when he had made an end and drunk a draught of wine.
