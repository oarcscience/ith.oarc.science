CHAPTER 23

Of the Town of Cheaping Knowe

Now when it was evening they pitched their camp down in the plain fields
amidst tall elmtrees, and had their banners still flying over the tents
to warn all comers of what they were. But the next morning the chapmen
and their folk were up betimes to rummage their loads, and to array
their wares for the market; and they gat not to the road before
mid-morning. Meantime of their riding Ralph had more talk with Bull, who
said to him: "Fair lord, I rede thee when thou art in the market of
Cheaping Knowe, bid master Clement bring thee to the thrall-merchant,
and trust me that if such a fair image as that we were speaking of hath
passed through his hands within these three months, he will remember it;
and then thou shalt have at least some tale of what hath befallen her
but a little while ago."

That seemed good rede to Ralph, and when they went on their way he rode
beside Clement, and asked him many things concerning Cheaping Knowe; and
at last about the thrall-market therein. And Clement said that, though
he dealt not in such wares, he had often seen them sold, and knew the
master of that market. And when Ralph asked if the said master would
answer questions concerning the selling of men and of women, Clement
smiled and said: "Yea, yea, he will answer; for as he lives by selling
thralls, and every time a thrall is sold by him he maketh some gain by
it, it is to his profit that they change masters as often as may be; and
when thou askest of the woman whom thou art seeking, he will be deeming
that there will be some new chaffer ahead. I will bring thee to him, and
thou shalt ask him of what thou wilt, and belike he will tell thee
quietly over the wine-cup."

Therewith was Ralph well content, and he grew eager to enter into the
town.

They came to the gates a little before sunset, after they had passed
through much fair country; but nigh to the walls it was bare of trees
and thickets, whereas, said Clement, they had been cut down lest they
should serve as cover to strong-thieves or folk assailing the town. The
walls were strong and tall, and a great castle stood high up on a hill,
about which the town was builded; so that if the town were taken there
would yet be another town within it to be taken also. But the town
within, save for the said castle, was scarce so fairly builded as the
worst of the towns which Ralph had seen erst, though there were a many
houses therein.

Much people was gathered about the gate to see the merchants enter with
banners displayed; and Ralph deemed many of the folk fair, such as were
goodly clad; for many had but foul clouts to cover their nakedness, and
seemed needy and hunger-pinched. Withal there were many warriors amongst
the throng, and most of these bore a token on their sleeves, to wit, a
sword reddened with blood. And Clement, speaking softly in Ralph's ear,
did him to wit that this was the token of the lord who had gotten the
castle in those days, and was tyrant of the town; and how that he had so
many men-at-arms ready to do his bidding that none in the town was safe
from him if he deemed it more for his pleasure and profit to rob or
maim, or torment or slay, than to suffer them to live peaceably. "But
with us chapmen," said Clement, "he will not meddle, lest there be an
end of chaffer in the town; and verily the market is good."

Thus they rode through the streets into the market place, which was wide
and great, and the best houses of the town were therein, and so came to
the hostel of the Merchants, called the Fleece, which was a big house,
and goodly enough.

The next morning Clement and the other chapmen went up into the Castle,
bearing with them gifts out of their wares for the lord, and Clement
bade Ralph keep close till he came back, and especially to keep his
war-caught thrall, Bull Shockhead, safe at home, lest he be taken from
him, and to clothe him in the guise of the chapman lads, and to dock his
hair; and even so Ralph did, though Bull were loath thereto.

About noon the chapmen came back again well pleased; and Clement gave
Ralph a parchment from the lord, which bade all men help and let pass
Ralph of Upmeads, as a sergeant of the chapmen's guard, and said withal
that now he was free to go about the town if he listed, so that he were
back at the hostel of the Fleece by nightfall.

So Ralph went in company with some of the sergeants and others, and
looked at this and that about the town without hindrance, save that the
guard would not suffer them to pass further than the bailey of the
Castle. And for the said bailey, forsooth, they had but little stomach;
for they saw thence, on the slopes of the Castle-hill, tokens of the
cruel justice of the said lord; for there were men and women there, yea,
and babes also, hanging on gibbets and thrust through with sharp pales,
and when they asked of folk why these had suffered, they but looked at
them as if astonished, and passed on without a word.

So they went thence, and found the master-church, and deemed it not much
fairer than it was great; and it was nowise great, albeit it was strange
and uncouth of fashion.

Then they came to great gardens within the town, and they were exceeding
goodly, and had trees and flowers and fruits in them which Ralph had not
seen hitherto, as lemons, and oranges, and pomegranates; and the waters
were running through them in runnels of ashlar; and the weather was fair
and hot; so they rested in those gardens till it was evening, and then
gat them home to Fleece, where they had good entertainment.
