CHAPTER 22

An Adventure in the Wood

Ralph arrayed himself for departure next morning without more words; and
when he was ready the carline said to him:  "When thou wentest forth
before, I was troubled at thy going and feared for thy returning: but
now I fear not; for I know that thou wilt return; though it may be
leading a fair woman by the hand.  So go, and all luck go with thee."
Ralph smiled at her words and went his ways, and came into the wood that
lay due south from the Castle, and he went on and on and had no thought
of turning back.  He rested twice and still went on, till the fashion of
the thickets and the woods changed about him; and at last when the sun
was getting low, he saw light gleaming through a great wood of pines,
which had long been dark before him against the tall boles, and soon he
came to the very edge of the wood, and going heedfully, saw between the
great stems of the outermost trees, a green strand, and beyond it a long
smooth water, a little lake between green banks on either side.  He came
out of the pinewood on to the grass; but there were thornbushes a few
about, so that moving warily from one to the other, he might perchance
see without being seen. Warily he went forsooth, going along the green
strand to the east and the head of that water, and saw how the bank
sloped up gently from its ending toward the pine-wood, in front of whose
close-set trees stood three great-boled tall oak-trees on a smooth piece
of green sward. And now he saw that there were folk come before him on
this green place, and keen-sighted as he was, could make out that three
men were on the hither side of the oak-trees, and on the further side of
them was a white horse.  Thitherward then he made, stealing from bush to
bush, since he deemed that he needed not be seen of men who might be
foes, for at the first sight he had noted the gleam of weapons there.
And now he had gone no long way before he saw the westering sun shine
brightly from a naked sword, and then another sprang up to meet it, and
he heard faintly the clash of steel, and saw withal that the third of
the folk had long and light raiment and was a woman belike. Then he
bettered his pace, and in a minute or two came so near that he could see
the men clearly, that they were clad in knightly war-gear, and were
laying on great strokes so that the still place rang with the clatter.
As for the woman, he could see but little of her, because of the
fighting men before her; and the shadow of the oak boughs fell on her
withal.

Now as he went, hidden by the bushes, they hid the men also from him,
and when he was come to the last bush, some fifty paces from them, and
peered out from it, in that very nick of time the two knights were
breathing them somewhat, and Ralph saw that one of them, the furthest
from him, was a very big man with a blue surcoat whereon was beaten a
great golden sun, and the other, whose back was towards Ralph, was clad
in black over his armour. Even as he looked and doubted whether to show
himself or not, he of the sun raised his sword aloft, and giving forth a
great roar as of wrath and grief mingled together, rushed on his foe and
smote so fiercely that he fell to the earth before him, and the big man
fell upon him as he fell, and let knee and sword-pommel and fist follow
the stroke, and there they wallowed on the earth together.

Straightway Ralph came forth from the bushes with his drawn sword in his
hand, and even therewith what with the two knights being both low upon
the earth, what with the woman herself coming from out the shadow of the
oak boughs, and turning her toward Ralph, he saw her clearly, and stood
staring and amazed—for lo! it was the Lady whom he had delivered at the
want-ways. His heart well nigh stood still with joy, yet was he
shamefaced also: for though now she was no longer clad in that scanty
raiment, yet did he seem to see her body through that which covered it.
But now her attire was but simple; a green gown, thin and short, and
thereover a cote-hardy of black cloth with orphreys of gold and
colours:  but on her neck was a collar that seemed to him like to that
which Dame Katherine had given him; and the long tresses of her hair,
which he had erst seen floating loose about her, were wound as a garland
around her head. She looked with a flushed and joyous face on Ralph, and
seemed as if she heeded nought the battle of the knights, but saw him
only: but he feared her, and his love for her and stood still, and durst
not move forward to go to her.

Thus they abode for about the space of one minute:  and meanwhile the
big man rose up on one knee and steadied him with his sword for a moment
of time, and the blade was bloody from the point half way up to the
hilt; but the black knight lay still and made no sign of life. Then the
Knight of the Sun rose up slowly and stood on his feet and faced the
Lady and seemed not to see Ralph, for his back was towards him. He came
slowly toward the Lady, scowling, and his face white as chalk; then he
spake to her coldly and sternly, stretching out his bloody sword before
her.

"I have done thy bidding, and slain my very earthly friend of friends
for thy sake.  Wherewith wilt thou reward me?"

Then once more Ralph heard the voice, which he remembered so sweet
amidst peril and battle aforetime, as she said as coldly as the Knight: 
"I bade thee not:  thine own heart bade thee to strive with him because
thou deemedst that he loved me. Be content! thou hast slain him who
stood in thy way, as thou deemedst.  Thinkest thou that I rejoice at his
slaying? O no!  I grieve at it, for all that I had such good cause to
hate him."

He said:  "My own heart! my own heart!  Half of my heart biddeth me slay
thee, who hast made me slay him.  What wilt thou give me?" She knit her
brow and spake angrily:  "Leave to depart," she said. Then after a
while, and in a kinder voice:  "And thus much of my love, that I pray
thee not to sorrow for me, but to have a good heart, and live as a true
knight should."  He frowned: "Wilt thou not go with me?" said he.  "Not
uncompelled," she said: "if thou biddest me go with threats of hewing
and mangling the body which thou sayest thou lovest, needs must I go
then. Yet scarce wilt thou do this."

"I have a mind to try it," said he; "If I set thee on thine horse and
bound thine hands for thee, and linked thy feet together under the
beast's belly; belike thou wouldest come. Shall I have slain my
brother-in-arms for nought?"

"Thou hast the mind," said she, "hast thou the might?" "So I deem," said
he, smiling grimly.

She looked at him proudly and said:  "Yea, but I misdoubt me thereof."
He still had his back to Ralph and was staring at the lady; she turned
her head a little and made a sign to Ralph, just as the Knight of the
Sun said: "Thou misdoubtest thee?  Who shall help thee in the desert?"

"Look over thy left shoulder," she said.  He turned, and saw Ralph
drawing near, sword in hand, smiling, but somewhat pale. He drew aback
from the Lady and, spinning round on his heel, faced Ralph, and cried
out:  "Hah!  Hast thou raised up a devil against me, thou sorceress, to
take from me my grief and my lust, and my life? Fair will the game be to
fight with thy devil as I have fought with my friend!  Yet now I know
not whether I shall slay him or thee."

She spake not, but stood quietly looking on him, not unkindly, while a
wind came up from the water and played with a few light locks of hair
that hung down from that ruddy crown, and blew her raiment from her feet
and wrapped it close round her limbs; and Ralph beheld her, and close as
was the very death to him (for huge and most warrior-like was his
foeman) yet longing for her melted the heart within him, and he felt the
sweetness of life in his inmost soul as he had never felt it before.

Suddenly the Knight of the Sun turned about to the Lady again, and fell
down on his knees before her, and clasped his hands as one praying, and
said:  "Now pardon me all my words, I pray thee; and let this young man
depart unhurt, whether thou madest him, or hast but led him away from
country and friends and all. Then do thou come with me, and make some
semblance of loving me, and suffer me to love thee.  And then shall all
be well, for in a few days we will go back to thy people, and there will
I be their lord or thy servant, or my brother's man, or what thou wilt.
O wilt thou not let the summer days be sweet?"

But she spake, holding up her head proudly and speaking in a clear
ringing voice:  "I have said it, that uncompelled I will not go with
thee at all."  And therewithal she turned her face toward Ralph, as she
might do on any chance-met courteous man, and he saw her smiling, but
she said nought to him, and gave no token of knowing him.  Then the
Knight of the Sun sprang to his feet, and shook his sword above his head
and ran furiously on Ralph, who leapt nimbly on one side (else had he
been slain at once) and fetched a blow at the Sun-Knight, and smote him,
and brake the mails on his left shoulder, so that the blood sprang, and
fell on fiercely enough, smiting to right and left as the other gave
back at his first onset. But all was for nought, for the Knight of the
Sun, after his giving aback under that first stroke drew himself up
stark and stiff, and pressing on through all Ralph's strokes, though
they rent his mail here and there, ran within his sword, and smote him
furiously with the sword-pommel on the side of the head, so that the
young man of Upmeads could not stand up under the weight of the blow,
but fell to the earth swooning, and the Knight of the Sun knelt on him,
and drew out an anlace, short, thick and sharp, and cried out:  "Now,
Devil, let see whether thou wilt bleed black." Therewith he raised up
his hand:  but the weapon was stayed or ever it fell, for the Lady had
glided up to them when she saw that Ralph was overcome, and now she
stretched out her arm and caught hold of the Knight's hand and the
anlace withal, and he groaned and cried out:  "What now! thou art
strong-armed as well as white-armed; (for she had rent the sleeve back
from her right arm) and he laughed in the extremity of his wrath. But
she was pale and her lips quivered as she said softly and sweetly: "Wilt
thou verily slay this young man?"

"And why not?" said he, "since I have just slain the best friend that I
ever had, though he was nought willing to fight with me, and only for
this, that I saw thee toying with him; though forsooth thou hast said
truly that thou hadst more reason to hate him than love him.  Well,
since thou wilt not have this youngling slain, I may deem at least that
he is no devil of thy making, else wouldst thou be glad of his slaying,
so that he might be out of the path of thee; so a man he is, and a
well-favoured one, and young; and valiant, as it seemeth: so I suppose
that he is thy lover, or will be one day—well then—"

And he lifted his hand again, but again she stayed him, and said: "Look
thou, I will buy him of thee:  and, indeed, I owe him a life." "How is
that?" said he.  "Why wouldst thou know?" she said; "thou who, if thou
hadst me in thine hands again, wouldst keep me away from all men. Yea, I
know what thou wouldst say, thou wouldst keep me from sinning again."
And she smiled, but bitterly.  "Well, the tale is no long one: "five
days ago I was taken by them of the Burg:  and thou wottest what they
would do with me; yea, even if they deemed me less than they do deem me:
well, as two of their men-at-arms were leading me along by a halter, as
a calf is led to the butcher, we fell in with this goodly lad, who slew
them both in manly fashion, and I escaped for that time: though,
forsooth, I must needs put my neck in the noose again in delivering four
of our people, who would else have been tormented to death by the
Burgers."

"Well," said the knight, "perchance thou hast more mercy than I looked
for of thee; though I misdoubt thee that thou mayst yet pray me or some
other to slay him for thee.  Thou art merciful, my Queen, though not to
me, and a churl were I if I were less merciful than thou. Therefore will
I give his life to him, yet not to thee will I give him if I may help
it—Lo you, Sweet! he is just opening his eyes."

Therewith he rose up from Ralph, who raised himself a little, and sat up
dazed and feeble.  The Knight of the Sun stood up over him beside the
lady with his hands clasped on his sword-hilt, and said to Ralph: "Young
man, canst thou hear my words?"  Ralph smiled feebly and nodded a
yea-say. "Dost thou love thy life then?" said the Knight. Ralph found
speech and said faintly, "Yea."  Said the Knight: "Where dost thou come
from, where is thine home?"  Said Ralph, "Upmeads." "Well then," quoth
the big knight, "go back to Upmeads, and live." Ralph shook his head and
knit his brows and said, "I will not." "Yea," said the Knight, "thou
wilt not live?  Then must I shape me to thy humour.  Stand on thy feet
and fight it out; for now I am cool I will not slay a swordless man."

Ralph staggered up to his feet, but was so feeble still, that he sank
down again, and muttered:  "I may not; I am sick and faint;" and
therewith swooned away again.  But the Knight stood a while leaning on
his sword, and looking down on him not unkindly. Then he turned about to
the Lady, but lo! she had left his side. She had glided away, and got to
her horse, which was tethered on the other side of the oak-tree, and had
loosed him and mounted him, and so sat in the saddle there, the reins
gathered in her hands. She smiled on the knight as he stood astonished,
and cried to him; "Now, lord, I warn thee, draw not a single foot nigher
to me; for thou seest that I have Silverfax between my knees, and thou
knowest how swift he is, and if I see thee move, he shall spring away
with me. Thou wottest how well I know all the ways of the woodland, and
I tell thee that the ways behind me to the Dry Tree be all safe and
open, and that beyond the Gliding River I shall come on Roger of the
Ropewalk and his men.  And if thou thinkest to ride after me, and
overtake me, cast the thought out of thy mind. For thy horse is strong
but heavy, as is meet for so big a knight, and moreover he is many yards
away from me and Silverfax: so before thou art in the saddle, where
shall I be?  Yea," (for the Knight was handling his anlace) "thou mayst
cast it, and peradventure mayst hit Silverfax and not me, and
peradventure not; and I deem that it is my body alive that thou wouldest
have back with thee. So now, wilt thou hearken?"

"Yea," quoth the knight, though for wrath he could scarce bring the word
from his mouth.

"Hearken," she said, "this is the bargain to be struck between us: even
now thou wouldst not refrain from slaying this young man, unless
perchance he should swear to depart from us; and as for me, I would not
go back with thee to Sunhome, where erst thou shamedst me. Now will I
buy thy nay-say with mine, and if thou give the youngling his life, and
suffer him to come his ways with us, then will I go home with thee and
will ride with thee in all the love and duty that I owe thee; or if thou
like this fashion of words better, I will give thee my body for his
life. But if thou likest not the bargain, there is not another piece of
goods for thee in the market, for then I will ride my ways to the Dry
Tree, and thou shalt slay the poor youth, or make of him thy sworn
friend, like as was Walter—which thou wilt."

So she spake, and Ralph yet lay on the grass and heard nought. But the
Knight's face was dark and swollen with anger as he answered: "My sworn
friend! yea, I understand thy gibe.  I need not thy words to bring to my
mind how I have slain one sworn friend for thy sake."

"Nay," she said, "not for my sake, for thine own folly's sake." He
heeded her not, but went on:  "And as for this one, I say again of him,
if he be not thy devil, then thou meanest him for thy lover. And now I
deem that I will verily slay him, ere he wake again; belike it were his
better luck."

She said:  "I wot not why thou hagglest over the price of that thou
wouldest have.  If thou have him along with thee, shall he not be in thy
power—as I shall be? and thou mayst slay him—or me— when thou wilt."

"Yea," he said, grimly, "when thou art weary of him. O art thou not
shameless amongst women!  Yet must I needs pay thy price, though my
honour and the welfare of my life go with it. Yet how if he have no will
to fare with us?"  She laughed and said: "Then shalt thou have him with
thee as thy captive and thrall. Hast thou not conquered him in battle?" 
He stood silent a moment and then he said:  "Thou sayest it; he shall
come with me, will he, nill he, unarmed, and as a prisoner, and the
spoil of my valiancy." And he laughed, not altogether in bitterness, but
as if some joy were rising in his heart.  "Now, my Queen," said he, "the
bargain is struck betwixt us, and thou mayest light down off Silverfax;
as for me, I will go fetch water from the lake, that we may wake up this
valiant and mighty youth, this newfound jewel, and bring him to his wits
again."

She answered nought, but rode her horse close to him and lighted down
nimbly, while his greedy eyes devoured her beauty. Then he took her hand
and drew her to him, and kissed her cheek, and she suffered it, but
kissed him not again. Then he took off his helm, and went down to the
lake to fetch up water therein.
