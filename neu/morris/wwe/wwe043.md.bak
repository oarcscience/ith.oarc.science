CHAPTER 18

Ralph Departeth From Whitwall With the Fellowship of Clement Chapman

Therewithal they went together to Blaise's house, and when Blaise saw
them, he said:  "Well, Ralph, so thou must needs work at a little more
idling before thou fallest to in earnest. Forsooth I deem that when thou
comest back thou wilt find that we have cut thee out a goodly piece of
work for thy sewing. For the good town is gathering a gallant host of
men; and we shall look to thee to do well in the hard hand-play, whenso
that befalleth. But now come and look at my house within, how fair it
is, and thou wilt see that thou wilt have somewhat to fight for, whereas
I am."

Therewith he led them up a stair into the great chamber, which was all
newly dight and hung with rich arras of the Story of Hercules; and there
was a goodly cupboard of silver vessel, and some gold, and the cupboard
was of five shelves as was but meet for a king's son. So Ralph praised
all, but was wishful to depart, for his heart was sore, and he blamed
himself in a manner that he must needs lie to his brother.

But Blaise brought them to the upper chamber, and showed them the goodly
beds with their cloths, and hangings, and all was as fair as might be.
Then Blaise bade bring wine and made them drink; and he gave Ralph a
purse of gold, and an anlace very fair of fashion, and brought him to
the door thereafter; and Ralph cast his arms about him, and kissed him
and strained him to his breast.  But Blaise was somewhat moved thereat,
and said to him:  "Why lad, thou art sorry to depart from me for a
little while, and what would it be, were it for long? But ever wert thou
a kind and tender-hearted youngling, and we twain are alone in an alien
land.  Forsooth, I wot that thou hast, as it were, embraced the Upmeads
kindred, father, mother and all; and good is that! So now God and the
Saints keep thee, and bear in mind the hosting of the good town, and the
raising of the banner, that shall be no great while. Fare thee well,
lad!"

So they parted, and Ralph went back to the hostel, and gathered his
stuff together, and laid it on a sumpter horse, and armed him, and so
went into Petergate to join himself to that company. There he found the
chapmen, five of them in all, and their lads, and a score of
men-at-arms, with whom was Clement, not clad like a merchant, but
weaponed, and bearing a coat of proof and a bright sallet on his head.

They greeted each the other, and Ralph said:  "Yea, master Clement, and
be we riding to battle?"  "Maybe," quoth Clement; "the way is long, and
our goods worth the lifting, and there are some rough places that we
must needs pass through. But if ye like not the journey, abide here in
this town the onset of Walter the Black."

Therewith he laughed, and Ralph understanding the jape, laughed also;
and said:  "Well, master Clement, but tell me who be these that we shall
meet."  "Yea, and I will tell thee the whole tale of them," said
Clement, "but abide till we are without the gates; I am busy man e'en
now, for all is ready for the road, save what I must do. So now bid thy
Upmeads squire farewell, and then to horse with thee!"

So Ralph cast his arms about Richard, and kissed him and said: "This is
also a farewell to the House where I was born and bred." And as he spake
the thought of the House and the garden, and the pleasant fields of
Upmeads came into his heart so bitter-sweet, that it mingled with his
sorrow, and well-nigh made him weep. But as for Richard he forebore
words, for he was sad at heart for the sundering.

Then he gat to horse, and the whole company of them bestirred them, and
they rode out a-gates. And master Clement it was that ordered them,
riding up and down along the array.

But Ralph fell to speech with the chapmen and men-at-arms; and both of
these were very courteous with him; for they rejoiced in his company,
and especially the chapmen, who were somewhat timorous of the perils of
the road.
