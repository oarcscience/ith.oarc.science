Chapter XLVIII. Sir Godrick Is Chosen Burgreve of the City

But on the third of those four days came a man to Osberne early in the
morning, and told him that the foe were holding the East Gate somewhat
heedlessly, and that they had lost many in those last battles. Wherefore
Osberne looked to it, and gat three hundreds of picked men, and passing
through byways of the streets came to the townward end of the said gate
but a little after sunrise, and without more ado made at the doors of
the gate, which were but half shut. There they drave the few guards in,
and followed on them pell-mell; and to make a long story short, they
presently won the gate utterly with but little loss, and all those
inside, who were scarce three hundreds, slain or taken. Now you may
judge if this were good news for Sir Godrick, when with mickle labour
and not a little loss he had won the town on the east side of the
Sundering Flood.

But now, when they had won so much, they had yet to carry the war into
the west side of the Flood, where was forsooth the chief strength of the
King and the Porte. For there was the King's palace and the great
gildhall, both whereof were buildings defensible, and moreover they had
full command of all the haven and the ships therein, for they had all
the quays and landing-places and warehouses; so that both the sea and
the river was under their wielding. Two bridges, made of great barges
linked together, crossed the Flood, one near to the haven, the other a
good way higher up; nor had the King and his thought it good to break
either of them down. Both had fair and great castles to guard them at
either side.

So now when Sir Godrick and the Council of the Lesser Crafts had met in
divers motes with Osberne and other captains of the Longshaw host, it
yet seemed a great matter that they had to deal with; and that if they
had won many victories, they had yet to win the great one. And all men
saw what would have befallen if the Barons' League had not been so
utterly broken up the year before. But now the greatest gain which Sir
Godrick and the Lesser Crafts had was that they by no means lacked men,
and those of the best; and though they were shut out from chaffer with
the merchants of the City, yet whereas the whole countryside was open to
them because of the riders of Longshaw, they were not like to fall short
of victuals. Though true it is that the King's men set swift keels on
the Sundering Flood stuffed of men-at-arms, and these would land on the
eastern bank so far as a twenty or thirty miles up, and plunder and
ravage the country-folk, or whiles would come upon trains of victuals
and suchlike wending towards the eastern city; and many fierce deeds
they did, which made them no better beloved, so that men got to saying
that the King's men were but little better than the very Skinners
themselves. Moreover, it is not to be said but that often these reivers
and lifters were met by the riders of Longshaw or the weaponed men of
the country-side, and put to the worse by them, and such as were taken
at these times had nought for it save the noose on the tree.

Thus then these two hosts looked across the Sundering Flood on each
other; and surely, unless the Craftsmen had been valiant and stubborn
beyond most, they had lost heart, whereas war was not their mystery.
Skirmishes there were a many. Whiles Sir Godrick would gather such boats
and barges as they had, and thrust over into the haven, and lay hold of
some good ship and strive to have her over to their side. Whiles they
might do nought therein, and whiles they prevailed; but even then the
King's men contrived to set fire aboard the craft and spoil their play.
Again, from time to time the King's men would set certain ships and
barges across the Flood, and strive to land and skirmish on the east
side. But herein they but seldom gained aught, but they in turn would
have their ships burned and their men slain or taken. Thus then it went
on, and now one now the other came to their above; but neither might
make an end of it.

At last, on a day when September was well worn, the King's folk came to
the midmost of the upper bridge with a white shield held aloft and a
herald, and craved safe conduct for three of theirs, an old knight to
wit, and two aldermen of the Porte; this was granted, and they came all
to the North Gate, and the council-chamber of the Lesser Crafts therein.
There they set forth their errand, which was in short that they would
have peace if it might be had on such terms as were better than war and
destruction. The men of the Small Crafts took their errand well, and
asked them how long they might tarry, so that they might bear back
conditions of peace. The messengers said that they were not looked for
back that day, and the others said that by the next day at noon they
would be all ready to send three of theirs back across the water with
the terms of peace. Then were the messengers handed over to the
guest-masters and made much of, and the masters of the Crafts fell to
close council with Sir Godrick and his captains.

Now whatever other terms they bade need not be told, but the heart of
the matter was this: First that so many of the masters of the Small
Crafts should sit on the Great Council of the City, and that enough of
them to make them of due weight in the Council. This they doubted not to
gain since the war had gone with them. But the other was a harder
matter, to wit, that a Burgreve should be appointed to govern the City,
and that he should be of might to hold a good guard, and eke it at his
will and the will of the Great Council; the said Burgreve to be chosen
by all the Gilds of Craft, voting one with another, and not by the Great
Council; which, as things went, would give the naming of him into the
hands of the Lesser Crafts, who were more than the great ones, though
far less rich and mighty. This indeed seemed like to be hard to swallow,
whereas it was much like putting the King out of his place. Yet some
said that belike by this time the Porte was grown mightier than the
King, and if they would have it so, then would he have to give way.
Herein they were doubtless right; but another thing had happened of
which they knew nought, which was driving the King and Porte both toward
peace, to wit that a king from over-sea had sent heralds defying the
King, and that his host was to be looked for in no long while, and the
King and the Porte both knew that they might make no head against him,
so divided as they of the City then were. Wherefore when on the next day
the three King's men bore back the terms of peace, they tarried by a
little while, and came back in two hours with safe conduct for as many
as Sir Godrick and the Small Crafts would send. Whereon Sir Godrick and
two of the Crafts were chosen, and went back across the water
straightway, and without any tarrying fell to council with the King and
the Porte. There they soon found what had befallen, and that their
matter was like to be carried through with a wet finger, for the others
were in hot haste both to make peace and to get the swords of Longshaw
on their side against the Outland men. Nor did they gainsay any one
condition on which the Small Crafts had put forward, but added only this
one thing, that the host of Longshaw should join with them in defending
the City against the Outland men. Hereto Sir Godrick accorded well, for
he had no mind that all his battle for the Small Crafts of the City
should have been of no avail, as it would be if Outlanders were to
conquer the city and play the tyrant there.

The very next day then was peace signed and sealed on the terms
abovesaid. And three days thereafter the Porte and the Crafts went about
the choosing of the Burgreve. As none doubted it would be, Sir Godrick
was chosen, and, which had scarce been looked for, none else was named;
both big crafts and little would have none but he.
