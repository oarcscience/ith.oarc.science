Chapter XL. Osberne Rides with Sir Godrick

Osberne tarried at Eastcheaping for half a month while Sir Godrick was
doing his business, which was, in short, gathering good men for his
fellowship; at the end of that time he had gotten him one score and five
besides Osberne, of whom a half score were well known to Osberne from
the war of Deepdale: and he was fain of them.

At last they departed, and Sir Medard took a kind leave of Osberne. And
Sir Godrick rode oftenest beside the Red Lad and talked much with him.
They had a let-pass through the lands of the Baron of Deepdale, but he
would not suffer Sir Godrick to take any men from his country. So they
came to Deepham, which was the Baron's chief town, in a very fair and
fertile dale, well watered. And there was nought for it but that the
Baron would see the Red Lad, for Sir Godrick must needs speak of him to
the lord; and it must be said that there was now no enmity between the
Baron and Eastcheaping. So the Baron feasted them well amongst his folk
in his great hall; and when he saw Osberne he knew him, and had been
told as aforesaid that the Red Lad had been at the carrying him away
from the midst of his warriors; but the Baron hailed him merrily, and
cried out to Sir Godrick: "Sir Knight, if thou wouldst have any
man-stealing done thou art in the luck of it, for this youngling is a
past-master in the craft." And before the feast was over, he sent for
Osberne to talk to him, and asked many things concerning the war as
Osberne saw it from his side; and he showed that he owed him no grudge
for the stealing, for he gave Osberne gifts, a fair gown of crimson
cloth of gold, and a ruby ring. So all went well: nevertheless Osberne
was nought loth to leave Deepham, and thought it not ill that his life
lay not overnigh to the lord thereof.

Now when they had left the lands of Deepdale they turned away toward the
south, and rode two days through a fair country and peaceful, of much
tillage, besprinkled with goodly thorps, where they had entertainment
for their money and none seemed to fear them; and there they saw no
men-at-arms, and but few carles that bore any weapons save whittle or
boar-spear. At the end of that land they came to a good town walled and
warded; and there none hindered them, for the Knight had acquaintance
with the captain of the Porte, who had gathered him a half dozen of
stout carles, and there they rested three days. Thence they rode one day
amidst the same fair country, and they entered a forest through which
was a way which led them a little west of south. The said forest gave
out in three days, and then they came into a wide valley watered by a
fair river running due west. The said valley was more for pasture than
tillage, so that it was not thickly housed, albeit when they had crossed
the river they came on to a big stead of many houses (and it was
evening) much peopled, and the folk, who had seen their riding, were
standing with weapons outside the houses.

But when Sir Godrick had ridden forward alone and given out his name and
errand, to wit, that he was riding to Longshaw with some good fellows
who were fain to be of his folk, they all cried out a fair welcome to
him and his; for they knew of his deeds and his fame, and were
well-willers to him, and were fain of seeing him this first time. Then
stood forth an old long-hoary man, but tall and stark, and gave himself
out for the master of the stead, which hight Riverlease, and he named
him David and said: "Sir Knight, I am father of ten of these men and the
grandsire of one score and five, and other good fellows I have with me
to the tale of ten score and ten, and all these thou wilt make merry by
thy presence here tonight."

So he brought the Knight and his into the hall, and fair greeting he
gave them; and to Osberne, though the land were other and the houses far
bigger, for this David was as it were a king of the meadows, it was
almost as if he were back at Wethermel, so yeomanly and free seemed all
about him. And the folk were a fair folk, the women goodly and the men
free and bold. So all men were merry and thought but little of the
morrow. But ere the feast was over the old David spake to the good
Knight and said: "Sir Godrick, meseems thou shalt have many a foeman on
thy back these coming seasons, wherefore if any of my grandsons or the
swains here have a longing to ride with thee and become thy men, I will
spare them to the number of a half score. How say ye lads," cried he
down the hall, "be there any here who desire to see how the Lord of
Longshaw arrayeth his battles, and would bring back some fair stories to
the maidens' ears?"

Now it was soon seen that no few there were that would be fain to ride
with the Knight, who soon had his choice of ten tall men, stout, and
deft in weapons, and the end of the feast was merrier than the
beginning.

Next morning they were away early, and the old man led them out over his
meadows, which were exceeding rich of neat and sheep; and at parting he
said: "Fair Knight of Longshaw, I have gone as far as I may this day,
and must turn again; but this I say to thee, If ever the world goes
amiss with thee, as it yet may for all thy valiancy, or forsooth because
of it, come hither to me, or if I be dead, to my sons and my grandsons,
and abide here as merrily as thou mayst. And spare not to bring whomso
of thine thou wilt, as maybe this goodly youngling here," laying his
hand on Osberne's shoulder, "of whom some of thy men were telling tales
to some of mine last night. And now I bid farewell to thee and thine."

So Sir Godrick and his went their ways, and the new fellows led them by
the shortest road, when they knew whither Sir Godrick will to wend. And
when they were out of that valley they came up on to the down-country,
which ran along the edge of the plain like a wall; and thereby they went
due south for three days, seeing but few folk and no houses, save here
and there the cot of a shepherd, and that often builded on a wain. The
three days ended, they come on a dale in the downs where a little river
cleft them, running about south-west, and by the rede of their
shepherd-fellows they turned and followed it out of the down-country,
and were presently in a land of mingled tillage and pasture, well
builded, but more with single homesteads than thorps, though these were
not lacking: albeit the folk of them were not very free with their
guesting, but yet for money, and as if half compelled, they yielded up
such good as the riders would have of them. The next day, riding the
samelike country, they saw on a bent a fair town with white walls, and
many goodly gables and slim spires rising above them. But when they drew
nigh thereto, an hour before sunset, they found that the said walls were
of other uses than to be looked at, to wit to keep them out of their
night's lodging; for the gates were shut, and there were spears and
basnets glittering over the battlements. So Sir Godrick rode forward
toward the gate, taking Osberne and a trumpet with him, and there bade
blow a point of peace and crave speech of the captain of the guard.

Then stood up a tall man on the gate, armed at all points in white
armour, and by him were two or three men-at-arms and one with a
cross-bow ready bent. Cried out the tall man: "Go ye, trumpet and all,
and let us see the last of you! For we know you, outlaws of Longshaw.
The better luck for you if we come not to your house speedily. Go ye,
make ready for us!" Sir Godrick burst out a-laughing and turned his
horses head; but even therewith Osberne, who was exceeding keen-sighted,
saw the cross-bowman raise his engine; but the Red Lad had his
dwarf-wrought bow bended in his hand, so that ere the cross-bow stock
came to the man's shoulder he fell clattering down with a shaft through
his throat, and Osberne rode back speedily after his lord with a half
dozen shafts and quarrels whistling about him, but none touched him, and
great was the cry and yell that came from the town gate.

Now when Osberne was with his captain again, that one spake to him and
said: "Red Lad, Red Lad, a sharp shaft is somewhat of a fierce answer to
a rough word. Next time let them shoot ere ye shoot."

"Nay, lord," said Osberne, "had I waited this time thou might'st have
come by a knock from yonder carle's quarrel." And he told him what he
had seen. Then said Sir Godrick: "Then I am wrong and thou right, and I
thank thee for the shaft. I might have known that thou wouldst be wise."

So they fetched a compass about that surly town, and rode a two hours
ere they took harbour in a little wood, and held good watch and ward all
that night. But none meddled with them.

The day after, by the rede of the shepherd-folk, they turned up into the
hills again, for they had no wish to raise the country against them; and
to say sooth, Sir Godrick was somewhat pensive that he found enmity so
far off his own land. So they rode the hills for five days, falling in
with few folk, and going slowly because of the rough ways. Thereafter
they needed victual, and had been fain of better lodging might they get
it; and whereas they saw a fair plain well builded and tilled, with good
roads through the same, and knew that this was the nighest way to the
Wood Masterless, they turned down thither at all adventure, and found no
evil haps there, but that the folk were well enough pleased to make
their market of the riders, and had neither fear of them nor harboured
enmity against them. Thus then they rode for two days, and at the end of
the second day entered a good cheaping-town, unfenced save by timber
pales. There they abode a whole day, yet warily, since, though there
were not waged men-at-arms in the stead, there went about many stout
carles, who all bore long whittles, and looked as if their bills and
bows had not been far to seek. But no strife betid.
