Chapter XVII. The Slaying of Hardcastle

So they three went down together into the meadow, and there stood the
others by the hazel-garth: the goodman cowering and abject, Surly John
pale and anxious, and the two women clinging together in sore sorrow,
the grandam weeping sorely. But as they passed close by these last,
Stephen touched the grandam and said to her: "Sawest thou ever King
David the little?" "Nay," she said sobbing. "Look thou into the
hazel-garth presently then," said he, "and thou shalt see him with eye."

So now they two stood in the hazelled field; it was two hours before
noon, the sky was overcast with a promise of the first snow of the
winter, but as yet none had fallen, and the field was dry and hard. Now
Hardcastle has Fiddlebow bare in his fist, but Osberne takes
Boardcleaver from his girdle and unwinds the peace-strings; then he
stands still for a moment and looks toward his foeman, who cries out at
him: "Haste thee, lad, I were fain done with it." Then Osberne draws
forth the blade, and it made a gleam of white in the grey day, and as
the folk say who stood thereby, as Boardcleaver came forth bare there
came a great humming sound all about. Then Osberne gets his shield on
his arm, and cries out: "Now thou warrior!" and straightway Hardcastle
comes leaping toward him, and Osberne abode him as he came on with
uplifted sword, leapt lightly  to one side, and thrust forth
Boardcleaver and touched his side, so that all could see the blade had
drunk a little blood. Fiercely and fast turned Hardcastle about on the
lad, but therewith was he within the ruffler's stroke, and
Boardcleaver's point was steady before Osberne's breast, and met
Hardcastle's side and made a great wound with the point, and the warrior
staggered back, and his sword-point was lowered. Then cried out Osberne:
"What! Thou wouldst unbreech me, wouldst thou? But now art thou
unbreeched." For therewith Boardcleaver swept round backhanded and came
back as swift as lightning, and the edge clave all the right flank and
buttock of him, so that the blood ran freely; and then as Hardcastle,
still staggering, hove up his sword wildly, Osberne put the slant stroke
aside with his shield and thrust forth Boardcleaver right at his breast,
and the point went in, and the whole blade, as there were nought but
dough before it, and Hardcastle, nigh rent in two, fell aback off the
sword.

Osberne stood still a while looking on him, but Stephen ran up and knelt
beside him, and felt his wrist and laid his hand on the breast, and then
turned and looked up at Osberne, who knelt down beside him also and
wiped the blood off Boardcleaver with a lap of the dead man's coat. Then
he stood up and thrust the blade back into the sheath, and wound the
peace-strings about it all. Then came the word into his mouth, and he
sang:

    Came sword and shield  
    To the hazelled field  
    Where the fey man fell  
    At Wethermel:  
    The grey blade grew glad  
    In the hands of a lad,  
    And the tall man and stark  
    Leapt into the dark.  
  For the cleaver of war-boards came forth from his door  
  And guided the hand of the lacking in lore.6p    But now is the
blade  
    In the dark sheath laid,  
    And the peace-strings lull  
    His heart o'erfull.  
    Up dale and down  
    The hall-roofs brown  
    Hang over the peace  
    Of the year's increase.  
  No fear rendeth midnight and dieth the day  
  With no foe save the winter that weareth away.

Then he cried out: "Draw nigh, goodman and grandsire, and take again the
house and lands of Wethermel, as ye had them aforetime before yesterday
was a day." So the goodman came to him and kissed him and thanked him
kind and humbly, and the women came and embraced him and hung about him.
As for Surly John, he had slunk away so soon as he saw the fall of his
master, and now when they looked around for him, they saw him but as a
fleck going swiftly down the Dale. Thereat they all laughed together,
and the laughter eased their hearts, so that they felt free and happy.

"Now," said Stephen, "what shall we do with this carcass, that was so
fierce and fell this morning?" Said Osberne: "We shall lay him in earth
here in his raiment as he fell, since he died in manly wise, though
belike he has lived as a beast. But his sword I will give to thee in
reward for thy trusty following both now and at other times."

So Stephen fetched mattock and pick, and dug a grave for that champion
amidwards of the hazel-garth, and there they laid him, and heaped up
mould and stones over his grave; and to this day it is called
Hardcastle's Howe there, or for short, and that the oftenest,
Hardcastle.

So they went all of them up to the house, and were merry and joyful.
