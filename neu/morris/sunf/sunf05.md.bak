Chapter III. Wolves Harry the Flock

Now these matters, and other strayings and misdoings of the youngling,
befel before the time whereof I now tell, when he was, as aforesaid,
passed of twelve years; and it was in latter autumn, when the nights are
lengthening. At this time there was a hired man dwelling with them,
whose work it was to drive the sheep afield, either up on to the eastern
bents or away off down to the water, so as they might not eat the grass
of the kine from them. But Osberne, both of his own will and at the
bidding of the goodman, went off afield with this man John and helped
him to keep the sheep from straying over-far. Now one day at evening,
somewhat later than he was wont, when, as it chanced, Osberne had not
fared with him, back comes John from the bents, and he looked scared and
pale, and he tells the tale that as the light began to fail up there,
three huge wolves fell upon the sheep, and slew sundry of them, and it
was easy to be seen of him that he had held no very close battle with
the wolves, but had stood aloof till they had done their supper, and
then gathered what he could of the sheep without going over-near the
field of deed. The goodman berated him for his cowardice, and seemed to
begrudge him his victuals somewhat that night, whereas, what with them
who the wolves had slain, and them who had perchance fled away, the
flock was seventeen wethers short. John excused himself what he might,
and said that he had no weapon, nought save his shepherd's staff, and
that the wolves had slain his dog in the first stour: but while he
spake, Osberne, who sat by, deemed him somewhat stark and tall to be so
little-hearted.

However, the next day the goodman and John must needs go up to the bent
to see if they might find aught alive of the sheep that were missing,
and each of them bore a shield and short spear, that they might make
head against the wolves if that host should fall on them in the middle
of the \[day\]. Meantime Osberne, by the goodman's bidding, drives the
flock down toward the water, nothing loth, for ever the wondrous stream
seemed to draw the lad to it. And a fair day he had of it, wandering
amidst the sheep and being friendly with them, whiles drawing out his
knife to look thereon, as oft he did when he was alone; and forsooth it
was a goodly weapon, carven with quaintnesses about the heft, the blade
inlaid with runes done in gold, and the sheath of silver. Whiles also he
stood on the river's lip and looked across the water which was there in
most places as big as the Thames is at Reading, but sometimes narrower.
But there was nought stirring within eyeshot on the further bank that
day, save the fowl, and a bull that came running along and lowing as he
went on some errand, whatever it might be, for he was not followed of
any men. So he came back with the flock before dark all safe; neither
had he gone far from the stead, for so he was bidden of by his
grandsire.

A little after comes in the goodman with John, neither of them in very
sweet temper; they had seen nought of the sheep save the hide and bones
of a half score, but the wolves they had not failed to see; they had
come to the same place as the last night, and seemed by no means afraid
of the man-host with its spears and shields, wherefore these last had
turned their backs and run from them stoutly, and now sat together
glowering on each other, and casting now and again a gibe each at each.
But they were at one in this, that the wolves were huge and fierce
beyond measure, and such as any man might fear. But at last John spake
and said: "Well, master, it is as they say down the Dale, that this no
lucky house; meseems ye are beset with no common wolves, but with
skin-changers who have taken the shape of wolves, whether they be
Land-wights or Dwarfs, or ride-a-nights of the outlaws."

At that word waxed the master wood-wrath, as was his wont if any spake
of the luck of Wethermel; and he forgot his fear in his anger, and said:
"Hearken the fool-talk of him! Thou hadst not the heart for all thine
inches to go forward before thy master, and a man on the downward side
of years; and now thou must needs make up fairy tales to cover they
cowardice." Said John, grinning, "Keep thy head, master; for sooth it is
that thou wert the first to run, and wert the first through the door."

"Thou liest," said the goodman; "but this I tell thee, that whosoever
was afraid then, thou shalt be afraid now." And he rose up and smote his
man upon the face so that he fell to the ground, and John leapt up and
would have smitten his master again; but even therewith comes in the
goodwife, and Bridget with her, bearing in the supper smoking hot, and
something seemed to hold John back from his blow, and he sat down, surly
enough but silent. Then said the goodwife: "What is to do here? Hast
thou run against the settle-end, John, that thy cheek is red and blue?"

Laughed the youngling thereat, and a word came into his mouth, and he
sang:

    All grey on the bent  
    There the sheep-greedy went:  
    The big spear and shield  
    Met the foes of the field,  
    But nought the white teeth  
    In the warriors gat sheath,  
    For master and man  
    Full meetly they ran.  
    But now in this hall  
    The fear off doth fall  
    From one of the twain,  
    And his hand getteth gain,  
    But the other sits there,  
    And new groweth his fear  
    Both of man and of grey.  
    So the meat on board lay,  
    Thou on whom gold doth ride,  
    Meat-goddess grey-eyed,  
    Let the loaf-warden eat,  
    And the man whom he beat,  
    And the lad that doth lie  
    In wall-nook hereby,  
    And thou Gold-tree the fair,  
    And the milk-mother dear,  
    Lest the meat wax a-cold  
    Both for bold and unbold.

Hereat all laughed, but the two men somewhat from one side of their
mouths. And the goodman said: "See thou to it, kinsman, lest stripes be
thy song-pay." But Osberne laughed from a fair and merry face and sang
again:

    O lord of the land,  
    To the staff lay no hand  
    Till the grey ones thou face  
    In the wind-weary place.

And therewith he fell to his meat and ate stoutly, and to the women it
seemed that their little kinsman had the makings of a champion in him,
and his staves they loved dearly in their hearts, and they smiled upon
him kindly; and he looked from one to the other and quoth he:

    Three mothers had I,  
    And one is gone by,  
    But two are left here,  
    Leal, buxom, and dear.

As for the goodman, now that the meat was getting into him, the wrath
was running off, and he thought within himself that presently he should
have good avail of his grandson.
