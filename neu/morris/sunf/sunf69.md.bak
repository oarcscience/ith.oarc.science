Chapter LXVII. A Friend at Need

It was some three years after this that weaponed men came down into the
Dale. It was told to Osberne, and he took his sword and went to meet
them. He came across them as they fared slowly down the bent, looking
weary and fordone. He looked at them, and he saw that there was nothing
for it but that the chiefest of them, and there were but three, was the
Knight of Longshaw. So he ran up to him, and cast his arms about him,
and kissed him, and asked him what ailed. And the Knight said, and
laughed withal: "That has befallen me which befals most men: I have been
overcome, and I believe that my foes are hard on my heels."

"Will they be a many?" said Osberne. "Not in this first stour," said the
Knight. "Well," said Osberne, "I will go and look to it to get a few men
together to show them out of the Dale." So he turned hand in hand with
the Knight of Longshaw, and cried out to Stephen the Eater to gather
forth; and in an hour or so they had enough men and to spare. By that
time the pursuers came glittering over the bent, so Osberne and his
gathered themselves together and stood till the others came. And when
they were within hail, Osberne asked: "What would ye here in arms? We
are peaceable men." Said the pursuers: "We have nought to do with you,
but we would have the body of a felon and a traitor hight the Knight of
Longshaw."

Osberne laughed and said: "Here he stands beside me; come and take him!"
And the foe were some three score, all a-horseback. So they fell on
without more words; but they made nothing of it, and the Wethermelers
kept them aloof with spear and bill. Albeit Osberne did not draw his
sword, nor did the Knight of Longshaw.

Then the foemen held off a little, and they said: "Hark ye, ye
up-countrymen, if ye do not give up this man, then will we burn your
house to the threshold."

"Yea," said Osberne, "ye have all day long to do it in, make no delay
therefore. Or did ye ever hear who I am?" And they said: "Nay, we know
not." Then he let his red cloak float over him and let his byrny show
glittering, and he drew Boardcleaver and suddenly cried out, "The Red
Lad! The Red Lad!" and all the others did in like wise. Then the foemen
fled up the bent. And Osberne said: "Lightfoot men of Wethermel, here is
a job for you: let not one of these men escape from out of the Dale." So
they fell to, and hard they worked at it, and so they wrought that they
slew them every one.

Then Osberne went back to the Knight of Longshaw and said: "See, master,
it is still a name to conjure with. And now what wilt thou do? Wilt thou
gather men in the Dale here? We can find thee a ten score or thereabout
of as good men as need be."

"Nay," said the Knight, "I will not have them, for meseems I am getting
towards the end of my tether, and I will not carry away your good men
and true from your wives and your children." So therewith they went into
the stead and were joyful together.
