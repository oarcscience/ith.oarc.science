Chapter LIII. Strangers Come to Wethermel

Now turns the tale to Wethermel, and tells how that on the morrow of
Midsummer, five years to the day since Osberne had bidden them farewell,
the folk once more sat without-doors about the porch in the cool of the
evening; neither was there any missing of the settled folk of those to
whom he had said farewell. For all had thriven there that while. There
sat the goodman, more chieftain-like than of old; there sat the
goodwife, as kind as ever, and scarce could she be kinder; there sat
Bridget, not much aged in the five years; for ever she deemed it a
certain thing that her nursling would come back to her. Lastly, there
sat Stephen the Eater, wise of aspect and thoughtful, as if he were
awaiting something that should happen which should change much in him;
and there were the carles and the queans (with some few children amongst
them who had not been there five years ago) who had been familiar to
Osberne ere he left the Dale for warfare. It was growing late now, and
the twilight was creeping up under a cloudless sky, when those folk saw
newcomers wending the lane betwixt the outbowers, and making straight
for the house-porch. They were but three, and as they drew nigh it could
be seen that they were hooded and cloaked despite the warm night; and
one was tall and seemed a stalwarth man, and another was jimp and went
daintily, as if it were a young woman, and the third, who forsooth had
her face but little hidden, seemed a carline of some three score years
and ten.

None of the folk stirred save Stephen the Eater, who rose up as if to
welcome the guests; and the tall man spake in a strange high voice that
seemed as if it came from the back of his head: "May we three wayfarers
be here tonight? For we saw this stead from afar, and it seemed a
plenteous house, and we deem it guest-kind." Quoth Stephen: "A free and
fair welcome to you; ye shall eat of our dish, and drink of our cup, and
lie as the best of us do. Ho, ye folk! now were we best within doors;
for our guests shall be both weary and hungry belike."

So into the hall they wended, and the three were shown to a good place
amidmost thereof, so that all might see them; and there they sat, the
tall man innnermost, nighest to the dais, the young woman by him and the
carline outermost. Then came in the meat, which was both plenteous and
good, and when all were fulfilled the drink was brought in, and the tall
man arose and called a health on Wethermel, and that it might thrive
ever. But some men thought that, as he lifted his hand to put the cup to
his lips, a gleam of something bright came from under his wayfarer's
cloak. And Stephen the Eater called a health on the wayfarers; and then
one drank to one thing, one to another, and men waxed merry and gleeful.

But at last rose up Stephen the Eater and spake: "Meat and drink and
lodging is free without price to every comer to Wethermel, and most oft,
as here it is, our good will goes with it; yet meseemeth that since
these friends of ours come belike from the outlands and countries where
is more tidings than mostly befalleth here, it might please them to make
us their debtors by saying us some lay, or telling us some tale; for we
be not bustled to drink the voidee cup now, these nights of Midsummer,
when night and day hold each other's hands throughout the twenty-four
hours."

Then rose up the tall, high-voiced man and said: "It is my will that
each one of we three should say something, be it long or short, to make
the folk of Wethermel glad. For they have treated us wayfarers as though
we were lords and kings, and their words go to their hearts. Now I will
that thou, mother, begin, and that I make an end of this saying."

Then he sat down, and the carline said: "I am all the more willing to
this, as meseemeth I can tell you a tale such as ye have never heard the
like of, and which will move every heart of you. And yet I must pray
your patience, as belike it may be somewhat long for a tale of one
night's hall-glee: and on this night must the tale be begun and ended.
Hearken then!"
