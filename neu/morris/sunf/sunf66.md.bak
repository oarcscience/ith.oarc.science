Chapter LXIV. The Carline Endeth Her Tale

When they arose on the morrow they began to think of departure, though
they would have kept them in that guest-house for many days; but both of
the twain, and especially the Maiden, deemed that, if they might, they
should be drawing nigh to that dwelling of the good Knight who had
overthrown the League of the Barons; and they both deemed that
thereabout, if anywhere, they should have tidings, even had they long to
wait for them, of that new champion whom the wise Knight had gotten.

Now then the Carline did wisely, and she got to see he steward, and fell
to talk with him, and did him to wit that, for all the simplicity of
their raiment, they had both the will and the might to make a fair
oblation to the Saint; and she took from the aforesaid necklace two
sapphires and two emeralds, all great and very fair, and the steward's
eyes danced in the head of him at the sight, and he said: "This is a
fair gift indeed, and if ye will come with me into the church I will
show you to the Sub-prior, and if ye have any honest desire, as is like,
since ye have such love of Holy Church, he and I between us will help
you therein. And if not, nought is your time wasted in seeing our
church, which is of itself worth a long journey to behold."

So they went, well pleased, and when they were in the church they found
that he had said nought but the sooth: so many pillars there were
reaching up and toward the sky, so nobly wide it was, and as long as it
should be. And there were many altars therein, all as well furnished as
might be done; and long had it taken any lettered man to have told up
the number of histories on the walls and in the windows, wherein they
were all as if done with gemstones; and everywhere the fair stories told
as if they were verily alive, and as if they who did them had seen them
going on on the earth and in the heavens. So the two waited there
ravished while the steward went to fetch the Sub-prior, and brought him
presently, a kind and holy man, and humble of demeanour.

He spake to them and said: "My daughters, it is told me that ye need
somewhat of our house in all honesty and holiness; now when ye have laid
your gift on the altar, if ye will come with me and our steward here to
the parlour, I will hearken to all ye have to say, and if the thing ye
need of us can be done, done it shall be." They thanked him humbly and
went and made their oblation, and prayed, and the Sub-prior blessed
them, and brought them out of the church into the parlour, and there
they sat down together.

Then the Carline opened her budget, and told how they two had suffered
from war and rapine, and when they had been delivered from a foul
caitiff by a good Knight who had cherished them with all honours in his
house, and all went well a while, it endured not long, for needs must he
go to the wars, and there was he slain: how they, to escape the malice
of the mother of the said Knight, who was a proud and hard woman, and
now that her son was dead neither loved nor feared aught, must needs
flee away. "But withal," said the Carline, "even had that good and kind
Knight lived and come back to us, needs must we have left his house, and
his kindness ere long. For this I must do you to wit," says she, "that
we deem we have a weird and a fortune abiding us, and that through all
trouble we shall be brought thereto in the end, and that the said
Knight's house of Brookside was over-far from it. This therefore we ask
of you, since ye have shown such kindness unto us as the man of Samaria
to him who fell amongst thieves."

The Sub-prior smiled at her word and said: "Well, dame, neither the
priest nor the Levite pass by the poor souls."

"Father," she said, "thou and thy house, are ye foes or friends to the
Knight of Longshaw?"

The Sub-prior smiled: "Friends forsooth," said he, "so far as we may do
him any good; but ye wot that we give him no carnal help with sword and
spear, yea and little indeed might we give were we temporal lords, so
far off as we be from Longshaw, and the river and the Wood Masterless
lying all between us. And now indeed we begin to deem that the good
Knight may yet come to his above, though ere he had given the Barons'
League that great overthrow things seemed much going awry with him.
Moreover we have heard of a new champion whom he hath gotten, and who
counted for much in that battle with the Barons, and well-nigh as wise
in war is he as the Knight himself, say men. But now, my daughters, what
would ye with the Knight of Longshaw?"

With that the Maiden took up the word, blushing red like a rose, and she
said: "With the Knight of Longshaw it is perhaps little that we have to
do, although we wish him all good, but it is rather with that one of
whom ye have heard tell that he is a new-come champion of the Knight's."
The Sub-prior smiled withal and said: "But what have ye to do with this
champion?"

The Maiden blushed no longer, but said: "I will tell you the story in as
short a way as it may be told: I was a damsel living much all alone by
the side of a terrible river, not lightly to be crossed, or indeed not
at all. And on the other side of the said river was there a bold lad of
about my years, and we fell into converse, speaking together very
sweetly each from our own side of the water. And for a long time this
seemed a no such evil fate for the two of us to endure; but time went
on, and I grew into a woman and he grew into a man, and indeed as bold a
champion as there is in our parts; and then indeed it seemed hard that,
though we should meet in speech, yet never should mouth meet mouth or
hand meet hand. But we lived on in hope, and trusted to what weird had
wrought for us. And it seemed possibly not so unlike but that this bold
and eager champion might go wide in the world, and somehow find out the
country and the side of the river on which I was born and bred. And in
the meantime was I determined above all things never to think of anyone
else but this bold and beautiful champion, and even so it is with me
now. And this good dame here, who is my very fostermother, and is
somewhat wise, though I would hope not more so than Holy Church
alloweth, has always bidden me to hope to see my champion again, and
even so I do. And we both know that it is only amongst the Knight of
Longshaw and his men that he is to be found."

Quoth the Sub-prior: "And when he was found, and ye let him know where
ye are, will he come to you, think ye?"

"Even so we believe," said the Maiden. "Well," said the Sub-prior. "tell
me what ye would have, and it shall be done for you." Said the Carline:
"We would \[come across the water and\] have guide and guards through
the Wood Masterless to some place where we may dwell alone. Can ye do
this much for us? And we shall be well willing to pay with suchlike gems
as ye have already seen of ours for such a small house."

"Well," said the Sub-prior, "that may well be, and tomorrow morn, if ye
will take the whole thing on your own heads, I will send you \[down to
the ferry that lieth betwixt us and a House of Friars on the further
side of the water. At a writing from us these good brothers may find you
some such dwelling in the Wood Masterless as ye seek, and will furnish
you with way-beasts and guides thereto.\] But I leave it to you,
Carline, whether ye do not risk greatly to take such a pearl with you
into the place which is peopled by the worst of men." Said the Carline:
"To tell you the truth, Father, I have pieces of wisdom by which I can
blind the eyes of foolish men, so that they will see nothing of the
delicate beauty of my daughter here." "Well," said the Sub-prior, and
smiled.

So the very next morning it was as the Sub-prior said. \[Two
lay-brothers brought them down to the water-side, and at parting gave a
writing into the hand of the Carline. And when they were safely over the
mighty Flood, and landed on a pleasant strand where the water was
shallow and the current none so swift, the ferryman spoke a word of them
to one of the brotherhood who had stood watching the crossing of that
boat. With a friendly greeting he turned and led the way to the Friary,
a fair stone building, set with a wall both high and long. Here met the
Carline and the Maiden with a kindly welcome, and were set in the
guest-house to rest that night. And, said the good brothers, their
matter might be seen to, and they would send them on through the Wood
Masterless; and that there was such a house as the Carline would have,
which is in a good case, said they, though it may want here and there a
nail or a plank.

And in the morning two of the brothers were bidden\] array themselves
and take sumpter-horses and good horses for the women, and to lead them
to within such distance of the Castle and Longshaw as might seem good to
the Carline, and that forsooth was but some dozen miles.

There then they rested; and from time to time the Carline would go on
her errands, and would see folk who would give her tidings of how things
went in the world. And ever she found that the tale was the same. For
the Lord of Longshaw might not stretch out a hand without thriving; and
ever with him at council, or at privy talk, or in the front of the
battle, was this marvellous champion, whom it availed nought for any man
to gainsay. At last the time began to seem long for the Maiden; and the
Carline from time to time, when she did not know that she was nigh,
heard her bewailing that her man came not, and she heard her say one
day: If he come not before long, then will be perished some deal of that
delicate beauty which I would above all things deliver into his keeping,
so that he may know that it was no mere shadow of a woman with whom he
gave and took in talk on the other side of the Sundering Flood. And in
very sooth she began to peak and pine, and the Carline took her to task
therefor, and said that she herself would try to set this right. Till on
a day the Carline knew for sure that the champion had now turned his
head from all his valiances, and was thinking of nothing but of how he
might come across her with whom he had such merry days on the other side
of the Great Water.

Short it is that is left to tell. The Carline knew of a certainty that
he had been smitten in felony and grievously hurt, and that he had been
carried to an hermitage and there healed; therefore she waylaid him on a
time and brought him to the house wherein they dwelt. And there, whether
it were by her planning or by mere chance-hap may scarce be told, but
such a thing befel that the wrath of the champion blazed out in him, so
that for some few minutes he might scarce tell what was before him. And
then it was all over, and they two were sealed for one another for what
yet abided them on the earth.

Now this is my tale, and belike it has been somewhat overlong, and
therefore it scarce needs that ye bid this damsel tell a tale for her
part, which were indeed better told by her casting to earth her grey
cloak and showing her body fairly dight. For, indeed, this damsel
belongeth to one who is your kinsman and dear friend: and seemly will
she think it that she show her body so dight that it shall lack no
fairness before you.
