Chapter LVIII. Peaceful Days in the Castle of Brookside

Now the Knight led the Maiden up to the dais, and thereon were squires
and priests and ladies; for Sir Mark's mother was there, sitting on a
very goodly chair beside his seat of honour, and when these two came on
to the dais the said lady stood up to meet them, and put her arms about
the knight's neck and kissed him. Then she turned to the Maiden and
said: "Thou also art welcome, and thy follower the old woman, since my
son hath bidden you to the house which is his own. But look to it that
thou be obedient to him, and take more heed of his honour and his
welfare than thine own welfare. Then shall I give thee what honour thou
art worthy of, and thou shalt find in me a well-willer."

So the Maiden knelt before her and kissed her hand, but the Lady looked
no more on her, but on her son. She was a tall and goodly woman of some
five and fifty winters; hawk-nosed and hawk-eyed, dark-haired, and her
hair waved as the coat-armour of the house. She spoke in no very soft or
kind voice, not even to her son, and the Maiden had feared her that
while, had it not been that even therewith her heart turned toward the
man she loved and whom she sought, and all these that were round about
her, even the valiant and generous Knight, had become for the time to
her but images that had no part in her life.

But now the tire-woman came to her and led her into a chamber apart, and
bathed her and clad her in fair raiment and led her back to the hall,
for so had the Blue Knight commanded.

As for the Carline, she was shown to a good place, and sat there
heedfully, and had ears for everything that was said and eyes for all
that was done. And she said to herself that they should not abide there
very long ere she would find out something of the way her bird must
follow if she were to have a happy life thenceforth.

But the next morning the Lady-mother took her son into a window of the
hall and fell to talking with him. And the Carline was not far off, and
heard a good part of all that they said: for she was fine-eared, and had
brought lore to bear upon the hearkening.

Now spake the Lady: "Well, son, so thou hast brought home a woman of the
husbandmen, a churl's daughter, to dwell with us. What wilt thou do with
her? Wilt thou wed her with priest and ring?" "Nay, mother," said Sir
Mark; "but thou needest not call her of churl's blood. I wot of these
folk of the dales under the mountains, that they are both proud and
warrior-like, as if they were earls' kindred." "Is it so?" said the
Lady; "But she is neither of the baronage nor the knighthood. I say,
wilt thou wed her?" "I shall not," said Sir Mark, reddening and knitting
his brows. "What wilt thou do with her then?" said the Lady. Said he:
"She shall abide here in all honour and kindness so long as she will."
"Even such shall she have from me then," said the Lady, "since it is thy
will, so long as thy will is steadfast herein; but when it changes, then
must we seek other rede." So the talk between them dropped for that
time.

Here then began new days for the Maiden, nor is it to be said that there
was aught evil in them, save the abiding on hope deferred; for there was
none in the house that looked not kindly on this lovely one, save it
were the Lady, the mother of Sir Mark. But then, to say sooth, she
looked not kindly on any, scarce even on her son, though in her heart
she loved him strongly. And no wrong she did to the Maiden, or put any
tasks upon her, nor said nor did aught covertly to make her heart bleed,
as belike she might have done had she willed it. The two young squires,
Roland and James, did all they might to be with her and have speech of
her, and she suffered them frankly, seeing no harm therein. For to her
they were but bright and fair youths whose lives had nought to do with
hers, but who should find friends and loves and deeds with other folk
whom she had never heard of, and in lands far away from the grey Dale
where she was born and bred.

As to Sir Mark, it was somewhat different, for such thanks she owed him
for her deliverance and for his kindness that never wore thin, and for
the faithful love that looked for no reward, nay not even for pity of
the love, for ever he bore him frank and merry, and had such kind
good-will to all folk worthy who were about him, that none had deemed of
him but that was heart-whole, and bore about no pain that fretted his
life. So much she owed him, I say, yea and was glad to owe him, and so
fain she was to hear and see this friend, that scarce might she think of
her life on the earth and he not a part of it in some way.

So wore the spring and summer, and all seemed at peace about Brookside:
and many merry days did the Maiden and the Carline share in, as riding
in the meadows and woods with hawk and hound, and feasts in the fair
land further aloof; and the Midsummer and Michaelmas markets, which were
held in the meadow betwixt the Castle and the township of Brookside; and
a riding more than two or three to the cheaping-town of that
country-side, which was some five leagues distant and was a good and
plenteous town. Withal a many folk came a-guesting to the Castle,
knowing it to be a guest-kind house, as pilgrims and chapmen, and
knights and men-at-arms riding hither and thither on their errands, so
that it was no unlikely place to hear tidings of the countries and
kingdoms.
