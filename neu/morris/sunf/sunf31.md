Chapter XXIX. Osberne and His Men Return to Wethermel

Now on a fair evening a little ere sunset of the beginning of October,
came those Dalesmen amongst the black rocks and rough places that
crowned the bent which looked down west over the Dale. And now, though
they had been talking merrily and loud for the last three hours, their
hearts were so full within them that scarce a word might they say one to
another. And when at last they had won through that rocky tangle and had
opened Wethermel, and nought lay before them but the grassy slopes and
the wide-spread valley cleft by the line of the Sundering Flood; now,
when they saw in the clear air the grey houses of Wethermel lying
together, and the smoke of the evening cooking fires going up to the
heavens, and the sheep wending on, thick and huddling before the driving
of three tall men, and the kine moving toward the byre and the women
amongst them, then this befel: that whereas they had been all of one
mind that when they came to the crown of the bent, they would spur on
and race merrily toward Wethermel, yet now when it lay before them, and
there was so little a way betwixt them and its hearth, they all of them
with one consent drew rein and sat still on their horses, as if they had
suddenly come face to face with the host of the foemen. Yea, some there
were, and they rather of the oldest than the youngest, who might not
refrain them, but fell a-weeping and sobbing, whether it were for joy or
sorrow, or a blending of both, may scarce be said.

Osberne wept not: sooth to say, the turmoil of hope and fear within his
heart ate up somewhat the softness that might else have mastered him at
this new sight of his fathers' house. He rode forth before the others,
and lifted up his voice and loudly and clearly cried a blessing on the
Dale and the dwellers therein, and then rode soberly down the bent, and
the others followed him still silently. But when they were drawn anigh,
and every soul, man, woman and child, ran forth from the garth to meet
and welcome them, then at last their joy brake forth, and they gat off
their horses and gave themselves up to the caresses of the women and the
embracing of the carles, and loud was the speech and the laughter
amongst them.

Osberne was first met by Nicholas his grandsire, who kissed and embraced
him, and then gave him up to his grandam and the fostermother, and one
or other of these twain would scarce let go of him a long while.

But now was riding and running after victual for so big a company of
men; for nought would serve the folk of Wethermel but that the whole
fellowship must abide there that night. But all was got ready in a
while, and meanwhile the stay-at-homes might not have enough of praising
and caressing the folk returned, and everything they said or did was a
wonder.

At last the feast was arrayed, and the hall was thronged as much as
might be, and folk fell to meat, and now they were all exceeding merry;
and when they had done eating, the boards were drawn to make more room,
and they fell to the drink, and after the first cup to Christ, and the
second to Allhallows, the third was drunk to the home-comers from the
war. Yet were not the stay-at-homes to be put off with so little, and
they called a cup for Osberne the Captain of the warriors; and when it
had been drunk, then all folk looked toward the captain to see what he
would do; but he rose up and stood in his place, his cheek flushed and
his eyes sparkling: and the word came into his mouth and he sang:

    The War-god's gale  
    Drave down the Dale  
    And thrust us out  
    To the battle-shout;  
    We wended far  
    To the wall of war  
    And trod the way  
    Where the edges lay,  
  The rain of the string rattled rough on the field  
  Where the haysel was hoarded with sword-edge & shield.

    Long lived the sun  
    When the play was begun,  
    And little but white  
    Was the moon all night;  
    But the days drew in  
    And work was to win,  
    And on the snow  
    Lay men alow,  
  And at Yule fared we feasting in war-warded wall  
  And the helm and the byrny were bright in the hall.

    Then changed the year  
    And spring was dear,  
    But no maid went  
    On mead or bent,  
    For there grew on ground  
    New battle-round,  
    New war-wall ran  
    Round houses of man,  
  There tower to tower oft dark and dim grew  
  At noontide of summer with rain of the yew.

    Neath point and edge  
    In the battle hedge  
    We dwelt till wore  
    Late summer o'er;  
    We steered aright  
    The wisdom-bark  
    Through the steel-thronged dark,  
  The warrior we wafted from out of the fray,  
  And he woke midst the worthy and hearkened their say.

    Now peace is won  
    And all strife done,  
    And in our hands  
    The fame of lands  
    Aback we bear  
    To the dale the dear,  
    And the Fathers lie  
    Made glad thereby.  
  Now blossometh bliss in the howes of the old  
  At our tale growing green from their tale that is told.

Loud was the glee and the shouting at his song, and all men said that
every whit thereof was sooth, and that this was the best day that had
ever dawned on Wethermel; and great joy and bliss was on the hall till
they must needs go to their rest. So changed was Wethermel, the niggard
once, and that, it might be deemed, was but one youngling's doing.
