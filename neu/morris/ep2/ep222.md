*Kiartan fetches the price of the Coif from Bathstead*.

AND now a day or two with brooding face  
Did Kiartan go about from place to place  
And speak few words to any, till one day  
He bade his men see to their war-array,  
For two hours after midnight all and some  
Into the hall to wait his word should come,  
And whoso blabbed, he said, the deed should rue.  
So thitherward in arms that night they drew;  
And Refna trembling lay, while Kiartan clad  
His body in the best war-gear he had,  
And through the hangings did she watch the spears,  
And dreadful seemed the laughter to her ears,  
And red the lamps burned, as with twilight grey  
They mingled: then he turned to go away,  
And kissed her as he spake:  
                               "Refna, this eve,  
Most like, a noble gift shalt thou receive;  
Do thou thy part to meet it with good grace,  
And gather what thou canst into this place  
Of fiddlers and of glee-men, and with song  
Meet that good gift that comes to heal thy wrong."

   Now Refna durst not ask, What wilt thou then,  
And whither go to-night these all-armed men?  
Because she deemed she knew what word it was <span id="page_479">p.
479</span>  
That all this clash of arms had brought to pass,  
And sick at heart she grew to think thereof,  
And with her fair white arms made strong by love  
She clung to Kiartan, but he drew her hold  
With gentle hands from off the mail rings cold.  
And kissed her sweet mouth opened now to speak,  
And gat him gone; and she fell back all weak  
Upon her bed, and lying there alone,  
Saw how his war-gear in the bright light shone,  
And heard his cheery voice as he cried loud,  
"To Bathstead, ho!" and then the noisy crowd  
Passed clashing from the hall, and nothing there  
Within a little while might Refna hear,  
But the dawn's noises, and the loitering tread  
Of some maid getting slowly back to bed;  
So there she lay alone in grief and fear,  
But hope's fresh voice shuddering she needs must hear  
Whispering wild words, yet sweet, of chance and crime,  
Telling the wondrous ways of slowfoot time.

   But now at Bathstead ere they rose that morn,  
Men deemed they heard the winding of a horn,  
And, running straightway to the door, could see  
About the stead a goodly company,  
And there were Olaf's sons with sixty men  
Besetting every gate and door; but when  
The men of Bathstead were all armed and went  
Unto the door, they saw a gay-striped tent  
Just raised upon the slope-side ’gainst the hall <span id="page_480">p.
480</span>  
And armed men round about it; one man, tall  
Beyond his fellows, stood some yards more near  
The hall-door, leaning on a pennoned spear,  
Clad in a glittering mail-coat, with a shield  
About his neck, where, on a golden field  
The holy Rood of God was painted fair;  
From ’neath his gilded helm his golden hair  
Fell waving down, but hidden were his eyes  
By the wide brim: then did great fear arise  
Within their hearts, despite their fiery hate,  
Because they knew that now at last, if late,  
Was Kiartan's might aroused and in the field.  
But none the less little would Ospak yield  
To any fear; before the rest he strode,  
And cried aloud:  
                  "Within this fair abode  
Has been thy place, O Kiartan Olafson,  
And not without; what ill deed hast thou done  
That father Oswif has forbidden thee  
Thy honoured seat where it was wont to be?"

   The tall man moved not, but a deep voice came  
From ’neath his helm: "Thou art right wise to name  
A hidden head; grow wiser! sick am I,  
And somewhat deadly now to come anigh;  
My sword has lost its scabbard ’gainst my will,  
Beware then, for its naked edge may kill!"

   Then Ospak raised the spear in his right hand <span id="page_481">p.
481</span>  
And shook it, but the tall man forth did stand  
And pushed his helm aback and showed the face  
Of Kiartan, and across the grassy space  
Cried mightily: "Be wise, and get ye back!  
Of fighting one day shall ye have small lack;  
But now beware, because my father's sons  
Have sworn to spare no man of you, if once  
A drop of blood is spilt! Come ye not forth  
Until I bid you, if of any worth  
Ye hold your lives; and meantime for the sake  
Of what I had and have not, I will take  
My due from mead and byre."  
                               And therewithal  
He let his helm down o’er his visage fall,  
And turned back toward the tent. Back shrank again,  
Cowed into sullen rage, the Bathstead men,  
And armed but helpless there within the hall  
Silent they sat, hearkening the raiders call  
The cattle o’er the meads: in high-seat there  
Sat Bodli, but his visage worn with care  
Of the past days, was sad, but calm and soft,  
As if he thought of gentle things, though oft  
Fierce eyes would scowl upon his dreamy face  
Unnoted of him; in that dreary place  
He seemed like some dead king, condemned in hell  
For his one sin among such men to dwell  
As for their wickedness he hated most  
Ere righteous ways and life and all were lost. <span id="page_482">p.
482</span>

   And in meantime, ’twixt silent trembling bower  
And silent cursing hall, hour after hour  
Did Gudrun pace with restless feet, and heart  
Betwixt two nameless miseries torn apart,  
Whence cold despair was being well fashioned now.  
And Oswif sat apart with wrinkled brow,  
Unnoted in that house of grief and wrong.  
But midst their shame, from outside, laugh and song  
Came loud and louder, mingled with the clank  
Of mead-horns; the feast's clamour never sank  
Till mid-day was well passed; then quieter  
It grew without, and yet they still might hear  
Lowing of neat and men's shouts. Then a voice  
Cried from the slope-side:  
                            "Bathstead men, rejoice  
That ye no autumn-feast need hold this year,  
For certes else should ye find victuals dear  
And hard to come by! Oswif's sons, come out,  
Unarmed and peaceable, and have no doubt  
Of hurt from us!"  
                   They stirred not for a space;  
Then cried the voice: "Lives none within the place?  
Are ye all dead of fear? Come out, I say,  
Else o’er your roof the red cock crows to-day!"

   Then Ospak, cursing, on the pavement cast  
His shield and spear, and toward the doorway passed,  
And in likewise the others one by one,  
Till Bodli and Gudrun were left alone: <span id="page_483">p.
483</span>  
And then she said, "And thou—wilt thou not go?  
Knowst thou the name of him who shames us so?"

   "Yea, yea, I know it!" Bodli cried; "farewell!  
Of me, too, shall there be a tale to tell:  
I will go forth, but not without my sword."

   He drew the thing he named with that last word,  
And ran unto the door; against the wall  
There stood the sons of Oswif, stout and tall,  
Foaming, but helpless: in his saddle now  
Sat Kiartan, unhelmed, his bright hair a-glow  
With the May sun. His brethren stood around  
Beside their horses, and a mighty sound  
Came from the herd of neat that thronged the way  
Beneath the hill-side; spears with pennons gay  
Glittered about them in the sunlight fair,  
For Kiartan's company was gathered there  
Ready to set forth.  
                   So there Bodli stood  
One moment, thinking that the world was good,  
Though not for him; then he cried out: "O thou,  
Thou son of Olaf, come and meet me now,  
For long have I been weary of the earth;  
And now to me but one thing seems of worth  
That I should win death of such hands as thine."

   Then in the sunlight did the bright steel shine,  
And Kiartan's brethren soon had ended all,  
For Bodli ran forth; yet heard Kiartan call <span id="page_484">p.
484</span>  
Across the clash of arms: "Nay, point nor edge  
His blood shall redden not; make ye a hedge  
Of your strong shields and thrust him back again  
Since he knows not that all his might is vain,  
E’en to win death; live, foster-brother, yet,  
And get despite of all, what thou mayst get  
Of joy and honour."  
                      Midway, Bodli stayed,  
And in his hand he poised the heavy blade  
As he would cast it from him, slowly then  
Did he give back face foremost from the men,  
Till in the doorway once again he stood.

   Then Kiartan said: "Yea, cousin, it is good,  
If thou must die by me, that thou shouldst bide  
Some noble fight, some glorious reaping-tide,  
Where each of each fair fame at least may gain—  
God grant a little bliss ere that last pain!—  
But hearken, thievish sons of a wise man!  
Be taught, ye blustering fools, if yet ye can!  
From Yule till now I gave you, a long day,  
To pay the debt that needs was ye must pay;  
Twice told I take it now, and leave behind  
What shall seem shame indeed to most men's mind.  
—This is my bridal gift, think well of it;  
In your own fields it waxed, while ye did sit  
Plotting across the meadhorns. Now take heed  
That oft henceforth your manhood shall ye need  
If ye would live in peace. Blow loud and clear," <span id="page_485">p.
485</span>  
O horns, for Refna waiteth for us there,  
And merry shall we be to-night in hall  
What things soever afterwards may fall!"

   Still Bodli stood with drawn sword in the door  
While midst the clang of arms and horn's loud roar,  
He saw the herd move up the dusty road;  
He saw how Kiartan for a while abode  
Behind the rest, and stared at the grey stead  
Whose roof so often had been o’er his head;  
He saw him turn, and well might deem he sighed,  
Then muttered he, "Ah, would God I had died  
By thee to-day!" and sheathed his sword, and then  
Was hustled by the sullen baffled men  
Who shouldered past him back into the hall,  
Who heeded him just as they did the wall  
Past which they rubbed; but with the last of these  
He went in, casting by all hope of peace.

   But Refna looking from the Herdholt knoll  
That evening, saw a dust-cloud upward roll  
And move toward Herdholt, and her heart beat fast  
When from the midst thereof bright spear-heads passed,  
And then men's helms, and then the guarded herd;  
And she bethought her of her mate's last word,  
And bade the women in their best array,  
And minstrels, stand on either side the way  
To greet the new-comers, whose horns blew loud  
Close by the garth now, while the beasts ’gan crowd <span
id="page_486">p. 486</span>  
About the garth-gate; so, the gate past through,  
Over the homefield toward the wall they drew,  
Tended by gay-clad men-at-arms, who wore  
About their helms fair flowers that Bathstead bore,  
While of the beasts, sharp horn and curl-browed head,  
And dewlapped neck were well begarlanded.  
Then from the close loud joyful cries arose,  
Tinkle of harps, sharp noise of fiddle-bows,  
And all along the line there ran a shout:  
Therewith old Olaf to the door came out,  
And saw his sons swift from the cattle ride,  
Till Kiartan leapt adown by Refna's side  
And cast his arms about her, and ’gan cry:

   "Now is the Queen's-Gift paid for fittingly;  
For these are thine, e’en as my hand and sword,  
To put from thee all care, and every word  
That grieves thee, sweet. O love, but I am gay!  
Sure a fair life beginneth from to-day!"

   She gazed at him, and knew not why her heart  
Scarce in that joyous scene might play its part—  
Why it was not enough—these words of love,  
His bright fair face her longing eyes above?  
Yet with a loving cry she hid her face  
Upon his breast.  
                   Thereat did Olaf gaze  
And muttered low: "A goodly price in sooth  
For a girl's coif! but yet, for Kiartan's youth, <span id="page_487">p.
487</span>  
For his fair hope and glory, and increase  
Of good deeds, and mine own old age of peace,  
Not too much, not too much! Ah, woe is me  
That I should live these latter days to see!"
