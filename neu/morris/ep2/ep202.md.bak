# SEPTEMBER.

O COME at last, to whom the spring-tide's hope  
Looked for through blossoms, what hast thou for me?  
Green grows the grass upon the dewy slope  
Beneath thy gold-hung, grey-leaved apple-tree  
Moveless, e’en as the autumn fain would be  
That shades its sad eyes from the rising sun  
And weeps at eve because the day is done.

   What vision wilt thou give me, autumn morn,  
To make thy pensive sweetness more complete?  
What tale, ne’er to be told, of folk unborn?  
What images of grey-clad damsels sweet  
Shall cross thy sward with dainty noiseless feet?  
What nameless shamefast longings made alive  
Soft-eyed September will thy sad heart give?

   Look long, O longing eyes, and look in vain!  
Strain idly, aching heart, and yet be wise,  
And hope no more for things to come again  
That thou beheldest once with careless eyes!  
Like a new-wakened man thou art, who tries  
To dream again the dream that made him glad  
When in his arms his loving love he had. <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

 

MID young September's fruit-trees next they met,  
With calm hearts, willing such things to forget  
As men had best forget; and certainly  
E’en such a day it was when this might be  
If e’er it might be; fair, without a cloud,  
Yet windless, so that a grey haze did shroud  
The bright blue; neither burning overmuch,  
Nor chill, the blood of those old folk to touch  
With fretful, restless memory of despair.  
Withal no promise of the fruitful year  
Seemed unfulfilled in that fair autumn-tide;  
The level ground along the river-side  
Was merry through the day with sounds of those  
Who gathered apples; o’er the stream arose  
The northward-looking slopes where the swine ranged  
Over the fields that hook and scythe had changed  
Since the last month; but ’twixt the tree-boles grey  
Above them did they see the terraced way,  
And over that the vine-stocks, row on row,  
Whose dusty leaves, well thinned and yellowing now,  
But little hid the bright-bloomed vine-bunches.

   There day-long ’neath the shadows of the trees  
Those elders sat; chary of speech they were,  
For good it seemed to watch the young folk there,  
Not so much busied with their harvesting, <span id="page_4">p.

But o’er their baskets they might stop to sing;  
Nor for the end of labour all so fain  
But eyes of men from eyes of maids might gain  
Some look desired.  
                        So at the midday those  
Who played with labour in the deep green close  
Stinted their gathering for a while to eat;  
Then to the elders did it seem most meet  
Amidst of these to set forth what they might  
Of lore remembered, and to let the night  
Bury its own dead thoughts with wine and sleep;  
So while the loitering autumn sun did creep  
O’er flower-crowned heads, and past sweet eyes of grey,  
And eager lips, and fresh round limbs that lay  
Amid the golden fruit—fruit sweet and fair  
Themselves, that happy days and love did bear  
And life unburdened—while the failing sun  
Drew up the light clouds, was this tale begun,  
Sad, but not sad enow to load the yoke,  
E’en by a feather's weight, of those old folk.  
Sad, and believed but for its sweetness' sake  
By the young folk, desiring not to break  
The spell that sorrow's image cast on them,  
As dreamlike she went past with fluttering hem.
