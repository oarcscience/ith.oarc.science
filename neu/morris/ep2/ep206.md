### THE STORY OF ACCONTIUS AND CYDIPPE.

#### ARGUMENT.

A CERTAIN man coming to Delos beheld a noble damsel there, and was
smitten with the love of her, and made all things of no account but the
winning of her, which at last he brought about in strange wise.

A CERTAIN island-man of old,  
Well fashioned, young, and wise and bold,  
Voyaged awhile in Greekish seas,  
Till Delos of the Cyclades  
His keel made, and ashore he went;  
And, wandering with no fixed intent,  
With others of the shipmen there,  
They came into a garden fair,  
Too sweet for sea-tossed men, I deem,  
If they would scape the lovesome dream  
That youth and May cast o’er the earth,  
If they would keep their careless mirth  
For hands of eld to deal withal.

So in that close did it befall <span id="page_164 ">p. 164</span>  
That ’neath the trees well wrought of May  
These sat amidmost of the day  
Not dry-lipped, and belike a-strain,  
All gifts of that sweet time to gain,  
And yet not finding all enow  
That at their feet the May did throw,  
But longing, half-expecting still  
Some new delight their cup to fill—  
Yea, overfill, to make all strange  
Their lazy joy with piercing change.  
Therewith their youngest, even he  
I told of first, all suddenly  
’Gan sing a song that fitted well  
The thoughts that each man's heart did tell  
Unto itself, and as his throat  
Moved with the music, did he note  
Through half-shut eyes a company  
Of white-armed maidens drawing nigh,  
Well marshalled, as if there they went  
Upon some serious work intent.

SONG.

*FAIR is the night and fair the day,  
Now April is forgot of May,  
Now into June May falls away;  
Fair day, fair night, O give me back  
The tide that all fair things did lack  
Except my love, except my sweet!* <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

*   Blow back, O wind! thou art not kind,  
Though thou art sweet; thou hast no mind  
Her hair about my sweet to wind;  
O flowery sward, though thou art bright,  
I praise thee not for thy delight,  
Thou hast not kissed her silver feet.*

*   Thou know’st her not, O rustling tree,  
What dost thou then to shadow me,  
Whose shade her breast did never see?  
O flowers, in vain ye bow adown!  
Ye have not felt her odorous gown  
Brush past your heads my lips to meet.*

*   Flow on, great river—thou mayst deem  
That far away, a summer stream,  
Thou sawest her limbs amidst thee gleam,  
And kissed her foot, and kissed her knee,  
Yet get thee swift unto the sea!  
With nought of true thou wilt me greet.*

*   And thou that men call by my name,  
O helpless one, hast thou no shame  
That thou must even look the same,  
As while agone, as while agone,  
When thou and she were left alone,  
And hands, and lips, and tears did meet?*

*   Grow weak and pine, lie down to die,  
O body in thy misery,,  
Because short time and sweet goes by;* <span id="page_166">p.
166</span>  
*O foolish heart, how weak thou art!  
Break, break, because thou needs must part  
From thine own love, from thine own sweet!* 

   What was it that through half-shut eyes  
Pierced to his heart, and made him rise  
As one the July storm awakes  
When through the dawn the thunder breaks?  
What was it that the languor clove,  
Wherewith unhurt he sang of love?  
How was it that his eyes had caught  
Her eyes alone of all; that nought  
The others were but images,  
While she, while she amidst of these  
Not first or last—when she was gone,  
Why must he feel so left alone?  
An image in his heart there was  
Of how amidst them one did pass  
Kind-eyed and soft, and looked at him;  
And now the world was waxen dim  
About him, and of little worth,  
Seemed all the wondrous things of earth,  
And fain would he be all alone,  
To wonder why his mirth was gone;  
To wonder why it seemed so strange  
That in nought else was any change,  
When his old life seemed passed away,  
And joy in narrow compass lay, <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>  
He scarce knew where. With laugh and song  
His fellows mocked the dim world's wrong,  
Nor noted him as changed o’ermuch;  
Or if their jests his mood did touch,  
To his great wonder lightly they  
By stammering word were turned away.

   Well, from the close they went at last,  
And through the noble town they passed,  
And saw the wonders wrought of old  
Therein, and heard famed stories told  
Of many a thing; and as a dream  
Did all things to Accontius seem.  
But when night's wings came o’er that place,  
And men slept, piteous seemed his case  
And wonderful, that therewithal  
Night helped him not. From wall to wall  
Night-long his weary eyes he turned,  
Till in the east the daylight burned.  
And then the pang he would not name,  
Stung by the world's change, fiercer came  
Across him, and in haste he rose,  
Driven unto that flowery close  
By restless longing, knowing not  
What part therein his heart had got,  
Nor why he thitherward must wend.

   And now had night's last hope an end,  
When to the garden-gate he came. <span id="page_168">p. 168</span>  
In grey light did the tulip flame  
Over the sward made grey with dew,  
And as unto the place he drew  
Where yesterday he sang that song  
The ousel-cock sang sweet and strong,  
Though almost ere the sky grew grey  
Had he begun to greet the day.  
There now, as by some strong spell bound,  
Accontius paced that spot of ground,  
Restless, with wild thoughts in his head;  
While round about the white-thorn shed  
Sweet fragrance, and the lovely place,  
Lonely of mankind, lacked no grace  
That love for his own home would have.  
Well sang the birds, the light wind drave  
Through the fresh leaves, untouched as yet  
By summer and its vain regret;  
Well piped the wind, and as it swept  
The garden through, no sweet thing slept,  
Nor might the scent of blossoms hide  
The fresh smell of the country side  
It bore with it; and the green bay,  
Whose breast it kissed so far away,  
Spake sometimes yet amid the noise  
Of rustling leaves and song-birds' voice.

   So there awhile our man did pace,  
Still wondering at his piteous case  
That, certes, not to anyone <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>  
Had happed before—awhile agone  
So pleased to watch the world pass by  
With all its changing imagery;  
So hot to play his part therein,  
From each day's death good life to win;  
And now, with a great sigh, he saw  
The yellow level sunbeams draw  
Across the wet grass, as the sun  
First smote the trees, and day begun  
Smiled on the world, whose summer bliss  
In nowise seemed to better his.  
Then, as he thought thereof, he said:  
"Surely all wisdom is clean dead  
Within me. Nought I lack that I,  
By striving, may not come anigh  
Among the things that men desire;  
And why, then, like a burnt-out fire,  
Is my life grown?"  
                       E’en as he spoke  
A throstle-cock beside him broke  
Into the sweetest of his song,  
Yet with his sweet note seemed to wrong  
The unknown trouble of that morn,  
And made him feel yet more forlorn.  
Then he cried out, "O fool, go forth!  
The world is grown of no less worth  
Than yester-morn it was; go then  
And play thy part among brave men  
As thou hadst will to do before <span id="page_170">p. 170</span>  
Thy feet first touched this charmed shore  
Where all is changed."  
                        But now the bird  
Flew from beside him, and he heard  
A rustling nigh, although the breeze  
Had died out mid the thick-leaved trees.  
Therewith he raised his eyes and turned,  
And a great fire within him burned,  
And his heart stopped awhile, for there,  
Against a flowering thorn-bush fair,  
Hidden by tulips to the knee,  
His heart's desire his eyes did see.  
Clad was she e’en as is the dove,  
Who makes the summer sad with love;  
High-girded as one hastening  
In swift search for some longed-for thing;  
Her hair drawn by a silken band  
From her white neck, and in her hand  
A myrtle-spray. Panting she was  
As from the daisies of the grass  
She raised her eyes, and looked around  
Till the astonished eyes she found  
That saw not aught but even her.

   There in a silence hard to bear,  
Impossible to break, they stood,  
With faces changed by love, and blood  
So stirred, that many a year of life  
Had been made eager with that strife <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>  
Of minutes; and so nigh she was  
He saw the little blue veins pass  
Over her heaving breast; and she  
The trembling of his lips might see,  
The rising tears within his eyes.

   Then standing there in mazed wise  
He saw the black-heart tulips bow  
Before her knees, as wavering now  
A half-step unto him she made.  
With a glad cry, though half afraid,  
He stretched his arms out, and the twain,  
E’en at the birth of love's great pain,  
Each unto each-so nigh were grown,  
That little lacked to make them one—  
That little lacked but they should be  
Wedded that hour; knee touching knee,  
Cheek laid to cheek. So seldom fare  
Love's tales, that men are wise to dare;  
Rather, dull hours must pass away,  
And heavy day succeed to day,  
And much be changed by misery,  
Ere two that love may draw anigh-  
And so with these. What fear or shame  
’Twixt longing heart and body came  
’T were hard to tell—they lingered yet.  
Well-nigh they deemed that they had met,  
And that the worst was o’er; e’en then  
There drew anigh the sound of men— <span id="page_172">p. 172</span>  
Loud laugh, harsh talk. With ill surprise ,  
He saw fear change her lovesome eyes;  
He knew her heart bethought it now  
Of other folk, and ills that grow  
From overmuch of love; but he  
Cried out amidst his agony,  
Yet stood there helpless, and withal  
A mist across his eyes did fall,  
And all seemed lost indeed, as now  
Slim tulip-stem and hawthorn-bough  
Slipped rustling back into their place,  
And all the glory of her face  
Had left the world, at least awhile,  
And once more all was base and vile.

   And yet, indeed, when that sharp pain  
Was something dulled, and once again  
Thought helped him, then to him it seemed  
That she had dreamed as he had dreamed,  
And, hoping not for any sight  
Of love, had come made soft by night,  
Made kind by longings unconfessed,  
To give him good hope of the best.  
Then pity came to help his love,  
For now, indeed, he knew whereof  
He sickened; pity came, and then  
The fear of the rough sons of men,  
Sore hate of things that needs must part  
The loving heart from loving heart;<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>  
And at each turn it seemed as though  
Fate some huge net round both did throw  
To stay their feet and dim their sight  
Till they were clutched by endless night;  
And then he fain had torn his hair,  
And cried aloud in his despair,  
But stayed himself as still he thought  
How even that should help him nought,  
That helpless patience needs must be  
His loathed fellow. Wearily  
He got him then from out the place,  
Made lovely by her scarce-seen face,  
And knew that day what longing meant.

   But when the restless daylight went  
From earth's face, through the weary night  
He lay again in just such plight  
As on the last night he had lain;  
But deemed that he would go again  
At daylight to that place of flowers.  
So passed the night through all its hours,  
But ere the dawn came, weak and worn  
He fell asleep, nor woke that morn  
Till all the city was astir;  
And waking must he think of her  
Stolen to that place to find, to find him not—  
Her parted lips, her face flushed hot,  
Her panting breast and girt-up gown,  
Her sleeve ill-fastened, fallen adown <span id="page_174">p.
174</span>  
From one white shoulder, her grey eyes  
Fixed in their misery of surprise,  
As nought they saw but birds and trees;  
Her woeful lingering, as the breeze  
Died ’neath the growing sun, and folk  
Fresh silence of the morning broke;  
And then, the death of hope confessed,  
The quivering lip and heaving breast,  
The burst of tears, the homeward way  
Made hateful by joy past away,  
The dreary day made dull and long  
By hope deferred and gathering wrong.  
All this for him!—and thinking thus  
Their twinlife seemed so piteous  
That all his manhood from him fled,  
And cast adown upon the bed  
He sobbed and wept full sore, until  
When he of grief had had his fill  
He ’gan to think that he might see  
His love, and cure her misery  
If she should be in that same place  
At that same hour when first her face  
Shone on him.  
                  So time wore away  
Till on the world the high noon lay,  
And then at the due place he stood,  
Wondering amid his love-sick mood  
Which blades of grass her foot had bent;  
And there, as to and fro he went, <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>  
A certain man who seemed to be  
A fisher on the troubled sea,  
An old man and a poor, came nigh  
And greeted him and said:  
                              "Hereby  
Thou doest well to stand, my son,  
Since thy stay here will soon be done,  
If of that ship of Crete thou be,  
As well I deem. Here shalt thou see  
Each day at noon a company  
Of all our fairest maids draw nigh;  
To such an one each day they go  
As best can tell them how to do  
In serving of the dreadful queen,  
Whose servant long years bath she been,  
And dwelleth by her chapel fair  
Within this close; they shall be here,  
E’en while I speak. Wot well, fair son,  
Good need it is this should be done,  
For whatso hasty word is said  
That day unto the moon-crowned maid,  
For such an oath is held, as though  
The whole heart into it did go—  
Behold, they come! A goodly sight  
Shalt thou have seen, e’en if to-night  
Thou diest!"  
                Grew Accontius wan  
As the sea-cliffs, for the old man  
Now pointed to the gate, wherethrough <span id="page_176">p.
176</span>  
The company of maidens drew  
Toward where they stood; Accontius,  
With trembling lips, and piteous  
Drawn brow, turned toward them, and afar  
Beheld her like the morning-star  
Amid the weary stars of night.  
Midmost the band went his delight,  
Clad in a gown of blue, whereon  
Were wrought fresh flowers, as newly won  
From the May fields; with one hand she  
Touched a fair fellow lovingly,  
The other, hung adown, did hold  
An ivory harp well strung with gold;  
Gaily she went, nor seemed as though  
One troublous thought her heart did know.  
Accontius sickened as she came  
Anigh him, and with heart aflame  
For very rage of jealousy,  
He heard her talking merrily  
Unto her fellow—the first word  
From those sweet lips he yet had heard,  
Nor might he know what thing she said;  
Yet presently she turned her head  
And saw him, and her talk she stopped  
E’en therewith, and her lips down dropped,  
And trembling amid love and shame  
Over her face a bright flush came;  
Nathless without another look  
She passed him by, whose whole frame shook <span id="page_177">p.
177</span>  
With passion as an aspen leaf.  
But she being gone, all blind with grief,  
He stood there long, and muttered:  
                                    "Why  
Would she not note my misery?  
Had it been then so hard to turn  
And show me that her heart did yearn  
For something nigher like mine own?  
O well content to leave me lone,  
O well content to stand apart,  
And nurse a pleasure in thine heart,  
The joy of being so well beloved,  
Still taking care thou art not moved  
By aught like trouble!—yet beware,  
For thou mayst fall for all thy care!"

   So from the place he turned away;  
Some secret spell he deemed there lay,  
Some bar unseen athwart that grass,  
O’er which his feet might never pass  
Whatso his heart bade. Hour by hour  
Passed of the day, and ever slower  
They seemed to pass, and ever he  
Thought of her last look wearily—  
Now meant it that, now meant it this;  
Now bliss, and now the death of bliss.  
'But O, if once again,' he thought,  
'Face unto face we might be brought, <span id="page_178">p. 178</span>  
Then doubt I not but I should read  
What at her hands would be my meed,  
And in such wise my life would guide;  
Either the weary end to bide  
E’en as I might, or strengthen me  
To take the sweet felicity,  
Casting by thought of fear or death—  
But now when I must hold my breath,  
Who knows how long, while scale mocks scale  
With trembling joy, and trembling bale  
O hard to bear! O hard to bear!'

   So spake he, knowing bitter fear  
And hopeful longing's sharp distress,  
But not the weight of hopelessness.

   And now there passed by three days more,  
And to the flowery place that bore  
The sharp and sweet of his desire  
Each day he went, his heart afire  
With foolish hope. Each day he saw  
The band of damsels toward him draw,  
And trembling said, "Now, now at last  
Surely her white arms will be cast  
About my neck before them all;  
Or at the worst her eyes will call  
My feet to follow. Can it be  
That she can bear my misery,  
When of my heart she surely knows?" <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>  
And every day midmost the close  
They met, and on the first day she  
Did look upon him furtively  
In loving wise; and through his heart  
Love sent a pleasure-pointed dart—  
A minute, and away she went,  
And left him nowise more content  
Than erst he had been.  
                          The next day  
Needs must she flush and turn away  
Before their eyes met, and he stood  
When she was gone in wretched mood,  
Faint with desire.  
                    The third hope came,  
And then his hungry eyes, aflame  
With longing wild, beheld her pass  
As though amidst a dream she was;  
Then e’en ere she had left the place  
With his clenched hand he smote his face,  
And void of everything but pain,  
Through the thronged streets the sea did gain,  
Not recking aught, and there at last  
His body on the sand he cast,  
Nigh the green waves, till in the end  
Some thought the crushing cloud did rend,  
And down the tears 'rushed from his eyes  
For ruth of his own miseries;  
And with the tears came thought again  
To mingle with his formless pain <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>  
And hope withal—but yet more fear,  
For he bethought him now that near  
The time drew for his ship to sail.  
Yet was the thought of some avail  
To heal the unreason of his 'heart,  
For now he needs must play a part  
Wherein was something to be done,  
If he would not be left alone  
Life-long, with love unsatisfied.

   So now he rose, and looking wide  
Along the edges of the bay,  
Saw where his fellows’ tall ship lay  
Anigh the haven, and a boat  
’Twixt shore and ship-side did there float  
With balanced oars; but on the shroud  
A shipman stood, and shouted loud  
Unto the boat—words lost, in sooth,  
But which no less the trembling youth  
Deemed certainly of him must be  
And where he was; then suddenly  
He turned, though none pursued, and fled  
Along the sands, nor turned his head  
Till round a headland he did reach  
A long cove with a sandy beach;  
Then looking landward he saw where  
A streamlet cleft the sea-cliffs bare,  
Making a little valley green,  
Beset with thorn-trees; and between <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>  
The yellow strand and cliff's grey brow  
Was built a cottage white and low  
Within a little close, upon  
The green slope that the stream had won  
From rock and sea; and thereby stood  
A fisher, whose grey homespun hood  
Covered white locks: so presently  
Accontius to that man drew nigh,  
Because he seemed the man to be  
Who told of that fair company,  
Deeming that more might there be learned  
About the flame wherewith he burned.

   Withal he found it even so,  
And that the old man him did know,  
And greeted him, and fell to talk,  
As such folk will of things that balk  
The poor man's fortune, waves and winds,  
And changing days and great men's minds;  
And at the last it so befell  
That this Accontius came to tell  
A tale unto the man—how he  
Was fain to ’scape the uneasy sea,  
And those his fellows, and would give  
Gold unto him, that he might live  
In hiding there, till they had sailed.  
Not strange it was if he prevailed  
In few words, though the elder smiled  
As not all utterly beguiled, <span id="page_182">p. 182</span>  
Nor curious therewithal to know  
Such things as he cared not to show.

   So there alone a while he dwelt,  
And lonely there, all torment felt,  
As still his longing grew and grew;  
And ever as hot noontide drew  
From dewy dawn and sunny morn,  
He felt himself the most forlorn;  
For then the best he pictured her:

   "Now the noon wind, the scent-bearer  
Is busy midst her gown," he said,  
"The fresh-plucked flowers about her head  
Are drooping now with their desire;  
The grass with unconsuming fire  
Faints ’neath the pressure of her feet;  
The honey-bees her lips would meet,  
But fail for fear; the swift's bright eyes  
Are eager round the mysteries  
Of the fair hidden fragrant breast,  
Where now alone may I know rest—  
—Ah pity me, thou pityless!  
Bless me who know’st not how to bless;  
Fall from thy height, thou highest of all,  
On me a very wretch to call!  
Thou, to whom all things fate doth give,  
Find without me thou canst not live!  
Desire me, O thou world's desire, <span id="page_183">p. 183</span>  
Light thy pure heart at this base fire!  
Save me, save me, thou knowest nought,  
Of whom thou never hadst a thought!  
O queen of all the world, stoop down,  
Before my feet cast thou thy crown!  
Speak to me, as I speak to thee!"

   He walked beside the summer sea  
As thus he spake, at eventide;  
Across the waste of waters wide;  
The dead sun's light a wonder cast,  
That into grey night faded fast;  
And ever as the shadows fell,  
More formless grew the unbreaking swell  
Far out to sea; more strange and white,  
More vocal through the hushing night,  
The narrow line of changing foam,  
That ’twixt the sand and fishes’ home  
Writhed, driven onward by the tide—  
—So slowly by the ocean's side  
He paced, till dreamy passion grew;  
The soft wind o’er the sea that blew,  
Dried the cold tears upon his face,  
Kindly if sad seemed that lone place,  
Yea, in a while it scarce seemed lone,  
When now at last the white moon shone  
Upon the sea, and showed that still  
It quivered, though a moveless hill  
A little while ago it seemed. <span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

   So, turning homeward now, he dreamed  
Of many a help and miracle,  
That in the olden time befell  
Unto love's servants; e’en when he  
Had clomb the hill anigh the sea,  
And reached the hut now litten bright,  
Not utterly with food and light  
And common talk his dream passed by.  
Yea, and with all this, presently  
’Gan tell the old man when it was  
That the great feast should come to pass  
Unto Diana: Yea, and then  
He, among all the sons of men,  
E’en of that very love must speak;  
Then grew Accontius faint and weak,  
And his mouth twitched, and tears began  
To pain his eyes; for the old man,  
As one possessed, went on to tell  
Of all the loveliness that well  
Accontius wotted of, and now  
For the first time he came to know  
What name among her folk she had,  
And, half in cruel pain, half glad,  
He heard the old man say:  
                              "Indeed  
This sweet Cydippe bath great need  
Of one to save her life from woe,  
Because or ere the brook shall flow  
Narrow with August ’twixt its banks, <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>  
Her folk, to win Diana's thanks,  
Shall make her hers, and she shall be  
Honoured of all folk certainly,  
But unwed, shrunk as time goes on  
Into a sour-hearted crone."

   Accontius ’gan the room to pace  
Ere he had done; with curious face  
The old man gazed, but uttered nought;  
Then in his heart Accontius thought,  
"Ah when her image passeth by  
Like a sweet breath, the blinded eye  
Gains sight, the deaf man heareth well,  
The dumb man lovesome tales can tell,  
Hopes dead for long rise from their tombs,  
The barren like a garden blooms;  
And I alone—I sit and wait,  
With deedless hands, on black-winged fate."

   And so, when men had done with day,  
Sleepless upon his bed he lay,  
Striving to think if aught might move  
Hard fate to give him his own love;  
And thought of what would do belike,  
And said, "Tomorrow will I strike  
Before the iron groweth dull."  
And so, with mind of strange things full,  
Just at the dawn he fell asleep,  
Yet as the shadows ’gan to creep <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>  
Up the long slope before the sun,  
His blinking, troubled sleep was done;  
And with a start he sat upright,  
Now deeming that the glowing light  
Was autumn's very sun, that all  
Of ill had happed that could befall;  
Yet fully waked up at the last,  
From out the cottage-door he passed,  
And saw how the old fisherman  
His coble through the low surf ran  
And shouted greeting from the sea;  
Then ’neath an ancient apple-tree,  
That on the little grassy slope  
Stood speckled with the autumn's hope  
He cast him down, and slept again;  
And sleeping dreamed about his pain,  
Yet in the same place seemed to be,  
Beneath the ancient apple-tree.  
So in his dream he heard a sound  
Of singing fill the air around,  
And yet saw nought; till in a while  
The twinkling sea's uncounted smile  
Was hidden by a rosy cloud,  
That seemed some wondrous thing to shroud,  
For in its midst a bright spot grew  
Brighter and brighter, and still drew  
Unto Accontius, till at last  
A woman from amidst it passed,  
And, wonderful in nakedness, <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>  
With rosy feet the grass did press,  
And drew anigh; he durst not move  
Or speak, because the Queen of Love  
He deemed he knew; she smiled on him,  
And, even as his dream waxed dim,  
Upon the tree-trunk gnarled and grey  
A slim hand for a while did lay;  
Then all waxed dark, and then once more  
He lay there as he lay before,  
But all burnt up the green-sward was,  
And songless did the throstle pass  
’Twixt dark green leaf and golden fruit,  
And at the old tree's knotted root  
The basket of the gatherer  
Lay, as though autumn-tide were there.  
Then in his dream he thought he strove  
To speak that sweet name of his love  
Late learned, but could not; for away  
Sleep passed, and now in sooth he lay  
Awake within the shadow sweet,  
The sunlight creeping o’er his feet.

   Then he arose to think upon  
The plans that he from night had won,  
And still in each day found a flaw  
That night's half-dreaming eyes ne’er saw,  
And far away all good hope seemed,  
And the strange dream he late had dreamed  
Of no account he made, but thought <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>.  
That it had come and gone for nought.

   And now the time went by till he  
Knew that his keel had put to sea,  
Yet after that a day or two  
He waited, ere he dared to do  
The thing he longed for most, and meet  
His love within the garden sweet.  
He saw her there, he saw a smile  
The paleness of her face beguile  
Before she saw him; then his heart  
With pity and remorse ’gan smart;  
But when at last she turned her head,  
And he beheld the bright flush spread  
Over her face, and once again  
The pallor come, ’twixt joy and pain  
His heart was torn; he turned away,  
Thinking: "Long time ere that worst day  
That unto her a misery  
Will be, yea even as unto me,  
And many a thing ere then may fall,  
Or peaceful death may end it all."

   The host that night his heart did bless  
With praises of her loveliness  
Once more, and said: "Fools men are  
Who work themselves such bitter care  
That they may live when they are dead;  
Her mother's stern cold hardihead <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>  
Shall make this sweet but dead-alive;  
For who in all the world shall strive  
With such an oath as she shall make?"

   Accontius, for self-pity's sake,  
Must steal forth to the night to cry  
Some wordless prayer of agony;  
And yet, when he was come again,  
Of more of such-like speech was fain,  
And needs must stammer forth some word,  
That once more the old fisher stirred  
To speech; who now began to tell  
Tales of that oath as things known well,  
To wise men from the days of old,  
Of how a mere chance-word would hold  
Some poor wretch as a life-long slave;  
Nay, or the very wind that drave  
Some garment's hem, some lock of hair  
Against the dreadful altar there,  
Had turned a whole sweet life to ill;  
So heedfully must all fulfil  
Their vows unto the dreadful maid.  
Accontius heard the words he said  
As through a thin sleep fraught with dreams,  
Yet afterward would fleeting gleams  
Of what the old man said confuse  
His weary heart, that ne’er was loose  
A minute from the bonds of love,  
And still of all, strange dreams he wove. <span id="page_190">p.
190</span>

   So the time passed; a brooding life  
That with his love might hold no strife  
Accontius led; he did not spare  
With torment vain his soul to tear  
By meeting her in that same place:  
No fickle hope now changed her face,  
No hot desire therein did burn,  
Rather it seemed her heart did yearn  
With constant sorrow, and such love  
As surely might the hard world move.  
—Ah! shall it? Love shall go its ways,  
And sometimes gather useless praise  
From joyful hearts, when now at rest  
The lover lies, but oftenest  
To hate thereby the world is moved,  
But oftenest the well-beloved  
Shall pay the kiss back with a blow,  
Shall smile to see the hot tears flow,  
Shall answer with scarce-hidden scorn  
The bitter words by anguish torn  
From such a heart, as fain would rest  
Silent until death brings the best.

   So drew the time on to the day  
When all hope must be cast away;  
Late summer now was come, and still  
As heeding neither good or ill  
Of living men, the stream ran down  
The green slope to the sea-side brown, <span id="page_191">p.
191</span>  
Singing its changeless song; still there  
Accontius dwelt ’twixt slope-side fair  
And changing murmur of the sea.

   The night before all misery  
Should be accomplished, red-eyed, wan,  
He gave unto the ancient man  
What wealth he had, and bade farewell  
In such a voice as tale doth tell  
Unto the wise; then to his bed  
He crept, and still his weary head  
Tossed on the pillow, till the dawn  
The fruitful mist from earth had drawn.  
Once more with coming light he slept,  
Once more from out his bed he leapt,  
Thinking that he had slept too fast,  
And that all hope was over-past;  
And with that thought he knew indeed  
How good is hope to man at need,  
Yea, even the least ray thereof.  
Then dizzy with the pain of love  
He went from out the door, and stood  
Silent within the fruitful rood.  
Still was the sunny morn and fair,  
A scented haze was in the air;  
So soft it was, it seemed as spring  
Had come once more her arms to fling  
About the dying year, and kiss  
The lost world into dreams of bliss. <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

   Now ’neath the tree he sank adown,  
Parched was the sward thereby and brown,  
Save where about the knotted root  
A green place spread. The golden fruit  
Hung on the boughs, lay on the ground;  
The spring-born thrushes lurked around,  
But sang not, yet the stream sang well,  
And gentle tales the sea could tell.  
Ere sunrise was the fisher gone,  
And now his brown-sailed boat alone,  
Some league or so from off the shore,  
Moved slowly ’neath the sweeping oar.  
So soothed by sights and sounds that day,  
Sore weary, soon Accontius lay  
In deep sleep as he erst had done,  
And dreamed once more, nor yet had gone  
E’en this time from that spot of ground;  
And once more dreaming heard the sound  
Of unseen singers, and once more  
A pink-tinged cloud spread thwart the shore,  
And a vague memory touched him now  
Amid his sleep; his knitted brow  
’Gan to unfold, a happy smile  
His long love-languor did beguile  
As from the cloud the naked one  
Came smiling forth—but not alone;  
For now the image of his love,  
Clad like the murmuring summer dove,  
She held by the slim trembling hand, <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>  
And soon he deemed the twain did stand  
Anigh his head. Round Venus’ feet  
Outbroke the changing spring-flowers sweet  
From the parched earth of autumn-tide;  
The long locks round her naked side  
The sea-wind drave; lily and rose,  
Plucked from the heart of her own close,  
Were girdle to her, and did cling,  
Mixed with some marvellous golden thing,  
About her neck and bosom white,  
Sweeter than they; with eyes that bliss  
Changed not, her doves brushed past to kiss  
The marvel of her limbs; yet bright,  
Fair beyond words as she might be,  
So fell it by love's mystery  
That open-mouthed Accontius lay  
In that sweet dream, nor drew away  
His eyes from his love's pitying eyes;  
And at the last he strove to rise,  
And dreamed that touch of hand in hand  
Made his heart faint; alas! the band  
Of soft sleep, overstrained therewith,  
Snapped short, and left him there to writhe  
In helpless woe.  
                    Yet in a while  
Strange thoughts anew did him beguile;  
Well-nigh he dreamed again, and saw  
The naked goddess toward him draw,  
Until the sunshine touched his face <span id="page_194">p. 194</span>  
And stark awake in that same place  
He sighed, and rose unto his knee,  
And saw beneath the ancient tree,  
Close by his hand, an apple lie,  
Great, smooth, and golden. Dreamily  
He turned it o’er, and in like mood  
A long sharp thorn, as red as blood,  
He took into his hand, and then,  
In language of the Grecian men,  
Slowly upon its side he wrote,  
As one who thereof took no note,  
*Accontius will I wed to-day;*  
Then stealthily across the bay  
He glanced, and trembling gat him down  
With hurried steps unto the town,  
Where for the high-tide folk were dight,  
And all looked joyous there and bright,  
As toward the fane their steps they bent.  
And thither, too, Accontius went,  
Scarce knowing if on earth or air  
His feet were set; he coming there,  
Gat nigh the altar standing-place,  
And there with haggard eyes ’gan gaze  
Upon the image of the maid  
Whose wrath makes man and beast afraid.

   So in a while the rites began,  
And many a warrior and great man  
Served the hard-hearted one, until <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>  
Of everything she had her fill  
That Gods desire; and, trembling now,  
Accontius heard the curved horns blow  
That heralded the damsels’ band;  
And scarce for faintness might he stand,  
When now, the minstrels’ gowns of gold  
Being past, he could withal behold  
White raiment fluttering, and he saw  
The fellows of his own love draw  
Unto the altar; here and there  
The mothers of those maidens fair  
Went by them, proud belike, and fain  
To note the honour they should gain.

   Now scarce with hungry eyes might he  
Gaze on those fair folk steadily,  
As one by one they passed by him;  
His limbs shook, and his eyes did swim,  
And if he heard the words they said,  
As outstretched hand and humble head  
Strengthened the trembling maiden's vow,  
Nought of their meaning did he know—  
—And still she came not—what was this?  
Had the dull death of hope of bliss  
Been her death too—ah, was she dead?  
Or did she lie upon her bed,  
With panting mouth and fixed bright eyes,  
Waiting the new life's great surprise,  
All longings past, amid the hush <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>  
Of life departing?  
                 A great rush  
Of fearful pain stopped all his blood  
As thus he thought; a while he stood  
Blinded and tottering, then the air  
A great change on it seemed to bear,  
A heavenly scent; and fear was gone,  
Hope but a name; as if alone  
Mid images of men he was,—  
Alone with her who now did pass  
With fluttering hem and light footfall  
The corner of the precinct wall.  
Time passed, she drew nigh to the place,  
Where he was standing, and her face  
Turned to him, and her steadfast eyes  
Met his, with no more of surprise  
Than if in words she had been told  
That each the other should behold  
E’en in such wise—Pale was she grown;  
Her sweet breath, that an unheard moan  
Seemed to her lover, scarce might win  
Through her half-opened lips; most thin  
The veil seemed ’twixt her mournful eyes,  
And death's long-looked-for mysteries;  
Frail were her blue-veined hands; her feet  
The pink-tinged marble steps did meet  
As though all will were gone from her.  
There went a matron, tall and fair,  
Noble to look on, by her side,<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>  
Like unto her, but for cold pride  
And passing by of twenty years,  
And all their putting back of tears;  
Her mother, certes, and a glow  
Of pleasure lit her stern face now  
At what that day should see well done.

   But now, as the long train swept on,  
There on the last step of the fane  
She stood, so loved, so loved in vain;  
Her mother fallen aback from her,  
Yet eager the first word to hear  
Of that her dreadful oath—so nigh  
Were misery to misery,  
That each might hear the other's breath;  
That they this side of fair hope's death  
Might yet have clung breast unto breast,  
And snatched from life a little rest,  
And snatched a little joy from pain.

   O weary hearts, shall all be vain,  
Shall all be nought, this strife and love?  
—Once more with slow foot did she move  
Unto the last step, with no sound  
Unto Accontius turning round,  
Who spake not, but, as moved at last  
By some kind God, the apple cast  
Into her bosom's folds—once more  
She stayed, while a great flush came o’er <span id="page_198">p.
198</span>  
Her sweet face erst half-dead and wan;  
Then went a sound from man to man  
So fair she seemed, and some withal  
Failed not to note the apple fall  
Into her breast.  
                Now while with fear  
And hope Accontius trembled there  
And to her side her mother came,  
She cast aside both fear and shame  
From out her noble heart, and laid  
Upon the altar of the maid  
Her fair right hand, clasped firm around  
The golden fruit, and with no sound  
Her lips moved, and her eyes upraised  
Upon the marble image gazed,  
With such a fervour as if she  
Would give the thing humanity  
And love and pity—then a space  
Unto her love she turned her face  
All full of love, as if to say,  
"So ends our trouble from to-day,  
Either with happy life or death."

   Yet anxious still, with held-back breath,  
He saw her mother come to her  
With troubled eyes. "What hast thou there?"  
He heard her say. "Is the vow made?  
I heard no word that thou hast said?" <span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

   Then through him did her sweet voice thrill:  
"No word I spake for good or ill;  
But this spake for me; so say ye  
What oath in written words may be;  
Although, indeed, I wrote them nought;  
And in my heart had got no thought,  
When first I came hereto this morn,  
But here to swear myself forlorn  
Of love and hope—because the days  
Of life seemed but a weary maze,  
Begun without leave asked of me,  
Whose ending I might never see,  
Or what came after them—but now  
Backward my life I will not throw  
Into your deep-dug, spice-strewn grave,  
But either all things will I save  
This day, or make an end of all."

   Then silence on the place did fall;  
With frowning face, yet hand that shook,  
The fated fruit her mother took  
From out her hand, and pale she grew,  
When the few written words she knew,  
And what they meant; but speedily  
She brushed the holy altar by,  
Unto the wondering priests to tell  
What things there in their midst befell.

   There, in low words, they spoke awhile, <span id="page_200">p.
200</span>  
How they must deal with such a guile,  
Cast by the goddess of desire  
Into the holy maiden's fire.  
And to the priests it seemed withal,  
That a full oath they needs must call  
That writing on the altar laid:  
Then, wroth and fearful, some there bade  
To seek a death for these to die,  
If even so they might put by  
The maid's dread anger; crueller  
They grew as still they gathered fear,  
And shameful things the dusk fane heard,  
As grey beard wagged against grey beard,  
And fiercer grew the ancient eyes.

   But from the crowd, meanwhile, did rise  
Great murmuring, for from man to man  
The rumour of the story ran,  
I know not how; and therewithal  
Some god-sent lovesome joy did fall  
On all hearts there, until it seemed  
That each one of his own soul dreamed,  
Beloved, and loving well; and when  
Some cried out that the ancient men  
Had mind too slay the lovers there,  
A fierce shout rent the autumn air:  
"Nay, wed the twain; love willeth it!"  
But silent did the elders sit,  
With death and fear on either hand, <span id="page_201">p. 201</span>  
Till one said, "Fear not, the whole land,  
Not we, take back what they did give;  
With many scarce can one man strive;  
Let be, themselves shall make amends."

   "Yea, let be," said the next; "all ends,  
Despite the talk of mortal men,  
Who deem themselves undying, when,  
Urged by some unknown God's commands,  
They snatch at love with eager hands,  
And gather death that grows thereby,  
Yet swear that love shall never die—  
Let be—in their own hearts they bear  
The seeds of pangs to pierce and tear.  
What need, White-armed, to follow them,  
With well-strung bow and fluttering hem,  
Adown the tangle of life's wood?  
Thou knowest what the fates deem good  
For wretches that love overmuch—  
One mad desire for sight and touch;  
One spot alone of all the earth  
That seems to them of any worth;  
One sound alone that they may bear  
Amidst earth's joyful sounds to hear;  
And sight, and sound, and dwelling-place,  
And soft caressing of one face,  
Forbidden, and forbidden still,  
Or granted e’en for greater ill,  
But for a while, that they may be <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>  
Sunk deeper into misery—  
—Great things are granted unto those  
That love not—far-off things brought close,  
Things of great seeming brought to nought,  
And miracles for them are wrought;  
All earth and heaven lie underneath  
The hand of him who wastes not breath  
In striving for another's love,  
In hoping one more heart to move.  
—A light thing and a little thing,  
Ye deem it, that two hearts should cling  
Each unto each, till two are one,  
And neither now can be alone?  
O fools, who know not all has sworn  
That those shall ever be forlorn  
Who strive to bring this thing to pass—  
So is it now, as so it was,  
And so it shall be evermore,  
Till the world's fashion is passed o’er."

   White-bearded was the ancient man  
Who spoke, with wrinkled face and wan;  
But as unto the porch he turned  
A red spot in his cheek there burned,  
And his eyes glittered, for, behold! .  
Close by the altar's horns of gold,  
There stood the weary ones at last,  
Their arms about each other cast,  
Twain no more now, they said—no more <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>  
What things soe’er fate had in store.  
Careless of life, careless of death;  
Now, when each felt the other's breath  
On lip and cheek, and many a word  
By all the world beside unheard,  
Or heard and little understood,  
Each spake to each, and all seemed good;  
Yea, though amid the world's great wrong,  
Their space of life should not be long;  
O bitter sweet if they must die!  
O sweet, too sweet, if time passed by;  
If time made nought for them, should find  
Their arms in such wise intertwined  
Years hence, with no change drawing near!

   Nor says the tale, nor might I hear,  
That aught of evil on them fell.  
Few folk there were but thought it well,  
When saffron-robed, fair-wreathed, loose-haired  
Cydippe through the city fared  
Well won at last; when lingering shame  
Somewhat upon the lovers came,  
Now that all fear was quite bygone,  
And yet they were not all alone,  
Because, from men the sun was fain  
A little more of toil to gain  
Awhile in prison of his light,  
To hold aback the close-lipped night. <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

 

SILENCE a little when the tale was told,  
Soon broken by the merry-voiced and bold  
Among the youths, though some belike were fain  
For more of silence yet, that their sweet pain  
Might be made sweeter still by hope and thought  
Amid the words of the old story caught—  
Might be made keener by the pensive eyes  
That half-confessed love made so kind and wise;  
Yet these too, mid the others, went their way,  
To get them through the short October day  
’Twixt toil and toilsome love, e’en as they might;  
If so, perchance, the kind and silent night  
Might yet reward their reverent love with dreams  
Less full of care.  
                    But round the must's red streams,  
’Twixt the stripped vines the elders wandered slow,  
And unto them, e’en as a soothing show  
Was the hid longing, wild desire, blithe hope,  
That seethed there on the tangled sun-worn slope  
’Twixt noon and moonrise. Resolute were they  
To let no pang of memory mar their day,  
And long had fear, before the coming rest,  
Been set aside. And so the changed west,  
Forgotten of the sun, was grey with haze;  
The moon was high and bright, when through the maze <span
id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
Of draggled tendrils back at last they turned,  
And red the lights within the fair house burned  
Through the grey night; strained string, and measured voice  
Of minstrels, mingled with the varying noise  
Of those who through the deep-cut misty roads  
Went slowly homeward now to their abodes.  
A short space more of that short space was gone,  
Wherein each deemed himself not quite alone.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

IN late October, when the failing year  
But little pleasure more for men might bear,  
They sat within the city's great guest-hall,  
Nigh enow to the sea to hear the fall  
Of the low haven-waves when night was still.  
But on that day wild wind and rain did fill  
The earth and sea with clamour, and the street  
Held few who cared the driving scud to meet.  
But inside, as a little world it was,  
Peaceful amid the hubbub that did pass  
Its strong walls in untiring waves of rage,  
With the earth's intercourse wild war to wage.  
Bright glowed the fires, and cheerier their light  
Fell on the gold that made the fair place bright  
Of roof and wall, for all the outside din.  
Yet of the world's woe somewhat was within  
The noble compass of its walls, for there  
Were histories of great striving painted fair,  
Striving with love and hate, with life and death,  
With hope that lies, and fear that threateneth.  
   And so mid varied talk the day went by,  
As such days will, not quite unhappily,  
Not quite a burden, till the evening came  
With lulling of the storm: and little blame  
The dark had for the dull day's death, when now <span id="page_207">p.
207</span>  
The good things of the hall were set aglow  
By the great tapers. Midmost of the board  
Sat Rolf, the captain, who took up the word,  
And said:  
           "Fair fellows, a strange tale is this,  
Heard and forgotten midst my childish bliss,  
Little remembered midst the change and strife,  
Come back again this latter end of life,  
I know not why; yet as a picture done  
For my delight, I see my father's son,  
My father with the white cloth on his knees,  
Beaker in hand, amid the orange-trees  
At Micklegarth, and the high-hatted man  
Over against him, with his visage wan,  
Black beard, bright eyes, and thin composed hands,  
Telling this story of the fiery lands."
