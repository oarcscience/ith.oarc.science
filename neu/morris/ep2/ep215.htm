<p align="center"><i>Kiartan's Farewell to Norway</i>.</p>  
<p>MEANWHILE to Kiartan far across the sea,<br> Unto all seeming, life went merrily;<br> Yet none the less the lapse of days would bring<br> Unto his frank heart something of a sting,<br> And Bodli's sad departing face and word,<br> Not wholly thrust out from his memory, stirred<br> Doubts of the changing days in Kiartan's mind,<br> And scarce amid his joyance might he find<br> The happy days he ever looked to have,<br> Till he were lying silent in his grave.<br> And somewhat more distraught now would he take<br> The gentle words that the king's sister spake,<br> And look into her eyes less fervently,<br> And less forget the world when she drew nigh,<br> And start and look around as her soft hand<br> Fell upon his, as though a ghost did stand<br> Anigh him, and he feared to hear it speak.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ingibiorg for her part, grown too weak <A NAME="page_419"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 419</FONT></A><br> Against the love she had for him to strive,<br> Yet knew no less whither the days did drive<br> Her wasted life; and, seeing him as oft<br> As she might do, and speaking sweet and soft,<br> When they twain were together: smiling, too,<br> Though fast away the lovesome time did go,<br> Wept long through lonely hours, nor cast away<br> From out her heart thought of the coming day,<br> When all should be as it had never been,<br> And the wild sea should roll its waves between<br> His grey eyes and her weary useless tears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while she brooded o&#146;er the coming years<br> Empty of love, and snatched what joy there was<br> Yet left to her, great tidings came to pass;<br> For late the summer after Bodli sailed,<br> News came, that now at last had Christ prevailed<br> In Iceland; that the Hill of Laws had heard<br> Sung through the clear air many a threatening word,<br> And seen the weapons gather for the fight;<br> Till Snorri's wiles, Hall's wisdom, Gizur's might,<br> And fears of many men, and wavering doubt<br> On the worse side, had brought it so about<br> That now Christ's faith was law to everyone:<br> The learned say, a thousand years agone<br> Since the cold shepherds in the winter night<br> Beheld and heard the angels&#146; fresh delight.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Olaf's heart swelled at such news as these,<br> Straightway he sent for the four hostages, <A NAME="page_420"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 420</FONT></A><br> And bade them with good gifts to go their ways<br> If so they would; or stay and gather praise<br> And plenteous honour there; and as he spake<br> He glanced at Kiartan, and a smile did break<br> Across his kingly face, as who would say,<br> "Thou at the least wilt scarcely go away."<br> But Kiartan answered not the smile, but stood<br> Grave with deep thought, and troubled in his mood,<br> Until he saw his fellows looked that he<br> Should speak for all; then said he presently:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks have thou, King, for all that thou hast done<br> To us, and the great honour I have won<br> At thine hands here; yet be not angry, King,<br> If still we thank thee most for this one thing,<br> That here thou stay&#146;st us not against our will;<br> Thicker is blood than water, say I still;<br> This is the third year since I left my kin<br> And land&#151;and other things that dwell therein."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king's face fell, and in sharp words and few<br> He answered: "Well, a gift I gave to you;<br> And will not take it back&#151;Go, Kiartan, then,<br> And, if thou canst, find kinder, truer men,<br> And lovelier maids in thy land than in this!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kiartan said, "King, take it not amiss!<br> Thou knowest I have ever said to thee,<br> That I must one day go across the sea;<br> Belike I shall come back upon a tide, <A NAME="page_421"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 421</FONT></A><br> And show thee such a wonder of a bride<br> As earth holds not, nay nor the heavens, I deem."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God send thee a good ending to thy dream;<br> Yet my heart cries that if thou goest from me,<br> Thy pleasant face I never more shall see;<br> Be merry then, while fate will have it so!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So therewith unto high feast did they go,<br> And by the king sat Kiartan, and the day<br> &#146;Twixt merry words and sad thoughts wore away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now were the ships got ready, and the wares<br> Drawn for long months past from the upland fairs<br> Were laid ashipboard. K&aacute;lf was skipper still<br> Of Kiartan's ship, for never had he will<br> To leave his side. Now restless Kiartan was,<br> And longed full sore for these last days to pass,<br> For in his heart there lurked a spark of fear,<br> Nor any word of Gudrun might he hear<br> From those who brought the news of change of faith,<br> Since nigh the fleet they dwelt, my story saith,<br> In the south country, and knew nought at all<br> Of what in Laxdale late had chanced to fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by their bridges lay the laden ships,<br> And he now at the last must see the lips<br> Of Ingibiorg grow pale with their farewell;<br> And sick at heart he grew, for, sooth to tell,<br> He feared her sorrow much, and furthermore <A NAME="page_422"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 422</FONT></A><br> He loved her with a strange love very sore,<br> Despite the past and future. So he went<br> Sad-eyed amid the hall's loud merriment<br> Unto her bower on that last morn of all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone she was, her head against the wall<br> Had fallen; her heavy eyes were shut when he<br> Stood on the threshold; she rose quietly,<br> Hearing the clash of arms, and took his hand,<br> And thus with quivering lips awhile did stand<br> Regarding him: but he made little show<br> Of manliness, but let the hot tears flow<br> Fast o&#146;er his cheeks. At last she spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weep then!<br> If thou who art the kindest of all men<br> Must sorrow for me, yet more glad were I<br> To see thee leave my bower joyfully<br> This last time; that when o&#146;er thee sorrow came,<br> And thought of me therewith, thou mightst not blame<br> My little love for ever saddening thee.<br> Love!&#151;let me say love once&#151;great shalt thou be,<br> Beloved of all, and dying ne&#146;er forgot.<br> Farewell! farewell! farewell! and think thou not<br> That in my heart there lingers any hate<br> Of her who through these years for thee did wait,<br> A weary waiting&#151;three long, long, long years,<br> Well over now; nay when of me she hears,<br> Fain were I she should hate me not. Behold,<br> Here is a coif, well wrought of silk and gold <A NAME="page_423"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 423</FONT></A><br> By folk of Micklegarth, who had no thought<br> Of thee or me, and thence by merchants brought<br> Who perchance loved not. Is Gudrun too fair<br> To take this thing, a queen might long to wear?<br> Upon the day when on the bench ye sit,<br> Hand held in hand, crown her fair head with it,<br> And tell her whence thou hadst it. Ah, farewell,<br> Lest of mine eyes thou shouldst have worse to tell<br> Than now thou hast!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she turned from him<br> And took the coif, wherein the gold was dim<br> With changing silken threads, the linen white<br> Scarce seen amid the silk and gold delight.<br> With hands that trembled little did she fold<br> The precious thing, and set its weight of gold<br> Within a silken bag; and then to his<br> She reached her hands, and in one bitter kiss<br> Tasted his tears, while a great wave of thought<br> Of what sweet things the changed years might have brought<br> Swept over her&#151;and then she knew him gone,<br> And yet for all that scarcely felt more lone<br> Than for a many days past she had felt.<br> So with fixed eyes she drew into her belt<br> Her kirtle, and to this and that thing turned<br> With heart that ever for the long rest yearned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing that gift, but heeding not what thing<br> He had with him, came Kiartan to the king, <A NAME="page_424"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 424</FONT></A><br> Who in the porch abode him, his great men<br> Standing around; then said he:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome then<br> This last day that I see thee; go we forth,<br> Fair lords, and see his ship's head greet the north,<br> For seldom from the north shall any come<br> Like unto him to greet us in our home."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So forth they went, and all the Iceland men<br> Gat them aboard, and skipper K&aacute;lf by then<br> Stood midway on the last bridge, while the king<br> &#146;Gan say to Kiartan:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many a treasured thing<br> Had I laid down, O friend, to keep thee here,<br> But since the old thing still must be more dear<br> Than the new thing, to such men as thou art,<br> Now, with my goodwill, to thy love depart,<br> And leave me here the coming woes to meet<br> Without thee. May thy life be fair and sweet,<br> Nor yet drag on till present days are nought,<br> And all the past days a tormenting thought!<br> Take this last gift of me; a noble sword,<br> Which if thou dost according to my word,<br> Shall never leave thy side; for who can know<br> Ere all is o&#146;er, how madly things may go?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Kiartan took the sword, and thanked the king,<br> With no light heart, for that and everything<br> That at his hands he had, and therewith crossed <A NAME="page_425"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 425</FONT></A><br> The gangway; shoreward were the hawsers tossed,<br> The long sweeps smote the water, and the crew<br> Shouted their last farewell; the white sail drew,<br> &#146;Twixt Norway and the stern, swept in the sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the king, and long time earnestly<br> Looked on the lessening ship; then said at last,<br> As o&#146;er his knitted brow his hand he passed:<br> "Go thy ways, Kiartan; great thou art indeed,<br> And great thy kin are, nathless shalt thou need<br> Stout heart enough to meet what waiteth thee<br> If aught mine eyes of things to come may see."</p>
