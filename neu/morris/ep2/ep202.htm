<p>O COME at last, to whom the spring-tide's hope<br> Looked for through blossoms, what hast thou for me?<br> Green grows the grass upon the dewy slope<br> Beneath thy gold-hung, grey-leaved apple-tree<br> Moveless, e&#146;en as the autumn fain would be<br> That shades its sad eyes from the rising sun<br> And weeps at eve because the day is done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What vision wilt thou give me, autumn morn,<br> To make thy pensive sweetness more complete?<br> What tale, ne&#146;er to be told, of folk unborn?<br> What images of grey-clad damsels sweet<br> Shall cross thy sward with dainty noiseless feet?<br> What nameless shamefast longings made alive<br> Soft-eyed September will thy sad heart give?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look long, O longing eyes, and look in vain!<br> Strain idly, aching heart, and yet be wise,<br> And hope no more for things to come again<br> That thou beheldest once with careless eyes!<br> Like a new-wakened man thou art, who tries<br> To dream again the dream that made him glad<br> When in his arms his loving love he had. <A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>MID young September's fruit-trees next they met,<br> With calm hearts, willing such things to forget<br> As men had best forget; and certainly<br> E&#146;en such a day it was when this might be<br> If e&#146;er it might be; fair, without a cloud,<br> Yet windless, so that a grey haze did shroud<br> The bright blue; neither burning overmuch,<br> Nor chill, the blood of those old folk to touch<br> With fretful, restless memory of despair.<br> Withal no promise of the fruitful year<br> Seemed unfulfilled in that fair autumn-tide;<br> The level ground along the river-side<br> Was merry through the day with sounds of those<br> Who gathered apples; o&#146;er the stream arose<br> The northward-looking slopes where the swine ranged<br> Over the fields that hook and scythe had changed<br> Since the last month; but &#146;twixt the tree-boles grey<br> Above them did they see the terraced way,<br> And over that the vine-stocks, row on row,<br> Whose dusty leaves, well thinned and yellowing now,<br> But little hid the bright-bloomed vine-bunches.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There day-long &#146;neath the shadows of the trees<br> Those elders sat; chary of speech they were,<br> For good it seemed to watch the young folk there,<br> Not so much busied with their harvesting, <A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A><br> But o&#146;er their baskets they might stop to sing;<br> Nor for the end of labour all so fain<br> But eyes of men from eyes of maids might gain<br> Some look desired.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the midday those<br> Who played with labour in the deep green close<br> Stinted their gathering for a while to eat;<br> Then to the elders did it seem most meet<br> Amidst of these to set forth what they might<br> Of lore remembered, and to let the night<br> Bury its own dead thoughts with wine and sleep;<br> So while the loitering autumn sun did creep<br> O&#146;er flower-crowned heads, and past sweet eyes of grey,<br> And eager lips, and fresh round limbs that lay<br> Amid the golden fruit&#151;fruit sweet and fair<br> Themselves, that happy days and love did bear<br> And life unburdened&#151;while the failing sun<br> Drew up the light clouds, was this tale begun,<br> Sad, but not sad enow to load the yoke,<br> E&#146;en by a feather's weight, of those old folk.<br> Sad, and believed but for its sweetness' sake<br> By the young folk, desiring not to break<br> The spell that sorrow's image cast on them,<br> As dreamlike she went past with fluttering hem.</p>
