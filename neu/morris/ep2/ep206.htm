<p><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE STORY OF ACCONTIUS AND CYDIPPE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">A CERTAIN man coming to Delos beheld a noble damsel there, and was smitten with the love of her, and made all things of no account but the winning of her, which at last he brought about in strange wise.</FONT></p>  
<p>A CERTAIN island-man of old,<br> Well fashioned, young, and wise and bold,<br> Voyaged awhile in Greekish seas,<br> Till Delos of the Cyclades<br> His keel made, and ashore he went;<br> And, wandering with no fixed intent,<br> With others of the shipmen there,<br> They came into a garden fair,<br> Too sweet for sea-tossed men, I deem,<br> If they would scape the lovesome dream<br> That youth and May cast o&#146;er the earth,<br> If they would keep their careless mirth<br> For hands of eld to deal withal.</p>  
<p>So in that close did it befall <A NAME="page_164 "><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164 </FONT></A><br> That &#146;neath the trees well wrought of May<br> These sat amidmost of the day<br> Not dry-lipped, and belike a-strain,<br> All gifts of that sweet time to gain,<br> And yet not finding all enow<br> That at their feet the May did throw,<br> But longing, half-expecting still<br> Some new delight their cup to fill&#151;<br> Yea, overfill, to make all strange<br> Their lazy joy with piercing change.<br> Therewith their youngest, even he<br> I told of first, all suddenly<br> &#146;Gan sing a song that fitted well<br> The thoughts that each man's heart did tell<br> Unto itself, and as his throat<br> Moved with the music, did he note<br> Through half-shut eyes a company<br> Of white-armed maidens drawing nigh,<br> Well marshalled, as if there they went<br> Upon some serious work intent.</p>  
<p align="center">SONG.</p>  
<p><i>FAIR is the night and fair the day,<br> Now April is forgot of May,<br> Now into June May falls away;<br> Fair day, fair night, O give me back<br> The tide that all fair things did lack<br> Except my love, except my sweet!</i> <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blow back, O wind! thou art not kind,<br> Though thou art sweet; thou hast no mind<br> Her hair about my sweet to wind;<br> O flowery sward, though thou art bright,<br> I praise thee not for thy delight,<br> Thou hast not kissed her silver feet.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou know&#146;st her not, O rustling tree,<br> What dost thou then to shadow me,<br> Whose shade her breast did never see?<br> O flowers, in vain ye bow adown!<br> Ye have not felt her odorous gown<br> Brush past your heads my lips to meet.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow on, great river&#151;thou mayst deem<br> That far away, a summer stream,<br> Thou sawest her limbs amidst thee gleam,<br> And kissed her foot, and kissed her knee,<br> Yet get thee swift unto the sea!<br> With nought of true thou wilt me greet.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou that men call by my name,<br> O helpless one, hast thou no shame<br> That thou must even look the same,<br> As while agone, as while agone,<br> When thou and she were left alone,<br> And hands, and lips, and tears did meet?</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow weak and pine, lie down to die,<br> O body in thy misery,,<br> Because short time and sweet goes by;</i> <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A><br> <i>O foolish heart, how weak thou art!<br> Break, break, because thou needs must part<br> From thine own love, from thine own sweet!</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it that through half-shut eyes<br> Pierced to his heart, and made him rise<br> As one the July storm awakes<br> When through the dawn the thunder breaks?<br> What was it that the languor clove,<br> Wherewith unhurt he sang of love?<br> How was it that his eyes had caught<br> Her eyes alone of all; that nought<br> The others were but images,<br> While she, while she amidst of these<br> Not first or last&#151;when she was gone,<br> Why must he feel so left alone?<br> An image in his heart there was<br> Of how amidst them one did pass<br> Kind-eyed and soft, and looked at him;<br> And now the world was waxen dim<br> About him, and of little worth,<br> Seemed all the wondrous things of earth,<br> And fain would he be all alone,<br> To wonder why his mirth was gone;<br> To wonder why it seemed so strange<br> That in nought else was any change,<br> When his old life seemed passed away,<br> And joy in narrow compass lay, <A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A><br> He scarce knew where. With laugh and song<br> His fellows mocked the dim world's wrong,<br> Nor noted him as changed o&#146;ermuch;<br> Or if their jests his mood did touch,<br> To his great wonder lightly they<br> By stammering word were turned away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, from the close they went at last,<br> And through the noble town they passed,<br> And saw the wonders wrought of old<br> Therein, and heard famed stories told<br> Of many a thing; and as a dream<br> Did all things to Accontius seem.<br> But when night's wings came o&#146;er that place,<br> And men slept, piteous seemed his case<br> And wonderful, that therewithal<br> Night helped him not. From wall to wall<br> Night-long his weary eyes he turned,<br> Till in the east the daylight burned.<br> And then the pang he would not name,<br> Stung by the world's change, fiercer came<br> Across him, and in haste he rose,<br> Driven unto that flowery close<br> By restless longing, knowing not<br> What part therein his heart had got,<br> Nor why he thitherward must wend.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now had night's last hope an end,<br> When to the garden-gate he came. <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A><br> In grey light did the tulip flame<br> Over the sward made grey with dew,<br> And as unto the place he drew<br> Where yesterday he sang that song<br> The ousel-cock sang sweet and strong,<br> Though almost ere the sky grew grey<br> Had he begun to greet the day.<br> There now, as by some strong spell bound,<br> Accontius paced that spot of ground,<br> Restless, with wild thoughts in his head;<br> While round about the white-thorn shed<br> Sweet fragrance, and the lovely place,<br> Lonely of mankind, lacked no grace<br> That love for his own home would have.<br> Well sang the birds, the light wind drave<br> Through the fresh leaves, untouched as yet<br> By summer and its vain regret;<br> Well piped the wind, and as it swept<br> The garden through, no sweet thing slept,<br> Nor might the scent of blossoms hide<br> The fresh smell of the country side<br> It bore with it; and the green bay,<br> Whose breast it kissed so far away,<br> Spake sometimes yet amid the noise<br> Of rustling leaves and song-birds' voice.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there awhile our man did pace,<br> Still wondering at his piteous case<br> That, certes, not to anyone <A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A><br> Had happed before&#151;awhile agone<br> So pleased to watch the world pass by<br> With all its changing imagery;<br> So hot to play his part therein,<br> From each day's death good life to win;<br> And now, with a great sigh, he saw<br> The yellow level sunbeams draw<br> Across the wet grass, as the sun<br> First smote the trees, and day begun<br> Smiled on the world, whose summer bliss<br> In nowise seemed to better his.<br> Then, as he thought thereof, he said:<br> "Surely all wisdom is clean dead<br> Within me. Nought I lack that I,<br> By striving, may not come anigh<br> Among the things that men desire;<br> And why, then, like a burnt-out fire,<br> Is my life grown?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as he spoke<br> A throstle-cock beside him broke<br> Into the sweetest of his song,<br> Yet with his sweet note seemed to wrong<br> The unknown trouble of that morn,<br> And made him feel yet more forlorn.<br> Then he cried out, "O fool, go forth!<br> The world is grown of no less worth<br> Than yester-morn it was; go then<br> And play thy part among brave men<br> As thou hadst will to do before <A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A><br> Thy feet first touched this charmed shore<br> Where all is changed."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the bird<br> Flew from beside him, and he heard<br> A rustling nigh, although the breeze<br> Had died out mid the thick-leaved trees.<br> Therewith he raised his eyes and turned,<br> And a great fire within him burned,<br> And his heart stopped awhile, for there,<br> Against a flowering thorn-bush fair,<br> Hidden by tulips to the knee,<br> His heart's desire his eyes did see.<br> Clad was she e&#146;en as is the dove,<br> Who makes the summer sad with love;<br> High-girded as one hastening<br> In swift search for some longed-for thing;<br> Her hair drawn by a silken band<br> From her white neck, and in her hand<br> A myrtle-spray. Panting she was<br> As from the daisies of the grass<br> She raised her eyes, and looked around<br> Till the astonished eyes she found<br> That saw not aught but even her.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in a silence hard to bear,<br> Impossible to break, they stood,<br> With faces changed by love, and blood<br> So stirred, that many a year of life<br> Had been made eager with that strife <A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A><br> Of minutes; and so nigh she was<br> He saw the little blue veins pass<br> Over her heaving breast; and she<br> The trembling of his lips might see,<br> The rising tears within his eyes.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then standing there in mazed wise<br> He saw the black-heart tulips bow<br> Before her knees, as wavering now<br> A half-step unto him she made.<br> With a glad cry, though half afraid,<br> He stretched his arms out, and the twain,<br> E&#146;en at the birth of love's great pain,<br> Each unto each-so nigh were grown,<br> That little lacked to make them one&#151;<br> That little lacked but they should be<br> Wedded that hour; knee touching knee,<br> Cheek laid to cheek. So seldom fare<br> Love's tales, that men are wise to dare;<br> Rather, dull hours must pass away,<br> And heavy day succeed to day,<br> And much be changed by misery,<br> Ere two that love may draw anigh-<br> And so with these. What fear or shame<br> &#146;Twixt longing heart and body came<br> &#146;T were hard to tell&#151;they lingered yet.<br> Well-nigh they deemed that they had met,<br> And that the worst was o&#146;er; e&#146;en then<br> There drew anigh the sound of men&#151; <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A><br> Loud laugh, harsh talk. With ill surprise ,<br> He saw fear change her lovesome eyes;<br> He knew her heart bethought it now<br> Of other folk, and ills that grow<br> From overmuch of love; but he<br> Cried out amidst his agony,<br> Yet stood there helpless, and withal<br> A mist across his eyes did fall,<br> And all seemed lost indeed, as now<br> Slim tulip-stem and hawthorn-bough<br> Slipped rustling back into their place,<br> And all the glory of her face<br> Had left the world, at least awhile,<br> And once more all was base and vile.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, indeed, when that sharp pain<br> Was something dulled, and once again<br> Thought helped him, then to him it seemed<br> That she had dreamed as he had dreamed,<br> And, hoping not for any sight<br> Of love, had come made soft by night,<br> Made kind by longings unconfessed,<br> To give him good hope of the best.<br> Then pity came to help his love,<br> For now, indeed, he knew whereof<br> He sickened; pity came, and then<br> The fear of the rough sons of men,<br> Sore hate of things that needs must part<br> The loving heart from loving heart;<A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A><br> And at each turn it seemed as though<br> Fate some huge net round both did throw<br> To stay their feet and dim their sight<br> Till they were clutched by endless night;<br> And then he fain had torn his hair,<br> And cried aloud in his despair,<br> But stayed himself as still he thought<br> How even that should help him nought,<br> That helpless patience needs must be<br> His loathed fellow. Wearily<br> He got him then from out the place,<br> Made lovely by her scarce-seen face,<br> And knew that day what longing meant.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the restless daylight went<br> From earth's face, through the weary night<br> He lay again in just such plight<br> As on the last night he had lain;<br> But deemed that he would go again<br> At daylight to that place of flowers.<br> So passed the night through all its hours,<br> But ere the dawn came, weak and worn<br> He fell asleep, nor woke that morn<br> Till all the city was astir;<br> And waking must he think of her<br> Stolen to that place to find, to find him not&#151;<br> Her parted lips, her face flushed hot,<br> Her panting breast and girt-up gown,<br> Her sleeve ill-fastened, fallen adown <A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A><br> From one white shoulder, her grey eyes<br> Fixed in their misery of surprise,<br> As nought they saw but birds and trees;<br> Her woeful lingering, as the breeze<br> Died &#146;neath the growing sun, and folk<br> Fresh silence of the morning broke;<br> And then, the death of hope confessed,<br> The quivering lip and heaving breast,<br> The burst of tears, the homeward way<br> Made hateful by joy past away,<br> The dreary day made dull and long<br> By hope deferred and gathering wrong.<br> All this for him!&#151;and thinking thus<br> Their twinlife seemed so piteous<br> That all his manhood from him fled,<br> And cast adown upon the bed<br> He sobbed and wept full sore, until<br> When he of grief had had his fill<br> He &#146;gan to think that he might see<br> His love, and cure her misery<br> If she should be in that same place<br> At that same hour when first her face<br> Shone on him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So time wore away<br> Till on the world the high noon lay,<br> And then at the due place he stood,<br> Wondering amid his love-sick mood<br> Which blades of grass her foot had bent;<br> And there, as to and fro he went, <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A><br> A certain man who seemed to be<br> A fisher on the troubled sea,<br> An old man and a poor, came nigh<br> And greeted him and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hereby<br> Thou doest well to stand, my son,<br> Since thy stay here will soon be done,<br> If of that ship of Crete thou be,<br> As well I deem. Here shalt thou see<br> Each day at noon a company<br> Of all our fairest maids draw nigh;<br> To such an one each day they go<br> As best can tell them how to do<br> In serving of the dreadful queen,<br> Whose servant long years bath she been,<br> And dwelleth by her chapel fair<br> Within this close; they shall be here,<br> E&#146;en while I speak. Wot well, fair son,<br> Good need it is this should be done,<br> For whatso hasty word is said<br> That day unto the moon-crowned maid,<br> For such an oath is held, as though<br> The whole heart into it did go&#151;<br> Behold, they come! A goodly sight<br> Shalt thou have seen, e&#146;en if to-night<br> Thou diest!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grew Accontius wan<br> As the sea-cliffs, for the old man<br> Now pointed to the gate, wherethrough <A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A><br> The company of maidens drew<br> Toward where they stood; Accontius,<br> With trembling lips, and piteous<br> Drawn brow, turned toward them, and afar<br> Beheld her like the morning-star<br> Amid the weary stars of night.<br> Midmost the band went his delight,<br> Clad in a gown of blue, whereon<br> Were wrought fresh flowers, as newly won<br> From the May fields; with one hand she<br> Touched a fair fellow lovingly,<br> The other, hung adown, did hold<br> An ivory harp well strung with gold;<br> Gaily she went, nor seemed as though<br> One troublous thought her heart did know.<br> Accontius sickened as she came<br> Anigh him, and with heart aflame<br> For very rage of jealousy,<br> He heard her talking merrily<br> Unto her fellow&#151;the first word<br> From those sweet lips he yet had heard,<br> Nor might he know what thing she said;<br> Yet presently she turned her head<br> And saw him, and her talk she stopped<br> E&#146;en therewith, and her lips down dropped,<br> And trembling amid love and shame<br> Over her face a bright flush came;<br> Nathless without another look<br> She passed him by, whose whole frame shook <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A><br> With passion as an aspen leaf.<br> But she being gone, all blind with grief,<br> He stood there long, and muttered:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why<br> Would she not note my misery?<br> Had it been then so hard to turn<br> And show me that her heart did yearn<br> For something nigher like mine own?<br> O well content to leave me lone,<br> O well content to stand apart,<br> And nurse a pleasure in thine heart,<br> The joy of being so well beloved,<br> Still taking care thou art not moved<br> By aught like trouble!&#151;yet beware,<br> For thou mayst fall for all thy care!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the place he turned away;<br> Some secret spell he deemed there lay,<br> Some bar unseen athwart that grass,<br> O&#146;er which his feet might never pass<br> Whatso his heart bade. Hour by hour<br> Passed of the day, and ever slower<br> They seemed to pass, and ever he<br> Thought of her last look wearily&#151;<br> Now meant it that, now meant it this;<br> Now bliss, and now the death of bliss.<br> 'But O, if once again,' he thought,<br> 'Face unto face we might be brought, <A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A><br> Then doubt I not but I should read<br> What at her hands would be my meed,<br> And in such wise my life would guide;<br> Either the weary end to bide<br> E&#146;en as I might, or strengthen me<br> To take the sweet felicity,<br> Casting by thought of fear or death&#151;<br> But now when I must hold my breath,<br> Who knows how long, while scale mocks scale<br> With trembling joy, and trembling bale<br> O hard to bear! O hard to bear!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, knowing bitter fear<br> And hopeful longing's sharp distress,<br> But not the weight of hopelessness.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now there passed by three days more,<br> And to the flowery place that bore<br> The sharp and sweet of his desire<br> Each day he went, his heart afire<br> With foolish hope. Each day he saw<br> The band of damsels toward him draw,<br> And trembling said, "Now, now at last<br> Surely her white arms will be cast<br> About my neck before them all;<br> Or at the worst her eyes will call<br> My feet to follow. Can it be<br> That she can bear my misery,<br> When of my heart she surely knows?" <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A><br> And every day midmost the close<br> They met, and on the first day she<br> Did look upon him furtively<br> In loving wise; and through his heart<br> Love sent a pleasure-pointed dart&#151;<br> A minute, and away she went,<br> And left him nowise more content<br> Than erst he had been.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day<br> Needs must she flush and turn away<br> Before their eyes met, and he stood<br> When she was gone in wretched mood,<br> Faint with desire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third hope came,<br> And then his hungry eyes, aflame<br> With longing wild, beheld her pass<br> As though amidst a dream she was;<br> Then e&#146;en ere she had left the place<br> With his clenched hand he smote his face,<br> And void of everything but pain,<br> Through the thronged streets the sea did gain,<br> Not recking aught, and there at last<br> His body on the sand he cast,<br> Nigh the green waves, till in the end<br> Some thought the crushing cloud did rend,<br> And down the tears 'rushed from his eyes<br> For ruth of his own miseries;<br> And with the tears came thought again<br> To mingle with his formless pain <A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A><br> And hope withal&#151;but yet more fear,<br> For he bethought him now that near<br> The time drew for his ship to sail.<br> Yet was the thought of some avail<br> To heal the unreason of his 'heart,<br> For now he needs must play a part<br> Wherein was something to be done,<br> If he would not be left alone<br> Life-long, with love unsatisfied.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now he rose, and looking wide<br> Along the edges of the bay,<br> Saw where his fellows&#146; tall ship lay<br> Anigh the haven, and a boat<br> &#146;Twixt shore and ship-side did there float<br> With balanced oars; but on the shroud<br> A shipman stood, and shouted loud<br> Unto the boat&#151;words lost, in sooth,<br> But which no less the trembling youth<br> Deemed certainly of him must be<br> And where he was; then suddenly<br> He turned, though none pursued, and fled<br> Along the sands, nor turned his head<br> Till round a headland he did reach<br> A long cove with a sandy beach;<br> Then looking landward he saw where<br> A streamlet cleft the sea-cliffs bare,<br> Making a little valley green,<br> Beset with thorn-trees; and between <A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A><br> The yellow strand and cliff's grey brow<br> Was built a cottage white and low<br> Within a little close, upon<br> The green slope that the stream had won<br> From rock and sea; and thereby stood<br> A fisher, whose grey homespun hood<br> Covered white locks: so presently<br> Accontius to that man drew nigh,<br> Because he seemed the man to be<br> Who told of that fair company,<br> Deeming that more might there be learned<br> About the flame wherewith he burned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal he found it even so,<br> And that the old man him did know,<br> And greeted him, and fell to talk,<br> As such folk will of things that balk<br> The poor man's fortune, waves and winds,<br> And changing days and great men's minds;<br> And at the last it so befell<br> That this Accontius came to tell<br> A tale unto the man&#151;how he<br> Was fain to &#146;scape the uneasy sea,<br> And those his fellows, and would give<br> Gold unto him, that he might live<br> In hiding there, till they had sailed.<br> Not strange it was if he prevailed<br> In few words, though the elder smiled<br> As not all utterly beguiled, <A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A><br> Nor curious therewithal to know<br> Such things as he cared not to show.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there alone a while he dwelt,<br> And lonely there, all torment felt,<br> As still his longing grew and grew;<br> And ever as hot noontide drew<br> From dewy dawn and sunny morn,<br> He felt himself the most forlorn;<br> For then the best he pictured her:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now the noon wind, the scent-bearer<br> Is busy midst her gown," he said,<br> "The fresh-plucked flowers about her head<br> Are drooping now with their desire;<br> The grass with unconsuming fire<br> Faints &#146;neath the pressure of her feet;<br> The honey-bees her lips would meet,<br> But fail for fear; the swift's bright eyes<br> Are eager round the mysteries<br> Of the fair hidden fragrant breast,<br> Where now alone may I know rest&#151;<br> &#151;Ah pity me, thou pityless!<br> Bless me who know&#146;st not how to bless;<br> Fall from thy height, thou highest of all,<br> On me a very wretch to call!<br> Thou, to whom all things fate doth give,<br> Find without me thou canst not live!<br> Desire me, O thou world's desire, <A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A><br> Light thy pure heart at this base fire!<br> Save me, save me, thou knowest nought,<br> Of whom thou never hadst a thought!<br> O queen of all the world, stoop down,<br> Before my feet cast thou thy crown!<br> Speak to me, as I speak to thee!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked beside the summer sea<br> As thus he spake, at eventide;<br> Across the waste of waters wide;<br> The dead sun's light a wonder cast,<br> That into grey night faded fast;<br> And ever as the shadows fell,<br> More formless grew the unbreaking swell<br> Far out to sea; more strange and white,<br> More vocal through the hushing night,<br> The narrow line of changing foam,<br> That &#146;twixt the sand and fishes&#146; home<br> Writhed, driven onward by the tide&#151;<br> &#151;So slowly by the ocean's side<br> He paced, till dreamy passion grew;<br> The soft wind o&#146;er the sea that blew,<br> Dried the cold tears upon his face,<br> Kindly if sad seemed that lone place,<br> Yea, in a while it scarce seemed lone,<br> When now at last the white moon shone<br> Upon the sea, and showed that still<br> It quivered, though a moveless hill<br> A little while ago it seemed. <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, turning homeward now, he dreamed<br> Of many a help and miracle,<br> That in the olden time befell<br> Unto love's servants; e&#146;en when he<br> Had clomb the hill anigh the sea,<br> And reached the hut now litten bright,<br> Not utterly with food and light<br> And common talk his dream passed by.<br> Yea, and with all this, presently<br> &#146;Gan tell the old man when it was<br> That the great feast should come to pass<br> Unto Diana: Yea, and then<br> He, among all the sons of men,<br> E&#146;en of that very love must speak;<br> Then grew Accontius faint and weak,<br> And his mouth twitched, and tears began<br> To pain his eyes; for the old man,<br> As one possessed, went on to tell<br> Of all the loveliness that well<br> Accontius wotted of, and now<br> For the first time he came to know<br> What name among her folk she had,<br> And, half in cruel pain, half glad,<br> He heard the old man say:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indeed<br> This sweet Cydippe bath great need<br> Of one to save her life from woe,<br> Because or ere the brook shall flow<br> Narrow with August &#146;twixt its banks, <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A><br> Her folk, to win Diana's thanks,<br> Shall make her hers, and she shall be<br> Honoured of all folk certainly,<br> But unwed, shrunk as time goes on<br> Into a sour-hearted crone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accontius &#146;gan the room to pace<br> Ere he had done; with curious face<br> The old man gazed, but uttered nought;<br> Then in his heart Accontius thought,<br> "Ah when her image passeth by<br> Like a sweet breath, the blinded eye<br> Gains sight, the deaf man heareth well,<br> The dumb man lovesome tales can tell,<br> Hopes dead for long rise from their tombs,<br> The barren like a garden blooms;<br> And I alone&#151;I sit and wait,<br> With deedless hands, on black-winged fate."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, when men had done with day,<br> Sleepless upon his bed he lay,<br> Striving to think if aught might move<br> Hard fate to give him his own love;<br> And thought of what would do belike,<br> And said, "Tomorrow will I strike<br> Before the iron groweth dull."<br> And so, with mind of strange things full,<br> Just at the dawn he fell asleep,<br> Yet as the shadows &#146;gan to creep <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A><br> Up the long slope before the sun,<br> His blinking, troubled sleep was done;<br> And with a start he sat upright,<br> Now deeming that the glowing light<br> Was autumn's very sun, that all<br> Of ill had happed that could befall;<br> Yet fully waked up at the last,<br> From out the cottage-door he passed,<br> And saw how the old fisherman<br> His coble through the low surf ran<br> And shouted greeting from the sea;<br> Then &#146;neath an ancient apple-tree,<br> That on the little grassy slope<br> Stood speckled with the autumn's hope<br> He cast him down, and slept again;<br> And sleeping dreamed about his pain,<br> Yet in the same place seemed to be,<br> Beneath the ancient apple-tree.<br> So in his dream he heard a sound<br> Of singing fill the air around,<br> And yet saw nought; till in a while<br> The twinkling sea's uncounted smile<br> Was hidden by a rosy cloud,<br> That seemed some wondrous thing to shroud,<br> For in its midst a bright spot grew<br> Brighter and brighter, and still drew<br> Unto Accontius, till at last<br> A woman from amidst it passed,<br> And, wonderful in nakedness, <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A><br> With rosy feet the grass did press,<br> And drew anigh; he durst not move<br> Or speak, because the Queen of Love<br> He deemed he knew; she smiled on him,<br> And, even as his dream waxed dim,<br> Upon the tree-trunk gnarled and grey<br> A slim hand for a while did lay;<br> Then all waxed dark, and then once more<br> He lay there as he lay before,<br> But all burnt up the green-sward was,<br> And songless did the throstle pass<br> &#146;Twixt dark green leaf and golden fruit,<br> And at the old tree's knotted root<br> The basket of the gatherer<br> Lay, as though autumn-tide were there.<br> Then in his dream he thought he strove<br> To speak that sweet name of his love<br> Late learned, but could not; for away<br> Sleep passed, and now in sooth he lay<br> Awake within the shadow sweet,<br> The sunlight creeping o&#146;er his feet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he arose to think upon<br> The plans that he from night had won,<br> And still in each day found a flaw<br> That night's half-dreaming eyes ne&#146;er saw,<br> And far away all good hope seemed,<br> And the strange dream he late had dreamed<br> Of no account he made, but thought <A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A>.<br> That it had come and gone for nought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the time went by till he<br> Knew that his keel had put to sea,<br> Yet after that a day or two<br> He waited, ere he dared to do<br> The thing he longed for most, and meet<br> His love within the garden sweet.<br> He saw her there, he saw a smile<br> The paleness of her face beguile<br> Before she saw him; then his heart<br> With pity and remorse &#146;gan smart;<br> But when at last she turned her head,<br> And he beheld the bright flush spread<br> Over her face, and once again<br> The pallor come, &#146;twixt joy and pain<br> His heart was torn; he turned away,<br> Thinking: "Long time ere that worst day<br> That unto her a misery<br> Will be, yea even as unto me,<br> And many a thing ere then may fall,<br> Or peaceful death may end it all."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host that night his heart did bless<br> With praises of her loveliness<br> Once more, and said: "Fools men are<br> Who work themselves such bitter care<br> That they may live when they are dead;<br> Her mother's stern cold hardihead <A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A><br> Shall make this sweet but dead-alive;<br> For who in all the world shall strive<br> With such an oath as she shall make?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accontius, for self-pity's sake,<br> Must steal forth to the night to cry<br> Some wordless prayer of agony;<br> And yet, when he was come again,<br> Of more of such-like speech was fain,<br> And needs must stammer forth some word,<br> That once more the old fisher stirred<br> To speech; who now began to tell<br> Tales of that oath as things known well,<br> To wise men from the days of old,<br> Of how a mere chance-word would hold<br> Some poor wretch as a life-long slave;<br> Nay, or the very wind that drave<br> Some garment's hem, some lock of hair<br> Against the dreadful altar there,<br> Had turned a whole sweet life to ill;<br> So heedfully must all fulfil<br> Their vows unto the dreadful maid.<br> Accontius heard the words he said<br> As through a thin sleep fraught with dreams,<br> Yet afterward would fleeting gleams<br> Of what the old man said confuse<br> His weary heart, that ne&#146;er was loose<br> A minute from the bonds of love,<br> And still of all, strange dreams he wove. <A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the time passed; a brooding life<br> That with his love might hold no strife<br> Accontius led; he did not spare<br> With torment vain his soul to tear<br> By meeting her in that same place:<br> No fickle hope now changed her face,<br> No hot desire therein did burn,<br> Rather it seemed her heart did yearn<br> With constant sorrow, and such love<br> As surely might the hard world move.<br> &#151;Ah! shall it? Love shall go its ways,<br> And sometimes gather useless praise<br> From joyful hearts, when now at rest<br> The lover lies, but oftenest<br> To hate thereby the world is moved,<br> But oftenest the well-beloved<br> Shall pay the kiss back with a blow,<br> Shall smile to see the hot tears flow,<br> Shall answer with scarce-hidden scorn<br> The bitter words by anguish torn<br> From such a heart, as fain would rest<br> Silent until death brings the best.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So drew the time on to the day<br> When all hope must be cast away;<br> Late summer now was come, and still<br> As heeding neither good or ill<br> Of living men, the stream ran down<br> The green slope to the sea-side brown, <A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A><br> Singing its changeless song; still there<br> Accontius dwelt &#146;twixt slope-side fair<br> And changing murmur of the sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night before all misery<br> Should be accomplished, red-eyed, wan,<br> He gave unto the ancient man<br> What wealth he had, and bade farewell<br> In such a voice as tale doth tell<br> Unto the wise; then to his bed<br> He crept, and still his weary head<br> Tossed on the pillow, till the dawn<br> The fruitful mist from earth had drawn.<br> Once more with coming light he slept,<br> Once more from out his bed he leapt,<br> Thinking that he had slept too fast,<br> And that all hope was over-past;<br> And with that thought he knew indeed<br> How good is hope to man at need,<br> Yea, even the least ray thereof.<br> Then dizzy with the pain of love<br> He went from out the door, and stood<br> Silent within the fruitful rood.<br> Still was the sunny morn and fair,<br> A scented haze was in the air;<br> So soft it was, it seemed as spring<br> Had come once more her arms to fling<br> About the dying year, and kiss<br> The lost world into dreams of bliss. <A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now &#146;neath the tree he sank adown,<br> Parched was the sward thereby and brown,<br> Save where about the knotted root<br> A green place spread. The golden fruit<br> Hung on the boughs, lay on the ground;<br> The spring-born thrushes lurked around,<br> But sang not, yet the stream sang well,<br> And gentle tales the sea could tell.<br> Ere sunrise was the fisher gone,<br> And now his brown-sailed boat alone,<br> Some league or so from off the shore,<br> Moved slowly &#146;neath the sweeping oar.<br> So soothed by sights and sounds that day,<br> Sore weary, soon Accontius lay<br> In deep sleep as he erst had done,<br> And dreamed once more, nor yet had gone<br> E&#146;en this time from that spot of ground;<br> And once more dreaming heard the sound<br> Of unseen singers, and once more<br> A pink-tinged cloud spread thwart the shore,<br> And a vague memory touched him now<br> Amid his sleep; his knitted brow<br> &#146;Gan to unfold, a happy smile<br> His long love-languor did beguile<br> As from the cloud the naked one<br> Came smiling forth&#151;but not alone;<br> For now the image of his love,<br> Clad like the murmuring summer dove,<br> She held by the slim trembling hand, <A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A><br> And soon he deemed the twain did stand<br> Anigh his head. Round Venus&#146; feet<br> Outbroke the changing spring-flowers sweet<br> From the parched earth of autumn-tide;<br> The long locks round her naked side<br> The sea-wind drave; lily and rose,<br> Plucked from the heart of her own close,<br> Were girdle to her, and did cling,<br> Mixed with some marvellous golden thing,<br> About her neck and bosom white,<br> Sweeter than they; with eyes that bliss<br> Changed not, her doves brushed past to kiss<br> The marvel of her limbs; yet bright,<br> Fair beyond words as she might be,<br> So fell it by love's mystery<br> That open-mouthed Accontius lay<br> In that sweet dream, nor drew away<br> His eyes from his love's pitying eyes;<br> And at the last he strove to rise,<br> And dreamed that touch of hand in hand<br> Made his heart faint; alas! the band<br> Of soft sleep, overstrained therewith,<br> Snapped short, and left him there to writhe<br> In helpless woe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in a while<br> Strange thoughts anew did him beguile;<br> Well-nigh he dreamed again, and saw<br> The naked goddess toward him draw,<br> Until the sunshine touched his face <A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A><br> And stark awake in that same place<br> He sighed, and rose unto his knee,<br> And saw beneath the ancient tree,<br> Close by his hand, an apple lie,<br> Great, smooth, and golden. Dreamily<br> He turned it o&#146;er, and in like mood<br> A long sharp thorn, as red as blood,<br> He took into his hand, and then,<br> In language of the Grecian men,<br> Slowly upon its side he wrote,<br> As one who thereof took no note,<br> <i>Accontius will I wed to-day;</i><br> Then stealthily across the bay<br> He glanced, and trembling gat him down<br> With hurried steps unto the town,<br> Where for the high-tide folk were dight,<br> And all looked joyous there and bright,<br> As toward the fane their steps they bent.<br> And thither, too, Accontius went,<br> Scarce knowing if on earth or air<br> His feet were set; he coming there,<br> Gat nigh the altar standing-place,<br> And there with haggard eyes &#146;gan gaze<br> Upon the image of the maid<br> Whose wrath makes man and beast afraid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in a while the rites began,<br> And many a warrior and great man<br> Served the hard-hearted one, until <A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A><br> Of everything she had her fill<br> That Gods desire; and, trembling now,<br> Accontius heard the curved horns blow<br> That heralded the damsels&#146; band;<br> And scarce for faintness might he stand,<br> When now, the minstrels&#146; gowns of gold<br> Being past, he could withal behold<br> White raiment fluttering, and he saw<br> The fellows of his own love draw<br> Unto the altar; here and there<br> The mothers of those maidens fair<br> Went by them, proud belike, and fain<br> To note the honour they should gain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now scarce with hungry eyes might he<br> Gaze on those fair folk steadily,<br> As one by one they passed by him;<br> His limbs shook, and his eyes did swim,<br> And if he heard the words they said,<br> As outstretched hand and humble head<br> Strengthened the trembling maiden's vow,<br> Nought of their meaning did he know&#151;<br> &#151;And still she came not&#151;what was this?<br> Had the dull death of hope of bliss<br> Been her death too&#151;ah, was she dead?<br> Or did she lie upon her bed,<br> With panting mouth and fixed bright eyes,<br> Waiting the new life's great surprise,<br> All longings past, amid the hush <A NAME="page_196"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 196</FONT></A><br> Of life departing?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great rush<br> Of fearful pain stopped all his blood<br> As thus he thought; a while he stood<br> Blinded and tottering, then the air<br> A great change on it seemed to bear,<br> A heavenly scent; and fear was gone,<br> Hope but a name; as if alone<br> Mid images of men he was,&#151;<br> Alone with her who now did pass<br> With fluttering hem and light footfall<br> The corner of the precinct wall.<br> Time passed, she drew nigh to the place,<br> Where he was standing, and her face<br> Turned to him, and her steadfast eyes<br> Met his, with no more of surprise<br> Than if in words she had been told<br> That each the other should behold<br> E&#146;en in such wise&#151;Pale was she grown;<br> Her sweet breath, that an unheard moan<br> Seemed to her lover, scarce might win<br> Through her half-opened lips; most thin<br> The veil seemed &#146;twixt her mournful eyes,<br> And death's long-looked-for mysteries;<br> Frail were her blue-veined hands; her feet<br> The pink-tinged marble steps did meet<br> As though all will were gone from her.<br> There went a matron, tall and fair,<br> Noble to look on, by her side,<A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A><br> Like unto her, but for cold pride<br> And passing by of twenty years,<br> And all their putting back of tears;<br> Her mother, certes, and a glow<br> Of pleasure lit her stern face now<br> At what that day should see well done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, as the long train swept on,<br> There on the last step of the fane<br> She stood, so loved, so loved in vain;<br> Her mother fallen aback from her,<br> Yet eager the first word to hear<br> Of that her dreadful oath&#151;so nigh<br> Were misery to misery,<br> That each might hear the other's breath;<br> That they this side of fair hope's death<br> Might yet have clung breast unto breast,<br> And snatched from life a little rest,<br> And snatched a little joy from pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O weary hearts, shall all be vain,<br> Shall all be nought, this strife and love?<br> &#151;Once more with slow foot did she move<br> Unto the last step, with no sound<br> Unto Accontius turning round,<br> Who spake not, but, as moved at last<br> By some kind God, the apple cast<br> Into her bosom's folds&#151;once more<br> She stayed, while a great flush came o&#146;er <A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A><br> Her sweet face erst half-dead and wan;<br> Then went a sound from man to man<br> So fair she seemed, and some withal<br> Failed not to note the apple fall<br> Into her breast.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while with fear<br> And hope Accontius trembled there<br> And to her side her mother came,<br> She cast aside both fear and shame<br> From out her noble heart, and laid<br> Upon the altar of the maid<br> Her fair right hand, clasped firm around<br> The golden fruit, and with no sound<br> Her lips moved, and her eyes upraised<br> Upon the marble image gazed,<br> With such a fervour as if she<br> Would give the thing humanity<br> And love and pity&#151;then a space<br> Unto her love she turned her face<br> All full of love, as if to say,<br> "So ends our trouble from to-day,<br> Either with happy life or death."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet anxious still, with held-back breath,<br> He saw her mother come to her<br> With troubled eyes. "What hast thou there?"<br> He heard her say. "Is the vow made?<br> I heard no word that thou hast said?" <A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through him did her sweet voice thrill:<br> "No word I spake for good or ill;<br> But this spake for me; so say ye<br> What oath in written words may be;<br> Although, indeed, I wrote them nought;<br> And in my heart had got no thought,<br> When first I came hereto this morn,<br> But here to swear myself forlorn<br> Of love and hope&#151;because the days<br> Of life seemed but a weary maze,<br> Begun without leave asked of me,<br> Whose ending I might never see,<br> Or what came after them&#151;but now<br> Backward my life I will not throw<br> Into your deep-dug, spice-strewn grave,<br> But either all things will I save<br> This day, or make an end of all."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then silence on the place did fall;<br> With frowning face, yet hand that shook,<br> The fated fruit her mother took<br> From out her hand, and pale she grew,<br> When the few written words she knew,<br> And what they meant; but speedily<br> She brushed the holy altar by,<br> Unto the wondering priests to tell<br> What things there in their midst befell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in low words, they spoke awhile, <A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A><br> How they must deal with such a guile,<br> Cast by the goddess of desire<br> Into the holy maiden's fire.<br> And to the priests it seemed withal,<br> That a full oath they needs must call<br> That writing on the altar laid:<br> Then, wroth and fearful, some there bade<br> To seek a death for these to die,<br> If even so they might put by<br> The maid's dread anger; crueller<br> They grew as still they gathered fear,<br> And shameful things the dusk fane heard,<br> As grey beard wagged against grey beard,<br> And fiercer grew the ancient eyes.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the crowd, meanwhile, did rise<br> Great murmuring, for from man to man<br> The rumour of the story ran,<br> I know not how; and therewithal<br> Some god-sent lovesome joy did fall<br> On all hearts there, until it seemed<br> That each one of his own soul dreamed,<br> Beloved, and loving well; and when<br> Some cried out that the ancient men<br> Had mind too slay the lovers there,<br> A fierce shout rent the autumn air:<br> "Nay, wed the twain; love willeth it!"<br> But silent did the elders sit,<br> With death and fear on either hand, <A NAME="page_201"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201</FONT></A><br> Till one said, "Fear not, the whole land,<br> Not we, take back what they did give;<br> With many scarce can one man strive;<br> Let be, themselves shall make amends."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, let be," said the next; "all ends,<br> Despite the talk of mortal men,<br> Who deem themselves undying, when,<br> Urged by some unknown God's commands,<br> They snatch at love with eager hands,<br> And gather death that grows thereby,<br> Yet swear that love shall never die&#151;<br> Let be&#151;in their own hearts they bear<br> The seeds of pangs to pierce and tear.<br> What need, White-armed, to follow them,<br> With well-strung bow and fluttering hem,<br> Adown the tangle of life's wood?<br> Thou knowest what the fates deem good<br> For wretches that love overmuch&#151;<br> One mad desire for sight and touch;<br> One spot alone of all the earth<br> That seems to them of any worth;<br> One sound alone that they may bear<br> Amidst earth's joyful sounds to hear;<br> And sight, and sound, and dwelling-place,<br> And soft caressing of one face,<br> Forbidden, and forbidden still,<br> Or granted e&#146;en for greater ill,<br> But for a while, that they may be <A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A><br> Sunk deeper into misery&#151;<br> &#151;Great things are granted unto those<br> That love not&#151;far-off things brought close,<br> Things of great seeming brought to nought,<br> And miracles for them are wrought;<br> All earth and heaven lie underneath<br> The hand of him who wastes not breath<br> In striving for another's love,<br> In hoping one more heart to move.<br> &#151;A light thing and a little thing,<br> Ye deem it, that two hearts should cling<br> Each unto each, till two are one,<br> And neither now can be alone?<br> O fools, who know not all has sworn<br> That those shall ever be forlorn<br> Who strive to bring this thing to pass&#151;<br> So is it now, as so it was,<br> And so it shall be evermore,<br> Till the world's fashion is passed o&#146;er."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White-bearded was the ancient man<br> Who spoke, with wrinkled face and wan;<br> But as unto the porch he turned<br> A red spot in his cheek there burned,<br> And his eyes glittered, for, behold! .<br> Close by the altar's horns of gold,<br> There stood the weary ones at last,<br> Their arms about each other cast,<br> Twain no more now, they said&#151;no more <A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A><br> What things soe&#146;er fate had in store.<br> Careless of life, careless of death;<br> Now, when each felt the other's breath<br> On lip and cheek, and many a word<br> By all the world beside unheard,<br> Or heard and little understood,<br> Each spake to each, and all seemed good;<br> Yea, though amid the world's great wrong,<br> Their space of life should not be long;<br> O bitter sweet if they must die!<br> O sweet, too sweet, if time passed by;<br> If time made nought for them, should find<br> Their arms in such wise intertwined<br> Years hence, with no change drawing near!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor says the tale, nor might I hear,<br> That aught of evil on them fell.<br> Few folk there were but thought it well,<br> When saffron-robed, fair-wreathed, loose-haired<br> Cydippe through the city fared<br> Well won at last; when lingering shame<br> Somewhat upon the lovers came,<br> Now that all fear was quite bygone,<br> And yet they were not all alone,<br> Because, from men the sun was fain<br> A little more of toil to gain<br> Awhile in prison of his light,<br> To hold aback the close-lipped night. <A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></p>

<p>SILENCE a little when the tale was told,<br> Soon broken by the merry-voiced and bold<br> Among the youths, though some belike were fain<br> For more of silence yet, that their sweet pain<br> Might be made sweeter still by hope and thought<br> Amid the words of the old story caught&#151;<br> Might be made keener by the pensive eyes<br> That half-confessed love made so kind and wise;<br> Yet these too, mid the others, went their way,<br> To get them through the short October day<br> &#146;Twixt toil and toilsome love, e&#146;en as they might;<br> If so, perchance, the kind and silent night<br> Might yet reward their reverent love with dreams<br> Less full of care.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But round the must's red streams,<br> &#146;Twixt the stripped vines the elders wandered slow,<br> And unto them, e&#146;en as a soothing show<br> Was the hid longing, wild desire, blithe hope,<br> That seethed there on the tangled sun-worn slope<br> &#146;Twixt noon and moonrise. Resolute were they<br> To let no pang of memory mar their day,<br> And long had fear, before the coming rest,<br> Been set aside. And so the changed west,<br> Forgotten of the sun, was grey with haze;<br> The moon was high and bright, when through the maze <A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A><br> Of draggled tendrils back at last they turned,<br> And red the lights within the fair house burned<br> Through the grey night; strained string, and measured voice<br> Of minstrels, mingled with the varying noise<br> Of those who through the deep-cut misty roads<br> Went slowly homeward now to their abodes.<br> A short space more of that short space was gone,<br> Wherein each deemed himself not quite alone.</p>

<p>IN late October, when the failing year<br> But little pleasure more for men might bear,<br> They sat within the city's great guest-hall,<br> Nigh enow to the sea to hear the fall<br> Of the low haven-waves when night was still.<br> But on that day wild wind and rain did fill<br> The earth and sea with clamour, and the street<br> Held few who cared the driving scud to meet.<br> But inside, as a little world it was,<br> Peaceful amid the hubbub that did pass<br> Its strong walls in untiring waves of rage,<br> With the earth's intercourse wild war to wage.<br> Bright glowed the fires, and cheerier their light<br> Fell on the gold that made the fair place bright<br> Of roof and wall, for all the outside din.<br> Yet of the world's woe somewhat was within<br> The noble compass of its walls, for there<br> Were histories of great striving painted fair,<br> Striving with love and hate, with life and death,<br> With hope that lies, and fear that threateneth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so mid varied talk the day went by,<br> As such days will, not quite unhappily,<br> Not quite a burden, till the evening came<br> With lulling of the storm: and little blame<br> The dark had for the dull day's death, when now <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A><br> The good things of the hall were set aglow<br> By the great tapers. Midmost of the board<br> Sat Rolf, the captain, who took up the word,<br> And said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair fellows, a strange tale is this,<br> Heard and forgotten midst my childish bliss,<br> Little remembered midst the change and strife,<br> Come back again this latter end of life,<br> I know not why; yet as a picture done<br> For my delight, I see my father's son,<br> My father with the white cloth on his knees,<br> Beaker in hand, amid the orange-trees<br> At Micklegarth, and the high-hatted man<br> Over against him, with his visage wan,<br> Black beard, bright eyes, and thin composed hands,<br> Telling this story of the fiery lands."</p>
