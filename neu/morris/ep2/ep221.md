\[1870\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

*Refna hears Women talking*.

SO the days wore with nothing new to tell,  
Till spring-tide once more on the country fell,  
Then on a night as Kiartan to his bed  
Would go, still Refna sat with bowed-down head  
And stirred not, nor a while would speak, when he  
Spake to her in kind words and lovingly;  
At last she lifted up a face, wherein  
Somewhat did trouble upon sorrow win,  
And said: <span id="page_473">p. 473</span>  
             "Indeed of all thy grief I knew,  
But deemed if still thou saw’st me kind and true,  
Not asking too much, yet not failing aught  
To show that not far off need love be sought,  
If thou shouldst need love—if thou sawest all this,  
Thou wouldst not grudge to show me what a bliss  
Thy whole love was, by giving unto me  
As unto one who loved thee silently,  
Now and again the broken crumbs thereof:  
Alas! I, having then no part in love,  
Knew not how nought, nought can allay the soul  
Of that sad thirst, but love untouched and whole!  
Kinder than e’er I durst have hoped thou art,  
Forgive me then, that yet my craving heart  
Is so unsatisfied; I know that thou  
Art fain to dream that I am happy now,  
And for that seeming ever do I strive;  
Thy half-love, dearest, keeps me still alive  
To love thee; and I bless it—but at whiles—"

   So far she spake till her weak quivering smiles  
Faded before the bitterness of love.  
Her face changed, and her passion ’gan to move  
Within her breast until the sobs came fast,  
And down upon her hands her face she cast,  
And by the pain of tears her heart did gain  
A little respite; nor might she refrain  
From weeping yet, when Kiartan's arms she felt  
About her, and for long her fair lips dwelt <span id="page_474">p.
474</span>  
With hungry longing on his lips, and he  
Spake to her:  
                 "O poor lover, long may we  
Live upon earth, till lover and beloved  
Each is to each, by one desire moved;  
And whereas thou dost say to me, Forgive,  
Forgive me rather! A short while to live  
Once seemed the longest life of man to me,  
Wherein my love of the old years to see;  
But could I die now, and be born again  
To give my whole heart up to ease thy pain,  
A short while would I choose to live indeed.  
But is it not so, sweet, that thou hast need  
To tell me of a thing late seen or heard?  
Surely by some hap thy dear heart is stirred  
From out its wonted quiet; ease thine heart  
And ’twixt us twain thy fear and grief depart!"

   She looked up: "Yea, kind love, I thought to tell  
Of no great thing that yesterday befell.  
Why should I vex thee with it? Yet thy fame,  
If I must say the word, in question came  
Therein. Yet prithee, mark it not too much!"

   He smiled and said: "Nay, be the tidings such  
As mean my death, speak out and hide not aught!"

   She sat a little while, as though she thought  
How best to speak, then said: "The day being good, <span
id="page_475">p. 475</span>  
About noon yesterday in peaceful mood  
I wandered by the brook-side, and at last  
Behind a great grey stone myself I cast,  
And slept, as fate would have it; when I woke  
At first I did but note the murmuring brook,  
But as my hearing and my sight did clear  
The sound of women's voices did I hear,  
And in the stream two maidens did I see,  
Our housefolk, and belike they saw not me,  
Since I lay low adown, and up the stream  
Their faces turned; I from a half-sweet dream,  
I know not what, awaked, no sooner heard  
Their first word, than sick-hearted and afeard  
I grew, the cold and evil world to feel  
So hard it seemed, love, my life to deal:  
Bitterly clear I saw; as if alone  
And dead, I saw the world; by a grey stone  
Within the shallows, washing linen gear  
They stood; their voices sounded sharp and clear;  
Half smiles of pleasure and of goodlihead,  
Shone on their faces, as their rough work sped;  
O God, how bright the world was!"  
                                    A flush came  
Across her face; as stricken by some shame  
She stammered, when she went on: "Thus their speech,  
Broken amid their work mine ear did reach  
As I woke up to care, for the one said,  
'Yea, certes, now has Kiartan good end made  
Of all his troubles, things go well enow.' <span id="page_476">p.
476</span>  
'Over well,' said the other, 'didst thou know?'  
'Know what?' the first one said, 'What knowst thou then?'  
'Nay, nought except the certain talk of men.'  
'Well, hear I not men too, what wilt thou say?'  
She said, 'Men talk that this is latter May,  
And Kiartan sitteth still and nought is done  
For the two thefts of Bathstead to atone.'  
'Fool!' saith the first one, 'shall all fall to strife  
For what in no wise maketh worse their life?'  
'Well, well, and what will Refna say thereto?  
Things had been otherwise a while ago;  
Scarce Kiartan's brother had stripped Gudrun's head  
Of what she loved, and yet ’scaped lying dead  
By this time. Ospak, sure, is safe enow.'  
'Ah!' said the other, 'great things sayest thou!'  
'True words I speak, when this I say to thee,  
That glad would Gudrun and our Kiartan be  
If Bodli Thorleikson and Refna lay  
Dead on the earth upon the selfsame day;  
And this from all men's daily talk I draw;  
*Old friends are last to sever*, saith the saw.'

   "This was the last word that I heard, O love,  
For from the place softly I ’gan to move  
Ere they might see me, and my feet, well taught  
To know the homeward way, my body brought  
Unto my bower; yet scarce I saw the way,  
Rather some place beneath the sod, where lay <span id="page_477">p.
477</span>  
A few white bones, unnamed, unheeded, while  
Hard by within this bower ’twixt word and smile  
Was breast strained unto breast of twain I knew—  
—And needs must part awhile, that I might rue  
My life, my death, my bitter useless birth.  
O Kiartan, over-weary seemed the earth  
Yesterday and to-day; too hard to bear  
Within thine home to be, and see thee. near,  
And think that but for very kindness thou  
Must wish me dead—thou didst not note me, how  
My face was worn with woe throughout that tide,  
Though most men looked on me—for thou must bide  
A weary waiting, and thy woe untold  
Must make thy face at whiles seem hard and cold.  
—Ah me! forgive me that I talk of this!  
Think how my heart ached!"  
                               For now kiss on kiss  
Did Kiartan shower upon her quivering face,  
Yet, even as their arms did interlace,  
Despite his love and pity, of past years  
He needs must think, of wasted sighs and tears  
And hopes all fallen to nought, and vows undone,  
And many a pleasure from his life seemed gone;  
And sorely his heart smote him for her faith  
So pure and changeless; her love strong as death,  
As kind as God, that nought should satisfy  
Till all the shows of earth had passed her by.
