<p align="center"><i>Kiartan fetches the price of the Coif from Bathstead</i>.</p>  
<p>AND now a day or two with brooding face<br> Did Kiartan go about from place to place<br> And speak few words to any, till one day<br> He bade his men see to their war-array,<br> For two hours after midnight all and some<br> Into the hall to wait his word should come,<br> And whoso blabbed, he said, the deed should rue.<br> So thitherward in arms that night they drew;<br> And Refna trembling lay, while Kiartan clad<br> His body in the best war-gear he had,<br> And through the hangings did she watch the spears,<br> And dreadful seemed the laughter to her ears,<br> And red the lamps burned, as with twilight grey<br> They mingled: then he turned to go away,<br> And kissed her as he spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refna, this eve,<br> Most like, a noble gift shalt thou receive;<br> Do thou thy part to meet it with good grace,<br> And gather what thou canst into this place<br> Of fiddlers and of glee-men, and with song<br> Meet that good gift that comes to heal thy wrong."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Refna durst not ask, What wilt thou then,<br> And whither go to-night these all-armed men?<br> Because she deemed she knew what word it was <A NAME="page_479"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 479</FONT></A><br> That all this clash of arms had brought to pass,<br> And sick at heart she grew to think thereof,<br> And with her fair white arms made strong by love<br> She clung to Kiartan, but he drew her hold<br> With gentle hands from off the mail rings cold.<br> And kissed her sweet mouth opened now to speak,<br> And gat him gone; and she fell back all weak<br> Upon her bed, and lying there alone,<br> Saw how his war-gear in the bright light shone,<br> And heard his cheery voice as he cried loud,<br> "To Bathstead, ho!" and then the noisy crowd<br> Passed clashing from the hall, and nothing there<br> Within a little while might Refna hear,<br> But the dawn's noises, and the loitering tread<br> Of some maid getting slowly back to bed;<br> So there she lay alone in grief and fear,<br> But hope's fresh voice shuddering she needs must hear<br> Whispering wild words, yet sweet, of chance and crime,<br> Telling the wondrous ways of slowfoot time.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now at Bathstead ere they rose that morn,<br> Men deemed they heard the winding of a horn,<br> And, running straightway to the door, could see<br> About the stead a goodly company,<br> And there were Olaf's sons with sixty men<br> Besetting every gate and door; but when<br> The men of Bathstead were all armed and went<br> Unto the door, they saw a gay-striped tent<br> Just raised upon the slope-side &#146;gainst the hall <A NAME="page_480"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 480</FONT></A><br> And armed men round about it; one man, tall<br> Beyond his fellows, stood some yards more near<br> The hall-door, leaning on a pennoned spear,<br> Clad in a glittering mail-coat, with a shield<br> About his neck, where, on a golden field<br> The holy Rood of God was painted fair;<br> From &#146;neath his gilded helm his golden hair<br> Fell waving down, but hidden were his eyes<br> By the wide brim: then did great fear arise<br> Within their hearts, despite their fiery hate,<br> Because they knew that now at last, if late,<br> Was Kiartan's might aroused and in the field.<br> But none the less little would Ospak yield<br> To any fear; before the rest he strode,<br> And cried aloud:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Within this fair abode<br> Has been thy place, O Kiartan Olafson,<br> And not without; what ill deed hast thou done<br> That father Oswif has forbidden thee<br> Thy honoured seat where it was wont to be?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall man moved not, but a deep voice came<br> From &#146;neath his helm: "Thou art right wise to name<br> A hidden head; grow wiser! sick am I,<br> And somewhat deadly now to come anigh;<br> My sword has lost its scabbard &#146;gainst my will,<br> Beware then, for its naked edge may kill!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ospak raised the spear in his right hand <A NAME="page_481"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 481</FONT></A><br> And shook it, but the tall man forth did stand<br> And pushed his helm aback and showed the face<br> Of Kiartan, and across the grassy space<br> Cried mightily: "Be wise, and get ye back!<br> Of fighting one day shall ye have small lack;<br> But now beware, because my father's sons<br> Have sworn to spare no man of you, if once<br> A drop of blood is spilt! Come ye not forth<br> Until I bid you, if of any worth<br> Ye hold your lives; and meantime for the sake<br> Of what I had and have not, I will take<br> My due from mead and byre."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal<br> He let his helm down o&#146;er his visage fall,<br> And turned back toward the tent. Back shrank again,<br> Cowed into sullen rage, the Bathstead men,<br> And armed but helpless there within the hall<br> Silent they sat, hearkening the raiders call<br> The cattle o&#146;er the meads: in high-seat there<br> Sat Bodli, but his visage worn with care<br> Of the past days, was sad, but calm and soft,<br> As if he thought of gentle things, though oft<br> Fierce eyes would scowl upon his dreamy face<br> Unnoted of him; in that dreary place<br> He seemed like some dead king, condemned in hell<br> For his one sin among such men to dwell<br> As for their wickedness he hated most<br> Ere righteous ways and life and all were lost. <A NAME="page_482"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 482</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in meantime, &#146;twixt silent trembling bower<br> And silent cursing hall, hour after hour<br> Did Gudrun pace with restless feet, and heart<br> Betwixt two nameless miseries torn apart,<br> Whence cold despair was being well fashioned now.<br> And Oswif sat apart with wrinkled brow,<br> Unnoted in that house of grief and wrong.<br> But midst their shame, from outside, laugh and song<br> Came loud and louder, mingled with the clank<br> Of mead-horns; the feast's clamour never sank<br> Till mid-day was well passed; then quieter<br> It grew without, and yet they still might hear<br> Lowing of neat and men's shouts. Then a voice<br> Cried from the slope-side:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bathstead men, rejoice<br> That ye no autumn-feast need hold this year,<br> For certes else should ye find victuals dear<br> And hard to come by! Oswif's sons, come out,<br> Unarmed and peaceable, and have no doubt<br> Of hurt from us!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stirred not for a space;<br> Then cried the voice: "Lives none within the place?<br> Are ye all dead of fear? Come out, I say,<br> Else o&#146;er your roof the red cock crows to-day!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ospak, cursing, on the pavement cast<br> His shield and spear, and toward the doorway passed,<br> And in likewise the others one by one,<br> Till Bodli and Gudrun were left alone: <A NAME="page_483"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 483</FONT></A><br> And then she said, "And thou&#151;wilt thou not go?<br> Knowst thou the name of him who shames us so?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, yea, I know it!" Bodli cried; "farewell!<br> Of me, too, shall there be a tale to tell:<br> I will go forth, but not without my sword."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew the thing he named with that last word,<br> And ran unto the door; against the wall<br> There stood the sons of Oswif, stout and tall,<br> Foaming, but helpless: in his saddle now<br> Sat Kiartan, unhelmed, his bright hair a-glow<br> With the May sun. His brethren stood around<br> Beside their horses, and a mighty sound<br> Came from the herd of neat that thronged the way<br> Beneath the hill-side; spears with pennons gay<br> Glittered about them in the sunlight fair,<br> For Kiartan's company was gathered there<br> Ready to set forth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there Bodli stood<br> One moment, thinking that the world was good,<br> Though not for him; then he cried out: "O thou,<br> Thou son of Olaf, come and meet me now,<br> For long have I been weary of the earth;<br> And now to me but one thing seems of worth<br> That I should win death of such hands as thine."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the sunlight did the bright steel shine,<br> And Kiartan's brethren soon had ended all,<br> For Bodli ran forth; yet heard Kiartan call <A NAME="page_484"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 484</FONT></A><br> Across the clash of arms: "Nay, point nor edge<br> His blood shall redden not; make ye a hedge<br> Of your strong shields and thrust him back again<br> Since he knows not that all his might is vain,<br> E&#146;en to win death; live, foster-brother, yet,<br> And get despite of all, what thou mayst get<br> Of joy and honour."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midway, Bodli stayed,<br> And in his hand he poised the heavy blade<br> As he would cast it from him, slowly then<br> Did he give back face foremost from the men,<br> Till in the doorway once again he stood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kiartan said: "Yea, cousin, it is good,<br> If thou must die by me, that thou shouldst bide<br> Some noble fight, some glorious reaping-tide,<br> Where each of each fair fame at least may gain&#151;<br> God grant a little bliss ere that last pain!&#151;<br> But hearken, thievish sons of a wise man!<br> Be taught, ye blustering fools, if yet ye can!<br> From Yule till now I gave you, a long day,<br> To pay the debt that needs was ye must pay;<br> Twice told I take it now, and leave behind<br> What shall seem shame indeed to most men's mind.<br> &#151;This is my bridal gift, think well of it;<br> In your own fields it waxed, while ye did sit<br> Plotting across the meadhorns. Now take heed<br> That oft henceforth your manhood shall ye need<br> If ye would live in peace. Blow loud and clear," <A NAME="page_485"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 485</FONT></A><br> O horns, for Refna waiteth for us there,<br> And merry shall we be to-night in hall<br> What things soever afterwards may fall!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Bodli stood with drawn sword in the door<br> While midst the clang of arms and horn's loud roar,<br> He saw the herd move up the dusty road;<br> He saw how Kiartan for a while abode<br> Behind the rest, and stared at the grey stead<br> Whose roof so often had been o&#146;er his head;<br> He saw him turn, and well might deem he sighed,<br> Then muttered he, "Ah, would God I had died<br> By thee to-day!" and sheathed his sword, and then<br> Was hustled by the sullen baffled men<br> Who shouldered past him back into the hall,<br> Who heeded him just as they did the wall<br> Past which they rubbed; but with the last of these<br> He went in, casting by all hope of peace.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Refna looking from the Herdholt knoll<br> That evening, saw a dust-cloud upward roll<br> And move toward Herdholt, and her heart beat fast<br> When from the midst thereof bright spear-heads passed,<br> And then men's helms, and then the guarded herd;<br> And she bethought her of her mate's last word,<br> And bade the women in their best array,<br> And minstrels, stand on either side the way<br> To greet the new-comers, whose horns blew loud<br> Close by the garth now, while the beasts &#146;gan crowd <A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A><br> About the garth-gate; so, the gate past through,<br> Over the homefield toward the wall they drew,<br> Tended by gay-clad men-at-arms, who wore<br> About their helms fair flowers that Bathstead bore,<br> While of the beasts, sharp horn and curl-browed head,<br> And dewlapped neck were well begarlanded.<br> Then from the close loud joyful cries arose,<br> Tinkle of harps, sharp noise of fiddle-bows,<br> And all along the line there ran a shout:<br> Therewith old Olaf to the door came out,<br> And saw his sons swift from the cattle ride,<br> Till Kiartan leapt adown by Refna's side<br> And cast his arms about her, and &#146;gan cry:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is the Queen's-Gift paid for fittingly;<br> For these are thine, e&#146;en as my hand and sword,<br> To put from thee all care, and every word<br> That grieves thee, sweet. O love, but I am gay!<br> Sure a fair life beginneth from to-day!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed at him, and knew not why her heart<br> Scarce in that joyous scene might play its part&#151;<br> Why it was not enough&#151;these words of love,<br> His bright fair face her longing eyes above?<br> Yet with a loving cry she hid her face<br> Upon his breast.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat did Olaf gaze<br> And muttered low: "A goodly price in sooth<br> For a girl's coif! but yet, for Kiartan's youth, <A NAME="page_487"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 487</FONT></A><br> For his fair hope and glory, and increase<br> Of good deeds, and mine own old age of peace,<br> Not too much, not too much! Ah, woe is me<br> That I should live these latter days to see!"</p>
