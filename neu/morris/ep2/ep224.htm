<p align="center"><i>The Slaying of Kiartan Olafson</i>.</p>  
<p>NOW Kiartan rode from Knoll betimes that day,<br> And goodman Thorkel brought him on the way<br> With twelve men more, and therewithal they ride<br> Fast from the west, but where the pass grew wide<br> And opened into Swinedale, Kiartan stayed<br> His company, and unto Thorkel said,<br> "Thanks have thou, goodman, for thy following;<br> Now get thee back, I fear not anything<br> &#146;Twixt this and Herdholt."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the goodman said,<br> "Time enow is there yet to be waylaid<br> Ere thou art safe at home; let us ride on."<br> "Nay," Kiartan said, "the thing shall not be done,<br> All men of heart will say that heart I lack,<br> If I must have an army at my back<br> Where&#146;er I go, for fear of Oswif's sons.<br> Fare thee well, goodman, get thee back at once!<br> And therewithal take this to comfort thee,<br> That Bodli yet is scarce mine enemy,<br> And holds aback those brethren; wot ye well,<br> Too strange a story would it be to tell,<br> If these should overcome my father's son,<br> Besides, without thee I ride not alone." <A NAME="page_496"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 496</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So back the goodman turned, misdoubting though,<br> In spite of all how yet the day would go,<br> And up the dale rode Kiartan: An the Black,<br> The man who erst the stolen sword brought back,<br> Was with him these, and one named Thorarin,<br> As slowly now the midway dale they win.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I find it written in my tale,<br> There went that morn a goodman of the dale,<br> About those bents his mares and foals to see,<br> His herdsman with him; these saw presently<br> Up from the east the men of Bathstead ride,<br> And take their stand along a streamlet's side<br> Deep sunken in a hollow, where the mouth<br> Of the strait pass turns somewhat to the south,<br> From out the dale; now, since the men they knew,<br> Much they misdoubted what these came to do;<br> But when they turned them from the sunken stream,<br> And saw the sun on other weapons gleam,<br> And three men armed come riding from the west;<br> And when they knew the tallest and the best<br> For Kiartan Olafson, therewith no more<br> They doubted aught.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the herdsman: "Sore<br> The troubles are that on the country-side<br> Shall fall, if this same meeting shall betide;<br> He is a great chief; let us warn him then!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, yea!" his master said, "and all such men <A NAME="page_497"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 497</FONT></A><br> As fate leads unto death, that we may be<br> &#146;Twixt the two millstones ground right merrily,<br> And cursed as we cry out! thou art a fool,<br> Who needs must be the beaker and the stool<br> For great men's use; emptied of joys of life<br> For other's joy, then kicked by in the strife<br> When they are drunken; come, beside the way,<br> Let us lie close to see the merry play!<br> For such a swordsman as is Kiartan, we<br> Shall scarce behold on this side of the sea;<br> And heavy odds he hath against him too.<br> These are great men&#151;good, let them hack and hew<br> Their noble bodies for our poor delight!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So down the bent they slipped, and as they might<br> Lurked by the road, and thus they tell their tale:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere Kiartan reached the strait place of the dale,<br> High up upon the brook-bank Bodli lay,<br> So that his helm was just seen from the way;<br> Then Ospak went to him, and clear they heard<br> Across the road his rough and threatening word:<br> "What dost thou here? thou hast bethought thee then<br> To warn thy friend that here lurk all-armed men.<br> Thou knowest Gudrun's mind&#151;or knowst it not,<br> But knowst that we within a trap have got<br> Thee and the cursed wretch, the proud Mire-blade,<br> The Thief, the King's-pimp, the white Herdholt maid. <A NAME="page_498"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 498</FONT></A><br> Come, sister's husband, get thee lower down!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foam flew from the lips of the fierce clown<br> As thus he spake, but Bodli rose and said:<br> "Thinkst thou I armed because I was afraid<br> Of thee and thine this morn? If thou knewst well<br> Of love or honour, somewhat might I tell<br> Why I am here with thee&#151;If will I have,<br> Kiartan, who was my friend, this day to save,<br> Bethink thee I might do it otherwise<br> Than e&#146;en by showing what in ambush lies!<br> &#151;How if I stood beside him?".<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Down with thee<br> And hold thy peace! or he will hear and see."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so it was that Kiartan drew so near<br> That now the herd their clinking bits might hear,<br> Borne down upon the light wind: on he came,<br> Singing an old song made in Odin's fame,<br> Merry and careless on that sunny morn;<br> When suddenly out rang the Bathstead horn,<br> And sharply he drew rein, and looked around;<br> Then did the lurkers from the gully bound<br> And made on toward them, and down leapt all three,<br> And Kiartan glanced around, and speedily<br> Led toward a rock that was beside the way,<br> And there they shifted them to stand at bay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most noble then looked Kiartan, said the herd, <A NAME="page_499"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 499</FONT></A><br> Nor ever saw I any less afeard;<br> Yet, when his watchful eye on Bodli fell,<br> A change came o&#146;er him, that were hard to tell,<br> But that he dropped his hands at first, as one<br> Who thinks that all is over now and done;<br> Yet, says the neatherd, soon his brows did clear,<br> And from his strong hand whistled forth his spear,<br> And down fell Thorolf clattering on the road.<br> He cried, 'Down goes the thief beneath his load,<br> One man struck off the tale! I have heard tell<br> Of such as dealt with more and came off well.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence a space but for the mail rings; then<br> Over the dusty road on rushed those men;<br> And, says the herd, there saw I for a space<br> Confused gleam of swords about that place,<br> And from their clatter now and then did come<br> Sharp cry, or groan, or panting shout, as home<br> Went point or edge: but pale as death one stood,<br> With sheathed sword, looking on the clashing wood,<br> And that was Bodli Thorleikson. Then came<br> A lull a little space in that wild game.<br> The Bathstead men drew off, and still the three<br> Stood there scarce hurt as far as I could see;<br> But of the Bathstead men I deem some bled,<br> Though all stood firm; then Ospak cried and said;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Bodli, what thing wilt thou prophesy<br> For us, since like a seer thou standest by <A NAME="page_500"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 500</FONT></A><br> And see&#146;st thine house beat back? well then for thee<br> Will I be wise, foretelling what shall be<br> A cold bed, and a shamed board, shalt thou have,<br> Yea, and ere many days a chased dog's grave,<br> If thou bringst home to-day a bloodless sword!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet for all that answered he no word,<br> But stood as made of iron, though the breeze<br> Blew his long black hair round his cheek-pieces<br> And fanned his scarlet kirtle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time we lose,"<br> Another cried, "if Bodli so shall choose,<br> Let him deal with us when this man is slain."<br> Then stoutly to the game they gat again<br> And played awhile, and now withal I saw<br> That rather did the sons of Oswif draw<br> Toward Thorarin and An, until the first,<br> From midst the knot of those onsetters burst,<br> And ran off west, followed by two stout men,<br> Not Oswif's sons; and An the Black fell then<br> Wounded to death, I deemed, but over him<br> Fell Gudlaug, Oswif's nephew, with a limb<br> Shorn off by Kiartan's sword: then once again<br> There came a short lull in the iron rain;<br> And then the four fell on him furiously<br> Awhile, then gave aback, and I could see<br> The noble Kiartan, with his mail-coat rent,<br> His shield hung low adown, his sword-blade bent,<br> Panting for breath, but still without a wound. <A NAME="page_501"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 501</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While as a man by some strong spell fast bound,<br> Without a will for aught, did Bodli stand,<br> Nor once cast eyes on the waylayers&#146; band,<br> Nor once glanced round at Kiartan, but stared still<br> Upon the green side of the grassy hill<br> Over against him, e&#146;en as he did deem<br> It yet might yawn as in a dreadful dream,<br> And from its bowels give some marvel birth,<br> That in a ghostly wise should change the earth,<br> And make that day nought. But as there he stood<br> Ospak raised up his hand, all red with blood,<br> And smote him on the face, and cried;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go home,<br> Half-hearted traitor, e&#146;en as thou hast come,<br> And bear my blood to Gudrun!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no word<br> Came from his pale lips, and the rover's sword<br> Abode within the scabbard. Ospak said,<br> "O lover, art thou grown too full of dread<br> To look him in the face whom thou fearedst not<br> To cozen of the fair thing he had got?<br> O faint-heart thief of love, why drawest thou back,<br> When all the love thou erst so sore didst lack<br> With one stroke thou mayst win?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hear,<br> Or seemed to hear not; but now loud and clear<br> Kiartan cried out his name from that high place,<br> And at the first sound Bodli turned his face<br> This way and that, in puzzled hapless wise, <A NAME="page_502"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 502</FONT></A><br> Till &#146;twixt the spears his eyes met Kiartan's eyes;<br> Then his mouth quivered, and he writhed aside,<br> And with his mail-clad hands his face did hide,<br> And trembled like one palsy-struck, while high<br> Over the doubtful field did Kiartan cry:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, they are right! be not so hardly moved,<br> O kinsman, foster-brother, friend beloved<br> Of the old days, friend well forgiven now!<br> Come nigher, come, that thou my face mayst know,<br> Then draw thy sword and thrust from off the earth<br> The fool that so hath spoilt thy days of mirth,<br> Win long lone days of love by Gudrun's side!<br> My life is spoilt, why longer do I bide<br> To vex thee, friend&#151;strike then for happy life!<br> I said thou mightst not gaze upon the strife<br> Far off; bethink thee then, who sits at home<br> And waits thee, Gudrun, my own love, and come,<br> Come, for the midday sun is over bright,<br> And I am wearying for the restful night!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now had Bodli dropped his hands adown,<br> And shown his face all drawn into a frown<br> Of doubt and shame; his hand was on his sword,<br> Even ere Kiartan spake that latest word;<br> Still trembling, now he drew it from its sheath,<br> And the bright sun ran down the fated death,<br> And e&#146;en the sons of Oswif shuddered now,<br> As with wild eyes and heavy steps and slow <A NAME="page_503"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 503</FONT></A><br> He turned toward Kiartan; beat the heart in me<br> Till I might scarce breathe, for I looked to see<br> A dreadful game; the wind of that midday<br> Beat &#146;gainst the hill-sides; a hound far away<br> Barked by some homestead's door; the grey ewe's bleat<br> Sounded nearby; but that dull sound of feet,<br> And the thin tinkling of the mail-coat rings<br> Drowned in my ears the sound of other things,<br> As less and less the space betwixt them grew;<br> I shut my eyes as one the end who knew,<br> But straight, perforce, I opened them again<br> Woe worth the while!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who looks in vain<br> For help, looked Kiartan round; then raised his shield,<br> And poised his sword as though he ne&#146;er would yield<br> E&#146;en when the earth was sinking; yet a while,<br> And o&#146;er his face there came a quivering smile,<br> As into Bodli's dreadful face he gazed;<br> Then my heart sank within me, as all dazed,<br> I saw the flash of swords that never met,<br> And heard how Kiartan cried;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, better yet<br> For me to die than live on even so!<br> Alas! friend, do the deed that thou must do!<br> Oh, lonely death!&#151;farewell, farewell, farewell!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clattering on the road his weapons fell, <A NAME="page_504"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 504</FONT></A><br> And almost ere they touched the bloody dust,<br> Into his shieldless side the sword was thrust,<br> And I, who could not turn my eyes away,<br> Beheld him fall, and shrieked as there I lay,<br> And yet none noted me; but Bodli flung<br> Himself upon the earth, and o&#146;er him hung,<br> Then raised his head, and laid it on his knee,<br> And cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! what have I done to thee?<br> Was it for this deed, then, that I was born?<br> Was this the end I looked for on this morn?<br> I said, To-day I die, to-day I die,<br> And folk will say, an ill deed, certainly,<br> He did, but living had small joy of it,<br> And quickly from him did his weak life flit&#151;<br> Where was thy noble sword I looked to take<br> Here in my breast, and die for Gudrun's sake,<br> And for thy sake&#151;O friend, am I forgot?<br> Speak yet a word!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kiartan answered not,<br> And Bodli said, "Wilt thou not then forgive?<br> Think of the days I yet may have to live<br> Of hard life!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith Kiartan oped his eyes,<br> And strove to turn about as if to rise,<br> And could not, but gazed hard on Bodli's face,<br> And gasped out, as his eyes began to glaze:<br> "Farewell, thou joyous life beneath the sun, <A NAME="page_505"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 505</FONT></A><br> Thou foolish wasted gift&#151;farewell, Gudrun!"<br> And then on Bodli's breast back fell his head,<br> He strove to take his hand, and he was dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then was there silence a long while, well-nigh<br> We heard each other breathe, till quietly<br> At last the slayer from the slain arose,<br> And took his sword, and sheathed it, and to those<br> Four sons of Oswif, e&#146;en as one he spake<br> Who had good right the rule o&#146;er them to take:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here have we laid to earth a mighty one,<br> And therein no great deed, forsooth, have done,<br> Since his great heart o&#146;ercame him, not my sword;<br> And what hereafter may be our reward<br> For this, I know not: he that lieth here<br> By many a man in life was held right dear,<br> As well as by the man who was his friend,<br> And brought his life and love to bitter end;<br> And since I am the leader of this band<br> Of man-slayers, do after my command.<br> Go ye to Bathstead, name me everywhere<br> The slayer of Kiartan Olafson, send here<br> Folk who shall bear the body to our stead;<br> And then let each man of you hide his head,<br> For ye shall find it hard from this ill day<br> To keep your lives: here, meanwhile will I stay,<br> Nor think myself yet utterly alone." <A NAME="page_506"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 506</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then home turned Oswif's sons, and they being gone,<br> We slunk away, and looking from the hill<br> We saw how Bodli Thorleikson stood still<br> In that same place, nor yet had faced the slain.<br> And so we gat unto our place again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So told the herd, time long agone, the tale<br> Of that sad fight within the grey-sloped vale.</p>
