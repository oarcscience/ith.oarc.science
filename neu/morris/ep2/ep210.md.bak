### THE LOVERS OF GUDRUN.

#### ARGUMENT.

This story shows how two friends loved a fair woman, and how he who
loved her best had her to wife, though she loved him little or not at
all; and how one of these two friends gave shame to and received death
of the other, who in his turn came to his end by reason of that deed.

*Of Herdholt and Bathstead*.

HERDHOLT my tale names for the stead, where erst  
Olaf the Peacock dwelt; nowise the worst  
Among the great men of a noble day:  
Upon a knoll amidst a vale it lay,  
Nigh where Laxriver meets the western sea,  
And in that day it nourished plenteously  
Great wealth of sheep and cattle.  
                                    Ye shall know  
That Olaf to a mighty house did go  
To take to him a wife: Thorgerd he gat,  
The daughter of the man, at Burg who sat,  
After a great life, with eyes waxing dim,  
Egil, the mighty son of Skallagrim. <span id="page_338">p. 338</span>  
Now of the sons the twain had, first we name  
Kiartan alone, for eld's sake and for fame,  
Then Steinthor, Haldor, Helgi, and Hauskuld,  
All of good promise, strong and lithe and bold,  
Yet little against Kiartan's glory weighed;  
Besides these props the Peacock's house that stayed,  
Two maidens, Thurid, Thorbiorg there were;  
And furthermore a youth was fostered there,  
Whom Thorleik, Olaf's brother, called his son:  
Bodli his name was. Thus the tale is done  
Of those who dwelt at Herdholt in those days.

   Midst the grey slopes, Bathstead its roof did raise  
Seven miles from Herdholt; Oswif, wise of men,  
Who Thordis had to wife, abode there then  
With his five sons, of whom let names go past  
That are but names; but these were first and last,  
Ospak and Thorolf: never, says my tale,  
That Oswif's wisdom was of much avail  
In making these, though they were stout enow;  
But in his house a daughter did there grow  
To perfect womanhood, Gudrun by name,  
Whose birth the wondering world no more might blame  
Than her's who erst called Tyndarus her sire,  
What hearts soe’er, what roof-trees she might fire,  
What hearts soe’er, what hearths she might leave cold,  
Before the ending of the tale be told.  
But where we take the story up, fifteen  
The maiden's years were; Kiartan now had seen <span id="page_339">p.
339</span>  
His eighteenth spring, and younger by a year  
Was Bodli, son of Thorleik.  
                              Now most fair  
Seemed Olaf's lot in life, and scarcely worse  
Was Oswif's, and what shadow of a curse  
Might hang o’er either house, was thought of now  
As men think of a cloud the mountain's brow  
Hides from their eyes an hour before the rain;  
For so much love there was betwixt the twain,  
Herdholt and Bathstead, that it well might last  
Until the folk aforenamed were all passed  
From out the world; but herein shall be shown  
How the sky blackened, and the storm swept down.
