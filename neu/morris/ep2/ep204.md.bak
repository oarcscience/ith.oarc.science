### THE LAND EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON.

#### ARGUMENT.

THIS tale, which is set forth as a dream, tells of a churl's son who won
a fair Queen to his love, and afterwards lost her, and yet in the end
was not deprived of her.

*IN Norway, in King Magnus’ days,  
A man there dwelt, my story says,  
Who Gregory had got to name;  
Folk said from outland parts he came,  
Though none knew whence; he served withal  
The Marshal Biorn in field and hall,  
And little, yet was deft of hand  
And stout of heart, when men did stand  
Spear against spear; and his black eyes  
Folk deemed were somewhat overwise.  
For of the stars full well he knew,  
And whither lives of men they drew.  
So Gregory the Star gazer  
Men called him, and somewhat in fear  
They held him, though his daily mood* <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>  
*Was ever mild enow and good.  
   It chanced upon a summer day,  
When in the south King Magnus lay,  
With all his men, the Marshal sent  
A well-manned cutter, with intent  
To get him fish for house-keeping,  
And Gregory, skilful in this thing,  
The skipper over them to be;  
So merrily they put to sea,  
And of a little island lay,  
Amidst the firth, and fished all day,  
But when night fell, ashore they went  
Upon the isle, and pitched their tent,  
And ate and drank, and slept at last.  
   But while sleep held the others fast  
Did Gregory waken, turning oft  
Upon his rough bed nothing soft,  
Till stealthily at last he rose  
And crept from the tent thronged and close  
Into the fresh and cloudless night,  
And ’neath the high-set moon's cold light  
Went softly down unto the sea;  
And sleep, that erst had seemed to be  
A thing his life must hope in vain,  
Now ’gan to fall on him again,  
E’en as he reached the sandy bay  
Where on the beach their cutter lay.  
Calm was the sea ’twixt wall and wall  
Of the green bight; the surf did fall* <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>  
*With little noise upon the sand,  
Where ’neath the moon the smooth curved strand  
Shone white ’twixt dark sea, rocks, and turf*.

*   There, hearkening to the lazy surf,  
Musing he scarcely knew of what,  
Upon a grey rock Gregory sat,  
Till sleep had all its will of him,  
And now at last, with slackened limb  
And nodding head, he fell to dream;  
And far away now did he seem,  
Waked up within the great hall, where  
King Magnus held right merry cheer  
In honour of the Christmas-tide,  
At Ladir; and on every side  
His courtmen and good bonders sat.  
   There as folk talked of this and that,  
And drank, and all were blithe enow,  
Amid the drifting of the snow  
And howling of the wind without,  
Within the porch folk heard a shout,  
And opening of the outer door;  
Then one came in, who to the floor  
Cast down the weight of snow, and stood  
Undoing of his fur-lined hood,  
And muttering in his beard the while.  
   The King gazed on him with a smile,  
Then said at last—"What is it then?  
Art thou called one of my good men*, <span id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
*And art thou of the country-side,  
Or hast thou mayhap wandered wide?  
Come sit thee down and eat and drink—  
—And yet hast thou some news, I think?"*

*   The man said, "News from over sea  
Of Mary and the Trinity,  
And goodman Joseph, do I bring;  
Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, O King!"*

*   Inward he stalked on, therewithal,  
But stopped amidmost of the hall,  
And cast to earth his cloak and hood,  
And there in glittering raiment stood,  
While the maids went about the board  
And deftly the cup's river poured,  
And ’mid great clank of ewer and horn  
Men drank the day when Christ was born*.

*   Then by the King the gold-clad man  
Sat, Gregory dreamed, and soon began  
Great marvels of far lands to tell,  
And said at last:  
                 "Ye serve me well,  
And strange things therefore will I show,  
Wonders that none save ye may know;  
That ye this stormy night may call  
A joyful tide in kingly hall  
A night to be remembered."* <span id="page_38">p. 38</span>  
   *Then Gregory dreamed he turned his head  
Unto the stranger, and their eyes  
Met therewith, and a great surprise  
Shot through his heart, because indeed  
That strange man in the royal weed  
Seemed as his other self to be  
As he began this history*.

 

IN this your land there once did dwell  
A certain carle who lived full well,  
And lacked few things to make him glad;  
And three fair sons this goodman had,  
Whereof were two stout men enow  
Betwixt the handles of the plough,  
Ready to drive the waggons forth,  
Or pen the sheep up from the north,  
Or help the corn to garner in,  
Or from the rain the hay to win;  
To dyke after the harvesting,  
And many another needful thing.  
But slothful was the youngest one,  
A loiterer in the spring-tide sun,  
A do-nought by the fire-side  
From end to end of winter-tide,  
And wont in summer heats to go <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
About the garden to and fro,  
Plucking the flowers from bough and stalk;  
And muttering oft amid his walk  
Old rhymes that few men understood.

   "Now is he neither harm nor good,"  
His father said; "there, let him go  
And do what he has lust to do."

   Now so it chanced the goodman had  
A meadow meet to make him glad  
Full oft because of its sweet grass,  
Whereto an ill thing came to pass,  
When else the days were drawing nigh  
To hay-harvest, and certainly  
Our goodman thought all would be won  
Before the morrow of St. John.  
For as he walked thereto one day  
He fell to thinking on the way,  
"A fair east wind, and cloudless sky  
In scythes before two days go by."  
But yet befell a grievous slip  
Betwixt that fair cup and the lip,  
For when he reached the wattled fence,  
And looked across his meadow thence,  
His broad face drew into a frown,  
For there he saw all trodden down  
A full third of the ripening grass,  
So that no scythe might through it pass; <span id="page_40">p.
40</span>  
Then in a rage he turned away  
And was a moody man that day.

   But when that eve he sat at home  
And his two eldest sons had come  
Back from the field, he spake and said:—

   "Ill-doers, sons, by likelihood  
Be here about, or envious men;  
I thought the last had left us, when  
Skeggi's two sons put off to sea,  
Yet is there left some enemy  
Not bold enough on field or way  
To draw the sword his debt to pay;  
Therefore, son Thorolf, shalt thou go  
And bear with thee the great cross-bow,  
And hide within the white-thorn brake  
And lie there all this night awake  
Watching the great south meadow well;  
Because last night it so befell  
This gangrel thief thought fit to tread  
The grass to mammocks by my head!"

   So Thorolf rose unwillingly,  
And round about his waist did tie  
The case of bolts, and took adown  
The mighty cross-bow tough and brown,  
And in his strong belt set a knife  
Lest he should come to closer strife, <span id="page_41">p. 41</span>  
And thereon, having drunk full well,  
Went on his way, and thought to tell,  
A goodly tale at break of day.  
Thus to the mead he gat, and lay  
Close hidden in the hawthorn brake,  
And kept but little time awake,  
But on the sorrel slept as soft  
As on his truckle in the loft,  
Nor woke until the sun was high,  
When looking thence full sleepily  
He saw yet more of that fair field,  
So dealt with, that it scarce would yield  
Much fodder to his father's neat  
That summer-tide, of sour or sweet.  
   Then home he turned with hanging head,  
And right few words that tide he said,  
In answer to his father's scoff,  
But toward the middenstead went off.

   So that same night the vexed carle sent  
His next son Thord with like intent;  
But ere the yellow moon was down  
Asleep and snoring lay our clown,  
And waking at the dawn could see  
The meadow trodden grievously.

   Now when unto the house he came,  
Speaking no word for very shame,  
The good man ’gan to gibe and jeer, <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>  
Saying, that many a groat too dear  
Such sleepy-headed fools he bought,  
That tide when he their mother sought  
With Flemish cloth and silver rings  
And chains, and far-fetched, dear-bought things  
The mariners had sold to him,  
For which had many a man to swim  
Head downward to the porpoises—  
All to get gluttons like to these!

   The third son John, who on the floor  
Was lying kicking at the door,  
Turned round and yawned, and stretched, and said,  
"Alas, then, all my rest is sped,  
For now thou wilt be sending me,  
O father, the third watch to be.  
Well, keep thy heart up, I shall know  
To-morrow, what thing grieves thee so."

   "Yea, yea," his father said, "truly  
A noble son thou art to me!  
Thou fool, thou thinkest then to win  
The game when these have failed therein!  
Truly a mighty mind I have  
Thy bread and beer henceforth to save,  
And send thee with some skipper forth,  
Who brings back stockfish from the north;  
Then no more dreaming wouldst thou spend  
Thy days, but learn to know rope's-end, <span id="page_43">p.
43</span>  
And stumble on the icy decks  
To no sweet music of rebecks.  
—Yet since indeed a fool may do  
What no wise man may come unto,  
Go thou, if thou hast any will,  
Because thou canst not do me ill;  
And lo, thou! if thou dost me good  
Then will I fill thy biggest hood  
With silver pennies for thine own,  
To squander in the market-town."

   Nought answered John, but turned away,  
And underneath the trees all day  
He slept, but with the moon arose;  
Nor did he arm himself like those,  
His brethren, for he thought, 'Indeed  
Of bolt and bow have I no need,  
For if ill-doers there should be,  
Then will they slay me certainly,  
If I should draw on them a bolt;  
And, though my brethren call me dolt,  
Yet have I no such foolish thought  
For a shaft's whistle to be brought  
To death—withal I shall not see  
Men-folk belike, but faërie,  
And all the arms within the seas  
Should help me nought to deal with these;  
Rather of such lore were I fain  
As fell to Sigurd Fafnir's-bane <span id="page_44">p. 44</span>  
When of the dragon's heart he ate.  
—Well whatso hap I gain of fate,  
I know I will not sleep this night,  
But wake to see a marvellous sight.'

   Therewith he came unto the mead,  
And looked around with utmost heed  
About the remnant of the hay;  
Then in the hawthorn brake he lay  
And watched night-long ’midst many a thought  
Of what might be, and yet saw nought  
As slowly the short night went by,  
’Midst bittern's boom and fern-owl's cry;  
Then the moon sank, the stars grew pale,  
And the first dawn ’gan show the veil  
The night had drawn from tree to tree,  
A light wind rose, and suddenly  
A thrush drew head from under wing,  
And through the cold dawn ’gan to sing,  
And one by one about him woke  
The minstrels of the feathered folk,  
Long ere the first gleam of the sun.  
Then, though his watch was but begun,  
E’en at that tide, as well he knew,  
O’er John a drowsiness there drew,  
And nothing seemed so good as sleep,  
And sweet dreams o’er his eyes ’gan creep  
That made him smile, then wake again  
In terror that his watch was vain; <span id="page_45">p. 45</span>  
But in the midst of one of these  
He started up, for through the trees  
A mighty rushing sound he heard,  
As of the wings of many a bird;  
And, stark awake, with beating heart,  
He put the hawthorn twigs apart,  
And yet saw no more wondrous thing  
Than seven white swans, who on wide wing  
Went circling round, till one by one  
They dropped the dewy grass upon.  
He smiled thereat, and thought to shout  
And scare them off; but yet a doubt  
Clung to him, as he gazed on those,  
And in the brake he held him close,  
And watched them bridle there, and preen  
Their snowy feathers well beseen;  
So near they were, that he a stone  
Might have cast o’er the furthest one  
With his left hand, as there he lay.

   Apace came on the summer day,  
Though the sun lingered, and more near  
The swans drew, and began to peer  
About in strange wise, and John deemed,  
In after days, he must have dreamed  
Again, if for the shortest space;  
For a cloud seemed to dull the place  
And silence of the birds there was;  
And when he next looked o’er the grass, <span id="page_46">p.
46</span>  
Six swan-skins lay anigh his hand,  
And nearby on the grass did stand  
Seven white-skinned damsels, wrought so fair  
That John must sit and tremble there,  
And flush blood-red, and cast his eyes  
Down on the ground in shamefast wise,  
Then look again with longings sweet  
Piercing his heart; because their feet  
Moved through the long grey-seeded grass  
But some two yards from where he was.

   A while in gentle wise they went,  
Among the ripe long grass that bent  
Before their beauty; then there ran  
A thrill through him as they began,  
In musical sweet speech and low,  
To talk a tongue he did not know;  
But when at last one spake alone,  
It was to him as he had known  
That heavenly voice for many years,  
His heart swelled, till through rising tears  
He saw them now, nor would that voice  
Suffer his hot heart to rejoice,  
In all that erst his eyes did bless  
With unimagined loveliness:  
Because her face, that yet had been  
Alone among those girls unseen,  
He longed for with such strong desire,  
That his heart sickened, and quick-fire <span id="page_47">p.
47</span>  
Within his parched throat seemed to burn.

   A while she stood and did not turn,  
While still the music of her voice  
Made the birds' song seem tuneless noise;  
And she alone of all did stand,  
Holding within her down-drooped hand  
The swan-skin—like a pink-tinged rose  
Plucked from amidst a July close,  
And laid on January snow,  
Her fingers on the plumes did show:  
A rosy flame of inner love  
Seemed glowing through her; she did move  
Lightly at whiles, or the soft wind  
Played in her hair no coif did bind.  
Then did he fear to draw his breath  
Lest he should find the hand of Death  
Was showing him vain images;  
Then did he deem the morning breeze  
Blew from the flowery fields of heaven,  
Such fragrance to the morn was given.

   And now across the long dawn's grey  
The climbing sun's first level ray,  
Long hoped, yet sudden when it came,  
Over the trembling grass did flame  
And made the world alive once more;  
And therewithal a pause came o’er  
The earth and heaven, because she turned, <span id="page_48">p.
48</span>  
And with such longing his heart burned  
That there he thought he needs must die,  
And, breathless, opened mouth to cry.  
And yet how soft and kind she seemed;  
What a sweet helpful smile there gleamed  
Over the perfect loveliness  
That now his feeble eyes did bless!

   Now fell the swan-skin from her hand,  
And silent all a space did stand,  
And then again she turned away,  
And seemed some whispered word to say  
Unto her fellows; and therewith  
Their delicate round limbs and lithe  
Began to sway in measured time  
Unto a sweet-voiced outland rhyme  
As they cleft through the morning air  
Hither and thither: fresh and fair  
Beyond all words indeed were these,  
Yet unto him but images  
Well wrought, fair coloured: while she moved  
Amid them all, a thing beloved  
By earth and heaven: could she be  
Made for his sole felicity?—  
Yet if she were not, earth and heaven  
Belike for nought to men were given  
But to torment his weary heart.  
He put the thorny twigs apart  
A little more to gaze his fill; <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>  
And as he gazed a thought of ill  
Shot through him: close unto his hand,  
Nigher than where she erst did stand,  
Nigher than where her unkissed feet  
Had kissed the clover-blossoms sweet,  
The snowy swan-skin lay cast down.  
His heart thought, 'She will get her gon  
E’en as she came, unless I take  
This snow-white thing for her sweet sake;  
Then whether death or life shall be,  
She needs must speak one word to me  
Before I die.'  
                And therewithal  
His hand upon the skin did fall  
Almost without his will, while yet  
His eyes upon her form were set.  
He drew it to him, and there lay  
Until the first dance died away,  
And from amid the rest thereof  
Another sprang, whose rhythm did move  
Light foot, long hair, and supple limb,  
As the wind moves the poplars slim;  
Then as the wind dies out again,  
Like to the end of summer rain  
Amid their leaves, and quivering now  
No more their June-clad heads they bow,  
So sank the rippling song and sweet,  
And gently upon level feet  
They swayed, and circle-wise did stand <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
Each scarcely touching each with hand,  
Until at last all motion ceased.

   Still as the dewy shade decreased,  
Panting John lay, and did not move,  
Sunk in the wonder of his love,  
Though fear weighed on him; for he knew  
That short his time of pleasance grew  
Though none had told him.  
                              Now the one  
His heart was set on spake alone,  
And therewith hand and arm down-dropped,  
Their scarce-heard murmuring wholly stopped,  
And softly in long line they passed  
Unto the thorn-brake, she the last.  
Then unto agony arose  
John's fear, as once again all close  
She was to him. The wind ran by  
The notched green leaves, the sun was high,  
Dappling the grass whereon he lay:  
Fresh, fair, and cheery was the day,  
And nought like guile or wizardry  
Could one have thought there was anigh,  
Till, suddenly, did all things change,  
E’en as his heart, and dim and strange  
The old familiar world had grown,  
That blithe and rough he erst had known,  
And racked and mined time did seem. <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

   A sudden, sharp cry pierced his dream,  
And then his cleared eyes could behold  
His love, half-hid with hair of gold,  
Her slim hands covering up her face,  
Standing amid the grassy place,  
Shaken with sobs, and round her woe,  
With long caressing necks of snow  
And ruffling plumes, the others stood'  
Bird-like again. Chilled to the blood,  
Yet close he lay and did not move,  
Strengthening his heart with thoughts of love,  
Wild as a morning dream. Withal  
Some murmured word from her did fall,  
Closer awhile the swans did press  
Around her woeful loveliness,  
As though a loth farewell they bade;  
And she one fair hand softly laid  
Upon their heads in wandering wise,  
Nor drew the other from her eyes,  
As one by one her body fair  
They left, and rose into the air  
With clangorous cries, and circled wide  
Above her, till the blue did hide  
Their soaring wings, and all were gone.

   As scarce she knew that she was lone,  
She stood there for a little space,  
One hand still covering up her face,  
The other drooped down, half stretched out, <span id="page_52">p.
52</span>  
As if her lone heart yet did doubt  
Somewhat was left her to caress.  
Yet soon all sound of her distress  
Was silent, though thought held her fast  
And nought she moved; the field-mouse passed  
Close to her feet, the dragon-fly,  
A thin blue needle flickered by,  
The bee whirled past her as the morn  
Grew later, and strange thoughts were born  
Within her.  
             So she raised her head  
At last, and, gazing round, she said:  
"Is pitying love all dead on earth?  
Is no heart left that holds of worth  
Love that hands touch not, and that eyes  
Behold not? Is none left so wise  
As not to know the smart of bliss  
That dieth out ’twixt kiss and kiss?"

   She stopped and trembled, for she heard  
The hawthorn brake beside her stirred,  
Then turned round, half unwittingly,  
Across the meadow-grass to flee,  
And knew not whither, as, half blind,  
She heard the rustling twigs behind,  
And therewithal a breathless cry  
And eager footsteps drawing nigh.  
With streaming hair, a little way  
She fled across the trodden hay, <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>  
Then failed her feet, and turning round,  
She cowered low upon the ground,  
With wild eyes turned to meet her fate,  
E’en as the partridge doth await,  
With half-dead breast and broken wing,  
The winged death the hawk doth bring.

   Dim with the horror of that race,  
Wild eyes her eyes met, and pale face,  
And trembling outstretched hands that moved  
No nigher to her body loved,  
Whereto they had been brought so near.  
For very fear of her wild fear.

   So each of other sore afraid,  
There fleer and pursuer stayed,  
Each gathering breath and heart to speak—  
And he too hopeless, she too weak,  
For a long space to say a word.

   Yet first her own faint voice she heard,  
For in his hand she saw the skin,  
And deemed she knew what he would win,  
And how that morning's deed had gone:

   "What have I done? what have I done?  
Did I work ever harm to thee,  
That thou this day my bane shouldst be?  
Why is there such hate in thine eyes  
Against me?"  
                   From his breast did rise <span id="page_54">p.
54</span>  
A dumb sound, but no word came forth;  
She shrank aback yet more:  
                             "What worth,  
What worth in all that thou hast done?  
For say my body thou hast won,  
Art thou God, then, to keep alive,  
Unless my will therewith I give?"  
E’en as she spake, a look of pain  
Twitched at his face; she spoke again:   

"For now I see thou hat’st me not,  
But thinkest thou a prize hast got  
Thou wilt not lightly cast away:  
O hearken, hearken!—a poor prey  
Thy toils shall take, a thing of stone  
Amid your folk to dwell alone  
And hide a heart that hateth thee."

   He shrank back from her wretchedly,  
And dropped his hand and hung his head;  
"Nay, now I hate thee not," she said—  
"And who knows what may come to be  
If thou but give mine own to me,  
And free this trembling body here?  
Wouldst thou rejoice if thou wert dear,  
Dear unto me though far away,  
And hope still fed thee day by day?"

   She deemed he wept now, as he turned <span id="page_55">p.
55</span>  
Away from her, and her heart yearned  
Somewhat toward him as she spake:

   "And if thou dost this for my sake,  
Wilt thou, for all that, deem this morn  
Has made thee utterly forlorn?  
Hast thou not cast thine arms round Love  
At least, thy weary heart to move,  
To make thy wakening strange and new,  
And dull life false and old tales true;  
Yea, and a tale to make thy life  
To speed the others in the strife,  
To quicken thee with wondrous fire,  
And make thee fairer with desire?  
Wilt thou, then, think it all in vain,  
'The restless longing and the pain,  
Lightened by hope that shall not die?  
For thou shalt hope still certainly,  
And well mayst deem that thou hast part,  
Somewhat, at least, in this my heart,  
Whatever else therein may be."

   He turned about most eagerly  
And gazed upon her for a while .  
Wild fear had left her, and a smile  
Had lit up now her softened face,  
Sweet pleading kindness gave new grace  
To all her beauty; fresh again  
Her cheeks grew, haggard erst with pain <span id="page_56">p.
56</span>  
She saw the deep love in his eyes,  
And slowly therewithal ’gan rise,  
While something in her heart there moved,  
Some pleasure to be well beloved,  
Some pain because of doubt and fear,  
Of once-loved things grown scarce so dear;  
Less clear all things she seemed to see,  
Her wisdom in life's mystery  
Seemed fleeting, and for very shame  
A tingling flush across her came.

   But close unto him did she stand,  
And, reaching out her little hand,  
Took his, and in strange searching wise  
Gazed on him with imploring eyes;  
And with the sweetness of that touch  
And look, wrought fear and hope o’ermuch  
Within him, and his eyes waxed dim,  
And trembling sore in every limb,  
He slid adown, and knelt, and said:

   "O sweetly certes hast thou prayed,  
Nor used vain words, but smitten me  
With all the greater agony  
For all thy sweetness: so, indeed,  
If thou art holpen well at need  
By this thy prayer, yet meet it is  
Ere this one moment of great bliss  
Has turned to nought all life to come, <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>  
That thou shouldst hear me ere my doom,  
—And yet indeed what prayer to make  
Thy heart amid its calm to shake,  
When thou art gone—when thou art gone,  
And I and woe are left alone!  
—What fiercest word shall yet avail  
If this my first and last one fail—  
Wherewith shall the hard heart be moved  
If this move not, that it is loved?"

   His eager hand her hand did press,  
His eyes devoured her loveliness.  
But silent she a short while stood,  
Her face now pale, now red as blood,  
While her lip trembled, and her eyes  
Grew wet to see his miseries,  
At last she spake with down-cast head;

   "Alas, what shall I do?" she said,  
"Thy prayer shall make me sorrow more  
Whenas I go to that far shore  
I needs must go to; for I know,  
Poor soul! that thou wilt let me go,  
Since thou art grown too wise and kind  
My helpless soul with force to bind—  
—Would thou might’st have some part in me!"

   She shrank aback afraid, for he  
Now sprang up with a bitter cry: <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>  
"Thou knowest not my agony!  
Thou knowest not the words thou say’st,  
Or what a wretched, empty waste  
This remnant of my life is grown,  
Or how I need thee all alone  
To heal the wound this morn has made!  
—Why tremblest thou?—be not afraid;  
I will not leave thee any more:  
Come near to me! My mother bore  
No dreadful thing when I was born.  
Fear not, thou art not yet forlorn,  
As I, as I, as I shall be  
If ever thou shouldst go from me."

   She shrank no more, but looked adown  
And said, "Alas! why dost thou frown?  
Wilt thou be ever angry thus?"  
Her voice was weak and piteous  
As thus she spake, and in her breast  
A sob there moved, yet hard she pressed  
The hand she held: too sweet was love  
For any word his lips to move;  
Too sweet was hope that lips might dare  
To touch her sweet cheek smooth and fair.  
Yet with her downcast eyes she knew  
That nigher ever his face drew  
To hers, and new-born love did flame  
Out from her heart, as now there came <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>  
A sound half sigh, half moan from him;  
She trembled sore, all things ’gan swim  
Before her eyes, nor felt her feet  
The firm earth—for all over-sweet  
For sight or hearing life ’gan grow,  
As panting, and with changed eyes now,  
She raised her parted lips to his.

   But ere their fair young mouths might kiss,  
While hand stole unto hand, and breath  
Met breath, the image of cold death,  
With his estranging agonies,  
Smote on her heart that once was wise;  
As touched by some sharp sudden sting,  
Back from her love's arms did she spring,  
And stood there trembling; and her cry  
Rang through the morn:  
                          "Why shouldst thou die  
Amidst thy just-won joy?" she said,  
"And must I see thee stark and dead  
Who have beheld thy gathering bliss?  
Touch me no more yet—so it is  
That thy fierce heart hath conquered me,  
That I no more may look on thee  
Without desire—for such an end  
I hitherward, belike, did wend,  
Led on by fate, and knew it not—  
But if thy love is e’en as hot  
As thine eyes say, what wilt thou do? <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>  
Loved or loved not, still is it so,  
That in thy land I may not live.  
Too strong thou art that I should strive  
With thee and love—Yet what say’st thou?  
Art thou content thy love to throw  
Unto the waste of time, and dwell  
Here in thy land, and fare right well,  
Feared, hated maybe, yet through all  
A conquering man, whate’er shall fall—  
—Or, in mine own land be mine own,  
Live long, perchance, yet all unknown,  
Love for thy master and thy law,  
Nor hope another lot to draw  
From out life's urn?—Think of it, then!  
Be great among the sons of men  
Because I love thee, and forget  
That here amid the hay we met—  
Or else be loved and love, the while  
Life's vision doth thine eyes beguile."

   He fell upon his knees, and cried:  
"Ah, wilt thou go?—the world is wide  
And waste; we were together here  
A while ago, and I grew dear  
To thee, I deemed—what hast thou said?  
Behold, behold, the world is dead,  
And I must die, or ere I deal  
With its dead follies more, or feel  
The dead men's dreams that move men there, <span id="page_61">p.
61</span>  
—Alas, how shall I make my prayer  
To thee, who lovedest me time agone,  
No more to leave my heart alone?"

   Musing, his passionate speech she heard,  
And with a strange look, half afeard,  
Half pitying, did she gaze on him,  
Until through tears that sight waxed dim;  
At last she spake:  
                      "No need to pray  
Lest I thy love, O love, betray;  
But many a thought there is in me  
If I through love might clearly see;  
—But the morn wanes fast, dear, arise  
And let me hence, lest eviler eyes  
Than thine behold my body here,  
And thou shouldst buy thy bliss too dear;  
So bring me to some place anigh  
Amid thick trees, where thou and I  
May be alone a little space,  
To make us ready for the place  
Where love may still be happiness  
Unmixed with change and ill distress."

   He gazed on her, but durst not speak,  
Nor noted how a sigh did break  
The sweetness of her speech, but took  
Her white hand with a hand that shook  
For very love, and o’er the grass, <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>  
Scarce knowing where his feet did pass,  
He led her, till they came at last  
Unto a beech-wood, where the mast  
And dry leaves, made a carpet meet,  
Sun-speckled, underneath their feet.  
She stopped him, grown all grave and calm,  
And laid lips like a healing balm  
Upon his brow and spake:  
                         "Ah, would  
That I who know of ill and good,  
And thou who may’st learn e’en as much  
By misery, might deem this touch  
Of calm lips, joy enough to last  
Till life with all its whirl were past—  
This kiss, and memory of the morn  
Whereon the sweet desire was born."

   He trembled, and beseechingly  
Gazed on her: "Ah, no, no," said she,  
"No more with thee this day I strive,  
E’en as thou prayedst will I give;  
Belike because I may not choose,  
Nay nor may let my own soul loose.  
Is it enow?"  
               Once more he strove,  
With some sweet word to bless his love  
And might not; but she smiled and said:  
"The lovers of old time are dead,  
And so too shall it be with thee. <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>  
Yea, hast thou heard no history  
Of lovers who outlived the love  
That once they deemed the world would move?  
And so too may it be with thee.  
—Nay stretch thy right hand out to me,  
Poor soul, and all shall soon be done."

   A gold ring with a dark green stone  
Upon his finger then she set,  
And said: "Thou may’st repent thee yet  
The giving of this gift to-day;  
Be wise then! Cast the ring away,  
Give me my own and get thee gone;  
For all the past, not so alone  
Shall thou and I then be, as erst;  
Sad, longing, loving, not accurst."

   She trembled as she spake, and turned  
Unto his eyes a face that yearned  
With great desire, although her eyes  
Seemed wonderful and overwise.  
But pain of anger changed his face,  
He said; "I have compelled thy grace,  
But not thy love then; do to me  
E’en as thou willest, and go free."

   She murmured; "Nay, what wilt thou have?  
Thou prayedst and the gift I gave,  
Giving what I might not withhold, <span id="page_64">p. 64</span>  
In spite of wisdom clear and cold.  
—Alas, poor heart unsatisfied,  
Why wilt thou love? the world is wide  
And holdeth many a joyous thing:  
Why wilt thou for thy misery cling  
To that desire that resteth not  
What part soever thou hast got  
Of that whose whole thou ne’er shalt gain?  
Alas for thee and me, most vain,  
Most vain to wrangle more of this!  
Come then, where wait us woe and bliss,  
Give me the swan-skin, lay thee down,  
Nought doubting, on the beech-leaves brown!"

   What spell weighed on his heart but love  
I know not, but nought might he move  
Except to do her whole command;  
He lay adown, and on his hand  
Rested his cheek; his eyes grew dim,  
Yet saw he the white beech-trunks slim  
At first; and his fair-footed love  
He saw ’twixt sun and shadow move  
Close unto him, and languidly  
Her rosy fingers did he see  
About the ruffled swan-skin white,  
Even as when that strange delight  
First maddened him; then dimmer grew  
His sight, and yet withal he knew  
That over him she hung, and blessed <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>  
His face with her sweet eyes, till rest,  
As deep as death as soft as sleep,  
Across his troubled heart did creep;  
And then a long time seemed gone by  
And ’mid soft herbage did he lie  
With shut eyes, half awake, and seemed  
Some dream forgotten to have dreamed,  
So sweet, he fain would dream again;  
Then came back memory with a pain,  
Like death first heard of; with a cry  
And fear swift born of memory  
He oped his eyes, that dazed with light  
Long kept from them, saw nought aright;  
But something kind, and something fair,  
Seemed yet to be anigh him there,  
Whereto he stretched his arms, that met  
Soft hands, and his own hands were set  
On a smooth cheek, he seemed to know  
From days agone;  
                     "Sweet, sweet doth blow  
The gentle wind," he said, "whereas  
Surely o’er blossoms it doth pass  
If any there be made so sweet."

   And as he spake, his lips did meet  
In one unhoped, undreamed-of kiss,  
The very heart of all his bliss.

   Like waking from an ecstasy, <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>  
Too sweet for truth it seemed to be,  
Waking to life full satisfied  
When he arose, and side by side,  
Cheek touching cheek, hand laid in hand,  
They stood within a marvellous land,  
Fruitful, and summer-like, and fair.  
The light wind sported with her hair,  
Crowned with a leaf-like crown of gold,  
Or round her limbs drave lap and fold  
Of her light raiment strange of hue  
That earthly shuttle never knew;  
From overhead the blossoms sweet  
Fell soft, pink-edged upon her feet,  
That moved the grass now, as her voice  
Made the soft scented air rejoice  
And made him tremble; murmuring;  
                                  "Come,  
These are the meadows of my home,  
My home and thine; much have I now  
To tell thee of, and much to show.  
Is it with thee, love, as with me  
That too much of felicity  
Maketh thee sad? yet sweet it is  
That little sadness born of bliss  
And thought of death, and memory  
That even this perchance goes by."

   Too glad his eyes now made his heart  
To let his tongue take any part <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
In all his joy: afraid he felt,  
As though but for a while he dwelt  
Upon the outer ledge of heaven,  
And scarce he knew how much was given  
Of all his heart had asked, as she  
Led softly on from tree to tree.  
He shut his eyes that he might gain  
Some image of the world of pain,  
Some roughness of the world cast by,  
The more his heart to satisfy,  
The more to sound the depths of bliss  
That now belike was ever his.

 

*BUT therewithal the dream did break,  
And Gregory sat up, stark awake,  
And gazing at the surf-line white,  
Sore yearning for some lost delight,  
Some pleasure gone, he knew not what;  
For all that dream was clean forgot.  
So rising with a smile and sigh,  
He gat him backward pensively  
Unto the tent, and past between  
The sturdy sleepers, all unseen  
Of sleep-bound eyes, sore troubled yet  
That he must needs his dream forget.  
So on his rough bed down he lay*, <span id="page_68">p. 68</span>  
*And thought to wake until the day,  
But scarce had time to turn him round  
Ere the lost wonder was well found  
By sleep; again he dreamed that he  
Sat at the King's festivity,  
Again did that sweet tale go on,  
But now the stranger guest was gone  
As though he had not been, and he  
Himself, Star gazing Gregory,  
Sat by King Magnus, clad in gold,  
And in such wise the sequel told*.

 

MIDST all that bliss, and part thereof,  
Full-fed with choicest gifts of love,  
The happy lover lived right long  
Till e’en the names of woe and wrong  
Had he forgotten.—Of his bliss  
Nought may we tell, for so it is  
That verse for battle-song is meet,  
And sings of sorrow piercing-sweet,  
And weaves the tale of heavy years  
And hopeless grief that knows no tears  
Into a smooth song sweet enow,  
For fear the winter pass too slow;  
Yet hath no voice to tell of Heaven  
Or heavenly joys for long years given, <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>  
Themselves an unmatched melody,  
Where fear is slain of victory  
And hope, held fast in arms of love,  
No more the happy heart may move.  
Sweet souls, grudge not our drearihead,  
But let the dying mourn their dead  
With what melodious wail they will!  
Even as we through good and ill  
Grudge not your soundless happiness,  
Through hope whereof alone, we bless  
Our woe with music and with tears.

   Now deems the tale that three long years  
John in that marvellous land abode,  
Till something like a growing load  
Of unacknowledged longing came  
Upon him, mingled with a shame,  
Which happiness slew not, that he  
Apart from his own kind must be,  
Nor share their hopes and fears: withal  
A gloom upon his face did fall,  
His love failed not to note, and knew  
Whither his heart, unwitting, drew.

   And so it fell that, on a day,  
As musing by her side he lay,  
She spake out suddenly, and said:  
"What burden on thy soul is laid,  
What veil through which thou canst not see, <span id="page_70">p.
70</span>  
Thinkst thou that I hide aught from thee?"

   He caught her in his arms, and cried,  
"What is it that from love can hide?  
Thou knowest this, thou knowest this!"

   "Alas," she said, "yet so it is  
That never have I told to thee  
What danger crept toward thee and me!  
How could I spoil the lovesome years  
With telling thee of slow-foot fears,  
Or shade the sweetness of our home  
With what perchance might never come?  
But now we may not turn aside  
From the sharp thorn the rose did hide."

   He turned on her a troubled face,  
And said, "What is it, from what place  
Comes trouble on us?"  
                         She flushed red  
As one who lies, and stammering said;  
"In thine own land, where while ago  
Thou dwelledst, doth the danger grow.  
How thinkst thou? hast thou such a heart,  
That thou and I a while may part  
To make joy greater in a while?"

   She smiled, but something in her smile  
Was like the heralding of tears, <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>  
When lonely pain the grieved heart bears.  
But he sprang up unto his feet,  
Glad ’gainst his will, and cried; "O sweet,  
Fear nought at all, for certainly  
Thy fated fellow still am I;  
Tell me the tale, and let me go  
The nighest way to meet the foe."

   Something there was, that for a while  
Made her keep silence; with a smile  
His bright flushed visage did she note,  
And put her hand unto her throat  
As though she found it hard to breathe;  
At last she spake:  
                    "The long years seethe  
With many things, until at last  
From out their caldron is there cast  
Somewhat like poison mixed with food;  
To leave the ill, and take the good  
Were sweet indeed, but nowise. life,  
Where all things ever are at strife.  
Thou, knowing not belike, and I,  
Wide-eyed indeed and wilfully,  
Through these three years have ever striven  
To take the sweet of what was given  
And cast the bitter half aside;  
But fate his own time well can bide,  
And so it fares with us to-day.  
Bear this too, that I may not say <span id="page_72">p. 72</span>  
What danger threatens; thou must go  
Unto thy land and nothing know  
Of what shall be—a hard, hard part  
For such as thee, with patient heart  
To sit alone, and hope and wait,  
Nor strive in anywise with fate,  
Whatever doubt on thee may fall,  
Unless by certain sign I call  
On thee to help me: to this end  
Each day at nightfall shalt thou wend  
Unto that place, where thou and I  
First met; there let an hour go by,  
And if thereby nought hap to thee  
Of strange, then deem thou certainly  
All goeth, or too well or ill  
For thee to help, and bide thou still."

   She had arisen, side by side  
They stood now, and all red had died  
From out his face, most wan he grew,  
He faltered forth:  
                   "Would that I knew,  
If thou hadst ever loved me, sweet!  
Then surely all things would I meet  
With good heart."  
                     Such a trouble came  
Across his face, that she, for shame  
Of something hidden, blushed blood-red,  
Then turned all pale again, and said: <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

   "Thou knowest that I love thee well!  
What shall I do then? can I tell  
In one short moment all the love  
That through these years my heart did move?  
Come nigher, love, and look at me,  
That thou in these mine eyes mayst see  
If long enow this troubled dream,  
That men call life, mine heart may deem  
To love thee in."  
                  His arms he cast  
About her and his tears fell fast,  
Nor was she dry-eyed; slowly there  
Did their lips part, her fingers fair  
Sought for his hand:  
                     "Come, love," she said,  
"Time wears;" withal the way she led  
Unto the place where first he woke  
Betwixt a hawthorn and an oak,  
And said: "Lie down, and dream a dream,  
That nought real, wasted then may seem  
When next we meet! yet hear a word  
Ere sleep comes: thou mayst well be stirred  
By idle talk, or longings vain,  
To wish me in thine arms again;  
Long then, but let no least word slip  
Of such a longing past thy lip;  
For if thou dost, so strangely now  
Are we twain wedded, I and thou,  
And that same golden green-stoned ring <span id="page_74">p. 74</span>  
Is token of so great a thing  
That at thy word I needs must come  
Whereso I be unto thine home;  
And so were both of us undone:  
Because the great-eyed glaring sun  
That lights your world, too mighty is  
To look upon our secret bliss.  
—What more to say or e’er thou sleep?  
I would I yet had time to weep  
All that I would, then many a day  
Would pass, or thou shouldst go away.  
But time wears, and the hand of fate,  
For all our weeping, will not wait.  
—Yet speak, before sleep wrap thee round,  
That I once more may hear the sound  
Of thy sweet voice, if never more."

   For all her words she wept right sore.  
"What wouldest thou?" he said in turn,  
"Thou know’st for thee and peace I yearn  
Past words—but now thy lips have sealed,  
My lips with mysteries unrevealed;  
How shall I pray, this bitter morn  
That joy and me atwain hath torn?  
While yet as in a dream it is  
Both bliss and this strange end of bliss.  
Ah what more can I say thereof?  
That never any end of love  
I know, though all my bliss hath end; <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
That where thou willest I will wend,  
Abide where thou wouldst have me stay,  
Pass bitter day on bitter day  
Silent of thee, and make no sign  
Of all the love and life divine,  
That is my life and knowledge now."

   And with that word he lay a-low  
And by his side she knelt, and took  
His last kiss with a lovely look,  
Mingled of utmost love and ruth  
And knowledge of the hidden truth.  
And then he heard her sing again  
Unknown words to a soft low strain,  
Till dim his senses waxed, nor knew  
What things were false, and what were true,  
Mid all the things he saw and heard,  
But still among strange-plumaged bird,  
Strange-fruited tree, and strange-clad maid,  
And horrors making not afraid  
Of changing man, and dim-eyed beast,  
—Through all he deemed he knew at least  
That over him his true-love hung  
And ’twixt her sobs in sweet voice sung  
That mystic song, until at last  
Into the dreamless land he passed  
Of deep, dark sleep without a flaw  
Where nought he heard and nought he saw. <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

   Amidst unreasoning huge surprise,  
Remembering nought, he oped his eyes  
And leapt up swiftly, and there stood  
Blinking upon a close beech-wood  
As one who knew not aught of it;  
Yet in a while ’gan memory flit  
Across him, and he muttered low  
Unwitting words said long ago  
When he was yet a child; then turned  
To where the autumn noon-sun burned  
Bright on a cleared space of the wood,  
Where midst rank grass a spruce-tree stood,  
Tall, grey-trunked, leafless a long way,  
And memory of another day,  
Like to a dream within a dream  
Therewith across his heart ’gan gleam,  
And gazing up into the tree,  
He raised his right arm suddenly,  
E’en as he fain would climb the same;  
Then, as his vision clearer came,  
He muttered, 'O Nay, gone is the nest,  
Nor is it spring-tide; it were best  
Unto the stead to hurry back,  
Or else my dinner may I lack,  
For father's grip is close enow."  
   And therewithal, with head hung low,  
Even as one who needs not sight,  
And looking nor to left nor right,  
Through blind ways of the wood he went, <span id="page_77">p.
77</span>  
Seeming as he were right intent  
On heavy thoughts, as well might be,  
But scarcely waked yet verily,  
Or knowing in what place he was.  
   In such wise swiftly did he pass  
Without a check straight through the wood,  
Until on the slope-side he stood,  
Where all its tangles were clean done;  
There staying, while the unclouded sun  
Gleamed on the golden braveries  
That clad him, did he raise his eyes,  
And ’neath his shading hand looked thence,  
And saw o’er well-tilled close and fence  
A little knot of roofs between  
Dark leaves, their ridges bright and green  
With spiky house-leek; and withal  
Man unto man did he hear call  
Afar amid the fields below;  
And then a hoarse loud horn ’gan blow  
No point of war, but peasant-call  
To hurry toward the steaming hall.  
Then as a red spark lights a flame  
Among light straw, all memory came  
Back-rushing on his heart, and he  
’Gan think of joy and misery,  
Trouble and hope, in tangled wise,  
Till longing in his heart ’gan rise  
Fretting with troublous ecstasy  
All else to nought. <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>  
                    So pensively  
Down the hill-side he slipped, and saw  
All folk unto the homestead draw,  
And noted how a homeman there  
Turned round unto the hillside bare  
Whereas amid the sun he went,  
Then side-long to his fellow bent  
And pointed, and all turned about  
And stood a while, as if in doubt  
Whether for him they should not stay,  
Yet went at last upon their way.  
Now thereat somewhat did he smile  
And walked the slower for a while,  
As though with something of a care  
To meet outside no loiterer,  
Then went on at a swifter pace:  
And all things with familiar face  
Gazed on him; till again the shame  
Of not being of them o’er him came.

   Most fair to peaceful heart was all,  
Windless the ripe fruit down did fall,  
The shadows of the large grey leaves  
Lay grey upon the oaten sheaves  
By the garth-wall as he past by;  
The startled ousel-cock did cry  
As from the yew-tree by the gate  
He flew; the speckled hen did wait  
With outstretched neck his coming in, <span id="page_79">p. 79</span>  
The March-hatched cockerel gaunt and thin  
Crowed shrilly, while his elder thrust  
His stiff wing-weathers in the dust  
That grew aweary of the sun:  
The old and one-eyed cart-horse dun  
The middenstead went hobbling round  
Blowing the light straw from the ground.  
With curious eyes the drake peered in  
O’er the barn's dusk, where dust and din  
Were silent now a little space.

There for a while with anxious face,  
Yet smiling therewithal, John stood,  
Then toward the porch of carven wood  
He turned, and hearkened to the hum  
Of mingled speech that thence did come  
Through the dumb clatter of the hall,  
Lest any word perchance might fall  
Upon his ears to tell of aught  
That change or death thereto had brought,  
And, listening so, deemed he could hear  
His father's voice, but nothing clear,  
And then a pause, and then again  
The mingled speech of maids and men.  
Again some word remembered  
From old days half aloud he said,  
And pulled his hood about his brow,  
And went with doubtful steps and slow  
Unto the door, and took the horn, <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
His own hand time past did adorn,  
And blew a loud, clear blast thereon,  
And pushed the door, then like a sun  
New come to a dull world he stood,  
Gleaming with gold from shoes to hood,  
In the dusk doorway of the place  
Whence toward him now turned every face.  
   From ’neath his hood he gazed around,  
And soothly there few gaps he found;  
Amidmost of the upper board  
His brethren sat, Thorolf and Thord;  
He saw his sire, half risen up  
From the high-seat, a silver cup  
In his brown hand; and by his side  
His mother o’er her barm-cloth wide  
Gazed forward somewhat timidly  
The new-corner's bright weed to see.  
Small change in these indeed, John thought,  
By lapse of days had yet been wrought  
And for the rest, but one or two  
There were, he deemed, of faces new.  
There open-eyed, beer-can in hand,  
And staring did the damsels stand  
As he had known them; there he saw  
Haldor the Icelander half draw  
His heavy short-sword forth, as he  
The gleam of gold and steel did see  
Flash suddenly across the door—  
An old man skilled in ancient lore, <span id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
And John's own foster-sire withal.

   But on one face did John's eyes fall  
He needs must note—a woman leaned  
O’er Thord, and though her face was screened  
By his wide bush of light red hair  
Yet might he see that she was fair,  
And deemed his brother newly wed.

   And now, as thoughts ran through his head  
About the tale that he should tell,  
His sire, as one who knew right well  
What manners unto men were meet,  
Rose up and cried from out his seat:

   "Knight, or fair lord, whatso thou be’st,  
If thou mayst share a bonder's feast,  
Sit by me, eat and drink thy fill;  
For this my hall is open still  
To peaceful men of all degree."

   Strange seemed his own voice there to be  
To John, as he in feigned speech said:  
"Thanks have thou for thy goodlihead  
And welcome, goodman; certainly  
Hungry and weary-foot am I,  
And fain of rest, and strange withal  
To this your land, for it did fall,  
That e’en now as I chanced to ride <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>  
I lighted by a waterside  
To slake my thirst; and just as I  
Was drinking therefrom eagerly,  
A blue-winged jay, new-hatched in spring,  
Must needs start forth and fall to sing  
His villain plain-song o’er my head;  
And like a ghost come from the dead  
Was that unto my horse, I trow,  
Who swerved and went off quick enow,  
To leave me as a gangrel churl."

   "Thou seemest liker to an Earl,"  
His father said; "but come to meat,  
To hungry men are bannocks sweet."

   So by his father's side he sat  
And of that homely cheer he ate,  
Remembered well; and oft he sighed  
To think how far away and wide  
The years had set him from all this,  
And how that all-devouring bliss  
Had made the simple life of old  
As a dull tale too often told.  
But as he sat thereby, full oft  
The goodwife's eyes waxed sad and soft,  
Beholding him; she muttered low:

   "Alas! fair lips, I ought to know,  
Like unto lips that once hung here; <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
Eyes like to eyes that once were dear  
When all that body I could hold,  
And flaxen-white was hair of gold."

   So muttered she, but said not aught  
Aloud. Now the fair damsel brought  
Mead to the gay-clad man, and he  
Beheld her beauty thoughtfully,  
As she shook back her cloud of hair,  
And swung aside her figure fair,  
And clasped the cup with fingers slim,  
And poured and reached it forth to him;  
Then his heart changed again with shame  
As cold cup and warm fingers came  
Into his hand, the while his eyes  
A look in hers must needs surprise  
That made him flush, and she—the red  
O’er face and neck and bosom spread  
And her hand trembled; Thord the while  
Gazed on her with a foolish smile  
Across his wide face. So went by  
The hour of that festivity,  
And then the boards were set aside;  
But the host prayed his guest to bide  
As long as he had will thereto,  
And therewith to the field did go  
With sons and homemen, leaving John  
Among the women-folk alone. <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

   So these being set to rock and wool,  
John sat him down upon a stool  
And ’gan to ponder dreamily,  
’Mid longings, on the days gone by,  
And many a glance did Thord's wife steal  
Upon him as she plied the reel  
Not noted much, though once or twice  
His pensive eyes did meet her eyes,  
And troubled and abashed thereat  
He reddened. But the good wife sat  
Meanwhile, and ever span and span  
With steady fingers, and yet wan  
Her face was grown; her mouth and eyes  
Seemed troubled with deep memories.  
At last to Thord's wife did she turn  
And said:  
           "If honey we would earn  
Against Yule-tide, the weaving-room  
Must hear the clatter of the loom;  
Ere the long web is fully done;  
So, Thorgerd, thither get thee gone;  
Thou, Asa, to the cloth-room go  
And wait me there; and for you two,  
Mary and Kirstin, best were ye  
Sitting in Thorgerd's company,  
To give her help with reel and thread  
And shuttle."  
               Therewith, as she said,  
So did they, and went, one and all; <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>  
But in the doorway of the hall  
Did Thorgerd for a moment stand,  
Holding her gownskirt in her hand,  
Her body swaying daintily,  
Nor cared to hold aback a sigh.  
Nor son, nor mother noted her,  
A little time the twain sat there  
Nor spake, though twice the goodwife strove,  
But fear forbade her tongue to move;  
Nor had he noted much forsooth  
Midst his own longing and self-ruth,  
Her looks of loving and of doubt.  
So from the hall did she pass out,  
And left him there alone, and soon  
So longing dealt that afternoon  
That, fallen to musing pensively,  
In the lone hall, now scarce might he  
Know if his heart were glad or sad;  
And tunes within his head he had  
Of ancient songs learnt long ago,  
Remembered well through bliss and woe,  
And now withal a lovesome stave  
He murmured to a measure grave,  
Scarce thinking of its sense the while.  
But as he sat there, with a smile  
Came handmaid Asa back, who bare  
Heaped in her arms embroidered gear,  
Which by his feet did she let fall,  
Then gat her gone from out the hall; <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>  
John, startled, ceased a while his drone  
To gaze upon the gear cast down,  
And saw a dark blue cloak and hood  
Wrought with strange needlework and rude  
That showed the sun and stars and moon;  
Then, gazing, John remembered soon  
How for Yule sport four years agone  
That selfsame raiment he did on,  
And thinking on that bygone mirth  
His own rich cloak he cast to earth,  
And did on him half wittingly  
That long-forgotten bravery;  
And though the sun was warm that day  
He hugged himself in his old way  
Within the warmth of fold on fold  
As though he came from out the cold,  
And ’gan the hall to pace about;  
And at the last must needs break out  
Into a song remembered well,  
That of the Christmas joy did tell.

 

Outlanders, whence come ye last?  
   *The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
Through what green seas and great have ye past?  
   *Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

From far away, O masters mine,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*. <span
id="page_87">p. 87</span>  
We come to bear you goodly wine,  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

From far away we come to you,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
To tell of great tidings strange and true.  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

News, news of the Trinity,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
And Mary and Joseph from over the sea!  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

For as we wandered far and wide,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
What hap do ye deem there should us betide!  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

Under a bent when the night was deep,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
There lay three shepherds tending their sheep.  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

"O ye shepherds, what have ye seen,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
To slay your sorrow, and heal your teen?"  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

"In an ox-stall this night we saw,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*. <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span>  
A babe and a maid without a flaw.  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

"There was an old man there beside,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
His hair was white and his hood was wide.  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

"And as we gazed this thing upon,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
Those twain knelt down to the Little One.  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

"And a marvellous song we straight did hear,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*.  
That slew our sorrow and healed our care."  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

News of a fair and a marvellous thing,  
*   The snow in the street and the wind on the door*,  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, we sing!  
*   Minstrels and maids, stand forth on the floor*.

 

   So sang he, and in pensive wise  
He sighed, but lifting up his eyes  
Beheld his mother standing nigh,  
Looking upon him pitifully.  
He ran to her, for now he knew <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>  
Her yearning love, round her he threw  
Strong arms, and cried out:  
                             "So it is,  
O mother, that some days of bliss  
I still may give thee; yet since I  
To thee at least will never lie  
Of what I am, and what I hope,  
And what with ill things I must cope,  
Sit thou aside, and look not strange  
When of my glory and great change  
I shall tell even such a tale  
As best for all things may avail.  
And if thou wouldst know verily  
Meanwhile, how matters fare with me,  
This thing of all things may I tell;  
I have been happy and fared well,  
But now with blind eyes must await  
Some unseen, half-guessed turn of fate,  
Before the dropping of the scale  
Shall make an ending to the tale,  
Or blithe or sad: think not meanwhile  
That fear my heart shall now beguile  
Of all the joy I have in thee."

   She wept about him tenderly  
A long while, ere she might say aught;  
Then she drew back, and some strange thought  
Stirred in her heart belike, for she  
Gazed at his splendour timidly, <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
For the rude cloak to earth was cast,  
And whispered trembling at the last.

   "Fair art thou come again, sweet son,  
And sure a long way hast thou gone,  
I durst not ask thee where: but this  
I ask thee by the first sweet kiss,  
Wherewith I kissed thy new-born face  
Long since within the groaning place—  
If thou hast been so far, that thou  
Canst tell to me—grown old, son, now,  
Through weary life, unsatisfied  
Desires, and lingering hope untried—  
If thou canst tell me of thy ruth,  
What thing there is of lies or truth,  
In what the new faith saith of those  
Great glories of the heavenly close,  
And how that poor folk twinned on earth  
Shall meet therein in joy and mirth."

   Smiling with pity and surprise,  
He looked into her wistful eyes,  
And kissed her brow therewith, and said:

   "Nought know I, mother, of the dead,  
More than thou dost—let be—we live  
This day at least, great joy to give  
Each unto other: but the tale  
Must come from thee about the dale, <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>  
And what has happed therein, since I  
That summer eve went off to try  
What thing by folly might be wrought  
When strength and wisdom came to nought."

   She smiled amid her tears, and there  
She told him all he fain would hear,  
And happily they talked till eve,  
When the men-folk the field did leave  
And gat them to the hall, and then  
Was great rejoicing of all men  
Within a while, for, cloak and hood  
Thrown off, in glittering gear John stood  
And named himself; yet scarcely now  
His father durst his arms to throw  
Round his son's neck, remembering  
How he had thought him such a thing  
As scarce was meet his bread to win.  
Small thought had John of that old sin,  
Yea, scarce had heart to think of aught,  
But when again he should be brought  
Face to face with his love; and slow  
The leaden minutes lingered now;  
Nor could he fail to hope that he  
That very hour her face would see;  
Needs must he hope that his strong love,  
So sore the heart in her must move,  
That she no more might bear his pain. <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

   That very hour, he thought again—  
That very hour; woe worth the while,  
Why should his heart not feel her smile  
Now, now?—O weary time, O life,  
Consumed in endless, useless strife,  
To wash from out the hopeless clay  
Of heavy day and heavy day  
Some specks of golden love, to keep  
Our hearts from madness ere we sleep!

   Good welcome if of clownish kind  
Did John from both his brethren find,  
And from the homemen; Thorgerd seemed  
As somewhat less of him she deemed  
Than heretofore, and smiled, as she  
Put up her fair cheek daintily  
To take his kiss. So went the night  
Midst mirth and manifold delight,  
Till John at last was left alone  
To think upon the strange day gone,  
Scarce knowing yet, if nearer drew  
His bliss because it was gone through.

   Now in such wise, day passed by day,  
Till heavier on him longing lay,  
As still less strange it was to wake  
And no kind kiss of welcome take,  
And welcome with no loving kiss,  
Kind eyes to a new day of bliss; <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>  
And as the days passed o’er his head  
Sometimes he needs must wake in dread,  
That all the welfare, that did seem  
To be his life, was but a dream,  
Or all at least slipped swiftly by  
Into a wretched memory.  
Yet would hope leave him not, yea, whiles  
Wrapped round about by her strange guiles  
All seemed to go right well, and oft  
Would memory grow so sweet and soft,  
That scarce the thing it imaged had  
More might in it to make him glad.

   Well may ye deem that mid all this  
His brooding face would cloud the bliss  
Of many a boisterous night; his sire  
Would mutter, "He has clomb up higher.  
But still is moonstruck as before;"  
His brethren ill his silence bore,  
Yet feared him; such a tale he told  
That in that mead he did behold  
Strange outland people come that morn,  
'By whom afar he had been borne  
Into a fair land, where, he said,  
Thriving, the king's child did he wed  
Within a while; "Now, when once more  
Their keels shall leave their noble shore,  
At Norway will they touch, and then  
Back go I with those goodly men, <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>  
Now I have seen my land and kin."

   Fair Thorgerd ever sought to win  
Kind looks of him, and many a day  
She from the hall would go away  
To rage within some secret place,  
That all the sweetness of her face,  
Her lingering fingers, her soft word,  
’Twixt red half-opened lips scarce heard,  
Had bought for her so little ruth;  
Although there seemed some times, in sooth,  
When John, grown weary of the strife  
Within him between dreams and life,  
Must think it not so over ill  
To watch her hand the shuttle fill,  
While on her cheek the red and white  
Flickered and changed with new delight,  
And hope of being a thing to move  
That dreamy man to earthly love.

   So autumn fell to winter-tide,  
And ever there did John abide,  
’Mid hope deferred and longing fierce,  
That strove the heavy veil to pierce;  
And howso strong his love might be,  
Yet were there tides of misery,  
When, in his helpless, hopeless rage,  
He felt himself as in a cage  
Shown to the gaping world; again <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  
Would heavy languor dull his pain,  
And make it possible to live,  
And wait to see if fate would give  
Some pleasure yet ere all was done.

   Meantime, with every setting sun,  
Unto the meadow as she bade  
He went, and often, half afraid  
Half hopeful, did he watch the night  
Suck slowly in the lingering light;  
But of the homefolk, though all knew  
Whither his feet at evening drew,  
Yet now so great a man he was,  
None asked him why he needs must pass  
Each eve along the self-same way,  
Save Thorgerd, who would oft waylay  
His feet returning, and would watch  
Some gesture or some word to catch  
From his unwariness; and whiles  
Her tender looks and words and smiles  
Would seem to move him now, and she  
Laughed to herself delightedly;  
And as the days grew heavier  
To John, he oft would gaze on her,  
At such times as she tripped along,  
And wonder where would be the wrong  
If he should tell her of his tale;  
Withal he deemed her cheek grew pale,  
As unto Yule-tide drew the days, <span id="page_96">p. 96</span>  
And oft into her eyes would gaze  
In such kind wise, that she awhile  
Forgot her foolishness and guile  
Surprised by sparks of inner love.

   Yet nothing a long while did move  
His mouth to fatal speech, until  
When the snow lay on moor and hill  
And it was Yule-day, he did go  
’Twixt the high drift o’er beaten snow  
Unto the meadow, as the day  
Short, wind-bewildered, died away.  
And so, being come unto the thorn  
Where first that bitter love was born,  
He gazed around, but nothing saw  
But endless waste of grey clouds draw  
O’er the white waste, while cold and blind  
The earth looked; e’en the north-west wind  
Found there no long abiding place,  
But ever the low clouds did chase  
Nor let them weep their frozen tears.

   Strange is it how the grieved heart bears  
Long hours and days and months of woe,  
As dull and leaden as they go,  
And makes no sign, yea, and knows not  
How great a burden it bath got  
Upon it, till all suddenly  
Some thought scarce heeded shall flit by, <span id="page_97">p.
97</span>  
That tears the veil as by it goes  
With seeming careless hand, and shows  
The shrinking soul that deep abyss  
Of days to come all bare of bliss.  
And now with John e’en so it fared.  
He saw his woe and longing bared  
Before his eyes, as slow and slow  
The twilight crept across the snow,  
Like to the dying out of hope;  
And suddenly he needs must cope  
With that in-rushing of despair  
Long held aback, till all things there  
Seemed grown his foes, his prison-wall;  
And, whatso good things might befall  
To others of the wide world, he  
Was left alone with misery.  
Why should he hold his peace or strive  
Amid these men as man to live  
Who recked not of him? Then he cried:

   "Would God, would God, that I had died  
Before the accursed name of Love  
My miserable heart did move!  
Why did I leave thee in such wise,  
False heart, with lovesome, patient eyes,  
And soul intent to do thy will?  
And why, why must I love thee still, .  
And long for thee, and cast on thee  
Blessings wrung out of misery, <span id="page_98">p. 98</span>  
That will not bless thee, if in sooth  
On my wrecked heart thou hast no ruth?  
O come, come, come to me, my love,  
If aught my heart thy heart may move,  
For I am wretched and alone,  
With head grown wild, heart turned to stone,  
Come, if there yet be truth in thee!"

   He gazed about him timorously  
While thus he spake, as though he thought  
To see some sudden marvel wrought  
In earth and heaven; some dreadful death,  
Some sight, as when God threateneth  
The world with speedy end; but still  
Unchanged, o’er mead and wold and hill  
Drave on the dull low twilight rack,  
Till all light seemed the sky to lack,  
And the snow-shrouded earth to gain  
What it had lost.  
                   "In vain, in vain!"  
He cried, "and I was well bewrayed;  
She wept o’er me when I was laid  
Upon the grass beside her feet,  
    Because a pleasure somewhat sweet  
She needs must lay aside, while I—  
—What tears shall help my misery?"

   Then back he turned in e’en such mood  
As when one thing seems no more good <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>  
Than is another, and will seems  
To move the body but by dreams  
Of ancient life and energy.  
But as he wandered listlessly  
Midst the wind's howling, and the drift  
Of light snow that its force did lift,  
And gained at last the garth's great gate,  
He started back, for there did wait  
A grey form in the dull grey night,  
Yea, and a woman's; strange affright,  
Strange hope possessed him, and he strove  
To cry aloud some word of love,  
But his voice failed him; she came nigh  
And drew up to him quietly,  
Not speaking; when she reached his side  
Her hand unto his hand did glide  
And thrilled him with its soft warm touch,  
He stammered:  
                  "Have I loved too much,  
Have I done wrong? I called thee, dear;  
Speak, love, and take away my fear!"

   A soft voice answered, "O speak not!  
I cannot bear my joy, o’er hot  
Waxeth my heart, when in such wise  
Thou art changed to me—O thine eyes,  
I see them through the darksome night  
Gazing upon me! sweet delight,  
How shall I deal with all my bliss <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>  
So that the world know nought of this,  
When scarce now I may breathe or stand  
Holding thy lovesome clinging hand."

   Now therewith Thorgerd's voice he knew,  
And from her hand his hand he drew,  
While o’er his heart there swept again  
The bitter blast of doubting pain,  
And scarce he knew who by his side  
Was going, as aloud he cried:

   "In vain I call; thou comest not  
And all our love is quite forgot;  
What new world hast thou got to rule?  
What mockeries mak’st thou of the fool  
Who trusted thee? Alas, alas!  
Whatever ill may come to pass  
Still must I love thee."  
                       Now by him  
Went Thorgerd silent, every limb  
Tingling with madness and desire;  
Love lit within her such a fire  
As e’en that eve in nowise cooled,  
As of her sweet, fresh hope befooled  
She strove to speak, and found no word  
To tell wherewith her heart was stirred.  
So on they went, she knowing nought  
The bitterness of his ill thought,  
He heeding not in any wise <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>  
The wretchedness of her surprise,  
Until, thus far estranged, they carne  
To where the hall's bright light did flame  
Over a space of trodden snow.  
Faster a space then did she go,  
But, as they drew anigh the door,  
Stopped suddenly, and stood before  
The musing, downcast man, and laid  
A hand upon his breast, and said,  
In a low smothered voice:  
                             "Wait now,  
And tell me straightly what didst thou  
To call me love, and then to cry  
Thy love came not? I am anigh,  
What wouldst thou have, did I not move  
Thy cold heart? am I not thy love?"

   Then, trembling as those words she spoke,  
She cast to earth her heavy cloak;  
From head to foot clad daintily,  
Meet for that merry tide was she;  
A silver girdle clasped around  
Her well-wrought loins, her fair hair crowned  
With silver, and her gown enwrought  
With flowers whereof that tide knows nought;  
Nor needed she that rich attire  
To set a young man's heart afire,  
For she was delicately made  
As is the lily; there she swayed, <span id="page_102">p. 102</span>  
Leaned forward to the strenuous wind  
That her gay raiment intertwined  
About her light limbs. Gazing there,  
Bewildered with a strange despair,  
John saw her beauty, yet in sooth  
Something within him slew all ruth  
If for a moment:  
                 "Ah, what love,  
What love," he cried, "my heart should move,  
But mine own love, my worshipped sweet?  
Would God that her beloved feet  
Would bless our threshold this same night!"

   Then, even as a sudden light  
Shows to some wretch the murderer's knife  
Drawing anear his outworn life,  
Knowledge rushed o’er him, and too late  
Did he bethink him of the fate  
That threatened, and, grown wild and blind,  
He turned to meet the western wind  
That hurried past him, thinking, "Now  
At least the formless sky will show  
Some sign of my undoing swift;  
Surely the sightless rack will lift  
To show some dreadful misery,  
Some image of the summer sky  
Defaced by the red lightning's sword."  
So spake he, and the fierce wind roared  
Amid the firs in sullen wise, <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>  
But nothing met his fearful eyes  
Save the grey waste of night. Withal  
He turned round slowly to the hall,  
Trembling, yet doubtful of his heart,  
Doubtful of love. But for her part  
Thorgerd, half mad with love, had turned  
And fled from him; a red spot burned  
Amidst each smooth cheek, and her eyes  
Afire with furious jealousies,  
Followed him down the hall, as he  
Went toward the dais listlessly,  
And the loud horns blew up to meat,  
And restless were her fevered feet  
Throughout the feast that now befell.

   Now thereat men were served right well,  
And most were merry, and the horn  
Full oft from board to beard was borne;  
But no mead brewed of mortal man  
Could make John's face less wild and wan;  
For a long while he trembled sore  
Whene’er the west-wind shook the door  
More than its wont; nor heeded he  
The curse of Thorgerd's misery  
Wild-gleaming from her eyes; and when  
She fell to talk with the young men  
With hapless, haggard merriment,  
No pang throughout his heart there went:  
For clear across it were there borne <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>  
Pictures of all the life forlorn  
That should be, yea, his life he saw,  
Unhelped and heavy-burdened, draw  
Through the dull joyless years, until  
The bitter measure they should fill,  
And he, unloved, unsatisfied,  
Unkissed, from foolish hope should hide  
In some dark corner of death's house.

   Yet, as the feast grew clamorous  
About him, and the night went past,  
The respite wrought on him at last,  
And from its midst did he begin  
A little rest from fear to win,  
And in the feast he joined and seemed  
No more as in their midst he dreamed.

   So passed a space, till presently  
As with a beaker raised on high  
He stood, and called on some great name  
Writ in the book of northern fame,  
Across the wind there came a sound  
As though afar a horn were wound,  
A dreadful sound to him; the men  
Sat hearkening, till it came again  
Nigher and sharper now, and John,  
Grown white, laid his left hand upon  
His beating heart; and then once more  
Loud rang the horn close by the door, <span id="page_105">p.
105</span>  
And men began in haste to take  
Their weapons for their safety's sake;  
But John, the cup in his right hand,  
His left upon his heart, did stand,  
And might not either move nor speak.

   Then cried the goodman, "Not so weak  
Are we, but these may well come in  
Unmet with weapons; they shall win  
All good things on this stormy night;  
Go welcome them to our delight;  
For on this merry tide of Yule  
Shall Christ the Lord all matters rule."

   Then opened they the door, and strong  
The wild wind swept the hall along,  
Driving the hangings here and there,  
Making the torches ruddier,  
Darkening the fires. But therewithal  
An utter hush came o’er the hall,  
And no man spake of bad or good;  
For in the midst of them there stood  
A white-clad woman, white as though  
A piece of fair moonlitten snow  
Had entered the red smoky hall.  
Then sweet speech on their ears did fall  
Thrilling all hearts through:  
                             "Joy and peace  
Be on this house, and all increase <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>  
Of all good things! and thou, my love,  
I knew how sore desire must move  
Thy longing heart, and I am come  
To look upon thee in thy home:  
Come to me, give me welcome here!"

   He stepped adown, and shame and fear  
Mixed with the joyful agony  
Of love and longing, as anigh  
He drew unto her loveliness.  
A moment, and his arms did press  
His own love to his heaving breast,  
And for an instant of sweet rest  
Midst clinging hands and trembling kiss  
Did he forget all things but bliss;  
And still she murmured:  
                        "Now rejoice  
That far away I heard thy voice  
And came! rejoice this night at least,  
And make good ending to the feast!"

   Therewith from out his arms she drew,  
Yet held his hand still; scarce he knew  
Of where he was, and who were round,  
And strange and flat his voice did sound  
Unto himself, as now he spake:

   "Kinsmen, see her, who for my sake  
Has left her mighty state and home, <span id="page_107">p. 107</span>  
Fair beyond words, that she might come  
With you a little to abide!  
How say ye, are ye satisfied  
Her sweet face in your midst to see?"

   Therewith, though somewhat timidly,  
Folk shouted; sooth, they deemed her such  
As mortal man might scarcely touch  
Or dare to love; with fear fulfilled,  
With shame of their rough joyance chilled,  
They sat, scarce moving: but to John  
Some sweet familiar thing seemed won  
Despite his fear, as down the hall  
He led her: if his eyes did fall  
On Thorgerd's face, how might he heed  
The anguish of unholpen need,  
That filled her heart with all despair,  
As on the twain her eyes did glare?

   Now softly to the fair high-seat  
With trembling hand he led his sweet,  
Who kissed the goodman and goodwife,  
And wished them fair and happy life,  
Then like the earth's and heaven's queen,  
She sat there beauteous and serene,  
Till, as men gazed upon her there,  
Joy of her beauty slew their fear;  
Hot grew their hearts now, as they turned  
Eyes on her that with strange light burned: <span id="page_108">p.
108</span>  
And wild and eager grew the speech  
Wherewith they praised her each to each,  
As ’neath her eyes they sat.  
                             If he  
Who knew the full felicity  
Of all they longed for, hushed at whiles,  
Might answer not her healing smiles  
With aught but sad imploring eyes,  
When he bethought him in what wise  
She there was come—yet none the less  
Amid bewildered happiness  
The time went by; until at last  
Night waned, and slowly all folk passed  
From out the hall, and the soft sleep  
O’er all the marvelling house did creep,  
Bearing to folk that night such dreams,  
As showed, through wild things, very gleams  
Of heaven and perfect love, to last  
Till grey light o’er the world was cast.

   But, midst the other folk, she too  
His mazed and doubtful footsteps drew  
Unto the chamber; when alone  
They were, and his warm heart seemed one  
With her and bliss, without a word  
She gazed on him, and like a sword,  
Cleaving the very heart atwain  
That look was, laden with all pain,  
All love and ruth that she might feel. <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

   So through the dark the hours did steal  
Slow toward the rising of the sun;  
But long or ere the night was done  
He slept within her arms, nor heard  
The sobs wherewith her breast was stirred,  
Nor felt the tears and kisses sweet  
That round his set calm face did beat,  
As round its dead mate beats a bird  
With useless flutter no more heard:  
Nor did he move when she unwound  
The arms that clasped her breast around,  
And, weeping sore, the gold ring drew  
From off his hand: and nought he knew  
When from the bed at last she slid,  
And, with her body all unhid,  
Stood gazing on him till a sigh  
Burst from her heart; and wearily  
From her sad tear-stained troubled face  
She swept her hair back:  
                         "O the days,  
Thy weary days, love! Dream not then  
Of named lands, and abodes of men!  
Alas, alas, the loneliest  
Of all such were a land of rest  
When set against the land where I  
Unhelped must note the hours go by!  
Ah, that my hope thy dream might pierce!  
That mid the dreadful grief and tears,  
Which presently shall rend thine heart, <span id="page_110">p.
110</span>  
This word the cloud might draw apart—  
My feet, lost Love, shall wander soon  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon!*  
Tell not old tales of love, so strong,  
That all the world with all its wrong  
And heedlessness was weak to part  
The loving heart from loving heart?"

   Therewith she turned about, and now  
She wept no more; her cheeks ’gan glow,  
And her eyes glittered, and no more  
Sorrow her kind mouth brooded o’er,  
And strange, unearthly beauty shone  
O’er all her face, whence ruth was gone,  
Till the dim-litten place was glad  
That in the midst thereof it had  
Her loveliness grown dangerous;  
Softly she gat her through the house  
Where here and there a dying light  
Shone on her wondrous limbs and white  
As through the rough place dreamily  
She moved: yet was the night wind high  
And its rude hand, as it did shake  
Window and door, served but to make  
The inner stillness yet more still.  
The clouds were riven; o’er the hill  
The white moon shone out, yet its light  
Made the deep night so much more night,  
That now it seemed as ne’er again <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>  
The sun would bless the eyes of men;  
That all the world had fallen to death.

   So on she passed, her odorous breath  
Seen now amidst the moonlit hall,  
Her unshod foot's light steady fall,  
The waving of her gust-moved hair,  
Well-nigh the lonely place might hear  
Despite the rush and stir without,  
As, slowly, yet all void of doubt  
She raised the latchet of the door,  
And let the wind and moonlight pour  
Wild clamour and strange light therethrough.  
She paused not; the wild west wind blew  
Her hair straight out from her; her feet  
The bitter, beaten snow did meet  
And shrank not; slowly forth she passed  
Nor backward any look she cast,  
Nor gazed to right or left, but went  
With eyes on the far sky intent  
Into the howling, doubtful night,  
Until at last her body white  
And its black shadow on the snow,  
No more the drift-edged way did know.

 

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

*AGAIN the thread snapped; Gregory lay  
Awake; nor what had passed away  
Of the short night could tell, till he  
Through the tent's opening seemed to see  
A change creep o’er the moonlit sky;  
So there a short while did he lie  
Striving to think what he had dreamed,  
Till utterly awake he seemed;  
And then, since no more on that night  
He thought to sleep, and lost delight  
Of the past dream grown more than dim,  
With causeless longing wearied him,  
He rose and left the tent once more,  
And passed down slowly toward the shore  
Until the boat he came unto:  
And there he set himself to do  
What things were needed to the gear,  
Until he saw the dawn draw near  
Across the sea: then, e’en as one  
Who through a marvellous land hath gone  
In sleep, and knowing nought thereof  
To tell, yet knows strange things did move  
About his sightless journeying,  
So felt he; and yet seemed to bring,  
Now and again, some things anigh  
Unto the wavering boundary  
’Twixt sight and blindness that awhile  
Our troubled waking will beguile* <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>  
*When happy dreams have just gone by,  
And left us without remedy  
Within the unpitying hands of life*.

*   At last, amid perplexing strife  
With things half seen, drowsy he grew  
Once more, and ever slower drew  
The tough brown lines from hand to hand,  
Until he sank upon the sand  
Beside the boat, and, staring out  
O’er the grey sea, lost hope and doubt  
In little while, nor noted now  
The dawn's line wide and wider grow,  
Nor waning of the shadow deep  
The moon cast from the boat; till sleep  
Had closed his eyes, and in the cold  
Of the first dawn the ending told  
 that sweet tale. Yet so it was,  
That the King's hall and feast did pass  
Clean from his mind; and now it seemed  
That of no tale-telling he dreamed,  
But of his own life grown to be  
A new and marvellous history*.

*   Midst hope and fear and wretchedness,  
And Love, that all things doth redress,  
Adown the stream of fate he moved  
As the carle's son, the well-beloved,  
The fool of longing; in such wise  
He dealt with his own miseries*. <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

 

THE winter night was on the wane  
When the poor wretch woke up again;  
The lone strange sound of cock-crow moved  
His heart to dream of his beloved  
’Twixt sleep and waking, and he turned  
A face with utmost love that yearned  
And sighed, as his hot hand stole forth  
To touch a body of more worth  
To him than Heaven's unmeasured years;  
Upon his face were undried tears  
Left by some dream, and yet he smiled  
To think of deep joy so beguiled  
By sadness dreamed; his lips began  
To speak a name unknown to man.  
A little while in bliss he lay  
And gathered thoughts of day on day  
More joyful each than each, until  
Sweet thankful love his soul did fill  
With utter ecstasy of bliss,  
And low he murmured:  
                         "Kind she is  
Beyond all kindness ever told!  
Thou wilt not leave me more, a-cold  
In the rough world; thou knowest how  
My weak and clinging heart will grow  
Unto the strength of thy great heart.  
O surely no more shall we part, <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>  
And never canst thou hurt me more  
Till all the world and time is o’er!"

   The moonlight waned, on drew the morn,  
The lessened west wind moaned forlorn  
In the garth nooks; the eaves dripped now  
Beneath the thaw, the faint cock-crow  
Through the dull dawn, and no sound more  
He heard. Awake, and yearning sore,  
He turned about and cried:  
                           "Wake, wake!  
Day cometh, and my heart doth ache  
To think how sleep still takes from me  
Some minutes of felicity,  
From me and thee, my love, my sweet!  
O think of Death's forgotten feet,  
That somewhere surely drawn anigh,  
And let no minute more pass by  
With our lips parted each from each!"

   Wildly the ending of his speech  
Rang from his lips, all strange, as though  
The thought once thought needs thence must go  
In words, though all the world were changed.  
Wildly his opened eyes now ranged  
The twilight chamber void of her,  
And through his heart shot such a fear  
As words may tell not—nay indeed  
No fear—for now he knew the meed <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>  
Of his fool's word, and for a while  
No hope was left that might beguile  
His misery and his loneliness,  
No eager sight, born of distress,  
Might pierce the cloud that o’er him spread.  
Such wild thoughts filled his 'wildered head,  
As once or twice may men endure  
Yet live; for the earth seemed not sure,  
Or the air fleeting; fire burned not,  
Nor water moyed; the snow was hot,  
The dark hid nought; the coming day  
No longer sober seemed and grey,  
But full of flashing light and blue.  
Yet all things round him well he knew,  
More real they seemed than e’er before,  
They would not change, nor would pass o’er  
One instant of his agony.  
It was as he had seen time die,  
And good turn evil ’neath his eyes,  
And God live to forge miseries  
For him alone, for him alone,  
For all the world beside seemed gone.

   A short while, risen in his bed,  
He hung his wretched brooding head  
Above the place her limbs had warmed,  
And shrieked not, though strange curses swarmed  
About his heart, and wild and fierce  
Strove hard his dead despair to pierce, <span id="page_117">p.
117</span>  
And might not: nought his heart might ease  
Or for a moment gain him peace.  
Yet in that time of utter ill,  
Some reflex of the guiding will  
That moved his limbs in happier days  
Still wrought in him; round did he gaze  
With set eyes, and arose withal;  
And e’en therewith a thought did fall  
Upon him that some succour brought,  
"How can I meet their eyes?" he thought,  
"How can I bear to hear again  
The voices of the sons of men?"

And, nigh unwitting, at that word,  
Hearkening the while if any stirred,  
He clad himself and gazed around  
The place once more, and on the ground  
There lay her raiment: then he turned  
His head away, for wild-fire burned  
Within it, and he strove to speak;  
But, lest his wretched heart should break  
And torment end on that first day  
A new pain did his pain allay,  
And bitter tears and wailing came  
To dull the fierceness of the flame  
That so consumed him; and withal  
Desire of wandering forth ’gan fall  
Upon him, though he knew not where  
In all the world to seek for her. <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

   So, ere his burning tears were spent,  
Through the unwakened hall he went,  
And kissed the threshold of the door  
Her well-loved feet had touched before,  
Yet saw no signs upon the snow  
Of those departing feet to show.  
Cold blew the wind upon his face,  
As now he left behind the place  
Where he was born, nor turned again  
To look farewell; for nought and vain  
Seemed all things but his misery,  
That now had grown his life to be,  
Not to be given away for aught  
That earth might hold; nor had he thought  
That anything his lot could change,  
That anything could more be strange,  
Lovesome or fearful to his heart,  
Or in his life have any part.

   So he went on from that abode,  
Along a well-known, oft-trod road,  
He knew not why or where, until  
Clean hidden by a bare waste hill,  
Were the snow-covered roofs wherein  
His outward life did first begin.  
Then as he wandered on forlorn,  
From out his unrest was there born  
Some faint half-memory, that did seem  
To be the remnant of a dream; <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>  
Some image to his mind there clung,  
Some speech upon his lips yet hung  
He might not utter.  
                    And now he  
Had gone so long that the wide sea  
He saw afar, when the dull day  
Toward eve again had passed away,  
Amidst the utter solitude  
Of his time-slaying weary mood.  
But weak and way-worn was he now,  
Though greater did his longing grow  
To wander ever on and on,  
Until the unknown rest were won.  
And when he gazed from the hill-side,  
And saw the great sea spreading wide,  
All black and empty from the shore,  
So sharp a longing then came o’er  
His dull despair, such wild desire,  
That stung, as when a coal of fire  
Is laid upon an aching wound,  
He cast himself upon the ground,  
And in the cold snow writhed and wailed,  
While over him the sea-mew sailed,  
Not silent, and the wind wailed too,  
As though his bitter grief they knew,  
And mocked him.  
                     Yet or fell the night  
He rose, and on the waste of white  
Stood a black speck, then went until <span id="page_120">p. 120</span>  
The black night mingled sea and hill  
And hurrying rack in nothingness.  
Yet, kept alive by his distress,  
He fainted not, nor went astray,  
For as in dreams he knew the way  
At last, and whitherward he went,  
Since round the heart of strong intent  
His woe was wrapped.  
                        So o’er the down  
He went, until a haven-town  
Shone like a patch of stars on earth,  
And something like a hope had birth  
Within him, and somewhat he knew  
His will, now that his body grew  
Well-nigh too weak to bear him on.  
Yet to the town at last he won,  
So heartened now unto the task  
That he for food and rest might ask;  
And, since no lack of wealth he had,  
Soon did he make a goodman glad  
With gift of gold, and, all outworn,  
Forgot his grief, and life forlorn  
In long deep sleep most like to death.

   Now at that town, my story saith,  
Long must he bide, for so it was  
That then no good ship well might pass  
From land to land, for winter-tide  
Still made the narrow seas full wide. <span id="page_121">p.
121</span>  
Each morn did John wake there, to gaze  
With dead eyes on the waste of days,  
Each eve he laid him down to sleep,  
Much marvelling what his life did keep  
From passing: still the memory  
Of some faint, dreamlike thing gone by  
Perplexed his heart, and still he strove,  
Amid the anguish of his love,  
To speak that half-remembered word,  
Amidst a dream, belike, once heard.

   This helped him through his dull-eyed woe,  
That the time passed, and he should go  
To other lands ere many days,  
Seeming to seek for that lost face.

   At last the day desired came  
When o’er the land the Spring did flame  
With love and flowers; and on an eve  
John's good ship did the haven leave,  
And pale he stood upon the prow,  
And to the weary place, left now  
Behind with all its patience dead,  
No more had will to turn his head,  
But thinking of the future still,  
Amid the shipman's tangled skill,  
Stood looking toward the flaming West,  
With eyes made strange by love's unrest.

   Upon the deck that night he lay, <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>  
And nought he slept until the day  
Began to dawn, and woke again  
In short space, feeling little pain,  
And with his pale lips murmuring  
Some word half-dreamed, some fleeting thing.  
Then on his arm he rose, and saw  
The waste of waters seem to draw  
Unto him as the black prow clave  
With steady heart green wave on wave;  
None save the watch were on the deck,  
Who, sleepy-eyed, no whit did reck  
Of him and all his woe and love,  
But ’twixt the bulwarks slow did move,  
With little purpose, as it seemed;  
The helmsman steered as though he dreamed,  
Of seafolk's marvels vaguely told  
By firesides in the days of old;  
The light wind waxed and waned; the ship  
Still through the babbling waves did slip  
As though their talk she hearkened to:  
And ’midst it all John scarcely knew  
Whether he lived still, or was dead:  
Well-nigh it came into his head,  
That he by ghosts of men was borne  
From out his wasted life forlorn  
O’er a strange sea to some strange place  
Of unknown punishment or grace.  
Skyward he looked, and o’er the mast  
He saw the moon with all light passed <span id="page_123">p.
123</span>  
From out of her, and as he gazed  
The great sun o’er the green sea blazed,  
And smote his head with sudden light.

   Then in his heart the flame burned bright  
That long had smouldered there, he cried;  
"Ah, woe betide, ah, woe betide,  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon!*  
A land that no man findeth soon,  
The grave of greedy love that cries  
To all folk of its agonies:  
The prison of untrustful love,  
That thinketh a light word can move  
The heart of kindness, deep and wise.  
—O love, love, would thy once-kissed eyes  
Were glad to-day, that thy sweet smile  
Forgat a wretch so base and vile,  
That he but lived to make thee sad,  
To weep the days that once were glad!"

   But now the dreamlike sight that wrapped  
His soul all suddenly was snapped.  
He heard the watch cry out their cry,  
The helmsman answer cheerily,  
And mid the homely noise of these  
Freshened awhile the morning breeze,  
The ship leaned o’er the highway green,  
That led to England's meads unseen.

   At Dunwich, in the east country, <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>  
John landed from the weary sea,  
Not recking where on earth he was;  
But quickly therefrom did he pass,  
Driven by growing hope; that word  
In some old dream belike half heard,  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon*,  
Seemed unto him a heaven-sent boon,  
Yet made the merry world around  
A dreary cage, a narrow round  
Of dreamlike pain, a hollow place,  
Filled with a blind and dying race.

   That town and country-side, indeed,  
Seemed all the less to help his need,  
Whereas for common homely things  
That well he knew, with Easterlings  
And his own country-folk they dealt,  
And scarce knew aught of what folk dwelt  
Southward beyond the narrow seas;  
So giving few farewells to these,  
Towards London did he take his way,  
And, journeying on, at hostels lay  
Benights, or whiles at abbeys fair;  
And as his hope grew, would he dare,  
In manner of a tale, to tell  
In what wise woe upon him fell;  
And most men praised the tale enow,  
And said no minstrel-wight might show  
A merrier tale to feasting hall. <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>  
And so at last it did befall  
That at a holy house he lay,  
A noble house, forsooth, to-day,  
Men call St. Alban's; there he told  
Once more, as a thing known of old,  
The story of his hapless love:  
Such passion there his tongue did move,  
That in that Abbey's guest-chamber  
It was a better thing to hear  
Than many a history nobly writ,  
And much were all folk moved by it.  
But when his speech was fully done,  
From the board's end there rose up one,  
A little dry old monk, right wise  
Of semblance, with small glittering eyes,  
Who came to John, and said:  
                                "Thy tale,  
Fair son, shall much my need avail,  
For I have many such-like things  
Writ out for sport of lords and kings;  
Bide thou with us to-morn, I pray,  
And hearken some for half a day;  
For certes shall their memory  
Help thee to pass the dull days by,  
When thou growest old."  
                           Wide-eyed John stared,  
For scarce the old man's speech he heard,  
Or any speech of men, for still  
One thought his whole sad heart did fill. <span id="page_126">p.
126</span>  
Howbeit constrained, he knew not why,  
He heard full many a history  
Like to his own next morn, and went  
Yet more upon his love intent;  
Yet more the world seemed nought but this,  
Longing for bliss and losing bliss.  
And yet, of those fresh tales withal  
Some endings on his heart did fall  
As scarcely new; he ’gan to make  
Tales to himself, how for his sake  
She wept and waited; how some way  
To Love fulfilled yet open lay;  
The grey morn often would beguile  
With dreams his sad lips to a smile,  
While still his shut eyes did behold  
Once more her sweetness manifold;  
And if the waking from delight  
Unto the real day void and white,  
Were well-nigh more than man could bear,  
Yet his own sad voice would he hear  
Muttering as o’erword to the tune,  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon*.

   Now come to London at the last,  
Among the chapmen there he passed,  
And many a tale of them he had  
Concerning outlands good and bad  
That they had journeyed through, but still  
He heard none speak for good or ill <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>  
Of any way unto the place  
Whereto for him still led all ways.  
But his hope lived, nor might his heart  
In any life of man have part,  
And forth he wandered once again  
As merchant among chaffering men,  
And strange he seemed among them all;  
His face changed not, whate’er might fall  
Of good or ill; he won, he lost,  
He gave, as counting not the cost;  
Fell sick, grew well, and heeded nought  
What the days took or what they brought;  
Nowhere he strove great deeds to do,  
Scarce spoke he save when spoken to;  
Hither and thither still he went  
As the winds blow, never content,  
Never complaining; resting nought,  
And yet scarce asking what he sought.  
A strange waif in the tide of life,  
With nought he seemed to be at strife,  
To nothing earthly to belong.  
Still burned his longing bright and strong,  
As when upon that bitter morn  
He hung with his white face forlorn,  
Over the bed yet scarcely cold,  
That erst her loveliness did hold.

   So chasing dreams, so dreamlike chased,  
Through lapse of years his life did waste; <span id="page_128">p.
128</span>  
His body changed, and old he grew  
Before his time: his face none knew,  
When, on a time, from journeyings vain  
In southlands, wandering back again,  
He heard his father welcome call  
Across the smoke-wreaths of his hall.  
O lonely heart! the yearning shame  
That erst, when back thereto he came,  
He felt at being so all alone  
Among his own folk, was clean gone;  
No lingering kindness of old days  
Clung now to the familiar place;  
With unmoved mouth he wandered there,  
And saw his mother's empty chair,  
For she was dead: with unchanged eyes  
Thorgerd he saw from spinning rise,  
Fair still and young, though he was old.  
His father's face he did behold  
With no faint smile of memory,  
No pang for wasted youth gone by;  
Betwixt his brethren twain he sat,  
And heard them talk of this and that  
Mid stories of a bygone day,  
Scarce thinking how they used to play  
Fair children once, and innocent,  
With the next minute well content.

   No goodwill from his kith and kin,  
And things kind once, he now might win <span id="page_129">p.
129</span>  
From out the well-loved wasting fire  
Of unfulfilled scarce-touched desire.  
One place was as another place,  
Haunted by memories of one face,  
Vocal with one remembered voice,  
Sad with one time's swift fleeting joys.  
Yet as he passed the time-worn door  
The last time, said farewell once more,  
Scarce mid his outward calm could he  
Stay quivering lip and trembling knee,  
That on the threshold longed to lie,  
Where surely had her feet gone by.

   Through what wild lands he wandered wide,  
Among what folk he did abide  
Thereafter, nought my story saith.  
Suffice it, that no outbraved death  
Might end him; no chain of delay  
His feet from his wild wanderings stay;  
That every help he strove to gain  
From wise or fools was still but vain;  
Until, my story saith, at last  
The second time in ship he passed  
The wild waves of the Indian Sea,  
And with a chaffering company  
Long time abode, and ever heard  
And saw great marvels, but no word,  
No sight of what alone might give  
A heart unto the dead-alive. <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>  
At last from the strange city there  
He set sail in a dromond fair,  
With chapmen for his fellows, bound  
To such a land, that there the ground  
Bears gems and gold, but nourisheth  
Little besides save fear and death.  
So long they sailed, that at the last  
The skipper's face grew overcast,  
And the stout chapmen ’gan to fear,  
Because no signs of land drew near,  
And all the days were fully done  
When with fair wind they should have won  
Unto the shore for which they made;  
But of no death was John afraid  
While o’er some space as yet untried  
He bore his love unsatisfied;  
With hate they eyed his calm face now,  
For greater still their fear did grow.

   Anigh the prow one eve he stood,  
And something new so stirred his blood  
With hope, that he at last might say,  
A thing unsaid for many a day,  
That he was happy; round about  
The shipmen stood, and gazed in doubt  
' Upon a long grey bank of cloud  
The eastern sky-line that did shroud.  
He saw it not, grown soft with rest  
His face was turned unto the west; <span id="page_131">p. 131</span>  
The low sun lit his golden hair  
Changed now with years of toil and care,  
The light wind stirred it as the prow  
The babbling ripple soft did throw  
From its black shining side; the sail  
Flapped o’erhead as the wind did fail  
Fitful that eve; the western sky  
Was bright and clear as night drew nigh  
Beyond all words to tell; at last  
He shivered; to the tall white mast  
He raised his eyes just as the sun  
Blazed at his lowest: day was done,  
But yet night lingered, as o’erhead,  
With a new-kindled hope and dread,  
The thin-curved moon, all white and cold,  
’Twixt day and night did he behold.

   No need now of that word to think,  
Or where he heard it; he did shrink  
Back mid his fellows, for he strove  
This first time to forget his love  
Lest hope should slay him; therewith now  
He heard the shipmen speaking low  
With anxious puckered brows, and saw  
The merchants each to other draw  
As men who feared to be alone;  
And knew that a fresh fear had grown  
Beside their old fear, nathless nought  
To such things might he turn his thought. <span id="page_132">p.
132</span>  
All watched that night but he, who slept  
While lovesome visions o’er him crept,  
Making night happy with the sight  
Of kind hands, and soft eyes and bright.  
At last within a flowery mead  
He seemed to be, clad in such weed  
As fellows of the angels wear:  
Alone a while he wandered there  
Right glad at heart, until at last  
By a fair-blossomed brake he passed,  
And o’er his shoulder gazed as he  
Went by it; and lo, suddenly,  
The odorous boughs were thrust apart,  
And with all heaven within his heart  
He turned, and saw his love, his sweet,  
Clad in green raiment to the feet,  
Her feet upon the blossoms bare,  
A rose-wreath round her golden hair;  
Her arms reached out to him, her mouth  
Trembling to quench his life-long drouth,  
Yet smiling ’neath her deep kind eyes  
Upon his trembling glad surprise.  
But when he would have gone to her  
Him seemed a cry of deadly fear  
Rang through the fair and lonely close,  
A cold thick mist betwixt them rose,  
And then all sight from him did pass,  
And darkness a long while there was. <span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

   Then all at once he woke up, cast  
With mighty force against the mast,  
Whereto with desperate hands he clung  
Unwitting, while the storm-wind sung  
Its song of death about his ears.  
But he, though grief had long slain fears,  
Shouted midst clash of wind and sea,  
Unheard shrieks, unseen misery  
Of the black night:  
                    "All come to nought!  
Yestreen I deemed that rest was brought  
Anigh me, and I thought I knew  
That toward my Love at last I drew.  
The loveless rest comes, all deceit  
Death treads to nothing with his feet!  
O idle Maker of the world,  
Art thou content to see me hurled  
To nought, from longing and from tears,  
When thou through all these weary years  
With love my helpless soul hast bound,  
And fed me in that narrow round  
With no delight thy fair world knows?  
Come close, my love, come close, come close,  
Why wilt thou let me die alone?"

   Howso he deemed his days were done,  
Yet there still clung he desperately,  
Mid wash of the in-rushing sea,  
Mid the storm's night, for no least whit <span id="page_134">p.
134</span>  
Might he see through the rage of it,  
Nor know which unseen hill of wave  
The rash frail wooden toy would stave,  
Or if another man did cling  
Unto the hopeless shivering thing;  
Yea, or if day had dawned, and light  
High up serene now mocked the night  
Of waves and winds. How long he drave  
From windless trough to wind-sheared wave,  
No whit he knew, although it seemed  
So long, that all before was dreamed,  
That there was neither heaven nor earth  
Before that turmoil had its birth.

   And yet at last, as on and on  
He swept, and still death was not won;  
A pleasure in his heart ’gan rise;  
Love blossomed fresh mid fantasies,  
Mid dreams born of the overthrow  
Of sense and sight; he did not know  
If yet he lived, yet wrong and pain  
Were words, that hindered not the gain,  
Of sweet peace, whatso wild unrest  
Were round about; and all the best  
Seemed won, nor was one day of bliss  
Forgotten; all was once more his,  
That while agone he deemed so lost.  
How long in sooth the ship was tost  
From hill to hill of unseen sea <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>  
The tale tells not; but suddenly,  
Amid the sweetest dream of all,  
A long way down John seemed to fall,  
Losing all sense of sight and sound;  
Then brake a sudden light around,  
Wherethrough he none the less saw nought,  
And as it waned, waned sense and thought,  
The peace of dull unconsciousness  
His wild torn heart at last did bless.

   He woke again upon the sand  
Of a wide bay's curved shell-strewn strand,  
And long belike had he lain there;  
For morn it was, and fresh and fair,  
And no least sign was on the sea  
Of storm or wrack, but peacefully  
On the low strand its last wave broke.

   Scarce might John dream when thus he woke  
Of what had happed or where he was;  
Soft thoughts of bygone days did pass  
Across his mind at first, and when  
His later memory came again,  
It was but with great toil that he  
Could think about his misery  
And all his latter wretched years;  
And if the thought to unused tears  
Did move him now, yet none the less  
A strange content and happiness  
Wrapped him around. <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>  
                       So to his feet  
He rose now, and most fresh and sweet  
The air was round him, and the sun  
As of the time when morn begun  
In early summer of the north,  
Maketh the world seem wondrous worth,  
And death and pain awhile doth hide.  
He gazed across the ocean wide  
With puzzled look; then up and down  
Sought curiously the sea-sand brown  
And at the last ’gan marvel how  
No sign the smooth sea-strand might show  
Of his lost ship and company;  
Then closer to that summer sea  
He went, and surely now it seemed  
That he of India had but dreamed,  
Because the sand beneath his feet  
Washed smooth and flat by the sea's beat,  
Or wrinkled by the ripple low,  
Such shells and creeping things did show  
As in the northland well he knew,  
And round about o’erhead there flew  
Such sea-fowl as in days of old;  
Their unknown tales unto him told.  
He gave a deep sigh, yet his heart  
From that new bliss would nowise part,  
Or battle with its strange content;  
And no more midst his wonderment,  
Rather for more of pain, he yearned, <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>  
Than any rest save one: he turned  
From the green sea his dreamy eyes,  
And saw soft slopes and lowly, rise  
Green and unburnt from the smooth strand,  
And further in, the rising land,  
Besprent with trees of no such clime  
As he had known for weary time;  
From slope and thicket then there grew  
High grassy, treeless hillsides, blue  
With the light haze of that fair tide.

   A little while did he abide  
Gazing upon that pleasant place,  
Then o’er his shoulder turned his face  
Seaward, yet once more ’gan to go  
Unto the hills, and felt as though  
He bade unto the weltering flood  
A last farewell; and sweet and good  
His life seemed grown, e’en when he said,  
"It may be that my love is dead;  
Or living, still more like that I  
Shall see her not before I die;  
Fool am I then to feel my feet  
Drawn on some happiness to meet!"

   So went his words, but e’en as erst  
When most he felt forlorn and cursed,  
The words of hope seemed words and air,  
So now seemed all his words of care <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>  
Empty of meaning. Forth he went  
Light-hearted, till his firm feet bent  
The daisies of the flowery grass,  
And swiftly onward did he pass  
From slope to slope: the land was fair,  
Yet saw he no house anywhere,  
No hedge or garden-close or corn;  
Nor heard he halloo there or horn,  
To make the dappled deer afraid,  
That here and there about him strayed  
Scarce heeding him: no arms he bare,  
His raiment that had once been fair,  
Was sorely stained, and worn, and rent,  
And thirst and hunger as he went  
Pressed on him; till he came at last  
To where a spreading fruit-tree cast  
Its shadows round deliciously;  
John stayed there, for that friendly tree  
Had load of apples; so he ate  
And found them sweet and delicate,  
As ever monk in garden grew,  
Though little care belike they knew.  
But now, when he had had his fill  
Thereof, there marvelling stood he still,  
Because to one bough blossoms clung  
As it were May, but ripe fruit hung  
Upon the other: then he smiled,  
As one by a strange dream beguiled,  
Then slowly on the grass sank down, <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>  
For sorely sweet had longing grown  
With gathering languor of the day.  
But looking round, as there he lay,  
Upon the flowers besprent about,  
Still more was love confused with doubt  
If still he lived:  
                   "Red roses fair  
To wreathe my love that wanders here,  
Gold-hearted lilies for her hand!  
And yet withal that she may stand  
On something other folk think sweet,  
March violets for her rosy feet;  
The black-heart amorous poppy, fain  
Death from her passing knee to gain,  
Bows to the gilliflower there:  
The fiery tulip stands to stare  
Upon her perfect loveliness,  
That ’gainst the corn-cockle will press  
Its fainting leaves: further afield  
The untended vine black fruit doth yield,  
That bore long torment of the heat,  
At last in bliss her lips to meet;—  
The wind-flowers wotting of the thing  
Must gather round there in the Spring,  
And live and die and live again,  
That they might feel the joyous pain  
At last, of lying crushed and rent  
Beneath her feet, while well content  
Above their soft leaves she doth sing. <span id="page_140">p.
140</span>  
What marvel, love, that everything  
That far apart the troubled year,  
Midst toil and doubt, gives otherwhere,  
Must gather in this land round thee,  
Living and dying, still to see  
A wonder God shall not make twice.  
Come swiftly, love, because mine eyes  
Grow dim with love; a little while  
Shall hope my fainting heart beguile  
To think me strong; yet well I know  
That nought of strength is in me now,  
Save wasting fire of love alone—  
Come to me then, ere all is gone!  
And let it not be all for nought  
That ever one heart have I sought  
Of all the world, and cast aside  
All thought that any bliss might hide  
In aught save in thy love; thy love  
That even yet perchance might move  
The Great God not all utterly  
To slay me, casting my soul by  
As void henceforth for evermore,  
What love soever once it bore,  
That nothing mortal satisfied!"

   He sprang up, o’er the countryside  
He gazed long, and down ran the tears,  
At thought of all the pain of years,  
When he beheld its emptiness; <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>  
Yet presently on did he press,  
With longing grown not all a pain.

   The higher slopes now did he gain,  
Through flowers and blooming trees, until  
He ’gan to breast a steeper hill,  
And coming out of a close wood,  
High up above the lowlands stood,  
And far away beheld the sea  
Guarding the sweet land patiently,  
Then turning, clomb on, till the sun  
Sank low adown and day was done,  
Before the hill's top he might gain;  
Then e’en his restlessness was fain  
There to abide the next day's light.  
So down he lay, aid the short night  
Went by in dreams of that past day  
When in the hawthorn-brake he lay;  
How many lifetimes now agone  
That day seemed, when once more alone  
In the dawn's shiver he awoke!  
Nathless with sturdy heart he broke  
Through the morn's hopelessness, and still  
Pressed up the last steep of the hill,  
Until together with the sun  
Its grey and rugged brow he won.

   Then down into the vale he gazed,  
And held his breath, as if amazed <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>  
By all its wondrous loveliness;  
For as the sun its depths did bless,  
It lighted up from side to side,  
A close-shut valley, nothing wide,  
But ever full of all things fair.  
A little way the hill was bare,  
Then clung to it a deep green wood  
That guarded many a fertile rood  
Of terraced vine and slopes of wheat;  
A white way wound about its feet,  
Beset with heavy-fruited trees  
And cleaving orchards through; midst these,  
Each hemmed round with its flowery close,  
The cottages and homesteads rose;  
But the hill-side sprang suddenly  
From level meadows that did lie  
On either side a noble stream,  
O’er which the morning haze did steam,  
Made golden now; then rose again  
The further hill-sides, bright with grain,  
And fair with orchard and close wood,  
From whence at last the scarped cliffs stood,  
And clear now, golden in the morn,  
Against the western sky upborne,  
Seemed like a guarded wall, lest care  
Or unrest yet should creep in there.

   At John's back now bright the sun shone  
Once more, once more with all light gone, <span id="page_143">p.
143</span>  
Above the further hills hung high,  
The pale thin moon was in the sky;  
Then he cried out:  
                     "Ah, end the strife  
Twin lights of God; give death or life!  
Surely shall I be lying soon  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon;*  
What matter if alive or dead,  
If so once more our lips are wed!"

   And now he ’gan to look around,  
To see how he the lower ground  
Might gain, for there the hill had end  
In shear rocks, so he needs must wend  
Along its rugged brow; at last,  
When he a little way had passed,  
The hill's crest lowered, and ’gan draw  
Back from the vale, and then he saw  
How it grew wide, and ’neath his eyes  
The river wound now circle-wise,  
And at the furthest curve thereof  
There lay, half hid by close and grove,  
A marvellous house, that jewel-like  
Gleamed, where the sun its roofs did strike,  
Or strange-wrought walls; down-gazing now  
With fluttering heart, he wondered how  
Its white walls, and its roofs that burned,  
Should seem e’en like a dream returned  
From the forgotten land; then down <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>  
The hill-side, soft and easy grown,  
He slipped, and when he reached the way  
Folk stirred about the morn of day  
In field and house: fair folk were all  
He saw, and yet a chill did fall  
Upon him when he noted them;  
White linen, well-embroidered hem,  
Round clean-made limbs he saw, above  
Were faces sweet, well wrought for love;  
Yet man and maid, young folk and old,  
With sad eyes, lonely, strange, and cold,  
Still seemed to go upon their ways.  
Moreover, none on him did gaze;  
And if their eyes met his, as though  
They saw him not, past did they go;  
Nor heard he any spoken word  
Amongst them, nor saw any stirred  
To laugh or smile by anything.  
But fearful, yet his hope did cling  
Unto his heart, nay more, he thought  
Once more that surely not for nought  
Among such marvels he was come.

   So forth he passed by house and home  
E’en like a ghost; the open door  
Of one fair house he stood before,  
Where folk got ready for their meal,  
With little sign of woe or weal;  
And as he stood before their eyes, <span id="page_145">p. 145</span>  
They looked his way with no surprise,  
Nor seemed to see him: nought they spake,  
Neither durst he the silence break,  
But went his ways.  
                    A tall man stood  
By the wayside a-hewing wood,  
And close by was a fair-haired child,  
Who watched him, but spake not nor smiled,  
Nor looked up at the wayfarer;  
John strove to make this goodman hear,  
Crying out to him cheerily  
What land of all lands this might be;  
But nowise did he turn him round,  
Nor did the youngling heed the sound.  
Next, as he turned therefrom, there came  
Along the road an ancient dame,  
High-perched upon a mule, a lad  
Of fifteen springs his left hand had  
Upon the bell-hung bridle-rein—  
—And still with these were all words vain.  
So on he went, and no more speech  
Had heart to try till he did reach  
The delicate house; and in the square  
Before it was a conduit fair,  
Where to and fro the girls did pass,  
Bearing their jars of earth or brass;  
Shrill sounded there the grey doves’ wings,  
The steep roof knew their murmurings,  
The sparrows chirped, the brass did clash, <span id="page_146">p.
146</span>  
The water on the stones did plash,  
The damsels’ wind-blown raiment fair  
And tinkling gold toys sounded there,  
But not their voices: unto one  
Who stood and watched the water run  
Over her jar's lip pensively  
John turned, for kind she seemed to be:  
But when with soft beseeching eyes  
He spake, still in no other wise  
She dealt with him than had the rest;  
So when with growing fear oppressed  
He spake more earnestly, and she  
Still answered nought, then timidly  
Upon her hand his hand he laid;  
Warm was it, but no heed she paid  
Unto the touch, and he fell back,  
Wondering what thing those folk did lack  
That yet they died not: but still burned  
Hope amid great fear, and he turned  
Unto the palace door, wherethrough  
Passed fair-clad people to and fro.

   When he essayed to enter in  
None stayed or heeded; he did win  
Into a fair porch, set around  
With images of maidens crowned  
And kings all-armed; through this he gained  
A pillared court, where waxed and waned  
A babbling fountain, maidens fair <span id="page_147">p. 147</span>  
And slim youths saw he loitering there  
As lovers loiter; but their eyes,  
Listless and sad, changed in nowise  
As past he brushed with hurrying feet  
And glittering eyes: then did he meet  
The all-armed clashing guard, and then  
The long line of the serving-men  
Bearing up victuals to the hall,  
And, without bell or trumpet-call,  
Thither folk streamed. He went with them,  
And many a wrought cloak and rich hem  
Brushed past him, many a jewelled sword  
Clinked at the side of knight or lord,  
And no word spoken yet—at last  
Into the mighty hall he passed,  
And thought no greatest king on earth,  
E’en were it he of Micklegarth,  
Or the great lord of Babylon,  
So fair a place as that had won.

   Now there he stood, till every place  
Was filled, save midmost of the dais  
The high-seat lacked a man; so then  
He laughed loud mid those silent men,  
Grown reckless in that kingdom cold,  
And clad in rags mid silk and gold,  
Barefooted in that dainty hall,  
He strode up to the ivory stall,  
And sat him down, and laughed once more <span id="page_148">p.
148</span>  
Unheeded, while the servers bore  
Unto the guests rich meats and drink;  
Nor from the victuals did he shrink,  
But well his hunger satisfied  
Though not long there might he abide,  
For still his lovesome restlessness  
Midst all upon his heart did press.

   So rising ere the feast was done,  
He paced the echoing hall alone,  
And passed the door, and wandered now,  
Unchecked by any, high and low,  
And saw strange things and fair; at last  
A silent maid his side brushed past,  
And to a carven door did wend,  
At a long cloister's nether end,  
Passed in and shut it to again.  
Then John stood still and strove in vain,  
With a new hope and gathering fear,  
And weakly drew the door anear,  
And laid his hand upon the latch,  
And with a sob his breath must catch  
Because of thronging memories.  
He opened the door now, with eyes  
Cast down for fear, and therewith heard,  
As heretofore, no spoken word;  
But rustling as of women's gear  
And gentle breathing did he hear  
And the dull noise upon the ground <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>  
Of restless spindles; all around  
Floated a delicate sweet scent,  
As though the wind o’er blossoms went.

   His breath came fast, his fevered blood  
Tingled and changed, as there he stood,  
And each ’gainst each now smote his knees;  
E’en as a world of images  
The past was grown to him; he knew  
What in those days he used to do,  
But knew not what it meant; and yet  
Would she the past days quite forget,  
And was she like these dead-alive?

   None came, sore trembling did he strive  
To search the strange place through, but still  
His hope, fear-tangled, and the ill  
That might be, bound his eyes full fast  
A long while—crying out at last  
E’en ere his eyes had left the ground,  
As one who some lost thing has found,  
He stepped forth, and with all surprise  
Made nought by love, his mortal eyes,  
His weary eyes, beheld indeed,  
His heart's desire, his life, his need,  
Still on the earth, still there for him;  
And as he gazed, most weak and dim,  
Seemed all the visions wherewith he  
Was wont to feed his misery, <span id="page_150">p. 150</span>  
To dull the pain unsatisfied,  
That still for death or presence cried.

   Round the World's Love, the glorious one,  
My tale says, many maidens spun,  
Howso John's eyes beheld them not,  
And she upon her knees had got  
Some broidery fair, and whiles her hand  
Moved by her half-dead will's command  
Would raise it up, and whiles again,  
As too much all in all grew pain,  
Would let it fall adown: her face  
Was altered nothing from the grace  
That he remembered, save that erst  
A sad smile even at the worst  
Would gleam across her pity, but now  
Betwixt her round chin and smooth brow  
Lay bound the sorrow of the years,  
Too sharp for smiles, too hard for tears:  
Sometimes as some sweet memory  
Pierced the dull present, wearily  
She writhed her neck, and raised her head;  
Sometimes her hands, as feebly led  
By ghosts of her old longings, moved  
As though toward some one long time loved,  
And long time lost; then from her seat  
Whiles she half rose as if to meet  
Loved footfalls half-remembered; then  
The dull pain swallowed all again, <span id="page_151">p. 151</span>  
Its child, dull patience, death-in-life,  
Choked down the rising rest of strife.

   Scarcely his feet might bear him o’er  
The smoothness of the marble floor  
Unto her feet; scarce might he raise  
His wild eyes to her weary face,  
Scarcely his hand had strength to touch  
The open hand he loved so much;  
And yet his thirsting lips love drew  
Unto dear eyes that nothing knew  
What closed their lids, to lips still warm,  
But all forgetful of the harm  
Their fruitful sweetness erst had wrought,  
To feet desired, that erewhile brought  
Love's grief on the sad moaning man,  
Who fawned on them with lips grown wan,  
And cheeks grown thin for lack of love.

   How might he tell if aught could move  
Her grief-chilled heart; yet love slew fear,  
Lulled speech to sleep—sweet to be near;  
Yea, even if all were changed, if all  
Into this dumb, strange life must fall,  
And all the longing and the pain  
For signs of love were spent in vain;  
If, in strange wise together brought,  
They were apart still, and still nought  
Might tell of better hope! O sweet <span id="page_152">p. 152</span>  
Beyond all words, there at her feet  
To lie and watch her! By what word  
Might his deep love be better heard  
Than by that silence.  
                      Nought he said  
A long while, and her weary head  
Hung low, and still she saw him not.  
At last the heart in him waxed hot,  
And he cried out:  
                     "Time long ago,  
How long, how long, I know not now,  
I sinned and lost thee: scarce a hope  
Was left with the dull years to cope;  
Yet this my hand now touches thee,  
My cheek is laid upon thy knee;  
I am thy love, beloved, come,  
I know not how, to thy new home!"

   She moved not, but a rush of tears  
Blinded his eyes, as all the years  
With all their pain rose up to him;  
Her head moved then, through foot and limb  
A tremor ran, as the tears fell.  
Upon her hands:  
                 "O Love, scarce well,"  
He sobbed, "that we should be apart,  
My sorrow laid upon thy heart,  
And my heart worn with thine, my love—  
No word ’twixt lips and lips, to move <span id="page_153">p.
153</span>  
The double burden—found at last,  
What chain is it that binds thee fast?  
Was my great grief so hard to bear  
That thou art grown cold? Sweet and dear  
I bore thy grief yet love and live!"

   He trembled, for she seemed to strive  
To grasp strange thoughts that flitted round,  
She clenched her delicate hands, and frowned,  
And her feet moved uncertainly,  
The while the maidens sitting by  
Spun and spun on, nor changed at all.

   Then a strange thought on him did fall,  
To choke his tears back and tell o’er  
The story of his longing sore,  
E’en from that well-remembered day  
When in the hawthorn-brake he lay.  
God wot, if his hand trembled oft  
As he recalled words sweet and soft,  
And tender touches, all the bliss  
Of clinging hand and lingering kiss!  
God wot if he stayed tremblingly  
As from her breast brake forth a sigh  
And she fell trembling! And at last,  
Amid his tale of how she passed  
Away from him, and left him bare  
In the rough world of hate and care,  
Her fingers tightened round his own, <span id="page_154">p. 154</span>  
And a sound like a tender moan  
Parted her lips; he stayed awhile,  
And on his face a quivering smile  
Masked the unshed tears, as he told  
How in that morning drear and cold  
He found her gone: and therewith she  
Raised up her head, and eagerly  
Gazed round, and yet looked not on him:

   "No hope," he said, "however dim,  
At first, sweet love, abode with me;  
I know not how I lived; the sea,  
The earth, and sky, that day had grown  
A heavy burden all mine own;  
As if mine hand all things had wrought  
To find their strength come all to nought,  
Their beauty perished, all made vain,  
Unnoticed parts of the huge pain  
That filled the world and crushed my heart.  
Then first, the heavy veil to part,  
Came memory of thy mouth divine,  
Some image of a word of thine—  
—Is it not so that thou saidst this,  
That morn that parted me and bliss,  
'Ah, couldst thou know, I go too soon  
*East of the Sun, West of the Moon?*'"

   With a great sigh, as one who throws  
A burden off, that sweet arose, <span id="page_155">p. 155</span>  
And stood before him, trembling sore  
With love and joy; ah, me! once more  
Fulfilled of love their kind eyes met,  
Although apart they stood as yet,  
Helpless with pain of ecstasy;  
Till from her lips a joyful cry,  
Ringing and sweet, burst forth, and he,  
Strong no more with love's misery,  
Faint, changed with this new joyful love,  
His wandering hands toward her did move  
E’en but a little way. But round  
His fluttering heart her arms she wound,  
And kissed his pale cheeks red again,  
And hung above his lovesome pain,  
Desiring him as the spring yearns  
For the young summer sun, that burns  
His soft heart into fruitful death.  
His parched mouth felt her odorous breath,  
His weary burning head did rest  
Upon the heaven of her sweet breast,  
His mazed ears heard her tender speech;  
His eyes, his silence did beseech  
For more and more and more of love.

   How this their joy fulfilled might move  
The world around I know not well;  
But yet this idle dream doth tell  
That no more silent was the place,  
That new joy lit up every face, <span id="page_156">p. 156</span>  
That joyous lovers kissed and clung,  
E’en as these twain, that songs were sung  
From mouth to mouth in rose-bowers,  
Where, hand in hand and crowned with flowers,  
Folk praised the Lover and Beloved  
That such long years, such pain had proved.  
But soft, they say, their joyance was  
When midst them soon the twain did pass,  
Hand locked in hand, heart kissing heart,  
No more this side of death to part—  
—No more, no more—Full soft I say  
Their greetings were that happy day,  
As though in pensive semblance clad;  
For fear their faces over-glad  
This certain thing should seem to hide,  
That love can ne’er be satisfied.

 

*O’ER Gregory's eyes the pain of morn  
Flashed suddenly, and all forlorn  
Of late-gained clean forgot delight,  
He sat up, scowling on the bright  
Broad day that lit the hurrying crowd  
Of white-head waves, while shrill and loud  
About him cried the gulls; but he  
Lay still with eyes turned toward the sea,  
And yet beholding nought at all*, <span id="page_157">p. 157</span>  
*Till into ill thoughts did he fall,  
Of what a rude and friendless place  
The world was, through what empty days  
Men were pushed slowly down to death.  
   Then o’er the fresh morn's breezy breath  
Was borne his fellows’ cheery cry;  
He rose up, sighing heavily,  
And turned round to the steep grey bent,  
Whereunder had been pitched their tent  
Upon the odorous thymy grass.  
And down the slope he saw them pass,  
And heard their voices blithe enough:  
But loathsome unto him, and rough  
Must all men seem urn that morn,  
Their speech a hard thing to be borne*.

*   He stood by as they launched the boat,  
And little did their labour note.  
And set no hand thereto at all;  
Until an awe on these did fall;  
They muttered, "Ah, the Stargazer  
Beholdeth strange things drawing near!"  
   So somewhat silently they sailed  
In up the firth, till the wind failed,  
Betwixt the high cliffs, and with oars  
They swept midmost the rocky shores  
And spake few words.  
                        But smoother now  
Was grown the worn Stargazer's brow*, <span id="page_158">p.
158</span>  
*And his thin lips were less close-set,  
For well-nigh now did he forget  
Fellows and boat and land and sea,  
And, waking, seemed no less to be*  
East of the Sun, West of the Moon,  
*And when they landed at high-noon,  
From all men would he go apart  
In woods and meads, and deal by art  
With his returning memory;  
And, some things gained, and some slipped by,  
His weary heart a while to soothe,  
He wove all into verses smooth,  
As tells the tale: that wotteth not  
Hoer much within it it hath got  
That his hand writ: for soothly he  
Was deemed a craftsmaster to be  
In those most noble days of old,  
Whose words were e’en as kingly gold  
To our thin brass, or drossy lead:  
—Well, e’en so all the tale is said  
How twain grew one and came to bliss—  
Woe's me an idle dream it is!* 

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

 

THE autumn day, the strange and dreamy tale  
Were soft as far-off bells adown a vale,  
Borne to the hill-top on the fitful wind;  
And like their music past, they left behind  
Sad thoughts of old desires unsatisfied,  
And pain and joy that long ago had died,  
Yea, long been buried ’neath the strife of days,  
Too hard and hapless any woe to raise  
And crown it with the flowery, fleeting crown  
Of that strange rest, whose seed is all unknown,  
That withereth while reproachfully we say;  
"Why grow’st thou unsought ’neath my hand to-day,  
Whose longed-for scent through many an ill day sought,  
Swift healing to my sickening soul had brought  
And kept me young. Fair rest, what dost thou here?"

   The wind dealt with the autumn haze, and clear  
The afternoon was, though the great clouds drew  
In piled-up hills across the faint-streaked blue,  
And ’gainst them showed the wind-hover's dark spot,  
Nor yet midst trembling peace was change forgot.
