*The Slaying of Kiartan Olafson*.

NOW Kiartan rode from Knoll betimes that day,  
And goodman Thorkel brought him on the way  
With twelve men more, and therewithal they ride  
Fast from the west, but where the pass grew wide  
And opened into Swinedale, Kiartan stayed  
His company, and unto Thorkel said,  
"Thanks have thou, goodman, for thy following;  
Now get thee back, I fear not anything  
’Twixt this and Herdholt."  
                            "Well," the goodman said,  
"Time enow is there yet to be waylaid  
Ere thou art safe at home; let us ride on."  
"Nay," Kiartan said, "the thing shall not be done,  
All men of heart will say that heart I lack,  
If I must have an army at my back  
Where’er I go, for fear of Oswif's sons.  
Fare thee well, goodman, get thee back at once!  
And therewithal take this to comfort thee,  
That Bodli yet is scarce mine enemy,  
And holds aback those brethren; wot ye well,  
Too strange a story would it be to tell,  
If these should overcome my father's son,  
Besides, without thee I ride not alone." <span id="page_496">p.
496</span>

   So back the goodman turned, misdoubting though,  
In spite of all how yet the day would go,  
And up the dale rode Kiartan: An the Black,  
The man who erst the stolen sword brought back,  
Was with him these, and one named Thorarin,  
As slowly now the midway dale they win.

   Now, as I find it written in my tale,  
There went that morn a goodman of the dale,  
About those bents his mares and foals to see,  
His herdsman with him; these saw presently  
Up from the east the men of Bathstead ride,  
And take their stand along a streamlet's side  
Deep sunken in a hollow, where the mouth  
Of the strait pass turns somewhat to the south,  
From out the dale; now, since the men they knew,  
Much they misdoubted what these came to do;  
But when they turned them from the sunken stream,  
And saw the sun on other weapons gleam,  
And three men armed come riding from the west;  
And when they knew the tallest and the best  
For Kiartan Olafson, therewith no more  
They doubted aught.  
                       Then said the herdsman: "Sore  
The troubles are that on the country-side  
Shall fall, if this same meeting shall betide;  
He is a great chief; let us warn him then!"

   "Yea, yea!" his master said, "and all such men <span id="page_497">p.
497</span>  
As fate leads unto death, that we may be  
’Twixt the two millstones ground right merrily,  
And cursed as we cry out! thou art a fool,  
Who needs must be the beaker and the stool  
For great men's use; emptied of joys of life  
For other's joy, then kicked by in the strife  
When they are drunken; come, beside the way,  
Let us lie close to see the merry play!  
For such a swordsman as is Kiartan, we  
Shall scarce behold on this side of the sea;  
And heavy odds he hath against him too.  
These are great men—good, let them hack and hew  
Their noble bodies for our poor delight!"

   So down the bent they slipped, and as they might  
Lurked by the road, and thus they tell their tale:

   Ere Kiartan reached the strait place of the dale,  
High up upon the brook-bank Bodli lay,  
So that his helm was just seen from the way;  
Then Ospak went to him, and clear they heard  
Across the road his rough and threatening word:  
"What dost thou here? thou hast bethought thee then  
To warn thy friend that here lurk all-armed men.  
Thou knowest Gudrun's mind—or knowst it not,  
But knowst that we within a trap have got  
Thee and the cursed wretch, the proud Mire-blade,  
The Thief, the King's-pimp, the white Herdholt maid. <span
id="page_498">p. 498</span>  
Come, sister's husband, get thee lower down!"

   The foam flew from the lips of the fierce clown  
As thus he spake, but Bodli rose and said:  
"Thinkst thou I armed because I was afraid  
Of thee and thine this morn? If thou knewst well  
Of love or honour, somewhat might I tell  
Why I am here with thee—If will I have,  
Kiartan, who was my friend, this day to save,  
Bethink thee I might do it otherwise  
Than e’en by showing what in ambush lies!  
—How if I stood beside him?".  
                                       "Down with thee  
And hold thy peace! or he will hear and see."

   For so it was that Kiartan drew so near  
That now the herd their clinking bits might hear,  
Borne down upon the light wind: on he came,  
Singing an old song made in Odin's fame,  
Merry and careless on that sunny morn;  
When suddenly out rang the Bathstead horn,  
And sharply he drew rein, and looked around;  
Then did the lurkers from the gully bound  
And made on toward them, and down leapt all three,  
And Kiartan glanced around, and speedily  
Led toward a rock that was beside the way,  
And there they shifted them to stand at bay.

   Most noble then looked Kiartan, said the herd, <span id="page_499">p.
499</span>  
Nor ever saw I any less afeard;  
Yet, when his watchful eye on Bodli fell,  
A change came o’er him, that were hard to tell,  
But that he dropped his hands at first, as one  
Who thinks that all is over now and done;  
Yet, says the neatherd, soon his brows did clear,  
And from his strong hand whistled forth his spear,  
And down fell Thorolf clattering on the road.  
He cried, 'Down goes the thief beneath his load,  
One man struck off the tale! I have heard tell  
Of such as dealt with more and came off well.'

   Silence a space but for the mail rings; then  
Over the dusty road on rushed those men;  
And, says the herd, there saw I for a space  
Confused gleam of swords about that place,  
And from their clatter now and then did come  
Sharp cry, or groan, or panting shout, as home  
Went point or edge: but pale as death one stood,  
With sheathed sword, looking on the clashing wood,  
And that was Bodli Thorleikson. Then came  
A lull a little space in that wild game.  
The Bathstead men drew off, and still the three  
Stood there scarce hurt as far as I could see;  
But of the Bathstead men I deem some bled,  
Though all stood firm; then Ospak cried and said;

   "O Bodli, what thing wilt thou prophesy  
For us, since like a seer thou standest by <span id="page_500">p.
500</span>  
And see’st thine house beat back? well then for thee  
Will I be wise, foretelling what shall be  
A cold bed, and a shamed board, shalt thou have,  
Yea, and ere many days a chased dog's grave,  
If thou bringst home to-day a bloodless sword!"

   But yet for all that answered he no word,  
But stood as made of iron, though the breeze  
Blew his long black hair round his cheek-pieces  
And fanned his scarlet kirtle.  
                               "Time we lose,"  
Another cried, "if Bodli so shall choose,  
Let him deal with us when this man is slain."  
Then stoutly to the game they gat again  
And played awhile, and now withal I saw  
That rather did the sons of Oswif draw  
Toward Thorarin and An, until the first,  
From midst the knot of those onsetters burst,  
And ran off west, followed by two stout men,  
Not Oswif's sons; and An the Black fell then  
Wounded to death, I deemed, but over him  
Fell Gudlaug, Oswif's nephew, with a limb  
Shorn off by Kiartan's sword: then once again  
There came a short lull in the iron rain;  
And then the four fell on him furiously  
Awhile, then gave aback, and I could see  
The noble Kiartan, with his mail-coat rent,  
His shield hung low adown, his sword-blade bent,  
Panting for breath, but still without a wound. <span id="page_501">p.
501</span>

   While as a man by some strong spell fast bound,  
Without a will for aught, did Bodli stand,  
Nor once cast eyes on the waylayers’ band,  
Nor once glanced round at Kiartan, but stared still  
Upon the green side of the grassy hill  
Over against him, e’en as he did deem  
It yet might yawn as in a dreadful dream,  
And from its bowels give some marvel birth,  
That in a ghostly wise should change the earth,  
And make that day nought. But as there he stood  
Ospak raised up his hand, all red with blood,  
And smote him on the face, and cried;  
                                       "Go home,  
Half-hearted traitor, e’en as thou hast come,  
And bear my blood to Gudrun!"  
                                     Still no word  
Came from his pale lips, and the rover's sword  
Abode within the scabbard. Ospak said,  
"O lover, art thou grown too full of dread  
To look him in the face whom thou fearedst not  
To cozen of the fair thing he had got?  
O faint-heart thief of love, why drawest thou back,  
When all the love thou erst so sore didst lack  
With one stroke thou mayst win?"  
                                  He did not hear,  
Or seemed to hear not; but now loud and clear  
Kiartan cried out his name from that high place,  
And at the first sound Bodli turned his face  
This way and that, in puzzled hapless wise, <span id="page_502">p.
502</span>  
Till ’twixt the spears his eyes met Kiartan's eyes;  
Then his mouth quivered, and he writhed aside,  
And with his mail-clad hands his face did hide,  
And trembled like one palsy-struck, while high  
Over the doubtful field did Kiartan cry:

   "Yea, they are right! be not so hardly moved,  
O kinsman, foster-brother, friend beloved  
Of the old days, friend well forgiven now!  
Come nigher, come, that thou my face mayst know,  
Then draw thy sword and thrust from off the earth  
The fool that so hath spoilt thy days of mirth,  
Win long lone days of love by Gudrun's side!  
My life is spoilt, why longer do I bide  
To vex thee, friend—strike then for happy life!  
I said thou mightst not gaze upon the strife  
Far off; bethink thee then, who sits at home  
And waits thee, Gudrun, my own love, and come,  
Come, for the midday sun is over bright,  
And I am wearying for the restful night!"

   And now had Bodli dropped his hands adown,  
And shown his face all drawn into a frown  
Of doubt and shame; his hand was on his sword,  
Even ere Kiartan spake that latest word;  
Still trembling, now he drew it from its sheath,  
And the bright sun ran down the fated death,  
And e’en the sons of Oswif shuddered now,  
As with wild eyes and heavy steps and slow <span id="page_503">p.
503</span>  
He turned toward Kiartan; beat the heart in me  
Till I might scarce breathe, for I looked to see  
A dreadful game; the wind of that midday  
Beat ’gainst the hill-sides; a hound far away  
Barked by some homestead's door; the grey ewe's bleat  
Sounded nearby; but that dull sound of feet,  
And the thin tinkling of the mail-coat rings  
Drowned in my ears the sound of other things,  
As less and less the space betwixt them grew;  
I shut my eyes as one the end who knew,  
But straight, perforce, I opened them again  
Woe worth the while!  
                     As one who looks in vain  
For help, looked Kiartan round; then raised his shield,  
And poised his sword as though he ne’er would yield  
E’en when the earth was sinking; yet a while,  
And o’er his face there came a quivering smile,  
As into Bodli's dreadful face he gazed;  
Then my heart sank within me, as all dazed,  
I saw the flash of swords that never met,  
And heard how Kiartan cried;  
                                  "Ah, better yet  
For me to die than live on even so!  
Alas! friend, do the deed that thou must do!  
Oh, lonely death!—farewell, farewell, farewell!"

   And clattering on the road his weapons fell, <span id="page_504">p.
504</span>  
And almost ere they touched the bloody dust,  
Into his shieldless side the sword was thrust,  
And I, who could not turn my eyes away,  
Beheld him fall, and shrieked as there I lay,  
And yet none noted me; but Bodli flung  
Himself upon the earth, and o’er him hung,  
Then raised his head, and laid it on his knee,  
And cried:  
            "Alas! what have I done to thee?  
Was it for this deed, then, that I was born?  
Was this the end I looked for on this morn?  
I said, To-day I die, to-day I die,  
And folk will say, an ill deed, certainly,  
He did, but living had small joy of it,  
And quickly from him did his weak life flit—  
Where was thy noble sword I looked to take  
Here in my breast, and die for Gudrun's sake,  
And for thy sake—O friend, am I forgot?  
Speak yet a word!"  
                   But Kiartan answered not,  
And Bodli said, "Wilt thou not then forgive?  
Think of the days I yet may have to live  
Of hard life!"  
               Therewith Kiartan oped his eyes,  
And strove to turn about as if to rise,  
And could not, but gazed hard on Bodli's face,  
And gasped out, as his eyes began to glaze:  
"Farewell, thou joyous life beneath the sun, <span id="page_505">p.
505</span>  
Thou foolish wasted gift—farewell, Gudrun!"  
And then on Bodli's breast back fell his head,  
He strove to take his hand, and he was dead.

   Then was there silence a long while, well-nigh  
We heard each other breathe, till quietly  
At last the slayer from the slain arose,  
And took his sword, and sheathed it, and to those  
Four sons of Oswif, e’en as one he spake  
Who had good right the rule o’er them to take:

   "Here have we laid to earth a mighty one,  
And therein no great deed, forsooth, have done,  
Since his great heart o’ercame him, not my sword;  
And what hereafter may be our reward  
For this, I know not: he that lieth here  
By many a man in life was held right dear,  
As well as by the man who was his friend,  
And brought his life and love to bitter end;  
And since I am the leader of this band  
Of man-slayers, do after my command.  
Go ye to Bathstead, name me everywhere  
The slayer of Kiartan Olafson, send here  
Folk who shall bear the body to our stead;  
And then let each man of you hide his head,  
For ye shall find it hard from this ill day  
To keep your lives: here, meanwhile will I stay,  
Nor think myself yet utterly alone." <span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

   Then home turned Oswif's sons, and they being gone,  
We slunk away, and looking from the hill  
We saw how Bodli Thorleikson stood still  
In that same place, nor yet had faced the slain.  
And so we gat unto our place again.

   So told the herd, time long agone, the tale  
Of that sad fight within the grey-sloped vale.
