# XX

HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings:--  
"Ask not of pleasure! Pain is renewed  
to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,  
of Yrmenlaf the elder brother,  
my sage adviser and stay in council,  
shoulder-comrade in stress of fight  
when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,  
hewed the helm-boars; hero famed  
should be every earl as Aeschere was!  
But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him  
of wandering death-sprite. I wot not whither,\[1\]  
proud of the prey, her path she took,  
fain of her fill. The feud she avenged  
that yesternight, unyieldingly,  
Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst, --  
seeing how long these liegemen mine  
he ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,  
in arms he fell. Now another comes,  
keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,  
faring far in feud of blood:  
so that many a thane shall think, who e'er  
sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings,  
this is hardest of heart-bales. The hand lies low  
that once was willing each wish to please.  
Land-dwellers here\[2\] and liegemen mine,  
who house by those parts, I have heard relate  
that such a pair they have sometimes seen,  
march-stalkers mighty the moorland haunting,  
wandering spirits: one of them seemed,  
so far as my folk could fairly judge,  
of womankind; and one, accursed,  
in man's guise trod the misery-track  
of exile, though huger than human bulk.  
Grendel in days long gone they named him,  
folk of the land; his father they knew not,  
nor any brood that was born to him  
of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;  
by wolf-cliffs haunt they and windy headlands,  
fenways fearful, where flows the stream  
from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,  
underground flood. Not far is it hence  
in measure of miles that the mere expands,  
and o'er it the frost-bound forest hanging,  
sturdily rooted, shadows the wave.  
By night is a wonder weird to see,  
fire on the waters. So wise lived none  
of the sons of men, to search those depths!  
Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,  
the horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,  
long distance driven, his dear life first  
on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge  
to hide his head: 'tis no happy place!  
Thence the welter of waters washes up  
wan to welkin when winds bestir  
evil storms, and air grows dusk,  
and the heavens weep. Now is help once more  
with thee alone! The land thou knowst not,  
place of fear, where thou findest out  
that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!  
I will reward thee, for waging this fight,  
with ancient treasure, as erst I did,  
with winding gold, if thou winnest back."  
\[1\] He surmises presently where she is.  
\[2\] The connection is not difficult. The words of mourning, of acute
grief, are said; and according to Germanic sequence of thought,
inexorable here, the next and only topic is revenge. But is it possible?
Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a skillful and often
effective description of the horrors which surround the monster's home
and await the attempt of an avenging foe.
