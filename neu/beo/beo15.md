# XIV

HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,  
stood by the steps, the steep roof saw,  
garnished with gold, and Grendel's hand:--  
"For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler  
be speedy thanks! A throng of sorrows  
I have borne from Grendel; but God still works  
wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.  
It was but now that I never more  
for woes that weighed on me waited help  
long as I lived, when, laved in blood,  
stood sword-gore-stained this stateliest house, --  
widespread woe for wise men all,  
who had no hope to hinder ever  
foes infernal and fiendish sprites  
from havoc in hall. This hero now,  
by the Wielder's might, a work has done  
that not all of us erst could ever do  
by wile and wisdom. Lo, well can she say  
whoso of women this warrior bore  
among sons of men, if still she liveth,  
that the God of the ages was good to her  
in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,  
of heroes best, I shall heartily love  
as mine own, my son; preserve thou ever  
this kinship new: thou shalt never lack  
wealth of the world that I wield as mine!  
Full oft for less have I largess showered,  
my precious hoard, on a punier man,  
less stout in struggle. Thyself hast now  
fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame shall endure  
through all the ages. As ever he did,  
well may the Wielder reward thee still!"  
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--  
"This work of war most willingly  
we have fought, this fight, and fearlessly dared  
force of the foe. Fain, too, were I  
hadst thou but seen himself, what time  
the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall!  
Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe  
on his bed of death to bind him down,  
that he in the hent of this hand of mine  
should breathe his last: but he broke away.  
Him I might not -- the Maker willed not --  
hinder from flight, and firm enough hold  
the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,  
the ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,  
he left behind him his hand in pledge,  
arm and shoulder; nor aught of help  
could the cursed one thus procure at all.  
None the longer liveth he, loathsome fiend,  
sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him  
tightly grasped in gripe of anguish,  
in baleful bonds, where bide he must,  
evil outlaw, such awful doom  
as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out."  
More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf\[1\]  
in boastful speech of his battle-deeds,  
since athelings all, through the earl's great prowess,  
beheld that hand, on the high roof gazing,  
foeman's fingers, -- the forepart of each  
of the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --  
heathen's "hand-spear," hostile warrior's  
claw uncanny. 'Twas clear, they said,  
that him no blade of the brave could touch,  
how keen soever, or cut away  
that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.  
\[1\] Unferth, Beowulf's sometime opponent in the flyting.
