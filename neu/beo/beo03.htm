<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">II</H1>
WENT he forth to find at fall of night<BR>
that haughty house, and heed wherever<BR>
the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.<BR>
Found within it the atheling band<BR>
asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,<BR>
of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,<BR>
grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,<BR>
wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,<BR>
thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed<BR>
fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,<BR>
laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.<BR>
Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,<BR>
the might of Grendel to men was known;<BR>
then after wassail was wail uplifted,<BR>
loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,<BR>
atheling excellent, unblithe sat,<BR>
labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,<BR>
when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,<BR>
spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,<BR>
too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;<BR>
with night returning, anew began<BR>
ruthless murder; he recked no whit,<BR>
firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.<BR>
They were easy to find who elsewhere sought<BR>
in room remote their rest at night,<BR>
bed in the bowers,[1] when that bale was shown,<BR>
was seen in sooth, with surest token, --<BR>
the hall-thane's[2] hate. Such held themselves<BR>
far and fast who the fiend outran!<BR>
Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill<BR>
one against all; until empty stood<BR>
that lordly building, and long it bode so.<BR>
Twelve years' tide the trouble he bore,<BR>
sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,<BR>
boundless cares. There came unhidden<BR>
tidings true to the tribes of men,<BR>
in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel<BR>
harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,<BR>
what murder and massacre, many a year,<BR>
feud unfading, -- refused consent<BR>
to deal with any of Daneland's earls,<BR>
make pact of peace, or compound for gold:<BR>
still less did the wise men ween to get<BR>
great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.<BR>
But the evil one ambushed old and young<BR>
death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,<BR>
lured, or lurked in the livelong night<BR>
of misty moorlands: men may say not<BR>
where the haunts of these Hell-Runes[3] be.<BR>
Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,<BR>
lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,<BR>
harassings heavy. O'er Heorot he lorded,<BR>
gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;<BR>
and ne'er could the prince[4] approach his throne,<BR>
-- 'twas judgment of God, -- or have joy in his hall.<BR>
Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings'-friend,<BR>
heart-rending misery. Many nobles<BR>
sat assembled, and searched out counsel<BR>
how it were best for bold-hearted men<BR>
against harassing terror to try their hand.<BR>
Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes<BR>
altar-offerings, asked with words[5]<BR>
that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them<BR>
for the pain of their people. Their practice this,<BR>
their heathen hope; 'twas Hell they thought of<BR>
in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,<BR>
Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,<BR>
nor Heaven's-Helmet heeded they ever,<BR>
Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man<BR>
who in harm and hatred hales his soul<BR>
to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change<BR>
awaits he ever. But well for him<BR>
that after death-day may draw to his Lord,<BR>
and friendship find in the Father's arms!<BR>
