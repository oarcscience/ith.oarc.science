<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXVII</H1>
'TWAS now, men say, in his sovran's need<BR>
that the earl made known his noble strain,<BR>
craft and keenness and courage enduring.<BR>
Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,<BR>
hardy-hearted, he helped his kinsman.<BR>
A little lower the loathsome beast<BR>
he smote with sword; his steel drove in<BR>
bright and burnished; that blaze began<BR>
to lose and lessen. At last the king<BR>
wielded his wits again, war-knife drew,<BR>
a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,<BR>
and the Weders'-helm smote that worm asunder,<BR>
felled the foe, flung forth its life.<BR>
So had they killed it, kinsmen both,<BR>
athelings twain: thus an earl should be<BR>
in danger's day! -- Of deeds of valor<BR>
this conqueror's-hour of the king was last,<BR>
of his work in the world. The wound began,<BR>
which that dragon-of-earth had erst inflicted,<BR>
to swell and smart; and soon he found<BR>
in his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,<BR>
pain of poison. The prince walked on,<BR>
wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;<BR>
then sat, and stared at the structure of giants,<BR>
where arch of stone and steadfast column<BR>
upheld forever that hall in earth.<BR>
Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless<BR>
lave with water his winsome lord,<BR>
the king and conqueror covered with blood,<BR>
with struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.<BR>
Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt,<BR>
his mortal wound; full well he knew<BR>
his portion now was past and gone<BR>
of earthly bliss, and all had fled<BR>
of his file of days, and death was near:<BR>
"I would fain bestow on son of mine<BR>
this gear of war, were given me now<BR>
that any heir should after me come<BR>
of my proper blood. This people I ruled<BR>
fifty winters. No folk-king was there,<BR>
none at all, of the neighboring clans<BR>
who war would wage me with 'warriors'-friends'[1]<BR>
and threat me with horrors. At home I bided<BR>
what fate might come, and I cared for mine own;<BR>
feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore<BR>
ever on oath. For all these things,<BR>
though fatally wounded, fain am I!<BR>
From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,<BR>
when life from my frame must flee away,<BR>
for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly go<BR>
and gaze on that hoard 'neath the hoary rock,<BR>
Wiglaf loved, now the worm lies low,<BR>
sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil bereaved.<BR>
And fare in haste. I would fain behold<BR>
the gorgeous heirlooms, golden store,<BR>
have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down<BR>
softlier for sight of this splendid hoard<BR>
my life and the lordship I long have held."<BR>

[1] That is, swords.<BR>
