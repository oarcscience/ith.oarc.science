# XXVI

BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--  
"Lo, we seafarers say our will,  
far-come men, that we fain would seek  
Hygelac now. We here have found  
hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.  
If ever on earth I am able to win me  
more of thy love, O lord of men,  
aught anew, than I now have done,  
for work of war I am willing still!  
If it come to me ever across the seas  
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --  
as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --  
thousands then of thanes I shall bring,  
heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,  
ward of his folk, that, though few his years,  
the lord of the Geats will give me aid  
by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,  
wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph  
and lending thee might when thou lackest men.  
If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,  
a sovran's son, he will surely there  
find his friends. A far-off land  
each man should visit who vaunts him brave."  
Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:--  
"These words of thine the wisest God  
sent to thy soul! No sager counsel  
from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.  
Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,  
art wise in words! I ween indeed  
if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir  
by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,  
by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,  
people's leader, -- and life be thine, --  
no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find  
at all to choose for their chief and king,  
for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt  
thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me  
the longer the better, Beowulf loved!  
Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,  
sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,  
shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,  
such as once they waged, from war refrain.  
Long as I rule this realm so wide,  
let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold  
each other greet o'er the gannet's-bath,  
and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling waves  
tokens of love. I trow my landfolk  
towards friend and foe are firmly joined,  
and honor they keep in the olden way."  
To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son  
gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls  
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,  
hale to his home, and in haste return.  
Then kissed the king of kin renowned,  
Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,  
and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears  
of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,  
he had chances twain, but he clung to this,\[1\] --  
that each should look on the other again,  
and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.  
his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;  
safe in his soul a secret longing,  
locked in his mind, for that loved man  
burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,  
glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o'er,  
warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode  
riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.  
As they hastened onward, Hrothgar's gift  
they lauded at length. -- 'Twas a lord unpeered,  
every way blameless, till age had broken  
-- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might.  
\[1\] That is, he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he was,
the latter chance was likely; but he clung to the former, hoping to see
his young friend again "and exchange brave words in the hall."
