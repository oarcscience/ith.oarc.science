# XVI

AND the lord of earls, to each that came  
with Beowulf over the briny ways,  
an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,  
precious gift; and the price\[1\] bade pay  
in gold for him whom Grendel erst  
murdered, -- and fain of them more had killed,  
had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,  
and the man's\[2\] brave mood. The Maker then  
ruled human kind, as here and now.  
Therefore is insight always best,  
and forethought of mind. How much awaits him  
of lief and of loath, who long time here,  
through days of warfare this world endures!  
Then song and music mingled sounds  
in the presence of Healfdene's head-of-armies\[3\]  
and harping was heard with the hero-lay  
as Hrothgar's singer the hall-joy woke  
along the mead-seats, making his song  
of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn.\[4\]  
Healfdene's hero, Hnaef the Scylding,  
was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.\[5\]  
Hildeburh needed not hold in value  
her enemies' honor!\[6\] Innocent both  
were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,  
bairn and brother, they bowed to fate,  
stricken by spears; 'twas a sorrowful woman!  
None doubted why the daughter of Hoc  
bewailed her doom when dawning came,  
and under the sky she saw them lying,  
kinsmen murdered, where most she had kenned  
of the sweets of the world! By war were swept, too,  
Finn's own liegemen, and few were left;  
in the parleying-place\[7\] he could ply no longer  
weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,  
and rescue his remnant by right of arms  
from the prince's thane. A pact he offered:  
another dwelling the Danes should have,  
hall and high-seat, and half the power  
should fall to them in Frisian land;  
and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald's son  
day by day the Danes should honor,  
the folk of Hengest favor with rings,  
even as truly, with treasure and jewels,  
with fretted gold, as his Frisian kin  
he meant to honor in ale-hall there.  
Pact of peace they plighted further  
on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest  
with oath, upon honor, openly promised  
that woful remnant, with wise-men's aid,  
nobly to govern, so none of the guests  
by word or work should warp the treaty,\[8\]  
or with malice of mind bemoan themselves  
as forced to follow their fee-giver's slayer,  
lordless men, as their lot ordained.  
Should Frisian, moreover, with foeman's taunt,  
that murderous hatred to mind recall,  
then edge of the sword must seal his doom.  
Oaths were given, and ancient gold  
heaped from hoard. -- The hardy Scylding,  
battle-thane best,\[9\] on his balefire lay.  
All on the pyre were plain to see  
the gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,  
boar of hard iron, and athelings many  
slain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell.  
It was Hildeburh's hest, at Hnaef's own pyre  
the bairn of her body on brands to lay,  
his bones to burn, on the balefire placed,  
at his uncle's side. In sorrowful dirges  
bewept them the woman: great wailing ascended.  
Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death-fires,  
roared o'er the hillock:\[10\] heads all were melted,  
gashes burst, and blood gushed out  
from bites\[11\] of the body. Balefire devoured,  
greediest spirit, those spared not by war  
out of either folk: their flower was gone.  
\[1\] Man-price, wergild.  
\[2\] Beowulf's.  
\[3\] Hrothgar.  
\[4\] There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms. As before about
Sigemund and Heremod, so now, though at greater length, about Finn and
his feud, a lay is chanted or recited; and the epic poet, counting on
his readers' familiarity with the story, -- a fragment of it still
exists, -- simply gives the headings.  
\[5\] The exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not to
be determined, but the following account of it is reasonable and has
good support among scholars. Finn, a Frisian chieftain, who nevertheless
has a "castle" outside the Frisian border, marries Hildeburh, a Danish
prin- cess; and her brother, Hnaef, with many other Danes, pays Finn a
visit. Relations between the two peoples have been strained before.
Something starts the old feud anew; and the visitors are attacked in
their quarters. Hnaef is killed; so is a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on
both sides. Peace is patched up; a stately funeral is held; and the
surviving visitors become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn, going
back with him to Frisia. So matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader
of the Danes; but he is set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef.
Probably he is killed in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf,
gather at their home a force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm
Finn's stronghold, kill him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh.  
\[6\] The "enemies" must be the Frisians.  
\[7\] Battlefield. -- Hengest is the "prince's thane," companion of
Hnaef. "Folcwald's son" is Finn.  
\[8\] That is, Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish warriors
who were left, provided, of course, that none of them tried to renew the
quarrel or avenge Hnaef their fallen lord. If, again, one of Finn's
Frisians began a quarrel, he should die by the sword.  
\[9\] Hnaef.  
\[10\] The high place chosen for the funeral: see description of
Beowulf's funeral-pile at the end of the poem.  
\[11\] Wounds.
