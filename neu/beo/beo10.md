# IX

ME thus often the evil monsters  
thronging threatened. With thrust of my sword,  
the darling, I dealt them due return!  
Nowise had they bliss from their booty then  
to devour their victim, vengeful creatures,  
seated to banquet at bottom of sea;  
but at break of day, by my brand sore hurt,  
on the edge of ocean up they lay,  
put to sleep by the sword. And since, by them  
on the fathomless sea-ways sailor-folk  
are never molested. -- Light from east,  
came bright God's beacon; the billows sank,  
so that I saw the sea-cliffs high,  
windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth  
earl undoomed if he doughty be!  
And so it came that I killed with my sword  
nine of the nicors. Of night-fought battles  
ne'er heard I a harder 'neath heaven's dome,  
nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man!  
Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,  
though spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,  
flood of the tide, on Finnish land,  
the welling waters. No wise of thee  
have I heard men tell such terror of falchions,  
bitter battle. Breca ne'er yet,  
not one of you pair, in the play of war  
such daring deed has done at all  
with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --  
though thou wast the bane\[1\] of thy brethren dear,  
thy closest kin, whence curse of hell  
awaits thee, well as thy wit may serve!  
For I say in sooth, thou son of Ecglaf,  
never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,  
monster dire, on thy master dear,  
in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine  
were as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!  
But he has found no feud will happen;  
from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan  
he vaunts him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.  
He forces pledges, favors none  
of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,  
fights and feasts, nor feud he dreads  
from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now  
shall I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,  
shall bid him battle. Blithe to mead  
go he that listeth, when light of dawn  
this morrow morning o'er men of earth,  
ether-robed sun from the south shall beam!"  
Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,  
hoar-haired, war-brave; help awaited  
the Bright-Danes' prince, from Beowulf hearing,  
folk's good shepherd, such firm resolve.  
Then was laughter of liegemen loud resounding  
with winsome words. Came Wealhtheow forth,  
queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,  
gold-decked, greeting the guests in hall;  
and the high-born lady handed the cup  
first to the East-Danes' heir and warden,  
bade him be blithe at the beer-carouse,  
the land's beloved one. Lustily took he  
banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.  
Through the hall then went the Helmings' Lady,  
to younger and older everywhere  
carried the cup, till come the moment  
when the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,  
to Beowulf bore the beaker of mead.  
She greeted the Geats' lord, God she thanked,  
in wisdom's words, that her will was granted,  
that at last on a hero her hope could lean  
for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,  
hardy-in-war, from Wealhtheow's hand,  
and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.  
Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--  
"This was my thought, when my thanes and I  
bent to the ocean and entered our boat,  
that I would work the will of your people  
fully, or fighting fall in death,  
in fiend's gripe fast. I am firm to do  
an earl's brave deed, or end the days  
of this life of mine in the mead-hall here."  
Well these words to the woman seemed,  
Beowulf's battle-boast. -- Bright with gold  
the stately dame by her spouse sat down.  
Again, as erst, began in hall  
warriors' wassail and words of power,  
the proud-band's revel, till presently  
the son of Healfdene hastened to seek  
rest for the night; he knew there waited  
fight for the fiend in that festal hall,  
when the sheen of the sun they saw no more,  
and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,  
and shadowy shapes came striding on,  
wan under welkin. The warriors rose.  
Man to man, he made harangue,  
Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade him hail,  
let him wield the wine hall: a word he added:--  
"Never to any man erst I trusted,  
since I could heave up hand and shield,  
this noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.  
Have now and hold this house unpeered;  
remember thy glory; thy might declare;  
watch for the foe! No wish shall fail thee  
if thou bidest the battle with bold-won life."  
\[1\] Murder.
