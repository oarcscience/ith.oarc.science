# HISTORIC TALES.

## DEATH OF CONSTANTIN II. BRANCOVAN.

MODERN history presents no greater catastrophe, nor one more nobly
endured than that of the death of Brancovan. Already this Prince had
reigned twenty-five years; an unparallelled event in Wallachian history.

Under this long reign, great ameliorations had been made in every branch
of the administration. Laws were regarded, order and security exercised
a salutary influence, agriculture flourished, commerce prospered; luxury
was introduced in the towns, comfort in the country, magnificence at
Court. Added to this material prosperity, was joined the elements of
intellectual culture.

From the commencement of his reign, Brancovan, seeing the rising tide of
Ottoman oppression submerge, one by one, the last traces of Roumanian
independence, meditated, like some of his illustrious predecessors, the
absolute freedom of his country.

On the other hand the Sultans, their Viziers, and their minions,
contemplated its complete subjugation, in order to profit without
obstacle or control, by "*the garden and granary of Stamboul*."

Both the intelligence and the resources of Brancovan were equal to the
great work which he projected. Knowing thoroughly the character of the
Turk, possessing immense wealth, wisely accumulated from year to year,
notwithstanding the extortions, and the endless exactions of the
Suzerain Power, politician enough to interest both the Empire and Russia
in his cause, he could, according to all the rules of human prudence,
calculate on success. Unhappily, circumstances were against him. The
peace of Karlovitz, rendered help from the Empire hopeless, so he looked
with confidence towards Russia, which Peter the Great was then making
celebrated in Europe; but the jealousy of Cantimir, Prince of Moldavia,
and the treaty of the Pruth, broke down all his clever combinations.

The Sublime Porte, informed by its spies of what was taking place at
Bucharest, and of the projects of Brancovan, resolved to depose him, to
seize his person, and to have him brought to Constantinople, to do with
him according to its pleasure. But Brancovan was so rich, that his gold
made him

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

friends even in the heart of the Divan; he sent the Viziers, the Sultan
even, such magnificent presents, that they postponed his ruin.

He believed he had surmounted the danger, and credulous in his good
fortune, like many other successful men, he remained deaf to the
warnings of his friends, the entreaties of his family, even to the
presentiments of one of his daughters, who, dying in the flower of her
age, before expiring, had the frightful vision of the martyrdom of her
father and brothers.

Accusations arriving from Bucharest, complaints covered with false
Signatures, hurried on the catastrophe. On March 22, 1714, Capidji
Moustafa Aga arrived at Bucharest, bearing the firman of dethronement.
He was introduced into the palace with an escort of twelve *Tchohodars*,
secretly armed, with poignards and pistols, and solemnly deposed
Brancovan in the throne room, throwing upon his shoulders the black
veil, and pronouncing the terrible word *Mazil* (deposed).

The Turkish Envoy set off again quickly for Constantinople, taking with
him, as prisoners, Constantin Brancovan and his family.

On his arrival at Stamboul, the captives were conducted to the castle of
the seven towers, a state

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

prison celebrated in Turkish annals for the multitude of its bloody
tragedies. It was the threshold of agony, and agony did not keep them
long in waiting.

The Sultan, Achmet III. himself presided at the slaughter, and the
unfortunate Brancovan, his soul elevated by the sublimest Christian
sentiments, washed, with his blood, any stains that might have been in
his life.

By a refinement of savage cruelty, after having tortured the father in
the presence of his children, before the father's eyes they cut off the
heads, one by one, of his four sons. Each time that the head of these
young Princes fell, the Sultan offered to pardon Brancovan, if he would
embrace Mahometanism; the heroic father pointed towards heaven, and the
slaughter continued. When Brancovan's turn arrived to lay his head on
the block, he said with resignation: "If my death comes from God, as a
punishment for my sins, His will be done; if it comes from my enemies,
may Heaven forgive them." And, deaf to the voice of the Sultan, who
still bade him deny his Christ, and with eyes raised to heaven, stood
still as a statue! Achmet gave a sign, bright steel glimmered, a jet of
blood covered the wall, and the soul of the good old. man had rejoined
those of his sons.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

There remained yet a sixth victim--a poor little child, the only
grandson of Brancovan. Mad with terror, the child hid himself in the
Caftan of Bostandjibachi, who, overwhelmed with benefits by the murdered
Princes, much against his will, had been forced to be present at all
these atrocities.

He had the hardihood to take the boy in his arms, and to cast an
imploring look at the Sultan. The ferocious Achmet, regarding the child,
and then the five corpses, made a sign of pardon, and so the last heir
of this illustrious family was saved.

The heads of the five martyrs, stuck on lances, were carried about in
the streets of Stamboul, preceded by heralds, crying, "this is the end
of traitors." Their bodies were thrown into the sea, but at nightfall
some Christian boatmen drew them out, and they were piously buried in a
little Island in the Sea of Marmora.

The domains of Brancovan were confiscated, and his almost fabulous
riches were shared between the Sultan, and the instigators of his ruin.

This touching and terrible catastrophe, made a profound impression not
only in Wallachia and Moldavia, but throughout Europe. Transmitted from
generation to generation, it has passed from history to legend, which is
recounted from the Danube

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

to the Carpathians, in cities and in villages, and at the modest
firesides of the Roumanian peasants. The native poet, Alexandri, has
made it the subject of one of his most beautiful and touching ballads.
