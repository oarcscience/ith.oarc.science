# FAIRY TALES.

<span id="img_00100"></span> ![](img/00100.jpg)

## THE SLIPPERS OF THE TWELVE PRINCESSES.

### I.

ONCE on a time, in the good old times, there lived a cow-herd, who had
neither father nor mother. He was called Jonica, that is to say Johnnie,
but people had given him the name of *Gura Casca* (open mouth) because
when he led his cows to pasture, he bellowed at every thing which he met
on the way. Otherwise he was really a very pretty boy, his face was
fair, and his eyes as blue as a morsel of the sky, with hair curling,
and as yellow as the rays of the Sun. The young girls of the village
teased him sadly. "Hé! Hé! Jonica, where are you going with your open
mouth"? "What does that matter to you"? he would reply tranquilly, and
pass on his way. Though only a cow-herd, he was sufficiently proud of
his good looks, and he knew quite well the difference between beauty and
ugliness, so the young peasant girls with their faces and throats tanned
by

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

the sun, their large hands red and cracked, their feet shod in "opinci"
(a rough sort of sandal) or other common leather, were not at all to his
mind.

He had heard tell, that, down there, a long way off, in the towns, the
young girls were quite different; that they had throats as white as
alabaster, pink cheeks, delicate and soft hands, their small feet
covered by satin slippers, that in short they were clad in robes of silk
and gold, and were called Princesses. So that, while his comrades only
sought to please some rustic villager, he dreamed, neither more nor
less, that he should marry a Princess.

### II.

One noon-day in the middle of August, when the sun was so scorching that
even the flies did not know where to put themselves, Jonica sat down
under the shadow of an oak to eat his *mammaliga* (thick Indian meal
porridge) and a morsel of sheep's milk cheese; seeing that his flock was
lying peaceably about, he stretched himself at fall length, and was soon
asleep.

He had a charming dream! a *Zina*, a fairy, appeared to him, beautiful
as the day, fresh as a rose,

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span id="img_00300"></span> ![](img/00300.jpg)  
JONICA'S DREAM

and clad in a robe sparkling with diamonds. She said to him--

"There is a country where precious stones grow; go to the Court of the
Emperor who reigns there, and you will marry a Princess."

In the evening, when he took his cows back to the stable, Jonica
recounted his dream to several of his friends, who freely laughed at
him. But the words of the Zina had such an influence on him, that he
laughed himself at the ridicule of which he was the object.

The next day, at the same hour, and the same place, our cow-herd came to
take his siesta. He had the same dream; and the same fairy, more radiant
than ever, appeared again to him, and repeated: "There is a country
where precious stones grow; go to the Court of the Emperor who reigns
there and you will marry a Princess."

Jonica again repeated his dream, and it was again turned into ridicule.

"What does it matter to me," said Jonica, "if they laugh! I know one
thing, that if that fairy appears again to me, I'll follow her advice."

On the following day he had the same dream, he got up joyfully, and in
the evening they heard him in the village singing: "I quit the cows and
calves,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

for I am going to marry the daughter of an Emperor."

His master, who overheard him, became thoughtful, but Jonica said to
him, "You may do, and think as you like, but it is decided! I am going
away!" He began to make his preparations, and in the morning he left.

The people of the village held their sides with laughing, when they saw
him with his little bundle on a stick, slung across his shoulder,
descend the hill, traverse the plain, and then slowly disappear, in the
dim distance.

### III.

In those days, people did say that there was really a country where
precious stones grew, as grass, plants, and flowers grow in other
places. It was said that the Emperor of these parts had twelve
daughters--twelve Princesses, the one prettier than the other, but all
as proud as they were beautiful. It was said also, that they only went
to sleep at sunrise, and got up at mid-day.

They lived altogether in one large room of the Palace, and slept in beds
of gold, encrusted with flowers of diamonds and emeralds.

When the Princesses retired in the evening, the

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

nine doors of their apartment were locked outside with nine padlocks. It
was impossible for them to get out, and yet each night something very
extraordinary took place.

The satin slippers of the twelve Princesses, were literally worn out
each morning. One might have thought that the daughters of the Emperor
had danced all night. When they were questioned, they declared that they
knew nothing, and could understand nothing about it. No one could
explain this strange fact, for, notwithstanding the greatest
watchfulness, not the least noise had ever been heard in the chamber of
the Princesses, after they had retired to rest.

The Emperor, their father, was most perplexed, and determined, at any
price, to penetrate this mystery. He had a trumpet sounded, and it was
published throughout all the country, that if any one succeeded in
finding out, by what means his daughters, the Princesses, wore out their
slippers in a single night, he might choose from amongst them, his wife.
At this news, a great number of Emperors' sons, and Kings' sons,
presented themselves to explore this adventure. They hid themselves
behind a great curtain in the chamber of the Princesses. But once there,
no one ever heard any more of them, and they never re-appeared.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Our Jonica, who arrived just then at the Court of the Emperor, heard
talk of all these matters, and succeeded in being taken into the service
of one of the Imperial Gardeners, who) had been obliged to send away one
of his best helps. His new master did not find him very intelligent, but
he was convinced that his curling light hair and good looks, would make
him acceptable to the Princesses.

Thus his daily duty, then, was each morning to present a bouquet to the
daughters of the Emperor. Jonica posted himself at their door, at the
hour of their awakening, and as each came forth, he presented her with a
bouquet. They found the flowers very beautiful, but disdained to cast a
look or smile on poor Jonica, who remained there more than ever, *Gura
Casca*, open-mouthed.

Lina, alone, the youngest, the most graceful, and the prettiest of the
Princesses, let fall by hazard on him, a look as soft as velvet. "Ah! my
sisters," cried she, "how good looking our young gardener is!"

They burst into mocking laughter, and the eldest remarked to Lina, that
it was unbecoming a Princess to lower her eyes to a valet. Nevertheless,
Jonica intoxicated by the looks and the beauty of

Lina, thought of the promise of the Emperor, and it

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

entered into his head to try and discover the mystery of the slippers.
He did not mention it to any one though, for he was afraid that the
Emperor might hear of it, be angry, and have him driven away from Court,
as a punishment for his audacity.

### IV.

While these thoughts were passing through his brain, Jonica dreamed
again of the fairy with the sparkling robe. She held in her right hand
two small laurel branches, one was as red as a cherry, and the other
like a rose; in her left hand was a little golden spade, a watering can
of the same metal, and a silken veil.

She gave all these to Jonica, saying, "Plant these two laurels in large
boxes, turn over the earth with this spade, water them with this
watering-can, and wipe them with this silken veil. When they have grown
three feet high, say to each separately, "Beautiful laurels, with a
golden spade I have dug you, with a golden watering-can I have watered
you, and with a silken veil I have wiped you." "This said, you can ask
anything you wish, and it will be accorded you." When Jonica awoke he
found the two laurels and the other objects on the table, and fell on
his knees to thank the good fairy. He at

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

once began to carry out her instructions. The shrubs grew rapidly, and
when they had attained the necessary height, he went to the cherry
laurel, and said:

"Beautiful cherry laurel, with a golden spade I have dug you, with a
golden can I have watered you, with a silken veil I have wiped you;
grant me in exchange, the gift of becoming invisible whenever I desire."
Immediately he saw grow out from the laurel, a beautiful white flower.
He gathered it, placed it in his button-hole, and at once became
invisible.

When night arrived, the Princesses went up to their bedroom, and Jonica,
bare-footed, so as to make no noise, glided up behind them, and hid
himself underneath one of the twelve beds.

Then, instead of preparing themselves to go to bed, each of the
Princesses opened a wardrobe, and took out their richest dresses and
finest jewels. Each assisting the other, they dressed *en grande
toilette*. Jonica could see nothing from his hiding place, but he heard
them laugh, and dance with joy. The eldest, who seemed to have great
authority over them, hurried them, and kept exclaiming: "Be quick, my
sisters, our dancers are dying of impatience." At the end of an hour,
the laughing and

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

talking ceased. Jonica carefully put out his head, and saw that the
Princesses were dressed like fairies. They wore quite new satin
slippers, and held in their hands the bouquets which he had offered to
them in the morning.

They placed themselves one behind the other, and the eldest who was at
the head, struck three blows in a peculiar manner, on a certain part of
the wall. A door quite invisible opened, and the Princesses disappeared.

Jonica followed them noiselessly, but by accident he placed his foot on
the train of the Princess Lina. "There is some one behind me," she
cried, "some one trod on my dress." The eldest turned round quickly, but
seeing no one, exclaimed, "how foolish you are Lina, you must have
caught it against a nail."

The twelve daughters of the Emperor, descended, and descended, and
descended until they arrived at an underground passage, at the end of
which was an iron door with a strong bolt.

The eldest opened this, and then they found themselves in an enchanted
bower, where the leaves of the trees were in silver, and sparkled in the
moonlight. They walked on until they came to a second bower, and here
the trees had golden leaves; still on,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

and then a third bower, where the leaves were of emeralds and rubies and
diamonds, and their rays were so bright that one might have thought it
was full daylight. The princesses continued their walk, and (Jonica
still following), arrived soon on the borders of a large lake.

On this lake were twelve boats, and in each boat one of the lost sons of
an Emperor, who, oar in hand, each waited for a Princess. Jonica took
his place in the boat of the Princess Lina. The boat, being more heavily
laden, could not float so quickly as the others, and so was always
behind. "I do not know," said Lina to her cavalier, "why we do not go so
quickly as at other times, what can be the matter?"

"I do not understand it either," said the Emperor's son, "for I row with
all my force."

On the other side of the lake the little gardener perceived a beautiful
palace, illuminated *a giorno*, and heard harmonious sounds of violins,
trumpets and cymbals. The Emperors' sons each having a Princess on his
arm entered the palace, and after them came Jonica into a saloon lighted
by ten lustres.

The walls were immense mirrors, in gold frames set with precious stones.
On a centre table a massive

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

golden vase contained an enormous bouquet of flowers which gave forth an
exquisite perfume. Poor Jonica was literally dazed and petrified by the
sight of so much splendour. When able to look at, and admire the
Princesses in the midst of this dazzling light, he lost his wits
completely, and looked so ardently with his eyes, that one would have
thought that he wished to taste them also with his mouth. Some were
fair, some were brown, and nearly all of them had let fall their
beautiful hair down their pretty white shoulders. Never, even in his
dreams, had the poor boy seen such enchanteresses.

But amongst them all, and above all, it was Lina, who seemed to him the
most graceful, the most beautiful, thee most intoxicating, with her dark
eyes and long-hair--the shade of a raven's wing. And with what fire she
danced! leaning on the shoulder of her cavalier, Lina turned as light as
a spindle. Her face was flushed, her eyes shone like two stars, and it
was evident that dancing was her great delight.

Poor Jonica let fall envious looks on the Emperors' sons, and heartily
regretted not to be on the same footing, so that he also might have had
the right to be cavalier to such beautiful young creatures. All these
dancers, to the number of fifty, were Emperors' sons who had tried to
discover the secret of the Princesses.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These latter had
enticed them to a midnight expedition, and had given them to drink at
table, an enchanted beverage, which had frozen their blood, killed in
them every sentiment of love, every remembrance, or worldly desire,
leaving them only the ardent pleasure of the dance, in the bosom of this
splendid palace, become henceforth their eternal habitation.

### VI.

The Princesses danced until their white satin slippers were in holes,
until the cock had crowed three times. Then the music ceased, black
slaves arranged a princely table, which was instantaneously filled with
the most succulent meats, and the rarest and most exquisite wines. Each
one took his place, and ate and drank at his ease, excepting our poor
*Gusa Casca*, who had to content himself with feasting his eyes alone.
When the repast was over, the Princesses re-entered their boat, and
Jonica who followed them step by step, arrived with them in the wood
with the silver leaves.

There, to prove to himself, and to prove also to others, that what he
had seen was no dream, Jonica broke off a branch of the tree with the
beautiful leaves. The noise which he made, caused Lina to

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

turn round. "What can that be?" said she to her sisters. "Probably,"
said the eldest, it is the rustling amongst the branches of some bird,
that has its nest in one of the towers of the Palace." Jonica then got
in advance of the Princesses, and mounted rapidly to their chamber,
opened the window, and glided silently along the trellis which covered
the wall, and began his daily work.

While preparing the flowers for the Princesses, he hid the branch of
Silver Leaves in the bouquet destined for Lina.

Great was the astonishment of the young girl, who asked herself, in
vain, how it was possible that the branch could have come there.

Without saying anything to her sisters, she went down into the garden,
and there, under the shade of a large chestnut tree, she found the
gardener. She had for the moment, a great mind to speak to him, but on
reflection, thought it better to wait a little, and so passed on her
way.

When evening arrived, the Princesses again returned to the Ball, Jonica
followed them, and a second time entered Lina's boat. Again the
Emperor's son complained of the labour required in rowing. "No doubt it
is the heat which you feel," replied Lina. All passed as on the previous
evening,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

but this time, on returning, Jonica broke off a branch of the Golden
Leaves.

When the daily bouquets were distributed, the Princess Lina found,
concealed in hers, the golden branch. Remaining a little behind her
sisters, and showing the golden branch to Jonica, she asked, "From
whence, hadst thou these leaves?"

"Your Highness knows quite well."

"So thou hast followed us?"

"Yes, Highness."

"And how didst thou manage that?"

"It is a secret."

"We did not see thee."

"I was invisible."

"At any rate, I see that thou hast penetrated the mystery. Speak of it
to no one, and take this purse as the price of thy silence," and she
throw to the poor boy, a purse of gold. "I do not sell my silence," said
Jonica, with a haughtiness which astonished the Princess. "I know how to
hold my tongue, without being paid for it." And he walked away, leaving
the purse on the ground.

The three succeeding days, Lina neither saw nor heard anything
particular, during their nocturnal excursions; but the fourth night,
there was a distinct rustling in the wood of Diamond Leaves, and the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

next morning she found a Diamond Branch, hidden in her bouquet. Then she
was fully convinced that the young gardener knew all their escapades,
and calling him to her, she asked:

"Dost thou know the price, which the Emperor, our father, offers for the
discovery of our secret?"

"I know it, Highness."

"Then why dost thou not go to him, and betray it?"

"I do not wish."

"Art thou afraid?"

"No, Highness."

"Then, why wilt thou not speak?"

Jonica looked up at her, his eyes full of expression, but did not reply.

### VII.

While Lina was talking with the youth, her sisters were laughing at her,
and when she came back they still went on with their ridicule, until she
became quite red with anger.

"Thou canst marry him," said her sisters, "there is nothing to prevent;
thou wilt be the gardener's wife, and thou wilt live in the cottage at
the bottom of the garden. 'Thou canst help thy husband to draw the water
from the fountain, and thou canst offer us our daily nosegays."

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

Lina became still more angry, and the weight of her anger fell on poor
Jonica. When he again presented her with flowers, she took them with
supreme indifference, and treated him with the greatest disdain. The
poor fellow could not understand it, for he was always most respectful.
He never dared to look her full in the face, and yet she felt he was
present with her all day long. At length, she came to the resolution to
confide to her sisters all that she knew.

"What!" cried they, "this stupid boy has learned our secret, and thou
hast kept it from us! We must, at once, absolutely get rid of him."

"By what means?"

"Have him stabbed, and thrown into a cave."

This was the usual way by which troublesome people were disposed of.

But Lina would not hear of this, saying that the poor boy had committed
no fault.

"If you touch a hair of his head," she said, "I will go and confess all
to our father the Emperor."

To tranquilise Lina, it was decided to get Jonica to go again to the
Ball, and to make him drink the enchanted beverage, which would put him
in the same state as the other Cavaliers. So they called the young
gardener to them, and the eldest sister

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

asked him by what means he had discovered their secret? but he would
give them no answer. Then they informed him of the decision which they
had come to respecting him. He replied, that he accepted it, and that he
would drink willingly the enchanted beverage, so as to become the
Cavalier of her whom he loved.

On the day fixed, wishing to have as fine clothes, and to be able to
make as handsome presents as the Emperors' sons, Jonica went to the rose
laurel, and said "my beautiful laurel, I have dug you with a golden
spade, I have watered you with a golden watering can, I have wiped you
with a silken veil, grant that, in one moment, I may be as richly
dressed as an Emperor's son."

Immediately he saw a beautiful flower expand, and gathering it, he was
at once clad in velvet as dark and soft as Lina's eyes, a toque to
match, with an agraffe of diamonds, and a flower in his buttonhole. From
being tanned and brown, his complexion became fair and fresh as an
infant's and his beauty was marvellous. Even his common, vulgar manner
changed completely, and any one might have thought him really an
Emperor's son.

Thus metamorphosed, he presented himself before the Emperor, to ask his
authority to try in his turn,

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

to unravel the secret of the Princesses. He was so changed that the
Emperor did not recognize him.

When the Princesses went back to their bedroom, Jonica was waiting for
them behind the door. After their usual excursion, Jonica gave his arm
to the eldest Princess, and afterwards danced with each of the sisters
successively, and with so much dignity and grace, that they were all
enchanted. When it was Lina's turn, he was in raptures; but he did not
address a single word to her. While conducting her to her place, the
Princess said to him, jokingly, "Being treated like an Emperor's son,
thou must be in blissful happiness." "Never fear, Princess," replied he,
"you shall not be a gardener's wife." Lina looked at him, half
frightened, but he walked away, without waiting for her answer.

When the Princesses had once more danced until their slippers were in
holes, the music ceased, the black slaves prepared the table as usual,
and Jonica was placed at the right hand of the eldest Princess, and
facing Lina. He was served with the most delicate meats, the choicest
wines; compliments and praises were showered on him, but he was neither
intoxicated by their wines, nor by their flatteries. Presently the
eldest Princess made a sign, and one of the slaves came forward bearing
a massive golden cup.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

"This enchanted Palace has no longer any secrets for thee," cried the
Princess to Jonica, "Let us drink to your triumph!" The young man
casting tender glance at Lina, raised the cup to his lips.

"Do not drink it," she cried impetuously, "do not drink it, I would
rather be a gardener's wife," and she began to weep.

Jonica threw the enchanted beverage over his shoulder, cleared the
table, and fell on his knees at the feet of the Princess Lina. All the
other Emperors' sons fell each at the feet of their respective
Princesses, who choosing them for their husbands, held out their hands
and raised them from the ground.

The charm was broken!

The twelve couples crossed the lake in boats, traversed the forests,
passed through the cellar, and arrived at the Emperor's chamber. Jonica,
with the golden cup in his hand, explained to him the mystery of the
worn-out slippers. "God give thee life, young man," said the Emperor,
"take thy choice from amongst my daughters."

"My choice has been made for a long time," said he, taking by the hand
the Princess Lina, who blushed and could not look up.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

### IX.

The Princess Lina did not become a gardener's wife, for Jonica became a
Prince. Before their marriage took place, Lina enquired of him, how he
had discovered their secret. Jonica showed her the two laurels. Lina,
like an intelligent woman, thought that Jonica would have too great an
advantage over her, if he enjoyed the power which was given to him by
possessing these shrubs, so she tore the laurels up by their roots and
flung them into the fire.

A short time afterwards, the marriage took place with imperial
splendour. It was followed by festivities which lasted three days and
three nights, and the young people lived very happily together, to a
good old age.
