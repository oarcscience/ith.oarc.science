# CHAPTER III

### THE FREEING OF THE WATERS

'To begin at the beginning,' was the old story-telling formula, and it
was a very sound one, if 'the beginning' could only be definitely
ascertained! As our nearest possible approach to it I would draw
attention to certain curious parallels in the earliest literary
monuments of our race. I would at the same time beg those scholars who
may think it 'a far cry' from the romances of the twelfth century of our
era to some 1000 years B.C. to suspend their judgment till they have
fairly examined the evidence for a tradition common to the Aryan race in
general, and persisting with extraordinary vitality, and a marked
correspondence of characteristic detail, through all migrations and
modifications of that race, down to the present day.

Turning back to the earliest existing literary evidence, the *Rig-Veda*,
we become aware that, in this vast collection of over 1000 poems (it is
commonly known as *The Thousand and One Hymns* but the poems contained
in it are more than that in number) are certain parallels with our Grail
stories which, if taken by themselves, are perhaps interesting and
suggestive rather than in any way conclusive, yet which, when they are
considered in relation to the entire body of evidence, assume a curious
significance and importance. We must first note that a very considerable
number of the *Rig-Veda* hymns depend for their initial inspiration on
the actual bodily needs and requirements of a mainly agricultural
population, *i.e.*, of a people that

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

depend upon the fruits of the earth for their subsistence, and to whom
the regular and ordered sequence of the processes of Nature was a vital
necessity.

Their hymns and prayers, and, as we have strong reason to suppose, their
dramatic ritual, were devised for the main purpose of obtaining from the
gods of their worship that which was essential to ensure their
well-being and the fertility of their land--warmth, sunshine, above all,
sufficient water. That this last should, in an Eastern land, under a
tropical sun, become a point of supreme importance, is easily to be
understood. There is consequently small cause for surprise when we find,
throughout the collection, the god who bestows upon them this much
desired boon to be the one to whom by far the greater proportion of the
hymns are addressed. It is not necessary here to enter into a discussion
as to the original conception of Indra, and the place occupied by him in
the early Aryan Pantheon, whether he was originally regarded as a god of
war, or a god of weather; what is important for our purpose is the fact
that it is Indra to whom a disproportionate number of the hymns of the
*Rig-Veda* are addressed, that it is from him the much desired boon of
rain and abundant water is besought, and that the feat which above all
others redounded to his praise, and is ceaselessly glorified both by the
god himself, and his grateful worshippers, is precisely the feat by
which the Grail heroes, Gawain and Perceval, rejoiced the hearts of a
suffering folk, *i.e.*, the restoration of the rivers to their channels,
the 'Freeing of the Waters.' Tradition relates that the seven great
rivers of India had been imprisoned by the evil giant, V<u>r</u>itra, or
Ahi, whom Indra slew, thereby releasing the streams from their
captivity.

The *Rig-Veda* hymns abound in references to this feat; it will only be
necessary to cite a few from among the numerous passages I have noted.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

'Thou hast set loose the seven rivers to flow.'

'Thou causest water to flow on every side.'

'Indra set free the waters.'

'Thou, Indra, hast slain Vritra by thy vigour, thou hast set free the
rivers.'

'Thou hast slain the slumbering Ahi for the release of the waters, and
hast marked out the channels of the all-delighting rivers.'

'Indra has filled the rivers, he has inundated the dry land.'

'Indra has released the imprisoned waters to flow upon the earth <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md).'

It would be easy to fill pages with similar quotations, but these are
sufficient for our purpose.

Among the *Rig-Veda* hymns are certain poems in Dialogue form, which
from their curious and elliptic character have been the subject of much
discussion among scholars. Professor Oldenberg, in drawing attention to
their peculiarities, had expressed his opinion that these poems were the
remains of a distinct type of early Indian literature, where verses
forming the central, and illuminating, point of a formal ceremonial
recital had been 'farced' with illustrative and explanatory prose
passages; the form of the verses being fixed, that of the prose being
varied at the will of the reciter <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md).

This theory, which is technically known as the 'Âkhyâna' theory (as it
derived its starting point from the discussion of the
Supar<u>n</u>âkhyâna text), won considerable support, but was contested
by M. Sylvain Lévi, who asserted that, in these hymns, we had the
remains of the earliest, and oldest, Indian dramatic creations, the
beginning of the

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Indian Drama; and that the fragments could only
be satisfactorily interpreted from the point of view that they were
intended to be spoken, not by a solitary reciter, but by two or more
*dramatis personae* <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md).

J. Hertel (*Der Ursprung des Indischen Dramas und Epos*) went still
further, and while accepting, and demonstrating, the justice of this
interpretation of the 'Dialogue' poems, suggested a similar origin for
certain 'Monologues' found in the same collection <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md).

Professor Leopold von Schroeder, in his extremely interesting volume,
*Mysterium und Mimus im Rig-Veda* <span id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md),
has given a popular and practical form to the results of these
researches, by translating and publishing, with an explanatory study, a
selection of these early 'Culture' Dramas, explaining the speeches, and
placing them in the mouth of the respective actors to whom they were,
presumably, assigned. Professor von Schroeder holds the entire group to
be linked together by one common intention, *viz*., the purpose of
stimulating the processes of Nature, and of obtaining, as a result of
what may be called a Ritual Culture Drama, an abundant return of the
fruits of the earth. The whole book is rich in parallels drawn from
ancient and modern sources, and is of extraordinary interest to the
Folk-lore student.

In the light thrown by Professor von Schroeder's researches, following
as they do upon the illuminating studies of Mannhardt, and Frazer, we
become strikingly aware of the curious vitality and persistence of
certain popular customs and beliefs; and while the two last-named
writers have rendered inestimable service to the study of Comparative
Religion by linking the practices of Classical

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

and Medieval times with the Folk-customs of to-day, we recognize,
through von Schroeder's work, that the root of such belief and custom is
imbedded in a deeper stratum of Folk-tradition than we had hitherto
realized, that it is, in fact, a heritage from the far-off past of the
Aryan peoples.

For the purposes of our especial line of research *Mysterium und Mimus*
offers much of value and interest. As noted above, the main object of
these primitive Dramas was that of encouraging, we may say, ensuring,
the fertility of the Earth; thus it is not surprising that more than one
deals with the theme of which we are treating, the Freeing of the
Waters, only that whereas, in the quotations given above, the
worshippers praise Indra for his beneficent action, here Indra himself,
*in propria persona* appears, and vaunts his feat.

"Ich schlug den V<u>r</u>itra mit der Kraft des Indra!  
Durch eignen Grimm war ich so stark geworden!  
Ich machte für die Menschen frei die Wasser <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)."

\[paragraph continues\] And the impersonated rivers speak for
themselves.

"Indra, den Blitz im Arm, brach uns die Bahnen,  
Er schlug den V<u>r</u>itra, die Ströme einschloss <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md)."

\[paragraph continues\] There is no need to insist further on the point
that the task of the Grail hero is in this special respect no mere
literary invention, but a heritage from the achievements of the
prehistoric heroes of the Aryan race.

But the poems selected by Professor von Schroeder for discussion offer
us a further, and more curious, parallel with the Grail romances.

In Section VIII. of the work referred to the author discusses the story
of <u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga, as the *Mahâbhârata* names the hero; here
we find a young Brahmin brought up by his father, Vibhâ<u>nd</u>aka, in
a lonely forest hermitage <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md) absolutely

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

ignorant of the outside world, and even of the very existence of beings
other than his father and himself. He has never seen a woman, and does
not know that such a creature exists.

A drought falls upon a neighbouring kingdom, and the inhabitants are
reduced to great straits for lack of food. The King, seeking to know by
what means the sufferings of his people may be relieved, learns that so
long as <u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga continues chaste so long will the
drought endure. An old woman, who has a fair daughter of irregular life,
undertakes the seduction of the hero. The King has a ship, or raft (both
versions are given), fitted out with all possible luxury, and an
apparent Hermit's cell erected upon it. The old woman, her daughter and
companions, embark; and the river carries them to a point not far from
the young Brahmin's hermitage.

Taking advantage of the absence of his father, the girl visits
<u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga in his forest cell, giving him to understand
that she is a Hermit, like himself, which the boy, in his innocence,
believes. He is so fascinated by her appearance and caresses that, on
her leaving him, he, deep in thought of the lovely visitor, forgets, for
the first time, his religious duties.

On his father's return he innocently relates what has happened, and the
father warns him that fiends in this fair disguise strive to tempt
hermits to their undoing. The next time the father is absent the
temptress, watching her opportunity, returns, and persuades the boy to
accompany her to her 'Hermitage' which she assures him, is far more
beautiful than his own. So soon as <u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga is safely
on board the ship sails, the lad is carried to the capital of the
rainless land, the King gives him his daughter as wife, and so soon as
the marriage is consummated the spell is broken, and rain falls in
abundance.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Professor von Schroeder points out that there is little doubt that, in
certain earlier versions of the tale, the King's daughter herself played
the *rôle* of temptress.

There is no doubt that a ceremonial 'marriage' very frequently formed a
part of the 'Fertility' ritual, and was supposed to be specially
efficacious in bringing about the effect desired <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md). The practice subsists in Indian ritual to
this hour, and the surviving traces in European Folk-custom have been
noted in full by Mannhardt in his exhaustive work on *Wald und
Feld-Kulte*; its existence in Classic times is well known, and it is
certainly one of the living Folk-customs for which a well-attested chain
of descent can be cited. Professor von Schroeder remarks that the
efficacy of the rite appears to be enhanced by the previous strict
observance of the rule of chastity by the officiant <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md).

What, however, is of more immediate interest for our purpose is the fact
that the <u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga story does, in effect, possess
certain curious points of contact with the Grail tradition.

Thus, the lonely upbringing of the youth in a forest, far from the
haunts of men, his absolute ignorance of the existence of human beings
other than his parent and himself, present a close parallel to the
accounts of Perceval's youth and woodland life, as related in the Grail
romances <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md).

In Gerbert's continuation we are told that the marriage of the hero is
an indispensable condition of achieving the Quest, a detail which must
have been taken over from an earlier version, as Gerbert proceeds to
stultify himself by describing the solemnities of the marriage, and the
ceremonial blessing of the nuptial couch, after which hero and

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

heroine simultaneously agree to live a life of strict chastity, and are
rewarded by the promise that the Swan Knight shall be their
descendant--a tissue of contradictions which can only be explained by
the *mal-à-droit* blending of two versions, one of which knew the hero
as wedded, the other, as celibate. There can be no doubt that the
original *Perceval* story included the marriage of the hero <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md).

The circumstances under which <u>R</u>ishyaç<u>r</u>iñga is lured from
his Hermitage are curiously paralleled by the account, found in the
*Queste* and Manessier, of Perceval's temptation by a fiend, in the form
of a fair maiden, who comes to him by water in a vessel hung with black
silk, and with great riches on board <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md).

In pointing out these parallels I wish to make my position perfectly
clear; I do not claim that either in the *Rig-Veda*, or in any other
early Aryan literary monument, we can hope to discover the direct
sources of the Grail legend, but what I would urge upon scholars is the
fact that, in adopting the hypothesis of a Nature Cult as a possible
origin, and examining the history of these Cults, their evolution, and
their variant forms, we do, in effect, find at every period and stage of
development undoubted points of contact, which, though taken separately,
might be regarded as accidental, in their *ensemble* can hardly be thus
considered. When every parallel to our Grail story is found within the
circle of a well-defined, and carefully studied, sequence of belief and
practice, when each and all form part of a well-recognized body of
tradition the descent of which has been abundantly demonstrated, then I
submit such parallels stand on a sound basis, and it is not unreasonable
to conclude

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

that the body of tradition containing them belongs to the same family
and is to be interpreted on the same principles as the closely analogous
rites and ceremonies.

I suspend the notice and discussion of other poems contained in Prof.
von Schroeder's collection till we have reached a later stage of the
tradition, when their correspondence will be recognized as even more
striking and suggestive.
