# CHAPTER XII

### MITHRA AND ATTIS

The fact that there was, at a very early date, among a certain sect of
Christian Gnostics, a well-developed body of doctrine, based upon the
essential harmony existing between the Old Faith and the New, which
claimed by means of a two-fold Initiation to impact to the inner circle
of its adherents the secret of life, physical and spiritual, being, in
face of the evidence given in the previous chapter, placed beyond any
possible doubt, we must now ask, is there any evidence that such
teaching survived for any length of time, or could have penetrated to
the British Isles, where, in view of the priority of the
*Bleheris-Gawain* form, the Grail legend, as we know it, seems to have
originated? I think there is at least presumptive evidence of such
preservation, and transmission. I have already alluded to the close
connection existing between the Attis cult, and the worship of the
popular Persian deity, Mithra, and have given quotations from Cumont
illustrating this connection; it will be worth while to study the
question somewhat more closely, and discover, if possible, the reason
for this intimate alliance.

On the face of it there seems to be absolutely no reason for the
connection of these cults; the two deities in no way resemble each
other; the stories connected with them have no possible analogy; the
root conception is widely divergent.

With the character of the deity we know as Adonis, or Attis, we are now
thoroughly familiar. In the first instance it seems to be the human
element in the myth which is most insisted upon. He is a mortal youth
beloved by a

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

great goddess; only after his tragic death does he appear to assume
divine attributes, and, alike in death and resurrection, become the
accepted personification of natural energies.

Baudissin, *Adonis und Esmun*, remarks that Adonis belongs to "einer
Klasse von Wesen sehr unbestimmter Art der wohl über den Menschen aber
unter den grossen Göttern stehen, und weniger Individualität besitzen
als diese <span id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_242.md)." Such a criticism
applies of course equally to Attis.

Mithra, on the other hand, occupies an entirely different position.
Cumont, in his *Mystères de Mithra*, thus describes him; he is "le génie
de la lumière céleste. Il n'est ni le soleil, ni la lune, ni les
étoiles, mais à l'aide de ces mille oreilles, et de ces deux milles
yeux, il surveille le monde <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243.md)."

His beneficent activities might seem to afford a meeting ground with the
Vegetation goods--"Il donne l'accroissement, il donne l'abondance, il
donne les troupeaux, il donne la progéniture et la vie <span
id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_244.md)."

This summary may aptly be compared with the lament for Tammuz, quoted in
Chapter 3.

But the worship of Mithra in the form in which it spread throughout the
Roman Empire, Mithra as the god of the Imperial armies, the deity
beloved of the Roman legionary, was in no sense of this concrete and
material type.

This is how Cumont sums up the main features. Mithra is the Mediator,
who stands between "le Dieu inaccessible, et inconnaissable, qui règne
dans les sphères éthérées, et le genre humain qui s'agite ici-bas."--"Il
est le Logos émané de Dieu, et participant à sa toute puissance, qui
après avoir formé le monde comme démiurge continue à veiller sur lui."
The initiates must practice a strict chastity--"La résistance à la
sensualité était un des aspects du combat contre le

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

principe du mal--le dualisme Mithraique servait de fondement à une
morale très pure et très efficace <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_245.md)."

Finally, Mithraism taught the resurrection of the body--Mithra will
descend upon earth, and will revive all men. All will issue from their
graves, resume their former appearance and recognize each other. All
will be united in one great assembly, and the good will be separated
from the evil. Then in one supreme sacrifice Mithra will immolate the
divine bull, and mixing its fat with the consecrated wine will offer to
the righteous the cup of Eternal Life <span
id="fr_246"></span>[2](#fn_246.md).

The final parallel with the Messianic Feast described in Chapter 9 is
too striking to be overlooked.

The celestial nature of the deity is also well brought out in the
curious text edited by Dieterich from the great Magic Papyrus of the
Bibliothèque Nationale, and referred to in a previous chapter. This text
purports to be a formula of initiation, and we find the aspirant
ascending through the Seven Heavenly Spheres, to be finally met by
Mithra who brings him to the presence of God. So in the Mithraic temples
we find seven ladders, the ascent of which by the Initiate typified his
passage to the seventh and supreme Heaven <span
id="fr_247"></span>[3](#fn_247.md).

Bousset points out that the original idea was that of three Heavens
above which was Paradise; the conception of Seven Heavens, ruled by the
seven Planets, which we find in Mithraism, is due to the influence of
Babylonian sidereal cults <span id="fr_248"></span>[4](#fn_248.md).

There is thus a marked difference between the two initiations;

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

the Attis initiate dies, is possibly buried, and revives with his god;
the Mithra initiate rises direct to the celestial sphere, where he is
met and welcomed by his god. There is here no evidence of the death and
resurrection of the deity.

What then is the point of contact between the cults that brought them
into such close and intimate relationship?

I think it must be sought in the higher teaching, which, under widely
differing external mediums, included elements common to both. In both
cults the final aim was the attainment of spiritual and eternal life.
Moreover, both possessed essential features which admitted, if they did
not encourage, an assimilation with Christianity. Both of them, if
forced to yield ground to their powerful rival, could, with a fair show
of reason, claim that they had been not vanquished, but fulfilled, that
their teaching had, in Christianity, attained its normal term.

The extracts given above will show the striking analogy between the
higher doctrine of Mithraism, and the fundamental teaching of its great
rival, a resemblance that was fully admitted, and which became the
subject of heated polemic. Greek philosophers did not hesitate to
establish a parallel entirely favourable to Mithraism, while Christian
apologists insisted that such resemblances were the work of the Devil, a
line of argument which, as we have seen above, they had already adopted
with regard to the older Mysteries. It is a matter of historical fact
that at one moment the religious fate of the West hung in the balance,
and it was an open question whether Mithraism or Christianity would be
the dominant Creed <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md).

On the other hand we have also seen that certainly one early Christian
sect, the Naassenes, while equally regarding the Logos as the centre of
their belief, held the equivalent deity to be Attis, and frequented the
Phrygian Mysteries as

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

the most direct source of spiritual enlightenment, while the teaching as
to the Death and Resurrection of the god, and the celebration of a
Mystic Feast, in which the worshippers partook of the Food and Drink of
Eternal Life, offered parallels to Christian doctrine and practice to
the full as striking as any to be found in the Persian faith.

I would therefore submit that it was rather through the medium of their
inner, Esoteric, teaching, that the two faiths, so different in their
external practice, preserved so close and intimate a connection and
that, by the medium of that same Esoteric teaching, both alike came into
contact with Christianity, and, in the case of the Phrygian cult, could,
and actually did, claim identity with it.

Baudissin in his work above referred to suggests that the Adonis cult
owed its popularity to its higher, rather than to its lower, elements,
to its suggestion of ever-renewing life, rather than to the satisfaction
of physical desire to be found in it <span
id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_250.md). Later evidence seems to prove that he
judged correctly.

We may also note that the Attis Mysteries were utilized by the priests
of Mithra for the initiation of women who were originally excluded from
the cult of the Persian god. Cumont remarks that this, an absolute rule
in the Western communities, seems to have had exceptions in the
Eastern <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_251.md). Is it possible that the
passage quoted in the previous chapter, in which Perceval is informed
that no woman may speak of the Grail, is due to contamination with the
Mithra worship? It does not appear to be in harmony with the prominent
position assigned to women in the Grail ritual, the introduction of a
female Grail messenger, or the fact that (with the exception of Merlin
in the Borron text) it is invariably a maiden who directs the hero on
his road to the Grail castle, or reproaches him for his failure there.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

But there is little doubt that, separately, or in conjunction, both
cults travelled to the furthest borders of the Roman Empire. The medium
of transmission is very fully discussed by Cumont in both of the works
referred to. The channel appears to have been three-fold. First,
commercial, through the medium of Syrian merchants. As ardently
religious as practically business-like, the Syrians introduced their
native deities wherever they penetrated, "founding their chapels at the
same time as their counting-houses <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md)."

Secondly, there was social penetration--by means of the Asiatic slaves,
who formed a part of most Roman households, and the State *employés*,
such as officers of customs, army paymasters, etc., largely recruited
from Oriental sources.

Thirdly, and most important, were the soldiers, the foreign legions,
who, drawn mostly from the Eastern parts of the Empire, brought their
native deities with them. Cumont signalizes as the most active agents of
the dispersion of the cult of Mithra, Soldiers, Slaves, and
Merchants <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md).

As far North as Hadrian's Dyke there has been found an inscription in
verse in honour of the goddess of Hierapolis, the author a prefect,
probably, Cumont remarks, the officer of a cohort of Hamii, stationed in
this distant spot. Dedications to Melkart and Astarte have been found at
Corbridge near Newcastle. The Mithraic remains are practically confined
to garrison centres, London, York, Chester, Caerleon-on-Usk, and along
Hadrian's Dyke <span id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_254.md). From the highly
interesting map attached to the Study, giving the sites of ascertained
Mithraic remains, there seems to have been such a centre in
Pembrokeshire.

Now in view of all this evidence is it not at least possible that the
higher form of the Attis cult, that in which it was

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

known and practised by early Gnostic Christians, may have been known in
Great Britain? Scholars have been struck by the curiously unorthodox
tone of the Grail romances, their apparent insistence on a succession
quite other than the accredited Apostolic tradition, and yet, according
to the writers, directly received from Christ Himself. The late M.
Paulin Paris believed that the source of this peculiar feature was to be
found in the struggle for independence of the early British Church; but,
after all, the differences of that Church with Rome affected only minor
points of discipline: the date of Easter, the fashion of tonsure of the
clergy, nothing which touched vital doctrines of the Faith. Certainly
the British Church never claimed the possession of a revelation *à
part*. But if the theory based upon the evidence of the Naassene
document be accepted such a presentation can be well accounted for.
According to Hippolytus the doctrines of the sect were derived from
James, the brother of Our Lord, and Clement of Alexandria asserts that
"The Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, to John and to Peter,
after His Resurrection; these delivered it to the rest of the Apostles,
and they to the Seventy <span id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md)." Thus the
theory proposed in these pages will account not only for the undeniable
parallels existing between the Vegetation cults and the Grail romances,
but also for the Heterodox colouring of the latter, two elements which
at first sight would appear to be wholly unconnected, and quite
incapable of relation to a common source.

Nor in view of the persistent vitality and survival, even to our own
day, of the Exoteric practices can there be anything improbable in the
hypothesis of a late survival of the Esoteric side of the ritual. Cumont
points out that the worship of Mithra was practised in the fifth century
in certain remote cantons of the Alps and the Vosges--*i.e.*, at the

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

date historically assigned to King Arthur. Thus it would not be in any
way surprising if a tradition of the survival of these semi-Christian
rites at this period also existed <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256.md).
In my opinion it is the tradition of such a survival which lies at the
root, and explains the confused imagery, of the text we know as the
*Elucidation*. I have already, in my short study of the subject, set
forth my views; as I have since found further reasons for maintaining
the correctness of the solution proposed, I will repeat it here <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257.md)

The text in question is found in three of our existing Grail versions:
in the MS. of Mons; in the printed edition of 1530; and in the German
translation of Wisse-Colin. It is now prefixed to the poem of Chrétien
de Troyes, but obviously, from the content, had originally nothing to do
with that version.

It opens with the passage quoted above ([p. 130](frr13.htm#page_130).md) in
which Master Blihis utters his solemn warning against revealing the
secret of the Grail. It goes on to tell how aforetime there were maidens
dwelling in the hills <span id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_258.md) who brought
forth to the passing traveller food and drink. But King Amangons
outraged one of these maidens, and took away from her her golden Cup:

"*Des puceles une esforcha  
Et la coupe d'or li toli*-- <span id="fr_259"></span>[4](#fn_259.md)."

His knights, when they saw their lord act thus, followed his evil
example, forced the fairest of the maidens, and

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

robbed them of their cups of gold. As a result the springs dried up, the
land became waste, and the court of the Rich Fisher, which had filled
the land with plenty, could no longer be found.

For 1000 years the land lies waste, till, in the days of King Arthur,
his knights find maidens wandering in the woods, each with her attendant
knight. They joust, and one, Blihos-Bliheris, vanquished by Gawain,
comes to court and tells how these maidens are the descendants of those
ravished by King Amangons and his men, and how, could the court of the
Fisher King, and the Grail, once more be found, the land would again
become fertile. Blihos-Bliheris is, we are told, so entrancing a
story-teller that none at court could ever weary of listening to his
words.

The natural result, which here does not immediately concern us, was that
Arthur's knights undertook the quest, and Gawain achieved it. Now at
first sight this account appears to be nothing but a fantastic
fairy-tale (as such Professor Brown obviously regarded it), and although
the late Dr Sebastian Evans attempted in all seriousness to find a
historical basis for the story in the events which provoked the
pronouncement of the Papal Interdict upon the realm of King John, and
the consequent deprivation of the Sacraments, I am not aware that anyone
took the solution seriously. Yet, on the basis of the theory now set
forth, is it not possible that there may be a real foundation of
historical fact at the root of this wildly picturesque tale? May it not
be simply a poetical version of the disappearance from the land of
Britain of the open performance of an ancient Nature ritual? A ritual
that lingered on in the hills and mountains of Wales as the Mithra
worship did in the Alps and Vosges, celebrated as that cult habitually
was, in natural caverns, and mountain hollows? That it records the
outrage offered by some, probably local, chieftain to a

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

priestess of the cult, an evil example followed by his men, and the
subsequent cessation of the public celebration of the rites, a cessation
which in the folk-belief would certainly be held sufficient to account
for any subsequent drought that might affect the land? But the ritual,
in its higher, esoteric, form was still secretly observed, and the
tradition, alike of its disappearance as a public cult, and of its
persistence in some carefully hidden strong-hold, was handed on in the
families of those who had been, perhaps still were, officiants of these
rites.

That among the handers on of the torch would be the descendants of the
outraged maidens, is most probable.

The sense of mystery, of a real danger to be faced, of an overwhelming
Spiritual gain to be won, were of the essential nature of the tale. It
was the very mystery of Life which lay beneath the picturesque
wrappings; small wonder that the Quest of the Grail became the synonym
for the highest achievement that could be set before men, and that when
the romantic evolution of the Arthurian tradition reached its term, this
supreme adventure was swept within the magic circle. The knowledge of
the Grail was the utmost man could achieve, Arthur's knights were the
very flower of manhood, it was fitting that to them the supreme test be
offered. That the man who first told the story, and boldly, as befitted
a born teller of tales, wedded it the Arthurian legend, was himself
connected by descent with the ancient Faith, himself actually held the
Secret of the Grail, and told, in purposely romantic form, that of which
he knew, I am firmly convinced, nor do I think that the time is far
distant when the missing links will be in our hand, and we shall be able
to weld once more the golden chain which connects Ancient Ritual with
Medieval Romance.
