# CHAPTER II

### THE TASK OF THE HERO

As a first step towards the successful prosecution of an investigation
into the true nature and character of the mysterious object we know as
the Grail it will be well to ask ourselves whether any light may be
thrown upon the subject by examining more closely the details of the
Quest in its varying forms; *i.e.*, what was the precise character of
the task undertaken by, or imposed upon, the Grail hero, whether that
hero were Gawain, Perceval, or Galahad, and what the results to be
expected from a successful achievement of the task. We shall find at
once a uniformity which assures us of the essential identity of the
tradition underlying the varying forms, and a diversity indicating that
the tradition has undergone a gradual, but radical, modification in the
process of literary evolution. Taken in their relative order the
versions give the following result.

GAWAIN (*Bleheris*). Here the hero sets out on his journey with no clear
idea of the task before him. He is taking the place of a knight
mysteriously slain in his company, but whither he rides, and why, he
does not know, only that the business is important and pressing. From
the records of his partial success we gather that he ought to have
enquired concerning the nature of the Grail, and that this enquiry would
have resulted in the restoration to fruitfulness of a Waste Land, the
desolation of which is, in some manner, not clearly explained, connected
with the death of a knight whose name and identity are never disclosed.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Great is the loss that ye lie thus, 'tis even
the destruction of kingdoms, God grant that ye be avenged, so that the
folk be once more joyful and the land repeopled which by ye and this
sword are wasted and made void <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)." The
fact that Gawain does ask concerning the Lance assures the partial
restoration of the land; I would draw attention to the special terms in
which this is described: "for so soon as Sir Gawain asked of the
Lance...the waters flowed again thro' their channel, and all the woods
were turned to verdure <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)."

Diû Crône. Here the question is more general in character; it affects
the marvels beheld, not the Grail alone; but now the Quester is
prepared, and knows what is expected of him. The result is to break the
spell which retains the Grail King in a semblance of life, and we learn,
by implication, that the land is restored to fruitfulness: "yet had the
land been waste, but by his coming had folk and land alike been
delivered <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)." Thus in the earliest
preserved, the GAWAIN form, the effect upon the land appears to be the
primary result of the Quest.

PERCEVAL. The *Perceval* versions, which form the bulk of the existing
Grail texts, differ considerably the one from the other, alike in the
task to be achieved, and the effects resulting from the hero's success,
or failure. The distinctive feature of the Perceval version is the
insistence upon the sickness, and disability of the ruler of the land,
the Fisher King. Regarded first as the direct cause of the wasting of
the land, it gradually assumes overwhelming importance, the task of the
Quester becomes that of healing the King, the restoration of the land
not only falls into the background but the operating cause of its
desolation is changed, and

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

finally it disappears from the story altogether. One version, alone, the
source of which is, at present, undetermined, links the PERCEVAL with
the GAWAIN form; this is the version preserved in the Gerbert
continuation of the *Perceval* of Chrétien de Troyes. Here the hero
having, like Gawain, partially achieved the task, but again like Gawain,
having failed satisfactorily to resolder the broken sword, wakes, like
the earlier hero, to find that the Grail Castle has disappeared, and he
is alone in a flowery meadow. He pursues his way through a land fertile,
and well-peopled and marvels much, for the day before it had been a
waste desert. Coming to a castle he is received by a solemn procession,
with great rejoicing; through him the folk have regained the land and
goods which they had lost. The mistress of the castle is more explicit.
Perceval had asked concerning the Grail:

 "par coi amendé  
Somes, en si faite maniére  
Qu'en ceste regne n'avoit riviére  
Qui ne fust gaste, ne fontaine.  
E la terre gaste et soutaine."

Like Gawain he has 'freed the waters' and thus restored the land <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md).

In the prose *Perceval* the *motif* of the Waste Land has disappeared,
the task of the hero consists in asking concerning the Grail, and by so
doing, to restore the Fisher King, who is suffering from extreme old
age, to health, and youth <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md).

"Se tu eusses demandé quel'en on faisoit, que li rois ton aiol fust
gariz de l'enfermetez qu'il a, et fust revenu en sa juventé."

When the question has been asked: "Le rois péschéor estoit gariz et tot
muez de sa nature." "Li rois peschiére estoit mués de se nature et
estoit garis de se maladie, et

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

estoit sains comme pissons. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)" Here we
have the introduction of a new element, the restoration to youth of the
sick King.

In the *Perceval* of Chrétien de Troyes we find ourselves in presence of
certain definite changes, neither slight, nor unimportant, upon which it
seems to me insufficient stress has hitherto been laid. The question is
changed; the hero no longer asks what the Grail is, but (as in the prose
*Perceval*) whom it serves? a departure from an essential and primitive
simplicity--the motive for which is apparent in Chrétien, but not in the
prose form, where there is no enigmatic personality to be served apart.
A far more important change is that, while the malady of the Fisher King
is antecedent to the hero's visit, and capable of cure if the question
be asked, the failure to fulfil the prescribed conditions of itself
entails disaster upon the land. Thus the sickness of the King, and the
desolation of the land, are not necessarily connected as cause and
effect, but, a point which seems hitherto unaccountably to have been
overlooked, the latter is directly attributable to the Quester
himself <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md).

"Car se tu demandé l'eusses  
Li rice roi qui moult s'esmaie  
Fust or tost garis de sa plaie  
Et si tenist sa tière en pais  
Dont il n'en tenra point jamais,"

\[paragraph continues\] but by Perceval's failure to ask the question he
has entailed dire misfortune upon the land:

"Dames en perdront lor maris,  
Tiéres en seront essiliés,  
Et pucielles desconselliés  
Orfenes, veves, en remanront  
Et maint chevalier en morront. <span id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md)"

 

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

This idea, that the misfortunes of the land are not antecedent to, but
dependent upon, the hero's abortive visit to the Grail Castle, is
carried still further by the compiler of the *Perlesvaus*, where the
failure of the predestined hero to ask concerning the office of the
Grail is alone responsible for the illness of the King and the
misfortunes of the country. "Une grans dolors est avenue an terre
novelement par un jeune chevalier qui fu herbergiez an l'ostel au riche
roi Peschéor, si aparut à lui li saintimes Graaus, et la lance de quoi
li fiers seigne par la poignte; ne demanda de quoi ce servoit, ou dont
ce venoit, et por ce qu'il ne demanda sont toutes les terres comméues an
guerre, ne chevalier n'ancontre autre au forest qu'il ne li core sus, et
ocie s'il peut <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)."

"Li Roi Pecheors de qui est grant dolors, quar il est cheüz en une
douleureuse langour--ceste langour li est venue par celui qui se heberga
an son ostel, à qui li seintimes Graaus s'aparut, por ce que cil ne vost
demander de qu'il an servoit, toutes les terres an furent comméues en
gerre <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md)."

"Je suis cheüz an langour dès cele oure que li chevaliers se herberga
çoianz dont vous avez oï parler; par un soule parole que il déloia a
dire me vint ceste langour <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md)."

From this cause the Fisher King dies before the hero has achieved the
task, and can take his place. "Li bons Rois Peschiéres est morz <span
id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11.md)." There is here no cure of the King or
restoration of the land, the specific task of the Grail hero is never
accomplished, he comes into his kingdom as the result of a number of
knightly adventures, neither more nor less significant than those found
in non-Grail romances.

The *Perlesvaus*, in its present form, appears to be a later, and more
fully developed, treatment of the *motif* noted in Chrétien, *i.e.*,
that the misfortunes of King and country are

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

directly due to the Quester himself, and had no antecedent existence;
this, I would submit, alters the whole character of the story, and we
are at a loss to know what, had the hero put the question on the
occasion of his first visit, could possibly have been the result
achieved. It would not have been the cure of the King: he was,
apparently, in perfect health; it would not have been the restoration to
verdure of the Land: the Land was not Waste; where, as in the case of
Gawain, there is a Dead Knight, whose death is to be avenged,
*something* might have been achieved, in the case of the overwhelming
majority of the *Perceval* versions, which do not contain this feature,
the dependence of the Curse upon the Quester reduces the story to
incoherence. In one *Perceval* version alone do we find a *motif*
analogous to the earlier *Gawain Bleheris* form. In Manessier the hero's
task is not restricted to the simple asking of a question, but he must
also slay the enemy whose treachery has caused the death of the Fisher
King's brother; thereby healing the wound of the King himself, and
removing the woes of the land. What these may be we are not told, but,
apparently, the country is not 'Waste. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)'

In *Peredur* we have a version closely agreeing with that of Chrétien;
the hero fails to enquire the meaning of what he sees in the Castle of
Wonders, and is told in consequence: "Hadst thou done so the King would
have been restored to health, and his dominions to peace, whereas from
henceforth he will have to endure battles and conflicts, and his knights
will perish, and wives will be widowed, and maidens will be left
portionless, and all this because of thee <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)." This certainly seems to imply that,
while the illness of the Fisher King may be antecedent to, and
independent of, the visit and failure of the hero, the misfortunes which
fall on the land have been directly caused thereby.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The conclusion which states that the Bleeding Head seen by the hero "was
thy cousin's, and he was killed by the Sorceresses of Gloucester, who
also lamed thine uncle--and there is a prediction that thou art to
avenge these things--" would seem to indicate the presence in the
original of a 'Vengeance' theme, such as that referred to above <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md).

In *Parzival* the stress is laid entirely on the sufferings of the King;
the question has been modified in the interests of this theme, and here
assumes the form "What aileth thee, mine uncle?" The blame bestowed upon
the hero is solely on account of the prolonged sorrow his silence has
inflicted on King and people; of a Land laid Waste, either through
drought, or war, there is no mention.

"Iuch solt' iur wirt erbarmet hân,  
An dem Got wunder hât getân,  
Und het gevrâget sîner nôt,  
Ir lebet, und sît an saelden tôt <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)."

"Dô der trûrege vischaere  
Saz âne fröude und âne trôst  
War umb' iren niht siufzens hât erlôst <span
id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md)."

The punishment falls on the hero who has failed to put the question,
rather than on the land, which, indeed, appears to be in no way
affected, either by the wound of the King, or the silence of the hero.
The divergence from Chrétien's version is here very marked, and, so far,
seems to have been neglected by critics. The point is also of importance
in view of the curious parallels which are otherwise to be found between
this version and *Perlesvaus*; here the two are in marked contradiction
with one another.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

The question finally asked, the result is, as indicated in the prose
version, the restoration of the King not merely to health, but also to
youth--

"Swaz der Frânzoys heizet flô'rî'  
Der glast kom sinem velle bî,  
Parzival's schoen' was nu ein wint;  
Und Absalôn Dâvîdes kint,  
Von Askalûn Vergulaht  
Und al den schoene was geslaht,  
Und des man Gahmurete jach  
Dô man'n in zogen sach  
Ze Kanvoleis sô wünneclîch,  
Ir dechéines schoen' was der gelîch,  
Die Anfortas ûz siecheit truoc.  
Got noch künste kan genuoc <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)."

GALAHAD. In the final form assumed by the story, that preserved in the
*Queste*, the achievement of the task is not preceded by any failure on
the part of the hero, and the advantages derived therefrom are personal
and spiritual, though we are incidentally told that he heals the Fisher
King's father, and also the old King, Mordrains, whose life has been
preternaturally prolonged. In the case of this latter it is to be noted
that the mere fact of Galahad's being the predestined winner suffices,
and the healing takes place *before* the Quest is definitely achieved.

There is no Waste Land, and the wounding of the two Kings is entirely
unconnected with Galahad. We find hints, in the story of Lambar, of a
knowledge of the earlier form, but for all practical purposes it has
disappeared from the story <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md).

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Analysing the above statements we find that the results may be grouped
under certain definite headings:

(*a*) There is a general consensus of evidence to the effect that the
main object of the Quest is the restoration to health and vigour of a
King suffering from infirmity caused by wounds, sickness, or old age;

(*b*) and whose infirmity, for some mysterious and unexplained reason,
reacts disastrously upon his kingdom, either depriving it of vegetation,
or exposing it to the ravages of war.

(*c*) In two cases it is definitely stated that the King will be
restored to youthful vigour and beauty.

(*d*) In both cases where we find Gawain as the hero of the story, and
in one connected with Perceval, the misfortune which has fallen upon the
country is that of a prolonged drought, which has destroyed vegetation,
and left the land Waste; the effect of the hero's question is to restore
the waters to their channel, and render the land once more fertile.

(*e*) In three cases the misfortunes and wasting of the land are the
result of war, and directly caused by the hero's failure to ask the
question; we are not dealing with an antecedent condition. This, in my
opinion, constitutes a marked difference between the two groups, which
has not hitherto received the attention it deserves. One aim of our
present investigation will be to determine which of these two forms
should be considered the elder.

But this much seems certain, the aim of the Grail Quest is two-fold; it
is to benefit (*a*) the King, (*b*) the land. The first of these two is
the more important, as it is the infirmity of the King which entails
misfortune on his land, the condition of the one reacts, for good or
ill, upon the other; how, or why, we are left to discover for ourselves.

Before proceeding further in our investigation

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

it may be well to determine the precise nature of the King's illness,
and see whether any light upon the problem can be thus obtained.

In both the *Gawain* forms the person upon whom the fertility of the
land depends is dead, though, in the version of *Diû Crône* he is, to
all appearance, still in life. It should be noted that in the *Bleheris*
form the king of the castle, who is not referred to as the Fisher King,
is himself hale and sound; the wasting of the land was brought about by
the blow which slew the knight whose body Gawain sees on the bier.

In both the *Perlesvaus*, and the prose *Perceval* the King has simply
'fallen into languishment,' in the first instance, as noted above, on
account of the failure of the Quester, in the second as the result of
extreme old age.

In Chrétien, Manessier, *Peredur*, and the *Parzival*, the King is
suffering from a wound the nature of which, euphemistically disguised in
the French texts, is quite clearly explained in the German <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md).

But the whole position is made absolutely clear by a passage preserved
in *Sone de Nansai* and obviously taken over from an earlier poem. This
romance contains a lengthy section dealing with the history of Joseph
'd'Abarimathie,' who is represented as the patron Saint of the kingdom
of Norway; his bones, with the sacred relics of which he had the charge,
the Grail and the Lance, are preserved in a monastery on an island in
the interior of that country. In this version Joseph himself is the
Fisher King; ensnared by the beauty of the daughter of the Pagan King of
Norway, whom he has slain, he baptizes her, though she is still an
unbeliever at heart, and makes her his wife, thus drawing the wrath of
Heaven upon himself. God punishes him for his sin:

"Es rains et desous l'afola  
De coi grant dolor endura <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md)."

 

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

Then, in a remarkable passage, we are told of the direful result
entailed by this punishment upon his land:

"Sa tierre ert a ce jour nommée  
Lorgres, ch'est verités prouvée,  
Lorgres est uns nons de dolour  
Nommés en larmes et en plours,  
Bien doit iestre en dolour nommés  
Car on n'i seme pois ne blés  
Ne enfes d'omme n'i nasqui  
Ne puchielle n'i ot mari,  
Ne arbres fueille n'i porta  
Ne nus prés n'i raverdïa,  
Ne nus oysiaus n'i ot naon  
Ne se n'i ot beste faon,  
Tant que li rois fu mehaigniés  
Et qu'il fu fors de ses pechiés,  
Car Jesu-Crist fourment pesa  
Qu'à la mescréant habita <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)."

Now there can be no possible doubt here, the condition of the King is
sympathetically reflected on the land, the loss of virility in the one
brings about a suspension of the reproductive processes of Nature on the
other. The same effect would naturally be the result of the death of the
sovereign upon whose vitality these processes depended.

To sum up the result of the analysis, I hold that we have solid grounds
for the belief that the story postulates a close connection between the
vitality of a certain King, and the prosperity of his kingdom; the
forces of the ruler being weakened or destroyed, by wound, sickness, old
age, or death, the land becomes Waste, and the task of the hero is that
of restoration <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md).

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

It seems to me, then, that, if we desire to elucidate the perplexing
mystery of the Grail romances, and to place the criticism of this
important and singularly fascinating body of literature upon an assured
basis, we shall do so most effectually by pursuing a line of
investigation which will concentrate upon the persistent elements of the
story, the character and significance of the achievement proposed,
rather than upon the varying details, such as Grail and Lance, however
important may be their *rôle*. If we can ascertain, accurately, and
unmistakably, the meaning of the whole, we shall, I think, find less
difficulty in determining the character and office of the parts, in
fact, the question *solvitur ambulando*, the 'complex' of the problem
being solved, the constituent elements will reveal their significance.

As a first step I propose to ask whether this 'Quest of the Grail'
represents an isolated, and unique achievement, or whether the task
allotted to the hero, Gawain, Perceval, or Galahad, is one that has been
undertaken, and carried out by heroes of other ages, and other lands. In
the process of our investigation we must retrace our steps and turn back
to the early traditions of our Aryan forefathers, and see whether we
cannot, even in that remote antiquity, lay our hand upon a clue, which,
like the fabled thread of Ariadne, shall serve as guide through the
mazes of a varying, yet curiously persistent, tradition.
