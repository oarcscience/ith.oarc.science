# CHAPTER V

### MEDIEVAL AND MODERN FORMS OF NATURE RITUAL

Readers of the foregoing pages may, not improbably, object that, while
we have instanced certain curious and isolated parallels from early
Aryan literature and tradition, and, what, from the point of view of
declared intention, appears to be a kindred group of religious belief
and practice in pre-Historic and Classical times, the two, so far, show
no direct signs of affiliation, while both may be held to be far
removed, in point of date, alike from one another, and from the romantic
literature of the twelfth century.

This objection is sound in itself, but if we can show by modern
parallels that the ideas which took form and shape in early Aryan Drama,
and Babylonian and Classic Ritual, not only survive to our day, but are
found in combination with features corresponding minutely with details
recorded in early Aryan literature, we may hold the gulf to be bridged,
and the common origin, and close relationship, of the different stages
to be an ascertained fact. At the outset, and before examining the
evidence collected by scholars, I would remind my readers that the
modern Greeks have retained, in many instances under changed names, no
inconsiderable portion of their ancient mythological beliefs, among them
the 'Adonis' celebrations; the 'Gardens of Adonis' blossom and fade
to-day, as they did many centuries ago, and I have myself spoken with a
scholar who has

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

seen 'women, at the door of their houses, weeping for Adonis <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md).'

For evidence of the widespread character of Medieval and Modern
survivals we have only to consult the epoch-making works of Mannhardt,
*Wald und Feld-Kulte*, and Frazer, *The Golden Bough* <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md); in the pages of these volumes we shall
find more than sufficient for our purpose. From the wealth of
illustration with which these works abound I have selected merely such
instances as seem to apply more directly to the subject of our
investigation <span id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69.md).

Thus, in many places, it is still the custom to carry a figure
representing the Vegetation Spirit on a bier, attended by mourning
women, and either bury the figure, throw it into water (as a rain
charm), or, after a mock death, carry the revivified Deity, with
rejoicing, back to the town. Thus in the Lechrain a man in black women's
clothes is borne on a bier, followed by men dressed as professional
women mourners making lamentation, thrown on the village dung-heap,
drenched with water, and buried in straw <span
id="fr_70"></span>[4](#fn_70.md).

In Russia the Vegetation or Year Spirit is known as Yarilo <span
id="fr_71"></span>[5](#fn_71.md), and is represented by a doll with phallic
attributes, which is enclosed in a coffin, and carried through the
streets to the accompaniment of lamentation by women whose emotions have
been excited by drink. Mannhardt gives the lament as follows: "Wessen
war Er schuldig? Er war so gut! Er wird nicht mehr aufstehen! O! Wie
sollen wir uns von Dir trennen? Was ist das Leben wenn

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Du nicht mehr da bist? Erhebe Dich, wenn auch
nur auf ein Stündchen! Aber Er steht nicht auf, Er steht nicht auf <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md)!"

In other forms of the ritual, we find distinct traces of the
resuscitation of the Vegetation Deity, occasionally accompanied by
evidence of rejuvenation. Thus, in Lausitz, on Laetare Sunday (the 4th
Sunday in Lent), women with mourning veils carry a straw figure, dressed
in a man's shirt, to the bounds of the next village, where they tear the
effigy to pieces, hang the shirt on a young and flourishing tree,
"schöne Wald-Baum," which they proceed to cut down, and carry home with
every sign of rejoicing. Here evidently the young tree is regarded as a
rejuvenation of the person represented in the first instance by the
straw figure <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md).

In many parts of Europe to-day the corresponding ceremonies, very
generally held at Whitsuntide, include the mock execution of the
individual representing the Vegetation Spirit, frequently known as the
King of the May. In Bohemia the person playing the *rôle* of the King
is, with his attendants, dressed in bark, and decked with garlands of
flowers; at the conclusion of the ceremonies the King is allowed a short
start, and is then pursued by the armed attendants. If he is not
overtaken he holds office for a year, but if overtaken, he suffers a
mock decapitation, head-dress, or crown, being struck off, and the
pretended corpse is then borne on a bier to the next village <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md).

Mannhardt, discussing this point, remarks that in the mock execution we
must recognize "Ein verbreiteter und jedenfalls uralter Gebrauch." He
enumerates the various modes of death, shooting, stabbing (in the latter
case a bladder filled with blood, and concealed under the clothes, is
pierced); in Bohemia, decapitation, occasionally drowning (which
primarily represents a rain charm), is the form

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

adopted <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md). He then goes on to remark
that this ceremonial death must have been generally followed by
resuscitation, as in Thuringia, where the 'Wild Man,' as the central
figure is there named, is brought to life again by the Doctor, while the
survival, in the more elaborate Spring processions of this latter
character, even where he plays no special *rôle*, points to the fact
that his part in the proceedings was originally a more important one.

That Mannhardt was not mistaken is proved by the evidence of the kindred
Dances, a subject we shall consider later; there we shall find the
Doctor playing his old-time *rôle*, and restoring to life the slain
representative of the Vegetation Spirit <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md). The character of the Doctor, or Medicine
Man, formed, as I believe, at one time, no unimportant link in the chain
which connects these practices with the Grail tradition.

The signification of the resuscitation ceremony is obscured in cases
where the same figure undergoes death and revival without any
corresponding change of form. This point did not escape Mannhardt's
acute critical eye; he remarks that, in cases where, *e.g.*, in Swabia,
the 'King' is described as "ein armer alter Mann," who has lived seven
years in the woods (the seven winter months), a scene of rejuvenation
should follow--"diese scheint meistenteils verloren gegangen; doch
vielleicht *scheint* es nur so." He goes on to draw attention to the
practice in Reideberg, bei Halle, where, after burying a straw figure,
called the Old Man, the villagers dance round the May-Pole, and he
suggests that the 'Old Man' represents the defunct Vegetation Spirit,
the May Tree, that Spirit resuscitated, and refers in this connection to
the "durchaus verwandten Asiatischen Gebrauchen des Attis, und
Adonis-Kultus <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md)."

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

The foregoing evidence offers, I think, sufficient proof of the, now
generally admitted, relationship between Classical, Medieval, and Modern
forms of Nature ritual.

But what of the relation to early Aryan practice? Can that, also, be
proved?

In this connection I would draw attention to Chapter 17 of *Mysterium
und Mimus*, entitled, *Ein Volkstümlicher Umzug beim Soma-Fest*. Here
Professor von Schroeder discusses the real meaning and significance of a
very curious little poem (*Rig-Veda*, 9. 112); the title by which it is
generally known, *Alles lauft nach Geld*, does not, at first sight, fit
the content of the verse, and the suggestion of scholars who have seen
in it a humorous enumeration of different trades and handicrafts does
not explain the fact that the Frog and the Horse appear in it.

To Professor von Schroeder belongs the credit of having discovered that
the *personnel* of the poem corresponds with extraordinary exactitude to
the Figures of the Spring and Summer 'Fertility-exciting' processions,
described with such fulness of detail by Mannhardt. Especially is this
the case with the Whitsuntide procession at Värdegötzen, in Hanover,
where we find the group of phallic and fertility demons, who, on Prof.
von Schroeder's hypothesis, figure in the song, in concrete, and actual
form <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md). The Vegetation Spirit appears
in the song as an Old Man, while his female counterpart, an Old Woman,
is described as 'filling the hand-mill.' Prof. von Schroeder points out
that in some

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

parts of Russia the 'Baba-jaga' as the Corn Mother is called, is an Old
Woman, who flies through the air in a hand-mill. The Doctor, to whom we
have referred above, is mentioned twice in the four verses composing the
song; he was evidently regarded as an important figure; while the whole
is put into the mouth of a 'Singer' evidently the Spokesman of the
party, who proclaims their object, "Verschiednes könnend suchen wir Gute
Dinge," *i.e.*, gifts in money and kind, as such folk processions do
to-day.

The whole study is of extraordinary interest for Folk-lore students, and
so far as our especial investigation is concerned it seems to me to
supply the necessary proof of the identity, and persistence, of Aryan
folk-custom and tradition.

A very important modification of the root idea, and one which appears to
have a direct bearing on the sources of the Grail tradition, was that by
which, among certain peoples, the *rôle* of the god, his responsibility
for providing the requisite rain upon which the fertility of the land,
and the life of the folk, depended, was combined with that of the King.

This was the case among the Celts; McCulloch, in *The Religion of the
Celts*, discussing the question of the early Irish *geasa* or taboo,
explains the *geasa* of the Irish kings as designed to promote the
welfare of the tribe, the making of rain and sunshine on which their
prosperity depended. "Their observance made the earth fruitful, produced
abundance and prosperity, and kept both the king and his land from
misfortune. The Kings were divinities on whom depended fruitfulness and
plenty, and who must therefore submit to obey their '*geasa* <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md).'"

The same idea seems to have prevailed in early Greece; Mr A. B. Cook, in
his studies on *The European Sky-God*,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

remarks that the king in early Greece was regarded as the representative
of Zeus: his duties could be satisfactorily discharged only by a man who
was perfect, and without blemish, *i.e.*, by a man in the prime of life,
suffering from no defect of body, or mind; he quotes in illustration the
speech of Odysseus (*Od*. 19. 109 ff.). "'Even as a king without
blemish, who ruleth god-fearing over many mighty men, and maintaineth
justice, while the black earth beareth wheat and barley, and the trees
are laden with fruit, and the flocks bring forth without fail, and the
sea yieldeth fish by reason of his good rule, and the folk prosper
beneath him.' The king who is without blemish has a flourishing kingdom,
the king who is maimed has a kingdom diseased like himself, thus the
Spartans were warned by an oracle to beware of a 'lame reign <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md).'"

A most remarkable modern survival of this idea is recorded by Dr Frazer
in the latest edition of *The Golden Bough* <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md), and is so complete and suggestive that I
make no apology for transcribing it at some length. The Shilluk, an
African tribe, inhabit the banks of the White Nile, their territory
extending on the west bank from Kaka in the north, to Lake No in the
south, on the east bank from Fashoda to Taufikia, and some 35 miles up
the Sohat river. Numbering some 40,000 in all, they are a pastoral
people, their wealth consisting in flocks and herds, grain and millet.
The King resides at Fashoda, and is regarded with extreme reverence, as
being a re-incarnation of Nyakang, the semi-divine hero who settled the
tribe in their present territory. Nyakang is the rain-giver, on whom
their life and prosperity depend; there are several shrines in which
sacred Spears, now kept for sacrificial purposes, are preserved, the
originals, which were the property of Nyakang, having disappeared.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

The King, though regarded with reverence, must not be allowed to become
old or feeble, lest, with the diminishing vigour of the ruler, the
cattle should sicken, and fail to bear increase, the crops should rot in
the field and men die in ever growing numbers. One of the signs of
failing energy is the King's inability to fulfil the desires of his
wives, of whom he has a large number. When this occurs the wives report
the fact to the chiefs, who condemn the King to death forthwith,
communicating the sentence to him by spreading a white cloth over his
face and knees during his mid-day slumber. Formerly the King was starved
to death in a hut, in company with a young maiden but (in consequence,
it is said, of the great vitality and protracted suffering of one King)
this is no longer done; the precise manner of death is difficult to
ascertain; Dr Seligmann, who was Sir J. G. Frazer's authority, thinks
that he is now strangled in a hut, especially erected for that purpose.

At one time he might be attacked and slain by a rival, either of his own
family, or of that of one of the previous Kings, of whom there are many,
but this has long been superseded by the ceremonial slaying of the
monarch who after his death is revered as Nyakang <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md).

This survival is of extraordinary interest; it presents us with a
curiously close parallel to the situation which, on the evidence of the
texts, we have postulated as forming the basic idea of the Grail
tradition--the position of a people whose prosperity, and the fertility
of their land, are closely bound up with the life and virility of their
King, who is not a mere man, but a Divine re-incarnation. If he 'falls
into languishment,' as does the Fisher King in *Perlesvaus*, the land
and its inhabitants will suffer correspondingly; not only

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

will the country suffer from drought, "*Nus près n'i raverdia*," but the
men will die in numbers:

"Dames en perdront lor maris"

we may say; the cattle will cease to bear increase:

"Ne se n'i ot beste faon,"

and the people take drastic steps to bring about a rejuvenation; the old
King dies, to be replaced by a young and vigorous successor, even as
Brons was replaced by Perceval.

Let us now turn back to the preceding chapter, and compare the position
of the people of the Shilluk tribe, and the subjects of the Grail King,
with that of the ancient Babylonians, as set forth in their Lamentations
for Tammuz.

There we find that the absence of the Life-giving deity was followed by
precisely the same disastrous consequences; Vegetation fails--

"The wailing is for the plants; the first lament is they grow not.  
The wailing is for the barley; the ears grow not."

The reproductive energies of the animal kingdom are suspended--

"For the habitation of flocks it is; they produce not.  
For the perishing wedded ones, for perishing children it is; the
dark-headed people create not."

Nor can we evade the full force of the parallel by objecting that we are
here dealing with a god, not with a man; we possess the recorded names
of 'kings who played the *rôle* of Tammuz,' thus even for that early
period the commingling of the two conceptions, god and king, is
definitely established.

Now in face of this group of parallels, whose close correspondence, if
we consider their separation in point of time (3000 B.C.; 1200 A.D.; and
the present day), is nothing short of astonishing, is it not absolutely
and utterly unreasonable to admit (as scholars no longer hesitate to

do) the relationship between the first and last, and exclude, as a mere
literary invention, the intermediate parallel?

The ground for such a denial may be mere prejudice, a reluctance to
renounce a long cherished critical prepossession, but in the face of
this new evidence does it not come perilously close to scientific
dishonesty, to a disregard for that respect for truth in research the
imperative duty of which has been so finely expressed by the late M.
Gaston Paris.--"Je professe absolument et sans réserve cette doctrine,
que la science n'a d'autre objet que la vérité, et la vérité pour
elle-même, sans aucun souci des conséquences, bonnes ou mauvaises,
regrettables ou heureuses, que cette vérité pourrait avoir dans la
pratique <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md)." When we further consider
that behind these three main parallels, linking them together, there
lies a continuous chain of evidence, expressed alike in classical
literature, and surviving Folk practice, I would submit that there is no
longer any shadow of a doubt that in the Grail King we have a romantic
literary version of that strange mysterious figure whose presence hovers
in the shadowy background of the history of our Aryan race; the figure
of a divine or semi-divine ruler, at once god and king, upon whose life,
and unimpaired vitality, the existence of his land and people directly
depends.

And if we once grant this initial fact, and resolve that we will no
longer, in the interests of an outworn critical tradition, deny the
weight of scientific evidence in determining the real significance of
the story, does it not inevitably follow, as a logical sequence, that
such versions as fail to connect the misfortunes of the land directly
with the disability of the king, but make them dependent upon the
failure of the Quester, are, by that very fact, stamped as secondary

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

versions. That by this one detail, of capital importance, they approve
themselves as literary treatments of a traditional theme, the true
meaning of which was unknown to the author?

Let us for a moment consider what the opposite view would entail; that a
story which was originally the outcome of pure literary invention should
in the course of re-modelling have been accidentally brought into close
and detailed correspondence with a deeply rooted sequence of popular
faith and practice is simply inconceivable, the re-modelling, if
re-modelling there were, must have been intentional, the men whose
handiwork it was were in possession of the requisite knowledge.

But how did they possess that knowledge, and why should they undertake
such a task? Surely not from the point of view of antiquarian interest,
as might be done to-day; they were no twelfth century Frazers and
Mannhardts; the subject must have had for them a more living, a more
intimate, interest. And if, in face of the evidence we now possess, we
feel bound to admit the existence of such knowledge, is it not more
reasonable to suppose that the men who first told the story were the men
who *knew*, and that the confusion was due to those who, with more
literary skill, but less first-hand information, re-modelled the
original theme?

In view of the present facts I would submit that the problem posed in
our first chapter may be held to be solved; that we accept as a *fait
acquis* the conclusion that the woes of the land are directly dependent
upon the sickness, or maiming, of the King, and in no wise caused by the
failure of the Quester. The 'Wasting of the land' must be held to have
been antecedent to that failure, and the *Gawain* versions in which we
find this condition fulfilled are, therefore, prior in origin to the
*Perceval*, in which the 'Wasting' is brought about by the action of the
hero; in some versions, indeed, has altogether disappeared from the
story.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Thus the position assigned in the versions to this feature of the Waste
Land becomes one of capital importance as a critical factor. This is a
point which has hitherto escaped the attention of scholars; the
misfortunes of the land have been treated rather as an accident, than as
an essential, of the Grail story, entirely subordinate in interest to
the *dramatis personae* of the tale, or the objects, Lance and Grail,
round which the action revolves. As a matter of fact I believe that the
'Waste Land' is really the very heart of our problem; a rightful
appreciation of its position and significance will place us in
possession of the clue which will lead us safely through the most
bewildering mazes of the fully developed tale.

 

Since the above pages were written Dr Frazer has notified the discovery
of a second African parallel, equally complete, and striking. In
*Folk-Lore* (Vol. XXVI.) he prints, under the title *A Priest-King in
Nigeria*, a communication received from Mr P. A. Talbot, District
Commissioner in S. Nigeria. The writer states that the dominant Ju-Ju of
Elele, a town in the N.W. of the Degema district, is a Priest-King,
elected for a term of seven years. "The whole prosperity of the town,
especially the fruitfulness of farm, byre, and marriage-bed, was linked
with his life. Should he fall sick it entailed famine and grave disaster
upon the inhabitants." So soon as a successor is appointed the former
holder of the dignity is reported to 'die for himself.' Previous to the
introduction of ordered government it is admitted that at any time
during his seven years' term of office the Priest might be put to death
by any man sufficiently strong and resourceful, consequently it is only
on the rarest occasions (in fact only one such is recorded) that the
Ju-Ju ventures to leave his compound. At the same time the riches
derived

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

from the offerings of the people are so considerable that there is never
a lack of candidates for the office.

From this and the evidence cited above it would appear that the
institution was widely spread in Africa, and at the same time it affords
a striking proof in support of the essential soundness of Dr Frazer's
interpretation of the Priest of Nemi, an interpretation which has been
violently attacked in certain quarters, very largely on the ground that
no one would be found willing to accept an office involving such direct
danger to life. The above evidence shows clearly that not only does such
an office exist, but that it is by no means an unpopular post.
