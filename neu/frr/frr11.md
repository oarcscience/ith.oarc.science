# CHAPTER VIII

### THE MEDICINE MAN

In previous chapters I have referred to the part played by the Doctor in
a large number of the surviving 'Fertility' ceremonies, and to the fact,
noted by other writers, that even where an active share is no longer
assigned to the character, he still appears among the *dramatis
personae* of these Folk-plays and processions <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md). We will now examine more closely the
*rôle* allotted to this mysterious personage; we shall find it to be of
extreme antiquity and remarkable significance.

In the interesting and important work by Professor von Schroeder, to
which I have already often referred, we find the translation of a
curious poem (*Rig-Veda*, 10. 97), a monologue placed in the mouth of a
Doctor, or Medicine Man, who vaunts the virtue of his herbs, and their
power to cure human ills <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md). From the
references made to a special sick man von Schroeder infers that this
poem, like others in the collection, was intended to be acted, as well
as recited, and that the personage to be healed, evidently present on
the scene, was probably represented by a dummy, as no speeches are
allotted to the character.

The entire poem consists of 23 verses of four lines each, and is divided
by the translator into three distinct sections; the first is devoted to
the praise of herbs in general, their power to cure the sick man before
them, and at the same

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

time to bring riches to the Healer--the opening verses run:

"Die Kräuter alt, entsprossen einst  
Drei Alter vor den Göttern noch,  
Die braunen will Ich preisen jetzt!  
Hundert und sieben Arten sinds.

"Ja, hundert Arten, Mütterlein,  
Und tausend Zweige habt ihr auch,  
Ihr, die ihr hundert Kräfte habt,  
Macht diesen Menschen mir gesund.

"Ihr Kräuter hört, ihr Mütterchen,  
Ihr göttlichen, das sag ich euch:  
Ross, Rind und Kleid gewänn' ich gern  
Und auch dein Leben, lieber Mann!  
.................................  
Fürwahr ihr bringt mir Rinder ein,  
Wenn ihr ihn rettet diesen Mann."

He then praises the power of all herbs:

"Vom Himmel kam der Kräuter Schar  
Geflogen, und da sprechen sie;  
Wen wir noch lebend treffen an  
Der Mann soll frei von Schaden sein."

Finally the speaker singles out one herb as superior to all others:

"Die Kräuter viel in Soma's Reich  
Die hundertfach verständigen,  
Von denen bist das beste du  
Erfüllst den Wunsch, und heilst das Herz."

He conjures all other herbs to lend their virtue to this special remedy:

"Ihr Kräuter all' in Soma's Reich  
Verbreitet auf der Erde hin,  
Ihr, von B<u>r</u>ihaspati erzeugt,  
Gebt diesem Kraute eure Kraft! <span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

"Nicht nehme Schaden, der euch gräbt,  
Noch der, für Welchen Ich euch grub!  
Bei uns soll Alles, Mensch, und Vieh,  
Gesund und ohne Schaden sein.

"Ihr, die ihr höret dies mein Wort,  
Ihr, die ihr in der Ferne seid,  
Ihr Pflanzen all', vereignet euch,  
Gebt diesem Kraute eure Kraft!"

And the herbs, taking counsel together with Soma their king, answer:

"Für Wen uns ein Brahmane braucht  
Den, König, wollen retten wir,"

a line which throws a light upon the personality of the speaker; he is
obviously a Brahmin, and the Medicine Man here, as elsewhere, unites the
functions of Priest and Healer.

Professor von Schroeder suggests that this Dramatic Monologue formed
part of the ceremonies of a Soma feast, that it is the Soma plant from
which the heavenly drink is brewed which is to be understood as the
first of all herbs and the curer of all ills, and the reference to Soma
as King of the herbs seems to bear out this suggestion.

In a previous chapter <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) I have
referred to a curious little poem, also found in the *Rig-Veda*, and
translated by von Schroeder under the title *A Folk-Procession at a
Soma-Feast*, the *dramatis personae* of the poem offering, as I pointed
out, a most striking and significant parallel to certain surviving
Fertility processions, notably that of Värdegötzen in Hanover. In this
little song which von Schroeder places in the mouth of the leader of the
band of maskers, the Doctor is twice referred to; in the opening lines
we have the Brahmin, the Doctor, the Carpenter, the Smith, given as men
plying different trades, and each and all in search of gain; in the
final verse the speaker announces, "I am a Poet (or

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Singer), my father a Doctor." Thus of the
various trades and personages enumerated the Doctor alone appears twice
over, an indication of the importance attached to this character.

Unfortunately, in view of the fragmentary condition of the survivals of
early Aryan literature, and the lack of explanatory material at our
disposal, it is impossible to decide what was the precise *rôle*
assigned to the 'Medicine Man'; judging from the general character of
the surviving dramatic fragments and the close parallel which exists
between these fragments and the Medieval and Modern Fertility
ceremonies, it seems extremely probable that his original *rôle* was
identical with that assigned to his modern counterpart, *i.e.*, that of
restoring to life or health the slain, or suffering, representative of
the Vegetation Spirit.

This presumption gains additional support from the fact that it is in
this character that the Doctor appears in Greek Classical Drama. Von
Schroeder refers to the fact that the Doctor was a stock figure in the
Greek 'Mimus <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md)' and in Mr Cornford's
interesting volume entitled *The Origin of Attic Comedy*, the author
reckons the Doctor among the stock Masks of the early Greek Theatre, and
assigns to this character the precise *rôle* which later survivals have
led us to attribute to him.

The significance of Mr Cornford's work lies in the fact that, while he
accepts Sir Gilbert Murray's deeply interesting and suggestive theory
that the origins of Greek Tragedy are to be sought in "the Agon of the
Fertility Spirit, his Pathos, and Theophany," he contends that a similar
origin may be postulated for Attic Comedy--that the stock Masks
(characters) agree with a theory of derivation of such Comedy from a
ritual performance celebrating the renewal of the seasons <span
id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_138.md). "They were at first serious, and even
awful, figures in a Religious Mystery, the God who

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

every year is born, and dies, and rises again; his Mother and his Bride;
the Antagonist who kills him; the Medicine Man who restores him to
life <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md)."

I would submit that the presence of such a character in the original
ritual drama of Revival which, on my theory, underlies the romantic form
of the Grail legend, may, in view of the above evidence, and of that
brought forward in the previous chapters, be accepted as at least a
probable hypothesis.

But, it may be objected, granting that the Doctor in these Fertility
processions and dramas represents a genuine survival of a feature of
immemorial antiquity, a survival to be traced alike in Aryan remains, in
Greek literature, and in Medieval ceremony, what is the precise bearing
upon the special subject of our investigations? There is no Doctor in
the Grail legend, although there is certainly abundant scope for his
activities!

There may be no Doctor in the Grail legend to-day, but was there never
such a character? How if this be the key to explain the curious and
persistent attribution of healing skill to so apparently unsuitable a
personage as Sir Gawain? I would draw the attention of my readers to a
passage in the *Perceval* of Chrétien de Troyes, where Gawain, finding a
wounded knight by the roadside, proceeds to treat him:

"Et Mesire Gauvain savoit  
Plus que nuls homs de garir plaie;  
Une herbe voit en une haie  
Trop bonne pour douleur tolir  
De plaie, et il la va cueillir <span id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_140.md)."

 

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Other MSS. are rather fuller:

"Et Messires Gauvain savoit  
Plus que nus hons vivant de plaies,  
Unes herbe voit les une haies  
Qu'il connoissoit lonc temps avoit  
Que son mestre apris li avoit  
Enseigniee et bien moustree,  
Et il l'avoit bien esgardee  
Si l'a molt bien reconneue <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md)."

We find reference to Gawain's possession of medical knowledge elsewhere.
In the poem entitled *Lancelot et le cerf au pied blanc*, Gawain,
finding his friend desperately wounded, carries him to a physician whom
he instructs as to the proper treatment <span
id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md).

"Ende Walewein wiesde den Ersatere mere  
Ene const, die daertoe halp wel sere <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md)."

In the parallel adventure related in *Morien* Gawain heals Lancelot
without the aid of any physician <span id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_144.md):

"Doe was Walewein harde blide  
Ende bant hem sine wonden ten tide  
Met selken crude die daer dochten  
Dat si niet bloden mochten <span id="fr_145"></span>[5](#fn_145.md)."

They ride to an anchorite's cell:

"Si waren doe in dire gedochten  
Mochten sie daer comen tier stont  
Datten Walewein soude maken gesont <span
id="fr_146"></span>[6](#fn_146.md)."

The Dutch *Lancelot* has numerous references to Gawain's skill in
healing. Of course the advocates of the originality of Chrétien de
Troyes will object that these references, though found in poems which
have no connection with

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Chrétien, and which are translations from lost
French originals of an undetermined date, are one and all loans from the
more famous poem. This, however, can hardly be contended of the Welsh
*Triads*; there we find Gwalchmai, the Welsh Gawain, cited as one of the
three men "To whom the nature of every object was known <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md)," an accomplishment exceedingly
necessary for a 'Medicine Man,' but not at first sight especially
needful for the equipment of a knight <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148.md). This persistent attribution of healing
skill is not, so far as my acquaintance with medieval Romance goes,
paralleled in the case of any other knight; even Tristan, who is
probably the most accomplished of heroes of romance, the most thoroughly
trained in all branches of knightly education, is not credited with any
such knowledge. No other knight, save Gawain, has the reputation of a
Healer, yet Gawain, the Maidens' Knight, the 'fair Father of Nurture'
is, at first sight, hardly the personage one might expect to possess
such skill. Why he should be so persistently connected with healing was
for long a problem to me; recently, however, I have begun to suspect
that we have in this apparently motiveless attribution the survival of
an early stage of tradition in which not only did Gawain cure the Grail
King, but he did so, not by means of a question, or by the welding of a
broken sword, but by more obvious and natural means, the administration
of a healing herb. Gawain's character of Healer belongs to him in his
*rôle* of Grail Winner.

Some years ago, in the course of my reading, I came across a passage in
which certain knights of Arthur's court,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

riding through a forest, come upon a herb 'which belonged to the Grail.'
Unfortunately the reference, at the time I met with it, though it struck
me as curious, did not possess any special significance, and either I
omitted to make a note of it, or entered it in a book which, with sundry
others, went mysteriously astray in the process of moving furniture. In
any case, though I have searched diligently I have failed to recover the
passage, but I note it here in the hope that one of my reader may be
more fortunate.\[Refer to [Malory Book IV, Chapter V](../mart/mart065.md)--
jbh\]

It is perhaps not without significance that a mention of Peredur
(Perceval) in Welsh poetry may also possibly contain a reference to his
healing office. I refer to the well-known *Song of the Graves* in the
Black Book of Carmarthen where the grave of Mor, son of Peredur
Penwetic, is referred to. According to Dr G. Evans the word *penwedic*,
or *perfeddyg*, as it may also be read, means *chief Healer*. Peredur,
it is needless to say, is the Welsh equivalent of Perceval, Gawain's
successor and supplanter in the *rôle* of Grail hero.

I have no desire to press the point unduly, but it is certainly
significant that, entirely apart from any such theory of the evolution
of the Grail legend as that advanced in these pages, a Welsh scholar
should have suggested a rendering of the title of the Grail hero which
is in complete harmony with that theory; a rendering also which places
him side by side with his compatriot Gwalchmai, even as the completely
evolved Grail story connects him with Gawain. In any case there is food
for reflection in the fact that the possibility of such an origin once
admitted, the most apparently incongruous, and inharmonious, elements of
the story show themselves capable of a natural and unforced explanation.

In face of the evidence above set forth it seems impossible to deny that
the Doctor, or Medicine Man, did, from the very earliest ages, play an
important part in Dramatic Fertility

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ritual, that he still survives in the modern
Folk-play, the rude representative of the early ritual form, and it is
at least possible that the attribution of healing skill to so romantic
and chivalrous a character as Sir Gawain may depend upon the fact that,
at an early, and pre-literary stage of his story, he played the *rôle*
traditionally assigned to the Doctor, that of restoring to life and
health the dead, or wounded, representative of the Spirit of Vegetation.

If I am right in my reading of this complicated problem the
*mise-en-scène* of the Grail story was originally a loan from a ritual
actually performed, and familiar to those who first told the tale. This
ritual, in its earlier stages comparatively simple and objective in
form, under the process of an insistence upon the inner and spiritual
significance, took upon itself a more complex and esoteric character,
the rite became a Mystery, and with this change the *rôle* of the
principal actors became of heightened significance. That of the Healer
could no longer be adequately fulfilled by the administration of a
medicinal remedy; the relation of Body and Soul became of cardinal
importance for the Drama, the Medicine Man gave place to the Redeemer;
and his task involved more than the administration of the original
Herbal remedy. In fact in the final development of the story the
*Pathos* is shared alike by the representative of the Vegetation Spirit,
and the Healer, whose task involves a period of stern testing and
probation.

If we wish to understand clearly the evolution of the Grail story we
must realize that the simple Fertility Drama from which it sprung has
undergone a gradual and mysterious change, which has invested it with
elements at once 'rich and strange,' and that though Folk-lore may be
the key to unlock the outer portal of the Grail castle it will not
suffice to give us the entrance to its deeper secrets.

### APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VIII

While having no connection with the main subject of our study, the Grail
legend, I should like to draw the attention of students of Medieval
literature to the curious parallel between the *Rig-Veda* poem of the
*Medicine Man* or *Kräuter-Lied* as it is also called, and Rustebœuf's
*Dist de l'Erberie*. Both are monologues, both presuppose the presence
of an audience, in each case the speaker is one who vaunts his skill in
the use of herbs, in each case he has in view the ultimate gain to
himself. Here are the opening lines of the Medieval poem <span
id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md):

"Seignor qui ci estes venu  
Petit et grant, jone et chenu,  
Il vos est trop bien avenu  
Sachiez de voir;  
Je ne vos vueil pas deçevoir  
Bien le porroz aperçevoir  
Ainz que m'en voise.  
Asiez vos, ne fetes noise  
Si escotez s'il ne vos poise  
Je sui uns mires."

He has been long with the lord of Caire, where he won much gold; in
Puille, Calabre, Luserne.

"Ai herbes prises  
Qui de granz vertuz sont enprises  
Sus quelque mal qu'el soient mises  
Le maus s'enfuit."

There is no reference in the poem to a cure about to be performed in the
presence of the audience, which does not however exclude the possibility
of such cure being effected.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

It would be interesting to know under what circumstances such a poem was
recited, whether it formed part of a popular representation. The
audience in view is of a mixed character, young and old, great and
small, and one has a vision of the Quack Doctor at some village fair, on
the platform before his booth, declaiming the virtues of his nostrums
before an audience representative of all ranks and ages. It is a far cry
from such a Medieval scene to the prehistoric days of the *Rig-Veda*,
but the *mise-en-scène* is the same; the popular 'seasonal' feast, the
Doctor with his healing herbs, which he vaunts in skilful rhyme, the
hearers, drawn from all ranks, some credulous, some amused. There seems
very little doubt that both poems are specimens, and very good
specimens, of a *genre* the popularity and vitality of which are
commensurate with the antiquity of its origin <span

<span id="fn_139"></span>[100:1](frr11.htm#fr_139.md) I would draw
attention to the fact that while scholars are now coming to the
conclusion that Classic Drama, whether Tragedy or Comedy, reposes for
its origin upon this ancient ritual, others have pointed out that Modern
Drama derives from the ritual Play of the Church, the first recorded
medieval drama being the Easter *Quem Quaeritis*? the dramatic
celebration of Our Lord's Resurrection. Cf. Chambers, *The Mediaeval
Stage*, where this thesis is elaborately developed and illustrated. It
is a curious fact that certain texts of this, the 'Classical' Passion
Play, contain a scene between the Maries and the 'Unguentarius' from
whom they purchase spices for the embalmment of Our Lord. Can this be a
survival of the Medicine Man? (Cf. *op. cit.* Vol. II. p. 33.)
