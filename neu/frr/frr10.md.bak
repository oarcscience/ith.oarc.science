# CHAPTER VII

### THE SWORD DANCE

The subject we are now about to consider is one which of late years has
attracted considerable attention, and much acute criticism has been
expended on the question of its origin and significance. Valuable
material has been collected, but the studies, so far, have been
individual, and independent, the much needed *travail d'ensemble* has
not yet appeared.

One definite result has, however, been obtained; it is now generally
admitted that the so-called Sword Dances, with the closely related
Morris Dances, and Mumming Plays, are not mere survivals of martial
exercises, an inherited tradition from our warrior ancestors, but were
solemn, ceremonial (in some cases there is reason to believe,
Initiatory) dances, performed at stated seasons of the year, and
directly and intimately connected with the ritual of which we have
treated in previous chapters, a ritual designed to preserve and promote
the regular and ordered sequence of the processes of Nature. And here,
again, our enquiry must begin with the very earliest records of our
race, with the traditions of our Aryan forefathers.

The earliest recorded Sword Dancers are undoubtedly the Maruts, those
swift-footed youths in gleaming armour who are the faithful attendants
on the great god, Indra. Professor von Schroeder, in *Mysterium und
Mimus*, describes them thus <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md): they
are a group of youths of equal age and

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

identical parentage, they are always depicted as attired in the same
manner, "Sie sind reich und prächtig geschmückt, mit Goldschmuck auf der
Brust, mit Spangen an den Händen, Hirschfelle tragen sie auf den
Schultern. Vor allem aber sind sie kriegerisch gerüstet, funkelnde
Speere tragen sie in den Händen, oder auch goldene Äxte. Goldene
Harnische oder Mäntel umhüllen sie, goldene Helme schimmern auf ihren
Häuptern. Nie erscheinen sie ohne Wehr und Waffen. Es scheint dass diese
ganz und gar zu ihren Wesen gehören."

The writer goes on to remark that when such a band of armed youths, all
of the same age, always closely associated with each other, are
represented as Dancers, and always as Dancers--"dann haben wir
unabweislich das Bild eines Waffentanzes vor unseren Augen"--and
Professor von Schroeder is undoubtedly right.

Constantly throughout the *Rig-Veda* the Maruts are referred to as
Dancers, "gold-bedecked Dancers," "with songs of praise they danced
round the spring," "When ye Maruts spear-armed dance, they (*i.e.*, the
Heavens) stream together like waves of water <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)."

And a special moment for the dance of these glorious youths "ever young
brothers of whom none is elder, none younger <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md)" is that of the ceremonial sacrifice,
"sie tanzen auf ihren himmlischen Bahnen, sie springen und tanzen auch
bei den Opferfesten der Menschen <span id="fr_107"></span>[3](#fn_107.md)."

The Maruts, as said above, were conceived of as the companions of Indra,
and helpers in his fight against his monstrous adversaries; thus they
were included in the sacrifices offered in honour of that Deity.

One of the most striking of the ritual Dramas reconstructed by Professor
von Schroeder is that which represents

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Indra as indignantly rejecting the claim of the
Maruts to share in such a sacrifice; they had failed to support him in
his conflict with the dragon, V<u>r</u>itra, when by his might he loosed
the waters, 'neither to-day, nor to-morrow' will he accept a sacrifice
of which they share the honour; it requires all the tact of the Offerer,
Agastya, and of the leader of the Maruts to soothe the offended
Deity <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md).

Here I would draw attention to the significant fact that the feat
celebrated is that to which I have previously referred as the most
famous of all the deeds attributed to Indra, the 'Freeing of the
Waters,' and here the Maruts are associated with the god.

But they were also the objects of independent worship. They were
specially honoured at the Câturmâsya, the feasts which heralded the
commencement of the three seasons of four months each into which the
Indian year was divided, a division corresponding respectively to the
hot, the cool, and the wet, season. The advantages to be derived from
the worship of the Maruts may be deduced from the following extracts
from the *Rig-Veda*, which devotes more than thirty hymns to their
praise. "The adorable Maruts, armed with bright lances, and cuirassed
with golden breastplates, enjoy vigorous existence; may the cars of the
quick-moving Maruts arrive for our good." "Bringers of rain and
fertility, shedding water, augmenting food." "Givers of abundant food."
"Your milchkine are never dry." "We invoke the food-laden chariots of
the Maruts <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109.md)." Nothing can be
clearer than this; the Maruts are 'daimons' of fertility, the worship of
whom will secure the necessary supply of the fruits of the earth.

The close association of the Maruts with Indra, the great Nature god,
has led some scholars to regard them as personifications

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

of a special manifestation of Nature, as Wind-gods. Professor von
Schroeder points out that their father was the god Rudra, later known as
Çiva, the god of departed souls, and of fruitfulness, *i.e.*, a
Chthonian deity, and suggests that the Maruts represent the "in Wind und
Sturm dahinjagende Seelenschar <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)."
He points out that the belief in a troop of departed souls is an
integral part of Aryan tradition, and classifies such belief under four
main headings.

1\. Under the form of a spectral Hunt, the Wild Huntsman well known in
European Folk-lore. He equates this with Dionysus Zagreus, and the Hunt
of Artemis-Hekate.

2\. That of a spectral Army, the souls of warriors slain in fight. The
Northern *Einherier* belong to this class, and the many traditions of
spectral combats, and ghostly battles, heard, but not seen.

3\. The conception of a host of women in a condition of ecstatic
exaltation bordering on madness, who appear girdled with snakes, or
hissing like snakes, tear living animals to pieces, and devour the
flesh. The classic examples here are the Greek Maenads, and the Indian
Senâs, who accompany Rudra.

4\. The conception of a train of theriomorphic, phallic, demons of
fertility, with their companion group of fair women. Such are the Satyrs
and Nymphs of Greek, the Gandharvas and Apsaras of Indian, Mythology.

To these four main groups may be added the belief among Germanic
peoples, also among the Letts, in a troop of Child Souls.

These four groups, in more or less modified forms, appear closely
connected with the dominant Spirit of Vegetation, by whatever name that
spirit may be known.

According to von Schroeder there was, among the Aryan peoples generally,
a tendency to regard the dead as assuming

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

the character of daimons of fertility. This view the learned Professor
considers to be at the root of the annual celebrations in honour of the
Departed, the 'Feast of Souls,' which characterized the commencement of
the winter season, and is retained in the Catholic conception of
November as the month of the Dead <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md).

In any case we may safely conclude that the Maruts, represented as armed
youths, were worshipped as deities of fruitfulness; that their dances
were of a ceremonial character; and that they were, by nature and
origin, closely connected with spirits of fertility of a lower order,
such as the Gandharvas. It also appears probable that, if the Dramas of
which traces have been preserved in the *Rig-Veda*, were, as scholars
are now of opinion, once actually represented, the mythological
conception of the Maruts must have found its embodiment in youths, most
probably of the priestly caste, who played their *rôle*, and actually
danced the ceremonial Sword Dance. As von Schroeder says, "Kein Zweifel
dass sie dabei von menschlichen, resp. priesterlichen Personen
dargestellt wurden <span id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112.md)."

When we turn from the early Aryan to the classic Greek period we find in
the Kouretes, and in a minor degree in the Korybantes, a parallel so
extraordinarily complete, alike in action and significance, that an
essential identity of origin appears to be beyond doubt.

The Kouretes were, as their name indicates, a band of armed youths, of
semi-divine origin, "Kureten sind von Haus aus halb-göttlich dämonische
Wesen nicht nur menschliche Priester, oder deren mythische
Vertreter <span id="fr_113"></span>[3](#fn_113.md)." Again,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

they are to be considered as "elementare Urwesen," and as such of
"Göttliche Abkunft <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md)." Preller
regards them as "Dämonen des Gebirgs <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md)," while a passage from Hesiod, quoted by
Strabo, equates them with nymphs and satyrs, *i.e.*, fertility
demons <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md).

When we remember that the Gandharvas are the Indian equivalent of the
Satyrs the close parallel between the Maruts and the Kouretes, both
alike bands of armed youths, of elementary origin, and connected with
beings of a lower grade, is striking.

The home of the Kouretes was in Crete, where they were closely
associated with the worship of the goddess Rhea. The traditional story
held that, in order to preserve the infant Zeus from destruction by his
father Kronos, they danced their famous Sword Dance round the babe,
overpowering his cries by the clash of their weapons.

Their dance was by some writers identified with the Pyrrhic dance, first
performed by Athene, in honour of her victory over the Giants, and
taught by her to the Kouretes. It had however, as we shall see, a very
distinct aim and purpose, and one in no way connected with warlike ends.

In Miss J. E. Harrison's deeply interesting volume, *Themis* <span
id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_117.md), she gives the translation of a
fragmentary *Hymn of the Kouretes*, discovered among the ruins of a
temple in Crete, a text which places beyond all doubt the fact that,
however mythical in origin, the Kouretes, certainly, had actual human
representatives, and that while in the case of the Maruts there may be a
question as to whether their dance actually took place, or not, so far
as the Kouretes are concerned there can be no such doubt.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

The following is the text as preserved to us; the slabs on which it is
inscribed are broken, and there are consequent lacunae.

"Io, Kouros most great, I give thee hail, Kronian, lord of all that is
wet and gleaming, thou art come at the head of thy Daimones. To Dikte
for the year, Oh march, and rejoice in the dance and song,

"That we make to thee with harps and pipes mingled together, and sing as
we come to a stand at thy well-fenced altar.

"Io, &c.

"For here the shielded Nurturers took thee, a child immortal, from Rhea,
and with noise of beating feet hid thee away.

"Io, &c.

"And the Horai began to be fruitful year by year, and Dikè to possess
mankind and all wild living things were held about by wealth-loving
Peace.

"Io, &c.

"And the Horai began to be fruitful year by year, and Dikè to possess
mankind and all wild living things were held about by wealth-loving
Peace.

"Io, &c.

"To us also leap for full jars, and leap for fleecy flocks, and leap for
fields of fruit, and for hives to bring increase.

"Io, &c.

"Leap for our cities, and leap for our sea-borne ships, and leap for our
young citizens, and for goodly Themis."

This hymn is most extraordinarily interesting; it places beyond all
doubt what was the root intention of this ceremonial dance; it was
designed to stimulate the reproductive energies of Nature, to bring into
being fruitful fields, and vineyards, plenteous increase in the flocks
and herds, and to people the cities with youthful citizens; and the god
is entreated not merely to accept the worship offered, but himself to
join in the action which shall produce such fair results, to leap for
full jars, and fleecy flocks, and for youthful citizens.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

The importance of movement, notably of what we may call group movement,
as a stimulant to natural energies, is thoroughly recognized among
primitive peoples; with them Dance holds a position equivalent to that
which, in more advanced communities, is assigned to Prayer. Professor
von Schroeder comments on this, "Es ist merkwürdig genug zu sehen wie
das Tanzen nach dem Glauben primitiver Völker eine ähnliche Kraft und
Bedeutung zu haben scheint wie man sie auf höheren Kulturstufen dem
inbrünstigen Gebete zuschreibt <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md)."
He cites the case of the Tarahumara Indians of Central America; while
the family as a whole are labouring in the fields it is the office of
one man to dance uninterruptedly on the dance place of the house; if he
fails in his office the labour of the others will be unsuccessful. The
one sin of which a Tarahumara Indian is conscious is that of not having
danced enough. Miss Harrison, in commenting on the dance of the
Kouretes, remarks that among certain savage tribes when a man is too old
to dance he hands on his dance to another. He then ceases to exist
socially; when he dies his funeral is celebrated with scanty rites;
having 'lost his dance' he has ceased to count as a social unit <span
id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md).

With regard to the connection of the Kouretes with the infant Zeus, Miss
Harrison makes the interesting suggestion that we have here a trace of
an Initiation Dance, analogous to those discussed by M. Van Gennep in
his *Rites du Passage*, that the original form was Tĭtăns, 'White-clay
men,' which later became Tītāns, 'Giants,' and she draws attention to
the fact that daubing the skin with white clay is a frequent practice in
these primitive rituals. To this I would add that it is a noteworthy
fact that in our modern survivals of these dances the performers are, as
a rule, dressed in white.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

The above suggestion is of extreme significance, as it brings out the
possibility that these celebrations were not only concerned with the
prosperity of the community, as a whole, but may also have borne a
special, and individual, aspect, and that the idea of Initiation into
the group is closely connected with the ceremonial exercise of group
functions.

To sum up, there is direct proof that the classic Greeks, in common with
their Aryan forefathers, held the conception of a group of Beings, of
mythic origin, represented under the form of armed youths, who were
noted dancers, and whose activities were closely connected with the
processes of Nature. They recognized a relation between these beings,
and others of a less highly developed aspect, phallic demons, often of
theriomorphic form. Thus the dance of the Kouretes should be considered
as a ceremonial ritual action, rather than as a warlike exercise; it was
designed to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, not to display the
skill of the dancers in the handling of weapons. When we turn to an
analogous group, that of the Korybantes, we find that, while presenting
a general parallel to the Kouretes (with whom they are often coupled in
mythologies), they also possess certain distinct characteristics, which
form a connecting link with other, and later, groups.

The Korybantes were of Phrygian origin, attached to the worship of the
goddess Kybele, and Attis, the well-known Phrygian counterpart to the
Phoenician Adonis, and originally the most important embodiment of the
Vegetation Spirit. Röscher considers them to be of identical origin with
the Kouretes, *i.e.*, as elementary 'daimons,' but the Korybantes of
Classic art and tradition are undoubtedly human beings. Priests of
Kybele, they appear in surviving bas-reliefs in company with that
goddess, and with Attis.

The dance of the Korybantes is distinguished from that

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

of the Kouretes by its less restrained, and more orgiastic character; it
was a wild and whirling dance resembling that of the modern Dervishes,
accompanied by self-mutilation and an unrhythmic clashing of weapons,
designed, some writers think, to overpower the cries of the victims.

If this suggestion be correct it would seem to indicate that, if the
Dance of the Kouretes was originally an Initiation Dance, that of the
Korybantes was Sacrificial in character. We shall see later that certain
features in the surviving forms of the Sword Dance also point in this
direction.

The interest of the Korybantes for our investigation lies in the fact
that here again we have the Sword Dance in close and intimate connection
with the worship of the Vegetation Spirit, and there can be no doubt
that here, as elsewhere, it was held to possess a stimulating virtue.

A noticeable point in the modern survivals of these Dances is that the
Dance proper is combined with a more or less coherent dramatic action.
The Sword Dance originally did not stand alone, but formed part of a
Drama, to the action of which it may be held to have given a cumulative
force.

On this point I would refer the reader to Professor von Schroeder's
book, where this aspect of the Dance is fully discussed <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md).

We have already spoken of the Maruts, and their dramatic connection with
Indra; the Greek Dancers offer us no direct parallel, though the
connection of the Kouretes with the infant Zeus may quite possibly
indicate the existence in the original form of the Dance, of a more
distinctly dramatic element.

We have, however, in the Roman Salii a connecting link which proves
beyond all doubt that our modern dances, and analogous representations,
are in fact genuine survivals of

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

primitive ceremonies, and in no way a mere fortuitous combination of
originally independent elements.

The Salii formed a college of priests, twelve in number, dedicated to
the service of Mars, who, it is important to remember, was originally a
god of growth and vegetation, a Spring Deity, who bestowed his name on
the vernal month of March; only by degrees did the activities of the god
become specially connected with the domain of War <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md).

There seem to have been two groups of Salii, one having their college on
the Palatine, the other on the Quirinal; the first were the more
important. The Quirinal group shared in the celebrations of the latter
part of the month only.

The first of March was the traditional birthday of Mars, and from that
date, during the whole of the month, the Salii offered sacrifices and
performed dances in his honour. They wore pointed caps, or helmets, on
their head, were girt with swords, and carried on the left arm shields,
copied from the 'ancilia' or traditional shield of Mars, fabled to have
fallen from heaven. In their right hand they bore a small lance.

Dionysus of Halicarnassus, in a passage describing the Salii, says,
"they carried in their right hand a spear, or staff, or something of
that sort." Miss Harrison, quoting this passage, gives a reproduction of
a bas-relief representing the Salii carrying what she says "are clearly
drumsticks." (As a matter of fact they very closely resemble the 'Wands'
which in the Tarot cards sometimes represent the 'Lance' suit.)

Miss Harrison suggests that the original shields were made of skins,
stretched upon a frame, and beaten by these 'drumsticks.' This may quite
well have been the case, and it would bear out my contention that the
original contact

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

of weapon and shield was designed rather as a rhythmic accompaniment to
the Dance, than as a display of skill in handling sword and lance,
*i.e.*, that these dances were not primarily warlike exercises.

At the conclusion of their songs the Salii invoked Mamurius Veturius,
the smith who was fabled to have executed the copies of the original
shield, while on the 14th of March, a man, dressed in skins, and
supposed to represent the aforesaid smith, was led through the streets,
beaten by the Salii with rods, and thrust out of the city.

The following day, the 15th, was the feast of Anna Perenna, fabled to be
an old woman, to whom Mars had confided the tale of his love for Nerio,
and who, disguising herself as the maiden, had gone through the ceremony
of marriage with the god. This feast was held outside the gates. On the
23rd the combined feast of Mars and Nerio was held with great rejoicing
throughout the city. Modern scholars have unanimously recognized in
Mamurius Veturius and Anna Perenna the representatives of the Old Year,
the Vegetation Spirit, and his female counterpart, who, grown old, must
yield place to the young god and his correspondingly youthful bride.
Reference to Chapter 5, where the medieval and modern forms of this
Nature ritual are discussed, and instances of the carrying out of
Winter, and ceremonial bringing in of Spring, are given, will suffice to
show how vital and enduring an element in Folk-lore is this idea of
driving out the Old Year, while celebrating the birth of the New. Here
then, again, we have a ritual Sword Dance closely associated with the
practice of a Nature cult; there can, I think, be no doubt that *ab
initio* the two were connected with each other.

But the dance of the Salii with its dramatic Folk-play features forms an
interesting link between the classic Dance of the Kouretes, and the
modern English survivals, in which

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

the dramatic element is strongly marked. These English forms may be
divided into three related groups, the Sword Dance, the Morris Dance,
and the Mumming Play. Of these the Morris Dance stands somewhat apart;
of identical origin, it has discarded the dramatic element, and now
survives simply as a Dance, whereas the Sword Dance is always dramatic
in form, and the Mumming Play, acted by characters appearing also in the
Sword Dance, invariably contains a more or less elaborate fight <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md).

The Sword Dance proper appears to have been preserved mostly in the
North of England, and in Scotland. Mr Cecil Sharp has found four
distinct varieties in Yorkshire alone. At one time there existed a
special variant known as the *Giants' Dance*, in which the leading
characters were known by the names of Wotan, and Frau Frigg; one figure
of this dance consisted in making a ring of swords round the neck of a
lad, without wounding him.

Mr E. K. Chambers has commented on this as the survival of a sacrificial
origin <span id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md). The remarks of this writer
on the Sword Dance in its dramatic aspect are so much to the point that
I quote them here. "The Sword Dance makes its appearance, not like
heroic poetry in general, as part of the minstrel repertory, but as a
purely popular thing at the agricultural festivals. To these festivals
we may therefore suppose it to have originally belonged." Mr Chambers
goes on to remark that the dance of the Salii discussed above, was
clearly agricultural, "and belongs to Mars not as War god, but in his
more primitive quality of a fertilization Spirit."

In an Appendix to his most valuable book the same writer gives a full
description, with text, of the most famous

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

surviving form of the Sword Dance, that of Papa Stour (old Norwegian
*Pâpey in Stôra*), one of the Shetland Islands.

The dance was performed at Christmas (Yule-tide). The dancers, seven in
number, represented the seven champions of Christendom; the leader,
Saint George, after an introductory speech, performed a solo dance, to
the music of an accompanying minstrel. He then presented his comrades,
one by one, each in turn going through the same performance. Finally the
seven together performed an elaborate dance. The complete text of the
speeches is given in the Appendix referred to <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md).

The close connection between the English Sword Dance, and the Mumming
Play, is indicated by the fact that the chief character in these plays
is, generally speaking, Saint George. (The title has in some cases
become corrupted into *King* George.) In Professor von Schroeder's
opinion this is due to Saint George's legendary *rôle* as Dragon slayer,
and he sees in the importance assigned to this hero an argument in
favour of his theory that the "Slaying of the Dragon" was the earliest
Aryan Folk-Drama.

In *Folk-Lore*, Vol. X., a fully illustrated description of the Mumming
Play, as performed at Newbold, a village near Rugby, is given <span
id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md). Here the characters are Father
Christmas, Saint George, a Turkish Knight, Doctor, Moll Finney (mother
of the Knight), Humpty Jack, Beelzebub, and 'Big-Head-and-Little-Wit.'
These last three have no share in the action proper, but appear in a
kind of Epilogue, accompanying a collection made by Beelzebub.

The Play is always performed at Christmas time, consequently Father
Christmas appears as stage-manager, and introduces the characters. The
action consists in a general challenge issued by Saint George, and
accepted by the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Turkish Knight. A combat follows, in which the
Turk is slain. His mother rushes in, weeps over the body, and demands
the services of a Doctor, who appears accordingly, vaunts his skill in
lines interspersed with unintelligible gibberish, and restores the Turk
to life. In the version which used to be played throughout Scotland at
Hogmanay (New-Year-tide), the characters are Bol Bendo, the King of
France, the King of Spain, Doctor Beelzebub, Golishan, and Sir
Alexander <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md). The fight is between
Bol Bendo (who represents the Saint George of the English version), and
Golishan. The latter is killed, and, on the demand of Sir Alexander (who
acts as stage-manager), revived by the doctor, this character, as in the
English version, interlarding the recital of his feats of healing skill
with unintelligible phrases <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md). There
is a general consensus of opinion among Folk-lore authorities that in
this rough drama, which we find played in slightly modified form all
over Europe (in Scandinavia it is the Julbock, a man dressed in skins,
who, after a dramatic dance, is killed and revived <span
id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_128).md), we have a symbolic representation of
the death and re-birth of the year; a counterpart to those ceremonies of
driving out Winter, and bringing in Spring, which we have already
described.

This chapter had already been written when an important article, by Dr
Jevons, entitled *Masks and the Origin of the Greek Drama* appeared in
*Folk-Lore* (Vol. XXVII.) The author, having discussed the different
forms

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

of Greek Drama, and the variety of masks employed, decides that "Greek
Comedy originated in Harvest Festivals, in some ceremony in which the
Harvesters went about in procession wearing masks." This ceremony he
connects directly with the English Mumming Plays, suggesting that "the
characters represented on this occasion were the Vegetation Spirit, and
those who were concerned in bringing about his revivification--in fine,
Greek Comedy and the Mumming Play both sprang from the rite of
revivification." At a later stage of our enquiry we shall have occasion
to return to this point, and realize its great importance for our
theory.

The Morris Dances differ somewhat from the Sword, and Mumming Dances.
The performances as a rule take place in the Spring, or early Summer,
chiefly May, and Whitsuntide. The dances retain little or no trace of
dramatic action but are dances pure and simple. The performers,
generally six in number, are attired in white elaborately-pleated
shirts, decked with ribbons, white mole-skin trousers, with bells at the
knee, and beaver hats adorned with ribbons and flowers. The leader
carries a sword, on the point of which is generally impaled a cake;
during the dancing slices of this cake are distributed to the lookers
on, who are supposed to make a contribution to the 'Treasury,' a
money-box carried by an individual called the Squire, or Clown, dressed
in motley, and bearing in the other hand a stick with a bladder at one
end, and a cow's tail at the other.

In some forms of the dance there is a 'Lord' and a 'Lady,' who carry
'Maces' of office; these maces are short staves, with a transverse piece
at the top, and a hoop over it. The whole is decorated with ribbons and
flowers, and bears a curious resemblance to the *Crux Ansata* <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md). In certain

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

figures of the dance the performers carry handkerchiefs, in others,
wands, painted with the colours of the village to which they belong; the
dances are always more or less elaborate in form.

The costume of the 'Clown' (an animal's skin, or cap of skin with tail
pendant) and the special character assumed by the Maytide celebrations
in certain parts of England, *e.g.*, Cornwall and Staffordshire <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md), would seem to indicate that, while the
English Morris Dance has dropped the dramatic action, the dancers not
being designated by name, and playing no special *rôle*, it has, on the
other hand, retained the theriomorphic features so closely associated
with Aryan ritual, which the Sword Dance, and Mumming Play, on their
side, have lost <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md).

A special note of these English survivals, and one to which I would now
draw attention, is the very elaborate character of the figures, and the
existence of a distinct symbolic element. I am informed that the Sword
dancers of to-day always, at the conclusion of a series of elaborate
sword-lacing figures, form the Pentangle; as they hold up the sign they
cry, triumphantly, "*A Nut! A Nut!*" The word *Nut* = *Knot* (as in the
game of '*Nuts*, *i.e.*, breast-knots, nosegays, *in May*'). They do
this often even when performing a later form of the Mumming Play.

I have already drawn attention to the fact that in *Gawain and the Green
Knight* the hero's badge is the Pentangle (or Pentacle), there explained
as called by the English 'the Endless Knot <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md).' In the previous chapter I have noted
that the Pentangle frequently in the Tarot suits replaces the Dish; in
Mr Yeats's remarks, cited above, the two are held to be

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

interchangeable, one or the other always forms one of the group of
symbols.

In one form of the Morris Dance, that performed in Berkshire, the
leader, or 'Squire' of the Morris carries a Chalice! At the same time he
bears a Sword, and a bull's head at the end of a long pole. This figure
is illustrated in Miss Mary Neal's *Esperance Morris Book* <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md).

Thus our English survivals of these early Vegetation ceremonies
preserve, in a more or less detached form, the four symbols discussed in
the preceding chapter, Grail, Sword, Lance, and Pentangle, or Dish. It
seems to me that, in view of the evidence thus offered, it is not a very
hazardous, or far-fetched hypothesis to suggest that these symbols, the
exact value of which, as a group, we cannot clearly determine, but of
which we know the two most prominent, Cup and Lance, to be sex symbols,
were originally 'Fertility' emblems, and as such employed in a ritual
designed to promote, or restore, the activity of the reproductive
energies of Nature.

As I have pointed out above an obvious dislocation has taken place in
our English survivals. Sword Dance, Mumming Play, and Morris Dance, no
longer form part of one ceremony, but have become separated, and
connected, on the one hand with the Winter, on the other with the early
Summer, Nature celebrations; it is thus not surprising that the symbols
should also have become detached. The fact that the three groups
manifestly form part of an original whole is an argument in favour of
the view that at one moment all the symbols were used together, and the
Grail chalice

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

carried in a ceremony in which Sword, Lance, and Pentangle, were also
displayed.

But there is another point I would suggest. Is it not possible that, in
these armed youths, who were in some cases, notably in that of the
Salii, at once warriors and priests, we have the real origin of the
Grail Knights? We know now, absolutely, and indubitably, that these
Sword Dances formed an important part of the Vegetation ritual; is it
not easily within the bounds of possibility that, as the general
ceremonial became elevated, first to the rank of a Mystery Cult, and
then used as a vehicle for symbolic Christian teaching, the figures of
the attendant warrior-priests underwent a corresponding change? From
Salii to Templars is not after all so 'far a cry' as from the glittering
golden-armed Maruts, and the youthful leaping Kouretes, to the grotesque
tatterdemalion personages of the Christmas Mumming Play. We have learnt
to acknowledge the common origin of these two latter groups; may we not
reasonably contemplate a possible relation existing between the two
first named?

<span id="fn_127"></span>[91:2](frr10.htm#fr_127.md) I would draw attention
to the curious name of the adversary, Golishan; it is noteworthy that in
one Arthurian romance Gawain has for adversary Golagros, in another
Percival fights against Golerotheram. Are these all reminiscences of the
giant Goliath, who became the synonym for a dangerous, preferably
heathen, adversary, even as Mahomet became the synonym for an idol?

Chalice is surmounted by a Heart, and in the Tarot suits *Cups* are the
equivalent of our *Hearts*. The combination has now become identified
with the cult of the Sacred Heart, but is undoubtedly much older.
