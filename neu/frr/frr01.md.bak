# Preface

In the introductory Chapter the reader will find the aim and object of
these studies set forth at length. In view of the importance and
complexity of the problems involved it seemed better to incorporate such
a statement in the book itself, rather than relegate it to a Preface
which all might not trouble to read. Yet I feel that such a general
statement does not adequately express my full debt of obligation.

Among the many whose labour has been laid under contribution in the
following pages there are certain scholars whose published work, or
personal advice, has been specially illuminating, and to whom specific
acknowledgment is therefore due. Like many others I owe to Sir J. G.
Frazer the initial inspiration which set me, as I may truly say, on the
road to the Grail Castle. Without the guidance of *The Golden Bough* I
should probably, as the late M. Gaston Paris happily expressed it, still
be wandering in the forest of Broceliande!

During the Bayreuth Festival of 1911 I had frequent opportunities of
meeting, and discussion with, Professor von Schroeder. I owe to him not
only the introduction to his own work, which I found most helpful, but
references which have been of the greatest assistance; *e.g.* my
knowledge of Cumont's *Les Religions Orientales*, and Scheftelowitz's
valuable study on *Fish Symbolism*, both of which have furnished
important links in the chain of evidence, is due to Professor von
Schroeder.

The perusal of Miss J. E. Harrison's *Themis* opened my eyes to the
extended importance of these Vegetation rites. In view of the evidence
there adduced I asked myself whether beliefs which had found expression
not only in social institution, and popular custom, but, as set forth in
Sir G. Murray's study on Greek Dramatic Origins, attached to the work,
also in Drama and Literature, might not reasonably--even inevitably--be
expected to have left their mark on Romance? The one seemed to me a
necessary corollary of the other, and I felt that I had gained, as the
result of Miss Harrison's work, a wider, and more assured basis for my
own researches. I was no longer engaged merely in enquiring into the
sources of a fascinating legend, but on the identification of another
field of activity for forces whose potency as agents of evolution we
were only now beginning rightly to appreciate.

Finally, a casual reference, in Anrich's work on the Mysteries, to the
*Naassene Document*, caused me to apply to Mr G. R. S. Mead, of whose
knowledge of the mysterious border-land between Christianity and
Paganism, and willingness to place that knowledge at the disposal of
others, I had, for some years past, had pleasant experience. Mr Mead
referred me to his own translation and analysis of the text in question,
and there, to my satisfaction, I found, not only the final link that
completed the chain of evolution from Pagan Mystery to Christian
Ceremonial, but also proof of that wider significance I was beginning to
apprehend. The problem involved was not one of Folk-lore, not even one
of Literature, but of Comparative Religion in its widest sense.

Thus, while I trust that my co-workers in the field of Arthurian
research will accept these studies as a permanent contribution to the
elucidation of the Grail problem, I would fain hope that those scholars
who labour in a wider field, and to whose works I owe so much, may find
in the results here set forth elements that may prove of real value in
the study of the evolution of religious belief.
