# LOKASENNA

### Loki's Wrangling

##### INTRODUCTORY NOTES

The *Lokasenna* is found only in *Regius*, where it follows the
*Hymiskvitha*; Snorri quotes four lines of it, grouped together as a
single stanza.

The poem is one of the most vigorous of the entire collection, and seems
to have been preserved in exceptionally good condition. The exchange or
contest of insults was dear to the Norse heart, and the *Lokasenna*
consists chiefly of Loki's taunt; to the assembled gods and goddesses,
and their largely ineffectual attempts to talk back to him. The author
was evidently well versed in mythological fore, and the poem is full of
references to incidents not elsewhere recorded. As to its date and
origin there is the usual dispute, but the latter part of the tenth
century and Iceland seem the best guesses.

The prose notes are long and of unusual interest. The introductory one
links the poem closely to the *Hymiskvitha*, much as the *Reginsmol*,
*Fafnismol* and *Sigrdrifumol* are linked together; the others fill in
the narrative gaps in the dialogue--very like stage directions,--and
provide a conclusion by relating Loki's punishment, which, presumably,
is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when
the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was
committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory
comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by
adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The *Lokasenna* is
certainly much older than the *Hymiskvitha*, the connection between them
being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler
evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose
work he was annotating.

Ægir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he
had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came
Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the
East. Sif,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

Thor's wife, was there, and Brag, with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but
one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when
they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and
Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr's

\[*Prose*. *Ægir*: the sea-god; Snorri gives Hler as another of his
names, but he is not elsewhere called Gymir, which is the name of the
giant, Gerth's father, in the Skirnismol. On Ægir cf. *Grimnismol*, 45,
and *Hymiskvitha*, 1. *Frigg*: though Othin's wife is often mentioned,
she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. *Voluspo*, 34,
*Vafthruthnismol*, I, and *Grimnismol*, introductory prose. *Thor*: the
compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor's movements; the
"Journey in the East" here mentioned cannot be the one described in the
*Hymiskvitha*, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor
through out that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor
was off killing giants. *Sif*: concerning Thor's wife the chief incident
is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor,
was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of
gold; cf. *Harbarthsljoth*, 48. *Bragi*: the god of poetry; cf.
*Grimnismol*, 44 and note. *Ithun*: the goddess of youth; cf. note on
*Skirnismol*, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the
Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her
and her apples, explaining the reference in *Harbarthsljoth*, 19 (q.
v.). *Tyr*: the god of battle; cf. *Hymiskvitha*, 4, and (concerning his
dealings with the wolf Fenrir) *Voluspo*, 39, note. *Njorth*: the chief
of the Wanes, and father of Freyr and Freyja; cf. (concerning the whole
family) *Skirnismol*, introductory prose and note, also *Voluspo*, 21
and note. *Skathi*: Njorth's wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi;
cf. *Harbarthsljoth*, 19, note, and *Grimnismol*, 17. *Vithar*: the
silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf
Fenrir; cf. *Voluspo*, 54, *Vafthruthnismol*, 51, and *Grimnismol*, 17.
*Loki*: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references
to his career in the Lokasenna, cf. particularly *Voluspo*, 32 and 35,
and notes. *Byggvir and Beyla*: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems;
Freyr's conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero of the Skirnismol.
*Fimafeng* ("The Swift Handler") \[fp. 153\] and *Eldir* ("The Man of
the Fire"): mentioned only in connection with this incident. *Glittering
gold*: Ægir's use of gold to light his hall, which was often thought of
as under the sea, was responsible for the phrase "flame of the flood,"
and sundry kindred phrases, meaning "gold."\]

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

servants Byggvir and Beyla. Many were there of the gods and elves.

Ægir had two serving-men, Fimafeng and Eldir. Glittering gold they had
in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the
peace. The guests praised much the ability of Ægir's serving-men. Loki
might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their
shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and
thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met
Eldir. Loki spoke to him:

1\. "Speak now, Eldir, \| for not one step  
Farther shalt thou fare;  
What ale-talk here \| do they have within,  
The sons of the glorious gods?"

Eldir spake:  
2. "Of their weapons they talk, \| and their might in war,  
The sons of the glorious gods;  
From the gods and elves \| who are gathered here  
No friend in words shalt thou find."

Loki spake:  
3. "In shall I go \| into Ægir's hall,  
For the feast I fain would see;

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Bale and hatred \| I bring to the gods,  
And their mead with venom I mix."

Eldir spake:  
4. "If in thou goest \| to Ægir's hall,  
And fain the feast wouldst see,  
And with slander and spite \| wouldst sprinkle the gods,  
Think well lest they wipe it on thee."

Loki spake:  
5. "Bethink thee, Eldir, \| if thou and I  
Shall strive with spiteful speech;  
Richer I grow \| in ready words  
If thou speakest too much to me."

Then Loki went into the hall, but when they who were there saw who had
entered, they were all silent.

Loki spake:  
6. "Thirsty I come \| into this thine hall,  
I, Lopt, from a journey long,  
To ask of the gods \| that one should give  
Fair mead for a drink to me.

7\. "Why sit ye silent, \| swollen with pride,  
Ye gods, and no answer give?

\[6. *Lopt*: like Lothur (cf. *Voluspo*, 18) another name for Loki; cf.
*Hyndluljoth*, 43, and *Svipdagsmol*, 42.

7\. in the manuscript this stanza begins with a small letter, and
Heinzel unites it with stanza 6.\]

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

At your feast a place \| and a seat prepare me,  
Or bid me forth to fare."

Bragi spake:  
8. "A place and a seat \| will the gods prepare  
No more in their midst for thee;  
For the gods know well \| what men they wish  
To find at their mighty feasts."

Loki spake:  
9. "Remember, Othin, \| in olden days  
That we both our blood have mixed;  
Then didst thou promise \| no ale to pour,  
Unless it were brought for us both."

Othin spake:  
10. "Stand forth then, Vithar, \| and let the wolf's father  
Find a seat at our feast;

\[9. *Bragi*: cf. note on introductory prose. Why Loki taunts him with
cowardice (stanzas 11-13-15) is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi
was the patron, was generally associated in the Norse mind with peculiar
valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise noted fighters.

9\. There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus
swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises
that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of "mingling
blood" was carried out quite literally, and the promise of -which Loki
speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied
the ceremony; cf. Brot af Sigurtharkvithu, 18 and note.

10\. In stanzas 10-31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the
identity of the several speakers, but these are uniformly clear \[fp.
156\] enough through the context. *Vithar*: cf. note on introductory
prose. *The wolf's father*: Loki; cf. *Voluspo*, 39 and note.\]

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

Lest evil should Loki \| speak aloud  
Here within Ægir's hall."

Then Vithar arose and poured drink for Loki; but before he drank he
spoke to the gods:

11\. "Hail to you, gods! \| ye goddesses, hail!  
Hail to the holy throng!  
Save for the god \| who yonder sits,  
Bragi there on the bench."

Bragi spake:  
12. "A horse and a sword \| from my hoard will I give,  
And a ring gives Bragi to boot,  
That hatred thou makst not \| among the gods;  
So rouse not the great ones to wrath."

Loki spake:  
13. "In horses and rings \| thou shalt never be rich,  
Bragi, but both shalt thou lack;  
Of the gods and elves \| here together met  
Least brave in battle art thou,  
(And shyest thou art of the shot.)"

Bragi spake:  
14. "Now were I without \| as I am within,

\[13. Sijmons makes one line of lines 4-5 by cutting out a part of each;
Finnur Jonsson rejects 5 as spurious.

14\. The text of line 4 is somewhat obscure, and has been \[fp. 157\]
variously emended, one often adopted suggestion making the line read,
"Little is that for thy lies."\]

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

And here in Ægir's hall,  
Thine head would I bear \| in mine hands away,  
And pay thee the price of thy lies."

Loki spake:  
15. "In thy seat art thou bold, \| not so are thy deeds,  
Bragi, adorner of benches!  
Go out and fight \| if angered thou feelest,  
No hero such forethought has."

Ithun spake:  
16. "Well, prithee, Bragi, \| his kinship weigh,  
Since chosen as wish-son he was;  
And speak not to Loki \| such words of spite  
Here within Ægir's hall."

Loki spake:  
17. "Be silent, Ithun! \| thou art, I say,

\[15. *Adorner of benches*: this epithet presumably implies that Bragi
is not only slothful, but also effeminate, for a very similar word,
"pride of the benches," means a bride.

16\. *Ithun*: Bragi's wife; cf. note on introductory prose. The
goddesses who, finding that their husbands are getting the worst of it,
take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves confronted with
undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52
(Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar
fashion. *Wish-son*: adopted son; Loki was the son of the giant Farbauti
and the giantess Laufey, and hence was not of the race of the gods, but
had been virtually adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to
regret it.\]

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Of women most lustful in love,  
Since thou thy washed-bright \| arms didst wind  
About thy brother's slayer."

Ithun spake:  
18. "To Loki I speak not \| with spiteful words  
Here within Ægir's hall;  
And Bragi I calm, \| who is hot with beer,  
For I wish not that fierce they should fight."

Gefjun spake:  
19. "Why, ye gods twain, \| with bitter tongues  
Raise hate among us here?  
Loki is famed \| for his mockery foul,  
And the dwellers in heaven he hates."

Loki spake:  
20. "Be silent, Gefjun! \| for now shall I say  
Who led thee to evil life;  
The boy so fair \| gave a necklace bright,  
And about him thy leg was laid."

\[17. We do not even know who Ithun's brother was, much less who slew
him.

19\. *Gefjun*: a goddess, not elsewhere mentioned in the poems, who,
according to Snorri, was served by the women who died maidens. Beyond
this nothing is known of her. Lines 3-4 in the manuscript are puzzling,
and have been freely emended.

20\. Nothing is known of the incident here mentioned. There is a good
deal of confusion as to various of the gods and goddesses, and it has
been suggested that Gefjun is really Frigg under an other name, with a
little of Freyja--whose attributes were frequently confused with
Frigg's--thrown in. Certainly Othin's \[fp. 159\] answer (stanza 21,
lines 3-4) fits Frigg perfectly, for she shared his knowledge of the
future, whereas it has no relation to any thing known of Gefjun. As for
the necklace (line 3), it may be the Brisings' necklace, which appears
in the *Thrymskvitha* as Freyja's, but which, in some mythological
writings, is assigned to Frigg.\]

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Othin spake:  
21. "Mad art thou, Loki, \| and little of wit,  
The wrath of Gefjun to rouse;  
For the fate that is set \| for all she sees,  
Even as I, methinks."

Loki spake:  
22. "Be silent, Othin! \| not justly thou settest  
The fate of the fight among men;  
Oft gavst thou to him \| who deserved not the gift,  
To the baser, the battle's prize."

Othin spake:  
23. "Though I gave to him \| who deserved not the gift,  
To the baser, the battle's prize;  
Winters eight \| wast thou under the earth,  
Milking the cows as a maid,  
(Ay, and babes didst thou bear;  
Unmanly thy soul must seem.)"

\[21. Snorri quotes line 1; cf. note on stanza 29.

23\. There is no other reference to Loki's having spent eight years
underground, or to his cow-milking. On one occasion, however, he did
bear offspring. A giant had undertaken to build the gods a fortress, his
reward being Freyja and the sun and moon, provided the work was done by
a given time. His sole helper was his horse, Svathilfari. The work being
nearly done, and the gods fearing to lose Freyja and the sun and moon,
Loki \[fp. 160\] turned himself into a mare, and so effectually
distracted Svathilfari from his task that shortly afterwards Loki gave
birth to Othin's eight-legged horse, Sleipnir. In such contests of abuse
a man was not infrequently taunted with having borne children; cf.
*Helgakvitha Hundingsbana* I, 39-45. One or two of the last three lines
may be spurious.\]

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Loki spake:  
24. "They say that with spells \| in Samsey once  
Like witches with charms didst thou work;  
And in witch's guise \| among men didst thou go;  
Unmanly thy soul must seem."

Frigg spake:  
25. "Of the deeds ye two \| of old have done  
Ye should make no speech among men;  
Whate'er ye have done \| in days gone by,  
Old tales should ne'er be told."

Loki spake:  
26. "Be silent, Frigg! \| thou art Fjorgyn's wife,  
But ever lustful in love;  
For Vili and Ve, \| thou wife of Vithrir,  
Both in thy bosom have lain."

\[24. *Samsey*: perhaps the Danish island of Samsö. Othin was the god of
magic, but there is no other reference to his ever having disguised
himself as a witch.

25\. *Frigg*: Othin's wife; cf. note to introductory prose.

26\. *Fjorgyn*: Othin; cf. *Voluspo*, 56 and note. *Vili and Ve*:
Othin's brothers, who appear merely as, with Othin, the sons of Bur and
Bestla; cf. *Voluspo*, 4. The *Ynglingasaga* says that, during one of
Othin's protracted absences, his two brothers took Frigg as their
mistress. *Vithrir*: another name for Othin.\]

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

Frigg spake:  
27. "If a son like Baldr \| were by me now,  
Here within Ægir's hall,  
From the sons of the gods \| thou shouldst go not forth  
Till thy fierceness in fight were tried."

Loki spake:  
28. "Thou wilt then, Frigg, \| that further I tell  
Of the ill that now I know;  
Mine is the blame \| that Baldr no more  
Thou seest ride home to the hall."

Freyja spake:  
29. "Mad art thou, Loki, \| that known thou makest  
The wrong and shame thou hast wrought;  
The fate of all \| does Frigg know well,  
Though herself she says it not."

Loki spake:  
30. "Be silent, Freyja! \| for fully I know thee,  
Sinless thou art not thyself;

\[27. On the death of Baldr, slain through Loki's cunning by the blind
Hoth, cf. *Voluspo*, 32 and note.

29\. *Freyja*: daughter of Njorth and sister of Freyr; cf. note on
introductory prose. Snorri, in speaking of Frigg's knowledge of the
future, makes a stanza out of *Lokasenna*, 21, 1; 47, 2; 29, 3-4, thus:
"Mad art thou, Loki, \| and little of wit, / Why, Loki, leavst thou this
not? / The fate of all \| does Frigg know well, / Though herself she
says it not."

30\. According to Snorri, Freyja was a model of fidelity to her husband,
Oth.\]

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

Of the gods and elves \| who are gathered here,  
Each one as thy lover has lain."

Freyja spake:  
31. "False is thy tongue, \| and soon shalt thou find  
That it sings thee an evil song;  
The gods are wroth, \| and the goddesses all,  
And in grief shalt thou homeward go."

Loki spake:  
32. "Be silent, Freyja! \| thou foulest witch,  
And steeped full sore in sin;  
In the arms of thy brother \| the bright gods caught thee  
When Freyja her wind set free."

Njorth spake:  
33. "Small ill does it work \| though a woman may have  
A lord or a lover or both;  
But a wonder it is \| that this womanish god  
Comes hither, though babes he has borne."

\[32. Before each of stanzas 32-42 the manuscript indicates the speaker,
through the initial letter of the name written in the margin. *Thy
brother*: Freyr; there is no other indication that such a relation
existed between these two, but they themselves were the product of such
a union; cf. stanza 36 and note.

33\. *Njorth*: father of Freyr and Freyja, and given by the Wanes as a
hostage, in exchange for Hönir, at the close of the first war; Cf.
*Voluspo*, 21 and note, also *Skirnismol*, introductory prose and note.
*Babes*: cf. stanza 23 and note. Bugge suggests that this clause may
have been a late insertion.\]

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Loki spake:  
34. "Be silent, Njorth; \| thou wast eastward sent,  
To the gods as a hostage given;  
And the daughters of Hymir \| their privy had  
When use did they make of thy mouth."

Njorth spake:  
35. "Great was my gain, \| though long was I gone,  
To the gods as a hostage given;  
The son did I have \| whom no man hates,  
And foremost of gods is found."

Loki spake:  
36. "Give heed now, Njorth, \| nor boast too high,  
No longer I hold it hid;  
With thy sister hadst thou \| so fair a son,  
Thus hadst thou no worse a hope."

Tyr spake:  
37. "Of the heroes brave \| is Freyr the best  
Here in the home of the gods;

\[34. *Daughters of Hymir*: we have no clue to who these were, though
Hymir is doubtless the frost-giant of the *Hymiskvitha* (q.v.). Loki's
point is that Njorth is not a god, but the product of an inferior race
(the Wanes).

35\. *The son*: Freyr.

36\. *Thy sister*: the *Ynglingasaga* supports this story of Njorth's
having had two children by his sister before he came among the gods.
Snorri, on the other hand, specifically says that Freyr and Freyja were
born after Njorth came to the gods.

37\. *Tyr*: the god of battle; cf. notes on *Hymiskvitha*, 4, and
*Voluspo*, 39. *Freyr*; concerning his noble qualities cf. *Skirnismol*,
introductory prose and note.\]

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

He harms not maids \| nor the wives of men,  
And the bound from their fetters he frees."

Loki spake:  
38. "Be silent, Tyr! \| for between two men  
Friendship thou ne'er couldst fashion;  
Fain would I tell \| how Fenrir once  
Thy right hand rent from thee."

Tyr spake:  
39. "My hand do I lack, \| but Hrothvitnir thou,  
And the loss brings longing to both;  
Ill fares the wolf \| who shall ever await  
In fetters the fall of the gods."

Loki spake:  
40. "Be silent, Tyr! \| for a son with me  
Thy wife once chanced to win;  
Not a penny, methinks, \| wast thou paid for the wrong,  
Nor wast righted an inch, poor wretch."

Freyr spake:  
41. "By the mouth of the river \| the wolf remains

\[38. Snorri mentions Tyr's incompetence as a peacemaker. *Fenrir*: the
wolf, Loki's son; cf. *Voluspo*, 39.

39\. *Hrothvitnir* ("The Mighty Wolf"): Fenrir, who awaits in chains the
final battle and death at the hands of Vithar. The manuscript has a
metrical error in line 3, which has led to various emendations, all with
much the same meaning.

40\. *Thy wife*: there is no other reference to Tyr's wife, nor do we
know who was the son in question.\]

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

Till the gods to destruction go;  
Thou too shalt soon, \| if thy tongue is not stilled,  
Be fettered, thou forger of ill."

Loki spake:  
42. "The daughter of Gymir \| with gold didst thou buy,  
And sold thy sword to boot;  
But when Muspell's sons \| through Myrkwood ride,  
Thou shalt weaponless wait, poor wretch."

Byggvir spake:  
43. "Had I birth so famous \| as Ingunar-Freyr,  
And sat in so lofty a seat,

\[41. *The mouth of the river*: according to Snorri, the chained Fenrir
"roars horribly, and the slaver runs from his mouth, and makes the river
called Vam; he lies there till the doom of the gods." Freyr's threat is
actually carried out; cf. concluding prose.

42\. *The daughter of Gymir*: Gerth, heroine of the *Skirnismol*, which
gives the details of Freyr's loss of his sword. *Muspell's sons*: the
name Muspell is not used elsewhere in the poems; Snorri uses it
frequently, but only in this same phrase, "Muspell's sons." They are the
dwellers in the fire-world, Muspellsheim, led by Surt against the gods
in the last battle; cf. Voluspo, 47 and 52 and notes. *Myrkwood*: here
the dark forest bounding the fire-world; in the *Atlakvitha* (stanza 3)
the name is used of another boundary forest.

43\. *Byggvir*: one of Freyr's two servants; cf. introductory prose.
*Ingunar-Freyr*: the name is not used elsewhere in the poems, or by
Snorri; it may be the genitive of a woman's name, Ingun, the unknown
sister of Njorth who was Freyr's mother (cf. stanza 36), or a corruption
of the name Ingw, used for Freyr (Fro) in old German mythology.\]

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

I would crush to marrow \| this croaker of ill,  
And beat all his body to bits."

Loki spake:  
44. "What little creature \| goes crawling there,  
Snuffling and snapping about?  
At Freyr's ears ever \| wilt thou be found,  
Or muttering hard at the mill."

Byggvir spake:  
45. "Byggvir my name, \| and nimble am I,  
As gods and men do grant;  
And here am I proud \| that the children of Hropt  
Together all drink ale."

Loki spake:  
46. "Be silent, Byggvir! \| thou never couldst set  
Their shares of the meat for men;  
Hid in straw on the floor, \| they found thee not  
When heroes were fain to fight."

Heimdall spake:  
47. "Drunk art thou, Loki, \| and mad are thy deeds,  
Why, Loki, leavst thou this not?

\[44. Beginning with this stanza, the names of the speakers are lacking
in the manuscript. *The mill*: i.e., at slaves' tasks.

45\. Nothing further is known of either Byggvir's swiftness or his
cowardice. *Hropt*: Othin.

47\. *Heimdall*: besides being the watchman of the gods (cf. *Voluspo*,
27), he appears also as the god of light (cf. *Thrymskvitha*, 14), and
possibly also as a complex cultural deity in the \[fp. 167\]
*Rigsthula*. He was a son of Othin, born of nine sisters; cf.
*Hyndluljoth*, 37-40. In the last battle he and Loki slay one an other.
Line 2 is quoted by Snorri; cf. stanza 29, note.\]

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

For drink beyond measure \| will lead all men  
No thought of their tongues to take."

Loki spake:  
48. "Be silent, Heimdall! \| in days long since  
Was an evil fate for thee fixed;  
With back held stiff \| must thou ever stand,  
As warder of heaven to watch."

Skathi spake:  
49. "Light art thou, Loki, \| but longer thou mayst not  
In freedom flourish thy tail;  
On the rocks the gods bind thee \| with bowels torn  
Forth from thy frost-cold son."

Loki spake:  
50. "Though on rocks the gods bind me \| with bowels torn  
Forth from my frost-cold son,

\[49. Skathi: the wife of Njorth, and daughter of the giant Thjazi,
concerning whose death cf. *Harbarthsljoth*, 19, note. Bowels, etc.:
according to the prose note at the end of the *Lokasenna*, the gods
bound Loki with the bowels of his son Vali, and changed his other son,
Narfi, into a wolf. Snorri turns the story about Vali being the wolf,
who tears his brother to pieces, the gods then using Narfi's intestines
to bind Loki. Narfi--and presumably Vali--were the sons of Loki and his
wife, Sigyn. They appear only in this episode, though Narfi (or Nari) is
named by Snorri in his list of Loki's children. Cf. concluding prose,
and note.\]

I was first and last \| at the deadly fight  
There where Thjazi we caught."

Skathi spake:  
51. "Wert thou first and last \| at the deadly fight  
There where Thjazi was caught,  
From my dwellings and fields \| shall ever come forth  
A counsel cold for thee."

Loki spake:  
52. "More lightly thou spakest \| with Laufey's son,  
When thou badst me come to thy bed;  
Such things must be known \| if now we two  
Shall seek our sins to tell."

Then Sif came forward and poured mead for Loki in a crystal cup, and
said:

53\. "Hail too thee, Loki, \| and take thou here  
The crystal cup of old mead;  
For me at least, \| alone of the gods,  
Blameless thou knowest to be."

\[52. *Laufey's son*: Loki; not much is known of his parents beyond
their names. His father was the giant Farbauti, his mother Laufey,
sometimes called Nal. There is an elaborate but far fetched hypothesis
explaining these three on the basis of a nature-myth. 'There is no other
reference to such a relation between Skathi and Loki as he here
suggests.

53\. *Sif*: Thor's wife; cf. *Harbarthsljoth*, 48, where her infidelity
is again mentioned. The manuscript omits the proper name \[fp. 169\]
from the preceding prose, and a few editors have, obviously in error,
attributed the speech to Beyla.\]

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

He took the horn, and drank therefrom:

54\. "Alone thou wert \| if truly thou wouldst  
All men so shyly shun;  
But one do I know \| full well, methinks,  
Who had thee from Hlorrithi's arms,--  
(Loki the crafty in lies.)"

Beyla spake:  
55. "The mountains shake, \| and surely I think  
From his home comes Hlorrithi now;  
He will silence the man \| who is slandering here  
Together both gods and men."

Loki spake:  
56. "Be silent, Beyla! \| thou art Byggvir's wife,  
And deep art thou steeped in sin;  
A greater shame \| to the gods came ne'er,  
Befouled thou art with thy filth."

Then came Thor forth, and spake:

57\. "Unmanly one, cease, \| or the mighty hammer,  
Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;

\[54. *Hlorrithi*: Thor. Line 5 is probably spurious.

55\. *Beyla*: Freyr's servant, wife of Byggvir; cf. introductory prose
and note.

57\. *Mjollnir*: concerning Thor's famous hammer see particularly
*Thrymskvitha*, 1 and note. *Shoulder-cliff*: head; concerning \[fp.
170\] the use of such diction in the *Edda*, cf. introductory note to
*Hymiskvitha*. The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a
stanza, but this is apparently a scribal error.\]

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

Thy shoulder-cliff \| shall I cleave from thy neck,  
And so shall thy life be lost."

Loki spake:  
58. "Lo, in has come \| the son of Earth:  
Why threaten so loudly, Thor?  
Less fierce thou shalt go \| to fight with the wolf  
When he swallows Sigfather up."

Thor spake:  
59. "Unmanly one, cease, \| or the mighty hammer,  
Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;  
I shall hurl thee up \| and out in the East,  
Where men shall see thee no more."

Loki spake:  
60. "That thou hast fared \| on the East-road forth  
To men shouldst thou say no more;

\[58. *Son of Earth*: Thor, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth). The
manuscript omits the word "son," but all editors have agreed in
supplying it. *The wolf*: Fenrir, Loki's son, who slays Othin
(Sigfather: "Father of Victory") in the final battle. Thor, according to
Snorri and to the Voluspo, 56, fights with Mithgarthsorm and not with
Fenrir, who is killed by Vithar.

59\. Lines 1-2 are abbreviated in the manuscript, as also in stanzas 61
and 63.

60\. Loki's taunt that Thor hid in the thumb of Skrymir's glove is
similar to that of Othin, *Harbarthsljoth*, 26, in the note to which the
story is outlined. Line 4 is identical with line 5 of *Harbarthsljoth*,
26.\]

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

In the thumb of a glove \| didst thou hide, thou great one,  
And there forgot thou wast Thor."

Thor spake:  
61. "Unmanly one, cease, \| or the mighty hammer,  
Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;  
My right hand shall smite thee \| with Hrungnir's slayer,  
Till all thy bones are broken."

Loki spake:  
62. "Along time still \| do I think to live,  
Though thou threatenest thus with thy hammer;  
Rough seemed the straps \| of Skrymir's wallet,  
When thy meat thou mightest not get,  
(And faint from hunger didst feel.)"

Thor spake:  
63. "Unmanly one, cease, \| or the mighty hammer,  
Mjollnir, shall close thy mouth;

\[61. *Hrungnir's slayer*: the hammer; the story of how Thor slew this
stone-headed giant is indicated in *Harbarthsljoth*, 14-15, and outlined
in the note to stanza 14 of that poem.

62\. On the day following the adventure of the glove, Thor, Loki and
Thor's servants proceed on their way in company with Skrymir, who puts
all their food in his wallet. At evening Skrymir goes to sleep, and Thor
tries to get at the food, but cannot loosen the straps of the wallet. In
a rage he smites Skrymir three times on the head with his hammer, but
the giant--who, it subsequently appears, deftly dodges the blows--is
totally undisturbed. Line 5 may well be spurious.\]

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

The slayer of Hrungnir \| shall send thee to hell,  
And down to the gate of death."

Loki spake:  
64. "'1 have said to the gods \| and the sons of the god,  
The things that whetted my thoughts;  
But before thee alone \| do I now go forth,  
For thou fightest well, I ween.

65\. "Ale hast thou brewed, \| but, Ægir, now  
Such feasts shalt thou make no more;  
O'er all that thou hast \| which is here within  
Shall play the flickering flames,  
(And thy back shall be burnt with fire.)"

And after that Loki hid himself in Franang's waterfall in the guise of a
salmon, and there the gods took him. He was bound with the bowels of his
son Vali, but his son Narfi was changed to a wolf. Skathi took a
poison-snake and fastened it up over Loki's face, and the poison dropped
thereon. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat there and held a shell under the
poison, but when the shell was full she bore away the poison, and
meanwhile the poison dropped on Loki. Then he struggled so hard that the
whole earth shook therewith; and now that is called an earthquake.

\[65. *The flames*: the fire that consumes the world on the last day;
cf. *Voluspo*, 57. Line 5 may be spurious.

Prose: Snorri tells the same story, with minor differences, but makes it
the consequence of Loki's part in the slaying of Baldr, which
undoubtedly represents the correct tradition. The compiler of the poems
either was confused or thought the incident was \[fp. 173\] useful as
indicating what finally happened to Loki. Possibly he did not mean to
imply that Loki's fate was brought upon him by his abuse of the gods,
but simply tried to round out the story. *Franang*: "Gleaming Water."
*Vali and Narfi*: cf. stanza 49 and note. *Sigyn*: cf. *Voluspo*, 35,
the only other place where she is mentioned in the poems. Snorri omits
the naive note about earth quakes, his narrative ending with the words,
"And there he lies till the destruction of the gods."\]
