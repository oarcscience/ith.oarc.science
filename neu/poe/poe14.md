# RIGSTHULA

### The Song of Rig

##### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The *Rigsthula* is found in neither of the principal codices. The only
manuscript containing it is the so-called *Codex Wormanius*, a
manuscript of Snorri's *Prose Edda*. The poem appears on the last sheet
of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of
the poem is lacking. In the *Codex Wormanius* itself the poem has no
title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the
*Rigsthula*. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of *Rigsmol*.

The *Rigsthula* is essentially unlike anything else which editors have
agreed to include in the so-called *Edda*. It is a definitely cultural
poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different
castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors.
From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a
king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate.
This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the *Rigsthula* was
not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with
profound disapproval.

Not only does the *Rigsthula* praise royalty, but it has many of the
earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king. The
manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the
connection between the mythical "Young Kon" (Konr ungr, konungr, "king";
but cf. stanza 44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be
established. Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland,
Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king
leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced
by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that
such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent,
the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson's
claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in
question, is much less impressive than Mogk's ingenious demonstration
that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of
either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on
the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to
that stanza.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering
Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent
much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by
Celts. The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a
matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims almost all the
poems for the "Western Isles," and attributes nearly all their good
qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the
details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative
opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the
poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of
Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the "Western Isles," and
particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of
an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.

In the case of the *Rigsthula* the poet unquestionably had not only
picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost
certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words
employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit.
This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse
poetry in general. On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously
Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an
itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands,
and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the
ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced
into Denmark around 960, the *Rigsthula* is not likely to have been
composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of
the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was
succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.

The fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig
with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little
anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had
Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin
of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The evidence bearing on
this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory
prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems
in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was
unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall,
went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where
he called himself Rig. According to these stories is the following poem:

1\. Men say there went \| by ways so green  
Of old the god, \| the aged and wise,  
Mighty and strong \| did Rig go striding.  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .

\[*Prose*. It would be interesting to know how much the annotator meant
by the phrase *old stories*. Was he familiar with the tradition in forms
other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty,
for, outside of identifying *Rig* as *Heimdall*, he provides no
information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer to
the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig
as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of
his own. The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even
later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any
considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor the
identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a
few rather vague passages in the other poems. Thus in *Voluspo*, I, the
Volva asks hearing "from Heimdall's sons both high and low"; in
*Grimnismol*, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that
Heimdall "o'er men holds sway, it is said," and in "the Short Voluspo"
(*Hyndluljoth*, 40) he is called "the kinsman of men." On the other
hand, everything in the *Rigsthula*, including the phrase "the aged and
wise" in stanza I, and the references to runes in stanzas 36, 44, and
46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the annotator
was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. *Rig*: almost
certainly based on the Old Irish word for "king," "ri" or "rig."

1\. No gap is indicated, but editors have generally assumed one. Some
editors, however, add line 1 of stanza 2 to stanza 1.\]

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

2\. Forward he went \| on the midmost way,  
He came to a dwelling, \| a door on its posts;  
In did he fare, \| on the floor was a fire,  
Two hoary ones \| by the hearth there sat,  
Ai and Edda, \| in olden dress.

3\. Rig knew well \| wise words to speak,  
Soon in the midst \| of the room he sat,  
And on either side \| the others were.

4\. A loaf of bread \| did Edda bring,  
Heavy and thick \| and swollen with husks;  
Forth on the table \| she set the fare,  
And broth for the meal \| in a bowl there was.  
(Calf's flesh boiled \| was the best of the dainties.)

5\. Rig knew well \| wise words to speak,  
Thence did he rise, \| made ready to sleep;  
Soon in the bed \| himself did he lay,  
And on either side \| the others were.

\[2. Most editions make line 5 a part of the stanza, as here, but some
indicate it as the sole remnant of one or more stanzas descriptive of Ai
and Edda, just as Afi and Amma, Fathir and Mothir, are later described.
*Ai and Edda*: Great-Grandfather and Great-Grandmother; the latter name
was responsible for Jakob Grimm's famous guess at the meaning of the
word "Edda" as applied to the whole collection (cf. Introduction).

3\. A line may have been lost from this stanza.

4\. Line 5 has generally been rejected as spurious.

5\. The manuscript has lines 1-2 in inverse order, but marks the word
"Rig" as the beginning of a stanza.\]

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

6\. Thus was he there \| for three nights long,  
Then forward he went \| on the midmost way,  
And so nine months \| were soon passed by.

7\. A son bore Edda, \| with water they sprinkled him,  
With a cloth his hair \| so black they covered;  
Thræll they named him, \|     .    .    .    .    .

8\. The skin was wrinkled \| and rough on his hands,  
Knotted his knuckles, \|     .    .    .    .    .  
Thick his fingers, \| and ugly his face,  
Twisted his back, \| and big his heels.

9\. He began to grow, \| and to gain in strength,  
Soon of his might \| good use he made;

\[6. The manuscript does not indicate that these lines form a separate
stanza, and as only one line and a fragment of another are left of
stanza 7, the editions have grouped the lines in all sorts of ways,
with, of course, various conjectures as to where lines may have been
lost.

7\. After line 1 the manuscript has only four words: "cloth," "black,"
"named," and "Thræll." No gap is anywhere indicated. Editors have pieced
out the passage in various ways. *Water*, etc.: concerning the custom of
sprinkling water on children, which long antedated the introduction of
Christianity, cf. *Hovamol*, 159 and note. *Black*: dark hair, among the
blond Scandinavians, was the mark of a foreigner, hence of a slave.
*Thræll*: Thrall or Slave.

8\. In the manuscript line 1 of stanza 9 stands before stanza 8, neither
line being capitalized as the beginning of a stanza. I have followed
Bugge's rearrangement. The manuscript indicates no gap in line 2, but
nearly all editors have assumed one, Grundtvig supplying "and rough his
nails."

9\. The manuscript marks line 2 as the beginning of a stanza.\]

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

With bast he bound, \| and burdens carried,  
Home bore faggots \| the whole day long.

10\. One came to their home, \| crooked her legs,  
Stained were her feet, \| and sunburned her arms,  
Flat was her nose; \| her name was Thir.

11\. Soon in the midst \| of the room she sat,  
By her side there sat \| the son of the house;  
They whispered both, \| and the bed made ready,  
Thræll and Thir, \| till the day was through.

12\. Children they had, \| they lived and were happy,  
Fjosnir and Klur \| they were called, methinks,  
Hreim and Kleggi, \| Kefsir, Fulnir,  
Drumb, Digraldi, \| Drott and Leggjaldi,  
Lut and Hosvir; \| the house they cared for,  
Ground they dunged, \| and swine they guarded,  
Goats they tended, \| and turf they dug.

\[10. A line may well have dropped out, but the manuscript is too
uncertain as to the stanza-divisions to make any guess safe. *Crooked*:
the word in the original is obscure. *Stained*: literally, "water was on
her soles." *Thir*: "Serving-Woman."

12\. There is some confusion as to the arrangement of th lines and
division into stanzas of 12 and 13. The names mean: *Fjosnir*,
"Cattle-Man"; *Klur*, "The Coarse"; *Hreim*, "The Shouter"; *Kleggi*,
"The Horse-Fly"; *Kefsir*, "Concubine-Keeper"; *Fulnir*, "The Stinking";
*Drumb*, "The Log"; *Digraldi*, "The Fat"; *Drott*, "The Sluggard";
*Leggjaldi*, "The Big-Legged"; *Lut*, "The Bent"; *Hosvir*, "The
Grey."\]

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

13\. Daughters had they, \| Drumba and Kumba,  
Ökkvinkalfa, \| Arinnefla,  
Ysja and Ambott, \| Eikintjasna,  
Totrughypja \| and Tronubeina;  
And thence has risen \| the race of thralls.

14\. Forward went Rig, \| his road was straight,  
To a hall he came, \| and a door there hung;  
In did he fare, \| on the floor was a fire:  
Afi and Amma \| owned the house.

15\. There sat the twain, \| and worked at their tasks:  
The man hewed wood \| for the weaver's beam;  
His beard was trimmed, \| o'er his brow a curl,  
His clothes fitted close; \| in the corner a chest.

16\. The woman sat \| and the distaff wielded,  
At the weaving with arms \| outstretched she worked;  
On her head was a band, \| on her breast a smock;  
On her shoulders a kerchief \| with clasps there was.

\[13. The names mean: *Drumba*, "The Log"; *Kumba*, "The Stumpy";
*Ökkvinkalfa*, "Fat-Legged"; *Arinnefla*, "Homely Nosed"; *Ysja*, "The
Noisy"; *Ambott*, "The Servant"; *Eikintjasna*, "The Oaken Peg" (?);
*Totrughypja*, "Clothed in Rags"; *Tronubeina*, "Crane-Legged."

14\. In the manuscript line 4 stands after line 4 of stanza 16, but
several editors have rearranged the lines, as here. *Afi and Amma*:
Grandfather and Grandmother.

15\. There is considerable confusion among the editors as to where this
stanza begins and ends.

16\. The manuscript marks line 3 as the beginning of a stanza.\]

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

17\. Rig knew well \| wise words to speak,  
Soon in the midst \| of the room he sat,  
And on either side \| the others were.

18\. Then took Amma \|     .    .    .    .    .  
The vessels full \| with the fare she set,  
Calf's flesh boiled \| was the best of the dainties.

19\. Rig knew well \| wise words to speak,  
He rose from the board, \| made ready to sleep;  
Soon in the bed \| himself did he lay,  
And on either side \| the others were.

20\. Thus was he there \| for three nights long,  
Then forward he went \| on the midmost way,  
And so nine months \| were soon passed by.

21\. A son bore Amma, \| with water they sprinkled him,  
Karl they named him; \| in a cloth she wrapped him,  
He was ruddy of face, \| and flashing his eyes.

\[17. The manuscript jumps from stanza 17, line I, to stanza 19, line 2.
Bugge points out that the copyist's eye was presumably led astray by the
fact that 17, I, and 19, I, were identical. Lines 2-3 of 17 are supplied
from stanzas 3 and 29.

18\. I have followed Bugge's conjectural construction of the missing
stanza, taking lines 2 and 3 from stanzas 31 and 4.

19\. The manuscript marks line 2 as the beginning of a stanza.

20\. The manuscript omits line 2, supplied by analogy with stanza 6.\]

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

22\. He began to grow, \| and to gain in strength,  
Oxen he ruled, \| and plows made ready,  
Houses he built, \| and barns he fashioned,  
Carts he made, \| and the plow he managed.

23\. Home did they bring \| the bride for Karl,  
In goatskins clad, \| and keys she bore;  
Snör was her name, \| 'neath the veil she sat;  
A home they made ready, \| and rings exchanged,  
The bed they decked, \| and a dwelling made.

24\. Sons they had, \| they lived and were happy:  
Hal and Dreng, \| Holth, Thegn and Smith,  
Breith and Bondi, \| Bundinskeggi,  
Bui and Boddi, \| Brattskegg and Segg.

\[21. Most editors assume a lacuna, after either line 2 or line 3.
Sijmons assumes, on the analogy of stanza 8, that a complete stanza
describing *Karl* ("Yeoman") has been lost between stanzas 21 and 22.

22\. No line Indicated in the manuscript as beginning a stanza. *Cart*:
the word in the original, "kartr," is one of the clear signs of the
Celtic influence noted in the introduction.

23\. *Bring*: the word literally means "drove in a wagon"--a mark of the
bride's social status. *Snör*: "Daughter-in-Law." Bugge, followed by
several editors, maintains that line 4 was wrongly interpolated here
from a missing stanza describing the marriage of Kon.

24\. No line indicated in the manuscript as beginning a stanza. The
names mean: *Hal*, "Man"; *Dreng*, "The Strong"; *Holth*, "The Holder of
Land"; *Thegn*, "Freeman"; *Smith*, "Craftsman"; *Breith*, "The
Broad-Shouldered"; *Bondi*, "Yeoman"; *Bundinskeggi*, "With Beard Bound"
(i.e., not allowed to hang unkempt); *Bui*, "Dwelling-Owner"; *Boddi*,
"Farm-Holder"; *Brattskegg*, "With Beard Carried High"; *Segg*, "Man."\]

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

25\. Daughters they had, \| and their names are here:  
Snot, Bruth, Svanni, \| Svarri, Sprakki,  
Fljoth, Sprund and Vif, \| Feima, Ristil:  
And thence has risen \| the yeomen's race.

26\. Thence went Rig, \| his road was straight,  
A hall he saw, \| the doors faced south;  
The portal stood wide, \| on the posts was a ring,  
Then in he fared; \| the floor was strewn.

27\. Within two gazed \| in each other's eyes,  
Fathir and Mothir, \| and played with their fingers;  
There sat the house-lord, \| wound strings for the bow,  
Shafts he fashioned, \| and bows he shaped.

28\. The lady sat, \| at her arms she looked,  
She smoothed the cloth, \| and fitted the sleeves;  
Gay was her cap, \| on her breast were clasps,  
Broad was her train, \| of blue was her gown,

\[25. No line indicated in the manuscript as beginning a stanza. The
names mean: *Snot*, "Worthy Woman"; *Bruth*, "Bride"; *Svanni*, "The
Slender"; *Svarri*, "The Proud"; *Sprakki*, "The Fair"; *Fljoth*,
"Woman" (?); *Sprund*, "The Proud"; *Vif*, "Wife"; *Feima*, "The
Bashful"; *Ristil*, "The Graceful."

26\. Many editors make a stanza out of line 4 and lines 1-2 of the
following stanza. *Strewn*: with fresh straw in preparation for a feast;
cf. *Thrymskvitha*, 22.

27\. *Fathir and Mothir*: Father and Mother. Perhaps lines 3-4 should
form a stanza with 28, 1-3.

28\. Bugge thinks lines 5-6, like 23, 4, got in here from the lost
stanzas describing Kon's bride and his marriage.\]

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

Her brows were bright, \| her breast was shining,  
Whiter her neck \| than new-fallen snow.

29\. Rig knew \| well wise words to speak,  
Soon in the midst \| of the room he sat,  
And on either side \| the others were.

30\. Then Mothir brought \| a broidered cloth,  
Of linen bright, \| and the board she covered;  
And then she took \| the loaves so thin,  
And laid them, white \| from the wheat, on the cloth.

31\. Then forth she brought \| the vessels full,  
With silver covered, \| and set before them,  
Meat all browned, \| and well-cooked birds;  
In the pitcher was wine, \| of plate were the cups,  
So drank they and talked \| till the day was gone.

32\. Rig knew well \| wise words to speak,  
Soon did he rise, \| made ready to sleep;  
So in the bed \| himself did he lay,  
And on either side \| the others were.

\[31. The manuscript of lines 1-3 is obviously defective, as there are
too many words for two lines, and not enough for the full three. The
meaning, however, is clearly very much as indicated in the translation.
Gering's emendation, which I have followed, consists simply in shifting
"set before them" from the first line to the second--where the
manuscript has no verb,--and supplying the verb "brought" in line 1. The
various editions contain all sorts of suggestions.

32\. The manuscript begins both line 1 and line 2 with a capital \[fp.
212\] preceded by a period, which has led to all sorts of strange
stanza-combinations and guesses at lost lines in the various editions.
The confusion includes stanza 33, wherein no line is marked in the
manuscript as beginning a stanza.\]

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

33\. Thus was he there \| for three nights long,  
Then forward he went \| on the midmost way,  
And so nine months \| were soon passed by.

34\. A son had Mothir, \| in silk they wrapped him,  
With water they sprinkled him, \| Jarl he was;  
Blond was his hair, \| and bright his cheeks,  
Grim as a snake's \| were his glowing eyes.

35\. To grow in the house \| did Jarl begin,  
Shields he brandished, \| and bow-strings wound,  
Bows he shot, \| and shafts he fashioned,  
Arrows he loosened, \| and lances wielded,  
Horses he rode, \| and hounds unleashed,  
Swords he handled, \| and sounds he swam.

36\. Straight from the grove \| came striding Rig,  
Rig came striding, \| and runes he taught him;  
By his name he called him, \| as son he claimed him,

\[34. *Jarl*: "Nobly-Born."

35\. Various lines have been regarded as interpolations, 3 and 6 being
most often thus rejected.

36\. Lines I, 2, and 5 all begin with capitals preceded by periods, a
fact which, taken in conjunction with the obviously defective state of
the following stanza, has led to all sorts of conjectural emendations.
The exact significance of Rig's giving his own name to Jarl (cf. stanza
46), and thus recognizing him, potentially at least, as a king, depends
on the conditions under \[fp. 213\] which the poem was composed (cf.
Introductory Note). The whole stanza, particularly the reference to the
teaching of magic (runes), fits Othin far better than Heimdall.\]

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

And bade him hold \| his heritage wide,  
His heritage wide, \| the ancient homes.

37\. .    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
Forward he rode \| through the forest dark,  
O'er the frosty crags, \| till a hall he found.

38\. His spear he shook, \| his shield he brandished,  
His horse he spurred, \| with his sword he hewed;  
Wars he raised, \| and reddened the field,  
Warriors slew he, \| and land he won.

39\. Eighteen halls \| ere long did he hold,  
Wealth did he get, \| and gave to all,  
Stones and jewels \| and slim-flanked steeds,  
Rings he offered, \| and arm-rings shared.

40\. His messengers went \| by the ways so wet,  
And came to the hall \| where Hersir dwelt;  
His daughter was fair \| and slender-fingered,  
Erna the wise \| the maiden was.

\[37. Something--one or two lines, or a longer passage--has clearly been
lost, describing the beginning of Jarl's journey. Yet many editors,
relying on the manuscript punctuation, make 37 and 38 into a single
stanza.

39\. The manuscript marks both lines 1 and 2 as beginning stanzas.

40\. *Hersir*: "Lord"; the hersir was, in the early days before the
establishment of a kingdom in Norway, the local chief, and \[fp. 214\]
hence the highest recognized authority. During and after the time of
Harald the Fair-Haired the name lost something of its distinction, the
hersir coming to take rank below the jarl. *Erna*: "The Capable."\]

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

41\. Her hand they sought, \| and home they brought her,  
Wedded to Jarl \| the veil she wore;  
Together they dwelt, \| their joy was great,  
Children they had, \| and happy they lived.

42\. Bur was the eldest, \| and Barn the next,  
Joth and Athal, \| Arfi, Mog,  
Nith and Svein, \| soon they began-  
Sun and Nithjung-- \| to play and swim;  
Kund was one, \| and the youngest Kon.

43\. Soon grew up \| the sons of Jarl,  
Beasts they tamed, \| and bucklers rounded,  
Shafts they fashioned, \| and spears they shook.

44\. But Kon the Young \| learned runes to use,  
Runes everlasting, \| the runes of life;

\[42. The names mean: *Bur*, "Son"; *Barn*, "Child"; *Joth*, "Child";
*Athal*, "Offspring"; *Arfi*, "Heir"; *Mog*, "Son"; *Nith*,
"Descendant"; *Svein*, "Boy"; *Sun*, "Son"; *Nithjung*, "Descend ant";
*Kund*, "Kinsman"; *Kon*, "Son" (of noble birth). Concerning the use
made of this last name, see note on stanza 44. It is curious that there
is no list of the daughters of Jarl and Erna, and accordingly Vigfusson
inserts here the names listed in stanza 25. Grundtvig rearranges the
lines of stanzas 42 and 43.

44\. The manuscript indicates no line as beginning a stanza. Kon the
Young: a remarkable bit of fanciful etymology; the \[fp. 215\] phrase is
"Konr ungr," which could readily be contracted into "Konungr," the
regular word meaning "king." The "kon" part is actually not far out, but
the second syllable of "konungr" has nothing to do with "ungr" meaning
"young." *Runes*: a long list of just such magic charms, dulling
swordblades, quenching flames, and so on, is given in *Hovamol*,
147-163.\]

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

Soon could he well \| the warriors shield,  
Dull the swordblade, \| and still the seas.

45\. Bird-chatter learned he, \| flames could he lessen.,  
Minds could quiet, \| and sorrows calm;  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
The might and strength \| of twice four men.

46\. With Rig-Jarl soon \| the runes he shared,  
More crafty he was, \| and greater his wisdom;  
The right he sought, \| and soon he won it,  
Rig to be called, \| and runes to know.

47\. Young Kon rode forth \| through forest and grove,  
Shafts let loose, \| and birds he lured;  
There spake a crow \| on a bough that sat:  
"Why lurest thou, Kon, \| the birds to come?

\[45. The manuscript indicates no line as beginning a stanza. *Minds*:
possibly "seas,"' the word being doubtful. Most editors assume the gap
as indicated.

4.6. The manuscript indicates no line as beginning a stanza. *Rig-Jarl*:
Kon's father; cf. stanza 36.

47\. This stanza has often been combined with 48, either as a whole or
in part. *Crow*: birds frequently play the part of mentor in Norse
literature; cf., for example, *Helgakvitha Hundingsbana* I, 5, and
*Fafnismol*, 32.\]

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

48\. " 'Twere better forth \| on thy steed to fare,  
    .    .    .    .    . \| and the host to slay.

49\. "The halls of Dan \| and Danp are noble,  
Greater their wealth \| than thou bast gained;  
Good are they \| at guiding the keel,  
Trying of weapons, \| and giving of wounds.

\[48. This fragment is not indicated as a separate stanza in the
manuscript. Perhaps half a line has disappeared, or, as seems more
likely, the gap includes two lines and a half. Sijmons actually
constructs these lines, largely on the basis of stanzas 35 and 38, Bugge
fills in the half-line lacuna as indicated above with "The sword to
wield."

49\. *Dan and Danp*: These names are largely responsible for the theory
that the *Rigsthula* was composed in Denmark. According to the Latin
epitome of the *Skjöldungasaga* by Arngrimur Jonsson, "Rig (Rigus) was a
man not the least among the great ones of his time. He married the
daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and
later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his
son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called
Danes." This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that
the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.\]
