# GUTHRUNARHVOT

### Guthrun's Inciting

##### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

The two concluding poems in the *Codex Regius*, the *Guthrunarhvot*
(*Guthrun's Inciting*) and the *Hamthesmol* (*The Ballad of Hamther*),
belong to a narrative cycle connected with those of Sigurth, the
Burgundians, and Atli (cf. *Gripisspo*, introductory note) by only the
slenderest of threads. Of the three early historical kings who gradually
assumed a dominant place in Germanic legend, Ermanarich, king of the
East Goths in the middle of the fourth century, was actually the least
important, even though Jordanes, the sixth century author of *De Rebus
Getecis*, compared him to Alexander the Great. Memories of his cruelty
and of his tragic death, however, persisted along with the real glories
of Theoderich, a century and a half later, and of the conquests of
Attila, whose lifetime approximately bridged the gap between
Ermanarich's death and Theoderich's birth.

Chief among the popular tales of Ermanarich's cruelty was one concerning
the death of a certain Sunilda or Sanielh, whom, according to Jordanes,
he caused to be torn asunder by wild horses because of her husband's
treachery. Her brothers, Sarus and Ammius, seeking to avenge her,
wounded but failed to kill Ermanarich. In this story is the root of the
two Norse poems included in the *Codex Regius*. Sunilda easily became
the wife as well as the victim of the tyrant, and, by the process of
legend-blending so frequently observed, the story was connected with the
more famous one of the Nibelungs by making her the daughter of Sigurth
and Guthrun. To account for her brothers, a third husband had to be
found for Guthrun; the Sarus and Ammius of Jordanes are obviously the
Sorli and Hamther, sons of Guthrun and Jonak, of the Norse poems. The
blending of the Sigurth and Ermanarich legends probably, though not
certainly, took place before the story reached the North, in other words
before the end of the eighth century.

Regarding the exact status of the *Guthrunarhvot* and the *Hamthesmol*
there has been a great deal of discussion. That they are closely related
is obvious; indeed the first parts of the two poems are nearly identical
in content and occasionally so in actual diction. The annotator, in his
concluding prose note, refers to

<span id="page_537">p. 537</span>

the second poem as the "old" ballad of Hamther, wherefore it has been
assumed by some critics that the composer of the *Guthrunarhvot* used
the *Hamthesmol*, approximately as it now stands, as the source of part
of his material. The extant *Hamthesmol*, however, is almost certainly a
patchwork; part of it is in *Fornyrthislag* (cf. Introduction),
including most of the stanzas paralleled in the *Guthrunarhvot*, and
likewise the stanza followed directly by the reference to the "old"
ballad, while the rest is in Malahattr. The most reasonable theory,
therefore, is that there existed an old ballad of Hamther, all in
Fornyrthislag, from which the composer of the *Guthrunarhvot* borrowed a
few stanzas as the introduction for his poem, and which the composer of
the extant, or "new," *Hamthesmol* likewise used, though far more
clumsily.

The title "Guthrunarhvot," which appears in the *Codex Regius*, really
applies only to stanzas 1-8, all presumably borrowed from the "old"
ballad of Hamther. The rest of the poem is simply another Guthrun
lament, following the tradition exemplified by the first and second
Guthrun lays; it is possible, indeed, that it is made up of fragments of
two separate laments, one (stanzas 9-18) involving the story of
Svanhild's death, and the other (stanzas 19-21) coming from an otherwise
lost version of the story in which Guthrun closely follows Sigurth and
Brynhild in death. In any event the present title is really a misnomer;
the poet, who presumably was an eleventh century Icelander, used the
episode of Guthrun's inciting her sons to vengeance for the slaying of
Svanhild simply as an introduction to his main subject, the last lament
of the unhappy queen.

The text of the poem in *Regius* is by no means in good shape, and
editorial emendations have been many and varied, particularly in
interchanging lines between the *Guthrunarhvot* and the *Hamthesmol*.
The *Volsungasaga* paraphrases the poem with such fidelity as to prove
that it lay before the compilers of the saga approximately in its
present form.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Guthrun went forth to the sea after she had slain Atli. She went out
into the sea and fain would drown herself, but she could not sink. The
waves bore her across the

<span id="page_538">p. 538</span>

fjord to the land of King Jonak; he took her as wife; their sons were
Sorli and Erp and Hamther. There was brought up Svanhild, Sigurth's
daughter; she was married to the mighty Jormunrek. With him was Bikki,
who counselled that Randver, the king's son, should have her. This Bikki
told to the king. The king had Randver hanged, and Svanhild trodden to
death under horses' feet. And when Guthrun learned this, she spake with
her sons.

\[*Prose*. In the manuscript the prose is headed "Of Guthrun," the title
"Guthrunarhvot" preceding stanza 1. The prose introduction is used both
by Snorri (*Skaldskaparmal*, chapter 42) and in the *Volsungasaga*. It
would be interesting to know on what the annotator based this note, for
neither Bikki nor Randver is mentioned by name in either the
*Guthrunarhvot* or the *Hamthesmol*. On the prose notes in general, cf.
*Reginsmol*, introductory note. *Guthrun*: on the slaying of Atli by his
wife, Guthrun, Sigurth's widow, cf. *Atlamol*, 83-86 and notes. *Jonak*:
a Northern addition to the legend, introduced to account for Svanhild's
half-brothers; the name is apparently of Slavic origin. *Sorli*, *Erp*,
and *Hamther*: Sorli and Hamther are the Sarus and Ammius of the
Jordanes story (cf. introductory note). The *Volsungasaga* follows this
note in making Erp likewise a son of Guthrun, but in the *Hamthesmol* he
is a son of Jonak by another wife. *Svanhild*: cf. *Sigurtharkvitha en
skamma*, 54 and note. *Jormunrek* (Ermanarich): cf. introductory note.
*Bikki*: the Sifka or Sibicho of the Gothic legends of Ermanarich, whose
evil counsel always brings trouble. *Randver*: in the *Volsungasaga*
Jormunrek sends his son Randver with Bikki to seek Svanhild's hand. On
the voyage home Bikki says to Randver: "It were right for you to have so
fair a wife, and not such an old man." Randver was much pleased with
this advice, "and he spake to her with gladness, and she to him." Thus
the story becomes near of kin to those of Tristan and Iseult and Paolo
and Francesca. According to the *Volsungasaga*, Bikki told Ermanarich
that a guilty love existed between his son and his young wife, and
presumably the annotator here meant as much by his vague "this."\]

1\. A word-strife I learned, \| most woeful of all,  
A speech from the fullness \| of sorrow spoken,

4\. Then Hamther spake, \| the high of heart:

\[1. The poet's introduction of himself in this stanza is a fairly
certain indication of the relative lateness of the poem.

2\. *Idle*: a guess; a word is obviously missing in the original. The
manuscript marks line 5 as beginning a new stanza, and lines 5-6 may
well have been inserted from another part of the "old" *Hamthesmol* (cf.
*Hamthesmol*, 3).

3\. *Gunnar* and *Hogni*: cf. *Drap Niflunga*. Line 5 may be
interpolated. *Hunnish*: here used, as often, merely as a generic term
for all South Germanic peoples; the reference is to the Burgundian
Gunnar and Hogni.

4\. *Hamther*: some editions spell the name "Hamthir." *Sigurth*, etc.:
cf. *Sigurtharkvitha en skamma*, 21-24, and *Brot*, concluding prose.
This stanza has been subjected to many conjectural re-arrangements,
\[fp. 539\] some editors adding two or three lines from the
*Hamthesmol*.\]

<span id="page_540">p. 540</span>

When Sigurth they wakened \| from his sleep;  
Thy bed-covers white \| were red with blood  
Of thy husband, drenched \| with gore from his heart.

5\. "Bloody revenge \| didst have for thy brothers,  
Evil and sore, \| when thy sons didst slay;  
Else yet might we all \| on Jormunrek  
Together our sister's \| slaying avenge.

6\. .    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .  
The gear of the Hunnish \| kings now give us!  
Thou hast whetted us so \| to the battle of swords."

7\. Laughing did Guthrun \| go to her chamber,  
The helms of the kings \| from the cupboards she took,  
And mail-coats broad, \| to her sons she bore them;  
On their horses' backs \| the heroes leaped.

8\. Then Hamther spake, \| the high of heart:

\[5. *Bloody*: a guess; a word in the original is clearly missing, and
the same is true of all in line 3. *Thy sons*: i.e., by killing her sons
Erp and Eitil (cf. Atlamol, 72-74) Guthrun deprived Hamther, Sorli, and
the second Erp of valuable allies in avenging Svanhild's death.

6\. The manuscript indicates no gap, but most editors assume the loss of
one, two or even more lines before the two here given.

7\. The manuscript indicates line 4 as beginning a new stanza.

8\. Line 1, identical with line 1 of stanza 4, may be interpolated \[fp.
541\] here. *Spear-god*: warrior, i.e., Hamther himself. With this
stanza the introductory *hvot* ("inciting") ends, and stanza 9
introduces the lament which forms the real body of the poem.\]

<span id="page_541">p. 541</span>

"Homeward no more \| his mother to see  
Comes the spear-god, \| fallen mid Gothic folk;  
One death-draught thou \| for us all shalt drink,  
For Svanhild then \| and thy sons as well."

9\. Weeping Guthrun, \| Gjuki's daughter,  
Went sadly before \| the gate to sit,  
And with tear-stained cheeks \| to tell the tale  
Of her mighty griefs, \| so many in kind.

10\. "Three home-fires knew I, \| three hearths I knew,  
Home was I brought \| by husbands three;  
But Sigurth only \| of all was dear,  
He whom my brothers \| brought to his death.

11\. "A greater sorrow \| I saw not nor knew,  
Yet more it seemed \| I must suffer yet  
When the princes great \| to Atli gave me.

12\. "The brave boys I summoned \| to secret speech;  
For my woes requital \| I might not win  
Till off the heads \| of the Hniflungs I hewed.

\[11. Line 1 in the original is of uncertain meaning. Many editors
assume the loss of a line after line 1, and some completely reconstruct
line 1 on the basis of a hypothetical second line. *Princes*: Gunnar and
Hogni.

12\. Some editors assume the loss of one line, or more, before line 1.
*Hniflungs*: Erp and Eitil, the sons of Guthrun and Atli. On the
application of the name Niflung (or, as later spelt, \[fp. 542\]
Hniflung) to the descendants of Gjuki, Guthrun's father, cf. *Brot*, 17,

13\. "To the sea I went, \| my heart full sore  
For the Norns, whose wrath \| I would now escape;  
But the lofty billows \| bore me undrowned,  
Till to land I came, \| so I longer must live.

14\. "Then to the bed-- \| of old was it better!--  
Of a king of the folk \| a third time I came;  
Boys I bore \| his heirs to be,  
Heirs so young, \| the sons of Jonak.

15\. "But round Svanhild \| handmaidens sat,  
She was dearest ever \| of all my children;  
So did Svanhild \| seem in my hall  
As the ray of the sun \| is fair to see.

16\. "Gold I gave her \| and garments bright,  
Ere I let her go \| to the Gothic folk;  
Of my heavy woes \| the hardest it was  
When Svanhild's tresses \| fair were trodden  
In the mire by hoofs \| of horses wild.

17\. "The sorest it was \| when Sigurth mine

\[13. *Norns*: the fates; cf. *Voluspo*, 8 and note.

14\. The manuscript omits the first half of line 4.

16\. Some editors assume a gap of two lines after line 2, and make a
separate stanza of lines 3-5; Gering adds a sixth line of his own
coining, while Grundtvig inserts one between lines 3 and 4. The
manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza.

17\. The manuscript does not indicate line I as beginning a stanza (cf.
note on stanza 16). Stanzas 17 and 18 are very likely \[fp. 543\] later
interpolations, although the compilers of the *Volsungasaga* knew them
as they stand here. The whole passage depends on the shades of
difference in the meanings of the various superlatives: *harþastr*,
"hardest"; *sárastr*, "sorest"; *grimmastr*, "grimmest," and
*hvassastr*, "keenest." *Snakes*: cf. *Drap Niflunga*.\]

<span id="page_543">p. 543</span>

On his couch, of victory \| robbed, they killed;  
And grimmest of all \| when to Gunnar's heart  
There crept the bright-hued \| crawling snakes.

18\. "And keenest of all \| when they cut the heart  
From the living breast \| of the king so brave;  
Many woes I remember, \|     .    .    .    .    .  
.    .    .    .    .        .    .    .    .    .

19\. "Bridle, Sigurth, \| thy steed so black,  
Hither let run \| thy swift-faring horse;  
Here there sits not \| son or daughter  
Who yet to Guthrun \| gifts shall give.

\[18. *The king*: Hogni; cf. *Atlakvitha*, 25. The manuscript marks line
3 as beginning a new stanza. Most editors agree that there is a more or
less extensive gap after stanza 19, and some of them contend that the
original ending of the poem is lost, stanzas 19-21 coming from a
different poem, probably a lament closely following Sigurth's death.

19\. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza, and
it immediately follows the fragmentary line 3 of stanza 18. The
resemblance between stanzas 19-21 and stanzas 64-69 of *Sigurtharkvitha
en skamma* suggests that, in some other wise lost version of the story,
Guthrun, like Brynhild, sought to die soon after Sigurth's death. *Thy
steed*: Guthrun's appeal to the dead Sigurth to ride back to earth to
meet her is reminiscent of the episode related in *Helgakvitha
Hundingsbana II*, 39-48 The promise mentioned in stanza 20 is spoken of
elsewhere only in the *Volsungasaga* paraphrase of this passage.\]

<span id="page_544">p. 544</span>

20\. "Remember, Sigurth, \| what once we said,  
When together both \| on the bed we sat,  
That mightily thou \| to me wouldst come  
From hell and I \| from earth to thee.

21\. "Pile ye up, jarls, \| the pyre of oak,  
Make it the highest \| a hero e'er had;  
Let the fire burn \| my grief-filled breast,  
My sore-pressed heart, \| till my sorrows melt."

22\. May nobles all \| less sorrow know,  
And less the woes \| of women become,  
Since the tale of this \| lament is told.

\[21. Perhaps something has been lost between stanzas 20 and 21, or
possibly stanza 21, while belonging originally to the same poem as
stanzas 19 and 20, did not directly follow them. *Sore-pressed*: a
guess; a word seems to have been omitted in the original.

22\. Words of the poet's, like stanza 1, and perhaps constituting a
later addition. Many editors assume the loss of a line after line 3. The
meaning, of course, is that the poet hopes the story of Guthrun's woes
will make all other troubles seem light by comparison.\]
