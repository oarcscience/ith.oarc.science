# BALDRS DRAUMAR

### Baldr's Dreams

##### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Baldrs Draumar is found only in the *Arnamagnæan Codex*, where it
follows the *Harbarthsljoth* fragment. It is preserved in various late
paper manuscripts, with the title *Vegtamskvitha* (The Lay of Vegtam),
which has been used by some editors.

The poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been
preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it
closely with the Voluspo. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear,
almost without change, in the *Voluspo*, 32-33, and the entire poem is
simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding
stanzas. It has been suggested that *Baldrs Draumar* and the *Voluspo*
may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in
style between *Baldrs Draumar* and the *Thrymskvitha* (note especially
the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson's guess that these two
poems had a common authorship. In any case, *Baldrs Draumar* presumably
assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth
century.

Whether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker
in the *Voluspo* is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely
opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall
of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that
fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin,
anxious to know the meaning of Baldr's evil dreams; in the *Voluspo* it
is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.

The poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially
dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless
familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.

1\. Once were the gods \| together met,  
And the goddesses came \| and council held,

\[1. Lines 1-3 are identical with *Thrymskvitha*, 13, 1-3. *Baldr*:
concerning this best and noblest of the gods, the son of Othin and \[fp.
196\] Frigg, who comes again among the survivors after the final battle,
cf. *Voluspo*, 32 and 62, and notes. He is almost never mentioned
anywhere except in connection with the story of his death, though Snorri
has one short passage praising his virtue and beauty. After stanza 1 two
old editions, and one later one, insert four stanzas from late paper
manuscripts.\]

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

And the far-famed ones \| the truth would find,  
Why baleful dreams \| to Baldr had come.

2\. Then Othin rose, \| the enchanter old,  
And the saddle he laid \| on Sleipnir's back;  
Thence rode he down \| to Niflhel deep,  
And the hound he met \| that came from hell.

3\. Bloody he was \| on his breast before,  
At the father of magic \| he howled from afar;  
Forward rode Othin, \| the earth resounded  
Till the house so high \| of Hel he reached.

4\. Then Othin rode \| to the eastern door,  
There, he knew well, \| was the wise-woman's grave;  
Magic he spoke \| and mighty charms,  
Till spell-bound she rose, \| and in death she spoke:

\[2. *Sleipnir*: Othin's eight-legged horse, the son of Loki and the
stallion Svathilfari; cf. Lokasenna, 23, and *Grimnismol*, 44, and
notes. *Niflhel*: the murky ("nifl") dwelling of Hel, goddess of the
dead. *The hound*: Garm; cf. *Voluspo*, 44.

3\. *Father of magic*: Othin appears constantly as the god of magic.
*Hel*: offspring of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha, as were the wolf
Fenrir and Mithgarthsorm. She ruled the world of the unhappy dead,
either those who had led evil lives or, according to another tradition,
those who had not died in battle. The \[fp. 197\] manuscript marks line
3 as the beginning of a stanza, and thus the editions vary in their
grouping of the lines of this and the succeeding stanzas.\]

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

5\. "What is the man, \| to me unknown,  
That has made me travel \| the troublous road?  
I was snowed on with snow, \| and smitten with rain,  
And drenched with dew; \| long was I dead."

Othin spake:  
6. "Vegtam my name, \| I am Valtam's son;  
Speak thou of hell, \| for of heaven I know:  
For whom are the benches \| bright with rings,  
And the platforms gay \| bedecked with gold?"

The Wise-Woman spake:  
7. "Here for Baldr \| the mead is brewed,  
The shining drink, \| and a shield lies o'er it;  
But their hope is gone \| from the mighty gods.  
Unwilling I spake, \| and now would be still."

\[6. The manuscript has no superscriptions indicating the speakers.
*Vegtam* ("The Wanderer"): Othin, as usual, conceals his identity,
calling himself the son of Valtam ("The Fighter"). In this instance he
has unusual need to do so, for as the wise-woman belongs apparently to
the race of the giants, she would be unwilling to answer a god's
questions. *Heaven*: the word used includes all the upper worlds, in
contrast to hell. *Benches*, etc.: the adornment of the benches and
raised platforms, or elevated parts of the house, was a regular part of
the preparation for a feast of welcome. The text of the two last lines
is somewhat uncertain.

7\. Grundtvig, followed by, Edzardi, thinks a line has been lost between
lines 3 and 4.\]

Othin spake:  
8. "Wise-woman, cease not! \| I seek from thee  
All to know \| that I fain would ask:  
Who shall the bane \| of Baldr become,  
And steal the life \| from Othin's son?"

The Wise-Woman spake:  
9. "Hoth thither bears \| the far-famed branch,  
He shall the bane \| of Baldr become,  
And steal the life \| from Othin's son.  
Unwilling I spake, \| and now would be still."

Othin spake:  
10. "Wise-woman, cease not! \| I seek from thee  
All to know \| that I fain would ask:  
Who shall vengeance win \| for the evil work,  
Or bring to the flames \| the slayer of Baldr?"

The Wise-Woman spake:  
11. "Rind bears Vali \| in Vestrsalir,  
And one night old \| fights Othin's son;

\[9. Concerning the blind Hoth, who, at Loki's instigation, cast the
fatal mistletoe at Baldr, cf. *Voluspo*, 32-33 and notes. In the
manuscript the last line is abbreviated, as also in stanza 11.

10\. In the manuscript lines 1-2 are abbreviated, as also in stanza 12.

11\. *Rind*: mentioned by Snorri as one of the goddesses. Concerning her
son Vali, begotten by Othin for the express purpose of avenging Baldr's
death, and his slaying of Hoth the day after his birth, cf. *Voluspo*,
33-34, where the lines of this stanza appear practically verbatim.
*Vestrsalir* ("The Western Hall"): not else where mentioned in the
poems.\]

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

His hands he shall wash not, \| his hair he shall comb not,  
Till the slayer of Baldr \| he brings to the flames.  
Unwilling I spake, \| and now would be still."

Othin spake:  
12. "Wise-woman, cease not! \| I seek from thee  
All to know \| that I fain would ask:  
What maidens are they \| who then shall weep,  
And toss to the sky \| the yards of the sails?"

The Wise-Woman spake:  
13. "Vegtam thou art not, \| as erstwhile I thought;  
Othin thou art, \| the enchanter old."

Othin spake:  
"No wise-woman art thou, \| nor wisdom hast;  
Of giants three \| the mother art thou."

The Wise-Woman spake:  
14. "Home ride, Othin, \| be ever proud;  
For no one of men \| shall seek me more

\[12. The manuscript marks the third line as the beginning of a stanza;
something may have been lost. Lines 3.4 are thoroughly obscure.
According to Bugge the maidens who are to weep for Baldr are the
daughters of the sea-god Ægir, the waves, whose grief will be so
tempestuous that they will toss the ships up to the very sky. "Yards of
the sails" is a doubtfully accurate rendering; the two words, at any
rate in later Norse nautical speech, meant respectively the "tack" and
the "sheet" of the square sail.

13\. Possibly two separate stanzas. *Enchanter*: the meaning of the
original word is most uncertain.\]

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

Till Loki wanders \| loose from his bonds,  
And to the last strife \| the destroyers come."

\[14. Concerning Loki's escape and his relation to the destruction of
the gods, cf. *Voluspo*, 35 and 51, and notes. While the wise-woman
probably means only that she will never speak again till the end of the
world, it has been suggested, and is certainly possible, that she
intends to give Loki her counsel, thus revenging herself on Othin.\]
