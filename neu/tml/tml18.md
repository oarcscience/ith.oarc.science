### CHAPTER XIII

# Thor in Peril

the Goddess--Thor disguised--Giant Bridegroom's Amaze--A Hungry
Bride--The Hammer recovered --Vengeance of Thor--Loke in Geirrod's
Castle--Plot to capture Thor--Grid intervenes--Vidar the

Now there was a king of giants whose name was Thrym, and he desired to
have Freyja, the beauteous Asa-goddess, for his bride. A deep plot he
laid, nor did the gods become aware of it until a grievous misfortune
befell Thor. He was returning with Loke from Jotun-heim, and together
they lay down to sleep. In great wrath was the thunder-god when he awoke
because he could find not his hammer, Mjolner. He grasped his red beard
and shook it, and fear crept over him as he searched around and about,
because without his hammer he was powerless to contend against the
giants.

When the other awoke, Thor spoke to him, saying: "Listen to me, and I
shall tell thee what is known not in heaven nor upon earth--Mjolner is
stolen!"

Speedily they took flight towards high Asgard, and to the dwelling of
Freyja went they. Thor spake abruptly, and said: "Wilt thou lend thy
falcon-guise to me, for my hammer hath been stolen, and I would fain
find it."'

"Gladly shall I give it thee, O Thor," Freyja

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

answered, "even although it were made of silver; yea, if it were of fine
gold thou wouldst have it without delay."

To Loke gave Thor the falcon-guise, and he flew speedily from Asgard to
the northern coasts of distant Jotun-heim. Nor did he pause or stay
until he reached a high mountain on which sat Thrym, king of giants,
twisting bands of gold for his dogs, and anon smoothing the gold mane of
his horse.

When he beheld Loke in falcon-guise he said: "How fare the gods, and how
fare the elves? Why dost thou come alone unto these shores?"

Loke answered: "Ill fares it with gods and ill fares it with the elves.
Hast thou hidden the hammer of Thor? "'

Thrym. answered boldly and with gladness: "I have indeed done so. Nine
miles below the ground have I buried Mjolner. Nor shall it ever be
recovered or returned unto Thor until I am given the goddess Freyja for
my bride."

Having spoken thus he smoothed leisurely the golden mane of his
fleet-footed steed, and Loke flew back towards Asgard.

Thor awaited him on the battlements, and when the falcon drew nigh he
cried: "Hast thou indeed performed thy mission, O Loke? Tell me what
thou knowest ere thou dost descend. What is spoken by one who sits is
often of small worth. He who reclines is prone to utter what is untrue."

Loke answered and said: "I have discovered all that needs be known. Thy
hammer hath been stolen by Thrym, King of Jotuns, and he hath buried it
nine miles down below the mountains. Nor will he deliver it to thee
again until Freyja is given him to be his bride."

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Then Thor and Loke went unto Freyja and told her what the giant had
said. Impatient, indeed, was the thunder-god, for he feared that if it
became known to the Frost-giants that his hammer was lost they would
fall upon Asgard and overcome the gods.

"Right speedily thou must don thy bridal attire, O Freyja," Thor
exclaimed, "and together shall we hasten unto Jotun-heim."

Freyja was filled with anger, and as she raged she broke her flashing
necklace that gave her great beauty. "A love-sick maid, indeed, I would
be," she exclaimed, "ere I would hasten to King Thrym."

To the high Thingstead of Asgard went Thor, and the gods assembled there
to hold counsel one with another and decide how the hammer should be
recovered. To the hall Vingolf went the goddesses, to consult regarding
the fate of Freyja.

In the Thingstead, Heimdal, the wise Van, the shining god, spake with
foreknowledge and cunning, and thus he advised: "Let Thor be dressed in
the bridal robes of Freyja, and let him also don her sparkling necklace,
which gives its wearer great beauty. In a woman's dress let Thor go
forth, with keys jingling at his waist. His hair must be pleated, and on
his breast must be fixed great brooches."

But Thor made protest, and declared that the gods would mock him if he
were attired in woman's dress. Ill-pleased was he with Heimdal's words.
"Be silent, Thor," Loke exclaimed; "thou knowest well that if thy hammer
is found not the Frost-giants will come speedily hither and build over
Asgard a dome of ice."

The other gods spake likewise, and Thor consented to be attired as a
bride. When this was done, Loke was dressed, at his own desire, as a
maid attendant, and

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

together they went forth from Asgard in Thor's sublime car. The
mountains thundered and fire swept from the heavens over Midgard as Thor
journeyed to Jotun-heim.

Thrym was sitting on the mountain top, and to the Jotuns about him he
spoke, when he beheld Thor in female-guise coming nigh, saying: "Arise,
O giants! let the feast be spread, for Freyja comes hither to be my
bride."

Then were driven before him into his yard his red cows with golden
horns, and his great black oxen.

"I have great wealth indeed," the king exclaimed; "all that I desire is
mine. I lack naught save Freyja."

The feast was made ready, and at the board sat Thor, whom Thrym deemed
to be Freyja, and Loke, who was "maid attendant".

Thor had great hunger, and he ate an ox, eight salmon, and all the
sweets which had been made ready for the giantesses. Then he drank three
great barrels of ancient mead.

Wondering, Thrym sat and watched him. Then he cried: "Hath anyone ever
beheld a bride so hungry? Never have I known a maid who ate as Freyja
hath eaten, or a woman who ever drank so great a quantity of mead."

Loke, the cunning one, fearing that Thor would be discovered, said: "For
eight days hath Freyja fasted, so greatly did she long to come unto
Jotun-heim."

Thrym was well pleased to hear what Loke said, and he rose and went
towards Thor. He lifted the veil he wore and sought to kiss, but he
shrank back suddenly. Indeed he retreated to the hall end, where he
cried: "Why are the eyes of Freyja so bright and so fierce? They seem to
glow like hot embers."

Then spake cunning Loke again, and said: "Alas!

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Thrym, for eight
nights Freyja hath slept not, for she longed to be here with thee in
Jotun-heim. Thus are her eyes a-fire."

Thrym's sister then entered, and she went towards Thor humbly and with
due respect, and asked to be given golden bridal rings from his fingers.

"Thou shalt gift them to me," she said, "if thou desirest to have my
friendship and my love."

But naught did she receive from the angry and impatient god of thunder.

Thrym then desired that the wedding ceremony should be held, but Loke
asked that as proof of his friendship, and to complete the bargain the
giant had made, Thor's hammer should be laid upon the maiden's lap.

Then did Thrym order that Mjolner be lifted from its hiding place deep
in the bowels of the earth.

In Thor's heart there was great laughter when Thrym spoke thus, yet was
his mind solemn, and he waited anxiously until Mjolner was laid upon his
knees.

A servant came forward with it, and Thor clutched the handle right
eagerly. Then he tore off the bridal veil from his face and the woman's
dress from about his knees, and sprang upon King Thrym, whom he killed
with a single blow. Around the feasting board he went, slaying the
guests, nor one would he permit to escape from the hall, so fierce was
he with long-restrained wrath.

Thrym's sister, who had begged from Thor the bridal rings, he slew with
the others. A blow she received from the hammer instead of golden
treasure.

Cunning Loke watched with pleasure the devastation accomplished by the
fierce thunder-god as he raged round the hall and through the castle,
wreaking his fierce vengeance on the whole clan of Thrym.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

Then together hastened they to where the goats were bound at the home of
Orvandel, nor did they pause to rest. Across the heavens was speedily
driven the black sublime car. Swiftly o'er mountain and sea it went,
blotting out the sparkling stars. Mountains thundered and the wide ocean
trembled with fear as the car rolled on. The earth was filled with fire.

Thus did Thor return in triumph unto Asgard, because Mjolner was
recovered and the King of Mountain Giants was slain.

But although Loke had served Thor well when his hammer was stolen by
Thrym, there came a time when he brought the god of thunder nigh to
great misfortune. It was in the days ere the winter war was waged
between the Asa-gods and the sons of Ivalde, and the cunning artisans
were yet friendly with the dwellers in Asgard.

Loke had gone forth in the falcon-guise of Freyja to pry round
Jotun-heim, and especially the castle of King Geirrod, whose daughter he
desired for a bride. He flew towards a window, and sat in it while he
listened to the words that were being spoken, and surveyed the guests
who were there. A servant beheld him with curious eyes, and perceived
that he was not a real falcon. So, making cautious approach, he seized
Loke and brought him before the king. The eyes of the falcon were still
the cunning eyes of Loke, and he was recognized by Geirrod, who demanded
ransom ere he would release him. In vain did Loke endeavour to escape.
He flapped his wings, he pecked with his beak, but the servant held his
claws securely.

Silent was he before Geirrod, and no answer would he make when he was
addressed. So to punish him the giant locked him in a chest, in which he
was kept for three months. Then was Loke taken forth, and ready

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

indeed was he to speak. To Geirrod he confessed who he was, and the
giant constrained him to promise, by swearing a binding oath, that he
would bring Thor to Jotun-heim and unto that strong castle without his
hammer or his belt or his iron gloves. For greatly sought the giant to
have the thunder-god in his power.

Loke then flew back to Asgard, and with great cunning he addressed Thor,
so that he secured his consent to visit the castle of Geirrod without
taking with him his hammer and gloves and his strong belt. For Loke
assured Thor that the castle stood on a green and level plain, and that
they were invited to attend together a feast of friends.

Thor set forth, and Loke went with him. All day they travelled on their
way until they came to the borders of Elivagar in Alf-heim, where dwelt
the sons of Ivalde.

There dwelt also in that realm and in the midst of a deep wood a
giantess who was friendly towards the gods. Her name was Grid. She was
the mother of Odin's son Vidar, the Silent One, whose strength was so
mighty that none save Thor was his equal. A great shoe he had; its sole
was hard as iron, for it was formed of the cast-off leather scraps of
every shoe that was ever made. This son of Grid was born to avenge his
father's death. When Odin is slain at Ragnarok, then shall Vidar combat
with the wolf Fenrer and tear its jaws asunder. Nor shall Surtur destroy
him with his firebrands, for the wood-god perishes never in Nature's
deep solitudes.

Now Grid, mother of Vidar, had power to work magic spells, and she
possessed a magic rowan wand which was named Gridarvold. When she beheld
Thor going unarmed towards Geirrod's castle, she warned him

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

that the giant was as cunning and treacherous as a wolf-dog, and
dangerous to meet without weapons. So to Thor she gave her magic staff,
her belt of strength, and her iron gloves, and when he set out he took
with him the sons of Ivalde. Together they travelled in safety until
they came to Vimur, which is the greatest of the rivers Elivagar. The
clouds drove heavily above them, and hailstones fell around. Wild and
mountainous was the country which Loke had said was green and level.
There were swift and treacherous eddies in the swollen waters.

But Thor put on the belt of strength which Grid had given him, and in
his hand he took her magic staff. Rapidly did the river rise as he
entered it with his men. From the mountains icy torrents poured down
with increasing strength, and the sons of Ivalde were soon in great
peril. They thrust their spears into the shingle as they tried to ford
the river, and the clinking of the steel mingled with the sharp screams
of the waters. When they were but halfway across a high wave burst out
from a great mountain torrent, and the waters rose to Thor's shoulder.
The others were swept down towards him; for, perceiving their peril and
desiring to be a protection to them, he had chosen the deepest part
through which to wade. Orvandel leapt upon Thor's shoulder, and there
stood, bending his bow. Loke and the others clung to the belt of Grid,
which was about Thor's body. Towards the bank the thunder-god laboured,
and when he came nigh to it he beheld, at the torrent's source a
daughter of Geirrod, whose name was Gjalp. It was she who, standing high
on the hillside, caused the river to increase so that Thor and his
followers might be drowned. The angry god seized a boulder and flung it
towards her. Sure was his aim, for it struck her heavily, so that

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

her back was broken. Thus was the Hag overcome and the torrent stayed.

Then did Thor seize a rowan-tree branch which overhung the river, and
with its aid he pulled himself up the bank. Thus had its origin the
ancient proverb: "Thor's salvation, the rowan".

Up the steep mountain did the thunder-god climb with all his men.
Against them came the giants who sought to destroy Ygdrasil, "the
World-tree". Bravely fought Thor, and the arrows of Orvandel sped fast
until the horde of giants were put to flight. Speedily did the heroes
follow them. They pressed onward and reached Geirrod's castle amidst the
clamour and the howling of the storm-giants and the giants that dwell
within the caves of the mountains.

When Thor entered Geirrod's hall the giant king cast at him a red-hot
flaming javelin from behind a great pillar of wood. But with Grid's iron
gloves Thor caught it, and past Orvandel's head he flung it back, so
that it went through the pillar and through Geirrod, who was slain; and
it passed through the wall of his castle ere it sank deep into the
earth.

Then loudly thundered the din of battle in Geirrod's hall, which was
shaken to its foundations. With slings and boulders did the giants
contend, but from Thor and his men they received their deathblows.

Thus was Geirrod and his clan overcome in dread conflict; but no less
terrible was the battle which Thor waged against Hrungner, the
stone-giant, the tale of which now follows.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

### Thor

I am the god Thor,  
I am the war god,  
I am the Thunderer!  
Here in my Northland,  
My fastness and fortress,  
Reign I forever!

Here amid icebergs  
Rule I the nations;  
This is my hammer,  
Mjolner, the mighty  
Giants and sorcerers  
Cannot withstand it!

These are the gauntlets  
Wherewith I wield it  
And hurl it afar off;  
This is my girdle,  
Whenever I brace it  
Strength is redoubled!

The light thou beholdest  
Stream through the heavens,  
In flashes of crimson,  
Is but my red beard  
Blown by the night-wind,  
Affrighting the nations.

Jove is my brother;  
Mine eyes are the lightning;  
The wheels of my chariot  
Roll in the thunder,  
The blows of my hammer  
Ring in the earthquake!

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Force rules the world still,  
Has ruled it, shall rule it;  
Meekness is weakness,  
Strength is triumphant;  
Over the whole earth  
Still is Thor's-day!  
                 --*Longfellow*
