# Conflict with Demons

Grendel enters the Hall--A Warrior devoured--Struggle with
Beowulf--Terror-stricken Danes--The Hero Triumphant--Flight of the
Demon--The Great Feast--Beowulf honoured--Grendel's Mother takes her
Revenge--The Hero follows her--His Great Dive--Fight in the Cave--The
Ancient Giant-sword--The She Demon slain--How Beowulf became a Prince.

OVER the moor in the black mist Grendel came stalking. The wrath of God
was upon him. He saw the high hall and hungered for human flesh. . . .
Stealthily he strode below the dark clouds, so that he might peer into
the feasting chamber, which was decorated with gold and shining with
ornaments. . . . It was not the first time he had entered it, but never
before did he meet therein with a mightier warrior and braver watchmen.

So came that accursed fiend towards the Hall. The door was shut and
strongly barred with iron bands; but he smote it with his great hands
and it flew open. The demon was bent upon evil and swollen with fury as
he tore through the entrance. With swift footsteps he strode his silent
way over the finely paved floor. . . . He raged inwardly, and in the
darkness awesome lights, like to fire, burned in his eyes. . . . He
surveyed the hall; he saw warriors asleep on the benches and his heart
exulted as he resolved to devour each one separately ere the night was
spent. . . . But he had come to his last feast of human flesh.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

Beowulf lay watching Grendel. Soon the hero beheld how suddenly the
fiend snatched up his prey. Without delay that grim monster clutched a
sleeping warrior, tore him asunder, chewed his flesh, and drank his
blood, swallowing great mouthfuls quickly, until he completely devoured
the man, and even his hands and feet.

Then Grendel came nearer; his claws darted out to wards Beowulf as he
lay in bed. But the hero divined the demon's purpose, and he clutched
the monstrous arm and threw his weight upon it. . . . Never before did
Grendel feel a stronger hand-grip, and he was suddenly stricken with
terror and sought to escape. . . . In vain he struggled to break free,
so that he might take flight into the blackness of night-back again to
the demons of his gang.

But Beowulf was mindful of his evening boast; he leapt from bed; he
stood erect; tightly he grasped the monster; his fingers burst. . . .
Grendel twisted and swayed; backward he sprawled towards the door, but
the hero went with him, nor relaxed his grip. The wily fiend sought to
slip without, if it were possible, and then flee to the darksome fen. He
realized what strength there was in Beowulf's hands. . . . A luckless
visit indeed had the monster made to Heorot.

Loud rang the clamour in the hall. Terror seized upon the Danes in their
safe dwellings without; there was panic among them. . . . Beowulf and
Grendel raged with fury; the building resounded as they struggled and
crashed round and about. . . . It was a wonder that the feasting-hall
was not shattered, and that it ever survived the savage conflict; it
might well have fallen to the ground, but the timbers were bound
together by well-forged iron bands. . . . Never could it be destroyed by
hands, although the flames might devour it.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

Then arose a loud and awesome scream. . . . The Danes were stricken with
terrible dread, because they heard the demon's cries of despair--his
screeching song lamenting for his wound.

Beowulf held fast; he would not suffer the man-eating fiend to escape
alive. . . . Of little account was Grendel's life to the world of men. .
. .

The battle heroes in the hall sought to help their lord. They fell upon
the monster without fear, and smote him with their war swords, but
without avail, for Grendel's body was charmed against weapon wounds, and
they could do him no hurt.

But miserable was to be the life ending of the fiend; his alien spirit
was fated to travel afar to be bound by devils. The crime worker, the
devourer of men, the enemy of God, realized that his body would endure
not or give him help and sure defence. Brave Beowulf had him in his
power; each loathed the other with fierce hate.

In agony was Grendel. . . . A wound gaped on his shoulder; it was torn
wider and wider; the sinews snapped; the flesh burst . . . . The glory
of battle was given to great Beowulf . . . . Sick unto death Grendel
must indeed escape to his joyless lair below the darksome fen: he knew
that his life days were spun to an end. . . . So tearing away, he left
his arm and shoulder in Beowulf's hands.

Thus was the desire of the Danes achieved, and the boast of the great
hero fulfilled. The high hall was cleansed of Grendel. That indeed did
the people who were stricken and put to shame realize when they entered
Heorot, for from the great roof had Beowulf suspended the arm of the
night demon with its iron-strong hand and clutching claws.

In the safety of morning the warriors hastened to the

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hall; from far and
near the people gathered to gaze with wonder on the traces of the
conflict. The blood tracks of the monster were on the ground. The
warriors followed his trail on horseback until they came to the water of
sea demons, which they beheld weltering with blood; the waves surged red
and hot with gore. The death-doomed Grendel had laid his life down in
his lair--his heathen soul. There Hela <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) snatched him away.

Then the mounted warriors rode back and proclaimed the tidings and the
glory of Beowulf, of whom they said that no other warrior between the
seas and the world ever was his equal or worthier of a kingdom.

Then was great rejoicing. Warriors held races on horses, one with
another, and a minstrel thane sang of Beowulf's deed, and of Sigemund,
the Volsung, who slew the dragon. To the Hall went many retainers to
behold the arm of Grendel. The king went to view it with his nobles, and
the queen went with her maidens.

Hrothgar gave thanksgiving to God because that the dread of Grendel was
ended, and, addressing Beowulf, whom he called "the valiant hero", he
vowed that henceforth he would love him as a son. "Thy fame," he said,
"shall endure for ever."

Beowulf spake in answer, and said he had done the deed with great
goodwill. "Would", he said, "that thou hadst witnessed the conflict. I
thought to hold down the fiend on his deathbed until he died, but I
could not prevent his going away."

The warriors were silent about him: they looked on the arm suspended
from the roof; they saw the finger-claws which were like steel. Then
they said that no weapon could have cut off that bloody battlehand of
the demon.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

A great feast was given in Heorot in Beowulf's honour. Hrothgar gave
unto the hero as gifts a golden banner, a helm and war armour and richly
jewelled sward. Eight battle steeds gave he also, and on one was the
king's war saddle, adorned with embroidery and gems. To each of the
hero's followers was given a sword, and blood money was paid for the
warrior whom Grendel had devoured.

At the feast a minstrel sang of the deeds of King Finn <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) and of Hengest, Hnaef, and Hildeburgh--how
Finn married Hildeburgh, the sister of Hnaef, who was afterwards slain
and burned at the king's hall, and how Hengest went against Finn and
slew him, returning to the fatherland with Hildeburgh.

When the song was ended, Hrothgar's queen, Wealtitheow, gave the golden
cup to the king, and then bore it to Beowulf, to whom she also gave two
golden armlets, a mantle, and a jewelled collar which was as precious as
the collar of the Brisings, <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) which
Hama took from Eormanric. The wondrous collar did Beowulf afterwards
gift to his king, Hygelac, who wore it when, in after days, he fell
fighting against the Frisians, when to them it passed.

The feast was then spread; men drank wine. They knew not stem Wyrd <span
id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md)--Destiny--as had many of the nobles before
them there. And when evening came, Hrothgar rose and left the hall, and
Beowulf went also to sleep in an outer dwelling. The benches were
cleared and laid out as sleeping couches. . . . One among the revellers
was doomed that night to die. . . . Each of

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

the warriors hung his armour and weapons on the wall at his head, ready
for sudden alarm and night attack. Brave men were they!

Now demon vengeance was brooding against the warriors because that
Grendel was slain. His mother, a female demon, was filled with woe in
her dwelling amidst awesome waters and cold streams. Ravenous and
wrathful she resolved to go forth to avenge her son's death.

In the darkness she made her sorrowful way, and came to Heorot while the
warriors slept on the benches. When she broke in there was again terror
in the hall, which was just as much less than before as is a woman's
strength unto a man's on the battlefield.

Swords were drawn hastily: there was no time to don armour. The she
demon, perceiving that she was discovered, made haste to depart, but she
had seized in her grim claws a sleeping noble, and she carried him off
towards the fen. He was Hrothgar's comrade warrior and shield bearer,
Æschere, who was famed between the two seas and well beloved. . . . A
wailing arose in Heorot; the demon had taken life for life.

The old king was sorrow-stricken when he knew that his chief warrior was
slain. He summoned Beowulf to a council, and the hero went with his
followers. Along the floor strode the war-famed hero, while the timbers
resounded his steps. He asked of the king if he had passed, according to
his desire, an easeful night.

"Ask not of my welfare!" the king cried. "Sorrow has again fallen upon
the Danes. Æschere is dead--my right-hand man, my councillor, my
teacher. The death demon is his murderer. By her is her son's death
avenged. My comrade she hath slain because thou didst kill Grendel, who
for long slaughtered my people. So is the feud continued against us ...
. . .

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

Then did the king tell Beowulf that ofttimes he heard that two dread
stalkers held the moors by night. One of them had a woman's seeming; the
other was Grendel. None knew if there was a sire in times past. Their
lair was under the cliffs where a stream fell downward--in an underworld
flood below a tree-girt mere. Nightly was a wonder beheld there--fire in
the flood! No man knew how deep was the mere. The hart when close
pursued will die rather than enter the water. An awesome place it is!

Thence do the waves surge to the clouds when the wind stirs up fearsome
storms, the air is filled with mist, and the heavens weep. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md)

Then said the king unto Beowulf: "Once more do we look to thee for aid.
Thou knowest not yet the demon lair, the perilous retreat, where the
monster may be found. Seek it if thou art unafraid! Then shall I reward
as heretofore with gifts of gold if thou shalt survive."

Beowulf was, indeed, without fear. He besought the king to sorrow not.
"Better it is," he said, "to avenge a comrade than to grieve without
end." So he counselled that they should go forth quickly and follow the
demon's blood trail to her den. Bravely he spoke thus:--

"Not in earth's bosom, in mountain wood, or in the sea depths, go where
she may, shall the kin of Grendel escape me! . . . Be patient in thy
grief this day, O king, as I expect of thee."

With joy the king leapt up, hearing the words that Beowulf spake. He
called for his horse, and, followed by his men, went forth with Beowulf
and his warriors.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They followed the
track of the demon over the moor, and came to the stony places and the
cliffs and the homes of sea-monsters. They reached the grey rock <span
id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) overhung by trees, and below they beheld
the mere surging and red with blood. On a cliff top they found Æschere's
head.

In the water they beheld serpents and awesome sea dragons. On a ledge
were sea monsters that go down the ocean paths. When the horn gave out a
battle-lay they rushed seaward, and one did Beowulf wound unto death
with an arrow so that he swam slowly in the water. The war-men thrust
barbed boar spears at it and dragged it ashore. With wonder they gazed
on their awesome guest.

Beowulf then girded on his armour, and on his head put his battle
helmet. Then gave Hrothgar's spokesman, Unferth, unto him the strong
blade which was named Hrunting. Of iron was it made, and tempered with
blood of battle; it had been forged with twig venom and never had it
failed in battle.

Then Beowulf addressed Hrothgar and besought him to be guardian of his
comrades should he himself survive not, and to send unto Hygelac the
treasures he had received.

"I shall achieve fame with Hrunting," Beowulf cried, "or death shall
take me."

He awaited no answer and plunged; the surging waters received him.
Downward he sank a day's space ere he found the bottom. . . . Soon the
demon discovered that an alien being came against her, and she clutched
Beowulf in her finger claws, but by reason of his strong armour she
could do him no hurt. Sea

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

monsters attacked him with sharp tusks, <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) so that he could not use his sword, and
they followed as the demon drew him into her lair. Then did Beowulf
perceive that he was dragged into a hall beyond the sea's reach. The
glow of fire-like light was shining bright, and Beowulf perceived that
the mere wife had taken him. He smote her with his sword--a great free
blow he gave, and the blade rang on her head. But no wound could he
inflict. Never before had the sword failed in conflict! Then did the
hero fling down the blade. He would have his strength of arm for sure
defence. So, desperate-minded, does a battle man fight when he hopes for
fame and recks not of life. . . . The shoulder of Grendel's mother he
seized and in great fury wrestled and flung the demon down. . . .

But fiercely she clutched at him. In her claws she held him securely.
They struggled together thus until the battle hero, heart-weary, at
length was overthrown. On the ground he fell and the she demon sat upon
him. ... She drew swiftly her broad and bloodstained dagger to avenge
her only son. . . . Then would the hero have died there, but over his
shoulder lay his chain armour and that saved him. . . . To his feet he
leapt again.

Beowulf suddenly beheld among the armour in the demon's lair an ancient
giant-sword. It was a blade without an equal. No other living man could
wield it, for it was the choice of splendid weapons, and giants had made
it. The hero seized it and wielded it.

Strong was Beowulf, and in battle fury he swung the giant-sword and
smote the demon a fierce blow, cleaving her at the neck and shattering
her bone-rings. Right through her body went the blade, and she sank

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

in death.... Blood-wet indeed was the sword, and Beowulf gloried in his
deed.

Then light flashed through the hall, as when heaven's candle gleams from
on high. . . . The hero gazed about him. . . . He saw Grendel lying
maimed and dead on his resting place, and in vengeance for the evil that
monster had done, Beowulf smote his body so that it was split open. Then
the head he struck off.

On the cliff top the warriors waited, watching the angry waters. . . .
In time, Hrothgar beheld the waves rising red with blood. Old and
grey-haired war men spoke one to another about the brave one; nor did
they expect to see him return again in triumph, for they deemed that the
wolf demon had torn him asunder. . . . So they spoke and waited, until
in the ninth hour the Scylding heroes turned away. Hrothgar went with
them to his home. . . . Nor did the Geats expect ever to behold Beowulf
again; yet they waited, gazing at the blood-red waters.

Meanwhile, in the demon's wave-protected hall, the giant sword which the
hero had wielded began to waste away in the bloodstream. A strange thing
was that! Like ice it melted, as when the Father unties the frost chains
and the flood flows free.

Beowulf took not any of the other arms that were on the wall, but he
kept the gold and graven swordhilt of which the blade was burnt up by
reason of the fiend's hot and poisonous blood. Then, seizing the
monstrous head of Grendel, he entered the waters and soon again he was
swimming--he who survived fearsome strife, for by this time were the
waters purged of blood and he rose quickly. He came to shore, and his
war men rejoiced, as did also the brave hero, for he was proud of his
mighty load of sea spoil.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

Quickly did his men unloose his armour, and with glad hearts they went
inland with him. Heavy was the burden of Grendel's head, which was
carried to the hall on a spear shaft, the warriors marching in triumph.

Into the feasting-chamber they strode, where people sat drinking, and
dragged Grendel's head along the floor. . . . An awesome sight was that
to the nobles and the queen who sat with them. In silence the warriors
gazed upon the monstrous head, wondering greatly.

Then did Beowulf address the king, telling him of the dread peril he
endured ere yet he slew the demon. "But now," the hero said, "thou canst
sleep in Heorot among thy warriors as heretofore, nor fear murderous
attacks in the darkness."

To Hrothgar gave Beowulf the sword-hilt rich in victory, the work of a
wonder-smith. It was a heritage of the past, and upon it was engraved
that primeval war when the surging sea engulfed the race of giants <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md). Terribly were they punished--that people
who were alien to the Eternal Lord; the Supreme Ruler gave them their
final deserts in the flood. A gold plate upon the hilt had engraved in
runes the name of him for whom that choicest of weapons was first made
with decorated hilt and serpent ornament. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md)

There was silence in the hall when Hrothgar, son of Halfdane, spoke of
Beowulf's deed. Well may he say, an aged guardian who promotes truth and
right among the people and remembers all from the far past, "that this
nobleman is of high birth. Beowulf, my friend, thy renown is raised
above all people, far and

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

wide. With modesty and prudence thou dost bear thyself. My friendship
thou shalt have, as I promised thee. Thou shalt ever be a strength to
thy people and an aid to war men.

Not so was Heremod <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) to the children
of Ecgwela, the renowned Scyldings. Not for their happiness did he
flourish, but to bring cruelty and slaughter to the Danes. God had given
him power and strength greater than any other man, but he had a fierce
heart; he gave not money rings; he was without joy, and he endured grief
because of his savagery and never-ending enmity with his people. Follow
not that example. Have manly virtue. Many winters have made me wise, and
for thee I have told this tale."

Further did the king give wise counsel to Beowulf, advising him to
distribute gifts to his people, so that he might ever have their
support, and to avoid vaunting pride, because the day would come when
his strength would depart, and in the end death would take him.

A great feast was held in the Hall, and there was much rejoicing, and
Beowulf slept there until the raven, with blithe heart, proclaimed the
joy of dawn.

Then did the hero bid Hrothgar farewell. An alliance of peace was formed
between the Scyldings and the Geats. The old king kissed the hero and
shed tears.

To the coast guardian Beowulf gifted a gold-hilted sword. Then with his
followers he went aboard the ship in which were the treasures and armour
and horses which Hrothgar had given.

The good ship clove the sea waters; the sail swallowed the wind; the
timbers creaked; necked with white foam the ocean traverser, with curved
stem, sailed away. Favourable were the winds until they saw the Geatish
headlands and the keel grated on the shore.

To King Hygelac did Beowulf relate his adventures, and then he
distributed the gifts he had received, giving that monarch a coat of
mail and four horses, and to the queen, Hygd, the beauteous collar and
three horses. Hygelac awarded the hero a gold-headed sword, much money,
a country seat, and the rank of a prince.

with Svipdag. Beowulf is a hero of similar cast. Each has the attributes
of the age in which their deeds were sung, and reflect the ideals of the
people who celebrated them. Older savage conceptions, preserved by
tradition, were condemned when compared with the new and nobler.
