# PREFACE

This volume deals with the myths and legends of the Teutonic
peoples--Norsemen, Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Franks, Angles, Saxons,
and all the other Germanic tribes whose descendants now occupy England,
Northern France, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Denmark,
Sweden, Norway and Iceland. The volume might have been called Northern
European Myth and Legend. It is the body of folk tales, epics and
religious beliefs which all Anglo-Saxons have inherited directly from
their ancestors, and find most deeply embedded in every-day words and
thoughts such as names for the days of the week, names recalling the
gods and goddesses of our forefathers.

In France and Switzerland--after the Roman conquest--the folk lays were
influenced by the higher and milder civilization which prevailed. Where
the Roman influence extended the tribal songs were welded into detailed
narratives, and each had for a central figure a popular hero like
Dietrich of Bern.

A similar process subsequently prevailed in the north. Thus originated
the "saga cycles," distributed over a wide area by wandering minstrels,
who altered and adapted them to meet the requirements of time and
locality. The highest literary development occurred when educated poets
made still freer use of the subject matter of tribal lays and produced
epic narratives which were not sung, but recited before cultured

audiences. These were later revised and committed to manuscripts for
reading. To this class belong two of outstanding merit--the German
*Nibelungenlied* and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon *Beowulf*.

In the following pages our readers are afforded a comprehensive survey
of the divine and heroic literature of Northern Europe. The drama of
Norse myth has been reconstructed, so far as possible, in continuous
narrative form, with the inclusion of the old Svipdag myth, which
exercised so marked an influence on Middle Age romance. We have grouped
together the various adventurous journeys made by heroes to Hela, so
that our readers may be familiarized with our ancestors' conceptions of
the Other World. The prose renderings of heroic narratives include the
Beowulf epic, the Balder-Hother romance, the Hamlet legend, the saga of
the Volsungs, and the less familiar Dietrich legends, in which the deeds
of the primitive Thor are attached to the memory of the Gothic Emperor
of Rome.

The folk tales and folk beliefs of Northern Europe have not a few points
of contact with those of Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Brittany. We have
therefore dealt in our Introduction with the archaic giant lore of
Scotland, which links with that of Cornwall, and drawn attention to the
"Seven Sleepers" legends of the Highlands which have hitherto been
overlooked. Some of the striking resemblances must be traced to remoter
influences than those prevailing in the Viking Age. Both Celts and
Teutons were blends of the same ancient races--the Alpine "broad heads"
and the Northern "long heads." They had therefore a common heritage of
beliefs. But Teutonic lore is mainly "father-kin" in character, while
Celtic is mainly "mother-kin." The deities of the north are

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

controlled by a Great Father and their elves by a King. The deities of
the Celts are children of a Great Mother and their fairies are ruled
over by a Queen.

In the Anglo-Saxon epic, *Beowulf*, the story regarding Grendel and his
mother is of special interest in this connection because it is
"mother-kin" lore of Celtic character. The inference is that the poet
who gave the epic its final shape in England had a Celtic mother, or at
any rate, came under the influence of Celtic ideas. Like Shakespeare,
who utilized old plays, he may have re-fashioned an earlier Anglian
poem, appropriated its geographical setting and infused the whole with
the fire of his genius.
