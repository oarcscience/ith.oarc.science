THE Asa-gods built for themselves Asgard, the celestial city, which is
set high above the heavens. It stands there in beauty and in glory upon
a holy island in the midst of a dark broad river flowing from the
thunder-vapours that rise through the great World-tree from Hvergelmer,
"the roaring cauldron", the mother of waters. The river is ever troubled
with eddies and fierce currents, and above it hover darkly thick banks
of kindling mist called "Black Terror Gleam", from which leap
everlastingly tongues of vafer-flame, (lightning) filling the air and
darting like white froth from whirling billows.

Round Asgard is a dark and lofty wall, and the great boiling river
breaks angrily at its base. There is no entry-way save by Odin's mighty
gate. And if anyone who is unworthy, be he god or giant or mortal,
should cross the river unscathed by the vafer-flames, and seek to open
the gate of Asgard, he would be caught suddenly

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

by a chain which springs from the lock of strange mechanism, and crushed
and utterly destroyed.

In the middle of Asgard was built stately Idavoll, the Court of
Judgment, the High Thingstead of the Gods, in which their own divine
affairs are discussed and arranged. The beauty of the great hall is
unequalled in the nine worlds, for its roof is of shining silver and it
is resplendent without and within with burnished and graven gold.
Therein was set the great golden throne of Odin, the chief ruler of
Asgard, and around it were placed twelve golden seats for the gods who
sit with him in judgment, and to whom the All-father gave power to rule
and to issue decrees.

When Odin sits on his high golden throne he looks over the homes of
giants and elves and mortals and sees all things. He is silent and he
listens.

Another fair and stately structure did the gods cause to be made as a
sanctuary for the goddesses, and by singers of skalds who echo its
praises it is called Vingolf, "the abode of friends".

In Asgard was shaped a smithy which was furnished with anvils and
hammers and tongs. With these the gods had made for them, by the cunning
elf-smiths, Ivalde's sons and Sindre's kinsmen, every instrument they
had need of. They worked in fine metals, and so great was the treasure
of gold that all movables were made of it.

On a green place in the celestial city were found the golden tablets
with which was played the Game of the Gods. This was in the Golden Age,
which lasted until there came from Jotun-heim three giant maids, who
brought corruption.

To the gods in ages past it became known that there dwelt in Midgard a
race of dwarfs. In the deep, dark

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

mould of Ymer's body they swarmed as do maggots in rotted flesh, and
they went hither and thither with no purpose or knowledge. All the gods
assembled in their high Thingstead, with Odin seated on his golden
throne, and there took counsel one with another. To the dwarfs they gave
human shape, but their hue was the blackness of earth in which they had
being. Over them the gods set Modsognir, who is Mimer, to be king. In
the mounds of the earth dwell one tribe of these earth-black elves,
within rocks another, and a third have their habitation inside high and
precipitous mountains. Besides these are the Trolls, who fly hither and
thither carrying bundles of sticks, and have power to change their
shape. Now the wonder of the Universe, which was set in order by the
will of All-father, is the great ash tree, Ygdrasil, the Tree of
Existence, which nourishes and sustains all spiritual and physical life.
Its roots are spread through the divisions of the worlds that fill the
yawning gulf, and its boughs are above the high celestial city of the
gods. It grows out of the past, it lives in the present, and it reaches
towards the future.

The World-ash has three great roots. In the realms below Midgard is one
root, which receives warmth and life in Hela's glittering plains from
the deep fountain of Urd, the goddess of fate and of death; another root
reaches the egg-white well of Mimer, who is Wisdom and Memory; and the
last root is in gloomy Nifel-heim, where it finds hardening sustenance
in Hvergelmer, "the roaring cauldron", the fount of primeval waters,
ice-cold and everlasting, which springs up on Hvergelmer mountain.

In the realm of Urd, which is Hela, the souls of good men be. Nigh to
it, in the underworld, is Mimer's well in Mimer's grove, where dwells
the race which will

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

regenerate the world of men. Below cold and darksome Nifel-heim are the
nine divisions of torture in which the souls of the wicked are punished.
At Hvergelmer the watchman of the root of Ygdrasil is Ivalde, who with
his sons contend against the storm-giants who threaten Hela.

The roots of the great World-tree suck up the waters of the three
eternal fountains, and these mixed together give imperishable life. In
the well of wise Mimer the fibres are made white with the holy mead
which gives wisdom to men, and poetry also, and is the very elixir of
life eternal.

On the high branches of Ygdrasil, which overshadow Asgard, sits a wise
eagle, and between its eyes is perched a hawk named Vedfolner. On the
topmost bough is Goldcomb, the "cock of the north", which awakens the
gods from sleep and puts the demons to flight. From Hela answers the red
cock, whose fire purifies what is good and destroys what is evil.

But the great World-tree bears a more painful burden than mortals can
conceive. In the well of Hvergelmer, in the black realm of Nifel-heim,
is the corpse-eating dragon Nidhog, "the lower one", which chews
constantly at the root; above, four giant harts are ever biting its buds
and its leaves; on its side, Age rots it; and many serpents gnaw its
tender fibres in the dark underworld. For there never was good to which
evil came not, nor growth which has known not decay and the wasting of
time.

The Norns of Hela sprinkle the great ash-tree each morning with precious
mead from Urd's fount of life, so that its leaves may ever be green.
Thence comes the honey-dew, which drips upon the world and is stored by
the bees. And in Urd's fountain are the two mystic

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

swans which are the ancestors of the swan race in Midgard.

Up and down the World-tree runs constantly the squirrel Ratatosk, which
bears gossip between the eagle on the highest branches and the dragon
Nidhog at the root, and is thus ever the cause of strife. Greatly
dreaded is Nidhog, who flies to the rocks and cliffs of the lower world
with the bodies of dead men beneath its wings.

The three Fates, who are called Norns, are Urd and her two sisters--Urd,
"present"; Verdande, "past"; and Skuld, "future". By them are spun at
will the fates of men and women. There are also Dises, who are maids of
Urd, unto whom various duties are assigned. The Hamingjes are those
Dises who are guardians of men through their lives, and appear to them
in dreams to give warnings and noble counsel, and he whom the holy elf
deserts for wrongdoing is indeed lost. The decrees of Urd are executed
by the Giptes, and men who are favoured are suddenly awarded good
fortune and treasure; other Dises attend upon families and even upon
tribes. There are also the sweet elf-maids who have care of babes unborn
in the fair realms of Urd, and find them kindly mothers in the world of
men; and there are maids who conduct the souls of the dead to Hela's
glittering plain.

Now in Hela is the lower-world Thingstead of the gods, where the souls
of the dead are judged, and rewards and punishments are meted out by
Odin. There is but one road thither from Asgard for all the gods save
Thor, and that is over the curved bridge Bif-rost, "the rainbow", which
has its foundation beyond the edge of the world of men. The southern
span reaches to the fount of Urd in the realms of green verdure that
never. know decay.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

Bif-rost is built of air and water, and is protected by red fire flaming
on its edge. Frost giants and mountain giants ever seek to capture the
bridge, so that they may ascend to Asgard and overcome the gods; but its
sentinel, Heimdal, is constantly on guard against them.

The gods set Heimdal, son of the waves, to protect the bridge forever
against the enemy. He is clad in silvern armour, and on his head is a
burnished helmet with ram's horns. Horsed on his swift steed, Gull-top,
he now watches at the highest point of Bif-rost from his fortified
citadel, Himinbjorg, "the ward of heaven", where his hall is supplied
with precious mead. Anon he crosses over from side to side of the
bridge. His sight is so keen that he can see by night as well as by day
the length of a hundred leagues, and he listens so keenly that he can
hear the grass growing. He sleeps as little and as lightly as a bird.
When the giants and monsters come to assail the gods at Ragnarok,
Heimdal shall blow a thunderblast on Gjallar-horn which is hidden in the
deepest shade of the World-tree. With his great sword he shall combat
with the Evil One in the Last Battle.

Heimdal is loved both by gods and by men, and he is also called
Gullintani because his teeth are of gold. There was a time when he went
unto Midgard as a child; he grew up to be a teacher among men, and was
named Scef.

Every day the horses of the gods thunder over Bif-rost as they descend
to and return from the lower-world Thingstead. Thor, the thunder god,
cannot travel thus because the fire of his thunder chariot might set the
bridge aflame and destroy it. He must needs wade across the four great
girdling rivers in the underworld to reach Hela's glittering plains.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

When the gods come unto Hela they leap from their horses and take their
seats in the Thingstead. The dead are then brought before them.

A weary way and long these dead men and women have travelled. Down the
valley of thorns they came, and those who were given hel-shoes in their
graves, because they had shown mercy to others while they lived,
suffered indeed little; but the feet of the wicked were torn and
bleeding. Then they crossed a river full of weapons. The just walked
over on boards, but the unjust waded, and were sorely wounded and
covered with scars, so that their bodies dripped blood.

To the Thingstead come men and women in full attire, with the jewels and
ornaments which those who loved them placed on their bodies ere they
were laid in grave-chambers. Warriors carry their weapons, and all are
clad so that they may be recommended to the gods as the well-beloved
among men. But silent are the dead, save the happy ones under whose
tongues were placed, ere yet they were laid in their graves, magic
runes, so that they might make answer when accused, and give reasons to
justify their deeds. But the Hamingjes can also speak for the dead, and
those who have not Hamingjes to speak for them are known to have done
evil and to be deserted by their Dises in sorrow and wrath. Those who
are justified pass to the eternal realms of Hela, where joy prevails,
because they have lived upright lives, and have been honourable and full
of pity and have helped others; because they were brave and feared not
to die; and also because they worshipped the gods and gave offerings in
the temples.

But those who are condemned are sent to Nifel-hel, the region of
torture. They are judged to be unworthy if they injured others by
falsehoods or wicked deeds, if

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

they were adulterers, or murderers, or despoilers of graves, or cowards,
or were traitors, and profaners of the temples.

Those who are to share eternal joy are given to drink from the horn of
Urd, which imparts to them enduring strength. In it are mixed the three
meads from the wells which sustain Ygdrasil, the World-ash. But the
doomed are given a draught of burning venom which changes them to
monsters. Their tongues are then for ever bereft of speech and they can
moan only.

The happy dead disport themselves on the green plains of Hela, where
they meet lost friends and ancestors from the earliest years of the
world. And many beauteous ways they travel, and wonderful tales they
hear. The children are cared for in the realm of Mimer, "memory", where
joy is theirs forever and their food is honey-dew.

The doomed are fettered and are driven towards Nifel-hel by black elves,
who carry thorny rods with which they lash those who falter or seek to
turn back. Their first punishment is received when they must needs pass
through the regions of eternal bliss, and behold with grief unutterable
the joy of the blessed. Then they cross the rivers which girdle Hela,
and climb towards the dark mountains of Nifel-hel. The wolf dog barks at
them in the shadowy valley where it guards the borders of Hela, and
there is blood on its breast. And as they climb tortuous paths and tread
the narrow path on the edge of dizzy precipices they hear the barking of
the terrible watchdogs at Nifel-hel's gates. The dreaded dragon, Nidhog,
hovers near them, and ferocious birds of prey sit on the rocks.

Then they enter the Na-gates and die the second death. Punishment is
given in the nine realms of torture according to the sins that were
committed. Some

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

are seized by the dragon and some by the birds of prey, according to
their deserts. Others are tempted for ever by illusions of sinful things
they sought in life, and there are those who are torn to pieces by the
great wolf.

In the Venom-dale is a river called Slid, and it is full of daggers and
sharp spears. Through it must wade the perjurers and murderers and
adulterers, who are continually suffering new and fierce wounds. Others
sit together on benches of iron, while venom drips on them, within a
hall which is full of stench unbearable. Traitors are hung on trees, and
cowards are drowned in pools of foulness. Eternal night broods over all.

Naglefar, the "ship of death", lies in the Gulf of Black Grief, in the
outer regions of Nifel-hel, made fast to a dark island with chains that
shall not sever until Ragnarok, "the dusk of the gods". It is
constructed of the parings of dead men's nails--the wicked men, hated by
their kind because of their evil deeds, whose bodies were cleansed not
at life's end, and whose nails were not pared ere they were laid in
grave-chambers. When Naglefar breaks loose the avenging hosts shall sail
in it to battle against the gods.

The warriors who are slain in battle, or drowned at sea, are borne to
Valhal in Asgard by the maids of Urd, who are called Valkyries. They are
horsed on swift steeds, and first they pass to Hela, where the gods give
judgment and reject the unworthy. Then they are carried by the Valkyries
over Bif-rost, and the hoofs of their steeds resound in Asgard. In great
Valhal the heroes feast with Odin in eternal triumph and happiness.

Now these are the divisions of the Universe. In the midst is the earth,
Midgard, which is encircled by the ocean. On high, and above all else,
is Asgard, and below it is the realm of white elves, who flit between
the

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

branches of the great World-tree. Then Vana-heim, the home of the
Vana-gods, is in the air and in the sea; and in the depths of the
western sea is the hall of Æger, god of Ocean. Alf-heim, the home of
elves, is to the east. In the lower world, below Nifel-heim, are the
Nifel-hel regions of torture, and under Midgard are the Hela realms of
Mimer and of Urd. Far below the path of the gods towards Hela's fields
of bliss are Surtur's deep dales on the borders of Muspel-heim, where
the great giant Surtur, the swarthy sentinel, keeps watch with his
flaming sword. Jotun-heim is to the north and the east, beyond the
world's edge.

Billing is the elf-guardian of the western heaven, and when the cars of
Day and of Night and of the Sun and of the Moon enter the forest of the
Varns, "the protectors", they pass through the lower-world realms of
Mimer and of Urd towards the gates of Delling, the elf of dawn, in the
east. When Nat reaches Hela, where she must rest, darkness falls around
her, and the blessed are given sleep, and light comes again with Dagr,
as Nat covers the earth above with shadow and deep slumber.

### The Descent of the Gods

. . . the Gods arose,  
And took their horses, and set forth to ride  
O'er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,  
To the ash Ygdrasil, and Ida's plain;  
Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode.  
And they found Mimir sitting by his fount  
Of wisdom, which beneath the ash-tree springs;  
And saw the Nornies watering the roots  
Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew.  
There came the Gods, and sate them down on stones.  
            --*From "Balder Dead", by Matthew Arnold*.
