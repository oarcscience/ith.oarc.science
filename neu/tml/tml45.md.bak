TIDINGS came unto Dietrich at Bern that Virginal, Queen of the
Mountains, was in sore distress because that a giant wasted her land and
had perforce to obtain as tribute, at each new moon, a fair maiden, whom
he did devour.

The prince set forth with old Hildebrand to give aid to the queen, who
had great beauty, and ruled over those dwarfs and giants in the Tyrolese
mountains that never sought to do injury unto mankind. Her oppressor was
named Orkise, whose son was Janibas, an evil magician.

As the two heroes rode through the forest there came unto them a dwarf
whose name was Bibung. He guided them towards Jeraspunt, where the queen
had her dwelling, but when night came he vanished. Snow fell next
morning, and the knights were parted one from another. Ere long
Hildebrand heard bitter cries, and he beheld a fair maiden who had been
taken to the forest so that the giant might obtain her for tribute.
Fairest was she of Queen Virginal's maidens. The knight proffered his
protection and vowed to rescue her, whereat her heart was filled with
gratitude and her eyes with joy tears.

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

Soon the forest was shaken with dread clamour, for the giant was coming
nigh with his dogs to possess himself of his prey. Hildebrand drew his
sword; not slow was he to enter the conflict, and ere long he slew the
giant and put to flight his evil son Janibas.

The maiden returned with glad heart unto the queen, and gave tidings of
how the giant Orkise had been slain. There was great rejoicing in the
castle, and eagerly did Virginal and all her people await the coming of
the heroes.

Meanwhile Dietrich fought with many of the giant's followers. The
clamour of battle resounded far and near, and when Hildebrand hastened
to his aid the horde was overcome; many were slain and many made escape.

Together did they then go upon their way towards the palace of
Jeraspunt. Darkness came on, and they rode to the gate of the castle of
Orkise, deeming it theirs by right of conquest. But small hospitality
were they shown. No sooner did they demand entrance than fierce giants
issued forth against them. Heavy clubs they bore, and they smote
fiercely, but soon they were overcome by the valorous heroes. Then
appeared a black horseman. He spake in a strange tongue, and giants
sprang up out of the earth to continue the fight. As they were cut down
others took their place, and when all the giants were slain, hissing
snakes and nameless reptiles issued forth against Dietrich and
Hildebrand, so that they had to fight constantly throughout the night.
The black horseman entered not the fray, and when dawn broke he vanished
from sight. Then did the heroes enter the castle and set at liberty
three of Queen Virginal's maidens whom they found there.

Now, during the night the heroes slew a fierce

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

dragon. It carried in its jaws a brave knight whose name was Rentwin,
and with him did Dietrich and Hildebrand journey towards his father's
castle. There did they remain until their wounds were healed.

Thereafter the prince and his veteran companion set forth with Rentwin
and his sire towards Jeraspunt. Eager was Dietrich to behold the fair
maiden queen Virginal. He spurred his steed; he rode in front, and ere
long he was lost to his fellow knights. 'Twas ill for him that he waited
not for them, because the way was strange and wild, and he wandered from
the straight path. So it chanced that he came unto the castle of Duke
Nitger, called Muter.

Now the duke had many giants, and when one of them issued forth,
Dietrich asked of him to be guided unto the palace of Queen Virginal.
Answer was given him according to his desire; but when he turned to ride
away the giant smote the hero with his club so that he fell from his
horse. Then was brave Dietrich seized and bound and thrown into a dark
dungeon. The duke's sister treated him with kindness. But for her
protection the prince would have been put to death.

When Hildebrand reached the palace of Virginal he received tidings that
the prince had been taken captive. So he hastened back unto Bern, and
rode forth with many brave knights, among whom were Wolfhart and Witege
and Heime. They laid siege to Castle Muter and fought against twelve
giants. While the battle waged fiercely, Dietrich made escape and
entered the fray. Victory was then with the heroes of Bern, and all the
giants were slain.

The knights sought to put Duke Nitger to death, but his sister pleaded
for him, and his life was spared by Dietrich.

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

Then did they all set forth towards Jeraspunt, On their way they beheld
a dwarf riding towards them. Unto Dietrich spake the little man, and he
told that fierce Janibas had surrounded the palace of Queen Virginal
with a great army, an made demand of all her maidens and the magic jewel
in her crown which gave her power to rule over all her subjects.

So the heroes pressed onward. They climbed the mountains over ice and
snow, and soon they heard the fierce clamour of battle. The howling of
the great black dogs of Janibas was like the howling of wintry tempests;
strange monsters fought there, and the queen's defenders were in sore
straits. The voices of the giants were loud as thunder peals.

In the midst of the battle Dietrich saw the black horseman. He knew him
to be Janibas. An iron tablet he held in his hand and wrought spells
upon it. The prince sprang upon him. His sword flashed fire. He broke in
pieces the iron tablet and slew the dread worker of evil. Then pealed
the loud thunder amidst the Tyrolese mountains; the glaciers were
sundered, and avalanches fell upon the evil army of Janibas, which
suddenly vanished from sight. Soon was there silence and peace, and an
end to that dread conflict.

Queen Virginal sat alone, high throned in her mountain palace, unmoved
and beautiful; brightly gleamed the jewel in her crown. A glistening
silver veil was drawn round her body, and her maidens crouched trembling
at her feet.

When the battle was ended, Dietrich made approach, and she called him
"hero", and greeted him with love.

"No longer can I reign here in Elfland," she spake. "Thy great deeds
have I beheld, and for thy sake I shall leave my home and my kingdom,
and henceforth live

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

among men; for I shall be thy bride, and love thee so long as life may
last."

Then were Dietrich and Queen Virginal wedded there with pomp and
ceremony, and elves and heroes feasted within the mountain palace, and
drank wine and made merry. Ere long Dietrich and his bride and the brave
knights journeyed together to Bern, where they were received with
acclamations by the people.

Dietrich and Queen Virginal lived happily together, and when King
Dietmar died, the prince reigned in his place. Then was there peace
within the kingdom; but evil was being wrought in another land, and it
was fated that King Dietrich must become a fugitive among men ere he
could triumph completely over his evil foemen.
