IN the Ages, when naught else was, there yawned in space a vast and
empty gulf called Ginnunga-gap. Length it had, and breadth immeasurable,
and there was depth beyond comprehension. No shore was there, nor
cooling wave; for there was yet no sea, and the earth was not made nor
the heavens above.

There in the gulf was the beginning of things. There time first dawned.
And in the perpetual twilight was All-father, who governs every realm
and sways all things both great and small.

First of all there was formed, northward of the gulf, Nifel-heim, the
immense home of misty darkness and

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

freezing cold, and to the south, Muspel-heim, the luminous home of
warmth and of light.

In the midst of Nifel-heim burst forth the great fountain from whence
all waters flow, and to which all waters return. It is named Hvergelmer,
"the roaring cauldron", and from it surged, at the beginning, twelve
tremendous rivers called Elivagar, that washed southward towards the
gulf. A vast distance they traversed from their source, and then the
venom that was swept with them began to harden, as does dross pouring
from a surface, until they congealed and became ice. Whereupon the
rivers grew silent and ceased to move, and gigantic blocks of ice stood
still. Vapour arose from the ice-venom and was frozen to rime; layer
upon layer heaped up in fantastic forms one above another.

That part of the gulf which lay northward was a region of horror and of
strife. Heavy masses of black vapour enveloped the ice, and within were
screaming whirlwinds that never ceased, and dismal banks of fleeting
mist. But southward, Muspel-heim glowed with intense radiance, and
sprayed forth beauteous flakes and sparks of shining fire. The
intervening space between the region of tempest and gloom and the region
of warmth and light was a peaceful twilight, serene and still as is
windless air.

Now when the sparks from Muspel-heim fell through the frozen vapour, and
the heat was sent thither by the might of the All-father, drops of
moisture began to fall from the ice. It was then and there that life
began to be. The drops were quickened and a formless mass took human
shape. Thus came into being the great lumbering clay-giant who was named
Ymer.

Rough and ungainly was Ymer, and as he stretched himself and began to
move about he was tortured by the

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

pangs of immense hunger. So he went forth ravenously to search for food;
but there was yet no substance of which he could partake. The whirlwinds
went past him and over, and the dark mists enveloped him like a shroud.

More drops fell through the gloomy vapours, and next there was formed a
gigantic cow, which was named Audhumla, "void darkness". Ymer beheld it
standing in the gloom beside blocks of ice, and groped weakly towards
it. Wondering, he found that milk ran from its teats in four white
streams, and greedily he drank and drank until he was filled with the
seeds of life and was satisfied.

Then a great heaviness came over Ymer, and he lay down and fell into
deep and dreamless slumber. Warmth and strength possessed him, and sweat
gathered in the pit of his left arm, from which, by the might of
All-father, were formed a son named Mimer and a daughter named Bestla.
From Mimer were descended the Vana-gods. Under the feet of Ymer arose a
monstrous six-headed son, who was the ancestor of the evil frost giants,
the dreaded Hrimthursar. Then Ymer awoke.

For Audhumla, the great cow, there was no verdure upon which to feed.
She stood on the verge of gloom, and found sustenance by licking
constantly the huge boulders that were encrusted by salt and rime. For
the space of a day she fed in this manner, until the hair of a great
head appeared. On the second day the cow returned to the boulder, and
ere she had ceased to lick, a head of human semblance was laid bare. On
the third day a noble form leapt forth. He was endowed with great
beauty, and was nimble and powerful. The name he received was Bure, and
he was the first of the Asa-gods.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

There followed in time more beings--noble giants and wicked giants, and
gods. Mimer, who is Mind and Memory, had daughters, the chief of whom
was Urd, Goddess of Fate and Queen of Life and Death. Bure had a son
named Bor, who took for his wife Bestla, the sister of wise Mimer. Three
sons were born to them, and the first was called Odin (spirit), the
second Ve whose other name is Honer, and the third Vile, whose other
names are Lodur and Loke. Odin became the chief ruler of the Asa-gods,
and Honer was chief of the Vans until Loke, the usurper, became their
ruler.

Now Ymer and his evil sons were moved with wrath and enmity against the
family of gods, and soon warfare broke out between them. To neither side
was there early victory, and the fierce conflicts were waged through the
long ages ere yet the earth was formed. But, at length, the sons of Bor
prevailed over their enemies and drove them back. In time there followed
great slaughter, which diminished the army of evil giants until one
alone remained.

It was thus that the gods achieved their triumph. Ymer was stricken
down, and the victors leapt upon him and then slit open the bulging
veins of his neck. A great deluge of blood gushed forth, and the whole
race of giants was drowned save Bergelmer, "The Mountain-old", who with
his wife took refuge on the timbers of the great World-mill, and
remained there. From these are descended the Jotuns, who for ever
harboured enmity against the gods.

The great World-mill of the gods was under care of Mundilfore
(Lodur-Loke). Nine giant maids turned it with much violence, and the
grinding of the stones made such fearsome clamour that the loudest
tempests could not be heard. The great mill is larger than is

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the whole world, for out of it the mould of earth was ground.

When Ymer was dead, the gods took counsel among themselves, and set
forth to frame the world. They laid the body of the clay-giant on the
mill, and the maids ground it. The stones were smeared with blood, and
the dark flesh came out as mould. Thus was earth produced, and the gods
shaped it to their desire. From Ymer's bones were made the rocks and the
mountains; his teeth and jaws were broken asunder, and as they went
round at their labour the giant maids flung the fragments hither and
thither, and these are the pebbles and boulders. The ice-cold blood of
the giant became the waters of the vast engulfing sea.

Nor did the giant maids cease their labours when the body of Ymer was
completely ground, and the earth was framed and set in order by the
gods. The body of giant after giant was laid upon the mill, which stands
beneath the floor of Ocean, and the flesh-grist is the sand which is
ever washed up round the shores of the world. Where the waters are
sucked through the whirling eye of the millstone is a fearsome
maelstrom, and the sea ebbs and flows as it is drawn down to Hvergelmer,
"the roaring cauldron", in Nifel-heim and thrown forth again. The very
heavens are made to swing by the great World-mill, round Veraldar Nagli,
"the world spike", which is the Polar Star.

Now when the gods had shaped the earth they set Ymer's skull over it to
be the heavens. At each of the four corners they put as sentinels the
strong dwarfs East and West and North and South. The skull of Ymer rests
upon their broad shoulders.

As yet the sun knew not her home, nor the moon her power, and the stars
had no fixed dwelling place.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Now the stars are bright fire-sparks sprayed from Muspel-heim over the
great gulf, and these the gods fixed in the heavens to give light to the
world and to shine over the sea. To these and to every wandering
fire-flake they assigned due order and motion, so that each has its set
place and time and season.

The sun and the moon were also regulated in their courses, for these are
the greater fire-disks that were sprayed from Muspel-heim, and to bear
them over the paths of the heavens the gods caused the elf-smiths, the
sons of Ivalde and the kinsmen of Sindre, to fashion chariots of fine
gold.

Mundilfore, who has care of the World-mill, aspired to rival Odin. He
had two beautiful children, and one he called Mani (moon), and the other
Sol (sun). The gods were filled with anger because of Mundilfore's
presumption, and to punish him they took from him his two children, of
whom he was exceedingly boastful, to drive the heavenly chariots and
count the Years for men. Fair Sol they set to drive the sun-chariot. Her
steeds are Arvak, which is "Early Dawn", and Alsvid, which signifies
"scorching heat". Under their withers were placed skins of ice-chilled
air for coolness and refreshment. They enter the eastern heaven at
Hela-gate, through which the souls of dead men pass to the world
beneath.

Then the gods set Mani, the handsome youth, to drive the chariot of the
moon. With him are two fair children whom he carried away from earth--a
boy who was called Hyuki, and a girl whose name is Bil. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15) They had been sent out in the darkness of
night by Vidfinner, their father, to draw song-mead from the mountain
spring Byrger, "the hidden", which broke forth from

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

the source of Mimer's fount; and they filled their pail Saegr to the
brink, so that the precious mead spilled over as they raised it on the
pole Simul. When they began to descend the mountain, Mani seized them
and took them away. The spots that are ever seen by night on the
fair-faced moon are Hyuki and Bil, and beauteous Bil do skalds invoke,
so that hearing them she may sprinkle from the moon the magic song-mead
upon their lips.

In Mani's keeping is a bundle of thorns from which evildoers among met,
must needs suffer the punishment of piercing pains.

The sun is ever in flight, and so also is the moon. They are pursued by
bloodthirsty enemies, who seek to compass their destruction ere they
reach the sheltering forest of the Varns, behind the western horizon.
These are two fierce and gigantic wolves. The one whose name is Skoll,
"the adherer", chases the sun, whom one day it will devour; the other is
Hati, "the hater", who races in front of "the bright maiden of heaven",
in ceaseless pursuit of the moon.

Skoll and Hati are giants in wolf-guise. They were sent forth by the
Mother of Evil, the dark and fearsome Hag, Gulveig-Hoder, whose children
they are. She dwells in the Iarnvid, the black forest of iron trees, on
the world's edge, which is the habitation of a witch family dreaded both
by gods and by men. Of the Hag's wolf-sons the most terrible is Hati,
who is also called Managarm, "the moon devourer". He feeds on the blood
of dying men. The seers have foretold that when he comes to swallow the
moon, the heavens and the earth shall turn red with blood. Then, too,
must the seats of the mighty gods be reddened with gore, and the
sunshine of summer made dim, while great storms burst in fury to rage
across the world.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Again and again, at dreaded eclipse, would these giant wolves have
swallowed now the sun and now the moon, had not their evil designs been
thwarted by spells which were wrought against them, and the clamour of
affrighted men.

Now Nat, which is Night, is the swarthy daughter of the Vana-giant
Narve, "the Binder", whose other name is Mimer. Dark is her hair like
all her race, and her eyes are soft and benevolent. She brings rest to
the toiler, and refreshment to the weary, and sleep and dreams unto all.
To the warrior she gives strength so that he may win victory, and care
and sorrow she loves to take away. Nat is the beneficent mother of gods.
Three times was she wed. Her first husband was Nagelfare of the stars,
and their son was Aud of bounteous riches. Her second husband was Annar,
"Water", and their daughter, Jörd, the earth-goddess, was Odin's wife
and the mother of Thor. Her third husband was Delling, the red elf of
dawn, and their son was Dagr, which is Day.

To mother Nat and her son Dagr were given jewelled chariots to drive
across the world, one after the other, in the space of twelve hours. Nat
is first to set forth. Her steed is called Hrim Faxi, "frosted mane".
Swiftly it gallops over the heavens, and every morn the sweet foam from
its bit falls as dewdrops upon the earth beneath. Dagr's fair steed is
called Skin Faxi, "shining mane". From its golden neck is shed radiance
and beauty upon the heavens and over all the world. Of all coursers that
are, he is praised most by faring men.

There are two seasons, and these are Winter and Summer. Vindsval, son of
gloomy Vasud, "the ice wind", was father of grim Winter, and the mild
and beneficent Svasud was the sire of fair Summer, beloved by all.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

The wonder of men is whence comes the wind that shakes the ocean with
fear, that fans the low spark into bright flame, and that no eye can
behold. At the northern summit of heaven there sits in eagle-guise a
great giant called Hraesvelgur, "the swallower of dead men's flesh".
When his wide pinions are spread for flight the winds are stirred
beneath them and rush down upon the earth. When coming or going, or
travelling hither and thither across the heavens, the winds are driven
from his wings.

As yet there were no men who had their dwelling upon the earth, although
the sun and moon were set in their courses, and the days and seasons
were marked out in due order. There came a time, however, when the sons
of Bor were walking on the world's shores, and they beheld two logs of
wood. They were grown from Ymer's hair, which sprang up as thick forests
and verdure abundant from the mould of his -body, which is the earth.
One log was of an ash tree, and from it the gods shaped a man; and the
other, which was an alder tree, they made into a fair woman. They had
but life like a tree which grows until the gods gave them mind and will
and desire. Then was the man named Ask and the woman Embla, and from
them are descended the entire human race, whose habitation is called
Midgard, "middle ward", and Mana-heim, "home of men".

Round Midgard is the embracing sea, and beyond, on the outward shores,
is Jotun-heim, the home of giants. Against these the gods raised an ice
bulwark shaped from the eyebrows of turbulent Ymer, whose brains they
cast high in heaven, where they became heavy masses of scattered cloud,
tossing hither and thither.

### Address to Odin

In the beginning, ere the gods were born,  
Before the Heavens were builded, thou didst slay  
The giant Ymir, whom the abyss brought forth,  
Thou and thy brethren fierce, the sons of Bor,  
And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void.  
But of his flesh and members thou didst build  
The earth and Ocean, and above them Heaven.  
And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,  
Thou sent'st and fetched'st fire, and madest lights,  
Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in Heaven,  
Dividing clear the paths of night and day.  
And Asgard thou didst build, and Midgard fort;  
Then me thou mad'st; of us the Gods were born.  
Last, walking by the sea, thou foundest spars  
Of wood, and framed'st men, who till the earth,  
Or on the sea, the field of pirates, sail.  
And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,  
Save one, Bergelmer;--he on shipboard fled  
Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang.  
But all that brood thou hast removed far off,  
And set by Ocean's utmost marge to dwell;  
But Hela into Nifelheim thou threw'st,  
And gav'st her nine unlighted worlds to rule,  
A queen, and empire over all the dead.  
           --*From "Balder Dead", by Matthew Arnold*.
