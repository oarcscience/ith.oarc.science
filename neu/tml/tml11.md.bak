WHEN Svipdag had triumphed over Halfdan he returned to Sith, remembering
the promise he had made to rescue Freyja and Frey from the castle of the
giant who held them in captivity. Then he prepared to set out with Ull,
his stepbrother, towards the giants' country--cold and darksome
Jotun-heim. But ere he went, Sith made for the twain the food of wisdom
with the fat of three serpents, so that they might be rendered able to
perform their long and perilous journey. Of the magic food did Svipdag
secure the better portion for himself.

They had need to cross a great magic sea on which dread tempests roared
and whirlpools and treacherous currents were an ever-present danger.
When far from shore the storm-giant came against him, but Svipdag
overcame him in combat. Protected by the incantations of Groa did
Svipdag with Ull make the voyage in safety, until they reached a harbour
nigh to the bleak castle of

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Beli, "the howler", in which Freyja and Frey were imprisoned.

Three sons of the giant met them on the strand. Each of them had Grep
for name, and one, who was a skald, desired to have Freyja for his
bride. With Svipdag and Ull he entered into angry dispute, and sought to
prevail upon them to return from whence they came. But this they scorned
to do, and in the end the giants retreated from the strand.

Then went Svipdag and Ull towards the castle to seek for Freyja and
Frey. The giants were filled with anger, and sought to affright the
young heroes by howling like beasts and bellowing like the storm-god.
The clamour they made was indeed fearsome, and none but brave hearts
could have ventured to make entry to that place of horror.

Within the court Frey and Freyja came to meet them. and they were
surrounded by giant attendants. Svipdag greeted Freyja with a kiss, and
she knew that she would become his bride.

But enchantments had been put upon her and upon Frey by the giants. They
had been given to drink the potion of forgetfulness, so that they had
but vague memory of the past, while deep discontent and haunting misery
were their dower. Frey had deep shame upon him, and he sought nor flight
nor expected happiness any more. In dark despair he lived within the
strong castle of Beli.

Freyja was pale and sorrow stricken. In her heart was keen loathing,
which tortured her, against the Grep who would fain be her favoured
suitor. Her golden locks were twisted hard above her forehead, for Beli
had thus punished her when he took her captive. In vain she had
endeavoured to comb them and win back her

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

extreme beauty, but the spell that was put upon her she could not break.
Her eyes were vacant and sad. She rejoiced not that Svipdag and Ull had
come to rescue her, for her heart was cold and passionless.

Svipdag and Ull entered the wide hall of the castle amidst the bestial
howlings of the dread giants. A great fire burned there because of the
bitter cold that prevailed.

With the giants they sat at feast, and Frey was on a high seat with
pale, unhappy face, while the giants sang loudly and drank deeply about
him.

Now deeply were these fierce furies incensed against Svipdag and Ull,
whom they sought to overcome and put to death. In sharp dispute they
engaged. At length, the Grep who wooed Freyja flung himself upon
Svipdag, but Ull cut him down with his sword and slew him. Then many
fought against Egil's sons, but they were driven back.

In the end the heroes prevailed upon Freyja to flee with them, but on
Frey they could not prevail, for so deeply did he feel his shame that he
could not again appear, he said, before the gods in Asgard.

To Svipdag was Freyja cold and indifferent, nor did she ever raise her
eyes to look at him or open her lips to speak. When they had crossed the
magic sea, they set out to climb the great mountains towards Orvandel's
home, where Sith awaited them; but Freyja showed neither joy nor
gratitude at her escape from the giants.

Then was the heart of Svipdag filled with anger, and he left Freyja to
wander alone. She went towards a desolate land which was the abode of
giantesses, and was found by one, who took her for a slave to tend her
goats. But Svipdag repented, and when his anger passed away he went
again in search of Freyja, for his heart was moved with deep tenderness
towards her.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

From the giantess he rescued her, and they went together on their way.
But that great Hag followed quickly, and swift was the flight of the
lovers, running on skees. Nearer and more near came the monster, but
suddenly the sun rose over the mountains, and she was turned into a
great boulder at the sea's edge.

In Freyja's heart there was yet no gratitude, because of the spells that
were upon her. Nor answer would she make when Svipdag spoke, nor would
she gaze in his eyes to reward him. One brief look was all he desired,
and yet she stared upon the ground disconsolate and silent.

Again did Svipdag wax wroth and leave her to wander alone; and she went
down among the rocks. Then took she the guise of a bird and flew over
the mountains and over the river that separates that wild country from
the land in which Svipdag had his dwelling. She reached the house of
Orvandel. To Sith, who recognized her not, she said that she was a poor
woman who had no home, and she was received with welcome.

But Svipdag knew her and claimed her for his bride, and a wedding feast
was set, and the marriage oath sworn in solemnity and state. Yet was
Freyja cold and passionless. To the bridal chamber they went, and in her
hand Freyja held a candle. She stood motionless before Svipdag until the
candle burned low; and when the flame stung her hand, Svipdag spoke
words of warning. But Freyja felt not the pain because of the greater
pain within her heart.

Then was the spell broken by fire, and she raised her face and looked
with eyes of love upon him who had rescued her. Thus had Svipdag his
exceeding great reward.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

But Freyja vanished from before him, and in falcon-guise she soared to
Asgard, undefiled and pure, and was received with rejoicing by the gods.
Then did Svipdag take his Sword of Victory and set forth towards Asgard
to win Freyja.

But a sorrow no greater than when Freyja was lured away had fallen upon
Asgard because the goddess Idun was lost. For it was she who had in her
keeping the golden apples of eternal youth. In her fast-shut casket she
kept them, and for each one she drew forth another took its place. From
the apples did the gods receive immortality, and when Idun was taken
away they began to grow old. Well they knew that both giants and trolls
had much desire to rob the golden apples from Asgard. So they were sore
troubled, fearing that disaster would fall speedily upon them. On evil
Loke did suspicion fall, and when Odin challenged him, for Idun had last
been seen in company with him, he confessed that he had delivered her to
Thjasse-Volund, her brother, who had forged the Sword of Victory so that
the gods might be overcome.

'Twas thus it fell that Idun was taken from Asgard. One day there went
forth together on a journey Odin and Honer and Loke. It was their desire
to visit the country of Ivalde and his sons, beside Hvergelmer and the
rivers Evilagar, so as to cause the conflict to have end.
Thjasse-Volund, who had escaped from the bonds of Mimer in the guise of
an eagle, had knowledge of their coming and waited for them. In a valley
of oaks the gods rested. There they saw grazing a herd of bears, and one
they caught on which to feast, for they hungered and were weary. The
bear they slew, and when a fire was kindled they roasted it for their
feast. Near by lay a magic rod which Thjasse-Volund had forged with
intent

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

to wreak his vengeance upon the gods, and especially Loke.

Then a great eagle came towards them, and the gods knew it was
Thjasse-Volund who had dominion there.

Hard was the bear to carve, for Ivalde's son had put enchantments upon
it, and of this had Odin full knowledge. So he addressed Thjasse and
said: "Why hast thou done this, thou maker of ornaments in eagle guise?"

Thjasse said that he desired his share. Odin had not, however, any
knowledge of the evil intent of the eagle, and consented that he should
divide the meal with them. Whereupon Thjasse flew down and sought to
take so large a share that Loke, in his wrath, seized the magic rod to
strike at him. When he did that he was in the eagle's power. He could
not unclasp his hands from the rod, and the other end was fixed in the
claws of the eagle, which flew high, carrying Loke with him. In vain did
he seek to be released, and over the oak trees was he dragged and sorely
beaten until he was near to being torn to pieces. Loke was heavy and the
eagle sank to the ground. Then Loke offered Thjasse any ransom he would
demand if he would but let him escape, for he was compelled to plead for
his life.

Thjasse demanded his sister Idun, who had been taken away by Loke when
the sons of Ivalde were the willing servants of the gods. Loke promised
to deliver her to him secretly, and was then released by his dread
captor. The gods returned to Asgard together, and evil Loke fulfilled
his promise, nor gave Odin knowledge of his doings.

Thus it came that when he made confession of his deed the gods were
moved to anger against him, and threatened to put him to death. But Loke
made vows

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

to restore Idun to Asgard, and flew forth towards the dominion of
Thjasse-Volund in the bird-guise of Freyja.

The loss of Idun had dread effect in Midgard as in Asgard. Cold winds
blew from the north. The power of the Frost-giants increased, and they
swarmed southward in great hosts. Halfdan, they knew, was slain, and
that the gods had loss of power because that Idun had been taken away.
Icy arrows were shot over the earth, killing man and beast and each
thing that grew. The heavens were disturbed. Nearer sun and moon crept
the giant wolves. From Urd's fountain was slowly departing the power to
give warmth to the World-tree Ygdrasil. Out of Jotun-heim. rose songs of
rejoicing and vengeance that were heard in Asgard, and the gods, growing
old, feared that the end of all things was drawing very nigh. To Mimer's
grove were sent swift messengers, so that from the Norris might be
received knowledge of the world's fate and that of the gods.

So did gods and men suffer because Idun, the goddess of regeneration,
was taken away. The death-cold storm-spears were turned against gods and
men. The murder-frost held Midgard with iron grasp.

Idun was found by Loke in Thjasse's dwelling, and he put enchantments
upon her and she became a nut. Then he flew with her in his claws
towards Asgard. But ere he set off, Loke, the tempter, made known to
Thjasse what he had done, and challenged him to follow. In eagle-guise
angry Thjasse pursued the god. So swiftly did he fly that he came very
nigh to Loke ere yet he had reached the safety of Asgard. Then he flew
midst the vafer-flames in the kindling vapour cloud, and fell scorched
within the walls. Thor seized his hammer, which Sindre had again forged,
and slew him. Thus did Thjasse-Volund, who had shaped the Sword of
Victory,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

fall in his shame and perish because of Loke's evil doings.

Meanwhile in Asgard did Freyja await the coming of Svipdag, whom she
loved; and him the gods awaited also, because he carried the Sword of
Victory.

Svipdag's heart was filled with longing for Freyja, nor could he sleep
or rest until he found her. The protection of Groa's incantations was
still upon him, and it was Urd's will that he should reach Asgard. So he
went again on a perilous journey. Unto Hela he went, over bleak
tremendous mountains and through storms and blinding mist, until he
reached the foundations of Bif-rost. Heimdal, the shining sentinel,
beheld him as he stepped upon the Bridge of the Gods with the gleaming
Sword of Victory girdled by his side. But no warning did he sound, for
it was the will of Odin that Freyja's lover should stand before the gate
of Asgard. So Svipdag ascended until he beheld the ramparts of the
celestial city. There he perceived Odin nor knew who he was.

Roughly did the god receive his greetings. "This", he said, "is no place
for beggars; return by the moist ways whence you came."

But Svipdag remonstrated, and claimed hospitality, being a weary
traveller, and Odin made answer again that he could not enter, although
less harshly, for the noble bearing of the youth gave pleasure to his
eyes.

"From here, cried Svipdag, "I cannot turn my eyes away because of its
exceeding great beauty. Here would I find happiness and peace."

"Who art thou?" Odin asked.

"My name," said Svipdag, "is Windcold, and I am the son of Springcold,
whose sire was Very-cold."

Now Svipdag had caught a radiant glimpse of Asgard's beauties. He saw
its halls of glittering gold, and especially

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the Hall of Gladness, which is the dwelling of Freyja, and is nigh to
the gate. He also beheld Freyja, whom he loved, sitting on the
flower-decked Rock of Joy, which gives health to those who seek it with
prayer. She was surrounded by her maids--Eil, the healer; Hlif, the
protectress; Bjort, the shining; Blid, the blithe; and Frid, the
fair--they had power to give healing to men and women who called upon
them from Midgard and offered up sacrifices. Freyja was silent and in
deep thought. Like a graven statue she sat in virgin beauty, blue-eyed
with golden hair--she who has care of lovelorn maidens and mothers and
their babes. She wore her gleaming necklace which the elf-smiths had
made with sparkling jewels of the sky and bright spring-flowers, for the
fair goddess was "The Lover of Ornaments".

Freyja sat beneath the branches of Ygdrasil, and these Svipdag beheld
with wonder. He saw its magical fruit, and in the branches sat the cock
Goldcomb, with feathers of gleaming gold.

Svipdag turned his eyes upon Asgard's wondrous gate, and saw before it
the two great wolf-dogs which kept watch by night and by day, for when
one slept the other was awake. They had power to kill giants and put to
flight through the air the flying trolls that came against Asgard in the
darkness.

"Can a stranger enter?" the young hero asked of Odin.

"No stranger can come within," the god made answer, "unless he brings
with him the Sword of Victory."

"How can the dogs be passed?" asked Svipdag.

Odin made reply that no one could pass the dogs unless he could give
them to eat of the flesh upon the legs of Goldcomb.

When Svipdag asked how the cock which sat on the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> World-tree could
be killed, Odin said that there was but one sword with which it could be
slain, and it had been kept in Hela's cave, nor could it be obtained
from the watchman unless he were given the ankle bones of Goldcomb.

"Can no man enter the city and go unto Freyja?" the hero asked.

"No man can enter," was Odin's answer, "save Svipdag."

"Then open the gates," the hero cried, "for I am he. Svipdag has come to
seek for Freyja."

Then he crossed the river unscathed by vafer-flame, for the gates of
Asgard flew open. The dogs fawned to him and bayed joyous welcome.

From the rock on which she sat hastened Freyja, and when she knew that
it was indeed Svipdag who had come, she cried: "Welcome, my lover! Now
is my great desire fulfilled. Long have I waited, sitting on the rock,
looking for you by day and by night. All my desires are indeed fulfilled
because you are once again by my side."

'Twas thus that Svipdag entered Asgard, bearing with him the Sword of
Victory which had been forged to bring ruin to the gods. Love had
triumphed over hate, and the designs of Loke were thwarted, for Svipdag
had Freyja for his wife and the sons of Ivalde were reconciled to the
gods.

Then was Ull brought to Asgard, and Sith also. The eyes of
Thjasse-Volund were placed in heaven to shine as stars, and Orvandel,
who was dead, was also raised among the star-heroes.

Meanwhile Njord had journeyed to Jotun-heim, where he rescued from the
giant's castle his son Frey. In his wrath did Frey kill Beli, "the
howler", with a stag's horn

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

which he plucked from the wall when the spells that bound him were taken
off.

To Frey was given by Svipdag the Sword of Victory, and the joy of peace
fell upon Asgard when he returned.

But still the Hag abode among the gods in the guise of a maid who sat at
Freyja's feet. It was fated that she would cause yet another and greater
war in Asgard and in Midgard ere her power would be overcome.
