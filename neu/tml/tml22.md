THERE was a Vala who sang of the end of all things, of the doom of gods
and men, of the last dread battle and Odin's death, and of the coming of
Surtur, whose flames shall consume the world. In mid-air she sang, and
at high noon. Odin, sitting in his throne of gold, was silent, and
listening he understood, for from the beginning he had foreknowledge of
the end. Yet was he not afraid. He awaited Ragnarok, "the Dusk of the
Gods", as in youth he had waited, and now he was grown old.

.       .       .       .       .       .

It was thus the Vala sang:

"The Age of Evil hath come upon earth--the Knife Age, the Axe Age, and
the Age of Cloven Shields. The violent fall upon the peaceful; brothers
slay brothers, and the children of sisters are shedding one another's
blood. Great luxuries do men seek, and sensual sin prevails. The world
is doomed, yet is it hard and cruel and full of sin. Thick-pressed in
Hela's heavy streams doth Urd behold wading confusedly perjurers and
murderers and evildoers without number. . . .

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

"Follows the Age of Northern Winds. Sword blasts are cleaving the
darkened skies. Fierce beasts from forests and mountains and barren
wilds seek their prey among men. None spares his neighbour, nor lifts a
hand to save. . . .

"Fimbul Winter is now come. Heavy snows are driven and fall from the
world's four corners; the murder frost prevails. The sun is darkened at
noon; it sheds no gladness; devouring tempests bellow and never end. In
vain do men await the coming of summer. Thrice winter follows winter
over a world which is snow-smitten, frost-fettered, and chained in ice.
. . . Yet wars are waged, blood is shed, and evil grows greater. . . .

"Suddenly Goldcomb crows loud in Asgard; from Hela's depths the Red
Fire-Cock makes answer. On a hilltop in Ironwood the Storm-Eagle flaps
heavily its wings, and tempests bellow over ocean and land. . . .

"The giants have gathered to assail Asgard. To Bif-rost they hasten: at
the north end are Frost-giants and Mountain-giants; at the south end are
the dread sons of Suttung. Heimdal beholds them. In his hand is the
Gjallar-horn, which has long been hidden in the deepest shade of
Ygdrasil, and from it he blows a thunder blast which awakens the nine
worlds. . . . Mimer's seven sons start from sleep in Hela's golden hall,
and arm themselves for conflict. . . . Odin talks with Mimer's head; he
divines the end of all things, and unafraid he plans his battle array in
the last conflict.

"With clamour and speed the giants ascend Bif-rost, and the sublime
bridge breaks with the weight of riders, whereat Ygdrasil quakes--the
old ash, deep-rooted and strong-rooted, trembles standing, so that the
worlds are shaken and the bonds of fettered giants are broken. Loud
barks Garm on the rocky isle of the Gulf of Black

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Grief, for the
wolf Fenrer escapes and Loke is set free, Snapped are the cords that
bind Naglefar, the great Ship of Death; it breaks loose. . . .

"The gods are unafraid; they sit in counsel in their High Thingstead.
But Njord leaves Asgard and returns to the wise Vans, for the war is
waged against the Asa-gods, and Suttung seeks to be avenged upon Odin. .
. .

"The elves tremble, and the dwarfs shudder in dim-discovered caverns;
they hide behind their rocky walls. In Jotun-heim there is loud
bellowing and defiance, and terror spreads among men in Midgard. White
fear passes over Hela, for the uncertain conflict is at hand. The sons
of Mimer guard the gate: their long swords are in their hands. . . .

"In gloomy Ironwood the ice-cold heart of Angerboda is made glad. Gymer
sits upon a mound alone, playing a harp; he is merry because of what is
at hand. Long hath he awaited the hour of doom. To him comes
Fjalar-Suttung, creator of illusions, in the guise of Hela's red cock,
and he seeks the Sword of Victory which Gymer hath guarded--the sword
which Thjasse-Volund forged with spells to wreak vengeance upon the
gods, which Mimer captured and Svipdag found, the sword which Frey
should wield in the last battle, and he yet gave to Angerboda for love
of Gerd. To Fjalar-Suttung is the Sword of Victory given up, and he
hastens to Surtur. . . .

"Now from the east drives Hrym; a buckler covers him, and his hordes
follow. The Midgard serpent is shaken with giant rage, for its hour hath
come; it writhes and wallows on Ocean's slimy floor, so that billows are
raised and driven over Midgard high as the mountains; it rears its
shaggy head out of the sea; venom-spotted is its body, and fire fumes it
sends forth.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In Ironwood the
storm eagle rises with beating wings. It snaps its sharp beak; it
hungers for dead men's flesh. . . .

"The Ship of Death is sailing over the sea. On board are the sons of
Muspel, who were bound; the stricken Jotuns, freed from bonds; Garm, the
watch-dog; and the unfettered wolf Fenrer. Monsters gaunt and grim are
in the ship, and Hel is there also. Loke is the pilot and holds the
rudder. To Ironwood he steers over it his host he shall lead to the
plain of Vigrid. . . .

"From the south comes black Surtur. In his hand flames the Sword of
Victory, which he hath received from Suttung. Seething fire gleams from
the sunbright blade, and his bleak avengers follow him. . . .

Mountains are shaken and the rocks tremble. The giant maids are stricken
with fear. Mortals n Midgard are strewn in death, and their shades crowd
the path to Hela. Heaven yawns; it is rent in twain because that Surtur
issues forth. . . .

"On the plains of Vigrid is the last battle fought, A hundred miles it
stretches in length, and a hundred miles in width, enclosing the wood of
Vidar the Silent, where Odin is doomed to die. . . . The hosts of evil
come against the hosts of Asgard. Frey leads the heroes of Valhal in the
fray. He goes against black Surtur, unarmed and without fear, and by the
Sword of Victory he is slain.

"Against strong Tyr leaps Garm, the fierce wolf-dog, and in dread
conflict they engage; and one by the other is wounded, so that both fall
dead.

"Loke battles with Heimdal, but against the shining hero the Evil One
cannot prevail. Terrible is Loke's aspect after long torture, for his
beard and hair have grown like horns. With his bright sword the watchman

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

of Bif-rost takes his head. But even after death is the Evil One
avenged, for his head strikes the body of Heimdal, who is grievously
wounded thereby and brought to life's end.

"There is no longer fear in Hela; the sons of Mimer rejoice because that
Loke is dead.

"Thor is engaged in fierce combat with the Midgard serpent. Long is the
strife and uncertain. The serpent is coiled and uncoiled; it writhes
before Thor; it avoids his hammer blows, and over him it pours floods of
venom. Terrible is the wrath of the thunder-god, and fain would he smite
his enemy, dreading that he will be overcome. But at length he prevails.
Thunder bellows loud and Mjolner flashes fire as Thor smites the
deathblow, and the monster is stretched dying upon the plain. Great
renown, indeed, hath the God of Thunder gained, yet pays he life's cost
for the victory. With its last fierce breath the serpent sends forth
suffocating venom fumes, and Thor staggers back nine paces. Then with a
thunder groan the victor falls dead. . . .

"How fares Odin in this dread hour? He combats with the ravenous wolf
Fenrer, the avenging monster which broke free from its bonds. From earth
to heaven its jaws gape. Fiery flames dart from its nostrils and from
its eyes. Odin fights with his spear Gungner, and violent are his blows.
He rides on Sleipner; on his head gleams his helmet of gold; his blue
robe streams behind. Fearless is Odin and proud, and his form is stately
in this his hour of doom. Naught can avail him in the great combat. He
is stricken down in his splendour, and by the wolf is he devoured.

"Yet short-lived is the triumph of Fenrer. Strong Vidar the Silent
advances speedily to avenge his sire's death. His iron-shod foot is
stamped on the monster's

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

under jaw. He struggles fiercely with the terrible wolf, for he is
stronger and must prevail. In the end he tears asunder the great jaws,
and plunges his spear in Fenrer's heart through that throat of fire.
Thus Odin is avenged. . . .

"How fares the Asa-hosts when Odin and Thor fall, and Tyr and Frey lie
dead? The heroes of Valhal are scattered, hordes of giants are killed,
and the field is wet with blood. The black dragon Nidhog is soaring
through the air with rustling wings. It flies towards the plain of
battle and swallows the bodies of the dead. . . . Surtur alone prevails.

"In Heaven there is disaster. Closer and closer hath the giant wolf
Skoll crept towards the sun, and now he swallows it. By Hati-Managarm is
the moon devoured.

"So is the sun darkened at high noon, the heavens and the earth are
turned red with blood, the seats of the mighty gods drip gore. So is the
moon lost in blackness, while the stars vanish from the skies.

"Now Surtur completes creation's doom. He casts his firebrands against
the scattered Asa-hosts, and those who remain are burned up, save Vale
and Vidar, sons of Odin, and Modi and Magni, sons of Thor. Midgard is
swept by flame; the smoke curls round mountain tops; all things are
burned up; nothing with life remains. Asgard is scorched, and fire
envelops the withering trunk of Ygdrasil. Even Nidhog is destroyed in
its flight. . . . Earth, smouldering and black, sinks into Ocean; the
billows cover it. . . .

"Now there is naught but thick blackness and silence unbroken. The end
hath come-Ragnarok, 'the Dusk of the Gods'!"

.       .       .       .       .       .

Silent was then the voice of the Vala in mid-air and

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

at high noon. Odin sat in his throne of gold listening through the
stillness, unafraid, waiting for Ragnarok and his own doom. Waited he
also for the song's end and the promise of Time's new morning, when evil
would cease to be and Balder would come back.

The skylark soars till its song falls weakly; at morn is its singing
fresh and sweet. Sweet, too, and fresh was the song of the Vala when
Odin heard, sitting in his throne, her voice falling through the
stillness, afar off but clear.

.       .       .       .       .       .

"In Hela's realms there is sure defence. None goeth thither to conquer,
and the long swords are unstained with blood. The fire hath reached not
the Underworld. Mimer's seven sons, who have awakened, sleep not again.
The roots of Ygdrasil are watered once more from Mimer's well; fire has
destroyed not the tree save those branches which had withered; it grows
green again.

"The World's New Age hath dawned. The sun is bright in heaven, for
Balder hath returned. Earth rises a second time, from the deep sea; it
rises clad with green verdure. The sound of falling waters fills the
morning air. High soars the eagle; from the mountain ridge he espies the
fish. . . .

"Asgard is again made fair. The young gods arrive. Balder is there, and
Hodur, his brother; Vale and Vidar are there also, and Mode and Magne,
who bear with them Mjolner, the hammer of Thor. Honer, who reads the
future, is in their midst; he is able to choose his part.

"Of the evils and perils of past time do the gods converse. Midgard's
serpent they call to mind and the wolf Fenrer. They forget not the
judgments of the

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

gods and the antique mysteries. They remember the sacred runes of mighty
Odin. On the grass they find the tablets of gold with which in the
Golden Age was played the game of the gods. So did the Asa clan find
them on Time's fair morning ere yet by the Hag was Asgard corrupted.

"The world is decked in beauty. Fields yield produce without being sown.
Evil is ended and every ill hath ceased. Balder hath indeed returned,
and with Hodur he dwells in the holy halls of Odin.

"The sons of the two brothers are in the vast abode of the winds, the
wide free hall of the cloud drift. In the sun chariot is Sol's daughter,
who is more beautiful than was Sol, and she drives in brightness over a
heaven of blue.

"Lifthraser and Lif and their descendants, who are the regenerating
race, have come from Mimer's realm to inhabit Midgard. Pure are they and
without stain. Honey-dew is their food in Time's new morning: their
children shall overspread the earth.

"The new race shall dwell, when life ends, in their hall which is named
Gimle. Brighter it shines than the sun, and its roof is of gold, and it
stands in high heaven. There indeed shall the holy ones dwell in peace
and eternal joy for evermore.

"Northward on Nida mountains is a golden hall. The sons of Mimer and
Sindre's race have dwelling within it. In heaven there is also the hall
Brimer, where mead drinkers sit round the board amidst plenty and in
peace.

"The evil ones who have fallen from their high state dwell in Naastrand.
A vast hall it is, and of great height. Its doors are open to the north.
With serpents was it built; they are entwined so that their backs are
outward and their heads are within. Venom drops from

their jaws; it burns the sinners on the benches beneath; they wade
through venom floods in the hall. . . .

"Odin returns not again, nor Heimdal. Another comes who is more mighty.
Him I dare not name, for he is All-father. He comes to the great
judgment; he utters decrees. He governeth all realms, by him are all
things swayed. He settles strife; he makes war to cease. He ordains
sacred laws which are inviolable and shall flourish for ever."

.       .       .       .       .       .

The Vala's song was ended, and Odin sat in his golden throne, pondering
in silence.

### Regeneration

Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads  
Another Heaven, the boundless--no one yet  
Hath reach'd it; there hereafter shall arise  
The second Asgard, with another name.  
Thither, when o'er this present earth and Heavens  
The tempest of the latter days hath swept,  
And they from sight have disappear'd, and sunk,  
Shall a small remnant of the Gods repair;  
Hoder and I shall join them from the grave.  
There re-assembling we shall see emerge  
From the bright Ocean at our feet an earth  
More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits  
Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,  
Who then shall live in 'peace, as now in war.  
But we in Heaven shall find again with joy  
The ruin'd palaces of Odin, seats  
Familiar, halls where we have supp'd of old;  
Re-enter them with wonder, never fill  
Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears.  
And we shall tread once more the well-known plain <span id="page_186">p.
186</span>  
Of Ida, and among the grass shall find  
The golden dice wherewith we play'd of yore;  
And that will bring to mind the former life  
And pastime of the Gods, the wise discourse  
Of Odin, the delights of other days.  
           --*From "Balder Dead", by Matthew Arnold*.
