#### GILGAMESH

Aelian, who lived about 200 A.D., relates in his "Animal Stories" the
history of *a boy who was saved by an eagle:* 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Animals have a characteristic fondness for man. An eagle is known to
have nourished a child. I shall tell the entire story, in proof of my
assertion. When Senechoros reigned over the Babylonians, the Chaldean
fortunetellers foretold that the son of the king's daughter would take
the kingdom from his grandfather; this verdict was a prophecy of the
Chaldeans. The king was afraid of this prophecy, and humorously
speaking, he became a second Acrisius for his daughter, over whom he
watched with the greatest severity. But his daughter, fate being wiser
than the Babylonian,

conceived secretly from an inconspicuous man. For fear of the king, the
guardians threw the child down from the acropolis, where the royal
daughter was imprisoned. The eagle, with his keen eyes, saw the boy's
fall, and before the child struck the earth, he caught it on his back,
bore it into a garden, and set it down with great care. When the
overseer of the place saw the beautiful boy, he was pleased with him and
raised him. The boy received the name Gilgamesh, and became the king of
Babylonia. If anyone regards this as a fable, I have nothing to say,
although I have investigated the matter to the best of my ability. Also
of Achaemenes, the Persian, from whom the nobility of the Persians is
derived, I learn that he was the pupil of an eagle. <span
