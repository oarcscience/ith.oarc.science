<p>Aelian, who lived about 200 A.D., relates in his "Animal Stories" the history of <i>a boy who was saved by an eagle:</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Animals have a characteristic fondness for man. An eagle is known to have nourished a child. I shall tell the entire story, in proof of my assertion. When Senechoros reigned over the Babylonians, the Chaldean fortunetellers foretold that the son of the king's daughter would take the kingdom from his grandfather; this verdict was a prophecy of the Chaldeans.

The eagle, with his keen eyes, saw the boy's fall, and before the child struck the earth, he caught it on his back, bore it into a garden, and set it down with great care. When the overseer of the place saw the beautiful boy, he was pleased with him and raised him. The boy received the name Gilgamesh, and became the king of Babylonia. If anyone regards this as a fable, I have nothing to say, although I have investigated the matter to the best of my ability. Also of Achaemenes, the Persian, from whom the nobility of the Persians is derived, I learn that he was the pupil of an eagle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="mbh10.htm#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></div></p>
