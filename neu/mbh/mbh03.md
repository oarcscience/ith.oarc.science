#### MOSES

The biblical birth history of Moses, which is told in the second chapter
of Exodus, presents the greatest similarity to the Sargon legend, even
an almost literal correspondence of individual traits. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30) Already the first chapter (22.md) relates
that Pharaoh commanded his people to throw into

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the river all sons that were born to Hebrews, while the daughters were
permitted to live; the reason for this order is given as fear of the
overfertility of the Israelites. The second chapter continues as
follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
of Levi. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) And the woman conceived,
and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid
him three months. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for
him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's
brink. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and
her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark
among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. And when she had opened
it, she saw the child and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion
on him and said, this is one of the Hebrews' children. Then said his
sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the
Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? And Pharaoh's
daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's
mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
child, and nursed it. And the child grew, and she brought him unto
Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
Moses: <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) and she said, Because I drew
him out of the water.

</div>

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

This account is ornamented by rabbinical mythology with an account of
the events preceding Moses' birth. In the sixtieth year after Joseph's
death, the reigning Pharaoh saw in a dream an old man who held a pair of
scales; all the inhabitants of Egypt lay on one side, with only a
suckling Iamb on the other, but nevertheless this outweighed all the
Egyptians. The startled king at once consulted the wise men and
astrologers, who declared the dream to mean that a son would be born to
the Israelites who would destroy all Egypt. The king was frightened, and
at once ordered the death of all newborn children of the Israelites in
the entire country. On account of this tyrannical order, the Levite
Amram, who lived in Goshen, decided to separate from his wife Jochebed,
so as not to foredoom to certain death the children conceived through
him. But this resolution was opposed later on by his daughter Miriam,
who foretold with prophetic assurance that precisely the child suggested
in the king's dream would come forth from her mother's womb, and would
become the liberator of his people. <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md)

Amram therefore rejoined his wife, from whom he had been separated for
three years. At the end of three months, she conceived, and later on
bore a boy at whose birth the entire house was illuminated by an
extraordinary luminous radiance, suggesting the truth of the
prophecy. <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md)

Similar accounts are given of the birth of the ancestor of the Hebrew
nation, Abraham. He was a son of Terah--Nimrod's captain--and Amtelai.
Prior to his birth, it was revealed to King Nimrod from the stars that
the coming child would overthrow the thrones of powerful princes and
take possession of their lands. King Nimrod planned to have the child
killed immediately after its birth. But when the boy was requested from
Terah, he said, "Truly a son was born to me, but he has died." He then
delivered a strange child, concealing his own son in a cave underneath
the ground, where God permitted him to suck milk from a finger of the
right hand. In this cave, Abraham is

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

said to have remained until the third (according to others the tenth)
year of his life. <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](mbh04.htm#fn_35.md)

In the next generation, in the story of Isaac, the same mythological
motifs appear. Prior to his birth, King Abimelech is warned by a *dream*
not to touch Sarah, as this would cause woe to betide him. After a long
period of barrenness, she finally bears her son, who (in later life, in
this report) after having been destined to be *sacrificed by his own
father*, Abraham, is ultimately rescued by God. But Abraham casts out
his elder son Ishmael, with Hagar, the boy's mother. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[15:1](mbh02.htm#fr_29.md) The various translations
of the partly mutilated text differ only in unessential details. Compare
Hommel: *History of Babylonia and Assyria* (Berlin, 1885), p. 302, where
the sources of the tradition are likewise found; and A. Jeremias: *The
Old Testament in the Light of the Ancient Orient*, ad ed. (Leipzig,
1906), p. 410.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[15:2](mbh03.htm#fr_30.md) On account of these
resemblances, a dependence of the Exodus tale from the Sargon legend has
often been assumed, but apparently not enough attention has been paid to
certain fundamental distinctions, which will be taken up in detail in
the interpretation.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[16:1](mbh03.htm#fr_31.md) The parents of Moses
were originally nameless, as were all persons in this, the oldest
account. Their names were only conferred upon them by the priesthood.
Chapter 6.20, says: "And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to
wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses"; Numbers 26.58 adds: ". . . and
Miriam their sister." Also compare Winckler: *History of Israel*, Vol.
II; and Jeremias, op. cit., p. 408.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[16:2](mbh03.htm#fr_32.md) The name, according to
Winckler ("*Die babylonische Geisteskultur* . . ." loc. cit., p. 119),
means "The Water-Drawer" (see also Winckler: *Ancient Oriental Studies*,
Vol. III, pp. 468 ff.)--which would still further approach the Moses
legend to the Sargon legend, for the name Akki signifies "I have drawn
water."

<span id="fn_33"></span>[17:1](mbh03.htm#fr_33.md) Schemot Rabba 2.4 says
concerning Exodus 1.22 that Pharaoh was told by the astrologers of a
woman who was pregnant with the Redeemer of Israel.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[17:2](mbh03.htm#fr_34.md) After Bergel: *Mythology
of the Hebrews* (Leipzig, 1882).
