#### PERSEUS

Acrisius, the king of Argos, had already reached an advanced age without
having male progeny. As he desired a son, he consulted the Delphian
oracle, but this warned him against male descendants, and informed him
that his daughter Danaë would bear a son through whose hand he would
perish. In order to prevent this, he had his daughter locked up in an
iron tower, which he caused to be carefully guarded. But Zeus penetrated
through the roof, in the guise of a golden shower, and Danaë became the
mother of a boy. <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md) One day Acrisius
heard the voice of young Perseus in his daughter's room, and in this way
learned that she had given birth to a child. *He killed the nurse*, but
carried his daughter with her son to the domestic

altar of Zeus, to have an oath taken on the true father's name. But he
refuses to believe his daughter's statement that Zeus is the father, and
*he encloses her with the child in a box, which is cast into the
sea*. <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](mbh09.htm#fn_47.md) The box is carried by
the waves to the coast of Seriphos, where Dictys, *a fisherman*, usually
called a brother of King Polydectes, *saves mother and child by drawing
them out of the sea with his nets*. Dictys leads the two into his house
and keeps them as his relations. Polydectes, however, becomes enamored
of the beautiful mother, and *as Perseus was in his way, he tried to
remove him* by sending him forth to fetch the head of the Gorgon Medusa.
But against the king's anticipations Perseus accomplishes this difficult
task, and a number of heroic deeds besides. Later, in throwing the discs
during a contest, he accidentally kills his grandfather, as foretold by
the oracle. He becomes the king of Argos, then of Tiryns, and the
builder of Mycenae. <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](mbh09.htm#fn_48.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_45"></span>[25:1](mbh07.htm#fr_45.md) In the version of
Euripides, Aleos *caused the mother and the child to be thrown into the
sea in a box*, but through the protection of Athena this box was carried
to the end of the Mysian river Kaikos. There it was found by Teuthras
who made Auge his wife and took her child into his house as his foster
son.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[25:2](mbh08.htm#fr_46.md) Later authors, including
Pindar, state that Danaë was impregnated, not by Zeus, but by the
brother of her father.
