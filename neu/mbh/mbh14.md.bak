#### JESUS

The Gospel according to Luke (1:26-35) relates the prophecy of the birth
of Jesus, as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel sent from God unto a city of
Galilee, named Nazareth, *to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was
Joseph*, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And the
angel came in unto her, and said, Hail! thou that art highly favored,
the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw
him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of
salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary:
for thou hast found favour

</div>

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

with God. And, behold, *thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth
a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great and shall be
called the Son of the Highest:* and the Lord God shalt give unto him the
throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob
for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto
the angel, How shall this be, *seeing I know not a man?* And the angel
answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy
thing which shall be born of thee *shall be called the Son of God*.

</div>

This report is supplemented by the Gospel according to Matthew
(1:18-25), in the narrative of the birth and childhood of Jesus: <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: when as his mother Mary
was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, *she was found with
child of the Holy Ghost*. Then Joseph, her husband, being a just man,
and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her
away privily. But, while he thought on these things, behold, *the angel
of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream*, saying, Joseph, thou son of
David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is
conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son,
and thou shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
their sins. Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken of the Lord by

</div>

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall
bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as
the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife: *And
knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:* and he
called his name JESUS.

</div>

Here we interpolate the detailed account of the birth of Jesus, from
Gospel of Luke (2:4-20):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
Judæa, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he
was of the house and lineage of David:) to be taxed with Mary his
espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they
were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And
*she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger;* <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)
because there was no room for them in the inn. And there were in the
same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their
flocks by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the
glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid. And
the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born
this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And
this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in
swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the
angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory
to God in the Highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. And it
came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,

</div>

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
and see this thing which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known
unto us. And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
babe lying in a manger. And when they had seen it, they made known
abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. And all
they that heard wondered at those things which were told them by the
shepherds. But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her
heart. And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all
the things which they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.

</div>

We now continue the account after Matthew, in the second chapter:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
king, behold, there came *wise men from the east* to Jerusalem, Saying,
*Where is he that is born King of the Jews?* for we have seen his star
in the east, and are come to worship him. When Herod the king had heard
these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he
had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together,
he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him,
In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou
Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of
Juda, for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people
Israel.

Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them
diligently what time the star appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem,
and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have
found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which
they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over
where the young child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with
exceeding great joy.

</div>

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with
Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had
opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh. And being warned of God in a dream, that they
should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another
way. And when they were departed, behold, *the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt*, and be thou there until I bring
thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. When he
arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed
into Egypt: and was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of
Egypt have I called my son.

Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and *slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under*,
according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.
. . .

But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt, Saying, Arise, and take the young child and
his. mother, and go into the land of Israel: *for they are dead which
sought the young child's life*. And he arose, and took the young child
and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard
Archelaus did reign in Judæa in the room of his father Herod, he was
afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream,
he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: And he came and dwelt in a
city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. <span

Similar birth legends to those of Jesus have also been transmitted of
other founders of religions, such as Zoroaster, who is said to have
lived about the year 1000 B.C. His mother, Dughda, dreams, *in the sixth
month of her pregnancy*, that the wicked and the good spirits are
fighting for the embryonic Zoroaster; a monster tears the future
Zoroaster from the mother's womb; but a light god fights the monster
with his horn of light, re-encloses the embryo in the mother's womb,
blows upon Dughda, and she becomes pregnant again. On awakening, she
hurries in her fear to a wise dream-interpreter, who is unable to
explain the wonderful dream before the end of three days. He then
declares that the child she is carrying is destined to become a man of
great importance; the dark cloud and the mountain of light signify that
she and her son will at first have to undergo numerous trials, through
tyrants and other enemies, but at last they will overcome all perils.
Dughda at once returns to her home and informs Pourushacpa, her husband,
of everything that has happened. Immediately after his birth, the boy
was seen to laugh; this was the first miracle through which he drew
attention to himself. *The magicians announce the birth of the child as
a portent of disaster to the prince of the realm*, Durânsarûn, who
betakes himself without delay to the dwelling of Pourushacpa, in order
to stab the child. But his hand falls paralyzed, and he must leave with
his errand undone; this was the second miracle. Soon after, the wicked
demons steal the child from his mother and carry him into the desert, in
order to kill him; but Dughda finds the unharmed child, calmly sleeping.
This is the third miracle. Later on, Zoroaster was to be trampled upon,
in a narrow passageway,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

by a herd of oxen, by command of the king. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](mbh15.htm#fn_77.md) But the largest of the cattle
took the child between his feet and preserved it from harm. This was the
fourth miracle. The fifth is merely a repetition of the preceding: what
the cattle had refused to do, was to be accomplished by horses. But
again the child was protected by a horse from the hoofs of the other
horses. Durânsurûn thereupon had the cubs in a wolf's den killed during
the absence of the old wolves, and Zoroaster was laid down in their
place. But a god closed the jaws of the furious wolves, so that they
could not harm the child. Two divine cows arrived instead and presented
their udders to the child, giving it to drink. This was the sixth
miracle through which Zoroaster's life was preserved. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[2](mbh15.htm#fn_78.md)

Related themes are also encountered in the history of Buddha (sixth
century before Christ), such as the long sterility of the parents, the
dream, the birth of the boy under the open sky, the death of the mother
and her substitution by a foster mother, the announcing of the birth to
the ruler of the realm, and later on the losing of the boy in the
temple. <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](mbh15.htm#fn_79.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[50:1](mbh13.htm#fr_73.md) After Preller, op. cit.,
Vol. II, p. 123.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[51:1](mbh14.htm#fr_74.md) For the formal
demonstration of the entire identity with the other hero myths of the
birth story and early history of Jesus, the author has presumed to
rearrange the corresponding paragraphs from the different versions in
the Gospels, irrespective of the traditional sequence and the
originality of the individual parts. The age, origin, and genuineness of
these parts are briefly summarized and discussed in W. Soltan: *Birth
History of Jesus Christ* (Leipzig, 1902). The transmitted versions of
the several Gospels--which according to Usener: "The Birth and Childhood
of Christ," in *Lectures and Essays* (Leipzig, 1907), contradict and
even exclude each other--have been placed, or left, in juxtaposition,
precisely for the reason that the apparently contradictory elements in
these birth myths are to be elucidated in the present research, no
matter if these contradictions be encountered within a single uniform
saga, or in its different versions (as, for example, in the Cyrus myth).

<span id="fn_75"></span>[52:1](mbh14.htm#fr_75.md) Concerning the birth of
Jesus in a cave, and the furnishing of the birthplace with the typical
animals (ox and ass), compare Jeremias: *Babylonisches im Neuen
Testament* (Leipzig, 1905), p. 56; and Preuschen, "*Jesu Geburt in einer
Höhle*," *Zeitschrift für die Neutest. Wissenschaften*, 1902, p. 359.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[54:1](mbh14.htm#fr_76.md) According to recent
investigations, the birth history of Christ is said have the greatest
resemblance with the royal Egyptian myth, over five thousand years old,
which relates the birth of Amenophis III. Here again recurs the divine
prophecy of the birth of a son, to the waiting queen; <span
id="page_55">p. 55</span> her fertilization by the breath of heavenly
fire; the divine cows, which nurse the newborn child; the homage of the
kings; and so forth. In this connection, compare A. Malvert:
*Wissenschaft und Religion* (Frankfort, 1904), pp. 49 ff.; also the
suggestion of Professor Idleib of Bonn (*Feuilleton* of *Frankfurter
Zeitung*, November 8, 1908).
