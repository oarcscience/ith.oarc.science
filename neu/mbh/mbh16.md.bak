#### LOHENGRIN

The widely distributed group of sagas that have been woven around the
mythical Knight with the Swan (the old French Chevalier *au cigne*) can
be traced back to very ancient Celtic traditions. The following is the
version which has been made familiar by Wagner's dramatization of this
theme--the story of Lohengrin, the Knight with the Swan, as transmitted
by the medieval German epic (modernized by Junghaus) and briefly
rendered by the Grimm brothers under the title "Lohengrin in
Brabant." <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Duke of Brabant and Limburg died, without leaving other heirs than a
young daughter, Els, or Elsa by name; her he recommended on his deathbed
to one of his retainers, Friedrich von Telramund. Friedrich, the
intrepid warrior, became emboldened to demand the youthful duchess’ hand
and lands, under the false claim that she had promised to marry him. She
steadfastly refused to do so. Friedrich complained to Emperor Henry I
("the Fowler"), and the verdict was that she must defend herself against
him, through some hero, in a so-called divine judgment, in which God
would accord the victory to the innocent, and defeat the guilty. As none
were ready to take her part, the young duchess prayed ardently to God to
save her; and far away in distant Montsalvatsch, in the Council of the
Grail, the sound of the bell was heard, showing that there was someone
in

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

urgent need of help. The Grail therefore resolved to despatch as a
rescuer, Lohengrin, the son of Parsifal. Just as he was about to place
his foot in the stirrup *a swan came floating down the water drawing a
skiff behind him*. As soon as Lohengrin set eyes upon the swan, he
exclaimed: "Take the steed back to the manger; I shall follow this bird
wherever he may lead me." Having faith in God's omnipotence, he took no
food with him in the skiff. After they had been afloat five days, the
swan dipped his bill in the water, caught a fish, ate one half of it,
and gave the other half to the prince to eat. *Thus the knight was fed
by the swan*.

Meanwhile Elsa had summoned her chieftains and retainers to a meeting in
Antwerp. Precisely on the day of the assembly, a swan was sighted
swimming upstream (river Scheldt) and drawing behind him a skiff, in
which Lohengrin lay asleep on his shield. The swan promptly came to land
at the shore, and the prince was joyfully welcomed. Hardly had his
helmet, shield, and sword been taken from the skiff, when the swan at
once swam away again. Lohengrin heard of the wrong which had been done
to the duchess and willingly consented to become her champion. Elsa then
summoned all her relatives and subjects. A place was prepared in Mainz
for Lohengrin and Friedrich to fight in the emperor's presence. The hero
of the Grail defeated Friedrich, who confessed having lied to the
duchess, and was executed with the axe. Elsa was awarded to Lohengrin,
they having long been lovers; but he secretly *insisted upon her
avoiding all questions as to his ancestry, or whence he had come*,
saying that otherwise he would have to leave her instantaneously and she
would never see him again.

For some time, the couple lived in peace and happiness. Lohengrin was a
wise and mighty ruler over his land, and also served his emperor well in
his expeditions against the Huns and the heathen. But it came to pass
that one day in throwing the javelin he unhorsed the Duke of Cleve, so
that the latter broke an arm. The Duchess of Cleve was angry, and spoke

</div>

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

out amongst the women, saying, "Lohengrin may be brave enough, and he
seems to be a good Christian; what a pity that his nobility is not of
much account *for no one knows whence he has come floating to this
land*." These words pierced the heart of the Duchess of Brabant, and she
changed color with emotion. At night, when her spouse was holding her in
his arms, she wept, and he said, "What is the matter, Elsa, my own?" She
made answer, "The Duchess of Cleve has caused me sore pain." Lohengrin
was silent and asked no more. The second night, the same came to pass.
But in the third night, Elsa could no longer retain herself, and she
spoke: "Lord, do not chide me! *I wish to know, for our children's sake,
whence you were born;* for my heart tells me that you are of high rank."
When the day broke, Lohengrin declared in public whence he had come,
that Parsifal was his father, and God had sent him from the Grail. He
then asked for his two children, which the duchess had borne him, kissed
them, told them to take good care of his horn and sword, which he would
leave behind, and said: "Now, I must be gone." To the duchess he left a
little ring which his mother had given him. Then the swan, his friend,
carne swimming swiftly, with the skiff behind him; the prince stepped in
and crossed the water, back to the service of the Grail. Elsa sank down
in a faint. The empress resolved *to keep the younger boy Lohengrin, for
his father's sake, and to bring him up as her own child*. But the widow
wept and mourned the rest of her life for her beloved spouse, who never
came back to her. <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)

On inverting the Lohengrin saga in such a way that the end is placed
first--on the basis of the rearrangement, or even transmutation of
motifs, not uncommonly found in

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

myths--we find the type of saga with which we have now become familiar:
The infant Lohengrin, who is identical with his father of the same name,
*floats in a vessel upon the sea and is carried ashore by a swan. The
empress adopts him as her son, and he becomes a valorous hero*. Having
married a noble maiden of the land, he forbids her to inquire as to his
origin. When the command is broken he is obliged to reveal his
miraculous descent and divine mission, after which the swan carries him
back in his skiff to the Grail.

Other versions of the saga of the Knight with the Swan have retained
this original arrangement of the motifs, although they appear commingled
with elements of fairy tales. The saga of the Knight with the Swan, as
related in the Flemish *People's Book*, <span
id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md) contains in the beginning the history of
the birth of seven children, <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87.md) borne
by Beatrix, the wife of King Oriant of Flanders. Matabruna, the wicked
mother of the absent king, orders that the children be killed and the
queen be given seven puppy dogs in their stead. But the servant contents
himself with the exposure of the children, who are found by a hermit
named Helias, and are nourished by a goat until they are grown. Beatrix
is thrown into a dungeon. Later on, Matabruna learns that the children
have been saved; her repeated command to kill them causes her hunter to
bring her as a sign of apparent obedience the silver neck chains which
the children already wore at the time of their birth. One of the
boys--named Helias, after his foster father--alone keeps his chain, and
is thereby saved from the fate of his brothers, who are transformed into
swans as soon as their chains are removed. Matabruna volunteers to prove
the relations of the queen with the dog, and upon her instigation,
Beatrix

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

is to be killed, unless a champion arises to defend her. In her need,
she prays to God, who sends her son Helias as a rescuer. The brothers
are also saved by means of the other chains, except one, whose chain has
already been melted down. King Oriant now transfers the rulership to his
son Helias, who causes the wicked Matabruna to be burned. One day,
Helias sees his brother, the swan, drawing a skiff on the lake
surrounding the castle. This he regards as a heavenly sign; he arms
himself and mounts the skiff. The swan takes him through rivers and
lakes to the place where God has ordained him to go. Next follows the
liberation of an innocently accused duchess, in analogy with the
Lohengrin saga; and his marriage to her daughter Clarissa, who is
forbidden to ask about her husband's ancestry. In the seventh year of
their marriage she disobeys and puts the question, after which Helias
returns home in the swan's skiff. Finally, his lost brother swan is
likewise released.

The characteristic features of the Lohengrin saga--the disappearance of
the divine hero in the same mysterious fashion in which he has arrived;
the transference of mythical motifs from the life of the older hero to a
younger one bearing the same name (a universal process in myth
formation)--are likewise embodied in the Anglo-Lombard saga of Sceaf,
who reappears in the Prelude to the Anglo-Saxon *Beowulf*, the oldest
Teutonic epic. Here, he is called Scyld the Scefung (meaning "son of
Sceaf") and his origin as a foundling is referred to. The older legend
tells that he received his name because as a very young boy he was cast
ashore, as a stranger, asleep in a boat on a sheaf of grain
(Anglo-Saxon: *sceaf*) . The waves of the sea carried him to the coast
of the country he was destined to defend. The inhabitants welcomed his
arrival as a miracle, raised him, and later on made him their king,
considering him a divine emissary. <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md)
What was told of the father now is

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

transferred in the Beowulf epic to his son, also called Scyld. <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) His body is exposed, as he had ordered
before his death, surrounded by kingly splendor, upon a ship without a
crew, which is sent out into the sea. Thus he vanished in the same
mysterious manner in which his father arrived ashore, this trait being
accounted for, in analogy with the Lohengrin saga, by the mythical
identity of father and son.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[59:1](mbh16.htm#fr_84.md) Junghaus: *Lohengrin*
(Reclam edition); Grimm brothers, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 306.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[61:1](mbh16.htm#fr_85.md) The Grimm brothers (op.
cit., Vol. II., pp. 306 ff.) quote six further versions of the saga of
the Knight with the Swan. Certain fairy tales of the Grimm
brothers--such as "The Six Swans" (No. 49), "The Twelve Brothers" (No.
9), and the "Seven Ravens" (No. 25), with their parallels and
variations, mentioned in the third volume of *Kinder- and
Hausmärchen*--also belong to the same mythological cycle. Further
material from this cycle may be found in H. Leo: Beowulf (Halle, 1839),
and in Görre: *Introduction to Lohengrin* (Heidelberg, 1813).

<span id="fn_86"></span>[62:1](mbh16.htm#fr_86.md) Grimm: *Deutsche Sagen*,
Vol. I., p. 29.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[62:2](mbh16.htm#fr_87.md) The ancient Lombard tale
of the exposure of King Lamissio, related by Paulus Diaconus (L, 15),
gives a similar incident. A public woman had thrown her seven newborn
infants into a fishpond. King Agelmund passed by and looked curiously at
the children, turning them around with his spear. But when one of the
children took hold of the spear, the king considered this as a good
augury; he ordered this boy to be taken out of the pond, and to be given
to a wet nurse. As he had taken him from the pond, which in his language
is called *lama*, he named the boy Lamissio. He grew up into a stalwart
champion, and after Agelmund's death, became king of the Lombards.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[63:1](mbh16.htm#fr_88.md) Compare Grimm: *Deutsche
Sagen*, Vol. I, p. 306; Vol. III, p. 391; and Leo, op. cit., p. 24.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[64:1](mbh16.htm#fr_89.md) *Scaf* is the High
German *Schaffing* ("barrel"), which leads Leo (op cit.) to assume, in
connection with Scyld's being called Scefing, that he had no father
Sceaf or Schaf at all, but was himself the boy cast ashore by the waves,
and was named the "son of the barrel" (*Schaffing*). The name Beowulf
itself, explained by Grimm as *Bienen-Wolf* ("bee-wolf"), seems to mean
originally, according to H. von Wolzogen (translator into German of the
Reclam edition of *Beowulf*), *Bärwelf*, namely *Jungbär* ("bear cub" or
"bear whelp"), which is suggestive of the saga of the origin of the
Guelphs (Grimm: Deutsche Sagen, Vol. II, p. 233), where the boys are to
be thrown into the water as "whelps."
