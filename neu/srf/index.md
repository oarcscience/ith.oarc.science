# Stories of Russian Folk-Life

## By Donald A. Mackenzie

#### \[1916\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a bit of a departure for Mackenzie. Later publishers renamed
this book 'Folk Tales from Russia,' to make it appear to be a Russian
volume in Mackenzie's Mythology series, which is misleading. Instead
this is a short book of fiction about pre-revolutionary Russia. It does
include some pieces of genuine Russian folklore (particularly 'The Lady
of Moscow' and 'How Little Ivan became Tsar'), but most of the stories
are simply sentimental vignettes of Russian life.

In 1916 the Russian revolution was imminent. Soon Lenin and Trotsky
would be on their way to Petrograd, and the storming of the Winter
Palace was just a year away. Possibly Mackenzie (or his publisher)
rushed this book into print for this very reason. However, the lost
world depicted in this book was about to come crashing down.
