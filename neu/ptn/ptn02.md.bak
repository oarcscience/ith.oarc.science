*Popular Tales from the Norse*, by George Webbe Dasent, \[1904\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

# NOTICE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

THESE translations from the *Norske Folkeeventyr*, collected with such
freshness and faithfulness by MM. Asbjörnsen and Moe, have been made at
various times and at long intervals during the last fifteen years; a
fact which is mentioned only to account for any variations in style or
tone—of which, however, the Translator is unconscious—that a critical
eye may detect in this volume. One of them, *The Master Thief*, has
already appeared in Blackwood's Magazine for November 1851, from the
columns of which Periodical it is now reprinted, by the kind permission
of the Proprietors.

The Translator is sorry that he has not been able to comply with the
suggestion of some friends upon whose good-will he sets all store, who
wished him to change and soften some features in these Tales, which they
thought likely to shock English feeling. He has, however, felt it to be
out of his power to meet their wishes, for the merit of an undertaking
of this kind rests

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

entirely on its faithfulness and truth; and the man who, in such a work,
wilfully changes or softens, is as guilty as he "who puts bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter."

Of this guilt, at least, the Translator feels himself free; and,
perhaps, if any, who may be inclined to be offended at first, will take
the trouble to read the Introduction which precedes and explains the
Tales, they may find, not only that the softening process would have
spoilt these popular traditions for all except the most childish
readers, but that the things which shocked them at the first blush are,
after all, not so very shocking.

For the rest, it ill becomes him to speak of the way in which his work
has been done: but if the reader will only bear in mind that this, too,
is an enchanted garden, in which whoever dares to pluck a flower, does
it at the peril of his head; and if he will then read the book in a
merciful and tender spirit, he will prove himself what the Translator
most longs to find, "a gentle reader," and both will part on the best
terms.
