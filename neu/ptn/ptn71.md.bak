### NOTE.

SINCE writing the Introduction to this Appendix, the Translator has been
able to consult "The Vocabulary of the Oji Language, by the Rev. H. N.
Riis, Basle, 1854," and "A Grammar of the Akra or Ga Language, by the
Rev. J. Zimmermann, Stuttgart, 1858," both which excellent works prove
beyond all doubt, not only that these West Indian Ananzi stories are
*spider* stories, but that similar tales called by the same name still
exist in abundance on the west coast of Africa. These two languages, and
others closely akin to them—of which the Yoruba is one—are spoken by the
tribes now settled on the Gold Coast, but which reach inland as far as
the Kong mountains. The Asánte—once so formidable to the ear of the
British public under the term *Ashantee*, and still so odious for their
slave hunts—are the most powerful race among them, and have reduced most
of their kindred to subjection. The following passages from the works of
Messrs. Riis and Zimmermann sufficiently prove the connection between
the West Indian "Spider Stories" and those of West Africa. They also
show that the true spelling of the word should be Anánsi.

<span class="small">"Anánse, subst., *a spider*; Anansisém, subst.,
*story*, *tale*, *fable*; to anansisem, *to tell a tale*, from ananse
and asem literally *a tale of Ananse*, a mythic personage, generally
called Agya Ananse, *father Ananse*, to whom great skill and ingenuity
is attributed; probably a personification of the spider and its
ingenuity as displayed in making its web."—Riis, p. 147.</span>

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

Better still Zimmermann,

<span class="small">"Ananu (Oji ananse) n. *spider*. This animal is the
subject of many superstitions; for instance, that it has a bad influence
upon children sleeping in the same room; it plays, moreover, a
[principal](errata.htm#1) [role](errata.htm#2.md) in their fables, in which
the acting personages are mostly animals; whence these fables are called
in Oji *spider stories*, anansesem. The spider is represented as
speaking through the nose, and its hobbling walk and other peculiarities
are correctly imitated by the voice and gestures of the relater."—Vol.
ii., p. 17.</span>

At vol. i., p. 193, we have two specimens of such stories, the first of
which, about Anansi and his son, reminds one of one of the many stories
of Boots and his Brothers; while in the second, the "Little Birds"
reveal to a hunter the conduct of his wife at home. The root of the word
Anansi, in different African dialects, is *nan*, *ran*, or *lan*, all
which are verbs, meaning *to spin*. Anansi is therefore, *the spinner*.
The connection between it and *aranea*, ἀράχνη, and *lana*, will be
evident to philologists.
