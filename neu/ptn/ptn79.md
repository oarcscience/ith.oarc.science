### THE GIRL AND THE FISH.

THERE was once a girl who used to go to the river to fetch water, but
when she went she was never in a hurry to come back, but stayed so long,
that they made up their minds to watch her. So one day they followed her
to the river, and found when she got there she said something (the
reciter forgets the words), and a fish came up and talked to her; and
she did not like to leave it, for it was her sweetheart. So they went
next day to the river to see if the fish would come up, for they
remembered what the girl said, and used the same words. Then up came the
fish immediately, and they caught it, and took it home, and cooked it
for dinner,—and a part they set by, and gave it to the girl when she
came in. Whilst she was eating, a voice said, "Do you know what you are
eating? I am he you have so often talked with. If you look in the pig's
tub you will see my heart." Then the voice told her to take the heart,
and wrap it up in a handkerchief, and carry it to the river. When she
got to the river she would see three stones in the water; she was to
stand on the middle stone and dip the handkerchief three times into the
water. All this she did, and then she sank suddenly, and was carried
down to a beautiful place, where she found her lover changed from a fish
into his proper form, and there she lived happily with him for ever. And
this is the reason why there are mermaids in the water.
