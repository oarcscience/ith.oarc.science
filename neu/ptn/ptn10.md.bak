### EXTRACTS FROM PRESS NOTICES.

'The late Sir George Dasent's *Popular Tales from the Norse*, told as
they are in easy and charming English, have had many readers, and we are
glad therefore to welcome a new edition. Of the Tales themselves and of
Sir George Dasent's scholarly introduction to them nothing remains to be
said, except perhaps that as they have [immemorial](errata.htm#0.md)
antiquity behind them, so as heirlooms of the whole Aryan race, they
must survive to an indefinite future. The English-speaking world cannot
desire a better translation than this of Sir George Dasent. What is new
on the present occasion is Mr. Dasent's Memoir of his father, which adds
considerably to the interest of the volume. Mr. Dasent has done well to
put on record this account of a life spent, part of it formally, part
informally, but all of it honourably in the service of the
public.'—*Times*.

'The stories seem as we read them as if they could not have existed
otherwise. A feature of the collection is the masterly introduction
giving a survey of the whole of Northern mythology and literature. We
know of no other work of its kind that forms so good an introduction to
the study of the wonderful poetry of the older Edda.'—*Spectator*.

'Dasent's *Popular Tales from the Norse* may claim to rank as a classic.
One of the most capable, earnest, and scholarly disciples of the Grimms,
Sir George contributed greatly to the knowledge of comparative mythology
and folklore, and besides doing much to popularise a branch of knowledge
at that time confined to the specialist, gave us a book of stories which
has been a perpetual delight to manhood and to youth. The new edition is
handsomely got up, and will be an ornament to any shelves. It has never
been forgotten, but is likely to enjoy an aftermath of
prosperity.'—*Notes and Queries*.

EXTRACTS FROM PRESS NOTICES.—*continued*.

'One of the most charming books of folk stories perhaps known to English
readers is Sir George Webbe Dasent's *Popular Tales from the Norse*, of
which David Douglas, Edinburgh, has just produced a new edition. The
interest of this issue is much increased by the valuable addition of a
memoir of the author contributed by his son, Arthur Irwin Dasent. Mr.
Dasent gives a clear and concise account of his father's career, from
the time of his birth at St. Vincent in 1817 to the date of his death at
his home at Bagshotheath in June 1896.'—*Daily Telegraph*.

'Though nearly half a century has passed away since the first appearance
of these celebrated Scandinavian stories in English dress, the fact that
they are still in demand shows their inherent vitality.'—*Dundee
Advertiser*.

'The introductory essay to these translations from the Norse was
pronounced by no less an authority than Max Müller to be one of the
purest specimens of English literature produced in our own or any other
age, and it is therefore interesting to glance at the conditions under
which the book was written.'—*T. P.'s Weekly*.

'The interest of the present volume is enhanced by the inclusion of a
memoir of the distinguished Scandinavian scholar. It is written by his
son, Mr. Arthur Irwin Dasent, and though brief presents an excellent and
sharp picture of the man whose work was in its way a classic sharing
with Andersen's and Grimm's *Fairy Tales* the love of children of a past
generation, and standing to them much in the same relation that *Alice
in Wonderland* stands to their successors.'—*The Outlook*.
