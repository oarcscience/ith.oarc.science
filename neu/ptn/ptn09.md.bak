### CONCLUSION.

We have now only to consider the men and women of these Tales, and then
our task is done. It will be sooner

<span id="page_clxii">p. clxii</span>

done, because they may be left to speak for themselves, and must stand
or fall by their own words and actions. The tales of all races have a
character and manner of their own. Among the Hindoos the straight stem
of the story is overhung with a network of imagery which reminds one of
the parasitic growth of a tropical forest. Among the Arabs the tale is
more elegant, pointed with a moral, and adorned with tropes and
episodes. Among the Italians it is bright, light, dazzling and swift.
Among the French we have passed from the woods, and fields, and bills,
to my lady's *boudoir*,—rose-pink is the prevailing colour, and the air
is loaded with patchouli and *mille fleurs*. We miss the song of birds,
the modest odour of wild-flowers, and the balmy fragrance of the pine
forest. The Swedes are more stiff, and their style is more like that of
a chronicle than a tale. The Germans are simple, hearty, and rather
comic than humorous; and M. Moe <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) has
well said, that as we read them it is as if we sat and listened to some
elderly woman of the middle class, who recites them with a clear, full,
deep voice. In Scotland the few that have been collected by Mr. Robert
Chambers <span id="fr_79"></span>[2](#fn_79.md) are as good in tone and
keeping as anything of the kind in the whole range of such popular
collections. <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_80.md) The wonderful

<span id="page_clxiii">p. clxiii</span>

likeness which is shewn between such tales as "The Black Bull of
Norroway" in Mr. Chambers's collection, and Katie Woodencloak in these
Norse Tales, is to be accounted

<span id="page_clxiv">p. clxiv</span>

for by no theory of the importation of this or that particular tale in
later times from Norway, but by the fact that the Lowland Scots, among
whom these tales were

<span id="page_clxv">p. clxv</span>

told, were lineal descendants of Norsemen, who had either seized the
country in the Viking times, or had been driven into it across the
Border after the Norman Conquest.

<span id="page_clxvi">p. clxvi</span>

These Norse Tales we may characterise as bold, outspoken, and humorous,
in the true sense of humour. In the midst of every difficulty and danger
arises that old

<span id="page_clxvii">p. clxvii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Norse feeling of
making the best of everything, and keeping a good face to the foe. The
language and tone are perhaps rather lower than in some other
collections,

<span id="page_clxviii">p. clxviii</span>

but it must be remembered that these are the tales of "hempen
homespuns," of Norse yeomen, of Norske Bönder, who call a spade a spade,
and who burn tallow, not wax; and yet in no collection of tales is the
general tone so chaste, are the great principles of morality better
worked out, and right and wrong kept so steadily in sight. The general
view of human nature is good and kindly. The happiness of married life
was never more prettily told than in "Gudbrand on the Hillside," [p.
149](ptn30.htm#page_149.md), where the tenderness of the wife for her
husband weighs down all other considerations; and we all agree with M.
Moe that it would be well if there were many wives like Gudbrand's. The
balance, too, is very evenly kept between the sexes;

<span id="page_clxix">p. clxix</span>

for if any wife should point with indignation at such a tale as "Not a
Pin to choose between them," [p. 173](ptn34.htm#page_173.md), where wives
suffer; she will be amply avenged when she reads "The Husband who was to
mind the House," [p. 269](ptn48.htm#page_269.md), where the husband has
decidedly the worst of the bargain, and is punished as he deserves.

Of particular characters, one occurs repeatedly. This is that which we
have ventured, for want of a better word, to call "Boots," from that
widely-spread tradition in English families, that the youngest brother
is bound to do all the hard work his brothers set him, and which has
also dignified him with the term here used. In Norse he is called
"*Askefis*," or "*Espen Askefjis*." By M. Moe he

<span id="page_clxx">p. clxx</span>

is called "*Askepot*," <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) a Danish word
which the readers of Grimm's Tales will see at once is own brother to
*Aschenpüttel*. The meaning of the word is "one who pokes about the
ashes and blows up the fire"; one who does dirty work, in short; and in
Norway, according to M. Moe, the term is almost universally applied to
the youngest son of the family. He is Cinderella's brother, in fact; and
just as she had all the dirty work put upon her by her sisters, he meets
with the same fate from his brothers. He is generally the youngest of
three, whose names are often Peter and Paul, as in No. XLII. ([p.
295](ptn51.htm#page_295).md), and who despise, cry down, and mock him. But
he has in him that deep strength of character and natural power upon
which the good powers always smile. He is the man whom Heaven helps,
because he can help himself; and so, after his brothers try and fail, he
alone can watch in the barn, and tame the steed, and ride up the glass
hill, and gain the Princess and half the kingdom. The Norse "Boots"
shares these qualities in common with the "Pinkel" of the Swedes, and
the *Dummling* of the

<span id="page_clxxi">p. clxxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Germans, as well
as with our "Jack the Giant Killer," but he starts lower than these—he
starts from the dust-bin and the coal-hole. There he sits idle whilst
all work; there he lies with that deep irony of conscious power, which
knows its time must one day come, and meantime can afford to wait. When
that time comes, he girds himself to the feat, amidst the scoffs and
scorn of his flesh and blood; but even then, after he has done some
great deed, he conceals it, returns to his ashes, and again sits idly by
the kitchen-fire, dirty, lazy, and despised, until the time for final
recognition comes, and then his dirt and rags fall off,—he stands out in
all the majesty of his royal robes, and is acknowledged once for all a
king. In this way does the consciousness of a nation, and the mirror of
its thought, reflect the image and personification of a great moral
truth, that modesty, endurance, and ability will sooner or later reap
their reward, however much they may be degraded, scoffed at, and
despised by the proud, the worthless, and the overbearing. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

As a general rule, the women are less strongly marked than the men; for
these Tales, as is well said, are uttered "with a manly mouth;" <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_83.md) and none of the female characters, except
perhaps "The Mastermaid," and "Tatterhood," can compare in strength with
"The Master-Smith," "The Master-Thief," "Shortshanks," or "Boots." Still
the true womanly type comes out in full play in such tales as "The Two
Step-sisters." [p. 113](ptn26.htm#page_113.md); East o' the Sun and West

<span id="page_clxxii">p. clxxii</span>

o' the Moon," [p. 22](ptn13.htm#page_22.md); "Bushy Bride," [p.
322](ptn54.htm#page_322.md), and "The Twelve Wild Ducks," [p.
51](ptn18.htm#page_51.md). In all these the lassie is bright, and good, and
helpful; she forgets herself in her eagerness to help others. When she
goes down the well after the unequal match against her step-sister in
spinning bristles against flax; she steps tenderly over the hedge, milks
the cow, shears the sheep, relieves the boughs of the apple-tree,—all
out of the natural goodness of her heart. When she is sent to fetch
water from the well, she washes and brushes, and even kisses, the
loathsome head; she believes what her enemies say, even to her own wrong
and injury; she sacrifices all that she holds most dear, and at last
even herself, because she is made to believe that it is her brother's
wish. And so on her, too, the good powers smile. She can understand and
profit by what the little birds say; she knows how to choose the right
casket. And at last, after many trials, all at once the scene changes,
and she receives a glorious reward, while the wicked stepmother and her
ugly daughter meet with a just fate. Nor is another female character
less tenderly drawn in "Hacon Grizzlebeard," [p. 39](ptn16.htm#page_39.md),
where we see the proud, haughty princess subdued and tamed by natural
affection into a faithful, loving wife. We sympathise with her more than
with the "Patient Grizzel" of the poets, who is in reality too good, for
her story has no relief; while in Hacon Grizzlebeard we begin by being
angry at the princess's pride; we are glad at the retribution which
overtakes her, but we are gradually melted at her sufferings and
hardships when she gives up all for the Beggar and follows him; we burst
into tears with her when she exclaims, "Oh the Beggar, and the babe, and
the cabin!" and we rejoice

<span id="page_clxxiii">p. clxxiii</span>

with her when the Prince says, "Here is the Beggar, and there is the
babe, and so let the cabin burn away."

Nor is it unprofitable here to remark how the professions fare when they
appear in these tales. The Church cannot be said to be treated with
respect, for "Father Lawrence" is ludicrously deceived and scurvily
treated by the Master Thief, [p. 232](ptn44.htm#page_232.md); nor does the
priest come off any better in "Goosey Grizzel," [p.
221](ptn42.htm#page_221.md), where he is thrown by the Farmer into the wet
moss. Indeed it seems as if the popular mind were determined to revenge
itself when left to itself, for the superstition of Rome on the one
hand, and the severity of strict Lutheranism on the other. It has little
to say of either of them, but when it does speak, its accents are not
those of reverence and love. The Law, too, as represented by those awful
personages, the Constable, the Attorney, and the Sheriff in "The
Mastermaid," [p. 71](ptn21.htm#page_71.md), is held up to ridicule, and
treated with anything but tenderness. But there is one profession for
which a good word is said, a single word, but enough to shew the feeling
of the people. In "The Twelve Wild Ducks," [p. 51](ptn18.htm#page_51.md),
the king is "as soft and kind" to Snow-white and Rosey-red "as a
doctor,"—a doctor, alas! not of laws, but of medicine; and thus this
profession, so often despised, but in reality the noblest, has homage
paid to it in that single sentence, which neither the Church with all
its dignity, nor the Law with all its cunning, have been able to extort
from the popular mind. Yet even this profession has a hard word uttered
against it in "Katie Woodencloak," [p. 357](ptn60.htm#page_357.md), where
the doctor takes a great fee from the wicked queen to say she will never
be well unless she has some of the Dun Bull's flesh to eat.

<span id="page_clxxiv">p. clxxiv</span>

And now it is time to bring this Introduction to an end, lest it should
play the Wolf's part to Odin, and swallow up the Tales themselves.
Enough has been said, at least, to prove that even nursery tales may
have a science of their own, and to shew how the old Nornir and divine
spinners can revenge themselves if their old wives' tales are insulted
and attacked. The inquiry itself might be almost indefinitely prolonged,
for this is a journey where each turn of the road brings out a new point
of view, and the longer we linger on our path, the longer we find
something fresh to see. Popular mythology is a virgin mine, and its ore,
so far from being exhausted or worked out, has here, in England at
least, been scarcely touched. It may, indeed, be dreaded lest the time
for collecting such English traditions is not past and gone; whether the
steam-engine and printing-press have not played their great work of
enlightenment too well; and whether the popular tales, of which, no
doubt, the land was once full, have not faded away before those great
inventions, as the race. of Giants waned before the might of Odin and
the Æsir. Still the example of this very Norway, which at one time was
thought, even by her own sons, to have few tales of her own, and now has
been found to have them so fresh and full, may serve as a warning not to
abandon a search, which, indeed, can scarcely be said to have been ever
begun; and to suggest a doubt whether the ill success which may have
attended this or that particular attempt, may not have been from the
fault rather of the seekers after traditions, than from the want of the
traditions themselves. In point of fact, it is a matter of the utmost
difficulty to gather such tales

<span id="page_clxxv">p. clxxv</span>

in any country, as those who have collected them most successfully will
be the first to confess. It is hard to make old and feeble women, who
generally are the depositaries of these national treasures, believe that
the inquirer can have any real interest in the matter. They fear that
the question is only put to turn them into ridicule; for the popular
mind is a sensitive plant; it becomes coy, and closes its leaves at the
first rude touch; and when once shut, it is hard to make these aged lips
reveal the secrets of the memory. There they remain, however, forming
part of an under-current of tradition, of which the educated classes,
through whose mind flows the bright upper-current of faith, are apt to
forget the very existence: things out of sight, and therefore out of
mind. Now and then a wave of chance tosses them to the surface from
those hidden depths, and all Her Majesty's inspectors of schools are
shocked at the wild shapes which still haunt the minds of the great mass
of the community. It cannot be said that the English are not a
superstitious people. Here we have gone on for more than a hundred years
proclaiming our opinion that the belief in witches, and wizards, and
ghosts, and fetches, was extinct throughout the land. Ministers of all
denominations have preached them down, and philosophers convinced all
the world of the absurdity of such vain superstitions; and yet it has
been reserved for another learned profession, the Law, to produce in one
trial at the Staffordshire assizes, a year or two ago, such a host of
witnesses, who firmly believed in witchcraft, and swore to their belief
in spectre dogs and wizards, as to shew that, in the Midland counties at
least, such traditions are anything but extinct. If so much of

<span id="page_clxxvi">p. clxxvi</span>

the bad has been spared by steam, by natural philosophy, and by the
Church, let us hope that some of the good may still linger along with
it, and that an English Grimm may yet arise who may carry out what Mr.
Chambers has so well begun in Scotland, and discover in the mouth of an
Anglo-Saxon Gammer Grethel, some, at least, of those popular tales which
England once had in common with all the Aryan race.

For these Norse Tales one may say that nothing can equal the tenderness
and skill with which MM. Asbjörnsen and Moe have collected them. Some of
that tenderness and beauty may, it is hoped, be found in this English
translation; but to those who have never been in the country where they
are current, and who are not familiar with that hearty simple people, no
words can tell the freshness and truth of the originals. It is not that
the idioms of the two languages are different, for they are more nearly
allied, both in vocabulary and construction, than any other two tongues,
but it is the face of nature herself, and the character of the race that
looks up to her, that fail to the mind's eye. The West Coast of Scotland
is something like that nature in a general way, except that it is
infinitely smaller and less grand; but that constant, bright blue sky,
those deeply-indented, sinuous, gleaming friths, those headstrong rivers
and headlong falls, those steep hill-sides, those long ridges of fells,
those peaks and needles rising sharp above them, those hanging glaciers
and wreaths of everlasting snow, those towering endless pine forests,
relieved by slender stems of silver birch, those green spots in the
midst of the forest, those winding dales and upland lakes, those various
shapes of

<span id="page_clxxvii">p. clxxvii</span>

birds and beasts, the mighty crashing elk, the fleet reindeer, the
fearless bear, the nimble lynx, the shy wolf, those eagles, and swans,
and seabirds, those many tones and notes of Nature's voice making
distant music through the twilight summer night, those brilliant,
flashing northern lights when days grow short, those dazzling, blinding
storms of autumn snow, that cheerful winter frost and cold, that joy of
sledging over the smooth ice, when the sharp-shod horse careers at full
speed with the light sledge, or rushes down the steep pitches over the
crackling snow through the green spruce wood—all these form a Nature of
their own. These particular features belong in their fatness and
combination to no other land. When in the midst of all this natural
scenery we find an honest, manly race, not the race of the towns and
cities, but of the dales and fells, free and unsubdued, holding its own
in a country where there are neither lords nor ladies, but simple men
and women, brave men and fair women, who cling to the traditions of
their forefathers, and whose memory reflects as from. the faithful
mirror of their native steel the whole history and progress of their
race—when all these natural features, and such a manly race meet; then
we have the stuff out of which these tales are made, the living rock out
of which these sharp-cut national forms are hewn. Then, too, our task of
introducing them is over, we may lay aside our pen, and leave the reader
and the tales to themselves.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_78"></span>[clxii:1](ptn09.htm#fr_78.md) M. Moe, *Introd.

largely indebted.

Scotland*, ed. 1847.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[clxii:3](ptn09.htm#fr_80.md) The following list,
which only selects the more prominent collections, will suffice to shew
that Popular Tales have a literature of their own:—Sanscrit: The
*Pantcha-Tantra*, "The Five Books," a collection of fables of which only
extracts have as yet been published, but of which Professor <span
id="page_clxiii">p. clxiii</span> Wilson has given an analysis in the
Transactions of the Asiatic Society, vol. i. sect. 2. The *Hitopadesa*,
or "Wholesome Instruction," a selection of tales and fables from the
*Pantcha-Tantra*, first edited by Carey at Serampore in 1804; again by
Hamilton in London in 1810; again in Germany by A. W. von Schlegel in
1829, an edition which was followed in 1831 by a critical commentary by
Lassen; and again in 1830 at Calcutta with a Bengali and English
translation. The work had been translated into English by Wilkins so
early as 1787, when it was published in London, and again by Sir William
Jones, whose rendering, which is not so good as that by Wilkins,
appeared after his death in the collected edition of his works. Into
German it has been translated in a masterly way by Max Müller, Leipzig,
Brockhaus, 1844. Versions of these Sanscrit collections, the date of the
latter of which is ascribed to the end of the second century of the
Christian era, varying in many respects, but all possessing sufficient
resemblance to identify them with their Sanscrit originals, are found in
almost every Indian dialect, and in Zend, Arabic, Persian, Hebrew,
Greek, and Turkish. We are happy to be able to state here that the
eminent Sanscrit scholar, Professor Benfey of Göttingen, is now
publishing a German translation of the *Pantcha-Tantra*, which will be
accompanied by translations of numerous compositions of the same kind,
drawn from unpublished Sanscrit works, and from the legends current
amongst the Mongolian tribes. The work will be preceded by an
introduction embracing the whole question of the origin and diffusion of
fables and popular tales. The following will be the title of Prof.
Benfey's work: <span id="page_clxiv">p. clxiv</span>—"*Pantcha Tantra*.
Erster Theil: Fünf Bücher Indischer Fabeln, Märchen, und Erzälungen. Aus
dem Sanskrit übersetzt, mit Anmerkungen und Einleitung über das Indische
Grundwerk und dessen Ausflüsse, so wie über die Quellen und Verbreitung
des Inhalts derselben. Zweiter Theil, Übersetzungen und Anmerkungen."
Most interesting of all for our purpose is the collection of Sanscrit
Tales, collected in the twelfth century of our era, by *Somadeva Bhatta*
of Cashmere. This has been published in Sanscrit, and translated into
German by Hermann Brockhaus, and the nature of its contents has already
been sufficiently indicated. We may add, however, that Somadeva's
collection exhibits the Hindoo mind in the twelfth century in a
condition, as regards popular tales, which that of Europe has not yet
reached. How old these stories and fables must have been in the East, we
see both from the *Pantcha-Tantra* and the *Hitopadesa*, which are
strictly didactic works, and only employ tales and fables to illustrate
and inculcate a moral lesson. We in the West have got beyond fables and
apologues, but we are only now collecting our popular tales. In
Somadeva's time the simple tale no longer sufficed; it had to be fitted
into and arranged with others, with an art and dexterity which is really
marvellous; and so cleverly is this done, that it requires a mind of no
little cultivation, and a head of more than ordinary clearness, to carry
without confusion all the wheels within wheels, and fables within
fables, which spring out of the original story as it proceeds. In other
respects the popular tale loses in simplicity what it gains in intricacy
by this artificial arrangement; and it is evident that in the twelfth
century the Hindoo tales <span id="page_clxv">p. clxv</span> had been
long since collected out of the mouths of the people, and reduced to
writing;—in a word, that the popular element had disappeared, and that
they had passed into the written literature of the race. We may take
this opportunity, too, to mention that a most curious collection of
tales and fables, translated from Sanscrit, has recently boon discovered
in Chinese. They are on the eve of publication by M. Stanislas Julien,
the first of Chinese scholars; and from the information on the matter
which Professor Max Müller has kindly furnished to the translator, it
appears that they passed with Buddhism from India into China. The work
from which M. Julien has taken these fables—which are all the more
precious because the Sanscrit originals have in all probability
perished,—is called Yu-lin, or "The Forest of Comparisons." It was the
work of Youen-thai, a great Chinese scholar, who was President of the
Ministry of Justice at Pekin in the year 1565 of our era. He collected
in twenty-four volumes, after the labour of twenty years, during which
he read upwards of four hundred works, all the fables and comparisons he
could find in ancient books. Of those works, two hundred were
translations from the Sanscrit made by Buddhist monks, and it is from
eleven of these that M. Julien has translated his Chinese Fables. We
need hardly say that this work is most anxiously expected by all who
take an interest in such matters. Let it be allowed to add here, that it
was through no want of respect towards the memory of M. de Sacy that the
translator has given so much prominence to the views and labours of the
Brothers Grimm in this Introduction. To M. de Sacy belongs all the merit
of exploring what may be called the old written <span id="page_clxvi">p.
clxvi</span> world of fable. He, and Warton, and Dunlop, and Price, too,
did the dayswork of giants, in tracing out and classifying those tales
and fables which had passed into the literature of the Aryan race. But,
besides this old region, there is another new hemisphere of fiction
which lies in the mouths and in the minds of the people. This new world
of fable the Grimms discovered, and to them belongs the glory of having
brought all its fruits and flowers to the light of day. This is why
their names must ever be foremost in a work on Popular Tales, shining,
as their names must ever shine, a bright double star over that new
hemisphere. In more modern times, the earliest collection of popular
tales is to be found in the *Piacevoli Notte* of John Francis Straparola
of Caravaggio, near Milan, the first edition of which appeared at Venice
in 1550. The book, which is shamefully indecent, even for that age, and
which at last, in 1606, was placed in the *Index Expurgatorius*,
contains stories from all sources, and amongst them nineteen genuine
popular tales, which are not disfigured by the filth with which the rest
of the volume is full. Straparola's work has been twice translated into
German,—once at Vienna, 1791, and again by Schmidt in a more complete
form, *Märchen-Saal*, Berlin, 1817. But a much more interesting Italian
collection appeared at Naples in the next century. This was the
*Pentamerone* of Giambattista Basile, who wrote in the Neapolitan
dialect, and whose book appeared in 1637. This collection contains
forty-eight tales, and is in tone, and keeping and diction, one of the
best that has ever appeared in any language. It has been repeatedly
reprinted at Naples. It has been translated into German, and a portion
of it, a year or two back, by <span id="page_clxvii">p. clxvii</span>
Mr. Taylor, into English. In France the first collection of this kind
was made by Charles Perrault, who, in 1697, published eight tales, under
a title taken from an old *Fabliau*, *Contes de ma Mère l'Oye*, whence
comes our "Mother Goose." To these eight, three more tales were added in
later editions. Perrault was shortly followed by Madame d'Aulnoy (born
in 1650, died 1705), whose manner of treating her tales is far less true
to nature than Perrault's, and who inserts at will verses, alterations,
additions, and moral reflections. Her style is sentimental and
over-refined; the courtly airs of the age of Louis XIV. predominate, and
nature suffers by the change from the cottage to the palace. Madame
d'Aulnoy was followed by a host of imitators: the Countess Murat, who
died in 1716; Countess d'Auneuil, who died in 1700; M. de Preschac, born
1676, who composed tales of utter worthlessness, which may be read as
examples of what popular tales are not, in the collection called *Le
Cabinet des Fées*, which was published in Paris in 1785. Not much better
are the attempts of Count Hamilton, who died in 1720; of M. de Moncrif,
who died in 1770; of Mademoiselle de la Force, died 1724; of
Mademoiselle l'Héritier, died 1737; of Count Caylus, who wrote his
*Féeries Nouvelles* in the first half of the eighteenth century, for the
popular element fails almost entirely in their works. Such as they are,
they may also be read in the *Cabinet des Fées*, a collection which ran
to no fewer than forty-one volumes, and with which no lover of popular
tradition need trouble himself much. To the playwright and the
story-teller it has been a great repository, which has supplied the lack
of original invention. In Germany we need trouble ourselves with none
<span id="page_clxviii">p. clxviii</span> of the collections before the
time of the Grimms, except to say that they are nearly worthless. In
1812-14 the two brothers, Jacob and William, brought out the first
edition of their *Kinder- und Haus-Märchen*, which was followed by a
second and more complete one in 1822, 3 vols., Berlin, Reimer. The two
first volumes have been repeatedly republished, but few readers in
England are aware of the existence of the third, a third edition of
which appeared in 1856 at Göttingen, which contains the literature of
these traditions, and is a monument of the care and pains with which the
brothers—or rather William, for it is his work—even so far back as 1820,
had traced out parallel traditions in other tribes and lands. This work
formed an era in popular literature, and has been adopted as a model by
all true collectors ever since. It proceeded on the principle of
faithfully collecting these traditions from the mouths of the people,
without adding one jot or tittle, or in any way interfering with them,
except to select this or that variation as most apt or beautiful. To the
adoption of this principle we owe the excellent <span id="page_clxix">p.
clxix</span> Swedish collection of George Stephens and Hylten Cavallins,
*Svenska Folk-Sagor og Æfventyr*, 2 vols., Stockholm 1844, and following
years; and also this beautiful Norse one, to which Jacob Grimm awards
the palm over all collections, except perhaps the Scottish, of MM.
Asbjörnsen and Moe. To it also we owe many most excellent collections in
Germany, over nearly the whole of which an active band of the Grimms'
pupils have gone gathering up as gleaners the ears which their great
masters had let fall or let lie. In Denmark the collection of M.
Winther, *Danske Folkeeventyr*, Copenhagen 1823, is a praiseworthy
attempt in the same direction; nor does it at all detract from the merit
of H. C. Andersen as an original writer, to observe how often his
creative mind has fastened on one of these national stories, and worked
out of that piece of native rock a finished work of art. Though last,
not least, are to be reckoned the Scottish stories collected by Mr.
Robert Chambers, of the merit of which we have already expressed our
opinion in the text.

it seems, a Scottish word which answers to *Askepot* to a hair. See
Jamieson's Dictionary where the reader will find *Ashiepattle* as used
in Shetland for "a neglected child"; and not in Shetland alone, but in
Ayrshire, *Ashypet*, an adjective, or rather a substantive degraded to
do the dirty work of an adjective, "one employed in the lowest kitchen
work." See too the quotation, "when I reached Mrs. Damask's house she
was gone to bed, and nobody to let me in, dripping wet as I was, but an
*ashypet* lassie, that helps her for a servant."—*Steamboat*, page 259.
So again *Assiepet*, substantive, "a dirty little creature, one that is
constantly soiled with *ass* or ashes."

<span id="fn_82"></span>[clxxi:1](ptn09.htm#fr_82.md) The Sagas contain
many instances of Norsemen who sat thus idly over the fire, and were
thence called *Kolbitr*, *coalbiters*, but who afterwards became mighty
men.
