### ANANZI AND BABOON.

ANANZI and Baboon were disputing one day which was fattest. Ananzi said
he was sure he was fat, but Baboon declared he was fatter. Then Ananzi
proposed that they should prove it; so they made a fire, and agreed that
they should hang up before it, and see which would drop most fat.

Then Baboon hung up Ananzi first, but no fat dropped.

Then Ananzi hung up Baboon, and very soon the fat began to drop, which
smelt so good that Ananzi cut a slice out of Baboon, and said,

"Oh! brother Baboon, you're fat for true."

But Baboon didn't speak.

So Ananzi said, "Well, speak or not speak, I'll eat you every bit
to-day," which he really did. But when he had eaten up all Baboon, the
bits joined themselves together in his stomach, and began to pull him
about so much that he had no rest, and was obliged to go to a doctor.

The doctor told him not to eat anything for some days, then he was to
get a ripe banana, and hold it to his mouth; when the Baboon, who would
be hungry, smelt the banana, he would be sure to run up to eat it, and
so he would run out of his mouth.

So Ananzi starved himself, and got the banana, and did as the doctor
told him; but when he put the banana to his mouth, he was so hungry
couldn't help eating it. So he didn't get rid of the Baboon, which went
on pulling him about till he was obliged to go back to the doctor, who
told him he would soon cure him; and he took the banana, and held it to
Ananzi's mouth, and very soon the Baboon jumped up to catch it, and ran
out of his mouth; and Ananzi was very glad to get rid of him. And
Baboons to this very day like bananas.
