This is George Dasent's classic collection of Scandinavian folklore.
This is not about Norse mythology *per se*; so if you are looking for
tales of Odin, Loki, and Freya etc., you will have to look elsewhere.
Rather, this is an anthology of folk tales, similar to the Grimm
Brothers, or Campbell's *Popular Tales of the West Highlands*. All of
the usual suspects are in place, including giants, trolls, witches, evil
step-siblings, magical boons and tasks, and anthropomorphic animals.

The introduction is exceptionally well written, and places various
magical and other themes from the tales into the context of ancient
Norse Pagan beliefs. It *is* a victorian scholarly treatise however
(with the requisite multipage foonotes and rhetorical flourishes), and
will mostly be appreciated by academic readers. Once you get past the
introduction however, the prose descends to the young adult level, and
the delightful stories can be appreciated by readers of all ages. There
is also an appendix which has a few 'Anansi' stories from the West
Indies.
