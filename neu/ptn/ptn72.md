### WHY THE JACK-SPANIARD'S WAIST IS SMALL

ANANZI and Mosquito were talking together one day, and boasting of their
fathers' crops. Ananzi said his father had never had such a crop in his
life before; and Mosquito said, he was sure his father's was bigger, for
one yam they dug was as big as his leg. This tickled Jack-Spaniard so
much, that he laughed till he broke his waist in two. That's why the
Jack-Spaniard's waist is so small.
