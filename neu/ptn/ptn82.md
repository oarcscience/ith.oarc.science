### THE MAN AND THE DOUKANA TREE.

THERE was once a man and his wife, who were very poor, and they had a
great many children. The man was very lazy, and would do nothing to help
his family. The poor mother did all she could. In the wood close by grew
a Doukana Tree, which was full of fruit. Every day the man went and ate
some of the fruit, but never took any home, so he ate and he ate, until
there were only two Doukanas left on the Tree. One he ate, and left the
other. Next day, when he went for that one, he was obliged to climb up
the tree to reach it; but when he got up, the Doukana fell down; when he
got down the Doukana jumped up; and so it went on until he was quite
tired.

Then he asked all the animals that passed by to help him, but they all
made some excuse. They all had something to do. The horse had his work
to do, or he would have no grass to eat. The donkey brayed. Last came a
dog, and the man begged him hard to help him; so the dog said he would.
Then the man climbed up the tree, and the Doukana jumped to the ground
again, when the dog picked it up and ran off with it. The man was very
vexed, and ran after the dog, but it ran all the, faster, so that the
man could not overtake him. The dog, seeing the man after him, ran to
the sea-shore, and scratching a hole in the ground, buried himself all
but his nose, which he left sticking out.

Soon after the man came up, and seeing the nose, cried out that he had
"never seen ground have nose;" and catching hold of it he tugged till he
pulled out the dog, when he squeezed him with all his might to make him
give up the Doukana. And that's why dogs are so small in their bodies to
this very day.
