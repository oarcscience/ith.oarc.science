## THE VISION OF SIR LAMORACKE

### by

## OSCAR FAY ADAMS

*ARGUMENT.  
  
As I was going to Saint Ives  
      I met seven wives.  
Every wife had seven sacks;  
Every sack had seven cats;  
Every cat had seven kits;  
Kits, cats, sacks and wives,  
      How many were going to Saint Ives?*  
  
  
King Pellinore of Wales, the same who slew  
Lot, King of Orkney in the Northern seas,  
Three stalwart sons in wedlock lawful had.  
Sir Lamoracke de Galis eldest was  
Of these, the next Sir Aglavale, the third  
The pure Sir Percivale, and these were knights  
Of Table Round, and with them Tor, the child  
Of shame but brother to the three no less,  
And first created knight of Table Round  
The Table of the great Pendragonship.  
Sir Lamoracke among King Arthur's knights  
Was bravest save for three, but since the three  
Were Lancelot, Tristram and Geraint, no less  
Of honor deem'd it reck'ning fourth with these.  
In the mid-strength and hardihood of youth  
He was when vision by his sister seen,  
A holy nun much worn by fastings long,  
Sent half the court in quest of Holy Grail;  
And Lamoracke went, as eager as the rest,  
And all for the holy longing underwent  
Long toilsome days, and nights as wearisome,  
And piteous perils manifold he knew,  
Until, a twelvemonth past, he set his face  
Again toward Camelot with yet no glimpse  
Of what he sought, and sorrow in his heart.  
  
One morning chanced it that while pacing slow  
With head bent down and gaze upon the ground  
On homeward way thro' forest deep that stretched  
From Camelot southward many leagues, there crost  
His path a ten-tin'd stag, and after rode  
A knight he knew to be Sir Sagramour,  
In fierce pursuit, who, seeing in the wood  
A horseless knight all travel-worn and sad,  
Left flying deer to its wild will and leapt  
From his own horse and begg'd Sir Lamoracke  
Ride in his place as being one of those  
Who went in search of Holy Grail. Thus said  
The sweet Sir Sagramour and added thence:  
"Thy face, Sir Lamoracke, is not unknown  
To me."  
           Then slowly Lamoracke answer'd him:  
"O all for naught my quest and not for one  
Like me the vision glorious, but thou,  
Methinks, for knightly courtesy the peer  
Of any at the court, might well have seen  
What I, the son of Pellinore, have not."  
  
"Not I," then spoke the sweet Sir Sagramour,  
"Being ensnar'd with earthly things unto  
My hurt, but an' I pray you, Lamoracke, ride.  
My castle scarce a half league distant stands,  
There mayst thou rest, at least until the morn,  
And ride to court equipt as knight should be  
So far as my poor store shall serve thy turn."  
  
Then Lamoracke lookt up and answer'd him,  
"Ah, sweet Sir Sagramour, none other suit  
Suits with my sadden'd fortunes like to this  
Which now I wear and therefore in array  
Like this must I before King Arthur pass  
Once more."  
                Then answer made Sir Sagramour:  
"Thou knowest best, but still I pray you ride  
Homeward with me and eat and rest a night;  
Else thou wilt never live to see thy lord  
At all, in this or any other garb."  
Full gentle was the manner of the man,  
And Lamoracke for utter weariness  
Gave way and past with sweet Sir Sagramour  
Unto the other's castle near at hand,  
Yet thinking, "on the morrow I will go."  
As one who following the chase for days  
Scarce heeds his wearied limbs because so full  
Of eager haste but home returning finds  
Each step a pain and life a mockery,  
So now with Lamoracke, who, with the fire  
Of zeal and holy purpose quite burnt out,  
Tarried for days with sweet Sir Sagramour,  
Too weak for further travel and heart-sick  
Withal because of failure in the Quest.  
To him in those dark days came Sagramour  
And whisper'd, "Courage; failure is not a crime."  
And after came the wife of Sagramour  
Beseeching him to be of cheer, to whom  
He heark'n'd listlessly. Then came a child  
The son of these, a three-years winsome lad  
Who stammer'd "Courage" as he had been taught,  
And seeing that Sir Lamoracke took no heed  
Stammer'd his lesson o'er again, whereat  
The knight, half rising on his elbow, turn'd  
And saw the boy with parted lips, and cheeks  
All satin soft, and hair and eyes the hue  
Of sable pansies, staring full at him;  
Then Lamoracke rose and caught the lad in arms  
And kiss'd him oft and spoke full tenderly:  
"Thou bidd'st me be of courage, little one?  
Yea, for thy sake I will," and from that time  
Shook off, as far as might be, sad regret.  
  
Yet still strength linger'd on its way to him,  
And with these a sennight longer bode,  
And after rose refresh'd and went his way.  
But ere that time he told to please his host  
Full many a tale of what had hapt to him  
In Quest of Holy Grail and once the tale  
Ran like to this.  
                    "One morning after dreams,"  
So said Sir Lamoracke, "of Holy Grail  
Seen by me who unworthy am to see  
With waking eyes, I past, for then was I  
In Cornwall by the sea, along a road  
That wound past splinter'd crag and shallow cove  
To fishing village of Saint Ives. Seaward  
Saint Michael's Mount rose like a vision fair  
All roseate with dawn and softly broke  
Against its base the Cornish sea. A light  
Breeze blew that gently stirr'd the leaves and then  
Rested content while overhead a flock  
Of birds shrill'd one to other, flying south  
The sound clear falling thro' the morning air.  
The weather-beaten fishers mended nets  
Sitting on boats updrawn beside the sea  
And hail'd me with 'good-morrow' as I past,  
In simple fisher wise. Suddenly round  
An angle in the path before me came  
Full seven fisher-wives bending beneath  
A heavy burden each one bore in sack  
Of dusty leather on her shoulders old.  
Small trace had these of brow may-blossom, cheek  
Of apple blossom or the eye of hawk,  
And clumsily the wrinkl'd nose of each,  
Tip-tilted, like a thirsty duckling's bill  
After much guzzling in the pool, did seem  
To point the way. A wailing clamor rose  
In air and louder grew as nearer came  
The seven, halting where I stood aside  
To let them pass, and lowering their sacks  
Upon the ground.  
                                   In much amaze I ask'd  
The seven what their burden was, whereat  
The nearest shrilly pip'd forth:  
                                   "Cats, sir knight,  
To rid the palace of King Mark of rats  
That fright the fair Iseult, his Queen."  
                                   At this  
Each wrinkl'd dame her knotted sack-string loost  
And forth from out the seven sacks there stalk'd  
With pace sedate, and slowly waving tails,  
And deep-ton'd purings of well-fed content,  
Full seven times seven cats and every one  
The mother proud of seven kittens small  
That sprawl'd and mew'd beside the sacks.  
                                   Such sight  
I never saw in Camelot, altho'  
Our Camelot is vaster than Saint Ives  
And cats enow contains, as one may deem  
Who finds his slumber broken by their wails  
On roof and tow'r from midnight till the dawn,  
And long I star'd at sprawling kits, and cats,  
And sacks, and wives, until within the sacks  
The seven wives replaced the cats and kits  
And journey'd forward, wives, and sacks, and cats,  
And kits, while I with musings curious  
Past onward to Saint Ives."  
                                   "A sight indeed,"  
Here spoke Sir Sagramour, "and speedily  
The burden of the seven wives should clear  
The Cornish castle of its brood of rats  
Save one, its churlish lord, for fouler rat  
Than Mark, the craven, lives not upon earth."  
  
To whom Sir Lamoracke:  
                                   "True, Sir Sagramour,  
But tell me of thy wit, which passes mine,  
How many, reck'nest thou, to fair Saint Ives  
Were going on that morning, kits, and cats,  
And sacks, and wives."  
                                   So sweet Sir Sagramour  
Knit brows, and tighten'd lips, and fingers told  
The space of three long hours till fell the sun  
And creeping darkness came upon the land,  
And still no nearer was he to result  
Than he had been at first when Lamoracke put  
The question, nor with morning was it clear,  
And with the morning Lamoracke went his way.
