## THE LEGEND OF KING ARTHUR from *RELIQUES OF ANCIENT ENGLISH POETRY*

### by

## BISHOP THOMAS PERCY

  
  
Of Brutus' blood, in Brittaine borne,  
   King Arthur I am to name;  
Through Christendome and Heathynesse  
   Well knowne is my worthy fame.  
  
In Jesus Christ I doe beleeve;  
   I am a Christyan bore;  
The Father, Sone, and Holy Gost,  
   One God, I doe adore.  
  
In the four hundred ninetieth yeere,  
   Oer Brittaine I did rayne,  
After my Savior Christ his byrth,  
   What time I did maintaine  
  
The fellowshipp of the Table Round,  
   Soe famous in those dayes;  
Whereatt a hundred noble knights  
   And thirty sat alwayes:  
  
Who for their deeds and martiall feates,  
   As bookes done yett record,  
Amongst all other nations  
   Wer feared through the world  
  
And in the castle of Tyntagill  
   King Uther mee begate,  
Of Agyana, a bewtyous ladye,  
   And come of hie estate.  
  
And when I was fifteen yeere old,  
   Then was I crowned kinge:  
All Brittaine, that was att an upròre,  
   I did to quiett bringe;  
  
And drove the Saxons from the realme,  
   Who had opprest this land;  
All Scotland then, throughe manly feates,  
   I conquered with my hand.  
  
Ireland, Denmarke, Norwaye,  
   These countryes wan I all;  
Iseland, Gotheland, and Swetheland;  
   And made their kings my thrall.  
  
I conquered all Gallya,  
   That now is called France;  
And slew the hardye Froll in feild,  
   My honor to advance.  
  
And the ugly gyant Dynabus,  
   Soe terrible to vewe,  
That in Saint Barnards mount did lye,  
   By force of armes I slew.  
  
And Lucyus, the emperour of Rome,  
   I brought to deadly wracke;  
And a thousand more of noble knightes  
   For feare did turne their backe.  
  
Five kinges of paynims I did kill  
   Amidst that bloody strife;  
Besides the Grecian emperour,  
   Who alsoe lost his liffe.  
  
Whose carcasse I did send to Rome,  
   Cladd poorlye on a beere;  
And afterward I past Mount-Joye  
   The next approaching yeere.  
  
Then I came to Rome, where I was mett  
   Right as a conquerour,  
And by all the cardinalls solempnelye  
   I was crowned an emperour.  
  
One winter there I made abode,  
   Then word to mee was brought,  
How Mordred had oppressd the crowne,  
   What treason he had wrought  
  
Att home in Brittaine with my queene:  
   Therfore I came with speede  
To Brittaine backe, with all my power,  
   To quitt that traiterous deede;  
  
And soone at Sandwiche I arrivde,  
   Where Mordred me withstoode:  
But yett at last I landed there,  
   With effusion of much blood.  
  
For there my nephew Sir Gawaine dyed,  
   Being wounded in that sore  
The whiche Sir Launcelot in fight  
   Had given him before.  
  
Then chased I Mordered away,  
   Who fledd to London right,  
From London to Winchester, and  
   To Cornwalle tooke his flyght.  
  
And still I him pursued with speed,  
   Till at the last wee mett;  
Wherby an appointed day of fight  
   Was there agreed and set:  
  
Where we did fight, of mortal life  
   Eche other to deprive,  
Till of a hundred thousand men  
   Scarce one was left alive.  
  
There all the noble chivalrye  
   Of Brittaine took their end.  
O see how fickle is their state  
   That doe on fates depend!  
  
There all the traiterous men were slaine,  
   Not one escapte away;  
And there dyed all my vallyant knightes.  
   Alas! that woefull day!  
  
Two and twenty yeere I ware the crowne  
   In honor and great fame,  
And thus by death was suddenlye  
   Deprived of the same.
