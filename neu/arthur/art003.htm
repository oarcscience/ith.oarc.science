But he, the King,<br>  Sitting beside a window that o'erhung<br>  The stream that murmur'd past the lichen'd walls<br>  And wander'd thro' the meadows to the sea,<br>  Mus'd on the time when of the Table Round<br>  The number was complete and of his knights<br>  Not one was absent from his place.  But now<br>  The seat of many a one in Arthur's hall<br>  Was vacant, and from off the walls was gone<br>  Full many a blazon'd, burnisht, knightly shield.<br>  This had not been, so sadly Arthur mus'd,<br>  But for the apparition of the Grail<br>  Seen in a vision by that holy maid,<br>  The sister of Sir Percivale, who told<br>  The wondrous tale to all his brother knights,<br>  And straightway set them longing for the Quest.<br>  Then, while he mus'd, the voice of Dagonet,<br>  The fool, shrill'd thro' the silence, and the King<br>  Lookt up.  Before him stood the fool, who call'd,<br>  "Arouse, my brother fool, and hark to me!"<br>  Then answer'd Arthur, nothing loth to break<br>  A jest or two with little Dagonet,<br>  "But why thy brother fool am I?"<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom<br>  The jester, shaking all his bells, replied,<br>  "What sayest thou of him who constant wears<br>  A thistle next his heart and knows not whence<br>  His pain?  Who fain would make a shining crown<br>  From lumps of lead?  And such a fool art thou.<br>  And therefore shouldst thou wear a cap and bells,<br>  And therefore have I call'd thee brother fool."<br>  Then thus the King:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bitter, pointless jest;<br>  Thy wit doth not increase as doth thy age."<br>  To whom, in answer, shrill'd Sir Dagonet:<br>  "Said I not truly?  Take my cap and bells;"<br>  Then mutter'd, past the hearing of his lord,<br>  "The thistle next his heart is Guinevere,<br>  His Queen," and after, spoke aloud, "Thy knights,<br>  My brother fool, are not they all dull lumps<br>  Of lead?  And after all thy pains are spent<br>  Upon them leaden still they yet remain.<br>  Of such as these thou vainly hop'st to make<br>  A shining crown of manhood in thy realm,<br>  And therefore have I call'd thee 'brother fool.' "<br>  "Thy wit is sharply edged, my fool," here spoke<br>  The King, "and yet, for all its sharpness, fails."<br>  <br>  Thereat the dwarf peer'd curiously up<br>  Into his master's face, and seeing naught<br>  Unusual in its kingly grace, had turn'd,<br>  But turning, caught the echo of a sigh,<br>  And knew his arrow reach'd King Arthur's heart.<br>  Thereafter fell a silence on the twain<br>  And Arthur mus'd as sadly as before<br>  On hopes that had been his in long-past days<br>  When he had plann'd the healing of the world.<br>  Slow past a morning hour until at last<br>  A momentary vagrant breeze, that thro'<br>  The high, unlatticed, open window swept,<br>  Tost aimlessly an early wither'd leaf<br>  Into the kingly lap.  Then spoke the King,<br>  Smoothing the fade leaf:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir Dagonet,<br>  It may be that thy song is gentler than<br>  Thy wit; if so be, let me hear."<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat<br>  The dwarf, moving to where a gilded harp<br>  Half hidden in a corner of the room<br>  Gleam'd like a star in mellow darkness set,<br>  Sudden swept all its strings impatiently,<br>  And when the gust of music sank and died<br>  And rose again to live in wailing, sang,--<br>  And sad and bitter were the tune and words.<br>  <br>  "High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may;<br>  The buds have blown, their perfume is no more;<br>  The time is sped, the glory past away;<br>  New time, new strife,--the hours of joy are o'er;<br>  New strife, new hate, to fit this later day;<br>  New hates are deep as those that were before;<br>  High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may."<br>  <br>  The singer ended, and his bitter notes<br>  Were follow'd by the snapping of a string.<br>  Then said the King:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye do the harp a wrong,<br>  To make it sponsor for your grewsome stave,<br>  And kinder had it been to chant a strain<br>  More pleasing unto weary ears like mine."<br>  To whom then sadly spake Sir Dagonet:<br>  <br>  "No lightsome lays are left to sing; the hours<br>  Of joy are o'er;" and while the King his words<br>  Revolv'd in mind and echo found therein,<br>  The dwarf obeisance made and danced away.<br>  <br>  "High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may."<br>  The King said slowly to himself, and paus'd,<br>  For sudden rose a clamor in the streets,<br>  As if the countless dogs of Camelot<br>  Were all one voice, such uproar was there made.<br>  Then Arthur, wond'ring at the din, arose<br>  And past to an apartment that o'erlookt<br>  The city's streets, and peering forth, he saw<br>  A train of weary pilgrims near the city walls.<br>  Then open swung the weirdly sculptur'd gates,<br>  And Arthur knew the men, his knights return'd<br>  From Quest of Holy Grail.  And first rode Bors<br>  And Lancelot.  Dim were the trappings once<br>  So gay on men and steeds, and tatter'd shreds<br>  Now wav'd and flutter'd from their garments' hems.<br>  Behind rode Percivale, in dusty rags,<br>  And after, others worn and torn as he,<br>  And beggars never seem'd so poor as these,<br>  The crest and flower of Arthur's Table Round;<br>  But last of all Gawain in velvet fine<br>  Flasht gayly by with knightly comrades twain,<br>  For pleasant was the Quest for him who made<br>  So sure the holy Quest was not for him,<br>  And thus King Arthur saw his knights return<br>  From Quest a twelvemonth long of Holy Grail.<br>  <br>  Loud rose the canine clamor in the streets<br>  As these rode by, a beggar throng to eyes<br>  Which saw them pass beyond the city walls<br>  The year before, impelled by holy zeal,<br>  And he who now shone brightest, false Gawain,<br>  In honor's ranks the faintest of them all,<br>  But shriller rang the voice of Dagonet<br>  Dancing beside the train, who, as he saw<br>  The kingly face regarding all who past,<br>  With slender finger pointed to the knights<br>  Return'd as beggars from their bootless Quest,<br>  And sang, and bitter both the notes and words,--<br>  <br>  "High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may."<br>
