Rowenna *reclining in a disconsolate attitude* .  
Edelthred, Agga, *and other Attendants sleeping* .  
  
Chorus of Invisible Spirits.  
  
Rowenna rise! Thy beauteous eyes  
From clouds of sorrow clear;  
With Runic spell Each woe repel,  
And dry the falling tear.  
*Semi cho* . Rowenna! pride of Woden's race!  
With sovran power, with beauty's grace,  
And magic numbers blest!  
The impassive spirits of the air  
Obedient round thy couch repair,  
To sooth the troubled breast.  
*Cho* . Rowenna rise! &c.  
*Semi cho* . Thee, Chauntress of the Runic song!  
The misty Realms of Frost among,  
The shuddering ghosts obey.  
*Sem* . *cho* . Thy power the Fatal Sisters own,  
And Hela, trembling on her throne,  
Admits thy potent sway.  
*Cho* . Rowenna, rise, &c.  
*Sem* . *cho* . For thee Valhalla's halls are mute;  
Nor Wassail bowl, nor dire dispute  
The warrior chiefs employ.  
*Sem. cho* . While Frea, from Asgardian bowers,  
No more among her votaries showers  
The genial shafts of joy.  
*Cho* . Rowenna rise! Thy beauteous eyes  
From clouds of sorrow clear:  
With Runic spell Each woe repel,  
And dry the falling tear.  
  
Rowenna ( *rushing forward with great emotion* .)  
Arthur!--Arthur!--Hence, away,  
Intrusive spirits of the air;  
Nor, with officious zeal, display  
How impotent immortal care.  
*Sem. cho* . Hear, Rowenna!--Mistress hear!  
*Row* . Arthur!--Arthur!--In my heart  
I feel--I feel the festering dart:  
'Tis Arthur!--Arthur! all.  
In vain Asgardia's sacred bowers,  
In vain Valhalla's shield-built towers,  
Asori's gods, and Hela's powers  
Their mission'd daughter call.  
*Sem* . *cho* . Hear, Rowenna!--Mistress, Hear!  
*Sem* . *cho* . Still thy bosom. Dry the tear.  
*Sem* . *cho* . Snatch thy wand!--  
*Sem* . *cho* . Exert thy power!  
*Sem* . *cho* . O'er Asgard's foes triumphant tower,  
And chace the troubled tear.  
*Cho* . And chace the troubled tear.  
*Row* . Arthur!--Arthur!--Hence--away,  
Intrusive spirits of the air,  
Nor mock me with officious care.  
In vain did Frea charms bestow,  
And Schulda o'er the realms below  
To rule with runic spell.  
In vain with Braga I repeat,  
In mystic rhyme, Asamael sweet,  
And tune the immortal shell.  
In vain by me the Saxon name  
O'er prostrate Britain towers to fame.  
Myself inglorious fall.  
The conquering sword--the magic art  
Are baffled by the apostate heart.  
'Tis Arthur!--Arthur all.  
  
Yes--yes--'tis fruitless. Minister no more,  
Ye ever-hovering spirits! 'tis in vain,  
To sooth this storm-toss'd bosom. Earth and Air,  
And the deep-bosom'd waters, to this wand,  
Indeed, pay homage; and the elfin train  
That round the harp of Braga, echoing, throng  
(Swelling his magic numbers) on my steps  
Wait warbling; and with minstrelsey and voice,  
Obedient to my wishes, fill the air  
With choral melodies. My wiley arts  
Have thrall'd the soul of Vortigern; in whom  
Britain, my foe, lies prostrate; and the gods  
Of Scandinavia in my witching smiles  
Build their ensanguin'd altars. Cambria's sons,  
And all the Brutean race, already feel  
The woman victor. Even the nether world,  
Seasons, and circling Elements obey  
My potent biddings. Cloud-compelling Thor  
Must wield his thundering Gauntlet, or controul,  
With lifted Mace, the Giants of the Frost  
If I but chaunt The Rhyme. Yet what avails?  
Arthur disdains my charms; and o'er his heart,  
My spells are powerless. Yet once more I'll try.  
Once more the secret dwellings of The Fates  
This ken shall pierce. These feet again shall thrid  
The abodes of Hela. Rife, ye ministering maids,  
Shake from your slothful lids the charmed sleep,  
And do your wakeful service. \[ *They come forward* .  
Edelthred!  
Hast thou heard aught of strange or terrible  
Marring thy midnight slumber?  
*Edelthred* . Nothing, Madam.  
My sleep was sweet and tranquil.  
*Row* . Well--and yours?  
*Agga* . Full of sweet visions--gentle and serene.  
*Row* . 'Twas as I wish'd. Oh! impotence of power!  
Terrestrial, or supernal! To each eye--  
All but mine own--to every wearied sense  
Or Mara from some brief imperfect dream  
Wakes me, delirious, on her phantom'd forms  
To gaze with poweless horror. 'Tis too much.  
Hell, give me more: or take the power ye gave.  
Give me to triumph o'er my Arthur's heart,  
And in these arms enfold him! or my spells,  
Hence I forswear, this gifted wand I break,  
Nor at the altars of Asgardian Gods  
Chaunt hence the Runic rhyme.  
Haste Edelthred;  
Bring here my mystic robes: the same that erst  
(While the dire Sisters join'd the fearful chaunt)  
I wove in Cimbrian groves.  
  
Air *by an invisible Spirit* .  
  
Magic Woof, in Cimbrian shade  
Woven by the gifted maid,  
While the Raven-voice of Fate  
Croak'd of slaughters, fears, and hate,  
*Sem cho* . Shuddering Horror listning near.  
*Row* . Tis the fame. Go: bring it here.  
Air *as before* .  
There, beneath the blasted yew,  
Where reptiles lap the poisonous dew,  
While the bird who shuns the day  
Hooted loud, and tore his prey--  
*Semi cho* . There 'twas wove--a webb of fear!  
*Row* . Its die it drank from infant gore,  
And tears of mothers blotch it o'er;  
It is a mystic webb of fear.  
Haste my virgins: bring it here.  
  
*Ed* . Hertha defend! What means our troubled Queen?  
*Row* . Again, in that terrific pall, to thrid  
The maze of Hela; and with potent rhyme,  
Extort a boon from Fate. Can I controul  
The tempest-heaving Nocca? at my will  
Brandish the Thunderer's gauntlet? rend the air  
With bidden storms? and from the shades of night  
Evoke the wandering spirit? yet not quench,  
With its desir'd fruition, the fierce flame  
That preys upon my vitals? Does the power  
Of magic numbers not extend to Love?  
Or are our gods fastidious, to deny  
An unbelieving paramour?--save such  
Whom Weakness to uxorious faith may bow:  
Pageants! and Vortigerns! My Pall! My Pall!  
By that dread Fiend Unutterable! whose frown  
Makes Nature sterrile, I will know my doom.  
The Fatal Sisters, who, in Hela's shade,  
Weave the dark woof, shall tell me all they know,  
And with their magic aid me. Yet--forbear!  
Earth and the shuddering elements confess  
The approach of feet profane.  
*Edel* . The bugle (hark!)  
Wakening the echoes, thro the distant courts  
Sounds in the hurried blast.  
*Row* . Some voice, assured,  
Of evil omen seeks my wounded ear,  
Big with a tale of horrors. Let it come.  
What worse can greet Rowenna than the news  
That Arthur scorns her passion?  
  
*Enter* Alwin.  
Well: how now?  
Thy dark portentous brow and hurried eye  
Outstrip thy tongue's intelligence, and make  
Thy silence eloquent. Thou hast some tale  
Of horrors and disasters. Give it breath.  
I have a heart prepar'd for all the worst:  
A soul that shall not falter. I forgive  
Thy evil tidings, tho they should import  
My father's death, the Saxon overthrow,  
And Cambria's triumph.  
*Alwin* . Prophetess inspired!  
Thy words prevent my message. Such my news.  
Hengist, indeed, is fallen: The Saxon power  
Crouches to Britain. To the conflict led  
By fierce Ambrosius, with Armoric aids,  
Sudden they burst upon us, near the towers  
Of Connisburg. Arthur's enchanted sword  
Gleam'd like a pestilence; and thro' our ranks  
Scatter'd dismay and death. His dragon crest  
Belch'd streams of living fire; and on his breath  
The dread Valkyries hung; where'er he bad,  
Singling their victims.  
*Row* . Arthur? Arthur?  
*Alw* . He--  
Pendragon's fiercer son. In horrid grace,  
Wrathful he strode the field. His glittering mail  
And youthful limbs, besmear'd with Saxon blood,  
Daz'd every sense. With awful wonder fill'd,  
Our hearts were palsy'd: as tho Woden's self,  
Fresh from Iduna's banquet, came renew'd,  
To ply the work of Fate, and his own race  
Whelm in one general wreck. Meantime the king,  
Your royal father--  
*Row* . Met his arm; and died?--  
By Arthur died?  
*Alw* . Not so--that fatal deed  
Ambrosius boasts--who, hoary in his hate,  
And full of guile, engorg'd with treacherous wound  
The elfe-engaged Hengist: and he fell--  
Fell by the Briton!--while our scatter'd ranks  
Fled o'er the plain for safety--vainly sought.  
*Row* . Frea! I thank thee. Genial Goddess! hail!  
Hail the propitious omen! 'Twas thy care  
That Hengist's blood stained not the hand of Arthur.  
Pursue thy tale. Some other hour, more fit,  
We will select for tears. Occasions press;  
And we must find prompt councils. Whether fled  
The abject Vortigern?  
*Alw* . From bourg to bourg  
(By all alike rejected) with his suit,  
Westward he fled, towards his Cambrian wilds,  
A hunted fugitive: till join'd, at last,  
By those who 'scap'd the slaughter, he attain'd  
The heights of bleak Farinioch. There he lurks,  
Hem'd by Gwrtheyrnion's towers, whose giant strength  
Frowns o'er the midway steep. Thither he bore  
(From his incestuos passion unestrang'd)  
His fair, reluctant daughter, Guenever.  
*Row* . She scap'd not then into the arms of Arthur?  
She is secure. Revenge at least is sure:  
And Love has hope! Say, hast thou aught beside  
That may import my hearing?  
*Alw.* Sovereign! nought:  
But that the exulting victor, to destroy  
The Saxon hope, has purpose to depose  
Our pageant Vortigern; and, in his place,  
Crown the new idol, Arthur.  
*Row* . ( *aside* ) Arthur crown'd?  
And so he shall be. But not crown'd by them.  
That is Rowenna's Dower: the dower confirm'd  
By the three Fatal Sisters.--While I live,  
Thy empire, Albion, waits my spousal love:  
And Arthur, if he reigns, must reign by me.  
Alwin, what else?  
*Alw* . Your royal will. Beside  
Nought now remains untold.  
*Row* . Then, Alwin, thus--  
Haste to Gwrtheyrnion with what scatter'd powers  
Your speed may gather. See the gates secur'd  
Against my soon arrival. I shall bring  
Such powerful succours as may best defend  
The alpine fortress, should the victors dare  
To press us to a siege. Away. Begone. \[ *Exit Alw* .  
O Edelthred! O Agga! why should thus  
My heart beat lighter, and the breath more free  
Distend my sportive bosom? Hengist slain--  
The Saxon routed!--Here is the cause of grief  
For Nature and Ambition. But my soul  
Is full of Love and Arthur. Frea smiles  
To my best hopes propitious; and, amidst  
The storms of adverse destiny, my heart  
Finds anchor in her aid.  
  
Goddess of the genial hour!  
Hear, O! hear my votive sigh;  
And, tho' adverse Fortune lour,  
Fear and Sorrow I defy,  
Goddess of the genial hour!  
Grief may drop the transient tear,  
Wild Ambition heave the breast;  
But, if thou in smiles appear,  
All is tranquil--all is blest,  
Goddess of the genial hour!  
Fear and Sorrow I defy,  
Tho my adverse fortune lour,  
Hear but thou my votive sigh,  
Goddess of the genial hour!  
  
*Edel* . And she will hear it--if we aught may judge  
The future by the present. Could we hope  
A fairer pledge of promise? Arthur's hand  
Slew not your father.--Arthur's conquering aid  
Could not redeem his Guenever.  
*Row* . 'Tis there  
My fondest hopes are fix'd--Still, still she pines  
In hostile bonds--still hears with steadfast hate  
(Would it were not so steadfast!) the foul suit  
Of that incestuous Vortigern: or writhes,  
Perchance, subjected to his foul embrace,  
Calling, in vain, on Arthur. I will aid  
The lawless passion of this monster king,  
Goading his vile desires, and urging on  
To their impell'd fruition. Haply so  
(For man, with sickly appetite, abhors  
Oft from the trick of Fancy) Arthur hence  
Shall loath her rifled beauties: She no more  
Shall seem or chaste or lovely; and his eyes  
Confess superiour merit. Then shall soon  
Adultrous Vortigern my vengeance feel;  
And his polluted paramour: This hand  
Shall lift my Arthur to an envied throne,  
And our united sceptres blend the tribes  
Of Cimbria and of Britain. Say I well?  
*Agga* . Well: if The Fates ordain.  
*Row* . We will enquire.  
And for such purpose in The Secret Grove  
Chant we the spell. My double-visag'd Fate  
(Ghastly at once and jocund) goads me on  
Amidst a storm of passions. To The Grove  
Initiate Virgins, and the haunted cave;  
There join the fearful chaunt. And ye, unseen--  
Ye shapeless spirits of the impassive air,  
Lend me your minstrelsey. Yet first evoke  
The oafish Incubus. While yet the bat,  
Beneath the ominous mantle of the night,  
Follows the beetles hum, be it his talk  
To scout the country round; if chance he learn  
Tidings of Arthur; who, at once impell'd  
By love and by ambition, will pursue  
The steps of Guenever. Him should he find,  
Upon the attendant train let him essay  
His numbing tricks: that while they, shivering, sink  
In senseless torpor, Arthur, all alone  
These eyes once more may meet. Evoke the fiend.  
What further I design the mystic grove  
And secret cave shall witness. Join me there  
Where, in my Cimbrian pall and snaky tire,  
I chaunt the spell to Hertha.  
  
  
Howl of wolves, and ghosts of night,  
In the fearful chorus join,  
While The Moon withdraws his light,  
And the stars, in dim afright,  
Veil their orbs, and fear to shine.  
Hark!--they wait to swell the rite--  
Howl of wolves and ghosts of night!  
\[ *Exeunt* Row. Edel. &c.  
  
  
  
Scene II. *Manet* Agga.  
*Agga* . Incubus! Incubus!  
*Incubus, (below.)* Whu-u-u! Whe-e-ether now?  
Who-o-o calls so loud?  
*Agga* . You know, I trow.  
Incubus! Incubus!  
Did you not your mistress hear?  
*Incub* . Ye-e-e-e-yes--  
Behold your shivering devil here.  
  
*The ground uncloses, and thro the chasm rises a meagre spectre, with a
blue and frosty  
countenance, sunken eyes, frozen locks and beard, and garments covered
with icicles.  
*  
*Incub* . ( *Shaking the snow from his sides.* ) Whu-u-u-u!  
What's the business pr'ythee now?  
*Agga* . Son of Frost! you know I trow.  
Did you not your Mistress hear?  
*Incub* . Hear? O yes; there's no fear of that, I  
assure you. When 'tis a woman we serve, our orders  
are sure to be sufficiently audible! The frosts of Hela  
cannot plug up one's ears against the *clear* tones of  
the feminine organ. But pr'ythee now, leave off your  
rhyming and your incantations, and blow my fingers  
for me a little.--It is half a century since I have  
been able to breathe any thing but sleet and hailstones  
upon them myself.  
*Agga* . Really I have no warm breath to spare upon so  
cold a subject.  
*Incub* . Why I suppose, indeed, I am not very engaging.  
Some thousand years hence, when ice-creams are  
predestined to become an article of luxury,  
some lady of honour, may chance to take a liking to a joint or  
two, by way of stomachic: But at present, I believe,  
there is no great danger of my being devour'd by  
the fair sex.  
*Agga* . Not if they are of my taste, at least.  
*Incub* . But pray, good Mrs. Journeywoman Sorceress!  
have you any further instructions? Any snug little  
commission for yourself?  
*Agga* . Good Mr. Journeyman Devil! no.--If ever  
I admit any of your infernal train into my service, it  
shall be a devil of better quality.  
*Incub* . Aye! aye! Mrs. you are for a good plump  
roasting devil I suppose. This essence of snow and  
icicles might melt before the blaze of your beauty.  
*Agga.* What, you think I have some attractions then?  
*Incub* . Attractions! Before I descended into the  
regions of Hela, to have my blood converted into icicles,  
I should have been ready to die for you any half hour  
of my existience.  
*Ag* . Were you such a Dragon amongst us in your  
life time?--Come, come; I suspect it was not for this  
you were sent to The Frozen Regions  
*Inc* . Why, no: offences of that sort are punished  
in a Hell of a very different description. In short, there  
is no dissembling. You know the mysteries of our  
faith; and the thing speaks for itself. Our fisticuff  
Divinities and I happened not to set up our horses  
together on the subject of the exquisite delight of being  
hacked and hewed into a thousand pieces. Not  
but that I could be valiant enough in my own way:  
for my mouth was full of big oaths; and my brow  
seemed as dark with danger as a thunder-cloud: till a  
disastrous coincidence took the sword of my renown  
out of my mouth, and placed it in my hand.  
*Ag* . Ha! ha! poor Incubus! And then I suppose  
it was perfectly out of its element.  
*Inc* . In short, the signal for battle was given; when  
suddenly a cold sweat coming over me, I slunk from  
the ranks; hid myself in a house of conveniency; died  
of apprehension, before the conflict was decided; was  
conveyed immediately to the Realms of Mist and Frost,  
and hung up for an icicle upon the eaves of Hela's  
palace; where I might right ruefully have remained,  
without remission or intermission, hope or holiday, the  
whole predestinated period of my purgation.--  
*Agga* . Purgation? What, then, you do not expect  
to await The Twilight of the Gods in your present frozen  
state?  
*Incub* . Schulda forbid! Let me see: according to  
my calculation, I have now--But if your invisible  
musicians will help me out with an accompaniment, I  
will describe, in a song, the year of my regeneration.  
  
When the twelvemonth's contention of Cent'ries is done,  
Whether eighteen be ended, and nineteen begun,  
And Learning and Science their optics shall strain  
To find some new nothing to puzzle the brain;  
Then the Fates to this world shall my essence restore,  
To shudder in Regions of Hela no more.  
  
O! how different the race that my eyes shall behold!  
For a soul of my kidney a true age of Gold!  
Since none for his fears can be look'd on the worse,  
Where they count for their fame not their fears but their purse  
Then the Fates to this World, &c.  
  
Then The Fair--Oh! how fair their sweet persons will shine,  
When our helmets and scull-caps to them we resign,  
When no grace of the form shall in vain be bestow'd,  
And nakedness self be the tip of the mode.  
  
Then their motions so easy, their manners so free!  
In *ferae naturae* you'd deem them to be;  
And Miss just in her teens, from all bashfulness freed,  
Shall now skip o'er the rope, and now skip o'er the tweed:  
  
O! how gay then I'll flirt and I'll flutter around,  
Where the belles of the young 19th Cent'ry are found!  
Their charms so obtrusive shall kindle a flame;  
Shall melt all the ice that now stiffens my frame;  
And I'll think, while Love's ardour shall glow in each pore,  
Of the Regions of Frost and of Hela no more.  
\[ *Exeunt* .  
  
  
  
Scene III. *The Magic Grove; with the entrance of  
the Cave of Incantations--a rude and rocky chasm,  
overhung with shattered yew trees, and every species  
of gloomy and noxious vegetation. The darkness of  
the scene is only imperfectly interruupted by the transient  
glare of meteors from above, and the blue vapours,or  
fen damps, that play about the Magic Circle described  
at the entrance of the Cave. Shrieks and groans, and  
bellowing noises, heard occasionally in the air; &c.  
  
* Rowenna *is discovered, arrayed in her Pall and snaky  
hair dishevelled, and intermixed with Ivy, Hemlock,  
Nightshade, &c. A* Female Child *accompanies  
them, bearing the Pictured Drum and Double Ham-  
mer, with a rosary of Brazen Rings, and images of  
serpents, frogs, toads, and other obscene reptiles, used  
in the mysteries of Northern Magic.  
  
  
Row* . Strike, strike, The mystic Drum, virgin yet pure  
Of passion's secret wish! from sacred folds  
Of chill equatic Loomskin, lift on high  
The awful Hammer, while the Brazen Ring,  
Viper, and venom'd Toad, and Frog that croaks  
In pools obscene, and Newt of mouldering wall  
Dance o'er the pictur'd surface, and in reel  
Prophetic of our wavering destinies,  
Lead up The Rites.  
Ye Demons of the Storm!  
Who thro the mirky clouds with transient glare  
Stoop to our incantations, or, appall'd,  
Shriek in the midnight blast, with yell or groan  
Swelling the chorus of the shuddering Grove,  
While growls the distant bear, and in his den  
The hungry wold barks fear-chain'd!--it is well;  
Ye feel my power, and own it. Aid me then  
If these mysterious Rites--or ye who rive  
With Thor's own bolts the groaning earth, or ye  
Who to the labouring mine's combustion'd womb  
Dart the contagious spark, whence Earthquake rends,  
Or pent Volcano spits his sulphurous fires,  
Wide wafting! for to Hela's misty realms  
I force my way, and to The Fatal Three  
Who weave the Webb of Destiny. \[ *Enter* Agga.  
How now?--  
Tardy and shuddering? Hast thou in thy way  
Gather'd the spume-froth'd drugs, on which, o'ertoil'd,  
The Bat hath crouch'd, and the Night-Swallow drop'd  
Her half-churn'd morsels?--  
*Agga* . Mistress, they are here:--  
But, use them not! Some hostile star prevails--  
Our Gods forsake us. Never, since the hour  
When, with initiate feet, I first approach'd  
This mystic Circle, felt my soul such horror.  
At ever and anon, as, from my speed  
Pausing, I stoop'd, some ominous shriek was heard,  
Or deathlier groan:--the herbs, o'erconscious, shrunk  
My trembling touch; the glare of fiery eyes  
Peep'd from the unhallow'd turf; and up mine arm  
Darts the benumbing shock--as lighning struck!--  
That three-times thrice (while shook the earth beneath)  
From my full apron drop'd the unwilling store--  
With shuddering toil replac'd. Forbear! forbear  
The ill-omen'd spell!  
*Row* . Mere womanish fear. Away!  
My soul is all on fire, and I must seek  
The quenching stream, or perish. Come: draw near.  
Give me The Drugs. Thus from my bruising hands  
I press the powerful dews. Now, strike again  
The spheric Drum, and in the fawn's warm blood  
Stoop, stoop and wash--'Tis done. Begin the chaunt.  
*Chorus* . Hela! hear!  
*Edel* . Queen of Niflheim's misty shade  
*Agga* . Frozen Hela! ghastly maid!  
*Row* . From thy Throne of Horrors--hear!  
*Edel* . By the Giants of the Frost!  
*Agga* . By Ising's fury-beaten coast!  
*Row* . By the Dome of Anguish--hear!  
*Edel* . By thy Table, Famine-spread!  
*Agga* . By thy lean unshelter'd Bed!  
*Row* . Threshold bleak and Chasm dread!  
*Chorus* . Hela! hear!  
*Edel* . Furies dread of Woden's hall!  
*Agga* . By whom the fated heroes fall--  
*Row* . Dread Valkyries!--bend and hear!  
*Edel* . And ye Nornies--fearful three!  
Who thro Fate's dark workings see--  
Weaving the Webb that mortals fear--  
*Chorus* . Fatal Sisters! list, and hear!  
  
*Row. bending towards the earth, with her Wand up-  
lifted, as in act to strike* .  
Hertha! ope thy rock-rib'd side--  
Ribs of Ymer's giant pride!  
Ribs by Odin, Vile, and Ve--  
Awful Godhead! mystic Three!  
From Ymer torn, and giv'n to thee.  
*Adel. and Agga* . Hertha! ope thy rock-rib'd side--  
Ribs of Ymer's giant pride!  
*Chorus* . Hertha! hear! \[ *A groan below.*  
*Edel* . Hertha labours. Soon the spell  
Shall her reluctant womb compel.  
*Agga* . Soon the once-tried depths below  
Again their gates shall open throw.  
  
*Row* . Cease, ye maidens--cease your strains:  
Mine the talk that yet remains.  
Hertha's rock-rib'd side uncloses;  
Hell its hideous womb exposes;  
Groans, and shrieks, and plaints of woe  
Roar in troubled floods below.  
Fly ye maids! To me alone  
Hertha's secret ways are known.  
  
*Subterranean thunder* . Edelthred, Agga, &c. *dis-  
appear. The cavern bursts open. A swarm of hideous*  
Phantoms *rush, with great clamour, from the cleft;  
thro whom* Rowenna *rushes, and descends. The  
* Phantoms *form themselves into groups, some of  
which join in a sort of fantastic and conflicting dance,  
striking at each other, and buffetting the air; while  
others join in discordant chaunt.*  
  
*Chorus* . Fell enchantress! hold! forbear!  
*1. Phantom* . 'Tis in vain. We beat the air.  
*2. Ph.* Phantom'd Terrors glare in vain.  
*3. Ph* . Nature's laws no more restrain.  
*All three* . Desperate Magic bursts the chain.  
*Cho* . Hertha groans in terrene thunder:  
Ribs of Rock are burst asunder.  
*1. Ph* . Sulphur! *2. Ph* . Nitre! *3.Ph.* Miner's damp,  
Fatal to the vital lamp--  
*All* . Thro the cavern'd entrails fume:  
*2. Ph* . And the Wolf-like Serpent's spume.  
*Chorus* Midgard's Serpent, fierce and dread,  
Lifts his all-devouring head.  
*1. Ph* . Fiercely writhes his scaly zone.  
*2. Ph* . Nature trembles on her throne.  
*Cho* . Gods and Hela join the groan.  
*1. Ph* . Hark! the Hell-dog's tripple growl!  
*2. Ph* . Rafaen's scream! *3. Ph* . And Fenrir's howl!  
*Cho* . Thrillling shriek! and deaf'ning growl!  
*1. Ph* . Fell enchantress! *2. Ph* . On she goes--  
*3. Ph* . Eager of impending woes.  
*All* . To the nine-fold realm she goes!  
*Chorus* .  
Hertha's rock-rib'd side uncloses;  
Niflheim's gloom in vain opposes;  
Groans, and shrieks, and plaints of woe  
Roar, in bootless floods, below.  
*They rush into the chasm, and it closes.*  
  
Scene IV. The Abodes of Hela.  
*The stage, at first, appears involoved in darkness and mist,  
so that the objects at the back part of the scene are not dis-  
cernable. Thunder and occasional flashes of Lightning.  
  
Row* . ( *without* .) Hela!--Hela!--Hela!  
*Hela* . What mortal organs thus aloud proclaim,  
With triple invocation, Hela's name?  
*Row* . ( *entering* ) Regent of the nine-fold shade!  
Shuddering Hela! Ghastly Maid!  
Bid the mists of darkness fly  
Scattering from the nether sky!  
  
*Hela* . Say who art thou who thus, with daring tread,  
Invad'st the dreary mansions of the dead?  
  
Fear! presumptuous mortal! fear!  
Draw not to my threshold near.  
Draw not near! Confess thy fear!  
And shun my fury ere too late.  
*Row* . Hela! no:--I cannot fear;  
Tho the Furies all appear,  
Sprung from Lok's prolific hate.  
*Hela* . Draw not near. Learn to fear  
Fenrir's howl, and Hela's hate.  
*Row* . Hela, no: I cannot fear  
Fenrir's howl, or Niflheim's hate.  
  
By the channels twelve that drank  
Hevergelmer's vapours dank,  
Where the direful rivers flow,  
Streams of horror, plaint, and woe!  
I have travers'd, void of fear,  
To seek the Fatal Sisters here.  
  
*Cho* . Regent of the nine-fold shade!  
Shuddering Hela! Ghastly Maid!  
Bid the mists of darkness fly.  
  
*Row* . O'er the Bridge where Giö rolls--  
Fearful pass to dastard souls!  
By The Dog of hideous yell,  
By the iron grate of Hell,  
Ghastly Hela! I have come  
To tax The Fates, and know my doom.  
  
*Cho* . Regent of the nine-fold shade!  
Shuddering Hela! ghastly Maid!  
Bid the mists of darkness fly.  
  
*Trio, and Chorus, by The Fatal Sisters, &c.  
Urd and* Who art thou who thus presume  
*Schulda* . To tax the Fatal Sisters o'er their loom?  
*Verandi* . Fly! daring mortal!  
*Urd* . Daring mortal! fly.  
*Schulda* . Fly! nor urge thy instant doom.  
*Cho* . Fly, daring mortal! fly: nor urge thy instant doom!  
  
*Row* . Hela! from thy nether sky  
Bid the mists of darkness fly:  
Soon shall to your eyes appear  
One your shuddering spectres fear.  
Soon The Sisters o'er the loom  
The shuttled hand shall check, and tell my doom.  
  
Hela! from thy nether sky  
Bid the mists of darkness fly,  
Ere the looud resistless spell  
Shake the dire abodes of Hell--  
Ere this wand's terrific stroke  
The Unutterable Fiend evoke.  
  
*Hela* . Fly! ye mists of Nörver--fly!--  
Dager claims our nether sky.  
Dread Enchantress! stop the spell.  
Rowenna!!!-------Now I know thee well.  
*  
The mists dispersing,* Hela *is discovered; a meagre  
ghastly spectre, seated on a throne of Ice, on the pre-  
cipitous threshold of a palace of the same material:  
the whole scene exhibiting a dreary spectacle of Rock,  
and Ice, and Snow.  
Her Throne is guarded by* The Giants of Frost,  
a *race of deformed and enormous monsters, whose  
heads reaching the top of the stage, are involved in  
clouds and vapours. Their hair and beards formed  
of icicles: their Garments of Snow: their complexions  
livid, and their forms mishapen. Meteors play around  
their heads; and snow and hailstones issue from their  
mouths and nostrils. A throng of shuddering spectres  
around; some sauntering about; others root-bound;  
and all covered with snow and icicles* . The Demons  
of Storm and Tempest *wait behind the Chair.*  
*  
On the other side, in a cave apart, are seen* The Fatal  
Sisters *at their loom. Sculls are fixed to the beams  
instead of weights; the chamber is lighted by a Lamp  
and a blazing Cauldron.* Rafaen, *i.e. the Raven  
of Schulda hovers over their heads.  
  
* Trio. Urd, Verandi, Schulda.  
  
Weave The Webb--the webb of Fate!  
Ply it early--ply it late!  
Fates of falling empires weave!  
Woes that suffering mortals grieve!  
Spindles turn; the shuttle throw;  
Treacherous joys, and lasting woe,  
In the fatal texture grow.  
Weave the Woof--the woof of Fate!  
Ply it early--ply it late!  
*Urd* . Take the sample from the past.  
*Verandi* . Present sorrows thicken fast.  
*Schulda* . But the worst shall come at last,  
*All* . Weave The Woof--the woof of Fate!  
Ply it early--ply it late!  
Fates of falling empires weave!  
Woes that suffering mortals grieve!  
Spindles turn--the shuttle throw;  
Treacherous joys and lasting woe  
In the fatal texture grow.  
*Chorus* . Weave The Webb--the webb of Fate!  
Ply it early--ply it late  
  
*Row* . Cease, fatal hags! the ill-omen'd yell forego.  
Speak: for ye can. I come my fate to know.  
  
*Schul* . Sorceress, yet in early bloom!  
Tax us not, but wait thy doom.  
Soon enough thy woe shall come.  
  
*Row* . Whate'er the will of changeful Fortune be,  
I murmur not, nor question HER decree.  
Weave close the secret woof, ye baleful three.  
Not for the gauds of empire now I seek:  
Crowns ye may give, and settled sceptres break.  
I fathom not, in this, your dire decree:  
For what are crowns and sceptres now to me?  
But of Arthur I must know--  
Doom of joy?--or Doom of Woe?  
*Urd* . When first the fatal bowl you gave,  
And Vortigern became your slave,  
Then for sovran power you pray'd;  
And Fatal Sisters lent their aid.  
*All* . Then for sovran power you pray'd;  
And Fatal Sisters lent their aid.  
*Row* Sisters thanks: but this I know.  
*Veran* . But now no more ambition swells:  
Thy secret soul on Arthur dwells:  
Arthur, who, in Lunvey's groves,  
Ev'n now, in wildering anguish, roves.  
*All* . Arthur now, in Lunvey's groves,  
In heart-consuming anguish roves.  
*Row* . Sisters thanks that this I know.  
But yet a further boon bestow.  
Past and present ye have shown:  
Make, O! make the future known.  
Schulda! say what you decree?  
Direfull'st of the direful three!  
Quick: divine: Is Arthur mine?  
Schulda! say what you decree?  
*Shul* . Woden fits on Asgard hills;  
Where Hydrassil's Ash distills  
Nectar'd drafts of dew divine.  
There alone, in accents clear,  
My Raven whispers in His ear,  
What the future Fates design.  
  
*Row* . But I in lore of mystic arts excel,  
And Fate's ambiguous book with ease can spell.  
Speak, Fatal Sister! speak; and I'll explain:  
Tho mystery involve the strain.  
*Sch* . Sister--ere the memory dye,  
Speak again of things gone by.  
*Urd* . Once, to snare a monarch's soul,  
Fair Rowenna drugg'd a bowl.  
*Row* . I did--I did. Upon my knee,  
Vortigern! I gave it thee.  
*Sch* . When the bowl again goes round,  
And Vortigern his sleep profound  
Heedless quaffs--  
*Row* . Hela laughs!--  
Plain the drift my sense descries.  
Sisters thanks.---He dies! he dies!  
*Hela* . Wide my iron portals throw:  
Perjur'd ghosts descend below.  
Open throw. To realms of woe,  
Perjur'd ghosts descend below.  
*Row* . Plain the drift my sense descries.  
Hela thanks.-------He dies! He dies!  
*Sch* . Then shall close Thy jealous woes,  
Arthur's hand shall light the fire  
In which thy sorrows all expire.  
*Row* . Propitious Schulda! thanks. But what of her--  
The Cambrian viper! hateful Guenever?  
*Sch* . More thy rival to confound,  
Fire and Water shall surround;  
Ruthless flames, and waves profound.  
Arthur's hand no help shall lend,  
No mortal arm the maid befriend,  
Nor aid from pitying Heaven descend.  
*Row* . Schulda thanks. Enough of her  
My hated rival Guenever.  
*Hela* . Wide my iron portals throw:  
Perjur'd Ghosts descend below.  
Open--open--open throw!  
To realms of woe,  
Perjur'd ghosts descend below.  
*Row* . Plain the drift my soul descries.  
Vortigern---------He dies!--He dies!  
Arthur's hand shall light the fire  
In which my sorrows all expire.  
Hela's ghosts the joy shall feel  
Joining in the giddy reel!  
Look for Fenrir say me nay:  
'Tis Rowenna's holyday.  
  
*She waves her wand; and instantly the whole train of  
frozen spectres rush to the middle of the stage, and  
join in a fantastic dance; while all the vocal characters repeat in  
  
Grand Chorus* .  
Wide the iron portals throw.  
Perjur'd ghosts descend below.  
Hela's sons the triumph feel,  
Joining in the giddy reel.--  
Lok nor Fenrir say us nay:  
'Tis Rowenna's Holiday.  
  
End of the First Act.  
  
  
Act II. Scene I.  
  
*Lynn Savadan; or, Langorfe Pool; by Moonlight.  
  
A Dance of* Fairies.  
  
1. *Fairy* . While the Moon with silver sheen  
Spangles o'er Savadan's Lake,  
Fairies to the margent green  
Haste from grotto, bower, and brake,  
And in our lunar rites partake.  
*Chorus* . Elves from grotto, bower, and brake,  
*1. Fa* . Frisk it! *2. Fa* . Frisk it! *3. Fa* . Frisk it!  
*Ch* . Frisk it round the silver lake.  
*1. Fa* . Nor ye who, in your golden boat,  
The water lily, love to float.  
Chacing oft, with merry Lay,  
The beams that o'er the rippling surface play,  
These our lunar rites forsake.  
*Sem. cho* . Elves from grotto, bower, and brake--  
Fays that skim Savadan's lake--  
*1. Fa* . Ever gay *2. Fa* . While ye may.  
*1. Fa* . Trip it. *2. Fa* . Trip it! *3. Fa* . Trip away!  
*Cho* . Join the dance, and join the lay.  
*2. Fa* . Flowers opprest by noontide heat  
Let the breath of Fragrance cheer;  
And as we brush with nimble feet,  
Blights and Mildews disappear,  
And all that taint the vernal year.  
*Sem. cho* . Disappear!--Disappear!--Disappear!--  
*1. Fa* . As we whisk it! *2. Fa* . Frisk it! *3. Fa* . Whisk it!  
*1. Fa* . Whisk it! frisk it! Frisk it! whisk it!  
*Cho* . Let the breath of Fragrance cheer  
The vernal year.  
  
The Lady of the Lake *rises on a Throne of Spars  
and Coral, in a car, or water chariot, drawn by  
Swans* .  
  
*Lady* . Enough, ye elves and fairies!--ye who ride  
The lunar beam, or on the surface skim,  
Buoyant, of lake or rill, or thro mid air  
Bestride the gossamer; and ye who lurk  
Beneath my bordering flow'rets, or the leaves  
Of pensile shrubs, that from Savadan's marge  
Inhale their freshness. Well have ye preform'd  
Your modest funtions, from the irriguous haunts,  
Chacing the Sterrile Fiend, and all the rout  
That hurt with anguish spells, that neither blight,  
Canker, nor smut, thro all my favourite bowers,  
Insect nor worm appears, of power to mar  
The buds of vernal promise. Tis enough.  
Now other cares invite; and other fears  
Swell in my anxious bosom. Arthur's fate  
Hangs on the tremulous balance.  
  
From coral groves and spar-encrusted dome,  
Where, enthron'd in virgin pride,  
O'er their secret urns preside  
The sedg'd-crown'd sisters fair,  
Who make the sylvan lakes their care,  
I come.  
For deep in that sequester'd home  
The voice of Anguish pierc'd my ear,  
From Lunvey's echoing groves.  
There where hostile spells surrounding  
(All his rising hopes confounding)  
Rack his soul with pangs severe--  
There--ah! there--  
Mourning----pining--  
Every blissful thought resigning--  
There bewilder'd Arthur roves.  
For him I grieve,  
For him my coral grots I leave,  
Yoke my white swans, and breathe this terrene air.  
Haste ye Fairies, haste ye then--  
Search the woodland, search the glen.  
For deeds of love forego your vagrant sport,  
And in my secret grotto make report.  
  
*Cho* . Mistress, you shall be obey'd.  
*1. Fa* . Sisters each your province take:  
Mount the breeze, or skim the lake:  
Thrid with care the leafy shade.  
*2.F* . Frisk it! *3.F* . Whisk it! *4.F.* Trip it! *5.F* . Flit it!  
*Cho* . Mistress you shall be obey'd. \[ *They vanish* .  
  
The Lady *returns to her Car, and the scene closes.*  
  
  
Scene II. *A hanging Wood on the borders of a little  
Stream.  
  
Enter* Incubus, *shaking his fingers and rubbing  
his hands.  
  
* Who-o-o-o! what a poor undone devil am I! When  
I am freezing and dangling on the eves of Hela's palace,  
I do nothing but sigh and pray that my nechromantic  
mistress, here, or some other of my terrestrial employers  
would be kind enough to stand in need on my assistance,  
and give me a blind-man's holiday, in this warmer atmos-  
phere; yet here have I been wandering only two or  
three hours, and the frost in my joints is converted into  
so horrible a hot-ache, that I begin to wish my icicle-  
ship had remained undisturbed, in the pure state of sub-  
terranean congelation, where the Giants of Frost had  
fixed me. But the worst is, the night is almost spent,  
and my task not completed. A precious cataplasm will  
be clapped to my sores, I'll warrant, if I descend to  
Niflheim again with an imperfect account of my mission.  
A plague o'that drunken desperado, Tristam! one  
by one, I have nabbed all the reft; and laid the whole  
Round Table (knights, squires, and all) as quiet as  
Mead and Wassail ever laid them at high festival: but  
Lok himself (the father of all mischief) cannot get that  
dragon-eater out of the reach of Arthur's enchanted  
sword: to hazard the vengeance of which requires a  
little more of the fool-valiant than belongs to any devil  
of my kidney.---But behold!-----A plague on all blun-  
derers! How came I not to think of that before?  
What sort of an angler, for a devil, must I be, when a  
Welchman was to be caught, not to think of Cwrw?  
-----Cwrw!! Cwrw!!!--------Cwrw!!!!!!-----But here  
they come. Bo-peep's the word, and then to my last  
shift. \[ *Exit.*  
  
*Enter* Arthur; *and* Tristram, *drunk, with a cag* .  
  
*Arthur* . Distraction! furies! whether do we rove?  
On what enchanted region have we trod,  
Beset with hellish fiends? Mine eyes deceive--  
This is not Lunvey. These are not the groves  
Where once, with songs prophetic, o'er my head  
The ministering fairies danc d, touching my lips  
With charm of sweetest numbers, and my limbs  
(Yet in their infant swathes) with iron force  
Nerving resistless. Or, if such it be,  
The Saxon Demons o'er the Isle prevail,  
And our Good Spirits leave us.  
*Tristram* ( *turning up his cag* .) Spirits! O, yes, your  
honour's highness!--our spirits are all gone; that's certain.  
Here it is, your honour's highness! Round and sleek;  
----just the same big belly it set out with. But it's de-  
livered your honour's highness! fairly delivered; and so  
there's an end to our deliverance.  
Hollow! hollow! ( *knocking against it with his  
knuckles* )--Hollow as a false friend, who preaches and  
moralises when Necessity is at the door: and then he  
rings, just like this--all his swelling words being nothing  
but emptiness!  
*Ar* . Oh! Guenever! Guenever! At such a time!  
They could not all desert me. Dastards all!  
Chieftains renown'd for hardiest enterprise  
Turn dastards on the spur?--------I'll not believe it.  
*Trist* . No, your honour's highness! nor little Tristram  
neither: any more than he'll believe his costrel is a  
perpetual spring: and that it is not, there is heavy proof  
in all this lightness. ( *Throwing it up and catching it.)*  
Light! light!--Light as a Courtier's promise--or a Court  
Lady's morals.---O that a light costrel and a dark destiny  
should go thus together.----( *As he is tossing the Costrel  
about he tumbles* .) Seated your honour's highness!--  
Seated!--But what signifies seating now? The round  
table ( *Placing the cag before him* )--ah! your honour's  
highness! The round table is quite empty.  
*Ar* . Significant drunkard! dost thou make a scoff  
And jest of my afflictions?  
*Trist* . O Lord! your honour's highness! quite the  
contrary. Moralising, your honour--moralising. Inspi-  
red!--spiritualised!--What were good liquor good for,  
if it did not put good thoughts into one's head?  
*Ar* . It is enchantment all. Demoniac spells  
Have snar'd their feet, and Hell's suborned fiends  
Have with incestuous Vortigern conspir'd  
To mock my high rais'd hopes. Oh! sacred wax!  
( *pulling out a pair of Tablets and pressing them to his lips* )  
Grav'd with the sweetest words, by fairest hands---  
And yet how terrible!------Dear, direful proof  
Of chastest constancy!----This night----this night----  
With such a cause to charm them to their oaths  
Could they have fled, like recreants?  
*Trist* . Fl-e-ed! O yes, your honour's highness; flown,  
I'll answer for them: but it was at second hand; as they  
trot when they ride o' cockhorse. I'll swear by a full  
costrel--(for it would be but an empty oath to swear by  
a costrel that was not full--and would shew me, as it  
were, to be but a 'squire of hollow faith) I saw the  
Devil fly away with half a dozen of them. I sup-  
pose if it had not been for my Guardian Spirit ( *lifting  
up the cag* ) I should have known myself what sort of a  
poney His Devilship is. And then---ha! ha! ha! ha!  
*Ar* . Peace, babbling Jester! Art thou too possest?  
*Trist* . Ho! ho! ho! I beg pardon, your honour's  
highness--but i'faith I can't help laughing, to think--  
ha! ha! ha! if the devil had laid hold of me, what a  
figure I should have made, charioteering between a pair  
of sooty wings, with two great horns in my hands, by  
way of reins, and a huge pair of saucer eyes before me,  
for lanthorns.---Ho! ho! ho!---What a dash!  
*Ar* . ( *still grasping The Tablets, and gazing upon them  
with encreased emotion* .) This night--this night--  
The last permitted to the anxious calm  
Of Innocence unviolate!--This Night  
That, midst the curtain'd silence, still shall talk  
Of its successor's horrors--of the hour  
When the soul father lover (so decreed)  
Flush'd from the riotous banquet--lust enflam'd!--  
Inebriate to incest!---------Hell is there!--  
*He walks, distractedly several times, to and fro; then  
pauses--opens the tablets again, and reads* .  
"This night, this night!--all means of death remov'd,  
"(The last poor respite tears and prayers could gain)  
"I give to thoughts of Thee, and to those vows  
"Of chastest love inviolate we pledg'd  
"On Usk's remember'd banks. This night (yet pure)  
"I dare to think I am Arthur's. All beyond--  
"All if Gwrtheyrnion's walls----------But haste and save!  
"Haste with thy Warrior Knights--Oh! that this breath,  
"That never flows but to wing prayers to Heaven  
"For thee and for thy safety--that this breath--------  
"But worse impends---Worse to *thy* heart--to *mine!*  
"---To mine! Oh! persecuting Heaven! that aught  
"Than Arthur's safety--Arthur's sacred life  
"Can be more precious to the shuddering heart  
"Of his disastrous Guenever!"  
Despair!-----  
"But haste and save! Haste with thy warrior knights!"  
Alas! where are they? Ho! ye recreants, ho!---  
Follow me. Once again, with hopeless search,  
Thro the night-thickened labyrinths let us wind,  
Wakening the sullen Echoes; if perforce,  
With their reverberate aid, our shouts may reach  
The chance-bewilder'd straglers---if but Chance,  
Not Hell, or fouler Treachery, have sapt  
Their faith till now undoubted.----Ho! what ho!  
My Guenever!--disastrous guenever! \[ *Exit* .  
*Trist* . Oh! my Costrel!----my sweet, lovely------  
poor, miserable, empty Costrel!  
Aye---Theres' the Devil! But for that, the adven-  
ture would not be desperate. There would still be  
three of us--the redoubtable Tristram, the pussiant Ar-  
thur, and the all-conquering Cwrw: and what could stand  
before us?--Caer Gwrtheyrnion?--Pho! nor all the  
Cares in the universe. Why we shouldn't care for Pan-  
demonium itself. We'd storm old Belzebub in his  
grand keep; and make a rareeshow of all his family.  
Send us, ye Guardian Angels! send us but a costrel  
of Cwrw! of C-W-R-W. Fal de rol de rol, de ra ra,  
lol lol! ( *Sings* .)  
*A large cask rises out of the ground, against which  
Tristram runs his nose as he is reeling out* .  
Bawh! What have we here? Ho! ho! a cask! a  
cask.--The prayers of the drunken shall be heard; for  
they pray in The Spirit. But what is this?--Some magical  
inscription I suppose. O thou universal lamplightress,--  
thou that see'st many a thing that thy elder brother, the  
Sun, never dreamt of!--lend me thy spectacles awhile,  
that I may spell. C-W-R-W- Cwrw!!---Spell,  
indeed--What are your Runic Rhymes, your Riddles,  
your Pharmaceutrias--your Cabals, your Abracadaberas,  
to the magical combination of C--W--R--W? *(Sings* .  
  
Of spells you may talk,  
Writ in ink, blood, or chalk,  
With which Wizzard and Witch have to do;  
But each Welchman can tell  
That there never was spell  
Like C--W--R--W! Fal de rol. &c.  
  
With this spell, I'll be bound  
To make Nature spin round,  
As our boys with their whip-tops can do;  
And the world all so scurvy  
I'd turn topsyturvy  
With C--W--R--W. Fal de rol! &c.  
  
Inspir'd--Inspir'd! If it be but as potent to valour as  
to verse, the business is done.--And where's the doubt?  
What but Cwrw was it, that produced so many famous  
heroes of antiquity, from Nimrod to Jack the Giant  
Killer. ( *Sings* .)  
  
O, ye heroes renown'd  
Who fought all the world round--  
O! ye Cæsars, and fam'd Alexanders!  
Pray how had ye thriv'd,  
If of Cwrw depriv'd?  
Faith you'ad been just as valiant as ganders.  
Fal de rol! &c.  
  
If a second you want,  
Then, each foeman to daunt,  
Then, I'll tell you, my boy, what to do;  
Never fear to depend  
On the Welchman's best friend,  
On C--W--R--W. Fal de rol! &c.  
  
Bravo! bravo, little Tristram! One draught of this  
genuine water of the muses, and thou wilt eclipse all the  
Knights of the Round Table, and bear away the prize,  
in the bardic circles, from Taliessin himself. But how  
to get at it? Oh! A spile!---A spile!---I'll answer for  
it then it shall not be spoiled. ( *Pulls out the spile, and  
the ale begins to run* .) Genuine! genuine! entire! I'll  
be sworn. A choice drop out of the celestial cellar;  
brewed by my Guardian Angel for his own private  
drinking. Let me take it devoutly. ( *Kneeling* ) Now,  
now shall I be famous, or the devil is in it. ( *Drinks.  
The head of the cask flies off, out of which* Incubus  
*rises, and seizes him by the ears* .)  
*Inc* . Aye, and in it he is: little as you might expect it.  
( *The cask sinks down and leaves* Tristram *in the  
clutches of* Incubus.)  
*Trist* . ( *Shivering* .) Who-o-o who are you, and be-e  
hanged to you?  
*Inc* . A devil!  
*Trist.* The-e-e devil you are. Wha-a-at the devil  
makes my teeth chatter so then? In such hands, I should  
have expected to be frying in my own grease.  
*Inc* . Aye, that's because you don't know what sort of  
devil you have to deal with, my little Tristram. I am  
none of your bon-fire devils come to entertain you  
with squibs and crackers, and birth-day rockets and illu-  
minations: but a good thorough icicle devil, from the  
regions of Hela: where I have been freezing, under  
the North Pole, for more than half a century.  
*Trist* . Fre-e-e-ezing with a ve-e-e-engeance!  
Zounds I am fro-o-o-o-ozen too. I-i-i-i----can't  
get to my sw-o-o-o-ord.  
  
Ar-r-r r-Arthur!  
*Inc* . Vainly you for Arthur call:  
Your very words are frozen all:  
They shall never reach his ear.  
*Trist* . Ar-r-r-r Arthur! Arthur! co-o-o-ome away.  
I am lo-o-o-o-lost if yo-u-u-u delay.  
*Inc* . Trust me he shall never hear.  
Your words are frozen.  
*Trist* . So-o-o-o I-----fear.  
*Inc* . Thus upon my prey I seize.  
*Trist* . I freeze----I freeze----I freeze!  
Ar-r-r Arthur!---Ar-r-r Arthur.  
*Inc* . 'Tis in vain Your lungs you strain.  
*Trist* . I-i-i-i---I see it plain.  
*Inc* . Vassal hind! Your voice I bind--  
*Trist* . S o-o-o I find---  
*Inc* . In Vindsualer's icy chain  
*Trist* . W-w-w-w-wind! wind swallow!  
Cold and hollow!  
*Inc* . Grim Vindsualer! Winter's fire!  
*Trist* . Ar-r-r-r Arthur! Arthur! O-o-o-oh! a fire!  
*Inc* . 'Tis in vain; Fruitless pain; Thus to strain.  
Arthur, Arthur cannot hear.  
*Trist* . So-o-o-o-o I fear. *Inc* . It is clear.  
So, little Tristram? come you here.  
My potent mistress thus to please,  
Upon my shivering prey I seize!  
*Trist* . I fre-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-eze!  
*Cho. of Knights without* . We fre-e-e-e-e-e-eze!  
Tristram *sinks down in a state of torpor; over-  
powered by the benumbing influence of the Demon;  
and* Incubus *drags him off the stage.  
*  
*Re-enter* Arthur.  
  
Tristram! Tristram!--Art thou also gone?  
Vanish'd thro air? or swallow'd by the earth?  
The last of all my host! Infernal fiends!  
Are there no means to reach ye? Out good sword!  
Whose tenfold temper, steep'd in mystic dews  
By the fair regent of Savadan's lake,  
No goblin spell resists. On stocks and stones,  
And each ambiguous thing my eyes shall meet,  
I'll try its force. If chance some lurking fiend  
Start up reveal'd; ere now this arm, unstaid,  
Hath tam'd such foes, and to their hostile hell  
Dismiss'd them howling. Nerve it now, ye powers  
Who smile on virgin innocence. I strike  
In Nature's cause; for love and Guenever! \[ *Exit* .  
  
*SCENE III. Enter Fairies* .  
  
*1.Fa* . Sisters! Sisters! *2.Fa* . Whist ye! Whist!  
*1.Fa* . Tell me---tell me what ye list.  
*3.Fa* . Things of moment hover nigh.  
*1.Fa.* Who can read them. *2.Fa.* I. *3.Fa.* And I.  
*Cho* . Things of moment hover nigh.  
*1.Fa.* Sisters! Sisters! *2.Fa.* List ye! List!  
*3.Fa.* Tell me fairies what ye wist?  
*1.Fa.* Tell me what ye read on high?  
*2.Fa.* Fading stars, *3.Fa.* And morning nigh.  
*1.Fa.* Who can see it? *2.Fa.* I. *3.Fa.* And I.  
Cho. To the Grotto----haste away.  
4.Fa. You have seen it? *1.F.* Aye! 2.F. Aye! *3.F.* Aye!

*1.Fa.* Frisk it! *2.Fa.* Whisk it!  
*4.Fa.* Trip it! *1.F.* Whip it.  
*4.Fa.* To the Grotto---flit away!  
*Cho* . What we've witness'd there display. \[Exeunt.  
  
*SCENE IV. The Lake, seen in a new aspect. The Sun  
rising above the neighbouring mountains* .  
  
*Enter* Rowenna \[ *attended* .\]  
  
The shades of night disperse, and o'er the hills  
(The Eastern bound of Cambria) Balder's steed  
Rushes with reinless neck, and to the winds  
Gives his bright mane of orient, streaming far  
Thro the illumin'd sky. The dazzling ray,  
With tint reflective, over stream and lake,  
Plays with the morning breeze; and leaf and flow'r,  
Moist with the tears of evening, bend surcharg'd  
With mimic radiance: every crystal sphere  
Each with its fairy fun--a fairy world.  
Pencil'd with rays minute--as tho instinct  
'Tis splendour all, and gladness--All but here,  
Where one lov'd object, filling every thought,  
Blots out Creation. Sound nor sight can please,  
But what relates to Arthur: and this hope  
Of quick possession, from the Fatal maids,  
With poignant expectation but enflames  
The frenzy it should sooth.  
  
In vain empassion'd Hope I feed  
With promis'd boons of hovering joy:  
The expected bliss, by Fate decreed,  
Doubts and chilling fears annoy.  
  
In vain the empassion'd heart to ease,  
The splendid scences of morn I trace:  
Whate'er the raptur'd eye should please,  
Doubts and chilling fears deface.  
  
Distracting doubts, and chilling fears  
What touch of sense can charm away?  
A blank the smiling dawn appears:  
And mute to me the vernal lay.  
  
Propitious Goddess! hear my pray'r!  
Nor long the promis'd bliss delay:  
The smiling morn shall then be fair,  
And Rapture tune the vernal lay.  
  
Near to this spot, among the bordering woods--  
So sung the Fatal Sisters (and the song  
But now the oafish Incubus confirm'd)  
My Arthur roves, now isolate. O guide  
His steps, benignant Frea! that mine eyes  
May gaze to fulness, and my pleaded love  
Essay his secret heart. 'Tis heard. He comes:  
With what a tempest gathering on his brow!  
Yet lovely in his anger. We'll observe  
A while, unnoted, till the storm is spent:  
Then, o'er the waves subsiding, Love shall smile;  
And woo The Bird of Peace. \[ *They retire* .  
  
*Enter* Arthur.  
  
*Arth.* 'Tis fruitless search--  
I toil myself in vain. Enchantment here  
Dwells not--or dwells beyond the boasted reach  
Of gifted countercharm. And, lo! the Sun,  
Climbing his southering arch, with gilded smile,  
Mocks at my bootless rage; while grove and vale,  
Mountain, and headlong stream, and placid lake  
Shine in the record of my baffled hopes,  
My shame, and my distraction.  
*Row* . Queen of smiles!  
Who blend'st consenting hearts in mutual bliss,  
Be it my talk to sooth him,  
*Arth* . Ye twin heights  
Of bleak Farinioch!--Ye whose alpine heads  
Catch the first rays of Morning! I had hopes,  
Ere down your sloping sides encroaching light  
Had chac'd the lingering shadows, o'er your brow  
(Girt with my warrior knights in firm array)  
To have pour'd the shout of battle; on the walls  
Of doom'd Gwrtheyrnion, like the vollying cloud,  
To have burst in direful thunders; broke the chains  
Of Saxon usurpation; from the rape  
Of threaten'd incest snatch'd the weeping maid,  
And hung the wreaths of Love on Glory's fane.  
*Row* . Empire, and Love, and Glory! Frea, hear--  
Make them the three-fold dower, "When Authur's hand  
"Shall light the flame in which my woes expire!"  
I feel consenting Heav'n. Some whispered voice  
Tells me the prayer is heard:--perchance the maid  
Whom frequent The Propitious Goddess sends  
To cheer the love-lorn votary. ( *She comes forward* .)  
Arthur, hail!  
One not to Grief unknown your grief's would heal.  
*Arth* . ( *wrapt in soliloquy, and not observing her* .)  
Sweet bud of virgin innocence! shall he,  
The incestuous father, blast thy opening charms,  
And rifle thy pure fragrance? while mine arm  
(Awful in foriegn conflict) here, at home,  
Sinks palfied, and, in Love's,--in Nature's cause,  
Hangs powerless by my side!-------Oh Guenever!  
Soul of my soul!--Oh charms, above all charm!  
Trancendent in their loveliness! once deem'd  
My sole sequester'd treasure!--Paradise  
Of all my thoughts! and of my nightly dreams  
Sole visitant--when, pure as winnow'd snows,  
That from the peaky Vans, till spring matures,  
Gleam on the dazzled traveller, thou cam'st,  
With funny smiles of sanctity and love,  
Blessing my pillow'd slumber.---Guenever!  
Hope's vital fountain!--  
*Row* . ( *aside* ) Progeny of Lok!  
Does Fenrir howl this discord in mine ear?  
Or charnel Grymer bark?--What sounds are these?  
Where is thy promise, Frea?----Schulda, where  
Thy hopes oracular?  
*Arth* . Oh! Sweet of Sweets!  
Personified perfection!--tint! and form!  
And types of inward excellence! that shines  
Thro the transparent veil. Eyes! lips! and cheeks  
Vermeil'd with angel modesty! and swell  
Of soft ingenuous bosom, yet unsunn'd  
By Love's presumptuous gaze!--all Vortigerns?--  
Incestuous Vortigerns!  
*Row* . Can I bear this?  
Furies of Hela's shades! Ye Fiends of storm!  
What are your tempests to the tempest here?  
Are these my hopes? Down, down, my struggling soul,  
And trust The Fates. Be calm, or thou art lost.  
\[ *She retires* .  
*Arth* . With what a lengthen'd stride the lustful Sun  
Hastens the hour of horrors; towards the couch  
Of western Thetis straining, ere as yet  
The blush of parting from her orient cheek  
The winnowing winds have brush'd.  
Check, check thy speed!  
Restrain thy bridegroom haste: awhile forego  
The fiery track, 'till pitying heav'n afford  
Means of preventive vengeance: from the clouds  
That curtain thy repose, lest Hesper thrust  
His guilty lamp, to mark the fated hour,  
And light the tyrant Vortigern to deeds  
That make Hell tremble.  
  
Rowenna ( *re-entering, with* Edelthred, *at a*  
*distance* .) Passion shakes him still:  
But I am calm, in confidence renew'd,  
And wait predicted bliss.  
*Arth* . My pray'rs are vain.  
I war with woman's weapons: fall'n--reduc'd  
To woman's impotence: with senseless brawl  
Disturbing the calm elements, that laugh  
My rage to scorn. Come then, thou sullen Calm  
Of concious desperation, thro my soul  
Breathe thy narcotic influence--steep each nerve  
In opiate dews, and o'er each maddening sense,  
Bewilder'd, from their chilling urns pour forth  
Thy inanescent torpors, till no more  
Reflection wakes, and dull Oblivion drop  
The vail by Fancy lifted.  
*Row* . ( *aside* .) Be it so,  
Benignant Frea! then to other scenes,  
Joyous, awake reviving Consciousness,  
Made happy in the change!  
*Arthur* . Hear, hear them not--  
Hear not the shrieks, my soul, that, thro the gloom,  
Rending Gwrtheyrnion's towers, with vain appeal,  
Call on the name of Arthur.---Rest thou here,  
My wearied soul--rest here; even on this oak,  
Which, ere matur'd, the lightning's fork hath scath'd,  
Or Whirlwind's arm lopt brief:--here sit and muse  
In moralising vacancy, abridg'd  
Of vital virtue; like this sapless trunk,  
To lift no more the flourishing head to heaven,  
Or spread the arms of shelter.  
*Row* . Edelthred,  
The storm is past.--List how to murmurs soft,  
And wailings inarticulate, subsides  
The roaring surge of passion. Shall I speak;  
Or wait the heavings of these waves, that yet  
Would lash themselves to stilness?  
*Arth* . You, ye Pomps  
Of unavailing war--fire-plumed helm,  
And burnish'd shield emblazon'd; and thou gift  
Of her my sometime guardian, lie ye there,  
Till the slow rust consumes; or o'er your fame  
The monumental weed, with unshorn head,  
Bends vailing: for no more shall Arthur's arm,  
That fail'd to rescue Guenever, descend  
On dint of meaner argument to try  
Your charmed temper.  
  
*He throws away his helmet, his shield, and his en-  
chanted sword; and, seating himself in a disconsolate  
attitude, upon the shattered Oak, continues to pore upon  
the ground, in vacant agony.*  
  
*Row* . Past my best hopes!--  
Propitious Frea! now the webb untwines  
Spun by The Destinies. The magic sword  
Falls from his grasp, unconcious:--now no more  
From power of Runic verse, or magic spell,  
Or from Rowenna's charmed wand exempt.  
My Fates prevail. Agga! my rod--my rod!  
  
\[ *Enter* Agga, *with the wand* . Rowenna *waves it  
* *over the head of* Arthur; *and* he *sleeps* .\]  
Sleep on his troubled lids awhile descend,  
Till we the charm of Runic numbers end.  
  
Elves who shun the chilly moon!  
Demons of the sultry noon!  
*Response* Whose the voice that now ascends  
*of Spirits* The abodes of Alfheim?  
*Edel* . Hers who rends  
With spells the pitchy vail of Night--  
*Agg* . And blots the fetttled orbs of light.  
*Row* . Demons of the sultry noon!  
My call attend.  
*Resp.* Soon we greet thee--mistress, soon.  
*Row* . But not in gorgon pomp descend.  
*Edel* . Far hence, ye haggard forms of Fear!  
Horror, vail'd in mirky brow,  
Rage, that scorns the Pitying tear,  
Griefs, that low to Hertha bow.  
Other forms than these must move  
Soft content, Sweet content---  
Soft content and mutual love!  
*Resp* . Other forms than these shall move  
Soft content and mutual love.  
  
*Agg* . Haste in dimpled smiles array'd  
Such as sport in Frea's train,  
When she tempts the blushing maid,  
Half afraid, To the shade,  
Sighing, dying, where the swain  
Fears the promis'd bliss delay'd.  
*Resp* . Such the smiling forms that move  
Soft content, and mutual love.  
  
*Row* . Thus, to weave the mystic chain,  
Demons of the Noon repair:  
But to vulgar eyes remain  
Viewless as impassive air.  
  
*A troop of* Demons *rush on the stage, in the semblance  
of winged boys, crowned with wreaths of flowers, and  
arrayed in effeminate apparel.--Strings of roses in  
their hands; with which they link themselves together,  
in intricate circles, and dance round* Arthur *, as  
he sleeps. Others play with his armour, and one, of supe-  
rior size and appearance, takes possession of his sword.  
*  
*Row* . The charm of Runic numbers now complete--  
From Arthur's eyes ye drowsy fumes retreat.  
Awake to Joy--for every joy is here  
To charm the eye and sooth the listening ear.  
  
*Cho* . Joy sincere Hovers near;  
Wake to see; and wake to hear.  
  
*Arth* . What antic troop are ye, whose mid-day dreams  
Disturb a wretch's slumbers? Hence! Avaunt!  
  
*He endeavours to disentangle himself. They encircle him  
with their fillets, &c. Singing the following Glee.  
  
* Doughty hero! lay aside  
Sullen looks and martial pride:  
Love and Pleasure wait you here.  
Love and Pleasure,  
Without measure,  
Ope their treasure:  
Melting Love, and Joy sincere!  
*Cho* . Love and Pleasure revel here.  
  
*Arth* . My sword! My sword!  
  
*They laugh and dance around him; twining their fillets  
closer and closer: and repeating, in chorus.*  
  
Doughty hero! lay aside  
Sullen looks and martial pride:  
Love and Pleasure revel here.  
  
*Arth* . Distraction! Infamy! insnar'd! inthrall'd!  
Bound in a fillet, like some harlot's toy!  
This --only this, was wanting to complete  
My sum of wretchedness.  
*Row* . Of rapture say:  
For such I come to offer. Generous Arthur!  
Too long by an unworthy flame inthrall'd  
To an incestuous wanton: lo! my Charm  
Shall set you free: and on a worthier choice  
Empire and Love await, and deathless Fame.  
  
In the bosom of youth say what wishes can glow  
That my power cannot grant, or my favour bestow?  
These beauties that monarchs have struggled to gain,  
I offer unask'd.--Shall I offer in vain?  
No; heart with heart meeting, and clasp'd in these arms,  
Your bosom shall throb to soft passion's alarms.  
Heart to heart fondly beating!  
Our vows still repeating!  
Reclining! Resigning To passions alarms--  
Our bosoms still throbbing!--enfolding our arms!  
  
Then the sceptre of Britain, by Schulda decreed  
To await on my love, I present as thy meed.  
These beauties that monarches have struggled to gain,  
I offer thus dower'd.--Can I offer in vain?  
While thus, with heart meeting, I stretch forth my arms,  
Ambition and Beauty uniting their charms,  
Can your heart coldly beating,  
From Rapture retreating,  
Disdaining! Refraining From passions alarms,  
An Empire relinquish, and fly from these arms?  
Then my magic shall aid, and my verse shall record  
All the deathless exploits of your lance, and your sword;  
And the glory that heroes have struggled to gain  
I offer secure.--Shall I offer in vain?  
No; heart to heart beating, and clasp'd in these arms  
Love, Glory, and Empire shall mingle their charms.  
Heart to heart fondly beating!  
Our vows still repeating!  
Reclining! Resigning To passions alarms  
Our bosoms still throbbing!--enfolding our arms!  
  
*Arth* . Sorceress of Elb! devoted Britain's curse!  
Hence with thy wanton chant. Tho thus inthrall'd--  
Betray'd by Love's affliction (sentient there  
Beyond a maiden's softness) in these bonds  
Powerless I stand, yet can my soul disdain  
Thy blandish'd witcheries. A Crown from thee?  
Love, Glory, and Ambition! Are they things  
Of such abhor'd conjunction as to blend  
With thy pollutions?--I'd abjure them, then--  
Flee to some hermit's cave--unsex myself,  
And, in the mirkiest mine, drudge out, in toil  
Obscene, and servile bonds, the dregs of life  
Dishonour'd. For the World to Chaos runs--  
The blessed Sun no more his lustrous beam  
Sheds on created order, if such gifts  
Depend upon such givers.  
*Row* . Down my heart!--  
Injurious Arthur! even this from thee,  
Rowenna's love can pardon.  
*Arth* . Love!--Thy Love?  
The love of Vortigern's polluted wife?  
*Row* . The love of her who was, erewhile, the wife  
Of the polluted Vortigern. But crimes  
Like his dissolve the settled charities  
Of conjugal affiance.  
*Arth* . O! no doubt  
With Purity like thine. And he who (urg'd  
By lures, by incantations, and the bowl  
Spic'd with lascivious philters) made thee room  
For royal spousals in a murderer's bed--  
He who, seduc'd by thy idolatrous faith,  
Forgot the chaste affinities that link  
The social frame of Nature--  
*Row* .----Speak--Speak out.  
Why does thy struggling soul forbear to name  
What yet it dwells on most?--He whose vile lust  
Makes wanton revel in a daughter's arms--  
(The arms of Guenever!) deserves to pay  
The destin'd forfeit of his crime, and hers.  
*Arth* . His crime and Hers! Makes wanton revel! Hers?  
He has not sure-----------------  
*Row* . No sure. The diligent speed  
With which she scap'd his custody, what time  
(Dreadful Saxon slaughter) you pursu'd  
This father lover headlong thwart the realm,  
Proves with what fix'd abhorrence she regards  
His lawless love, and how prepar'd she stands  
To Act the virgin coyness she professes.  
*Arth* . Distraction! Furies!  
*Row* . What if now my art  
Should stretch thy vision thro intruding space--  
Rendering the opaque of matter to thy sight  
Pervious and clear (for so by spells I can,)  
And shew thee thy delusion--shew, reveal'd,  
Their present act! and in what amorous folds  
They wanton, shameless?  
*Arth* . Give me first my sword;  
Touch'd by whose virtue each delusive birth  
Of magic dies--abortive: elfe thy spell,  
Mocking the couzen'd senses, might betray,  
And damn me with illusion. Easier far  
To clothe some air-drawn phantom in the form  
Of her thy hate calumniates, than to pierce  
With stretch of human ken (however sharpen'd)  
Yon mountain's, peaky mass, that bars the fight  
Towards Gwrtheyrnion.  
Sorceress! dost thou blench  
The late-flushed cheek, and, with abated eye,  
Admit detection? Yes; thou stand'st reveal'd.  
Henceforth thy arts at lower quarry fly;  
Nor think to taint, with nechromantic frauds,  
The fame of Guenever, whose virtue towers,  
(Transcendent, like her beauty) far above  
Thy foul contaminations: like the orb  
That rules the tranquil night--lustrous and pure!--  
That on the wolfish howl of Calumny  
Smiles, and shines on, unalter'd.  
*Row* . Death to Hope!  
This constancy appals me: and my soul  
Scarce in The Fatal Sisters more confides,  
Or Frea's whisper'd promise. Yet remains  
One only effort. Bind him fast, ye elves,  
With your enchanted braids. His eyes shall see  
Within Gwrtheyrnion's walls--his ears shall hear  
What distant he regards not.  
Yes, by Hela! ( *aside* .)  
Charm-bound from voice or motion, he shall view  
The consummated rape; and his sick soul,  
Loathing what now he dotes on, shall resign  
To her predestin'd fate this hated she--  
This vaunted Paragon. Then, Vortigern,  
Thy Cup awaits thee; and my Arthur's hand  
Shall light the flame in which my woes expire.  
  
My Fate is in my hand.  
I feel my kindling passions move,  
Great with Vengeance, great with Love!  
Prophetic scenes of promis'd rapture rise;  
Doubts disperse, and hopes expand.  
Away with suppliant sighs!  
Hope returns: Dejection flies:  
I feel the kindling passions rise:  
My Fate is in my hand.  
  
*As they are binding* Arthur *, a symphony of soft mu-  
sic is heard from the lake.* The Lady *rises in her  
* Car. The Demons *drop the sword, &c. in great  
consternation; and dispersing, are seen flying thro the  
air, in their proper appearances of deformity; with a  
confused and fearful clamour.* Rowenna *and her  
* Attendants *run out on the opposite side.  
  
Lady* . Goblins avaunt! nor impious, thus profane  
My sylvan confines and irriguous reign.  
And thou, brave Prince! behold again restor'd  
Thy ravish'd freedom, and thy magic sword:  
For; not forgetful of my former love,  
Your griefs afflict me, and your dangers move.  
Your weak despair yourself will freely blame:  
Go,--force your pardon in the field of fame.  
Your Knights and Squires already marshall'd stand,  
By me redeem'd, and wait for your command.  
Refresh'd and vigorous from the genial right,  
They burn impatient, and demand the fight;  
Not far remote from yon embowering screen.  
My instant power shall waft you to the scene.  
  
*SCENE V. She waves her trident; and the SCENE instant-  
ly changes to a thicket at the foot of The Beacons* .  
  
The Knights of the Round Table *appear as  
just rising from their repast.--* Taliessin *and other  
* Bards *--playing on their harps. Horses ranged on  
each side of the stage, and the 'Squires holding them.  
-----Flourish.  
As the* Knights *perceive* Arthur *, they flock  
around him; and* Taliessin *sings the following  
Air--  
* Arthur comes, to Britain dear:  
Bid the brazen trumpets blow.  
Led by him, we cannot fear  
Civil rage or foreign foe.  
  
Chorus *of Bards and Knights* .  
  
Arthur hail! to Britain dear:  
Loud ye brazen trumpets blow.  
Led by Thee, we cannot fear  
Civil rage, or foreign foe. \[ *Flourish* .  
  
*Arth* . No thanks, my gallant comrades! 'Tis no time  
For verbiage now. We'll write our courtesies  
Deep on the foemen's backs. Gwrtheyrnion falls.  
My sword is out. The word is--Guenever.  
\[ *They draw* . *Flourish* .  
  
*Tal* . Let the streaming banner fly.  
Wave your flaming falchions high.  
Guenever, and Victory!  
  
*Cho* . See the streaming banner fly.  
See our falchions flaming high.  
Guenever, and Victory!  
  
*Lady* . Go, friends of Virtue, Honour, Justice, Love!  
Confirm your glory, and your worth approve.  
To higher powers I now resign my care,  
Then seek my sparry Grot and coral Chair.  
Thee--fire-eye'd Seraph!--thee,  
That, on thy saphir throne,  
Among The Spheres,  
With ever-wakeful ministry,  
Brac'd in adamantine zone,  
Mak'st sea-girt Albion's cause thy own--  
Thee, whom the Warrior Host reveres!  
Thee, whom the bleeding Battle fears!  
On thee I call.  
As oft thy guardian care hath spread  
The shield of safety o'er the Patriot's head,  
Bidding the iron tempest vainly fall,  
Propitious now on Arthur smile,  
And guard the warrior boast of Britain's isle.  
From Foes uplifted mace, and Treason's secret thrall.  
*Cho* . Thee! whom the warrior host reveres--  
Thee! whom the bleeding Battle fears--  
On thee we call!  
  
*Tal* . Spread the fervour--spread the song,  
Spread the martial flame along,  
Rush to fight with loud acclaim;  
Warm'd by that Seraphic Power  
Who, high-enthron'd in empyrean bower,  
Watchful for Albion, joys to wield  
The sword of flame;  
And the adamantine shield,  
Amid'st the direful conflict, spreads  
O'er the consecrated heads  
Of chiefs devote to patriot fame.  
*Chorus* . Spread the fervour--spread the song--  
Spread the martial flame along.  
  
*Ar* . Sound drums and trumpets.--Bid the martial fife  
Pierce the charm'd ear of Valour. Sound the charge.  
The cause is Freedom, Love, and Guenever!  
  
*Chorus* . Wave the falchion--couch the spear--  
Blow the brazen trumpet, blow.--  
Arthur leads: we cannot fear  
Civil rage, or foreign foe.  
  
*The* Lady of the Lake *descends, while* The  
Knights *march across the stage in order of attack,  
amidst a flourish of martial instruments* .  
  
End of the Second Act  
  
  
*ACT III. SCENE I.  
*  
*The inside of the Castle Gwrtheyrnion. Several servants  
cross the stage; bearing boughs and strings of flowers,  
dishes, Goblets, &c. as in preparation for a sumptuous  
banquet* .  
*Enter* Tristram *and* Scout.  
*Trist* . Well, here we are, Scout, sound wind and  
limb, within the Castle. Our adventure begins under  
most happy auspices. Our tale of desertion passes  
muster, without suspicion. Our proffered assistance  
seems to be very acceptable: and these preparations be-  
token no meagre reception. One would think we had  
followed the heel of Victory, rather than trod on the  
toe of approaching Action.  
*Scout* . Toe! brother Tristram! why 'tis the very  
corn we have trod on, to tell my mind o' the matter.  
Would we were well thro with it. It is a project big  
with dangers.  
*Trist* . Big with water, like a dropsy, you well-hunter!  
You swill your coward Fears with the draught of Tem-  
perance, as you call it, till every kilderkin of apprehen-  
sion becomes a butt; while I, with more inebriate wis-  
dom, never fee dangers, but by reflection, on the out-  
side of a goblet, or at the bottom of a well polished  
tankard; where the convexity of the medium diminishes  
their proportions and shrinks them into insignificance.  
But away to your task. There is no time to lose.  
And as Providence has blest thee with a fine lying face of  
thy own, honour thy creator by making the most of it.  
*Scout* . Never fear me. Remember but your own  
part as stoutly.  
*Trist* . Mine. Pho! my memory is on the edge of  
my sword:--keen and durable. Do you but lie and  
wriggle and intrigue through the first part of the busi-  
ness--if I do not fight thro the other, may I never be  
drunk again with the 'Squires of the Round Table. So  
away to your quirks and your quibbles, and contrive to  
give the princess Guenever an item of what is in agitation.  
Remember--the lone tower is the place. You will find  
my Sword and me at the draw bridge, at the time ap-  
pointed. \[ *Exit* Scout.  
In the mean time, as I am no dab at intrigue, I will  
endeavour to kill time, till the time of killing arrives,  
with some fool's sport among these scullions. \[ *Exit* .  
  
  
*SCENE II. The Servants, &c. still continue crossing  
the Stage.  
  
Enter* Rowenna, *musing* .  
  
"When the bowl again goes round,  
"And Vortigern his sleep profound  
"Heedless quaffs!"--  
O! impotence of memory! to o'erlook  
The fated sign, and, with disordered speed,  
Anticipate my destinies! For this  
My Gods forsake me: to the adverse power  
Of dull Savadan's elfin regent elfe  
Not obvious. But with happier omens now,  
And preordain'd progression, I advance  
The twofold work of Fate. Why aye--proceed  
Ye menial herd--Mechanic instruments--  
Unconcious pivots in the state machine  
With which the powerful work!--prepare the feast--  
Dress up the joyous hall, with boughs, and braids  
Of flaunting fragrance--hung be every feat  
With sweets coronal; and the banquet heap  
To feign'd Conciliation: nor suspect  
What Fate and I determine. Vortigern!  
Now feed thy soul voluptuous. Haste--prepare  
To revel out thy last: for, even now,  
The bowl is pregnant; and the ambrosial draught  
Teems with thy fate matur'd. Soon--soon he quaffs--  
Quaffs his last sleep profound. Then comes the crown  
Of all my feverish hopes; and Arthur's hand  
Lights up the flame in which my woes expire.  
  
But, lo! the Banquet waits. I go to greet  
At once the nuptial, and funereal treat.  
Yet, ere on Frea's name I dare to call,  
Descend ye handmaids of the shield-roof'd hall.  
  
Sisters three, in fearful state,  
Who at Valhalla's banquet wait,  
Watching the nod  
Of him, supreme, The Warrior God,  
Who, midst the genial rite,  
While blithe the amber goblet circles round,  
Thro you, inflicts the destin'd wound,  
And thins the ranks of fight!--  
On you, who wait by Woden's side,  
(The dastard's dread, the warrior's pride)  
I call--  
To hover round Gwrtheyrnion's hall,  
And o'er the funeral--nuptial feast preside. \[ *Exit* .  
  
  
*SCENE III* . *Enter* Tristram, *armed with sword and  
Target; The* Seneschal, *and a* Sewer.  
  
*Trist* . And so we are to have feasting before fighting?  
master Seneschal!  
*Seneschal* . Aye--and good reasons there be, master  
Newcomer.  
*Trist* . Aye--I hope the Raisins are good, master  
Seneschal, or they will make an ill part of the desert.  
But, for reasons less eatable, which be they?  
*Sen* . They be three in number, master Newcomer.  
*Trist* . Hem!--Three!--But three is a favourite  
number, I believe, among you Scandinavians.  
*Sen* . True, master Newcomer--and for good reason.  
It is mystical and sacred. For example--there be three  
sons of Beör (Woden, Vile, and Ve) who knock'd the  
giant Ymer o' the head, created the world out of his  
carcase, and set his brains a flying thro the air for clouds.  
*Trist* . Hum!--A hum! I can smell it. ( *Aside* .)--  
A pretty piece of flesh, at this rate, your Ymer must  
have been, master Seneschal.--And yet, upon second  
thoughts, he was but a moody, muddy, addle-headed  
sort of a giant, either; or his brains could not have  
been converted to such a use.  
*Sen* . Then there be three Fatal Sisters.  
*Trist* . Aye--three Witches, as one might say, master  
Seneschal! the eldest of which, by the way, is no  
Witch, i'my way of thinking; for she only fortells  
what is past: carrying her eyes behind her, as it were.  
Strait forward she cannot see so far as her nose. And,  
as for the second, (by your account of her) she has no  
more foresight than a hare: and yet, she seems more in-  
debted to her eyes than her understanding for her repu-  
tation in the world. Her glances go, bolt shot, in all di-  
rections, thro all impediments of space and matter: like  
a lance thro a battered buckler. She can see all the ble-  
mishes that a maid hides with her mantle, or a batchelor  
under his gabardine, as plain as a carbuncle on a nose  
of four inches; but as for how long the batchelor shall re-  
main a batchelor, or the maid a maid, master Seneschal!--  
*Sen* . Why for that, master Newcomer, she refers you  
to her younger sister. And this, by the way, brings me,  
pat, to three other Sisters, of a very different description,  
(not but they, also, have something to do with our des-  
tinies, master Newcomer!) I mean the three smirking  
damsels, that wait on The Propitious Goddess, to whom  
the aforesaid maids and batchelors offer up their vows,  
when they wish to be maids and batchelors no longer.  
And then there be three Giants of Frost; three War-  
hounds, that guard the Gates of Hela; and three Valky-  
ries, that wait on the banquet of Woden, in Valhalla.  
*Sewer* . Very true, master Seneschal: but what has  
all this to do with the reasons for our banquet?  
*Sen* . Why much, master Sewer:--much.  
*Trist* . Aye, very much, master Sewer: for a Ban-  
quet is a Banquet, whether in Valhalla or Gwrtheyrnion:  
Is it not? master Seneschal! There's affinity, for you,  
imprimus. Then, in the second place--for we can find  
three affinities, or similitudes, in this case, also--Can we  
not? master Seneschal!--In the second place, a full sto-  
mach is better than an empty one, in Gwrtheyrnion as well  
as in Valhalla--Is it not, master Seneschal? There's af-  
finity for you, again, or the devil's in it. And then, in  
the third place, (which brings us to our point;) there are  
three reasons for the banquet, in one place, as well as the  
other--videlicit--there be victuals to eat--there be people  
to eat them--and there is a place in which they may be  
eaten. Which, also, may in three diverse ways be  
stated--to wit, Imprimus, The passivity, or the victuals  
eatable--the locality, or the place of eating--and the  
agency, or the persons to eat. Secundo, The prompti-  
tude, or or desire of eating--the aptitude, or convenience  
of a place to eat in--and the plentitude, or abundance  
of things eatable. Tertio, Yearning of the bowels, or  
the hungering after--temptation to the eye, or the pre-  
sence of the things whereafter we hunger--and ministra-  
tion copulative; or the tables and benches, in the great  
hall; whereby the parties are enabled to approximate, the  
come-at-ability of the desired is facilitated, and the desirers  
are fundamentally accommodated.  
*Sen* . Right! right! master Newcomer! Truly, for  
all thou beest a Welchman, and I a Saxon, I desire thy  
further acquaintance; for thou seemest learned in these  
matters, and of an excellent wit.  
*Sew* . Why now, by your leave, master Seneschal, all  
these be good reasons for banqueting at all times--but  
they be no reasons for banqueting before battle.  
*Sen* . Short--short, master Sewer. If they be good  
reasons for banqueting at all times, then be they good  
reasons for banqueting before, as well as after.  
*Sew* . Aye; but the specific, master Seneschal! the  
specific.  
*Trist* . Why the specifics be three, also, master Sewer.  
Imprimus--there is fish to be eaten; and they are best  
to be eaten fresh--Secundo, fighting is hard work; and  
good eating and drinking minister to strength--Tertio, it  
is thought best to eat first, lest a part of the guests should  
get their bellies so full of fighting, as to have no appetite  
left for any thing else.  
*Sen* . And, if these tripple reasons satisfy not the tender  
conscience, there is yet behind, a reason omnipotent,  
which is one and indivisible, namely, that The Fates  
would have it so.  
*Trist* . The Fates! How so? master Seneschal.  
*Sen* . Why, to tell you a secret--our mistress has been  
making a journey into hell.  
*Trist* . ( *aside* .) Aye, aye, to bespeak apartments I sup-  
pose.--Hum!  
*Sen* . And, as she reports it, The Fatal Sisters or-  
dered this banquet.  
*Trist* . Did they so? Faith I shall have a better opi-  
nion of them, for the future, than I used to have.  
*Sew* . Aye, and so shall I. Od zookers! I cared not  
if our Mistress went to hell every day, at this rate.  
*Sen* . It is necessary, it seems, that the reconciliation be-  
tween her and the King should be thus celebrated; and  
that, in token of their re-union, she should present him  
with a Cup of her own mixing; as she did at their first  
meeting; and then all is to go well.  
*Sew* . Good! master Seneschal. And yet our priests  
will have it that it is not orthodox: because, in Valhalla,  
Woden and his Monoheroes always fight first, and ban-  
quet afterwards.  
*Trist* . Aye, aye!--they want one half of us to get  
a quietus before the banquet, that there may be a double  
share of the baked and boiled for them. But as for  
those Monoheroes, I have a song about them: and, if the  
harpers and trumpeters will bear me out with an accom-  
paniment, I care not if I sing it to you.  
  
O! your joys of Valhalla to me they are all mere  
Greek, Sirs,  
Where you fight till you are kill'd--  
\[Kill'd?--well: and what of that? If it were but once,  
and away, one would not mind it--(&c. &c. *ad  
libitum* .) But there--why  
There you're kill'd and kill'd again, every day of the  
Week, Sirs!  
And after that, you get so drunk that you scarcely can  
speak, Sirs!  
And these are the joys of Valhalla!  
  
There ten-hundred-times ten-thousand, Sirs, as I am  
a sinner,  
Hack, and hew, and thrust, for fun--  
\[O very pretty fun, to be sure--Here a leg, and  
there an arm; and there a little scratch; just thro  
the scull to the chin; and there a head off, whisp!  
--(&c. &c.) for thus  
They hack, and hew, and thrust, for fun; and both  
the loser and the winner  
Are cut up just like pork, ere they set them down  
to dinner.  
These, these are the joys of Valhalla!  
  
Then for knives they use their swords, and for forks  
they use their lances,  
And their shields are turned to platters--  
\[Aye, leave them alone for good spacious trenchers.  
Their hacking and hewing, and cutting and thrust-  
ing, get them a good appetite, I'll warrant--A  
chine of beef, a goose, and a turkey, are nothing  
under a Monohero's doublet--and so  
  
Their shields are turn'd to platters; and a thousand  
such like fancies,  
And a Death's head, for a goblet, their drink very much  
enhances.  
These, these are the joys of Valhalla!  
  
Now your eating I have some, and your drinking  
much delight in;  
And I've no great objection to your tilting and  
your fighting---  
\[No, it shall be seen, by-and-by, that, sword and  
target, cut and thrust, hack and hew, here a  
head, and there a limb, (&c. &c.) little Tristram  
will play his part with the best of you:  
  
For I've no great objection to your tilting and your  
fighting;  
But as to getting drunk after being kill'd,--  
Why, that I think, they're not right in.  
Altho 'tis the joy of Valhalla!  
  
Then their *modus bibendi* , to me, it is mightily  
droll, Sirs--  
And the scull of a foe, is a very strange sort of a  
wassail-bowl, Sirs--  
\[O, lud! I'm all in the horrors to think of it.  
Who the devil could set himself soberly to work  
to get drunk, with a death's head in his hand? Be-  
sides how the devil do they manage it?  
  
For the scull of a foe is such a very strange sort of a  
bowl, Sirs,  
That I am very sure I should spill--out at either  
eye-hole, Sirs,  
Ere it got to my mouth in Valhalla!  
  
Then give me still a banquet of your mere mortal cooking--  
  
\[Nay, no cooking at all--Radishes and raw turnips;  
an apple, and an onion--or a good Welch leek  
(&c. &c.) in a thatched cottage, rather than chines  
and turkies, in your Hall of Shields--  
  
Yes, give me still a dinner of such plain vulgar cooking;  
And ere ale in a scull, I'll drink Adam's ale the brooke in:  
And, if there's any other heaven I can find a fly nook in,  
I'll be damn'd if I'll go to Valhalla!  
\[ *Exeunt* .  
  
*SCENE IV. A confused and tumultuous noise within.  
Shrieks, and a cry for help.--A deep groan is heard.  
Enter several* guests *and* servants, *flying, to and fro,  
across the stage, in terror and astonishment.  
Dirgeful music, from the Harps, within.*  
  
*Enter* Rowenna, *in a great agitation.* Edelthred.  
Agga, &c. *following* .  
  
*Row* . 'Tis done!--'Tis done!--The charm is bound:  
Vortigern his sleep profound  
Has quaft. ( *A groan within.* )  
He dies! ( *a groan.* ) He dies! ( *a groan* .) He dies!  
For this below ( *with half-thaw'd eyes* )  
Icy Hela, shouting, laught. ( *Groan again* .)  
He dies! He dies!  
To the Nine-fold Realm he hies--  
Misty region!--cold, and dark!  
Hark!-----  
Grymer leads the tripple growl.  
Now they open. Now they howl. ( *Barking below* .)  
Hark! ( *Barking* ) Hark! ( *Barking* ) Hark!  
Loud the ravening hell-dogs bark.  
Fenrir shakes his chains below:  
They yell!--the Giant Sons of Woe!--  
And wide the creeking portals throw.  
Hark!-----  
Clank of chains, and growl, and bark----  
Hideous discord! ( *Clank of chains* ) Hark! ( *A deep  
growl* ) Hark! ( *barking* ) Hark!-----  
*Ed. Ag. &c* . Hideous discord! Hark! hark! hark!  
  
*Accompaniments of barking, howling, &c. Then, a  
solemn pause; and a sudden transition to soft and me-  
lancholy music; principally of Harps and Flutes.  
The* body of Vortigern *is carried across the stage,  
accompanied by* Courtiers, Domestics, Sol-  
diers, &c. &c. *while* the Bards *sing the follow-  
in dirge.  
  
* Mourn, Britons, mourn the mighty fall'n:  
The sceptred hand is cold.  
The imperial brow in dust lies low,  
By sudden Fate controll'd  
Mourn, Britons, mourn the mighty fall'n:  
The sceptred hand is cold!  
\[ *Exeunt with the Body* .  
  
Rowenna ( *after a pause* .)  
Why should this moody dirge, these solemn sounds  
Of grief-full mockery, and this apish train,  
That mourn but by contagion from the harps  
Of hireling choristers, infect my eyes,  
Or chill my veins with horror?--Up! to arms,  
Ye firm Resolves! and fortify my soul  
Against invading Conscience. True, he sleeps--  
Sleeps with the dead!--my some-time plighted lord--  
By me, he sleeps his death. But Fate's, not mine,  
Is all the guilt--if guilt. The Fates decreed,  
And I but did their biddings.--But a wife?---  
A wife!--Away: I never was the wife  
Of such a thing as Vortigern. My soul  
(That scorns affiance with the low and vile)  
Wedded not him, but Empire; and to that  
I still am true and loyal: making way,  
By this predestin'd act, for happier rule,  
And a more worthy master. Arthur's hand  
Shall heal thy griefs, and mine--Heav'n-favour'd Isle!  
And congregated Britain bless the deed.  
  
Join, then, the chaunt to Frea. Frea now,  
Propitious Goddess! may accept the vow;  
To her, and Gna, swell soft the melting strains--  
For theirs what yet of destiny remains.  
  
Queen of Pleasures! Queen of Smiles!  
Goddess of resistless wiles,  
And Love's extatic glow!  
Thou, who, erst, the golden tear  
Shed'st o'er Balder's early bier,  
And felt'st the touch of tender woe--  
Propitious Goddess! hear.  
*Ed.Ag.&c* . Queen of Love's extatic glow--  
Propitious Goddess! hear.  
  
*Row* . O! send the herald of thy will,  
The throbbings of the heart to still,  
And whisper Peace and Love!  
The imperfect work of Fate complete,  
Till sigh with sigh, responsive, meet:  
O! first of genial powers above!  
Propitious Goddess! hear.  
*Ed. Ag. &c* . First of genial powers above!  
Propitious Goddess! hear.  
  
*Trumpets, without, and a cry of* The foe! The foe!  
Alwin *enters, with great precipitation* .  
  
*Alw* . Most noble Queen! Arthur has gain'd the heights.  
His trumpet sounds defiance at our gates;  
And down the steep, to this our mid-way strand,  
His shouting legion pours: their banner'd vans  
Chiding, with fluttering speed, the buoyant air;  
Like wings of eagles, when they downward rush  
To pounce their shrieking prey.  
*Row* . Hang out the flag  
Of friendly parley. This is welcome news.  
The tyrant's death makes way for gentler warfare--  
More mild arbitriment than flings and darts:  
And this shall first be tried.  
  
*Enter a second* Messenger.  
  
*Messenger* . Revolt! revolt!  
Treason is in our walls; a treacherous band  
Of lawless Britons, headed by the twain,  
Who, with their proffer'd service, late arriv'd,  
Have borne the Princess to the lonely tower,  
By sudden inroad seiz'd, and now maintain'd  
In Arthur's hostile name.  
*Row* . ( *eagerly* .) The lonely tower?  
*Mes* . The same that, circled by the deep-delv'd moat,  
Stands insulated: less by tactic art,  
Than by the never-ceasing spring, that laves  
Its circular base, defended.  
*Row* . Fire the bridge!--  
This news is welcome too. My fates prevail!  
No weapons use but fire.--Propitious powers!  
Ye faithful Fatal Sisters!--Shaft and fling  
Were sacrilegious here; were impotent.  
Fire, fire, I say. The first that brings me word  
The turrets flame (be he the meanest drudge  
That ever pioneer'd before a host)  
Shall rank, for wealth and power, with Woden's line.  
*Exeunt* Alw. *and* Mes.  
Yes!----"My rival to confound,  
"Fire and water shall surround--  
"Ruthless flames, and waves profound!"  
  
Sweet Hope my heart beguiles:  
My bosom swells--my pulse beat high;  
And softer heaves the fluttering sigh.  
Propitious Frea smiles! *Exeunt* .  
  
*SCENE V. The outside of the Castle, situated half way  
up the Beacons; at that part now occupied by the Lake  
back ground. The Keep, or round Tower, appears  
detached from the rest of the fortification; and sur-  
rounded by a wide moat. The drawbridge, between it  
and the Castle is drawn up; and* Tristram *and  
* Guenever *are seen upon the Walls. The other  
parts of the Castle are, also, defended by a moat; the  
drawbridge being up. A perpetual shower of fire-  
brands is discharged, from the Castle, upon the Keep.  
  
Tristram* ( *hurling back the brands, as they are thrown* .)  
Fire for your fire, ye Salamanders! if that's your game.  
But here comes one will fire you prettily; I'll warrant.  
  
*Trumpet-chorus of* Bards *and* Knights, *as* Arthur,  
*and his Train are entering.*  
  
Trumpets sounding, falchions flaming!  
Rush, ye chiefs to glorious fight:  
Fame, the while, your worth proclaiming---  
  
*Arth* . Destraction!--See upon the keep (surpris'd  
By Tristram's politic valour, to secure,  
During our fierce assault, from chance of war,  
Or worse internal treason, the fair prize  
Of all our sleepless perils) what fierce shower  
Of hellish engin'ry, incessant, hails,  
Threat'ning a fate of horrors. Sound the trump--  
The trump of parley.---Guenever!  
  
*Guenever* . Oh! heav'n!  
Arthur! my lord! my hero!--in thy fight---  
O! cruel destiny!  
*Arth* . The trumpet sound. \[ *A parley sounded* .  
If maid, or child, or matron they would save  
From retributive vengeance, let them cease  
This war of fire;  
  
(Rowenna, *attended by* Alwin, *and several* Saxon  
*and* British Nobles, &c. *appears on the walls* .)  
or, by the Eternal Truth,  
Whom my soul worships! soon Gwrtheyrnion's walls,  
Prostrate on earth, shall form one common tomb  
For every Saxon thing that breathes within;  
And these my gallant knights, horribly smear'd  
With your idolatrous blood, shall, o'er the heap  
Of mingled wreck and carnage, wave their swords,  
And shout "Extermination!"  
*Row* . Angry prince!  
Why to our flag of conference answer you  
With such ungentle outrage? Were we bent  
On hostile fury, we have means within  
To battle this gay phalanx; tho renown'd,  
(As frankly we admit) for warlike deeds,  
Thro all the peopled earth. But, in our hears,  
The touch humane of cordial sympathy  
Is now more vital than revengeful wrath  
And national aversions; which too long  
Have thin'd our rival tribes. Therefore we arm  
Our tongues with gentle courtesies, not hands  
With weapons of destruction; and invite  
To equal brotherhood your warrior Knights--  
Yourself, to equal empire.  
*Arth* . Empire, shar'd  
With Vortigern and thee?  
*Row* . That Vortigern  
No more presents a barrier to the hopes  
Of Anglia and of Britain; cold he lies  
Beneath the fresh-laid turf; and, with his sleep,  
The bleeding realm is pacified.  
*Arth* . How?---How?---  
Did I then prophecy? Most murderous fiend!  
Thy husband, and thy sovereign!  
*Row* . Why on me  
(Injurious!) charge the sure decrees of Fate?  
*Arth* . Fate, that would deal in murders and in crimes,  
Shall never want (while thou infest'st the earth)  
A ready instrument. No more. Break off  
The impious parle. The martial chorus raise;  
And let our battering enginery upheap,  
Of these polluted stones, a monument  
To Britain's murder'd King: foul tho he were,  
Of these, not meriting so foul an end.  
  
*Cho* . Trumpets sounding, falchions flaming,  
Rush, ye Chiefs, to glorious fight---  
  
A Briton ( *from the Walls* .)  
A while forbear!--For what do we contend?  
For what deform the enamell'd turf of peace  
With our unnatural slaughters? Arthur, hear--  
Rowenna, and the undisputed crown  
Of Britain and the auxilliar tribes of Elb,  
Are thine, without a crime.  
*Arth* . Without a crime,  
Vile Briton!--This from thee, whose King, even now  
(Your own elected King!) in death lies low  
By her abhor'd contrivance!--Without crime?  
Is it no crime to league with Murder, then--  
Domestic Murder, Witchcraft, and the rage  
Of foul adultrous Lust, and all the swarm  
Of most abhor'd pollutions, that combine  
In her detested nature, and infect  
The very air she breathes in?--making all  
That come within thy atmosphere of crimes,  
As hateful as thyself--thou, World of Sins!  
Guilt's fair, yet foul epitome!  
*Row* . Ye Gods  
Of Asgard and of Niflheim! is it thus  
Ye cheat my hopes?  
Yet, fair! He owns me fair!  
That's something. And, perchance, when yonder witch  
No more with philtering charms can drug the sense,  
I may seem fair alone; and, rivalry  
No more obtruding, the impassion'd touch  
Of Nature's strong propension may subdue  
This pride of ethic reason. The loos'd eye  
Of youthful appetite, that, 'mong the forms  
Of soft obstrusive beauty, somewhere must  
Dwell with more ardent gaze, from mine, perchance,  
May catch contagious fire; and Arthur yet  
Light up the flame in which my woes expire. ( *Aside* .)  
Why cease the brands, ye tardy ministers  
Of our imperial mandate? Who again,  
(Command who will) till yonder turrets flame,  
Does in the fiery warfare but relax,  
The pains of Treason wait him.  
( *The assault on the Keep is renewed* .)  
Arthur ( *who, during the foregoing soliloquy, had  
conversed with* Guenever, *across the moat, in  
dumb show* .) Quick---repeal  
That hideous mandate; or, by utmost hell,  
Whate'er of torment human wit can frame--  
Whate'er of ignominy (torturous more  
To thy imperious spirit) shall avenge  
The damned deed.  
What? ha! No respite? Fiends!  
Sound--sound the trumpet. Peal the assailing hymn,  
Ye bards, and rush to combat. ( *The assault begins* ).  
  
*Chorus* . Trumpets sounding, falchions flaming,  
Rush, ye chiefs! to glorious fight:  
Fame, the while, your worth proclaiming,  
Thro the nations wings her flight.  
Rush to conquest! rush to glory!  
Like the brave of ancient story.  
Trumpets sounding, falchions flaming,  
Rush to conquest--rush to glory!  
  
*The* Bards *join in the conflict. The drawbridge of the  
Castle falls; and that of the Keep, together with the  
Keep itself, is fired, at the same time. Shouts and  
flourish, as of triumph, from both parties.  
  
* *Arth* . The drawbridge falls. Assail! assail the gates.  
Distraction!--Guenever!  
*Guenever* . Oh, Arthur! Arthur!  
They reach--they scorch me. O, the flames! the flames!  
*Arth* . My arm avails not. Conquest is in vain!  
Distraction! vengeance!--O, some vast revenge!  
Some mighty ruin!--that the world might crack,  
And Universal Nature, with her wreck,  
Hood yon devouring flames!  
*Row* . The Phoenix burns!  
And, from the odorous ruin, mine the love,  
With renovated wing, shall soar aloft,  
Gorgeous in natal triumph.-----'Tis complete. ( *Aside* .)  
  
Schulda, thanks! The charm is bound.  
Now, my rival to confound,  
Fire and water both surround.  
  
Arthur's arm no help shall lend,  
No mortal power the Maid befriend,  
Nor aid from pitying heaven descend.  
  
Schulda thanks! My doubts retire.  
Arthur soon shall light the fire  
In which my sorrows all expire.  
  
*Arth* . A brand! A brand! Hell-hag--thy prophecy  
(Whatever juggling demon gave it shape)  
Soon I fulfil. Tristram, a brand! a brand!  
  
Tristram *throws several brands to* Arthur *and  
the* Knights: Rowenna *starts, with a terrific  
shriek, as they seize, and brandish them on high.*  
  
*Row* . Furies of Hela's shades! Is this the flame?  
*Arth* . Oh! Guenever! thus at thy funeral pyre,  
I offer up thy hecatombs. Come on,  
If not for preservation, we are arm'd  
At least for vengeance. Hell-hag! thus I light  
The fated flame in which thy woes expire.  
  
*He fires the Gates; and presently the whole castle ap  
pears to be in flames, in the midst of which* Rowenna  
*and her partizans sink. In the mean time, the flames  
make a more feeble progress in the Keep; where  
* Guenever *and* Tristram *stand* .  
  
Air *and* chorus *of unseen Spirts* .  
She shrieks!--She dies!--Our mistress dies!  
Spirits--Spirits!--haste away:  
Scatter thro the lurid skies.  
Asi's Gods in pow'r decay.  
Demon Gods confess, with fear,  
Their fated twilight hovering near.  
  
*Ar* . Vengeance! thy dues are paid. But Love! O, Love!  
Hast thou no interest at The Mercy Seat?--  
Nor suffering Innocence?-------My Guenever!  
( *She disappears and* Tristram *follows* .)  
Oh! torment!---torment! Thus, before mine eyes!--  
Not even the wretched privilege resev'd  
To perish with her--in one dear embrace  
Forget the searching fury of the flames,  
And mix our wedded ashes! Might one not,  
Of desperate resolution, make a bridge  
Enough substantial for a lover's weight,  
Buoy'd by such dire extremity? At least,  
We'll try the hazard. Ho! for Guenever!  
  
\[ *He runs towards the moat, which he is about to leap;  
when suddenly the whole pile of building, Castle and  
Keep together, and all the ground they occupied, sink  
down. The space becomes filled by a pool of Water.  
In the place where the round tower stood,* The Lady  
of the Lake *appears in her chariot, with* Guen-  
ever *seated by her side, and* Tristram *behind* .  
*The Chariot and, &c approaches the shore.* Scout *comes  
swimming after.* Arthur *and* Guenever *rush into  
each other's arms.  
Arth* . All-gracious powers!  
*Guen* . My hero!  
*Arth* . O! My Love!  
*Trist* . ( *springing upon land* ) Huzza! Huzza! Didn't  
I tell you little Tristram would fight his way thro it.  
If there was no help from Heaven above, or the Earth  
beneath, there was some in the Waters that are under  
the earth, my blinking prophetess!  
Why, how now, Scout?--What, my amphibious! my  
water-spaniel! You've had enough of the draught of tem-  
perance, I hope. This comes of your fears and pre-  
cautions. If you had drank valiant Cwrw, as I do, and  
stood, to the last, at the post of danger--why you had  
arrived on Terra Firma, with dry breeches, my boy.  
*Arth* . And is it realis'd?--And art thou safe?--  
Safe and unhurt, from those devouring flames  
That threaten'd thy chaste beauties?  
*Guen* . Free! Unhurt!--  
Save in thy frantic terrors!--There I bleed--  
Here--in this storm-rent bosom. ( *Laying her hand upon  
his heart* .) *Arth* . 'Tis at rest:  
If blessedness be rest.-- O, sacred power  
Of flame-defying Chastity!--And thou! ( *To the Fairy* .  
*Lady* . See, Arthur, see! to crown your matchless worth,  
Nature relents, and miracles have birth,  
The tribute spring that wont its course to take,  
Thro secret veins, to feed my broader Lake,  
A lake itself now spreads at my command,  
And long, an emblem of your Fame, shall stand,  
An alpine wonder in the Cambrian land.  
Meantime accept, from two-fold dangers freed,  
This beauteous maid, your Valour's noblest meed.  
  
Beauty, Truth, and Innocence,  
Sweetly blending all their charms,  
Valour's guerdon, I dispense:  
Take them, Hero, to thy arms.  
Virtue with such Graces blending,  
'Twas a prize well worth contending:  
Worth thy perils, toils, alarms:  
Take her, hero, to thy arms:--  
Feast of Reason! feast of Sense!  
Beauty, Truth, and Innocence.  
  
*Chorus* . Valour true to Virtue's side,  
Worth, by sharp affliction tried,  
Merit well the blooming bride  
On whom propitious Fates dispense  
Beauty, Truth, and Innocence.  
  
*Arth* . O! sacred Guardian!--But all words are weak:  
I can but sigh my raptures; gaze my thanks,  
And, in the precious gift, the giver prize.  
  
*Tali* . Trumpet's clangors, Arms that rattle,  
Dreadful thro the bleeding battle,  
Now, a while,  
For kindling Beauty's roseate smile--  
Soothing softness! we forego.  
Haste Thee, Love! the wreath bestow.  
Witching smile  
And sportive wile  
That sense of wearied worth beguile;  
And Stelth, that love's coy nectar sips;  
And tilt and toy of parrying lips;  
Eyes that swim; and hearts that glow;  
And parly with the yielding foe;--  
These, for laurels, Love! bestow;  
And we again will fight thy battle.  
  
*Bard* . Haste thee, Boy! But wing thy arrows  
With the dove's plume; not the sparrow's:  
Turtle, that, in thickest grove,  
Guards the nest of absent love.  
And still, as Valour's meed, dispense  
Beauty, Truth, and Innocence.  
So, when storms of danger rattle,  
We again will fight thy battle.  
  
*Chorus* . Beauty, Truth, and Innocence  
Still, as Valour's meed dispense;  
And, when storms of danger rattle,  
Valour's sons shall fight thy battle.  
  
*Lady* . But see below, how from the misty vale  
The day retires, and twilight shades prevail.  
Soon shall those shadows up the mountain spread,  
And Night involve Farinioch's peaky head.  
One thing remains: to wast my chosen son  
To Ca&emul;r Leon: then my talk is done.  
There Britain's chiefs assembled, even now,  
Prepare the regal fillet for thy brow.  
Ye sightless agents of the charmed air!  
Sustain our weight. Behold: for we are there.  
  
*Scene VI. She waves her silver Trident, and the  
scene changes to Caer-Leon, in all its fabled grandeur;  
splendidly illuminated, and decorated with martial  
trophies, banners, wreaths, and braids of flowers,  
and other sumptuous preparations for the coronation of  
* Arthur. Nobles, Bards, Ladies, Youths,  
*and* Maidens *with baskets of Flowers,* Maskers,  
Revellers, &c.  
  
*La* . Here youths and maids your gather'd fragrance fling:  
Behold your promis'd Chief--your patriot King.  
  
*The Youths and Maidens strew their flowers; and the  
Chiefs, &c. prevent the regal fillet to* Arthur, *who  
binds it on the brow of* Guenever.  
  
*Tal* . Hail Britian's pride! immortal Arthur hail!  
Thy honour, name, and praise shall never fail!  
*Cho* . Hail Britain's pride! immortal Arthur hail!  
Thy honour, name, and praise shall never fail!  
*Lady* . Thus cover'd with glory, thus blest in thy love,  
To empire promoted, thy virtue to prove,  
Forget not that worth, in the sunshine of joy,  
That griefs could not quench, or afflictions annoy.  
Let your valour protect, but not ravage the state;  
And cherish the Low, while you rule o'er the great;  
So the bard, yet unborn, shall your triumphs proclaim,  
And the nations around thus re-echo your Fame--  
"Hail Britain's pride! immortal Arthur, hail!  
"Your honour, name, and praise shall never fail."  
*Chorus* . Hail Britain's pride! &c.--  
  
*Talies* . Wake the Harp to strains of pleasure!  
Let the sportive train advance:  
Ring of shields, and pyrrhic measure!  
Warriors, lead the nuptial dance.  
  
*A Dance of Warriors* .  
  
War and Toil have done their duty:  
Let your weary'd worth repose.  
Love succeeds; and smiling Beauty,  
With our laurel twines the rose.  
  
*A Dance of Virgins who crown* Arthur *and his  
* Knights *with chaplets.*  
  
*Chorus* . Love and Glory, thus uniting,  
All their mingled boons confer.  
Arthur, lo! thy worth requiting,  
Empire, Fame, and Guenever.  
*Lady* . Now, my talk perform'd, I fly  
To my secret bowers, that lie  
Where the Day-Star never came,  
Peering---Fleering,  
With his searching eye of flame.  
There, in virgin state, I rove  
Thro' sparry dome, and coral grove,  
Self-illum'd with many a Gem  
Might grace a monarch's diadem.  
*Response below, as the Chariot rises* .  
Lady! Lady! haste to rove  
Thro' sparry dome and coral grove.  
See your Swans their traces shake,  
Regent of the silver lake!  
  
*Lady* . There, where bubbling fonts arise  
And the blue-eye'd Naides  
Thro the chinks, in many a rill,  
Tinkling---Sprinkling,  
Their salubrius boons distill--  
There I join the virgin throng,  
Warbling oft the choral song  
That brooks and echoing falls repeat,  
To Fancy's ear, in numbers sweet.  
*Response of Nymphs below* .  
Lady! Lady! haste along:  
Join the Choir, and join the song;  
Gurgling--tinkling,  
Murmuring--sprinkling,  
Sadly sweet, the rocks among.  
  
*Lady, as she seats herself in the Chariot* .  
Sisters, I the call obey,  
Seek the Grot, and join the lay;  
Murmuring--tinkling,  
Bubbing--sprinkling,  
Where the chrystal fountains,  
From their mountains,  
Gushing--Rushing,  
To their vallies haste away.  
  
Talliessin.  
May those fountains, Lady kind!  
Still their wonted channels find,  
Nor ever water-nymph neglect  
The silent tribute of respect,  
But, thro many a secret vein,  
Still the purer essence strain,  
And thy mystic urn supply;  
Never turbid, never dry:--  
Urn so pure, that Lunvey's tide,  
Thro its waters doom'd to glide,  
Silent, with unmingling wave,  
Hastes the wooddy glen to lave,  
And there, to list'ning groves, complains  
Of Love o'erawed, and stifled pains;  
With virgin beauties aye embrac'd  
Which yet he must not hope to taste.  
May ever on thy brink appear  
The earliest fragrance of the year,  
And lingering Autumn in thy face  
Reflected see his latest grace;  
While still, as circling hours prevail,  
The matin Lark and Nightingale  
The song of lengthen'd rapture wake  
To hail the Lady of the Lake.  
  
Chorus.  
Blow the martial trump again,  
Give to Fame the closing strain--  
Fame, that shall her wreaths confer  
On Arthur and on Guenever;  
And bid her loudest clarion wake,  
To hail the Lady of the Lake.  
  
The Curtain Drops.
