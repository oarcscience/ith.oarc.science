Gracious lessons thine<br>  And maxims of the mud!  'This Arthur pure!<br>  Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made<br>  Gives him the lie!  There is no being pure,<br>  My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?'--<br>  If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.<br>  Thy blessing, stainless King!  I bring thee back,<br>  When I have ferreted out their burrowings,<br>  The hearts of all this Order in mine hand--<br>  Ay--so that fate and craft and folly close,<br>  Perchance, one curl of Arthur's golden beard.<br>  To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine<br>  Is cleaner-fashioned--Well, I loved thee first,<br>  That warps the wit."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud laughed the graceless Mark.<br>  But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged<br>  Low in the city, and on a festal day<br>  When Guinevere was crossing the great hall<br>  Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why kneel ye there?  What evil have ye wrought?<br>  Rise!" and the damsel bidden rise arose<br>  And stood with folded hands and downward eyes<br>  Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,<br>  "None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!<br>  My father died in battle for thy King,<br>  My mother on his corpse--in open field,<br>  The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse--<br>  Poor wretch--no friend!--and now by Mark the King<br>  For that small charm of feature mine, pursued--<br>  If any such be mine--I fly to thee.<br>  Save, save me thou--Woman of women--thine<br>  The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,<br>  Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven's own white<br>  Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King--<br>  Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!<br>  O yield me shelter for mine innocency<br>  Among thy maidens!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here her slow sweet eyes<br>  Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose<br>  Fixt on her hearer's, while the Queen who stood<br>  All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves<br>  In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,<br>  "Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame<br>  We choose the last.  Our noble Arthur, him<br>  Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.<br>  Nay--we believe all evil of thy Mark--<br>  Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour<br>  We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.<br>  He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;<br>  We go to prove it.  Bide ye here the while."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She past; and Vivien murmured after "Go!<br>  I bide the while."  Then through the portal-arch<br>  Peering askance, and muttering broke-wise,<br>  As one that labours with an evil dream,<br>  Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that the Lancelot? goodly--ay, but gaunt:<br>  Courteous--amends for gauntness--takes her hand--<br>  That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been<br>  A clinging kiss--how hand lingers in hand!<br>  Let go at last!--they ride away--to hawk<br>  For waterfowl.  Royaller game is mine.<br>  For such a supersensual sensual bond<br>  As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth--<br>  Touch flax with flame--a glance will serve--the liars!<br>  Ah little rat that borest in the dyke<br>  Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep<br>  Down upon far-off cities while they dance--<br>  Or dream--of thee they dreamed not--nor of me<br>  These--ay, but each of either:  ride, and dream<br>  The mortal dream that never yet was mine--<br>  Ride, ride and dream until ye wake--to me!<br>  Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!<br>  For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,<br>  And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,<br>  Will hate, loathe, fear--but honour me the more."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet while they rode together down the plain,<br>  Their talk was all of training, terms of art,<br>  Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.<br>  "She is too noble" he said "to check at pies,<br>  Nor will she rake:  there is no baseness in her."<br>  Here when the Queen demanded as by chance<br>  "Know ye the stranger woman?" "Let her be,"<br>  Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off<br>  The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,<br>  Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up<br>  Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,<br>  Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird<br>  Who pounced her quarry and slew it.  Many a time<br>  As once--of old--among the flowers--they rode.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen<br>  Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched<br>  And whispered:  through the peaceful court she crept<br>  And whispered:  then as Arthur in the highest<br>  Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,<br>  Arriving at a time of golden rest,<br>  And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,<br>  While all the heathen lay at Arthur's feet,<br>  And no quest came, but all was joust and play,<br>  Leavened his hall.  They heard and let her be.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter as an enemy that has left<br>  Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,<br>  The wily Vivien stole from Arthur's court.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hated all the knights, and heard in thought<br>  Their lavish comment when her name was named.<br>  For once, when Arthur walking all alone,<br>  Vext at a rumour issued from herself<br>  Of some corruption crept among his knights,<br>  Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,<br>  Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood<br>  With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,<br>  And fluttered adoration, and at last<br>  With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more<br>  <a> Than who should prize him most; at which the King <br>  Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:<br>  But one had watched, and had not held his peace:<br>  It made the laughter of an afternoon<br>  That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.<br>  <a> And after that, she set herself to gain <br>  Him, the most famous man of all those times,<br>  Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,<br>  Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,<br>  Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;<br>  The people called him Wizard; whom at first<br>  She played about with slight and sprightly talk,<br>  And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points<br>  Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;<br>  And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer<br>  Would watch her at her petulance, and play,<br>  Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh<br>  As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew<br>  Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,<br>  Perceiving that she was but half disdained,<br>  Began to break her sports with graver fits,<br>  Turn red or pale, would often when they met<br>  Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him<br>  With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,<br>  Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times<br>  Would flatter his own wish in age for love,<br>  And half believe her true:  for thus at times<br>  He wavered; but that other clung to him,<br>  Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;<br>  He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found<br>  A doom that ever poised itself to fall,<br>  An ever-moaning battle in the mist,<br>  World-war of dying flesh against the life,<br>  Death in all life and lying in all love,<br>  The meanest having power upon the highest,<br>  And the high purpose broken by the worm.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So leaving Arthur's court he gained the beach;<br>  There found a little boat, and stept into it;<br>  <a> And Vivien followed, but he marked her not. <br>  <a> She took the helm and he the sail; the boat <br>  Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,<br>  And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.<br>  And then she followed Merlin all the way,<br>  Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.<br>  For Merlin once had told her of a charm,<br>  The which if any wrought on anyone<br>  With woven paces and with waving arms,<br>  The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie<br>  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,<br>  From which was no escape for evermore;<br>  And none could find that man for evermore,<br>  Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm<br>  <a> Coming and going, and he lay as dead <br>  And lost to life and use and name and fame.<br>  And Vivien ever sought to work the charm<br>  Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,<br>  As fancying that her glory would be great<br>  According to his greatness whom she quenched.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,<br>  As if in deepest reverence and in love.<br>  A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe<br>  Of samite without price, that more exprest<br>  Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,<br>  In colour like the satin-shining palm<br>  On sallows in the windy gleams of March:<br>  And while she kissed them, crying, "Trample me,<br>  Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,<br>  And I will pay you worship; tread me down<br>  And I will kiss you for it;" he was mute:<br>  So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,<br>  As on a dull day in an Ocean cave<br>  The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall<br>  In silence:  wherefore, when she lifted up<br>  A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,<br>  "O Merlin, do ye love me?" and again,<br>  "O Merlin, do ye love me?" and once more,<br>  "Great Master, do ye love me?" he was mute.<br>  And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,<br>  Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,<br>  Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet<br>  Together, curved an arm about his neck,<br>  Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand<br>  Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,<br>  Made with her right a comb of pearl to part<br>  The lists of such a beard as youth gone out<br>  Had left in ashes:  then he spoke and said,<br>  Not looking at her, "Who are wise in love<br>  Love most, say least," and Vivien answered quick,<br>  "I saw the little elf-god eyeless once<br>  In Arthur's arras hall at Camelot:<br>  But neither eyes nor tongue--O stupid child!<br>  Yet you are wise who say it; let me think<br>  Silence is wisdom:  I am silent then,<br>  And ask no kiss;" then adding all at once,<br>  "And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom," drew<br>  The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard<br>  Across her neck and bosom to her knee,<br>  And called herself a gilded summer fly<br>  Caught in a great old tyrant spider's web,<br>  Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood<br>  Without one word.  So Vivien called herself,<br>  But rather seemed a lovely baleful star<br>  Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:<br>  "To what request for what strange boon," he said,<br>  "Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,<br>  O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,<br>  For these have broken up my melancholy."<br>  <br>  <a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered smiling saucily, <br>  "What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?<br>  I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!<br>  But yesterday you never opened lip,<br>  Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:<br>  In mine own lady palms I culled the spring<br>  That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,<br>  And made a pretty cup of both my hands<br>  And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank<br>  And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;<br>  O no more thanks than might a goat have given<br>  With no more sign of reverence than a beard.<br>  And when we halted at that other well,<br>  And I was faint to swooning, and you lay<br>  Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those<br>  Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know<br>  That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?<br>  And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood<br>  And all this morning when I fondled you:<br>  Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange--<br>  How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,<br>  But such a silence is more wise than kind."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:<br>  "O did ye never lie upon the shore,<br>  And watch the curled white of the coming wave<br>  Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?<br>  Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,<br>  Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,<br>  Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.<br>  And then I rose and fled from Arthur's court<br>  To break the mood.  You followed me unasked;<br>  And when I looked, and saw you following still,<br>  My mind involved yourself the nearest thing<br>  In that mind-mist:  for shall I tell you truth?<br>  You seemed that wave about to break upon me<br>  And sweep me from my hold upon the world,<br>  My use and name and fame.  Your pardon, child.<br>  Your pretty sports have brightened all again.<br>  And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,<br>  Once for wrong done you by confusion, next<br>  For thanks it seems till now neglected, last<br>  For these your dainty gambols:  wherefore ask;<br>  And take this boon so strange and not so strange."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:<br>  "O not so strange as my long asking it,<br>  Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,<br>  Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.<br>  I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;<br>  And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.<br>  The people call you prophet:  let it be:<br>  But not of those that can expound themselves.<br>  Take Vivien for expounder; she will call<br>  That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours<br>  No presage, but the same mistrustful mood<br>  That makes you seem less noble than yourself,<br>  Whenever I have asked this very boon,<br>  Now asked again:  for see you not, dear love,<br>  That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed<br>  Your fancy when ye saw me following you,<br>  Must make me fear still more you are not mine,<br>  Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,<br>  And make me wish still more to learn this charm<br>  Of woven paces and of waving hands,<br>  As proof of trust.  O Merlin, teach it me.<br>  The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.<br>  For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,<br>  I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,<br>  Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.<br>  And therefore be as great as ye are named.<br>  Not muffled round with selfish reticence.<br>  How hard you look and how denyingly!<br>  O, if you think this wickedness in me,<br>  That I should prove it on you unawares,<br>  That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond<br>  Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,<br>  By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,<br>  As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:<br>  O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,<br>  If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,<br>  Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,<br>  Have tript on such conjectural treachery--<br>  May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell<br>  Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,<br>  If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,<br>  Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;<br>  And grant my re-reiterated wish,<br>  The great proof of your love:  because I think,<br>  However wise, ye hardly know me yet."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,<br>  "I never was less wise, however wise,<br>  Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,<br>  Than when I told you first of such a charm.<br>  Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,<br>  Too much I trusted when I told you that,<br>  And stirred this vice in you which ruined man<br>  Through woman the first hour; for howsoe'er<br>  In children a great curiousness be well,<br>  Who have to learn themselves and all the world,<br>  In you, that are no child, for still I find<br>  Your face is practised when I spell the lines,<br>  I call it,--well, I will not call it vice:<br>  But since you name yourself the summer fly,<br>  I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,<br>  That settles, beaten back, and beaten back<br>  Settles, till one could yield for weariness:<br>  But since I will not yield to give you power<br>  Upon my life and use and name and fame,<br>  Why will ye never ask some other boon?<br>  Yea, by God's rood, I trusted you too much."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid<br>  That ever bided tryst at village stile,<br>  Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:<br>  "Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;<br>  Caress her:  let her feel herself forgiven<br>  Who feels no heart to ask another boon.<br>  I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme<br>  Of 'trust me not at all or all in all.'<br>  I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,<br>  And it shall answer for me.  Listen to it.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,<br>  Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:<br>  Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is the little rift within the lute,<br>  That by and by will make the music mute,<br>  And ever widening slowly silence all.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The little rift within the lover's lute<br>  Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,<br>  That rotting inward slowly moulders all.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is not worth the keeping:  let it go:<br>  But shall it?  answer, darling, answer, no.<br>  And trust me not at all or all in all.'<br>  <br>  <a> O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?" <br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin looked and half believed her true,<br>  So tender was her voice, so fair her face,<br>  So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears<br>  Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:<br>  And yet he answered half indignantly:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far other was the song that once I heard<br>  By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:<br>  For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,<br>  To chase a creature that was current then<br>  In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.<br>  It was the time when first the question rose<br>  About the founding of a Table Round,<br>  That was to be, for love of God and men<br>  And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.<br>  And each incited each to noble deeds.<br>  And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,<br>  <a> We could not keep him silent, out he flashed, <br>  And into such a song, such fire for fame,<br>  Such trumpet-blowings in it, coming down<br>  To such a stern and iron-clashing close,<br>  That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,<br>  And should have done it; but the beauteous beast<br>  Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,<br>  And like a silver shadow slipt away<br>  Through the dim land; and all day long we rode<br>  Through the dim land against a rushing wind,<br>  That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,<br>  And chased the flashes of his golden horns<br>  Until they vanished by the fairy well<br>  That laughs at iron--as our warriors did--<br>  Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,<br>  'Laugh, little well!' but touch it with a sword,<br>  It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there<br>  We lost him:  such a noble song was that.<br>  But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,<br>  I felt as though you knew this curs&egrave;d charm,<br>  Were proving it on me, and that I lay<br>  And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:<br>  "O mine have ebbed away for evermore,<br>  And all through following you to this wild wood,<br>  Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.<br>  Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount<br>  As high as woman in her selfless mood.<br>  And touching fame, howe'er ye scorn my song,<br>  Take one verse more--the lady speaks it--this:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,<br>  For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,<br>  And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.<br>  So trust me not at all or all in all.'<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Says she not well? and there is more--this rhyme<br>  Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,<br>  That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;<br>  Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.<br>  But nevermore the same two sister pearls<br>  Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other<br>  On her white neck--so is it with this rhyme:<br>  It lives dispersedly in many hands,<br>  And every minstrel sings it differently;<br>  'Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love.'<br>  Yea!  Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves<br>  A portion from the solid present, eats<br>  And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,<br>  The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;<br>  And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,<br>  And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself<br>  Know well that Envy calls you Devil's son,<br>  And since ye seem the Master of all Art,<br>  They fain would make you Master of all vice."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,<br>  "I once was looking for a magic weed,<br>  And found a fair young squire who sat alone,<br>  Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,<br>  And then was painting on it fancied arms,<br>  Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun<br>  In dexter chief; the scroll 'I follow fame.'<br>  And speaking not, but leaning over him,<br>  I took his brush and blotted out the bird,<br>  And made a Gardner putting in a graff,<br>  With this for motto, 'Rather use than fame.'<br>  You should have seen him blush; but afterwards<br>  He made a stalwart knight.  O Vivien,<br>  For you, methinks you think you love me well;<br>  For me, I love you somewhat; rest:  and Love<br>  Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,<br>  Not ever be too curious for a boon,<br>  Too prurient for a proof against the grain<br>  Of him ye say ye love:  but Fame with men,<br>  Being but ampler means to serve mankind,<br>  Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,<br>  But work as vassal to the larger love,<br>  That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.<br>  Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again<br>  Increasing gave me use.  Lo, there my boon!<br>  What other? for men sought to prove me vile,<br>  Because I fain had given them greater wits:<br>  And then did Envy call me Devil's son:<br>  The sick weak beast seeking to help herself<br>  By striking at her better, missed, and brought<br>  Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.<br>  Sweet were the days when I was  all unknown,<br>  But when my name was lifted up, the storm<br>  Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.<br>  Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,<br>  Yet needs must work my work.  That other fame,<br>  To one at least, who hath not children, vague,<br>  The cackle of the unborn about the grave,<br>  I cared not for it:  a single misty star,<br>  Which is the second in a line of stars<br>  That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,<br>  I never gazed upon it but I dreamt<br>  Of some vast charm concluded in that star<br>  To make fame nothing.  Wherefore, if I fear,<br>  Giving you power upon me through this charm,<br>  That you might play me falsely, having power,<br>  However well ye think ye love me now<br>  (As sons of kings loving in pupilage<br>  Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)<br>  I rather dread the loss of use than fame;<br>  If you--and not so much from wickedness,<br>  As some wild turn of anger, or a mood<br>  Of overstrained affection, it may be,<br>  To keep me all to your own self,--or else<br>  A sudden spurt of woman's jealousy,--<br>  Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:<br>  "Have I not sworn?  I am not trusted.  Good!<br>  Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;<br>  And being found take heed of Vivien.<br>  A woman and not trusted, doubtless I<br>  Might feel some sudden turn of anger born<br>  Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet<br>  Is accurate too, for this full love of mine<br>  Without the full heart back may merit well<br>  Your term of overstrained.  So used as I,<br>  My daily wonder is, I love at all.<br>  And as to woman's jealousy, O why not?<br>  O to what end, except a jealous one,<br>  And one to make me jealous if I love,<br>  Was this fair charm invented by yourself?<br>  I well believe that all about this world<br>  Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,<br>  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower<br>  From which is no escape for evermore."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the great Master merrily answered her:<br>  "Full many a love in loving youth was mine;<br>  I needed then no charm to keep them mine<br>  But youth and love; and that full heart of yours<br>  Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;<br>  So live uncharmed.  For those who wrought it first,<br>  The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,<br>  The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones<br>  Who paced it, ages back:  but will ye hear<br>  The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There lived a king in the most Eastern East,<br>  Less old than I, yet older, for my blood<br>  Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.<br>  A tawny pirate anchored in his port,<br>  Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;<br>  And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,<br>  He saw two cities in a thousand boats<br>  All fighting for a woman on the sea.<br>  And pushing his black craft among them all,<br>  He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,<br>  With loss of half his people arrow-slain;<br>  A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,<br>  They said a light came from her when she moved:<br>  And since the pirate would not yield her up,<br>  The King impaled him for his piracy;<br>  Then made her Queen:  but those isle-nurtured eyes<br>  Waged such unwilling though successful war<br>  On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,<br>  And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew<br>  The rustiest iron of old fighters' hearts;<br>  And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt<br>  Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back<br>  That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees<br>  Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,<br>  To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.<br>  What wonder, being jealous, that he sent<br>  His horns of proclamation out through all<br>  The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed<br>  To find a wizard who might teach the King<br>  Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen<br>  Might keep her all his own:  to such a one<br>  He promised more than ever king has given,<br>  A league of mountain full of golden mines,<br>  A province with a hundred miles of coast,<br>  A palace and a princess, all for him:<br>  But on all those who tried and failed, the King<br>  Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it<br>  To keep the list low and pretenders back,<br>  Or like a king, not to be trifled with--<br>  Their heads should moulder on the city gates.<br>  And many tried and failed, because the charm<br>  Of nature in her overbore their own:<br>  And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:<br>  And many weeks a troop of carrion crows<br>  Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:<br>  "I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,<br>  Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.<br>  The lady never made <i> unwilling</i>  war<br>  With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,<br>  And made her good man jealous with good cause.<br>  And lived there neither dame nor damsel then<br>  Wroth at a lover's loss?  were all as tame,<br>  I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?<br>  Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,<br>  Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,<br>  Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?<br>  Well, those were not our days:  but did they find<br>  A wizard?  Tell me, was he like to thee?<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck<br>  Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes<br>  Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride's<br>  On her new lord, her own, the first of men.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered laughing, "Nay, not like to me.<br>  At last they found--his foragers for charms--<br>  <a> A little glassy-headed hairless man, <br>  Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;<br>  Read but one book, and ever reading grew<br>  So grated down and filed away with thought,<br>  So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin<br>  Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.<br>  And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,<br>  Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,<br>  Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall<br>  That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men<br>  Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,<br>  And heard their voices talk behind the wall,<br>  And learnt their elemental secrets, powers<br>  And forces; often o'er the sun's bright eye<br>  Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,<br>  And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;<br>  Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,<br>  When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,<br>  And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned<br>  The world to peace again:  here was the man.<br>  And so by force they dragged him to the King.<br>  And then he taught the King to charm the Queen<br>  In such-wise, that no man could see her more,<br>  Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,<br>  Coming and going, and she lay as dead,<br>  And lost all use of life:  but when the King<br>  Made proffer of the league of golden mines,<br>  The province with a hundred miles of coast,<br>  The palace and the princess, that old man<br>  Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,<br>  And vanished, and his book came down to me."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered smiling saucily:<br>  "Ye have the book:  the charm is written in it:<br>  Good:  take my counsel:  let me know it at once:<br>  For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,<br>  With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,<br>  And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound<br>  As after furious battle turfs the slain<br>  On some wild down above the windy deep,<br>  I yet should strike upon a sudden means<br>  To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:<br>  Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling as a master smiles at one<br>  That is not of his school, nor any school<br>  But that where blind and naked Ignorance<br>  Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,<br>  On all things all day long, he anwered her:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!<br>  O ay, it is but twenty pages long,<br>  But every page having an ample marge,<br>  And every marge enclosing in the midst<br>  A square of text that looks a little blot,<br>  The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;<br>  And every square of text an awful charm,<br>  Writ in a language that has long gone by.<br>  So long, that mountains have arisen since<br>  With cities on their flanks--thou read the book!<br>  And every margin scribbled, crost, and crammed<br>  With comment, densest condensation, hard<br>  To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights<br>  Of my long life have made it easy to me.<br>  And none can read the text, not even I;<br>  And none can read the comment but myself;<br>  And in the comment did I find the charm.<br>  O, the results are simple; a mere child<br>  Might use it to the harm of anyone,<br>  And never could undo it:  ask no more:<br>  For though you should not prove it upon me,<br>  But keep the oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,<br>  Assay it on some one of the Table Round,<br>  And all because ye dream they babble of you."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:<br>  "What dare the full-fed liars say of me?<br>  <i> They</i>  ride abroad redressing human wrongs!<br>  They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!<br>  <i> They</i>  bound to holy vows of chastity!<br>  Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.<br>  But you are man, you well can understand<br>  The shame that cannot be explained for shame.<br>  Not one of all the drove should touch me:  swine!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered Merlin careless of her words:<br>  "You breathe but accusation vast and vague,<br>  Spleen-born, I think, and proofless.  If ye know,<br>  Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:<br>  "O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him<br>  Whose kinsman left him watcher o'er his wife<br>  And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;<br>  Was one year gone, and on returning found<br>  Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one<br>  But one hour old!  What said the happy sire?<br>  A seven-months' babe had been a truer gift.<br>  Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then answered Merlin, "Nay, I know the tale.<br>  Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:<br>  Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:<br>  One child they had:  it lived with her:  she died:<br>  His kinsman travelling on his own affair<br>  Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.<br>  He brought, not found it therefore:  take the truth."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O ay," said Vivien, "overtrue a tale.<br>  What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,<br>  That ardent man? 'to pluck the flower in season,'<br>  So says the song, 'I trow it is no treason.'<br>  <a> O Master, shall we call him overquick <br>  To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin answered, "Overquick art thou<br>  To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing<br>  Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey<br>  Is man's good name:  he never wronged his bride.<br>  I know the tale.  An angry gust of wind<br>  Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed<br>  And many-corridored complexities<br>  Of Arthur's palace:  then he found a door,<br>  And darkling felt the scultpured ornament<br>  That wreathen round it made it seem his own;<br>  And wearied out made for the couch and slept,<br>  A stainless man beside a stainless maid;<br>  And either slept, nor knew of other there;<br>  Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose<br>  In Arthur's casement glimmered chastely down,<br>  Blushing upon them blushing, and at once<br>  He rose without a word and parted from her:<br>  But when the thing was blazed about the court,<br>  The brute world howling forced them into bonds,<br>  And as it chanced they are happy, being pure."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O ay," said Vivien, "that were likely too.<br>  What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale<br>  And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,<br>  The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,<br>  Or some black wether of St. Satan's fold.<br>  What, in the precints of the chapel-yard,<br>  Among the knightly brasses of the graves,<br>  And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Merlin answered careless of her charge,<br>  "A sober man is Percivale and pure;<br>  But once in life was flustered with new wine,<br>  Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;<br>  Where one of Satan's shepherdesses caught<br>  And meant to stamp him with her master's mark:<br>  And that he sinned is not believable;<br>  For, look upon his face!--but if he sinned,<br>  The sin that practice burns into the blood,<br>  And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,<br>  Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:<br>  Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns<br>  Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.<br>  But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:<br>  "O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend<br>  Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,<br>  I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,<br>  Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To which he answered sadly, "Yea, I know it.<br>  <a> Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first, <br>  To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.<br>  A rumour runs, she took him for the King,<br>  <a> So fixt her fancy on him:  let them be. <br>  But have ye no one word of loyal praise<br>  For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:<br>  "Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?<br>  Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?<br>  By which the good King means to blind himself,<br>  And blinds himself and all the Table Round<br>  To all the foulness that they work.  Myself<br>  Could call him (were it not for womanhood)<br>  The pretty, popular name such manhood earns,<br>  Could call him the main cause of all their crime;<br>  Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:<br>  "O true and tender!  O my liege and King!<br>  O selfless man and stainless gentleman,<br>  Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain<br>  Have all men true and leal, all women pure;<br>  How, in the mouths of base interpreters,<br>  From over-fineness not intelligible<br>  To things with every sense as false and foul<br>  As the poached filth that floods the middle street,<br>  Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!"<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne<br>  By instance, recommenced , and let her tongue<br>  Rage like a fire among the noblest names,<br>  Polluting, and imputing her whole self,<br>  Defaming and defacing, till she left<br>  Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her words had issue other than she willed.<br>  He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made<br>  A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,<br>  And muttered in himself, "Tell <i> her</i>  the charm!<br>  So, if she had it, would she rail on me<br>  To snare the next, and if she have it not<br>  So will she rail.  What did the wanton say?<br>  'Not mount as high;' we scarce can sink as low:<br>  For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,<br>  But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.<br>  I know the Table Round, my friends of old;<br>  All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.<br>  She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;<br>  I well believe she tempted them and failed,<br>  Being so bitter:  for fine plots may fail,<br>  Though harlots paint their talk as well as face<br>  With colours of the heart that are not theirs.<br>  I will not let her know:  nine tithes of times<br>  Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.<br>  And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime<br>  Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,<br>  Wanting the mental range; or low desire<br>  Not to feel lowest makes them level all;<br>  Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,<br>  To leave an equal baseness; and in this<br>  Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find<br>  Some stain or blemish in a name of note,<br>  Not grieving that their greatest are so small,<br>  Inflate themselves with some insane delight,<br>  And judge all nature from her feet of clay,<br>  Without the will to lift their eyes, and see<br>  Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,<br>  And touching other worlds.  I am weary of her."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,<br>  Half-suffocated in the hoary fell<br>  And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.<br>  But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,<br>  And hearing "harlot" muttered twice or thrice,<br>  Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood<br>  Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,<br>  How from the rosy lips of life and love,<br>  Flashed the bare grinning skeleton of death!<br>  White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed<br>  Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched<br>  Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,<br>  And feeling; had she found a dagger there<br>  (For in a wink the false love turns to hate)<br>  She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:<br>  His eye was calm, and suddenly she took<br>  To bitter weeping like a beaten child,<br>  A long, long weeping, not consolable.<br>  Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O crueller than was ever told in tale,<br>  Or sung in song!  O vainly lavished love!<br>  O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,<br>  Or seeming shameful--for what shame in love,<br>  So love be true, and not as yours is--nothing<br>  Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust<br>  Who called her what he called her--all her crime,<br>  All--all--the wish to prove him wholly hers."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mused a little, and then clapt her hands<br>  Together with a wailing shriek, and said:<br>  "Stabbed through the heart's affections to the heart!<br>  Seethed like the kid in its own mother's milk!<br>  Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!<br>  I thought that he was gentle, being great:<br>  O God, that I had loved a smaller man!<br>  I should have found in him a greater heart.<br>  O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw<br>  The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,<br>  Who loved to make men darker than they are,<br>  Because of that high pleasure which I had<br>  To seat you sole upon my pedestal<br>  Of worship--I am answered, and henceforth<br>  The course of life that seemed so flowery to me<br>  With you for guide and master, only you,<br>  Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,<br>  And ending in a ruin--nothing left,<br>  But into some low cave to crawl, and there,<br>  If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,<br>  Killed with inutterable unkindliness."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,<br>  The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid<br>  Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,<br>  And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm<br>  In silence, while his anger slowly died<br>  Within him, till he let his wisdom go<br>  For ease of heart, and half believed her true:<br>  Called her to shelter, in the hollow oak,<br>  "Come from the storm," and having no reply,<br>  Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face<br>  Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;<br>  Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,<br>  To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.<br>  At last she let herself be conquered by him,<br>  And as the cageling newly flown returns,<br>  The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing<br>  Came to her old perch back, and settled there.<br>  There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,<br>  Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw<br>  The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,<br>  About her, more in kindness than in love,<br>  The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.<br>  But she dislinked herself at once and rose,<br>  Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,<br>  A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,<br>  Upright and flushed before him:  then she said:<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There must be now no passages of love<br>  Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;<br>  Since, if I be what I am grossly called,<br>  What should be granted which your own gross heart<br>  Would reckon worth the taking?  I will go.<br>  In truth, but one thing now--better have died<br>  Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay--<br>  That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!<br>  How justly, after that vile term of yours,<br>  I find with grief!  I might believe you then,<br>  Who knows? once more.  Lo! what was once to me<br>  Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown<br>  The vast necessity of heart and life.<br>  Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear<br>  My fate or folly, passing gayer youth<br>  For one so old, must be to love thee still.<br>  But ere I leave thee let me swear once more<br>  That if I schemed against thy peace in this,<br>  May yon just heaven, that darkens o'er me, send<br>  One flash, that, missing all things else, may make<br>  My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie."<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt<br>  (For now the storm was close above them) struck,<br>  Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining<br>  With darted spikes and splinters of the wood<br>  The dark earth round.  He raised his eyes and saw<br>  The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.<br>  But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,<br>  And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,<br>  And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps<br>  That followed, flying back and crying out,<br>  <a> "O Merlin, though you do not love me, save, <br>  Yet save me!"  clung to him and hugged him close;<br>  And called him dear protector in her fright,<br>  Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,<br>  But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.<br>  The pale blood of the wizard at her touch<br>  Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.<br>  She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:<br>  She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept<br>  Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,<br>  Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,<br>  Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love<br>  Of her whole life; and ever overhead<br>  Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch<br>  Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain<br>  Above them; and in change of glare and gloom<br>  Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;<br>  Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,<br>  Moaning and calling out of other lands,<br>  Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more<br>  To peace; and what should not have been had been,<br>  For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,<br>  Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm<br>  Of woven paces and of waving hands,<br>  <a> And in the hollow oak he lay as dead, <br>  And lost to life and use and name and fame.<br>  <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then crying "I have made his glory mine,"<br>  <a> And shrieking out "O fool!" the harlot leapt <br>  Adown the forest, and the thicket closed<br>  Behind her, and the forest echoed "fool."<br>
