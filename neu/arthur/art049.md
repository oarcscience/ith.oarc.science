## THE DREAM OF SIR GALAHAD

### by

## MADISON CAWEIN

  
*With the knights Peredur and Gawain he sits, in a chapel in Lyonesse,
speaking while the dawn slowly reddens on the sea, gray-seen through the
open door.*  
I  
Cast on sleep there came to me  
Three great angels, o'er the sea  
Moaning near the priory:  
Cloudy clad in awful white,  
Each one's face, a lucid light,  
Rayed and blossomed out of night.  
  
II  
  
In my sleep I saw them rest,  
Each, a long hand on her breast,  
Like the new-moon in the west:  
And their hair like sunset rolled  
Down their shoulders, burning cold,  
An insufferable gold.  
  
III  
  
Flaming round each high brow bent  
Fourfold starry gold, that sent  
Light before them as they went:  
'Neath their burning crowns their eyes  
Shone like awful stars the skies  
Rock in shattered storm that flies.  
  
IV  
  
Dark their eyes were, lurid dark;  
And within their eyes a spark  
Like the opal's burned: my sark  
Seemed to shrivel 'neath their gaze;  
As, with marvel and amaze,  
All my soul it seemed to raise.  
  
V  
  
And I saw their mouths were fire,  
Ruby-red as the desire  
Of the Sanc Graal: fair and dire  
Were their lips, whereon the kiss  
Of all Heaven lay; the bliss  
Of all happiness that is.  
  
VI  
  
Calm as Beauty lying dead,  
Tapers lit at feet and head,  
Were they, round whom prayers seemed said:  
Fragrant as that woman who,  
Born of blossoms and of dew  
And of magic, wedded Llew.  
  
VII  
  
And the first one said to me:--  
"Thou has slept thus holily  
While seven sands ran shadowy;  
Earth hath served thee like a slave,  
Serving us who found thee brave,  
Pure of life and great to save:  
  
VIII  
  
"Know!"--She touched my brow: a pain  
As of arrows pierced my brain:  
Ceased: and earth, both sea and plain,  
Vanished: and I stood where thought  
Stands, and worship, spirit-fraught,  
Watching how the heavens are wrought.  
  
IX  
  
Then the second said to me:  
"Thou hast come all sinlessly  
Thro' life's sin-enveloped sea:  
Know the things thou hast not seen:  
Filling all the soul with sheen;  
Meaning more than earth may mean:  
  
X  
  
"See!"--Her voice sang like a lyre,  
Comprehending all desire  
In its gamut's throbbing fire:--  
And my inner eyelids,--which  
Dimmed clairvoyance,--raised: and rich,  
As one chord's vibrating pitch,  
  
XI  
  
Grew my soul with light: that saw  
The embodiment of awe,  
Love, divinity, and law,  
Orbed and eöned: and the power,  
Circumstance, like some vast flower;  
From which time fell, hour on hour.  
  
XII  
  
'Neath the third one's mighty will  
All my soul lay very still,  
Feeling all its being thrill  
As she, smiling, said to me:  
"Thou dost know, and thou canst see:  
What thou art arise and be!"  
  
XIII  
  
To my lips her lips she pressed;  
And my new-born soul, thrice-blessed,  
Clasped her radiance and caressed:  
Mounted and, in glory clad,  
Soared with them who chorused glad:  
"Christ awaits thee, Galahad!"
