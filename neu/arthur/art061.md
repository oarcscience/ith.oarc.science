An Arthurian Miscellany at Intangible Textual Heritage

## MERLIN I

### by

## RALPH WALDO EMERSON

  
  
Thy trivial harp will never please  
Or fill my craving ear;  
Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,  
Free, peremptory, clear.  
No jingling serenader's art,  
Nor tinkle of piano strings,  
Can make the wild blood start  
In its mystic springs.  
The kingly bard  
Must smite the chords rudely and hard,  
As with hammer or with mace;  
That they may render back  
Artful thunder, which conveys  
Secrets of the solar track,  
Sparks of the supersolar blaze.  
  
Merlin's blows are strokes of fate,  
Chiming with the forest tone,  
When boughs buffet boughs in the wood;  
Chiming with the gasp and moan  
Of the ice-imprisoned flood;  
With the pulse of manly hearts;  
With the voice or orators;  
With the din of city arts;  
With the cannonade of wars;  
With the marches of the brave;  
And prayers of might from martyrs' cave.  
  
Great is the art,  
Great be the manners, of the bard.  
He shall not his brain encumber  
With the coil of rhythm and number;  
But, leaving rule and pale forethought,  
He shall aye climb  
For his rhyme.  
"Pass in, pass in," the angels say,  
"In to the upper doors,  
Nor count compartments of the floors,  
But mount to paradise  
By the stairway of surprise."  
  
Blameless master of the games,  
King of sport that never shames,  
He shall daily joy dispense  
Hid in song's sweet influence.  
Forms more cheerly live and go,  
What time the subtle mind  
Sings aloud the tune whereto  
Their pulses beat,  
And march their feet,  
And their members are combined.  
  
By Sybarites beguiled,  
He shall no task decline;  
Merlin's mighty line  
Extremes of nature reconciled,--  
Bereaved a tyrant of his will,  
And made the lion mild.  
Songs can the tempest still,  
Scattered on the stormy air,  
Mold the year to fair increase,  
And bring in poetic peace.  
He shall not seek to weave,  
In weak, unhappy times,  
Efficacious rhymes;  
Wait his returning strength.  
Bird that from the nadir's floor  
To the zenith's top can soar,--  
The soaring orbit of the muse exceeds that journey's length.  
Nor profane affect to hit  
Or compass that, by meddling wit,  
Which only the propitious mind  
Publishes when 'tis inclined.  
There are open hours  
When the God's will sallies free,  
And the dull idiot might see  
The flowing fortunes of a thousand years;--  
Sudden, at unawares,  
Self-moved, fly-to the doors,  
Nor sword of angels could reveal  
What they conceal.
