[1]<br>  <br>  O!  in the field of Camlan fight,<br>  Ere the burning noon was o'er,<br>  The red blood ran, like a river-wave,<br>  On the dry and parched shore:<br>  <br>  King Arthur spurr'd his foaming horse<br>  Amid that living flood! [2]<br>  And twice he wav'd his witched sword<br>  Where the dauntless Modred stood!<br>  <br>  But who could stand by Arthur's side,<br>  When that steel of terror shone?<br>  When the fire of wroth was in his eye,<br>  And he rais'd his arm alone!<br>  <br>  That sun that blaz'd in middle sky,<br>  And flam'd on hill and dell;<br>  Its westering light had sunk in night,<br>  When the mighty Modred fell!<br>  <br>  But the blood that flows is Arthur's blood, [3]<br>  His fiery eye is dim!<br>  And a dew like death is on his face,<br>  And over every limb!<br>  <br>  He lean'd him down on his dragon shield,<br>  He clasp'd his beaver on!<br>  And the gushing blood it ceas'd at once,<br>  But they heard no dying groan.<br>  <br>  O! how they strove till the night came on,<br>  And all to raise that masque again!<br>  And every arm by turns had tried,<br>  But every arm was vain!<br>  <br>  They held him in their arms, and wept<br>  With tears of deep despair!<br>  Till they fear'd to touch that plate armour,<br>  For the sound was hollow there!<br>  <br>  Then they drew that witched sword,<br>  And they heard the armour ring!<br>  They wav'd it twice in Merlin's name<br>  Before they touch'd the king.<br>  <br>  At once the cross-lace open'd wide,<br>  They felt the rushing air!<br>  But that mail was hollow as the grave,<br>  Nor form, nor body there.<br>  <br>  As wild they gaz'd, the iron rings<br>  Were clasped as before!<br>  But the tongue that call'd on Merlin's name<br>  Was dumb for ever more!<br>  <br>  Mean time, the king was borne away,<br>  In deep and death-like sleep the while,<br>  To the charmed sea, by magic spell,<br>  By the Queen of the Yellow Isle!<br>  <br>  And when his tranced soul was rous'd,<br>  He thought, and thought how this might be,<br>  For there was nought but sea and sky<br>  As far as he could see.<br>  <br>  King Arthur gaz'd on the calmed surge,<br>  So clear beyond compare!<br>  But neither the form of living man,<br>  Nor the sound of life was there:<br>  <br>  The ship it mov'd on the sleeping wave<br>  Like a bird upon the air;<br>  He knew it gained on the deep,<br>  But he felt no motion there!<br>  <br>  O, then!  he had no trace of time<br>  How long he was on that pathless sea!<br>  But he could have rested there for aye,<br>  So sweet it seem'd to be!<br>  <br>  How many times he watch'd the sun,<br>  And saw it sink, he never knew;<br>  For it ne'er was more than faint twilight<br>  In that sky of stainless blue!<br>  <br>  Ah!  then he thought, within that ship<br>  He ever more was doom'd to be!<br>  And he had not once bethought him yet<br>  Of Merlin's prophecy!<br>  <br>  Those sleepless nights he watch'd alone,<br>  When the damps of midnight fell!<br>  That voice, of more than human tone,<br>  He heard in Merlin's cell; [4]<br>  <br>  That night, the eve of Camlan fight,<br>  When he felt his courage fail;<br>  When the chill of death was on his brow,<br>  Like a bloodless vision pale;<br>  <br>  That night, his knocking knees refus'd<br>  To bear him from the cave;<br>  When, press'd in his, the hand of blood<br>  Its deadly pressure gave!<br>  <br>  Clear was the sky, and O! with this<br>  What summer could compare?<br>  What woes could press on Arthur's heart,<br>  When he breath'd that blessed air?<br>  <br>  Clear was the sky!  the ship drew near<br>  Without the aid of wind or toil!<br>  And, lighted by the morning sun,<br>  He saw the charmed Isle!<br>  <br>  The ship was steady on her keel, <br>  Wash'd by that soft and lovely flood;<br>  And, blushing, on the yellow beach,<br>  The Queen of Beauty stood.<br>  <br>  High in one hand, of snowy white,<br>  A cup of sparkling pearl she bore;<br>  And she reach'd it to the tranced king<br>  As he knelt upon the shore:<br>  <br>  All pallid now was Arthur's brow,<br>  While he took the draught she gave;<br>  For he thought on what the hand of blood<br>  Had mingled in the cave:<br>  <br>  He thought on what the fiend pronounc'd, <br>  That Merlin's spirit brought;<br>  And he fix'd his eyes on that ladie's face,<br>  And trembled at the thought.<br>  <br>  Ah! in these eyes, of softest blue,<br>  What magic dwells, to lull the soul!<br>  And Arthur saw their mild reproach,<br>  And rais'd the fraughted bowl!<br>  <br>  His lips have drain'd that sparkling cup,<br>  And he turn'd on her his raptur'd eyes!<br>  When something, like a demon-smile,<br>  Betray'd the smooth disguise!<br>  <br>  He started up!  he call'd aloud!<br>  And, wild, survey'd her as she stood:<br>  When she rais'd aloof the other arm,<br>  And he knew the hand of blood!<br>  <br>  The voice, that answer'd to his call,<br>  Was that he heard within the cave!<br>  When the mighty form of Urien<br>  Was roused from the grave! [5]<br>  <br>  It told him, that the hour was come<br>  He too must slumber in the cave;<br>  When nought would reach his burial-place,<br>  But the murmurs of the wave!<br>  <br>  It told him of the years to pass<br>  Before his kingdom he could see:<br>  And Arthur knew he would return,<br>  From Merlin's prophecy. [6]<br>  <br>  King Arthur's body was not found,<br>  Nor ever laid in holy grave:<br>  And nought has reach'd his burial-place,<br>  But the murmurs of the wave.<br>   <br>  <hr>  <center><h3 align="CENTER" align="center">THE PROPHECY OF MERLIN: FOOTNOTES</h3> </center> <br>   <a> <b> 1</b>   Arthur's shield had on it the picture of our Lady, and his helm, an engraven dragon.<br>  -----SELDEN'S Notes to the Poly.

Song IV<br>  <br>  <a> <b> 3</b>   King Arthur, according to our ancient historians, slew Modred with his own hand; but received his death-wound himself, and retired to Ynys Ofallon, or Glastenbury, where he soon afterwards died.  His death was politically concelaed, lest it should dispirit the Britons.  Hence arose so many fabulous stories about it.<br>  -----EVANS'S Specimens of Welsh Poetry<br>  <br>  <a> <b> 4</b>   <blockquote>  There the wise Merlin, whilome he wont, (they say,)<br>  To make his wonne, low underneathe the ground<br>  In a deep delve, farre from the vew of day<br>  That of no living wight he mote be found,<br>  When so he counseld, with his sprights encompast round:<br>  And if thou ever happen that same way<br>  To traveill, go to see that dreadful place:<br>  It is an hideous hollow cave, (they say,)<br>  Under a rock<br>  -----SPENSER'S Faery Queene.

Olb. Song III.</blockquote>   It will not perhaps be very consonant to popular feeling, that legendary tradition has been violated in the fate and disposal of this great, national hero.  But it is all fairy-ground, and a poetical community of right to its appropriation has never been disputed.<br>  <br>  <center>FINIS.</center>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
