This picture was presented by G.F. Watts to Eton College. The purpose of
the gift was not to increase the wealth of the college by putting it in
possession of a valuable work of art; it was that the picture might be a
challenge to its youth. The authorities, realising this, appropriately
placed it in the College Chapel, so that generation after generation of
the youth of England might have before them the image of the stainless
knight, and be inspired to follow him.  
The moment Watts has chosen to depict Sir Galahad is that moment of
vision, so nobly expressed by Tennyson in the "Idylls of the King," when
the young knight beholds the Holy Grail, and makes his deathless choice.
According to the old legend this "Holy Grail" was the sacred Cup used by
our Lord in the Last Supper, which in some way passed into the hands of
Joseph of Arimathæa, who, it was said, carried it with him to Calvary on
the awful day of the Cross, and caught in it the last drops of blood
which fell from the Saviour's side. This possession of the Redeemer's
blood was found to have endued the Cup or Grail with miraculous
spiritual potency, so that it became in the world a blessed channel of
mystic and divine grace to all who looked upon it. But, alas!

>                                     "The times  
> Grew to such an evil, that the holy cup  
> Was caught away to heaven, and disappeared."

Though snatched from earth because of man's unworthiness it was yet
believed that to the pure in heart, and to those whose eyes had been
purged by tears and prayer, a vision of the sacred chalice would still
be vouchsafed. Nay, more, that some day, when sin had been driven from
the world, and love had gained conquest of the human heart, the holy
chalice would return. So-

>                                     "when Arthur made  
> His table round, and all men's hearts became  
> Clean for a season, surely he had thought  
> That now the Holy Grail would come again."

      Fired with this enthusiasm, in the spirit of chivalric adventure
mixed with spiritual longing, the Knights of the Round Table set out in
the Holy Quest. But alas! they had not counted the cost, or realised
aright the nature of their endeavour. The majority through inconstancy
and lack of inner sincerity failed, their enthusiasms too quickly waned,
and they returned disenchanted and disillusioned to Arthur's court. Many
followed "wandering fires;" some saw only the trailing light which
followed the Cup as it flashed upward, while Sir Launcelot, the bravest
of the brave, because of his sinful love for Guinivere, and because he
clung to his sin, saw the cup as holy wrath and fire, as swift and stern
retribution. Only to Sir Galahad did the mystic chalice disclose itself
in all its uplifting spiritual glory-to Sir Galahad the stainless
knight, *sans peur et sans reproche* , who was "of purer eyes than to
behold iniquity." In the strength of this vision, he says,

>                                           "I rode,  
> Shattering all evil customs everywhere,  
> And passed thro' Pagan realms, and made them mine,  
> And clash'd thro' Pagan hordes, and bore them down,  
> And broke thro' all, and in the strength of this  
> Came Victor."

      The "Quest of the Holy Grail," we now can see symbolises the
immortal striving after perfection, and in that quest Sir Galahad
becomes the ideal type of youthful courage sustained by spiritual purity
and consecration.  
      This will help us now to understand the picture. The young knight,
we see, has left behind him the splendours of court and hall, of jousts
and tournaments. Far into the tangled forests he has ridden contending
with its lurking dangers; he has cut his way through fierce
entanglements, and turned from the bewitching and sensuous forms which,
with their soft blandishments and languishing endearments, have sought
to arrest his progress, and turn him from the quest. And now the supreme
moment has come, the moment of revelation and self-consecration.
Descending from his horse he has hung his casque at the saddle bow, for
the stately avenues of the forest have suddenly become to him the pylons
and pillars of a House not made with hands. A white cloud arrested in
the sky forms an aureole around his head; he folds his hands in the
attitude of devotion; his face, uplifted, is refined and purified from
all base desire; his eyes gaze into that supra-sensual world from which
the visions come. With subtle spiritual insight Watts makes even the
horse appear conscious of the presence of things unseen. Though it
cannot behold, nor fully comprehend the things that are spiritual, some
dim instinct moves it to bow its head; it seems to worship too, the
artist has endowed it with an emotion almost human. Nor is Nature
herself unaffected. The atmosphere of the picture suggests an intense
stillness-the stillness of a drawn suspense, when air and trees and
clouds are held motionless, hardly daring to breathe, all spell-bound,
as it were, by a sense of awe and impending glory. At this very moment,
as Sir Galahad stands there with straining eyes and beating heart, the
vision of the Holy Grail flashes before his startled gaze, and with the
vision comes the call, the call to devote his life to God, to follow the
blameless King; and with the call comes his answer, his instant
response, his glad and willing self-surrender. Then Nature, the spell
broken, the tension relaxed, breaks the fetters which bind it, and with
its myriad voices, bursts into a gladsome song of praise and
jubilation:-  

> "The clouds are broken in the sky,  
>    And through the mountain walls  
> A rolling organ harmony  
>    Swells up and shakes and falls.  
> Then move the trees, the copses nod,  
>    Wings flutter, voices hover clear;  
> O just and faithful knight of God,  
>    Ride on! the prize is near."

      Let us turn now from this main theme of the picture to a detail
which is full of spiritual suggestion, and which is evidently part of
the artist's purpose. The knight as Watts depicts him, we notice, is
slim and even frail. He seems ill-fitted for the task to which he has
consecrated his life, namely to contend with the relentless and
implacable forces of evil at work in the world. An artist of duller
vision than Watts would doubtless have thought it necessary to give the
young warrior a frame less fragile, and more suggestive of robust
physical energy. But what Watts means that fragile figure to indicate is
that the mighty things of life are not the physical but spiritual. Even
in war it is the "élan vital" that counts. "Fervour," said Napoleon,
"counts against numbers on the field of battle as three to one." But
there is something which, when the human heart possesses it, more than
trebles that ratio. It is the pure heart, flaming with a lofty ideal,
and conscious of the righteousness of its cause. Nothing in this world
can compare with the impetuous valour of men thus possessed.

> "My strength is as the strength of ten,  
>       Because my heart is pure,"

cries Sir Galahad with radiant joy, and right at the entrenched forces
of evil he hurls himself, fearing God and knowing no other fear. And at
the flash of his sword the legions of darkness roll back, for no
cohorts, however consolidated, can stand against the impetuous rush of
those whose hearts are set on fire by God, who have seen the Vision, and
whose spears are levelled against iniquity. So the Sir Galahad whom
Watts with such spiritual insight depicts is youthful and frail, he
stands there, no type of massive physical force, but the possessor of a
fire within which burns up all fear of wounds or pain or death, and
which girds the weakest arm with the might of the irresistible.  
      It should not be difficult for us now to understand the purpose of
the great artist, whose sole aim in art was to impress us with spiritual
realities, in presenting this picture to Eton College. For there are
gathered many of the youth of our great Empire who in coming generations
are to guide its destinies. In these early and formative days young eyes
look out upon life with wistful questionings, and young hearts receive
their lasting spiritual impressions. It is then that the great decisions
are made, and it is upon the nature of those decisions that the future
character and stability of our Empire depend.  
      Nor can we fail to appreciate the purpose of the authorities when
on receiving the picture they determined to place it on the Chapel
walls.  
      They placed it there in the sanctuary of God in the earnest
expectation that with hearts chastened and uplifted by the solemn chants
and litanies, many might be led to make the great decision: that resting
their young eyes upon the peerless knight, and remembering all that he
was and did, they too might make the deathless choice, and say:-"I also
shall follow the Quest! I too shall serve the blameless King."  
      And oh! how great a moment this is, how full of splendour and
hope! It is not too much surely to believe, as Watts suggests, that the
thrill of it is communicated in some dim way to Nature herself, or that
the very heart-beat of God's universe is quickened by the joy of it.
"When we see a young life openly dedicating itself to God we rejoice in
the courage, the hope, and the inspiration of the beginning. The young
soldier comes like a flame to the darkened world, and a hope to the
hopeless years."

> "Girt with the fragile armour of youth,  
>    Child, you must ride into endless wars,  
> With the sword of protest, the buckler of truth,  
>    And a banner of love to sweep the stars."

      We see, then, the purpose Watts had in painting this picture; he
sought by it to awaken the heroic in the hearts of the youth of our
great Empire, he put before them an ideal of honour and chivalry which
if followed would keep their hearts unsullied by the base things of the
world, and which would lift them into companionship with Christ and all
high manhood. This was its meaning to the young men of yesterday, but to
the young men of to-day it contains a message far more urgent, and of
intensest poignancy. The picture was painted by Watts, let it be
remembered, in the piping days of peace when lowered ideals and the love
of material things threatened to corrupt the national life, and to
enfeeble its youth. Suddenly there has been heard throughout our
far-flung Empire the call "TO ARMS!" The drums have been beating in the
streets, the beacons have been flaring on the hills, and through the
mountain passes and the glens men have been rushing bearing the fiery
cross, and passing it from hand to hand. This is the hour which tests a
nation to its depths, and above all which tests the character of its
youth. In the tumult of this agitation multitudes of young men, flushed
by the intoxication of war, and swept away by its glamour, have heard
the tocsin and obeyed. But what of the Galahads? Something more than
glory in the field is required to flame their hearts. Is this a war
which appeals to them? Is it for a righteous cause? Can they hear in the
loud call "To Arms!" the inner call also of the Spirit? Or is it only
the savage lust for battle to which men must respond? Can they draw the
sword, and at the same time call upon the name of God? It is a terrible
thing to unite with the awful horrors of war the blessed name of the
Prince of Peace, and yet there are causes in which for righteousness'
sake, and for the sake of all that is holy, to draw the sword is the
bitter but only resort. Is this one of these? Who can doubt it? Who can
doubt that there is that in the call which should make every true knight
buckle on his armour, and unsheath his sword, and fight to the death?
For the fight is not for national existence alone, but for the cause of
God, for righteousness as between nations, and for humanity. Who does
not hear, to-day, the moan of the defenceless, the wail of homeless
children, the cry of the innocent for protection against a brutal army
that has reeled back to barbarism and the beast? Who does not see in
vision cities and homesteads laid desolate by a ruthless host which
knows no law but force, and which has flung every civilizing instinct
aside in its lust for power and conquest? And who, hearing these things,
and seeing these things, can stand inert, unimpassioned, uncommitted?
Who that is a man could bear to think that when the fight is over men
would point the finger of scorn at him and say:-"In this righteous cause
thou didst prove thyself a coward and a recreant knight?" Oh! not the
Galahads at least. Not the youths who listen to the voice within, and
who are of the pure in heart. To them the call comes as a challenge to
all that is most sacred in life. With hearts that are undismayed, and
with faces aglow they enter the field; their strength is as the strength
of ten; for they fight not for love of conquest, but for love of God,
for the eternal rights of man, and for the precious things of peace.

> "Oh! 'tis great to be out when the fight is strong,  
> To be where the heaviest troops belong,  
> And to fight for man and God.  
>   
> "Oh! it seams the face, and it dries the brain,  
> It strains the arm till one's friend is pain,  
>            In the fight for man and God.  
> But it's great to be out where the fight is strong."

      Before you, then, the gallant soldiers of the king, who have
responded to the call of your country, we hold up this picture of the
young knight consecrating himself to God as the ideal to be followed. To
be a Sir Galahad, remember, means first to slay the enemy within. It
means in the camp, and amid a thousand new temptations, to wear the
white flower of a blameless life. It means to win the trust and respect
of your comrades by that greatest of all tests of valour-by showing that
you are not ashamed openly to confess Him whom you love and whom you
serve. Let your sword be to you the symbol of the cross, which form it
has, and remember though it be strong to smite, its purpose is to
save.  
      Greatly as your country needs you on the field to-day not less
will it need you on that blessed morrow when peace shall be proclaimed,
and when our beloved land shall turn to heal the cruel wounds which have
drained her life. In that day when we shall be called to rebuild the
waste places, and to repair the former desolations, we shall look to you
who have proved yourselves as God's men to come to our aid. These months
of war, alas, have shown us how far as a nation we have wandered, how
deep seated has been our apostasy, how cruel are the wrongs we have left
unredressed, and the injustices which we have left unheeded. Much will
have been shaken, and with hearts purged by sorrow and loss we shall be
called to build up a better England, to lay the foundations of a nobler
Empire, and of a world-wide and enduring peace. To this great purpose
you will be called. Think not, then, to lay aside the sword; a more
cruel and implacable enemy has yet to be vanquished. Return with this
fiery purpose in your heart, and with these noble words of Blake's
burning in your brain:-

> "Bring me my bow of burning gold!  
>    Bring me my arrows of desire!  
> Bring me my spear! O clouds, unfold:  
>        Bring me my chariot of fire!  
>   
> I will not cease from mental fight,  
>    Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,  
> Till we have built Jerusalem  
>    In England's green and pleasant land."
