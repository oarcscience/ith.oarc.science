## THE QUEST OF THE GRAIL: ON THE EVE

### by

## ERNEST RHYS

  
                          "And then the king and all estates went home
unto Camelot, and so went to evensong  
                       to the great minster. And so after upon that to
supper."  
  
  
                                        I  
"Before you take this Quest," (he said), "in order set,--  
Each knight around the Table, --come, sup with me yet;  
Come, keep the feast, that after us men never shall forget!"  
  
                                        II  
Now, round the Table seated, each tall knight in his place,--  
Hears noises like to thunder, and sees a light whose rays  
Make shine his fellows by him, with brows more bright than day's.  
  
                                        III  
Not one could speak, for wonder. Then lo, within the hall  
Wrapt round with snow-white samite, the blessed Sancgreal  
And sweetest savours filled the board; and meat and drink for all.  
  
                                        IV  
The mystic Vessel like a gleam went by: it could not stay:  
And the knights all fell to feasting, and the vision passed away,  
That all shall quest, but few shall find, until the earth's last day.  
  
                                        V  
And then they fell to babbling, their hands upon their knees,  
And babbled of the morrow, and all the joy there is  
For them that quest, and ride the lands, and cross the winter seas.  
  
                                        VI  
But the tears fell down King Arthur's cheeks, as he sate with his men:  
"Ye have set me in great sorrow," said Arthur to them then:  
"For oh, I doubt, my fellowship, shall meet no more again!"
