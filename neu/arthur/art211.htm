Brittaine</i> .<br>  <br>  <br>  The Life and Death of<br>  <i> Tom Thumbe</i> .</h2> </center> <br>  Of the Birth, Name, and bringing vp of <i> Tom</i> <br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Thumbe</i> , with the meery prankes that hee<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did in his Childehood.<br>  <br>  In Arthurs Court Tom Thumbe did liue<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of mickle might,<br>  The best of all the Table round,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and eke a doughty knight:<br>  His stature but an inch in height,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or quarter of a span,<br>  Then thinke you not this little knight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was prov'd a valiant man:<br>  <br>  His Father was a Plow-man plaine<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Mother milkt the Cow,<br>  But yet the way to get a sonne<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these couple knew not how,<br>  Untill such time this good old man<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to learned Merlin goes,<br>  And there to him his deepe disires<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in secret manner showes<br>  <br>  How in his heart he wisht to haue<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Childe in time to come,<br>  To be his heire, though it might be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no bigger than his Thumbe:<br>  Of which old Merlin thus foretold,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he his wish should haue,<br>  And to this Sonne of Nature small<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Charmer to him gaue.<br>  <br>  No blood nor bones in him should be,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in shape and being such,<br>  That men should heare him speake, but not<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wandring shadow touch:<br>  But so unseene to goe or come<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas it pleasd him Nill,<br>  Begot and borne in halfe and houre,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fit his Fathers will:<br>  <br>  And in foure minutes grew so fast,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he became so tall<br>  As was the Plowmans thumbe in height,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and so they did him call,<br>  Tom Thumbe, the which Fayry-Queene,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there gaue to him his name,<br>  Who with her traine of Goblins grim,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto his Christning came.<br>  <br>  Whereas she cloath'd him richly braue,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in garments fine and faire,<br>  Which lasted him for many yeares,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in seemely sort to weare:<br>  His hat made of an Oaken leafe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his shirt a spiders web,<br>  Both light and soft, for those his limbes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were so smally bred.<br>  <br>  His hose and doublet Thistle downe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;togeather weau'd full fine,<br>  His stocking of an apple greene,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made of the outward rine;<br>  His garters were two little haires,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pull'd from his mothers eye,<br>  His bootes and shoes a mouses skin,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There tand most curiously.<br>  <br>  Thus like a lustie gallant, he<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adventured forth to goe,<br>  With other Children in the streets<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his pretty trickes to show,<br>  Where he for counters, pinus, and points,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cherry stones did play,<br>  Till he amonst those gamesters young<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had lost his stocke away:<br>  <br>  Yet could he soone renue the same,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when as most nimbly he<br>  Would diue into the Cherry-baggs,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there a taker be,<br>  Unseene or felt by any one,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untill a Scholler shut<br>  This nimble youth into a bore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein his pins be put,<br>  <br>  Of whom to be reueng'd, he tooke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(in mirth and pleasant game)<br>  Black pots, and glasses, which he hung<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon a bright Sunne-beame:<br>  The other Boyes to doe the like,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in pieces broke them quite,<br>  For which they were most soundly whipt,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereat he laught outright.<br>  <br>  And so Tom Thumbe restrained was<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from these his sports and play,<br>  And by his Mother after that<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compel'd at home to stay:<br>  Whereas about a Christmas time,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his father a Hog had kil'd,<br>  And Tom to see the puddings made,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear'd that they should be spil'd.<br>  <br>  <br>  How <i> Tom Thumbe</i>  fell into the Pudding-<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boule:  and of his escape out of the<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tinkers Budget.<br>  <br>  HE sate upon the Pudding-boule,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Candle for to hold:<br>  Of which there is unto this day,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a pretty pastime told:<br>  For Tom fell in and could not be<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that euer after found,<br>  For in the blood and batter he<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was strangely lost and drownd.<br>  <br>  Where searching long but all in vaine,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Mother after that,<br>  Into a Pudding thrust her Sonne,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in stead of minced fat:<br>  Which pudding of the largest size<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the Kettle throwne,<br>  Made all the rest to fly thereout,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as with a whirle-wine blowne.<br>  <br>  For so it tumbled up and downe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within the liquor there,<br>  As if the Devill had there been boyld,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such was his Mothers feare,<br>  That up she tooke the pudding strait,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gaue it at her doore,<br>  Unto a Tinker, which from thence<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his blacke Budget bore<br>  <br>  But as the Tinker climb'd a stile,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by chance he let a cracke:<br>  Now gip old knaue, out cride Tom Thumbe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there hanging at his backe:<br>  At which the Tinker gan to run,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and would no longer stay,<br>  But cast both bag and Pudding downe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thence hyed fast away.<br>  <br>  From which Tom Thumbe got loose at last,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and home return'd againe,<br>  Where he from following dangers long<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in safety did remaine:<br>  Untill such time his mother went<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a milking at her Kine,<br>  Where Tom unto a Thistle fast<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she linked with a twine.<br>  <br>  <br>  How <i> Tom Thumbe</i>  was tyed to a Thistle,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how his Mothers Cow eate him vp:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his strange deliverance out of the  	Cowes belly.<br>  <br>  A Thread that helde him to the same,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for feare the blustring winde<br>  Should blow him thence, that so she might,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her Sonne in safety finde:<br>  But marke the hap a Cow came by,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and up that Thistle eate.<br>  Poore Tom withall (that as a docke)<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was made the red Cowes meate:<br>  <br>  Who being mist, his Mother went<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him calling euery where,<br>  Where art thou Tom, where art thou Tom,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quoth he, Here Mother, here;<br>  Within the red Cowes belly here:<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your Sonne is swallowed by,<br>  The which into her fearefull heart,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most carefull dolours put.<br>  <br>  Meane while the Cow was troubled much,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this her tumbling wombe,<br>  And could not rest untill that she<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had backward cast Tom Thumbe:<br>  Who all besmeared as he was,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mother tooke him vp,<br>  To beare him thence, the which poore Lad,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she in her pocket put.<br>  <br>  Now after this, in sowing time,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Father would him haue<br>  Into the field to drive his plow,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thereupon him gaue<br>  A whip made of a Early straw,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to drive the Cattle on:<br>  Where in a furrow'd land new sowne,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poore Tom was lost and gon.<br>  <br>  <br>  How <i> Tom Thumbe</i>  was carried away by a Ra-<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uen; and how he was swallowed by a Giant,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with other strange accidents that befell him.<br>  <br>  Now by a Rauen of great strength<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away he thence was borne,<br>  And carried in the carrions beake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even like a graine of Corne,<br>  Unto a Giants Castle top,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which he let him fall,<br>  Where soone the Giant swallowed vp,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his body, cloathes and all.<br>  <br>  But in his belly did Tom Thumbe<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so great a rumbling make,<br>  That neither day nor night he could<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the smallest quiet take,<br>  Untill the Gyant had him spewd<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three miles into the Sea,<br>  Whereas a Fish soone tooke him up<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bore him thence away.<br>  <br>  Which lusty Fish was afeer caught,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to King Arthur sent,<br>  Where Tom was found, and made his Dwarfe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas his dayes he spent,<br>  Long time in liuely jollity,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belou'd of all the Court,<br>  And none like Tom was the esteem'd<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst the noble sort.<br>  <br>  Amongst his deedes of Courtship done,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his highnesse did command,<br>  That he should dance a Galliard braue,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon his Queenes left hand.<br>  The which he did and for the same,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the King his signet gaue,<br>  Whith Tom about about his middle wore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long time a girdle braue.<br>  <br>  Now after this the King would not<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad for pleasure goe,<br>  But still Tom Thumbe must ride with him,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plac't on his saddle bow:<br>  When on a time when as it rain'd,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Thumbe most nimbly crept<br>  In at a Button hole, where he<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within his bosome slept.<br>  <br>  And being neere his Highnesse heart,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he crau'd a wealthy boone,<br>  A liberall gift, the which the King<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded to be done,<br>  For to relieue his Fathers wants,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mothers, being old:<br>  Which was so much of silver Coyne,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well his armes could hold.<br>  <br>  And so away goes lusty Tom,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with three pence on his backe,<br>  A heauy burthen, which might make<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wearied limbes to cracke,<br>  So trauelling two dayes and nights,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with labour and great paine,<br>  He came into the house whereas<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his parents did remaine,<br>  <br>  Which was but half a mile in space,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from good Kings Arthurs Court,<br>  The which in eight and forty houres,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went in weary sort:<br>  But comming to his Fathers doore,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he there such entrance had,<br>  As made his Parents both rejoice,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he thereat was glad.<br>  <br>  His mother in her apron tooke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her gentle Sonne in haste,<br>  And by the fier side, within<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a walnut shell him plac'd:<br>  Whereas they feasted him three dayes<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon a Hazell nut,<br>  Whereon he rioted so long,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he them to charges put.<br>  <br>  And there upon grew wonderous sicke,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through eating too much meate,<br>  Which was sufficient for a month<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this great man to eate.<br>  But now his business call'd him foorth,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Arthurs Court to see,<br>  Whereas no longer from the same<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he could a stranger be.<br>  <br>  But yet a few small April drops,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which setled in the way,<br>  His long and weary journey forth,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did hinder and so stay,<br>  Untill his carefull Father tooke<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a birding trunke in sport,<br>  And with one blast blew this his Sonne<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into King Arthurs Court.<br>  <br>  <br>  Of <i> Tom Thumbs</i>  running at Tilt, with diuers o-<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ther Knightly exercises by him performed.<br>  <br>  Now he with Tilts and Turnaments<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was entertained so,<br>   That all the best of Arthurs Knights,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did him much pleasure show,<br>  As good Sir Lancelot of the Lake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Tristram, and Sir Guy,<br>  Yet none compar'd with braue Tom Thum<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Knightly Chiualry.<br>  <br>  In honour of which noble day,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for his Ladies sake,<br>  A challenge in King Arthurs Court,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Thumbe did brauely make:<br>  Gainst whom these noble Knights did run,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Chinon, and the rest,<br>  Yet still Tom Thumbe with matchles might<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did beare away the best.<br>  <br>  At last sir Lancelot of the Lake,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in manly sort came in,<br>  And with this stout and hardy knight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a battle did begin.<br>  Which made the Courtiers all agast,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for there that valiant man,<br>  Through Lancelots Steed before them all,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in nimble manner ran.<br>  <br>  Yea horse and all, with speare and shield,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as hardly he was seene,<br>  But onely by King Arthurs selfe<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his admired Queene,<br>  Who from her finger tooke a Ring,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though which Tom Thumbe made way,<br>  Not touching it in nimble sort,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was done in play.<br>  <br>  He likewise cleft the smallest haire<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from his faire Ladies head,<br>  Not hurting her, whose even hand<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him lasting honors bred:<br>  Such were his heeds and noble acts,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Arthurs Court there showne,<br>  As like in all the world beside,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was hardly seene or knowne.<br>  <br>  <br>  How <i> Tom Thumbe</i>  did take his sicknesse, and of<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Death and Buriall.<br>  <br>  Now at these sports he toyld himselfe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he a sicknesse tooke,<br>  Though which all manly exercise,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he carelessly forsooke:<br>  Where lying on his bed sore sicke,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Arthurs Doctor came,<br>  With cunning skill, by physicks art,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ease and cure the same,<br>  <br>  His body being so slender small<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this cuaning Doctor tooke<br>  A fine prospective glasse, with which<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did in secret looke<br>  Into his sickened body downe,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therein saw that death<br>  Stood ready in his wasted guts,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to cease his vitall breath,<br>  <br>  His armes and leggs consum'd as small,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as was a Spiders web,<br>  Though which his dying houre grew on,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all his limbes grew dead:<br>  His face no bigger than an Ants<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which hardly could be seene,<br>  The losse of which renowned Knight<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much grieu'd the King and Queene.<br>  <br>  And so with peace and quietnesse,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he left this earth below:<br>  And up into the Fayry Land,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his Ghost did fading goe,<br>  Whereas the Fayry Queene receiu'd,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with heauy mourning cheere,<br>  The body of this valiant Knight,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom she esteem'd so deare.<br>  <br>  For with her dancing Nimphes in greene,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she fetcht him from his bed,<br>  With musicke and sweet melody,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so soone as life was fled:<br>  For whom King Arthur and his Knights,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for forty daies did mourne,<br>  And in remembrance of his name<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was so strangely borne.<br>  <br>  He built a Tombe of Marble gray,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yeare by yeare did come<br>  To celebrate that mournefull day,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and buriall of Tom Thum:<br>  Whose fame still liues in England here,<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst the Countrey sort.<br>  Of whom our Wiues and Children small<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell tales of pleasant sport.<br>  <br>
