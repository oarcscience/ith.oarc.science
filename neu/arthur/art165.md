## JOYEUSE GARDE

### by

## ALGERNON CHARLES SWINBURNE

  
  
The sun was heavy; no more shade at all  
Than you might cover with a hollow cup  
There was in the south chamber; wall by wall,  
Slowly the hot noon filled the castle up.  
One hand among the rushes, one let play  
Where the loose gold began to swerve and droop  
From his fair mantle to the floor, she lay;  
Her face held up a little, for delight  
To feel his eyes upon it, one would say.  
Her grave shut lips were glad to be in sight  
Of Tristram's kisses; she had often turned  
Against her shifted pillows in the night  
To lessen the sore pain wherein they burned  
For want of Tristram; her great eyes had grown  
Less keen and sudden, and a hunger yearned  
Her sick face through, these wretched years agone.  
Her eyes said "Tristram" now, but her lips held  
The joy too close for any smile or moan  
To move them; she was patiently fulfilled  
With a slow pleasure that slid everwise  
Even into hands and feet, but could not build  
The house of its abiding in her eyes,  
Nor measure any music by her speech.  
Between the sunlight came a noise of flies  
To pain sleep from her, thick from peach to peach  
Upon the bare wall's hot red level, close  
Among the leaves too high for her to reach.  
So she drew in and set her feet, and rose  
Saying "Too late to sleep; I pray you speak  
To save me from the noises, lest I lose  
Some minute of this season; I am weak  
And cannot answer if you help me not,  
When the shame catches on my brow and cheek."  
For in the speaking all her face grew hot,  
And her mouth altered with some pain, I deem  
Because her word had stung like a bad thought  
That makes us recollect some bitter dream.  
She bowed to let him kiss her, and went on:  
"All things are changed so, will this day not seem  
Most sad and evil when I sit alone  
Outside your eyes? will it not vex my prayer  
To think of laughter that is twin to moan,  
And happy words that make not holier?  
Nathless I had good will to say one thing,  
Though it seems pleasant in the late warm air  
To ride alone and see the last of spring.  
I cannot lose you, Tristram; (a weak smile  
Moved her lips and went out) men say the king  
Hath set keen spies about for many a mile,  
Quick hands to get them gold, sharp eyes to see  
Where your way swerves across them. This long while  
Hath Mark grown older with his hate of me,  
And now his hand for lust to smite at us  
Plucks the white hairs inside his beard that he  
This year made thicker. Seeing this he does  
I pray you note that we may meet with him  
At riding through the branches growth, and then  
Our wine grow bitter at the golden rim  
And taste of blood and tears, not sweet to drink  
As this new honey wherein juices swim  
Of fair red vintage."  
Her voice done, I think  
He had no heart to answer; yet some time  
The noon outside them seem to throb and sink,  
Wrought in the quiet to a rounded rhyme.  
Then "certes," said he, "this were harm to both  
If spears grew thick between the beech and lime,  
Or amid reeds that let the river south,  
Yet so I think you might get help of me.  
Had I not heart to smile, when Iseult's mouth  
Kissed Palomydes under a thick tree?  
For I remember, as the wind sets low,  
How all that peril ended quietly  
In a green place where heavy sunflowers blow."
