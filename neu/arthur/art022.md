## THE WISDOM OF MERLYN

### by

## WILFRID SCAWEN BLUNT

  
  
THESE are the time-words of Merlyn, the voice of his age recorded,  
   All his wisdom of life, the fruit of tears in his youth, of joy in
his manhood hoarded,  
All the wit of his years unsealed, to the witless alms awarded.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
These are his time-gifts of song, his help to the heavy-laden,  
   Words of an expert of life, who has gathered its sins in his sack,
its virtues to grieve and gladden,  
Speaking aloud as one who is strong to the heart of man, wife and
maiden.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
For he is Merlyn of old, the once young, the still robed in glory,  
   Ancient of days though he be, with wisdom only for wealth and the
crown of his locks grown hoary,  
Yet with the rage of his soul untamed, the skill of his lips in story.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
He dares not unhouselled die, who has seen, who has known, who has
tasted  
What of the splendours of Time, of the wise wild joys of the Earth, of
the newness of pleasures quested,  
All that is neither of then nor now, Truth's naked self
clean-breasted,  
  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Things of youth and of strength, the earth with its infinite pity,  
   Glories of moutain and plain, of streams that wind from the hills to
the insolent human city,  
Dark with its traders of human woe enthroned in the seats of the
mighty.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Fair things nobler than Man before the day of his ruling,  
   Free in their ancient peace, ere he came to change, to destroy, to
hinder with his schooling,  
Asking naught that was his to give save freedom from his fooling.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Beautiful, wonderful, wise, a consonant law-ruled heaven,  
   Garden ungardened yet, in need yet hardly of God to walk there noon
or even,  
Beast and bird and flower in its place, Earth's wonders more than
seven.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Of these he would speak and confess, to the young who regard not their
heirship,  
   Of beauty to boys who are blind, of might to the impotent strong, to
the women who crowd Time's fair ship,  
Of pearls deep hid in Love's Indian seas, the name of the God they
worship.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thus let it be with Merlyn before his daylight is ended,  
   One last psalm of his life, the light of it lipped with laughter, the
might of it mixed and blended  
Still with the subtle sweet need of tears than Pleasure's self more
splendid,  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Psalm and hymn of the Earth expounding what Time teaches,  
   Creed no longer of wrath, of silent issueless hopes, of a thing which
beyond Man's reach is,  
Hope deferred till the heart grows sick, while the preacher vainly
preaches.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Nay but a logic of life, which needeth no deferring,  
   Life with its birthright love, the sun the wind and the rain in
multiple pleasure stirring  
Under the summer leaves at noon, with no sad doubt of erring.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
No sad legend of sin, since his an innocent Eden  
   Is, and a garden of grace, its gateway clear of the sword, its alleys
not angel-ridden,  
Its tree of life at the lips of all and never a fruit forbidden.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Merlyn is no vain singer to vex men's ears in the street,  
   Nay, nor a maid's unbidden. He importuneth none with his song, be it
never so wild and sweet.  
She that hath ears to hear, let her hear; he will not follow her feet.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Merlyn makes no petition. He asketh of no man alms.  
   Prince and prophet is he, a monarch, a giver of gifts, a lord of the
open palms,  
Sueth he naught, not at God's own hand, though he laudeth the Lord in
psalms.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Merlyn would speak his message only to hearts that are strong,  
   To him that hath courage to climb, who would gather time's samphire
flowers, who would venture the crags among.  
To her who would lesson her soul to fear, with love for sermon and
song.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Merlyn hath arms of pity, the weak he would hold to his soul,  
   Make them partakers of truth, of the ancient weal of the Earth, of
the life-throb from Pole to Pole.  
He would hold them close; he would dry their tears; with a kiss he would
make them whole.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thus would he sing and to thee, thou child with the eyes of passion  
   Watching his face in the dark, in the silent light of the stars,
while he in his godlike fashion  
Maketh his mock at the fears of men, nor spareth to lay the lash on.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thus would thy Merlyn devise, ere the days of his years be numbered,  
   Now at threescore and ten. He would leave his word to the world, his
soul of its load uncumbered.  
Then would he lay his ear to the grave, and sleep as his childhood
slumbered.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What is the fruit of Wisdom? To learn the proportion of things;  
   To know the ant from the lion, the whale from the crest of the wave,
the ditty the grasshopper sings  
From the chaunt of the full-fledged Paradise bird as he shakes the dew
from his wings.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
There is one thing more than knowledge, a harvest garnered by few:  
   To tutor the heart to achieve, to fashion the act to the hand, to do
and not yearn to do,  
To say to the wish of the soul "I will," to have gathered the flower
where it grew.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
I was young, and they told me "Tarry. The rash in the nets are taken.  
   If there be doubt of thy deed, abstain, lest the day of danger behold
thee by these forsaken,  
Lest thou lie in the lion's den thou hast roused, with the eyes thou
hast dared to waken.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
T hey spake, but I answered "Nay, who waiteth shall take no quarry.  
   Pleasure is fleet as the roe; in the vales he feedeth to-day, but at
night when the eyes grow weary  
Lo, he hath passed to the desolate hills; he is gone. Nay, *he* may not
tarry."  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
For Joy too needeth a net. He cometh tame to thy hand,  
   Asketh an alms of thy life, to serve thee, thy jubilant slave, if
thou wouldst but understand.  
Then is thy moment, O Man, for the noose, be it steel or a silken
band.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Therefore, where doubt is, do! Thou shalt stumble in thine endeavour  
   Ay, till thy knees be sore, thy back with the arrows of grief, and
thou stand with an empty quiver.  
Yet shall thy heart prevail through its pain, for pain is a mastering
lever.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Wouldst thou be wise, O Man? At the knees of a woman begin.  
   Her eyes shall teach thee thy road, the worth of the thing called
pleasure, the joy of the thing called sin.  
Else shalt thou go to thy grave in pain for the folly that might have
been.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
For know, the knowledge of women the beginning of wisdom is.  
   Who had seven hundred wives and concubines hundreds three, as we read
in the book of bliss?  
Solomon, wisest of men and kings, and "all of them princesses."  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Yet, be thou stronger than they. To be ruled of a woman is ill.  
   Life hath an hundred ways, beside the way of her arms, to give thee
of joy thy fill.  
Only is love of thy life the flower. Be thine the ultimate will.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
A right way is to be happy, a wrong way too. Then beware.  
   Leave the colt in his stall, he shall grow to a thankless jade, be he
never so fat and fair.  
Sloth is a crime. Rise up, young fool, and grasp thy joy by the hair.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What is the motto of youth? There is only one. Be thou strong.  
   Do thy work and achieve, with thy brain, with thy hands, with thy
heart, the deeds which to strength belong.  
Strike each day thy blow for the right, or failing strike for the
wrong.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
He that would gain let him give. The shut hand hardly shall win.  
   Open thy palms to the poor, O thou of the indigent heart. There shall
pleasure be poured therein.  
Use thy soul to the cord of joy. If thou sin must, strongly sin.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Cast thy whole heart away. The Earth, philosophers tell,  
   Leaps to a pebble thrown, be it never so little; it moved to the
bidding of that which fell.  
Throw thy heart! Thou shalt move the world, though thou fall on the
floor of Hell.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Few have the courage of loving. Faint hearts! The loss is theirs.  
   Few of their idlest whims. "I would win to Rome ere I die," one cried
in his daily cares,  
Yet plods on on 'Change to his grave, the slave of his stocks and
shares.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Learn to appraise thy desires, to weigh the wares of thy heart.  
   If thou wouldst play with pleasure, avoid Love's passionate tides,
its perilous Ocean chart,  
Hug the shores of Love's inland seas, and buy thy joys in the mart.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Love lightly, but marry at leisure. Wild Love is a flower of the field  
   Waiting all hands to gather and ours. If we leave it another will win
it and kneel where we kneeled.  
Marriage is one tame garden rose in a garden fenced and sealed.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
O thou who art sitting silent! Youth, with the eyelids of grief!  
   How shall I rouse thee to wit? Thou hast stolen the joy of our world.
Thou scornest its vain relief.  
Nay, she is here. Be thy tongue set free. Play up, thou eloquent
thief.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Doubt not thy absolution, sinner, who darest to sin.  
   So thou prevail in the end, she shall hold thee guiltless of guile, a
hero, a paladin.  
The end in her eyes hath thee justified, whatever thy means have been.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Love is of body and body, the physical passion of joy;  
   The desire of the man for the maid, her nakedness strained to his
own; the mother's who suckles her boy  
With the passionate flow of her naked breast. All else is a fraudulent
toy.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Of the house where Love is the master thy beauty may hold the key.  
   It shall open the hall-door wide, shout loud thy name to its lord.
Yet, wouldst thou its full guest be,  
Bring with thee other than beauty, wit. Then sit at the feast made
free.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
"To talk of love is to make love." Truly, a maxim of price.  
   Nathless the noblest soul, shouldst thou tell her of passionate
things and fail to gaze in her eyes,  
Shall hold thee cheap in her woman's pride, a clown for thy
courtesies.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Love hath two mountain summits, the first where pleasure was born  
   Faint in the cloud-land of light, a vision of possible hope; the
second a tempest-torn  
Crag where passion is lord and king. Betwixt them what vales forlorn!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Happiness needs to be learned. In youth the ideal woman  
   Gazed at afar was a dream, a priceless untouchable prize, while she
in your arms, too human,  
Mocked you with love. 'Tis an art learned late; alas, and the whole by
no man.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
O! thou in the purple gendered. Thou needst pain for thy case.  
   Lose thy health or thy heart. Be bowed in thy soul's despond. Be
whelmed in a world's disgrace.  
So shall thy eyes be unsealed of pride and see Love face to face.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
If thou wouldst win love, speak. She shall read the truth on thy lips.  
   Spoken vows shall prevail, the spell of thy eloquent hand, the flame
of thy finger-tips.  
Write? She is reading another's eyes while thy sad pen dips and dips.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thou hast ventured a letter of passion, in ease of thy passionate
heart?  
   Nay, be advised; there is fear, mischance in the written word, when
lovers are far apart.  
Pain is betrayed by the subtle pen where lips prevailed without art.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Love is fire. In the lighting, it raiseth a treacherous smoke,  
   Telling its tale to the world; but anon, growing clear in its flame,
may be hid by an old wife's cloak,  
And the world learn nothing more and forget the knowledge its
smouldering woke.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Comes there a trouble upon thee? Be silent, nor own the debt.  
   Friendship kicks at the goad; thy naked state is its shame; thou hast
angered these with thy fret.  
Wait. The world shall forgive thy sin. It asks but leave to forget.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
The world is an indolent house-shrew. It scolds but cares not to know  
   Whether in fancy or fact. What it thinks we have done, that it
scourges; the true thing we did it lets go.  
What matter? We fare less ill than our act, ay, all of us; more be our
woe!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
There were days when wisdom is witless, when folly is noble, sublime.  
   Let us thank the dear gods for our madness, the rush of the blood in
our veins, the exuberant pulsings of Time,  
And pray, while we sin the forbidden sin, we be spared our penance of
crime.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
There are habits and customs of passion. Long loves are a tyrannous
debt.  
   But to some there is custom of change, the desire of the untrodden
ways, with sunshine of days that were wet,  
Of the four fair wives of love's kindly law by licence of Mahomet.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Experience all is of use, save one, to have angered a friend.  
   Break thy heart for a maid; another shall love thee anon. The gold
shall return thou didst spend,  
Ay, and thy beaten back grow whole. But friendship's grave is the end.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Why do I love thee, brother? We have shared what things in our youth,  
   Battle and siege and triumph, together, always together, in
wanderings North and South.  
But one thing shared binds nearer than all, the kisses of one sweet
mouth.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
He that hath loved the mother shall love the daughter no less,  
   Sister the younger sister. There are tones how sweet to his ear,
gestures that plead and press,  
Echoes fraught with remembered things that cry in the silences.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Fly from thy friend in his fortune, his first days of wealth, of fame;  
   Or, if thou needest to meet him, do thou as the children of Noah,
walk backwards and guard thee from blame.  
He who saw found forgiveness none. With thee it were haply the same.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Bridegroom, thy pride is unseemly. Thou boastest abroad, with a smile,  
   Thou hast read our humanity's riddle. Nay, wait yet a year with thy
bride; she shall lesson thee wiser the while.  
Then shalt thou blush for thy words to-day, the shame of thy innocent
guile.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
The love of a girl is a taper lit on a windy night.  
   Awhile it lightens our darkness, consoles with its pure sudden flame,
and the shadows around it grow white.  
Anon with a rain-gust of tears it is gone, and we blink more blind for
the light.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Sage, thou art proud of thy knowledge, what mountains and marvels
seen!  
   Thou hast loved how madly, how often! hast known what wiles of the
heart, what ways of maid, wife and quean!  
Yet shalt thou still be betrayed by love, befooled like a boy on the
green.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Oh, there is honour in all love. Have lips once kissed thee, be dumb,  
   Save in their only praise. To cheapen the thing thou hast loved is to
bite at thyself thy thumb,  
To shout thy own fool's fault to the world, and beat thy shame on a
drum.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Who hath dared mock at thy beauty, Lady? Who deemeth thee old?  
   If he had seen thee anon in the tender light of thine eyes, as I saw
thee, what tales had he told  
Of ruined kingdoms and kings for one, of misers spending their gold!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Friendship or Love? You ask it: which binds with the stronger tether?  
   Friendship? Thy comrade of youth, who laughed with thee on thy road?
What ailed him in that rough weather,  
When to thy bosom Love's angel crept, twin tragedies locked together?  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Friendship is fostered with gifts. Be it so; little presents? Yes.  
   Friendship! But ah, not Love, since love is itself Love's gift and it
angereth him to have less.  
Woe to the lover who dares to bring more wealth than his tenderness.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
This to the woman: Forbear his gifts, the man's thou wouldst hold.  
   Cheerfully he shall give and thou nothing guess, yet anon he shall
weigh thee in scales of his gold.  
Woe to thee then if the charge be more than a heartache's cost all
told.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thou art tempted, a passion unworthy? Long struggle hath dulled thy
brain?  
   How shalt thou save thee, poor soul? How buy back the peace of thy
days? If of rest thou be fain,  
Oft is there virtue in yielding all; thou shalt not be tempted again.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Sacrifice truly is noble. Yet, Lady, ponder thy fate.  
   Many a victory, won in tears by her who forbore, hath ruined her
soul's estate.  
Virtue's prize was too dear a whim, the price agreed to too great.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Virtue or vice? Which, think you, should need more veil for her face?  
   Virtue hath little fear; she goeth in unchaste guise; she ventureth
all disgrace.  
Poor Vice hid in her shame sits dumb while a stranger taketh her
place.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Chastity? Who is unchaste? The church-wed wife, without blame  
   Yielding her body nightly, a lack-love indolent prize, to the lord of
her legal shame?  
Or she, the outlawed passionate soul? Their carnal act is the same.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Whence is our fountain of tears? We weep in childhood for pain,  
   Anon for triumph in manhood, the sudden glory of praise, the giant
mastered and slain.  
Age weeps only for love renewed and pleasure come back again.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What is our personal self? A fading record of days  
   Held in our single brain, memory linked with memory back to our
childhood's ways.  
Beyond it what? A tradition blurred of gossip and nursemaid says.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Why dost thou plain of thine age, O thou with the beard that is thin?  
   Art thou alone in thy home? Is there none at thy side, not one, to
deem thee a man among men?  
Nay, thou art young while she holds thy hand, be thy years the
threescore and ten.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
The world is untimely contrived. It gives us our sunshine in summer,  
   Its laughing face in our youth, when we need it not to be gay, being
each one his own best mummer.  
All its frown is for life that goes, its smile for the last new comer.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Europe a horologe is, ill mounted and clogged with grime,  
   Asia a clock run down. Its hands on the dial are still; its hours are
told by no chime.  
Nathless, twice in the twenty-four, it shall tell thee exactly the
time.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What is the profit of knowledge? Ah none, though to know not is pain!  
   We grieve like a child in the dark; we grope for a chink at the door,
for a way of escape from the chain;  
We beat on life's lock with our bleeding hands, till it opens. And where
is the gain?  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
I have tried all pleasures but one, the last and sweetest; it waits.  
   Childhood, the childhood of age, to totter again on the lawns, to
have done with the loves and the hates,  
To gather the daisies, and drop them, and sleep on the nursing knees of
Fates.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
I asked of the wise man "Tell me, what age is the age of pleasure?  
   Twenty years have I lived. I have spread my meshes in vain. I have
taken a paltry treasure.  
Where is the heart of the gold?" And he, "I will tell thee anon at
leisure."  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
I pleaded at thirty "Listen. I have played, I have lost, I have won.  
   I have loved in joy and sorrow. My life is a burden grown with the
thought of its sands outrun.  
Where is the joy of our years? At forty? "Say it is just begun."  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
At forty I made love's mourning. I stood alone with my foes,  
    Foot to fooot with my Fate, as a man at grips with a man, returning
blows for blows  
In the joy of battle "'Tis here" I cried. But the wise man, "Nay, who
knows?"  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
At fifty I walked sedately. At sixty I took my rest.  
   I had learned the good with the evil. I troubled my soul no more, I
had reached the Isles of the Blest.  
The sage was dead who had warned my fears. I was wise, I too, with the
best.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What do we know of Being? Our own? How short lived, how base!  
   That which is not our own? The eternal enrolment of stars, the voids
and the silences!  
The enormous might of the mindless globes whirling through infinite
space!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
The infinite Great overhead, the infinite Little beneath!  
   The turn of the cellular germ, the giddy evolving of life in the
intricate struggle for breath,  
The microbe, the mote alive in the blood, the eyeless atom of death!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Yet which is the greater Being? We have dreamed of a life-giving God,  
   Him, the mind of the Sun, the conscious brain-flower of Space, with a
cosmic form and abode,  
With thought and pity and power of will, Humanity's ethical code.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
We have dreamed, but we do not believe. Be He here, be He not, 'tis as
one.  
   His Godhead, how does it help? He is far. He is blind to our need.
Nay, nay, He is less than the Sun,  
Less than the least of the tremulous stars, than our old scorned idols
of stone.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
For He heareth not, nor seeth. As we to the motes in our blood,  
   So is He to our lives, a possible symbol of power, a formula half
understood.  
But the voice of Him, where? the hand grip, where? A child's cry lost in
a wood.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Therefore is Matter monarch, the eternal the infinite Thing,  
   The "I that am" which reigneth, which showeth no shadow of change,
while humanities wane and spring,  
Which saith "Make no vain Gods before me, who only am Lord and King."  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What then is Merlyn's message, his word to thee weary of pain,  
   Man, on thy desolate march, thy search for an adequate cause, for a
thread, for a guiding rein,  
Still in the maze of thy doubts and fears, to bring thee thy joy
again?  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thou hast tried to climb to the sky; thou hast called it a firmament;  
   Thou hast found it a thing infirm, a heaven which is no haven, a
bladder punctured and rent,  
A mansion frail as the rainbow mist, as thy own soul impotent.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Thou hast clung to a dream in thy tears; thou hast stayed thy rage with
a hope;  
   Thou hast anchored thy wreck to a reed, a cobweb spread for thy sail,
with sand for thy salvage rope;  
Thou hast made thy course with a compass marred, a toy for thy
telescope.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
What hast thou done with thy days? Bethink thee, Man, that alone,  
   Thou of all sentient things, hast learned to grieve in thy joy, hast
earned thee the malison  
Of going sad without cause of pain, a weeper and woe-begone.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Why? For the dream of a dream of another than this fair life  
   Joyous to all but thee, by every creature beloved in its spring-time
of passion rife,  
By every creature but only thee, sad husband with sadder wife,  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Scared at thought of the end, at the simple logic of death,  
   Scared at the old Earth's arms outstretched to hold thee again, thou
child of an hour, of a breath,  
Seeking refuge with all but her, the mother that comforteth.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Merlyn's message is this: he would bid thee have done with pride.  
   What has it brought thee but grief, thy parentage with the Gods, thy
kinship with beasts denied?  
What thy lore of a life to come in a cloud-word deified?  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
O thou child which art Man, distraught with a shadow of ill!  
   O thou fool of thy dreams, thou gatherer rarely of flowers but of
fungi of evil smell,  
Poison growths of the autumn woods, rank mandrake and mort-morell!  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
Take thy joy with the rest, the bird, the beast of the field,  
   Each one wiser than thou, which frolic in no dismay, which seize what
the seasons yield,  
And lay thee down when thy day is done content with the unrevealed.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
Take the thing which thou hast. Forget thy kingdom unseen.  
   Lean thy lips on the Earth; she shall bring new peace to thy eyes
with her healing vesture green.  
Drink once more at her fount of love, the one true hippocrene.  
  
                          \*                                  \*
                                 \*  
  
O thou child of thy fears! Nay, shame on thy childish part  
   Weeping when called to thy bed. Take cheer. When the shadows come,
when the crowd is leaving the mart,  
Then shalt thou learn that thou needest sleep, Death's kindly arms for
thy heart.  
  
  
                                                                    THE
END
