PREFACE.

  
THE most romantic period of English history is surely that chronicled by
Geoffrey of Monmouth, sung by Alfred Tennyson, put into modern story by
Sidney Lanier, and told in pictures by Abbey--the days of the knightly
and royal Arthur of Britain.  
   To ascertain, as nearly as may be, the real truth of that time, and
embody a typical part of it in the guise of modern fiction, has been the
labor of years, that has finally found expression by the writer in this
romance of love and valor--the story of Prince Cian of the mistletoe
crest, Cian of the Chariots.  
   That it may make more real the deeds of that remote and misty time
when the last wave of Roman occupation was receding from Britain, when,
between Rome and barbarism, between Christianity and heathendom, stood
only the conquering sword of that splendid knight of the Round Table and
the Holy Grail, Arthur the Emperor, is the hope of the author, who here
presents the old tale in modern dress for modern readers.  
   It was a stirring and pivotal time. In *The Two*  
  
Page 4  
  
*Lost Centuries of Britain* we read: "The true story of the Arthurian
campaigns would seem to be this. At the same time with the grand assault
of Cerdic at Netley, or in the confusion following the death of Ambrose,
the northern Saxons came crowding down. Arthur, issuing from Caer Lerion
(formerly Ratae, now Leicester), met their army as it crossed the valley
of the Glem; drove it back to the mouth of that stream, and there
inflicted on the shore of the Wash a defeat whereby men chiefly
remembered the campaign. The Saxons may have taken to their boats and
escaped him by sea. One result of his victory was the relief of
Caer-lud-coit (Lindom, Lincoln), which had long been standing isolated
beyond the true border. No doubt the uplands of Lincolnshire were
regained.  
   "At the west the border-line had been carried back to the Mersey.
Chester was in danger. The young general went to its relief; took the
offensive; pressed the Saxons northward to the Duglas, and struck them a
severe blow near Wigan. Perhaps for the time he drove them from the
little valley.  
   "But they returned in greater force the next season, and the next,
and the next. The bone of contention was there, in spite of indecisive
victory, until at last he was able to drive them bodily north as far as
Westmoreland. A final success on the Pesa made a complete clearance of
all that region.  
  
Page 5  
  
   "But the Deirans of York were unbroken as yet, although beaten back
along both lines of approach. They invented a third, by way of surprise,
and fell into a trap, whence, by all accounts, none issued alive and
free. Hardly any event made a deeper impress on the minds of that
generation than this total overthrow in the haunted wood of Celidon.  
   "Now the scene moves to the southward. At this time Arthur may first
have been formally invested with the supreme command throughout Britain.
As Guledig, or Imperator, what a claim London must have had upon him;
the most renowned of all his cities, though fallen into decay; the most
recalcitrant, and thus in need of conciliation; the most endangered, so
requiring aid. He found her with the enemy before the walls, the
irrational hope of superstition in her heart."  
   Our story opens after the battle of the Pesa or Bassa, and while both
sides were gathering their forces, and beginning to move toward that
still more decisive encounter in the wood of Celidon. Arthur, already
Emperor, has sent Cian and Llywarch as envoys to summon the aid of the
semi-independent city.  
   All else that is needful will reveal itself as the story goes on.

CHAPTER I.  
  
CIAN TO THE RESCUE.  
  
Thou Guider of the chariot of Arthur.  
                                --GILDER.

  
  
RED through the fringe of the river of mist, it shone to the eye of
Cian, Arthur's fighting man, Briton of Britons, prince and poet of the
north. The sunset was on him. He had halted a little over the round of
the hill, where the ancient Ermine way came southward out of the
woods.  
   He marvelled at the unwholesome ruddiness in that dying light, the
parti-colored streaking of distemper, the ruinous upjutting of wall and
house-top bathed in the dimming vapor. Only in one spot a white tower,
delicately strong, lifted itself high above the reek. He knew it for the
work of a people whom he did not love, a race that had but lately melted
from the land, with its magic of beauty and of power. And still the
vapor shroud flowed on above the liv-  
  
Page 10  
  
ing stream, and the town enfeebled and hidden, until it spread over the
eastern marshes like an inland sea.  
   The soul of London seemed melting by him, and away. He called to mind
the young strength and glory of Camelot, the ripe splendor of far
Caerleon. Words of forecast came to him, as they came full often and
strangely. He said aloud, "A city in its winding-sheet; a dying city."  
   A strong figure was that of Cian Gwenclan; every way memorable. Cian
of the chariots, men oftenest called him; Cian of the golden mail, from
the flexile body-garment,--a filmy corselet hiding the good bronze or
steel,--which burned even now in the low sunbeams. Over the heart a
single spray of mistletoe was wrought in silver. It had a magical look
and name. This repute often befriended him.  
   His chariot stood near,--for almost alone among northern princes he
fought and journeyed in the light rushing war-vehicle of elder
Britain,--the brown horse turning from the light, the carven boar's head
grinning on the front of it, the helmet and weapons glowing within where
he had flung them down.  
   His eyes were deep, dark, and bright in that western glow, his face
dark and vivid also,--a warrior-minstrel face of action and many
musings. The hair fell to his shoulders in masses, fine, glossy black,
gently waving. He wore the long mustache also of his time. He had the
bearing and stature befitting  
  
Page 11  
  
an equestrian of Arthur's court, a veteran of rough campaigns.  
   There came a patter of hoofs behind; and Llywarch of Argoed, in the
saddle, drew up at his side. Llywarch had the fuller outline, a trifle
the lesser height. His raised visor showed a younger-looking
countenance, winning and flushed. The heart shone out of it. There were
mischief and waywardness in the hazel eyes, but also uprightness and
clear wisdom at need. Like his friend Cian and many others of their
rank, in that romantic day, he touched the harp-strings, and put words
of melody to them; although not yet had suffering and loss wrung from
him that enduring poetry which later ages associate with his name.  
   "Not the cheerfullest of places," quoth he, with a glance at the
city. "Yet after all it is no more than water in the air. And
you--hatching prophecy and destruction, I warrant? You look it."  
   Cian regained his seat, and replied: "I have been waiting for a man
who has time to follow stray footmarks in the woods, when the emperor
sends him."  
   Llywarch grew sober. "It was an archer who made that footprint," said
he, "a lively fellow who can hit his mark from a swaying bough. See
here," and he put his finger to an arrow-dent in his casque. "By the
time I was right in the saddle again my grinning marksman was gone. I
followed as far as  
  
Page 12  
  
a brookside, but that was all of him. I began to fear that he would let
fly at me out of the water."  
   "A Saxon?"  
   "Not a doubt of that."  
   "So near the great city? When the stag weakens, the wolves gather.
Listen."  
   They looked at each other, as the cry of a wolf indeed came
lugubriously from the depth of the wood. As they rode on, it opened
again, with purpose in it; then another and another, a succession of
racing voices.  
   They were descending a tongue of the highlands which tapered very
gradually into the marsh by the northern wall. On their left a
depression deepened and widened into a ravine, where mist-films were
drifting, and water murmured. Beyond it, farther down, they could
discern the outline of some large low building. Lights were coming out
in it. Beyond, masses which might be villa ruins half showed themselves.
But everything grew momently thicker to the sight, and, indeed, could
scarcely be seen with certainty at all, unless it stood on high ground
in the very eye of the west.  
   They had neither met nor passed any wayfarer. The road was all their
own. No sound came to them but of the wolves, the low-complaining
runnel, and the uneasy soul of London, murmuring. It was a region where
great wealth had been and should be  
  
Page 13  
  
again, but not the remotest wilderness could be more lonesome and
desolate.  
   "Are they after us, I wonder?" queried Llywarch, with a smile; for
armed and mailed men had no need to concern themselves at that season.
It was comical to be wolf-hunted, with an emperor's despatches, into one
of the great cities of the world.  
   "Hardly," answered Cian. "It seems rather like the purposeless
demon-hunting of old tales and winter nights. Listen. See."  
   He pointed down obliquely to where that sinister hurrying chorus came
up again from the slant of the farther side. Fancy and eye-straining
gave them vision of dim, long, swollen figures, making forward
ravenously. The lights of the villa were seen in sudden motion, and
voices called with anxious inquiry and dismay. The horses meanwhile made
wild haste down the road, the mere presence of the wolves being more
than any whip or spur.  
   Then from over the gulf came the scream of a child and a woman's call
for aid, in evident extremity of need. They shouted back, and plunged
down together, uncertain of obstacles, forcing the horses on as into the
shock of battle. As they went they could hear before them exclamations
of horror and repulsion, the child's broken wailing, and the ring of
metal on stone; but no more call to them, for the woman knew they were
coming.  
  
Page 14  
   Only as Cian sped up alone over the crest, a glad cry broke from her.
He saw the sweep of a great weapon, and heard a brutish howl. Then his
right wheel struck and shattered, the chariot spun round, pitching over,
and he barely saved himself by a forward leap. That landed him among the
already scattering pack, and his sword cut into them right and left, as
he made his way to her.  
   He had not, for long, the picture before him there which abode in
memory always. Where some white goddess had toppled over in the ruin of
the villa garden, on the tall pedestal the lady towered above her
crouching sister, the over-heavy battle-axe shearing every way in her
hands, a divine maid, the very genius of armed and wrathful
protection.  
   Instantly her enemies were gone. The mist of the deep hollow received
them. With long breaths, she dropped her weapon behind her, and leaned
back on the helve of it, unhurt, her brow smoothing itself, and a smile
growing in her face, but weariness growing also.  
   "I cannot tell you how I thank you," she said, with labor, as he came
near, holding out hands of aid. "Go, Sylvia," she added faintly.  
   Pretty Sylvia was still in the bewilderment of terror; but she
glanced upward at her tall sister in new concern and surprise,--for how
could weakness be there? Then she gave herself, nestling and shudder-  
  
Page 15  
  
ing, to the arms of the stranger. When he had set her down beside him,
she remained watchful and silent, except for a word of
persuasion,--"Aurelia! Aurelia!"--as he reached up his hands again.  
   "I must be a Saxon this time, and rob the pedestal," said he
reassuringly.  
   She waved his hand aside with a smile, then laid her own on his
shoulder to descend." I would rather *not* be pulled down and broken.
That is the Saxon way," said she.  
   But she lingered, swaying.  
   He watched her, fearing a fall, and ready; yet answered," I do not
carry my animosity so far. Though I have little love for Roman gods, old
or new."  
    "Then I will be Hecate no longer," she said, laughing weakly, and
let herself down with a half spring.  
   It was her utmost endeavor. As her feet touched the ground, she bent,
and would have quite fallen, but for his arm thrown around her. She had
no choice but to rest against him a moment.  
   "The goddess of feebleness, if there ever was one!" she murmured
ruefully.  
   I am Cian Gwenclan," he said. "Rest easy. Breath and vigor will come
again."  
   Small wonder if he were not very eager for that revival, her face
being very near his shoulder, her  
  
Page 16  
  
form close against his own. Her imperial womanliness, unwillingly
appealing, carried his whole nature by storm. In all his stirring life,
Cian had never felt so almost fiercely happy.  
   "Cian of the Chariots? Prince Cian of the golden mail, whom we have
heard about?" she said after an interval; then she straightened herself,
remembering that this knowledge had first come by touch. But she added
frankly, "Before you spoke I knew you. My name you have heard. My father
is Constantine the merchant, grandson of Constans, who was Cæsar, as you
know. And to-night--but that does not matter. Our home is just above,
the only one left near. But for you, the wolves would have torn us."  
   There was an involuntary movement toward him, but she felt the little
one pulling distressfully at her tunic.  
   "What makes him smile so?" demanded Sylvia. "I don't like him to
smile that way."  
   She did not mean Cian, though some such odd notion at first came into
his mind. Her gaze was on a dark wolf-form which lay twitching, too low
for them to see plainly. Cian took up the axe, and ended it at a blow.  
   "That was hardly needed," he said. "You should be a warrior maiden of
olden time, such as the legends tell."  
  
Page 17  
  
   "It was the weapon," she said. "I picked up that massive thing, as I
hurried out after our truant."  
   "Massive--yes! And I have borne arms up the hills by the Duglas, and
in the deep sands of the Glem."  
   By this time lights and voices were wandering anxiously. She called
back to them. Cian added his voice, "Ho, Llywarch!" as they with Sylvia
began moving away.  
   For answer the horse of the prince of Argoed came and stood riderless
before them. Cian gave a quick cry; then called vehemently, "Llywarch!
Llywarch! Llywarch!"  
   In the confusion of voices now centring on them he could not find
that of his friend; but a sound of savage worrying came up out of the
hollow. He wavered for a moment. "Go!" said she, and he began rushing
down the slope. At a little distance the answer of Llywarch halted him;
and as Cian turned aside, the two were together.  
   "The child--the woman?" Llywarch demanded.  
   "Safe,--but I feared"--  
    "What, that the messenger of Arthur had gone to the wolves? No, man,
I am all here--and rather more of me by weight than formerly. For I have
been headlong into the mire, I promise you."  
   "But what is that?" indicating the noise below.  
  
Page 18  
  
   "I cannot say. Let us see."  
   Guided by ear, they came presently on a clump of dark bodies in
turmoil, working away mercilessly at something on the ground. Cian had
drawn back his sword, when lantern-light shone on it and its living
target. Several voices called on him to forbear. "They are our brave
house-guards," Aurelia explained, as she joined them. "Off, Dorwach!
Here, Juno!"  
   They were beyond mistaking now. The body of the great mastiff was too
thick and furry for any of his wild kin; and though the hound, his
companion, was leaner and smoother, no wolf ever came thus gambolling
about a mistress. Little Sylvia screamed, for there was blood all over
their jaws, and the lamplight made it vivid, while their antics brought
it very near.  
   "One of the wounded enemy," said Llywarch, bending over something
which they had left. "Served as Caowl, the woodlander, would serve a
Saxon. I have no liking for that inhuman way."  
   "The dogs have done well," said one of the attendants, in surly
protest.  
   "Well for dogs with wolves," replied Aurelia. " Not so well for men
with men. You see," she added, turning to the gentlemen, "our people
have no wish to be the thralls of sea-robbers."  
   Llywarch was examining the dead wolf closely.  
  
Page 19  
  
"A strong blow," said he. " I marvel the beast got so far. Shoulder
bitten through from in front--blade-bitten. Chest laid half open. A
strong blow--yet not a man's blow," he added, raising himself
inquiringly.  
   "I remember the frightful creature," said Aurelia, quivering a
little. "He was the worst of them."  
   "This is the lady whose father we were bidden to have speech with,"
said Cian, and presented his friend in due form.  
   "Also," remarked Llywarch, "the lady who saved herself while two
fighting men of Arthur's camp were making a poor pretence of coming to
her aid." He drew his face down ruefully.  
   "I was not stuck in a bog," observed Cian.  
   For indeed all the upper part of Prince Llywarch was eloquent beyond
expounding, the helmet, especially, being two or three of itself in
mass, notwithstanding a continual dislodgement. The domestics began
laughing. Even Aurelia half joined. "Come," said she, "we who caused
your distress at least will relieve it. Surely you will go no farther
now."  
   Llywarch shook his head. "Our first charge is to deliver, somewhat
within the gates," he said. "To our grief, we may not tarry--unless
there be other noble damsels by the way who keep tryst with wild animals
in the dark."  
  
Page 20  
  
   "You will find none," she said; "all is waste between here and the
walls."  
   "And you linger on with the wolves?"  
   "We linger. But they rarely come ravening like this. It is held an
evil sign."  
   "Of the Saxon?"  
   "So say our people; and there has been dreadful work eastward.
However, by day all is yet safe here from man and beast. This is a rare
place for play, and garden flowers run wild. No doubt Sylvia slipped off
on some such quest, and lingered until the twilight surprised her. Was
it not so, Sylvia?"  
   The child began to whimper at the remembrance. "Let us go home; do
let us go home," was her imploring cry.  
   "Patience, darling. Yet I, too, think that would be well. Gentlemen,
I urge no one from duty; but since you have errands with my father, we
may perhaps hope to see you soon again."  
   "But is he not at the city?"  
   "Yes; and it is as well. Though if spared the wolf-howling and
worrying"--  
   "He enjoys other fraternal sounds. There they are again."  
   From distant London angry calls came confusedly.  
   "Yes," she replied with a sigh; "farewell, until you return--with my
gratitude."  
  
Page 21  
  
   "Ours, much rather," said Cian and Llywarch in a breath.  
   As they spoke she turned away with her men. From the other side the
princes' horses were brought. There was a saddle on Cian's already. It
was bridled also. They regained the road easily, and pressed on again.  
   "A surpassing woman!" commented Llywarch, after silence.  
   "Imperial," assented Cian. "Hence our errand, it may be." The words
had an ill taste evidently.  
   "Cian," said Llywarch with seriousness, "it is hardly for us to
judge. But the emperor will not, I deem, look outside of the house of
Caradoc. He can very ill spare the right arm of his realm and host; but
he knows if there were one man here such as she, London would count for
Britain."  
   "There is her father."  
   "He is the last you should praise. Rome has gone. You cannot turn the
stream backward. That is what Constantine seeks to do. Nevertheless, he
may have a trial."  
   But there was more against Constantine than his worship of old. He
had thriven vastly in trade, whatever his claim by birth, beginning with
hidden stores put by in the great exodus with the legions, to be found
by those who knew. He could marshal wealth and the wealth-bringers
mightily and with  
  
Page 22  
  
skill; and very proud he was of some resemblance in feature to that
great Julius who crossed the Rubicon into empire. But the dread of loss
came easily to him; and he had the trader's instinct to conciliate and
bargain, rather than the iron hand of the soldier, holding its purpose
with firm grip unto the end.

CHAPTER II  
  
WITH THE GUARD OF THE GATE.  
  
Of manly disposition was the youth.  
                         --ANEURIN.

  
THE two travellers passed from the high ground to the causeway which
pierced the strip of marsh that lay just beyond the city wall at and
near the Ermine gate. The air was foul, the fog wrapping them closely.
Dim forms, which might mean anything, even fancy, brushed by them. All
sounds were muffled. Those ahead, though near, had seemingly grown more
distant. The wall, when at last it loomed over them, was very welcome.  
   Ascending a little, they entered a broad gateway. A light shone
transversely. They saw before them the glint of crossing metal, and the
two helmeted spearmen who thus barred their way. The customary challenge
was given.  
   "We are friends," answered Llywarch, "and glad enough to get in out
of the corpse-breath. We are officers of Arthur the Emperor, too, no
matter what we may look like in this guise."  
   His eyes ran dismally over himself.  
  
Page 24  
  
   "Moreover, we bear a letter from him to your city rulers," added
Cian.  
   The soldiers were opening the way, awed, yet grinning as often as
their eyes met the figure of the miry Prince of Argoed; but one came
forward, lantern in hand, with a light, quick step, at whose gesture the
spear-points dropped again.  
   "Your first words," he said, "would have let you through over
willingly, for a British fighting man is of all men the most welcome
just now. And I do not doubt you shall have the greater honor for slight
delay. But this is matter of moment, it would seem, and must be referred
to the captain of the guard. Call him;" and he turned to one of the
men.  
   They could see that he had a slight figure, unarmored, as though he
had risen in haste to make inquiry; a young subaltern, it was plain, and
of a type to hold boyishness well into riper years. Close-curling hair
between red and gold, a light pointed mustache, an alert, intelligent
face, a mantle of rich red stuff and tossing embroidery, a general
impression of quick motion and brightness,--these made up the rest of
the half-shadowed picture. All his attire ran very near a delicate
foppery. A two-edged sword of the old leaf pattern hung sheathed from
his side. His belt bore also a dagger and an elfin-like forester's
horn.  
   Cian looked him over, with sudden recognition.  
  
Page 25  
  
   "I know you very well, Dynan, son of the Three Shouts; it seems,
though, you do not remember me."  
   Dynan's face lighted responsively. He stepped forward, offering his
hand.  
   "How should I know you," he answered, " without your chariot, and
back yonder in the shadow. Moreover, you have thrown something around
the natural golden glitter of you," as indeed the dense fog had
prompted.  
   "And this," he continued, "Llywarch of Argoed, surely!--in
misfortune?" and he began to laugh.  
   "Yes, Llywarch, who swam the Duglas with you to get at certain
Saxons. He would like to swim a few more rivers just now. Known at
present as Llywarch the Wallower."  
   "We thought you had gone home," said Cian.  
   "Rightly," answered Dynan. "But who could stay there? By the time all
my neighbors had quarrelled with me because I wouldn't make fairy gold
according to my lineage, and hadn't any coin of my own, I found it best
to do my fighting farther away, in town-service.  
    "And so you chose London!" suggested Llywarch disparagingly.  
   Dynan raised his eyes with a quick movement. "Not first nor most
wisely," said he. "I have eaten the bread of Caer Segeint the Beautiful.
I have held  
  
Page 26  
  
the gates, also, of the White Town of the Wrekon, the Shining City. But
this--I call it the sulking den, the cave of unreason, the hive that
quarrels inwardly, unappeasably."  
   "Don't snarl at the paymaster, lad. Never do that," announced a
strong voice, nearing them. A hand was laid familiarly on Dynan's
shoulder--a hand with a strong tendency to grip, and showing the
knuckles over plainly; for this Osburn the Frank was a very oak of a
man, everything about him giving the impression of rooted strength. He
had a large forehead over keen blue eyes, and a way of thrusting out his
long chin, as he uttered his curt sentences. His broad, bony face was
bearded all over with stubble, in contrast to the mustachioed Britons.  
   "I am centurion of the gate," he explained." That is all just now.
Where I am put, I stay. Where I am sent, I go. And I don't growl about
it. I don't, if the money comes. What, then, have you brought us?"  
   "A letter-imperial from Arthur, our emperor," answered Llywarch
formally. "It is addressed to the ruler or rulers of London, by his or
their proper style or title, whosoever and whatsoever he or they--and
it--may be."  
   Osburn's face twitched with grim enjoyment.  
   "The council is trying to find out," he replied dryly." They will
scarce hear you to-night."  
  
Page 27  
  
   "I pray you arrange for audience to-morrow then," said Cian. "The
emperor will bear no trifling."  
   "Amen!" responded Osburn. "A strong hand is needed. Dynan, see who is
uppermost at the basilica. If Constantine, all will be well. Tell him.
If not--the best you can. Shout, if beset. Any one of the three
shouts,--your inheritance."  
   Dynan laughed. "About all of it, except a fund of tolerance for bad
jokes."  
   Forthwith he was gone for his armor.  
   Following Osburn, who followed Dynan, the envoys entered, through a
narrow side passage, a lighted guard-room in a bastion-like thickening
of the wall. Here all seemed in practicable order and readiness. Armor,
chiefly bronze, hung on the walls with a reddening gleam. Weapons were
shining where they leaned together in corners or from racks that held
them. Large men of divers aspects, though sufficiently alike in attire,
sat about or lounged or stood. One pair of them looked up from a board
of draughts, or some such game. A soldierly set, but gathered from
everywhere, for a few seemed Britons.  
   Osburn turned to Llywarch: "Better leave your shell, it needs
brightening;" and, at the word, one came forward, grimacing, to render
aid. It was not possible to look at the mud-caked paladin very solemnly.
He took their mirth cheerily, as usual.  
   Presently they were ushered into what had been  
  
Page 28  
  
a series of cells, where, on the smallest possible scale, the Roman
officers had persisted of old in their elaborate bathing system. The
ornaments were mostly plastered over now, and the partitions knocked
down for greater elbow room; but water was to be had very amply.  
   Passing thence to the dining-hall, they found it absurdly narrow for
its length, as the conditions compelled. The mural paintings were
preserved, though fading; two long processionals, which could never have
been very good. On the board sundry Roman pieces of varying merit still
held their ground amid spoils of raid or purchase, mementos brought from
over sea, and chance findings of every kind, a very strange medley. A
vase of coralline Samian ware, with hunting scenes winding over it,
beside a green-ribbed Saxon goblet, translucent and tapering slenderly;
a silver platen alive with racing nymphs under an acorn-shaped cup,
older than the Celts, of polished Kimmeridge coal.  
   Two other officers awaited them at supper; and soon the soldiers off
guard came in, taking the lower seats.  
   The talk began, wandered, then came to an end. All saw that Osburn
was listening uneasily. At last he held up Dynan's elfin
horn--transparent as the summer heaven, yet threaded with wild
scrollwork of fire.  
  
Page 29  
  
   "He has left what some call his luck," said Osburn gravely, neither
denying nor affirming, as became a man who had served respectfully under
many gods, and knew that strange influences were astir among men.  
   "But we have it, and he goes on our errand," answered Llywarch.  
   "Do you thus read the omen?"  
   "God forbid that we should waste time in construing what a few
minutes will reveal. But ask Cian, if you will. He has been to the
Druids."  
   One of the lesser officers looked at Cian with heightened interest.
The other made the sign of the cross.  
   Cian's lip twitched. "Oh, this horn is not of the devil," said he.
"You know the tale."  
   "Not certainly," said Osburn.  
   "Then *my* prophecy is that Llywarch, being glib of tongue and smooth
of humor, will surely tell you."  
   Llywarch bowed low, but fell in with their wish. "Before our time,"
he said, "there were dwarfs and elves and powers of enchantment in the
land, as all men know; and some have lingered on in hidden places, now
and then showing themselves, for good or ill, to one of our race. In
deep glens and forest shadows you meet them, it is said, and chiefly by
the fountains that come bubbling up with the life of the under-world.  
  
Page 30  
  
   "In such a country as this dwelt Dynan's mother's mother's mother, I
know not how remote in ancestry. One day, passing through the meadows to
bathe, as was her custom, in a secret pool fed by undying springs under
curtaining boughs, she heard a faint cavern-muffled call from before
her, and was minded to return. But coming a little nearer, she found the
place quite vacant, save for dipping ouzels and water-rats that went
gliding away. Having waited a while, she laid aside her garments, and
stepped in through the shallows. Then again out swelled the cry, but now
deep-throated, vehement, exultant, and very near, seeming to heave up
the water before some bodily presence. It thrilled and wrapped and all
but overcame her; yet she sprang away, snatching her clothing, and
wrapping it around her as she ran. And, running thus, she heard yet a
third time that voice of the under-world, but now sent after her in
accents of more than human despair. Yet she had seen no form at all; and
the Three Shouts was the only name she could ever give, or which might
be given."  
   "But what is this to Dynan?" demanded Osburn.  
   "Why, if the story be told truly, she must have sought that pool
again--overcoming her fear, or because of it, for there are strange
things in enchantment. It is thought, also, she made tryst with him
otherwhere. A dimness, not human nor heavenly, was seen beside her in
lonely rambles; and one starlit  
  
Page 31  
  
eve she had vanished quite away. Long afterward she returned, and bore a
son among her own people, with a tale of wedlock in wild, lonely places,
by rites unknown; and this magical token, wrought by no earthly hand,
she showed as her voucher. When the right lips blow it, the voice of the
Three Shouts will be sent abroad, and hosts of terrible power will come
to the rescue. But they exact their price, and claim their own."  
   Cian took the horn from Osburn's hand, poising it carefully. "Shall I
blow it, for trial?" said he.  
   "Forbear!" cried his host uneasily.  
   Even while he yet held it, yielding, there came a far cry to them.
All looked through the wall windows toward the house-lights, which
glimmered across a broad open belt.  
    "No distress in that!" exclaimed Osburn. "He is on the way."  
   "Good," said Llywarch. "Now make Cian tell you how he saved a pack of
wolves this evening from a terrible lady."  
   "What!"  
   "Aurelia, daughter of Constantine," explained Cian gravely.  
    "So she fought the wolves?" queried Osburn.  
    "Protecting her little sister."  
   "And she hewed down well?"  
  
Page 32  
  
   "You should have seen. But the axe wearied her."  
   "Of course, of course!" and Osburn looked from one of his officers to
another with eager appeal. "There's a woman, grand and lovely! Emperor's
blood, they say. A king's daughter, at any rate! To-night will show."  
   Some of his men looked uncertain or indifferent, but the most were
evidently with him. Cian and Llywarch turned to each other in
congratulation.  
   "For how long?" suggested Cian.  
   "There you have it. That is the worst. How long?--I don't know. I
don't know my own title in this place. One day I am centurion--when the
Romans, as they call themselves, are uppermost. The next, I am commander
of a hundred--then the Britons, so called, rule. Once Constantine has
been consul; once, tribune. Now he is to be king. And there have been
chiefs and princes and governors, and what not. And the factions
wrangle, and the city goes to ruin, and the Saxons draw nearer, and the
wolves howl about the gates. Whatever else we need, we need--Arthur."  
   Seeing that he longed for it, they told him then fully of Arthur the
Guledig,--Arthur the Emperor, as men would say. They told what manner of
man this was in camp and court and daily converse, who had risen
steadily, a star of hope for all the land;  
  
Page 33  
  
his campaigns, how fought, and whither tending; his every hope and plan
so far as made known among his following, while yet he stood there by
the northern border, watchful. "Stanch men, like you," said Llywarch,
"are men after his own heart."  
   Osburn kept silence a minute. Much of this did not come newly to him;
but it was a tale well told again, and they rounded hints and fragments
with fuller and surer knowledge. At last he said,--  
   "I like the wise brain; I like the strong hand--the man who can learn
from Rome, live for Britain, and yet value any soldier. That leader is
mine who has never yet been beaten. If they choose Constantine, and he
chooses me, London is for Arthur."  
   They looked at him with widened interest, for he spoke assuredly. His
men followed with sounds and signs of applause, but their eyes opened as
at something new.  
   "May it indeed be so!" Cian answered. "What force have you here?"  
   "A legion--which is a half-legion--in fair shape, at the gates and
the White Tower. And the citizens turn out--sometimes. And there are
always spears--a few--about Caer Collin, our worst border. And the
foresters will fight, but as readily against us, for Vortimer of the
Andred-wood. The city is full of them now. That is Dynan's danger. What
keeps him?"  
  
Page 34  
  
   "You can't go fast through the fog."  
   "True. But it's too long. By St. John!--too long."  
   For Osburn was confusedly Christian in his swearing. He clenched his
hand as he spoke; when another cry from Dynan brought them all to their
feet together. It came from far to the right, and this time there could
be no doubt at all of its exceeding urgency. In a breath each man
snatched his armor, and then all went tumbling out--one on the heels of
another--except the very few that Osburn's hasty word in passing bade
remain on guard. He restored some part of order as they ran.

CHAPTER III.  
  
THE FIGHT BEFORE THE SHRINE.  
  
He that was the shelter in battle.  
                          --LLYWARCH.

  
OSBURN'S precautions, rapid though they were, held him a little behind
his anxious guests. Presently these also parted company in the fog; and
Cian, being the nimbler, found himself racing on alone, with merely
sound for a guide.  
   There had been enough of it all that evening about London; but it was
easy to single one commotion with the din of real combat in it. He made
this his aim, shouting ahead to hearten Dynan and the two or three
soldiers who were with him.  
   The moon was up now, though pale and slender, and the veil began
slowly thinning away. They were in that forsaken belt left by Roman
custom between houses and city wall; in this instance broader than usual
by reason of the dying of the outskirts, and also much more desolate.
Now they were stumbling over ruinous brickwork; now routing dim sneaking
beast forms out of their lairs, and sending them scurrying onward; now
splashing through pools and mire which  
  
Page 36  
  
proved that the northern marsh was beginning to spread within the
wall.  
   Suddenly Osburn and Llywarch, now together, were aware of figures
dimly flitting backward from them; and at a turning by an old corner of
masonry a fury of weapons, curses, limbs, and faces came at them all
together, holding them for a moment. Then it vanished as suddenly.  
   Cian heard the clash and uproar obliquely behind him, but kept on. A
light and agile figure leaped in front of him, with the voice of the
elf-son Dynan. "So near? I came for aid; come now!" Forthwith he was
flying back, while Cian followed as best he could. It was not their
first race into danger, but no wholly mortal man could equal that
speed.  
   For a moment the elf-son was lost to sight, then discovered in
violent action, while a form flew from him, moaning. He sprang, his
sword fell again, and he sped on. As Cian passed the spot, a form, dead
or living, at full length, nearly tripped him. Glancing back, he could
see fighting, or fancy that he saw it, where tumult had broken out
afresh around the voice of Llywarch. At the crossing of a little rill,
two men faced him; but he sprang by, dealing one of them a backward
blow. Twenty yards farther he saw Dynan spring on the skirts of a throng
with nimble execration, while men scattered right and left. Before they
closed again Cian also was cutting vehe-  
  
Page 37  
  
mently among them, while a third figure broke outward to his aid. The
three together made such clearance that they won swiftly to a little
apse or shrine which had served already as a shelter.  
   Here some pious legionary had reared, of old, a small temple, it may
be to Juno or Proserpine, doubtless a lovely thing in its day. But the
pillars had fallen long ago, and very little indeed remained beside that
cave-like half-dome and its supporting walls, with two forward running
wings of masonry, which left only a narrow entrance with a litter of
fragments before it. Inside, three or four men could yet find room,
though not with ample motion. A soldier crouched there, unable to dash
out with his comrade, but holding his spear forward still.  
   Cian took a step out of the portal, and his foot slipped on the
rounded body of the deity cast down. His hand, coming on it to stay his
fall, was wet with blood. A dead man lay half across the marble, face on
breast.  
   There had like to be another; for the enemy, very near, took
advantage of his mishap, and one spear at least would surely have gone
through him, but that Dynan turned it, and leaped in, thrusting thrice
to a breath, until the point found an undefended spot and the man fell.
In a moment the elf-son was out and beyond, flitting over obstacles and
under blows, bounding, twisting, lunging and striking, everywhere  
  
Page 38  
  
at once, like a figure driven by some prodigious spring-work.  
   Cian, busy enough himself, kept an eye on this darting friend, for he
felt that the ending of it all must be very near. Twice he dashed out to
Dynan's aid, but each time that ally was elsewhere already. At last,
with a great bound, the nimble-footed fellow came over one of the
masonry wings, landing close behind Cian. Then he gave forth once,
brokenly, his peculiar call for aid, and fell exhausted before the
entrance and the altar.  
   Cian stepped back, watching warily the rush that followed, and making
the best use of edge and point that he could. The strait was so narrow
and cumbered that there was rarely a chance for a full blow; but his
enemies were hampered likewise, and they also jostled each other, while
not one was nearly a match in fence for the best swordsman, save two, of
Arthur's court. Had there been but fair light to see him, the tall dark
prince of the northern hills, sword in hand, framed by the rough temple
archway, had never appeared more grandly. From each side of him, too, a
spear-point darted out, gashing one or another of his assailants in
breast or limb, as they were driven over near.  
   More than once they surged quite up to him, ebbing again after fierce
stabbing at close quarters, almost like throbbing of steel. Rather by
touch than  
  
Page 39  
  
by sight, he knew that some of them were in armor, some skin-clad, some
all but naked, and with weapons as various. "Who are they?" he asked, at
a half-minute's breathing spell.  
   The soldier first wounded was beyond answering. The other replied
weakly, "Foresters, rabble, a few of our own men, townspeople who have
bought armor, all sorts"--  
   But again they were on him together, at the closest quarters and with
the deadliest intent. One led them whom he had marked before as the most
persistent of all, a shorter man than himself, yet of good height and
very active, with sinewy arms and a passionately hostile face.
"Tigernach, Tigernach!" he cried, as if his ominous name were a spell.  
   "And I am Cian Gwenclan," was the proud answer. At the same time the
moon shone out more plainly. However paled in that gleam, there could be
no mistaking the golden lustre nor the silver spray.  
   Now indeed it seemed that a spell was working very strangely.
Tigernach drew back bodily, shouldering those behind him. "It is Cian of
the Chariots," he cried, turning. "I will not fight him of the golden
mail, the heirloom of the awful dead. I will not fight the mistletoe,
nor yet Arthur the Guledig."  
   "Why not," said one, "if he lays open my arm?"  
   Nevertheless, they swayed about, with signs of melting; then vanished
dispersedly, as hurrying calls  
  
Page 40  
  
were heard near at hand. Other forms fleeted by, with Llywarch hotly
behind them.  
   "Praise Mary!" he cried, seeing his friend yet living.  
   "For letting good men be slain while doing their duty?" inquired
Cian, with a glance at the dead soldier. "Or for the wonderfully swift
feet of Argoed?"  
   "Swift enough," said Dynan, as he rose achingly by sheer will. "See
what comes of swiftness. But where's Osburn?"  
   For answer, they could hear a new clangor and cursing voices not far
away. Hurrying thither,--Dynan for once hobbling desperately in the
rear,--they came on the stout centurion, with two or three of his men,
holding a clump of the enemy penned in an angle of a broken wall, whence
they endeavored to escape, now and then one succeeding. But they did not
stir Osburn from his foothold. His blows and anathemas were hammer-like,
men rattling down under them. Just as his re-enforcement came up, the
last few of these human rats in a trap, with a frantic effort, went
scrambling over the ragged masonry behind them, while hip-slashes and a
blast of hoarse words helped them up and on. Osburn turned from them
with laughter, and presently had Dynan by the hand. His eyes were eager
questioners. Dynan, when breath would serve him, answered as eagerly.  
   This was his tale:  
  
Page 41  
  
   Going in, he had no disquiet beyond a continual hovering in the fog,
as of spectres, but there was confusion enough when once among the
houses; and the council-house, or basilica rather, seemed a place of
frenzy, the party of Constantine claiming power already by election, and
their opponents furiously contesting it. Nevertheless, he gave the
message, and received instead a summons and an invitation, which was a
warning. To Osburn: "Come; bring your men; expect preferment;" and to
Arthur's envoys: "Pray rest at my home until to-morrow." Also he was
adjured to hasten, and watch keenly.  
   This he did. But soon after his first call the way was barred, and he
was driven to edge away and make détours, until he reached the shrine by
the wall. There, being closely pressed, he left his two followers to
make good their den, and darted by and through their enemies to bring
aid.  
   "It has a bad look," he conceded ruefully; "but if either of them
could have stirred his toes a third as fast as I, he should have gone
instead. Now, there's a leader's qualifications for you!"  
   Osburn pressed his hand reassuringly. They had regained the shrine.
It was surprising to find, after all, how little fatal damage had been
done. But there was blood enough about certainly.  
   Cian could feel his own trickling, while a weak indifference gained
on him. Presently his head swam  
  
Page 42  
  
and rang; but he held up and said nothing, as they moved back toward the
Ermine gate. He heard some stern order from Osburn about leaving the
wounded enemy where they lay, and Llywarch's kindly protest. Then there
was a startled exclamation; and he felt them supporting him, while some
hand presented a flask to his lips.  
   When he quite came to life again, a surgeon was saying, "He need not
be much the worse for it;" while a soldier bathed his limbs, and
bandages went around them. He knew that he was in the wall-quarters of
the guard again.  
   Every face showed pleasure that his hurts were no worse; but he was
very sore, and felt it all as a satirical absurdity. "A rabble-mauled
veteran," he said with deliberate effort. "One Cian, a swordsman,
formerly known at Camelot."  
   "Not all rabble, not all," answered Osburn. "Tigernach was there, a
born chief of the forest, good at his weapons. We know him."  
   "Swift as I nearly; obstinate almost as Osburn; hotter than either or
any," added Dynan.  
   Cian looked from face to face. "Why, Tigernach?" he said. "Ah! bring
him in."  
   "His forty wild followers may wait outside, I trust," suggested
Llywarch.  
   "You may trust him," answered Cian, putting his forefinger
significantly on the silver mistletoe.  
  
Page 43  
  
   Tigernach entered, in hastily brightened mail, with brilliant apparel
showing through the rifts and joinings. He carried himself so as to give
an effect of greater height and shapeliness than in the recent struggle.
He had the look of true Celtic fervor and irascible pride, with
suggestions of romance also. His black eyes, keen and burning, were
fixed on Cian, who was plainly far more to him than all besides.  
   "We have mingled our blood by a very unfriendly rite," he said; "but
you will not blame one who could not know."  
   He turned the hollow of his shield outward. It also bore the silver
mistletoe.  
   "You know now," answered Cian, "and will stand by me and Arthur the
Guledig?"  
   He used the Celtic title. The forester bowed.  
   "And by Constantine, King of London," pursued Cian.  
   The other's lips twisted. "I have no liking for men who lie down to
their meals," he said, "and pirate of Rome, Rome, Rome! But I suppose it
must be."  
   Osburn laughed sympathetically. "We may count on him," said he.  
   "So thoroughly," added Cian, "that I take him and his tribesmen for
my guard to-night, setting your men free."  
   Osburn hesitated. Llywarch looked uneasy.  
  
Page 44  
  
   "That is going far on scant knowledge," he said. "No offence to this
spirited gentleman, but we should not be the worse for a dozen drilled
soldiers also. Bear in mind, Cian, that there is a lady to be looked
after."  
   "And we savages are unworthy?" commented Tigernach. "As you will. As
pleases you!" He forced a laugh.  
   "Perhaps it is from the lady that he should be guarded," whispered
Dynan.  
   "You are right," answered the woodland chief, his face partly
clearing at the jest, also in memory of her, for every man in the little
kingdom knew the kind charm of Aurelia.  
   Osburn decided: "All are right. We trust Tigernach. Prince Cian shall
have him--and his men. Prince Llywarch shall have my men, whom he honors
by preference. But I can't spare many. Dynan, I commit to you the royal
villa and this gate; the princess, who is waiting; the Saxons, who
maybe. Now I must go."  
   Dynan drew a long breath, looking blank. "So much for an enchanted
reputation!" he said. " If it were not for the gnats and the ghosts and
poisoned air, I would make my headquarters in the marsh midway. I shall
get a fine name as a flying cavalryman."  
  
Page 45  
  

CHAPTER IV.  
  
THE RETURN TO THE VILLA.  
  
To view the comely forms of the lovely ones.  
                         -- *Black Book of Caermarthen.*

  
CIAN rode slowly, without speaking; for he still drooped, and every
movement hurt him. Tigernach also was silent, but resentfully. Llywarch
spoke in kindness.  
   "You should not mind a soldier's frankness--a fellow woodlander's
too. Which way lie your domains?"  
   "In the heart of the great Andred wood, toward what they call Sussex
now, on the old way to Anderida. We hold the ridge, and ever have held
it. The Saxons did not come by me. After that town fell, they tried; but
we cut up the first party in the thickets, and there never was a
second."  
   He warmed a little in speaking of this achievement.  
   "You hold of London?" pursued Llywarch, with an interested air.  
   "Why, so *they* hold. We do our buying here, and some of our
fighting. This time Vortimer in-  
  
Page 46  
  
vited us--of the lower woodlands. He has some shadow-claim too, and a
borrowed name from olden times that every Briton loves. But he looks the
Saxon that he is, on the father's side. We lead our own life, and go our
own ways."  
    "You came lightly attended. Surely you do not usually adjust the
affairs of London with half a hundred men."  
   Tigernach laughed. "Such a kingdom! The only way to adjust a Londoner
is to kill him. Then he knows his own mind, and is reasonable. As there
was to be a fight, of course I came, with a few who were nearest, losing
no time. Others will follow. Half my young men are on the way before
this, if I know them."  
    "I would send word," suggested Cian.  
   Tigernach took on a more deferential tone. "That I have done. They
will gather for us near the northern gate."  
    "Re-enforcements for me!" cried Dynan, who had just ridden up, with
breath and spirits back again. "We are well rid of the prisoners too.
They didn't keep me long."  
    "Ah!" growled Tigernach. Then he added calmly, "they were not of my
people."  
    "Oh, nothing in the way of slaughter. I turned them loose to bring
recruits. One was a neighbor of yours, a tribesman of Caowl, that
beetling-browed,  
  
Page 47  
  
slant-eyed, hard-fighting man. My compliments go with him."  
   "Nimble of wit as of foot! Caowl will come over to us for that.
Otherwise I harry him from one end of his land to the other."  
   Dynan laughed merrily. "Dear neighbors are much the same in the
Andred woods as up my way,--do as I bid, and, oh, how I love you!"  
    "But you were given the prisoners to keep," said Cian.  
    "There spoke Duty. Know, then, O Conscience! that our well-anchored
commander bath endowed me with a huge discretion--which was wise and
liberal of him, it being greatly needed. Moreover, I have the
countenance of Prince Llywarch of Argoed."  
   But Llywarch demurred at once, "Oh, no! my countenance was never a
thing of red banners and blazes. My countenance is where it ought to be
for decency's sake. Yet I did counsel mercy. It is well to err that way,
as in over-care of friends."  
   Tigernach bowed. "That is manful," said he.  
   "And heart-warm," added Cian. "Thence comes all the craftiness of
Llywarch."  
   The lift of the land had taken them into clear moonshine. Looking
back, they could see very little of London, except a low, formless
gloom, with veiled glimmerings of light in it, and here and there a lamp
on some house-roof or tower, shining like a red star.  
  
Page 48  
  
There was a diffused gleam about the basilica, and, more doubtfully,
along the great bridge.  
   The noise behind grew louder to them, as they ascended, but rarely
made any one sound distinguishable. The howling of the wolves came from
the hill-country quite as plainly.  
   This time they crossed an affluent of the Wallbrook on a bridge a
little above the villa. It must have been hidden from them by the fog
and the twilight before--a strong bit of olden masonry, in the dip of a
branch road, with passage for three horses abreast. New lights came out
at this, moving from window to window. The lodge by the gate brightened
also.  
   A group of figures came hastening over the lawn, with sounds of
laughter. When the gate swung open, Aurelia and Sylvia were there,
breathing fast, but with eyes of welcome. Clad in white, flushed with
exercise and expectancy, graceful and stately, with no thought of grace
or stateliness, the tall daughter of Constantine had never looked more
divine.  
    "My father?" she inquired.  
    "King Constantine, Princess," proclaimed Dynan. "Osburn the Frank is
to be his general, at a bound. I have charge of the Ermine gate and this
villa."  
   While all made obeisance to her, she replied demurely, "Then we will
all obey you as king at third hand, Dynan."  
  
Page 49  
  
   But Sylvia was not content. She pulled at her sister, and began to
whimper. "Why don't they bow to *me* , if I am a princess too? Why don't
they look at *me* ? *I* want to be a Princess."  
   "And if you are," answered Aurelia, with a responsibly improving air,
"be sure it will not add one cubit to your stature."  
    "Heaven forbid, if I know anything of ancient measurement!"
protested Llywarch. "Would you have this sweet little maiden shoot up
all at once into a mate for the giant of Skiddaw?"  
    "Prince Llywarch wishes to say that some of us are over-lofty
already," expounded Aurelia to the lesser one.  
   Llywarch looked that way too. "I will do homage to you, and be your
champion, my bright little lady," said he.  
   Sylvia eyed him with grave approval. Then, at a motion of Cian, she
shook her ringlets. "This one; he has fought for me already," said she.
There was a laugh, but she drew near to her rescuer confidingly. Even
her slight touch fell by chance where it made him flinch.  
    "See," she cried distressfully, "he is hurt. Aurelia, somebody has
been hurting him."  
    "Not much, dear," said Cian, laughing weakly at this new way of
viewing his adventure. "That's what we are for, you know."  
  
Page 50  
  
   But Aurelia had heard. "Wounded? and I am keeping you here!" she
exclaimed. "Oh, come, come! No, you shall not dismount. At the house,
not before."  
   She walked easily beside him. "We heard there had been fighting," she
said gravely, "but not this."  
   "I shall not grieve," said Cian. "It will keep me your guest a little
time."  
   "Nor shall I grieve for that," she replied frankly.  
   Turning to those who came behind, she added in a clear, full voice,
"All my father's friends are more than welcome."  
   The soldiery clanked their swords on their shields in response, and
the woodland men shouted vociferously. Her beauty, her lavish benignity,
the warmth and strength of her nature, were not new to them, but
worshipful, as of old.  
   They were now by the great front portico. Cian, dismounting, began to
sway and reach. Aurelia stepped nearer. "It is my turn to help you,"
said she.  
   He drew back, fearing to lean such weight on her. "Forgive me," said
he, and rested his hand on the shoulder of Tigernach, who was there
already.  
   No greater sense of luxury had ever befallen him than when at last he
lay full length in the chamber appointed, sipping a cordial, and
disencumbered. With Tigernach watching, he soon slept.  
  
Page 51  
  
   Llywarch brought the good news to their hostess, all the more
willingly for the quick turn of her head as he entered, and the inquiry
in her kind eyes. He did not love her in the first person, but he was
half in love with her for Cian's sake. He made it tenderly plain to her
that Cian's wounds were trivial, and that the surgeon had so well
treated them, that there was little, beyond common kindness, for anyone
else to do. But the beauty of her home, he told her, would be in itself
a reviving medicine.  
   She truly needed comforting, for the strain of that evening had been
severe. After her first great peril the wolf-voices had come to her
again, hour by hour, as reminders. Her people had told her also of wild
human figures that gathered on the hills or went savagely by. Also,
there were both the rumor and the noise of conflict in that tormented
city where her father was risking life to win a shadowy crown. But now
all had gone fairly well. Her home for the time was in safety, and she,
too, might sleep.

CHAPTER V.  
  
A DIP INTO OLD ROME.  
  
Here the baths were  
    Hot on the breast.  
                                  --THE RUIN, *Codex Exoniensis.*

  
WHEN Cian awoke he was not at first very sure of his awakening. The
scenes of the wild evening before melted into the equally strange
fancies of the night, and shifted with them interchangeably. As his
thought cleared, there was still something astounding and unreal in his
memory of the shrouded city, the goddess come to life among the wolves,
and that spectral combat of the shrine, where men of frantic and varied
aspect, in what quarrel he hardly knew, dealt blows at him unceasingly
out of the moonlit haze.  
   But there was no haze now. The sun, very real and bright, came
slanting in through the glassless windows. There were no bird songs. A
dry leaf or two drifted by. Summer, after once leaving, had come back
again in the lovely air.  
   He had lifted himself on his elbow, and was inspecting a slit in his
forearm, when Llywarch appeared.  
  
Page 53  
  
   What tidings?" Cian inquired.  
    "Chiefly that the bud of the morning is uncommonly full blown, and
that bath and breakfast wait. I am glad to see that the Gwenclan has
enough of 'pure blood' left to warrant his title."  
    "Oh, I shall live. But as to the bath: you know my way."  
    "Cold water in great severity. It is no doubt a thing of virtue. But
when I hinted it a certain royal lady uplifted her brows at me. I think
her counsel would be to have you sponged tepidly in bed, and anointed
with healing unguents to slow music."  
   His friend sat upright with a grimace.  
    "Good!" said Llywarch. "Yet a little warmth in the water would be
useful in removing blood-stains. Pray yield thus far to Roman
effeminacy, and let me help about the bandages."  
   Cian was looking at them, "I am less like a man than a disorderly
bale of goods," he mused aloud. "How those fellows did get into me!
There were enough of them. Is it far?"  
    "Two rooms;" and Llywarch lent him a hand to rise, then led the way
over a bright tessellated floor, flinging the silken door-curtains aside
as they came.  
   Cian entered the anteroom of the bath, and stood gazing.  
   Before tendering his spear to the great Arthur, Prince Cian had been
but a hillside ruler, the lord of  
  
Page 54  
  
a northern valley nook. Later, his had been mainly the soldier life; and
he knew the Roman splendor by rumor only, or in mere external view. He
could not choose but hear of the surpassing luxury which yet hid itself
in a few safe and indolent places, as about the western Waters of the
Sun. But he had been content to go on, disapproving, disregarding, in
his own simpler ways. What he now saw was a revelation.  
   The apartment was walled shoulder-high on the right and left with
delicate, flower-painted tiles of many varying blossoms. Above these,
Corinthian pillars of blue-veined marble, wound with vine-leaves and
laurel, rose to the ceiling. The light admitted was nearly as brilliant
as in the outer air.  
   Over the doorway before them, in tints unfading, Apollo, thrilled
with inner flame, threw eagerly from him the cloud-veil of the morning.
In the mosaic under foot were the foaming waves and the quaint, jubilant
Triton-figures of the welcoming sea. Around the ceiling ran a merry rout
of fawns and nereids--racing, overtaking, disrobing--about a central
figure of airy loveliness, neither wholly spirit nor winged goddess, but
quickening with the life of free air, blue water, sunshine and the
bright dew.  
   "Behold the stoical Briton!" said Llywarch, observing his friend's
trance of admiration. "It is a relief, you were such a standing reproach
to me. But Tigernach will be the death of you."  
  
Page 55  
  
   Cian scarcely heard the voice, or the steps of withdrawal. Warmth,
soothing odors, and the sound of falling water, came to him through the
inner doorway, deepening as he entered.  
   One side of this second apartment was as before, only here the tiles
bore fruit instead of flowers,--the peach, the orange, the pomegranate,
with many besides,--and the columns had the warm tints of a sensuous
life in them.  
   The fresco of the opposite wall had been given an undulating surface
by the broad, hidden tubular tiles which conducted the heated air from
the regions below. There the goddess bent, as in the old tale, above the
slumbering youth. But the mist waved upward from the lazy stream beside
him, the grass billowed in the light wind about her feet, and mortal and
deity seemed fluttering together as her lips called him away through
vistas of dreamland.  
   But everywhere the wall-space and flooring were rich in
languor--inviting design,--the softly moving damsels of "the hollow
lotos land," with the enchanted fruit they bore; Narcissus propped on
elbow beside the fountain; a shoal of water nymphs, who floated face
upward among white lilies under the leaf shadows that flecked a silent
pool. The ceiling afforded a vision of clear sky, white drifting clouds,
and, over all, the calm gods at rest.  
   In one corner stood the great bath of fine porce-  
  
Page 56  
  
lain, blue almost with the blueness and brightness of amethyst. Creamy
figures in relief banqueted at ease along the side, reclining to await
the cup. A veiled statue of Slumber stood at the head, pouring drowsily
from hand to hand the perfumed water of oblivion, which shattered again
as it fell, so that the air was heavy with fragrance. Beside this an
ample stream, warmed on its way, flowed into and out of the bath
unceasingly.  
   He lay there long, seeming to take no harm. Regret and aspiration,
all bitterness of spirit, and every anxious murmur, had floated quite
away. Fancy moved indolently. The pictured scenes about him grew almost
as real as the changeful life he had led. The soul of the lotos-bloom
was the soul of all.  
   At length an attendant entered in some anxiety that he staid so long,
and the dream was broken. Cian arose with languor, and passed into a
third chamber, which lay snow-white and roofless. Marble figures peopled
it, of stately mien, ranged about an ample sheet of water that stirred
invitingly. Cool airs kept fanning over the surface, awakening early
memories of forest and riverside. The plunge seemed very tempting, and
it was taken quickly. He rose to the light and air, with life and vigor
returning.

CHAPTER VI.  
  
THE HOME OF AURELIA.  
  
Usual it is for maids to be lovely.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
OSBURN had found Constantine enthroned in the basilica among his
adherents, not very certain of anything outside, but comforting himself
with their number and spirit, the insignia of royalty about him, and
above all the augury of his own countenance. This trick of outline had
much to do with his aspirations. The man who duplicated the
world-conqueror stood pledged from birth to mighty deeds. How could fate
fail him? He brightened as Osburn entered, but rather with relief than
heroism.  
   There was welcome also in the faces below, though some had looked
ill-pleased over the sudden and great uplifting of this mercenary. He
knew it well, and knew them also, not wholly with disapproval. For those
were days when every trafficker must be something of a fighting man as
well; and the mailed London merchants, with their sons and nephews and
followers, made a martial array indeed. There was a sprinkling of
foreign features; for the commercial  
  
Page 58  
  
houses of Gaul had yet some agents there of their own people, and many
adventurers from abroad had taken service. Plainly this was the side of
civilization, or what remained of it, militant by necessity.  
   Osburn was soon aware of some natural disquiet among the Celtic part
of the men-at-arms whenever the truculent uproar of their kin outside
grew louder than usual. He took his measures promptly, being the one man
of either side who knew just what to do and what he dealt with. All the
forum space was cleared by trusty legionaries, and securely guarded
thereafter. Another gate of the city-wall gave in its adhesion when his
men appeared there. The merchants' quarter, already held for
Constantine, was more strongly occupied. The governor of the White Tower
had been temporizing, but Osburn ended that by a sudden movement in
force; and the partisans of Arthur and Constantine in that garrison
threw all open to him directly. Before morning, through management and
active skirmishing, three-fifths of the city were in Roman hands.  
   But the remainder was held in disorderly fashion by fierce men,
growing more and more reckless, as they felt the tide running with
greater force against them. Few had anything to lose beyond what pillage
might repay. Very many were of the woods, half savage, and caring
nothing for the city. Out of their exasperation arose the threat of
fire; a shrill  
  
Page 59  
  
cry borne to Constantine in many echoes, making him his enemies' ally.
For he had much at stake, and his partisans had more,--had their all.  
   Osburn would have met the issue sternly, but Osburn was disquieting
him already. Action was too instant; things went well too quickly; he
had felt that it could not last. Now and here he would make a stand. So
he interfered suddenly, shutting his ears to all dissuasion, and closed
a truce with Vortimer.  
   Each was to hold his ground, and a new and greater council was to
settle or unsettle everything on the evening of that day.  
   When this had been told by Llywarch in outline, Cian shook his head.
"Who would hold a throne by mercy of the torch?" he said. "The head
which bows will never keep that crown."  
   Cian was breakfasting in his room after the bath, with his friend for
company.  
   "The daughter said nothing when it was told us. But--you should have
seen her."  
    "That may yet be done, and ought to be. She will think me a sluggard
or a sorely crippled man."  
   "Also, it may be well to see where you are; for night shows
little."  
   The house lay four-square over a great area, and was built
casemate-fashion, one story in height and depth. A great court, which
had been turned into a  
  
Page 60  
  
garden, filled the interior. Two lesser wings jutted out from the rear
corners. One of these, by the purity of its art, may have been the
original home or house-kernel, but was now overflowing with looms and
fabrics, in proof that manufacture, no less than more gracious
employments, went on in the villa. The other was evidently a granary;
though it had been in its day a temple of Minerva, and afterward a
Christian chapel, as inscriptions went to show.  
   The front portico, long and lofty, was very beautiful in an ornate,
florid way. Care had been taken to preserve it; with the utmost need,
for there was no surviving power to repeat such work, as the sorry
patching of the mosaic floor demonstrated all too plainly. The outer
wall, enclosing the lawn and shrubbery, was recent also, the stones
being uncemented.  
   There was a stir of population. From the rear came an intermittent
jangling, where the repairs of Cian's chariot were going on. Also there
was much ado about harvesting, as wains, laden or empty, came and went
between the granary wing and the fields.  
   Entering the garden-court, they found quietness. Hedgerow walls and
masses of shrubbery, with purple grape arbors and beds of autumnal
flowers between them, broke it up very pleasantly. Every vista ended in
rows of ornamented columns, white or veined or tinted, along some one of
the inner house  
  
Page 61  
  
fronts, with graceful statuary niched therein, or standing where the
alleys crossed.  
   There were fountains, too, fed by conduits from a hillside rivulet--a
very great one in the centre, which made the chief sound of the place.  
   Beyond this, a little within a ring of evergreen, the only monster
lay--a white sphynx with unusual attributes--of doubtful meaning. Below
its impassive countenance a living human face looked upward, all else
being hidden by the creature's bulk. The brow was broad; the outlines
were manly, kind, and noble, but with intense foreseeing horror in every
line. A tender and shapely feminine hand, belonging to the left forearm
of that stony, crushing thing, was thrown over against the victim's
cheek in a negligent caress.  
   Just now a little child, Sylvia, who had seen it every day, was idly
smoothing the dust from those lady-like fingers, and leaning her bright
locks where the heart of the terror should be. Perhaps it had given a
turn to her questioning; for her sister made answer with one of the
subtly and wildly poetic myth-tales of the British race.  
   Aurelia was seated in a slanting wicker chair, half under the cedar
shadows. A rolled manuscript, lately fallen from her hand, showed that
she had been reading. Both arms were uncovered, as also her sandalled
feet, but for the light straps across them, and  
  
Page 62  
  
the brown tresses of her hair, in ample undulations. Her scarlet robe, a
color held peculiarly noble, was fastened above both shoulders by golden
fibulæ, ornamented with blue enamel, the especial pride of Celtic art;
for she had the life and love of her own people in her, whatever the
fancied claims of Rome. A larger brooch below her neck displayed a Cupid
on a dolphin, sporting over the same blue background for their sea.  
   Her large gray eyes were at rest. She spoke leisurely, as relating
what was well known. Her voice was raised a little to be heard above the
falling water, wherewith it chimed very well. Cian had found her
marvellous in the cloud and the twilight, in the stress of action and
peril; but she belonged with even more enchantment to this perfect
splendor and peace. He heard Llywarch whisper, "A royal girl indeed! And
such kind eyes!" Then they both awaited, unseen, the end of her story.  
   She continued: "So by reason of this great fault and failure,
Cunebelline could not pass into the upper world, but was held here on
earth. And the dark goddess of the star-eyes felt pain at heart. In her
very great love of him, she came where he was, often, at the ending of
the day. But he only felt the night wind breathing, and heard, when she
spoke, the faint murmur of the water; for she was of another and subtler
kindred than his, from far away. He was,  
  

  
Aurelia in the Garden

  
Page 63  
  
indeed, doubtfully aware of a presence unseen; but this grew on him as a
fear, and she could not be with him any more, unless in sorrow.  
   "Then she besought that she might come before him in such form as he
could see and touch without dread, and by choice a beautiful woman; yet,
if not that, at least a woman still, however wrinkled and unlovely. But
even this might not be granted, except as a goddess, for love of a man,
should become far less than he! That was hard measure, and for a long
time beyond her; but the yearning grew until the life of the upper world
was more a life of torment than any life below.  
   "One daybreak a strange and lovely thing was found, night-black and
lustrous, with silken mane, coat of satin, wistful velvet eyes,--a
creature incomparable for power and beauty. And he said, 'Surely some
benignity of heaven has sent me this marvel;' for no one could deem her
altogether earthly. Therefore he took exceedingly great care of her,
saying, 'Henceforward I will have no other steed to bear me in peace or
war.'  
   "Then came to him great continual gain in dominion and glory. For she
whispered wise counsel to him when none were by, which brightened the
land, keeping men kind and genial. When he would ride afield, no bird
could bear him more swiftly. And the rush of them in battle was like the
rush of the  
  
Page 64  
  
lightning. There was panting and fleeing before their aspect more than
from the coming thrust or blow.  
   "Many kings took him willingly for their emperor; his ships went
afar, bringing wealth to him from the ends of the world; he was known
openly for the equal friend of Rome; and every one in every land had
heard of Cunebelline the golden.  
   "All this he owed to her; for he was but a man, and no very
surpassing man, left alone. Moreover, when the end of his life drew
near, she did not leave him to die, like all others of our race, but
bore him bodily away among the stars."  
   "Oh, did she?" inquired Sylvia doubtfully.  
   Aurelia laughed with an awakening air, having grown dreamful in the
peace of that nook, with the lulling of the fountain-fall and her own
voice, weaving again the fairy web of enchantment.  
   "Why, so runs the story," she answered; "and I have thought it a
pretty one. Don't you?"  
   Sylvia looked thoughtful. "Yes," she replied hesitatingly. Then she
shook her head. "I think the goddess was a fool," said she.  
   "Hush, dear!" protested Aurelia, though not greatly horrified. "Newer
gods have come and gone, and yet newer ones are here; but let us not be
disrespectful to the oldest of the old."  
   "If she were a very pretty horse," conceded Syl-  
  
Page 65  
  
via. "But then," with a sudden freak of judicial wisdom, "suppose she
had turned out a donkey! How did she know?"  
   Aurelia laughed again. "Oh, don't ask me to help the immortals out of
that," answered she. "You may find yourself playing the donkey some day,
Sylvia."  
   But a footstep had drawn her attention, and she was rising in
pleasure, with a greeting. "I feared we could not see you to-day, she
said."  
    "Oh," answered Llywarch for his friend, "it is of no manner of use
to poke spears into this gnarled old campaigner. . Nothing does him any
good at all."  
    "One thing at least--the legend of the starry goddess," declared
Cian, bowing.  
    "Is this magic, or simple eavesdropping?" inquired she. "Now, my
father would never listen to that tale, nor to anything against the
faith of his first great namesake. As for me, I have a feeling for that
excellent legionary from Mesopotamia who built over yonder a temple to
'the gods of all nations."'  
   Cian made answer dryly, "I see a Christianity with an old British
tap-root and a vast hospitality." But she understood his approval.  
   Sylvia changed the topic by walking up with deliberation, and laying
her hand experimentally on his silver mistletoe spray. Then she looked
up into his  
  
Page 66  
  
face, considering gravely. "I am not a bit afraid of you," she observed,
"if it is magic."  
   He laughed with the others. "Thank you, my dear child," he answered
simply.  
    "Afraid--after he saved us from the wolves," exclaimed Aurelia.  
    "I said I wasn't afraid of him," protested Sylvia, frowning
defensively, yet half in mind to cry. Then, taking refuge in him, "Where
did you get this pretty thing?" she inquired confidentially.  
   "In a solemn place, very strangely lighted," he replied. "I would
scarcely know how to tell any one much more, little Sylvia. But it was
after combat with something invisible, whether man or ghost or demon, I
do not know."  
   "Oh, I know, I know!" cried Sylvia. "It must have been a goblin. Why,
this is a nice story, like Aurelia's. Is it true?"  
   "Pretty well for Sylvia!" laughed Llywarch. "But I am afraid you have
ended it all at once, my dear." For Cian was looking absurd.  
   "When did this happen?" inquired Aurelia, controlling her
amusement.  
   "Not very long after the return of the Druids to Mona, in the time of
Ambrosius. I was hardly more than a lad. But for this," and Cian touched
the golden garment, "I, too, should hold it a dream. After all, the past
is dreamland."  
  
Page 67  
  
    "What was it like?" inquired Llywarch, though he had heard before.  
    "A room below ground, all mirrors and smoothness; a great form lying
in state, and multiplied in them all around; a huge lamp on shining
ebony, dazzling by reflection from every side; a sword flashing at me
like a thousand, so that one could not tell the real blade from the
phantasms; a sudden darkness, a form that wrestled with me therein, and
fell with no sound; a deep prophetic voice going after me, as I fled
with my prize up the narrow way,--and that is all."  
   Here Tigernach appeared among them, announcing rather sourly, "The
king is coming, in the Roman fashion." He added more suavely to Aurelia,
"It is indeed a fine display."  
   Yet hardly Roman so truly as a Rome-imitating medley. The purple robe
of Constantine was excessive in amplitude and depth of dye. A great tuft
of scarlet feathers went before him, borne aloft. A flaming banner came
after him, with a gilded eagle above it. Three hundred horsemen in gay
armor rode behind, the sunshine glorifying their bronze, their jewelled
weapons, their ruddy, blowing scarfs, tasselled with acorns of gold.
More than a score of them had wound about their necks the golden chain
of leadership.  
   At the bridge there was a blare of music from the head of the
cavalcade, answered by the population and  
  
Page 68  
  
the garrison of the villa with varied outcry. A faint echo came from the
distant concourse about the Ermine gate. Three by three the armored
horsemen rode over and on to what was now a royal palace indeed.  
   Constantine greeted his guests with majesty, tempered by the
deference due to those who came from a greater even than he. It suited
him presently to put magnificence away, and walk simply with them and
his daughter. But none who met them were allowed to forget that it was a
monarch with whom they spoke face to face.  
   Aurelia may have felt this unpleasantly, for there was sobriety in
her enjoyment. Otherwise, her demeanor did not vary, no one finding more
or less than usual of her cordial frankness and queenly charm.  
   At the first turning, Sylvia came running to meet them, her little
soul full of the wolves and their teeth; also, the fright they had put
her in, the valor of Aurelia, the crashing among them of Cian and his
chariot. "Oh, how they did scamper!" she cried.  
   It was a bit of news that she had been saving up for him, after her
custom, and telling to herself over and over again, with foreknowledge
of its absorbing interest. What had come since was to rule her fancy
later. That drama of emotion had the foreground.  
   Constantine picked up the little thing, and clasped  
  
Page 69  
  
and kissed her, looking vastly more genuine than when playing at Julius
Cæsar.  
   "You won't let the wolves get me, will you?" besought she, for the
mere pleasure of reassurance, being very secure in mind just then.  
   "No, no!" he replied. "Not wolves of any sort. Oh, we have wolves in
London too, and some of them put their teeth into your champion last
night. But the Saxon wolves are worst of all--those who have driven the
poor people of the Stour to our shelter. Princess, there are infants
lying cold in the fields where Saxon spears have tossed them. There are
homes black as coal and white with ashes. There are altars toppled down
where men were used to worship. There are wives, not a few, borne
wofully away--lifelong thralls to the men who have slain their husbands.
But you should hear Oisin, and doubtless will. We always do hear Oisin.
And who can wonder?"  
   Yet there was an accent of weariness.  
   Aurelia explained to her guests, "They begin to call him St. Oisin
now, a very zealous man. He was priest of a parish below Caer Collin.
Eschwine, the East Saxon, came--his own escape was a miracle. They say
that many of his people were tortured in his sight."  
    "In the days of Rome such things could not be," observed
Constantine.

    "You will find the strength and safety of Rome in our great
emperor," said Llywarch, with conviction.  
    "Of Britain also," added Cian.  
    "God grant it!" was Constantine's reply. "But--he will want levies
and supplies, and they are not in favor with our people. Many put their
trust in Vran--you know the story. The head of that wonder--worker,
buried in the White Hill, facing seaward, protecting London forever. Why
send men to fight in distant quarrels, they say. I but repeat the talk
of the town. For my own part, the Saxons have robbed me every way, in
ship and caravan, and I am always very willing to have at them."  
   Still there was a bargain in his eye, and the child had been set
down. "A chapman in soul!" thought Cian resentfully.  
   "It would be insufferable," declared Aurelia, "to wrap ourselves in a
magic cloak of safety, and leave all others to their fate."  
   She spoke with deprecation, if not shame.  
   "Yes," replied her father; "and nothing is too bad for the Saxons.
Why, it was but last year that King Aesc of West Kent, after I had duly
bought the monopoly of the wool-trade from him, let three ships of my
neighbor go by full laden, so that the price fell to very little. When I
complained, he burnished up some old charge against me, and held my  
  
Page 71  
  
next convoy for double tribute. Oh, the Saxon is the ruin of the British
exporter!"  
   "We ought not to submit to any tribute," said Aurelia, darkening.  
   "The Thames should be as free as the Severn," added Cian.  
   "True," admitted Constantine; "but we count ourselves fortunate when
it is half-way open on any terms. Perhaps the emperor may help, and the
council. But I fear you will see a bear-baiting, as usual--with
Constantine as the bear," he added ruefully. And now they are coming for
us."

CHAPTER VII.  
  
FEAST AND SONG.  
  
Many a mead hall              
Fragrant with human joys.  
                                --THE RUIN, *Codex Exoniensis.*

  
A NOTABLE banquet awaited them in that great dining-hall, which its
owner yet persisted in styling the triclinium, while so many of its kind
had gone to ruin or been given over to later ways.  
   The great table and the couches round about occupied nearly one-half
the floor; harpers were stationed, in bright apparel, at the other end.
The mosaic work of the space between was at its best, a picture of
leisurely Olympian enjoyment, from which the great-eyed Juno turned her
welcoming face on the mere mortals invited thus into the company of the
gods. There were many other decorations, above, below, and all around;
but none filled the eye and mind like this.  
   Both speech and song turned toward what was yet a vivid memory, the
war-filled siege and destruction of Anderida. There may have been
forethought in this, for nothing could more readily bring together  
  
Page 73  
  
in feeling the different elements assembled. Tigernach's pride was all
inwoven with the theme. The father of Caowl had fallen in a furious
endeavor to break through the beleaguerment. Constantine's one feat in
justification of his aspect--the relief of an ambuscaded provision
train--had been wisely and daringly performed not far away. Also he had
the chief management of supplies for the forest-entangled army of
Ambrosius during all that campaign; and if this effected little, the
fault was not his own. Every family of his Roman and mercantile
adherents, including nearly all the wealth of London, had contributed
both men and needful things, and had lost friends there. It was a
retrospect of complacent pride and of pity.  
   The woodland men had been glooming discontentedly over unfamiliar
ways. But now their faces quickened, and their voices came freely,
proving them at one with their company. Even their limbs grew more
supple in conformity.  
   Constantine, in high feather, looked toward Llywarch and Cian. "Will
one of our guests from the emperor," said he "give us in music the tale
of the town which is gone?"  
   "Willingly," answered Llywarch; "but we need the future, also, to
hearten us. Now I never feel sure of my prophecy unless I am hungry, and
the Saxons before me, pugnacious. Then I can prophesy  
  
Page 74  
  
heavenly vengeance very confidently. But Cian here, if he is strong
enough, will find Tophet ahead almost any time for anybody, and not mind
the trouble at all."  
   Cian's face, perhaps from weakness, had a faraway look. He rose
without a word, and took the great harp in hand. In his touch and voice
there was something compelling, so that they bore the hearer's heart and
mind with them, into what had been, and was no longer, and into what was
yet to come:  
  
                                           THE SONG OF CIAN.  
  
                                  Where is the woodland city,  
                                     The city beside the sea,  
                                  White from her ramparts towering,  
                                     Queen of the Andred lea?  
  
                                  Lovely her courts were, and woven  
                                     With rainbows her palace walls;  
                                  The voice of her many fountains  
                                     Was the song of the waterfalls.  
  
                                  But ever a threatful shadow  
                                     Grew from the eastward haze,  
                                  Out of the bath of burning,  
                                     Dawn of the evil days.  
  
                                  And ever a wordless horror  
                                     Deepened in heart and eye,  
                                  Till the noisome breath was o'er
her,  
                                     And the coils were winding nigh.  
  
                                  Then broke her trance of anguish  
                                     Abroad in a mighty wail;  
  
Page 75  
  
                                  And the forest arms gave echo,  
                                     Smiting the monster's mail:  
  
                                  For round the tightening spoiler  
                                     A whirl of fury sped;  
                                  And still the spears of Britain  
                                     Drove at the giant head.  
  
                                  But foes more grim and ghostly  
                                     Hid by the idle gate;  
                                  And the life within grew weaker  
                                     In all but the force of hate.  
  
                                  There came an eve and a morning,  
                                     The blackness of Hell between;  
                                  By fire-waves broken, and flashes,  
                                     And outcry wild and keen.  
  
                                  The sun came up through
smoke-clouds;  
                                     Never a soul was near.  
                                  The sun went down in glory;  
                                     But the walls were riven and
drear.  
  
                                  Drear was the riven rampart;  
                                     The light of her brow had fled;  
                                  The maiden city of Andred  
                                     Was a city of the dead.  
  
                                  Nor ever morrow shall see her  
                                     Blithe as before and fair;  
                                  The life that she found so lovely  
                                     Is a life she may not share.  
  
                                  A thing of blackness and ruin,  
                                     Of lichen and mould and rime,  
                                  Of waste where there has been
beauty,  
                                     She waits till the end of time.  
  
Page 76  
  
   He paused a moment, with one or two hesitating notes, then swept
on,--  
  
                                  But she, the lordlier, grander,  
                                     Who proffered the aiding hand;  
                                  So long as the Thames runs seaward,  
                                     So long her walls shall stand.  
  
                                  The tempest may break upon her,  
                                     The billows may whelm and hide;  
                                  But there with the life still in
her,  
                                     She stands in the ebbing tide.  
  
                                  Nor all of the world's old grandeur  
                                     Holds aught to hers akin  
                                  In the noontime of her glory--  
                                     The town by the reedy lynn.  
  
   Had Cian, as he went to his couch, a faint memory of that other
forecast, "a city nearing its end"? Yet surely both were true. *That*
London should die; but London should live on.  
   For a moment all were silent, looking at each other with widening
eyes; for it was a very wonderful promise that he gave to men who felt
the overshadowing of Caerleon from afar, and knew themselves outshone by
that Caer Segeint which the Romans had called Calleva. Surely there were
at least three more towns in Britain already beyond them.  
   But at once all doubts were swept away in the will-  
  
Page 77  
  
ingness of city pride; for what could be too good and fair to foretell a
man of that home which was his birthplace. Acclaim arose, beyond any
that the villa of Constantine had ever known. But the look of a dreamer
was on Cian still, and the strength and the vision were ebbing away.

CHAPTER VIII.  
  
LONDON AND LONDON'S COUNCIL.  
  
I saw Arthur                                  
Emperor and conductor of the toil.  
                          &nbsp--LLYWARCH.

  
CONSTANTINE returned cityward with a greater display, wherein Cian had
some part, against his will. His chariot was bright and strong again,
being prized highly as a proof of unusual resource and imperial favor.
After all, it was the easiest way of going, with a gaudy young
charioteer to drive. Moreover, Aurelia rode near him, resplendent,
watchful. Admiring murmurs from those around showed that the
gorgeousness insisted on by her father met their taste, if not wholly
her own. And, indeed, her beauty was of a kind to bear much brilliancy
of apparelling. Her chief concern was for her wounded guest.  
   The basilica, as the Roman faction called it, was a large domed
building of brick and marble, the former predominating in the walls,
where the white courses were narrow and far between. Inside, the rule
was reversed, the very numerous fluted pillars of the  
  
Page 79  
  
main hall being Parian, or as pure. These were in two stories, the
gallery resting on the taller series, and bearing the lesser at its
front. All were decorated in the extreme. If such art were not the
highest, it at any rate made the place bewilderingly beautiful.  
   There was yet time to explore some part of London before the meeting
of the council; so Llywarch and Cian set out on a hasty round. The
chariot was discarded by reason of the general narrowness of the
streets. Often they had to ride singly, even in the saddle. In the
better parts northward, good houses, often of brick, less often of
marble, stood, each by itself, in ample grounds; but elsewhere there was
chiefly a tangle of alleys and painted or unpainted woodwork. Sometimes
a mansion would be found in a pack of shops like booths, attained by
hardly passable ways.  
   Along the river-front the sailor life and artisan life of foreign
lands had made some impress, there being even one little colony of
Saxons on doubtful tolerance. They were mainly of Kent, and recognized
as more human than the lately come barbarians of Eschwine.  
   There was no real risk; indeed, something of courtesy, by Vortimer's
command, everywhere awaited them. He had no wish to break prematurely
with Arthur the Emperor.  
  
Page 80  
  
Cian was growing weary, when Dynan came flitting after them to bring
them back. He was full of excitement and significance, talking rapidly
of the strangers in the city, their number and importance, the
entanglement of intrigues, the possible surprises. Llywarch replied
easily that it must all be very bad indeed if it could in any way
surpass the complexity of that ill-scented labyrinth.  
   But Cian went in silence, with a sense of doom. O, London, London! a
chaos of disorder, crudeness, and rottenness; of relics half given over,
and new, random passions and expedients warring on every hand! What but
worse confusion and destruction could possibly come of it all?  
   The council-hall was full now; eyes were turned every way with uneasy
expectancy. At once they were recognized; and a lane was formed for
their passage to the raised platform or dais, on which Constantine
occupied a kind of throne. At their entrance his face lighted, as though
the accession were a boon indeed. But instantly it grew high and stern
again, the face of the Rubicon and Pompey's overthrow!  
   "How little a thing would unsettle him," thought Cian, taking the
seat appointed, near Aurelia.  
   But on either side of the king-elect, Osburn and Tigernach had taken
their stand, the one rough-bearded and resolute, the other intent with
repressed  
  
Page 81  
  
fierceness, as any one might see. Presently Caowl also was called to
this post of honor, where his Hun-like visage, if not a decoration, had
very evident value among the mass of Celtic people. It needed all the
towering scorn of Vortimer lo hold them. They looked one at another, and
said that he would speak by and by, and they should know.  
   Who, indeed, of them all, Celt or Roman, had such eloquence of lip
and swaying hand, such goodliness and mightiness of limb, such smooth,
high-tinted, handsome breadth of countenance as Vortimer the Londoner.
He stood in the glare of lamp-light, where a little space had been made
for him near the right corner of the dais, his head rising above every
other with a profusion of clustering hair turning to waves and ringlets
of fine-spun gold. It was the head of a Grecian demi-god.  
   "Wonderful--here, and with that name!" exclaimed Cian to the son of
the Three Shouts, who leaned over him, expounding men and their
histories.  
   But a glance below answered him. Notwithstanding a prevailing
likeness, there were hints to be found in face and form of nearly every
conquest-wave or importation of soldiery which had ever diversified the
island blood.  
   "Not more than--some of the rest of us," answered Dynan. "Look at
Caowl. I credit him to some pretty recruit of Scythia who sought the
woods  
  
Page 82  
  
a century ago. As to Vortimer, the facts are known. His mother was a
slave to the Saxon, or wife unwilling, carried away from her father's
corpse, on that night of "fire-waves and flashes" and "the blackness of
hell," by one of the Merscwara serving under Elle. Her people had been
noble, her slain father a ruler of towns and men. Her grace and delicate
loveliness, well taught in every way, are said to have been surpassing.
For all that, she had no choice but to dwell in the marsh-border with
robber-folk and fisher-folk, just settling down to a rude husbandry, and
do the bidding of her captor in the rough work to which Saxon women were
used. There she bore him this manchild, with girls who died--and that no
doubt was best.  
   "But she never found home among them; and always, when occasion
served, there came piteous messages from her to London and to the
woodland people and to the fortress towns yet held for us, imploring
rescue or ransom. But she was beyond help in arms, and the chief who
owned her laughed at every offer while her beauty lasted. When that was
gone he made his best bargain, Saxon-wise, throwing in the boy rather
than lose the sale, and because there was no love between them.  
   "So she got into friendly hands again, choosing the Andred shadow, as
best suiting her; for in few years she had grown bitter and crone-like,
She gave  
  
Page 83  
  
the boy a new name, taking that of him who first made head against the
invaders, that her son might not bear himself less hardily, nor give
them any peace. And, indeed, he has done them great injury in raids and
thicket fighting, for, however it may be elsewhere, there is not often
anything but war along the southern border of the great wood. It is a
life to breed turbulence; and he brings his turbulence here, along with
those great thews that his father left him, and a tongue that is very
persuasive and inciting among men of our race."  
   His attention was wandering to a group of tall men by one of the
doors, whom all about them regarded hatefully. Their weapons and costume
showed them to be Saxons. One stood in their midst, as if designedly
covered by the others, although maintaining a defiant calmness.  
   "The Sword of Fire," murmured Dynan.  
   "Eschwine? Ah!" said Llywarch, "a bad place for him! Hence this
quietness. When the wolf is in dread of being butted to death, he holds
his peace, and maintains his dignity."  
   "Eschwine never yet kept peace in any sense. He will speak; be sure.
No doubt he has some ledge of safety."  
   "And who are these?"  
   Another party, wholly mail-clad, were just entering from the opposite
side. They passed at once into  
  
Page 84  
  
shadow. One of them wore steel, from crown to toe. It was bright as any
mirror. This alone marked him out from all present.  
   "If you know not, how should I?" inquired Dynan significantly. Cian
nodded.  
   "But yonder?" said he, quickly casting his eyes toward the gallery,
where a hungry intensity of expression, bitter yet exalted, came to a
focus.  
   "They are Oisin's Christians, village people mostly. Yet some are
Londoners, and they grow in number. Oisin is the man to make them grow.
It's a frightful thing to be a preacher, anyway. Think of having to pour
heaven and hell white-hot into men, and work holy magic over them--for
without miracle, what sanctity? And to have all his labor swept away in
an hour by jeering demons! No wonder he chants to wild music!"  
   "That seems the sort of thing to expect of everybody," said
Llywarch."Denunciation is the one strong point of your Londoner. Do you
happen to see anybody, Dynan, who is not eager to denounce?"  
   The assembly grew impatient. Constantine had delayed, and delayed
again, the inevitable moment of collision. There were derisive calls for
"his majesty, the purveyor."  
   "Now, now!" urged Osburn. Constantine arose, incontestably royal in
bearing, as though he had  
  
Page 85  
  
chosen his time, and all things were working together excellently.
Briefly referring to the choice before them, and the two envoys now in
their presence, he called on them first of all to hear the message of
"the conqueror of conquerors, the ruin of the Saxon, the salvation of
Britain, the immortal and imperial Arthur."  
   At that there was acclaim from all quarters, even the Saxons joining
recklessly. Only the man in steel and a few of Oisin's people kept
silence.  
   "Prince Llywarch of Argoed is the bearer, of whom you know," said
Constantine, presenting him.  
   Vortimer responded for his faction, "We do indeed know of the Prince
of Argoed. May his message prove as welcome as his song ever will be."  
   "If aught have a sound of severity," pursued Constantine, "let us
remember that our turmoils and standing alone have not been
blameless."  
   There were murmurs of displeasure.  
   "At least," he urged, "you will hearken to the great emperor's words,
not mine." But he could not keep the deprecating tone from his voice.  
   Llywarch looked over the concourse of his countrymen with a friendly
gaze; calmly smiling. None could fancy any unkindness in his face, nor
any weakening, by excuse, of what he was given to convey. His voice
reached every corner of the hall. He read:--  
  
Page 86  
  
   "To the present rulers of London.  
   "Arthur Mabuter, Emperor of the armies of Britain, sends greeting.  
   "That I know not your true title is enough to show the confusion of
your unhappy city, wasting her strength in senseless broils, while
Britain suffers. Nor do these matters improve; but even grow worse,
insomuch that ye can no longer keep your own borders.  
   "Now, we have sure knowledge that the Saxons of Deira and many more
are gathering about Caer Ebrauc and beyond the northern woods,
undoubtedly in such numbers as will task the whole strength of the land
to meet them. If this suffice not, every city, even the most distant,
the most secure, will be endangered.  
   "Therefore I, who have heretofore entreated and adjured, do command
that you send forthwith a good force of men under capable captains to
the camp of our army.  
   "To assure this, if the succession be still unsettled in your city, I
commend to you the house of Constantine, kindred of Ambrosius, well
knowing that there can be none with greater natural claim to your
devotion."  
   Uproar was seething before he had ended. The little kingdom had so
long ordered, or disordered, its own affairs, that intervention seemed
revolutionary, even to those who favored it.  
   "Constantine!" shouted Vortimer, swollen with derision, his arm
brandishing as the words crowded. "And is there none nobler for the
Briton to follow, for the Briton of Britons to name? Constantine, the
valorous purchaser, the hero of the provision trains, the doubtful
branch, half disowned and wholly  
  
Page 87  
  
unworthy, of a foreign tree! Is it Arthur of Celliwig who bids us bow
down before this shaking, mimic Cæsar? Verily, the curse of the
world-curser is dangling about us still."  
   Constantine held a stern front, but shifted uneasily. Aurelia frowned
and reddened. More than one of their party was on the point of
interrupting. Cian rose first, though painfully, with the silver
misletoe full in view, a guaranty to many below. His face, dark and
spiritually exalted, was as true to the Celtic race tradition as
Vortimer's belied it. His voice went clearly abroad with lingering
emphasis,--  
   "I also am a Briton."  
   Whereat, as more than self-evident, both Tigernach and Caowl, with
more, began to laugh mightily.  
   "Assuredly," began Vortimer. But Cian went on,--  
   "I have waded with our Emperor waist-deep in the red water and
shifting sands of the Glem. When Arthur darted up the Duglas side
through the slaughter of the green embankment, I saw the blades and
spear-points fly from him like icicles from a winter-sheeted tree when a
strong wind shatters them. Let Vortimer lead the men of London, and
prove beside the Emperor Arthur what better may be done by British valor
unbreathed on of Rome."  
   "I have led them," retorted Vortimer sullenly and defiantly. "In
skirmishes,"and "With our aid," in-  
  
Page 88  
  
terjected Caowl and Tigernach. "So will I lead them again," he
continued, unheeding. "Think not, Prince Cian, there is no fighting but
in the far northwestern hills and northeastern marshes. There Arthur's
victories have been. But who fights for us,--a mere wedge of Britondom
left pushing out into the mass of the enemy--the South Saxons, the East
Saxons, the men of the populous Caint? Who but ourselves, left lonely?
We grapple with them in the fastnesses of the Andred wood, the vales
below Caer Collin, the open land between the Thames and the Cray. Wonder
not that we must lose a little, when we have held so much so long and so
well. Ask not of us to drain away our life-blood, with the Saxon almost
at our walls. And since Arthur of Celliwig has done so little to shield
or aid us, why should he have more at our hands than we of him?"  
   "No, surely," called out Dynan, "since that would be transcending
salvation. Little good would your bush-wrangling have done, had those
\`northeastern' and \`northwestern' battles gone the wrong way."  
   Vortimer waved his hand impatiently. "I hold no discussion with
triflers, nor with little emissaries of the usurper. Be sure our goodly
city will never need aid nor fear enemy while the head of Vran watches
from the White Hill of Cynvelyn."  
   "Woe betide us! Woe betide us!" cried a shrill voice from the
gallery, and looking up, they saw the  
  
Page 89  
  
craning, narrow, bird-like visage of Oisin the Christian preacher bent
upon them. The power of his eagerness bowed him forward like a strong
wind, until he seemed likely to lose his balance and pillar-hold
together. His brow was ridged between the eyes as if by unremitting
pain. Those eyes burned. The frivolous decorations beside them, cupids
and vine-sprays and bacchanals, deepened that burning by contrast. He
gathered himself a little, as attention centred on him, then burst forth
in passionate invective: "Woe betide us for that our strongest can but
wrangle over the hearth-fire while the slaughterer is in the fold; that
our wisest put their trust in the promise of a dead magician, or in a
soldier-king seeking his own glory far away! Woe, for that ye tear each
other, one and all, like most unworthy hounds, and are given over to
believe the lies of the heathen; and open not your ears to the great cry
that goes up continually from the places of anguish and desolation, nor
know that the one true cause is the cause of God's suffering people, and
the one true leader is the everlasting Lord God of Sabaoth!  
   "What mean ye lurking here or idling otherwhere, when His dread
summoning is abroad? What mean ye, when the death-wails have not yet
ceased their shrilling from the pleasant villages of the East,--those
death-wails which are but the precursors of your own! Ah, that Arthur
could but see as I have seen,  
  
Page 90  
  
and loathe his glory! Far away at the north, far away!--yet how near is
the murderer in the home-stead, Eschwine, the Sword of Fire, where
hamlets roll up their sad witness unto heaven!  
   "I tell you, men of London, there was a village once. You knew it
well, and I knew it to my appalling sorrow. Peace abode there, and
comfort and virtue, a little nest of all kindly good that we had made,
although so near the heart of all evil that is under the sun. But there
came to us a day of rumors, and the going forth to fight, and the quick
warnings of those who fled by, all broken, and the growth of clamorous
voices, and the crowding, crowding of terror.  
   "The tale--have ye forgotten it? Yet dare not I again abide the
telling. Go search the fields for the split skulls of our old men,
whitening like dog-bones where they fell under the swords of merry
making pursuers. And this were mildness, were mercy! Oh, the damnable
sea-people, the wolfish and impious Saxons, abominable heathen,
God-hating and God-hated, bloody followers of Eschwine, that prince of
demons, whom may God speedily overthrow in the fires of hell forever."  
   A deep angry hum followed this appeal of frenzy. Eyes were turned
murderously on the little party of Saxons, who stared back, though
doubtless ill at ease. Their leader pushed the others aside, and stepped
out,  
  
Page 91  
  
that all might see. He had bony, aquiline features, keen and
enterprising, and only less brown than his hair, matching, likewise, his
tall, broad-shouldered, very sinewy form; a face hardly capable of
indolence or meditation; watchful, unremorseful, daring, dangerous.  
   "With many thanks," he announced, "I am that Prince of Demons, coming
under safeguard of Constantine, your king."  
   "Who is this that palters with the powers of darkness?" demanded
Oisin.  
   "It was weeks ago," Constantine began, "and for a meeting"--  
   "No time was named," the Saxon shouted; "to your word I hold you."  
   But at this a great baying began. "Give him the safeguard of
Hengist," cried one. "Have you forgotten the feast of the Long Knives?"
jeered another. A third, behind Oisin, called aloud, "It is time for the
Sword of Fire to be quenched in blood."  
   Vortimer, more concerned for his own interest, added his cry, "Behold
a Roman cloak thrown over the dripping hands! O men of London, behold
the boon and the giver!"  
   Constantine wavered visibly. "It was for your good; it was in your
behalf," he protested, facing about, as the stress of the uproar
shifted. "It was for our dear city and her people, God be my  
  
Page 92  
  
witness. Yet if I exceeded--I was surely not king then"--  
   But his daughter had half risen, with shamed, imploring eyes that
held his own. In the pause, came Eschwine's voice clear and
fearless,--  
   "Give me that maid, and I will bring you a crew to lash off this
yelping pack, and have done with them. Give me her. She is tenfold the
man of any of those who scream and gibber about us."  
   But the very splendor and excellence of her, standing there, made the
demand all the more obviously extravagant. Laughter ran through all the
hall, with lessening of Eschwine's danger. "Nothing less than the lady
Aurelia?" cried Tigernach. "One would think he would be glad of any
chance to save his forfeit life."  
   "Forfeit or no," said Aurelia, "he cannot fall here by any hand but
that of an enemy to me."  
   Her voice, full and musical, was welcomed by a hush that made every
word audible.  
   "Well said, my Roman princess," cried Eschwine jubilantly. "Between
us we will make such a throne as no battering-ram on earth shall topple
over."  
   Amid the beginning again of wrathful murmurs, Aurelia looked at him
steadily. "I can have nought but hatred," she said, "for the doer of
deeds of hate, and a good longing to see the smiting down of the
merciless."  
  
Page 93  
  
   "Amen!" cried Oisin.  
   "I like you none the less for plain speaking," averred Eschwine. "But
when was it ever heard that war went on without bloodshed, or that the
fighting man with the fury on him could tell one red from another. If I
have been at fault, you will have the more scope in tutoring me."  
   "Too many British women have left their homes against their will,"
said Aurelia, "for one more, though the lowliest--and such am not I--to
go with any Saxon willingly."  
   Her face was set and stern. There was no yielding in her voice, but
calm scorn and resentment.  
   Eschwine answered, self-restrained, but chafing. "As for the girls
taken, spoil is spoil. So has it ever been. These noisy people may have
ours, if they can get them. No doubt many of our slaves might be bought
back again at fair value. Bear in mind, maiden, that we riders of the
rough sea ways are not given to abide denial from any, be she high or
low."  
   His followers had tried to check this impolitic close, and now
gathered again before him in his defence; for an angry rush was
beginning. Eschwine half drew his sword, and frowned, yielding not at
all.  
   But Aurelia interposed with a wave of her arm, and the call,
"Forbear." Constantine also com-  
  
Page 94  
  
manded, "Hold!" with strenuous endeavor to be resolute.  
   "Back, every man of you!" shouted Vortimer, not to be outdone. Then,
turning toward Aurelia, he added, "There is one member of the house of
Constantine whom we are all more than willing to obey." And many shouted
at his words.  
   "To this I hold you," cried a new voice, with a certain genial roll
in it, but more of authority. The man in steel was advancing toward the
dais. He bore his armor lightly, as if dancing under it would be easy to
him; yet there was dignity in his port also. Though lacking the towering
bulk of Vortimer, or even the more than usual height of Cian, his advent
was as if real kingliness had but just come among mankind. When he
turned his face uncovered to the throng, clean-shaven alone of all that
presence, with a complexion of surpassing purity, broad of brow under
browner waving hair, a face of romance and frankness, yet of forethought
and zeal which might become exaltation, men had no need to be told that
the very genius of peace and of war shone on them then out of the strong
blue eyes of the great Arthur.  
   Those were present who had spoken ill of him but lately; yet there
went up from nearly all the same enthusiastic cry, as they knew their
visitor. Only Oisin watched silently, and Vortimer with chary  
  
Page 95  
  
participation, each having a few imitators near him.  
   Arthur was kindly smiling, and his speech was easy.  
   "When a man is vexed, and writes over harshly to his friends," he
said, "what is there better for him than to come and see them face to
face? You had given some cause, you know. Truly, I come in the best of
time; for in my own hearing you have announced with acclamation what I
would most desire. Most gladly I make your will my own; seeing that of
your own free choice, and with uncommon zeal, you have preferred, from
the house whereof I wrote, the very maiden gem in her golden setting.
Let Aurelia, chosen of Britain as of London, be hence-forward your
queen."  
   There was a moment's hush; then the hall rang. Aurelia, thoughtful of
her father, had half risen to speak in disclaimer; but something in the
Emperor's look, between deprecation and command, held her still. She
would not harm nor hamper him in any crisis. Moreover, she had perforce
taken the measure of her father more clearly that day. It might be very
unfilial to keep him in that dangerous seat.  
   "Vortimer of Andred," resumed Arthur, "you have well said that London
needs both men and weapons to regain her losses and hold her lands. Her
turn shall come. Together, if we live, we will seek repri-  
  
Page 96  
  
sal, but not now. We have no choice but to meet first, and overthrow,
the northern enemy. London must aid me there, and you must lead her
men."  
   Vortimer looked unwilling, yet hesitated, as he had not before
Constantine or Cian. The unique fame of the Emperor, the continued
fortune which marked him out as strangely favored, the almost magical
element of surprise in his coming, whatever interval or obstacle might
lie between, his astuteness, his amplitude of resource, the
concentration of purpose that shone out of him,--all these made refusal
very difficult.  
   Before Vortimer had spoken, Arthur turned to Constantine. "Yours
shall be a wider charge than I had thought of," said he. "Our armies are
larger now than they were, and more scattered. We need a more general
and efficient system for supplying them. Constantine, as of old in a
lesser undertaking, can do more for us there than any other."  
   There was but little wavering, for the half-crowned was momentarily
losing his desire to rule the unruly. "Whoever exalts my daughter exalts
myself," he said. "I will go where I may be useful."  
   "What for me?" demanded Eschwine mockingly.  
   Arthur made calm answer, "You have your life. Let that content you.
It is safe, till we meet again."  
   "Perhaps I shall keep it a little longer," scoffed the Saxon; "I have
carried it in hand over many  
  
Page 97  
  
   British men, living and dead. And, queen or no queen, I will have the
maid."  
   But now his followers urged him, with entreaty, toward the door;
while a crowd of their enemies, hardly held in leash, came close
behind.  
   "Llywarch," said Arthur, "see them beyond the city wall."  
   Then he also departed for the villa of Constantine, his abode that
night.  
   Soon afterward the great council ended, all its members going their
ways.

CHAPTER IX.  
  
THE EMPEROR AND THE QUEEN.  
  
The chair of the sovereign,  
He that keeps it is skilful.    
                              ---TALIESMIN.

  
CIAN was glad to be in the open air again, on the way toward rest.
Weakened and fevered, he carried thoughts with him which were better
away. He had seen Arthur's eyes meeting those of Aurelia's; and already,
though he had given no name to his own feeling for her, a breath of fear
was astir.  
   Thus brooding, a dimness came over him, and he swayed to and fro
where he sat. But Tigernach sprang in beside him, and Aurelia rode up.  
   "Oh, pardon me!" she cried. "You have over-tasked yourself in our
behalf, and we neglect you."  
   For indeed she had not felt so drawn to his side, returning, as when
they rode in. The knowledge of it hurt her.  
   Cian raised his head, and sat quite stiffly. "I have no need," he
said.  
   Llywarch, who had rejoined them, looked at him and at her. "Surely,
Cian, the new cares of the  
  
Page 99  
  
throne"--he began. "There is enough in London to overwhelm all else."  
   Aurelia felt ill at ease under his words; for in truth it was not the
burden of greatness which had so filled her mind, as the vision of the
Emperor, flashing among them suddenly in assurance of power.  
   "I am not yet queen," she answered gently. "Nor ever will be, I hope,
if it is to make me behave unworthily."  
   Cian did not reply, being wholly occupied in mere endurance. Aurelia
watched him with solicitude.  
   "You saw Eschwine well away?" she inquired of Llywarch.  
   "Not very far, unhappily. I heard a word at the gate. He is yonder,
waiting."  
   Where he pointed, the Thames and the Lea out-spread together in an
estuary-like morass. There was vapor over it now. The light of a
half-moon fell slantwise on reedy, glistening expanses, on gleaming,
winding, branching inlets, on tufted black islands of forestry, all
mapped out as on the face of another world, withdrawn into the dim life
of menace and mystery.  
   It chilled Aurelia, and she turned silently away.  
   At her home they found her father with the Emperor. Already a general
scheme of commissariat had been outlined,--great depots, widely and
wisely distributed, with lesser between; interlinking caravan  
  
Page 100  
  
routes like the crossing lines of a spider's web, whereby material in
masses could at once be supplied anywhere,--a system worthy of an
earlier or a later era.  
   Constantine was astir with delighted interest as the possibilities
grew on him. He was deeply impressed by Arthur also, the soldier-king
eager for adventure being hidden in the man of affairs, prompt, full of
forethought, quick to learn, shrewd in applying, possessed of every
capability.  
   There was reason why Arthur should strengthen himself with all.
Guledig, imperator, emperor, men called him; but this was, first of all,
a battle-title, a kingship over armies and kings in armor; beyond that,
more or less, according to opportunity and the strain of public need.
Never before, in the case of a great city, had he ventured on
interference and command. Chance had aided him, but he knew that even
friends would recall his action uneasily.  
   The chiefs of Andred, lately in opposition, could not resist his
friendliness. He gave them straightforward words, though, evading
nothing, not even religious differences, for he made no secret of his
championship of the Cross. When the talk was of worldly and common
matters, his attention was calmly given to the speaker, or passed from
one to another whom he addressed. When he spoke of man's faith and soul
and after life, or of Britain's interminable struggle with the
destroyer, his eyes often wandered  
  
Page 101  
  
away and brightened, coming suddenly back with the fire in them of one
whose innermost passion and certainty were astir.  
   There was nothing marble-like about that face; rather a quivering
susceptibility, noticeable in the nether lip when not resolutely
controlled, as though emotions came too fast and strong for him. In his
greatest feats recorded of Arthur Mabuter, it was averred that his whole
frame trembled like a harpstring. More than one renowned enemy had felt
it with elation, yet broken utterly before the fury of purpose which
underlay that vibrating fineness of nerve. In spite of error, it raised
him above meanness and grossness, giving him a dedicate fervency, as of
one running a great race greatly. At his best, he might well be called
the soul of Britain.  
   After a time he drew away to Aurelia, who was about going within to
escape the chill of the autumnal evening. His manner was deferential,
with a touch of playfulness.  
   "I come to you as a bird of warning," he said; "and I would rather
warn out here."  
   Following his words, a wolf-howl came lugubriously from some forest
nook, with the usual discord-murmur of the hidden city for its echo.  
   "With such music?" she replied sadly.  
   His face grew very grave. "You see your task," he said. "To keep the
wolf from the door of a di-  
  
Page 102  
  
vided people. It has been mine also. But we are drawing mightily
together now."  
   "All but London! Poor, rich, great, distracted London!" said she.  
   "London will not fail such a queen," he answered; for the beauty and
easy majesty of her face and form were on him like a spell. Oh, the
incredible perversity that could turn away from such as she! He grew
stern at thought of it, and added, "Those who will be blind may at least
see their own ruin."  
   She answered gently, "They are my people. Without my destruction,
that shall not be."  
   His face brightened and deepened. "I could not ask a better word from
the best fighting man of my Round Table."  
   "No place for me! I am sufficiently exalted by the charge my Emperor
has given;" and she made him archly an obeisance.  
   "Greater exaltation may"--but he checked himself with remembrance and
misgiving.  
   She did not seem to give his words especial meaning; but his tone
awoke a slight perversity, brushing the sense of distance away.  
   "At least," she said, "I may be better employed than in tilting after
rainbow treasures and phantom goblets."  
   "It is not well to speak lightly of things beyond us," he answered
with serious mildness. "Our life,  
  
Page 103  
  
which begins in mystery and ends in mystery, is wrapped in mystery
between. But this is my warning. I pray you be very careful in your
coming and going after I am gone. Forget not that you rule only a point
of doubtful light, jutting into a black sea. Remember that London ever
wrangles with the hand that serves and saves it. Above all, bear
continually in mind that the Sword of Fire is never far away. Yet I hope
he may seek to do no harm. He will get word from me by Llywarch, who
goes with Dynan and Caowl into the great marsh to-morrow, demanding his
pledge of peace, toward you above all, under penalty which he will
hardly dare. He will keep it, I believe, since it has ever been
Eschwine's pride to make good his word. But be more than careful."  
   Aurelia looked at him, thankful and open-eyed. Then there came a
saddening thought. "How shall we drive out the hard Saxons with plans
which a woman's mishap may overthrow? You must not bring your men from
where they are most needed, for me."  
   "They will not stir," he answered. "The threat suffices. Trust me."  
   "Trust me also," she replied, as she passed within. "I shall be on my
guard."  
   But that did not long trouble her. She found pleasanter matter of
meditation in the Emperor's thoughtfulness.

CHAPTER X.  
  
A VISIT TO THE SWORD OF FIRE.  
  
Laughing, treacherous,                 
And of bitter disposition was he.  
                          -- *Black Book of Caermarthen.*

  
LLYWARCH awoke the next morning with a sense that some one was making
loud and distressful havoc of his heroic lays. He beheld, on the
bed-corner, Dynan, harp in hand, fantastically balancing, with the
airiest finger-play and a plain intention of fairy in voice and air.
Beside him, the gnome-like features of Caowl were broadly grinning.  
   "A wild pair for a sane man to be sent with," grumbled LIywarch, not
stirring. "There ought to be nightmares enough in that place without
you."  
   Dynan broke off with a final twist and shower of sound. "Oh, we are
the people to keep you to the marsh-lights," he cried. "If the hunt
should last so long."  
   "And howl at me in that demon-alluring way for greater cheerfulness!
But what must be, must be!" and with a leap he was beside them.  
   They took the eastern gate, and thence through  
  
Page 105  
  
that unkempt suburb which had been known in Roman days as "the native
town" to the open country beyond.  
   "The first time I rode out like this, three together," said Llywarch,
between his comrades, "it was in quest of a monster. The next time we
were after a holy maid."  
   "Two fearsome creatures," quoth Dynan.  
   "However, Geraint was with me, and Maelgwn."  
   "Whom they have taken to calling Lancelot, the people's spear. Much
he disturbs himself about the people!"  
   For there was jealousy abroad of this vain, uncertain, ambitious,
daring, and skilful Prince of Gwynedd.  
   "But did you find either of these wild fowl?" Dynan inquired.  
   "Not precisely, only a bit of some stone which the lady left before
her shrine, by chance or in reward. Merlin said it had healing virtue,
but I never could get sick enough to try. As to the dragon, I do not
know; many tales are brought to Caerleon and to Camelot. It makes one
unhappy to see his friends riding furiously after stray moonbeams."  
   "Yes, a holy maid would be better, if not necessarily more lovely;"
and Dynan took on an air of discriminating wisdom.  
   Near the meeting of the rivers a boat awaited them, containing two
marshmen, who settled to work  
  
Page 106  
  
at once with pole or paddle, as the depth of water varied. They wore
mud-stained breeches which had once been gaudy; above these, in the one
case, a sleeveless tunic badly frayed below the girdle, in the other, a
scarf wound obliquely and much faded. They had no other apparel except
otter-skin caps, which often lay about their feet, leaving uncovered
their masses of dark, coarse hair. They were very gaunt and yellow-brown
with wind and sun and the miasma of the marshes.  
   Curiosity as to the outer world was numb in them; but they had
learned to observe without speech, think within narrow limits, and act
noiselessly. They made at first one movement of recognition and
subserviency which was less surly in intent than in seeming; and now
they had eyes only for the banks beside them and the water ahead.  
   Yet they answered Dynan's questions; and Caowl, who best knew them,
added some explanations of his own. It seemed their people were but
scanty in number, with only one village remaining, a stronghold built on
piles, in a little lake near the river Lea.  
   One by one, the others had fallen; for the water-ways tempted Saxon
incursions, making the great marsh their nearest approach to London, and
a scene of\`continual warfare, though in a small way. The marshmen were
doing good service very savagely, threading the maze at all hours, with
swift knowledge  
  
Page 107  
  
of any hostile coming, retorting surprise for surprise; hardly so intent
on their livelihood by trapping and fishing, as on the merciless give
and take of their struggle with the invaders. Nothing but the tyrant
power of habit could explain their remaining year after year in such a
dreadful place.  
   Their crude stoicism made even a tried soldier like Llywarch uneasy.
They did not at all conceal their sense of the risk to that boat-load,
nor seem to care about it. "Eschwine," said one, "was more likely,
maybe, to spear the whole party, or to toss them, weighted, headforemost
into some pool, than to flay them in strips from head to heel, or put
them to fire-torture; but there was no telling what whim would take him.
He might even entertain them with honor, and let them go." It was grim
thinking to one with bright life in him, and no kinship to deeds and
beings of darkness.  
   Through a gap in an old Roman dyke, now long neglected and ruinous,
they entered a broad swamp-artery that swayed this way and that in long
curves, branching and dwindling. The tide at first drove them in, but
later was offset by the drain of the marsh, or in some other way, and
gradually ceased to aid.  
   Civilization was gone now, as though it had never been, except when
it came before them out of a dead world in stretches of yet
distinguishable road-bed, or some haunted pile, where fort or blockhouse
had  
  
Page 108  
  
defended it. In all but these, the mere savagery of nature had regained
its own.  
   Deer-tracks and the footprints of beasts of prey became frequent
along the margin; wild fowl hovered and floated numerously, or flapped
heavily away before them, after the manner of their kind when
affrighted. Once a lubberly bear broke away, half seen, trampling the
reeds. Amid an islanded bit of oak and yew forest, in a glade, a white
cow, wild and shapely, turned from drinking, to be presently lost in the
shadows.  
   At last they entered a pool toward the northern border of the swamp,
with raised and wooded ground on the farther side. Here they went
circumspectly, for there was no sign of any feathered thing which might
serve for food; and they looked that Eschwine should not be far away.  
   While they were near the middle, an arrow came from a reedy point on
the left, in a long, low flight, and struck slantwise across their bow,
barely missing it. Then they stayed paddle, and cried out their peaceful
intention, with only silence for an answer, until a second shaft, and
then a third, flew by them, the last between Llywarch's head and that of
Dynan, very venomously. So they came to regard that outlying Saxon as
not amenable to reason, but merely perverse and dangerous, and went on
without delay. Yet there fell two more of his favors, quickly shot,  
  
Page 109  
  
in their wake, whereat Caowl grew angry beyond control, and objurgated
the invisible archer, with hand-threatening, in a language that was
neither English nor British, but made up of shreds and patches for that
border.  
   Now, ahead, there were boats by the shore, or drawn up into the
bushes, and men very ready to fill them, called by the shouting. Yet
they desisted at command of Eschwine, who came to them out of the wood,
and waited, lounging and curious.  
   "He does not seem to intend any great harm," said Dynan.  
   "Our friends are not the easier for that," returned Caowl, indicating
the paddlers.  
   He met them at the landing, with curt recognition of these two, and a
very ample civility to the northern prince. But his look at the boatmen
should have made them visibly unhappy. He bade all to the camp, which
was in a sloping meadow, between a brook and a wood, Llywarch walking
beside him.  
   Here were men of divers aspect, busy over weapons, game, and apparel,
or amusing themselves as best they might, being the picking up of
sea-rovers who had welcomed any fighting hands for their crew. Yet an
amplitude of muscle prevailed, a ruddiness of face and hair, such as men
thought of in naming the English race. By the number of them, it seemed
that something graver was projected than waylay-  
  
Page 110  
  
ing the wandering marsh-people, or any such petty prey.  
   "Is Prince Llywarch here of himself, or from whom?" Eschwine spoke
with a twang, as at the council, but in the usual Celtic of the low
lands, not unlike the later speech of Brittany. Llywarch noted how well
he had caught the idiom, and how justly his words were chosen.  
   "From Arthur Mabuter, Emperor of Britain," Llywarch made answer.  
   Eschwine held himself square-shouldered at his full sinewy height.
"What does Arthur offer me?" he inquired.  
   "Offer!" cried Dynan.  
   Eschwine half turned to him with a look which might easily become a
menace.  
   Llywarch, understanding both, and feeling how much hung that instant
on himself, answered calmly, "The Emperor of Britain, victor in many
battles, re-conqueror of provinces and of kingdoms, offers to
Eschwine--peace."  
   The Saxon looked the surprise and distrust which were in him. His
followers, but half understanding, snorted with amused contempt.  
   "Will he add," inquired Eschwine, "the very handsome young woman they
call queen?"  
   "'Call!'" echoed Caowl; "be sure we will maintain her so."  
  
Page 111  
  
   "You may not have the chance," Eschwine suggested. "The way out of
here is hard to find."  
   Again Llywarch remained resolutely equable. "You are to promise, King
of Essex, to forego all annoyance of her.''  
   Eschwine stared, frowned, stirred angrily; then smoothed his face
again, with a harsh laugh. The other Saxons echoed it more loudly.  
   "Modest!" he cried. "I am to spare London, then, and its
appurtenances; in fact, almost everything and everybody! Is there any
more?"  
   Llywarch bowed. "Nothing more, except that it is for sixty days."  
   "Now, Prince Llywarch, tell me why, in your good judgment, I should
do this."  
   Llywarch watched intently that hard, keen, bantering face. He
discerned uneasiness and growing anger, but kept a "diplomatic cheek and
eye."  
   "Being Arthur's counsellor, when called on," he replied, "I cannot
well be Eschwine's also. Yet, consider; the bravest, if wise as brave,
will not war needlessly with a power inordinately beyond him."  
   "What is the meaning of that?" and Eschwine ground his heel among the
pebbles.  
   "I am bidden to say--and say but as I am bidden--that in case of
refusal, Arthur will leave all other enemies, and bring the whole force
of his armies, with London added, to utterly crush Essex. What, then,  
  
Page 112  
  
have you wherewith to oppose the whole power of Britain? The Sword of
Fire will be known no more among men."  
   Only a part of what he uttered bore meaning to the raiders and
loiterers around them. But they caught at the ending with fury. "Carve
the blood eagle on him!" yelled one. Others, rising, took up the cry.  
   Llywarch fronted them with kindly dignity; indeed, he stood as though
they were offering some tribute of admiration to his worth, instead of
the most frightful death-punishment devised by even their ingeniously
cruel race.  
   Their precipitancy saved him. Eschwine's countenance had been
tightening murderously. But this clamor came as a travesty on his own
purpose, half-formed. Moreover, some of the later accessions to his camp
had troubled him within the hour by unruliness of tongue where they
should only hear and obey. With a half-spring, and a snatch at his
weapon, he shouted them into silence. Then he turned abruptly, and
forced himself to be calm.  
   "Arthur has brave men," he announced at length.  
   "Many," said Llywarch. "But as to that, I have seen Eschwine also
affront death very lately."  
   The Saxon laughed a note or two, and took on a more genial aspect.
This fearless urbanity, being new, pleased him wonderfully. Llywarch
heard be-  
  
Page 113  
  
hind his shoulder Caowl's sigh, as if a burden were lifted. He could not
see Dynan. The marshmen were as impassive as ever, but with hopeful
eyes.  
   "I do not know that," said Eschwine. "We Saxons have weighty weapons,
and a long reach with them."  
   Llywarch looked around him. They truly surpassed the average of
British massiveness and stature.  
   He bowed in admission. "But it would have needed the hammer and the
arm of Thor to have shattered a way through a city's walls and an
army."  
   "I had Constantine's pledge. You came with nothing."  
   "Ah, no! With the message of one mighty warrior to another. Would any
one deem that so great an honor could end in harm or loss?"  
   Here even the wilder freebooters, easily shifting in mood, broke out
applaudingly. Eschwine looked on with no displeasure. "I don't wonder
that you witch men with your singing," he said. "Mere talk suffices.
Prince Llywarch, it shall be in every way as you have spoken. And now
between us, and with all these, the harp will be sooth and safe, to keep
the tongue out of trouble."  
   "What skill I have," said Llywarch, "is for you."  
   "Bring then your harp, Wolfnoth;" and Wolfnoth brought it.  
   "I cannot say how it may misbehave in British  
  
Page 114  
  
hands," he said, tendering it reluctantly. He was more fanciful in
apparel and eager of eye than the rest, but more indolent in motion. His
manner of holding the instrument showed how he prized it. There were
curiosity and interest in his face; for a master of some renown in the
craft was before him, being also the prince of a bold people.  
   Llywarch overcame his hesitation by minstrel free-masonry. He spoke
in Saxon, making sad work, for he had studied it little; but the other
understood him. "I can do nothing," said Llywarch, "without rhymes.
Therefore your hero-songs would be beyond me. It is wise to keep to
waters that one knows. I will give you a battle-piece of my people, put
together by myself. You may like it or not; I don't know."  
   Dynan had been edging near, with lively concern. "For the love of
God," he protested, "not the lay of Ambrosius!"  
   Eschwine watched. "What is that?" he demanded sharply.  
   The little man turned pale, but looked back, eye for eye. "The tale
of a death-fight!" he said simply.  
   His hand was on something in his belt--a dagger, Eschwine thought,
but really what had been called the fairy horn, which might never be
more urgently needed.  
  
Page 115  
  
   "The death-fight of one who stayed the oncoming of Cerdic," added
Caowl bluntly, being more mindful of the jealousies of that coast.  
   "That will I have, and no other," declared Eschwine, smiting his hand
on his thigh, and looking around him with a clearing brow. Alone among
the chieftains of the south, great Cerdic of Wessex as yet outshone him,
often drawing recruits away, so that rivalry was bitter, and envy
bitterer still. "Let us have it all, full tilt; it will do my men
good,"he cried gleefully.  
   Now, Llywarch had a different ballad in mind, and smiled inwardly at
the combining of Dynan with Eschwine to take the choice from him. Still,
the general aspect was favorable, and he struck into it spiritedly; the
rude harp, though poorly worthy of him, doing good service among
war-loving ears, in the echoes of the woods. Danger and the strain of
self-control gave his voice an unusual reckless resonance, when at
length set free.  
   His theme was the last charge of Aurelius Ambrosius at Netley, in his
old age and snow-white armor, defending the way to that Holy House named
after him (Amesbury), whence came his title, Prince of the Sanctuary.  
   And this was the lay sung by Llywarch, Prince of Argoed, to the Saxon
marauders in their camp by the marshes of the Lea.  
  
Page 116  
  
                                        THE SONG OF LLYWARCH.  
  
                                  White was the great steed under him,  
                                  White was the gleam of mailéd limb--  
                                  Swift as the warrior seraphim!  
  
                                  White was the steed, but dashed with
red,  
                                  White were the locks that blew
outspread,  
                                  White was the sword-hilt overhead.  
  
                                  White as the sea-wave's flower of
foam!  
                                  One shout for Britain, Christ, and
Rome!  
                                  Horseman and horse went shattering
home.  
  
                                  I saw them, as he onward sped,  
                                  White horse to white horse of the
dead:--  
                                  Then the pale banner whirled and
fled.  
  
                                  I saw the thousands in his wake,  
                                  The wingéd spears that stream and
shake,  
                                  I heard the crash, as thousands
brake.  
  
                                  And, borne upon the wind along,  
                                  A faint far swell of chant and song,  
                                  A jubilation vast and strong.  
  
                                  Where Ambrose and his thousands
fell,  
                                  There rises still that holy swell,  
                                  Proving their work was done right
well.  
  
                                  Where Ambrose and his thousands lie,  
                                  The stars of Heaven go sweeping by,  
                                  The eyes of Heaven that shall not
die.  
  
                                  Where Ambrose and his thousands are  
                                  There needs no light of dawn or
star,  
                                  For the great glory shining far.  
  
Page 117  
  
                                   Glory to glory, grace on grace!  
                                   Hero of Britain's ancient race,  
                                   Our crowned one of the holy place!  
  
   "It is not for me," said Eschwine, rising gravely, to offer gifts to
one not less great every way than myself, and tuneful, as I am mute, in
song. But I would change hunting-knives with you, if I may. I cannot
spare my sword; there is a fate in it."  
   "Willingly," said Llywarch; but all his companions looked uncertain.
Ever since the death-feast at Wipped's-fleet, the Saxon blade and Saxon
friendship had been frightful in British eyes. Yet all was done fairly,
and Llywarch found a handsome Frisian haft in his hand.  
   "Long ago," said Eschwine, "I took it in fight at sea."  
   His men applauded also, understanding at least the rush of the lines;
and that they dealt with battle. Those who had caught the names of a
hostile faith cared little, for religion was no passion with them.  
   Next Wolfnoth took the harp, tossed back his head, and began chanting
emulously, in a wild voice, to a wilder accompaniment, one of the
staves, unrhymed but alliterative, which delighted his people. The
envoys, in their turn, lost many of the words, and found more stress in
it than melody; but it somehow brought home to them the sense of death
affronted, of shadows overwhelming and feared not, of ear-  
  
Page 118  
  
nest grappling with man and fate, with gods and the hereafter.  
   When they departed, Eschwine called after them, "Good luck to Arthur
with Ossa Cyllalaur!"  
   Now Cyllalaur was the great Saxon leader of the north.  
   Llywarch bowed, but later said quietly, "In other words, he would be
well content to see an enemy and a rival wear each other out."  
   "There is comfort in getting off with a whole skin for any reason,"
observed Caowl.  
   The marshman in the stern grinned appreciatively. "But we will go
back another way," said he.  
   "I have no fear of waylaying," declared Llywarch. "We were quite in
his power."  
   "It may suit him to play cat and mouse," Dynan suggested. "I vote for
all prudence and caution."  
   "Do you mean that he would be capable of shaking hands for good-by,
with an ambuscade awaiting us by his orders?" demanded Llywarch.  
   "He would. He has done worse than that," Caowl replied, darkening.  
   "For my part," said Dynan airily, "I put no limits to him; he is a
very 'capable' man."  
   But this time there came no missile at them in crossing the pool. Nor
indeed afterward, except once, far away, when a spear was cast viciously
into the boat, and a dwarf, nearly naked, went scuttling  
  
Page 119  
  
off where pursuit was not easy. But they judged him to be neither a
Saxon nor any settled Briton, but a mere wandering waylayer, of malice
toward every one; for there were always a few such about these desolate
places.  
   Most of the time they were in what might be called open land for that
region, though the rank growth was neck-high to a standing man, where
not fallen in patches with the decrepitude of the year. At last they
made firm land at a ring of oak-trees, thick enough to form a screen,
enclosing a clear, shallow lakelet, the very centre of which was
occupied by the palisaded village of the marshmen. A platform running
around the inside of this tall barrier near its top gave the defenders a
great advantage. A single narrow causeway led out from shore; but the
gate of this was strongly guarded, and the whole structure, down to the
water-bed, could be torn away very speedily in case of need.  
   Here they rested a little time, with much consideration from the
villagers, who could find nothing less than magic in the successful
outcome of their errand. Thence they easily reached London.  
   When Arthur heard the tale, he blamed himself, even more than he
praised those whom he had sent into such danger. With all his knowledge
of Eschwine, he had not felt it fully. Savage demonry, beyond example,
was indeed very near the great city.

CHAPTER XI.  
  
THE PERPLEXITY OF ARTHUR AND THE MISSION OF OISIN.  
  
I have repented of the time that I entreated  
That thou shouldst not have thy choice.  
                          --LLYWARCH.

  
THOSE were noisy and busy days around London, preceding the coronation.
There was other marshalling, too, for the good will in the air and some
touch of policy had brought Vortimer forward with a late display of
military zeal; and Arthur, with this aid, and from other elements, began
forming a great encampment on the hills. Meantime, counselling with
Osburn and Aurelia, he supplied safer men gradually to the gates and
strong places which Vortimer had held.  
   Cian kept his room, lest, as they quoted him, he should glower, and
tear somebody. Although his hurts and later efforts might be reason
enough, Arthur felt disquieted, and set himself kindly to heal the inner
sore that he feared.  
   Cian half rose as the Emperor entered, but Arthur waved him down,
saying,--  
  
Page 121  
  
   "The wound always has precedence. If some one must suffer for my
being here, no doubt Tigernach will stand hard enough for two. Yet I see
no need, remembering that such as he have made me."  
   "It is beyond mortal power to make one like our Emperor," declared
Tigernach, with pleased and hot directness.  
   "Why, as to that," began Arthur, laughing. "But it is true I do not
owe it all to your people. When before was it ever heard that a man
should wave aside the purple to the shoulders of his friend?"  
   "He knew the gifts of Caradoc and the gifts of Arthur," said Cian.
"The event has proved."  
   "How it might have been, we cannot say. It is as it is. I am glad
that he is coming to help me. They are at Caer Segeint now, with Maelgwn
and the pick of his mountain men, also a very great following."  
   "And the Lady Guinevere," suggested Cian, with covert brightening.  
   "She also," Arthur answered quietly, and the men understood one
another; but Cian conjectured even more than Arthur had in mind.  
   "Lancelot takes a long road, in good company," said he.  
   That was an ill return, and he felt it so. But the instinct to awaken
anxiety for the one whom he did not desire was too strong for him.  
  
Page 122  
  
   "It is true," answered Arthur, and spoke of other things.  
   When they parted, Cian's eyes were hopeful and thankful, but Arthur
bore away more discomfort than should follow a kindly deed. Being only
human, whatever the credulous might say, with two women and two men to
think of, and no way opening that was free from harm to some one whom he
loved, he found himself distressed very sorely. There was that in his
heart which told him the wiser choice did not lie with the earlier
claim. Yet he had long felt the bright enchantment of Guinevere, and
been drawn to her in many ways of late, believing undoubtingly that her
sunny love was all for him, though no binding word had been spoken.  
   He knew that a halt would be made for the night, in her behalf, about
midway in the forty-mile ride which was to be that day undertaken. He
promised himself to meet her there in the morning.  
   Meantime, chance threw him again with Aurelia.  
   The yellow light was fading from the lawn; the brighter stars were
just coming into vision. She stood on the lawn hearkening to Oisin, who
gesticulated as he spoke. Arthur fancied, resentfully, that the passion
of admonition had possessed him. But she turned her face, and he saw
that it was not so. "This good man comes to me for aid," she said with
grave deference.  
  
Page 123  
  
   Arthur looked into her eyes, a little charged with excitement, then
at the anxious ones of the evangelist.  
   "What aid?" he inquired.  
   "It has partly to do with Eschwine," she explained.  
   "By way of conversion?" with a smile.  
   "No!" broke in Oisin shrilly. Then he recollected himself, hearing
their laugh, and added, "If there were any hope--why, surely--even
he."  
   "We must admit that 'even he' has shown some motions of peace and
good will," observed Arthur gently.  
   "Trust him not! trust him not!" cried Oisin. "His heart is the home
of hell fire. Not seven devils, I say unto you, but seventy times
seven!"  
   "Then I infer it is not--at present--a mission to the heathen?"  
   Arthur's glance questioned both of them with puzzled gravity,
although he smiled. Aurelia answered.  
   "As a barrier only. Oisin will make his home with the lake-people of
the great marsh. He will teach and preach to them, comforting and
uplifting them in every way until death. He will take his own homeless
villagers also, with such as may join them, to strengthen these hunted
creatures. They will settle on firm ground near the river Lea. I have
promised, with the Emperor's good will, such land and arms and other aid
as may reasonably be needed. Oisin hopes with time to build up an outer
and living  
  
Page 124  
  
wall for London on that most open side. And the people of the marsh will
no longer be crushed into mere brutishness."  
   Cried Oisin: "The distortion of their belief is unspeakable,
unspeakable! And as to ritual, I doubt indeed if they have any
whatever." His claw-like hands went up and down as he spoke.  
   "Is not this better than rainbow-chasing?" asked Aurelia, watching
the Emperor's eye.  
   "Nothing could be braver or grander," answered he. "I will not warn
you from slow dying by marsh-poison, Oisin; you have taken counsel of
One greater than I. I would ask His blessing of you, for in that name
only shall we conquer."  
   So Arthur Mabuter had the blessing of Oisin; and Oisin had of him
whatever might be any aid and stay.  
   The image of Aurelia, royal, yet not beyond archness, haunted Arthur
in the early hours of the night. But he slept at length; and when he
woke it was with other fancies, which drove him to the saddle a long
time before the brightening of the sky.

CHAPTER XII.  
  
ARTHUR WITH LANCELOT AND GUINEVERE.  
  
I wanted warmth and color.  
                          --TENNYSON.

  
ALL along the highway between London and that fair city whose ruins
underlie the Silchester of later time, villages attested the westward
shifting of life and traffic that followed the loss of Kent, Sussex, and
the lower Thames. Of these a few were still Roman in part, though the
largest had grown up on Celtic lines.  
   It did not suit the gay court people to abide in any. They chose
rather one of the wild spots which lay between, beloved by wandering
folk and by citizens willing to take some risk with their outing. Here
were you at once in both worlds; the merchant's caravan and the merry
riding-party being proper to the glade, while yet the Saxon scout might
prowl around its border in the dusk, or the great bear take complacently
the measure of its shadow by the light of the moon.  
   But there was clearly no present danger of human enemy nor of wild
beast. Long before Arthur  
  
Page 126  
  
reached them, he could discern the fire-glow in many places among the
trees, where each night-long blaze was dying down to embers. The tents
grew from ghostliness into brightness as the morning expanded.  
   Except the sentinels, few forms were yet astir. He recognized one
discontentedly. Tall, richly attired, perfect in grace, with a
cloven-pomegranate beauty of countenance, that was dreamful now, but
marked by spoiled wilfulness, dark pride, and fitful intensity, Maelgwn
of Gwynedd, whom we know better as Lancelot, stood watching the tent of
the incomparable Guinevere. Was it herself that he awaited by
appointment, or the mere sight and sound of her, issuing into the new
day?  
   Arthur felt the stir of such questions as he halted, and therewith
the sun and the lady came forth from their hiding together. Guinevere
was like the very heart of gladness in those golden rays. There was that
about her which, like the sunshine, belonged impersonally to one and
all, yet which every man might take unto himself, and deem an especial
treasure evermore his own. It came only from her glowing beauty, her
love of life and splendor, her ready responsiveness; or, if ever from
any deeper fountain, there was yet no such strength of flow but that
ambition very easily would turn it and hold it. Still there were few who
could believe her otherwise than very loving; as the sun itself appears
genial, and we call it  
  
Page 127  
  
so, although in truth it cares nothing whatever for human kind. Already
her name everywhere meant the enthralling, the irresistible.  
   On first passing beyond the tent-flap, she had Maelgwn evidently in
her mind, perhaps by reason of preliminary peering, for her smile turned
naturally, as by instinct, that way. But in a moment Arthur had that
welcome in his stead without change, as he came into her vision; nor
could either of these men be sure that it was not thus first intended.
Maelgwn received only her passing graciousness and the word-signal, "
*He* comes," abounding in loyal fervor, which proclaimed that it could
not doubt his own sympathy.  
   There was hot blackness in the face and heart of the Welsh prince for
a moment. Yet, Guinevere aside, he was Arthur's very stanch partisan,
and so had been ever since his first entry as a stripling on the life of
arms. He felt, admiringly, in another nature the aspirations which were
beyond his own. Sometimes it befell that an unreasoning passion of
remorse and penance took hold on him in their stead; but it never lasted
long, and left him open, as before, to very pitiful sinning. These
traits grew with years, but even in that earlier time he was far from a
continuously happy man.  
   His memory held many fond trifles which yet were no trifles at all to
his love and pride; though Guin-  
  
Page 128  
  
evere, if driven to it, would have denied all semblance of claim growing
from them. He was not wrong in holding himself more congenial to her
personally than any other man, though he were twice an Emperor; yet no
man could be so near her heart as the imperial power and dignities. A
dim occasional sense of this awoke in him a helplessness and bewildered
raging.  
   Yet now he greeted the Emperor with all, deference and welcome, and,
apart from his baffled hope in Guinevere, they bespoke him truly.  
   "So early!" he cried." It must have taken swift riding or no rest.
And all alone! Is that wise, my Emperor?"  
   "Wisdom would not be worth much penned in a corner or baby-tended,"
answered Arthur. "There are enough of them behind. This is a good swift
fellow," and he patted his steed. "As to rest, I had all that might be
had--while awaiting."  
   His eyes, at the last word, were fondly on Guinevere, who would not
meet them, but flushed and checked herself uncertainly in answer.
Maelgwn made obeisance and went rigidly away.  
   Arthur blamed himself momentarily for a tone which fretted him, the
tone of one tempted from thorough good-will by a sense of rivalry. But
it could not last in that presence.  
   Guinevere looked up, as in self compulsion, with  
  
Page 129  
  
delight in her eyes. "It is so long," she said, "yet so very kind of our
Emperor to meet us thus by the way."  
   They walked side by side toward the tent of her uncle Caradoc. Her
voice went before, and brought him out to them. On his bluff countenance
there was a shade of displeasure as he glanced at the receding form of
Maelgwn. A small part of it was for her also. The insight which comes to
the dullest by kinship and daily proximity made him unsure of her. Since
his great renunciation, there had been seasons of regret, and he looked
that his niece should bring the purple back to him, in a way, enhanced
by Arthur's glory. It was worse than vexation to think of any coquetry
with the Welsh prince. But he could not look deep enough, nor do justice
to the cool, unchanging purpose of Guinevere. He would not have loved
it, had he known.  
   A very giant of a man was this Caradoc Vriechvras, careless in his
strength, negligently ungraceful, and showing woodland build rather than
royal; a man living more in the body than the mind, proud mainly of
prowess, as some burly man-at-arms might be, over willing to dare,
impulsively generous to resign.  
   He gave Arthur a grasp that was hard to bear.  
   "And which Saxon shall we fall on next?" cried he. "I thought it was
Ossa Cyllalaur. But I hear  
  
Page 130  
  
strange tales of Eschwine's sauciness. I have men enough to break him
up, if ordered."  
   "He is no dry reed," answered Arthur, with a smile. "When the time
comes he will give some trouble. For the present I have his pledge of
peace toward the new Queen of London, where the chief danger lies."  
   "The new queen; her name is"--Guinevere suggested, as one who seeks
about in memory.  
   Caradoc was about to supply it, marvelling at her quick
forgetfulness, but Arthur spoke before him.  
   "Aurelia, daughter of Constantine." He fretted inwardly that he could
not make the syllables quite like those of any other. It was the more
unreasonable, since the present beauty eclipsed her, to his mind and
eye. Guinevere was watching him from covert with oblique demureness.  
   "A very musical one," she said sweetly. "But have you only this
Eschwine's promise? No hostage? Nothing in pledge?"  
   "A man's pride is the best pledge," answered Arthur. "Eschwine's word
is his God. He has never failed in it. He stakes his manhood on it."  
   Guinevere listened, childlike, as to wisdom in matters beyond her,
then answered with maidenly diffidence,--  
   "Yet--I was thinking of that Gaulish trader, who came and went so
many times between our city and  
  
Page 131  
  
the coast, and was always true to the least that he uttered, and would
do errands for one beyond the narrow sea, bringing all back faithfully,
and showed himself so very honest in little things"--  
   Caradoc interrupted her, with an impatient sound. "In brief, I
trusted him with a treasure caravan," he said. "The Saxons got it; and
he does not trade our way, being rich and wise."  
   There was a veiled keenness of satire in Guinevere's mild young eyes,
unnoticed by either of the men. "Are not the Saxons wily?" she queried,
in the same submissive way. "A woman knows little of such matters; but
they tell me so. May not Eschwine have been upbuilding his fame as a
promise-keeper, only to throw it away for a great prize? Or may not the
temptation overcome him? London is very rich, and I hear
that--Aurelia--is--exceedingly fair."  
   For she was testing Arthur; not greatly caring for the danger which
yet, by inner light, this woman, wilier than the Saxon, well knew.  
   Caradoc heard her with dissatisfied opening of the eyes. But he
caught the drift of her last words. It seemed to him that there would be
a better time to consider matters militant.  
   "It is true that women do not distinguish," he said. "Kings are not
chapmen. Wider experience will show. But now I must prepare for
departure," and  
  
Page 132  
  
he moved away with a sense of sagacity. There was a smile on his face as
he left to her the trial for that "wider experience."  
   Her scrutiny of Arthur was assuring. He showed no great concernment
of any kind, answering only, "It is so; a noble woman too, proud,
strong, and trustful."  
   In that she felt his regret, if not disquiet, for her own suspicious
knowingness. That mattered little. She fastened liquid eyes on his, hurt
and meekly protesting.  
   "But the Queen of London has seen so much more," she said; "and no
doubt is far wiser. I did wrong to obtrude my foolishness. But one
feels--and one counsels from"--  
   "Her kind heart," he responded, with quick self-blame, taking her
hand impulsively. "Don't doubt that I feel that, Guinevere."  
   Her eyes beamed into his with ineffable admiring devotion. "There is
one," she said, "who is too high-souled, too generous, for doubting. May
he never suffer for his greatness!"  
   In part, that was the true voice of her own spirit that day; in part,
mere audacity, affronting and trifling with what, as she had even then
some glimmering, was in store for them all.

FOREBODING AND DANGER.  
  
I have become a predicting bard.  
                          --RED BOOK OF HERGEST.

  
IN that morning's ride Arthur's fancy busied itself more than once in
discomfort with the picture of two royally fair women face to face. But
when it became real there was nothing to regret. Guinevere beamed and
flowed and sparkled in full wisdom of rivalry, and won her reward; for
this urgent speaking loveliness had power over him beyond any more
reticent though nobler beauty.  
   One kind thing he had done in preparing Caradoc to accept as
authentic his kinsman of London; and Constantine accordingly was made
very happy.  
   The coronation passed in all magnificence, a breathless, proud,
bewildering time; and the army, now swollen to great proportions, went
northward, leaving the young queen and the remnant of her people to face
whatever might befall.  
   Never in two generations had money flowed so freely nor in such
variety of coinage through all the channels of trade,--Roman gold from
Augustus to  
  
Page 134  
  
Honorius; the experimental island mintage of Allectus, the evanishing
usurper, and Tetricus, the tyrant of an hour; older British pieces,
ranging from the pure fine art of Cunebelline to mere Brigantine
savagery; the fair coins of Massilia and their Gaulish wheel-marked
copies. Yet the multitudinous bits of brass which alone had often served
their needs before were with them still for lesser uses, being mainly
the counterfeits or makeshifts of a hundred different hands.  
   But what all these had brought was of necessity consumed or away. In
food, apparel, arms, and men, the draft on the little kingdom had been
excessive. Londoners looked about them on empty fields and barns, on
empty shelves and warehouses, on lean garrisons, and streets with women
and children only, and there were stirrings of disquiet. Never had their
city been so tempting to a money-hungering enemy; never so ill
defended.  
   From the beginning Aurelia was alert to prepare and strengthen, with
Osburn for her general in command, and Cian for her counsellor and
guest. He was yet at the villa, guarded by Tigernach and a few
tribesmen. She saw him often there, although, following Arthur's
counsel, her main abode was now within the city wall. At times, with
returning strength, he joined her in journeys, undertaken hastily hither
and thither.  
  
Page 135  
  
   At first these were indeed royal progresses, that she might feel
amply guarded. But there was much to be done, and the cumbersomeness of
such doing was against it. Also the cost and the loss of time and labor,
when nothing could be spared, made it seem rather an evil than a good.
So she took very soon to plainer ways, which yet seemed safe enough.  
   Once, with Cian and Tigernach, she penetrated the Andred-wood to its
inmost hill-chaos of wild thicketry, and was greeted tumultuously on an
open plateau about old altars by a skin-clad assemblage, more barbarous
than any new-come Saxon, but with Vortimer's mother, and many older
memories, to keep them vivid in Saxon-hating. She made great friendship
there, for they delighted in her courage; and a band of their sturdiest
men went back with her, where men were needed. But most often her
wanderings were not so far.  
   Returning from one of these, a sound of ill omen came to Cian midway
between the city wall and the villa, a sound which had not been heard
before since the Emperor left them, a wolf-howl out of the forest. At
once that first desperate peril of the woman now beloved awoke in
memory; and her call for aid seemed verily to shock and thrill him
again, as the terrible pack broke around her, a note of far range and
compass, appalled, urgently appealing. He had  
  
Page 136  
  
this mainly in his thought as he turned to Tigernach, who rode near
him.  
   "Did you hear?" he queried.  
   "Could one fail, having ears? After all, a wolf-cry is no very great
thing in the woodlands."  
   "But here it has a meaning. The wolf returns," answered one behind
them.  
   "What then?" demanded Tigernach. "First time or second time, wolf or
Saxon or death's-head, the men of the Andred-wood are ready."  
   "Well said!" exclaimed Cian. But he had a sense of trouble impending,
as though in truth her need were calling to him.  
   He hinted this to Tigernach, who kept silence a moment, then
answered: "Prince Cian would have been quite well before this, if he had
but eschewed the ways of those who loll in hot waters, and sprawl,
gorging sumptuously, and are beaten in arms whenever they take the
field."  
   Cian laughed, saying, "That curse, at least, has not yet reached me."
But no doubt his fevered nerves might have their share in so vague a
dread.  
   That night their converse was of secret and eerie things, the
poet-mystic and mystic of the woods meeting on such ground with a
fearsome comradery. Were they not face to face with knowledge and peril
which went by the multitude unregarded, like ghosts in the day?  
  
Page 137  
  
   When all was still except the low wind, Tigernach yet lingered,
dozing. For all his disclaimer as they rode, a sense of menace to his
leader and the queen hung about him, even at the gate of slumber.  
   That leader's voice came again startlingly: "Tigernach!" He looked up
with a start. Cian was speaking with deliberate gravity. "Either the
dregs of fever-poison are yet in me, or I am haunted. I cannot feel that
all is well with Aurelia. I seem to be aware of something like a far cry
from her, and a dense cloud--nearing, nearing me."  
   "It is fever-dreaming," answered Tigernach decisively. But he rose,
and took down his cloak and sword-belt.  
   "What are you about?" Cian demanded. "If it be truly no more than
dreaming, what need"--  
   "There will be sleep-walking or sleep-riding next; and I cannot tell
what that might end in. Much better my riding--wide awake." He took a
lance from one corner of the room. "Prince Cian, if I bring you word
with all speed, will that content you?"  
   Cian looked at the devoted obstinacy of his face, and laughed. "I
would argue the matter if it would do any good," he said.  
   "Nothing does any good to an ill but the remedy. I am the remedy."  
   "More exactly, your journey, without sleep, after nothing. But--thank
you!"  
  
Page 138  
  
   This was given with a hand-clasp and grateful eyes. There was relief
in the tone.  
   Cian followed his partisan in thought a while. "Now he is crossing
the courtyard; now mounted; now over the bridge; along the road with the
moon rising behind him now"--until his own consciousness melted in a
jumble of fancies. He knew nothing more until Tigernach stood in bright
daylight before him.  
   Cian studied that face, remembering slowly. "I see that all is well,"
said he.  
   "Assuredly!" growled Tigernach; and he turned away.  
   Later he revealed that he had seen the queen, very early astir as was
her fashion, but easy in mind, even laughing. She was to ride somewhere,
on some errand, perhaps even his way. "Then our royal lady will have an
opportunity of explaining in person to Prince Cian that she did not
really call him to her at midnight."  
   Cian flushed and frowned. But he set the kind deed against the random
words, and forebore. He even smiled inwardly, noting that they had a
grievance in common. For wherein shall high and subtle prescience avail,
if it lead utterly astray? Yet no doubt it was far better that all the
prophecies of the world should fail than that harm should befall
Aurelia.  
   He watched for her through the day; but she did  
  
Page 139  
  
not come, nor did any certain tidings, except--late in the
afternoon--that she had ridden eastward toward Oisin, who was always
needing more and more for his amphibious mission. This made a ripple
among them; but it appeared that she had gone well attended, and there
could be no great danger by the way.  
   They spoke little after sunset, for Cian was weary of himself and of
all. He fell asleep quickly, with no soul-warning.  
   Again a cry assailed him! This time it was real and insistent: "Wake
and come! Wake and come!" A glare of lamplight filled his eyes.
Moreover, a hand was shaking him. Then Tigernach broke his bewilderment
with a great shout, rough and wrathful; and Cian all at once began
tumbling into his apparel and armor, thrust at him faster than he could
seize them. A few moments more, and they were mounted and speeding
away.

CHAPTER XIV.  
  
THE CONFLICT AT THE LAKE VILLAGE.  
  
True it is deliverance will come  
By the wished for man.             
                          -- *Red Book of Hergest.*

  
TIGERNACH was the fevered one now. "Faster!" cried he to the horsemen
hurrying behind them. "Faster! There's not one second to lose. Ride to
death; ride to death if need be!"  
   Cian put forth his hand to bring his follower within bounds. "Tell
me," said he; and in fragments Tigernach told him, with some aid from
one of Llywarch's two marshmen, who had brought the news, and was their
guide.  
   Eschwine had indeed broken faith, coming secretly against the lake
village, in the hope of seizing Aurelia. His force was a great one,
according to the measure of marsh-fighting. Oisin, in perfect good faith
and zeal, had tempted her to remain over long. There was barely time to
send this messenger to the villa, and one other toward London, before
they were wrapped all around with enemies. Neither had failed; for while
they spoke sounds of contention  
  
Page 141  
  
came to them, as though Osburn, with his mercenaries and citizens, was
vigorously attempting the guarded lower ford of the Lea. Their own route
lay otherwhere; a détour reaching the northern border of the great marsh
at a point where a path went inward--barely practicable and known to
few.  
   It was not until they had crossed the lesser waters of that river
that the uproar around Oisin and the queen became audible. At the same
time, under thick hanging clouds, a beacon-flare of red and yellow
light, waving with the wind, made a silent, powerful appeal for aid. All
around it were lesser lights, doubled by reflection in water, and broken
by intervening boughs. The marshman, pointing to these, laid his hand on
Cian's knee. While he pointed, these divided and multiplied, as though
fire were being borrowed from fire. All at once a flight as of
shooting-stars went centring in from them toward the roofs under the
beacon light.  
   Their guide gave a grunt of answered expectation, with no pleasure in
it. All behind cried out once, but ceased as suddenly. In that breath
came to them the fierce yell that went with the fire-arrows, and the
high-keyed, harsh defiance of the villagers answering.  
   Flight followed flight, with the same company of noises. There was
waving of flambeaux, also, about the palisades, and a huddle of dark
forms, actively  
  
Page 142  
  
moving, below them, with every discord of onset. Here and there a fresh
outburst of flame within, as some bit of woodwork caught fire, showed
the defenders with equal plainness. The outlines of the houses, too,
were thrown out with fitful vividness; and their walls and slanting
thatch danced back and forth between illumination and shadow.  
   Cian lost nothing of this, but saw as he hurried on, with only a
moment's halting. His teeth and eyes were set, his breath came
laboringly. Prayers and curses were in his heart together.  
   Suddenly there were no more meteors. The torches, being inverted,
flared higher, and then were dark. Shadows went hurrying back across the
half-lighted lake. A loud call of taunting and gladness followed them.
One crisis of the little city of refuge had come and passed in Cian's
distant vision; and, behold, it was living yet. But dwellings were
ablaze already, so there was no more need for the beacon.  
   Their course was yet wide of that shining mark. Impatience assailed
Cian; doubts began to hover; the night air, now clammy with marsh
dampness, chilled him thoroughly; but he clenched his countenance, and
kept on unquestioning.  
   The footing grew soft under a thin shell of frozen mire. At every
step they sank deeper.  
   "Where is that secret way you promised us?" Tigernach demanded
sharply.  
  

  
"They Went in Ribbon-like Order."

  
Page 143  
  
   "Here, turn!" was the marshman's answer, hoarse and savage as though
from hostile lips. His gesture directed them toward that lessening riot
of flame and the ruddy smoke-masses which overhung it.  
   They still went heavily, yet at first not increasingly so; having for
path a narrow ribbon of moist but solid land, which dangled a good way
out from the higher country into that bleak morass. They kept a
thread-like and winding order, following the guide with good heed; their
best light was the mere intermittent glimmer of a thin paring of moon
from behind the now broken and marching clouds.  
   At last they had to leave their horses under guard at a little eyot
of firm sod where some bushes grew, and pushed on afoot from tuft to
tuft very precariously, now leaping, now dragging one another out of
some oily hole where a man unaided would have sunk forever.  
   It was all a desperate task to Cian, the imperfectly convalescent;
but he called wit to aid nerve and sinew, measuring the steps, and
marking the footholds of the sure-stepping native next before him, and
leaving rescue-work to those who were in better case for it. All
strength which he could husband would be needed elsewhere, soon and
right urgently.  
   The lights, fading down, appeared ever farther and farther ahead,
until their seeming withdrawal grew disheartening. Then revelation came
very start-  
  
Page 144  
  
lingly. Once more the earth and air were alive with confusion of sound,
with volumes of reddening cloud and dragons of fire--all just before
them, with only a thin hedge of forestry between. They hurried on, and
paused, as yet unseen amid the lake-encircling trees, with the glare of
fire and water in their faces. Their nearest enemies were not a spear's
throw away.  
   Eager-eyed the tall Saxon bowmen stood, sending arrow after arrow in
long flight with fiery mane into and over the palisade, or bending to
light at the fagot-pyres the tow, tar-painted, until impatience drove
them, one after another, out through the ice-crusted shallows to a more
immediate share in the assault.  
   The lake on that side was no real obstacle to these fighting
watermen, except as they could not get footing for their strokes and
labor at the last. Already in and on the deep water, next the palisade,
there was a broad entanglement of boats and rafts and logs and swimming
men. Some of the latter were chopping steps in the tall piles before
them, others were swarming up with desperate energy at points that
looked more nearly practicable than the rest. Many more came to them
continually, either straight out from the shore, or around the village,
wading knee-deep, waist-deep, neck-deep, and waist-deep again, or
swimming overhand through the ice-film with great strokes.  
  
Page 145  
  
   To judge by the excited clamor and signs of effort, the besieged were
not less busy. At the moment of Cian's appearance, two or three of the
climbing Saxons were flung, from the top of the wall, with stabs or
without them, and the air thickened with other missiles, often glowing
hot, showered on the heads below. Yet the escalade was gaining, urged on
to fury by yells of fight in the marshes toward the Lea, which were
heard interruptedly through their own hurly-burly, and seemed
approaching, though distant still.  
   Osburn was coming--resolutely, vehemently, in spite of all
resistance, and with the utmost speed which it would allow; but he could
never come in time. Well for the village folk, well for Aurelia, that
there was no need to await him, with the Sword of Fire in person almost
over the palisade!  
   Cian quickly spread his men to cover that curve of shore from which
wading was possible, and then sent them at Eschwine, convergingly and
with a dash.  
   Even while the last lingering archers were staring with half-turned
heads at the sudden apparition of lines of armed men behind them, a
great shout went up from these, which every Briton knew, and the keen
cry of the marshman-guide followed it. As he sent that forth, he sprang
on the nearest enemy, spearing him through the throat, and driving
weapon and Saxon headlong into the water together. From  
  
Page 146  
  
the village came a glad chorus of many applauding voices. The other
Saxon bowmen hurried out to join their comrades, letting fly an arrow or
two behind them as they fled.  
   Nearly the whole Saxon mass was now in such depth of water as allowed
neither secure footing nor free arm-play. Before them was the
well-manned barrier which had so tried their strength already; behind
them a bristling array of new enemies, not very many in number, but with
order yet unbroken, pausing where the bottom suddenly fell away,
standing knee-deep or thigh-deep without harm since their part was
simply to hold their places. Only at the ends of the curving line was
there any outlet.  
   Eschwine stood on the platform of the palisade with a handful who had
followed him, fighting bitterly to make good their hold; while Aurelia
urged forward her guards, and Oisin called on the wild, lank villagers,
to dislodge them.  
   Such of the Saxons as were yet climbing scrambled desperately up to
their king. The others floundered uncertainly for some moments, with
cries of discomfiture. Then, back toward the shore went the sea-heathen,
swimming and wading as they could, mostly spear in hand, but some with
swords, battle-axes, knives, and clubs of war, keeping no order, but
fierce as cornered wolves.  
   There was very grim fighting then, so that the  
  
Page 147  
  
water frothed and spouted with the frenzy of it, and men everywhere fell
singly or in writhing and strangling couples. But the Saxons went down
seven to one, growing momently less. Very soon there were none
withstanding or assailing the Britons, but only a few who had broken
through or swam around, and were now hastening to the woods, if so they
might escape pursuers, and another few who sought refuge with Eschwine
above the palisade.  
   These last were closely followed, Cian's men cutting into them as
they swam, or dragging them down by the feet from the rough wood.
Nevertheless, enough of them reached the top to extend very briefly the
struggle of the Essex king. He gave those few moments to a charge
against Aurelia, most likely in mere fury and bravado, for he could not
hope to carry her away.  
   She did not shrink. The press behind her was such as to preclude any
motion. Cian, painfully drawing himself up to the top of the palisade,
discerned them both with blurred vision, and tumbled over upon the
platform before her in a last violent effort.  
   Then another form sprang over him, a starved infuriated hovel-dweller
of that border, prematurely aged, who had lost all who were dear to him
by that Saxon, and had passed bodily under his torture. Like a figure of
frenzy this odd assailant came at  

Page 148  
  
the Saxon chief, bony and knotted, agile as a dancing dervish of later
days, white-hot with remembered outrage and ravening zeal, a firebrand
in one hand, a great knife in the other, striking right at the enemy's
eyeballs with the rapidity of cat-clawing, either weapon or both
together--a very mountain-devil of a fighter.  
   Eschwine was bewildered and half blinded by the fantastic onfall. He
took one step awry, swaying for the stroke that should end it; lost his
balance under a new smiting of the torch, and went headlong down into
the water, leaving that human firebrand to chant his pæans of victory
alone.  
   The villagers and London men, with a shout of laughter, flung
themselves on the remaining intruders, hewed them down, and cast them
over after him, all but one likely youth, whom Cian bade them spare.  
   There were splashing and fighting where Eschwine made his unwilling
dive, and many calls afterward, as that he was here, or here. Those
within the wall were in high hope of his capture. But at last no one
could find him, and there was little doubt that some chance had aided
his escape to the wood.  
   Not long afterward, Osburn, with his forces, came up, all opposition
having suddenly left them. Their loss had been far greater than that of
the other Britons, as Osburn had steadily to dislodge an enemy  
  
Page 149  
  
noted for doggedness, who fell back again and again from one strong
position to another.  
   He was ill-pleased with Cian that even one prisoner should be taken
after so much slaughter and broken faith, and incensed above all against
Oisin--who joined very willingly in his condemnation--for having by his
spiritual solicitude brought such trouble on them all. Not even the
queen escaped his censure. He would take no rest until he had her within
London wall again.  
   Therein the villagers mightily concurred. She had indeed been the
soul of the defence from its beginning; but what need to defend, if
there were no temptation for Eschwine? Better than royalty with
fireworks was their safe and wonted obscurity.  
   Meanwhile Eschwine, safe now beyond the Thames, was blaspheming and
grinning together over the grotesqueness of his overthrow, as he made
his way to take shelter with that half-ally, half-competitor, Aesc, the
Under-king of West Kent. He had hope of aid there, when wrongs and
opportunities should have been thrillingly presented. He had no thought
of giving up his purpose or his future prize after all that had been
staked thereon.

CHAPTER XV.  
  
LONDON BEFORE THE STORM.  
  
I love not him that causes contention.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
IT was but a dismal home-journey to Aurelia, notwithstanding the great
joy of rescue, and though they spared her whatever they could. There
were no sounds to distress her, for the Saxons had been put beyond
moaning, and the wounded Britons borne tenderly away; but along that
hard-fought road, which was rarely more than a mere path or cartway, the
dead of either side were strewn. Hide-bound forms of the populace, and
sons of wealthy houses in glittering mail, encumbered the shallows of
the Lea. Roman-trained mercenaries, iron fellows of the Teuton
borderland, with teeth yet locked together and blades held forward, lay
where Osburn had led them again and again, up the eastward slope, ever
stabbing at the face, until at last with those insistent points he bore
a way over and through. They were very grim relics to her in the light
of that wintry sunrise.  
   She paused on the London side with a backward  
  
Page 151  
  
look, wistful and faintly shivering. Silence fell on her companions. The
face of Osburn darkened with returning blame.  
   "We have many dead," he reiterated slowly. "We cannot spare so
many."  
   Cian saw her under lip quiver, and it stirred him.  
   "It is the part of a man to die for his queen," said he.  
   "Doubtless--where she is queening."  
   "Ask any one who fought there. How could her bearing have been more
queenly?"  
   Osburn bowed with gravity. "Undoubtedly a hot fight, well
fought--which never needed fighting. Is that queen-craft?"  
   "You presume too far," began Cian angrily; but Aurelia interposed.  
   "I cannot blame Osburn," she said; "and if I could, I would not,
after what he has done for me. Nor will I blame myself unduly. I was on
my proper errand, with good intent; and I am well assured that the Sword
of Fire would have found occasion before long if I had stayed or gone
elsewhere. For what truth was in him had wholly turned to falseness. My
danger might have come where Prince Cian could not so fatally have
trapped them. But I will not serve again as a marsh-decoy if I can help
it."  
   "Your majesty is very right!" answered Osburn, with slow emphasis.
"Yet it was the hardest cuff  
  
Page 152  
  
   Eschwine has taken. Mere luck saved him, to sting again--if we let
him get ready."  
   "But Eschwine is in neutral territory."  
   "No Saxon is neutral," exclaimed Tigernach.  
   Osburn grunted assent. "We should strike all who harbor him, and talk
about neutrality afterward."  
   Aurelia smiled, shaking her head, and looked at Cian.  
   "It might be fairer," he admitted, "to ascertain first whether they
intend to come with him against us."  
   "You don't doubt it," answered Osburn. "Fooling is dangerous."  
   "We might try an embassy to Aesc of West Kent," Aurelia suggested.  
   "An embassy to the wolf's teeth!" growled Osburn. "I know the cut of
them. The two fiends are cousins."  
   Cian considered. "I feel with you," said he. "Yet we may be wrong.
But if we could keep this down to a fight with Essex! We need risk no
man. There is the prisoner."  
   Osburn and Tigernach muttered something with black looks.  
   But when they were again in London and in council, Aurelia sent for
the youth.  
   He came between guards, with a fair show of nimbleness, both in wit
and form. Bright colors in stripes bound his legs from foot to knee. His
tunic  
  
Page 153  
  
--he had lost his mantle--was of scarlet, broidered with tattered gold.
All this gayety of garb had been dimmed by swamp service. His head was
bare and sunny. His right arm hung in a sling.  
   "What is your name?" Aurelia inquired graciously.  
   "Wulfhelm," returned the lad, with a bow.  
   "Wulfhelm, Wulfnoth, Wulfgang, Wulf!" muttered Tigernach
distastefully. "Show me a Saxon name without the wolf in it."  
   "Better wolves than sheep!" retorted the Saxon.  
   Aurelia looked at the woodland chief with offended eyes. Then,
turning to her prisoner, she said gently, "Wolves would have slain
you."  
   "True. I owe my life to the boar's head." He bowed toward Cian.  
   "I will leave you to him," said she, with a smile.  
   Cian had not thought his cognizance known so far, and the allusion
pleased him.  
   "What I need of you is very simple," he said. "Ask the King of West
Kent for me--'Is it peace or war?' If you will do this, you are free."  
   "To join the Sword of Fire?"  
   "What you will."  
   Within the half-hour he was away.  
   "If they kill him for the inquiry, at least it will not be one of our
own people," said Osburn. "Let us make ready to fight--in case the
answer should be \`Peace.'"  
  
Page 154  
  
   While he busied himself in and about the city, Cian was given charge
of all the northern and eastern country to and beyond Caer Collin, where
he made his headquarters. Chariots began to grow plentiful, even to be a
jest. Not a smith nor wagon-maker but was overdriven with work on
them.  
   His late signal triumph answered all murmuring. Truly it had been won
where scythes and wheels could never be of much avail. But there was
plenty of firm open land for them. Osburn had already begun to obstruct
the river with barriers.  
   Wulfhelm was back very speedily, with the answer "Peace," and left
again hurriedly. But there were more disquieting tales through other
channels, and the work of making ready went on. It was too late to do
more.  
   Daily the population of London grew, as the few remaining people of
exposed places flocked in at the urgent call of their queen. For she had
begun to dread lest she had brought ruin on some of her friends by
persistence in untimely scruple.  
   There was a little stir of trade in the shops again, as provisions
came from far corners of the outer country, and mouths which must eat
them. There was a stir of labor also, both in strengthening the defences
and bringing disused homes into some kind of life and service again. The
houses yet intact were mostly  
  
Page 155  
  
crowded. Many tented families occupied in part the belt between these
and the walls; and others lay about near their fires in the open air or
under any rude shelter.  
   The Celtic and pagan element of the cruder sort had been re-enforced
beyond any other. Its manifestations of grotesque faith and fervor were
disquieting. The dread silent watcher of the White Hill--dead but
sleepless--was more than ever a power among men, but the power of a
palsy.  
   The victory in the marsh, that made Oisin's people chant so loudly,
did not turn the tide. It was too plainly the rescue of one who had been
quite safe while within the wall and the promise. How grievous, too,
were the losses that followed her escapade!  
   This current of feeling disturbed Aurelia. Her amplitude ef vision
and contact with many beliefs had not wholly freed her from a fantasy
born in the blood. Sometimes, when weary, she seemed to feel eyes on her
out of that august burial-place; and though such fancies might be
resolutely put by, the legend haunted her memory.  
   "Sylvia," said she, in a lonely hour, after many trying things, "what
am I ever to do with all these people?"  
   "Send for papa!" was the natural child-answer.  
   Aurelia petted her, but did not look exhilarated.  
  
Page 156  
  
   "He is busy elsewhere," she replied. "No, my dear, our papa cannot
come."  
   Sylvia gazed at her with the huge responsibility of tender years
called on for a decision. Presently it came abruptly: "Aurelia, send for
Prince Cian."  
   At that name the queen sister put her involuntarily away; then,
seeing in the little counsellor those lip-quiverings which precede the
tears of pain, Aurelia folded the ringlets very close to her,
exclaiming: "I did not mean to be unkind."  
   "But why?" began the pretty wondering mouth and eyes together,
uptilted from their nest.  
   "Oh, never mind, never mind!" and a soft hand pressed the sunny head
down again. A low laugh followed, with an echo of self-impatience in it.
Presently Aurelia said, with complimentary gravity, "I think so highly
of your advice, my dear, that I am going to do just as you have said.
And that is more than I always do for our wisest old men. Even our good
bishop," she added meditatively.  
   "He isn't a 'good bishop,"' declared the child, with emphasis.  
   "Why do you say so?"  
   "He talks against Prince Cian."  
   "Ah!" Aurelia found herself admitting this in evidence. But she
answered very justly, "They don't agree, you know. And when people don't
agree they misjudge."  
  
Page 157  
  
   "I don't like him," persisted Sylvia. "Besides, he hates our Holy
One, the sacred Head. He hates Vran!"  
   "Why child; what do you know of Him?"--smiling at this echoed
earnestness.  
   "Just what so many people say. What you have told me, sister."  
   "I--oh, I have told you many things. As an old tale, not for certain
truth."  
   Sylvia pondered dubiously. "Anyway," said she, "I think it's very
good of him to keep watch for us. And such a long, long time! Just
think! And only a head to him! It must be very lonesome, Aurelia."  
   "Would you like to see it and talk to it, then?" Aurelia blamed
herself for the question before she had done asking it.  
   Sylvia sprang up and off with a gasp, looking about her and
trembling. "No!" she cried, with a stamp of her foot, half-petulant,
half-terrified.  
   "There, there," said Aurelia soothingly. "I see the most fervent
partisans of the great Vran are even more so at a distance. I must own I
think him rather a frightful defender. But you wouldn't be afraid to
talk with--Prince Cian?"  
   "No," demurely; "I love Cian."  
   "Oh, you do!" said Aurelia. "Why?"  
   "Because he is good--and kind. And he kills the wolves and the
Saxons."  
  
Page 158  
  
   "So does Oisin. Didn't you hear how he made the people knock Eschwine
into the lake?"  
   "Yes," judicially, "I love Oisin too."  
   "What, that little croaking rook of a man!"  
   "Yes, I do."  
   "But he doesn't like Vran."  
   "I don't care," with another glance around. "Don't *you* love
Oisin?"  
   "I like him, and trust him, and prize him."  
   "Don't you love Cian, Aurelia?"  
   "I like him, and trust him, and prize him, too. Sylvia, don't you
love Osburn and Vortimer and the great Emperor?"  
   Sylvia reflected. All items but one were passed by in her slow
answer. "The great Emperor Arthur was like the sun, when he rode in his
armor up the northern road," she said. "I was very glad to look at him.
But he is too far away."  
   This lingered in Aurelia's mind with something, perhaps, of that
comfort which we find in a spokesman raised up for us unexpectedly. Both
of these notably strong and picturesque men had been in her thought and
her fancy, and the child had spoken.  
   Yet, when Cian came hurrying to her presence, he was received only
with an elaborate presentation of affairs. For the moment he would
gladly have been back at Colchester.  
   He took himself to task after the manner of the  
  
Page 159  
  
disconcerted. Beyond question, the queen had good right to send for him
when needed; nor would he loiter by the way if thus summoned again. Ay,
Cian--yet hardly would that coming be with the same stir and thrill of
expectancy, a star-gleam going on before.  
   But soon she passed to matters of more intimate disquiet--those eyes
of fire that verily burned through black night out of the blacker
hillside; the frenzied processions winding upward in the moonlight,
imploring an answer.  
   "Did they really hear anything?" he inquired.  
   "A thunder of words in tongues unknown. The sound came to me even
here. It makes the votaries more assured, more darkling, more
uplifted."  
   Cian looked grave. He could not feel so sure of the redoubtable
obstructive dead, as of wonders which belonged to the common faith of
all elder Britain. Yet, true or false, it was a very disturbing feature
of local lore and pride.  
   "I will see and hear to-night," he answered at last.  
   "Oh!" and she put her hand forward dissuasively; then added, with
quiet self-command, "If it seems best to you."  
   That let the sunshine through. Surely he was, at least, a little more
to her than a mere engine of war and pillar of the state. His look,
going beyond his  
  
Page 160  
  
will, told her of what he saw and felt, and her face warmed again.  
   But before either spoke, word was brought of the presence of the
Saxon whom they had freed.  
   "Let him enter," said Aurelia, surmising urgent tidings; but Cian
fancied a touch of resigned vexation in her tone.  
   When Wulfhelm appeared, the marks of wild unresting haste were
apparent all over his new and brave attire. He had indeed come fast and
far, and sighed with relief, as one who could not hold his course much
longer.  
   "I thought never to be here again," he said. "But since my word was
\`Peace,' your destruction unarmed would weigh on me more than death."  
   Cian took his hand and pressed it. "So they are coming," said he.  
   "From everywhere--the town of the Cantwara, the wet Merscwara
country, the walled isles of the sea, and the valleys of the Darent and
the Medway. Both Kents and all Essex. They will strike at the heart,
hoping to catch you asleep. And that very soon. They look for rain and
mire to clog your wheeling scythe-devils."  
   Cian bowed to the compliment. "So they hope to see my chariots
mud-locked at Colchester?"  
   "That is their hope. I brought word there, found you gone, and
followed."  
  
Page 161  
  
   Cian looked him over. "Will not Eschwine carve the blood eagle on you
for this?"  
   A shiver passed through the young man's frame. He made no answer.  
   "Oh, stay with us! you shall have what you will," cried Aurelia.  
   He glanced at her haughtily, softening to indulgence, but answered
nothing.  
   "We will neither tempt you nor hold you," said Cian. "But Cerdic is
as good a Saxon as Eschwine, with a greater name, and hates him no less
than I."  
   The face of Wulfhelm brightened. "Will you send me to Cerdic?"
inquired he.  
   "Surely. That is over little for all your peril and kindness. My
letter to him may aid you. He knows of Cian Gwenclan. Sooner or later,
with him, you will be made happy in fighting against us. And now I pray
you to await me below, for we must see Osburn."  
   At the door Wulfhelm turned again, and came back with extended
hand.  
   "It is not only for the life that you have given me," said he. "But
you have not asked me to change my soul,--to become a Briton."  
   "A fine compliment!" quoth Cian; but he seized on the hand with kind
eyes.  
   But what he saw in those of Aurelia drove the Frank and the Saxon
together out of his mind.

CHAPTER XVI.  
  
AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DEAD.  
  
"An astrologer then he may be . . .  
He would make the dead alive."

  
BOTH elation and trouble were in Cian's heart as he walked towards the
White Tower between Wulfhelm and Tigernach, the three together nearly
filling the narrow ways. The two enemies by race at first eyed each
other across him with looks of reserve, then kept on, saying little.  
   As they ascended the hill, although not on the haunted side, the face
of the Andred man grew reverent, his very feet moving as if in
deprecating good will; whereas the Saxon glowered and grinned
sardonically at the hostile holy ground, as though very willing to
disbelieve, but hating and fearing. This contrasted witness of the two
men to the intensified power of the legend impressed Cian very deeply.  
   They found Osburn disturbed about the matter, and in no amiable mood.
He bent devouring eyes on the outwardly indifferent Wulfhelm, until Cian
explained how much they owed this young man.  
  
Page 163  
  
Osburn listened gravely, put a question or two, declared himself
satisfied, and forthwith issued orders for an escort of honor befitting
a noted chieftain. "My best way of thanking," he observed. "It may help
you with the King of Wessex."  
   Wulfhelm grew taller in his delight and pride. "This will pair with
Prince Cian's letter," said he--"the best fighter and leader that our
great enemy, Arthur, ever had."  
   There was a deliberation in his praise, evidently intended to enhance
its value. It cost effort.  
   Cian laughed. "Over commending may make a bad ending," quoted he.  
   "It wouldn't do to tell Maelgwn," suggested Osburn, quizzically and
grimly, though kindly.  
   "If my tongue makes an enemy for Prince Cian, my hand can unmake
him," Wulfhelm replied stoutly.  
   "No need to defend one who has commonly been able to defend himself,"
Cian declared. "Yet I thank you; farewell."  
   He turned to Osburn, when the others had gone. "You have made the
lad's fortune, yonder; and I am grateful."  
   "I paid my own score," was the answer. "We're all in one crazy boat.
I've been looking for such news. Now's the last chance to strike, but
with what? Half our people crooning about that death's head of a Vran,
who unluckily isn't where he ought to be."  
  
Page 164  
  
   There was a defiant uplift of the voice in the close of this
denunciation, proving that the denouncer was not wholly fearless and at
ease with regard to the power upbraided. The northern prince felt this,
and therefore disliked the implied blasphemy all the more.  
   "Whatever else may be said of Vran, he is ours," Cian replied
gravely.  
   "And we are likely to be his," retorted Osburn. "Much like an otter
with one paw in a trap, and the hounds coming."  
   Cian smiled again. "Not so bad, I hope," said he. "It is something to
find such terror-breeding power in a dead Briton. But I mean to try
persuasion and argument with him this very night, if you will have me
duly awakened."  
   Osburn stared and laughed oddly at the means suggested; then, on
second thought, looked at him with mingled hope and disquiet. Prince
Cian's repute for occult knowledge hung about him like a magic robe.
Just what might be possible with such a man, it did not become a Frank
soldier of fortune to say. But, after all, what need to shrink from a
comrade who had done so well? If there were other weapons which he could
turn to account, by all means have the good of them.  
   "Bring 'old Vran' to terms in your own way," quoth he.  
  
Page 165  
  
   Late that night Cian was duly awakened. "You may hear them at it
now," said the Frank sombrely.  
   They listened. A hum of voices, low and thrilled, but broken now and
then by some sharp cry, came from the southern face of the hill--a
murmur charged with dread and anxiously imploring worship. "The Saxon
coming is bruited abroad already," said he. Osburn nodded.  
   The two went out together, taking a half-circuit. It was dark
everywhere, yet, as always, a little lighter up the height; so, from the
hollow which they had reached, the mob of swaying, gesticulating forms
might be discerned like living shadows. The voices of them were chanting
an invocation monotonously, all together, except a passionate break or
call now and then.  
   While the two men strained eye and ear, a sudden outleap of light
made Osburn throw up his hands, as though he feared blinding. There was
a gasping cry among the worshippers, and then all were silent in dread
and rapture. For the glare was dual, and came seemingly from within the
hill, as though two great fiery eyes were seen, not quite nakedly, but
through a film which hardly dimmed them.  
   Every human figure had moved aside in fear, and was hidden by the
great contrast.  
  
Page 166  
  
   "There lies our task," said Cian, with resolute effort.  
   Osburn forced himself to look. "I--will--go," said he.  
   "No," answered Cian. "You cannot help here. To say truth, I doubt if
any one can."  
   "'To say truth'--come away!" urged Osburn, with sudden revulsion.
"Anything for duty! But I would rather go at the Saxon army with ten
men."  
   Then he seemed to bethink himself. "After all," said he, "there
should be nothing within one's command which one doesn't know." He
braced himself for the ascent.  
   Cian answered, "If--or rather since--Vran is in your command, how
much greater must you be than the angels of Heaven, or the lords of the
darker place!"  
   Osburn said nothing, and they went upward together. For ten steps or
more the glare was on them, with preterhuman life and will in it, long
smouldering. Then--suddenly as it began--there was darkness. Not the
mere obscurity in which one may discern outlines or shadows, but the
smiting of blindness which follows a lightning flash when clouds are
heavy, and there is neither moon nor star. They stood still, being
helpless. Then they were aware of curses uttered in the black void, and
that the curses were for them. That was never a pleas-  
  
Page 167  
  
ant sound to any man, least of all when a very little fancy-play might
make the unfriendly sounds unearthly also.  
   "I gather that they charge us with bringing them into disfavor," said
Cian.  
   By this time they could dimly see a medley of figures, the nearest
almost touching them, all swayed by some eager feeling. The voices had
changed again, and were swaying, too, in a low singsong of adjuration.  
   Again, as in response, came the dual outglaring, so that every one
before it stood vivid in vision,--marshmen, hill-folk, city rabble,
villagers, even a few soldiers, nearly all the forms, it seemed, of
London life within or without the city. Into the heart of the light
Osburn could not look; and he felt, rather than saw, that it had two
radiant points as before. Sounds came out of it also, addressing Cian,
as it seemed to the Frank, in a tongue unknown; but he could only turn
his eyes a little aside, and note what he might between darkness and
dazzle.  
   For Cian, that light soon softened into friendliness. He was aware of
no cleft in the hillside through which it could come; but he seemed to
follow it to a subterranean chamber, with walls like those he had known
at the winning of the golden corselet; glassy as by fusion, dense and
ponderous, yet illumined, by a dreamy light. He was dreamily  
  
Page 168  
  
aware also of a presence within it, but the form and aspect he could not
certainly perceive.  
   The voice which Osburn heard, and many more as well, came thence to
him with meaning; for he well knew that ancient speech of the island,
which was now forgotten by all save adepts among the priesthood and
wonder-workers. The popular fancy ascribed it unto the squat
necromancers of the north who dwelt in hollow terraced hills before ever
the Druids came, and who were Celtic in nothing except as being the
topic of Celtic song and tale.  
   "He who cometh," it said, "bringeth my own."  
   It was a mellow sound, though so deep and resonant. Cian understood
the allusion to the golden mystery that he wore. After a pause, the
voice resumed.  
   "What he hath won he shall wear, and not yet hath ended the winning.
Yet the victory lies not in wheels, nor shod hoofs, nor winged blades,
nor the fleetness of men and beasts, nor in any manner of onset. The
great waves shatter on the rock while it abides their coming. If it roll
to meet them, it shall be lost in the depth of the sea. I, Vran, am the
life of London. He who would go forth to battle, leaving his life
behind, must needs take death in its stead."  
   Cian was awed and shaken; yet he felt that he must make answer and
inquiry. He spoke with  
  
Page 169  
  
reverence. "As one who has been admitted to the light, and has wrestled
in the darkness, I would ask why it is your august will to lay a palsy
on us."  
   There was no reply. The light shone on. The crowd listened,
recognizing no word.  
   He inquired again: "Is it the part of men to nestle under the
hovering wing while the Saxon hawk is sweeping the field?"  
   There was stillness again, and he fancied an angry wavering. Those
about him shared the fancy; for there were murmurs, blaming presumption.
But he hardened himself and raised his voice. "London is without the
walls no less than within. What aid had I of Vran when the queen was
threatened in the marshes by the Lea? Withdraw, then, your prohibition,
I adjure you! Let the life of London willingly go forth with its
strength."  
   At this there was an indescribable stir of light and sound within the
crypt. The voice thundered forth amid many echoes. "Woe unto him who
heeds not the words I have spoken! Woe unto him who idly breaks my holy
peace and vigil!"  
   Then, as by the shutting of a lid, all was blackness and silence.  
   There breathed a great sigh among the people, as knowing that the
awful communion was ended. A few struck lights, after a brief time, and
began to talk, though suppressedly, as they moved away.  
  
Page 170  
  
   Cian knew that their attention was on him, but with little
hostility.  
   "Hardihood wins favor," said Osburn. "The more they think, the
stronger you will be with them." He held himself erect and weightily
while thus moralizing; but, when they were well around the curve of the
hill, he drew a long breath and moved faster. "Better a terrible friend
than a terrible enemy,"he said bravely; yet his eyes went back over his
shoulder.  
   "What do you call this Vran?" he demanded a little later, pausing
squarely; "Ghost? God? Devil?"  
   "Pray ask me an easier question,"responded Cian. "A highly patriotic
and mysterious Londoner, with a sense of what is due to himself--so
much, at least, one may say. What he was, you partly know, and there is
not any man who knows wholly. What he is--may be a mere trick of
priestcraft and false voices."  
   For there was a soreness in Cian over that abrupt ending.  
   Osburn looked at him, and shook his head. "A hard saying that for a
brother wonder-worker!" he observed very dryly.  
   "You do me wrong,"answered Cian, with smiling dignity. "If I have
concerned myself about hidden things, it was not for deceiving."  
  
Page 171  
  
   Yet each remained in doubt, with little faith as to the explanation
by trickery. Osburn was half-minded to move his headquarters. But there
was a sense of shame in flight, even from the unearthly. And by the
haunter's own averment, it was a place of peculiar safety.  
   Cian slept little, what he had seen and heard lingering on in his
mind. Moreover, there was the dread that, on next issuing from the
walls, he would be at the head of ghost-seeing men foredoomed by their
fears to disaster.  
   When the queen heard the tale the next morning, it was with no great
heightening of concern, that being near its highest already. At heart
she would have been better pleased than the men with extra human aid;
but its limitation stirred her more angrily. What, desertion as the
price of protection? Defensive magic bounded by a petty ring! Cruel
selfishness made holy! Shameless and shocking niggardliness of the
mighty dead! Her own words made her tremulous; but she was set on
befriending the weak in their peril at any risk, and on doing her full
duty, although every power of the unknown should thunder against it.

CHAPTER XVII.  
  
THE FIRST SERVICE OF THE CHARIOTS.  
  
The wonderful rush of the gale,              
The pervasion of fire, the war of youth.  
                            --CUHELN.

  
NOT so much for the oracles of the dead as for the tidings of Wulfhelm,
such communities as were still outlying were warned and summoned yet
again. Colchester, confident in its strength and the weakness of the
enemy before it, sent no fugitives, but even aid. Oisin, for the
lake-village, responded with a blast of denunciation directed against
all truckling to the heathen and the devil. But there were few other
exceptions, and in particular every soul southward of the Thames came
pouring in with absolute assurance of the enemy close behind.  
   As always, these first tales brought the danger nearer than the fact;
and there was little certainty of any kind until Tigernach, with a party
of horsemen, scouted out to a hill overlooking a good reach of the
road.  
   Here he came suddenly on a mounted party of  
  
Page 173  
  
Jutes or Kent-folk, well-blown with the speed of their advance, and sent
them back hurriedly, for that was not the arm in which the Saxon
excelled. Behind were many footmen, the main body of the army, so the
pursuit went no further. The glance that he gave in turning showed
Tigernach the three Saxon kings riding together near the van, Eschwine
between the others.  
   He bore the news homeward. Before his party had crossed London
bridge, there was a great uprolling of smoke and flame from more than
one spot behind. Voids cried, "The Sword of Fire! the Sword of
Fire!"with quick recognition.  
   A great overspreading and sagging of clouds coming up from the sea
threatened these Saxon bonfires with a speedy end. "Something from
heaven for our side," said Osburn. "To clog our wheels with mire,"
grumbled Cian. "We must make a push while we can."  
   Acting on this thought, he set his chariot-procession in motion. Many
horsemen and footmen followed, the legionaries and some Christian bodies
of the town men pushing forward with alacrity; while the greater mass,
who adored Vran or feared him, required all Aurelia's urging. The most
utterly prophecy-ridden were left at the last in the outer defences,
being more likely to spread panic than to fight.  
   Cian found his enemy in the open country south-  
  
Page 174  
  
ward beyond the marshes and the first low hills,--a great spear-point of
men, with another close behind. Eschwine strode in the tip of the
former; in the space before the latter rode the young king of West
Kent.  
   Cian threw out his few archers in front, with orders to aim at
Eschwine only; then spread his chariots in a very open line, so there
should be no entangling in the rush. Osburn and Tigernach led the
cavalry, next behind, fairly numerous and good. Last of all the
infantry, to cover the archers when these should be driven in or
withdraw, and at all times to afford a bristling nucleus. At the best
the array was pitiably meagre in comparison, excepting those wheeled
engines of uncertain prowess.  
   The first drops of rain were beginning to fall, as these came rolling
forward. The archers, well ahead, kept the game to themselves for a
time, excepting trivial responses from scattered Saxon bowmen. But when
the especial intent became obvious, and Eschwine was nearly smitten off
his feet by half a dozen arrows that reached him all together, a
wrathful outcry arose, and men broke from the wedge to get at his
assailants. Before these were back again, the chariots raced in among
them, each with its chosen fighting man and with its armed charioteer on
the shaft. Perhaps a third of them bore also revolving scythe-blades on
their axles. As they rushed  
  
Page 175  
  
through, mowing and tearing, the horsemen swept around on either side,
and dashed against the broader part of the wedge.  
   Nothing stood before it, not Eschwine, who was all but ridden down by
Cian himself, and swept, exchanging blows as best he could, back to the
post of his Kentish ally. Not that potentate either; for the very next
chariot on the right sheared at one plunge both the legs from his
screaming horse, and it and he rolled together. Not the Saxons of either
front in either wedge, for the mounted spear-man of that day was the
better soldier, and what was not done by the thrust, or the push of the
excited beast, the downward sweep of metal was sure to make good. Thus
line dragged into line, then broke in fragments, while the battle-axes
took them keenly, and the two charging bodies of horsemen met in the
midst.  
   Then was there mere confusion of fighting, where the darting Britons
drove at any Saxon cluster which might be found, and the Saxons made
head as they could defy them, for few would leave the spot. Meanwhile
the British footmen came up, and a far greater number of the Saxons.  
   Obstinately the heathen clung, like winter fruit, to pole or rein or
wheel, avoiding as best they could those ghastly mowers of steel, or
clambering up on the chariot from behind. Withal they were so very
numerous and determined that it was often hard  
  
Page 176  
  
to make any headway; and here and there a vehicle was overturned with
slaughter of the inmates. Although Cian and Tigernach disengaged a few
horsemen and chariots to beat back or cut up reenforcements, the great
bulk of these last very quickly took part in the battle.  
   There was now only a great mass of Saxon footmen, thinner in places
and thicker in places, through which the chariots were cutting lanes;
while into the borders horsemen and footmen were pecking with desultory
assaults. But the soil was not over firm, and every rush of the wheels
tore it, under the incessant and thickening rainfall, while the hoofs
and wrestling feet aided in churning it into mire.  
   A little more, and that power on which Cian most relied would be
quite helpless. At the first outlet, he sought the open ground with such
as he could signal, and then, in swift rushes, freed others where best
he could; and the remainder, catching his thought, everywhere essayed
the same. So, very briefly, there were again two hostile armaments, each
arrayed disorderly, but one vastly the greater, with a narrow interval
between.  
   Then came a great Saxon onset, heavier at the right, where Eschwine
led. Osburn struck across his path, with quick interchange of blows,
whereby each was slightly wounded, until the wave of men bore the Frank
aside, and the Sword of Fire well  
  
Page 177  
  
into the mass of his enemies. But the chariots, even where they could
not move freely, at least served as barriers, and a group of three or
four that were anchored most firmly checked him like a rock. The British
footmen clambered upon them, and smote down, or thrust spears through
the wheels and between them, and under the horses' necks and bodies; and
there was a very bedlam of struggling and screaming.  
   Meantime Cian had wheeled about with two or three dozen of his
war-vehicles where the ground was firmer, and came plunging in a
half-circle to take the Saxons crosswise--the horses gasping and wild
with effort, the wheels going deeper and deeper, now and then coming up
with great leaps that nearly unsettled charioteer and rider together, or
bounding aslant, in clashing over fallen men, who lay singly or in
locking couples, and could not shun them. It was the clumsiest and most
preposterous of counter-charges, but it served.  
   At the same time, those who were a-saddle, minding less the mire,
struck in where they could, or galloped along the border of the Saxons,
lancing them. So, after a time, the flood was surely ebbing; and
Eschwine, finding himself altogether cut off, doggedly fought his way
out and back, and was glad enough to be with his men again.  
   "The work of the chariots is done for this day,"  
  
Page 178  
  
said Cian bitterly. "We must not leave them here." It was a hard thought
that they might have won him a victory, but for the falling deluge and
the softening ground.  
   So, before the enemy had yet gathered themselves to try another
assault, he set his footmen to freeing the sunken wheels, and led his
mounted lances and battle-axes in a spirited dash at Eschwine, to cover
the work.  
   That astute Saxon was not at all deluded, yet had no choice but to
meet it. Indeed, Cian's weapon, quivering as it struck his sword-blade
aside, very nearly transfixed him. But at that moment Cian reeled, the
spear-point veered, the shaft rattled on the ground. An arrow, shot out
of the mass of men before him, had seemingly struck him full in the
breast over the sprig of misletoe, an inviting mark. Yet, as he came
upright again, and turned, now sword in hand, all of either army who
were near could well see that no part of the thin gold or silver had
sufered any scath, and a great cry of magic went up about them.  
   Eschwine himself, though he doubted, was no longer wholly in love
with the encounter. Partly for this, and partly for Cian's greater
skill, it fared badly with the great Saxon, so that he took a sharp gash
in the hand, and another in the cheek; and when he leaped up to grapple,
the point met him  
  

  
"He Led His Mounted Lances and Battle-Axes, in a Spirited Dash at
Eschwine."

  
Page 179  
  
half-way, cutting through the flesh of his left side. The hilt sounded
against his ribs, driving him staggering earthward.  
   Then there was a rally of Saxons over him, and a wrangle of the old
Greek and Roman fashion; and at the last Cian broke away with his men to
rejoin the chariots, already moving cityward. The golden mail and the
mistletoe spray were bright as ever. He had left nothing but his lance
behind.  
   But the Saxons began to feel themselves victors, with the well-won
prey escaping them, and ran breathlessly in pursuit. There were times
when depth of soil gave them advantage; but in the main, traversing
firmer ground, the superiority of four feet over two showed itself. If
the Saxons broke ranks in over eagerness, Cian or Tigernach or Osburn,
with a cohort, was back at a gallop among them directly. When the whole
mass made a vehement push together, it was hampered on every side by
light smiting charges that clung a moment, and came again, frittering
away all impetus. At last, when a bit of gravelly upland was reached,
within sight of the walls, and the rain ceased for a spell, Cian wheeled
his chariots about, and struck back with them very surprisingly. The sun
shone out on the moving steel with manifold glinting.  
   Before the forward running Saxons the British footmen had broken
partly away, the horsemen also  
  
Page 180  
  
slanting off divergently. Through the gap hurried the gayly-clad stream
of warlike men, the young king of West Kent at their head. Then wheels
and scythes and horses and fighting men dashed at them in counter-charge
all together, with a rumble and a crash; and, while they smote, the
horsemen and footmen on either side smote also. There was very wild and
reckless turmoil for a while of the blinded among the blinded, in the
midst of which that long-tapering tongue of the Saxon army was torn and
shredded, and so whirled back to the lower and softer ground.  
   Before they recovered, Cian was well on his way to the city. But one
hope had failed him.

ARTHUR the Emperor and his army, bound northward, made good progress,
for all their many appurtenances; having under them an excellent Roman
road, beaded with rich and helpful cities. Some of these contributed men
also; but there was one at least which levied a draft on those gathered
already. Yet, after tasting the good things of Verulam, and witnessing
how much of the white glory of Rome was yet kept alive in the moonlit
beauty of her shrines and porticos, and above all her great
amphitheatre, it was not easy to remind her friendly people that they
might as wisely have had care for stout walls and a better armament of
their own, to keep these fair things in being all the longer.  
   Nor would it have served any purpose. Hither the wealth of Londinium,
when once out of trade, had drifted for centuries; and though there had
been a  
  
Page 182  
  
passing thrill of zeal and persecution, leaving still its memorials in a
very few Christians of the Oisin type, the Rome which dreamed on in
Verulam was mainly the nerveless and pleasure-loving Rome of the days
before her fall.  
   Guinevere was infatuate with these people, their easy, laughing
philosophy, and the indescribable loveliness of all things around. Even
after departing northward, on the second day she declared herself
aweary, and that she must needs return. A force went back with her for
better protection, although the Emperor had been constrained to leave a
garrison already.  
   "Verulam gives us not much in return," said he, "beside the memory of
pleasant hours." He looked at her with kindly, wistful eyes, as though
he would willingly have heard the wish recanted. She, giving look for
look, warming and melting, made answer. "You know--how well you
know!--that I shall follow when I am restored but ever so little. Must a
woman be an iron campaigner, or there is no love for her?--not any, not
any!"  
   For they had been betrothed since before leaving London. With the
words repeated, she offered her lips bewitchingly. He kissed them,
laughing, and yet again in his delight. "I would not have you an iron
campaigner, Guinevere!" he answered; "it might be painful."  
  
Page 183  
  
   "How could I know?" she replied demurely. "Half the time you spend
with Prince Llywarch or my uncle or your Lancelot, weaving plans, till I
feel like a poor tangled fly, with you three grim spiders watching."  
   He laughed again. "Have you the heart, then, to call Llywarch 'grim,'
and the daintily stately Maelgwn? Surely I shall tell them. Above all,
since one of them must go with you."  
   She did not show the covert contemning smile that was in her. "You
scarce can spare Llywarch's counsel," said she. "And he is anxious
incessantly for Argoed. Maelgwn and I have long known each other, boy
and girl; and for that little time I can abide his pretty graces."  
   This, to startle out any disguises of his, that she might see it. One
reluctant word from him would have left Maelgwn to Arthur and the army.
She had no mind to risk empire in any degree; although--that being
safe--there was nothing to hamper her fancy and sportiveness, come of
them what might.  
   But Arthur made no sign, being too trustful and too sure of his
supremacy in all things, the grace and the foible which together slew
him. "Let it be Maelgwn, then," said he; and embraced her lovingly for
farewell. But when her face was safely turned away, her smile did not
resemble his, having a merry derision in it, not hostile, but
foresightful and aware.  
  
Page 184  
  
   When Caradoc, her uncle, heard of this return, his brow grew stormy,
and he sought her. There was long speech between them that wearied her,
but she met him steadily with the uncomprehending openness of a child.
"Why not Verulam, then? And why not Maelgwn, her own old playfellow,
whom he had first invited?" And Caradoc, the rough and ready, though
beginning doughtily, soon found himself at a loss how to speak and not
to make more mischief.  
   Guinevere, to whom nothing could well have been suggested and found
new, easily read him, and wondered at the dulness of men who read not
her at all. Yet she knew that the veil over his vision was not so dense
as that upon the Emperor's, the love being less in degree and in nature
different. So she deemed best that their talk should end without more
risk of disclosure.  
   Therefore her under lip quivered, and quivered again; and there were
grief and pride in her face as she stiffened herself, sitting upright.  
   "Since every coming and going of mine is to bear comment," she said,
then broke off, adding, after a minute, "will even the Empress--when she
*is* Empress--be spared Prince Caradoc's censure?"  
   Her tone stung him; and he went out forthwith, holding his breath,
lest he should say more. Yet soon he laughed aloud in the surprise of
finding so much loftiness where other traits had been. "Our  
  
Page 185  
  
kitten will bear rule overwhelmingly," he cried. "Ay, but what man's
ruling?"  
   Meanwhile the "kitten" laughed also, rolling about, after her kind,
the silken ball wherewith she had been embroidering. But, however she
might seem to the nearly gigantic Caradoc, there was nothing minimized
nor pettily outlined about the charms of Guinevere. As little, also, of
over amplitude. If kitten at all, the word must have belonged to some
greater and more perilous exemplar of the feline tribe.  
   As always, she had her will; and Maelgwn rode back with her,
flattered, tempted, anticipating, yet uncertainly at ease, finding her
the very perfection of uncomprehending, incomprehensible decorum. At
him, too, though in her heart she liked him best, Guinevere was covertly
smiling. In Verulam there were labyrinths, or what might pass for such,
with many things to see.  
   In these, wholly by his contrivance as he thought, this Lancelot,
before three days went by, was for many minutes lost with her and
wandering. They paused in a shadowy corner, half below the ground, lit
faintly by a narrow stream of yellow motes, which came through some
cranny above them. Little else could he see, except bright living eyes
fixed on his own, as if they would speak to him thrillingly. With no
word or movement of hers--the provocation yet came upon him so
strongly--he took Guinevere,  
  
Page 186  
  
all of a sudden, and kissed her face over and over; until--rallying but
a little before searchers came--she made him, by word and gesture, set
her free, and stood quivering, palpably insulted.  
   Yet not so that others should see in that dimness. Nor, as they
passed out through it, was her cold silence toward him observable, all
being full of query and narration as to the losing of their way. In the
sunlit outer air she was quite her daily self again; and he wondered at
her containment, which allowed not so much as an angry flush or a
meaning glance to appear. Yet he knew well that, whether for punishment
or reward, the matter would not thus end between them, and that the
memory would dwell through life with him, over stirringly, of those few
moments in the mazes of Verulam.  
   As soon as might be he sought--and found with no great
effort--opportunity to make his mercy-beseeching plea. She heard him at
first severely and with extreme offence, made obvious; but his passion
was permitted to move her, above all by memory-awakening allusions to
early days. She must grant, judicially, that he had fared ill with her,
and that the fault was not all his own. She hinted of her uncle's
pressure, and grave reasons of state and duty, and paused on the very
verge of remorsefully hinting her feminine love of brilliancy, and the
tempting attributes that begirt the station of the Emperor.  
  
Page 187  
  
   The regret that she would not precisely utter he yet found in her
half-sigh, when she announced, with positiveness of words--and almost of
tone and mien--that her lot was now settled beyond all rightful
disturbance. She displayed to him didactically and with elaboration how
very censurable and distressful such disturbance would be; for though
their earlier experience might this once excuse--as but brotherly--such
tokens of kindly feeling, these were easily to be misunderstood by the
world and by one above them.  
   Moreover, if there were to be continuance thereof during her high
betrothal, how could she trust him to leave her in perfect serenity even
when uplifted to the Emperor's side? wherein might be a gulf of ruinous
disaster beyond all foreseeing! True words, as the event proved very
sadly, but with suggestion in them.  
   When he had gone away, contrite externally, she bethought herself in
idleness how long it would be ere such dangerous dallying would come to
pass again. She had no regret so far, since nothing was as yet seen or
known; and Maelgwn, the daring, fervent, beautiful, and forbidden--was
he not tempting also? Yet wisdom might hold with abstinence until all
was safe. There were moods when, regarding what she had in the balance,
she wished him well away.  
  
Page 188  
  
   Oddly, before long he felt likewise; although his heart had exulted
as he left that adorable presence, and the half-admissions extorted
seemingly from the grip of will and duty. Defiance ruled him too, of
himself and of all others. A power bore him along unresisting, with only
some dim inner question as to what should follow. Yet in a little time
that questioning grew; and one word which he had heard used of them in
the labyrinth abode with him still--the word "lost."  
   How many other losses there were, and worse--of fidelity and honor
and manhood and all that was princely! The soul, most of all her soul,
counted for something likewise; and so did the words that she had said
as to dark days in store for all the land. Now and again such thoughts
leaped out upon him as real things, and he shivered in the saddle under
the bright sun. He had never more than a faint hope of resistance, of
holding aloof. A grasp was on him, at once loved and hated, until it
seemed that interposition of any sort would be welcome. Yet he resented
the word of command when it came, though it was almost a summons to
battle.  
   This was from Arthur, most kindly, with no mention of the watchful
prompter Caradoc. At the second reading, the wholesomeness of a
soldier's effort came home to Maelgwn; with awakening self-scorn for
lingering softly and warmly about a woman soft  
  
Page 189  
  
and warm--and untrue. At the third, he was all abashed by the greater
strength and manhood of his imperial leader, too great and kind to
mistrust on the very brink of treachery.  
   In the quick revulsion of his wayward soul, he was all passionate
devotion to that injured comrade-king, all remorse and bitter eagerness
to repair the wrong by fierce service and hot blood. Yet, courteously,
he went first to Guinevere with tidings and farewells.  
   She read them before he spoke, and forthwith perversely wished that
he should stay. Also she was pleased to keep him in the wrong, with no
mitigation, but rather exacerbation, of shame. Her resolute austerity of
aspect, so foreign to her texture and outlines, and broken by quick
waves of feeling that seemed to be beyond all government, was a nearly
intolerable thing. At the last he broke away blindly, not knowing what
would befall if he were to look and listen longer.  
   When he had gone she was first angered and astounded; then mirthful,
with some touch of scorn; but after a little not ill pleased that the
risk of unwary demeanor was in any way removed from her. Yet Verulam
soon grew a weariness; and the game in which she had so great a stake
called her northward by easy stages to that bright border city where she
knew the imperial encampment to be.

Is a pure life unto the day of judgment.                
                          --TYSSILIS.

  
MAELGWN had been called to withstand those North-folk and South-folk who
were pressing through the fens and up along the streams to the assault
of Caer Lerion. They menaced also the cities of the Cam, and that great
Ermine road which was the main artery of Arthur's northern army.  
   All along it, where the risk was great, troops had been left in
clusters and nuclei; but these needed leadership. Meanwhile the enemy,
though in scattered bands, grew daily thicker and more fierce, with
concerted movement seemingly in aid of the vaster gathering under Ossa
Cyllalaur.  
   He felt the opportunity tinglingly, being quite in the mood for
smiting out self-chastisement on some one else. All the better that this
some one should be Saxon! His overflowing zeal and vigor reanimated all
his following, who so maltreated their many scrambling assailants, by
ambuscade, open rout,  
  
Page 191  
  
relentless chasing down, and whirlwind-like surprise in their own
strongholds, that he was soon able to promise the Emperor immunity from
further trouble.  
   It was too brief and confused an experience to be called a campaign;
a mere chance-medley in detail, fought out by detached parties in a
dozen places at once, but withal co-acting rationally to one end.
Arthur's best lieutenant began to feel in some measure rehabilitated in
his own eyes.  
   Arthur, too, was relieved; for he needed all watchfulness toward the
front. Elsewhere everything went well. His appointment of Constantine,
at once a pleasure and a tactful compromise expedient, had amply
justified itself. Many threads of management were weaving through the
fingers of the merchant who had been king so nearly. Never had Legiolum
been more adequately provided, even in Roman times, with all that could
comfort man, or make him formidable. Recruits came also with his
provision trains from distant valleys. With the spreading of the news,
there were adventurers riding in daily to volunteer.  
   The brightness of the city was a magnet. The reckless, mirth-loving
temper of a frontier garrison was enriched by the still remaining
beauties of an elder time wherein lay its pride, and by the influence of
that imperial court which blended Celtic picturesqueness with the
lingering majesty of Rome.  
  
Page 192  
  
What more had earth to offer? Men rode into Legiolum to the tossing of
light words and lances, high-hearted with the mead-cup and the zeal to
display, eager for the beauty and the thrill awaiting them, and for
battle in that realm of wild emprise and mystery that lay beyond.  
   Arthur, knowing deeply his people and in full sympathy with all that
lent glamour to their life, wisely gave rein to their romance, enlarging
it in every way. Week in and out, there was jousting, with the clash of
keen weapons on armor. The Emperor himself often came to look on,
thoughtful; also the sunbright Guinevere; the presence of either lifting
strife into frenzy.  
   Only in such things could she comprehend and aid him, but there she
was a power. Not queen of the revels only, but queen of all revelry.
Furious it grew at times, yet never beyond her pace; and frivolous, yet
never too light for her footing.  
   There were some who shook their heads over this, but their
uncertainties could not live on before her gracious tongue and eye.
Mindful of what presence was near, and admonished by the near past of
Verulam to be wary, Guinevere was a masterpiece now of giddiness
adroitly shown to be in keeping with wise policy, of exuberant
kindliness that never became unqueenly, of extravagance in genial
merriment, wholly delightful.  
  
Page 193  
  
   Yet at times what was most earnest in Arthur went back to a nobler
queenliness beside the Thames, or forward to matters of hope and faith
in which his sunbeam-goddess could have no share, or out toward his
redoubtable enemy of Caer Ebrauc, with real longing for a trial of skill
in something more manly than cajolement. He could only promise, in
self-assurance, to be strong for both; and protest that she was the very
bloom and sparkle of life to him, which he must not altogether forego.  
   Yet in duty he must watch London and that stately maid whom his word
had lifted into danger. It was a task made easy by the solicitude of
Constantine. At first all went well. Disquieting rumors followed, which
yet might be set aside. Then, suddenly as a cloud-burst, there fell on
them all the tale of Eschwine's treachery, Aurelia's danger at the
lake-village, the swift sequence of punishment and rescue, and the
Saxon's flight to kinfolk beyond the river, with all that it presaged.  
   Arthur sprang to his feet, and smote out his anathema. Constantine
waited before him, watchful, reticent, and bitter; for he loved his
daughter, and harbored unacknowledged hope. Now what dreadful things had
nearly befallen her, while a lesser woman filled his Emperor's heart and
eyes?  
   "It was Prince Cian who saved her," he said.  
   "God bless him!" cried Arthur. "He never de-  
  
Page 194  
  
served better of me; and that is saying much undoubtedly. As to
Eschwine, let him wait. Other Saxons claim me now. Yet if there were a
myriad, I would get at him yet for this,--and with the hand of death.
Meanwhile, pray urge on her to keep within the walls."  
   "Prince Cian has already done so."  
   Arthur moved uneasily, but answered, "His are very safe hands. Worthy
of any reward."  
   After that, little came to them beside matters of preparation, until
the sudden march of the Saxon kings on London, and their struggle with
the chariots in the mire. Then Constantine and Vortimer, this once
together, were for detaching a strong corps to relieve the city. All the
northern men protested as strongly, Guinevere siding with her gay
companions. Arthur stood in the strain of counsel, wavering beyond his
wont, until fate spoke the final word for him by the mouth of
Llywarch.

CHAPTER XX.  
  
IN THE VALES OF ARGOED.  
  
The men of Argoed have ever supported me.  
                          --LLYWARCH.

  
THE absorption of the Prince of Argoed in his little realm had grown on
him daily, as he went northward from London with Arthur's army. In his
genial way he was a man of duty, nor could anything warm or brighten him
more than his people's love. On the very eve of the entry into Legiolum
he sought and obtained the Emperor's assent to be gone.  
   "For surely," said Arthur, "no truer man ever went anywhere. Take
Dynan, if you will, for company, and bring me word of whatever you may
find that will be any aid."  
   In the spirit of their time, that friendly pair, all alone, rode
straight out into the outlaw-haunted and homeless land which lay next
beyond them on the northwest, as though adventures were the especial
gifts of heaven. Their voices went ringing in song through the hollow
woodlands and the morning frost, or echoed among great rocks at the
close of the short, still day.  
  
Page 196  
  
   Beside the night-fire on the hill-top they matched well in
minstrelsy; although Llywarch touched the harp to his own lays, Dynan,
as he said, to those of many others. But they were every way strange to
his companion, and some had an elfin revelry to make one stare.
Questioning drew only a laughing answer. Whatever the truth might be,
such melody suited well the slender lance of fortune, his nimble wayward
wit, his flitting unexpectedness, his unvanquishable gayety. Surely he
might well be half akin to the wild wee people of the hollowed hills,
driven from the sunlight to the moonlight, yet whirling their dances and
pealing their elfish laughter in the face of an iron fate.  
   One day these twain came suddenly upon three hostile men, who would
have been called felon-knights in later days; very dirty, stout
vagabonds, in armor which was green with verdigris, who lived mainly by
robbing lone houses, and picking up what they might between town and
town. They showed fight, being the stronger party as it seemed, and also
hungry, but did little damage except to the harp-strings which were
hanging from Llywarch's saddle-bow. After that there was voice-music
only, but it answered; and this was their only adventure on the way to
Argoed.  
   It was a bright morning when they entered the head of one of its
lesser branching valleys. From a  
  
Page 197  
  
spring at their feet a rill went downward to a slender waterfall, and a
woodman's cabin, where children already were looking up from their play,
ready to run or cry. Other such homes were visible every way among bare
hillside boughs, or in dimpling hollows and glades. There was nothing
squalid about them as far as could be seen. The unseasonable mildness of
the melting air made the crude scene gracious after the desert they had
left. Dynan uttered a low exclamation of pleasure.  
   "Yes," said Llywarch, "there has ever been warmth in Argoed." He
stooped, and tossed the water with his hand so that the drops fell in a
shower. "How bright they are!" he said, "as, indeed, they ought to be.
They go to make the Vale Royal. The least of them is on its way to the
unconquered fortress-queen beside the Dee. Come, come!"  
   He strode down the hillside, leading his horse. No boy returning home
after weary exile was ever more blithe of heart.  
   But this proved too much for the wavering covey below. They hurried
into hiding with much outcry of terror.  
   He called after them, in a mellow voice of reassurance, "It is only
Llywarch! Your good friend, Prince Llywarch! I shall not hurt you."  
   But evidently the name had no great nor sure  
  
Page 198  
  
meaning to them after his long absence. Not so with their mother,
peering anxiously from the doorway. She stepped forth at once, calling
it abroad as joyful tidings, for the ears of her husband and son at work
not far away; then advanced to meet them, with a pleased, if ungraceful,
welcome. Yet, almost before she spoke, "Llywarch, Llywarch!" resounded
from every side, and hurrying figures were breaking the brittle
undergrowth.  
   "This is a better reception than any monarch could give you!"
exclaimed Dynan, doubling the delight of his friend.  
   "We are of one mind on that," answered Llywarch; and in a moment he
was among the throng of them, with heart-greetings and eager inquiries.
But presently the two must mount again and hurry on.  
   As they rode, the valley wound about, and joined with others and
widened, until they could see where it ended, as did many like it from
every quarter, in a sunken, hill-rimmed space like a bowl. Neat hamlets
enlivened many parts of it, with signs of thrift multiplying all about
them. A walled circle near the outlet showed where Rome had left her
mark through early imperfect imitations. Near the centre of the bowl, in
the sunset, over the level land, his little capital, Loidis, lay
smiling.  
   "I don't see that you were distressfully needed here, after all,"
said Dynan, looking about him.  
  
Page 199  
  
   "With such stewardship, a man might safely go anywhere and stay
forever."  
   "I must tell them that," answered Llywarch; "here come the
stewardesses."  
   "Those ladies?" for a party of distinction, at a distance, were
riding towards them.  
   "My mother and my sister--Freur by name," explained Llywarch, bowing
sedately; though, of course, it was well known already to his friend.  
   In a few moments these were with them; the elder lady of a gracious
comeliness, and showing all the vigor of that long-lived race; the
daughter brightening out of habitual thoughtfulness, which yet had a
gentle and sympathetic charm. She was darker than her brother and
slighter, with all allowance for the difference of sex, yet indefinitely
like him notwithstanding.  
   Dynan rightly felt sure that these were very good people, not proud
beyond what is well for mortals, but above all meanness, and alive to
every call of love and duty. They gave him a very frank and ample
welcome to Argoed.  
   Freur rode back with him, chatting of many things,--her pretty
toy-world so much more perfect in itself than she knew!--the outer
wonders which had come to her only in reflected vision or echo, but of
which none could know better than he.  
   Then Dynan told her the glory of camp and court  
  
Page 200  
  
and lovely dream-like cities; the shattering of arms on armor in mimic
battle; the riding two by two, day by day, on high and mysterious quest
over bleak waste-land or through goblin forestry; the putting forth of
ships adventurously westward, where any monstrous form or scene divine
might yet be hidden; the century-long combat with the ever-raging
sea-heathen, wherein spears were bowed like the bowing of thicketry, and
came on with the rush of the wind. All this was an awakening to her
indeed.  
   Llywarch heard, with less enthusiasm, from his mother those secrets
of statecraft which even princedom in a glove-box could not wholly
dispense with. Here the village leader to be conciliated, there the
trusty subject who had deserved every rewarding, and again the spirit of
mischief that stood cryingly in need to be repressed. There was no
disparaging smile on the face of the court-minstrel and widely ranging
soldier. He well knew how real and great his mother found these things,
and what witness to her methods there was around him.  
   A few happy days followed, in and around Loidis. Llywarch brought the
flutter of new life into the little state. Here and there men were sown
over it who had fought for him and Arthur long ago; or households that
missed a member now in camp under the walls of Legiolum, or, it may be,
garrisoning the far southwest. He was the pride and hero of  
  
Page 201  
  
the land unto all; its future "shelter in battle" should danger turn
aside, as well might happen, into the quiet dells of Argoed.  
   The eyes of Dynan also found enough to fill them. Loidis was
charming, though less charming than Freur. Here he came upon no great
ruinous villa, no disused military station half made over to suit later
needs. Roman civilization had been felt only as a humanizing thrill, a
delicate tint and flavor. The best of this lived on, with much that was
delightful beside.  
   There was no noisome quarter, no street where Freur could not
accompany him with pleasure. The houses were often very attractive in
coloring and design, the streets broad and well-shaded. Down the stream
which flowed through it, lazy flat-boats often floated, laden with
fleeces and orchard produce for the queen-city of the Dee.  
   But soon all this must be left behind for an inspection of Cian's
patrimony, where already the Saxons were troubling.

CHAPTER XXI.  
  
A RIDE THROUGH THE SAXON-WASTED LAND.  
  
By the common oath,                  
              In the midst of his Cymry                  
Defending Tren,                          
             That wasted town.--LLYWARCH.

  
TWENTY men rode with them; this time not through desolation at the
first, for some hearth-smoke was always rising. Yet the human thread
remained very slender everywhere.  
   Toward the end they came into a better region than the hill-country
of Argoed; but plainly it had fared much worse. The ruins which they
passed were significantly humble ones, and of recent date. There was
that in the air which made human spirits fail. The faces of men looked
haunted and fugitive.  
   Dynan felt it all with strange intensity. Though dropping his passing
word of hope on unpromising soil, he sat often for a long time by the
fire with chin on hand. His soul, tired of despondent things, went
lightly over the hills in his musing, to find Freur of the pensive eyes
in her cloud of hair, amid the calm of eventide.  
  
Page 203  
  
   It passed on also into a future that should not be lived alone. In
lovely scenes he saw her; but all faded away as he sank from those
welcome visions into the wilder, vaguer, and more shifting ones of
sleep.  
   Then a dread thing came to pass. A woman-like form held his eye.
Waveringly apparelled was she in that lightest, filmiest green of the
bud-bursting in early spring. Whether of good or evil, he could not say,
but a being of the subtler world most surely. He could not fix any
lineament and remember it. There were only the essence of a mockery, a
living, denying perversity, an inexplicable power to whirl away and
inthrall. He was aware of motion, as though that head of haze and
starlight were very slowly shaken. A voice like running water reached
his ears--"No, for I claim you." There was a sound as of the blowing of
his own elfin horn, a rush upon him of many terrors; and in the dawn he
awoke. But thereafter his mirth grew fitful and no longer free. The
unearthly chord in him answered to unearthly vibrations.  
   Not all were overborne in Cian's realm, but industry had been broken.
Why sow, for the raiding enemy to reap or destroy utterly? Why build the
bonfire of the Furies? Life tended toward the simple ways of hunting and
herding. Flocks were gathered within walls of a night, and often by
day.  
  
Page 204  
  
They were made also to grow, in a manner, by wide-ranging, retaliatory
forays. Villages had given place to towers with outlying enclosure, even
the prince's birthplace being more a fortress than a town.  
   There they found Cian's father, badger-gray, and badger-like in
endurance, with two war-hardened sons, both a little uncouth by reason
of harsh conditions and stunting. Proud of his eldest, fighting far away
with Arthur, the old man, from first to last, had set his teeth, holding
the bones of his princedom with a bitter grip, sending news of each
victory as best he could, but stifling every cry for aid. Even now, in
trebly welcoming Llywarch, this tough old border-king--who still
maintained that title--must needs tempt him aside, and beseech him to be
silent. "For we would not draw Cian away from the greater work before
him."  
   Yet the thought crossed the Prince of Argoed that right here, in the
midst of these hate-stimulated, half-organized resources, well within
stroke of the enemy, there might be for Cian of the Chariots such an
opportunity as no one had yet felt or seen.  
   Even to Llywarch, free as any living man from Druidic ties and
mystery, strange allusions were addressed, having to do with the occult
power, fore-knowledge, and design of his friend. There was very evident
expectancy abroad of great things from him.  
  
Page 205  
  
In this sequestered and battered bit of the island were more men than
elsewhere who had openly taken to the restored rites of Mona with
superabundant zeal.  
   But Llywarch and Dynan were not even yet in the extremest ragged
selvage of living Britain. The rush of the northwestern Saxons through
the old soldier population--the far-descended offspring of many races in
garrison along the great wall--had borne fragments before it which
resisted as they could, and for the most part left them stranded at last
along the edge of the great woods or in isolated fastnesses.  
   Thence at intervals masses of people came in, of varying quality,
often before unheard of. Still out in that land, now growing strange
unto men, abode the sons of the crags and caves, the daughters of myth
and rumor. It seemed well every way to seek these lost people of the
wild, and also to see with his own eyes what the Saxons were doing.
Therefore they took horse again, with Cian's youngest brother for escort
and guide; also a few of his men. Their course was partly at random,
with frequent changes, but having certain points in mind where people
who had taken refuge were reported.  
   One of these they found, but not its people, nor any hint as to why
they had gone, or when they had been borne away.  
   Another small settlement lay north of the Saxon  
  
Page 206  
  
war-road which ran toward the cities and valleys of the west. There was
little to be noted in it beyond a very hideous idol-god in a hollow and
doleful place. Even a sea-robber would hardly covet it.  
   "I thought I knew all about Poverty," said Dynan; "but until now I
never saw him bowed down to and worshipped. There's not a doubt of it.
As soon as I set eyes on the old fellow, I knew him for the jolly
abominable acquaintance of early days."  
   These demi-savages were but faintly stirred by the name of Arthur or
by any news from the south. Yet they fancied themselves, vaguely and
crudely, more in the world than were some others,--especially the
cliff-people, of whom, in their uncouth way, they told wonderful things,
after the manner of men concerning what is hid by a veil, though near.
For across the interval bands of Saxons and lawless renegades were
roaming continually.  
   Not long after setting forth again, the explorers had some taste of
these latter people. Riding briskly through open woods, their hoofs rang
out such music from the frozen ground that they tempted an ambush. A
flight of arrows, coming from everywhere, emptied three saddles
together; and then spears were in play.  
   During the first bewildered moments, there were those who would have
fled if they had any fancy whither to go. But Llywarch and Cian's
brother held them together by voice and deed; while Dynan,  
  
Page 207  
  
catching sight of horses, made for them with a great clamor, whereby the
Saxons lost their main advantage, being driven to hurry from covert in
defence of their booty. Yet even this proved unavailing; and in the end
they were driven away, leaving most of it.  
   From one of them, wounded and captured, Llywarch learned that their
foray was a most recent one, made on those very people whom he sought.

CHAPTER XXII.  
  
AMONG THE CAVE-DWELLERS OF THE SCAUR.  
  
With a fair maid, a paragon of splendid form,             
Have I been wandering in gloom and among sprites.  
                          --MERDDYN.

  
THE snow was driving, the wind was making uncanny noises, and the night
was coming on with benumbing cold in those naked heights where Llywarch
and his company had travelled for a day and more, when they rode out
suddenly on the brink of a cliff. Below their horses' heads there was
nothing but air; a great rough wall, snow-dimmed, opposite; the bottom
of the cleft in shadow already.  
   "It must be the place--the Scaur, as they call it," said Dynan, but
not very confidently; for of late nothing had been quite certain to them
except losing their way in the storm. "Look!" he exclaimed the next
moment, jubilantly pointing across.  
   The sunset reflection from a cloud that floated high was thrown
aslant a ledge of the opposite cliff. There, faintly rose-flushed in it,
stood a token, quaint and homely, of man's presence,--a brown goat,
motionless as though carved from the rock.  
  
Page 209  
  
   "Not wild," said Cian's brother. "He listens for men without being
afraid."  
   Then, drawing breath, all of them raised a shout together, which the
echoes hurled from side to side below, prolonging it down the valley.  
   At once there rose the barking and baying of many excited dogs of
every degree. Human voices awoke also, in tones of concern and warning,
then ceased with a sudden hush. A half-grown lad, bow in hand, was where
the goat had been, peering keenly upward, but holding himself ready to
spring away at need. The arrows which he carried were held loosely, as
though snatched up on the moment. A ragged mantle of some bright stuff
dropped from him as he turned, showing a goat-skin tunic below. But the
knife-hilt in his girdle had the glitter of jewellery, and he was
brow-bound with gold like a chief.  
   At first sight of them he called out gladly, then paused, shading his
eyes for closer scrutiny. Thereupon they announced their names and
quality. He seemed to strain in comprehending them amid that
reverberation of sound; but he repeated "Argoed" with evident
recognition. He indicated a way down quite near them, and shouted
delightedly below. Then the hubbub began again, but in a different tone.
They saw him hurry down, with a gesture to show that he was coming to
guide them.  
   It was needed. On reaching the shelving ravine  
  
Page 210  
  
of their pathway, they found it so enveloped in murk, so steep and
narrow, winding and uncertain, that they slipped willingly one by one
from their saddles, and felt their way cautiously, bridle in hand. But
before any real trouble had been encountered, sturdy figures were beside
them, offering aid, though sometimes in unfamiliar speech. The stripling
who had greeted them across the chasm was almost among the first,
wofully out of breath, however willing to be voluble. There was a
kindness and wildness of pride about him which they found becoming.  
   For some moments, to the discomfiture of their horses, great
movements of light, as from hidden fires, had rolled and shot across the
valley. As they turned a corner in reaching the level ground below,
there came on them a flood of smoky brightness. Looking up-stream, the
cliff swelled outward at a little height over the turf, so as to form a
long, low, narrow chamber, now stockaded for the protection of cattle.
Horns and ears appeared above the pointed stakes and well behind the
gorse-fires, too much accustomed to excitement among their human
companions for any grave disquiet. But their own horses and some of the
recaptured ones made stout protestation. They had, therefore, to be
picketed farther away.  
   On the flat summit of the arch a good pile of solid wood was blazing.
Behind it, a broad patch  
  
Page 211  
  
of blackness, fitfully relieved, indicated the cavern home. All about it
were men and women, variously clad, but mainly in some makeshift between
civilization and the life of the wild.  
   One tall and martial figure, though very aged, borne just then on a
litter through the entrance, lifted himself at sight of Llywarch and
Dynan, and waved his hand with a sonorous call of welcome. A warmer
greeting awaited them when they had mounted the path to his side.  
   "There is not much that Edyrn can bid you to," said he. "This hole in
the cliff has been castle and banquet-hall and everything to us for so
long that we have come to love it as men will love their home. But more
sunshine than I can tell you is in the heart of a long-buried old man
like me for the friends who come to him with kind faces and good deeds
from the living world of his own people."  
   "Not surely Edyrn of the Scarlet Coat?" inquired Dynan, with a
bewildered air.  
   The old man's eye brightened, but he smiled and shook his head. "That
great hero--my father's father--died while I was young," said he;
"before misfortune"--  
   At the word a spasm of coughing took him, and two of his people bore
him out of the smoke and heat. At the same time a very graceful and
womanly figure issued from the cave, going anxiously toward him,  
  
Page 212  
  
but with a side-glance at themselves in passing,--kind and grave and
gently curious. Llywarch's heart stirred as at a summons. Those eyes of
Lebanon and of the desert!  
   The same Oriental quality was in the countenance and bearing of the
venerable man who now addressed them, a Christian priest, undoubtedly,
by the surplice he wore. No need to explain that this, kept sacredly,
had outlasted all other outer apparel, and so come of necessity into
daily use. An odd contrast! for by all hints of aspect that venerable
figure should rather have been practising the grim rites of Astarte, or
the thoughtful magic of Zoroaster, under fervid skies far away.  
   "Pray come in," said he. "The torches are lighting. The evening meal
will soon be ready." They followed him into the now brightening and
reddening cavern.  
   It was a great natural hall, with a long table in the middle, of oak
slabs hewn to tolerable smoothness, but left uncovered. Seats of various
patterns, mostly crude, were along the sides; one at the farther end
being throne-like and carved with elaboration, as if brought from
elsewhere. Many doorways opened into branching cave-chambers, which
served the various needs of the settlement. Some of these were left
open, others hung with skins by way of curtains; almost all had been
smoothed and rounded from  
  
Page 213  
  
their first rude shape. As Llywarch was marshalled through one, there
came to him through another a vision of a domed sparkling chapel, and a
whitespread altar aglow with tapers, as at a thank-offering. He bowed
without speech. It made his heart swell to think that his coming had
been so devoutly welcome.  
   The priest had seen the motion. "We could not do less," he said. "We
have never done less when any one has come to us, by God's will, out of
the life of Christian Britain. We esteem them his light-bearers."  
   "Angels, that is to say," laughed out Dynan. "Oh, now, if you are
going to convince us that we are angels!" His face grew respectfully
sober, as he added, "But I saw indeed a spirit of the holy twilight pass
in before you bade us."  
   Llywarch looked repression; but the priest accepted his words quite
simply. "It was my dear daughter Sanawg," said he. "She has been
lighting the tapers. You saw her also with the chief outside. And now I
hope you will find here all that is needful. We of the under-world must
content ourselves, not with what we would, but what we may."  
   Truly a very incongruous toilet provision awaited them. The water
running freely through clefts in the rock fell, indeed, into a natural
basin, half niche, half ledge, and thence into a greater one in the
floor  
  
Page 214  
  
itself before passing away. But to supplement these--there being so many
guests--a great variety of vessels had been brought and filled. One,
richly ornamented, was of silver, heavy and pure, the little arrows,
cupids, and snake-heads around its border, and the rounded outlines of
the nude, struggling nymphs below, gleaming in the torchlight. Just
beside it was another, of uncouth shape and ill-baked clay, almost like
some child's plaything moulded of the roadway mire. Then a finely woven
piece of tarred wicker ware. And again a shallow thing of fretted
coralline pottery, very thin, and resonant even to light tapping.  
   "There is something of all our history here," said the old man, by
way of comment. "If it links us one way with the savage, it links us the
other way to kind homes which the Saxons burned for us, and the vanished
beauty of Isurium."  
   "It is a city my father has spoken of," said Llywarch, with a tinge
of sadness.  
   "And it may be of some who dwelt there," suggested the old man,
smiling. "If so, you perhaps have heard of me, \`Gwydion.'"  
   "Often!" exclaimed Llywarch.  
   "Who has not?" echoed Dynan.  
   In their minds an old song-fragment ran:--  
   "Gwydion ap Don of the toiling spirits,  
   By enchantment created a woman from blossoms."  
  
Page 215  
  
   With it came to mind a repute for learning so wide in range and
uncommon in quality that the rumor of magic went with it. They saw how
well the look of the man and his accessories fitted the fancy. Dynan
shifted his footing. Llywarch seemed half uneasy, then smiled at
himself.  
   Gwydion reassured them pleasantly. "I could not venture to cope with
one so much more nearly allied to faery," said he, pointing to Dynan's
wonder-working heritage. "But in truth I am very far from a magician.
Nothing more, I assure you, than a harmless old man, who has learned a
little something of a great world, and a much greater one to follow.
Meanwhile I aid a hero, still older, who needs it, and strive to keep
yet a remnant in the right way. The church of God has taken to the
under-world before."  
   He bowed, and passed from them. Dynan hummed the song-words to
himself again, "a woman from blossoms" coming forth aloud.  
   Llywarch splashed impatiently, half-drowning his face in the water,
then raised it good-humoredly.  
   "I should not wonder if you have hit the mark," said he.  
   When summoned again to the dining-hall, they found a fire burning at
the far end, seemingly for the good of old Prince Edyrn, who sat nearest
it, now in full vigor and almost impossible youthfulness. As he
completed for them that joyous greeting which had  
  
Page 216  
  
been interrupted outside, they could see that their mere presence, and
the revival of old patriarchal memories, had left little need for any
other cordial. All the cavern people, both men and women, in due
succession were made to know them, even to young maidens; for of these
last, not uncomely, there were more than a few. The sounds, rather than
the sight, of children showed that these, too, were plentiful, though
just then in some subterranean hiding-place.  
   Now, whether of Edyrn's will or her own, Llywarch was given seat
nearest that of Sanawg, daughter of Gwydion. Very gracious and welcoming
he found her; subtly strange with that beauty from afar, but more than
pleased to please, and eager beyond eagerness to hear; yet
self-restraining, and willing to learn by his general answer rather than
by closeness of questioning, nor in any regard less than modest. But, as
to that, there were so many anxiously querying or boastful that she had
little need.  
   Edyrn in especial often spoke, exulting openly, as one who deemed the
Saxon host would soon be broken, and that the great Emperor with all the
embattled powers of Britain would come sweeping by, to do him honor
before the setting of his day,--the dream of a lone champion who sees,
after years of hidden strife and silent waiting, the gathering of many
friends! The hearts of the young men warmed toward him; nor less to the
grand old priest, the  
  
Page 217  
  
wisest of his day, yet child-simple, keeping faithfully one little taper
of faith aglow in the hollow of the hills, out of all sight but that of
God, abiding in patience, manful and holy, the slow wearing from them
day by day of whatever was most gracious and lovely. Llywarch knew,
moreover, that Sanawg read the admiring compassion of his soul, which
made him thankful.  
   Merry as that gathering was, even before the mead went round, it left
ample room for pity. Rich ornaments were among them, for gold and jewels
lose nothing by time; but in apparel there was much of savage makeshift,
much also of spectral gentility. Sanawg's own robe would have been
tattered but for careful mending, which yet showed over plainly, and
seemed the more faded in seeming for the brightness of the brooches that
fastened it over her shoulders. The men had fared even worse, as her
father's expedient indicated. The commoner sort went mainly in
sheepskin, as did also a few of better quality, whose words,
nevertheless, were well chosen, and their bearing courteous exceedingly.
Others, martial figures, wore Saxon garments, no doubt the spoil of some
dead raider.  
   That was an evening which bade fair to have no end. When the table
was cleared, and the mountain mead circulated no longer, or only in
distant corner eddies, the yet more grateful quaffing of tidings from  
  
Page 218  
  
the outer world went on increasingly. For now nearly all could come
thronging about the narrators; and their aged leader, chuckling and
brightening, was less than ever extreme to mark what might go amiss.  
   Then were the campaigns of the great Arthur fought over again, and
the reviving glories of the South grew visible to their eyes,--Caerleon,
Caer Badus, Caer Gloi, and more, bourgeoning about their white Roman
marbles with the fresh current of life that had been turned from the
Thames to the Severn; Camelot, queen of the hills and the border,
wherein old Rome had little part or none, but all was the fantastic
thought of Merlin, or the high hope of Arthur, or the fresh splendor of
the young island empire, bodying itself in many diverse forms on high;
and beyond all, that gathering of princely men about the Emperor,--the
men of glittering joust and wild-wandering emprise, of mystic aspiration
and daring beyond all their race, the fame whereof had penetrated
already into distant nooks.  
   Old Edyrn thrilled under it. "I had heard--I had heard a little,"
said he. "Even in my time, taking some hint from Rome, the great
Ambrosius had begun,--even in my time, while I yet held some fragments
of the great wall for him. There were games of strength among us then,
and tilting, and sallies to find what we might set aright in the de-  
  
Page 219  
  
batable land next the heathen,--all which has since grown into more, and
holds the seeds of such promise for a race like ours. Praised be God
that these old eyes have been held open until the true break of day."
Then Gwydion and all the people responded, "Praised be God!"  
   Sanawg, only, said not a word where she had sat, bending, all her
life in her eyes, while first one guest spoke, and then another.
Presently she rose, and stepped away. Coming back with a harp before
her, she laid it in Llywarch's hands, saying gently, "We have heard
still more of what the princes of Camelot and of Argoed can do, or we
know it without hearing." As if his fame for minstrelsy were already
abroad among them, voices clamored on every side for his battle-songs,
his wild war-music; and Dynan, mischief in his eye, urged them on,
suggesting new incentives and more apposite praises.  
   So Llywarch took the harp, laughing but proud, and played and sang as
never before. The eyes of Sanawg had been in his at the giving, and
something passed between that lifted him with a great exultation and
bore him on. A world of subtle power possessed him. The old intoxication
of battle revived with transcending stir and swell in the thought that
for her, and beings rare as her, the great fight above all was raging.
He sang of Vortimer, son of Vortigern, and how amid the running of the
foam-beads and the curv-  
  
Page 220  
  
ing crash of the breakers, that hero smote the heathen, boats and men
together, by the great rock on the shore of the Gallic sea. He sang of
Arthur the Emperor, child of mystery and of terror, star of the
southwestern ocean haze that rose beside Tintagil, and now, in victory
after victory, a portent and a promise, astounding the nations of the
heathen, uplifting all his land toward what she yet should be. He closed
with a great burst of appeal to every living Christian soul in that last
clashing of Armageddon which was now upon them; and it left all
trembling.  
   Then Sanawg, as if moved by some power beyond herself, came forward
and laid her hand on his arm. "After that, no more!" said she, in her
tone a solemn, half-defiant pride, as of one under glad enchantment.  
   Gwydion said gravely, "Do not interrupt our guest, my daughter." He
smiled, and added, "We have all been beyond ourselves, under a greater
magic than silly folk ever ascribed to me."  
   Llywarch shook his head, murmuring, "Gwydion, lord of the toiling
spirits, by enchantment created a woman from blossoms."  
   Sanawg flushed a little, and smiled a little, feeling many eyes on
her, but answered with an awakening look, "I am not dreaming, my father,
nor in the shadows of faery. Surely I am thankful to Prince Llywarch for
thinking so kindly of me. We will de-  
  
Page 221  
  
lightedly listen again to the harp of Argoed." For she thought there
might be shelter therein. And she drew away a little.  
   But he answered, The sweeter music ends the ruder;" and they who
loved her, having the melody of her voice yet in their ears, were well
pleased with his words.  
   Then Dynan, aware of his friend's longing, took the task of the hour
to himself, and told them vividly the strangest and the most stirring
things, one after another; while Llywarch, with slight comment, more and
more drew from the circle, as by drifting, until, even among so many,
under the tossing and rolling of the torchlight and billowy shadow, he
and the daughter of Gwydion were together again. The huddle of eager
people was a screen of privacy to them, and so were the many voices.  
   She did not at all withdraw, but willingly made room for him, and
speech with him, in very modest gladness, asking and telling of things
less general than had been spread before all. He felt, surely, the
underflow of personal concern run through it; so that, in bidding
good-night, the parting of their eyes was like a lip-pressure. Llyvarch
seemed aware of her presence yet with him when she was really there no
more.  
   Then he went out through the thinning men-clusters of the great
cavern, where some were casting  
  
Page 222  
  
themselves down to sleep, and took the way to his good horse, in frosty
starlight, although he had little fear but that all was well. The stave
of Dynan was in his ears at every step. "A woman from blossoms!" Ah, but
not of this pale, cold, anxious northern land; flowers of the air they
were, flame-golden, yet striking no root in polluted earth; night-bloom
of Tyrian purple, distilling a sacred twilight dew. For Sanawg, the
cavern maiden, was already a great inciter of hyperboles to the Prince
of Argoed; and, in giving her life, Gwydion had wrought more enchantment
than he knew.  
   The light hand of the fairy's child fell on the dreamer's shoulder. A
low laugh came after it, as of one who knew. Llywarch, turning face to
face in the faint light, laughed also.  
   "I have seen so many, many women," said he. "I have laughed and sang
and feasted with so many. And now "--  
   "You are bewildered, as I see," answered Dynan, nodding. "But these
are sudden times; and a soldier's love, like his fighting, must come
quickly, or it will be little good,--in a world where nothing lasts
long."  
   At the tone of those final words, Llywarch came out of his musing, to
look on this true friend with some sense of trouble. Something--a very
little--he had surmised between Dynan and Freur, but  
  
Page 223  
  
knew of no cause for disquiet in that, being very willing.  
   "You are a man of happy fate," quoth Dynan. "There is none to bar
your way."  
   "And who on earth should bar yours?"  
   "None on earth assuredly;" said Dynan, and turned back, while
Llywarch stared after him.

CHAPTER XXIII.  
  
THE RIDE TO ISURIUM AND A WILDER RIDE HOMEWARD.  
  
Bright were the burgh dwellings,         
Many its princely halls,                       
High its steepled splendor,                  
Many a mead-hall full of human joys;  
They perished in wide slaughter,         
Therefore these courts are dreary.      
                          --THE RUIN, *Codex Exoniensis.*

  
NEITHER a jesting and subtly minded friend's enigma, nor even a sudden
seizure of love, will avail very long to keep a man awake when outworn
and weather buffeted. Llywarch, with all his people, slept well
underground through the remnant of the night. Indeed, much later, for
daylight meddled not in that place with either dead slumber or
dreamland. No man nor woman molested them, for mercy abode there also.  
   But when their first awakening was heard a very mirthful echo came
from the main cave-hall, where voices grew loud and plentiful, as after
restraint withdrawn. Yet few men remained when these laggards entered
from that side cavern which had been theirs for the night. There were
only invalids, and  
  
Page 225  
  
the aged like Edyrn and Gwydion, with many children, and women of every
degree. Sanawg came also, revealing more heart in her face than they
all.  
   Very playfully she chided her warlike oversleepers, wondering aloud
whether such were now the leisurely fashion in great Arthur's
encampment, and whether Ossa Cyllalaur would be as tender of rousing
them as were the wild cave-people. Outside, the sun-jewels were on the
thin night-fallen snow.  
   This was the first of divers restful days; for these hidden people
had much to solace their life in good fare and hunters' pleasure, also
those gifts of the dairy which mountaineers chiefly love.  
   It so befell that each of the leaders among the guests found
opportunity for some exploit which might be long remembered in
tale-telling when they were gone. For Dynan, the swift of foot, in one
of their hunting-parties, fairly overran a wild boar among the upland
ravines, and cut him behind the ear with a slant deadly stroke before
any dog came up, or the beast could turn at bay. And Llywarch, one black
night when a bear came sniffing about the beehives,--their main hope for
mead-honey and home-like merriment,--sallied out with a torch in one
hand and a spear in the other, scattered the uproarious pack from before
the niche of the rock where that great robber had sheltered himself, and
spitted him fairly  
  
Page 226  
  
through the heart, in so narrow a pass that any slip or failure might
have drawn death to him.  
   Sanawg did not often take part in such rough games, even as a
witness. But for a good part of every day she was willingly with
Llywarch, sometimes guiding him to wild and secret places, where
rivulets came showering out of the cliff-front, making icicles among the
lingering fronds of the fern; sometimes into soft, moist, branching
valleys, where the cattle and horses found some little pasture even yet.
Less often they ascended the cliff, and ranged the open hill-country for
miles, watching warily for Saxon raiders or other unfriendly people. As
the end of his stay drew near, they planned a wider flight, even to the
wreck of Isurium.  
   All of the quaint cool colony wished them well, holding them near
betrothal. But the thought of this journey made her father grave, since
rumors were abroad that the Saxon host had begun drifting that way. But
Edyrn took Sanawg's hand with a laugh, commending her daring, and the
brave sons that should some day be born of her, until her cheek flamed,
and she turned away. In mercy he turned his words also.  
   "Llywarch," said he, "it is like enough this ride will give you all
that the Emperor will care to know. Somehow the Saxons find the dead
city more to their taste than the city of the living. It will be a
marvel  
  
Page 227  
  
if you do not see an army worth looking on when you get to the broad
plains beyond the ruins."  
   "But then," said Llywarch thoughtfully, "I must own that our dear
lady would be safer where she is."  
   "If safety were all," replied Sanawg, "we must admit that it would be
safer never to have come into the world. Life is the most perilous of
adventures."  
   "The wisdom of Gwydion! The sins of the fathers visited"--chuckled
Edyrn.  
   "And it is so long since I have seen our old home!" urged Sanawg, not
adding, what was in her thought--"I may soon be where I can never see it
again."  
   But this, too, Gwydion understood. A moment he stood by her
meditatively, stroking her hair. "Then go, my dear," he said gently;
"but, I pray you, be careful."  
   So they set forth in the early dawn, riding leisurely, for they could
not tell whether they should come homeward with hot pursuit behind them
or no.  
   Their road lay at first over high moors, where little life was
visible except the great stalking bustard or the sailing eagle. Then the
ground began slanting downward, and grew more rugged and woody. At last
they came out upon pleasantly rolling openland, with groves and streams
that ran in quiet. About noon they drew rein where Isurium had been.  
  
Page 228  
  
No Saxons were to be seen there, nor any other people, but only a few
homeless dogs, very forlorn, and the wild creatures of the wilderness.
Nor did it seem that any one would willingly dwell there again, so
complete was the desolation. But Llywarch, for greater certainty, had
search made in the broken dwellings and all doubtful places near them,
and sent forward scouts to find where the Saxons might be. Dynan
followed.  
   Meanwhile they dismounted, to dine beside a brier-entangled spring
which had once been a fountain of many jets in one side of the forum
space. Not far away a few delicately wreathed columns were yet standing,
though not all at the same angle nor to the same height. Others lay
broken where great force had flung them.  
   All about were dwellings in every stage of dilapidation, from mere
rooflessness to utterly formless heaping. Here the floor-mosaic showed,
and that only; there the wall-frescoes were coming to light again by the
peeling of the plaster which had long overlaid them. Fragments of
cornice-work and statuary were built into house-walls; themselves, in
their turn, abandoned now and ruinous. Confusion of the old and the new,
overthrown together, reached its utmost in a barricade-like wall which
encircled this more lately inhabited core of the town.  
   "Here," said Sanawg, "is all the Isurium I have  
  
Page 229  
  
ever known. But it was bright then, and alive with people. What with
caravans and travellers and soldiery, many folk went and came."  
   He answered, "Yet it must always have been sad, with those outer
ruins everywhere beyond your gates. Not like that great earlier Isurium
which beat back the Saxon for a time, after even imperial Eboracum had
fallen."  
   He was glad to tempt that sweet voice into telling the old tale
again. And those eyes,--what centurion of Syria, holding the gate of
that royal city, had found his bride there long, long ago, and left
whatever was best of him among the people he guarded?  
   "There was a shadow," said Sanawg dreamily. "I knew it as a child,
but I think it did not make me sad. Our people hoped then to roll back
the tide,--ah, me, as we are always hoping! Sometimes I rambled through
the gates, or was taken pleasuring among thickets and ruins, and
wondered how long ago all that destruction befell, and why the heathen
must come so far to do us such harm.  
   "Of course I know now that the former desolation was checked by the
coming of aid from Caer Ligion before the rugged heart of the town could
be stormed, where the desperate townsmen, heaping everything before
them, had made their final stand. Later, Ambrosius guarded it until he
weakened near his end. What could be picked and gathered from  
  
Page 230  
  
the outer town aided us, it being our quarry, so that we did not fare
altogether the worse for past losses. A man might dwell half his days
quietly in that Isurium, which was not the proud Isurium of Rome, nor
yet this Isurium of the dead. It was mine: it is mine. And I--am just
Sanawg of lost Isurium."  
   She spoke tenderly, half playfully, with one arm on the broken coping
of the fountain. Llywarch found a subtle and touching fitness in this
claim to a heritage of oblivion.  
   "I was very young," she resumed, "when I first heard of the cliffs by
the Scaur, where at need we might find shelter. Once--we thought it a
long journey--I was taken there to see. Wild and dangerous people held
the cave then; and, although the valley was lovely in that summer-time,
we were glad to get away.  
   "Afterward there came tidings that the southern Saxons were hard
pressing the Emperor, and all strength was drawn to him from our border.
Northward and eastward the enemy were gathering,--the Deirans of Caer
Ebrauc, the Bernicians behind them, all Saxons together. Soon the storm
burst on us, and on all the country as far as the great wall, where it
was not wasted already. Then the hills were full of hiding and flying
people, and distress and sorrow were abroad everywhere.  
   "In the midst of it Prince Edyrn came down to us  
  
Page 231  
  
from the wall-country, breaking his way like a maddened bull, more eager
to do hurt than to win safety. For his great knowledge and skill in arms
we made him chief captain; and with these, and the fighting men who
thronged our town, the Saxons for that time were discomfited, leaving
our little Isurium jubilant, though in a very dismal desert.  
   "But we well knew they would come again; and it was the judgment of
cool counsel that we should make all ready to withdraw. So the cave was
stocked and guarded; and when news reached us that the great Emperor
Ambrose had fallen, we knew it was time to be gone. The enemy were not
long behind us, but had little booty; for trade had long been dead, and
what we could not take was scarce worth any one's taking. Yet I promise
you a slip of a girl was delighted to get away from them, even into a
cavern.  
   "There I have grown to womanhood, faintly conscious of the world
outside, not unhappy, but forgotten and wondering; buried to all except
our little cavern-tribe--just Sanawg of lost Isurium."  
   "But why? It was no place for you," he protested, every ruin around
them seeming to grant her its echo.  
   "It is no place for any of us," she admitted quietly. "But Prince
Edyrn would go no farther; and since he shielded us we would by no means
leave him, nor could a priest forsake the people of his ministration.
There are those of them who need it."  
  
Page 232  
  
She looked up brightly, or with a striving for brightness; but the glow
of his face was too much for her again.  
   "It grieves me," said he. "And above all that you, Sanawg, in the
very opening of your years"--  
   He hesitated, and she made answer. "Oh! I seem to abide it all very
well."  
   "It is not in nature nor in duty," he urged. "What is there that
others cannot do? Surely your parents will not wish you to linger among
the rocks and caves--now that I am here."  
   "They have never told me; how can I know?" she answered, half
smiling.  
   "But they know my meaning and the uncommon requirements of the
case."  
   "Uncommon, surely. But a few days ago we were strangers; and now, if
I hear you rightly, you are requiring me already."  
   She smiled without laughter, but he laughed freely. Then he ceased,
all at once, and said, "Sanawg, it is this: I cannot go back without
you."  
   "Shall we have another cave-dweller then?" said she, but presently
gave her hand kindly. "Remember, it does not all rest with me. I am a
good traveller, as you have seen. Also strange and stirring things
allure rne. In proof, I am ready now for a look at that great horde of
heathendom."  
   A call from their scouts, far up the road, had  
  
Page 233  
  
prompted this. He did not demur. When they had ridden well beyond the
town, they learned that the Saxon encampment could be plainly seen from
an eminence a mile or two farther on. With brisk hurrying they soon
gained the spot, and mounted through the lower wooded part of the slope
to the bare scalp of the hill.  
   Sanawg put her hands together, with a little sighing cry of
admiration, for indeed it was a rare and gallant sight. The Saxon was no
less fond of brightness and gay coloring than the Briton; and with him,
being cruder, they made a more obvious show at a little distance.
Moreover, what remained of wealth about that old Eboracum, where Roman
emperors had set up their standards and gone forth to conquer, was all
Saxon now. With few exceptions, the ramp was fresh and clean, as if just
from some workshop--acres on acres of white tenting, a profusion of
scarlet, crimson, and gold. Sparks flew from weapon-points everywhere;
the sun glowed on mirror-like armor.  
   "A pity for so much neatness to be spoiled!" said Llywarch, rather in
Cian's vein.  
   Dynan laughed. "Our own folk can be exquisite at the start, if that
were all. But marshes and rocks and thickets are unmerciful."  
   But Llywarch had grown thoughtful. "They are more nearly ready than I
thought," said he. "And there are even less horse than usual. They will
try  
  
Page 234  
  
to break through Celidon, behind Legiolum, and that soon. I hope it may
not be far enough west for them to be drawn to the sacking of Loidis."  
   "Amen!" answered Dynan fervently; then he added with conviction, "But
they will take a shorter way to a greater quarry. They are many and very
vengeful. Think of the glory in shattering Arthur and Legiolum! Think
also of the wealth of Caer Lerion, which is yet Ratae the magnificent,
and all the temptations of middle Britain."  
   "Yes," said Llywarch. "No doubt that would be their road.
Especially," and he turned to Sanawg, "if I may judge by the dipping
together of the hills yonder."  
   She answered, "I remember to have heard of a pass through the ridges
of the great forest, where once, a long time ago, were some villages,
and a track leading southward. I think it must be that. Yet in my time
no one ventured into the haunted shadows of Celidon."  
   "And that," said Llywarch, "is another reason why they gather so
vastly. The Saxon hates the wood-darkness and the spectres of his own
making. I see Ossa Cyllalaur's great tent yonder, well encircled. He is
the strongest and bravest of them, or he would never dare this venture.
But if we might catch him half-way, his soldiers would be less before
getting out again. Here they come, more and more!"  
  
Page 235  
  
   His hand waved eastward, almost enthusiastically, where were
advancing bodies of men and faint murmurs. Dynan pointed nearer.  
   "They come indeed," quoth he quickly.  
   Some outlying horsemen on the nearer side of the camp were
unpicketing steeds, with glances toward the party on the hill.  
   "A woman's curiosity has its limits," replied Sanawg. "I am not
curious to know what they will think of us on closer inspection."  
   She turned as she spoke, and rode downward, her friends about her.
Many calls and cries, far behind, informed them that the pursuit had
begun.  
   Llywarch chided himself, as they rode, for bringing that dear girl
into such peril. Their horses already had come a long way, and surely
some of the enemy must be able to overtake them. Reversing the usual
counsel in a trial of speed, he took the utmost pace at the beginning;
for it was life to them to get well beyond reach of that great concourse
before any such hampering.  
   At the ruins of Isurium they paused a moment and looked backward. The
foremost of the Saxons were just coming into view. A mile beyond they
turned again, and saw the road well dotted, even to the dead city. Their
own party was straggling now, and they checked a little to unite it.
Then they went swiftly again, but with caution.  
  
Page 236  
  
   After a time they had hostile attendants at the sides and in the
rear; but these were few, keeping their places with effort, and lacking
the desperation to fall on with thrust and blow. Jeers were called back
and forth in languages ill understood; but the British leaders, riding,
with Sanawg between them, at the head, gave neither word nor sign. These
clinging enemies did not greatly increase until the edge of the rough
country was reached.  
   Then Llywarch, placing a guard about Sanawg, turned suddenly with the
remainder of his men, and drove back this living war-spray on the first
Saxon wave behind. Striking this, as it gathered and made front, he
drove it also.  
   For a time the Saxons held aloof, bringing all their force together,
with snow beginning to fall and drive, and the wind in their ears. And
Sanawg and her guardians were nimbly in flight again.  
   The weather alone was enough to urge them on, there being a sudden
violence in the air, a spreading thickness overhead, and great access of
cold. They did not feel this so painfully when in swift, rough motion,
even Sanawg uttering no complaint at all; but the ground was already so
chilled that snow would lie, threatening impediment. With every minute
there was more of it in the air, and drifts were beginning. But for the
sure guides with them they must have lost their way.  
  
Page 237  
  
   Now and then Llywarch must pause a moment to wrap more and more
covering about the lady by his side; and the kindness of her eye was
reward enough for every endeavor. Her laugh was low; but unchilled,
unfearing. "I began to feel disturbed by the Saxons," she said; "but I
hope I am too true a daughter of the cliffs to mind the mere storms of
nature. Heathen are not nature, but very unnatural, you know."  
   "It is all heathenish enough," retorted he. "If I get you to the
cavern unfrozen, you must seek a milder abiding-place with me."  
   "A frozen bride would indeed be unusual," admitted Sanawg merrily,
"and perhaps not cheering."  
   But for all her spirit, the biting and the numbness gained on her, so
that there was little more speech between them, but only the set will to
keep on. This grew the harder continually, there being many places where
the tired horses could no more than flounder through; and but for a
party from the cavern, who broke the funnel-like way down the cliff,
they might never have reached their refuge. Yet it was not long after
that they sat in ample warmth and ease, telling their story over good
food to many listeners.  
   That night and the next day the storm kept on; but the air softened
notwithstanding, and the snow melted as it blew along or fell. By noon
there were  
  
Page 238  
  
only soiled heaps in places of shelter. Yellow brawling streams ran
everywhere. Gwydion and Llywarch, standing by the cavern entrance,
looked out on this together.  
   "It will be dry, or nearly so, in twenty-four hours," Llywarch began.
"Enough at any rate for travel; and I fear the enemy will be astir."  
   Gwydion bowed gravely. "You mean that you must go."  
   "Yes, to warn the Emperor." Llywarch had been gathering confidence.
He now spoke roundly and plainly.  
   "Reverend sir, I must not go alone. We have double need of your aid,
as priest and father, to send forth Sanawg with me as my wife, beyond
sight and hearing for a season. I know well that it is asking much."  
   At this admission, converging wrinkles gathered at Gwydion's
eye-corners in a rueful half-smile.  
   "Ah?" said he; "there might indeed be extreme and unreasonable people
who would say so, considering the state of the country and of the enemy
and the heavens. But I greatly fear Sanawg is not one of them."  
   Llywarch brightened under the gentle irony. "In this and all else she
is with me," said he, "saving only her duty to you."  
   Gwydion looked blankly out over the sodden land.  
  
Page 239  
  
   Llywarch began again. "Surely you would not have her stay. What
certainty have we that the Saxon host, in mere murderous caprice, or
following those who affronted them, will not fall on this your refuge?
Or, again, they may turn to it in reprisal, coming back worsted from the
great wood. At the best, is it to be thought on that she should lose the
bloom of her life in these hollows and deserts, with no light in the
dismal darkness except what may flow from your ministry and from her own
soul?"  
   Gwydion turned to him. "Believe me," said he, "I, too, have not
failed to think thus, and her mother also. We have found it cause of
grave concern and night-wakening. And I do not know that I need disguise
from you the relief that came when we guessed your interest in one
another. I have said to myself that it is best,--that it is of God. Yet
behold, I was this very minute selfishly dreading what you should say,
and wishing that, like the storm, it might somehow blow by, leaving my
good daughter with me, whom I shall, most likely, not see again."  
   Then Llywareh was shaken in purpose, but for a moment only. "Do not
say so," answered he. "If only you would all go with us!"  
   Gwydion shook his head with mournful certainty.  
   "But you are in the right as to Sanawg," said he. "We must part, and
she must go. And what is to be done shall be done very quickly."  
  
Page 240  
  
   So the next morning, with all due churchly ceremony, in mingled
sorrow and rejoicing, they were wed, and forthwith set out on their
journey toward Argoed, the whole fighting strength of her people riding
with them until sundown.  
   This better guidance greatly shortened the way, although the
heaviness under hoof counted against them. Yet again, beside the best
counsel at parting, they had now a single certain aim, and the impulsion
of great need and urgency. Thus a trivial fraction of the time spent in
wandering forth brought them to Loidis again.  
  
Page 241  
  

CHAPTER XXIV.  
  
FROM LOIDIS TO LEGIOLUM.  
  
I was truly in the enchantment.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
THERE was some knowledge of the Saxon invasion at Loidis before them,
but nothing worse than they knew. This freed Llywarch of a dread which
was troubling his new happiness. With fair speed he need no longer fear
any evil thing as a result of his lingering by the Scaur.  
   Neither his mother nor his sister would have any truce with such
self-punishment. Had he not told them, when first he came, that the
Emperor was warned and watchful? Moreover, in fact, the Saxons had not
yet moved their way, nor any way, so far as the wisest wood-rangers
knew.  
   Sanawg found herself invested with the halo of many welcomes. People
came wonderingly from far to look on the daughter of Gwydion, the one
who had spoken face to face daily with Edyrn of the olden time, a hero
long lost to men, the bride of the hollow cliffs, the bride of mystery,
the bride of Argoed. They bore away the memory of a face, lovely
indeed,  
  
Page 242  
  
but with a strange loveliness, not elsewhere known, yet marvellously
contented already. Tales were told beside the fire-leaping in rough
cabins on the woodland fringes, of just such gracious beings, who chose
willingly for a time a mortal home, too often vanishing. Nevertheless,
they had no fears of her, but loved her from the beginning; and the
ladies who so long had ruled them loved her, after the first
astonishment of her presence, best of all. To Llywarch's mother, who
held her own memories of far years, and had known Isurium, she was as a
messenger from an earlier and a brighter world.  
   Of Edyrn the good dame questioned often--young Edyrn, the hope of the
North, most head-strong, most splendid, most indomitable of princes!
Gwydion, too, she bore in mind, whose unpretending wisdom and sanctity
might well have won the power to work miracles, as men still uncouthly
made claim for him; and this was the very daughter of Gwydion! Was ever
a dowager princess of the hills and memories blessed like her in a
daughter-in-law? The news of a half-century came to her all at once by
her only son's more than lovely bride.  
   Sanawg was most willing to tell, and tell again, whatsoever she knew,
if only the time left to her and to Llywarch before their parting were
not so very meagre.  
   For, little as he dared delay, he dared still less take  
  
Page 243  
  
her with him across the path of the raging heathen. From Argoed, should
they turn that way, there was always retreat open down the stream to the
river Dee and its goodly Roman-walled city.  
   Dynan, unlike himself, had made a plea for lingering. Surely, said
he, it would be wise to send forth scouts who should ascertain the
enemy's purpose, distance, and true course through the wood. Then there
would be surer news to carry. Llywarch scarcely made answer, being
perturbed and ready for anger with every such echo of his own inner
tempting voices; and it was so very evident that haste was the supreme
need! But the fact lingered in his mind, as having to do with Dynan's
words in the starlight before the cavern, and with a coldness toward
Freur at which Sanawg had hinted.  
   For already the cave-queen had read her sister of the open air,--the
pleased expectancy in that pensive face when the fairy's son drew near,
the hurt disappointment which followed, the observant, staidly smiling
kindness to herself, as from one under government of will and pride,
seeking other companionship than that withheld, and doing the offices of
friendship justly and fondly, yet troubled, uncomprehending. Nor did any
of them comprehend him then; but later came to know him for a truly
loving man, strained against his love and against his will, daring not
(in mercy) to seek her further favor, yet  
  
Page 244  
  
hardly able to leave her so, and with the shadow of an unknown terror
awaiting him.  
   As the two men rode away together, Llywarch puzzled over him
displeasedly. But the stir of motion made his own heart more lenient and
hopeful. It was hardly in nature for a genial, comrade-loving man,
crowned so supremely with what is best in life, to continue thinking ill
of a tried friend whose mirth was failing sadly. Moreover, those
remembered words had a spectral sound in after musing; and surely that
face beside him was haunted. What could it mean, save matter to be dealt
with by masters of mystery? If only he had thought of Gwydion! But there
was Cian yet, and at the worst there was Merlin. Yet his pulse thrilled
as he espied those eyes again with friendly furtiveness, wondering what
they might have seen.  
   It was at their first night halt, well over the eastern rim of
Argoed. Dynan had been jesting excitedly, though pitifully enough to one
who thought he knew; then broke off in sullen failure. Llywarch found
him alone, out under the racing clouds, in the chill, staring toward a
woodland wall whence came unearthly murmurings. His face had something
of expectation, desperately defiant. He turned, at the touch of
Llywarch's hand on his shoulder, with a wild anger in his eye.  
   "Not me!" Llywarch protested gently. "For-  
  
Page 245  
  
give me if I have let evil come to you unaided. Tell me about it,
Dynan."  
   Then the slight figure turned again from him, shook, and broke,
sobbing, with bowed head. Llywarch stood silent awhile, pitying; then
urged again kindly, "Tell me, dear friend."  
   So Dynan gathered himself, and said, "What more shall I tell? And
what must you think of me? Is it not all like--lunacy?"  
   "Most things in this life seem so at one time or another," answered
Llywarch. "I have had little experience in things out of it. But what is
there, Dynan, that a man cannot face?"  
   The fairy's son smiled ruefully. "How should I know?" said he. "But I
have \`faced,' as you call it, far more than I had any longing to. Oh, I
thought I could bear all--till I came again to Argoed. And you, too, so
happy! Ah, Llywarch, you haven't seen!"  
   "Let me see, then."  
   "How can you? Can the mountain bird see the forms that come about the
dweller in the depths?"  
   "Am I a vulture, then? And are you a whale?"  
   Dynan was tempted into smiling, but his face grew sombre gain. "You
cannot," he repeated slowly. "I have seen when you were by."  
   Then Llywarch shuddered; and the thought came to him dismally that
eternal parting were most mer-  
  
Page 246  
  
ciful for Freur, at any cost of heartbreak. A bridegroom with the gift
of seeing too many about the altar! Scoffers visible to him, guessed by
her, mowing and menacing in the bridal chamber. That were a ghastly
wedding surely! Even in fancy he found it all too grisly, and would
eagerly be back at the camp-fire. But his first thought was for his
friend.  
   "So," said he, "you gave up my sister? Showed her chill indifference,
too, rather than horror. Thank you, Dynan."  
   The sufferer's face warmed at the tone.  
   "You understand me!" he cried. "Then we are so far of one race still.
I will try to tell you. Yet with what hope? You, so human! there is no
mist in your kindly blood: I, an echo out of some past that men have
willingly let go by, a link to forms of gleam and shadow, coming out of
deep places, watchful, sinister, lurking, hovering!"  
   "Yet," said Llywarch sturdily, "I had thought your token might
command them;" and he pointed to the horn by Dynan's side.  
   "I also trusted it," answered the child of faery. "Until lately I
have felt toward the unseen as a most mighty friend. But now--I cannot
say. It would be a summoning, a signal,--but for what to follow? Be sure
I shall not blow my horn, except in extreme need to more than me.'  
  
Page 247  
  
   "If indeed I can comprehend, or you can bear to tell, no more," said
Llywarch; "let us return."  
   But Dynan hesitated. "Wait," he said; "it began like this." Then,
with many breaks and much doleful grimacing, as of one halfminded to
jeer or pretend to jeer at himself, he told a story of strange and
growing visitation, indescribable for lack of clear outline and certain
utterance, shifting from form to form, from tone to tone, but ever
threatful or insistent, ever taunting, darkening, and behind all
unfailingly the phantom green of the lady of the hollow hill.  
   His friend listened solemnly. "It passes my skill," he said. "We will
try wiser folk when we may. Let us hope that, in the mean time, the
Saxons and your thronging tormentors may have a set-to at each other,
and make havoc of both."  
   "I had thought of that. They shall have a fair field right
willingly--to make final havoc of me."  
   He spoke no more of ghostly beleaguering, and went back to the light
with readiness. Not long after he fell quietly asleep.  
   By night of the next day they were with Arthur.

CHAPTER XXV.  
  
ARTHUR IN COUNCIL.

  
  
BEFORE Llywarch had spoken long, the Emperor checked him by a sign, and
turned to right and left with a quick succession of commands. A light
force of horsemen were to thread the more open parts of the great wood
toward the enemy, and send back tidings thereof when found. Vortimer,
with the London men, was to guard the southern exit, shielding the heart
of the country. Lancelot was to be summoned to his aid, or that of
Arthur, as needed. The main army was to prepare forthwith for a march
into the forest.  
   Vortimer heard sullenly. Ever since the first untoward news from the
south he had been more than restless. "In all this ado of wildernesses
and border towns I find nothing for London," said he. "Is her danger
worth no thought at all?"  
   There was a murmur of strong disapproval. Arthur looked into the
speaker's eyes keenly and gravely; but Constantine spoke first.  
   "I deplore the tone of my fellow-townsman, but is there not some
wisdom in his thought? We are  
  
Page 249  
  
assailed in two remote quarters at once. Here it may be long before
anything great is in danger; there the enemy confronts and perhaps
encompasses our most renowned city. Beside, we can surely crush Eschwine
and his confederates; but we are not so certain of Ossa Cyllalaur.
Moreover, these northern Saxons are at their strongest now, and will
weaken as they go southward."  
   Arthur listened to him considerately, remembering the stress and
motive.  
   "What say you, Llywarch?" he asked. "Argoed has her share in this, if
Loidis is not quite London."  
   "Because Argoed is so at stake," answered Llywarch, "I do not wholly
trust my counsel in what concerns the empire. But it is fair to say that
a Saxon defeat in the wilderness might drive fragments of them toward us
very hot and vengeful. On the other hand, if they ravage all the
lowlands, we shall be given over to that same death in life and
blackness of darkness wherein I found Edyrn, the pride of the north, and
from which I rescued Sanawg, the daughter of Gwydion."  
   "Edyrn! Gwydion! have you news of them?" cried Arthur, while all
around stared and exclaimed.  
   Thereupon Llywarch told of the cliff-dwelling colony, isled as he had
seen them, but loving still that Britain which left them in oblivion; of
their long clinging, quite alone, to a civilization whose outer  
  
Page 250  
  
signs were slipping from them; of the altar which they had set up in
their last refuge, the cavern-depths, and kept alive with the tapers of
their most holy faith; of the lady love whom he had found there and
brought forth as a bride to his home, where light could yet pierce amid
the woods and rugged lands. The thrill of all that had befallen him was
in his tone, so that men not only heard, but felt and saw.  
   Then Arthur, the Emperor, smote himself over the heart, and stood
quivering. "Llywarch, you shame me," cried he. "This Gwydion, or old
Edyrn, should be Emperor, not I." Then, turning to Constaptine and
Vortimer, "Behold how God bath saved alive all these years the feeble
folk of the rock, whom we had forsaken. Will you not trust the great
walls of London to Him a while, O ye of little faith?"  
   Constantine answered, with a sigh, "You are right, my Emperor."  
   Vortimer had been touched in some degree by Llywarch's tale, but
scarce at all by the appeal of Arthur.  
   "As many unearthly sureties for the walls as may be," said he. "There
are others who find such in the White Hill of Cynvelyn. But neither
Christ nor Vran seems to have power over the open country. The Saxons
will burn and kill even to the woodlands where lies my home, unless
there are more than promised miracles to stay them."  
  
Page 251  
  
   "Cian and Osburn work miracles that should content you," suggested
Llywarch. "And you cannot complain that either is fanatically Christian.
Let only your people who arc otherwise fanatical but half do their duty,
and I'll answer for my old comrade."  
   "Let them, indeed!" growled Caowl. "Mark you, Vortimer; I, too, am a
man of Andred. My lands border yours. Your risk is mine. *I* say we came
here to fight the northern Saxons, or I don't know what we *did* come
for. In God's name let us do it, then. If we turn our backs on one army
of the sea-folk, we shall get into that bad habit, and keep a-running.
Fight here, fight in the wilderness, fight where pleases you; but let it
be fighting, and not sneaking home to fight somebody else."  
   Arthur's face had darkened and tightened during Vortimer's words, and
moved not quite approvingly even at Llywarch's, but now it beamed. "Good
fruits from rough trees!" cried he, laying his hand on Caowl's shoulder.
"I love a man who can speak one's thought for him--and save all trouble.
What say you, Dynan?"  
   "Oh, if I may have my Emperor's other hand," answered Dynan merrily,
"I would just say that Central Britain, whence I come, would prefer, so
please you, not to be invaded. As for me, being naturally quick, the
sooner I get at a Saxon the better. And  
  
Page 252  
  
have it all over," he added, with a sudden overshadowing.  
   Arthur's hand fell kindly on him, as coveted, while he spoke. "Beware
foreboding," said he gently; "we cannot spare you, Dynan."  
   Folding his arms, the Emperor looked round the company with a bright,
firm smile. "Chiefs and princes all," said he, "I have not hands enough
to go round. Let my preference be held as for the better counsel, not
the better friends. We stand here, inheritors of more than we can
restore when ruined, guardians of what the whole world looks to us to
preserve. Wherever the savage heathen have broken in, British home-life
and Roman beauty and glory have gone down together. Not one rood more
than they must shall they win or ravage through me. I grieve for London
assailed, for dear friends endangered. But there shall be no more Edyrns
cut off in the northern wild, no more Gwydions praying for us out of the
darkness, no more ladies of the cavern forlorn and forsaken. Soldiers of
Britain, we make our fight here--here at the north, where is most
British land and British life to be shielded, where are most Saxons to
be met and overthrown. Pray Heaven there be enough of them to give us
peace for many years."  
   There was a hum and stir of applause. Vortimer did not join therein,
but stood undecided. Arthur  
  
Page 253  
  
turned to him, saying, "You have your orders. I look that you should be
moving within the hour. And now I will hear further from Llywarch and
Dynan alone."  
   All withdrew except these, Caowl lingering last. "Pardon," he said,
stepping near and speaking low, "but--you cannot trust Vortimer."  
   Arthur smiled gravely, but without surprise. "I am sorry; I should
like to," said he. "But I know well whom I can trust," and his eyes gave
the kindliest farewell.  
   Musing over it later, he sent with all speed a second message: to
Lancelot, bidding him turn back or seize any one who might essay to pass
London-ward without warrant--above all, Vortimer.  
   It was not too soon. Early abroad the next morning, Arthur found two
horsemen awaiting him. One, from the scouting party of lances, bore the
news that the Saxon van was already within the woodlands; the other,
from Caowl, that Vortimer had indeed taken his appointed post, for a
feint, but presently gone southward with a numerous but uncertain
following. In the choice of evils, with no Saxons yet near, Caowl had
taken his track, and the less resolute of the force ahead were already
dropping off to him.  
   Arthur sent word that this was well and to so continue, aiding
Lancelot in every way, and coming  
  
Page 254  
  
back to the neglected border with all strength and swiftness. He felt
with disquiet this weakening of an army, not so strong at the best as
the one which came against it; but he moved forward into the forest that
day with every man that he had.  
  
Page 255  
  

CHAPTER XXVI.  
  
IN THE FOREST OF CELIDON.  
  
The wings of dawn were the flowing of his lances.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
ARTHUR, the Emperor, after his custom, rode among the foremost, getting
early news of what it concerned him to know. This was, that the hurrying
Saxons had straggled out in a long line, the foremost, ill provided for
the sake of lightness, being already in the heart of that unknown
wilderness. He threw Caradoc across their way, lest they should reach
the open land and do harm. But most of their stores and some fighting
men were yet barely within the verge, or even out beyond. Against these
he detached Llywarch and Dynan, with swift riders.  
   Meanwhile, on the slope of a ridge that made one side of the
valley-pass they were following, he awaited the coming up of his cohorts
and legions, and the time when best to cut the knotted string of Saxons
near the middle.  
   Caradoc murmured at being enjoined to strengthen his weak numbers by
felling trees before them. Stretching forth his huge arm,--  
  
Page 256  
  
   "Is that the kind of engine to poke sticks at people from behind a
log?" he inquired, with a good-humored grimace. "The saddle will ache
for me, ache for me!"  
   Arthur smiled. "Oh! you may ride at their horse, if you will. But
don't neglect the tree-felling. One footman thus covered will count for
three. Remember, they will be coming at you more and more strongly. I
can send you half a legion later. But there will be all you will want to
do--even you!--to hold them until you have Lancelot at your back."  
   So Caradoc went, with no more words about it, but only half pleasure
in the task, and chose strong ground for his barricade. Then he stood,
awaiting all comers.  
   Llywarch's task suited him well; but there was more chance than skill
in it, as happened. For the ground roughened and thickened continually
beyond where he left Arthur, and there were no guides who perfectly knew
the way, so that this was lost after a time, and he could do no more
than blunder on vehemently, with one eye to the sun, and the other for
the Saxons. Nevertheless, he came out luckily where he should be, and
saw the pack-horses, and the provision wagons, and the groups of laden
men coming over the open fields to the entrance of the wilderness.  
   They saw him likewise, and a shout of warning  
  
Page 257  
  
went up among them; while some drew backward, and took posture of
defence together, and others hurried on to join the men and stores in
the wood. These last he followed, reaching almost as soon as they a bit
of sheltered glade where some before them had found pasture for their
horses, and piled packs and bales on the sward. Around these they were
most willing to fight, and grew in number every moment, as men, hearing
the danger, came rearward. But the ground, being fairly unencumbered,
was in favor of a mounted assault.  
   With a Celtic yell, the men of Llywarch and Dynan went at them,
breaking through their loose ranks from side to side by sheer weight and
rush, and spearing as they passed. But the Saxons thrust also, yielding
little, and threw spears with better skill than the moving men; and
sprang up on haunch and saddle, knife in hand, or rooted themselves
against the tree-boles, fighting mightily with their battle-axes.  
   But Dynan, mindful of his luck before, charged the tethered beasts,
with such diabolical brandishing and keenness of uproar, that they
strained everywhere, and many broke away in great confusion; and for
those remaining it needed but a few strokes at men and leather to make
them wild runaways in the wilderness. Dynan, as in a whirlwind, vanished
after them and with them. A few breaths, and he  
  
Page 258  
  
was there again, coming headlong, a flaming torch above his head, and
many more such flares and blazes behind him, breaking through the still
continuing medley, and lighting everything that would burn. Soon the
Saxons were right glad to get out of the fire fury of their own food and
bales; and finding little left to fight over, drew off from the glade,
massing in the road with new re-enforcements.  
   Llywarch charged them repeatedly, and drove, with increasing labor,
foot by foot, to a strong place, where, making feint of assault, he
deemed it well to leave them. For there was better service to be done by
falling on their ample, ill-defended supplies in the open country.
These, in fact, he forthwith raided without mercy, rolling up one party
on another, destroying many, and driving the remainder dismayed toward
the gates of Caer Ebrauc--the York of our days.  
   Dynan, heading the other way through the wood as Llywarch left it,
rode along the right flank of the Saxon army, looking for a chance to do
it a mischief, and yet more that no harm should come to Argoed.  
   Meanwhile the Saxons of the van were plunging in successive irregular
masses on Caradoc, the first easily broken and racing from him, whereby
he had more the pleasure of a stag-hunt than of war, but each increasing
in volume and tenacity, so that soon all the front of the barricade was
thronged with their  
  
Page 259  
  
dogged infantry, thrusting and hewing; and mounted lancers curved round
the ends assailing Caradoc's rear. Then up came the first succors
promised by Arthur, and with a heave and push the whole weight of the
enemy was carried far back again.  
   Once more in greater numbers they rushed on, and clung so that they
could barely be thrust off and held away; each army thereafter glaring
at the other, worn and desperate, with deadly intent, across a bare lane
of interval, until darkness fell.  
   In that respite the barricade was made double, with a space between,
closed at each end, forming a long, narrow parallelogram across the
Saxon advance, wherein most of the surviving Britons awaited their fate.
Caradoc, Prince of Devon, stood by the front wall of it, grimly
watchful, thinking no more of especial methods and luxuries in fighting,
his great right arm bare and reddened to the elbow. Off in the woods
behind and on either side were wet, disorderly places, whence groans
came more freely than speech. In front, the broken and tangled bodies of
men and horses littered all the ground. Beyond these, were many
murmuring voices, and moving figures dimly seen, where a multitude
seemed massing with the fury of men who grew hungrier every moment. He
could hardly hope to endure another charge.

CHAPTER XXVII.  
  
A PASSAGE AT ARMS BETWEEN LANCELOT AND VORTIMER.  
  
I will not avenge myself on him who drives me.  
                          --ANEURIN.

  
LANCELOT received Arthur's two messages together. For days he had been
fevered and worried, anxious at heart to go where he should not be,
alternately blessing and cursing the fate which kept him from temptation
and Guinevere. The peace that he had made about him was irksome, even
while new. At the call for action, he could have sprung from the ground
and shouted, all the more since it was to punish treason in another. He
sent out every way for all his men, and they came quickly.  
   Yet not until Vortimer had gone into disorderly encampment before
him; and, on the hills beyond, Caowl's pursuing tribesmen were visible.
Almost as these came in sight, a fragment broke away from Vortimer's
army, amid great contention, and drifted back toward them. Indeed, it
seemed that but a small nucleus, if any, could be counted on by that
recalcitrant chieftain.  
  
Page 261  
  
   Nevertheless, the first deliverance of Vortimer was proud and
swelling. An officer of rank bore it, demanding why so many who should
be comrades were drawn up, more like enemies, across his way.  
   Lancelot made polite obeisance. "This parade is by order of the
Emperor," said he. "We are all going northward to fight Ossa Cyllalaur,
myself in command. I am very glad of such redoubtable
re-enforcements."  
   The officer smiled understandingly. "We would rather go with you
where the fighting now is--about London," said he, being, in peace, a
lesser magnate of that city.  
   Lancelot replied, "It will comfort you and your friends to know that
late advices indicate no immediate danger there. Prince Cian has even
won some successes. Assaults will not soon be repeated. I am persuaded
that the surest way to raise the leaguer of London will be to rout first
the Saxons now pouring down from the north. Otherwise they may follow,
and be on our backs like wild cats, while we are busy with Eschwine and
the rest of them in front. I am further persuaded that we have one
paramount duty if we are to hold Britain together, and that is to obey
Britain's head."  
   Lancelot had spoken with such upright emphasis that the thought of
inconsistency did not then occur to him. The officer bowed and withdrew,
not smil-  
  
Page 262  
  
ing again, but with a suggestive face. Lancelot forthwith extended his
lines to join Caowl, in effect enclosing the doubtful runaways, who had
their choice between a very unpromising reach of uplands, barren and
rugged, and a semicircular array of the spears of their own people.
Moreover, they were melting momently about the edges, and their
opponents grew in number accordingly.  
   The report of their envoy made this all the greater. Vortimer was
nearly alone in urging violence. The mass about him showed in loud
complaints or derisive sullenness that they felt they had been brought
far on a fool's errand, and disgraced everyway for nothing.  
   Vortimer's love of popularity could not long withstand it. Instinct
and habit made him swerve with the tide. He was already half-way
advanced in an eloquent address, having that turn in view, when
Lancelot, with no more than half a dozen attendants, galloped up before
the speaker. This Lancelot was at his lordliest, both in temper and
apparel. He had plainly no inkling of Vortimer's change of purpose,
which came too late.  
   "This will not answer," he announced with deliberation.  
   The orator towered a moment, darkling, then essayed to ignore and
continue; but, seeing the wavering of his people, turned imperiously.
"Know you,"  
  
Page 263  
  
he demanded, "that these would tear you in pieces at a word from me?
Back with you to your own!"  
   The Welsh prince looked with a proud smile over the countenances
around.  
   "They do not seem quite like that," he observed. "I shall return,
Vortimer of London, but you will go with me."  
   As he spoke, his companions moved suddenly around the object of their
inroad.  
   Vortimer swelled and thrilled with the impulse to throw himself on
this affronter. There was everything to make the hour bitter. Beside the
potent contrast of success and failure, the comparison of person went
against him. He was the greater, to some degree, in size, and his ruddy,
broad, manlike beauty was plain to see; but about Lancelot there dwelt
an air of something finer, subtler, and higher, less needing insistence,
an inner assurance of superiority which all around them shared. His
celebrity in arms, also, very different from the merely local
championship of Vortimer, had a glamour of its own.  
   The London chieftain looked him over as he sat easily, a smile that
was not loving on the dark, handsome face, and stern purpose behind it.
It was not fear,--though who but Arthur or Cian could match Lancelot in
weapon-skill?--but Vortimer knew what surrounded him, and felt his
strength bleeding all away. He swept an eye of reproach and involun-  
  
Page 264  
  
tary appeal around the circle. Those nearest were his own especial
following in town or field, the core of the revolt from the beginning,
even yet not lacking a certain stubbornness.  
   "We await your orders," responded one gray centurion grimly, "and
will not hold back for fine feathers, be certain."  
   "We will not desert you in your trouble," added resolutely, though
without much alacrity, the officer who had borne the message.  
   These words had their weight with Lancelot. It was his part to save
men for Arthur and the coming battle. Evidently this great-limbed
Saxon-Briton was more beloved than he had fancied.  
   "No one doubts the prowess of the champion of Andred, nor of his
followers," he said, looking around upon them. "With such aid he might
no doubt overcome me and these few. I should not grudge him the victory,
nor mind the trial. But in striking me you strike Britain; and that is a
poor thing for any son of hers to do. This once, you have been unwise,
and unwisdom should submit manfully to its forfeit. Moreover, your
enterprise is hopeless. Even if you could overcome my army, what welcome
would Prince Cian, always faithful, give to mutineers before the
walls?"  
   "There are more to be thought of in London than Prince Cian and his
assumed ingratitude," broke in  
  
Page 265  
  
Vortimer, with his deepest voice and most swelling port of oratory.
"After what I have seen of that in higher place, it would not, indeed,
astound me. But since you and he and one higher have become--Britain--I
will not contend with Britain, but will be well content to face this
overgrown Arthur, my chief accuser."  
   For even while Lancelot spoke the outcome had grown very plain and
inevitable in the sight of Vortimer; and he desired at least the
semblance of holding first place in act, speech, and will, as to his own
procedure. But he felt below it the scorch of defeat, and saw the
derisive curl of Lancelot's lip at his boasting. It drove him on to say
more. Quoth he,--  
   "Also there is more to tell him concerning unfaithfulness--a worse
treason, Sir Lancelot, than that of breaking bounds to aid a beleaguered
city. Nor should you twist and tangle your face-lines in that fashion;
for truly it might be no more than kindness to bring the wrath of the
Emperor on your head, if in so doing I might leave free to you" he
paused--"a cast-off Guinevere."  
   The writhing of countenance that he mocked at had been real; and
Vortimer, following with bitter delight the passion of shame and pain
which caused it, grew more deadly hateful with every word. The two great
men fronted each other, feeding their fury in eye flashes given and
taken, until at that fatal  
  
Page 266  
  
name they clashed wildly together, blade on shield, and blow for blow;
all thoughts of policy, of clemency, of submission were quite blown
away; each made for the other's life, with little heed to his own.
Forthwith all their followers near joined the combat, eddying round them
as they fought.  
   The odds were heavy against Lancelot's party, yet not so crushing as
might seem, for these were picked of the pick of their kind, better
swordsmen nowhere, and they knew the overwhelming aid that was coming;
whereas only a very few of Vortimer's men were death-blind in his
behalf, and they had nothing else to be their stay. Notwithstanding,
every man of the former felt cut and thrust, not once only, through his
mail; and their helms were ringing, and their forms reeling about the
two infuriated champions, before relief came.  
   Yet this was speedy. The sight of that straining tangle and vehemence
of men and arms, the sound of that smithy-like hammering, were in eyes
and ears not over pleased with the venture of their chief; and at once,
with a great cry, the whole curve of men swept inward, closing the
circle, and crushing into submission that human chaos. The uplifted
voice of Lancelot alone saved from trampling even him, their leader.
When the storm cleared they found him afoot, between his dead horse and
Vortimer, both equally bloody and unlifelike. His  
  
Page 267  
  
own person showed gashes in trunk and limb, and his garments were no
longer things of beauty; but he had regained his old jauntily defiant,
gracefully complacent air.  
   "The end would have come sooner," said he, "but that I let the clumsy
fellow make me clumsier still with wrath at his nonsense, till I got my
skill of hand again, and laid open his crown. Look to him, some of you,
and to the rest."  
   But his eye had in it no great anxiety for Vortimer's revival; and as
he glanced around him he was asking inwardly how many who had heard the
first offence were beyond all telling, or certain to forget. Yet at
least the combined forces were his own now, a goodly array to bring back
northward; and that it might grow rather than lessen, he sent out after
all scatterers, even before having his wounds dressed.  
   While undergoing this he had news of Vortimer, which did not wholly
please him. "Mending, is he?" quoth the dark and wilful prince. "It may
not mend his comfort or his chances greatly. Bring him in."  
   When Vortimer entered, Lancelot was smiling; but the contrast between
the men and between their conditions made that smile satanic. Vortimer
felt it so, scarce able as he was to hold himself erect for weakness,
roughly bandaged on head and arm and thigh, blood-dabbled and
mire-stained everywhere, tattered as any hedge-side beggar; while before
him  
  
Page 268  
  
sat at ease this greater sinner, already seemingly restored in every
way, the wine creaming to his hand, a picture of embodied luxury and
insolent leisure.  
   Lancelot nodded indifferently, and waved his attendants from the
room. Then his eyes fastened on his huge prey.  
   "Our little set-to had its inconveniences," he said. "But there were
counterbalancing benefits. Of all who heard a lady's name handled
indiscreetly,--a very throat-cutting thing,--only two or three are
alive, beside you and me. I will answer for the others, and I think we
are not likely to speak."  
   There was an emphasis on the "we," which checked Vortimer's denial.
The orator, for once, and very uneasily, hearkened only.  
   Lancelot went on: "Such speech, but once again, may bring to you the
blade that burns. You are going where declamation will not avail; but,
even there, let that name pass your lips, and I shall know, and you
shall feel. If you say that you have seen too much, you shall see
nothing more."  
   Vortimer had listened helplessly, with growing vehemence of desire to
offer some defiance, some reply. At the last he straightened himself,
but wilted to the ground before a word was spoken, like some tall reed
cut at the root, softening under the hot sun.  
   At Lancelot's call, men came and bore him away.  
  
Page 269  
  
When first able to travel, he went westward, where a Welsh castle
received him. For long he was not seen. Such report was sent to Arthur
as made this unavoidable. Nor, in his life-and-death struggle with the
Saxon, could he scan it over closely. But Vortimer was yet dear to many
in London. Condoning his faults, they remembered his voice, his bearing,
his championship.  
   Lancelot hardly fared the better. A stir of shame awakened at the
sudden weakness of a strong enemy, and at himself, who had not long
before been unevenly generous,--a half-startled recognition of some new
growth within, for he had never yet been cruel. At times, for a moment,
he seemed to look down a distorted vista, futile in its flashes of good,
hateful, more and more, in its perverse darkening of evil. In one burst
of desperate thought, he dreamed of renouncing all for the cowl and
cell. And again, the wish burst from him that the thrust of Vortimer had
been more straight and strong. Even the hope of seeing Guinevere was
poisoned for him, though he longed feverishly. Only in the thought of
combat was there any respite. Therefore he took no heed to his wounds
nor any counsel concerning them, but hurried on.  
   All his men were now with him in heart and will, those foremost in
revolt being over eager to atone, lest harm should come of it.  
  
Page 270  
  
   Passing the walls of Legiolum, for there was no time now to tarry,
Lancelot had one fair sight of Guinevere, leaning forth sunlike in the
sunset. She waved her scarf abroad for a token, and he tossed hand and
helmet-plume, riding swiftly on.

CHAPTER XXVIII.  
  
THE NIGHT BATTLE OF THE GREAT WOOD.  
  
A gloomy disaster befell their army.                         
Thou slayest them with blades without much noise.  
Thou powerful pillar of living light causest stillness    
                          --ANEURIN.

  
ARTHUR in his day had dealt with more formidable enemies; but Ossa
Cyllalaur foiled his stroke, so far that it brought no instant ruin.
Awakening to the danger of his long thin line, the Saxon king hurried
all whom he could to the front, which was then fighting Caradoc.  
   The night closed on them, growing in mass, a multitude of hardy
footmen, as they picked up one body after another by the way. No
stragglers, for such could find no safety. The first of the breathless
mass were clasping hands with those who confronted the Prince of Devon,
when the British Emperor came down on them from the height near their
rear, striking crosswise, but with a great body of enemies before him,
where he had looked to find them yet loosely strung.  
   Ossa Cyllalaur was there, too, guessing the danger place, and with
him the best of the Saxon spears,  
  
Page 272  
  
quickly bristling before the rush of the British horse, like an
ill-formed bayonet square of later days. In splintering charge after
charge, Arthur broke into them, once cutting through from side to side,
and back again. Thus all their moving line was assailed with brief
pauses; and Arthur's infantry, coming up, joined likewise. Therefore
there were many kinds of desperate fighting, over much space, through
many impediments, in such darkness that a man might hardly know friend
from enemy.  
   Still the Saxon army grew mainly toward the head; and there the worst
rush of all came on Caradoc, swarming up against and around his
breastwork, and over it in places for all that he could do. The utmost
aid that Arthur could send was too little, making only for a time an
islet of fighting-men among numerous and desperate assailants.  
   Then a great and welcome shout was heard in the night beyond, and
when it rose a second time every hard-pressed Briton well knew it for
the mountain cry of Lancelot. The sound of battle had reached his men,
awakening their eager gladness. The Saxons heard that shout also, and
paused for one heartbeat; then fell to more savagely, as knowing their
time was brief. Even the champion of the brawny arm was driven hither
and thither, reeling while he smote,--his men meanwhile dropping
continually all around,--before the onfall of Caowl from one side  
  
Page 273  
  
and Lancelot from the other broke through to him with salvation.  
   Then the fight here went on confusedly for a time; but the sudden
strengthening of the Britons prevailed, and the current turned, setting
slantwise; for the Saxons were driven, resisting doggedly, through the
westward opening, where was now only Dynan, with a small force, to stay
them. These gave way, and the Saxons all drew together on high ground in
a strong place; where they fought so sturdily that Arthur, having torn
what he could from them as they went, found it wise to form a circle
round them, and await the day.  
   This showed the great havoc of that night, and that it had visited
most heavily the Saxons. Caradoc, strongly posted, had given good
account of them, even while brought near to destruction; and their flank
and rear had been handled mercilessly. Therefore many corpses were in
all the undergrowth.  
   Nevertheless, a great body of Saxons remained, holding well together
on a table of open land above the meeting of two streams. Rocks were
plentiful here; and many stones had been heaped between them in a rude
encircling wall that still grew, the banner of Ossa Cyllalaur being in
the centre. There seemed a spring near it, and a few pack animals were
standing around. Also there were fires, and  
  
Page 274  
  
men breakfasting, and glittering arms in great plenty.  
   "A good fort," said Lancelot. "But I do not see that they are making
headway into Britain. They are less now than we. And I should suppose,
in time, they would grow hungry."  
   He sat, mounted, with the Emperor and other chiefs, on a second
eminence. Looking abroad over their own cordon, Arthur smiled.  
   "They are indeed delivered over to us," he said. "This time let us
make sure work. Cut down trees everywhere, that the wall of oak may
surround the wall of stone, Famine will drive them to us."  
   It was done very swiftly, for battle-axes and other fit tools were
abundant. On every side the strokes and heavy crashing echoed through
the wilderness.  
   Hearing such ominous uproar, the busy Saxons were seen to pause with
an air of uncertain menace. But their night-slaughter was too recent for
any venture. So they turned to their labor again with a cry of derision,
and those who had been eating joined them; whereby their wall grew
apace, taking the light sparklingly on many crystalline facets. Thus
until noon continued the two armies of wall-builders. Then, with
shifting of workmen, the Britons kept on still; but the Saxons
flauntingly sat down to food  
  
Page 275  
  
and mead,--all they had,--devouring and quaffing, so that this their
last meal on earth was in truth a lavish banquet.  
   Arthur, on the neighboring hill, faring less sumptuously, watched
them in silence, his chiefs around him. Their blood, like his own, had
cooled in the hours of rest and toil. Looking from eye to eye, he found
them faintly astir with fellow-feeling for these roisterers, who showed
a temper so like their own. At that he smiled.  
   "Let us give them another chance," he said; then called for a tablet,
and wrote a courteous summons to surrender: "For where you could not
pass in the night when all was open," he said, "you surely cannot pass
over walls in the day. Nor would it be easier to return, unless by
giving us ample pledges and hostages; whereon you may go and welcome. It
were best for all if there might henceforth be amity between us."  
   He sent this by the chief man among the wounded prisoners; and ten
more of those who could walk went with this messenger. No Saxon, unhurt,
had been taken arms in hand; but Arthur had caused search to be made for
all who lay around, and gentlest care to be given them. This also the
men who bore his letter could tell Ossa Cyllalaur, and those who stood
with him, for the easing of any doubts and fears.  
  
Page 276  
  
   Both armies watched the little procession pass haltingly from wall to
wall, across the belt of open land. Ossa welcomed them, and took their
missive, calling one who had the skill to read it. Then there was a stir
and hum of admiration, followed by some debate. In the end one of the
prisoners came back with the word. "Ossa Cyllalaur, King of Bernicia,
Overlord of Deira, bids me say for him that he accepts nothing from an
enemy; that a mishap in the dark may be repaired when men can see; that
Saxons have little need of food of their own when there are so many
Britons with food around them. With thanks to Arthur, who is a wise,
brave, and great-hearted soldier, expect Ossa very speedily; for the
wolf grows weary of his den."  
   For now one of Constantine's pack-trains came into plainer sight
between the bare trees; and almost before that answer was rendered, the
Saxon fighting-men were swarming over their wall on every side at once.
Everywhere, too, it was in such fierce fashion that feint could not at
first be told from onslaught by any one. But opposite the train a great
body, converging in a wedge, made a desperate and long-continued
endeavor, wherein most of the others joined them; the foremost hacking
at the sharpened branches, or even wrenching their way upward far enough
to be speared or cloven, for there was not one who got quite over the
wall. Arrows,  
  
Page 277  
  
darts, and stones came grievously among them; and though they did not
give way after a single trial and failure, they could render slight
return, and in the end went back again very loweringly. There was quick
pursuit, and fighting the open ground on even terms; but this venture
ended without the Saxons having won anything. Again their loss in men
was the heavier.  
   At sunset, after one or two passing alarums, there was a great
irruption of them toward the point made by the meeting of the waters,
suddenly swollen by rain in the upper hills or by melting snow. Here the
tree-barrier had made a dam, leaving waterway under it for no more than
the common flow. With the sudden rise, the pressure on it grew; and
though more trees were felled and braces set, the flood and the enemy
came tugging at it together. Presently Ossa Cyllalaur was through,
between tumbling and swimming, with two hundred and more of his men.
Their blades made havoc for a moment, then sought the depths of the
wood, while no others followed. Caradoc, posted near, had hurried, with
the men of Devon, crosswise to shield the gap; and though the emptying
water still rushed plentifully by, these took care that there should not
be any Saxons in it. As the Britons gathered momently, the mass of
assailants, leaderless and undecided, went slowly back to their
rock-wall again. Meantime Llywarch and a  
  
Page 278  
  
party of horse, overrunning and passing those who had escaped, made
search for them in the forest twilight, which was nearly night already,
at random, but heading mainly toward Argoed.  
   Thus the second day of fighting ended.

CHAPTER XXIX.  
  
THE BLOWING OF THE ELFIN HORN.  
  
The Elfin knight sits on the hill,                 
              Ba, ba, ba, lilli, ba.  
He blows his horn both loud and shrill--  
             The wind has blown my plaid awa.  
                          -- *Old Ballad.*

  
THUS far Dynan's task had been light, though his heart grew hourly
heavier. As yet no great effort of the enemy had been directed his
way,--the western side. But he had no hope that he should escape what
was coming.  
   At midnight a tongue of fire leaped up tree-top high on the line
between him and Argoed. The Saxons of the rock-fort saw it, and cried,
"The Torch of Cyllalaur," as they burst out in full strength after this
far-summoning leader. Llywarch, remote in the wilderness, also took it
for his guide. But no other was stirred to such swiftness as Dynan.
Calling his nearest men, he sprang on the horse ready-saddled beside
him, and rode madly for the enemy who thus held the path to the lady of
his hopeless love. Away behind he heard the sounds of onset, but not now
could he turn to them.  
  
Page 280  
  
   Before very long the burning tree died down, but there were sparks
and flickers enough to show him the way; and soon the moon came out,
spreading a good light in many places before him. Even under the trees
he could see dimly. In that half-light of haze and shadow he came
suddenly on a massing and stir of figures about the border of a glade,
and saw the breath of the wind awaken the last beacon-embers above them.
He skirted these men hastily, and kept on.  
   There was a hubbub of indecision, and one or two spears were thrown;
but the way lay open before him, with all his enemies behind. When very
sure of this, he drew rein, and his horse nearly sank under him.  
   It was a barren pass where he halted, with an upward slant between
two hills, the one of rounding contour, in a billowy garment of low
shrubbery; the other an abrupt, all but overhanging, rocky mass, with
distorted, out-thrusting boughs and uncanny roots, twisted and
down-reaching. A little above him, where the way widened, a low yew-tree
divided it, over-shading the leaden glint of a spring, with yet more
uncertain outlines behind. It needed only a breath of air or a shifting
of moonbeams to set all astir.  
   To Dynan's fancy, life was everywhere about him now, though whether
friendly or hateful he could not say. There could be no question as to
the hurried  
  
Page 281  
  
voices and clanking which he heard far down the glen. They would be too
many for him he doubted; and what aid but from one--who would surely
come at the magic summons, with her own price for salvation,--the price
of the downward way. Over his soul crept the sense of a chill, unhuman
tricksomeness and terror--all the uncertain attributes haunting the
shadow of a hapless and vanished race.  
   "Not yet!" he cried aloud. "Not with the sun of Argoed in my veins
and the life of the race of man! Not for any need or torment of my own.
But Freur!--to save Freur!--if all else fails; it is the path to Freur I
am guarding."  
   Now the sounds were near, and others, greater, arose far behind. He
judged that a few of the fleetest were sent after him, while Ossa fell
on the rear of the oaken wall where the first Saxons were cutting
through it. There his post had been, deserted now, as never before since
he first learned duty. He set his face bitterly at the thought.  
   The moon tipped something that moved a little below him, and he
wheeled back under the tree. There were calls, as though he had been
seen or heard, and then a quick scrambling up the slope. He could see
them now, a panting horse, the rider, and two footmen, well blown,
dragging by the thighs of him.  
At once he darted on them out of the gloom,  
  
Page 282  
  
spearing the horse in the nostrils, so that he reared and reeled over,
dashing two of the party headlong, while the lance-point, deftly
shifting, caught the other runner quite full in front, piercing to the
spine. It was plucked out again, but not soon enough to reach the other
two, who were tumbling back to their comrades, very much shaken. The
horse was there before them. The fairy's son vanished under the yew. The
slain Saxon lay all alone in the road.  
   Dynan heard the muttering of consultation below; and they mounted
again, in greater number this time, on foot, two by two. As the foremost
pair reached the corpse, the taller of them cursed audibly, but broke
his curse midway at sight of the ambushed figure. "A demon!" he cried;
and with the word the darted weapon took him, and horse and man leaped
out after it together as he fell. The man beside him wounded Dynan's
horse, but went down under a sword-cut; and the cry of the dead man, "A
demon, a demon!" echoing from lip to lip, far more bore back those who
followed than did his charge. Presently they were fleeing down the road,
with Dynan right upon them, so that he would have slain another or more
than one but that his horse fell. Therefore he went back regretfully and
listened.  
   He could hear now the sound, not far away, of metal stricken
together, and angry cries, which in that age alone gave notice of
combat. He knew that the Sax-  
  
Page 283  
  
ons must have at last cut an outlet, and that a good part, at least, of
Arthur's army, beyond question, had swept round on one or both sides to
assail them. Yet in, spite of all, they were coming his way, the way to
Argoed.  
   In no long time the first of this fugitive army overtook those who
had attacked him, and halted in perturbation, wild to go on, since
Arthur, with Lancelot and Caradoc, were behind them, yet by no means in
love with any wood demon either. By the growing sound of their voices he
could tell how they gathered, until at last, when some of tougher fibre
came up, there was a strong movement toward him. They came rapidly, if
not with perfect steadiness, filling the whole pass; a great clamor of
fighting, not far behind, urging them on. Then he held the horn very
tightly in his left hand, ready for instant use, and with the other
flashed out his sword, leaping before them with a keen, quavering cry,
like no human fighting sound that ever was heard. It made them swerve
and eddy a little; and before they could settle again, the fairy's son
was flitting miraculously before, about, and among them, leaving one
blinded by the gash along his brow, another sinking on his knee with
severed tendons,--a lithe little fury of attack, exceeding even himself
in his own bewildering strategy. Three men had fallen, and more were
bleeding, and the line had been kept  
  
Page 284  
  
stationary a minute or more, in spite of the upward crowding, before the
Saxons were well aware that the wild cat who thus clawed the front of
their array was quite alone and human after all. Then a roar went up of
mingled amusement, admiration, anger, and mutual derision; and they
closed upon him in a semicircle, wild with the great need to clear the
way.  
   Feeling his doom very near, Dynan sprang about and darted back in a
frenzy, keeping his enemies as nearly as he might before him, dodging
and dealing blows, and sometimes taking them, until the blood spurted, a
human fox in the very jaws of the hounds. He felt, rather than saw, the
yew-tree over him. He felt his foot plash and slip in the runnel from
the spring. He saw a medley of weapons and faces thronging up almost
against his own on every side. With one swing of his blade to keep them
off a second, he clapped the elfin horn to his mouth, and blew. So
strange was the sound, so ear-splitting and jangling, so cavernous in
the echo, that the assailants drew breath and shrank, looking about
them. He staggered back against the trunk, murmured weakly, "For Freur!"
and blew again.  
   Then, whether it were echo, or wound-disordered fancy, or the call of
human allies thronging to him in his need, or something verily more
dread to all, there did certainly seem to come from cliff and hill  
  
Page 285  
  
and hollow fountain-depth and the waste of pallid, moonlit air a
multitudinous answer. All nature was full of it and of stormy figures
hurrying to the onset. His eyes closed weakly, but he seemed to hear the
crash of unearthly havoc and yells of Saxon dismay. As he lifted his
eyelids again, he saw, or thought he saw, a figure, as of the haze,
waving the assailants on. She turned her face toward him, and he passed
into the swoon of one drained of blood. Then, in trance, he felt
uplifted bodily, and borne far away. Hope, choice, even wish, had wholly
left him. Yet he seemed to know that he was journeying to the hollow
land of his forsaken and haunting race. The arms of the dread lady of
his dream were around him.  
   When Llywarch and his belated horsemen broke in through the upper end
of the pass, they saw wild figures in tumultuous movement, and heard the
sounds of fight and flight before them, which they could not by any
diligence overtake. In after fancy, they seemed to have ridden behind a
whirlwind of spectral violence.  
  
Page 286  
  

CHAPTER XXX.  
  
THE DEATH OF AN ARMY.

  
  
WHEN Arthur and his men saw that revulsion of panic take their enemies
at the blowing of the elfin horn, they too were aware--or later so
deemed themselves--of something appalling and unearthly. But they made
no stint of fighting, indeed, fought all the harder, for some had raised
the cry, "The hosts of heaven are coming to our aid!" Even the Emperor
echoed it, this interpretation being most in agreement with his hopes
and his will. It seemed that the Saxons were to be reaped from the earth
all at once where they hovered, weakened and shaken.  
   But in a moment there came on them that strength of paroxysm which
drives men against anything, with the sense of horrors behind. Against
that even the victorious Britons could not stand. They slew many, took
and wounded many; but at two points the Saxons broke through them. Ossa
Cyllalaur, with a desperate few who clung to him, cut a passage
northward, and, in the end, after many hardships and losses, gained his
capital. The greater number went  
  
Page 287  
  
back, by the way they lately had taken, through the breach in the
British wall. Behind their own rugged stone shelter they turned again,
savage in despair. After one unsuccessful assault, their enemies
withdrew, and waited. Now and then the environing soldiery jeered, and
sent arrow-flights, but nothing more.  
   As for the Saxons, they mostly kept silence, looking at each other
with deep eyes; and many lay down, leaden in their weariness, until
slumber took them. Yet keen hunger awoke with them at the dawn.  
   Whatever in any way might be made to pass for food was eagerly hunted
for. Yet there was little to choose between those who ate nothing, and
those who wearied their jaws on foul leather, or devoured scraps. The
strain of fighting had brought this need swiftly and direly on them.
Beside, not a few had lost blood, and needed replenishing. Sore and
grim, they looked over the wall, exposing themselves indifferently, or
doubled themselves behind it in the temper and aspect of wild beasts.
Only here and there one preserved the nobler air of a brave man under
the great shadow.  
   Of these, a harper, after a time, picked up his instrument where he
had thrown it in that last night-sally, and drew his hand, through
habit, idly over the strings. Chance, or some soul-movement, wakened
hopeful notes, and a faint light came into the dull  
  
Page 288  
  
eyes about him. So--hearers, minstrel, and harp all inciting one
another--the sounds grew into a continued strain, which leaped out
inspiringly.  
   "Why have done with hope?" he sang. "Hope hath but fled with Ossa,
hath wed Ossa Cyllalaur; and full surely and swiftly will they come
again to us together. Why, O men of the North and of the sea, why, O men
of the fight and of the storm-wind, have ye grown all at once so
child-weak in patience, so unenduring? Was it not said of old that the
one food needed by the Saxon is the sight of his enemy's destruction? Is
it much to wait a day longer with such a banquet in store? For I tell
you that their mighty walls shall be broken, and the weapons of them
shall be whirled away like dead leaves through the forest. Then what can
save from you their goodly cities, fairer than any dream. Wherefore
patience a little while; yet patience."  
   Listening, they believed with fevered exaltation; a deadly faith for
them, since at that moment came one more message of pity and peace, a
Briton bearing it. Him these frenzied men seized with mocking answers,
and one, wild with famine and many hurts, cut him down. A great cry went
up from the British circle, then ceased again as suddenly. There was no
further sound, nor any motion. The Saxons looked around, and knew what
they had done; and the world drew blank to them.  
  
Page 289  
  
   Their minds went over the long distance between them and York, the
city drained of her strength, dead or dying there. Over empty lands it
went, from which no new forces might quickly spring, and back into that
tangled wilderness where their chief, if yet alive, was doubtless then
striving to force his way. Very desolately it was borne in on them that
he would never come.  
   By noon they were most hopeless, famine-stricken wretches. Through
hour after hour following, they said to each other by word and eye,
"This must have an end." Toward sundown one cried, "Better now, while we
have yet strength to cut our mark on them." At once three or four
thousand of the strongest climbed the wall on the northward side, making
for their enemy in a leaderless, ravening mass. That charge held, though
many fell by the way with arrows in them, and there was hard fighting
over the British barricade. But the besiegers were too plentiful, and
gathered more and more at the threatened point from every quarter,
pushing them farther from the wall in throbs and throes of combat, step
by step, quite to their own enclosure. And now all were closely pent
there except the dead, while their enemies were up against it on every
side.  
   Seeing their desperate plight, Arthur called aloud one more offer of
mercy, to all except him who had  
  
Page 290  
  
slain the message-bearer. But they were beside themselves, and answered
only with a jeer.  
   "End it, then," he commanded; "end it, since they will have no
less."  
   But this was not easily done, even yet. They were still many and
well-weaponed, and every way formidable in their famished hate. For a
time, fast as men mounted the wall they were hurled back again, or
dragged inward, or speared, or cut; or rolled, grappling, with some
stabbing enemy. Yet the assault was nearly continuous everywhere, Saxons
and Britons being well packed together, with only the slippery and
crumbling mass of stones between. Lancelot and Caradoc were the first
over it who made good their footing within. Slowly a few more joined
them; but they scarce gained ground at all, and had to fight for life as
well as victory. Half an hour later a mighty swell of attack lifted
Arthur, with Llywarch and Caowl and some hundreds more, a little farther
inward from the opposite point of the circle. There was desperate effort
to dislodge these; and when it failed, the Saxons threw up some sort of
crude barrier before them with whatever came in their way, and fought
over it. Before the sun left the tree-boughs, the doomed men were
panting within less than one-fourth of their stone-encircled camp. The
glinting yellow rays between the trunks lighted the last knot of
haggard, angry faces and  
  
Page 291  
  
whirling arms, driven literally to the wall and to death.  
   After that there were great shoutings of triumph; but the victors,
with their dead and wounded, drew away to a less ghastly place. Then
silence and the night fell together; the one suddenly, but not unbroken,
the other by slow degrees. And men hushed their breath for ages
afterward at thought of the slain Saxon army in that haunted forest of
Celidon.

CHAPTER XXXI.  
  
THE TOKEN OF OISIN AND THE MARCH TO LONDON.  
  
Arthur bore the image of the holy Virgin, Mother of God.  
                          --NENNIUS.

  
ARTHUR, mindful of London's danger, and its people's aid in that great
wood-fight, left himself no rest in hastening thither. Guinevere had but
one loving hour with him at Legiolum, although using her most
enthralling wiles, in jealous fear of that stately queen for whom such
prowess was to be expended. She could not even take heart at the thought
of Lancelot coming; for he too, though yet sore with wounds, held
southward, seeking new battles. Caradoc, who had fared very ill in that
slaughter, was to rest there, and to rule. But a halting and growling
uncle, though soon to mend, was not the guardian most eagerly to be
chosen by the luxuriant Guinevere. She pitied herself many times before
it was held quite safe for her to take the southward way.  
   Arthur's great army was gazed on breathlessly, as it went, for such
awful destruction had not been heard of in living memory. The loss was
plain, many ranks being thinned wofully, and the marks of bat-  
  
Page 293  
  
tle showed everywhere; but all looked on them as men predestined to
conquer. They followed their rapid leader as with wings, Constantine,
anxious for Aurelia, doing his best thrice over in smoothing all
difficulties away.  
   London-town still held out, but nearly all other news was ill.
Scarcely anything stirred Arthur so bitterly as the storming of the
lake-village, the death of Osburn in a futile effort to save it, and the
total vanishing of its enthusiastic pastor. Yet none gave him up for
lost altogether; for a man with good marsh guidance might lie hidden a
long time thereabout, beyond all finding by Saxons.  
   So in truth it proved; for news of the Emperor's march in some way
brought him forth, carried by four men on a litter, with the stain and
rankness of the swamp still on him. Thinner and more bird-like he was
than ever, with fingers withered and shrunken to mere talons,
fever-flushed in the face and fever-shaken, his breath coming at first
in gasps of thankfulness for free air, his eyes deepening intensely.  
   He bade the bearers put him down at the place of first meeting an
officer of that army. "It is for Arthur Mabuter to come hither," said
he. "A greater Monarch, by me, his voice among the men of Britain, soon
returning to that heavenly sender, summons him, awaits him." His voice
was preternaturally calm, and his eyes gazed into the  
  
Page 294  
  
blue above him as if for vision of his home soon to be.  
   The victor of Celidon heard, and came still more rapidly. This
triumph had bred in him an exaltation in unison with that of this
martyred enthusiast. Formerly Oisin had seemed to him a pathetic figure,
admirable in some ways, yet extravagant, ungovernable, dangerous. Now he
was prepared to humble himself, and take the dying man's words as indeed
a message from on high. The measured utterance of the sufferer affected
him like a shock.  
   "We are bidden to number our days," began Oisin. "Minutes are days
for me now, and I have numbered them; also my words, fitting each to
each. Be silent all; there is not one to spare.  
   "Arthur, Emperor of Britain, this is my burden to you from the Most
High: 'Tear thou the head of Vran from the White Hill of his
enchantment.'  
   "And this is the reason thereof: he hath put palsy into British
veins. He hath poisoned the cause of Christ with his necromancy. He hath
given over London-town to the curse of selfishness, while the ravagers
were all abroad in the outer lands.  
   "They came against us once, twice, three times, and yet a fourth; and
while we fought, we called on God and man for aid. At first Cian came
against them, and then Osburn, and then both together; but each time
those were fewer who would follow;  
  
Page 295  
  
and at the fourth, Osburn went down under many Saxons. Then, for all
that we could do, the people of God were slain, old and young together,
in their homes and about their altar, unmercifully; so that only a few
escaped with me into the outer noisomeness, where we have dwelt until
now like foul spirits of the waste. Yet even there have we heard the cry
go up to Vran and the gods of Vran, from the White Hill of Cynvelyn,
exulting.  
   "I adjure you, Arthur Mabuter, as you value salvation, make no
compact, no truce, with the works of darkness. For the Christian soldier
there is only the cross of his suffering Redeemer and the holy
countenance of the Mother of God, not the buried and evil-luminous head
of old wickedness."  
   Arthur bowed his head profoundly, saying, "Even so, Oisin." There was
great pity in his eyes, but something hotter and darker behind it.  
   Oisin lay back easy of mind. He said no more, only once to ask for
water; and once he made motion toward his breast. There, moving the
mantle, was found a cameo of clear creamy stone, hanging locket-wise,
the pure face of Mary, Christ's mother. When Arthur took this
reverently, the dying man smiled, and pointed to the shield he bore.
Arthur gave promise by word and sign that it should be set there,
guarding and guarded. The dying man was still again until the last spasm
took him. Thus  
  
Page 296  
  
passed Oisin the evangelist into the light or the shadow.  
   The token was indeed a marvellous thing, nor could any one tell the
land or time wherein it was made. Arthur, all the more for this mystery,
held it high above aught else that God or man had given him. So the best
of his armorers and cunning workers in precious things were called, and
given charge to set it in the central boss of the shield, with a bright
encircling wreath, jewelled and golden. Swiftly they wrought, with his
more than human eagerness ever beside them, waiting while some part of
the army went by. At the last sunset of their march, Arthur the Emperor,
with glad, solemn eyes, held it tilted into the wonder and richness of
that glory, and said, "It is well."  
   After all had supped and rested a while, he sent his word abroad and
took the lead; and the whole army, wakening limb by limb from its ease,
came after him, at first sluggishly, then vehemently, with a great hum,
passing quickly into silence. A long night-speeding it was; the footmen
striding after the horses, and well nigh keeping pace mile for mile, a
dim, multitudinous tossing of spears and javelins and armor-gleams, with
a world of doubtful features and forms under the half-clouded
starlight.  
   Silently as they went, some whisper, like the leaves in the
night-wind, kept on before, so that all the  
  
Page 297  
  
phantom-like enemies between them and the north wall of the city drew
away. When Eschwine, from the banks of the Lea near its mouth, looked
northward toward the Hampstead hills, it was not the presence of armed
enemies that widened his eyes, but rather their multitude, which was
like a miracle, to have appeared so soon. Among them he could see well
the spoil of the Cyllalaur and his Saxons,--mail and standards and
weapons of cunning ornament. Well before the array, from among the ruins
of the villa of Constantine, floated the dragon banner of the great
Arthur, imperial token of supremacy throughout Britain.  
   Then he smiled very grimly, hiding discomfiture, and bade his men to
the river and beyond, where were the Kent-folk armaments on the
Southwark marshes and fields. There being boats in plenty, all were over
before harm came of their severance. Truly when the Saxons were thus
together the host of them at second view was not less but even greater
(being infantry standing close) than that of their enemy.
Notwithstanding, they had no longer any hope of London for a prey.  
   Some quaint humor moved Eschwine to send that morning an embassy to
Arthur, in solemn form, with many titles and compliments, desiring that
he would withdraw his goodly display of riders from that useful
battlefield between the armies of Kent and Essex  
  
Page 298  
  
and London, it being a contention which in no way concerned the other
island peoples.  
   Arthur heard as one who hears not; then made answer, "Tell your king,
Eschwine, and his confederates, that I will have no treaty with them nor
any manner of parley. Tell him that he is forsworn; that he has
forfeited both life and soul. Tell him I would I could smite the one, as
I verily, and that soon, shall smite out of existence the other."  
   He bade them be entertained and restored to their own people. His
army spread itself over all the land as far as the riverside, while he
rode in through the Ermine gate, with his imperial guard of thrice three
hundred champions, the best legion of infantry following spear in
hand.

CHAPTER XXXII.  
  
BROUGHT TO THE LIGHT.  
  
Arthur discovered the head, for it was a frivolous thing with him to
defend the kingdom by any other power than his own.  
                                       --NOTE TO GUNN's *Nennius* .

  
THE siege of London, though not very long, had tried the defenders
sorely. Even before the storming of the lake village, most of the open
country had been swept. Yet there could be no general destruction of
life. The invaders trampled empty fields and fired empty houses. But by
day the huddled watchers within the walls watched the smoke roll up
where their homes had been, and the lights were lighted very
distressfully.  
   Again and again Cian had striven to put heart into his people, and
lead them in some effort to stay this ravage. But except the several
efforts in behalf of the lake village, and one long sally of foresters
to a stronghold up the river, whence they were glad enough to get back
again, scarce a man could be brought beyond the limit set by Vran. When
the villa of Constantine was fired, Aurelia herself royally forbade the
dashing forth of any mere handful,  
  
Page 300  
  
such as Cian could have taken, to fight for her home.  
   Twice near the wall he made some play with his chariots; but much of
that ground was always marshy, and the rains and thaws and sharp frosts
were all equally bad for them. On the roads and some smooth places he
could indeed yet do service; but these were easily obstructed, and
nothing great came of it. All in all, this plain truth remained on the
side of Vran, that the walls held, throwing off every assault; and
whatever was done without the walls came to no very good ending.  
   Yet once, at least, there was exceeding danger. While Cian's
attention was taken by a determined threatening along the northern wall,
a strong party of the enemy swarmed over an ill-watched point near the
eastern abutment on the Thames, and others followed, so that a good many
Saxons were fairly within the city. But it so chanced that a great
concourse of Druidic devotees had just betaken themselves to the White
Hill, and at the first alarm descended right eagerly, their priests now
clad in full pagan attire, and wild chants of adoration on every lip.
Nothing could withstand them now, for in the very depth of their hearts
they deemed they knew. The first Saxon success was a real Saxon undoing.
Imbedded in a hostile city, assailed in this preterhuman spirit of
shrill hate, not one of them ever left the  
  
Page 301  
  
houses and streets alive. Cian's legions, hurrying across from the
northern boundary, found the work already done to their hand.  
   It was hard for any one not to have some faith in the power that won
for them. Aurelia felt it; so, still more, did Cian, growing day by day.
In his case were there not also lifelong habit and brooding, the fame
that pledged him, the mystery that lured--more than all, the memory of
his fight for the golden vest in the luminous hidden crypt, and the
living fire that had so lately burned on him, accompanied by that awful
voice out of the hollow hill? Thus the defenders were exceedingly ready
for that especial work; and when, three days later, a wave-head of
Saxons came fairly over the western wall, the intruders were crushed
between two masses, each a thousand mailed men closing like jaws, and
died there speedily. No other entrances were made, though there were
many partial onsets. Even the great battering-ram failed, for slings and
arrows and javelins made havoc among those who swung it; and the gate
against which it had been trained flew open unexpectedly to let out a
throng of destroyers. Therefore it was not used again.  
   There were many lesser endeavors and stratagems of the enemy,
compelling very close watchfulness, but without other result in any
case. Toward the last it seemed that they might soon look for an onfall
of  
  
Page 302  
  
the whole Saxon host, and how this might have fared none could know. But
the people for the most part were high-hearted in their dread reliance;
and Arthur found this feeling at the full, confronting his own
abhorrence. Nevertheless, they gladly welcomed the bright show he made,
and the strength he brought. They were not famished as yet, but only
straitened enough to do double honor to the feast set forth by the
imperial largess and the providence of Constantine.  
   Even at this banquet there was some frowning over the downfall of
Vortimer, and other tales that were told. It seemed hard that such ruin
should have fallen on mere generous disorder. But they gloried
abundantly in the astounding achievement of Celidon. Aloud they cried,
"Like death was his spear, killing his enemy." Nevertheless, the sight
of the Emperor's shield, and the known charge laid on him by Oisin
before death, stirred in them alarm, even the menacing of horror.  
   Arthur himself was not wholly unchanged. His demeanor, though
gracious ever since his entry, held something in reserve. His appalling
success in the wilderness battle--so like the descending hand of death,
and following many victories--had made his natural self-confidence grow
toward a sense of supreme power and undoubted right. A perilous
arrogance lurked in this, which yet was not know-  
  
Page 303  
  
ingly self-seeking. All protest of inner sympathy had been barred by the
superhuman cogency of the injunction laid on him and the hard uplifting
of his mission.  
   He heard that evening from the queen and Cian the full narrative of
the siege, glooming over every allusion to Vran, but saying nothing
until all else had been uttered. Then to Aurelia,--  
   "I have somewhat to tell your people," he said, "which concerns them
all. If it please you, let the notables, at least, meet us in council
two hours hence. Till then I will rest."  
   When he had left them, Cian looked at Aurelia, saying, "Our Emperor
is the greatest man alive; but I would that Vran had put himself on the
side of more generous fighting, or that Arthur were not so stern and
fervent in his faith."  
   Aurelia returned his look, smiling gravely.  
   "True," she answered, "yet other zeal may not be more wise. I would
that faiths might not clash; but let each freely have his own, or so
many as may please him."  
   Cian shook his head. "That will not suffice for Arthur."--  
   "Let us hope better," replied she, but uncertainly.  
   Arthur's words to the council were few.  
   "Men of London," he began. "You have done well in defending your
walls. You would have  
  
Page 304  
  
done better but that there was a traitor among you."  
   One looked at another, distressed and doubtful. Cian, seeing his
drift, spoke out,--  
   "Would it be just, my Emperor, to expect us alone to rout such a
host?"  
   He waved his hand toward the southern windows, where, in detached
pictures, were seen, beyond the river, the vast and firmly planted
armies of Saxondom.  
   Arthur gazed on that sight, then turned quietly to Cian. "Will you
say that no more could have been done if all had been eager? With the
enemy ravaging in scattered parties, what hand was interposed? With the
enemy fleeing, who followed beyond the wall, and slew? What ill friend
of our race had power to draw a magic circle, and wilt the manhood of
British men beyond it to the weakness of a dreaming girl? One--if old
tales be true--hidden in some caverned place of the White Hill of
Cynvelyn. Whether heathen imposture, I know not; or some evil being
justly wiped from the race of men, or existing since the beginning, for
man's undoing and destruction. But this I know very surely, that not
again from his nether hold shall Vran work treason against Britain. He
shall see the daylight, for all the little love he hath of it."  
  
Page 305  
  
At once there were cries, aghast. Aurelia, their queen, arising with
modest dignity, spoke for all.  
   "Beware, great Emperor, not of Vran, nor of any who is or hath been
mortal. But beware of affronting that good God who hath set deep
feelings in men. These also have made our walls many times the stronger.
To disturb the relics of Vran in their burial-place will be a horror in
all eyes."  
   "My Emperor, my loved general!" exclaimed Cian, with shaken voice, "a
thing so wrong would surely weaken the homage of every upright follower,
and forfeit, soon or late, your dominion, which was founded in
righteousness, and rests on righteousness only."  
   Arthur looked gravely, first at the one speaker, then at the
other--sadly, almost fondly, at the woman whom he had made queen, but
whose queenliness was beyond his making, that woman who even now made
the luxuriant Guinevere seem less to him; then not so sadly, but with a
spice of anger, at the trained soldier of his battles.  
   "I had foreseen all this," he said. "I am sad to grieve you, lady;
menaces move me not, Prince Cian. Those who have all wisdom, and who
love me not, beyond doubt will leave me. To-morrow we fight the Saxons,
when men will be tested. I deal to-night with an enemy long covered,
nearer home."  
  
Page 306  
  
   He walked sedately from the hall of audience. At once arose the
trample and clang of troops held ready, now steadily moving. It went
with him; and all knew that he was for the tomb in the White Hill.  
   Cian, with face of outrage, cried out, "It is beyond enduring. It
shall not be. There are men in London"--  
   But Aurelia demanded, "Am I queen?"  
   "Assuredly," he replied.  
   "Then no hand of London shall be raised against the Emperor."  
   Cian looked at her with bewilderment, then suspicion. He had seen the
softening of memory in Arthur's face. Might not she also remember and
hope, towering, as she did, above Guinevere--and Guinevere so far away!
The fancy went forth with him resentfully.  
   His feet bore him to the haunted White Hill. Arthur and his men were
there already. The digging had begun.  
   "It is a work that you will repent," said Cian curtly, halting, as in
doubt whether he should say or do more.  
   Arthur viewed him in displeasure, and half turned, as if about to
give some order, then waved his hand in dismissal without speaking; and
the work went on.  
  
Page 307  
  
   Cian walked away with hot darkness in his heart, feeling himself
wholly right and wholly wronged. Forming no definite plan, he yet drew
together his chariots and such of his men as were most devoted to him,
in the northern part of the city; and when Aurelia sent to know his
meaning, he returned a doubtful and sullen answer. But distress and
perplexity were so in the air every way that she could not determine to
do anything.  
   A shaking palsy had fallen on the city. For a moment some talked of
resistance, and some of fleeing, as not sure what bolt of destruction
might fall. But they waited in mere fascination and terror. Only the
priests, with a few hundred of the bravest behind them, went in
procession before the Emperor, to beseech and warn--if yet by any means
they might prevent the dreadful thing. But Arthur merely heard them, and
bade them stand by to see that it was done well.  
   Below the sod and the clay the diggers came to a rough casing of
loosely cemented, irregular stones, and within this an apartment, or
crypt, very neatly walled with translucent blocks unlike any material
near. Therein, on a polished altar, symbolically engraven, rested Vran's
hairless and terror-working skull. Yet it wrought no terror now. Arthur
inspected it curiously, and averred that he found it too like any other
human head to be treated with despite,  
  
Page 308  
  
but would send it honorably away from London for reburial.  
   Then the great hole was refilled; and all disquieted London was free
to go to its repose, with a sense of relief, since no cataclysm had
befallen, that was a very odd blankness and disappointment also.

BUT Cian took no rest. Through the night he paced uneasily among his
men, or tossed himself down, to rise again, or sat bitterly.  
   Aurelia's waking moments were also of disquiet and foreboding, so
that she half wished the city of London left with the foe still about
it, and no rescue. For what had come to pass was portentous, with great
upheaval in it of men's faith and human ties. Not the most philosophic
mind could face it unshaken.  
   In the new daylight her mind was clearer. The act of the Emperor was
done beyond all undoing. She had no better liking for it than at first;
yet destruction had not fallen, and there was no course but to go
forward. Toward Cian she was in displeasure, trusting that he would yet
do his part, and striving to weigh duly in his behalf the affront which
had so stirred him.  
  
Page 310  
  
   Word was brought her of a very great muster by Arthur eastward of the
town, presaging some enterprise against the enemy. It slighted her that
she should in no way have been called on. After breakfasting, she rode
forth duly attended. Arthur was already far beyond the Wallbrook, where
the troops of the north and west were gathering to him. But as she went
she saw many of her own fighting-men yet at their posts, with eyes that
held more than her own unrest. But when Arthur, the Emperor, had sight
of her, he rode very decorously thither.  
   She watched his coming with curious interest. Reliance grew within
her on this power among men, who feared not anything, even the most
sacred. She found in his poise and air something of the warrior
archangel. At least there was exaltation in his eye. Yet surely even a
champion of heaven, while abiding among men, should not ride rough-shod
over their hope and adoration.  
   "I had not thought the Queen of London would be abroad so early," he
said. "May we look also for some of her people?"  
   "Our Emperor knows they are all his to command," replied she.  
   Arthur reined his steed around beside her, and they rode on
together.  
   "Your Emperor," he responded gravely, "has never acted from his own
will only, without regard-  
  
Page 311  
  
ing those between, unless on the highest compulsion, or in the greatest
need."  
   She held an obedient face, bowing gently. He resumed:--  
   "This time there was no such urgence: My old friend Cian kept aloof.
I could not know how you might feel. We had no need of the unwilling,
with so many of us already, and *this* ." He bent his brow toward the
shield.  
   "Yet the Saxons are many," she said gravely.  
   It was indeed a spectacle. Their host, great already, had swollen
immensely during the night by the increment of many small parties
hurriedly called in. By far the greater number were afoot. They did not
cover the ground evenly, but in neighboring bodies, larger or
smaller--with every chieftain the men who had followed him to the war. A
continual hum came from them, as of readiness for the wrestling of
spears. .  
   "There will be less of them when all is over," answered the Emperor;
and his men who heard, for they were near now, cried out eagerly, after
the manner of the day. That sound of grim rejoicing went along the lines
and throughout the great mass of soldiery--greater still in seeming for
the number of those who were mounted. Only London levies who had been
with Vortimer at first kept an over-shadowed air; but, as their queen
openly smiled on  
  
Page 312  
  
them from beside the Emperor, these responded with a very especial
acclaim. It cheered and fortified her. She gazed at Arthur with a
certain deep wistfulness, hardly daring. "Does it not show the better
way to their zeal and aid?" she said at last.  
   Arthur bowed courteously, but as yielding nothing.  
   "Prince Cian is deeply grieved," she added gently.  
   Now, indeed, there came a touch of resentment in Arthur's pure,
strong face.  
   "Cian defended you well," he said, "and for that and old service much
may be passed by. Yet he carries it far. One might fancy him an enemy.
Let him stay. The cause of God needs no reluctant aid."  
   She bowed in deference rather than conviction.  
   "But at least my father shall lead some of my people to the fight, if
you will spare him," she said. "We grudge nothing, if we do not approve
all things--even in the highest."  
   The Emperor knew it was her last rebuke. He bowed low to her
womanliness, but offered no defence. When he made answer, it was to her
earlier words only.  
   "They will be welcome. They shall be first over the bridge."  
   As they rode back before the army, Aurelia could not fail to notice
how--for all his rapt loftiness--he bore the new splendor of his shield
ever in the sun. Moreover, the gathering, and the movement,  
  
Page 313  
  
and the going and coming again by one road, all seemed part of the
vaunting pictorial fancy of his race.  
   Constantine being already in the forum, and assault resolved on
forthwith, a galloping messenger was despatched him, with word to set
men at breaking down the barricades that had long blocked the bridge.
Almost, before Aurelia entered the town, a great crashing and
splintering had begun.  
   She had looked for interference from the Saxon outposts by the
riverside; but, after one undecided movement, these gave no sign. They
even drew off a little, so as to leave open space for some part of
Arthur's army, but thickened continually behind the curved front thus
acquired. Within the city she discerned a shifting of men, and judged
that Arthur was putting forward those who were best able to give and
take in hard hand-play against odds, until re-enforcements should reach
them. But some of her own were still in the van.  
   She looked from time to time toward the guardtower of the northern
gate, where stood a group watching, with the chariots ranged below. All
ready, but for what? The question made her blush in anger and in shame.
Should she send again to entreat--another slight? Or command--with
possible conflict of wills, and contingencies not to be thought on?
Hemmed about and strained, she waited, think-  
  
Page 314  
  
ing, "Surely now he will come, or now, or now." At last, while looking
riverward, an exclamation beside her recalled her eyes; and she clasped
her hands, with a low, pleased cry, as she saw that the tower-roof was
vacant.  
   At the same time a stir ran through the waiting troops of every arm
near that tower. Then the light left her face, and a low moan escaped
her. For they were not coming, but going out through the gateway, Cian
and the chariots foremost. The bright face of her hope seemed smitten
with enduring blackness.  
   On a tablet she hastily wrote for Arthur: "Prince Clan has fled. His
chariots and men are lost to you."  
   She heard sounds of surprise from both armies; of jeering also from
the one, of angered mortification from the other. With set teeth and
lips, she watched, now the bridge, gradually clearing of obstruction,
now the causeway through the northern marshes, along which the
glittering thread of spears and wheels and men in armor crawled
steadily. Surely, she thought, now he will turn, or now; then she chided
her silliness, for undoubtedly, if he had meant at all to fight about
the bridge, he would have taken the direct course thereto. The last hope
left her, as she saw them keep straight on, unwavering, across the marsh
and the open land, into the woods. Ah,  
  
Page 315  
  
Cian had robbed her of the best of London, and made it a by-word for all
time! She was half in mind to hurry after, with unmistakable commands,
and the will, at any cost, to be obeyed.  
   On the brink of this came Arthur's answer: "Whatever Cian may
purpose, be sure it is not to play the coward. This from his Emperor and
old-time comrade, who little loves his later moods and ways."  
   She grew genial under that, with sudden self-blame and thankfulness
to the Emperor. How could she have been the first to give way in trust,
and to need assurance from another? How far, too, had she failed in
comprehending "the magnanimous Arthur!"  
   Here were two men, the foremost of their time, who had so ordered
some part of their conduct that a very friendly woman, meaning to be
just and generous, had half despised them. Certainly the Emperor was not
at his noblest as a desecrator of the grave. Certainly Prince Cian could
not yearn to be depicted as withdrawing through the farthest gate while
his comrades marched into danger. For the moment she felt like giving up
all comprehension of the sex, but rested in the consoling sense that
somehow all was well, though details might be bettered.  
   But now her father, well pleased at this break in his commonplace
duties, and looking all that he ever had thought of himself, rode over
the opened bridge  
  
Page 316  
  
at the head of his men. No chance for indecision here, nor conflicting
wills, but only those of the enemy, whom he had no thought to shun. His
fellow-townsmen, even those who had hated him and contended with him,
were all proud of their chief Roman now.  
   He went slowly, his horsemen spreading like a fan over the low open
ground beyond the river, to cover the exit from the bridge. Llywarch
followed with chosen men of the north, a goodly company, turning up the
river, where Constantine made room for him. Next Lancelot in like
manner, fronted down-stream, with the men of the west. Then Arthur
himself, with a greater body, drawn from all quarters, pushed these
three forward nearly to the Saxon front, and formed a denser demi-belt
behind them. It left indeed but room for one legion of foot, who came
swiftly across to guard the bridge-head, making living buttresses on
either side, with a narrow lane between for re-enforcements.  
   The Saxons were swaying now, with the word of onset almost at tongue
and ear. It was not Arthur's will that this word should be given. He
rose full height in the stirrups, holding his consecrated shield with
both hands above his head, and flashed it for a signal to Llywarch, to
Constantine, to Lancelot. As it swept round the curve, the Saxons
received its scintillation in their dazzled eyes, with some wild ex-  
  
Page 317  
  
pectancy of magic. Before they had quite regained themselves, the outer
line of Britons, with loud cries, had spurred in among them everywhere,
spearing and slashing. A few moments later Arthur and his main body of
horsemen charged, with greater impetus, in the wake of Constantine.  
   He well knew that the chief endeavor of the enemy would be to cut him
off by striking in crosswise near the bridge. But he meant they should
gain nothing by this; and before him he saw the father of Aurelia--whom
but for Guinevere he might have sought as his bride--in great urgency of
peril.  
   For in this supreme moment Constantine was rushing onward among the
enemy as man never went. All disparagement of the past, all baffled
self-esteem, rose before him; the inspiration of blood, of lineage, the
memory of the white death-charge of Aurelius Ambrosius, hurled him on.
At last he was to justify all that he had held himself to be, or die, as
Ambrose died, amid the lasting plaudits of the world. So he rode down
and smote down, breaking through dense masses on his powerful stallion,
taking spear-point after spear-point harmlessly on shield and mail,
keeping right on, though slanting leftward unwittingly, with no eye for
anything but the swift work he had to do.  
   His men, plying desperately to keep the pace, were still left
stringing behind one by one, or in little  
  
Page 318  
  
fighting knots among their enemies. They joined Arthur as he swept on,
keeping his own ranks well together, and scattering the hostile froth
before him. But Constantine was beyond their aid.  
   Four times Arthur saw the Roman spear-stricken and all but hurled
from the saddle; then, since the end was near, he, shouting with might
and main, the jewelled Queen of Heaven burning on his arm, and a hundred
devoted fighting men hammering close behind, came side by side with the
dying Constantine, and the struggle around them was deadly. Packed in
the press of friends and enemies, Constantine rode upright in armor
manfully out of life. When the inburst of British men scattered the
mass, and freed them, it was but a corpse in armor that Arthur caught a
moment by the shoulder, as it fell crashing. In his own peril he had no
choice but to let it be.  
   He was now, though with many wounded men, in a great expanse of
hostile infantry. But the slanting chase had led him toward the side of
Lancelot, though much farther afield; and by the shouting he judged this
prince, with his mountain men, to be retarded by great odds, but working
in resolutely. Arthur turned thither with weight and fury, his men all
striving as if on the one road to life. A tongue of the Saxon army,
caught thus between hammer and anvil, was sorely worsted and broken.  
  
Page 319  
  
   Lancelot had been strengthened already by a part of the footmen from
the bridge, or he would have been driven back before this in spite of
all. Arthur and he together strenuously cleared away their closest
assailants at the sides and rear; then swept over the ground which
Constantine had held, to the relief of Llywarch.  
   They did not find him so hard pressed as they had feared. For some
reason the weight of Saxondom in front of him had been less than
elsewhere; and Caowl, with a mixed body of re-enforcements flowing
thinly over the bridge, had given him nearly all their aid. In his
cheery, indomitable way, the Prince of Argoed, as always, had made a
fine fight of it, penetrating far, and at the last falling back slowly
with no ruinous loss of men. Everywhere around the space left for the
Britons, the Saxon attack had been forestalled, the Saxon front badly
broken.  
   Lancelot returned to his place again, Arthur to that of Constantine.
All busied themselves in quick dashes to keep a wider space open, that
there might be room for new men as they came. On their steady coming
success depended; for the Saxons were not really shattered, except the
mere face of them, and must press overpoweringly.  
   Eschwine saw this also. Hitherto he had held slightly aloof, hoping
little from the first clashes, and watchful to deal some telling blow.
He now  
  
Page 320  
  
pushed his archers along the river's edge from above, toward the bridge,
under cover of a moving spearhedge, while simultaneously he made a
distracting onset elsewhere.  
   Only a few minutes earlier some of Aurelia's people had found three
chariots left behind by Cian as not perfect and strong. Externally they
had the formidable look of their tribe, bright bronzework, seemly
woodwork, scythe-like blades of long reach--great rushing engines of war
every way to be desired. The queen joined in the welcome which greeted
them, and hurried them forward. So, with untrained horses, and hiding
fatal weakness under a show of bravery, they rattled and rumbled forward
into the line of fire.  
   So fair a target was not easily to be missed. At the middle of the
bridge a flight of flaming arrows took them. Streaks of flaring,
smoke-billowing tow struck across the horses' nostrils; keen things,
they knew not what, burnt their hides or pierced them. They reared and
twisted this way and that; and the faulty vehicles were broken and
splintered and locked together, barricading the way with a jagged,
hopeless entanglement. The impatient horsemen following, themselves
galled and disordered by missiles, pressed vehemently up, with the sound
of fighting for a lure, and the impetus of the long column behind to
bear them on. Presently there was but a writhing and  
  
Page 321  
  
dangerous mass, overflowing with great splashes into the water on either
side, until the bridge groaned under it; and still the barrier grew.  
   Arthur saw the peril at hand. From the first he had known this risk,
if any risk there could be to one who bore the sure guaranty of Heaven.
His open war on Vran had left him no choice but to cross and right
himself in all eyes by victory. He saw the whole field now with clear
vision and constant mind,--Aurelia hastening down the White Hill toward
the bridge; Llywarch and his cohorts dashing at the spearsmen and
archers; Eschwine coming straight at himself with a front of horsemen
and a great leaping crew of long-haired Saxon foot. Sending word that
the men on the bridge and at its nearer end should follow Llywarch, he
also charged forward, with all about him.  
   Midway, as he most desired, Arthur met Eschwine; met him without a
word, but a swift-swaying quiver of his long spear that smote aside the
lance of the Saxon, caught him at the shoulder, between the plates of
bronze, and twisted him backward. One second Eschwine clung, with a face
of fury and torment, then fell. Arthur went on vehemently, and many more
rode likewise over the fallen man. After the battle Eschwine's body was
dragged from a little runnel into which he had crawled for shelter, the
dints of shod hoofs in spine  
  
Page 322  
  
and skull showing how he had met with an inglorious end.  
   His fall and the continued rush of the Britons did not at once turn
the Saxon tide. For a time there were two counter torrents of men--one
driving on with the plunging of mailed horses, with spears down-thrust
and forward, with the smiting of sword-blades and axes; the other
bounding like acrobats, upstriking and indriving, thrusting reckless
hands throat-ward to drag their enemies down, or, even when wounded and
brought to pause, dealing their blows every way until overridden and
laid in the dust.  
   Even Arthur felt the jar of more blades than one behind the sacred
shield. His spear was dragged from him by a sea-rover whom it had
transfixed. Nearly following it out of the saddle, he was glad enough to
let it go, and snatch his sword for defence against other assailants
then around him.  
   A little way farther, and he found that the movement was British
alone. A long wedge of them spread back from him, keeping on and holding
together far better than their opponents. Quickening pace with a shout,
he found the resistance giving way, and presently the Saxons were
fleeing before him, except a few knots of men, who fought on very
determinedly, and were shattered or left behind as might happen. At last
he drove a reluctant, half-hesitating crew before him into open
ground.  
  
Page 323  
  
   Halting here, while his men poured through after him and fell into
better trim for charging again, he saw that only a lesser part of the
Saxons, after all, had been routed. The great body behind him had nearly
closed again, facing about with a good will toward further encounter.
Far to the right Lancelot was cutting his way slowly into a forest of
opponents; while on the left, as slowly, Llywarch fell back before
overpowering forces. He turned anxiously to the bridge, and there was
indeed some sign of opening; but would even the first beginning of aid
come in time? Up the river there was a stir of dust and moving forms,
not yet visible to the Saxons, who, besides, were busy. It made him
think of Cian longingly, but that was too good to be true.  
   He charged back to the bridge-head, fighting hard with greater loss
than before in less time. As he faced about again, the Saxons were there
still, all together, and beginning to come on with firm feet and faces.
Lancelot and Llywarch joined him soon, the enemy pressing close on them
from every side.  
   Then, over a hill beyond them rose a hurrying chariot, then another;
and presently a whole line of such were in view. The sun burned on the
well-remembered golden vest. "Cian, Cian!" cried the Britons all
together, from riverside and bridge and all the roofs of the city. The
Saxons gave a cry of  
  
Page 324  
  
consternation, ending in defiance, and a part of them turned about
toward the new assailants.  
   About the same time the tangle of woodwork and ironwork was hurled
from the bridge, and men began to come over.  
   Where Cian struck, the mass of the Saxons was densest, facing both
ways formidably, for all their surprise. A few archers, whom Llywarch
had driven to the rear, let fly with effect at their new kind of
assailants. Cian himself was an especial mark, his charioteer receiving
an arrow through the arm, while he heard another vehicle crashing over
behind him. But his own kept on, though waveringly, and nearly all that
followed struck and cut into the great mass of men before them. The
chariot, as an unreasonable means of destruction, was the one thing that
shook the Saxon before it touched him. To this bounding, swerving,
onward hurling contrivance of steeds and wheels and fighting-men and
body-severing blades he could by no means become reconciled. Even before
Cian reached his enemies, he had known by their eyes that they would not
long bear the onset. And now, as he felt them yielding every way, he
heard the cheery cry of Llywarch vehemently coming toward him; while a
wider, wilder swell of voices, prolonged over the now thronging bridge
to the London shore, told of a great onrush of Arthur and his shield
divine.  
  
Page 325  
  
   Yet some of the enemy were packed between these opposite charges,
holding the ground perforce, and lessening their momentum. So it was not
without hard fighting that the old friends, Cian and Llywarch, met. Even
afterward the Saxon infantry, cut off on the side toward the river
shore, made terrible efforts to break through, and join their main body.
Over, under, and between the chariots, a part of them succeeded. Turning
on this great remainder, the comrade princes tore into it with momently
increasing numbers, until they had it bodily in motion. But ever the
great Emperor, shield on arm, kept his place far before them, with a
comet-like trail of mailed riders.  
   Once he was cut off, and near destruction. A great throng, reeling
from the assault of Llywarch farther to the right, broke across behind
him, and hardened into a living wall at sight of their great
opportunity; then it came furiously upon the few cohorts thus cut off,
knowing they had but little time. Again the chariots came in play,
though not too soon, and corners were lapped from the wall, and lanes
cut in, until at last Llywarch's horsemen could carve a way through. So
Arthur speedily was free again, and hastening on, but with the best of
his men in greater mass near him. Their spreading front bore back the
Saxons over the open land.  
   Thus, in wave on wave of dashing onset, he drove  
  
Page 326  
  
them until nightfall; and ever they resisted, seizing new foothold and
fighting well; but their resistance grew less. When darknesss fell
Arthur turned about to ride through a country filled with scattered and
hopeless enemies, knowing that there was, at most, only a small remnant
of the once great Saxon army floating on before its vanguard toward the
sea.  
   He had lost many men and some notable chieftains; among others,
Caowl, who fell in charging a rough wedge of the West Kent men half-way
to the Cray. On Arthur's own body, for all its constant exposure, there
was no wound. Good armor might count for much in this; rapidity of
motion, skill, and audacity, for more. But he looked on the holy face
that brightened his shield, and gave all the glory there. It was Mary,
Queen of Heaven, he averred, who had saved him, and won the victory.  
   Now, this was well-nigh insufferable to Cian; to Tigernach, openly
and wholly so. Were there no living men who had come vehemently to his
aid when his need was very sore? What would have befallen him, shield or
no shield, but for that first rush of the chariots? It was too much that
they should be called upon to join in the aggrandizement of a new faith,
which frowned on their own.  
   Arthur had forgiven Cian his first irresolution, in view of the great
amends made by later service; and Cian, having rendered this, could not
withhold his  
  
Page 327  
  
good will also. But the wound in either nature was thinly healed. The
pious vaunting of the Emperor soon made it sore again. Tigernach brought
open dissension by some rash utterance that awoke Arthur's horror.  
   Laying hand to sword, he bade, "Cease blaspheming!"  
   Tigernach glanced back defiantly. "But for \`blasphemers' yon
woman-faced shield might have gone to work magic for the Cantwara. Thus
much will I dare to say, though it cost me death from an ingrate." He
cried it aloud, hotly and defiantly, and, turning aside, made off at
good speed toward his native Andred.  
   Arthur half raised his hand to order pursuit, then lowered it,
wrestling with his anger. "There is no need," said he. "Who can harm Our
Lady? And I would not return evil for good."  
   "Somewhat of that," said Cian, "has been done already, when praise is
given where it belongs not, and withheld where it is due; when old
friends are driven to the hills, angered, with no need."  
   Arthur's face grew stormy. "Prince Cian is speaking more in
wilfulness than in duty," said he. "Moreover, tales are abroad that link
him all too nearly to the dealers in darkness."  
   Cian stiffened in the saddle,--for he had left his chariot
broken,--with lowering brow. "I know of  
  
Page 328  
  
no darker dealing than the desecration of the tomb," said he.  
   The voice of Arthur seemed struggling in his throat for a moment;
then abruptly he made a gesture of dismissal. Cian bade adieu gravely,
and rode with furious heart toward the bridge. For once there should be
no question as to full obedience. "Go"--ay, at a sweep, to his own far
northern hills, and as fast as his good horse might carry him. Forthwith
he sent a swift rider after Tigernach, who overtook him by dawn at
Verulam.  
   But, as they rode, Cian thought painfully of the queen, Aurelia, and
how he had left her in her sorrow without a word, and to whom the
welcome task of consoling her would now fall.  
   Truly, in her bereavement, she had found it hard to miss that
strength whereon she had learned to lean through the long leaguer of the
city. With all her gratitude to Arthur, a vacant place remained
unfilled. But Cian's prophetic power, whether fancied or real, could not
show him this clearly for comfort.  
   Meanwhile the country of West Kent as far as the Medway had been
swept of Saxons, even husbandmen. At first Arthur was minded to push yet
farther, bearing the long-settled fighting-men of Kent quite to their
ancient stronghold of Thanet. But this was not to be done without sieges
and losses  
  
Page 329  
  
and much suffering to those who dwelt quietly. Moreover, the day had
been set for his nuptials with Guinevere at Caerleon; and such
undertaking might give them long delay.  
   But the savage Essex folk were driven wholly from the mainland,
holding only some walled islets off that coast.

THE MYSTERIES OF MONA.

                          --TALIESSIN.

  
THERE was another in Arthur's camp longing to go northward. The
withdrawal of Cian awoke uneasiness in his friend of Argoed. A kindly
face and voice by the way might avert some schism, or at least
cold-heartedness, in the cause of the land. But more, vastly more, he
felt Sanawg drawing him from afar, his cliff-bride, his marvel and his
love.  
   With little difficulty he won leave from Arthur on the day after the
battle; and by hard hurrying and the favor of accident overtook the two
seceders near Caer Lerion. The three kept company thereafter as far as
Argoed.  
   Llywarch found at his home a welcome both of joy and sorrow; for
Freur was yet too near her loss, and too piercingly reminded of it by
the sight of him, to conceal her grief otherwise than pitifully. The
case was indeed far worse than such common assurance of death as would
leave the poor body for burial. They could not, indeed, really hope to
see Dynan  
  
Page 331  
  
again among the living; yet was there such a faint half-glimmer of hope,
as kept searching parties abroad in the wood, and drove her to make
unceasing inquiry of all who haunted such wild places, or had so much as
seen the tokens of his last fight and taking away. Whatsoever they told
her she garnered, if it were only wild-woven fiction, to please the
sorrowing ear; yet, all in all, the tales chilled her uncannily. The
green-clad phantom lady and her ghostly rout came murmured to her like
sounds in sleep, by rumors that she scarce could trace or tell. What
evil thing had befallen her lover? What fell enchantment held him beyond
all mortal ken?  
   Thoughts like these had driven her forth to practise rites, piteous
if unholy, by those terraced mounds that were held in memory as the
homes of the elder people now gone. For she said to herself, "It may be
that they are not demons, nor wholly given over to working the loss of
salvation; and if I but beseech humbly the dread beings with ample
offering, even yet they may relent, and set him free."  
   In this work of impiety Sanawg would not and could not aid her, but
dissuaded with very strong conviction and great dread of what ill might
yet lurk for her friend in the malign everlasting shadow. Her first
meeting with Llywarch had in it the added happiness of relief in one to
whom she could freely tell all that she feared.  
  
Page 332  
  
   His own kind joy was not a little dashed and darkened by the thought
of such fell anguish, so near him in every way. It stirred him, too, as
it had stirred his bride, that his sister should be seeking converse in
dismal scenes, with beings unholy. Madness might come of it, or some
other ill unknown. He said no word to Freur in dissuasion, but offered
soon to lead her with a party into that fatal wilderness. But behind her
glad, patient eyes, he well knew the stilled suffering.  
   He sought Cian also, who yet lingered with them, and listened
gravely, but as to something in which he might render aid. Very
willingly Cian talked with Freur of all such mysteries, and what he had
heard and known of wise dealings concerning them. She listened eagerly,
well knowing his repute for such knowledge; well commended even by that
great warlock, Merlin, who was now quite gone for a season. Then she
asked more compelling invocations of him; and these were given her. Also
he willingly made appointment to practise them, and all needful
ceremonials, that night, in her behalf and presence. Thereon she
brightened into more of hope than for many a day, and this pleased
Llywarch very well; but Sanawg felt it bitter that what was done,
however well meaning, could feed only the thirst for evil enchantment.  
   What the two wrestlers with the invisible won  
  
Page 333  
  
therefrom in storm and darkness, without star, was left untold to any
other ear. But Freur's face for a time shone like that of one brought
from the tomb into living hope and sunlight. Cian watched her, less
assuredly, but would say nothing to darken it. After he left them for
his own country, this light faded. There were days when expectancy tired
her, days, too, when all hope seemed gone; yet again the hope often
brightened, even though she herself had searched the place of
evanishing; and years went slowly by before she could give Dynan over
utterly.  
   Cian was wearied now, rather than actively wroth with his old leader,
the Emperor. But Tigernach had no past that should hold him, and
resentment combined with fervor of religion to threaten Arthur's rule.
For Tigernach was planning and preparing a great revolt, with the Lord
of the Chariots, unknowing, for the centre of his plot.  
   Cian did indeed suspect the sending of some covert hint or summons,
as men of one thought only came gathering about him. But there was
urgent need of tillers for the valley soil, and of armed Britons
everywhere along that borderland. There was balm also for a heart
baffled and misprized in the many faces turning to him for guidance, and
the watchful hearkening which would not lose a word. They said little,
but from them to him there was the thrill of men awaiting only a sign.
Yet, since he  
  
Page 334  
  
need not give that sign, their expectation was harmless. Indeed, why
should he not turn their power and faith in him to some end that all
would applaud? There was a great reach of land, once British, to be
regained, between him and Caer Ebrauc.  
   The thought, once admitted, grew until ambition was again mightily
astir. His father had already withdrawn from leadership, leaving, with
pride, all power in his hands. New stirs to the southward again parted
Llywarch and his young wife; but Cian would not go thither, for the
north held him. No longer passively accepting only such fighting-men as
came, he sent messages of alluring hope through all the channels of
mystic brotherhood, and to all the old comrades whom he could reach of
every faith and degree. But not many Christians responded, even to war
on the Saxons; for a doubt of him had already gone abroad. Nevertheless,
his gathering soon had grown to a mighty size.  
   In spite of his plainest utterance, he found the thought well rooted
among his soldiery that there was something greater to follow the
conquest of Caer Ebrauc. Also, there came, not singly, but in eager
troops, the devoted praying-men of Mona, dark of brow and bright of eye,
their souls keenly fixed on some great upheaval to come, and the
blessings of a new Druidic world. They bore tokens with them, and charms
of mighty efficacy, and banners fit to  
  

  
"They Bore Tokens with them, and Charms of Mighty Efficiency."

  
Page 335  
  
wave forth against any in the world, for very strange and lovely in
wildness was the blazoning thereon. These, more than any others, greeted
Cian fondly, esteeming him the very right arm of their faith.  
   Yet they brought trouble. Not long afterward came a warning from the
Emperor that there was grave talk abroad of Prince Cian's gathering.
"For himself, he questioned nothing that some worthy enterprise against
the heathen was truly in hand, as had been spread abroad. But Cerdic,
the West Saxon, was gathering ships and men to descend, no one knew
whither, so that already it had been deemed safer to provide for the
imperial nuptials at a place more inland than Caerleon. Hence it would
be wise to move southward, with so many brave men ready to give aid. Nor
would anything so still evil whisperings as some insignia, borne before
them, of the Christian faith." Thus wrote the Emperor.  
   In this there was no command, but only such urgent counselling as
showed that command would follow. Cian brooded over it, then made answer
that he was glad indeed his Emperor's trust would not be taken from him
by frightened people and maligners; that his forces were not yet ready
for movement either way; and, having raised them, he prayed leave rather
to use them at the north, where was such opening to retrieve old losses;
that the dragon standard of the Emperor should be borne  
  
Page 336  
  
before all others, but that he was loth to put constraint on the soul or
conscience of any man.  
   Therefore he busied himself all the more, meaning to push out on his
conquest before any message of forbidding could reach him. Thus he was
already well toward Caer Ebrauc when an urgent summons to Caerleon
reached his home from Arthur, himself hastening westward. This followed
Cian, but could not overtake him until he was in close leaguer of the
Saxon capital and stronghold--even on the verge of assault. It was
scarce in human nature or in safety then to withdraw; but he hastened
the hard work before him, and soon could send word that the ancient
imperial Eboracum was British again.  
   With it came under hand much fertile country, where robbers and the
sons of robbers had become husbandmen in long occupancy; also many
lesser places, half ruin, half rude Saxon revival, after the fashion of
the chief city. All these must be guarded, or what had been sharply won
would soon be lost again. In this he had new aid, rough aid, from all
along the forest verge and the ridges of Elmet, even also from Argoed.
But many of these recruits were more intent on taking than saving, being
violent destroyers by nature; so that it was hard to tell whether he had
most help or hindrance from his allies. But the few whom old Edyrn could
send him rendered good service; and that ancient cavern  
  
Page 337  
  
hero also came forth with the remnant of Isurium, taking very proudly
his old post of garrison behind her strong walls again.  
   Here Cian halted with them, but not for long, since the delays had
been many, and he was needed elsewhere; but it was a more than joyous
meeting, above all for Gwydion and his aged wife, who bowed heads of
thankfulness to hear again of their daughter, so far away.  
   The victor brought with him to his rugged home a fine array of men
for the southward journey. But now news of victory came from Caerleon,
and it left no cause to stir. Yet he kept the men in arms about him,
being uncertain what call might follow.

CERDIC, the West Saxon, greatest of the invading kings, kept good watch
over all that came to pass in the British island from his city of
Winchester, which he had held ever since he broke in on Ambrosius, and
took the life of that Emperor at the great battle of Netley along the
border of the Gwent. Yet it was not so long ago, nor had his losses been
so light, that he should forget and assail again without good warrant.
Therefore he had lain by, like an orderly neighbor, waiting for the wise
time to come.  
   When the great army of Ossa Cyllalaur gathered above the forest of
Celidon, and London was almost in the clutch of Eschwine, Cerdic had
indeed very nearly given a bloody hand to their work. But the crash came
suddenly, and made him wary, as one who must bear a dangerous burden
quite alone. Still, his men remained ever ready, and the broken bands  
  
Page 339  
  
of Kent and Essex drifted to him. Their urgency for revenge upon Arthur
was incessant and increasing. In later times there were men who deemed
that he had also invitation from Lancelot in his urgency to keep
Guinevere from the Emperor, but this need not be. Cerdic's many ships
and his murmuring host, the wealth of Caerleon, and the still greater
inflow to the wedding of Arthur, were surely argument enough. He put to
sea, heading westward. Forthwith Guinevere and all rich things which had
been gathered for the marriage were sent beyond sea-reach to Camelot.
Her charm was so great, and so heightened by design, that Arthur, almost
perforce, went also. But when she was once in safety, he broke suddenly
away, and hurried back with all the men he could gather from his
frontier fortresses, bearing more hatred than common in his heart for
the interrupting Saxon.  
   Meanwhile Cerdic had appeared before the Legion city, and found it
waiting. In all Britain there was no olden town more splendidly and
daringly alive, more endowed with treasures, both inherited and won,
with men stern to defend them. Year by year the tide of commerce had
been turning westward; and Caerleon, from the pre-eminence given by
Arthur's court, received more than an equal share. Under every later
drift of population, it held also very plentifully the blood of those
Roman legionaries  
  
Page 340  
  
who once made it their stronghold. Lancelot was there in command, with
many sons of the hills. No choice now but to fight the
Saxon,--vengefully, too, as against himself, in the memory of envious
hours that half longed for his coming!  
   Cerdic's multitude made havoc of all the open land for leagues
around, so that the people were driven headlong to places of refuge.
Then the forayers gathered in, till every man was close about the walls,
waiting the great assault of the morrow. At daybreak they rubbed
astonished eyes; for there was a shimmering of armor everywhere on the
eastward hills, the dragon standard of Arthur waving above all.  
   This, at first, they assailed with great fervor and uproar.
Afterward, beaten back, they yet withstood, in dense blocks of men, the
swift charges made on them. Yet, whether in assault or defence, they
fought always under the weight of surprise and his many victories.
Little by little the corners were ground surely from the living wedges
and squares, and the very heart of them was dinted out under hoof and
mail. By midday the very last of the Saxons, however dogged and
laggardly, was under sail from that unkindly shore.  
   For a time they hovered about it with derision and menace, now
altogether, now in fragmentary squadrons, doing notable damage here and
there, so that the Emperor was kept vigilant in repelling them  
  
Page 341  
  
all up and down the great Severn estuary,--far from Camelot, far from
Guinevere. Even when, at last, they were seemingly quite gone, he waited
yet a while, uncertain, and had his reward in sure tidings of their
passing northward beyond Wales, along the shore. Then he feared, with
reason, for Caer Ligion, the Chester of modern days, and made haste
thither, arriving once more in time.  
   Again the enemy were engaged under the city walls, and beaten off,
stroke by stroke, but with heavier loss, having a long and anxious
flight overland to their carven prows drawn ashore near the mouth of the
Ribble. Now a fall of the tide left these more in sand than in water,
and Arthur's foremost horsemen and runners came to them with the later
mass of fugitives mingling and fighting confusedly, so that many great
war-boats were axe-broken about the keel by chance or design before they
could be floated; and, both in the deep mire and on firm ground, there
was great slaughter of men who could not get away. Cerdic, with a
remnant, was very glad to make all speed homeward, with abiding memories
of that chaotic nightmare battle on the strand of Trath Tribuit.  
   In all this Llywarch did his part well, but Cian had no part at all.
For, on the march, word had come to Arthur that Mona, though
ill-defended, had been passed without harm by the sea-robbers, and  
  
Page 342  
  
that Cian, with many priests of that isle and a goodly army, was
lingering in the hills not far away, purposing to join them as many
feared. Thereon the Prince of Argoed had spoken openly and fervently for
his friend; but the zealots of the camp and envious men were very eager,
and the Emperor's own heart was fevered. Therefore he wrote that even
good service, disobediently done, is of ill augury, and breeds little
trust; and that the murderous ill-worshippers ought not to be met in
battle by hearts or emblems after their own kind. Therefore, he said,
Cian and his people should abandon all that savored of heathendom, or
keep aloof from the holy fight, as best might please them.  
   Llywarch and many more shook their heads forebodingly over this; but
Cian merely obeyed, remaining there, half-way toward the enemy whom he
had meant to assail. But when all was over, and Arthur rested beside the
Dee, he came again into the imperial presence, with a mien of amity and
dignity, yet shadowed and sore at heart. As he stood before the Emperor,
he heard the chanting of the monks in the great monastery of Bangor,
hard by.  
   Arthur eyed him with stern, awaiting composure. "What may be the
desire of Prince Cian?" said he.  
   Cian bowed lowly and gravely, and returned, "I am more than glad of
your great victory, my Emperor, although not permitted to share in
it."  
  
Page 343  
  
   The hurt look and tone touched Arthur. Old battles, and the bearing
of Cian therein, came up in memory.  
   "I named my conditions," he said.  
   "I could not become an apostate," replied the other sadly.  
   Arthur flushed and frowned. "That is no fit word to your Emperor, nor
of his bidding."  
   "There are powers above emperors, and mandates from of old."  
   "There is none greater than the Lord of Life, who died to save us.
There is none greater than the holy mother of God. The apostasy is to
turn from these, from Christian Britain, to that evil altar-worship. And
how know I what treason this may bring upon you? Beware, Prince Cian.
Let what has been show you that the soldiers of Christ need no aid to
conquer any enemy. On whomso that stone falls, it shall grind him to
powder."  
   Cian listened; essayed to speak, with hasty and shaken voice; then
checked himself, and said, with quiet repression,--  
   "It grinds already. Until yesterday there was a shrine by the
Ribble-mouth, a home of song and prayer, offshoot of Mona. Holy men
dwelt there, leading pure lives, breathing the higher mysteries, doing
well by their kind. But their worship was of no new God, nor to the
liking of our Emperor.  
  
Page 344  
  
Now the priests are gone, the walls have tumbled stone over stone, a
black cross marks the spot; and monks howl there, not in adoration, but
in derision."  
   Arthur looked him eye for eye as he spoke, intently, with deepening
anger, though it was his wont to pardon frankness readily. He said
nothing.  
   Cian resumed: "Is this like the Emperor whom I have loved beyond men,
and followed gladly, and served eagerly in every way? Is it not rather
like the dealing of Eschwine with the holy places by the Stour, or as
Ossa Cyllalaur would do, if he could, by the shrine of St. Alban?"  
   Arthur half started up. "There are names which you must not name
together, Prince Cian, if you value your life."  
   "I do not value my life. I value truth. I value justice. Our Emperor
is giving us neither."  
   Arthur shook with passion, but the assured fortitude and quiet
exaltation of the other compelled him to think as well as feel. Also,
these words had ever been the strongest appeal, outside of religion,
which any man could make to him; and the part of the persecutor was both
ill-suited and new.  
   "Go, Cian," he said presently, forcing a smile. "Go, before worse
comes of it. You are the bravest man in Britain. Yet we cannot both
fight heathendom and endure it."  
  
Page 345  
  

CHAPTER XXXVI.  
  
THE FIERY TRIAL OF CIAN.  
  
Arthur of anxious contention.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
CIAN drew off with all his men to his own domain. He would willingly
have dispersed them over his new northern conquest, for the lessening of
suspicion, and to avoid the need of choosing in any dreadful strait. But
this they withstood, feeling the drift of things as surely as he, and
that their own best hope lay in keeping together, and in the tragedy of
his soul.  
   For into tragedy it deepened continually, while both in numbers and
in hostility his gathering grew. All men had learned, with rejoicing or
consternation, that they now had verily an Emperor too militantly
Christian for any truce with unbelievers. Altar after altar went down
where the elder British faith had made its home. Priest after priest,
and proselyte after proselyte, fleeing to their one vale of refuge,
brought Cian the same distressful tale. Doubtless it grew in their
telling; for Arthur was not wilfully cruel, only stern to tyranny in his
new growth of enthu-  
  
Page 346  
  
siasm and sacred duty. The sense of invincibility, too, is an evil
thing, even for the grand in soul.  
   The sufferers and also those who had been with Cian from the first
began to hold him unduly supine, and wanting in spirit. Was it fear of
the tyrant that withheld him? Or weakness of old comradeship unnerving a
more holy fealty? And suddenly the murmurs rose all about him into a
storm of denunciation, for the despoiling hand had swept over Mona. Not
one priest, not one worshipper, remained there, unless hidden in some
sea-cavern or woodland refuge.  
   The priesthood strode in, haggard of face and hot of soul, where Cian
stood dismally; and one spoke bitter words to hear, of the sin and shame
of it, but he answered nothing. Others would have him feel the great
power within his grasp; the victory surely given by the gods that loved
the soil, now wailing abroad like shades of the unburied; the endless
glory awaiting the strong savior of his people. He uttered no word. Then
the most incensed and vehement of them--he who had led the first troop
from the sacred isle, and still bore ever the sword at his side--arose,
and upbraided this recreant champion, with shaking forefinger, to his
face. He upbraided him as flaunter and braggart, flourishing in the
rifled glory of the dead, but daring no single effort in behalf of the
living. "Off with the magic vestment,"  
  
Page 347  
  
he cried. "Let it pass to worthy hands from hands unworthy."  
   Then, while the others grew silent, and looked as men look when more
has come about than they would plan or wish, Cian, very still of mien,
beckoned a lad to lay off his mantle, and take the golden vestment from
about his body, then yielded it as an offering before them, bowing
lowly. Yet, as he rose erect, his breast heaved and heaved again, for he
felt that he could not endure much more.  
   At last a priest arose who spoke gently,--not their eldest, but one
whom all, with reason, revered.  
   "Prince Cian," said he, "it is a woful thing that I should live to
know and feel the bitterness of our people, and that there is no help at
all for them in any crying, even from a man like thee. It matters not
greatly that I, old and poor, who had thought myself unharmful to any
man, should be driven forth from the home where I have dwelt so long.
But, Cian, I swear to you, and lie not, that a hand worse than the
winged dragons of old is stretched above all Britain, and will spare no
grief of heart hereafter unto any, nor leave man, woman, or child in
faith and freedom; and that hand is Arthur's. There is one who sees
wildly, and would have punishment follow all who have clearer eyes; and
that one is Arthur. There is a man whom the gods have made strong, and
the dark powers have made malign, and who  
  
Page 348  
  
uses his strength for the undoing of the feeble; and that man is Arthur.
Also, there is a protector whom men look to, who might withstand and end
all this, if but he would; and that protector is not Arthur."  
   Then Cian groaned aloud.  
   "Truly," said he, "I have no blame for any man thinking as ye think,
and feeling as ye feel. But I hope yet. A cloud may be black as chaos,
yet ever it passes quickly. Not otherwise I deem of the cloud on the
soul of Arthur. I look to see him again the godlike hero, comrade of my
earlier days, fervent in heart, yet compelling none, the bright imperial
champion of our land. Not until in far greater extremity will I sin
against that fealty."  
   They heard him gravely, watching with eyes accustomed to read men,
though the inner fires were distracting. But they forebore troubling him
further; and one whispered, as they went their way, "Yet a little, more
beating of the waves, and the chain will part altogether."  
   Even the zealot who had demanded the golden corselet lifted it again,
with his finger on the mistletoe spray. "We dare not leave the heart
without that sacred enlightening," said he. "Take it again, Defender of
the Mysteries, and may it so work on you that you may know which fealty
is most binding and highest."  
  
Page 349  
  
   None gainsaid the words or the gift. Cian took it again with calm
obeisance.  
   But when they had gone, he was abashed in his own eyes, because this
once he had let his words outrun his vision; for the assurance of better
things indeed eluded him. He had none of that strange revealing which at
times, like the bannered splendors of a winter night, gave illumination
and high uplift of soul. His fond wish and the urgency of great need had
spoken, but little more. A chill fell on him. He did not know; he could
not say.  
   Then revolt rose against that soul of power which once had been his
demigod; not for the wrongs to the weak ones, his brethren only, but his
own bitterer wrong of the heart's devotion ill-requited. He clutched his
sword-hilt, with a curse on the blind bigotry that could so deform the
first of men, and most of all, on the poisonous instigator, Oisin. Then
the dead evangelist rose in fancy before him, as on the lawn of
Constantine's now ruined villa, or leaning from the gallery of the great
council-hall, or springing kestrel-like at the great Eschwine on the
platform of the lake-village palisade,--bitter, dark, narrow, ecstatic,
but ever well-willing toward his kind, and faithful unto death. And
shame swept him that one so blind should yet be such a brand for burning
truth into men, while he, Cian, with all the illumination of an elder
day, could only doubt  
  
Page 350  
  
and waver in a passion of torment. Yet thought with thought, and hope
with dread, strove in him; and nothing was done.  
   While in such moods he had a letter from Llywarch, warning, yet
reassuring for the time, and threaded with uneasy instinct of pleading
for the great leader, as knowing him deeply in blame. Arthur, it said,
had been minded to go with force against Cian; but better counsels had
prevailed, all the more for the soft urgency of Guinevere, now awaiting
her Emperor and the nuptial day at Camelot. Half angry with himself,
half mirthful that one so eager could be justly chided for tarrying, the
Emperor had flown southward, with all other wrath in abeyance. There
could be no sort of danger until his return after a fitting season.
Meanwhile, the writer adjured his friend to take peaceably and of free
will such steps as would avoid all later harshness and clashing.  
   Now, this menace of attack had been floating, with no clear outline,
in Cian's mind; but to hear it thus from another, although his best
friend and in exceeding kindness, awoke him into sudden resentment.
What, then! it was no more than a chance, the petulant message of a
light-loving woman, that Arthur's blade had not busied itself with his
household already. Even now, what safety?--with the sword held suspended
until the marriage kiss were  
  
Page 351  
  
given, the cheek of Guinevere the only shield between his heart and his
Emperor's deadly blow!  
   There should be no disbandment. He, Cian, was but in his right as a
freeman of the hills; and among them he would make it good, with those
who followed him. Facing the fighting life of the land, it might be that
the all-conquering one would first learn a limit to his career. However
that might be, those who looked to Cian for shelter must not be turned
forth into the blast of tyranny while he could bar the door for them.  
   Therefore he went about with a settled and resolute face among his
people, taking hands with firm clasp which had long been impotently
clutching. Also he sent abroad for a yet greater muster and supplies of
every kind from every city within call or bidding, and in the forging of
arms all artisans were kept busy.

CHAPTER XXXVII.  
  
AURELIA AT CAMELOT.

  
THE shadow of death lay on Aurelia, as on all when the dearly loved ones
pass away, with gradual lightening. This did not seem so at first; but
the pain recurred in waves or throbs, like all else of outer or inner
world-life, each seeming not less than those before it, with blankness
between. The work that she drove herself to, and held herself to, irked
her greatly; but, excepting at the very first, she did not in any degree
fail or shrink. She was aware of kind faces that felt for her, and the
bright things in earth and air and heaven which had been her pleasure;
but all such touched her now as on the surface only, not deeply
stirring.  
   So, too, she thought not, in the very beginning, on Arthur or Cian,
or any grievance or affection, beyond her first yearning to lean and be
strengthened, when she knew that the Prince had passed on his northward
way. Later, she heard the tale of their doings in broken fragments
brought haphazard overland. What went most against her therein was the
rumor that men spoke ill of Cian's good faith,  
  
Page 353  
  
holding his cloud of armed men to be a real menace on the northern
border, and deeming that the Emperor must needs fall upon him to abate
it; though mostly her London people were of more gentle judgment. For
they had forgotten neither the stoutness of Cian's shield, nor the
weight of Arthur's mailed hand. Aurelia listened to all, wearying her
soul, doubting what to do; and in the midst of her doubt came the
bidding to the imperial nuptials at Camelot. Eager to render all honor,
and hoping also for her opportunity, she departed thither with a great
train.  
   She found before her, and coming in daily, many more of high
degree--lords of provinces, and city rulers, commanders of great
fortresses like that on the height of Sorbiodunum, left over by Rome or
the giants. Kings were some styled, others chiefs, or consuls, or
princes, but it mattered little. All manner of wealth and sumptuousness
came with them, and a prodigious throng of people, but not so very many
fighting-men; for, after Cerdic's mishaps in the west, and the long
peace on that southern border, there was no thought of molestation.  
   Yet, when Aurelia looked abroad in that marvellous and glowing town,
an old memory came to her, a tale of the days of Hengist. Never since
the great feast of the Long Knives had there been such a
banquet-gathering of British leadership as here; and otherwise the lure
was far more tempting than  
  
Page 354  
  
in that day of feast and slaughter. Then she blessed the two good
legions which Arthur still held about him, and the sufficient store of
arms in that hill city; and so took heart again. Yet she felt the burden
of warning upon her.  
   It was not easy to find speech with the Emperor; but one bright noon
on a tower of his palace castle, watching him come from Guinevere and
seek the battlement, she drew near doubtfully, and uttered what was in
mind. He woke from his meditation with gentle greeting, but at first
gave seemingly no more heed nor weight than courtesy compelled. She
paused a moment. He swept his glance over the pinnacled riot of strange
beauty that filled the plateau, and went overflowing down the great cone
of the hill beneath them on every side--rainbow walls, and scroll-work
carven forms, and faceted jewelry of architecture sparkling in the sun.
Standards flaunted here and there, marvellous in device and gorgeous in
hue, the bright figures on them moving with the wind as if alive. Away
below all wound the triple wall-girdle, earthen, broad and high, with
solid front of masonry, sentinels walking their rounds on the level
crest of every belt, and many armed men stretched at ease along the
slopes and terraces between. All the streets were thrilling and humming
with gay, multitudinous human life.  
   It was a scene such as no other ruler could have  
  

  
"She Drew Near Doubtfully."

  
Page 355  
  
looked down upon; such, indeed, as not Britain itself could furnish
elsewhere. For here was naught of Rome and her white. ancient majesty,
the life of a far time still slowly dreaming away. Its glory was of the
young Celtic exuberance, warm, gay, and vital; of baffling conceptions,
mystic yet impulsively human and not yet wholly at ease without or
within. Power was there, and will and waywardness, earnest zeal and
ecstatic daring; above all, a surpassing and exalted wizardry. For
Camelot was the city of Arthur, and the city of Merlin.  
   "It may well tempt them," said he; "but if the kernel be rare, the
shell will endure some hammering.  
   "The walls of Vortimer the Great," answered she, "are Saxon ground
to-day."  
   He watched her face gravely. "It would be ill for any kind guest of
ours to suffer disquiet. Is there new cause for it?  
   "No. Yet Cerdic has a great force, which may grow quickly. And it is
near, while your armies are far away. Would it not be well to summon
them? All of my kingdom, at least, are at command."  
   Arthur smiled. "They would scarce bar Cerdic; and London, too, must
be guarded."  
   "Then--Lancelot?"  
   "Suppose that has been tried. Some things are hard to understand."  
  
Page 356  
  
   "What!--then there have been warnings before?" He bowed.  
   "And Maelgwn--Lancelot--will not come?"  
   "He offers reasons. There may be more force in them than one can
see."  
   "The warning has most force, my Emperor. I pray you send with all
speed to the army near Caer Ligion."  
   "Unhappily, a great part must be left to watch Prince Cian, whom I
trusted more than any other of old."  
   Her face flushed. "I am sure that is needless." Then a spirit, half
saucy, half resentful, moved her to cry aloud. "How easily a great
commander may be taken in a snare!"  
   He looked surprise, then laughed. "Your Emperor was not the commander
this time," and she knew he meant the summoning letter of Guinevere.  
   "But," he added, "I will call Llywarch to me, with every man that he
may safely bring. And to ease you, dear lady, all nearer forces of town
and country shall be summoned. Meanwhile, we are not defenceless, and
Cerdic has rarely prospered in his dealings with me. I shall hardly
resign my bride, or vary either time or ceremonial for any uproar of
heathendom."

CHAPTER XXXVIII.  
  
HOW SANAWG WAS THE SUMMONER OF CIAN.  
  
Like the roaring of the wind against the ashen spears.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
LLYWARCH of Argoed was idling in camp among the Saxon-demolished ruins
of a fair town which once had been the capital of the Sistuntii, later
to be known as Blackrode. One or two of the chief dwellings, in the
Roman style, remained habitable; and the best had been restored and
brightened for his use. All manner of pictured gayety was around him,
glimpses of a sunny world came through every window; but the Prince of
Argoed was dull enough, and more than dull, for Sanawg, his wife, had
been left far away in Caerleon, Cian, his friend, was yet an outlaw of
the mountains, and he could think of no good thing under heaven for an
active, lonely man to do.  
   Musing thus, he saw two mounted figures come over the open land, very
wearily, yet as though in urgent haste; and others behind them, as men
will join in the wake of vital news heard by the way. As they stopped at
the outer guard, there was a great  
  
Page 358  
  
stir and murmur throughout the whole spread of the camp; and by the same
instinct Llywarch also knew at once that he was summoned to life and
hardship again. At that his soul leaped up through its shadows; but he
held himself with courteous gravity, to hear their say.  
   One was Arthur's messenger from Camelot. The other, from Caradoc's
fortified sanctuary town of Amesbury, with more deadly urgency of need,
had overtaken him as he rode and ran. For already the Saxon flood was
between these neighboring holds; and out of it, like an island, rose the
splendid hill-city of Arthur, which might not long abide that dashing.
Yet no breach had been made as yet, nor any grievous loss undergone. The
whole great cone of walls and houses bloomed out defiantly in many
colored banners; wherefore, and remembering its other gorgeousness, men
called this, long after, the battle of the painted hill.  
   But all knew that no one beside a few men from Silchester could have
re-enforced Arthur's garrison; and there was great consternation
everywhere for his sake, as well as that of the notable men and women
who were with him, and the bright, entrapped lady Guinevere, chosen to
empire, whom Cerdic, if he won the town, would certainly take for his
own.  
   Llywarch put questions as to number and armament, then dismissed
these messengers to their food  
  
Page 359  
  
and rest, and sent orders forth to make all ready for swift motion. Also
he called a council to meet an hour later, and walked abroad,
meditating.  
   Then, more than another time, he felt the need of Sanawg, smiling at
himself therefor as a commander of men. Yet he is but poor of spirit who
finds no peculiar wisdom in the one woman he has chosen; and here there
were problems of the human soul, more than all else, to consider. Had he
not Arthur's direct command to leave men enough behind him for guarding
against Cian? Yet of what avail to Camelot would be a moiety of his
army? If only Cian, instead, were assuredly with him as of old? Must
there be, indeed, another and more dreadful Anderida? Then, like glint
of hope, came the thought of Sanawg again; and, when he regained his
room, another rider had come and gone, leaving a letter from her behind.
There was much in it, much that was dear and thoughtful; but two words
alone stood out insistently. They were,--"Trust Cian."  
   With the sense of prevision made good upon him cogently, he wrote and
sent this messsage. "Cian, old comrade, your Emperor, Arthur, is
surrounded at Camelot. Come with all your men. I take the road to-day
with mine." And when the council gathered, although there were some that
demurred, the most thought it more than well; for no strength might
safely be foregone in that great wrestle, and  
  
Page 360  
  
it was better to risk all at once, with the chance of mending all, than
to falter into sure destruction.  
   He found less pleasing matter in her words of Lancelot. "He looks
reckless and fitful, the mien of one tormented until somewhat be ended
and over. And, although he has a great array of men here, largely those
who love him first of all, he meets every summoning of the Emperor with
some slight plea, and stirs not a foot to his aid." Clearly, she too
felt the danger, though she knew not the storm had broken.  
   Cian was waiting, longing, doubting, sadly foreseeing war with his
best friends, and ruin from those who should chiefly prize him, when
Llywarch's brief message came. It could not have been more deftly
moulded. Its utter unreasoning trust awoke consoling music in his heart.
"Come, Cian!" and forthwith Cian came.  
   His men were ready--for somewhat. Out among them went his word that
all should take the road within the hour. In among the priests and
leaders he went himself, with a rapt intensity of vehemence that hurried
them all away. He made no secret of his aim; and those who had so lately
been infuriated with Arthur willingly took it as their own. For they
also had latent in them that wayward magnanimity, which is the best
heritage of their race, and it awakened suddenly. Nor was there any love
for the  
  
Page 361  
  
Saxon in their hearts. Moreover, the dourest of them was quick to see
that Arthur saved by them must be Arthur their foe no longer.  
   All hastened, but away before the first whirled Cian and a hundred
chariots; and, though Llywarch went fast also with less distance before
him, they were together again amid the gay streets and glittering roofs
of Wroxetor by the base of the Dinrle Wrecon. At Gloucester, that rich
city of Vortigern, Sanawg met them, with radiance of the Orient, and
bantering and kisses for her kindly obedient lord. In less time than
ever host fled so far, they were, with more than half their men, about
Caer Caradoc.

CHAPTER XXXIX.  
  
THE LONG BATTLE OF CAMELOT.  
  
A wide multitude of Lloegyr went to sleep with the light in their
eyes.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
THE sudden eclipse had come like a miracle of the Evil One upon Aurelia
and all others in Camelot. Her anxious forecast had not fancied anything
like environment without warning. Even her own hastily summoned
Londoners had not been in time. On distant hill-tops she could discern
uneasy clusters and masses of men whom those about her discerned for
friends, willing, but too feeble. There were signal lights also in the
darker hours, but not to rival the havoc fires raised by the Saxon
wherever a home had been. Whether by night or day, all the nearer world
was Cerdic's, who this once had out-Arthured Arthur in the celerity and
amplitude of his onfall.  
   Rebelling against isolation, the hemmed-in city sent forth its
messages to the eye in many ways. Aurelia added a fantasy of her own,
working swiftly in bright large embroidery the silver mistletoe on a
ground of gold--crude and large-wrought as meant  
  
Page 363  
  
for far seeing, but legible to all eyes that knew. This she held forth
in sunshine, yet withal cautiously, not knowing how far the Emperor
would pardon even new a bid for Cian's aid.  
   But it was not in her to keep quite still. When she looked below and
around, at the great encompassing of armed strength and hate, when she
heard their never-ending shouts of insult and triumph, and the recurring
waves of furious uproar about the lower wall,--her heart turned faint;
then, wakening, cried out keenly for that other heart which had been by
her in beleaguerment before. Then she had not feared, nor shown, even to
herself, any weakening. Had the charge and care been hers, she would
have risen to the task again. But now she had leisure and freedom to
feel all the peril of that one city, wrongfully left in it alone. It
grew monstrous to her that any one should have doubt of Cian. She saw in
him salvation.  
   One morning, at this her task, she filled in person, statuewise, a
jutting bit of the castellated rampart, which made a coronal on Arthur's
palace-roof. No sentry was there now, the men being all sorely needed.
She could see very plainly from her niche what rough handling had been
given the great lower earth-wall. More of bristling rubbish was there
now--every sort thrown hurriedly in to fill the gaps--than sod or soil
or masonry facing. Even dead  
  
Page 364  
  
Saxons, in their armor, hung over it, or dangled down the sides, limp
and obstructive; amid the broken pottery and cart-wheels and stones. The
night's bloody irruption and expulsion had left also another record in
many dark, gleaming spots and streaks between wall and wall. That space
glittered vigilantly with British steel; for, though there was brief
quiet after such long and savage endeavor, the enemy already began to
heave and thrill again, as if to throw a new wave of men on that
persistent barrier.  
   Caradoc, in especial, was watching them, as ever since dawn, from
beside what had been the northern gate, his massive arm thrown
listlessly about a battered pillar, and obviously swollen yet more by
recent effort. From its top, on a short staff, a banner blew abroad
which he used on great occasions only,--a ground of imperial purple, the
still conquering eagle of Rome, silver-white thereon, as became the
scion of the last British-Roman Emperor and the great Aurelius
Ambrosius. Body-weighted that heroic soul might be, yet was it almost
more than humanly untiring. There was something tenderly admiring in
Aurelia's sigh, as she thought, "Even Caradoc is aweary."  
   At a sound behind her, she turned, and met Arthur's inquiring eye,
which had been on the banner of the mistletoe. For a moment the full
glare of astonished suspicion was in it, but for one minute  
  
Page 365  
  
only. Then he smiled, and shook his head. "Well meant, undoubtedly,"
said he, adding, with relief, as he walked away, "I believe women are
all alike in some things."  
   She stared over these last words, half guessing a partnership in
fault with Guinevere. Long after, she learned that this was true; the
golden-haired empress-to-be, in her terror over barbarian capture,
having flaunted all manner of wild signalling toward the watchers of her
Lancelot, knowing well by appointment where they should be. Arthur had
come suddenly by chance on this discovery, worn with long night combat,
and sore from wounds, which he had taken like any common fighter,
likewise unnerved and shaken in the revulsion from exceeding effort. He
could not read her signs, but he read the look of her face as of
something that she would gladly cover; and his words had heat and
sternness in them. But Guinevere, rallying, cried indignantly that she
was but striving to save herself and everyone from that dreadful Saxon,
who, for all Arthur had shown himself able to do, was likely to end
Camelot and the marriage his own way. At that heart-thrust, the Emperor
held his peace, and strode away, only to find the second woman of his
thought doing likewise. And the very first ebb of feeling was toward
gratitude that she had thereby answered his latent yearning for some
extenuation or defence of Guinevere.  
  
Page 366  
  
   Meanwhile, the sunny-haired goddess of Devon wept over him and her
ruined plans and her approaching fate. However versatile and fertile in
expedient, however ready to turn from man to man, she could not bear to
be taken by a Saxon--the very were-wolf of the human race. For the
moment she could wish her ambitions blown away like bubbles, and herself
hidden safely in some mountain stronghold of Lancelot. But anger rose
against him likewise, as she called to mind that he certainly would not
come in time to save these nuptials, caring not at all to save her from
Cerdic for Arthur; and, it might be, fancying a prospect of some compact
with the former, whereby he might gain her yet. But as to this outcome
Guinevere herself could have no hope, well knowing (and for the first
time sadly) what power was in her beauty. Cerdic, once the winner, would
no more part with her than with his heart-beats.  
   Arthur descended to join Caradoc on guard, reasoning that he could
scarce fare worse at any male hands than he had, aloft, at fairer ones
already. But, when he told his tribulations, the laughter of that large
man was very restful. "Let them wave, let them signal," quoth he. "But
these pirates of Wessex will give us more serious work before long. They
stick to it, I'll say that; and there are enough of them. Great heaven,
if only some one would  
  
Page 367  
  
come--Llywarch or Lancelot or Cian, St. Michael or the Devil!"  
   Plainly Caradoc, for all his reckless good humor, was growing
thoughtful; an ill portent, as the Emperor felt and knew. He lay down
under it, and slept, until the awakening onset called them to fierce
toil again.  
   On that day and other days the two queenly women signalled, Aurelia
openly now, and with clear mind, the other fitfully and half secretly,
as if forgetting that all were aware. There was no answer to either; and
most likely their flashes and tokens reached only half-armed ploughmen
or other stolid hoverers, who lacked the wit to decipher the message, if
not the will to speed it on its way.  
   Arthur saw little of them, though sometimes coming in some
breathing-space of the fight, for a kiss from Guinevere. Aurelia now and
then went to him below, or within sight and hail, rendering womanly aid
to the wounded not far from the crossing of spears. There was a frank
comradeship between them, in their slight and hurried intercourse, both
having seemingly quite forgotten that there might possibly once have
been more. It tantalized Guinevere even in danger, and so little before
her wedding-day, so that she came distrustfully nearer the
blood-spattering than she could otherwise have been drawn, and had even
some share also in the blessings of the  
  
Page 368  
  
defenders. Other women of noble station, penned in that hill-city, where
savage incessant battle made the chief bride-music, were also
steadfastly ministering.  
   The circuit of defence was lessening; for, in one vast inrush, the
Saxons had mastered the lowest wall, and held it long enough to tear the
eastern half quite away. So, though at last they were driven off, the
labor seemed too great; and it was thought wise to withdraw behind the
second line, and throw up a new one close under the eaves of the town.  
   The wedding, as intended, was then two days away; and all agreed in
clinging to the set scheme of things as though no enemy were
near,--Aurelia, because there could be no better encouragement of the
defenders; Guinevere, because it sealed her triumph if rescue should
reach them, and to have been an empress, though but for an hour, could
not make her lot the worse with Cerdic; Arthur, by reason of dominant
will and real impatient love; Caradoc, to please them all, and show the
dogged Saxon a something in British pride more dogged still.  
   Nevertheless, what had been the second ring of earthwork was torn
from them the very night before the marriage-day; and all through the
morning the struggle was desperate over the outer one of the two which
remained, in the eagerness of the invader to break through before the
ceremony, and seize the bride. But at noon it still held, and Caradoc
said,--  
  
Page 369  
  
   "Emperor or no, a bridegroom is a bridegroom. Don your fine feathers,
my Emperor. I will stand them off yet a while, and let the priests and
processionizers work their will on you."  
   "But we shall need you to give away the bride."  
   "Oh, anybody will fight for me those few moments. Hammered mail must
be my wedding-garment. Hasten!"  
   Then Arthur, smiling as a commander who finds it arch to obey, went
quickly up into the town. More stress and strain of care went with him
than ever with a man before on what should be his happiest day.  
   Yet the whooping uproar for which he listened came not then, nor even
later, when festal figures in diverse bravery wound through the streets,
gorgeous even in distant view, and every bell in Camelot rang out
defiantly the coming of the bride. There were those, women chiefly, who
rejoiced aloud that the Saxons were too cowed to venture more that day.
Arthur looked grave; then all foreboding was lost in the loveliness
trembling beside him. But it was no maiden tremor of Guinevere, nor any
doubt of her matronly future. Even as they passed up the great cathedral
aisle, her terror broke in a cry, and she clung to him as with a spasm;
for a more hideous din than ever before--shrill, outlandish,
multitudinously jangled--had that moment broken forth also. It verily
beat at wall and window and door,  
  
Page 370  
  
rising, as they stood before the prelate, with indescribable change and
accession and keen metallic resonances.  
   The Emperor, clutching hard his sword-hilt, half turned from bride
and altar, then held himself there perforce with a groan, bidding every
man leave them with all speed. He bade also the service go on; for
doubtless, when the proper time should come, there would be one to give
away the bride. Also from minute to minute he listened, elate that the
sound came no nearer, but seemed rather to stay and sway.  
   With the outpealing of the first chant a message came from Caradoc,
by one no longer fit for any fighting, but who stumbled as he came, that
the prince might not leave quite yet, but would surely be there soon,
despite Saxon and Devil.  
   Aurelia, not far away, made one step toward the man as he fell; then,
leaving that service to others, where women were so plentiful, swept
down the aisle and through the door to somewhat that was less easy. Her
eye, weapon-seeking, was on the ground, as she sped over the level crest
and down the hill. Midway sprawled a dead soldier in a doorway, and,
leaning on his great axe beside him, another, yet alive. "Let me lift
you to a better prop, and yield me this," she said kindly with quick
words. "I will strike good blows for you."  
   Feeling her health and strength, he said weakly,  
  
Page 371  
  
"I well believe it." Without more, she shifted him gently, and went on
very fast, the great axe in her hand, the memory of her old wolf-combat
bracing her,--a true battle-goddess.  
   Into the belt of combat she swept at the first opening. By chance it
was the part where was the hottest fighting--and Prince Caradoc. Always
furious at hand-to-hand, he was trebly so now, for that these
assailants, numerous as swarming ants and far more full of venom, would
by no means leave him one moment for kinder duties. That drove him quite
beside himself. Yet still, unconsidering, an ever-renewed surge of
spearmen and axemen and swordsmen was thrown up against the wall, to be
beaten down again; or quite upon the summit, to be toppled back
headlong; or even over it, into the bloody lane behind where he must
smite and smite, before driving them to earth or their fellows.  
   But now there was a great, full, passionate call in a voice of music;
and a form such as had never been seen in such a fray swept by him,
carrying the breath of victory. All bright with gold and scarlet she was
from crown to skirt-rim, glittering keenly with gems, and swaying with
bare, perfect arms the gleaming weapon about her head. The men shouted
at her coming as they shouted for the coming of Arthur; and their rush
upon the Saxons was such as could come only from the strength of a
stimulant new in  
  
Page 372  
  
kind. She glanced at Caradoc once only as she went by; and even he,
though not apt at any reading, knew what was to be done.  
   "Who has your place?" demanded Arthur, as the panting giant stood
before him.  
   "Either a she-archangel," gasped Caradoc, "or the London Queen
Aurelia."  
   That passed for his brightest utterance, his only epigram, outwrung
by very stress of wind and weather. More he said, also, in due form, as
ritual demanded, then sped back to his post.  
   Later, when the wedded pair had left altar for palace, came word from
him that all went well; that his angel of destruction had withdrawn a
little, after the greatest beating back of men that ever was seen,
without herself quite shedding the blood of any; and that matters would
indeed have come to a sad pass if Caradoc, whom men had called good for
something, could not secure a little peace and quiet for his niece and
her husband on their wedding-day.  
   Then Arthur laughed openly at the great fighter's ideal of repose,
with all that screaming and hooting of demons on every side. He had no
mind to profit by the strong-hearted kindliness of his friend. But
Guinevere clung to him, and besought him; not greatly in love,--though
he thought so,--but chiefly in mere dread and tremor. Fear touched him,
too, for her sake, left alone. Lingering, drawn  
  
Page 373  
  
and held, he passed up with her where they could view the lower scene.  
   There had been a lull; but now the tumult awoke again at its worst,
and the setting sun struck across men and spears, swarming and
counter-swarming. Red jewels were smitten out where they leaped
together. On the house-tops, close to the last wall, women were bringing
hastily every kind of missile, for use when that final need should come.
All round the circle the battle stormed, but at the north it was still
the fiercest; and here he came soon to know a new wave, and very great
in the sea of onset, the royal banner of Cerdic tossing on before.  
   He saw that wave sweep up with a great heaving rush that lifted
banner and king and many chosen champions, through friend and enemy,
clean over the earthwork. He saw Caradoc rush to the spot, and struggle
valiantly, with more thronging to aid him, yet in spite of all, yielding
little by little. He saw Aurelia and the few fighting-men whom she had
held in reserve hasten into the midst. He tore himself rudely from
Guinevere, and dashed recklessly down the stairway, that he might bear
his part. Bitter self-blame was in his soul for his dallying, but this
had all come about nearly in the twinkling of an eye.  
   At the palace-door one greeted him to say that Caradoc was sorely
wounded; that Aurelia bade him come forthwith, if he would ever be of
use.  
  
Page 374  
  
   Hardly a sound reached him from the eastern slope. Hurrying thither,
he found that the assault had dwindled, being mainly withdrawn to aid
Cerdic. He called back a part of his men to the inner wall, where they
would count as more in number, being brought nearer together and
re-enforced by missiles from above; then, with the remainder and all
whom he could gather on the way, he sped around the curve to that
ever-widening semicircle of combat about the inbulging mass of Saxons,
and the tossing of the White Horse standard.  
   He passed Caradoc, helmetless, and bound with bloody white over the
brow, yet unsteadily endeavoring to get forward and join the battle. He
heard the glad welcoming call of Aurelia. Then way was made for him, and
he came face to face with Cerdic.  
   A doughty man was the West Saxon king, as many a hot battle, whether
lost or won, might tell--red of hair, red and pitted in the face, red in
the gnarled long arms, left bare for greater freedom of stroke. No giant
in size like Caradoc,--whom yet he had felled with one ringing blow a
few minutes before,--but very strongly knitted and sinewy in lean
ungainliness. Less than Arthur in mind, as far lower in soul, but
formidable in every wise. Perverse, grim, cruel; a man to let nothing
bar his way.  
   He greeted his enemy with a taunt thanking him for the bride that had
been won, and thereupon sprang  
  
Page 375  
  
and smote with his great double-handed axe more like some hairy wild man
of the woods than a fighting king. But, if his weapon were the heavier
and his crude strength the greater, he had not Arthur's alert and
surpassing skill; and fell as was his heart that moment, it yet lacked
the other's white-hot fire. For a brief time there was a whirling medley
of thrust and stroke, the other combatants tossing and jarring against
them, destroying all sureness of aim. Then the point of Arthur's sword
whipped into Cerdic's right arm below the shoulder; and, as the
battle-axe dropped, a slash brought the Saxon to the ground. It was a
swift, hard blow, though it could not have full swing in that press; and
Cerdic lay on elbow, as, if dazed, with his helmet well dented in. The
blood came streaming down into his eyes, and Arthur forbore.  
   Then the cry of that deed went every way through the mass; and many
made desperate pressure to seize or save the fallen king, so that there
was very savage fighting over him for a time. But Arthur called off whom
he could, feeling well rid of Cerdic and his following, if only they
were in mind to go. As to these, they cared for nothing but the saving
of their leader. Thus ended that chiefest onslaught. The outer wall was
manned again.  
   Arthur drew near in the early twilight to where Caradoc was
reclining, Aurelia sitting by him. The  
  
Page 376  
  
mighty man, enfeebled now, arose, and took his hand.  
   "You see how it has fared with me," said Caradoc, "for fancying that
the defence could endure, even an hour, without its soul and its
captain."  
   "Its captain bids you go and be properly tended," answered Arthur
pleasantly, "and that our strong angel of London supervise the
tending."  
   Aurelia smiled and said, "All must obey our Emperor. But I am not
greatly tired, nor hurt at all--they have taken such care of me. And
there are so few of us now."  
   "True," answered he sadly. The dead and the dying were all about
them, often richly apparelled as they had come from the bridal, with not
a moment to spare. Noble, even royal, blood had been poured out like
water in that last rally for the very life of the town, which so nearly
failed. "We must withdraw to our last wall, here as elsewhere," he
added. "When all else is done, you may come to me again."  
   Aurelia turned after Caradoc, but hesitated. "With the Empress?" she
suggested.  
   "It will not affront her," answered he. "She is too tender for such
as this. I ought never to have brought it about her."  
   Yet, as Aurelia went up the hill, she could but feel with pity how he
thought not of turning to Guinevere his bride for any help in trouble.

CHAPTER XL.  
  
HOW CIAN SAVED ARTHUR FROM CERDIC.  
  
With Arthur of anxious contention  
With Arthur a splendid labor.        
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
IT was black and late when Aurelia groped her way again to the Emperor.
A stifling weight of cloud left no crevice for starlight. Even the lamps
and tapers of the hill were unseen, being mainly in deep inner recesses,
where the work of weapon-hunting or treasure-hiding still went on. The
great Saxon encampment was also a wilful darkness. Away here and there,
some hill-top, itself unseen, bore its one hazy glimmer, where camp-fire
or burning home had died down. The universe had gone into mere blankness
and mourning.  
   There was silence, too, save for sounds of mere menace and pain;
sometimes a keen, irrepressible cry as of stabbing, or some tragic
mystery; sometimes a brief mocking trill from a night-bird out and
below, broken by a nearer groan. Also, with close listening, a blended
under-murmur, which might have been of the feeble night-wind only.  
   Arthur was dozing, utterly outworn, with his back  
  
Page 378  
  
against the palace-wall of a lesser Cornish king, one of many who had
built mansions about and below that of their great king of kings, in
this new border capital. But he came to life at Aurelia's low call
beside him, and answered cheerily. Also he heard by effort, with clear
mind, all that she had to tell. She made inquiry in turn, and he
answered,  
   "One whom I sent forth brings word that Cerdic is yet alive, and
rallying in strength, and swearing to have his revenge before another
day. If he cannot lead, the White Horse will come on with young Cenric.
It may be we can snatch that banner--before quite losing life."  
   He spoke with the calmness that comes of exhaustion and dark, lonely
musing.  
   She held her peace, casting about for words. He spoke again, with
little more of thrill or color. "Who would say that I, who have foiled
many, should at the last be thus trapped and taken? That I also, who
have loved and lifted so many friends, should live to feel all melt from
him save only one or two? Ah me! I fear that Arthur has not been the man
of his belief and thought, nor so just as he once hoped to be, nor so
diffident of his tread where every foot should be unclad."  
   Her heart stirred, not unhopefully, though with pity, at these words.
She did not need the telling that, in spite of continued triumph and
splendor, he  
  
Page 379  
  
had not lately been quite the great Arthur of earlier days. No one had
first feared it, and then felt it, more strongly than she. And now the
cup of calamity was brimming over in a flood. If only his blindness
should not have been washed away too late!  
   She had no word of excuse to offer, nor any of condemnation.  
   "You are overworn, my Emperor," she said very gently. "Sleep, while I
watch over you. I trust there may be new hope in the awakening."  
   Even yet, behind their last bulwark, on the very eve of ruin and
slaughter, her faith clung fitfully to the coming of Cian.  
   "You are wonderful, Aurelia," answered the Emperor drowsily. "But
this is not the place where you should be."  
   Her cheeks burned in the darkness. Was there ever so unheard-of a
part to take as hers, the guardian companion of another woman's
bridegroom on his wedding-night? Just how should it be expounded and
exemplified to Prince Cian?  
   The stress of these thoughts both hardened and stung her. "Shall "I
bring Guinevere--if she will come?"  
   Arthur half groaned, impatiently. "Let her remain in safety," said
he.  
   "Caradoc, then?"  
  
Page 380  
  
   "He has undergone enough and more, considering what may yet await
him."  
   She spoke again, with a smile in her voice.  
   "Then surely it must be me. I shall mount the wall, and watch there,
first making some of our good fellows clear a little space for me."  
   With a sleepy, "God bless you, Aurelia!" he lay back, and passed at
once out of consciousness.  
   Later, men averred that this wedding-time of the great Arthur was
such a thing as never had been, nor would ever be again in all the
earth.  
   It seemed but a moment before he started up with the sense of being
stirred and shaken. All was black still, though in truth they were near
dawn. He could not discern any outline, but he knew Aurelia's voice.  
   "They are coming. They are near."  
   He was on his feet, hurrying to the wall, his men rousing on every
side already.  
   "Caradoc?" he inquired.  
   "He was the first sent for." She whispered on as they peered and
listened; "It was but just now. I had watched a long time. I was drowsy.
Then something startled me; and I knew it was the noise of stumbling,
well down the hill. At once I became sure of men at the other wall,
where they may have thought some of ours to be. Hark!"  
   A forward stir, yet nearer, was distinguishable now. Doubtless there
had been a pause of uncer-  
  
Page 381  
  
tainty, but they were coming on all together. With faint scraping,
Arthur struck a light, holding it city-ward. At the signal, other lights
awoke along the palace-front behind them, and a dozen fire-arrows leaped
out from the windows over their heads into the open space between the
walls, each with its train of burning tow.  
   One, chance-guided, lit, for a moment, the fringe of Cerdic's great
banner, and stabbed in the face a pikeman who came close behind,
bringing him to the ground, all aflame. The other arrows pinned the
ground only, but lighted unevenly the whole scene for the archers and
slingers. Fast and thick the missiles came. Man after man went down;
first, as they shrank from this sudden illumining, then, as they cast
all secrecy aside, and came leaping, pitching, butting forward, in every
attitude, with every kind of yell. Spears darted from the wall, and some
of the foremost fell forward; others caught at the flying missiles, or
snatched them from the ground, and paused a moment to hurl them back.
Yet the mass made no halt, until an indescribable great rain of all
manner of things, weighty and hot and pointed,--even shattering jars of
boiling oil, even vessels trailing out pennons of burning tar, viscid
and clinging,--descended on them from the housetops.  
   Then, indeed, there was a little check. Twice the standard-bearer
tumbled to earth, and another took  
  
Page 382  
  
his place. Once young Cenric was tripped, and thrown amid the press,
barely escaping death from the feet of his own men. And as here, so it
was quite round the circuit of Camelot, only in lesser degree. But soon
there was spear-thrusting and sword-reaching across the barrier; and the
throng momently grew denser against its outer face, being even shielded
in a measure by nearness to those within. At intervals one, two, or a
dozen would spring or clamber up, or seemingly be hurled from behind or
below, and hold some part of the top for a moment.  
   "The same old game!" cried Caradoc, sweeping his battle-axe into the
face of one of these, and guarding, with strokes and thrusts, the place
where that enemy had been. The need of the hour had brought his strength
back again for a time. "But I tire of it," he exclaimed pettishly.
"Where, then, is Llywarch--or Lancelot, or Cian?"  
   The fire-arrows had burned out; but they were not fighting in
darkness, for there was a faint glimmer through the cloud-curtains which
held back the day. The wind blew higher and higher, and seemed to reach
even those upper regions, for they thinned perceptibly. The wounded saw
it where they lay, with upward-looking faces; and Aurelia saw it, as,
withdrawn a little, she peered and strained in momently weakening hope,
and rush of dread. But the men in combat could not see, until the
curtain  
  
Page 383  
  
broke away suddenly, and the world was given to all eyes.  
   It was in the very midst of the most determined attack. Three score
Saxons were on the wall in one place, holding together; half a score
already inside, fighting forward. Every moment brought others leaping
down, and yet others tumbling up into their places. Then came a glad
outcry from the roofs and windows, "Look! Cian! Cian of the Chariots!"
Aurelia, springing to a higher foothold, called aloud, "It *is* Cian
indeed! Thank God!"  
   The Saxons on the wall saw too; while those within, who could not
see, but caught their cries and glances, divined it all, and made
frantic efforts to reach them. This, indeed, Cenric, with one more,
really did, the rest falling by the way under the reinvigorated swords
or spears that struck into them. All pitched out together, and went
streaming down the hill, with the half-ordered rout of their comrades,
to meet a more formidable onset. Arthur and Caradoc were over and after
them, with many followers, unrelenting, shouting abroad in their glee.  
   For there could no longer be a moment's doubt of the issue. The
Saxons, though so near winning the town, had suffered wofully in thus
often assailing a brave enemy strongly posted. The new British force
that now came sweeping on them in a crescent was really beyond their
remaining strength, and seemed  
  
Page 384  
  
more overwhelming still. The cloud-prolonging of the night had brought
Cian and Llywarch very near them unseen; and now that light was needed
for a ruinous stroke, it came swiftly and amply. Llywarch led one wing,
Cuneglasse, the stripling grandson of old Edyrn, the other; Cian filled
the centre with his chariots, fighting-men in great numbers riding
behind. All were below the nearer ridges, making great speed over the
open land, for there was not one footman in the whole array. With little
noise they came, except an occasional shout of delight as to some
festivity; with no menace but the glad up-tossing of spears and
javelins, yet in utmost earnestness.  
   A good part of Cerdic's army was yet on the far side of the hill, and
hardly to be brought around in time. But he bestirred himself, with the
aid of his best friend and his spear-butt, in driving his men into
squares, wedges, and circles on the slope and the lower level ground,
the better to resist their enemies of either side.  
   What a morn for Cian--Cian the deliverer! All through the night, as
he swept on before his men, he had watched for the city's lights and
feared the city's darkness; until the outsailing fire-arrows told their
tale, and the flare and uproar far up the height warned him to make all
speed. Now the parting of the curtain had shown him victory surely
ahead; the  
  
Page 385  
  
Saxons, appalled, making what hasty shift they could to abide him; the
belted cone-hill alive with down-hurrying Britons; the crowning wizardly
beauty of palace and temple; and home--many-colored, wildly outlined,
multitudinously aflutter, the great dragon-standard from the highest
imperial tower surmounting all! Truly never again should man come in
quite such fashion, at such an hour, to such a Camelot.  
   There was racing to see who should first be with the Saxons; but the
crescent horns were too far ahead in position, for all that Cian could
do. One ill-formed lump of men melted instantly under the charge of
Llywarch; yet mainly the rooted spears held, and the horsemen were
turned, eddying, until they sprang to earth and joined fight, evenly
facing their foes. But before this second locking the plunging chariots
had broken in on the whole front as through a shell, making lanes almost
as far as Arthur and Caradoc. Some, indeed, were overthrown, where
reckless men leaped at bit and shaft, or sent them, by main force of
numbers, lurching over; and the riders or horses of some were speared as
they came by. But the greater number kept with Cian, turning and turning
again, with varying direction, until the whole resistance was
bewildered, and the great Saxon army broken into three.  
   One part, the least, made in hurrying disorder for  
  
Page 386  
  
some rugged ground on the northeast; another, bearing Cerdic and Cenric
in the midst, and holding together as men whose only hope of life lay
therein, went doggedly back by the road of their coming; and all the way
their teeth showed very plainly to Llywarch, who followed. The third,
having less dread of anything human than of Cian's chariots, took the
wild resolve to seek their enemy's stronghold, and made, by a dash at a
weakly defended point, a part of the second line of earthwork their
own.  
   They numbered a good many yet, very savage and desperate. The men
above withstood them fiercely, but still gave way. Cian saw no leader of
this minor defence but a woman's form, which made his heart leap with
recognition, though he had not thought Aurelia was there.  
   With little thought, and that figure his only aim, he led the rush of
wheels over the nearly obliterated lower wall; and then, on foot, by
escalade, the many fighting-men who poured after him, vehemently against
the second. There was hard work yet, though brief, on the crest of it
and in the space behind; yet he cut through the Saxons wholly, and
stood, after so long, again before his London queen.  
   "I astonish you," she said; "but you have astonished us with better
reason. We had all but made  
  
Page 387  
  
up our minds to die. Come, take my place, Cian; I am weary of playing
general."  
   "It reminds me of our first meeting," said he; for the wall gave her
height as the pedestal had given, and weapon and garb were nearly the
same. A line of dead Saxons below, fallen under the blades of her
defenders, proved that wildness and fury had been there, as before, but
again without avail. His men were finishing that work, the few hostile
survivors dashing off blindly as they could. The defence and rescue of
Camelot were quite ended.  
   As he stood beside her, Caradoc and Arthur came, the former with a
half-defiant promise to be his friend for life, though all the world
should deny. But the Emperor denied nothing, his face being solemn and
shamed in its gladness. "What more could man do for man than you have
done for me, Cian?" he said; and his voice was broken.  
   "Old times are a strong magnet," answered Cian; "and the need of our
friends and our sovereign is a stronger. Even my men of Mona would have
been here sooner could we have foreseen. But prophecy failed us."  
   Arthur winced at the word thrown out to try him. "If it could have
forecast something better than--Mona," he suggested. "But--was not the
Samaritan some kind of pagan?"  
   Aurelia and Cian touched eyes and hands, rejoi-  
  
Page 388  
  
cing silently together. It needed no words to assure them that danger
had gone by, that good-will would reign again, with no compulsion of
faith.  
   But now a gathering of figures on the far eastern hill-tops drew
their notice; and the Saxons, who had taken refuge there, were seen
drifting uncertainly back toward Camelot. Presently, as if fearing to be
cut off altogether, these broke across the more open country to the
southward, and pursuit came instantly hard upon them. Faint cries of
fear and exultation reached the watchers on the hill of Camelot. Even
the flash of armor and the tossing of scarfs and banners might presently
be seen. Arthur uttered a low exclamation, half amused, half
scornful--"Lancelot!"  
   "I think it is he," said Cian. "At least we shall not have to fight
him."  
   "Was there any thought of that?" asked Aurelia.  
   Then Cian told her the little that was known, and the much by way of
surmise, Arthur listening very gravely. When the tale was ended, the
Emperor fixed on this old friend regained a look most kindly, and walked
away, pondering. His gaze was on the chase and running fight, now of so
little moment to any except the fugitives. But his thought could
scarcely be there.  
   Aurelia followed him with her eyes, then turned in compassion to the
distant flying men, overtaken  
  
Page 389  
  
one by one. Mayhap, though, it was in some measure the less for having
seen their faces ravening so near, and heard their brutal outcries.  
   But here was Cian beside her to draw her mind away, and soon also
came tidings from her own city. For one outcome of the Saxon rout was to
let in the life of the outer world again; and all that it brought was
called for greedily, though not all, when heard, was welcome. The
Kent-folk, one rumor said, were threatening; and the riotous Celtic
party within the town were again shamefully making head against her and
the Emperor. For they had thought the calamity beyond repair. And there
had been many cries of "Vortimer."  
   Aurelia's brow knitted, and her soul stung her. She heard Cian's
indignant appeal, "Cast them off, and come to me," with answering
hand-pressure; but a moment afterward her own words were, "Not yet."  
   Later she mused aloud, "Vortimer! Then they shall have Vortimer."

CHAPTER XLI.  
  
ALL WELL ENDED.  
  
To bless Arthur       
Arthur the blessed.  
                          --TALIESSIN.

  
AT the opening of that night, Arthur held high state in the great
palace-hall of Camelot, the new-made empress by his side. Guinevere was
reassured now, and lovelier than ever in their triumph; proud also with
the assurance that, through every chance and turmoil, still in her own
especial endeavor she had completely won.  
   Aurelia, too, was there, most like some gracious Olympian figure of
Grecian fancy, but with more of human warmth and purity in her gray eyes
than ever any goddess owned. Near her, Sanawg, tall in her swaying
velvet twilight beauty, overrun with hidden fire, an ambassadress from
the Orient and the elder time. Also Cian and Llywarch together, equally
merry, for there rested now no cloud at all on the spirit of the
poet-seer. Caradoc likewise, that battle-knight of the brawny arm,
wound-hampered now, yet towering in his corner. Noble dames, too, in
numbers, city rulers and mountain chiefs, lowland kings  
  
Page 391  
  
and notable priestly warriors of the Druid isle, each in his own
especial bravery.  
   Into this presence entered Lancelot, attired even beyond what was
usual with him, beautiful immortally--but it was a sinister beauty. At
the door, doubt showed itself wistfully in his face. A step farther he
felt the chill, and hardened. Yet, as he told his tale before the
Emperor, his composure was nearly shaken, and his eyes drifted, with
appeal, toward the most contemning ones of Guinevere, who would in no
way forgive him that he had not come when called. It was a goodly story,
well-sounding to those who did not know. He had been delayed, he had
used great effort, and not wholly without avail. The hostile dead lay on
the field where he had left them. He had lost hardly one man.  
   Arthur heard him through, and made answer,--  
   "Lancelot, a late gift is better than none, and a little bread than
famine. For doing no worse, all thank you. But do not look for grateful
ecstasy. Let the future better the past. Return home. Free Vortimer. One
wishes it who is brave and fair, and of a house that was his enemy.
Moreover, I see no fitness in such custody."  
   The Prince of Gwynedd flushed and scowled, then looked again toward
the throned lady, less in hope than with that soul-compulsion which
answers to the magnetic needle's aim. But her eye showed only  
  
Page 392  
  
enjoyment of his distress, recalling how she had signalled and signalled
him, with no reply. He faced her; then he faced the Emperor, at full
height, under strain. For the moment he dared not trust his voice. All
could see what passions tore him,--outraged love, real to infatuation,
though selfish and lawless; the helpless writhing under ridicule which
no other man could feel so keenly; the strong, upsurging, hateful desire
to utterly humiliate and shame those who had brought him low--even her.
This passed; but in after years, when the great evil was coming on the
land, his soul went back to it in some sort working out the
bitterness.  
   At last he made a mocking obeisance, and said, "It shall be done;"
then passed forth with such lack of courtesy that some counselled
seizing him before he should do harm. But at that Arthur shook his
head.  
   "No need," said he. "Lancelot is not the dullard that will risk all
for nothing, nor Cerdic that sort of Saxon to make compact with one who
has failed him, if there were aught between them, that is, concerning
which I have no wish to hear further. We shall yet have, as of old, good
service from Lancelot."  
   Another power than prudence was working in the baffled Prince toward
the same end. Exiled from the court imperial, how could he hope to see
Guine-  
  
Page 393  
  
vere? And what exile more complete than that of hostility? The binding
of her fortune with Arthur's was beyond any undoing now; but equally so
was the bond of his own infatuation, when resentment against her paled
with time. Yet this did not wholly pass away, but survived, rather, in a
deadening of scruple as to what must lessen her gravely in men's eyes.  
   It was long before any incitement from her had part therein, for the
crisis of her danger and bridal came with too hard and close a strain.
During all this season of estrangement he was diligent in service to the
Emperor, being held in power, and prized there, over all North Wales.
Watching this, or seeing it with no watching, it is little wonder if
every shadow of distrust left the mind of Arthur. Yet a treachery was
latent, biding its opportunity, which had in it, as the world knows, the
ruin of them all.  
   Apart from this soul-warping, Lancelot of Gwynedd had noble graces
other than those of form. Hence, loosening his captive, he did not fail
to enlarge on Aurelia's share in that boon, and brighten her image and
claims with every pleasing color. At first Vortimer, bleached and
haggard from confinement, was in disquiet over this unlooked-for
blossoming. But, as he found that no harm came, he reconciled himself
thereto, and at last went toward Silchester (where she awaited him) with
a gallant  
  
Page 394  
  
escort, quite easy in mind and body, and most ready for friendliness
with his queen. The old prosperity of person had partly revived, but not
the old turbulence as yet; for a subtle change had been wrought by
unexpected and ruinous downfall. There could be no doubt of his present
willingness to do her service and honor.  
   This was even as she had dared to hope; for, in truth, it was not
only to please her people and restore him to daylight that her good word
had been spoken. Cian's own realm was far from London, and that city
could not be left uncared for in going to a new life, sorely as it had
tried her by unreason and petulance, and by the meanness of wilful
desertion in her great need. In the future, if a true viceroy, who had
the hearts of London, could be found, it would be easier for her to
forget such unloveliness while far away.  
   This duly came to pass; for already the major part of that city was
in fear and adoration of her concerning whom it had reckoned so wrongly,
and wild with eagerness to receive its own especial hero back again.
Therefore their progress was a thing of flowers and beauty, and every
house in every street blazed out with window-tapers at their entry. And
their confidence and good-will toward effort were such in every way that
it took little bargaining to close a peace with all the neighbor Saxons,
which left her people more freedom of the Thames, and  
  
Page 395  
  
more security against inroad and foray than ever before in the memory of
men. So there was nothing left but what Vortimer could very well do for
the queen, and in her stead. She gave the northern prince her hand, and
they went their way.  
   Would you know more of Cian of the Chariots? In the far North, with
the power of Arthur behind him, he held the land, even to the region of
lakes far beyond the great wall, securely for Britain. And many poems he
wrote and sang, of a strange and mystic beauty known in many countries
for centuries, and the fame of which, though every book that held them
is lost to men, lasted until our own day. Loving best the hills and
woodlands wherein he had been born, he yet went southward at the
Emperor's call to that great day of need which brought the great victory
and long prosperous peace of Mount Baden; often, too, as a brief
visitant of the court at Caerleon with scant approval for the new growth
of luxury which foredoomed its own ruin; or to that London which now
slumbered on unsafely in a partly reviving dream of greatness toward its
final overthrow. Last of all was he drawn to the utter disaster of
Camlan, his last days being divided between his battling princedom of
the North and Brittany beyond the sea, where one or two of his songs yet
linger on peasant tongues and in peasant memories.

**APPENDIX.**

  
    **Cian** . *page* 9. Pronounced Kyan.  
    **Llywarch** . *page* 11. Pronounced Lu-arch (nearly).  
    **Constans** . *page* 16. The son and lieutenant of Constantine,
elected emperor by the Roman troops before their abandonment of Britain.
Dr. Guest, Master of Balliol, supposed Aurelius Ambrosius to have been
his son, and Caradoc Vreichoras his grandson. The Constantine of our
story would then be cousin to "Caradoc of the brawny arm," battle-knight
of Arthur.  
    **Duglas and Glem** . *page* 17. See Preface, also the list of
Arthur's battles in Tennyson's "Elaine," borrowed from that of Nennius,
who composed a history of Britain in perhaps the seventh or eighth
century. Mr. Nicholson, Bodley's librarian at Oxford, England, supposes
the first four conflicts to have been in Lindsey ("the region Linuis" of
Nennius); but the names of the streams themselves, except the Glem, are
found in or near the lake country of the northwest. Either supposition
accords well with our story, which has nothing directly to do with any
battle of Arthur before that in the forest of Celidon.  
    **Caowl** . *page* 18. In the long poem, sometimes called an epic,
entitled the "Gododin," Aneurin gives a savage picture of Caowl, but
says also "breathless in the presence of a maid would he distribute the
mead," a tribute to woodland bashfulness!  
    **Argoed** . *page* 24. This has a general meaning of  
  
Page 398  
  
woodland. More particularly it seems to have been applied to the region
which owned Llywarch as its lord. In his "Death-song of Cyndylan" he
refers to "the men of Argoed" as his own especial following. There are
passages in this poem of epic dignity, martial force, and poignant
pathos.  
    **Dynan** . *page* 25. Pronounced between Doonan and Dunnan, say
Doi-nan.  
    **The White Town** . *page* 26. This was the city Uriconium, the
emporium of the Welsh mining-districts, near the eminence known as the
Wrekon, and on the site occupied by the present Wroxeter. The circuit of
its wall about equalled that of London. Its buildings were roofed with a
stone which contained many particles of mica, giving a beautiful effect.
It is identified by Dr. Guest with the "White Town, the town of flame"
of Llywarch. It was taken by storm in the final conquest of the Severn
valley, as its ruins yet show.  
   Calleva Atrebatum, which the Britons called Caer Segeint, is now
represented by the small town of Silchester. Its forces marched under
the eagle standard after the Romans had withdrawn. According to Geoffrey
of Monmouth, Arthur was here elected and crowned by a great assembly of
the nobility and clergy of the realm. It was, at all events, hardly
inferior to London after the latter waned under the stifling effect of
the Saxon blockade, and must always have been more beautiful.  
    **Osburn** . *page* 26. This Frank mercenary is a type of the Teuton
free lances who were then serving Rome and Rome's enemies, and every
semi-independent power. Naturally the city of London would have some of
them in the guard of its wall and gates.  
    **Caer Collin** . *page* 33. Colchester. Present county seat of
Essex. Ancient capital of "Old King Cole," according to ballad and
legend; also of the historic Cunebelline, Shakespeare's Cymbeline, the
"friend of Augustus." It was in Roman times one of the great cities of
Britain, and the  
  
Page 399  
  
centre of many industries, but had no doubt long been dwindling before
the period with which we deal, being often threatened and sometimes
quite surrounded by the East Saxons and their allies.  
    **Andred-wood** . *page* 33. The greatest wilderness of Britain,
which ran east and west parallel with a great part of the southern
coast. There was a mining-population in it, besides foresters of every
kind. The great fortress town of Anderida, called by the Saxons Andred
Ceaster, derived its name from this wood, and was aided by that hardy
population in its obstinate resistance to Elle, the conqueror of Sussex.
Long after London fell, the forest of Andred offered an asylum to all
sorts of fugitive Britons.  
    **Guledig** . *page* 39. Guledig, or Wledig, was the Celtic
equivalent of Emperor. Thus the tale known as "The Dream of Maxim
Wledig" has to do with the Emperor Maximus. Tigernach, being an extreme
reactionary Briton and Celt, would use the native title instead of any
foreign equivalent. The mistletoe, sacred to the Druids, had been
chosen, we will suppose, as a token among their adherents, and was also
the cognizance of Prince Cian.  
    **Waters of the Sun** . *page* 54. Aquæ Solis, the modern Bath. It
was not destroyed until after Arthur's death. In the Saxon "Codex
Exoniensis" appears a very impressive metrical meditation of one of the
victors, attesting the extraordinary beauty, luxury, anal attractiveness
of the place. "They perished in wide slaughter."  
    **Cian's chariot** . *page* 60. It has been thought that some relics
indicate the use of chariots in battle as late as the ninth century.
They were the distinctive war-engines of ancient Britain. In the Celtic
revival from the sixth to the eighth centuries they would naturally
reappear after their long disuse during Roman times. But in the earlier
part of this period they must have been a rarity, so that Cian, the
conservative in  
  
Page 400  
  
opinion though daring in action, would be nearly alone in his fancy.  
    **The legend** . *page* 65. It is a very old one, illustrated by
some of Cunebelline's coinage.  
    **Vran** . *page* 70. This demigod, or half-deified magician, seems
to have been a special champion of London at a very early date. The
Welsh triads mention him.  
    **Aesc of West Kent** . *page* 70. In the confusion and overlapping
of the waves of Saxon invaders, there were even for a time two kings
within the limits of what is now one county. West Kent was not a kingdom
of long duration, yet it existed.  
    **The Song of Cian** . *page* 74. Our hero is mentioned by Nennius
as one of the four great poets of Arthur's time. So late as the French
Revolution a manuscript book of his poems is said to have been extant in
Brittany. They may yet possibly be recovered. A single song attributed
to him, of a mystical and figurative character, has been taken down from
the recitation of peasants in that province. I have endeavored to be
faithful to its tone and quality, being without other guide.  
    **Caerleon** . *page* 76. Caerleon on Usk, having yet its living
representative. This was the main seat of Arthur's court, preserving
much of Roman splendor. It affords the scene and personages of the
Mabinogion tales in the "Red Book of Hergest." It is "the city Leogis,
called Cair Lion" of Nennius. Here also "the neighing of the wild White
Horse set every gilded parapet shuddering."  
    **Basilica** . *page* 78. In Roman cities this was a combination of
court-house, public hall, trade-guild, office-building, and merchants'
exchange, but was usually of great beauty.  
    **Eschwine** . *page* 83. London was probably taken and destroyed or
depopulated by Sleda, the son of Eschwine, soon after Arthur's death.
The father, having recently given over sea piracy, and established
himself on the land, was not  
  
Page 401  
  
likely to be more clement at the time of our tale. A chief of the
Northern Saxons was known by the parallel title of "Flame Bearer."  
    **Maelgwn** . *page* 105. Monsieur de Villemarqué was, I believe,
the first to identify this Prince of North Wales with the legendary
Lancelot. Gildas berates him as a very guilty man, but gives him credit
for strength, gallantry, and the possession of high qualities which
might have been turned to better account. He appears as a paroxysmal,
vain, self-seeking character, extravagant in sinning and repenting, yet
foremost in ability after Arthur's fall. By some priestly subterfuge,
known as "the affair of Corsfechno," he seems to have acquired
supremacy. He was probably the Conmael who fell with two other great
chiefs in defending the lower Severn valley and its cluster of
commercial cities when the next wave of Saxon invasion rolled that way.
Geraint, coupled with him, is mentioned by Aneurin, and made the hero of
a vehement and splendid poem by Llywarch. There is no reason to doubt
that Geraint was a real person, very possibly "a tributary prince of
Devon, one of the great order of the Table Round," as Tennyson puts it
in the "Idylls of the King."  
    **Camelot** . *page* 105. Camelot was probably a newly founded
fortress city, which Arthur made his frontier capital, that he might the
better watch his most dangerous enemy, Cerdic of Wessex, who had
penetrated some distance into the land on this frontier. The site of
Camelot was most likely Cadbury Hill, near Queen's Camel, in
Somersetshire. Merlin is identified by legend with the building of the
place, and dwellers thereabout are said to retain a certain wizardly
repute even yet.  
    **A stronghold built on piles** . *page* 106. The lake or great
marsh below London probably gave that city its name, "Lyn-dyn," the
lake-fort. It must have afforded a refuge and fastness to the Britons,
and maintained its race of marsh-  
  
Page 402  
  
men, as did the fens and watery wastes that lay farther to the north.
The piles of buildings which were supported in this way above the water
have been found within the limits of the metropolis. There is no
unlikelihood in a complete lake-village of that time and place.  
    **Arthur Mabuter** . *page* 110. The word Mabuter has been generally
translated "the son of Uther." One of the British poets refers to him as
"the son of Uther before he was slain." But Dr. Guest insists that it
should be rendered "the terrible boy," in allusion to his youth on first
assuming command.  
    **The Song of Llywarch** . *page* 116. In these verses I have
preserved the rhyme, arrangement, and metre of Llywarch's "warrior
triplet," which may have indirectly suggested such modern poems as
"Hohenlinden" and "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled." The white-horse
standard referred to was that of the Saxons under Cerdic. The charge in
white armor is from Geoffrey of Monmouth, who puts the number who fell
with Ambrosius at five thousand. The Saxon Chronicles mention the death
of Natanleod, King of the Britons, at the same time and place. Dr. Guest
considers it to be a title, meaning Prince of the Sanctuary, meaning the
"holy house at Amesbury," which had been named after him, and was known
as the great Choir of the Dominion. Later it was removed to Glastonbury,
known as Avalon, where Arthur himself was laid quietly to rest at the
end, being borne in a boat over the flooded land.  
    **Guinevere** . *page* 121. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, her
name was Guanhumara. The Scotch peasants make it Wander. Guinevere was a
Normanized version. It is likely also that the Normans invented Lancelot
as a substitute for Maelgwn.  
    **The Queen of London** . *page* 132. An old Welsh manuscript says,
"Wherefore the kings of London were called the sons of Alis." Dr.
Freeman says there are indica-  
  
Page 403  
  
tions that London, in its early Saxon history, maintained a kind of
local supremacy, having under it the tributary territory of Middlesex.  
    **Verulam** . *page* 181. St. Alban's.  
    **Caer Lerion** . *page* 190. Ratæ of the Romans. Leicester.  
    **Legiolum** . *page* 191. Castleford.  
    **Freur** . *page* 201. Llywarch mentions his sister Freur in one of
his poems.  
    **A woman-like form** . *page* 203. The people of the under-world
and wonder-world are too important components of early British story to
be neglected. We find the lady of the hollow hill in one of the
Mabinogion stories; and the experiences of Kilmeny, Childe Roland, and
Thomas of Ercildoun show what might befall. Curiously, some of the
hills, on excavation, have been shown to be both hollow and once
inhabited. There is some element of truth in most superstition. It has
been suggested that a primitive aboriginal race, driven to underground
shelter and the depths of forestry, and able to keep alive only by
secrecy and subtlety, may have made reprisals, including abductions, in
a terrifying way, so that the fear of them as mysterious, flitting, and
superhuman, would linger on indefinitely.  
    **The Scaur** . *page* 208. The Victoria caverns of the King's Scaur
were first adequately explored and described by Professor Boyd Dawkins,
author of "Cave-Hunting." The relics in them show that refugees from
ruined northern cities, like Isurium, atone time took refuge there; this
occupancy lasting until civilization was in part worn away, or until
they made room for more barbarous successors.  
    **Caer Badus. Caer Gloui** . *page* 218. Bath and Gloucester.  
    **The wreck of Isurium** . *page* 226. This city, according to Dr.
Green, was hardly inferior to Eboracum (York),  
  
Page 404  
  
which exceeded London in importance. The destruction by the Saxons was
complete.  
    **Caer Ebrauc** . *page* 230. This was now Eboracum, now York.  
    **Prince Edyrn** . Edyrn of the Scarlet Coat was a notable British
champion of the preceding generation. "Sanawg, or stately maiden," is
named in a poem of "The Graves of Britain," author not certain. Gwydion
ap Don had a great celebrity for necromantic feats, including the very
pretty one commemorated in the fragment of a chant which haunted
Llywarch's fancy.  
    **Loidis** . *page* 249. Leeds.  
    **Borne far away** . *page* 285. If you ask who carried Dynan away,
"I cannot tell so mote I thrive." His name is a very old one; he
provides a part of the fanciful-mystical element of our romance. Thus in
the "Lay of the Last Minstrel" we have a page of preterhuman qualities
and abilities, although it is a true picture of its time.  
   In Lady Guest's Mabinogion, taken from the fourteenth century "Red
Book of Hergest," you will find the story of Araun, the Lord of Announ,
and Powyll, Prince of Dyfed, in which the mystic lady of the hollow hill
appears as "Rhiannon of unspeakable beauty," riding out of the
under-world on a white horse, with a garment of shining gold around her.
Without effort she distanced all pursuers. Archæologists have found,
curiously enough, that some of the mounds popularly called Pechts'
houses in North Britain, and believed to be haunted by fairies, actually
had within them chambers fitted up for human occupancy. Mr. MacRitchie
argues ingeniously that there was a small aboriginal race which took
refuge in them, issuing by night into the outer air, and occasionally
abducting the women or children, or even the men, of the conquering
race. Dr. Rhys attributes, conjecturally, the liveliness of the Irish,
as compared with the Welsh, to the greater amount of fairy blood in
them.  
  
Page 405  
  
   The modern concept of the fairies is a very complex one, deriving
something, no doubt from the light and shadow of inanimate nature and
mere fantastic day-dreaming. Yet back of them troops a more impressive
array, the dread lords and ladies of the lower realm, in some part the
dethroned deities of divers heathen mythologies, but no doubt even more
the memories of dispossessed human beings who lurked on in the shadow,
perhaps long after they had ceased to be thought of as flesh and blood
by people who were free to come and go as they would in the daylight.
Our Dynan is not historic, he is typical, and by no means the only one
for whom this dread parentage has been claimed. Let us not be over
curious as to whether he were borne into a spectral under-world of magic
and faery, or into some dusky refuge of a last lingering fragment of a
most archaic but purely human race. In the thrill and twilight of
mystery must Romance ever find her home.  
    **White Hill of Cynvelyn** . *page* 295. This seems to have been the
hill of the Tower of London.  
    **Caer Ligion** . *page* 341. Now Chester. One of the last of the
Romano-British cities to be taken by the Saxons. Two hundred years
afterward it remained a ruin; but the great walls were used by the
Northmen as a defence when hard pressed, as the ruins of Uxmal might be
used by a Mexican or Central American expedition now.  
    **Trath Tribuit** . *page* 341. This battle of the strand, which has
no very direct relation to the main current of our tale, is mentioned in
Nennius, and in the poems of the "Black Book of Caermarthen," the oldest
of the Welsh manuscripts, a few fragments only excepted. The spelling
varies through several intermediate forms, from Trath Tribuit to Traeth
Trywruid. It is located at many widely separated points by different
investigators. The mouth of the Ribble is an old suggestion, which, on
the whole, has the most to commend it. The word Trath, or Traeth, is
translated the sandy

shore of an estuary. The Ribble mouth answers to this; the name is more
like Tribuit than that of any similar spot which the Saxons had any
temptation to reach; and it is not easy to invent any other probable
scheme of their semi-naval campaign.  
    **Caer Caradoc** . *page* 358. This was Amesbury, the town of
Ambrosius, where the Holy House mentioned by Arthur in Tennyson's
Guinevere was or had been located; a religious establishment very likely
as great as that of Bangor, which is said to have sent a thousand
unarmed priests to the final battle before the walls of Chester, where
they were slain while praying. At the time of which I write, it is
probable that the religious element had withdrawn to safer quarters in
Avalon, and that the character of the town was chiefly military. Dr.
Guest identifies Amesbury with the provincial capital of Caradoc
Vriechvras, Prince of Devon and son of Aurelius Ambrosius.  
    **City of Vortigern** . *page* 361. Old legends make Gloucester the
capital of Vortigern, or Vor Tighairn, the British king or emperor who
invited Hengist and Horsa into Kent.  
    **Battle of Camelot** . *page* 362. This is the Cat Bregion, or
battle of the Mount Breguoin of Nennius. The name has been explained by
Dr. Skene as meaning the painted hill; and Cadbury, with triple walls of
eartwork, and buildings painted after the Celtic fancy, gay-colored
banners, and the many richly apparelled chiefs and followers, would
answer to that name very well. First or last, the British frontier
capital was sure to be assailed. But there can be no such certainty in
the identification of the battle of Mount Breguoin as in the case of
Mount Badon, which is put by the note of the monks of Glastonbury on
their copy of Gildas at a point near Bath and the Avon River; or in the
case of Cair Lion, which is still Caerleon on Usk.
