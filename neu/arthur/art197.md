## BALLAD OF SIR LAUNCELOT

### by

## JOHN GROSVENOR WILSON

  
"Riding the quest of the Grail alone,  
    Guinevere, Guinevere, pity me!  
All thro' the day and the night I moan,  
    Yearning to catch but a glimpse of thee.  
Tho' I make halt by the wan west sea,  
    Seeking a sign in the high God's name,  
Lo, as I tremble and bow the knee,  
    Gleameth thy face with the eyes aflame!  
  
"Me have I scourged till the blood hath flown,  
    Weeping hot tears of misery;  
Still thro' the day and the night I moan,  
    Yearning to catch but a glimpse of thee. --  
Yea, have I striven and sought to flee,  
    Ever and ever the same -- the same --  
Blinding my soul with sweet rarity,  
    Gleameth thy face with the eyes aflame!  
  
"Sleeping, I dreamed that the Grail was shown,  
    Marvellous bright with clemency;  
Waking, I lay on the chancel-stone --  
    Ah, but I yearned for the touch of thee! --  
Tho' I may bow and make piteous plea  
    Unto the Christ and our Holy Dame,  
Sweeter by far than all visions be,  
    Gleameth thy face with the eyes aflame."  
  
ENVOY.  
  
Guinevere maketh a day of glee, --  
    "Who is it cometh to join our game?" --  
"Launcelot rideth with bridle free,  
    Gleameth thy face with the eyes aflame."
