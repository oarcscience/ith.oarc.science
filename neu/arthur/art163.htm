<br> In the noble days were shown<br> Deeds of good knights many one,<br> Many worthy wars were done.<br> <br> It was time of scath and scorn<br> When at breaking of the morn<br> Tristram the good knight was born.<br> <br> He was fair and well to see<br> As his mother's child might be:<br> Many happy wars had he;<br> <br> Slew Moronde the knight alone,<br> Whence was all the ill begun<br> That on Blancheflour was done.<br> <br> For long since Queen Blancheflour <br> Took a knight to paramour,<br> Who had served her well of yore.<br> <br> And across the waters dim<br> And by many a river's rim<br> Went Queen Blancheflour with him.<br> <br> Many a bitter path she went,<br> Many a stone her feet had rent,<br> But her heart was well content.<br> <br> "Lo!" she said, "I lady free<br> Took this man for lord of me<br> Where the crowned saints might see.<br> <br> "And I will not bid him go,<br> Not for joyance nor for woe,<br> Till my very love he know."<br> <br> When he kissed her as they went,<br> All her heart was well content,<br> For the love that she him meant.<br> <br> Now this knight was called Roland,<br> And he had within his hand<br> Ermonie the happy land.<br> <br> So five months in Ermonie<br> Dwelt they in their pleasure free;<br> For they knew not what should be.<br> <br> Then came Moronde with his men,<br> Warring with her lord again.<br> All her heart was bitter then.<br> <br> But she said: "If this be so,<br> Tho' I die, he shall not know."<br> And she kissed and bade him go;<br> <br> And he wept and went from her.<br> Then was all the land astir<br> With a trouble in the air.<br> <br> When Roland the knight was gone,<br> Praise of men his warriors won<br> Warring well before the sun.<br> <br> But Moronde the evil knight<br> Smote him falsely in the fight,<br> Slew him basely out of sight.<br> <br> Then was weeping long and sore:<br> For the great love they him bore<br> All men wept but Blancheflour.<br> <br> But she took her golden ring<br> And a fair sword of the king<br> Wrought with many a carven thing.<br> <br> With no crown about her head,<br> Thinking wild thoughts of the dead,<br> Evermore she fled and fled.<br> <br> Far within the forest fair,<br> A great anguish came on her<br> Till a strong manchild she bare.<br> <br> And she fain had suckled him,<br> There beneath the lindens dim,<br> Round a fountain's weedy brim.<br> <br> But too soon came death to take<br> All her beauty for his sake;<br> And ere death she moaned and spake.<br> <br> "Ah, fair child," the lady said,<br> "For this anguish that it had<br> All thy mother's heart is dead.<br> <br> "Sweet, I would not live to see<br> Any sorrow rest on thee,<br> Better thou hadst died with me.<br> <br> "Only thou art still too fair<br> For that smile I cannot bear<br> In such eyes as Roland's were.<br> <br> "Now, fair child, mine own wert thou<br> (And she kissed the small soft brow)<br> But for death that takes me now.<br> <br> "And a bitter birth is thine;<br> But no man can stain thy line<br> With a shame that was not mine.<br> <br> "Thou art pure and princely born;<br> Fairer name was never worn,<br> Past the touch of any scorn.<br> <br> "Now thy grief has come on me,<br> As I prayed that it might be<br> Lest some woe should rest on thee."<br> <br> Wept the low voice musical;<br> "Now that mine has given thee all,<br> Better love thy love befall.<br> <br> "Purer prayers be round thy sleep,<br> Truer tears than these that drip<br> On thy tender cheek and lip.<br> <br> "Now, dear child, of all on earth<br> Thou art yet the fairest birth<br> For the pain thy life was worth.<br> <br> "Sweetest name and sweetest heart,<br> Now I see thee as thou art<br> I have had the better part.<br> <br> "For the grief my love has had,<br> May the sweet saints keep thee glad<br> Tho' thy birth were strange and sad.<br> <br> "Now, dear child" (her thin voice strove<br> Thro' the drawn dry sobs to move),<br> "Leave I thee to Christ's own love."<br> <br> So she died in that dark place,<br> With the anguish in her face;<br> Mary took her into grace.<br> <br> On the robe was sown her name,<br> Where a fine thread white as flame<br> Thro' the coloured samite came.<br> <br> For on skirt and hem between<br> Wrought she letters white and green<br> "This is Blancheflour the Queen."<br> <br> There men found her as they sped,<br> Very beautiful and dead,<br> In the lilies white and red.<br> <br> And beside her lying there,<br> Found a manchild strong and fair<br> Lain among the lilies bare.<br> <br> And they thought it were ill fate,<br> If the child, for fear or hate,<br> They should leave in evil state.<br> <br> So they took him lying there,<br> Playing with the lady's hair,<br> For his face was very fair.<br> <br> And so tenderly he played,<br> Half asmile and half afraid,<br> With her lips and hair, I said,<br> <br> That the strong men for his sake<br> Could have wept for dear heartache<br> At the murmurs he did make.<br> <br> And the strongest lightly stept<br> Forth to where the mother slept;<br> Stooping over her, he wept.<br> <br> Lightly bowed above the child<br> The large face whose might was mild<br> With black-bearded lips that smiled.<br> <br> Then he took it of his grace,<br> Bowed him where she lay in place,<br> Put to hers the little face.<br> <br> Then they softly buried her<br> Where the greenest leaves did stir,<br> With some white flowers in her hair.<br> <br> And for the sweet look he had,<br> Weeping not but very sad,<br> Tristram by his name they bade.<br> <br> "For he looks upon her so,<br> Pity where he should not grow<br> All the piteous thing to know."<br> <br> And they took the sword and ring<br> That were of Roland the king,<br> Wrought with many a carven thing.<br> <br> So they bred him as they knew;<br> And a noble child he grew,<br> Like a tree in sun and dew.<br> <br> Ere he was ten summers old<br> All the sorrow they him told,<br> Showed the sword and ring of gold.<br> <br> Kissed the boy both sword and ring;<br> "As my father was a king,<br> I will wreak this bitter thing."<br> <br> Kissed the boy both ring and sword;<br> "As my mother to her lord,<br> Fast I cling to this my word."<br> <br> So he grew in might and grace,<br> With her look about his face:<br> All men saw his royal race.<br> <br> But when twenty years were done<br> At the rising of the sun<br> Tristram from his place was gone.<br> <br> Forth with warriors is he bound<br> Over many a change of ground,<br> To have wreak of Sir Moronde.<br> <br> When he came to Ermonie,<br> Bare upon the earth bowed he,<br> Kissed the earth with kisses three.<br> <br> To the city men him bring,<br> Where the herald stood to sing<br> "Largesse of Moronde the king!"<br> <br> To the king came Tristram then,<br> To Moronde the evil man,<br> Treading softly as he can.<br> <br> Spake he loftily in place:<br> A great light was on his face:<br> "Listen, king, of thy free grace.<br> <br> "I am Tristram, Roland's son;<br> By thy might my lands were won,<br> All my lovers were undone.<br> <br> "Died by thee Queen Blancheflour,<br> Mother mine in bitter hour,<br> That was white as any flower.<br> <br> "Tho' they died not well aright,<br> Yet, for thou art belted knight,<br> King Moronde, I bid thee fight."<br> <br> A great laughter laughed they all,<br> Drinking wine about the hall,<br> Standing by the outer wall.<br> <br> But the pale king leapt apace,<br> Caught his staff that lay in place<br> And smote Tristram on the face.<br> <br> Tristram stood back paces two,<br> All his face was reddened so<br> Round the deep mark of the blow.<br> <br> Large and bright the king's eyes grew:<br> As knight Roland's sword he drew,<br> Fiercely like a pard he flew.<br> <br> And above the staring eyes<br> Smote Moronde the king flatwise,<br> That men saw the dear blood rise.<br> <br> At the second time he smote,<br> All the carven blade, I wot,<br> With the blood was blurred and hot.<br> <br> At the third stroke that he gave,<br> Deep the carven steel he drave,<br> Thro' King Moronde's heart it clave.<br> <br> Well I ween his wound was great<br> As he sank across the seat,<br> Slain for Blancheflour the sweet.<br> <br> Then spake Tristram, praising God;<br> In his father's place he stood<br> Wiping clean the smears of blood,<br> <br> That the sword, while he did pray,<br> At the throne's foot he might lay;<br> Christ save all good knights, I say.<br> <br> Then spake all men in his praise,<br> Speaking words of the old days,<br> Sweeter words than sweetest lays.<br> <br> Said one, "Lo the dead queen's hair<br> And her brows so straight and fair;<br> So the lips of Roland were."<br> <br> For all praised him as he stood,<br> That such things none other could<br> Than the son of kingly blood.<br> <br> Round he looked with quiet eyes;<br> "When ye saw King Moronde rise,<br> None beheld me on this wise."<br> <br> At such words as he did say,<br> Bare an old man knelt to pray;<br> "Christ be with us all to-day.<br> <br> "This is Tristram the good lord;<br> Knightly hath he held his word,<br> Warring with his father's sword."<br> <br> Then one brought the diadem,<br> Clear and golden like pure flame;<br> And his thanks did grace to them.<br> <br> Next in courteous wise he bade<br> That fair honour should be had<br> Of the dear queen that was dead.<br> <br> So in her great sorrow's praise<br> A fair tomb he bade them raise<br> For a wonder to the days.<br> <br> And between its roof and floor<br> Wrote he two words and no more,<br> Wrote <i> Roland</i>  and <i> Blancheflour</i> .<br> <br> That was carven sharp in gold,<br> For a great praise to behold,<br> Where the queen lay straight and cold,<br> <br> All was graven deep and fine,<br> In and out, and line with line,<br> That all men might see it shine.<br> <br> So far off it sprang and shone,<br> Ere ten paces one had gone,<br> Showing all the sorrow done.<br> <br> And the pillars, that upbore<br> The large roof for evermore,<br> In wrought flowers her sweet name wore:<br> <br> Points of stone carved gently all,<br> Wrought in cusp and capital,<br> Climbing still to creep and fall.<br> <br> And in many a tender nook,<br> Traced soft as running brook,<br> Shone her face's quiet look.<br> <br> And above they wrought to lie<br> King Roland all white on high,<br> With the lady carven by.<br> <br> Very patient was her face,<br> Stooping from its maiden place<br> Into strange new mother-grace.<br> <br> Parted lips and closing eyes,<br> All the quiet of the skies<br> Fills her beauty where she lies.<br> <br> On her hair the forest crown<br> Lets the sliding tresses down, <br> Touched ere dark with golden brown;<br> <br> Both with carven hands uplift,<br> Praying softly as at shrift,<br> So it stood a kingly gift.<br> <br> And when all was graven fair<br> Tristram came, and standing there<br> Kissed his mother's tender hair.<br> <br> Then he bade them take for King<br> His true father in each thing,<br> Him who saved the sword and ring.<br> <br> So they hearkened to his word,<br> And they took to be their lord<br> Him who kept the ring and sword.<br> <br> Then by many painful ways,<br> With a noble thought in chase,<br> Tristram journeyed many days.<br> <br> Towards the Cornwall king he bore,<br> Since an oath of love he swore<br> For the name of Blancheflour,<br> <br> That King Mark, her brother true,<br> He would honour as he knew;<br> This was he I tell to you.<br> <br> When he stood in Cornwall there,<br> Mark beheld him standing bare,<br> And he knew his sister's hair.<br> <br> All these things to Mark he told,<br> To the king so lean and cold,<br> And he showed her ring of gold.<br> <br> Then wept all the valiant men,<br> Wept King Mark upon him then,<br> Thinking what a grief had been.<br> <br> Then was Tristram belted knight,<br> For his happy hand in fight.<br> Then spake Mark in all men's sight:<br> <br> "For the love my sister won,<br> I will honour as I can<br> This her son, the loved man.<br> <br> "And this praise I give him here:<br> He shall go to bring anear<br> My new bride with noble cheer.<br> <br> "For strange things are said in place<br> Of the wonder of her face<br> And her tender woman's grace."<br> <br> Spake the king so lean and cold:<br> "She hath name of honour old,<br> Yseult queen, the hair of gold.<br> <br> "All her limbs are fair and strong,<br> And her face is straight and long,<br> And her talk is as a song.<br> <br> "And faint lines of colour stripe<br> (As spilt wine that one should wipe)<br> All her golden hair corn-ripe;<br> <br> "Drawn like red gold ears that stand<br> In the yellow summer land; <br> Arrow-straight her perfect hand, <br> <br> "And her eyes like river-lakes<br> Where a gloomy glory shakes<br> Which the happy sunset makes.<br> <br> "Her shall Tristram go to bring,<br> With a gift of some rich thing<br> Fit to free a prisoned king."<br> <br> As Sir Mark said, it was done;<br> And ere set the morrow's sun,<br> Tristram the good knight was gone.<br> <br> Forth to Ireland bade he come,<br> Forth across the grey sea-foam,<br> All to bring Queen Yseult home.<br> <br> 	     CANTO 2<br> <br> <i> Of Queen Yseult, and of the voyage to Cornwall</i> <br> <br> Day by day and year by year<br> In the quiet chambers here<br> Grew the lady white and dear.<br> <br> Day by day and week by week<br> Grew the glory of her cheek<br> Till it seemed to breathe and speak.<br> <br> Day by day and night by night<br> Grew she in her mother's sight,<br> Maiden Yseult dear and white.<br> <br> Ever as her face grew fair<br> In a light of growing hair<br> Grew the tresses bright and bare.<br> <br> For no crown the maiden had,<br> But with tresses golden-glad<br> Was her perfect body clad.<br> <br> And no gems the maiden wore<br> But the bright hair evermore<br> All her warm white limbs before.<br> <br> Ah, dear saints, to see her face<br> Many would have died in place,<br> She was wonderful for grace.<br> <br> Wept for love her mother fair,<br> Wept for utter love of her,<br> Kissing soft her maiden hair.<br> <br> Many maidens have men seen,<br> But on earth has never been<br> Any maiden like the queen.<br> <br> So did all her love endure<br> In a life most sweet and sure,<br> Very beautiful and pure.<br> <br> For her mother and the king<br> Sang she many a maiden thing,<br> Standing at their feet to sing.<br> <br> Unto her came Tristram then,<br> Sailing straight with many men<br> For King Mark her love to win.<br> <br> And most royal gifts he bare,<br> Robes for any queen to wear,<br> And great jewels for her hair.<br> <br> And he brought a royal ring<br> Such as noble knight should bring,<br> Wedding her for Mark the king.<br> <br> Very courteously he spake,<br> That for holy honour's sake<br> Maiden Yseult should him take.<br> <br> So the king bade send for her;<br> And she came before them there,<br> Clothed upon with golden hair.<br> <br> And Sir Tristram for her sight<br> Prais&egrave;d all the saints aright<br> As men would for happy fight.<br> <br> And he would have died in place<br> But for love and knightly grace<br> That he saw that maiden face.<br> <br> And he knelt with heart aflame,<br> Took her robe in sight of them,<br> Kissed the skirt and kissed the hem.<br> <br> Ah, dear saints, how well it were,<br> Thought he, to die knightly there<br> For that lady's golden hair.<br> <br> And he thought it very good<br> He should perish where she stood<br> Crowned upon with maidenhood.<br> <br> And his whole heart for her sake<br> With a large delight did ache<br> Till it seemed to burn and break.<br> <br> And he thought it well and meet,<br> Lain before that lady sweet,<br> To be trodden by her feet.<br> <br> And so loved he her least tress,<br> That his heart strange thoughts did bless<br> Of its deep unworthiness.<br> <br> For no nearer would he be<br> Her he lov&egrave;d loyally <br> With a bright humility.<br> <br> And he thought him, loving her,<br> Of sweet words he used to hear,<br> Lancelot and Guinevere.<br> <br> And what love some men might see,<br> So in under-breath spake he,<br> "Now I know what things they be."<br> <br> Then the king spake gravely all,<br> And his large voice in the hall<br> Ever seemed to grow and fall.<br> <br> Then the queen spake softlier,<br> And it seem&egrave;d him to bear<br> A new trouble in the air.<br> <br> Answered Yseult maidenwise;<br> Great hot tears grew thro' his eyes,<br> That he could not speak or rise.<br> <br> Knowing not what words she said<br> Seemed to beat upon his head<br> Noise that vex't him, being dead.<br> <br> But he spake in courteous wise<br> So that all the knights did rise<br> With a light in their grave eyes.<br> <br> And the king with straight grey hairs<br> Laid Sir Tristram's hand in hers<br> As the bridal manner bears.<br> <br> And her mother that had skill<br> In all herbs that sain or heal<br> Arrow-wound or fever ill,<br> <br> Gave a secret drink of might<br> That she bade her maiden bright<br> Drink upon the bridal night.<br> <br> "For it is a mighty thing,<br> And great love to both shall bring<br> If thou drink with Mark the king."<br> <br> So was Yseult brought to ship,<br> There she kissed her mother's lip<br> And sat softly down to weep.<br> <br> Forth to Cornwall back they come,<br> Over all the grey salt foam<br> Brought they maiden Yseult home.<br> <br> So came Yseult from her own;<br> Wept the grave king on his throne,<br> And her mother wept alone.<br> <br> Now the days grew bright and long,<br> And her voice the men among<br> Warmed their spirits like a song.<br> <br> And the men at oar that rowed,<br> Seeing Yseult where she trode<br> For her dear face prais&egrave;d God.<br> <br> For they said, "Was never man<br> Since the world's great hap began<br> Such a lady to him wan."<br> <br> So they spake between their oars,<br> Rowing level by green shores,<br> Sloped about with great grey moors.<br> <br> And when days were full of spring<br> Tristram prayed her well to sing<br> In their ears some happy thing.<br> <br> So the lady sang to them,<br> And all faces grew aflame,<br> And on all great glory came.<br> <br> So the lady sang alway,<br> And the men rose up to pray,<br> For her face shone bright as day.<br> <br> So her song the lady kept,<br> And their souls to Godwards leapt,<br> And with pride the meanest wept.<br> <br> When Queen Yseult's song had end,<br> All they bowed with head and hand,<br> Speaking soft in whispers bland.<br> <br> But with all the summer heat<br> That about them burned and beat<br> Sore athirst was Yseult sweet.<br> <br> For she sang so loud and long<br> To the rowers rowing strong<br> That she thirsted in her song.<br> <br> Than bade Tristram bring her wine<br> In her chalice carven fine,<br> Rich with many a tender line.<br> <br> So the chaliced wine was brought,<br> And the drink of power that wrought<br> Change in face and change in thought.<br> <br> And the wine was fierce and sweet,<br> But the lady, drinking it,<br> Shuddered to her hands and feet.<br> <br> But the drink her mother gave<br> In the carven chalice brave<br> Like warm gold did float and wave.<br> <br> And Sir Tristram, courteous-wise,<br> With a smile about his eyes<br> Pledged the queen in knightly guise.<br> <br> As they drank in love and truth,<br> Lo, there grew in heart and mouth<br> As a hot and bitter drouth.<br> <br> Then he bent towards her there,<br> And he knew that she was fair,<br> And he stooped and kissed her hair.<br> <br> And Queen Yseult, pain&egrave;d sore<br> For the love that him she bore,<br> As she kissed him, trembled more.<br> <br> At their hearts it stirred and crept,<br> Round their hearts it grew and leapt,<br> Till they kissed again and wept.<br> <br> So was their great love begun,<br> Sitting silent in the sun,<br> Such a little thing was done.<br> <br> And Queen Yseult, weeping still,<br> Tristram had to do his will<br> That his list she should fulfil.<br> <br> Tristram had her body fair,<br> And her golden corn-ripe hair,<br> And her golden ring to wear.<br> <br> So he took the golden ring<br> That was of Sir Mark the king,<br> As to serve her in each thing.<br> <br> And his mother's Yseult had<br> To keep wisely as he bade;<br> So they sware it, low and glad.<br> <br> So they slept the night long there,<br> And above their faces bare<br> Flowed and glowed the golden hair.<br> <br> So to Cornwall did they come<br> All across the flowing foam,<br> So was brought Queen Yseult home.<br> <br> So King Mark his bride hath got<br> That he little knew, I wot,<br> When his heart with wine was hot.<br> <br> And men said, "Great pity is<br> He such queen should ever kiss,<br> Little were his need, I wis."<br> <br> But they knew not what had been,<br> And with smiles and moans between<br> On Sir Tristram looked the Queen.<br> <br> So they brought her by his hold<br> To the king so lean and cold,<br> Yseult queen, the hair of gold.<br> <br> 	     CANTO 3<br> <br> <i> How Sir Tristram and Queen Yseult loved each other by the space of three years</i> <br> <br> All that night and all thro' day<br> Many minstrels bade men play<br> That the king's great praise they say.<br> <br> So they sang in court and hall,<br> But it only grieved them all<br> Such a bride should him befall.<br> <br> For none wist what had been done,<br> Yseult's maidens all but one<br> Said their queen a bride were gone.<br> <br> Many days this love grew old,<br> While abode the hair of gold<br> By the king so lean and cold.<br> <br> And such love their love did bless<br> They had much of happiness<br> And their hope grew never less.<br> <br> And at morning when she leant<br> From her lattice in content<br> Over him her face was bent.<br> <br> And on kingly summer eves<br> When much light is in the leaves,<br> Had they joy of all that lives.<br> <br> Sometimes in the garden place,<br> When much light was in her face,<br> Would he sing of her great grace.<br> <br> So she leant to hear his song,<br> Heard him in the leaves among<br> Singing in the sweet French tongue.<br> <br> "This was love that Yseult wan,<br> That to any maid or man<br> Spake she courteous as she can.<br> <br> "This was praise that Yseult had,<br> That her happiness made glad<br> Man or maiden that was sad.<br> <br> "Now this Yseult ever knew<br> That such love about her grew<br> As kept all men pure like dew.<br> <br> "And this Yseult had but one<br> To love well beneath the sun<br> Till her very love were done."<br> <br> And he praised her as he can<br> For the love that him began<br> That she loved none other man.<br> <br> And he praised her without fear,<br> Like a songbird singing clear,<br> Lady Yseult white and dear.<br> <br> Singing where he saw her stand,<br> "Is none like her in the land,<br> Golden hair and arrow hand."<br> <br> And such praises would he sing,<br> Harping high before the king,<br> And of many a happy thing.<br> <br> And men praised him by his name,<br> But her brows were all aflame<br> That she from the banquet came.<br> <br> And she walked alone and said,<br> "Of such knight was never read."<br> So that summer they were glad.<br> <br> But when snows were thick about<br> Yseult sent for Tristram out<br> Soft dry leaves of melilote.<br> <br> That was for a sign to stand<br> That he came to take her hand<br> In the happy garden land.<br> <br> For he sent her words to see,<br> "Yseult, of thy courtesy,<br> Have now pity as of me,<br> <br> "For my love is barren here."<br> To him came an answer clear<br> Of the lady white and dear.<br> <br> So that when his love had got<br> Those dry leaves of melilote,<br> He the pain remembered not.<br> <br> But he saw not where to go,<br> Lest his feet some man should know,<br> For the ways were marred with snow.<br> <br> So his bitter doubt he wrote,<br> And she sent him for his doubt<br> The same leaves of melilote.<br> <br> And he marvelled; but he said,<br> "Tho' I die, her rede be read."<br> And for help of Love he prayed.<br> <br> And it seem&egrave;d well to go<br> By the court where slept he now,<br> Right against her in the snow.<br> <br> And at night she came and spake,<br> "Tristram, as for love's true sake,<br> All my pleasure bid me take."<br> <br> And he sware her will to do,<br> And she smiled that it was so;<br> "I shall hear thee thro' the snow."<br> <br> A great wonder took him there,<br> For her face was very fair<br> Under all her gathered hair.<br> <br> And more near and soft she stept,<br> And both arms about him crept,<br> That for bitter love he wept.<br> <br> All his heart was drawn in two<br> That he wist not what to do;<br> And she kissed him, thinking so.<br> <br> Then she raised him tenderly,<br> Bore him lightly as might be,<br> That was wonderful to see.<br> <br> So they passed by trail and track,<br> Slowly, in the night all black,<br> And she bore him on her back.<br> <br> As they twain went on along,<br> Such great love had made her strong,<br> All her heart was full of song.<br> <br> Pausing, she breathed sharply there;<br> And about her, bowed and bare,<br> Flashed and fell the golden hair.<br> <br> Pausing, round her body sweet<br> Rolled the ripe hair to her feet;<br> Forth she bare him as was meet.<br> <br> Thro' the court all white and wide<br> Straight across from side to side<br> Bare she him in patient pride.<br> <br> She was hurt with snow and stone,<br> Came no sob nor any moan.<br> That with bare feet had she gone.<br> <br> And when all her pain was great,<br> Smiling in such evil state<br> Did she walk beneath his weight.<br> <br> And his heart yearned sharp for her,<br> And he would not breathe or stir<br> For a pain of bitter fear.<br> <br> Till she stood on the strewn floor<br> Right within the chamber door,<br> With the weight of love she bore.<br> <br> When he stood beside her there<br> Smiling, she drew back the hair<br> From her throat and bosom fair.<br> <br> All her neck was strained and red;<br> Then soft words to him she said,<br> Leaning on his face her head.<br> <br> And his kisses on her hair<br> And her throat and shoulders bare<br> Fierce and bitter kisses were.<br> <br> Then he wept for anger sweet,<br> Flung him down to touch her feet<br> And to kiss them as was meet.<br> <br> And above him while she stood,<br> Stains upon her red as blood;<br> Then she kissed him as he would.<br> <br> So great love that time had they;<br> And would God that I could say<br> All their love by year and day.<br> <br> Now three years this thing had been,<br> And no wrath was them between,<br> For the love he bare the queen.<br> <br> Till a knight they loved of old<br> To Sir Mark this marvel told,<br> To the king so lean and cold.<br> <br> A great shadow took his face,<br> Somewhat low he spake in place<br> And flushed red in little space.<br> <br> Then his hands began to stir,<br> Plucking at his face and hair,<br> Shameful things he spake of her.<br> <br> Sware he by his fathers dead<br> (Then his thin face was not red),<br> "She shall bear the steel," he said.<br> <br> So he bade to wreak his thought<br> She should bear the white steel hot;<br> But the nobles hearkened not.<br> <br> Then most shameful things he spake<br> That the nobles for his sake<br> Seem&egrave;d not their sense to take.<br> <br> And she spake where men might see,<br> "Thou, Sir Mark, that shamest me,<br> None I gave my hand but thee.<br> <br> "And if other ever were<br> (And a great scorn made her fair)<br> It was he that standeth there."<br> <br> Then great laughter laugh&egrave;d all,<br> For against the outer wall<br> Evil-clad he stood in hall.<br> <br> And the men for very shame<br> Spake her quit of ill defame,<br> And Sir Mark bade praise her name.<br> <br> But for love he bare her so<br> Softly bade she Tristram go;<br> Thence to both was wail and woe.<br> <br> So he went from her apace;<br> And she dwelt by Mark in place<br> With a trouble in her face.<br> <br> 	     CANTO 4<br> <br> <i> How Sir Tristram came to Brittany</i> <br> <br> So much grief for him was made,<br> All the land was changed and sad,<br> But Queen Yseult nothing said.<br> <br> Then came Tristram the good knight<br> From his lady's noble sight,<br> All athirst for toil and fight.<br> <br> So he went by many ways<br> Thro' strange lands by many days,<br> And in wars he won him praise.<br> <br> Then for love of Lancelot<br> And the praise his love had got<br> Came the knight to Camelot.<br> <br> There beheld he Guinevere,<br> All her face like light was clear,<br> That men shook for loving fear.<br> <br> And more smooth than steel or glass<br> All her happy forehead was,<br> Thro' her eyes some dream did pass.<br> <br> And he thought of Yseult now,<br> "For this lady's eyes and brow<br> She might stand with her, I trow."<br> <br> But the king and Lancelot<br> For the great praise he had got<br> Did him welcome as they mote.<br> <br> So long time he dwelt with them,<br> In his fight was found no blame<br> That he won a noble name.<br> <br> All men for his sake were glad,<br> But in thought he ever had<br> The gold hair that Yseult clad.<br> <br> And he thirsted for one tress,<br> Praising her in humbleness.<br> Men him called of Lyonesse, <br> <br> For that so his birth had been.<br> And when many months were seen<br> Took he farewell of the queen.<br> <br> Farewell of the king he took,<br> And set sail with heavy look,<br> For this time he could not brook.<br> <br> All his heart so weary was<br> And so worn with love, alas!<br> With great love in bitter case,<br> <br> That he thirsted thence to be,<br> So they sailed the blowing sea<br> Till they came to Brittany.<br> <br> He was shent in evil plight,<br> As one soiled with storm and fight,<br> Yet he stood a perfect knight.<br> <br> For his face was fair and strong,<br> And his body straight along,<br> And his deep speech like a song,<br> <br> And his eyes were clear and sad<br> As the bitter love they had,<br> Men for him great marvel made.<br> <br> And they told him how their lord<br> Died in war with hand on sword,<br> Died and held his knightly word.<br> <br> So his daughter had their land,<br> Yseult of the white snow-hand,<br> Pale and still they saw him stand.<br> <br> Then as one in pain he stirred,<br> Speaking low some loving word<br> In a voice that no man heard.<br> <br> And a great smile overtook<br> All the trouble of his look,<br> And he neither breathed nor spoke.<br> <br> When he came by her in place,<br> He beheld her small sweet face<br> And pure eyes of patient grace.<br> <br> All her face was hushed and dim<br> As her courcet's pearl&egrave;d rim<br> With a maiden fear of him.<br> <br> And in courteous wise she bade<br> That fair honour should be had<br> Of the knight so pale and sad.<br> <br> So he dwelt beside her long,<br> In his heart he would no wrong,<br> But she drew it like a song;<br> <br> Some dim song at waking heard<br> When the tender gloom is stirr'd<br> With the joy of some sweet bird.<br> <br> So he gladly dwelt by her<br> In the grey great castle there,<br> And she grew a lady fair.<br> <br> And she mused of him alone,<br> Musing when the day was done<br> By the ranges of black stone,<br> <br> Till her eyes grew strange and deep,<br> And it seemed they could not sleep<br> Tho' men saw she did not weep.<br> <br> And all men that saw her loved<br> For her quiet eyes approved<br> All her changes when she moved;<br> <br> And each day by her he came<br> For the love of her sweet name<br> And her love who bare the same.<br> <br> And as days were come and gone,<br> With no laughter and no moan,<br> Love grew up ere doubt was done.<br> <br> Deep in her sweet soul she kept<br> All the tender pain that slept<br> So far down, she never wept.<br> <br> But in all her heart she said,<br> "If such care for me he had,<br> Certes I were dear and glad."<br> <br> And it fell one gentle day<br> In the greenest week of May,<br> That her sorrow went away.<br> <br> For the day was nearly done,<br> And among the woods alone<br> Was Sir Tristram softly gone.<br> <br> All about the woods were green,<br> Walked he in the leaves between,<br> Thinking sweetly of the queen.<br> <br> What great love he won of her,<br> And he thirsted for her here,<br> Arrow hand and golden hair.<br> <br> Her old praises did he sing,<br> Hidden in the happy spring<br> Sang he many a bitter thing.<br> <br> And the leaves about him shook,<br> For great weeping overtook<br> All his voice and quiet look.<br> <br> And the snow-hand of her grace<br> Sought him in the garden place,<br> With a doubt in her sweet face.<br> <br> And she heard his singing low,<br> Clear glad words she seemed to know,<br> And she loved him, singing so.<br> <br> "This was praise that Yseult wan,<br> That to any maid or man<br> Spake she courteous as she can.<br> <br> "This was praise that Yseult had,<br> That her happiness made glad<br> Man or maiden that was sad."<br> <br> And hereat the sorrow broke<br> Thro' the happy words he spoke,<br> And the quick tears marred his look.<br> <br> But the lady whiter grew,<br> White as fear and pale as dew,<br> So his voice her spirit drew.<br> <br> For she fain would comfort him,<br> And she shook in heart and limb,<br> And her eyes were hot and dim.<br> <br> "Ah," she said, "our love is so<br> That he will not speak of woe,<br> And I dare not come to know.<br> <br> "For I would not any change<br> Came to make this old life strange,<br> Or throw love beyond its range.<br> <br> "Yet indeed he sang my name."<br> And a slow blush overcame<br> Her bowed face with maiden flame.<br> <br> "And he spake sweet things of me<br> For pure love and courtesy<br> Where none else had cared to see.<br> <br> "I that am but simple maid<br> Shall he give me love," she said,<br> "With men's praise to crown his head?<br> <br> "Yet I ween he sang my name,"<br> And again the glorious shame<br> All her sweet face overcame.<br> <br> Then he met her, grave and mild,<br> And the maiden lips that smiled<br> Trembled as a chidden child.<br> <br> And his heart went up for her,<br> Till each thought that harboured there<br> Rose as pure as any prayer.<br> <br> And he wist that it were well<br> In her quiet love to dwell;<br> So their marriage-time befell.<br> <br> For in love to her he spake<br> And was troubled for her sake,<br> And the grief her love might make.<br> <br> And in quiet maiden wise,<br> While a light fled thro' her eyes<br> Faster than a shadow flies,<br> <br> Spake she to him, very low,<br> Then a fear did overflow<br> All her heart lest he should know.<br> <br> But the knight her soft love knew,<br> And her spirit sweet and true<br> Where the love lay light as dew.<br> <br> And such grave pure speech he made<br> That to listen bowed her head<br> With still joy of that was said.<br> <br> And the maiden love snow-pure<br> In her heart should well endure,<br> Like a fair tree planted sure.<br> <br> For she loved him as the light,<br> And was fairest in his sight<br> As a lake the noon keeps bright.<br> <br> So their day of love was glad,<br> And his face nor proud nor sad,<br> So his maiden bride he had.<br> <br> And great joy was thro' the land<br> When in love the twain should stand,<br> Tristram and the sweet snow-hand.<br> <br> Then much grief for him was made,<br> All the land was changed and sad,<br> But the cold king's heart was glad.<br> <br> So came Tristram the good knight<br> From his lady's noble sight,<br> All athirst for toil and fight.<br> <br> And great praise he won him there,<br> So that all men spake him fair<br> For the wondrous name he bare.<br> <br> And when Yseult heard them speak<br> Died the pain that kept her weak,<br> Died the sorrow from her cheek.<br> <br> Forth to Camelot he came,<br> Riding silent as in shame<br> Thro' the noises of his fame.<br> <br> When was made his welcome there,<br> He beheld Queen Guinevere,<br> All her face like light was clear.<br> <br> Thro' her eyes a dream did pass,<br> And more smooth than steel or glass<br> All her happy forehead was.<br> <br> So he thought, "For eyes and brow<br> She might stand by Yseult now,<br> Yet were mine as fair, I trow."<br> <br> All men for his sake were glad,<br> But in thought he ever had<br> The gold hair that Yseult clad.<br> <br> And he thirsted for her eyes<br> As a bird that bleeds and flies<br> For the fountain where it dies.<br> <br> And he yearned to touch her hand,<br> As a river drawn thro' sand<br> Thirsts to reach the smooth green land.<br> <br> And he pined to kiss her mouth,<br> As a rose in dewless drouth<br> For the warm rains of the south.<br> <br> So for thirst of her sweet look<br> And the hair that shone and shook,<br> Night or day he could not brook.<br> <br> Ere a leaf had left its tree,<br> Sailed he all the blowing sea<br> Till he came to Brittany.<br> <br> 	     CANTO 5<br> <br> <i> Of the bridal night of Sir Tristram and the Lady Yseult aux Blanches Mains</i> <br> <br> So at night the maidens came;<br> And they called her by her name,<br> And she followed without shame.<br> <br> And the singing-maidens there<br> Led the bride with tresses bare,<br> Singing bridal songs of her.<br> <br> Purple flowers, blue and red,<br> On the rushes round the bed<br> Strewed they for her feet to tread.<br> <br> But about the bed they set<br> Large white blossoms, white and wet,<br> Crowns the fairest they could get.<br> <br> Her blue robe along the hem<br> Coloured like a lily's stem,<br> She put off and gave to them.<br> <br> And she bade the fairest girl<br> All her soft hair comb and curl<br> With a comb of jet and pearl.<br> <br> By the mirrored steel she stood,<br> Thinking gently as she could<br> Sweet new thoughts of womanhood.<br> <br> In his eyes that she would please<br> Will she seem the queen of these,<br> With the hair swept round her knees?<br> <br> Then the tallest maiden came,<br> Called her softly by her name;<br> And she lay down without shame.<br> <br> Then came Tristram softly in;<br> Long he stood without, I ween,<br> Thinking old thoughts of the queen.<br> <br> Sweet old thoughts he could not say,<br> How in other times he lay<br> By Queen Yseult till the day.<br> <br> Softly to the bed he came;<br> But between the taper's flame<br> A fair face looked out at them.<br> <br> He lay down and dreamed: but she<br> Lay and looked towards the sea;<br> And a bitter dream dreamt he.<br> <br> But he stood away and said:<br> "Lo, an evil rede were read<br> If I had her maidenhead.<br> <br> "One that I love more than her<br> Dwells across the water fair,<br> Yseult of the golden hair.<br> <br> "And for love that she has worn<br> Men will smite her face with scorn,<br> Shame that such a queen were born!<br> <br> "Lo, to both much ill were done,<br> For this Yseult, loving one,<br> Loves but him below the sun.<br> <br> "And great shame will overtake<br> All her beauty for my sake<br> If her maidenhood I break.<br> <br> "And this thing shall never be<br> That for maiden love for me<br> Men should shame her as they see.<br> <br> "For some men will say, 'Behold, <br> Yseult queen, the hair of gold<br> Was his paramour of old.'<br> <br> "And for love I loved before<br> Shall they call her paramour."<br> So he mus&egrave;d long and sore.<br> <br> And the maiden in his sight<br> Lay beside him, very bright,<br> Like a sleeper, straight and white.<br> <br> Then he thought him, lying there,<br> Of Queen Yseult's golden hair<br> And the brows of Guinevere.<br> <br> Spake the snow-hand maidenly,<br> "Tristram, for thy courtesy<br> Think thou no scorn to kiss me."<br> <br> A great tremble took his heart,<br> Many memories made him start,<br> Listening as he lay apart.<br> <br> Sidelong to him crept she close,<br> Pale as any winter rose<br> When the air is grey with snows.<br> <br> For she heard him start and stir,<br> And drew ever near and near<br> Lest his heart were wrath with her.<br> <br> But his eyes grew very dim,<br> And a tremble went thro' him<br> Shuddering over heart and limb.<br> <br> For pure love of her he wept<br> As in fear she crept and crept<br> Slowly, lest perchance he slept.<br> <br> Soft as lighteth bird on bough<br> Thrice he kissed her, breathing low,<br> Kissed her mouth and maiden brow.<br> <br> And in under breath said he<br> When his face she could not see,<br> "Christ look over her and me."<br> <br> Low sweet words of love she said<br> With her face against his head<br> On the pillows of the bed.<br> <br> Then a pleasure bright and mild<br> Smoothed her sweet face, and she smiled,<br> Sleeping as a maiden child.<br> <br> And his hands for love of her<br> From the throat and shoulders bare<br> Parted off the ruffling hair.<br> <br> Then he kissed her hair and head<br> For the sweet words she had said;<br> And in kissing her he prayed.<br> <br> Praying in his heart he spake,<br> That for Mary's maiden sake<br> Christ would keep his faith awake.<br> <br> And the sweet saints knew aright<br> That he bore him well in fight,<br> Warring ever in their sight.<br> <br> And the Mother pitied him,<br> For he shook in heart and limb,<br> Lying in the chamber dim.<br> <br> And he bowed his body fair<br> Down athwart the window there,<br> Weeping for the golden hair.<br> <br> It was wonderful to see<br> That he wept so bitterly<br> With his face to the blown sea.<br> <br> As he turned and softly stept,<br> Lest perchance she had not slept,<br> Bitterly he wept and wept.<br> <br> She lay out before him there,<br> All her body white and bare<br> Overswept with waves of hair.<br> <br> There she rested, breathing low,<br> Purer than the naked snow,<br> Beautiful to see and know.<br> <br> In her sleep she spake and prayed;<br> And for those dear words she said,<br> He came softly to the bed.<br> <br> And in love he would not hide,<br> Praying between pain and pride,<br> Laid him softly at her side.<br> <br> So from evening till the day <br> At her side in love he lay;<br> Slept no child as pure as they.<br> <br> So her love had all it would,<br> All night sleeping as she could,<br> Sleeping in her maidenhood.<br> <br> 	     CANTO 6<br> <br> <i> How Queen Yseult kept her ring</i> <br> <br> Days are come and days are gone<br> Over Cornwall many a one,<br> Since her ordeal was done.<br> <br> Mark was tender with his fear,<br> Lest some worse thing he should hear,<br> And bade all men honour her.<br> <br> So Queen Yseult's days were fair,<br> And her maidens, waiting bare,<br> Combed and crowned the golden hair.<br> <br> But King Mark would keep apart,<br> Lest her eyes should make him start,<br> Full of envy was his heart.<br> <br> And his face grew long and lean<br> And his lips more pale, I ween,<br> Hiding harsh words of the queen.<br> <br> And in bitter speech he said,<br> When much wine had filled his head,<br> A bad prayer that she were dead.<br> <br> So the court began to stir,<br> And the maidens gathered near,<br> Whispered secret things of her.<br> <br> And most bitter pain she had,<br> Pain&egrave;d thro' her speeches glad,<br> Till her heart grew faint or mad.<br> <br> In the pleasure that she made<br> At the revels the king bade,<br> Wild and wandering words she said.<br> <br> And at night when all the room<br> Spread about her black and dumb,<br> She lay gazing thro' the gloom.<br> <br> All old comfort she forgot,<br> And her throat and lips grew hot,<br> And her large eyes moistened not.<br> <br> Then she thought the grave were cold,<br> And spake soft her name of old,<br> "Yseult, queen, the hair of gold."<br> <br> And she wept for that one thing,<br> For she looked upon the king,<br> And drew forth her golden ring.<br> <br> Slept King Mark upon the bed,<br> Thick hot wine had filled his head,<br> Some fierce word in sleep he said.<br> <br> She had thought long since to hear<br> Speech of Tristram spoken clear,<br> That his life was kept for her.<br> <br> And when any knight came nigh<br> To her place for courtesy,<br> Saw she Tristram standing by.<br> <br> And when songs of her were sung,<br> Heard his voice the leaves among<br> Singing in the sweet French tongue.<br> <br> And when harpers harped anew,<br> Very pale and faint she grew<br> Like a lily dead in dew.<br> <br> So she held him dead and lain<br> Out beyond the water-plain,<br> Naked under sun and rain.<br> <br> In the dark she rose to weep,<br> "Long wet tendrils clasp and creep<br> Where the good knight lies asleep."<br> <br> No one heard the words she said<br> On the pillows of the bed,<br> Praise and prayer for Tristram dead.<br> <br> No one saw her girdle slip,<br> Saw her loosen it to weep,<br> Thinking how he touched her lip.<br> <br> Heavily her robe sank white,<br> Heavily her hair sank bright,<br> Rustling down in the dead night.<br> <br> And her breast was loosened so<br> From the hunger of its woe,<br> Where the samite rustled low.<br> <br> Cloth&egrave;d queenlike sate she there,<br> Sate she in the moonlight bare,<br> Golden light and golden hair.<br> <br> To much evil was she brought,<br> Very bitter things she thought<br> Thro' her quiet lips said naught.<br> <br> And the sweet saints pitied her<br> As they saw the weeping hair,<br> And the face so very fair.<br> <br> At her side no queen might stand,<br> Was none like her in the land,<br> Golden hair and arrow hand.<br> <br> Then she prayed, if any heard,<br> And the air about her stirr'd<br> As the motions of a bird.<br> <br> And she thought an angel came,<br> Poised his wings of painted flame,<br> And spoke bitterly her name.<br> <br> For she bowed before his look,<br> And her heart such trembling took,<br> That her limbs with weeping shook.<br> <br> Then she rose and did not pray,<br> Far off sounds she heard at play<br> Blown about a windy bay.<br> <br> Down athwart the window bright<br> Leant she into the dead light,<br> Wept for Tristram the good knight.<br> <br> The deep sky and sharp grey crag,<br> Black with many a jut and jag,<br> The pale stream where stirred the flag,<br> <br> All the long white lines of sea,<br> All the long white slope of lea,<br> In the moonlight watch&egraved she.<br> <br> Then again she sank to weep,<br> In the rushes rustling deep,<br> Flung a white and golden heap,<br> <br> And she thought, "The world is wide,<br> Somewhere I might flee and hide,<br> So the king should ease his pride.<br> <br> "And thereafter will he know<br> All the chance of this our woe,<br> And repent him, hearing so.<br> <br> "He will say in all men's sight<br> That this Yseult had not right,<br> Who took Tristram for her knight.<br> <br> "If King Mark should weep," said she,<br> Thinking what a woe might be,<br> "Shall not all men pity me?<br> <br> "For none ever," soft she said,<br> "Any truer woman had<br> Than this Tristram that is dead.<br> <br> "All things had my lord of me,<br> Love and help and mercy free,<br> And my thought his thought to be."<br> <br> So her heart was comforted<br> Of the bitter pain it had,<br> As she lay down on the bed.<br> <br> And the saints sent sleep to her,<br> In the moonlight very fair,<br> Golden light and golden hair.<br> <br> She remembered that old night<br> When across the courts all white<br> Bare she Tristram the good knight.<br> <br> And she smiled with pride anon,<br> As came to her one by one<br> All the mercies she had done.<br> <br> How for very love she bore<br> Things no woman knew before,<br> And would bear for evermore.<br> <br> And a dumb great smile smiled she,<br> And it deepened still to see,<br> Till she laughed low laughters three.<br> <br> And she said, "This love put by<br> (In a holy voice and high)<br> Shall not perish tho' I die.<br> <br> "And when men shall praise him dead<br> (Both her cheeks flushed royal-red)<br> All my story shall be said.<br> <br> "For I shall not blush to know<br> (And she rose up, speaking so)<br> That men speak of this my woe.<br> <br> "For that I love Tristram well<br> (And her voice rang like a bell)<br> Is no shame for them to tell.<br> <br> "Since indeed no shame it were<br> (Said she, shaking back her hair)<br> That one loved him thrice as fair.<br> <br> "For such knight was never seen<br> (Spake most loftily the Queen)<br> Since a noble man has been.<br> <br> "For the wars he warred of old<br> (Straight she drew the hair of gold)<br> In all people will be told.<br> <br> "So by Tristram the good knight<br> (All her face was full of light)<br> Shall I stand in all men's sight.<br> <br> "Hair and eyes and smile and speech<br> (Soft she wove it, plait and pleach)<br> Gave I to Sir Tristram each.<br> <br> "Men would praise me oft in place<br> (Wondrous was her lighted face)<br> For my smile and spoken grace.<br> <br> "Many singers sang of me<br> (Stately stood she, as a tree)<br> For pure heart and courtesy.<br> <br> "Thought and grace and loving heart<br> (She looked up with lips apart)<br> All I gave to be his part.<br> <br> "Now there is no more to say<br> (Said she softly as one may)<br> Tho' I die for him ere day."<br> <br> And she knew the measures bland,<br> "Is none like her in the land,<br> Golden hair and arrow hand."<br> <br> All day long the eager light<br> Was a trouble in her sight,<br> And the festal lamps by night.<br> <br> Then the king soft speeches made,<br> Half in hate and half afraid,<br> And she loathed the words he said,<br> <br> Tho' she hearkened not a whit;<br> And a sorrow vexed her wit,<br> Ever turning over it.<br> <br> And her pride was made most weak,<br> And a shadow blind and meek<br> Took her brows and altered cheek.<br> <br> And old thoughts about her came<br> When the dais was all aflame<br> With large lights, each day the same.<br> <br> And she wist not what to say<br> Could not move her lips to pray<br> For the heart that beat alway.<br> <br> And she paused before her glass,<br> For so tight the girdle was<br> By her breast, she could not pass.<br> <br> And she thought, "If he should come<br> Back across the grey salt foam<br> I were altered in his doom.<br> <br> "Nay," she said, "for love were there,<br> And the corn-ripe golden hair,<br> Tho' the face should be less fair."<br> <br> Then she smiled, and faintlier<br> Came the silken courtly stir;<br> But the king's eyes hated her.<br> <br> And their straight cold look she knew,<br> And again more faint she grew<br> Than a lily dead in dew.<br> <br> So she saw days go and come,<br> And at night in the old room<br> Lay she gazing thro' the gloom.<br>
