## THE QUEST OF MERLIN A PRELUDE

### by

## RICHARD HOVEY

  
*Interior of a cavern in the bowels of the earth, beneath Mount Hecla.
Huge rock-fragments, amid which twists tortuously a great root of the
tree Yggdrasil. A flickering flame, by the light of which are seen the*
**NORNS** , *colossal but shadowy shapes, about a gigantic but
indistinct Loom. Dull, heavy sounds, out of which arises a strange
music, which resolves itself continually into imperfect harmonies, which
leave the heart in unrest. A sense of striving and struggle beats
through the music.*  
**THE NORNS** . We are the Recorders!  
We are the Finishers!  
Nothing we initiate;  
All things we fulfil.  
Odin initiates  
And Freyja and Loki,  
Divine Balder and the other Immortals.  
Whatsoever they begin,  
Relentlessly we fulfil.  
  
Ye, too, O men, are as gods;  
Ye are free and the free create;  
Ye have part in the Imperishable.  
Ever as ye follow the Beautiful,  
Shall the worm transfigure itself  
And the new-born god appear.  
But over your destinies we sit in doom;  
Whatsoever ye begin,  
Relentlessly we fulfil.  
  
Think and we seize the thought;  
Act and the deed once done  
Sinks into our iron hands.  
Only the unthought thought, O man,  
Is thine own and the deed forborne.  
Thou canst neither love nor doubt  
But the doubt and the love alike  
Pass into the infrangible weft of the world  
That we weave with inexorable fingers.  
  
We are the Queens of Time,  
And, while Time is, we endure.  
With the calm of the Empyrean  
We mix not, neither dwell we therein;  
But over the shifting  
Our shuttles are inflexible.  
God having given us Time,  
Over Time we are greater than God.  
We are the Finishers.  
  
\[ *A low, foreboding roll of thunder.--* **MERLIN** *appears on a
jutting crag in the cave, with a forked wand in his hand.--The flame
flashes into sudden brilliancy, sharply defining the rocky walls of the
cavern, but at once sinks back into its former weak and flickering
indistinctness.--The* **NORNS** *remain motionless, noting none of these
things, nor do they actually perceive* **MERLIN** *at any time* .\]  
**MERLIN** . Hail!  
Ye monstrous Glooms!  
Formless Forms!  
Known and Unknown!  
To what avail  
Through strifes and storms,  
Athwart the Sea that bellows and booms  
In the ear  
With the threatening of dire dooms,  
Strove I once alone  
In the starless vast of the night of fear,  
Dread Queens, to behold your throne?  
Lo, all that passes  
From your touch takes shape,  
Yet in you I find not any shape at all.  
Dimly the dusk glasses  
To the view  
Shadows that fall  
Into the Void; the Verities escape.  
Without you seeing is not nor thought,  
But you--  
Woe! I discern you not.  
  
**URD.** Sisters, how should a man's eyes see the Void?  
  
**VERDANDE** . Shadows of clouds he scans on a searchless sea.  
**  
SKULD** . Between two Deeps a film of mist that shifts!  
  
**MERLIN** . Shadowy ones!  
Ye whom my eyes have seemed to see  
Many times in the weary years!  
Deeper and darker the riddle appears;  
Muddier the river runs.  
What are ye, Darknesses? Whence have ye risen?  
Are ye or seem ye? What is it to seem or to be?  
With the same awe I re-behold you  
As when I first clave o'er the unroadwayed sea  
And through the cavernous darks of Hecla's womb  
The way to Odin's tomb--  
To your earth-bound prison.  
  
**VERDANDE** . The shuttle flies. The noise of men far off  
Breaks faintly on our ears like a distant surf.  
  
**MERLIN** . Prison, I call it, I hold you--  
You, the Resistless, Monarchs of Days--  
As verily slaves as we.  
Slaves of the stone sceptre your own hands wield  
Over the weirds of the world--  
Or of some mightier Silence whose ways  
I find not without me revealed  
Nor within me enfurled.  
  
**URD** . I hear a voice above the noise of men,  
Like a bird's thin shriek shrilling o'er the surf.  
  
**MERLIN** . Ever thus!  
I pass and return,  
But ye remain ever the same.  
I see the weft wax and the pale flame burn;  
I hear the dark words and ominous:  
But never to me ye turn;  
Me ye call not by name.  
  
**SKULD** . The surf booms on, the billows break and cease,  
And the gull's cry dissolves into the wind.  
  
**MERLIN** . Answer my thought!  
Ye have answered before,--  
So mightily wrought  
My strenuous lore.  
By the wand in my hand  
I command you to show  
All the veils may conceal,  
That it ails me to know.  
Man and wife, is it weal?  
Man and wife, is it woe?  
Ye see not the wand;  
Ye see not the mage:  
As two straws in your hand  
Are the fool and the sage.  
Ye know not I utter;  
Ye know not ye heed;  
But the words that ye mutter  
Shall answer my need.  
Speak!  
  
**VERDANDE** . Woe to the maiden, for her doom is dark!  
  
**SKULD** . Woe to the knight! His thread is stained with blood.  
  
**URD** . Woe to the Prince! For a witless fault great woe!  
  
**MERLIN** . Alas! for all mortals  
Sorrow sits waiting.  
Man, hesitating,  
Into the Future peers.  
From the dark portals  
Issue the Fears.  
  
**VERDANDE** . Weal for the lovers, after many days!  
  
**URD** . Ay, but they first shall sail a bitter sea!  
  
**SKULD** . Weal for the King, but not till the kingdom pass!  
  
**MERLIN** . Weal and woe!  
A dark saying!  
Yeaing and naying!  
How shall I know?  
  
**URD** . The seer and the seeing and the seen--  
Are not these three things known and yet unknown?  
  
**VERDANDE** . To live is better far than not to live--  
Yea, and to live is worse than not to live.  
  
**SKULD** . The womb--the tomb--and each of these is all--  
And he that acts, is wise and is unwise.  
  
**MERLIN** . A womb and a tomb!  
No more?  
  
**VERDANDE** . Who weds this woman hath a royal wife.  
  
**URD** . Behold the man she loves, a king of men!  
  
**SKULD** . Each man must choose his wife and bide his lot.  
  
**MERLIN** . She loves the Prince!--  
A queenly one!--  
Whom else should he wed?  
Who else should share his throne?  
Daughters of Time! ye speak and convince.  
I have chosen a way to tread.  
  
**URD** . Marriage the calm gods give, a crown of life;  
Marriage we give, not they, a kissing curse.  
  
**MERLIN** . A rhymeless Rune--  
Is and Is Not.  
Solve me the riddle!  
Is there no overword?  
  
**VERDANDE** . Darkness and light ring round the globe of things,  
And each pursues the other as it flies.  
  
**MERLIN** . Know ye the wand?  
With the wand I compel you.  
  
**SKULD** . A Dragon slaying forever a deathless Queen!  
There is no wit in us to make this clear.  
  
**MERLIN** . Not in you?  
Where then? In myself?  
\[ *He strikes his own forehead with the wand.-- A black formless mark
appears on his brow.--He falls in a swoon.* \]  
**THE NORNS** . Over the Loom  
Brooding and bending,  
Weave we the ending,  
Self-decreed doom,  
A robe for repayment.  
  
Hands from the Nowhere  
Reach the threads here to us.  
Hands only appear to us.  
Knowing not the Living Ones,  
Weave we their raiment.  
  
He who beholds us,  
Seeing no others  
Timeless and Free,  
Knows us and knows us not--  
But finds not the Mothers.  
  
Into the void deeps,  
Blackness of Darkness  
Above and about him,  
Dizzily down  
Falls he forever.  
\[ *As the* **NORNS** *sing, the scene becomes more and more indistinct,
until, at the last stanza, their words issue from utter darkness.--A
confused sound, like a low rumbling. Then a clear tenor voice is heard
singing: "* Nonne anima plus est quam esca; et corpus plus quam
vestimentum?"-- *A ray of light breaks through the darkness, and now the
song of the* **SYLPHS** *is heard. The light grows brighter, until, when
the* **SYLPHS** *cease singing, the scene is completely illuminated.--It
is a grove, with a Greek temple in the background.* **MERLIN** *lies,
still in his swoon, upon the ground.-- The* **NORNS** *have disappeared,
and beautiful figures, in classic drapery, pass in and out among the
trees.* \]  
**SYLPHS** . The fleet wind's footing  
Is light on the roses.  
Wherever he goes is  
The lilt of his luting,  
Sweet, sweet.  
  
The little green apples  
He sways and swings.  
The leaves are a-quiver,  
Touched by his wings.  
The cheek of the river  
Dimples and dapples,--  
Sweet, sweet.  
  
The light mist-wreathing  
Is drifted and thinned.  
The lark flies flinging  
His song on the wind.  
The wind with his singing  
Mingles its breathing,--  
Sweet, sweet.  
  
There is no one wisteth  
The way that it goeth.  
The wind bloweth  
Whither it listeth,--  
Sweet, sweet.  
  
**GNOMES** \[ *beneath, unseen* \]. Ho, ho! Ho, ho!  
In the earth below,  
Like worms that coil  
In a slow turmoil,  
We huddle and struggle  
And delve and toil.  
Ho, ho! Ho, ho!  
Merrily O!  
  
Under the ground,  
Clogged and bound,  
We strive and strain  
To be rid of the chain,  
As a caged beast rages  
To roam again.  
Ho, ho! Ho, ho!  
For the brooks to flow!  
  
Hear ye us? Hark!  
We're at work in the dark,  
And in and out  
We burrow about  
Amid caves and graves  
With a song and a shout--  
Ho, ho! Ho, ho!  
For the trees to grow!  
  
The old earth  
Hears our mirth  
As a thing astir  
In the womb of her,  
A boding of birth  
And a harbinger.  
Ho, ho! Ho, ho!  
For the flowers to blow!  
  
  
**NAIADS** \[ *in a stream in the background* \]. Maidenly strong,  
With a joyous song,  
Very merrily is the river as it ripples along.  
The vales are voicing  
A great rejoicing;  
Earth laughs with flowers as the sky with morn,  
For a child is born,  
For a child is born.  
Sing softly.  
  
From sky and earth  
Is the river's birth--  
O the gentle joy of the river's mirth!  
There is never a staying  
In all its playing--  
Waylaying and straying from morn to morn--  
For a child is born,  
For a child is born.  
Sing softly.  
  
Who knows--who knows  
Why the river flows?  
Coming and going--what comes and goes?  
There is no resting  
In all its hasting.  
What is it that ripples and leaps along  
With a glad, sweet song,  
With a ceaseless song?  
Sing softly.  
  
**ANGELS** \[ *above, in a burst of sunlight* \].  
Glory to God in the highest!  
Osanna! Osanna!  
Behold, His dwelling is the Sun  
And the glory thereof His open doors.  
He and the blue of heaven are one  
And the Sea's dædal-paven floors.  
He is the Beholden;  
With Him to be is to be seen;  
Without Him spring were never green  
Nor autumn golden;  
By Him the nerves of sight are stirred;  
Beside Him there is nought but Night;  
He uttereth His eternal word,  
"Let there be light," and there is light.  
Glory to God in the highest!  
Osanna! Osanna!  
\[ *The* **ANGELS** *disappear, soaring upward; the* **NAIADS** *sink
under the waters; and the* **SYLPHS** *fade into the air.* \]  
**MERLIN** \[ *awakening* \]. Sweet goddess, raise thy veil! . . . A
dream, a dream!  
Methought that I was in the utter night.  
So black it was, sight was not, nay, nor thought--  
Only a sense of falling. Suddenly  
A great light shone about me and a form,  
As of a potent goddess, moved across  
The circle of my sight. Queen-like, she wore  
A threefold crown, and in her hand she kept  
A mirror wherein, wonderfully glassed,  
Meseemed I saw the mystery of things--  
Wried in a sort but rimmed about with wonder.  
And by her side there crawled a shackled slave  
That kissed the mirror. From her head there fell  
A veil that clad whatever form she bore  
In awful folds, so that I could not see  
If she were fair or foul. Yet from her gait  
A sound came singing, as it were the voice  
Of many dulcimers. Whereat I cried  
Aloud and woke. . . What vale is this? The leaves  
Show not the tiniest mote-fleck of decay.  
Each little grass-blade--ay, the very mushrooms,  
Perfect as in a poet's thought of them!  
My boyhood's dream of what the world might be!  
Ah me! I dream still. This is a sweet nothing--  
The phantasmagory of a thought-crazed brain.  
I am too old to cheat myself with dreams.  
I have dropped my plummet into the great deeps,  
But nowhere found I this. This is a dream. . .  
What eyes are those that peer between the leaves  
With laughter in their looking? Do I see  
Or do I dream I see brown beautiful arms  
And breasts half-hidden by the russet gown,  
A-shift like jack-a-lanterns in the trees?  
  
**DRYADS** \[ *half-seen in the trees* \].  
See the queer old fellow  
With the moss-gray beard!  
His eyes are bleared  
And his skin is yellow.  
Prying and peering--  
Hist! Hark!  
He can hardly see,  
For his eyes grow dark;  
And the voice of a tree  
Is too fine for his hearing.  
  
For him, when blossoms are blowing,  
No fruitage appears.  
Deaf are his ears  
To the music of growing.  
The leaf in the flower,  
The flower in the fruit,  
The fruit in the seed  
And the seed in the root!  
There is only the need  
Of the eye and the hour.  
  
Come and catch us, Grizzle!  
Why stand a-gaze?  
Take the sunshiny ways!  
Quit the fog and the drizzle!  
Break the split wand  
And be done with the magic!  
Know thyself truly,  
Half-silly, half-tragic!  
Only shown wholly  
To the Lover we stand.  
  
**MERLIN** . Something is stirring in the leaves, but what  
My old eyes grow too misty to make out.  
I catch a sound of singing, but the words  
Escape me. Alas! the wisdom of the old  
Is like a miser's hoard--laid up with toil  
To lavish on a mistress--she being dead,  
The old man counts his useless treasure over,  
More joyless that it once had brought such joy.  
\[ *Enter a rout of* **FAUNS** *, crowned with ivy and vine leaves, and
dancing and singing to the sound of their tambourines. As they sing,
they make mops and mows at **MERLIN** .\]  
**FAUNS** . Hear the crickets chirrup!  
Jolly little fellows!  
Summer's in the stirrup  
In his reds and yellows.  
The bumble-bee hangs over  
The honey-hearted clover--  
Lazy, drunken rover!  
Buzz! buzz! buzz!  
Foxes in the poultry-yard,  
Making free with chickens!  
Crows in the cornfield,  
Scratching like the dickens!  
  
\[ *Enter* **PAN** *and* **SATYRS** , *with Pan-pipes.* \]  
  
**PAN** . Pipe! pipe!  
For it's merry to live in the shade--  
To lunch on the hillside under the trees,  
To munch lush figs and oranges  
And crunch fat pig-nuts, lying at ease,  
Looking over the summer seas.  
  
**SATYRS** . Pipe! pipe!  
For it's merry to live in the shade!  
  
**FAUNS** *and* **SATYRS** \[ *softly, as* **PAN** *pipes* .\]  
Hist! list!  
While the great god Pan pipes sweetly.  
Whist! all whist!  
His fingers ripple featly  
Over the oaten keys--  
A noise as of many trees  
And of all sweet sounds together,  
Brooks that laugh in the intervales,  
Birds and bees in the dreaming dales  
The cool breeze whispering low *all-hails*  
Over the sunlit heather  
In the sleepy summer weather.  
Hist! hist!  
\[ **PAN** *sits by the river, surrounded by* **SATYRS** . *The*
**FAUNS** *gather about* **MERLIN** . *The scene becomes cloudier.* \]  
**BASSARIDS** \[ *without* \].  
On the height to-night--  
Speed the news, speed the news!  
Sting and smite  
The wind with a tempest of shrill halloos!--  
When the lynx is abroad and the red moon shines  
Through the rents in the roof of the raftered pines,  
And the black clouds rise from the muttering east  
And the hot winds storm from the tremulous south,  
There shall be the pale foam of passionate faces a-surge  
With a sea-like iterant urge,  
Round the fire and the feast,  
And the red blood shall be smirched on the blood-red mouth  
Haloo! Halloo!  
There's a feast afoot.  
The torrent howls like a hungry brute  
And the owls shriek--Tu-whoo! tu-whoo!  
  
**FAUNS** \[ *about* **MERLIN** \].  
Tickle his ear!  
Tickle his nose!  
Hey, old wrinkle-face, isn't it queer?  
Sneeze, now--sneeze--ah!---there she goes!  
\[ *Enter* **BASSARIDS** *, with cymbals, noisily. As they sing,*
**BACCHUS** *appears in a car drawn by leopards. He is surrounded by
**MÆNADS *, bearing beakers of wine.* \]  
**BASSARIDS.** Hark! the lean wolf yelps!  
And his eyes are red balls in the dark;  
And the whine of the she-bear's whelps  
Wails on the wind--hark!  
Hasten, Sun, to the dolphining west!  
Speed, black Night, from the hooded east!  
Bring to our nostrils the smell of the feast!  
Bring the locks unbound and the limbs released  
And the tigerish lover that bites the breast!  
The torn red flesh and the beakers of blood!  
And the riot and rush through the maddening wood!  
Hark! the wolf! U-lu-lo! U-lu-lo!  
  
**BACCHUS** . Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
Set the goblets ringing!  
Clink, clink! clink, clink!  
Hail, the laughter-bringing!  
  
Wine that makes the blood beat fast  
And sets the senses tingling!  
How the world goes reeling past  
To the wine-cups jingling--  
Reeling, wheeling round about,  
In and out, to and fro!--  
The trees spin with us in our rout  
And leap as long ago--ho, ho!  
And leap as long ago  
They jigged it to Amphion's lyre--  
Wine and Song have one desire.  
  
**MÆNADS** . Wine, ho! Clink, clink!  
--The goblets chime.  
Wine, ho! Drink, drink!  
So we conquer time.  
Time lies drunk among the reeds,  
Sleeping off his evil deeds.  
  
**BACCHUS** . Let the future brood and bode  
Let the past go spinning!  
Pluck the roses by the road,  
You'll find them worth the winning.  
Let the tipsy days go by,  
Take their gifts! Let them go!  
Laugh back at the laughing sky,  
And when the storm-winds blow--ho, ho!  
And when the storm-winds blow,  
Outdin the thunder-throated skies  
With tumult of your revelries!  
  
**MÆNADS** . Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
Through the veins a-laughing,  
Like a sparkle on the flow  
Of the upland brooks that go  
Seaward wavering--swift, slow!  
Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
The god pours out his life-blood so  
That madmen may be quaffing.  
\[ *The* **SATYRS** , **BASSARIDS** , *and* **FAUNS** *crowd about*
**BACCHUS** *and produce cups which they fill from his exhaustless
wine-skins. The* **FAUNS** *drag* **MERLIN** *to the centre and crown
him with vine-leaves. The* **MÆNADS** *caress him and ply him with
wine.* \]  
**MÆNADS** . Come, old wherefore-seeker,  
Let the Fates go flying!  
See within the beaker  
Joy imprisoned lying,  
Like a sunbeam taken  
In a rougish eye!  
Drink! let life awaken  
And grave-mold wisdom die!  
Thought is gray and life is green--  
These are what men choose between.  
  
**FULL CHORUS** . Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
See it foam and flash--yeo-heigh!  
Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
Let the cymbals clash!  
The deep hill-gorges  
Buffet back our orgies.  
The heart throbs quicker, quicker,  
With a lightning-leap of mirth,  
As the madness of the liquor  
Turns the blood to flaming ichor  
And makes music of the earth.  
See the crags shake to and fro,  
Toppling to the lake below!  
Wine, ho! wine, ho!  
Yeo-heigh! merrily, merrily.  
  
**A FAUN** . Thy lips are teasing to be kissed.  
  
**A MÆNAD** . Kiss me, then, but catch me first.  
  
**A SATYR** . Love dries up my throat like thirst.  
Let me clasp thee as I list!  
  
**A BASSARID** . The swift fire slays me.  
  
**SATYR** . Joy! she wavers  
  
*Another* **FAUN** . Leave us, goat-heels! She's for me.  
  
**BASSARID** . Fight it out! We like to see  
Battles for our favors.  
  
**FAUNS** *and* **SATYRS** . The garments slipping in the dance  
Show here a breast and there a thigh.  
  
**BASSARIDS** . The wild beast glares in every glance.  
  
**MÆNADS** . There are shady coverts nigh.  
\[ *Exeunt* **FAUNS** *and* **SATYRS** *tumultuously, chasing*
**MÆNADS** *and* **BASSARIDS** . **BACCHUS** , *laughing, follows them
leisurely in his car.* **MERLIN** *attempts to follow, but falls
tipsily. The scene lightens.* \]  
**PAN** . O river rippling at my feet  
Among the reeds and rushes!  
O leaves that lisp applause to greet  
The thrilling of the thrushes!  
Some prescience of the reedy life hushes the noisy stream,  
And whispering leaf to leaf, the listening bushes of bird-songs dream.
\[ *Exit* **PAN** .  
  
**ANGELS** \[ *above, unseen* \].  
The Lord God is a God of the living.  
To the works of His word  
The Lord's heart is not chary of giving  
The life-blood of the Lord.  
Through the manifold forms of His moulding  
It streams, and its working is rife,  
Forever enfleshed and unfolding--  
Life, life!  
Though the beast rend his fellow asunder  
And the hawk on the slain lark feeds,  
He hath made them whose voice is the thunder  
And He knoweth His deeds.  
Without night were no dawn  
And day were not known to be day.  
But what eye understands?  
Who knoweth His way?  
Tiger and fawn  
Alike are the work of His hands.  
Yea, Darkness He maketh and Strife,  
Who is Light and Love;  
And Death hath He wrought, who is Life;  
And Change, who sits changeless above.  
But under the earth and the heaven  
The arms that uphold them abide,  
And Death shall be slain, say the Seven  
That stand by His side.  
  
\[ *A pause* . *Enter* **MAB** *and* **FAIRIES** .\]  
  
**FAIRIES** . With the pallid lunar dawn  
Trip we forth from Avalon,  
And our mirth  
Ripples o'er the dreaming earth.  
Over hill and valley dancing  
Goes the tinkling of the beat  
Of our many-twinkling feet  
And the sound is as the glancing  
Of moonlight on the lake.  
Then when only watch-dogs wake,  
Though the gates be kept and barred,  
It goes hard  
But we mock both bars and keepers,  
And the sleepers  
Rouse not for the silvery din  
Of our noisy coming-in.  
  
Or in the glen,  
Far from the haunt of men,  
Where the solemn owls protest  
At our every light-heeled jest,  
Like the stupid-wits they are,  
With a hoot,  
There our mischief is afoot,  
And the twinkle of each star  
Laughs back at us from afar.  
  
\[ *A dance of* **FAIRIES** .\]  
  
**MAB** . Quick, fairies, to the river and scoop up  
With shell-like hands a shower of watery pearls  
To sprinkle on this ancient tippler here.  
  
**A FAIRY** . What see I here? Am I so beautiful?  
My Queen, look how the water glasses us.  
\[ *The* **FAIRIES** *are absorbed in the contemplation of their
reflection in the water. Enter* **PUCK** *and* **GOBLINS** ; *afterward*
**OBERON** , **TITANIA** , *and the* **ELVES** .\]  
**GOBLINS** . In the night,  
Guided by uncertain torches  
That affright  
Luck-belated travellers,  
We delight  
To pass beyond the porches  
Of the templed universe,  
To explore with midnight lore  
Secrets hidden from the sun--  
To seek the many in the one--  
Whether the elements be four  
Or more--  
How the rose blooms and grows,  
With what blood its petal glows--  
What meat doth it eat  
In the eyeless underground.  
Sure, some rare thing's to be found,  
If we could but fathom it.  
So we delve in doleful places  
For its traces,  
Where the dead lie inurned  
And the paint rots from fair faces,  
And the armor crumbles with rust,  
And the body is returned  
To its elemental dust.  
  
**PUCK** . Ugk-gnn! Ugk-gnn! What a lugubrious chant!  
You're not a whit better than so many frogs  
That croak at eve in some o'ershadowed pool.  
Why, what a mumbling is here of churchyards! Bats' blood!  
We're in Avalon now. Be a little gayer. Surely,  
We haven't entirely forgotten to be merry.  
For my part, I have small taste for skulls, unless  
They be sawn across and mounted for drinking-cups.  
Give me a pumpkin every time, with holes  
For eyesockets and nostrils, and a candle  
To make you think the Devil himself is in it.  
\[ *The* **GOBLINS** *have begun suddenly to dig in the ground. Out of
it they produce a shining metal* .\]  
**GOBLINS** . Lo, here! Behold  
What the earth doth hold!  
Out of the clay  
A brightness we bring,  
Better than gold,  
To the air and the day.  
It is moonlight made  
A substantial thing--  
A splendor laid  
Under the dark mould,  
By witless gnomes in the days of old.  
\[ *As the* **GOBLINS** *throw the metal up out of the earth, the*
**ELVES** *take it and build of it a bridge over the stream.* \]  
**ELVES** . We travel with a little pack  
Of wonder-tools upon each back,  
As light as any feather;  
We have a happy, handy knack  
Of putting this and that together.  
  
We spin the film of gossamer  
The woodsman brushes from his face;  
We weave the cobweb's airy lace  
No gust can rend, a breath may stir;  
We raise the mushroom's gay pavilion,  
And duskier toadstools by the million;  
We contrive the chestnut-burrs,  
Craftiest artificers.  
  
One is nothing if another  
Be not by to make it more:  
Brother atom knows its brother:  
Two and two are more than four.  
Give us tools and give us stuff--  
We'll make contrivances enough.  
  
**PUCK** . Bah! You play the sage detestably.  
Now, here's one, lying by his trunk,  
Proves his wisdom incontestably,  
Getting sapiently drunk.  
And in that condition, he perceives that marvellous structure you are so
proud of, but as a thin line of light in the eastern sky, though it is
already high noon. To the inspired vision of this bacchanalian wisdom
here, everything is upside down, the trees gambol and pirouette, and the
unintelligent ripples wink gravely and confidentially. He sees our heads
where our heels are, and our heels where our heads are, our virtues as
vices, and *vice versa* .  
Rogues true and heroes scurvy--  
So the world goes topsy-turvy.  
  
**TITANIA** . Mocker of the elfin tribes,  
Cease,  
Prithee, thy ungentle gibes.  
I will bring the man release.  
  
Mortal, who with weak sight still  
To discern the true art fain,  
I alone have will and skill  
To clear the cobwebs from the brain.  
  
Let the perfume of this flower,  
Stealing to the seat of sense,  
Free the spirit from their power  
By its holy influence.  
  
And yet I know that thou wilt spin  
Still subtler films when these be gone,  
To wrap the vacant vision in  
And dim the light of Avalon.  
  
**OBERON** . Where's Ariel? His wand shall change  
This structure that my elves have wrought,  
To something far beyond their thought,  
It is a miracle so strange.  
  
**PUCK** . You never do a thing yourself.  
But some poor devil of an elf  
Is made through weary leagues to beat  
His wings or run on restless feet,  
While you lie dreaming in the wood,  
Lapped in inactive lassitude,  
Wrapped like Morgana in the mist--  
Sometimes I think you don't exist.  
  
**OBERON** . Whimsiest of the fairy brood,  
I cannot scold you if I would.  
But keep a rein on what you say;  
When I command, even you obey,  
Who more than all delight to shirk.  
I give the law, ye do the work.  
  
\[ **ARIEL** *has appeared on the bridge, which is completed.* \]  
  
**ARIEL** . Far away I heard your call,  
Lord and master of us all.  
By your wishing I was caught  
In the shadow-land of thought,  
Where the midnight and the day  
Mingle in a twilight gray,  
Through which wander here and there  
Wondrous fantasies of air,  
Throngs of thewless Anakim,  
Cities half-discerned, and dim  
With a rosy veil of mist  
Spreading into amethyst.  
There that golden country lies,  
Sometimes seen of mortal eyes  
As a vision in the skies.  
Wretches in the desert straying  
See its silver fountains playing,  
Hasten forward to their slaying;  
For the hungry lion lies  
Couched beneath the brazen skies,  
And the vision faints and dies.  
And the simple sailor flees  
From the trancèd ships he sees,  
Glamour of diableries.  
But the graybeards smile and say,  
"Arthur's sister, Morgan Fay,  
Is in elfinland at play.  
Trust her not, for she entices  
Sagest wits with her devices.  
Lo, this is not what it seems."  
--Yet it ne'er could haunt their dreams,  
If it did not somewhere stand  
On the firm unshifting land.  
Thence I come and thither go.  
Master, what you will I know,  
And I do your bidding--so!  
\[ *He touches the bridge with his wand. It is transfigured and becomes
the rainbow-bridge, Bifrost, reaching from earth to heaven. The entire
fairy rout march up and out of sight, singing.* \]  
\[ *Enter* **APHRODITE** *and the* **LOVES** .\]  
  
**LOVES** . Dædal-throned, imperishable Aphrodite!  
Child of Zeus, O thou of the many-colored  
Spirit, crafty-hearted, devising twofold,  
Slayer and savior!  
  
Who shall praise thee? Who shall be found whose fingers  
Now may strike the Lesbian lute to greet thee  
When thou leav'st the Paphian myrtle-coverts,  
Yoking thy chariots  
  
Lesbos-ward to cleave the dissolving ether?  
Only inarticulate wild sea-voices  
Sound, O sea-born Love, where thy lost sweet singer  
Drifts with the sea-tides.  
  
Yet thy lips are sweet as of old with laughters,  
Time grows gray, but still in thy golden tresses,  
Sunlight lurks and loiters, thou Queen forever,  
Deathless and ageless!  
  
\[ *The* **VALKYRS** *appear, descending Bifrost* .\]  
  
**VALKYRS** . Ho, for the harrying  
And havoc of battle!  
The crush of the conflict!  
The clashing of spears!  
Ho, for the hero!  
  
Many and mighty  
The foemen that meet him,  
A white-hot mass  
Of hammered metal!  
Weapon and warrior  
Welded in the war-forge!  
So they surround him,  
But he, heavy-handed,  
Hacking them dauntlessly,  
Does them to death.  
  
We from Valhalla  
Hasten and hover  
Over the war-valley,  
Heartening the heroes.  
Ho, for the strong man,  
Stout-hearted in strife,  
Overthrown but unthralled,  
Overborne but unbroken,  
Daring and doing,  
Mighty of will!  
  
**LOVES** . What strange goddesses these, slender, with streaming
hair,  
Clean-limbed, vigorous, tall, fair as the pine is fair?  
Lithe, strong, virginal forms treading with martial gait  
Down yon sevenfold arch, resolute, stern, elate?  
Lo, their helmets upcast splendors that stream to heaven,  
Seven lights from the bridge, up from the helmets seven!  
Conquest sleeps in their eyes, victory binds their brows,  
Strength lies still on their lips, waiting till wars arouse.  
Whence and why do they come, halting before our Queen?  
What have we for their wills, passionless and serene?  
Yet are they wondrous fair, fair in a sweet, strange wise,  
With the sunlight in their hair and the blue sky in their eyes.  
  
**VALKYRS** . Lo, the Goddess we seek!  
The Queen from the South!  
Lo, her delicate cheek!  
Her adorable mouth!  
Her eyes that are limpid with laughters, and sparkle as springs never
dried by a drouth!  
O gentleness, bending  
With royal reserve!  
O queenliness blending  
With langours that swerve  
Down the sweep of the lines of imperial limbs, that, stately and
splendid of curve,  
Rise poised like the calla,  
Superb in its grace!  
The gods in Valhalla,  
O Queen, are a-gaze  
With the rapture of rumors that reach them and rouse them to look on the
light of thy face!  
Come, then, and o'er us  
Thy radiance throw!  
In the heart of our chorus  
Let love lie aglow,  
As the breath of the brief northern summer that wakens the May-flowers
under the snow.  
  
**APHRODITE** . Maidens and gods and messengers of gods,  
I see you fair and goodly and made bright  
With flashing armor and with floating hair.  
Not otherwise of old I saw the queen,  
Hippolyta, whom yet for all her spears  
I made to follow where at first she fled,  
Compelling to rebellious loyalty,  
Subduing her proud will to Theseus' love,  
Even as the smiling of the sun subdues.  
For strength is good, but strength that knows not love  
Is as a random archer in the dark,  
And many shafts are shot whose flight is vain,  
And some work evil. Yet not this alone--  
Ye bring me gifts as I bring gifts to you.  
Love without will and might of the strong arm  
Is bitterness and ashes of dead fruit.  
Be my attendants, then; I need your spears.  
  
**LOVES** *and* **VALKYRS** . Throw open your arms, O Valhalla!  
Cry out and rejoice!  
For she comes with the sunlit hair  
And the face divinely fair,  
And the brook-soft voice;  
And a whisper of lutes is heard,  
The rustle of unborn leaves in the air  
And the song of an unseen bird.  
  
Lift up your heads, O ye gates,  
And the Queen of Love shall come in,  
With the steel of the north in her hand  
And the heart of the south within;  
And the snow shall melt from the frozen land,  
And the summer leaves be green.  
Lift up your heads, O ye gates,  
And the Queen of Love shall come in!  
  
\[ *Exeunt, singing, over the bridge Bifrost.* \]  
\[ *Enter* **ARGENTE** *and eight* **MAIDENS** *, crowned with wreaths
and carrying garlands in their hands.* \]  
**MAIDENS** . Rosebuds and apple-blossoms!  
Fairer than they seem!  
In our hair and in our bosoms  
Lying in a dream!  
  
Living and dreaming--  
Visionless and mute--  
Underneath their simple seeming  
Lurketh flower and fruit.  
  
Denying and averring  
As yet they do not know--  
Only an unconscious stirring  
Where the thought shall grow.  
  
Dreams of joy and sweetness  
Fill each rosy leaf,  
And the yearning for completeness  
Is a dream of grief.  
  
Wise without intellection,  
Dreaming toward their fate,  
Perfect in their imperfection,  
Let them wait--  
Let them wait.  
  
**MERLIN** . If that thou be a spirit, or a dream,  
Or but a wonder of sweet maidenhood,  
I know not. But, I pray thee, maid or dream  
Or spirit, be as gracious as thy looks.  
I am a man much worn with years and sorrows.  
Hither have I come I know not how, and where  
I am I know not. Guide me hence, I pray,  
--Or, since thou seemest attended as a queen,  
Bid one of these thy servants go with me  
And set my foot upon some way that leads  
To many-towered Camelot. There I dwell  
And serve King Arthur, counselling his reign.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Thou sayest; I am a queen. But I reign not in the fashion
that thou deemest;  
Neither are these servants, but my kinswomen, among whom I am crowned by
love only,  
Service with service exchanging, their least with my most counted
equal.  
One, not unknown to thee, Merlin, is near, the ninth of my maidens,  
And she, when she cometh, shall conduct thee whithersoever thou wilt.
The way is  
Not long to the battlements of Camelot, though long from Camelot
hither.  
  
**MERLIN** . I know not how thou knowest my name, and yet  
With many marvels I am so distraught  
That I no longer gape at anything.  
What art thou, lady, and what place is this?  
  
**ARGENTE** . I am the Lady of the Lake, and this is the valley of
Avalon.  
The violets of spring and the roses of summer and the fruitage of
autumn  
Here burgeon together, and the North here mingles with the South and is
lost in it  
As a lover is that lingers in the arms of his mistress till he swoons
and is one with her.  
Once hitherto hast thou seen me, O Merlin, when Nimue the water-witch  
Sent thee with Arthur to the lake-shore, for a gift that should gain him
his kingdom;  
And there clave through the sheen of the shield that the lake holds up
to the heaven  
An arm for the boss of it that bare the great brand, Excalibur, and
brandished it;  
And Arthur with a cry sprang down to the shore where a light skiff lay
for his using  
And leaped to the oars, and the boat shot forward like the darting of a
kingfisher,  
Swift-sent by the urge of his eagerness out into the serene
fire-splendor,  
Till it stopped in the centre a-quiver as a arrow is that strikes in a
target.  
Then from my hands he received it.--But lo, she comes--Nimue!  
  
\[ *Enter* **NIMUE** .\]  
  
Hail, sister!  
  
**NIMUE** . Hail, my Queen!  
  
**MERLIN** . What, the beautiful Nimue!  
  
**NIMUE** . Welcome to Avalon, Master!  
  
**MERLIN** . O lady, I should rather do  
Thee reverence. Alas, what kingship sits  
In these gray hairs? Master? The child treads firmlier  
Over rough ways; but I, the seer, am blind  
And grope and stumble like a man in the dark.  
  
**NIMUE** . Ay, but if thou stumblest in paths where another would
perish--!  
Blind? Rather say keen-eyed as the hunter that follows  
The fleet-foot goat on the mountain, till, lost in the cloud-mist,  
Sheer at his feet gulfs gaping, he stops in amazement,  
Dizzy and doubting--but another had never dared climb there.  
  
**MERLIN** . Thy words are like a wood-brook in my ears.  
But, gentle lady, I am sick at heart:  
Increase of knowledge increaseth mysteries;  
And, knowing much, I know that I know nothing.  
  
**NIMUE** . Yet something I hold it, being man, to put question as
thou  
To the gods, though the gods render answer in riddles.  
  
**MERLIN** . Ah, me!  
Too well I know the bridgeless vast between  
The most high gods and men. Let but these limbs  
Be once more lithe and tense, and so endure--  
These smouldering eyes flame with immortal fire--  
What do I say?--Make the soul young again  
To tread with step perennially light  
The ways of thought and passion, and o'erleap  
The hedges and the dykes of circumstance--  
There were the god-like!--then I might dare think . . .  
Of what is less than a day-defeated dream.  
  
**NIMUE** . Why breakest thou so suddenly off, too modest?  
Dreams are from God. So oft is an oracle spoken.  
  
**MERLIN** . Thy words are as a lure to the fatal springe  
Of mine own folly. Nimue, Nimue! . . .  
First time I saw thee, 't was in a frail skiff  
Among the water-lilies of the lake--  
Standing upright, borne on without wind or oar,  
As if the spirit of the flowers had risen  
Over them in a mist and, floating there,  
Rounded at last to definite shape--in thee.  
Since then at night I have seen thee by my bed  
And in the day--But I have not been a fool.  
Mere man am I and weak with years, nor choose,  
Leaping at godhood, to fall back to earth,  
Crippled and bleeding.  
  
**NIMUE** . Manhood is godhood in germ--  
Aught less is brutishness. Anywise, whoso would win,  
Be it godhood or devilhood, must leap.  
  
**MERLIN** . I have talked face to face  
With gods and demons, and have dared to seek  
The awful cavern of the Norns and held  
Strange questionings with them; yet none the less  
I know myself--mere man. Not mine to hope  
Youth and the goal, the joy of mastership,  
The poise of achievement--these are for the gods.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Thou camest from Hecla hither?  
  
**MERLIN** . Ay, but by some strange route I know not of.  
  
**NIMUE** . Dark riddles speak they, the sullen-muttering Norns.  
Why wouldst thou scan their searchless mysteries?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Concerning what didst thou demand of them?  
  
**MERLIN** . Of Arthur and the maiden, Guenevere.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Seeks Arthur, then, a queen?  
  
**MERLIN** . He would be wed.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Beware lest he find a queen, but not a wife!  
Let him not marry her, Merlin!  
Ah, woe! I see a great woe in the land.  
  
**MERLIN** . Shall all his might be lost with which he strove,  
Building the mightiest throne in the round world,  
The noblest--for failure of a hand to keep  
His conquests? For a child is as oursleves,  
Renewed, corrected, wiser for our lives,  
Achieving wholly where we partly failed.  
  
**ARGENTE** . With much devising we shall change no whit  
What God shall do with that which we have done.  
  
**MERLIN** . What, shall our labors fail?  
  
**ARGENTE** . The kingdom shall pass utterly.  
But he, the king, shall wear a greater crown.  
  
**MERLIN** . Knowing all this, why questionest thou me?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Yon world of days and nights where Arthur lives,  
I know but as thou knowest.  
  
**MERLIN** . Over it they rule,  
The Norns, the unfaltering.  
Why keepest thou me here, then  
With empty words?  
  
**ARGENTE** . O weak in wisdom!  
Knowest thou not, then, that here  
Thou, too, wert born.  
Camelot? The world? A dream,  
Wherein thou movest about  
Amid thin apparitions!  
  
**NIMUE** . Here, here, O Merlin,  
Delights await thee,  
Soft lips that smite and sweet hands that kiss,  
Love that decays not,  
Joy that delays not,  
Thought that grows thing  
Without groaning, a gladsome travailing.  
  
**MERLIN** . O subtly fair and beautifully wise,  
With what device wouldst thou ensnare my mind?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Understandest thou not?  
Thou, who art subtle beyond thought!  
  
**NIMUE** . O slow of faith!  
Lo, I invite thee  
Out of the shadows  
To the firm and the free.  
  
**ARGENTE** . I charge thee, as thou wouldst avert great woe,  
Let not the king take Guenevere to wife.  
  
**MERLIN** . Wouldst thou be mightier than the Norns?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Over the beginnings  
They have no power.  
Theirs but to conclude.  
  
**MERLIN** . Who shall persuade their wills?  
Who shall unspeak their words?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Even thou understandest not as yet their speech.  
  
**MERLIN** . A brittle anchor is thought;  
But the storm bellows and ramps and the gods in heaven are earless.  
Weak as it is, I cast it out to the tide.  
  
**NIMUE** . Yet are there winds that blow to a secure haven.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Wilt thou trust the hope of the world to a slender cord?  
  
**MERLIN** . Nay, what seems best to my divided soul,  
That must I do, let it be well or ill.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Ai, ai!  
The fate of the king, the grandly-defeated!  
For over many ways he toils, with hope  
High-set, to find a darkness and a chasm.  
  
**MERLIN** . What ill is this, whereof she prophesies?  
  
**ARGENTE** . Woe, woe!  
The dream of the new earth  
Is broken and shattered.  
It drives before the wind  
As torn clouds after the spent storm.  
  
**MERLIN** . What shall endure? For, although one should build  
Upon a rock, there is the earthquake. Ay,  
The earth itself shall be cast as straw in the fire,  
And there shall none know where in the trackless gulfs  
Of interstellar darkness, thundering,  
It charioted once its swift predestined way.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Ah me!  
A blessed lot is the lily's in the lake,  
That waits the rounding of its circled life  
Without the sense of unfulfilled desire.  
  
**MAIDENS** . Comfort thee, O our Queen!  
The best is yet unseen.  
Even we, as the earth-born,  
See not the very end  
To which our footsteps tend,  
Through tears and mirth borne.  
  
This use may lie in sorrow,--  
To drive the soul to strive and strain,  
Building its vast and sunsetless to-morrow,  
To escape to-day's intolerable pain.  
If to all grief a sweet surcease were given,  
How should the spirit unfold to larger scope?  
Why should we strive for heaven,  
If earth fulfilled our hope?  
  
\[ **ARGENTE** *and the maidens have withdrawn a little space* .\]  
  
**MERLIN** . O Nimue, had it been but possible,  
That thou an earthly maiden, I a lad,  
With nought to know or to forbode beyond  
The thoughts that stir the thrushes in the coverts--!  
O Age! what better boon hast thou to bring  
Than love and song? But Arthur waits for me,  
And what should I, an old man, have to do  
With dreams of a completion for myself  
Who daily weaken toward the undoing of all  
The half-wrought in me--death. Elsewhere I look  
To find the fruit grown ripe that fell in me,  
Blasted in flower-time. Arthur waits for us.  
  
**NIMUE** . Be it so, then. I summon my ministers. --Ho!  
Arise, ye that turmoil beneath there!--Yet once again  
I shall pass from thy sight as the violet light on the sea  
When the sun sinks into a cloud.--Arise, ye starvelings!--  
But, oh, my master and lord!  
Thou shalt hear in the teasing of leaves stirred by the wind,  
In the lisp of the lake through the reeds and the swan's harsh cry,  
Made strangely, mournfully sweet in the cool and the dusk  
As it comes from afar o'er the waters, a message of me;  
For I wait for thee--there in the reeds!  
As a glen in the woodland waits, with the touch of the sun  
Slant-struck through the leaves on the brook and the grasses (a
throstle  
A-lilt in the bush), till the man, world-weary, appearing,  
Worn with contention and evil, rests in her arms,  
And his fever is cooled and his limbs wax youthful and strong,  
And the sin is cleansed from his soul and the mist from his eyes,  
And the bird in his heart wakes, singing of love and peace.--  
Arise, I say, monsters!  
Arise! Earth waits and the carrion of earth!  
Hunger ye not?  
\[ *The ground opens and flames appear. Through the opening a car rises,
drawn by dragons.* **NIMUE** *enters the car and extends her hand to*
**MERLIN** *who follows her. The car rises into the air and disappears
in the distance* .\]  
**ARGENTE** . With grinning jaws  
They gape horridly,  
Bearing him back where body and soul  
Gnaw juiceless bones continually.  
Jag-toothed dragons, shutting and opening your eyes  
With hideous slowness!  
In my soul, too, is a hunger.  
Ai, ai!  
The bite of the tooth in flesh that cannot waste!  
  
**MAIDENS** . Comfort thee, O our Queen!  
Sorrow is dear to the wise,  
Who know that Love is leading,  
And believe--for have they not seen?  
Mystery of mysteries!  
The crowned brow is bleeding.  
  
**ARGENTE** . Alas, my sisters! you are good to me.  
Your presence is as starlight to my spirit.  
Your words are as a bird's song in the trees  
When all the woodland sorrows under clouds.  
I know the end is sweet--I see it plain,  
As the jay yonder the bough to which it flies.  
But oh, the way is long and the heart weak!  
Is the physician's wound less sore  
Because his cunning knows that it will heal?  
The fallen warrior  
With the broken shaft of the spear driven as a nail  
Through muscle, sinew, bone, lung, heart--  
Feels he not, though Valhalla open  
And the Valkyrs wait with cup and crown,  
Sharp anguish, intolerable gaspings that pierce  
Each with keen torture the frayed nerves, killing him  
A hundred times for once?  
Ai, ai!  
It is not all a good to see the things  
That shall be. He that will soar to topmost heaven,  
Must plunge, too, down to the voiceless lowest of hell.  
Ye shall not know the good without the evil,  
Saith the Lord God.  
Ai, ai! I see the maiden stand in the choir.  
The royal robes are girt upon her. Priests  
And choristers intone monotonously.  
The sunlight falling bloodily through the panes,  
Is dim and thick with incense. The King comes!  
I see him take her fatal hand in his.  
Otototoi! The breath of the god  
Tingles on my forehead!  
My flesh quivers with its power!  
The dread that hung over me sunders as a cloud.  
A sunlit garden--lay this behind the gloom?  
And he--is he my fear?  
Beautiful as Balder he stands by the beautiful queen,  
High-thoughted, kingly as a cedar.  
From the high hills the woe cometh,  
A desolating avalanche! . . . .  
The scabbard, Arthur!  
Quick! The intriguing fingers close on it.  
Awake! The sword itself is less precious. Ah! . .  
Woe! woe!  
The stark bodies of the slain!--  
Spare me, Spirit that overbroods me!  
I endure not the vision!  
I am slain with intense whirling of tumultuous life!  
Back, bodeful clouds! Once again, as with inrolling waters,  
Engulf the insufferable sight!  
Otototoi!  
The din of shields and the shouts of the warriors!  
The death-birds hovering afar off! . . . .  
Where is he, my king, my beloved?  
Over the sea-like sparkle of shields I seek him--in vain.  
Ah, ah!  
There, in the crest of the war-surf--  
Arthur, Arthur!  
He struggles toward the treacherous chief. Their swords clash.  
O valiant prince! O misbegotten traitor! . . . .  
He falls--the King! the King!  
The battle sweeps away like a black cloud.  
What, ho! a rescue! knights! Kaye! Bedevere!  
Quick! To the lake! to the lake!  
Arthur, I wait for thee!  
  
\[ *She falls back exhausted and is surrounded by her maidens, screening
her from sight* .\]  
  
**MAIDENS** . Comfort thee, O our Queen!  
Through warring and woe  
The man and the woman  
Build heaven for themselves.  
From the deeps where it delves  
Uplifted, the human  
Soars to the divine,  
Though the void intervene.  
Pierce through the veils and lo,  
The sevenfold light of the shrine!  
  
\[ *Exeunt slowly, singing* .\]  
  
  
**ANGELS** \[ *above* \]. Holy! holy! holy!  
Which wert and which art and which shalt be,  
World without end! Alleluia!  
  
In Thyself is the end  
And the cause of Thy being,  
O Thou beyond name!  
In the mystery of Thy seeing,  
The eye and the vision blend.  
'Mid the shifting and fleeing  
Thou abidest the same.  
  
Death and birth  
Are the garments of Thee!  
The seed and the bud;--  
But ere these is the thought of a tree.  
Behold, the bread of the earth  
And the wine of the sea  
Are Thy body and blood.  
  
Love, which is light,  
Brings to earth the far sun.  
Love, which is life,  
Blood-red through Thy body doth run.  
Love, which is spirit, shall smite  
Thought and thing into one,  
As a man and a wife.  
  
Holy! holy! holy!  
Which art in all and through all and beyond all!  
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
