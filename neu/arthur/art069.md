## THE VISION OF THE HOLY GRAIL

### by

## EUGENE FIELD

  
  
*Deere Chryste, let not the cheere of earth,  
To fill our hearts with heedless mirth  
This holy Christmasse time;  
But give us of thy heavenly cheere  
That we may hold thy love most deere  
And know thy peace sublime.*  
  
-------  
  
Full merry waxed King Pelles court  
With Yuletide cheere and Yuletide sport,  
And, when the board was spread,  
Now wit ye well 'twas good to see  
So fair and brave a companie  
With Pelles at the head.  
  
"Come hence, Elaine," King Pelles cried,  
"Come hence and sit ye by my side,  
For never yet, I trow,  
Have gentle virtues like to thine  
Been proved by sword nor pledged in wine,  
Nor shall be nevermo!"  
  
"Sweete sir, my father," quoth Elaine,  
"Me it repents to give thee pain--  
Yet, tarry I may not;  
For I shall soond and I shall die  
If I behold this companie  
And see not Launcelot!  
  
"My heart shall have no love but this--  
My lips shall know no other kiss,  
Save only, father, thine;  
So graunt me leave to seek my bower,  
The lonely chamber in the toure,  
Where sleeps his child and mine."  
  
Then frowned the King in sore despite;  
"A murrain seize that traitrous knight,  
For that he lies!" he cried--  
"A base, unchristian paynim he,  
Else, by my beard, he would not be  
A recreant to his bride!  
  
"Oh, I had liefer yield my life  
Than see thee the deserted wife  
Of dastard Launcelot!  
Yet an' thou has no mind to stay,  
Go with thy damosels away--  
Lo, I'll detain ye not."  
  
Her damosels in goodly train  
Back to her chamber led Elaine,  
And when her eyes were cast  
Upon her babe, her tears did flow  
And she did wail and weep as though  
Her heart had like to brast.  
  
The while she grieved the Yuletide sport  
Waxed lustier in King Pelles' court,  
And louder, houre by houre,  
The echoes of the rout were borne  
To where the lady, all forlorn,  
Made moning in the toure,  
  
"Swete Chryste," she cried, "ne let me hear  
Their ribald sounds of Yuletide cheere  
That mock at mine and me;  
Graunt that my sore affliction cease  
And give me of the heavenly peace  
That comes with thoughts of thee!"  
  
Lo, as she spake, a wondrous light  
Made all that lonely chamber bright,  
And o'er the infant's bed  
A spirit hand, as samite pail,  
Held sodaine foorth the Holy Grail  
Above the infant's head.  
  
And from the sacred golden cup  
A subtle incense floated up  
And filled the conscious air,  
Which, when she breathed, the fair Elaine  
Forgot her grief, forgot her pain.  
Forgot her sore despair.  
  
And as the Grail's mysterious balm  
Wrought in her heart a wondrous calm,  
Great mervail 'twas to see  
The sleeping child stretch one hand up  
As if in dreams he held the cup  
Which none mought win but he.  
  
Through all the night King Pelles' court  
Made mighty cheer and goodly sport.  
Nor never recked the joy  
That was vouchsafed that Christmass tide  
To Launcelot's deserted bride  
And to her sleeping boy.  
  
*Swete Chryste, let not the cheere of earth  
To fill our hearts with heedless mirth  
This present Christmasse night;  
But send among us to and fro  
Thy Holy Grail, that men may know  
The joy withe wisdom dight.*
