## THE SPEECHES AT PRINCE HENRIES BARRIERS

### by

## BEN JONSON

  
The Lady of the Lake, first *discouered* .  
  
A Silence, calme as are my waters, meet  
Your raysd attentions, whilst my siluer feet  
Touch on the richer shore; and to this seat  
Vow my new duties and mine old repeat.  
Lest any yet should doubt, or might mistake  
What *Nymph* I am; behold the ample lake  
Of which I am stild; and neere it MERLINS tombe,  
Graue of his cunning, as of mine the wombe.  
By this it will not aske me to proclaime  
More of my selfe, whose actions, and whose name  
Were so full fam'd in *Brittish* ARTHVRS court;  
No more then it will fit me to report  
What hath before bene trusted to our squire  
Of me, my knight, his fate, and my desire  
To meet, if not preuent his destiny,  
And stile him to the court of *Britany* ;  
Now when the Iland hath regain'd her fame  
Intire, and perfect, in the ancient name,  
And that a *monarch* æquall good and great,  
Wise, temperate, iust, and stout, *claimes* ARTHVRS seat.  
Did I say æquall? O too prodigall wrong  
Of my o're-thirsty, and vnæquall tongue!  
How brighter farre, then when our ARTHVR liu'd  
Are all the glories of this place reuiu'd!  
What riches doe I see; what beauties here!  
What awe! what loue! what reuerence! ioy! and feare!  
What ornaments of counsaile as of court!  
All that is high and great, or can comport  
Vnto the stile of maiesty, that knowes  
No riuall, but it selfe, this place here showes.  
Onely the house of *Chiualrie* (how ere  
The inner parts and store be full, yet here  
In that which gentry should sustaine) decayd  
Or rather ruin'd seemes; her buildings layd  
Flat with the earth; that were the pride of time  
And did the barbarous *Memphian* heapes out-clime.  
Those *Obelisks* and *Columnes* broke, and downe,  
That strooke the starres, and raisd the *Brittish* crowne  
To be a constellation: Shields and swords,  
Cob-webd, and rusty; not a helme affords  
A sparke of lustre, which were wont to giue  
Light to the world, and made the nation liue,  
When in a day of honour fire was smit  
To haue put out VVLCAN'S and haue lasted yet.  
O, when this Ædifice stood great and high,  
That in the carcasse hath such maiesty,  
Whose very sceleton boasts so much worth,  
What grace, what glories did it then send forth?  
When to the structure went more noble names  
Then the *Ephesian* temple lost in flames:  
When euery stone was laid by vertuous hands;  
And standing so, (O that it yet not stands!)  
More truth of *architecture* there was blaz'd,  
Then liu'd in all the ignorant *Gothes* haue raz'd.  
There *Porticos* were built, and seats for knights  
That watched for all *aduentures* , dayes and nights,  
The *Nieces* filld with statues, to inuite  
Young valures forth, by their old formes to fight.  
With arkes triumphall for their actions done,  
Out-striding the *Collossus* of the sunne.  
And *Trophæes* , reard, of spoyled enemies,  
Whose toppes pierc'd through the cloudes, and hit the skies  
  
ARTHVR.  
Discouered as a starre aboue.  
  
And hither hath thy voyce pierc'd. Stand not maz'd,  
Thy eyes haue here on greater glories gaz'd  
And not beene frighted. I, thy ARTHVR, am  
Translated to a starre; and of that frame  
Or constellation that was calld of mee  
So long before, as showing what I should bee,  
ARCTVRVS, once thy king, and now thy starre.  
Such the rewards of all good princes are.  
Nor let it trouble thy designe, fair dame,  
That I am present to it with my flame  
And influence; since the times are now deuolu'd  
That MERLIN'S misticke prophesies are absolu'd,  
In *Brittain's* name, the vnion of this Ile;  
And clayme both of my scepter and my stile.  
Faire fall his vertue, that doth fill that throne  
In which I ioy to find my selfe so'out-shone;  
And for the greater, wish, men should him take,  
As it is nobler to restore then make.  
Proceed in thy great worke; bring forth thy knight  
Preserued for his times, that by the might  
And magicke of his arme, he may restore  
These ruin'd seates of vertue, and build more.  
Let him be famous, as was TRISTRAM, TOR,  
LAUNC'LOT, and all our List of knight-hood: or  
Who were before, or haue beene since. His name  
Strike vpon heauen, and there sticke his fame.  
Beyond the paths, and searches of the sunne  
Let him tempt fate; and when a world is wunne,  
Submit it duely to this state, and throne,  
Till time, and vtmost stay make that his owne.  
But first receiue this shield; wherein is wrought  
The truth that he must follow; and (being taught  
The wayes from heauen) ought not be despisd.  
It is a piece, was by the fates deuisd  
To arme his maiden valure; and to show  
Defensiue armes th'offensiue should fore-goe.  
Indowe him with it, LADY of the lake.  
And for the other mysteries, here, awake  
The learned MERLIN; when thou shutst him there,  
Thou buriedst valure too, for letters reare  
The deeds of honor high, and make them liue.  
If then thou seeke to restore *prowesse* , giue  
His spirit freedome; then present thy knight:  
For armes and arts sustaine each others right.  
  
LADY.  
  
My error I acknowledge, though too late  
To expiate it; There's no resisting fate.  
Arise, great *soule* ; Fate by surreption got  
May stead vs for the time, but lasteth not.  
O, doe not rise with storme, and rage. Forgiue  
Repented wrongs. I'am cause thou now shalt liue  
Æternally, for being deprest a while,  
Want makes vs know the price of what we auile.  
  
MERLIN.  
Arising out of the tombe.  
  
I Neither storme, nor rage; 'tis earth; blame her  
That feeles these motions when great spirits stirre.  
She is affrighted, and now chid by heauen,  
Whilst we walke calmely on, vpright and euen.  
Call forth the faire MELIADVS, thy knight,  
They are his fates that make the elements fight:  
And these but vsuall throwes, when time sends forth  
A wonder or a spectacle of worth.  
At common births the world feeles nothing new;  
At these she shakes; Mankind liues in a few.  
  
LADY.  
  
The heauens, the fates, and thy peculiar starres,  
MELIADVS, shew thee; and conclude all iarres.  
  
MELIADVS, *and his sixe assistants here discouered* .  
  
MERLIN.  
  
I, Now the spheares are in their tunes againe.  
What place is this so bright that doth remaine  
Yet vndemolishd? or but late built! O  
I read it now. St. GEORGE'S *Portico* !  
The supreme head of all the world, where now  
Knighthood liues honord with a crowned brow.  
A noble *Scene* , and fit to shew him in  
That must of all worlds fame the ghirland winne.  
  
LADY.  
  
Do's he not sit like MARS, or one that had  
The better of him, in his armor clad?  
And those his sixe assistants, as the pride  
Of the old *Græcian Heroes* had not died?  
Or like APOLLO, raisd to the worlds view,  
The minute after he the *Python* slew.  
  
MERLIN.  
  
'Tis all too little, LADY, you can speake.  
My thought growes great of him, and faine would breake.  
Inuite him forth, and guide him to his tent,  
That I may read this shield his fates present.  
  
LADY.  
  
Glory of knights, and hope of all the earth,  
Come forth; your fostresse bids; who from your birth  
Hath bred you to this hower, and for this throne.  
This is the field to make your vertue knowne.  
If he were now (he sayes) to vow his fires  
Of faith, of loue, of seruice, then his squires  
Had vttered nothing for him: But he hopes  
In the first tender of himselfe, his scopes  
Were so well read, as it were no decor'me,  
Where truth is studied, there to practise forme.  
  
MERLIN.  
  
No, let his actions speake him; and this shield  
Let downe from heauen, that to his youth will yeeld  
Such copy of incitement: Not the deedes  
Of antique knights, to catch their fellowes steedes,  
Or ladies palfreyes rescue from the force  
Of a fell gyant, or some score to vn-horse.  
These were bold stories of our ARTHVRS age;  
But here are other acts; another *stage*  
And *scene* appeares; it is not since as then:  
No gyants, dwarfes, or monsters here, but men.  
His arts must be to gouerne, and giue lawes  
To peace no lesse then armes. His fate here drawes  
An empire with it, and describes each state  
Preceding there, that he should imitate.  
First, faire MELIADVS, hath shee wrought an Ile,  
The happiest of the earth (which to your stile  
In time must adde) and in it placed high  
*Britayne* , the only name, made CAESAR flie.  
Within the neerer parts, as apt, and due  
To your first speculation, you may view  
The eye of *iustice* shooting through the land,  
Like a bright *planet* strengthned by the hand  
Of first, and warlike EDWARD; then th'increase  
Of trades and tillage, vnder lawes and peace,  
Begun by him, but settled and promou'd  
By the third *Heroe* of his name, who lou'd  
To set his owne aworke, and not to see  
The fatnesse of his land a portion bee  
For strangers. This was he erected first  
The trade of clothing, by which arte were nurst  
Whole millions to his seruice, and releeu'd  
So many poore, as since they haue beleeu'd  
The golden fleece, and need no forrayne mine,  
If industrie at home doe not decline.  
To proue which true, obserue what treasure here  
The wise and seuenth HENRY heapt each yeere,  
To be the strength and sinewes of a warre,  
When MARS should thunder, or his peace but iarre,  
And here how the eighth HENRY, his braue sonne,  
Built forts, made generall musters, trayn'd youth on  
In exercise of armes, and girt his coast  
With strength; to which (whose fame no tongue can boast  
Vp to her worth, though all best tongues be glad  
To name her still) did great ELIZA adde  
A wall of shipping, and became thereby  
The ayde, or feare of all the nations nigh.  
These, worthyest Prince, are set you neere to reade,  
That ciuill arts the martiall must precede.  
That lawes and trade bring honors in and gayne,  
And armes defensiue a safe place maintayne.  
But when your fate shall call you forth to'assure  
Your vertue more (though not to make secure)  
View here, what great examples shee hath plac'd.  
First, two braue *Britayne Heroes* , that were grac'd  
To fight their *Sauiours* battailes, and did bring  
Destruction on the faithlesse; one a king,  
RICHARD, surnamed with the *lyons heart* .  
The other, EDWARD, and the first, whose part  
(Then being but Prince) it was to lead these warres  
In the age after, but with better starres.  
For here though *Coeur de lion* like a storme  
Powre on the *Saracens* , and doth performe  
Deedes past an angell, arm'd with wroth and fire,  
Ploughing whole armies vp, with zealous ire,  
And walled cities, while he doth defend  
That cause that should all warres begin and end;  
Yet when with pride, and for humane respect  
The *Austrian* cullors he doth here deiect  
With too much scorne, behold at length how fate  
Makes him a wretched prisoner to that state;  
And leaues him, as a marke of Fortunes spight,  
When Princes tempt their starres beyond their light:  
Whilst vpright EDWARD shines no lesse then he,  
Vnder the wings of golden victorie,  
Nor lets out no lesse riuers of the bloud  
Of *Infidels* , but makes the field a floud,  
And marches through it, with S. GEORGES crosse,  
Like *Israels* host to the *Ægyptians* losse,  
Through the *red sea* : the earth beneath him cold  
And quaking such an enemie to behold.  
For which, his temper'd zeale, see Prouidence  
Flying in here, and armes him with defence  
Against th'assassinate made vpon his life  
By a foule wretch, from whom he wrests the knife,  
And giues him a iust hire: which yet remaynes  
A warning to great chiefes, to keepe their traynes  
About 'hem still, and not, to priuacie,  
Admit a hand that may vse treacherie.  
Neerer then these, not for the same high cause,  
Yet for the next (what was his right by lawes  
Of nations due) doth fight that MARS of men,  
The black Prince EDWARD, 'gainst the *French* , who then  
At Cressey field had no more yeeres then you.  
Here his glad father has him in the view  
As he is entring in the schoole of warre,  
And powres all blessings on him from a farre,  
That wishes can; whilst he (that close of day)  
Like a yong lyon, newly taught to prey,  
Inuades the herds, so fled the *french* , and teares  
From the *Bohemian* crowne the plume he weares,  
Which after for his crest he did preserue  
To his fathers vse, with this fit word, *I SERVE* .  
But here at *Poictiers* he was MARS indeed.  
Neuer did valour with more streame succeed  
Then he had there. He flow'd out like a sea  
Vpon their troupes, and left their armes no way:  
Or like a fire carryed with high windes,  
Now broad, and spreading, by and by it findes  
A vent upright, to looke which way to burne.  
Then shootes along againe, or rounde doth turne,  
Till in the circling spoile it hath embrac'd  
All that stood nigh, or in the reach to wast:  
Such was his rage that day; but then forgot  
Soone as his sword was sheath'd, it lasted not,  
After the King, the *Dauphine* , and *french* Peeres  
By yeelding to him, wisely quit their feares,  
Whom he did vse with such humanitie,  
As they complayn'd not of captiuitie;  
But here to *England* without shame came in.  
To be his captiues was the next to win.  
Yet rests the other thunder-bolt of warre,  
HARRY the fift, to whom in face you are  
So like, as *Fate* would haue you so in worth,  
Illustrious Prince. This vertue ne're came forth,  
But *Fame* flue greater for him, then shee did  
For other mortalls; *Fate* her selfe did bid  
To saue his life: The time it reach'd vnto,  
Warre knew not how to giue'him enough to doe.  
His very name made head against his foes.  
And here at *Agin-Court* where first it rose,  
It there hangs still a comet ouer *France* ,  
Striking their malice blind, that dare aduance  
A thought against it, lightned by your flame  
That shall succeed him both in deedes and name.  
I could report more actions yet of weight  
Out of this orbe, as here of *eightie eight* ,  
Against the proud *Armada* , stil'd by *Spaine* ,  
*The Inuincible* ; that couer'd all the mayne,  
As if whole Ilands had broke loose, and swame;  
Or halfe of *Norway* with her firre-trees came,  
To ioyne the continents, it was so great;  
Yet by the auspice of ELIZA beat:  
That deare-belou'd of heauen, whom to preserue  
The windes were call'd to fight, and stormes to serue.  
One tumor drown'd another, billowes stroue  
To out-swell ambition, water ayre out-droue,  
Though shee not wanted on that glorious day,  
An euer-honor'd HOWARD to display  
S.GEORGES ensigne; and of that high race  
A second, both which ply'd the fight and chase:  
And sent first bullets, then a fleet of fire,  
Then shot themselues like ordinance; and a tire  
Of ships for pieces, through the enemies moone,  
That wan'd before it grew, and now they soone  
Are rent, spoild, scatterd, tost with all disease,  
And for their thirst of *Britayne* drinke the seas.  
The fish were neuer better fed than then,  
Although at first they fear'd the bloud of men  
Had chang'd their element; and NEPTVNE shooke  
As if the Thunderer had his palace tooke.  
So here in *Wales* , *Low Countries* , *France* , and *Spayne* ,  
You may behold both on the land and mayne  
The conquests got, the spoiles, the *trophæes* reard  
By *British* kings, and such as noblest heard  
Of all the nation, which may make to'inuite  
Your valure vpon need, but not to'incite  
Your neighbour Princes, giue them all their due,  
And be prepar'd if they will trouble you.  
He doth but scourge him selfe, his sword that drawes  
Without a purse, a counsaile and a cause.  
But all these spurres to vertue, seedes of praise  
Must yeeld to this that comes. Here's one will raise  
Your glorie more, and so aboue the rest,  
As if the acts of all mankind were prest  
In his example. Here are kingdomes mixt  
And nations ioyn'd, a strength of empire fixt  
Conterminate with heauen; The golden veine  
Of SATVRNES age is here broke out againe.  
HENRY but ioyn'd the *Roses* , that ensign'd  
Particular families, but this hath ioyn'd  
The *Rose* and *Thistle* , and in them combin'd  
A vnion, that shall neuer be declin'd.  
*Ireland* that more in title, then in fact  
Before was conquer'd, is his *Lawrels* act.  
The wall of shipping by ELIZA made,  
Decay'd (as all things subiect are to fade)  
He hath new built, or so restor'd, that men  
For noble vse, preferre it afore then:  
*Royall* , and *mightie* IAMES, whose name shall set  
A goale for all posteritie to sweat,  
In running at, by actions hard and high:  
This is the height at which your thoughts must fly.  
He knowes both how to gouerne, how to saue,  
What subiects, what their *contraries* should haue,  
What can be done by power, and what by loue,  
What should to *Mercie* , what to *Iustice* moue:  
All *Arts* he can, and from the hand of *Fate*  
Hath he enforc'd the making of his owne date.  
Within his proper vertue hath he plac'd  
His guards 'gainst *Fortune* , and there fixed fast  
The wheele of *chance* , about which Kings are hurl'd,  
And whose outragious raptures fill the world.  
  
LADY.  
  
I, This is hee, MELIADVS, whom you  
Must only serue, and giue your selfe vnto:  
And by your diligent practice to obay  
So wise a Master learne the arte of sway.  
MERLIN, aduance the shield vpon his tent.  
And now prepare, faire Knight, to proue th'euent  
Of your bold *Challenge* . Bee your vertue steeld,  
And let your drumme giue note you keepe the field.  
Is this the land of *Britaine* so renowned  
For deeds of *Armes* , or are their hearings drownd  
That none doe answere?  
  
MERLIN.  
  
Stay, me thinkes I see  
A person in yond' *caue* . Who should that bee?  
I know her ensignes now: 'Tis *Cheualrie*  
Possess'd with sleepe, dead as a *lethargie* :  
If any *charme* will wake her, 'tis the name  
Of our MELIADVS. I'll vse his *Fame* .  
*Lady* , MELIADVS, lord of the Iles,  
Princely MELIADVS, and whom *Fate* now stiles  
The faire MELIADVS, hath hung his shield  
Vpon his tent, and here doth keepe the field,  
According to his bold and princely word;  
And wants employment for his pike, and sword.  
  
CHEVALRY.  
  
Were it from death that name would wake mee. Say  
Which is the Knight? O I could gaze a day  
Vpon his armour that hath so reuiu'd  
My spirits, and tels me that I am long liu'd  
In his apparance. Breake, you rustie dores,  
That haue so long beene shut, and from the shores  
Of all the world, come knight-hood like a flood  
Vpon these lists, to make the field, here, good,  
And your owne honours, that are now call'd forth  
Against the wish of men to proue your worth.  
  
THE BARRIERS.  
*After which* MERLIN *speakes* .  
  
Nay, stay your valure, 'tis a wisdome high  
In Princes to vse fortune reuerently.  
He that in deeds of *Armes* obeyes his blood  
Doth often tempt his destinie beyond good.  
Looke on this throne, and in his temper view  
The light of all that must haue grace in you:  
His equall *Iustice* , vpright *Fortitude*  
And settled *Prudence* , with that Peace indued  
Of face, as minde, alwayes himselfe and euen.  
So HERCVLES, and good men beare vp *heauen* .  
I dare not speake his vertues for the feare  
Of flattring him, they come so high and neare  
To wonders: yet thus much I prophesy  
Of him and his. All eares your selues apply.  
You, and your other you, great King and Queene,  
Haue yet the least of your bright *Fortune* seene,  
Which shal rise brighter euery houre with *Time* ,  
And in your pleasure quite forget the crime  
Of change; your ages night shall be her noone.  
And this yong Knight, that now puts forth so soone  
Into the world, shall in your names atchieue  
More *ghyrlands* for this state, and shall relieue  
Your cares in gouernment; while that yong lord  
Shall second him in *Armes* , and shake a sword  
And launce against the foes of God and you.  
Nor shall lesse ioy your royall hopes pursue  
In that most princely *Mayd* , whose forme might call  
The world to warre, and make it hazard all  
His valure for her beautie, she shall bee  
Mother of *nations* , and her Princes see  
Riuals almost to these. Whilst you sit high,  
And lead by them, behold your *Britaine* fly  
Beyond the line, when what the seas before  
Did bound, shall to the sky then stretch his shore.
