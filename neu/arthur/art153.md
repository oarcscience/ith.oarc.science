## GOD'S GRAAL

### by

## DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI

  
     The ark of the Lord of Hosts  
Whose name is called by the name of Him  
Who dwelleth between the Cherubim.  
  
O Thou that in no house dost dwell,  
But walk'st in tent and tabernacle.  
  
For God of all strokes will have one  
In every battle that is done.  
  
Lancelot lay beside the well:  
     (God's Graal is good)  
Oh my soul is sad to tell  
The weary quest and the bitter quell;  
For he was the lord of lordlihood  
And sleep on his eyelids fell.  
  
Lancelot lay before the shrine;  
     (The apple tree's in the wood)  
There was set Christ's very sign,  
The bread unknown and the unknown wine  
That the soul's life for a livelihood  
     Craves from his wheat and vine.
