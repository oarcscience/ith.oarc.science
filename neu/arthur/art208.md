## A SONG THAT TROSTAN MADE

### by

## ELLA YOUNG

  
  
If I were a king's son  
I would give you a white hound  
In a leash of silver,  
I would give you a white stallion  
From over the sea.  
I would give you a cloak of purple  
Wrought with findruiny,  
And shoes of white bronze,  
If I were a king's son.  
  
You would talk with me  
In the bright-coloured palace:  
You would be glad at my coming,  
If I were a king's son.
