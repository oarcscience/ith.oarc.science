## KING ARTHUR'S DEATH from *RELIQUES OF ANCIENT ENGLISH POETRY*

### by

## BISHOP THOMAS PERCY

  
  
On Trinitye Mondaye in the morne,  
   &This sore battayle was doom'd to bee,  
Where manye a knighte cry'd, Well-awaye!  
   &Alacke, it was the more pittìe.  
  
Ere the first crowinge of the cocke,  
   &When as the kinge in his bed laye,  
He thoughte Sir Gawaine to him came,  
   &And there to him these wordes did saye:  
  
"Nowe, as you are mine unkle deare,  
   &And as you prize your life, this daye  
O meet not with your foe in fight;  
   &Putt off the battayle, if yee maye.  
  
"For Sir Launcelot is nowe in Fraunce,  
   &And with him many an hardye knighte:  
Who will within this moneth be backe,  
   &And will assiste yee in the fighte."  
  
The kinge then call'd his nobles all,  
   &Before the breakinge of the daye;  
And told them howe Sir Gawaine came,  
   &And there to him these wordes did saye.  
  
His nobles all this counsayle gave,  
   &That earlye in the morning, hee  
Shold send awaye an herauld-at-armes,  
   &To aske a parley faire and free.  
  
Then twelve good knightes King Arthur chose,  
   &The best of all that with him were,  
To parley with the foe in field,  
   &And make with him agreement faire.  
  
The king he charged all his hoste,  
   &In readinesse there for to bee;  
But noe man shold noe weapon sturre,  
   &Unlesse a sword drawne they shold see.  
  
And Mordred, on the other parte,  
   &Twelve of his knights did likewise bringe,  
The best of all his companye,  
   &To hold the parley with the kinge.  
  
Sir Mordred alsoe charged his hoste,  
   &In readinesse there for to bee;  
But noe man sholde noe weapon sturre,  
   &But if a sworde drawne they shold see.  
  
For he durste not his unkle truste,  
   &Nor he his nephewe, sothe to tell;  
Alacke! it was a woefulle case,  
   &As ere in Christentye befelle.  
  
But when they were together mette,  
   &And both to faire accordance broughte,  
And a month's league betweene them sette,  
   &Before the battayle sholde be foughte,  
  
An addere crept forth of a bushe,  
   &Stunge one o' th' king's knightes on the knee;  
Alacke! It was a woefulle chance,  
   &As ever was in Christentìe.  
  
When the knighte found him wounded sore,  
   &And sawe the wild-worm hanginge there,  
His sworde he from his scabberde drewe;  
   &A piteous case, as ye shall heare.  
  
For when the two hostes sawe the sworde,  
   &They joyned battayle instantlye;  
Till of soe manye noble knightes,  
   &On one side there were left but three.  
  
For all were slain that durst abide,  
   &And but some fewe that fled awaye:  
Ay mee! it was a bloodye fielde,  
   &As ere was foughte on a summer's daye.  
  
Upon King Arthur's own partyè,  
   &Onlye himselfe escaped there,  
And Lukyn Duke of Gloster free,  
   &And the king's butler Bedevere.  
  
And when the king beheld his knightes  
   &All dead and scattered on the molde,  
The teares fast trickled downe his face;  
   &That manlye face in fight so bolde.  
  
"Nowe reste yee all, brave knights," he said,  
   &"Soe true and faithful to your trust:  
And must ye then, ye valiant hearts,  
   &Be lefte to moulder into dust!  
  
"Most loyal have yee been to mee,  
   &Most true and faithful unto deathe:  
And, oh! to rayse yee up againe,  
   &How freelye could I yield my breathe!  
  
"But see, the traitor's yet alive!  
   &Lo where hee stalkes among the deade!  
Nowe bitterlye he shall abye:  
   &And vengeance fall upon his head."  
  
"O staye, my liege," then sayd the duke;  
   &"O staye for love and charitìe;  
Remember what the vision spake,  
   &Nor meete your foe, if it may bee."  
  
"O staye mee not, thou worthye wight,  
   &This debt my loyal knights I owe:  
Betide my life, betide me death,  
   &I will avenge them of their foe."  
  
Then straite he grasp'd his trustye speare,  
   &And on his horse then mounted hee:  
As his butler holpe him to his horse,  
   &His bowels gushed to his knee.  
  
"Alas!" then sayd the noble king,  
   &"That I should live this sight to see!  
To see this good knight here be slaine,  
   &All for his love in helping mee!  
  
He put his speare into his reste.  
   &And to Sir Mordred loud gan crye:  
"Nowe sette thyself upon thy guarde,  
   &For, traitor, nowe thy death is nye."  
  
Sir Mordred lifted up his sworde,  
   &And fierce to meet the king ran hee:  
The king his speare he through him thrust,  
   &A fathom thorow his bodìe.  
  
When Mordered felt the stroke of death,  
   &And found that he was wounded soe,  
He thrust himselfe upon the speare,  
   &And strucke the king a deadlye blowe.  
  
Then grimmlye dyed Sir Mordered,  
   &Presentlye upon that tree:  
And bloody streames ranne from the kinge,  
   &Ere to the duke returned hee.  
  
Sir Lukyn then he thus bespake:  
   &"Sir Knighte, thou hast been faithfulle tryde;  
Nowe take my sworde Excalibar,  
   &That hangs so freelye by my syde;  
  
"O take my sword Excalibar,  
   &And there into the river throwe:  
For here, henceforth, benethe this tree,  
   &All use of weapons I forgoe.  
  
"And fare thee well, thou trustye sword,  
   & A better neer had valiant knighte;  
With thee full ofte, and many a daye,  
   &Have I withstood my foe in fighte.  
  
   &With this good fauchion in my hande,  
   &Oft have I reapd the bloody feelde:  
But nowe the fatalle houre is come,  
   &That never more I may thee weelde."  
  
The duke to the river side he went,  
   &And there his owne sword in threwe he;  
But he kept back Excalibar,  
   &He kept it back in privitie.  
  
For all of coleyne was the blade,  
   &And all the hilte of precious stone:  
"And ever alacke!" then sayd the knighte,  
   &"Must such a sword awaye be throwne?"  
  
Then backe he came unto the kinge,  
   &Who sayd, Sir Lukyn, what did yee see?"  
"Nothing, my liege, save that the winde  
   &Blewe oer the waters faire and free."  
  
"O goe againe," then said the kinge,  
   &"O good Sir Lukyn, goe againe:  
Into the rivere throwe my sword,  
   &Nor keepe me lingering here in paine."  
  
The duke then to the river went,  
   &And the kings scabberd in threwe hee;  
But he kept backe Excalibar,  
   &And hid it undernethe a tree.  
  
Then backe he came to tell the kinge,  
   &Who sayde, "Sir Lukyn, sawe ye oughte?"  
"Nothinge, my liege, save that the winde  
   &Nowe with the angrye waters fought."  
  
"O Lukyn, Lukyn," said the kinge,  
   &"Twice haste thou dealt deceytfullye:  
Alacke, whom may wee ever truste,  
   &When suche a knighte soe false can bee!  
  
"Saye, wouldst thou have thy master dead,  
   &All for a sword that wins thine eye?  
Now goe againe, and throwe it in,  
   &Or here the one of us shall dye."  
  
The duke, all shent with this rebuke,  
   &No aunswere made unto the kinge;  
But to the rivere tooke the sworde,  
   &And threwe it far as he coulde flinge.  
  
A hande and an arme did meete the sworde,  
   &And flourishd three times in the air;  
Then sunke benethe the renninge streme,  
   &And of the duke was seene noe mair.  
  
All sore astonied stood the duke,  
   &He stood as still, as still mote bee;  
Then hastened backe to telle the kinge,  
   &But he was gone from under the tree.  
  
But to what place he cold not tell,  
   &For never after hee did him spye;  
But hee sawe a barge goe from the land,  
   &And hee heard ladyes howle and crye.  
  
And whether the kinge were there or not,  
   &Hee never knewe, nor ever colde,  
For from that sad and direfulle daye,  
   &Hee never more was seene on molde.
