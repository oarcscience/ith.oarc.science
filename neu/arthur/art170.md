## GALAHAD IN THE CASTLE OF THE MAIDENS

### by

## SARA TEASDALE

  
  
(To the maiden with the hidden face in Abbey's painting)  
  
The other maidens raised their eyes to him  
Who stumbled in before them when the fight  
Had left him victor, with a victor's right.  
I think his eyes with quick hot tears grew dim;  
He scarcely saw her swaying white and slim,  
And trembling slightly, dreaming of his might,  
Nor knew he touched her hand, as cool and light  
As a wan wraith's beside a river's rim.  
The other maidens raised their eyes to see  
And only she has hid her face away,  
And yet I think she loved him more than they,  
And very fairly fashioned was her face.  
Yet for Love's shame and sweet humility,  
She could not meet him with their queenlike grace.
