All the rock-bound shore<br> Was silent, save a widowed song-bird sang<br> Far off at intervals a mournful note,<br> And on the broken crags of dark gray rock<br> The waves dashed ceaselessly.  Sir Kathanal<br> Stood with uncovered head and folded arms,<br> His soul as restless as the surging sea<br> Lashed into passion by the coming storm.<br> His helmet lay upon the sand; its crest,<br> A floating plume of deep-hued violet,<br> Was tossed and torn in fury by the wind<br> Until it seemed a thing of life.  He stood<br> And watched it, only half aware at first<br> That it was there, then scarce aware of aught<br> Besides the plume.  As in the room of death<br> Some iterated sound or motion holds<br> Attent the stricken mind, benumbed, and keeps<br> The horror of its grief awhile at bay<br> As by a spell, so now, though Kathanal<br> Had sought the sea-shore to be free of men<br> Because of his sore agony of heart,<br> And all the passion of his daring soul<br> Was tossing like the sea in fierce revolt,<br> His thoughts and gaze were centred on his crest.<br> Before the gray of sea and sky he saw<br> Naught but the waving, waving of the plume;<br> Before the vision of his love, Leorre,<br> Her tender eyes aglow with changeless light,<br> The golden splendour of her sunny hair,<br> Her winning smiles of grace and sweetness blent,<br> There came the waving, waving, of the plume;<br> Between his sorrow and his weary soul,<br> Between his trouble and his clear-eyed self,<br> There came the waving, waving of the plume;<br> Until he felt, in some half-conscious way,<br> It was his heart, and he a stranger there<br> That looked down, from a height, indifferent<br> Upon it at the mercy of the wind.<br> <br> Sudden, with that long lingering trace of youth<br> That gave to him the fascinating charm<br> Which other men were fain to emulate,<br> He quickly stooped, and tore it from his helm,<br> And cast it far out on the tossing sea.<br> It lighted on the waves a purple bird,<br> Floating with swan-like grace before the wind.<br> The action quenched impatience.  Kathanal,<br> Impulsive, passionate and sensitive,<br> In moods was ever ready with response<br> To omen and to change of circumstance.<br> He stood a moment, and then forward sprang<br> To catch it ere it vanished out of reach.<br> It was too late--the outward-flowing tide<br> Bore it from wave to wave beyond his sight.<br> <br> "Ah, God!" he cried aloud, "what have I done?<br> It is the omen of a curse to me;<br> My crest is gone, my knightly symbol lost,<br> My helm dishonoured through an act of mine."<br> <br> Then came the memory of early youth,<br> The recollection of a high resolve<br> To keep his manhood free from touch of stain,<br> To be a knight like Galahad, pure and true.<br> So few short years had passed since that resolve,<br> And yet he had forgotten loyalty<br> And truth and honour for the fair Leorre,<br> The wife of Reginault, his patron knight,--<br> The brave old man who treated him as son.<br> Long had he loved her with a knightly love,<br> And fought for her, and chosen her the queen<br> Of many a tournament.  She still was young,<br> Fairer than morning in the early spring.<br> When she had come, a gladsome bride, to grace<br> The castle of old Reginault, and warm<br> His grand old spirit into youth again,<br> Sir Kathanal had bowed before her, saying,<br> "My gracious lady, take me as your knight";<br> And she had answered, with her winning smile,<br> "You are Sir Reginault's, and therefore mine."<br> Well had he loved her from that very hour,<br> Giving her honour as his old friend's bride,<br> Making the castle ring with merriment<br> To do her service, and fulfil the hest<br> Of Reginault, who bade him use his grace<br> To make her life a round of holidays.<br> But day by day his selfish love had grown<br> From friendly service to a lover's claim,<br> Until he had forgotten Reginault<br> In her fair eyes, and all things else but her,<br> Who granted him no boon, no smallest act<br> Of love or tenderness.<br> <br>                       At last the strife<br> Between deep yearning for some touch of love,<br> And brave endeavour for self-mastery,<br> Had driven him to madness and despair.<br> To the lone sea he brought his agony<br> To face it boldly, and his spirit, quick<br> To wear new moods, caught a despondent gloom<br> From the dark omen that oppressed his soul.<br> <br> "Love is divine," he said, "and it is well<br> To love Leorre, wife though she be, for love<br> Is free to noble natures; but at last,<br> When in her shining eyes I see response,<br> Albeit unconscious, to my longing pain,<br> I cannot rest content with boonless love,<br> Although divine.  I fear me, if I stay<br> Within the circle of her tempting charm,<br> I shall, through some wild impulse, wantonly<br> Fling my unsullied knighthood to the winds,<br> As now I flung the plume from out my helm."<br> <br> He went at even-song time to Leorre,<br> And told her of his struggle by the sea,<br> Of his determined purpose and resolve.<br> "Leorre, I love you with a love unsung<br> By poets, and unknown by other men,<br> Undreamed by women; I must leave you, dear;<br> I cannot see you fair for Reginault,<br> I cannot watch your sweetness not for me.<br> I will go far upon some distant quest<br> Until this frenzy ceases, and the quest<br> Shall be for you, my love, for you alone.<br> <br> "Dear, sunny head that lights my darkened way<br> With its bright, golden glory, let me seek<br> A crown that well befits it for my quest.<br> Fair waist that curves beneath the heart I love,<br> I shall engirdle you with priceless gems<br> Won by my prowess for your perfect grace.<br> O wondrous neck! great lustrous, flawless pearls,<br> That shall be royal in their worth, to match<br> The white enchantment of your beauty fair,<br> Shall be my quest for you.<br> <br>                           "I will not come<br> Back to the court of Constantine, Leorre,<br> Until I bring that which shall honour you,<br> And winning which, I shall have cooled my pain."<br> <br> She came and knelt beside him, took his hand,<br> Looked deep into his ardent eyes,--her own<br> Like stars that shone into his inmost soul.<br> <br> "Will you, indeed, go forth," she answered low,<br> "Across the world upon a quest for me?<br> And will you falter not, nor swerve, nor fail,<br> Nor turn aside from seeking, night nor day,<br> Until you conquer with your prowess rare<br> The prize for me?  And may I choose the quest<br> I most desire?"<br> <br>                "Ah! surely, what you will,"<br> Said Kathanal, as echo to his eyes,<br> Which answered ere the words could form themselves.<br> <br> She waited, silently; the room was still;<br> Sir Kathanal was faint from drinking deep,<br> With thirsty eyes, the beauty of her face.<br> <br> At last she spoke, almost inaudibly,<br> But evermore the thought of her low speech<br> Made melody within his memory.<br> <br> "Go forth, my knight of love, o'er land and sea,<br> And purify your spirit and your life,<br> And seek until you find the Holy Grail,<br> Keeping the vision ever in your thought,<br> The inspiration ever in your soul.<br> Let Tristram yield his loyalty and honour<br> for fair Isoud, and die inglorious,--<br> Let Launcelot in Guenever's embrace<br> Forget the consecrated vows he swore,<br> And bring dark desolation on the land,--<br> My knight must grow the greater through his love,<br> The better for my favour, the more pure!<br> More than all gifts, or wealth of royal dower,<br> I want, I crave, I claim this boon of thee."<br> <br> Between the bronze-brown of his eyes and her,<br> There sudden came a faint and misty veil;<br> Through the wide-open window a sun's beam<br> Flashed on it, making o'er her bow&egrave;d head<br> A halo from his own unfallen tears.<br> He rose and lifted her, loosed her sweet hands,<br> And fell upon his knees low at her feet.<br> "Leorre, my love, my queen, my woman-saint,<br> I am not worthy, but I take your quest;<br> I will not falter and I will not swerve<br> Until I see the Grail, or pass to where<br> I see the glory it but symbols here,<br> In Paradise.  Beloved, all the world<br> Is better for your living, all the air<br> Is sweeter for your breathing, and all love<br> Is holier, purer, that you may be loved."<br> <br> "Rise, Kathanal, stand still and let me gaze<br> Upon you with that purpose in your face!<br> So brave, so resolute!  I love you Kathanal!<br> Nay! do not touch me, listen to my words!<br> Surely it cannot be a sin to speak,<br> Perchance it is a debt I owe my knight<br> For his life's consecration, once to say<br> To him, as I have said to my own heart,<br> Just how I love him.<br> <br>                     "I would follow you<br> Across the world, if it might be, a slave,<br> To serve you at your bidding night and day;<br> Or I would rouse me to my highest pride<br> That I might be your queen, and lead you on<br> To glory.  I am strong to do and bear<br> The uttermost my mind can think, for you,<br> To cheer you, help you, strengthen you; and yet--<br> I am a woman, and my senses thrill<br> If you but touch the border of my robe,<br> And if you take my hand, before the court,<br> And raise it to your lips, I faint, I die,<br> With the vast tide of my unconquered love."<br> <br> "Great Christ! how can I hear you and depart?<br> I did not know you loved me.  O my sweet,<br> Here by your side I stay; my quest shall be<br> The love-light dawning in your shining eyes."<br> <br> "Is this your answer, Kathanal," she sighed,<br> "To the unveiling of my heart of hearts?<br> No! now, if ever, you will surely go<br> On the sole quest that makes that action right."<br> <br> "Leorre, come once to me!" he said with arms<br> Outstretched to her.  Quickly she backward drew<br> With one swift whispered "Kathanal!"<br> <br>                                     "Leorre,<br> You cannot love and be so calm and still;<br> My soul would sacrifice both earth and heaven<br> For one full, rapturous kiss from those sweet lips<br> That lure me on to madness by their spell."<br> <br> "It is my love that keeps me calm," she said;<br> "Love makes us strong for what is bitterest;<br> Were we faint-hearted through imperfect love<br> We could not part; but loving perfectly<br> We are full strong for that, and all things else.<br> <br> "Farewell, my Kathanal, take as you go<br> This spotless scarf, the girdle from my robe,<br> And put it where the purple plume has been,<br> And wear it as my favour in your helm.<br> If that lost plume was darksome omen ill,<br> Let this defy it with an omen fair,<br> A prophecy to spur you on your quest.<br> My heart says it is better as it is;<br> I joy me that you flung into the sea<br> That purple plume my loving, longing gaze<br> Has often followed in the tournament.<br> Remember, purple doth betoken pain,<br> And white betokens conquest, purity;<br> Look, Kathanal, beloved, in my eyes!<br> I know that you will find the Holy Grail."<br> <br> She stood immaculate, and from those eyes<br> That oft had kindled passionate desire<br> He drew an inspiration high and pure,<br> A prescient sense of victory and peace;<br> And falling on his knees once more, he bowed,<br> Kissed her white robe, and left her standing there.<br> <br> Then followed days of struggle and dark gloom.<br> Far from the court he found a lonely cell,<br> Where morn and night he prayed, and, praying, wrought<br> A score of earnest, unrecorded deeds<br> To purify and cleanse himself from sin.<br> <br> Oft the old passion would arise and sweep<br> His spirit bare of every conquest.  Once<br> The longing and the yearning were so great,<br> So strong beyond all thought of holiness,<br> He sprang up from his bed at dead of night<br> And stopped not, night nor day, until he reached<br> His old home by the sea, and saw Leorre.<br> Her hair had its untarnished golden glow,<br> Her beauty was unchanged, but her sweet mouth<br> Had caught a touch of pathos in its smile;<br> She wore a purple robe, and stood in state<br> Beside Sir Reginault,--who greeted him<br> With tender, grave, and kind solicitude,--<br> And lifted eyes that smote upon his heart<br> With a long gaze of passionate appeal<br> That held a pain at bay deep in their depths.<br> <br> "So weak," he whispered to his heart, "for self,<br> I will be strong for her; she needs my strength."<br> <br> Again he hurried from her sight, half glad<br> For the remembered pain within her eyes;<br> Ashamed of his own soul that it was glad.<br> <br> For years he struggled, prayed, and fought his fight;<br> And sometimes when his soul was desolate<br> And he was weary from his eager quest,<br> When such a sense of deep humility<br> Would fall upon his praying, watching heart<br> That he would fain forego all in despair,<br> A marvellous ray of light, mysterious,<br> Would slant athwart the darkness of his cell,<br> Then he would rouse him to his quest once more<br> And say, "Perchance the Holy Grail is near!"<br> <br> One night at midnight came the ray again,<br> And with it came a strange expectancy<br> Of spirit as the light waxed radiant.<br> The cell was filled with spicy odours sweet,<br> And on the midnight stillness song was borne<br> As sweet as heaven's harmony--the words,--<br> The same Sir Launcelot had heard of old,--<br> "Honour and joy be to the Father of Heaven."<br> With wide eyes searching his lone cell for cause<br> He waited: as the ray became more clear<br> And more effulgent than the mid-day sun,<br> He trembled with that chill of mortal flesh<br> Beholding spiritual things.  At last--<br> Now vaguely as though veiled by light, and then<br> With shining clearness, perfectly--he saw<br> <i> The sight unspeakable, transcending words</i> .<br> <br> Forth from his barren cell came Kathanal,<br> Strong and inspired, born anew for deeds.<br> Straightway he grew to be the bravest knight<br> Under King Constantine, since Sir Sanpeur;<br> The boldest in the battles for the right;<br> The kindest in his judgment of the wrong.<br> His eyes that held the vision of the Grail<br> Were ever clear to see and know the truth;<br> His lips that had been touched by holy chrism<br> Were strong to utter holy living words;<br> He sang of life in life, and life in death,<br> And taught the lesson that his heart had learned--<br> All love should be a glory, not a doom;<br> Love for love's sake, albeit bliss-denied.<br> <br> To his old home beside the sapphire sea<br> Floated his songs and his far-reaching fame;<br> For in the land no name was loved so well<br> As Kathanal the peerless Minstrel Knight.<br> <br> Lone in her chamber sat Leorre, and heard<br> The songs of Kathanal by courtiers sung--<br> Arousing words, like a clear clarion call<br> To truth and virtue, purity and faith.<br> She clasped her hands and bent her head, and wept<br> In silent passion pent-up tears, for joy;<br> For now she knew--far off, beyond her sight--<br> Her love had seen the sacred Holy Grail.<br> And as she listened, inspiration came,<br> Irradiating all her spirit, lifting it<br> Beyond her sorrow and her daily want<br> Of Kathanal.  soft through her soul there crept<br> The echo of a benedicite,<br> Enwrapping her in calm, triumphant peace.<br> <br> Then she arose, put on her whitest robe,<br> And went out radiant, strong, and full of joy.<br>
