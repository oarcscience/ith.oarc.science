## THE RAPE OF THE TARTS

### by

## OSCAR FAY ADAMS

*  
ARGUMENT.  
  
The Queen of Hearts,  
She made some tarts  
      All on a summer's day;  
The Knave of Hearts,  
He stole those tarts  
      And carried them away!  
The Queen of Hearts,  
She missed those tarts  
      And griev'd for them full sore;  
The Knave of Hearts  
Brought back those tarts,  
      And vow'd he'd steal no more!*  
  
Isolt, the Cornish Queen, in those dark days  
When Mark, her unlov'd lord, had brought her back  
From woodland lodge where Tristram bode with her  
The space of one revolving moon, but now  
Was past to Brittany, where the white hands  
Of one with name like hers, Isolt, had snar'd  
Him with their gleam, so changeful-hearted he,  
Fell into bitter musings lasting long,  
And vexed thereby the sullen Mark, who growl'd  
His anger from behind his tangled beard,  
The more resentful that she took no heed.  
So months went by, until at last there dawn'd  
A summer morn on wave-washt Cornwall fair  
And sweet as odorous white lilies are,  
And sweet indeed to Queen Isolt, who lay  
With silken broider'd hangings round her bed  
Facing the morn. Far off the ripple broke  
Upon the beach unheard, but flasht in air  
Its silver, and in palace court the birds  
Of morning sang. Then to herself the Queen:  
  
"Lo, absent Tristram is not all in all  
To me, Mark's wife. There yet abides in life  
Something of worth, tho' Tristram be not here."  
  
The saying pleas'd her, and she turn'd it o'er.  
"Something of worth, tho' Tristram be not here."  
Then rising from the couch which Mark had left  
Ere rose the sun from out the Cornish sea,  
She call'd her waiting maidens to their task,  
And paus'd before two gowns the damsels brought,  
As doubtful how she should array herself.  
One of green samite, o'er which wander'd strings  
Of gleaming pearls, in mazy pattern set,  
So that the eye wearied to follow, held  
Her but such space while one with even breath  
Might count a dozen; then her glance upon  
The other fell, a silken robe of blue  
Shot thro' and thro' with shimmering silver lights.  
And this her choice at length for that day's wear,  
Not unforgetful how Sir Tristram lov'd  
To see her in it; and, when her waiting maids  
Had rob'd her, slowly mov'd she down the stair,  
And, after morning hunger stay'd, she past  
To where the palace cooks and scullions bode,  
In kitchen vast, whence royal dainties came.  
All sweetness seem'd her face, and music seem'd  
Her voice, when she entreated one to bring  
His cook's white apron for her royal use,  
And when her maids had clad her in it, none  
Could think her other than a gracious Queen,  
Since nothing of her royal grace was hid.  
So following her fancy's lead, she bade  
The men about her bring the wheaten meal  
And all the kitchen tools she glibly nam'd,  
And place before her on a cross-legg'd stand  
Of smoke-gloom'd oak; and then her round white arms  
She plung'd up to the elbows in the meal,  
Her red lips murm'ring,  
                  It will serve."  
                  Then, while  
The cooks and scullions stood with hands on hips  
And mouths agape to watch, she deftly mov'd  
About her task, and not with awkwardness,  
As one unus'd to kitchen toil or cares,  
But with all grace, such grace as won all hearts,  
And, ere they knew her purpose, saw before  
Their eyes row after row of pastry moulds,  
As shapely as the hands that made, and these  
The Queen herself in heated oven placed,  
And, while these brown'd in torrid darkness, sang,--  
For sweetly could Isolt of Ireland sing:  
  
"Ay, ay, O ay,--the winds that fan the fire!  
                  Fair tarts in prospect, tarts before me here!  
Ay, ay, O ay,--and tarts were my desire,  
                  And one was not enough, and one was dear:  
Ay, ay, O ay,--the winds that move so fast!  
                  And one was far, and one tart was nigher,  
And one will never bake, and one will last.  
                  Ay, ay, O ay, the winds that fan the fire!"  
  
Far up among the oaken rafters rang  
Her voice, and clear as is the tinkling fall  
Of water over rocks that chafe its course,  
And all within the kitchen felt such stir  
Within the blood as when the joyous wine  
Sweet summer music makes along the veins.  
Then one, to whom she signal'd when the strain  
Was ended, open threw the oven doors,  
And drew from warm concealment into light  
The tarts and bore them to Isolt, who straight  
Within the cup-like hollow of the tarts  
One after other placed with golden spoon,  
On which were graven deep the Cornish arms,  
The lucent jellies quivering like leaf  
Of aspen when all else is still, and sound  
And other motion dead within the wood.  
This done she bade the cooks have careful charge  
Of these, her tarts, till she should send, then past--  
Her cook's white apron doft--upward to halls  
Befitting her fair presence more, and, sleep  
And summer both at once assailing, slept.  
  
Now on the selfsame morning fair Etarre,  
Awaking with Sir Pelleas's sword across  
Her throat and Gawain's, felt her fancy turn  
To him who might have slain her, sleeping, yet  
Forbore because of former love, and said  
To him who lay beside her, false Gawain,  
"Go hence, and see me nevermore!" The Prince,  
Who deem'd he knew all women's changeful ways,  
Laught lightly, and essayed to kiss, as oft  
Before, the warm white hollow of her throat.  
But she, recoiling, flasht such sudden wrath  
He, too, drew back, and slowly rose and heard  
From lips grown stern, from lips his own had prest,  
The sentence, "Go! and see me never more."  
Then he, much marveling on women's ways,  
Obey'd, and went with slow, reluctant feet  
Without, and mounted horse, and past across  
The courtyard and thro' postern portal, past  
Down garden slopes with musky breathings fill'd,  
To where the gates, wide open, led to fields  
And far beyond them forest shades. Thro' these  
He went and wander'd on to where the walls  
Of Mark's great palace rose across his view.  
Then, for the summer noon was hot, he drew  
His rein beneath a giant oak that made  
A welcome shadow near the gate, and mus'd  
Yet more on changeful women's ways till came  
On vagrant breeze a whiff of pastry thence  
And woke a sudden hunger in his breast.  
  
Meanwhile in hall Isolt of Ireland slept,  
And slumb'rous summer silence crept o'er all  
The serving men and maids, till one whose care  
Had been the tarts to watch, a lad in years  
But few and wits as scant as years, awak'd  
From dream unquiet, and awaking, saw  
The Prince Gawain through kitchen gliding soft,  
Bearing the great, tart-laden dish. Whereat  
The lad rose, terror stricken, shrieking loud,  
"The tarts." Again, and like a descant, "Gone!  
The tarts."  
                  Loud shrill'd the cry thro'out the court,  
And each took up the words till rang from wall  
To wall the mournful echo:  
                  "Gone, the tarts!"  
Fast swell'd the cry and louder with each voice  
That wail'd the theft until the Queen awak'd  
And hearing what had happ'd felt her heart sink  
And visions toothsome of the well-bak'd tarts  
For royal supper fade to naught, and sat  
To tears abandon'd and to grief a prey.  
  
But false Gawain to saddle leaping, tarts  
In dish upborne, saw all the rabble rout  
Of palace kitchen fast behind pursue,  
And one in saddle follow'd while the rest  
The shrill cry echo'd, "O, the tarts! the tarts!"  
Forth from the gates the chase was had until  
The steed of Prince Gawain stumbl'd and threw  
Him, bearing still the unspill'd tarts, upon  
A grassy bank where those who follow'd found  
And brought him, still tart-laden, to Isolt.  
  
Naught said Gawain to temper his disgrace,  
But let his eye a moment rest upon  
The Queen, an eye that many maidens lov'd,  
Then fall demurely on the toothsome tarts.  
That she, mov'd somewhat by his grace and glance,  
That admiration show'd, forgave the theft,  
And thinking:  
                  "Lo, a goodly man he seems  
Since Tristram is not by," upon him laid  
But two conditions. First that never should  
He enter kitchen more in act to steal,  
And on his knee, down-dropping at her feet,  
With many oaths the courteous Gawain swore  
To keep from deeds like this thro' all his life;  
The next that he should stay and eat with her.  
So, nothing loth, the Prince of Courtesy stay'd  
And ate with her the savory, toothsome tarts  
For all an incense-breathing afternoon,  
Till one in haste appear'd when sank the sun,  
Crying, "I crave thy pardon, Queen, thy lord  
Is near."  
                   Thereat Gawain, warn'd by a look  
Which ray'd from out her heavy-lidded eyes,  
Departed with a word of farewell said,  
And past to his own land, while she prepar'd  
To meet King Mark returning from the chase.
