God to aid!<br> These miscreants will be well paid.<br> <br> Hurrah! all goes together; Miles <br> Is good to win my lady's smiles<br> For his good shooting -- Launcelot!<br> On knights a-pace! this game is hot!<br> <br> SIR GUY <i> sayeth afterwards</i> .<br> I said, I go to meet her now,<br> And saying so, I felt a blow<br> From some clench'd hand across my brow,<br> And fell down on the sunflowers<br> Just as a hammering smote my ears,<br> After which this I felt in sooth;<br> My bare hands throttling without ruth<br> The hairy-throated castellan;<br> Then a grim fight with those that ran<br> To slay me, while I shouted: "God<br> For the Lady Mary!" deep I trod<br> That evening in my own red blood;<br> Nevertheless so stiff I stood,<br> That when the knights burst the old wood<br> Of the castle-doors, I was not dead.<br> <br>     I kiss the Lady Mary's head,<br> Her lips and her hair golden red,<br> Because to-day we have been wed.<br>
